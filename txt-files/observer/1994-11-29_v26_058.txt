THE INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER SERVING NOTRE DAME AND SAINT MARY'S 
U.N. unable to keep peace in Bihac 
Serbs have offensive surge 
By AIDA CERKEZ Associated Press 
SARAJEVO 

Just one month ago, out­gunned government troops burst from the isolated Bihac corner of northwest Bosnia and pushed Serb forces backwards in their most successful offen­sive of the war. 
• see US OPTIONS, page 5 
Government troops were on the offensive elsewhere, too, and the United States was preparing to announce it no longer would enforce an arms embargo against the Bosnian government. After 2 1/2 years of taking it on the chin. the Bosnian government was taking it to the Serbs. 
Weeks later, the governmen­t's back is to the wall again. Serbs have retaken most of the territory around Bihac, the U.N. peacekeeping mission is in shambles and the U.S. defense secretary has acknowledged that the Serbs have in effect won the war. 
What went wrong? 
Bosnian army miscalculations played a role. But the story of the Bihac campaign also high­lights U.N. failure to meet its basic responsibilities in the for­mer Yugoslavia. 
Sources in the Muslim-led government's army say plan­ning for the Bihac campaign began two months ago when the United Nations withdrew a unit of French peacekeepers from Bihac and replaced them with poorly trained and under­equipped Bangladeshis. 
That was shortly after the government army had routed renegade Muslims and taken control over the entire Bihac region, which was surrounded by Bosnian Serbs to the south and east and Croatian Serbs to the north and west. 
The Bosnian army concluded that the Bosnian Serbs would attack to secure territory for a railroad that could link the Serbian capital of Belgrade with the farthest-flung parts of Serb-held land in Croatia and Bosnia. The Bihac region was the only missing piece in the railroad plan. 
Rather than wait for an at­tack, the government army struck first, taking 100 square miles of Serb-held territory. 
At the same time, the army and its Bosnian Croat militia al­lies seized the town of Kupres to the south. The Bosnian army was pressing the Serbs in cen­tral and northeast Bosnia. The government appeared to be on a roll. 
The United Nations did not react to the government offen­sives, and they were greeted 
with  some  satisfaction  in  
Washington.  
That  told  the  Serbs  two  

things: that the United Nations probably would not react to a counterattack, and second, that stronger U.S. backing for the Bosnian government meant there was no sense in fighting only a defensive war to protect what they had captured. 
The Bosnian 5th Corps in Bihac was a threat and Bosnian Serbs concluded they had to contain it. 
Government generals ex­pected a Serb counterattack from the south, which began in the second week of November. What they did not expect was intervention by Serbs from Croatia to the north. 
Now, Serb forces are on the outskirts of Bihac, planes based in Croatia have raided Bosnian towns and artillery has shelled Bosnian government territory.

Saint Mary's students hope to receive WVFI 
by EMILY RUFFNER 
News Writer 
The fact that Saint Mary's students have not been able to receive WVFI. the college radio station, for approximately eleven years was discussed yes­terday evening at the Board of Governance (BOG) meeting. 
The station, instead of serv­ing both the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame community, has only been serving Notre Dame, due to the fact that Saint Mary's radio transmitters have been broken. 
Steve Sostak, representing the radio station, informed BOG members that the station will be going FM within the next few years so both campuses will be able to benefit from the station's underground music. 
Sostak suggests more "stu­dent support, including the Saint Mary's community" is needed to encourage the radio station's growth. 
Sostak is encouraging BOG members to fix the broken transmitters, in anticipation of the station's move to FM. 
"Students need to weigh the importance of college radio," claimed Sostak. "Now's the time to get the ball rolling." 
Other BOG news: 
• 
BOG approved $300 toward the December 3 Salsa and Merengue Dance co-sponsored by FUERZA and the Sisters of Nefertiti at Saint Mary's. The dance is featuring "Son del Barrio," Chicago's premier salsa and merengue band. The dance, costing $3 per person, is open to students from both campuses.

BOG's Open Forum is today at 6:45 in Carroll Auditorium. Panel members will include representatives from BOG, RHA. SAB, and SAC to answer questions and take suggestions from any and all students. 


According to the rules under which the United Nations en­tered former Yugoslavia, none of that should have been possible. 
In January 1992. follow­ing six months of war in Croatia, the United Nations established demilitarized zones in the one-third of Croatia con­trolled by Serbs. Most of that territory borders Bosnia.

U.N. control. But some weapons never were under control; others were

Student accosted near Loftus 
By LIZ FORAN Associate News Editor 
A female Notre Dame student was accosted last Tuesday evening, November 22, on her way to Loftus Center, according to Charles Hurley, assistant di­rector of Notre Dame Security. 
The incident occurred at about 7 p.m. as the student was walking between the Band Building and Kline Field, just west of Loftus, Hurley said. 
The student reported that an unidentified male approached her as she walked toward Loftus and put his arm around her. He ran when she began screaming. She was not in­jured. 
The suspect was described as a Hispanic male, about 6 feet tall, approximately 20 to 25 years-old, with a thin build and a dark mustache, Hurley said. He was reportedly wearing a red hooded coat, dark pants and dark shoes. 
Hurley said security searched the area, but found no sign of the man. Again, security urges students to use caution when walking in the perimeter areas of campus and to avoid walking alone at night. 
In another incident, a gradu­ate student residing in Fisher Hall awoke early Thanksgiving morning when she thought someone was in her apartment, Hurley said. 
The student reported awak­ing at 4:30 a.m. when she thought someone was standing over her, and reported hearing footsteps in other parts of the apartment. She pretended she was asleep, then got up at 7:30 
a.m. and called security, Hurley said.

Finding more than the perfect gift 
After going to the gro­cery store four times the day before Thanksgiving and still forgetting the cranberry sauce, thus necessitating a fifth run during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade, I decided I had just not 

yet had my fill of crowds, Suzy Fry so mom and I hit the Viewpoint Editor malls the day after-surely lunacy in its high­est form. Nothing rep­resents the pinnacle of capitalism more than millions of weary bargain hunters armed with credit cards and Nike Cross-trainers the day following the feast of our nation. 
Not nearly as dedicated to the mission at hand as our fellow shoppers, we braved the parking lots and the roaming perfume ladies only to find ourselves back in the car on the way to another shopping center. Sure, the sales were fabulous, but only if you wanted to risk bodily injury for that nifty gift set. 
Finding ourselves too exhausted to continue after searching yet again for a parking spot, we decided to take refuge in a show. I am probably the only person in America never to have seen the original "Miracle on 34th Street." The new version, with Richard Attenburough, Dylan McDermott, Elizabeth Perkins, and Mara Wilson, brings to the nineties the timeless story of convincing non­believers that Santa Claus does indeed exist and the idea that a lie that brings a laugh is far better than a truth that brings a tear. 
Having faith in anything these days proves to be quite a challenge, particularly when one does not believe in relying on others. Perkins, the mother in this story, plays such a woman: ambitious, realistic, caring, honest, and cau­tious-someone anyone could easily identify with. No one can deny that success comes from truth and honesty and hard word, but happiness results from an entirely different formula-one that we often try to ignore. Confusing success for happiness is a pitfall for many, only to be side-stepped by materialism or a midlife crisis. To be happy means depending upon the openness and kindness of others; it means admitting that you need other people. 
Again, I might be the last person in the world to finally discover this and maybe I should have listened to that Barbra Streisand song a long time ago, but this is something we often forget while immersing ourselves in our own lives. In our quest for success, families and friends are not often forgotten; however, we frequently fail to remember the humanity that surrounds us, composes us, and relies on us. Having faith in oneself also means having faith in humanity, no matter how bizarre, unjust, and irrational it may seem. A world with such a humanity can easily afford to believe in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny. 
Braving parking lots and perfume ladies may not sound as difficult as proving the exis­tence of Santa Claus-or dealing with the final deluge of papers and lab reports before the end of the semester-but these are the very circumstances that challenge us to look out­side of ourselves for support. Having faith in our world means not compromising your hap­piness for success as well as not going crazy on the busiest shopping day of the year.

911 operators negligent 
PHILADELPHIA 
Seven 911 operators who worked the night a teen-ager was beaten to death on the steps of a church will be disciplined for mishandling the calls, the mayor said Monday. 
Transcripts of the 911 calls made Nov. 11, the day 16­year-old Eddie Polec was beaten, show operators grew impatient with some callers and waited about 40 minutes after the first of about 20 calls to send police. Police responded within five minutes. 
Mayor Edward G. Rendell said that of 11 operators on duty that night, three will be suspended with intent to dismiss, three will be suspended and transferred and one will be referred to a disciplinary board for a hearing. 
"They are being suspended for abusive and rude responses to callers," Rendell said. "That is unaccept­able." 
Polec was attacked by up to 20 teen-agers swinging baseball bats, and died in a hospital the next day of a fractured skull. Five young men have been charged with murder. 
The attack followed a false rumor that someone from Polec's neighborhood in Philadelphia had raped a girl from suburban Abington. 
The mayor has appointed a committee to come up with recommendations for improving the 911 system. And he said more police supervisors will be added to the opera­tion. 
Ronald Mauldin, a union official, said the operators and dispatchers were being made scapegoats. 
Volkswagon designs new Beetle 
FRANKFURT, Germany 
Is it a bug or isn't it? "Well, yes, but ... " Volkswagen responded Monday when asked if a new car the compa­ny plans to produce is indeed a reincarnated Beetle. The new car, to be sold in the United States, Canada and South America, will have the familiar domed chassis. But instead of the old rear-mounted, air-cooled engine, the car will have a lean, front-mounted engine and new safety features. "This is a whole new car," company spokesman Matt Gennrich said. "The only similarity to the Beetle would be from an aesthetic point of view." With the new car, Volkswagen hopes to cash in on American nostalgia for a legend on four wheels that dur­ing the 1960s came to symbolize cheap, reliable trans­portation. VW plans to begin building the car before the end of the decade, he said, The company has previously indicated the new Beetle might be built in Mexico and be priced at between $12,000 and $13,000. The Beetle, the "people's car" that Volkswagen was created to build, was designed by German engineer Ferdinand Porsche in 1934, shortly after Hitler came to power. 

Carter's ex-nanny gets a new home 
ALBANY, Ga. 
Four months after a flood swept away almost every­thing she owned, Jimmy Carter's childhood nanny is about to move into a new house built with a little muscle from the former president himself. "If heaven is this beautiful," Annie Mae Rhodes said, "I'll take wings and fly away."' Mrs. Rhodes, 77,lost her house and car when the Flint River flooded in July. A treasured picture of Carter's mother, Miss Lillian, was one of the few posses­sions she was able to salvage when the muddy water receded. "I didn't know what I was going to do," Mrs. Rhodes said earlier this month as volunteers put the fin­ishing touches on the house she'll move into next week. "I just prayed. God opened doors. People came down, and they let President Carter know about me." Mrs. Rhodes and her brother, Clyde Ross, 60, who was dis­abled by a stroke, will share the three-bedroom, vinyl­sided house built by Habitat for Humanity, the house­building charity for which Carter has volunteered since 1984.

Suit Challenges FAA Retirement Age 
CHICAGO 

Gerard Sorlucco has been flying since he was 14. In 
three years he'll have to quit the job he loves, unless a 
lawsuit succeeds in overturning the ban keeping pilots 
60 or older from flying large commercial aircraft. "The 
president of the United States was routinely over the age 
of 60, to say nothing of Congress and the Senate," 
Sorlucco said. "It's craziness. absolute craziness." The 
lawsuit was filed Monday by two Chicago-area pilots and 
the Professional Pilots Federation, a group of about 
1,000 members that formed three years ago to challenge 
the Federal Aviation Administration's "Age 60 Rule." 
The rule was established in 1959 out of concern that the 
deteriorating physical and mental functioning associated 
with aging would make pilots over 60 a safety hazard. 
Sorlucco, the group's vice president and a pilot for 
USAir, said that's hogwash. "Airline accidents in recent 
years have been attributed in many instances to pilot 
inexperience," not to older, more experienced pilots, he 
said by telephone from his home in Littleton, N.H. 

Americans help Vietnamese school 
HANOI, Vietnam 

A school paid for by Americans eager to reconcile 
with their former enemies should open in time for the 
20th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War, an 
organizer of the project said Monday. Terry Anderson, 
co-chairman of Vietnamese Memorial Association, said 
he met with future pupils of the elementary school rising 
from a rice paddy in Quang Tri, Vietnam's poorest 
province. "Our reception was more than cordial," 
Anderson said of the giggling children and grateful 
townspeople. "It was delightful." Anderson, a U.S. 
Marine veteran of the war, is a former chief Middle East 
correspondent for The Associated Press and was held 
hostage for 6 1/2 years by Shiite Muslim guerrillas in 
Beirut, Lebanon. The association donated $75,000 for 
the Quang Tri school, which will serve 560 children. 
The association collected donations from Americans to 
build the school as "a living memorial" to the 2 million 
Vietnamese men, women and children who died in the 
war, Anderson said in a telephone interview.

Dahmer killed by inmate in Wisconsin prison attack 
By ARTHUR L. SRB 
Associated Press Writer 
MADISON, Wis. 

Jeffrey Dahmer was at­tacked and killed while clean­ing a prison bathroom Monday in a gruesome end for the man who strangled and dismem­bered 17 boys and men and cannibalized some of them. 
Another inmate was being held in Dahmer's slaying and in the severe beating of another prisoner at Columbia Correctional Institution. Authorities wouldn't identify the suspect, who was serving a life sentence for murder, or of­fer a motive. 
"It's not as brutal as what he did to our children," said Shirley Hughes, a mother of one of Dahmer's victims. "This was just a quick way out." 
Dahmer had been in prison since July 1991, when a hand­cuffed man who had escaped his clutches led police to an apartment containing body parts packed in oil drums, skulls saved as mementos and one or two hearts Dahmer said he had set aside "to eat later." 
"Dahmer had a death wish, and I know that he didn't have the gumption to do it himself, so I had predicted that the day would come when he would be killed in prison," said Gerald Boyle, Dahmer's lawyer at trial. 
The 34-year-old former chocolate factory worker, who was serving 16 life sentences, had been attacked in prison once before. 
In July, an inmate tried to cut his throat during a chapel service, but the razor blade attached to a plastic handle fell 
~· 
apart before it could hurt Dahmer. 
Monday's attack occurred as all three men were working on a cleaning detail in the recre­ation area of the maximum-se­curity prison. 
A bloody broom handle was found at the scene, but Corrections Secretary Michael Sullivan said he didn't know if it was the murder weapon. 
"One could surmise a number of things. Their heads could have been smashed against a wall," Sullivan said. 
"There was a great deal of blood in the area of the attack," Corrections Department spokesman Joe Scislowicz said. 
Dahmer had extensive head injuries and died at a hospital about an hour after he was found. 
At the time of the July attack, Sullivan said that it appeared to have been an isolated incident and that Dahmer was not be­lieved to be in imminent dan­ger. 
"Oh my God! My son! How could this happen?" Dahmer's mother, Joyce Flint, said when TV's "Hard Copy" informed her of his death. 
The other victim in Monday's attack was Jesse Anderson, who was serving a life sentence for stabbing and bludgeoning his wife to death. 
Anderson's case drew wide­spread attention in Wisconsin because of his claim that two black men attacked him and his wife, both white, as they left a restaurant. 
Dahmer's body was found in the staff's bathroom and show­er area next to the basketball

Reactions to Dahmer's Death 
"Oh my God! My son! How could this happen?" -Mother Joyce Flint to TV's "Hard Copy" from her Fresno, Calif., home, 


"He never expressed fear ... From the day he was arrested he felt he deserved anything that he got. " -Stepmother Shari Dahmer to W JW-TV in her hometown of Cleveland.

court. Anderson was found in the prisoners' bathroom across the court and was hospitalized in critical condition with head injuries. 
A guard overseeing the three inmates had just left the bas­ketball court when the attack occurred, Sullivan said. 
He did not know the where­abouts of another guard assigned to watch the prison­ers. 
"He never expressed fear," his stepmother, Shari Dahmer, told WJW-TV in Cleveland. "From the day he was arrested he felt he deserved anything that he got." 
Dahmer's gruesome past came to light in 1991, when a handcuffed man flagged down police and led officers to Dahmer's reeking apartment. Within days, the sandy-haired man had confessed to killing 17 men and boys since 1978 in Milwaukee and Ohio. 
Dahmer drugged, strangled and dismembered his victims, having sex with one corpse and eating parts of others. 
He flushed brains down the toilet, kept skulls and other parts as mementos and saved one or two hearts "to eat later." 
Dahmer pleaded guilty by reason of insanity to 15 Wisconsin slayings at his 1992 trial, but the jury found him sane on all counts. 
He later pleaded guilty to a killing in Ohio. He wasn't charged in one other Wisconsin slaying because of a lack of evi­dence. 
Michael McCann, the district attorney who prosecuted Dahmer, said that he was sad-

ROCHESTER, N.Y. 
A Catholic priest and an ex­guerrilla from Northern Ireland were convicted Monday of charges related to the $7.4 mil­lion robbery of a Brink's ar­mored car depot. 
Two other men, ex-Brink's guard Thomas O'Connor and unemployed teacher Charles McCormick, were acquitted. 
After a seven-week trial, the jury deliberated for 2 1/2 days before reaching their verdict in the nation's fifth-biggest ar­mored-car robbery. 
The Rev. Patrick Moloney and Samuel Millar. who were taken into custody after the verdict, were each convicted of conspir­ing to possess money from the robbery. The two men could get up to five years at their sentencing Feb. 9. 
Millar, a 39-year-old 
Northern Ireland rebel, and Moloney. a 62-year-old Catholic Melkite priest who runs a youth shelter, had leased a New York City apartment where police re­covered $2.01 million a year ago. About $107,000 had serial numbers linking it to the rob­bery. 
McCormick, 30, who sub­leased the apartment to the priest four months before the stash was found, said federal prosecutors produced "no evi­dence whatsoever" linking him to the robbery. 
"It really makes me very sad that power can be abused in such a manner." he told re­porters. 
"I just want to be with my family," a solemn-faced O'Connor said as he hurried out of U.S. District Court with his girlfriend. 
Prosecutors had argued that O'Connor, 55, a retired Rochester police detective who took a security job at Brink's in

"That's not justice. This was murder. I'm hoping that who­ever did it doesn't emerge as a folk hero," McCann said. 
For a year, Dahmer was kept in isolation at the prison in Portage, about 40 miles north of Madison; then the staff de­termined he could mix with other prisoners, Sullivan said. 
The slaying came as relatives of Dahmer's victims try to auc­tion off his possessions as par­tial payment for the judgments they have won against him. 
The contents of his apart­ment included a lava lamp, a toothbrush, homosexual porno­graphic items and an 80-quart kettle.

Clinton gathers support Holiday weather claims lives 

for GATT approval 
By WOODY BAIRD 
Associated Press 

GEHMANTOWN, Tenn. 
A tornado demolished a home where 16 people were at­tending a family reunion, killing two and burying injured survivors in the debris. 
From North Dakota's snow­slicked roads to tornadoes in Tennessee, storms claimed 13 lives and stymied holiday trav­elers around the country. 
A powerful storm that piled up snow in the Northern California mountains last week was moving east. Thunderstorms stretched from the Deep South to Ohio, while parts of the upper Midwest were digging out from their first big snowstorm of the sea­son. 
Snow and freezing rain pelted New Hampshire roads during this morning's commute. More than four inches of snow fell in Concord, N.H. 
"There are vehicles off the road all over the place," New Hampshire state police commu­nications supervisor Jack Zemla said. "(Highways) must be terrible because nobody's on them -they're all off in the woods." 
A pile of bricks and boards was all that remained today of the house landscape planner Walter Person Jr. bought for about $380,000 in a new subdi­vision of Germantown, a fast­growing suburb of Memphis. 
Person, 44, and another man were killed when a tornado struck the two-story house Sunday afternoon. Thirteen others were hospitalized, Deputy Police Chief Brian Roper said.

President Clinton assembled the economic stars from eight previ­ous adminis­trations on Monday to 


give a final Bill Clinton push for con­gressional approval of a 124­nation trade agreement. "We have to do it now. We can't wait until next year," he de­clared. Supporters predicted that the rewrite of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would sail through the House on Tuesday with per­haps as many as 60 votes to spare. But the fate of the trade deal was far less certain in the 100­member Senate, where it must win 60 votes on a procedural question of waiving the Senate's budget rules. The 22,000-page agreement slashes tariffs by an average of 38 percent worldwide and ex­pands the rules of world trade into new areas such as agricul­ture, services and the protec­tion of copyrights and patents. It creates a more powerful World Trade Organization to referee trade disputes and eliminates the power of any one country to block an adverse trade ruling. During a crowded GATT pep rally in the East Hoom, the ad­ministration produced a letter signed by two former Hepublican presidents, Gerald Ford and George Bush, and Democrat Jimmy Carter, urging congressional approval. Clinton acknowledged fears that the agreement, by lower­ing U.S. trade barriers as well as those of other countries, would mean U.S. workers would face even more competi­tion from low-wage workers in other countries. But he said in an increasingly integrated global economy, all countries had to be willing to compete internationally. "There is no other way to deal with this. There is no easy way out," he said. "This will help to solve the underlying anxiety that millions and mil­lions of Americans face." But at a Capitol Hill news conference, a leading Senate opponent, Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., asked if it was fair to make American workers "com­pete against a 12-year-old working 12 hours a day for 12 cents an hour." GATT opponents, however, all but conceded defeat in the House. Hep. Duncan Hunter, R­Calif., said anti-GATT forces 
hoped to get possibly 150 to 180 votes in opposition, far short of the 217 they would need to kill the deal. 
Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., acting chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters GATT should clear the House with 270 votes. 
Consumer activist Ralph Nader said that opponents were concentrating most of their efforts on the Senate, where the deal must first win 60 votes to waive Senate bud­get rules because the pact cov­ers only about one-fourth of the estimated $40 billion in tariff revenues that will be lost over 10 years. 
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor refused to dis­close the administration's cur­rent vote count in the Senate, but he said that a deal reached last week to meet concerns of Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas about the WTO had brought "a number of Republicans on board." 
The administration, which next year will be forced to work with a Congress controlled by Republicans for the first time in 40 years, was calling the GATT vote the first test of whether the two parties can work together. 
It assembled officials from the Eisenhower. Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush administra­tions for the. East Room gather­ing, similar to a bipartisan pep rally held last year right before crucial votes on the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico. The group included five former win­ners of the Nobel prize in eco­nomics who had served in past administrations. 
Clinton said the trade deal would add hundreds of thou­sands of U.S. jobs, boost the av­erage American family's in­come by $1,700 over the next several years and provide the biggest global tax cut in histo­ry. 
James A. Baker III, who served as White House chief of staff and treasury secretary for Heagan and secretary of state for Bush, took on one of GATT's biggest opponents, for­mer presidential candidate Ross Perot. Baker said that Perot's opposition to GATT was just as wrongheaded as his fight last year against NAFTA. 
"During the debate over NAFTA. the misguided and the misinformed predicted a vast sucking sound as American jobs went south," Baker said, repeating one of Perot's famous lines. 
"Today the only sound to be heard is the powerful wind of economic freedom raising pros­perity on both sides of the bor­der," Baker said. 


Rescue crews aided by search dogs and spotlights dug through debris this morning, searching for the missing 16th person. 
About 70 miles away in Friendship, northeast of Memphis, a 75-year-old woman died when a tornado smashed into her home, authorities said. 
Two people in Magee, Miss., died in Sunday's storm: "The high winds just ripped up the tree and it fell on the trailer," a police dispatcher said today. 
The Germantown twister ripped a ragged path through the well-to-do neighborhood, destroying 25 houses, a high school and a church and dam­aging 150 other homes. 
"It was like 'Apocalypse Now,"' said Steve Johnston, who along with other neighbors dug into the rubble with his hands to help the trapped Person family. 
Bricks, broken lumber and other debris littered the area for blocks. 
A twisted van lay on its back, and the crushed remains of a sport utility vehicle protruded from the wreckage. 
By the time ambulances arrived, Johnston had a half­dozen bleeding survivors stretched out on the floor of his den. 
"We couldn't stop to take care of them because there were still more back in the house," he said. 
Johnston, who moved to the suburb five months ago, said he had not yet made friends with his neighbors. 
"We had been planning to take them some cookies or something," he said.

U.S. examines stance after Serbian advances 
By DONALD ROTHBERG 
Associated Press 
Congress to take good look at situation zn Bosnia as Dole heads overseas 
WASHINGTON 

With the S e r b s advancing on Bihac, the West con­cedes it is powerless to stop them. All that remains 


is to find a Bob Dole strategy for stepping away from a war no outsider was ever willing to fight. 
"There are really not good choices here," said White House staff chief Leon Panetta on Monday, displaying the gloomy mood of the Clinton administration concerning the former Yugoslavia. 
The military threats are gone. The new emphasis is on diplo­macy and threatening the Bosnian Serbs with interna­tional isolation, something they've lived with throughout the conflict. 
In the search for diplomatic carrots to offer, the United States appeared ready to agree to a Serbian confederation in exchange for the Serbs' com­mitment to the territorial in­tegrity of Bosnia. 
What happens next in Bosnia depends in large part on what the Bosnian Serbs choose to do. 
Will they press their military advantage and move on other "safe havens" such as Gorazde? 
Will they demand a revised peace plan that gives them more of Bosnia than the 49 per­cent put forward by the United States and its allies? 
No matter how the terrible conflict is resolved, the Clinton administration is in for an ex­tended period of second-guess­ing. 
Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. predicted the new Republican majority in Congress would ex­amine how the situation in Bosnia got to where it is, par­ticularly regarding the role of the United Nations. 
Lugar also said it was time to extricate the U.N. forces from Bosnia. end the arms embargo against the Bosnian govern­ment and begin "extensive air strikes that indicate that NATO does amount to something." 
Incoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., flew to Brussels Monday to meet with NATO officials. 
And he made clear his frus­tration with the United Nations, which is catching a lot of heat on Capitol Hill for preventing NATO from taking tougher mili­tary action. 

British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said that he and Prime Minister John Major would meet Dole on Wednesday and emphasize British opposi­tion to a stepped-up air cam­paign. 
Dole also made it clear the new Congress would be "taking a hard look at what we spend in the United Nations." 
The Kansas senator conceded that miscalculations on how to deal with the breakup of Yugoslavia began during the Bush administration. 
"I think we gave the wrong signals to the Serbs," he told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday. "But it got worse and worse and worse, because President Clinton couldn't de­cide what to do, and didn't do anything." 
George Kenny, who quit the State Department during the Bush administration because he wanted tougher U.S. action against the Serbs, now sides with the British and French view of the futility of military action. 
As for U.S. involvement, Kenny said, "If we're really not going to do anything construc­tive and we're just muddling along hoping somehow things will work out, it's probably bet­ter for us to leave." 
Kenny argues that the United States "completely miscalcu­lated what would happen if the Serbs went on the offensive." 
He said that all the talk in Washington about supplying arms to the Bosnian govern­ment, encouraged it to launch an offensive in the Bihac area. 
After surprising early success, the Bosnian gains were swept away by a Serb counteroffen­sive. 
Marshall Harris, another State Department dissident who resigned during the Clinton administration, still believes in Western military power. 
"We can still turn everything around on a dime if we wanted to," he said. 
The administration continues to place great stock in the pos­sibility that the Serbian gov­ernment in Belgrade will main­tain pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to accept a negotiated settlement. 
Shooting the breeze 
For months, the administra­tion has hoped futilely that Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic could force his Bosnian brethren to give up much of what they have taken. 
State Department Spokesman Mike McCurry suggested it was the Bosnian Serbs whose backs were against the wall. 
"They can continue to fight and continue to exhaust them­selves, to continue to leave themselves outside the com­munity of nations and to suffer the economic deprivation and isolation that entails," he said. 
It was a threat that seemed no more likely to move the Serbs than the earlier one of ineffectual NATO air strikes.

Ford announces plan to invest in South Africa 
ByTOMCOHEN Associated Press 
JOHANNESBURG 

Six years after leaving South Africa because of apartheid, Ford Motor Co. announced Monday it would buy back some of the operation it left behind and re-enter the coun­try. 
The size of the investment was not disclosed, but Ford promised to inject cash, new equipment and products into South African Motor Corp. Ltd., known as Samcor, which as­sembles Ford, Mazda and Mitsubishi vehicles. 
Ford is returning to existing facilities, not providing the new investment sought by President Nelson Mandela since his African National Congress won the country's first all-race elec­tion in April. 
Since the end of white rule, other companies that have re­turned or plan to return to South Africa include Pepsi-Cola International, Hyatt International Hotels, CPC International, Eastman Kodak, Honeywell Corp. and Sara Lee Corp. 
The agreement signed by of­ficials from Ford and Anglo American Industrial Corp. Ltd., the holding company for Samcor, gives each a 45 per­cent stake. The Samcor Employees Trust holds the re­maining 10 percent. 
Samcor sells about 11 per­cent of the approximately 200,000 passenger cars sold annually in South Africa. 
Ford South Africa, a sub­sidiary of Ford Canada, oper­ated in the country from 1933 until 1985, when it merged with Anglo American's auto­motive operations to form Samcor. 
It pulled out of South Africa in 1988 because of the apartheid system of racial dis­crimination. Ford Canada turned over the larger part of its holdings to Samcor Employees Trust. 
GM says it agreed in October to begin selling some of its North American-made products in South Africa through Delta Motor, a company formed by some of its South African man­agers when GM pulled out in 1986. 
"We have no plans at this time to go back in there with a manufacturing operation," said GM spokesman J. David Hudgens.

Britain increases contributions 

By MAUREEN JOHNSON 
Associated Press Writer 
LONDON 

Parliament v o t e d Monday to increase Britain's contribution to the European 
Union bud-John Major get, ending a fight on which Prime Minister John Major staked the life of his government. 
Legislators from Major's Conservative Party cheered when the 329-44 vote was an­nounced. 
But the dispute left Major fac­ing dissidents resentful at being forced to support him, a possi­ble leadership challenge and an impending revolt over a sched­uled doubling of fuel taxes within a week. 
Major threatened last week to quit if Parliament rejected the bill to boost Britain's $3.75 bil­lion contribution to the European Union next year by $118 million. Future contribu­tions also would be increased. 
In the end, only seven Conservatives voted against Major after he threatened to re-

sign and force an election the party probably would lose. 
The Conservatives are some percentage 30 points behind Labor in public opinion polls and would be almost certain to lose their 15-year grip on power in an election. 
The rebels were to be pun­ished by being banned from government office or taking part in any leadership chal­lenge. 
That technically wipes out Major's 14-seat majority in the 651-member House of Commons. But party managers hoped the rebels' desire to win back party support would im­prove their voting records. 
Parliament voted down a Labor Party attempt to require more aggressive steps by the European Union to cut waste and fraud in its spending. Seven members of Major's party cast ballots against him in that 330-303 vote. 
Labor legislators abstained in the final vote on the increased budget contribution. 
Deep divisions remained within the Conservative party over Europe, between Major and the majority of the 22­member Cabinet on the one side, and mainly right-wingers who oppose the closer integra­tion of the 12-nation European Union. 
"Our money is being used ... to bribe the Greeks, the Spaniards, the Portuguese and the Irish all to believe in ever closer European union," de­clared Norman Lamont, fired by Major last year as treasury chief. 
Lamont, now arank-and-file legislator, said Britain might have to withdraw from the European Union unless it could redefine its relationship with the continent of Europe. 
Ailing lawmakers turned out for the high-stakes vote. One Conservative legislator came to the Commons from the hospital. and another entered in ·a wheelchair. 
The biggest sacrifice was by a legislator who renounced an ancient Scottish title so he could vote for the bill. 
Had he not given up the title, he would have been forced to join the upper House of Lords. 
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, who inherited the ti­tle Earl of Selkirk when his un­cle died Thursday, said, "I owe it as a duty to my constituents ... and as a matter of loyalty to the prime minister and to the Conservative Party."

The government has paid out only $20 million so far and the balance has grown to $516 mil­lion.

• LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
ND Family should embrace all members, including Rita 

Dear Editor: 
"Notre Dame Family" is a concept in which I place a great deal of stock. However, experiences such as the con­demning of John Rita by many members of this community prior to his trial, as well as the "blood-lust" reaction by many to this verdict. leave me somewhat disillusioned. I have learned, after spending seven years of my life on this campus, that "Notre Dame Family" is a term that is too often tossed around by some without giving adequate thought to its intended definition. It should be used to connote a sense of all-encompassing camaraderie, fellowship, and unity that exists in, and extends to, all members of this community. In reality, it exists to some so long as it creates no controver­sy -so long as it does not force them to take a stand that is less than popular. 
John found this out all too well as some members of the ND community, with little knowledge of the facts, flatly turned on him. To those friends and supporters of John, and to all who real­ize that "one man's word is no man's word; we should quietly hear both sides" (Johann Wolfgang Van Goethe). the crit­icisms of this letter do not apply. 
I was one of John's roommates during his final two years of law school. l feel fortunate to count John as one of my best friends. This was true before Nov. 13, 1993, and it. has remained true. Take it from someone who knows John-and none of you who have por­trayed him as some sort of heartless sub-human devoid of a conscience do_:_ he is a wonderful person. He is one of the most intelligent. dedicated, caring, and considerate individuals that I have ever known. He would do anything to help others. lie would never do any­thing to intentionally harm another per­son. 
That being said, I have absolutely reached the end of my rope with listen­ing to people who don't know him pub­licly trash him. Specifically, I speak to those of you who, with the aid of the hearsay and innuendo produced by the irresponsible local media, had tried,

convicted. and executed John in your own minds prior to his trial, and have continued to do so since. Rest assured that this acquittal was not a cheap one grounded in some obscure technicality or procedural flaw. Rather, it was derived from the facts and the evidence of the case, as anyone who attended the trial would recognize. 
Regarding the lynch mob masquerad­ing as an assemblage of responsible and conscientious Notre Dame students that paraded into the court room to make a mockery of John's legal right to present his side of the story-! was, and remain, especially appalled by your behavior. I listened with disbelief as one of those students described on television how Teresa McCarthy had put out some call to arms on the eve of John's testimony. How proud you all must have felt to have responded with such vigor. I lis­tened to this student admit that the group had attended the proceedings that day for the sole purpose of attempting to "shake up" (her words) John, as well as his attorney, Charles Asher. This agen­da, however, was shamelessly carried out under the guise of support for both Mara's family and her memory. 
If support had in fact been the true agenda, then it would have been a noble one indeed, and one to be applauded. Perhaps I hold an idealistic notion of the meaning of "support," if support were the true motivation, then these people would have made it to the court room prior to the final full day. I was present for several days (since I was a witness. I was not permitted to attend until I testi­fied) and, with very few exceptions, the faces that I saw that day were new. This fact serves only to support the con­tentions of the aforementioned student, not that they were ever doubted. Did you simply not understand the gravity of the proceedings? You tried to take an event that would determine the course of John Rita's life, and turn it into a cir­cus. Did it ever occur to you that the one with whose right to a fair trail you tried to interfere, is no less a "brother" as a Notre Dame student than Mara was your "sister"? 
It escapes me how, regardless of the side on which you come down, you could consider such actions as constituting the pursuit of justice. After all, isn't justice the cause that all of this was supposed to advance? I guess you deemed John a "black sheep" of the "family," and thus unworthy of your compassion, due to the fact that he was on trial for two horrible crimes. Never mind the fact that he ve­hemently professed his innocence from the outset. In your minds, he was already guilty and, if you had your way, the state would not have had to prove his guilt at all, let alone beyond a reasonable doubt. So much for the con­cept of "innocent until proven guilty." Yet, I am confident that every one of you would want that standard applied to you if you were charged with two felonies. 
While I was attempting to listen to John's testimony, I was forced to try and block out the whispered comments from the gallery, particularly those of three female students seated directly behind me. Included among those comments was the following directed at John: "You're going to burn in hell." As I write this letter two weeks later, I am still incredulous as to the sheer igno­rance, immaturity, and irresponsibility surrounding such a proclamation. Is the closed-minded, judgmental, and holier­than-thou attitude that abounded in that court room on that day, and is so perva­sive among the radicals of this commu­nity, ever going to subside? I would like to say to this person that you are sup­posed to be an adult, and, as a college student, one with a mind open to knowl­edge and conflicting points of view. By making such a comment, you fell woe­fully short of both a shred of knowledge regarding the facts and a knowledge of the character of the accused. 
Let me assure the Notre Dame com­munity that no one feels more sorrow regarding Mara's death than John. I have first-hand knowledge of the amount of tears that have been shed by him as a result of this horrible tragedy, and, contrary to the opinions of many, 
GARRY TRUDEAU 
IIAJOUWN7; E'XC&PT Ht:-'S 
MAP& /TG£1<­MAN&.{)/911 ON.' 

these tears have not been the result of' selfish thoughts. Of course he was scared, and of course he was worried about his future. Not one of us in our right minds wouldn't have felt similar emotions were we standing in John's shoes. But his tears have been the prod­ucts of the realization that a young life was lost in an accident in which he was involved. He is, has been, and will con­tinue to be haunted by that knowledge. That fact, however, does not make him guilty; rather, it serves as evidence that he is a compassionate and thoughtful person who possesses a healthy con­science. Upon hearing all of' the evi­dence, a jury of John's peers had the duty of determining John's guilt or lack thereof. It chose .the latter. Unfortunately, the verdict was, to many. irrelevant. In the minds of the people, John is still guilty. 
To those members of the "Notre Dame Family" who deserted John, I offer the following quote by the late theologian Reinhold Niebuhr: "Family life is too in­timate to be preserved by the spirit of justice. It can be sustained by a spirit of love which goes beyond justice." For those to whom this quote speaks, I would submit that justice did in fact pre­vail, and that it was manifested in the jury's verdict. But since your minds will doubtlessly remain unchanged, I ask you to consider reaching out and embracing John nevertheless. He is your "brother," and your support would mean a great deal to him; perhaps it would even fur­ther your own healing process too. 
Finally, I would like to conclude by sincerely thanking those to whom this letter does not apply-those that rec­ognized that John was, and remains. worthy of your thoughts, prayers, and compassion. Those that kept an open mind and refrained from judging in the absence of knowledge. Those that recognized that there were two sides to every story, and that the system must be allowed to run its course. I know that John thanks you as well.

Twisting in the wind 
Tie leaves Irish and Trojans wishing for a different end 
By GEORGE DOHRMANN Sports Editor 
LOS ANGELES 

It was a sight all too fitting for the run that has masqueraded as the 1994 Notre Dame football season. A good ten minutes after Notre Dame and Southern California fought or stumbled (take your pick) to a 17-17 tie at the Los Angeles Coliseum, Irish coach Lou Holtz was leading his team back on the field. 
USC coach John Robinson was at one end of the stadium, saluting his seniors with a farewell address to what was left of the crowd. Holtz was huddling his team in the opposite corner, trying to give support to a team that not only failed to extend Notre Dame's run of 11 straight victories over the Trojans but was in need of moral support. 
"There was no where to meet here," Holtz said of the visitors' locker room. "1 looked down into the showers . You tell me where to meet. There were some things I wanted to share and I didn't want to walk out of here without sharing them." 
While Holtz hollered over Robinson's address and the hooting of the remaining Trojan and Irish faithful, most fans wandered to their cars in disbelief, shrouded in a

during the final frigid moments of Saturday's 17-17 sister­smooch against Southern Cal. 


It was indeed Holtz who handicapped Powlus, but not with a hatchet. With hand­offs. 
With more than 90 yards of turf to tra­verse, and not much time to do it, Holtz inexplicably chose to run the ball on two of four downs. 
With arguably the best receiver in the nation in Derrick Mayes and a quarter­back who has proven more than capable of delivering him the ball, it seemed a per­fect opportunity to fling the ball upfield. If Notre Dame can't count on the Hail Mary, who can?

• GAME NOTES 

'Yeah. • .I think so.' 
Holtz decides to go for field goal despite Schroffner's remark 
By GEORGE DOHRMANN 
Sports Editor 
LOS ANGELES 

Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz wasn't sure himself that he made the right decision when he elected for a Stefan Schroffner field goal try instead of a fourth-and-two attempt at the USC 20-yard line. 
A little over six minutes remained in the game and Holtz elected to go with Schroffner despite the kicker's answer of "yeah...I think so," when Holtz asked if he felt he could make the kick. 
"Maybe I should have gone for it," Holtz said. "The players wanted me to but the whole thing was that with six minutes to go in the game, get a two-score lead. That's what we were trying to do. 
"Had we gone for it and not made it, then they take it down and score and went for two, we would have lost. ..You've got to go with the percentages." 
The percentages didn't help when Schroffner's kick skied low and USC's Israel lfeanyl blocked the kick into the arms of teammate Sammy Knight who rambled to the Notre Dame 16-yard line, which led to USC's tying score. 
"I still think it was the right decision with the facts at hand not the results," Holtz said. 
JUST LIKE INDIANA: It was a fine fall day in South Bend. The problem? The game was in Los Angeles. 
The temperature for Notre Dame's 17-17 tie was the most talked about item during Saturday's contest. Temperatures were in the mid forties and swirling winds of over 25 miles per hour dropped the wind-chill.into the low 30s. 

OOOOHHHH NELLLIE: Jackson and fellow commentator Bob Griese had their fair share of trouble. ABC lost its feed for the end of the first half and for several plays during the third quarter. 
A main breaker at the stadium was blown down, knocking out ABC's view. 
ABC producer Bob Goodrick solved part of the problem by borrowing a feed from Prime Ticket, which was taping the game for a delayed broadcast. With Prime Ticket sup­plying the view, ABC still needed to supply some audio. Ticket's Tom Kelly and Craig Fertig started the second half but were soon cut off. Jackson and Griese tried calling the game by telephone but the audio was muf­fled. ABC resorted to John Saunders doing his best play-by-play from the studio in New York. 
It was the second time ABC fumbled dur­ing an Irish!frojan matchup in Los Angeles. In 1986, ABC missed John Carney's game­winning field goal in a 38-37 Irish win. 
BUTTER FINGERS: Charlie Stafford dropped what could have been a huge play for the Irish offense in the second quarter. 
Pinned at it's own two-yard line Notre Dame looked to Stafford on a post pattern to give them some breathing room. Quarterback Ron Powlus lofted a perfect pass into Stafford's arms but the senior wide receiver allowed the ball to slip through with nothing but green in front of him. 
"I was so wide open," Stafford said. "I was worried about running and forgot about catching the ball." 


Irish

strange feeling of senselessness. A tie? A tie? Few things could be so cruel. 
"A tie doesn't please anybody," Holtz said. "This is disappointing. I'm sure Southern Cal feels the same way." 
"We didn't come here to play for a tie," USC coach John Robinson said. 
Both teams had a chance to place a dif­ferent cap on the contest but when the opportunity arose both the Irish and the Trojans let them flutter away with the brisk Southern California wind which gust­ed from 20-25 m.p.h. for most of the game. 
The Irish seemed to have the best chance to put the Trojans away when Stefan Schroffner lined up for 37-yard field goal with 6:43 left in the game and Notre Dame leading 17-10. But this gap of opportunity closed quickly, filled by a 6-foot-6 moun­tain of maroon and gold named Israel Ifeanyi. The Trojan linebacker blocked the kick which safety Sammy Knight scooped into his arms and carried to the Irish 16. 
Four plays later tailback Shawn Walters pounded in from the one-foot line. "I thought I hit it good," Schroffner said. "I thought I got it up." 
Notre Dame's plunder and Walters' score presented the first chance for the Trojans to spell out a different conclusion to the game, but Robinson elected for a Cole Ford extra point instead of a two-point conver­sion attempt. 
"I was afraid if we missed a two, we wouldn't get the ball back," Robinson said. 
But opportunity number two arose when Robinson's squad did get the ball back. Notre Dame couldn't move the ball on the ensuing possession, and aided by a 29-yard punt by Notre Dame's Chris Wachtel, the Trojans took over just short of midfield with 2:22 showing on the clock. 
It was a golden opportunity for USC sig­nal-caller Rob Johnson to shake the voices which have engulfed him after every big game he has played. Going into the contest he was 0-5 as a starter against UClA and Notre Dame. 
But Johnson's offensive line never gave him the chance. He was off the mark on first down, sacked for a loss on second, and then tripped over a teammate on third. A USC punt rolled to the Irish eight with less than a minute to play. Notre Dame tried a few plays in the closing seconds, a dossier which including a pair of draw runs for Lee Becton. Closing seconds. Mountains of yards before field goal range. Run the draw? This one was called a bit early. 
Johnson was 15 for 29 for 187 yard with a touchdown and an interception. He was booed by fans when Robinson introduced the senior. 
"I guess it's better to tie than to lose, but as seniors we didn't want to go out with a tie," Johnson said. "It stinks." 
Irish quarterback Ron Powlus closed the day 13 of 22 for 115 yards with one scoring strike and no interceptions. He also ended the game with an all-too fitting remark. "A f--tie," he said as he ran off the field. 
Notre Dame nearly doubled USC's time of possession, more. than 38 minutes for the Irish to 21:30 for the Trojans. Despite poor field position, the Irish grounded out yardage on the Trojan defense. Becton Jed the way with 156 of Notre Dame's 226 yards on the ground. 
Becton led the charge on the ground in the early going, and Derrick Mayes sup­plied the air support. 
During an 80-yard drive during the sec­ond quarter, Becton rumbled over the left side for 28 yards and Powlus found Mayes for 18 more. Becton tacked on six more yards to the USC 22 and then Powlus hit Ray Zellars in the endzone for his 19 touchdown pass on the year, a Notre Dame single-season record. 
The Irish built a 17-10 third quarter lead on a one-yard plunge by Powlus, after a 17-yard catch by Mayes put Notre Dame at the USC three. 
Schroffner did connect on a 29-yarder to give Notre Dame a 3-0 lead early which was quickly countered by USC's 34-yard scoring drive which ended in a Johnson pass to Johnny McWilliams. 
• GRADED POSITION ANALYSIS 
QUARTERBACK 8+ With the running game clicking, Ron Powlus could be the quarterback he should have been able to be all season long. Not spectacular but solid nonetheless. Maybe could have avoided a few sacks by throwing it away, but showed tough­ness on the run. RUNNING BACKS A-
This game showed just how important Lee Becton and Ray Zellars are to this team. How many times did Becton break the first tackle to reach the stick. Zellars didn't really get it going on the ground, but his receptions were crucial. 
RECEIVERS 8 The key drops of Charles Stafford and Oscar McBride stand out. Solid blocking and the expected contribution of Mayes were there though. 
OFFENSIVE LINE 8+ The running attack finally had teeth this week due in large part to play of this crew. Sure, Becton made holes where holes didn't exist but for the most part, the Irish controlled the line of scrimmage, and the ball. DEFENSIVE LINE B+ 
Oliver Gibson again showed a surprising little speeJ burst in getting to Johnson a few times. This group applied constant pressure, culminating in the last USC possession. 
LINEBACKERS 8 Jeremy Sample's last regular season game was a memorable one. Three solo tackles, a key sack and another tackle for a loss is a decent day's work. Wynn and Cobbins contributed their fair sharein holding Tailback U. to under 100 ya1 Js on the ground. 
SECONDARY C+ Frosh Ivory Covington found himself in the right place at the right time. Unfortunately, the same could not be said for the man assigned to Keyshawn Johnson. SPECIAL TEAMS F 
Disgusting, disgraceful, dispicable, and disastrous. Clearly, this area cost the Irish the win. Punting, blocking on field goal attempts, and lack of return game has hurt the Irish all season long. This time, it killed them. 
COACHING 8 Once again, pretty good defensive gameplan, as it held the Trojans to essentially just t 0 points. Questionable call on the field goal attempt, but if it is not blocked, 
the Irish win. The simple reminder that this was Notre Dame/USC seemed to motivate enough. OVERALL GRADE 2. 77 
An F doesn't help your overall GPA all that much. It didn't help the Irish on the field either. Continued improvement pretty much all around, but 17 points is still too few if this team is to be considered anything but a failure.

Every once in a while: my grandma goes to a Pantera concert, children around the world join hands and sing, my cat has kittens, and some poor soul, perhaps on a dare by her buddies, decides to invite Mr. Kazlauskas (aka "me"), the Lithuanian Nightmare, to a dance. I like dances. Dances are good. People like to dance. With each other. By them­selves. With wolves. 
I don't claim to be a Gerardo on the dance floor, and to be honest. I'd rather sit by the cold cut tray. snap my fingers, hum to the music, and eat those little green olives with the red things in the middle. But as an Observer columnist. my fame precedes me, and I scarcely evade the scrutinizing public eye. Thus, I bust a move. 
Yet, the thrill of a dance, apart from sharing an enchanting evening with a wholesome, young lady, is the opportunity to purchase the traditional "gift." It could be flowers, and maybe that's what your date likes. Yet, if you fall prey to the Flowerama propaganda of this world, the challenge is sidestepped-the challeng·e to find a gift that says as much about you as it does about your date, the opportunity to find a tangible momento of the spiritual unity you will share as a "couple" on that particular night. With this in mind, I make the pilgrimage to Toy-R-Us usually on the Friday afternoon before the dance. 
Upon entering Geoffrey Giraffe's holy of holies, it is imperative to resist the urge to jump at the first good thing you see. The gift search is a lengthy process, and it requires extensive browsing through the store. You do not find the gift-you must let the gift find you. If that takes an hour-and-a-half, then so be it. 
I think the late Ayatollah said it best, or maybe it was the entertainer formerly known as Prince, "You cannot rush your emotions. Let them flow, fast or slow. with the steadiness of a river. Only then will your gift be as pure as Rocky Mountain spring water." 
Because I have lived by these words, rarely have I picked out a gift that made me unhappy. I have also found that through experience I have become a stronger gift buyer. To prove my point, allow me to journey through a small list of gifts that I bought over the last couple of years. 
I began with buying doll's clothes for my date, and I am ashamed. She had no dolls, and the gift took not only my money but my pride as well. The World Wrestling Federation merchandise had all been marked down on account of the federation's becoming defunct, and instead, I bought a crappy gift. 
However. I made a suc­cessful follow-up effort with a "Land of the Lost" action fig­ure. When I presented the lit-tie· caveman, "Stink," to my date, her roommates were envi­ous and cool was my mid­dle name. Stink came c o m p I e t e Kris Kazlauskas with prehis-Accem Columnist toric tools and a little trigger on his back that, when pressed repeatedly, gave Stink incredible "running action." 
Basking in the glory of "Stink," I probably slipped a little, but my date became the proud owner of a Jordan Knight (NKOTB) action figure. Actually, there wasn't much action to him, so I guess he was just a "figure." And though he may not have had moving limbs, he was still hangin' tough in my book. 
It took a while, but I knew that I would do it sooner or later. I bought a little imitation Nerf crossbow. It was a sensi­ble gift, and though lacking on the creativity, I actually bought it for myself. You see, I was kind of hoping that my date would not like the gift, and at the end M the night I would tell her that she was not worthy of my generosity, whereupon I would take the gift back. Unfortunately, she played with it all night, and it was a bitter struggle to smile through my disappointment. 
I took my roommate with me to pick out the next gift, and after a debate, we put back the horse necklace and bought a pinata. The gorgeous cre­ation was a bull of some sort, and we decided to fill it with a bag of Starburst® fruit chews. To add a bit of tastelessness, we filled the bull from the rear end. Last I heard, the bull was given a permanent spot on the mantle, between pictures of rna and pa. I was definitely proud of that one. 

But the most recent, and certainly most mature pur­chase, came a couple of weeks ago. At a loss for ideas, I ventured into the doll sec­tion, pretending that I was looking for a present for an imaginary sister. I found a baby that spoke Spanish, but thirty bucks was a little steep. 
Time was running out, and I was feeling the heat-but I delivered. When I greeted my date, I presented, with great enthusiasm and a touch of cockiness, the Joey Lawrence action doll. She loved the gift, and I knew she would. After all. this teen heartthrob came with a little leather jacket as well as different clothes for him to wear. WHOA. 
But alas, the past is the past, and faced with this chal­lenge once more, I can only tell you that I've already found the next gift-11nd it's a doozie. I won't tell you what it is exactly. but it's about a foot tall, and when you press her tummy, she starts to rap. I just hope that they're not sold out by Friday. ·

With the end of this Semester upon us, it is assured we're all beginning to prepare for the impending threat of finals. In order to survive this week and a half of hell, many of us will be relying on heavy duty doses of Mountain Dew, coffee, cappuc­cino, or even caffeine pills to gets us through those long days and nights of study we enjoy so much. If you're one of the many planning to live on caffeine dur­ing finals week, here's some news for you: 
What is it? 
Caffeine is a naturally occur­ring stimulant found in coffee beans, tea leaves, cocoa beans, and kola nuts. One of the most commonly ingested drugs in the world, caffeine can be found in coffee, tea, most sodas, choco­late products, and many com­mon over-the-counter drugs. 
Caffeine. • • Is it a Friend or a Foe? 
Jolt Cola -67.2, Mountain Dew -56.6, Dr. Pepper -50.6, Diet Coke -46.0, Pepsi 36.2, Diet Pepsi -36.0, Coke Classic ­33.6. 
Caffeine (mg) in a 6 oz. cup: Coffee-105, Espresso-200 
Caffeine (mg) in a 6 oz. cup of tea: Salada-49, Bigelow-47, Lipton -46, Darjeeling -38. 
Caffeine (mg ) in one tablet: Vivarin -200, No Doz -100 
What it does? 
Caffeine affects the body by increasing the release of adren­aline, increasing the rate of chemical reactions in cells. and most importantly, blocking the affect of adenosine (neurologi­cal suppress~nt) in the brain. 
The benefits of caffeine are commonly known. Better con­centration, increased alertness, and faster reaction to stimuli are experienced 15 to 30 min­utes after the consumption of a caffeinated beverage and these of one overdosing on caffeine is very great, and the side effects can be devastating to a student trying to learn a semester's worth of material in one night. Irritability. anxiety. abdominal pain, increased urination, nau­sea, restlessness, muscle spasms, and heart palpitations are commonly experienced after ingesting too much caf­feine. 
Responsible Use ... What to Do. 
There's no special formula to avoid OD'ing on caffeine. In or­der to reduce the risk of over­dose symptoms, there's one Rule of Thumb: Do not con­sume more than 300 mg of caf­feine, 6 cans of soda or 3 cups of coffee, per day. If your toler­ance is high, limit yourself to 600 mg. half a pot of coffee or a twelve pack of your favorite soda. In addition to watching the amount you take, increase your consumption of water.

Niners dump New Orleans 
Spurs struggle, but defeat Timberwolves 
By DAVE GOLDBERG 
Associat~d Pr~ss 
NEWOHLEANS 
The San Francisco 49ers put a punctuation point on the ob­vious Monday night -nobody in the NFL but Dallas is close to them. 
The Niners became the first team to clinch a playoff spot Monday night by overcoming a couple of mistakes that would kill mere mortals to beat New Orleans 35-14 as Steve Young threw for 281 yards and four touchdowns. 
It gave them: -Their 11th NFC West title in 14 years; -Their 12th straight season of 10 wins or more, -Their 11th playoff berth in 12 years. 
"We couldn't get them stopped," Saints coach Jim Mora said of a team that con­verted 11 of its 15 third-down opportunities. 
"They're the best offensive team in football, the best offense I've ever seen." 
The win kept the Niners (10­
2) on top of Dallas (1 0-2) for the home-field advantage on their inevitable course toward a third straight NFC title game. San Francisco, which won for the seventh straight time, would get the home field if the teams are tied because it beat the Cowboys two weeks ago. 
Young, who had completed 
68.2 percent of his passes entering the game, was 24 of 30 as he hit four TD passes in a game for the fourth time this season. The Niners, despite their mistakes, totally dominat­ed, outgaining the Saints 461­222 and keeping the ball for more than 38 minutes. 
He threw first-half touch­downs of 4 yards each to Brent Jones and John Taylor, found Jones again from 6 yards out on a drive that consumed 9:02 at the start of the second half ami capped the scoring with a 43-yarder on a slant to backup Nate Singleton. 

That was enough to negate Tyrone Hughes' 86-yard return of a fumble by Ricky Watters for the Saints (4-8) and a sec­ond-quarter fumble by Young at the Saints' 12 that held the Niners to a 20-14 lead at half­time. 
San Francisco now has won 10 or more games for 12 straight seasons and qualified for the playoffs in 11 of them, missing only in 1991 despite a 10-6 record. 
This year's team, however, is one rebuilt by the signing of a half-dozen veterans to bolster a defense that can stop Dallas. The latest newcomer, Tim Harris, got a sack Monday night in his first game under a con­tract that pays him $5,000 each time he dumps the quarter­back. 
The Niners led 20-14 at the half, but it might have been more if not for those two San Francisco fumbles. 
But Hughes also contributed to San Francisco's scoring, fumbling a punt on his own 7 late in the first quarter, a play that led to the Niners' first TD. 
San Francisco took a 3-0 lead on its first possession on Doug Brien's 40-yard field goal. 
The Niners' made it 10-0 with 10 seconds left in the first peri­od on Young's TO pass to Jones after Hughes' fumble and appeared to be heading for a 17-0 lead when Young fumbled as he was scrambling to the Saints' 12 and Jimmy Spencer recovered. 
One play later, Jim Everett hit Michael Haynes for 52 yards to the San Francisco 36, leading eventually to Mario Bates' 3­yard TD run that made it 10-7. But Dexter Carter's 45-yard kickoff return put the ball at the Saints' 49 and it took Young seven plays to make it 17-7.

SAN ANTONIO 
Against a team with only one victory, the San Antonio Spurs had some trouble getting up to play the Timberwolves. 
The Spurs had to outlast Minnesota's fourth-quarter rally to beat the Timberwolves 92-88 Monday night behind David Robinson's 24 points. 
"It's always difficult to get up and concentrate on a game like this," San Antonio coach Bob Hill said. "Sometimes losing a game like this is a better lesson for the team. But we have to be happy we won the game. Minnesota is a very capable group. I thought they played hard tonight." 
Trailing 70-58 heading into the fourth quarter, the Timberwolves pulled to 84-81 on Sean Rooks' layup with 2:34 remaining. 
But San Antonio, which made only five field goals in the final quarter, iced the game by hit­ting 11 of 12 free throws in the final 12 minutes. The Timberwolves, who got their biggest point total in four games, have won only one of their 13 games. 
"We were much better tonight," Minnesota coach Bill Blair said. "We got out there and played as good as we can play. I don't think San Antonio believes they played as good as they can play. But we played tough and the Spurs got out of this with the win." 
Robinson became the second­leading scorer in Spurs history with a free throw with 6:37 left in the third quarter. That was his 10,291th point, moving him past James Silas on the Spurs scoring list. 
But Robinson has a long way to go to catch George Gervin, who's No. 1 with 23,602 points. 
Vinny Del Negro added 19 points, Sean Elliott 16 and Avery Johnson 13 as the Spurs snapped a two-game losing streak and won for just the third time in their last eight games. 
San Antonio improved to 23-3 against Minnesota, including 11 straight at home. 
"They didn't fold the tents tonight," Elliott said. "They just kept coming after us. We are going to have to overcome some of the things we are going through now to become the cal­iber of team we want to be." 
Isaiah Rider scored 23 points and Rooks and Doug West had 18 points each for the Timberwolves. Christian Laettner added 10 points. 
Minnesota used a 10-4 run to open the third quarter to close within 53-50 on Howard Eisley's two free throws with 
8:23 left. 

But the Timberwolves turned it over nine times in the third quarter and the Spurs used an 8-0 run to pull away to a 70-58 lead at the end of the third quarter. 
Del Negro was 7-of-7 from the field in the first half as the Spurs had a 49-40 lead at half­time. 
Minnesota never led after Elliott converted a layup with 
9:28 left in the opening quarter.

All of a sudden, a tentative club that had lost its confidence is showing signs of being the same team that terrorized op­ponents with their ball-hawking defense. The Sonics had 13 steals against the Pacers, four by Payton, and blocked a sea­son-high nine shots.

Seattle's other all-star, Shawn Kemp, agreed that the Sonics' 27-21 lead after the first quar­ter was the game's turning point. 
"Good first quarters seem to be the key for us," Kemp said after his 16-point, 13-rebound effort. "When we get out in front early, opponents have to adjust to us instead of the other way around." 
If Payton and Kemp play well, so do the Sonics, coach George Karl said.

in time to squelch the rally. 

8-ball 

'Barna odd team out of top slot 
By PAUL NEWBERRY AP Sports Writer 
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. 

Two years ago, everything worked out fine for Alabama under the bowl coalition. The Crimson Tide kept on winning and wound up with the national championship. 
This season, the path to No. 1 isn't so clear. Alabama could finish 13-0 again and not even share the title. 
A playoff system would give third-ranked Alabama a chance to render the polls meaningless, settle all the debate on the field. But the idea doesn't have much support around Tuscaloosa. 
"It's too time consuming," of­fensive tackle Kareem McNeal said. "It's kind of confusing the way it's set up now, but I wouldn't want a playoff because of the time it takes away from school. It's already hard enough to keep up in school and a playoff would just make it that much harder." 
"The season is long enough as it is," agreed defensive tackle Shannon Brown, "especially at this time of year when we all have finals coming up. People tend to forget the whole pur­pose of what we're here for, and that's to get an education." 
There are still two games to go before Alabama (11-0) has to concern itself with the rank­ings. The Tide meets No. 6 Florida in the Southeastern Conference championship game on Saturday, with the winner heading to the Sugar Bowl to meet seventh-ranked Florida State. 
Coach Gene Stallings and his players believe they can sway enough pollsters to their side by winning those two games, and they may have a point con­sidering their last two victories were over No. 9 Auburn (the Tigers' only loss in the last two seasons) and 16th-ranked Mississippi State. 
Neither top-ranked Nebraska (12-0) nor No.2 Penn State (11­
0) has to run that kind of sea­son-ending gauntlet. 
"If we go undefeated, we'll win it," offensive guard Jon Stevenson said confidently. 
Still, Alabama faces the longest odds of the three major contenders for No. 1. Nebraska and Penn State have only their bowl games remaining, and they already have all but one first-place vote. 
"You'll never know what you could have done unless you play the best," safety Willie Gaston said. "Everyone feels Nebraska and Penn State are a lot better than us. But till we play each other, we'll never know. It's just a matter of who they want to have it." 
Gaston would prefer the teams settle things themselves.

And though he may be in the minority, he doesn't buy the argument that a playoff would put too many additional de­mands on the players. 
"I wouldn't have a problem with it," he said. "We already play 13 games. What's one more? If someone is blessed enough to go on to the next level (NFL), you're going to play 16 anyway. Why not prepare yourself for it?" 
Stallings feels differently. 
"Somewhere along the line, you've got to say they play enough games," he said. "If two or three teams finish unde­feated, you've got to vote for somebody. There's nothing wrong with a couple of teams tying for it. I see nothing wrong with having two or three unde­feated teams." 
Brown and quarterback Jay Barker would like to see a dif­ferent version of the current system, something along the lines of the bowl alliance that goes into effect next year but incorporating all of the teams -even those from the Big 10 and Pac-10. 
"Out of our conference, the top bowl is the Sugar Bowl," Brown noted. "Why couldn't it be the Rose Bowl if that gave us the chance to play for the na­tional title against somebody else? I don't know why it's so set in stone."

the Irish would be in con­tention for a bid if Florida won because Sugar Bowl officials were weary of a rematch between the Seminoles and the Gators. But a 31-31 tie between the two teams last Saturday left the possibility open. 
It appeared the Cotton Bowl was a likely destination for the Irish after the 17-17 tie with the Trojans. But the Fiesta Bowl had first choice according to coalition rules because the Buffaloes a higher ranking than Texas Tech, who would have been Notre Dame's op­ponent in Dallas. 
The Irish will receive $3 mil­lion for appearing in the Fiesta Bowl which will be televised by NBC.

from sophomores Matt Gotsch and Marcus Young helped ofT­set a 26-point torrent from Valpo guard David Redmon. 
Crusaders' freshman Bryce Drew, last year's Indiana Mr. Basketball who was heavily recruited by Notre Dame, scored 14 points in his college debut. But a solid defensive effort from Justice kept him from doing more damage. 
"Justice can channel you where he wants you to go," Drew said. 
Notre Dame opened a 20­point lead midway through the second half, but Redmon drained four 3-pointers in the final 11 minutes to keep the game close. 
"We didn't plan (to shoot more 3-pointers) at halftime, but when we got down we started calling specific plays to set up 3-pointers," Redmon said. "I hit a couple and they kept coming back to me." 
Redmon's hot hand, coupled with some ragged Irish play, kept Valparaiso coming back. 

"It was ragged but interest­ing," MacLeod said. 
It gets more interesting tonight when 1-2 Indiana visits the Joyce Center for an 8 p.m. tipoff. 
Despite their early-season struggles at the Maui Classic, which included losses to Utah and Arizona State, the Hoosiers represent an important mea­suring stick for the Irish. 
If Notre Dame competes well against Indiana, it will inject confidence that could carry them to a better season than expected. 
The Hoosiers' trademark suf­focating defense sucked the life out of the Irish last year and sent them reeling to one of their worst seasons in recent memory. 
A talented freshman class compliments veterans Alan Henderson and Brian Evans. But Notre Dame offers an improved, if inexperienced, lineup that craves this kind of test. 
"You dream about games like that," Garrity said. "A packed house, a team like Indiana. It should be a lot of fun."

'The Genius' retires from Stanford 
Steelers dominate AFC 
By ROB GLOSTER 
Associated Press 
STANFORD, Calif. 
Bill Walsh, who returned to Stanford "to find my bliss" after coaching the San Francisco 49ers to three Super Bowl titles, resigned Monday after two straight losing sea­sons. 
Walsh, who had two years remaining on a five-year con­tract, will become a special assistant to Stanford athletic director Ted Leland. 
The departure of Walsh, who turns 63 Wednesday, had been rumored in recent weeks. lie often seemed distracted this season, and repeatedly had trouble remembering the names of his players and opponents' players during his news conferences. 
"I just felt that this was an appropriate time to move to another stage of my life," Walsh said. "Anyone who looks at my chronological age can understand that. I love football and have thrived on it. But the job of head coach is an exhausting job, and at this stage in my life it's time for 
somebody else to do it." 
Leland said Walsh now will 
focus on fundraising, as well 
as creation of a coaching 
development program and a 
sports research institute at 
Stanford. But Walsh said he'll 
also be available to advise his 
successor. 
Leland, an assistant coach 
under Walsh at Stanford in the 
late 1970s, said a nationwide 
search for a new coach 
already has begun. Terry 
Shea, the current offensive 
coordinator, is expected to be 
among the candidates. 
Walsh returned to Stanford 
three seasons ago after com­
piling a 102-63-1 record in 10 
years as coach of the 49ers, 
including Super Bowl crowns 
in 1981, 1984 and 1988. He 
was elected to the Pro Football 
Hall of Fame in 1993. 
He spent three years as a pro 
football analyst for NBC, 
through the end of the 1991 
season, before deciding to 
return to coaching. 
Walsh, whose first head -coaching job was at Stanford 
in 1977-78, when he led the 
team to consecutive bowl vic­
tories, led the Cardinal to a 
10-3 record and a win over 
Penn State in the Blockbuster 
Bowl in his first year back at

Notre Dame needed just one more win to reach the lowest standard in sports. Seven vic­tories and this all would have been a moot point. 
But at 6-4-1, unranked Notre Dame's automatic bid to a ma­jor bowl was amputated. Without a leg to stand on, the Irish used their national appeal as a crutch to hobble into a major bowl. 
How refreshing it would have been if Notre Dame officials had respectfully declined the Fiesta Bowl's offer and urged the game's representatives to invite one of the many more de­serving teams. 
well worth the trouble. 
Irish coach Lou Holtz had a lot to say last season about set­tling things on the field, logic that seemed to disappear Monday as he justified the deci­sion to accept the Fiesta Bowl bid. 
Holtz insisted that his team deserves this opportunity, de­spite the fact that teams like Michigan, Boston College and Brigham Young, just to name a few more, are playing in bowls that Notre Dame would never consider gracing with its pres­ence. 
"I am not embarassed about taking this team to the Fiesta Bowl," Holtz said. 
He should be.

.INTERHALL fOOTBALL 

Offenses control in women's interhall all-star battle 
By MICHAEL DAY Sports Writer 
Sometimes football defies all logic. 
The 1994 women's interhall season was the year of the dominating defenses. Opposing offenses were forced to take a backseat, as points were hard to come by and shutouts were seen with uncanny regularity throughout the year. 
However, defense was a miss­ing element in last Tuesday's interhall all-star game, as the Gold team outslugged their Blue counterparts 20-18 in a battle of two suddenly offensive heavyweights. 
It became obvious from the start that this was not going to be another low scoring, defense dominated grudge match. 
On the first play from scrim­mage, Gold quarterback Julie Byrd threw a perfect strike to wideout Ann Jackobice, and Jackobice tore through the Blue secondary for a 60-yard touch­down and a 6-0 lead. Gold stretched the lead to 7-0, as Byrd added the conversion on a quarterback keeper. 
Not to be outdone, the Blue squad engineered a five play, 60-yard drive on their first pos­session of the evening. Quarterback Marce McNeill completed all three of her pass­es on the drive before tailback Sara Donnelly capped it off with a 12-yard touchdown run. Blue failed to convert on the point-after attempt, and it would cost them in the end. 
After losing the ball on downs on their second possession, Gold put together a pair of touchdown drives right before the half to bury the Blue squad in a hole that would prove to be too deep to recover from. 
Gold, consisting of players from Badin, Lyons, Pangborn, Howard, Walsh, B.P., and Cavanaugh, moved the ball 48 yards on seven plays on the first of the two scoring oppor­tunities. 
Byrd, one of the heroes in Lyons' championship season, once again put the exclamation point on the drive with a 13­yard touchdown pass to receiv­er Jill Satanek. On the ensuing conversion. running back Trish Sorenson scampered five yards to raise Gold's lead to 14-6. 
Gold wasn't through yet. Mter M.T. Kraft found Satanek open for 30 yards, Jackobice added her second touchdown of the game on a nine-yard run to give Gold a 20-6 advantage. Although they failed to add the conversion, Gold took the 14 point lead into intermission. 

"We executed really well in the first half," said Byrd. I was surprised we could move the ball as well as we were able to in the first half." 
However, the blue team came to life in the second half, and the Gold offense closed up shop after a dominating 30 minutes of football. Blue capped two scoring drives with touchdown passes from McNeill to Donnelly and wideout Michelle Drury. 
"We came together in the sec­ond half," said McNeill. "We were kind of disorganized on both sides of the ball in the first half, but I thought we really improved as the game went 
on." 

After forcing a Gold punt, Blue took over on their own 40­yard line with just over three minutes remaining. However, Gold linebacker Shelly Dillenburger dashed Blue's hopes and secured the victory for Gold by intercepting a McNeill pass in the final minute. 
Both teams enjoyed the op­portunity to compete in the all­star game and are confident that the game will become a tradition in interhall football. 
"It was definitely a great idea," said Byrd. "I really en­joyed it, and it was a great way to meet the best players from the different teams." 
Indeed, the stars were out in full force on Tuesday night at Loftus field. In the end, the Gold team sparkled just a little brighter. 
Blue squad unable to handle Gold's second half comeback in men's game 
By JOE VILLINSKI Sports Writer 

On the Tuesday night before Thanksgiving, after a good por­tion of the student body had already dispersed, some of in­terhall's best stuck around to provide one of the best games of the season. 
From the opening ceremonies involving the color guard, to WNDU sportscaster Chuck Freeby engineering a short touchdown drive, to a great comeback by the Gold squad, the first ever interhall all-star game proved to be a success. 
"I just thought it was a great interhall game," Gold running back Mike Norbut said. 
What made the game even better for Norbut and the rest of the Gold all-stars were the sixteen unanswered points they scored in the fourth quarter as they rallied to defeat the Blue squad 16-12 at Loftus. 
Following a fumble recovery by Sorin's Alex Scheidler at the blue 37-yard line, a fellow Screaming Otter, Jeff Farragher, found Fisher's Dan McGinty for a first down. Alumni's Matt Mammolenti fol­lowed with a 15-yard run to the Blue 7 -yard line. 
"We started double-teaming the nose guard which gave us some room to run up the mid­dle," Gold head coach Chuck Hurley said. 
Two plays later, Norbut scored the game-winner with 
3:10 left as he took the hand-off and followed Matt Bundick's block into the end zone for the score. 
"The team hung together well as a unit throughout the game," Gold assistant coach Joe Yonto said. 
Happy Birthday Katie! 

Gold's first score was set up as Fisher's Mike Carroll caught a 25-yard pass from Farragher on the sidelines for their second first down in a row. After a pass interference call, Bundick scored on a hand-off to cut the score to 12-8 with 8:00 left. 
"We kept working hard and started to find a nice rhythm," Farragher said. 
"The penalties were the biggest thing that hurt us," Blue head coach Tony Yelovich said. "They managed to hurt our rhythm." 
The first half was just the op­posite as the Blue all-stars dominated from the outset. Keenan's Colin Rittgers made two of his five first-half catches from Flanner's Scott Lupo on the second drive of the half to key the first score. From the 3­yard line, Rittgers' teammate Ben Mitchell scored up the mid­dle to give the Blue an early 6-0 advantage. 
"We executed well the entire first half," Yelovich stated. 

With 1:12 left in the half, an­other Knight, Dan Kraft, inter­cepted a Chad Harrison pass and returned it 30 yards to give the Blue a 12-0 lead at half­time. Another noteworthy performance was made by Dave Bozanich, who had three interceptions in the first half. 
"We had too many defensive breakdowns in the second half," Off-Campus's George Reider said. 
In between the first and sec­ond quarters, Freeby, who donned Joe Montana's No. 16 for his brief appearance at quarterback, managed to lead the Blue team to a touchdown from the 10-yard line in four plays. Facing a fourth and five, Freeby hit Mitchell for the score to complete his challenge. 
"There wasn't a glitch in the whole game," Commissioner Marty Ogren said. "Everyone pulled together and it was spec­tacular."

Despite record, Irish Fiesta Bowl bound 
Holtz not overly excited about facing Colorado 
By GEORGE DOHRMANN 
Spons Ediwr 
As crazy as it may sound, especially with Saturday's humbling, stumbling and somewhat disgusting tie to USC, the Notre Dame football team is bowl bound. 
The Irish (6-4-1) were extended a bid yesterday to play in the Fiesta Bowl on January 2 against the fifth­ranked Colorado Buffaloes in Tempe, Ariz. it was announced at a press conference in the Joyce ACC. 
Fiesta Bowl officials were part of a conference call with Notre Dame Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal and bowl coalition representatives when the decision was made to select the Irish over teams such as North Carolina. Arizona and Virginia Tech. 
"The runners-up from the Big East and the Atlantic Coast Conference had really beat themselves up a bit. 

(and Notre Dame) seemed to have everyone back and we just thought they were the best team we had to play Colorado," said Shawn Schoeffier, spokesman for the Fiesta Bowl. 
For whatever reason, Irish coach Lou Holtz was happy with the invita­tion. 
"We are excited about the op­portunity to go to Tempe and to the Fiesta Bowl and to play a great team like Colorado," Holtz said. 
Holtz was made aware of the Fiesta Bowl's invitation late Sunday evening. He told his team of their destination Monday afternoon. "I don't know if they were excited. None of the players have been to Arizona for a bowl and it is a great opportunity for them." 
The fifth-ranked Buffaloes will not only feature likely Reisman Trophy winner Rashaan Salaam and his 2, 046 yards on the season, but the game will mark the final appearance of long-time Colorado coach Bill McCartney who surprisingly resigned last week. 
"They will be playing with a lot of emotion," Holtz said, "and with play­ers like Salaam, (quarterback) Kordell Stewart and (receiver) Michael Westbrook they are an explosive team." 
Despite their record, Holtz feels his Irish deserved the chance to play in a Jan. 2 bowl. ''I'm not embar­rassed," Holtz said. "I think by the way we played the last few games of the season we showed that we can play with any team in the country." 
There is sure to be some backlash from the press concerning Notre Dame's place in one of the tier one bowls. "We will just have to wait and see how the game turns out. I think we deserved it, but we'll have to see. 
''I'm excited, but I don't think you can get too excited about playing a team like Colorado. They have the potential to embarrass us." 
Notre Dame's bowl destination depended on the move of the Sugar Bowl who have apparently decided to match Florida State against the winner of the SEC Championship game next weekend. Either Florida or Alabama will face the Seminoles in New Orleans. It was thought that
