Egyptians prepare for summit 
CAIRO, Egypt [AP] -Egyptian officials yesterday readied a site and discussed the makeup of their delegation to President Anwar Sadat's upcoming Middle East summit. Arab nations who oppose his conciliation with Israel appear­ed to be splitting over two proposed anti-Sadat meetings. 
Also yesterday, the United Na­tions accepted Sadat's invitation to be represented at Cairo, and Secretary-General Kurt W aldheim called for still another Mideast meeting, to be held in about two weeks either at U.N. headquarters in New York or another neutral site. 
Egypt is trying to decide the number and rank of its representa­tives to its own summit, which Sadat said could begin as early as Saturday. The meeting will be held in the historic Mena House hotel, in the shadow of the pyramids. Officials were seen checking the building for security hazards yes­terday. 
So far, Egypt, Israel, the United States, and a U.N. representative will take part in the meeting. 
Israel plans to send sub cabinet officials to Cairo. The United States -which formally accepted the invitation yesterday -may send an undersecretary or assistant sec­retary of state and the United Nations will delegate Gen. Ensio Siilasvuo, the Finnish coordinator of U.N. peacekeeping operations in the Middle East. 
Egypt also invited the Soviet Union, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and the Palestinians, to prepare for a full-scale peace conference at Gene­va. Waldheim said, 'all those invited to the Cairo meeting'' would be asked to the U.N. talks, also designed to make progress towards Geneva. 
Lebanon said it wanted to stay neutral. Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization denounced the talks and declared they would not attend, but have yet to commu­nicate this refusal officially to the Egyptians. 
Meanwhile, Iraq said it had sent emissaries yesterday to the radical Arab regimes in Libya, Algeria and South Yemen, inviting them to a summit sometime next week in Baghdad. Libya has called a similar conference to begin tomorrow in Tripoli, and Iraq has not said whether it will attend. 
The Iraqi announcement over · government Radio Baghdad omitt­ed mention of Syria. With Egypt working hard for a peaceful settle­ment with Israel, Syria is the only one of the three main Israeli adversaries blocking resumption of full-scale peace talks. The other, Jordan, has praised Sadat's visit to Jerusalem Nov. 19-21. 
Iraq artd Syria are bitter rivals, and the Baghdad anti-Sadat meet­ing threatens to open another rivalry -between Iraq and Libya, both of whom see themselves as leaders of the Arab nations reject­ing a peaceful settlement with Israel. 
Some observers believe this dis­unity could force Syrian President Hafez Assad into the Egyptian president's peace camp. Assad has neither ruled out nor insisted upon a peaceful settlement but has held to a harder rhetorical line that Sadat. 
Despite earlier Syrian protesta­tions that Egypt had broken Arab unity, Assad told reporters Monday there can be "no divorce between brother Arab countries." He recognized Sadat as still the "pres­

ND-SMC Right to :Life sponsors St. Nick party 
The Notre Dame-St. Mary's Right to Life chapter is helping sponsor the St. Nicholas Day party to be held after the lighting of the University Christmas Tree on Dec­ember 6 at 7 p.m. in front of LaFortune. The party, to which all the campus children from Notre Dame and St. Mary's are invited, will be held in LaFortune Ballroom immediately after the tr_ee-Iighting. 
"We· are helping to underwrite the costs of this event, along with the Student Government," stated Rick LaSalvia, president of Right to Life, ''because Christmas and St. Nicholas affirm the values that Right to Life believes in. Saint Nicholas --Santa Claus --is the patron saint of all children. His legends say that he loved children very much, and a love for children is one of the premises on which Right to Life is founded.'' 
"The party will be fairly expen­sive," LaSalvia said. "Father Grif-[ fm, The University Chaplain, who is arranging the party, has invited the Band, ·the Glee Oub, the ND-SMC children's theater, Jules Thompson, campus pianist and impressionist, and even a magician, to entertain the children. The cookies and the candy canes alone will make a small mountain of goodies. In addition, Sapta Oaus. will be there with surprises in his 
Christmas sack. 
"Right to Life joins with Father Griffin in inviting the urchins and moppets of Notre Dame and St. Mary's to attend this wonderful evening with St. Nick," LaSalvia said, "but it would help if you could tell us if you are coming, so there will be enough of everything to go around, including popcorn and apples, doughnuts and hot chocolate." 
"We may be broke when this party is over," LaSalvia said, "but we want the campus to see --we want to see for ourselves --'bow beautiful children, in their hDliday happiness, can be."

Farley incident starts false rumors 

by Mike Kenahan Staff Reporter 

Rumors concerning an intruder entering Farley Hall during Thanksgiving break and residents receiving numerous "prank" phone calls are false according to Sr. Jean Lenz, Farley rectress. 
"There wasn't an intruder over the break," affirmed Lenz. She also added that, 'nobody has come to me saying they've received all kinds of phone calls." 
Jean Gorman, assistant rectress, confirmed the falsity of the rumors by saying, "I was on duty all during break and we had no intruder in the dorm." Gorman ' also noted that, ''there was a ph~ne call to a student, but it was not a prank call. It was an aggravating

call, but I don't think necessarily that 'prank' is the right word." 
Lenz and Gorman admitted, however, that an "incident" occur­ed over break in which someone was reported as having been outside the windows in the back of the dorm. The Farley Hall resident who reported the incident said that, "I had thought somebody might have been trying to get into my window." 
The resident, stated that she spotted a male, who was wearing glasses and had dark hair, outside of her window last Friday night at about 12:30 a.m. She explained that, "I really couldn't see him too well because it was dark and he had a jacket on and he was kind of crouched down." 
The resident mentioned she noti­fied Farley's security guard, Betty Toombs, right away and that Toombs called Notre Dame Secur­ity. 
''It guess they sent somebody over to check it out then," she said. 
''A man from Notre Dame Security was over yesterday morning to show me pictures and to ask questions," she added. The resi­dent also commented that she did not think the man she saw was the same as the one who was pictured in the Observer as the recent rap·e suspect. 
Due to the rumors which have been circulating around Farley and to the "perverted" intruder inci­dent that occurred on the Saturday before break, the Resident Assist­ants of Farley are holding section meetings to discuss security within the dorm. 
Chris Datzman, third floor RA in Farley, pointed out that, "we had our staff meeting last week and then yesterday, today and tomor­row we're trying to have meetings with the sections and inform them of what we discussed to make them aware of our little security tips and changes." 
According to Lenz, "the RA's meetings with their sections are just 
students were and to again reiter­ate how much better security can be enforced right in the hall. Before we blame Security for what it didn't do, I think we have to blame ourselves for what we didn't do." 
Gorman stated, ''The main thing that we're encouraging the women to do is to lock their room doors at night and not to let anyone in the dorm." She suggested the resi­dents "make the person who wants to get in go through the telephone system and call up to the room that they want to go to and have that particular individual come down and get them. That's the basic thing.'' 
Datzman noted that one of the changes in security will be the extension of the hall lighting period throughout the dorm. "They're keeping the lights on now after parietals," she said. The RA also stated that, "We're going to lock the door by the dining hall at midnight. It used to be open until two o'clock, but we're going to start getting that closed." 
Gorman also mentioned that, "we're considering deactivating the detex on our north door because that door is not seen by the security guard." "But," she add­ed, "that's under discussion; there's nothing final on that." 
Gorman explained that by shutt­ing off the detex to the door, "you can still go out the door, because it

is a fire door, but you can't come in with the detex card." 
Datzman stressed that hall resi­dents were not overly concerned. She stated, "It's not like we're living in fear, but its just that we're trying to be a little more careful." 
Lenz agreed by saying that, "everybody here is just a little more concerned about the whole procedure and would probably think twice before they'd let any­one in." 
Peggy McGuire, a resident of Farley, noted that, "I think people had a real sense of security before and now they realize that that was really false, that they really have to be aware of things that could happen and be sure and lock their doors at night and take other precautions as well." 
Responding to the suggested possibility that the rapist, the intruder, and the "peeping tom" could have been the same person, Gorman maintained that, "it's possible, but who knows. It'd be nice if it was the same guy doing all this stuff and they caught him."

Chasing a ·dream 
This is the last of a 3-pan series on the 
Midwest Blues Festival. 
About four years ago, I was pondering 
my future: music or medicine? I ultimately 
chose meither. But the lure of a musician's 
life was very convincing at 17. 
"Don't do it," warned a friend, two 
years out of music school. "You're always 
on the road ... never makin' enough money. 
And you're always frustrated, 'cuz even if 
you do make it, you fizzle out after a while. 
Only the 'greats' last forever. You want 
your whole life to be chasin' somethin' 
you'll probably never get?" 
I used to hate that guy for shattering a 
dream. But I grew to respect him as I 
learned from other musicians how true his 
words could be. 
Then I ran into a few people at the 
Midwest Blues Festival: Edith Wilson, 
Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee, Big Joe 
Duskin, Muddy Waters. Some had been 
playing professionally since 1930 or before, 
starting out on the road at 14 and 15 years 
old. And they're still getting the same 
excitement out of performing as they did 40 
years ago. 
I couldn't help but wonder why these artists continue playing music that has always been overshadowed by the styles it gave birth to; why 62-year-old Muddy Waters swears, "If I had to do it over again, I'd still play the blues;" or why Edith Wilson, in her seventies, ailing, and with heart surgery two weeks away, pushes herself onstage to sing to a Stepan Center crowd? _ 
Brownie McGhee knew the answer. 
"It's the blues, man. You love it because 
it's your life. It's part of your soul. It's like 
being in love with a bad woman: no matter when;she sneaks off to, you'll follow." 
Many people have followed the blues. Take Edith Wilson, for example. At 13 she was sneaking out of her house in Louisville, Ky., to sing in local shows. The next year, she met -pianist Danny Wilson, married him, and 1en tor audiences in Chicago and Milwaukee. Eventually, she made her way to New York City, wher writer/producer Perry Bradford placed her in Mamie Smith's role in "Put And Take." 
Edith signed with Columbia Records, and in 1921 made a recording with Johnny Dunn's Jazz Hounds. The song, "Nervous Blues," was the second recording made by a black woman. 
After two European tours, Edith took to the stage. In the 1930's, she appeared in Fats Waller's "Hot Chocolates," in which Edith, Fats, and Louis Armstrong were billed as "One Thousand Pounds of Harmony." She also appeared on stage with Bill "Bojangles" Robinson in "Mem­phis Bound." 
Before World War II, Edith moved to California to pursuevaudeville,cabaret, and films. Her most significant film rule was with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in "To Have and Have Not." 
Edith made a substantial mark in radio as well. She was a member of the "Amos & Andy" cast, playing Kingfish's mother. In 1948, she was chosen by the Quaker Oats Company to be the radio voice of Aunt Jemima (hence her nickname: "The Origi­nal Aunt Jemima"). In this role, Edith became involved with advertising, regular spots on the Gay Moore Show, and numerous charity projects. Edith soon recruited a number of "Aunt Jemimas" to fill the countless number of appearances she could not handle alone. 
In 1966, Edith returned to singing, her first Jove. She teamed up with Little Brother Mongomery, a ragtime/country blues/boogie-woogie piano player whose recording history dates to 1929. 
I met Edith backstage at the MBF and asked her, "Do you still like singing and performing after all this time?" 
"Oh, yes!" she replied, smiling. "The people are always so nice. They always seem to like Brother and me, I guess... I just love to sing." 
I then asked about her surgery: "Is it a good idea for you to be performing right now?" 
"Well, I am a little scared," admitted Edith. "But that's not going to stop me from singing tonight. And the doctor told me I'd be back on my feet in no time!" 
"Can't let things getcha down," added Brownie McGhee. "Ya gotta keep thinkin' positive, lookin' at the good things. That's the way to get through life -whatever you're doin'." 
Brownie has kept that attitude through­out his career. Although afflicted with polio at age 4. he was determined to play the blues and make a name for himself. He 
by Frank Laurino 

taught himself piano at a young age, and occasionally he would sneak into a nearby Baptist church and play blues numbers on the organ when nobody was around. 
Then Brownie's father taught him guitar. He quickly mastered it and formed many groups, playing schools and Smokey Mountain summer resorts. On day he quit school, strapped his guitar to his back, and hit the road. 
Playing in carnivals, medicine shows, travelling minstrels shows, "jook joints," and "hole-in-the-wall" taverns, Brownie found himself working with some of the blues legends: Lonnie Johnson, Blind Boy Fuller, and "Huddie" Leadbetter, better known as "Leadbelly". In 1949, Sonny Terry asked Brownie to perform at the Leadbelly Memorial Concert in New York City the following year. 
Sonny had been introduced to the New York audience in 1938 when he joined Albert Ammons, Meade Lux Lewis, Pete Johnson, and the Count Basie Orchestra in the famous Carnegie Hall "Spirituals To Swing" Concert. 
Sonny is another man of positive thought. He lost his eyesight in two separate childhood accidents. Freed from farm chores, he took up the harmonica. 
"My dad, he said, 'Play that harmonica, boy. It'll make you a living someday,"' remembered Sonny. "So I'd practice and practice. I wanted to sound like the old freight trains, chuggin' away and blowin' the whistle." 
Word spread around Sonny's Durham, 

N.C. home that he was an accomplished harp player. He soon worked with the legendary Leadbelly and blues greats Blind Boy Fuller and Rev. Gary Davis. In the 1940's, Sonny played with Alec Stewart and Pete Seeger. 
After the Leadbelly Memorial Concert, Sonny and Brownie toured the United States, Europe, and Austrailia, and then played with Woodie Guthrie on a few recordings. On Broadway, they appeared in "Finian's Rainbow," "Simply Heaven­ly," and "Cat On A Hot Tin Roof." Their television performances include NBC's "Midnight Special" and ABC's "In Concert." Sonny and Brownie's most recent recording includes numbers with John Hammond, Eddie Greene, Sugarcane Harris, John Mayall, and Arlo Guthrie. 

Thirty-eight years and 70-odd albums later, Sonny and Brownie performed at Stepan Center. Seeing the duo on stage, playing as they have for years, makes one recall the personal conflicts which de­stroyed the Beatles after almost a decade, or Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young after only a few years. What has kept these two artist together for so long? 
Surprisingly, it's not friendship. Despite 
the duo's image of having a close 
partnership, despite Brownie's song "Me 
And Sunny" ("We been friends for a great 
long time"), the two musicians have a 
strained personal relationship. They travel 
separately and sleep in separate rooms. 

On stage, there is little interaction between 
them. 

"I don't get into Brownie's affairs," said 
Sonny at the MBF. "We keep to 
ourselves." 

What makes thes performers put aside years of personal differences every time they step on the stage? 
Everybody's got 


the blues I 
It's a feelin' . 
"It's the blues," said Brownie. "You do anything for the blues. Man, everybody's got the blues; they can relate to it. That's why people listen to it today, and people like me play it. The blues is everywhere; 
it'II live forever.'' 

I suspiciously asked, "You mean all hell 
could break loose, and just because you're 
playin' the .blues, everything's alright?" 

Brownie's eyes opened wide. "Of 
course my man, don't ya see? Listen, you 
don't have to have a woman leave you, or 
be drunk and broke and in the gutter to 
have the blues! Everybody's got the blues! 
It's a feelin'. And when you hear it, or play 
it, you forget all.about·the bad things goin' 
down. You feel good. You feel happy. 


That's why I play the blues: I'm a happy guitar player!'' 
Muddy Waters is a happy guitar player too. "I wanted to do three things when I was a kid,"· said Muddy. "Play baseball, be a preacher, or play music. I've been singin' the blues all my life, and I ain't never regretted a minute of it." 
McKinley Morganfield was born in 1915 in Rolling Fork, Mississippi. By the time he was 13, Muddy was playing harmonica for SO cents a night (plus a fish sandwich and a half pint of moonshine). Four years later, Muddy took up guitar, mimicking the bottleneck slide styles of Robert Johnson and Eddie "Son" House. Ten more years of hard work got him $30 a night (7 p.m. to 7 a.m.) plus $10 for sidemen. 
In the early 40's, Muddy saw that a change in the blues was necessary. Country blues, as it existed, was usually an acoustic, solo art form. That style was not in keeping with the post-war .advanced urban environment. Muddy cleared the way for the blues "group" by introducing 
drums rhythm keyboards, and amplified bass and guitars. Muddy's style of blues carried the roots of rock & roll and every rock form to follow. 
The Bossman's career brought him in contact with some of the greatest blues musicians: Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Little Walter, Otis Span, Big Walter Horton, James Cotton, and Johnny Winter. His associates span the musical world: B.B. King, The Rolling Stones, members of the former Allman Brothers Band, Charlie Rich, and Peter Wolf. Muddy is revered in and out of blues circles, in the United States and around the world, as the man responsible for giving the blues new life. Three decades of popular music artists owe their allegiance to the Bossman. 
Muddy's first rec"l¥iings were made for 

the Library of Congress in 1941 and 1942. 
Since then, he has recorded such legendary 
songs as "I'm Your Hoochie-Coochie 
Man" and "Trouble No More" (also 
recorded by the Allman Brothers Band), 
"Long Distance Call," "Rollin' Stone" 
(which inspired an English rock group, an 
American magazine, and a Bob Dylan 
song}, "Baby Please Don't Go," "Born In 

This Time" (from the movie, "Mandin­
go," starring James Mason, Susan 
George, and Ken Norton), and the blues 
hallmark, "Got My Mojo Working." 

I cornered Muddy backstage at the festival and asked, "What exactly-in your own words, now -is a 'mojo'?" 
"Oh, man! I can'ttell you that!" replied Muddy. I half-expected the answer. "C'mon, Muddy ... " 
"Well, I guess it's what it's all about ... you know, what keeps me goin'." 
"What does keep you going, Muddy?" 

He smiled. "Well, for one thing, a Iotta good booze and a Iotta good young women!" After a hearty laugh, he gave me a more serious, but not necessarily more exclusive answer. "There's lots of people who like to hear the blues. And I love to play. If I didn't, I wouldn't be here right now." . 
"But do you still get the same feeling out of performing?" I asked. "After SO years of travelling and one-nighters and night­clubs, and never being able to settle down ­is still the same?" 
Muddy sat up in his chair, a serious look 

on his face. "Man, the road is my home. I 
love it. I love my music. IfI had to do it all 
over again, I'd still play the blues." 
Big Joe Duskin loves his music too, _but 

he might have wanted to change a few 
things in his past. Learning the ,plano and 
falling in love with the blues ~t a young 
age, Big Joe was denied the chance•,to tour 
until recently. 
The boogie-woogie/blues piano player, 

born in Birmingham, Ala. in 1921, was the 
son of a Baptist minister "Who used to 
preach hellfire and brimstone." 
"H~ used to hate it when I·.played the blues," remembered Joe. "'Don't I ever .catch you playin' that Devil's Music' he'd always say." 

In his father's presence, Joe stuck to church hymns and service music. But when he'd practice alone at home, the neighborhood kids would gather around as he banged out the blues. Some of the kids would be lookouts, watching out for Rev. Duskin, for when he was seen coming home, Joe would quickly switch from "Boogie Woogie Blues" to· "Nearer My God To Thee." 
"One time I was really cookin' on piano," recalled Joe, "and the kids were 
. so into the music, they forgot to watch for my father. Well, all of a sudden, I looked up. There was my old man, mad as hell. All the kids took off, and there was nothing else I could do, so I started right into "Nearer My God To Thee." 
Rev. Duskin's hand was a little closer to Joe's behind than God was that night, but Joe was not discouraged. When the Duskins moved to Cincinnati, Joe started listening to the live and recorded music of jugband, bluegrass, blues, and boogie­woogie artist. He soon started playing at various local nightclubs -much to his father's dislike. A career began to blossom, and Joe played the wild blues clubs across the Ohio River in Newport, Ky. Then World War II started, and Joe was drafted. 
Surprisingly, Joe's playing was enhanced in the service. He worked 
U.S.O. shows with many bands, including those of Pete Johnson, Albert Ammons, and Meade Lux Lewis. Joe returned form Europe full of ambition to become a professional musician, but his father -then in his eighties -put a stop to it. 
"He wanted me to stop playing the blues while he was still alive, so he could have some peace," said Joe. "So I thought, 'Sure why not? He couldn't live forever.' Besides, I really did Jove the old man." 
Rev. Duskin, however, passed away at a ripe old 105. During those 20 years, Joe had taken day jobs; he was desparately out of practice. Cincinnati blues enthusiast Steve Tracy convinced Joe to make a comeback, and in the early 70's the big bluesman returned to the scene. 
"I would have liked to have had that time back," Joe admitted. "But I'm grateful now that I have the chance to tour. I love my music. Starting to tour is like 
having a dream come true.'' 

"What does your family think about your decision to leave home and persue a career in music?" I asked. 
"Well," said Joe, "to be perfectly honest, my wife can't stand my music. And the kids .don't really understand it either. But there's an unwritten rule in my· house: no one interferes with my music." 
Many blues artists Joe's age have a performing history of 30 or 40 years. But Joe, at 56, is just starting out. How will he adapt to his new life on the road? 
"Man, I'm gonna love it! he said confidently. "I like to travel, and I love to play. To me, my music is the most beautiful music in the world. It deserves to beplayed, to be spread around. There are lots ofpeople who want to hear this music, and I'll play for 'em. Yeah, I'll play for 'em, even if there's only one person in the audienceI" 
Some pe~e may call Joe Duskin a fool. I call him an amazing man. Never to give up a dream: that's amazing. 
In fact, none of these blues artists ever gave up their dreams. They're all amazing. 
Maybe my old friend's advice fit those like myself who had eyes trained on the pseudo-glamorous world of rock, or the semi-esoteric realm of jazz. But the bluesman -he's different. Where ather musicians play music, the bluesman plays his life, his desires, his dreams. He t*ys the blues.

Carter plans world trip 
Washlngton,[AP]­President Carter will become the first U.S. president to hold a wi'f-ogen "~~®ference in a Communist country when he visits Warsaw late next month, it was learned yesterday. 
Poland will be the first stop on a curtailed version of Carter's once­postponed world trip, now set to begin Dec. 29. A formal announce­ment of the journey is expected

The Synan posttlon ts not expect­ed to emerge clearer until such 
power brokers as the Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia clarify their stands. The Saudis, Egypt's chief 
bank rollers, have called cautiously 
for Arab unity. 
Sadat' s peace moves came under fire yesterday from a small Egyp­tian opposition party, the N a tiona) Progressives, who said: "halt all these rash initiatives that have divided the Arabs and have facilita­ted Israel's dream of driving a wedge into Arab solidarity." 
The party has two seats in the 360-member parliament. 

Sadat himself was at home in Ismailia yesterday telling Egypt's supreme judicial council that his visit to Israel "does not erode any Arab rights, historical or legal." 
In Jerusalem, Israel's designat­ed chief delegate to the Cairo summit -Eliah ben-Elissar, the prime minister's chief of bureau ­met with his advisers to prepare for the talks. 
In the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan River, mean­while, Arab pupils in four schools demonstrated briefly against Sa­dat's initiative. A military spokes­man said the demonstration broke up peacefully without Israeli inter­vention.

Rockne Trophy awarded to honor active halls 
by JIUI& Schutt 
The Rockne Trophy, the highest 

award offered for quality perfor• 
mance . in inter hall and intrahall 
activities, has been presented 
monthly for the past three years. 
It was initiated by the Hall 

President's Council (HPC) to pro­. mote hall activities and to recog­nize a hall for outstanding contribu­
tions to campus life. 
According to J.P. Russell, HPC 

chaiqnan, the trophy is given for 
"superb quality and excellence in 
hall ~ctivities.'' The winning hall 
hou!ks the trophy for a month after 
. I •
Its presentation. At the end of each month, every hal • submits an activity sheet to the 
HPC, which is judged by a panel of three former hall presidents. The judges operate on a rotating system: each month one or two new judges occupy seats on the panel. Halls are judged on the criteria of originality of activities, number and success of activities, and how the events served the community, campus or hall. An intrahall event is considered equal to one planned for the whole Notre Dame commu­·nity. A new addition this year is the . Rockne Trophy Certificate of hon­orable mention. This is awarded to a hall or halls which deserve recognition, but do not receive the trophy.
