Students petition for new proposal 
By MARK PANKOWSKI 
Assistant News Editor 
A petition to revise the student government constitution different­ly from the proposal being voted on today was presented at last night's Student Senate meeting. 
The petition, signed by more than I ,300 students, could be adopted if today's proposed con­stitution fails and Ombudsman validates the petition's signatures. 
The constitution proposed last night would eliminate the senate as a government body, giving most of its duties to the Hall Presidents' Council. Five senators would be re­tained, however, and would con­tinue to serve as members of the Campus Life Council. 
The latest proposed constitution could be adopted by a two-thirds vote of the student body, senate or HPC. 
The proposal originally was brought to the senate as an amend­ment to the proposed constitution on the ballot today by former Judicial Council member Laura McKnight. 
If the proposal had been ac­cepted by the senate, today's ballot may have been changed to reflect the amendments, according to Stu­dent Senator K.C. Culum, speak­ing after last night's meeting. The proposal also could have been taken off the ballot and sent to the HPC for adoption, he said. 
During the meeting, however, Freshman Advisory Council Presi­dent Patrick Cook pointed out that the petition states that if adopted, last night's proposed constitution would replace the existing con­stitution, and not the one being voted on today. 
Thus, if the proposed con­stitution on the ballot today is adopted, last night's proposal would be invalidated because it amends the existing constitution, which would have been replaced by the vote to adopt the new con­stitution. 
The proposal also could be in­validated if Ombudsman voids some of the petition's 1,307 signatures, a figure which represents 18 percent of the undergraduate student body, accor­ding to Student Activities Board Manager Lee Broussard. 
Only 15 percent is required to propose an amendment under the current constitution. Although the proposal brought by McKnight would keep this requirement, other procedures for amending the con­stitution would be changed.

In Brief 
The Saint Mary's freshman who had given birth to a stillborn baby in LeMans Hall early Friday is expected to be released from Memorial Hospital later this week, according to St. Joseph County Coroner Louis Grwinski. "I saw her yesterday and she was still in a state of shock," Grwinski said. "This was quite traumatic for her. . . she's still suffering from psychological shock." The infant's body was found in the dormitory bathroom, but Grwinski said he had spoken with the county prosecutor and that no charges would be filed against the mother of the child. ­

Saint Mary's must develop new growth in Hickey era 

With the appointmeilt of William Hickey as the ninth president at Saint Mary's, it is conceivable to view the transition as the ending of one era of growth and the beginning of another era for the College. 
Unde~former President John Duggan, Saint Mary's saw .the building of a $7 million library, and tne :u million Angela Athletic Facility. An additional $1.3 
million was spent renovating the Alumnae Centennial Library into the Haggar College Center, and last but not least, the endowment was raised from $3 million to $6 million -the largest among Catholic women's colleges. 
Duggan's tenure saw tremendous financial growth for the College. Alumnae contributions and other donations made the renovations and building con­struction possible. EXCEL: The Fund for Saint Mary's college, begun last year, helped to finance the renovations and addition to the Science Hall, now nearing completion. A phone-mail room, installed in the Haggar Center and staffed mostly by students, in­sures that alumnae donations keep coming in. 
It seems safe to say that the College is financially solvent. 
Now it is time for a new type of growth at Saint Mary's. With the College's financial stability, the time is right for other concerns to be addressed. 
Two of these concerns were posed to Hickey during the press conference Friday morning, announcing his appointment. The first, minority enrollment, did not seem to meet with an enthusiastic response from the College's new president. According to Hickey, although they are now "recruiting highly" in minority high schools, Saint Mary's has trouble attracting minorities when the students discover how few minority professors and students are currently at the College. 
Hickey also said the College has ''to feel it's impor­tant to have minority students and then provide sup­port services for them." 
This answer seems rather disturbing for advocates of higher minority enrollment at the school. Hopeful­ly the College has already determined that it certainly is important to diversify the student body, and they won't let excuses like few current minorities on cam­pus stop their efforts at recruitment. 
Saint Mary's will only attract minorities if it wants to do so, and that does not include offering specific "Support services." However, the administration's at­titude at this time seems hesitant and a bit unwilling to put forth the effort needed for effective minority recruitment. 

Another issue that Hickey addressed during the press conference was divestment, specifically Saint Mary's divestment from current holdings in South Africa. Hickey pointed out that divestment would not be that financially significant, since a small amount of Saint Mary's investments are in South Africa. Hickey said the investment committee of the Board of Regents would take up the question of divestment dur­ing its spring meeting in April. 
An important consideration for that committee should be the approval of a resolution last Tuesday by Saint Mary's Faculty Assembly. The resolution pro­posed divestment by the College and passed by an oral vote of the assembly. 
This is a significant statement by a major con­stituent of the College community. The Board of Regents should not ignore the determination of the Assembly that divestment is an important and wor­thwhile step for the College to consider. 
While officials can continue to debate whether divestment is the appropriate step for Saint Mary's to take right now, apartheid continues to plague the blacks of South Africa. More delay by institutions such as Saint Mary's will only mean inaction while the number of persecuted and murdered blacks grows. 
These two issues of minority enrollment and divest­ment certainly are not foreign to each other. Saint Mary's has been a leader at educating students on such issues, as well as concentrating on student needs and concerns. 
Now, at a time of stability, it is time for the college to extend that concern outside the community. Minority students would add to, and diversify the stu­dent body. Divestment would show the College places a high priority on the quality of life -within and far from campus. 
These issues are important ones that can extend beyond campus, and ones whose time has come for the College. They are also issues that will undoubtedly become prevalent early in the administration of Saint Mary's new president.

Dugan poems highlight problems associated with everyday existence 
By MARK MELLETT 
News Staff 
"Any flowers that have their own spring, are all right for me.... " recited poet Alan Dugan at the third presentation of the Sophomore Literary Festival. 
Dugan, winner of both a Na­tional Book Award and a Pulitzer Prize, appeared last night at the Library Auditorium. 
Dugan's readings examined the problems of everyday American life. He brought unsentimental irony and a low-keyed humor to the stage, as well as a personality that was quite unexpected. "Don't call a woman an ox," recited Dugan in one of his quaint poems. 
Speaking in a slow, expres­sionless manner, and twice taking swigs from a small bottle produced fom his sports jacket, Dugan drew 

Correction 
Because C:r a production error, part of a sentence in Mike Switek's speech was inadvertantly deleted in yesterday's student body president debate story. The correct quote should read, "We think the Hall Presidents' Council should have more power on campus, while the (student body) president and vice president make more speeches like the kind and queen of England." 
The name of Switek's running mate, Don Monanaro, was mispell­ed also due to a production error. 
the laughs of the crowd. "I'm dif­
ferent  from  what  the  introducer  
said," stated Dugan.  
Dugan's  recitations  ranged  in  

subject from Macedonia to Nicaragua, from flowers to flirting butterflies, in language often described as coarse and concise. During a poem that described moths having intercourse, Dugan said, "watching others in passion is strictly for biologists." 
Dugan became temporarily disoriented in the first lines of his opening poem and on two other oc­casions. In a poem about a con­stellation, he misplaced the follow sheet which held the second part of lines. 
Occasionally commenting on the coughing that came from the au­dience, Dugan said, "I've heard a lot of coughing. That sounds like inattention." Dugan later asked, "Am I boring you?" to which the crowd answered simultaneously 
"no~" 
Questioning the values upheld by society, Dugan, whose manner is described as straightforward and open, challenged the listeners to look at their own views of life. "So that's what's happening someplace else, so here's the opposite," recited Dugan in a poem. 
Dugan is presently a staff member for Poetry at the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, Mass. His first anthology, "Poems," published in 1961, receiv­ed both a National Book Award and a Pulitzer Prize. Dugan's works also have been published in 
magazines such  as  "The  New  
Yorker,"  "Atlan tic"  and  
"Harper's."

'Driver's service' among SMC discussion 
By PEGGY PROSSER 
Staff Reporter 
Anne Marie Kollman held her last meeting as student body presi­dent at a joint meeting of the Saint Mary's Board of Governance and Programming Board last night. 
After the boards discussed cur­rent issues, Kollman took ideas from the board members for the in­coming student government ad­ministration.

Board President Jeanne Heller said. She said the service will be ofc fered from 8 p.m. to 2 a:m. 
The service will take any Notre Dame and Saint Mary's student back to campus from area bars, Campus View Apartments and Saint Louis Street parties. It will not, however, be used to deliver students to bars and parties, Heller said. 
"We're not promoting going out, we're promoting not driving," Heller said. 
The Christian Life proposal has been accepted by Campus Ministry, said Kollman. 
Changes made include a campus ministry commissioner on the Board of Governance, replacing the current Christian Life Commis­sioner position. Also, there will be no Christian Life Commissioner on hall or class councils, Kollman said. 
Campus Ministry has requested a service commissioner to act as a liason between itself and the board. 
It was announced that students will be charged admission for both the Steinem lecture and Schlafly­Weddington debate. A definite ad­mission price will be announced later. It was previously reported that both lectures would be free to students. 
The Steinem lecture will be on a first come, first serve basis, as almost 2,000 people are expected to attend. The lecture will be held in the Angela athletic Facility, to ac­comodate the crowd, according to the lecture spokesperson. 
In other business, Regina presi­dent Mary Flynn proposed that minority problems on campus be addressed by the new administra­tion, who will take office after spir­spring break.

Two receive faculty endowments 
Special to The Observer 
Saint Mary's professors Ann Clark and JoAnn Widerquist have been selected to receive Lilly En­dowment Faculty Open Fellowships for the 1986-87 academic year. The fellowships, awarded to 10 faculty members from Indiana colleges and univer­sities, will allow them to take a sab­batical leave and pursue innovative work-study and research projects of their own design. 
A philosophy professor, Clark proposes to spend a year at the In­stitue for Food and Development Policy, coupling her interests in philosophy and women's issues. There, she will collaborate with author Francis Moore Lappe as a resource and discussion person for a text re-examining traditional American values. 
The institute is known not only for its specialization on food, but for its reflection on American values and its educational and research work on social justice pro­jects. In addition to her work with Lappe, Clark will work on pro­grams that will allow her to write and speak about philosophical in­sights in ethics, politics and

A nursing professor, Widerquist has spent 33 years in the nursing profession, a career that has con­vinced her that nursing is a type of ministry. She has already practiced

Widerquist will travel in the United States and the United Kingdom, reading Nightengale's works and auditing liberal arts and theological courses. 


Goode, aides negligent in MOVE bombing 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -Mayor W. Wilson Goode was "grossly negligent" in his handling of a con­frontation with the radical group MOVE that left 11 people dead, ac­cording to a report compiled by a commiSSIOn appointed by the mayor and leaked to reporters. 
Lawyer William Brown III, who headed thed 13-member commis­sion, yesterday sharply criticized the leak, saying that although published reports were correct, "what you have seen is not com­plete." 
"We do not expect the final ver­sion of these drafts to differ substantially from what has already been published," he said. 
Navy surgeon guilty of homicide in deaths 
WASHINGTON -Heart surgeon Donald M. Billig, convicted of in­voluntary manslaughter and homicide in the deaths of three pa­tients at Bethesda Naval Hospital, was sentenced yesterday to four years in prison and ordered dismissded from the service. 
The court-martial jury of nine navla officers also ordered billig, a Navy commander who served as chief of heart surgery at Bethesda, to forfeit all future pay and allowances. 
The jury foreman, Rear Adm. Harry S. Quast, read the sentence as Billig stood and showed no emo­tion. the jury had deliverated 90 minutes and could have returned a sentence of up to 115 years. 
Goode and his aides displayed "a reckless disregard for life and pro­perty" in planning and executing the May 13 siege on MOVE's for­tified headquarters, the report said. 
Five children and six adults died after a bomb dropped from a police helicopter started a fire that destroyed 61 homes and displaced hundreds of residents. 
"Dropping a bomb on an oc­cupied rowhouse was un­conscionable and should have been rejected out of hand by the mayor, the managing director, the police commissioner, and the fire com­missioner,~ the report said. "The plan to drop the bomb was reckless, ill-conceived and hastily approved." 
Defense attorneys said they 
would ask for a delay in imposing · the prison sentence, a request that under military law goes to the naval comand that convened the court­
martial. 

Billig was found guilty of two 
counts of involuntary 
manslaughter, one count of 
negligent homicide, and 18 counts 
of dereliction of duy stemming 
from operations in 1983 and 1984. 

Billig, nearly sightless in one eye, 
was found guilty last Thursday of 
causing the deaths through gross 
surgical errors during operations in 
1983 and 1984. 

Earlier yesterday, Billig pleaded 
for his freedom before the jury, 
saying the end of his career as a 
heart surgeon is "punishment of a 
severity I don't ever think I can 
describe."

Campus Ministry helps students to convert 
LESTER FLEMONS 
features writer 
Notre Dame is considered by many to be the most Catholic­oriented institution in the United States today. The University has always prided itself on a strong religious foundation based on the doctrines of the Catholic religion. But this tradition is not self­containing; even non-Catholics at Notre Dame are provided with a means to convert to Catholicism if they choose to do so. 
Under the direction of Father Andre Leveille, director of Univer­sity Ministry, an organization call­ed "Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults" regularly converts non­Catholics to Catholicism. Each September a group of men and women begin attending bi-weekly classes conducted by Leveille in an attempt to convert to the Catholic religion. 
"We are preparing them for the Catholic baptism," said Leveille. "Many of these individuals have never been to church, and therefore have never had a relationship with the Lord. We want to help them achieve that." 
Besides having a sincere desire to learn the Catholic doctrines and teachings, the student is required to attend classes every other Sunday, and must be interviewed by Leveille once or twice a semester to discuss the process of conversion. The reading of a catechism for adults with a sponsor is also required of the students and takes approx­imately one hour per week. 
"Some of the-students join, quite simply, because they want to find out whether or not they want to become Catholics," remarked Leveille. "They have found a home at a Catholic university and are strongly considering the Catholic religion." 
At some point during the pro­gram, the students are introduced to "The Steps in Becoming a Catholic," the first of which is the "Rite of Enrollment." Performed on the first Sunday of Lent, this ritual requires that the student, along with his sponsor, attend 
12: 15 Mass at Sacred Heart Church and afterward sign his name in the Sacred Book. 
The second step is the "Scrutinies" which is performed on the third Sunday of Lent, while the third step consists of the "Sacramental" which is, in effect, the baptism or profession of faith. Finally, the fourth step is quite simply the ongoing follow-up on the newly received faith. "These students are on their way, some a little further than others, but now they are ready to make a committ­ment, a profession of faith to a par­ticular religion," said Leveille. 
According to Leveille, students have given many reasons for wishing to become Catholics. Some experience faith by living at Notre Dame and interacting with room­mates. "There are always people ready to take a faith journey," con­tinued Leveille. "Being in a large Christian environment like Notre Dame just makes it easier." 
Several students currently par­ticipating in the program share Leveille's enthusiasm. Kathy Brom­meland, a sophomore in the Col­lege of Arts and Letters, considers the program to be a vital part of her religious growth. "It gives you a lot of insight into faith and the Catholic Church," she said. "If you're really serious about understanding the Catholic religion, the program can be very beneficial." 

Senior John Hines also said he believed the program is beneficial to the Notre Dame community. "There are people on this campus who have decided that they want to become Catholic," said Hines. "Father Leveille does a very good job of educating people on the Catholic doctrines. Notre Dame needs this type of program." 
As far as the term "conversion" is concerned, Leveille said a conver­sion to a particular religion is mere­ly the first step in an ongoing pro­cess. "I think that from the time we are born until the time we die we are converting closer and closer to God," said Leveille. "We should all 
be striving to become closer to the Heavenly Father." 
According to Leveille, it is im­portant that the individual come in tune with his own life. "Everyone goes through some type of conver­sion," concluded Leveille. "What distinguishes the people in this pro­gram is that their conversion is much more focused, which means that they have decided to join a church, a faith. that's a tremendous step." 



Poet spreads poetry over the airwaves 
KATHY MARTIN 
features staff writer 
Are there any aspiring poets out 
there in the turrets of Sorin or over 
the arches of Lyons or Howard? 
Whether you write poetry yourself, 
hide it away in a drawer, or just ad­
mire the works of the masters, 
Notre Dame's poet-in-residence 
Paul Roche has a radio program 
for you. 
"Words, Words, Words" ex­plores the use and appreciation of language in poetry and prose and is designed to bridge the gulf between people and poetry. The half-hour radio program began Feb. 4 and will continue until mid-May on WSND-FM (88.9) every Tuesday and Friday at 2 p.m. 

Roche begins each discussion with a reading of a well-known poem, and then concentrates on some aspect of language of both prose and poetry in order to clarify its nature and function in literature. He gives a "sentence quiz" in each program to be answered the following week. This usually deals with some common grammatical mistake in english or solecism. 
Every talk concentrates on a specific question. For example, is there an essential difference between poetry and prose? How should the design of a poem be pro­tected in the reading of dramatic verse? What are the primary ways to ruin poetry? There are also "how to" demonstrations, such as how to tell good poetry from bad, how to write a poem to order, how to create images and use them in self­hypnosis, and how Shakespeare turns a dime-store greeting card in­to a work of art. 
Roche has devoted the first series of the program to the works of such poets and writers as Shelley, Keats, Wilfred Owen, Sophocles, Wordsworth, Emily Dickinson, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Brown­ing, Hopkins, Eliot, Ogden Nash and Sappho. If the program is a success, Roche would like to pre­sent a second series which would in­clude the works of Blake, Whit­man, the Greek tragedians, Homer, Byron, coleridge, Francis Thomp­son, Tennyson, the English Metaphysicals, William Carlos Williams, Dylan Thomas, and Sylvia Plath among others. 
''I collect 
pieces of bad 
prose like jewels. They give you an opportunity for ridicule.'' 
Notre Dame's poet-in-residence of the last six years is also a world traveler. Roche comes from the suburbs of London, and he first taught in America at Smith's Col­lege in Massachusetts in 1956-57. In the English Department, he worked with several poets, including Sylvia Plath. He was awarded a grant for the translation of Greek tragedy, and moved to the island of Nevis in the West Indies, because it was the cheapest place to live and work, he said. Consequent work in writing and translating poetry took him and his family to Mexico. He returned to England in 1961 and lived on poetry and readings for many years. 

In 1980, Roche took up the teaching again and came to Notre Dame as poet-in-residence. He teaches two courses within the Pro­gram of Liberal Studies: "The Language of Poetry" and "Novel," which he is teaching this semester for the first time. 
His teaching method seems rather unique. "For the first exer­cise, I take a bad piece of prose, and we make it worse. Then we make improvements. The students rather enjoy making it worse," he added. "I collect pieces of bad pro­se like jewels. They give an oppor­tunity for ridicule." 
Roche resides on campus in his own sort of artist's garret in Brownson Hall with Julius Caesar, a canary of the English Gloucester breed. The walls are reminiscent of an art gallery, covered with pain­tings of his favorite painter, Dun­~an Grant. 
How does a poet work his writings into a busy schedule on a college campus? Roche begins each day with his coffee, followed by half to three-quarters of an hour of poetic exercises in images and rhythms. Sometimes the exercises inspire a poem, and sometimes they are thrown into what Roche calls his "quarry" for future reference. "Writing poetry is hard work, and it doesn't get any easier," he said. "The more you get to know, the 
more you realize new possibilities. I 
have become more critical of my 
work, and I find myself checking 
every word." 
According to Roche, the idea for 
the radio program had been "sim­
mering" in him ever since he first 
came to Notre Dame. "I wanted to 
do something for the word," he 
said. "I enjoy the music on WSND, 
and I t)lought, 'Why shouldn't there 
be something for the word?' 
"Less than 150 years ago, all who 
I enjoy the 
music on WSND, and I thought, 
'Why shouldn't 
there be some­
thing for the 
word?''' 
could read, read poetry. Now the amount of the reading public who read and listen to poetry is minimal. But poetry in literature is the only art form in which the English-speaking world has achiev­ed greatness. We've had good music, art and sculpture, but not on the scale of Beethoven, Velasquez, and Michelangelo.-With Shakespeare and Milton, poetry is the 'Cinderella of the arts' in our culture." 
Roche believes that the poetic process is the way our minds work, through the image as the memory of sense perception. "All the knowledge that we have is not readily available to us until it is nailed dQwn in an image. It's like a computer, filled with information, facts and data. If you don't funnel all that through an image, it stays all locked inside. 
"We have to realize that imagina­tion is very important. Through the disciplines of reading poetry and literature, the imagination is developed. Whatever we go to do later in life, whether we build bridges, sell burgers, or raise chickens, we will do it better if we have imagination. The greatest sin in contemporary life is lack of im­agination." 
He also emphasize3 the impor­tance of poetic meter: "I show on the program what happens if a poem is read the wrong way, with no notice of the orchestration of the lines. Most read it as if its only function is to give information like a newspaper. Unless you read poetry like a musical score, you're not getting all of it. It has to affect on subliminal as well as the intellec­tual level," he said. 
If "Words, Words, Words" achieves a wide audience, Roche said he would like to develop some spin-off programs in the future, such as a weekly request program in which listeners could phone in and ask to hear their favorite poems, and a program in which visiting poets and writers could read and explain their work.

We must do all we can to aid apartheid's victims 
South Africa is an urgent concern in a world contaminated contaminated bypressing con­cerns by urgent concerns. As one who has spent the better pact of his extra-curricular time in the last year devoted to the tragedy in South Africa, I often felt the temptation ofself­righteousne~. Every activist at one time or another feels that others are neglecting his ur­gent concern to their eternal embarrassment. So, I have contained any rising surge of self­righteousness simply because I am aware that it is always a possibility. Excessive self­righteousness eventually engenders feelings of hatred. We've seen activists, who in their love, are haters of all those who are not as righteous as they. I do not want to be accused of being an arrogant hater. Besides, I'd probably be miserable.

But I am minutely self-righteous in one regard. The solution to many human rights tragedies are not within our immediate reach. We are incapable of making an immediate im­pact on Soviet transgressions, for example. Yet, the whole urgency ofdivestment in South Africa lies in the belief that this is the moment in history when we should use our economic power as the last peaceful solution in order to prevent a bloodbath. And not in two years. Not even in six months. Blacks in South Africa are pleading with us to act now. If the situa­tion in South Africa is to change for the better, a solution must be implemented quickly be­cause South Africa is slipping into a civil war. A peaceful solution will soon be merely utopian nostalgia. Today, Notre Dame students will have the precious opportunity to vote on whether Notre Dame should divest its holdings in com­panies operating in South Africa. 
An informed opinion and action in any issue is best understood at Notre Dame within the context of Christian responsibility. Not only are we factually intellectual and aftluently elite relative to the world's population, but we

South Africans asking for hands to be untied 
Dear Editor: 
Today, you'll be asked to express your opi­nion on how Notre Dame can best help the minorities living in South Africa. The Anti­Apartheid Network has done a great job disseminating information about the major points, but I would like to add a few com­ments. 
One of the biggest arguments against divestment these days (one largely advanced by the U.S. corporations themselves), is that economic sanctions will impose suffering upon the blacks. Point granted. But, perhaps a few words from Allan Boesak, president of the Alliance of Reformed Chur­ches, are in order here. First, he asked, "Where was this corporate concern for the 'suffering of the blacks' in the last 25 years?" Apartheid is not an "80s issue" like TV violence of AIDS. Active, non-violent confrontations in South Africa have been staged since the early 1960s. I find it a bit naive to pronounce this corporate

also explicitly profess to be Christians. It is a 
powerful and profound position of respon­
sibility. 
One who illuminated my understanding of 
the inextricable relationship between Chris­
tianity and political action was Cedric Mason, 
an affable white Methodist pastor from South Africa. He has escaped to the United States to ftee from bogus charges of high treason after enduring months of torture and interroga­tion in South African prisons. He is a theologian, husband, father, and revolution­ary. Cedric Mason could also be mistaken for any Domer parent. 
Mason confirms the notion that relutionaries are not necessarily armed with Uzis while rashly spouting Marxist doctrine from their lips. likewise, college ac­tivists are not necessarily rash stereotypical radicals. But both want to change the status quo because the status quo should always be in a state of ftux until human rights are right­fully observed everywhere. 

Mason attempted to define the ideal Chris­tian in his talk here a few weeks ago. The ideal Christian is not conscious of his Chris­tianness. Christ urged us not to be concerned about being Christians in a narrow sense as the Pharisees epitomized. Rather, to be authentically Christian is synonymous with being fully human. To be fully human necessitates seeing the world beyond your own ego. Activism is an expression of con­cern for others that is deemed sacred in our political and religious tradition, but has late­ly been regarded with condescension by our generation. 
We know that the tragedy of oppression is that millions of people are denied the oppor­tunity to fully realize their humanity. They need us to help them. But it never occurs to us that we need them in order to be fully human. 
Whether divestment is the best moral 
policy, and I belie it is, a really disconcert­
ing question is whether Notre Dame students 
deeply care ifit is or not. I suspect that some 
conservative students will not een consider 
the validity ofdivestment simply because it is 
construed as a liberal cause Too often, we are 
strapped into our ideological straight jackets at the expense ofthe truth. 

Others might feel that it is fruitless to vote at the referendum or apply pressure to the University. But history is an aggegrate ofsmall events that coalesce to change the status quo. South Africa is no different: protests at Berkeley and Columbia, board meetings at Chase Manhattan, legislation in Congress, referendums at Notre Dame -all impact to become as a whole greater than each par­ticular event. 
Also, Notre Dame is a prestigious university in a powerful country and a very inftuential institution among the 55 million Catholics in the United States. Finally, if last fall's trustee meeting is any indication, the trustees might divest this spring ifmore pressure is applied. 
There are other reasons why students may not be inclined to care fervently about the tragedy in South Africa. Understandably, South Africa is seemingly abstract; it is far removed from our snugness here in South Bend. There are no peers coming home in flag-draped coffins. And the news blackout imposed by the South African government has curtailed the plethora of violent images that 
ftooded our television sets. But the sign of a true heart and mind is the capacity to transcend the abstraction that South Africa is by intellectually grasping the distant political obscenity of apartheid. At the same time, we must hear and feel with the heart the cries of the opppressed and their unweildly hurting even though one cannot personally attend to their lamenting and touch their wounds. 
Some of us justify our disinterest by rationalizing that the world is so con­taminated by suffering that anything we do can never even make a dent into the actual enormity ofit all. We reduce the power ofour own self to nothingness in the face of such colossal odds. We become paralyzed because we do not even know where to begin. But the real challenge is not to recede into our own egoism. Alone in our tears we feel what the news of the world daily confirms -a tragic sense of things. 
Yet history for the last two hundred years has been a joyful overcoming of oppression. Perhaps this is what being a Christian is all about: knowing that tragedy perpetually 
"concern" -two and a half decades later ­
as anything but flimsy rationalizations of 
more profit-oriented philosophies. 
Boesak also notes, "I would like to decide for myself whether or not I wish to suffer." The South African blacks and minorities are currently suffering economically, politically, and psychologically; however, 77 percent of this population favors wide-scale economic sanctions. Obviously, the very people most affected by apartheid are willing to risk additional short-term suffering for the possibility of freedom. 
No one has said that the road to freedom, in any country, was a smooth one; the op­pressed in South Africa accept this fact and know they may have to suffer consequences today in exchange for a brighter tomorrow. 
In short, while we as Americans cannot release their shackles, the oppressed in South Africa are merely asking us to untie their hands. Only through a weakened white population and economy will the minorities find themselves with any bargaining power. Don't you think we owe them this opportuni­ty? Desmond Tutu, Beyers Naude, and 

Boesak certainly think so. Hesburgh doesn't. But then again, neither does President Botha. 
Vote "yes" for divestment on Tuesday.

New CORE proposal allows best government 
Dear Editor: 

I am writing to encourage the passage of the proposal to restructure the student senate. Everyone agrees that the current system is inadequate. In the fall semester the Hall Presidents Council voted to disband the student senate, and when the proposal fail­ed, it was agreed upon to come up with a proposal to restructure the senate. A pro­posal was drawn up that would centralize the power of student government in the hands of the Student Senate, consisting of a represen­tative from each dorm (two from Flanner, Grace and off-campus). The other members of the senate would be class presidents and other certain appointed and elected officials. 
This would ensure dorm representation in student government. Under the new pro­posal, the HPC can propose legislation but it cannot ratify it. The senate would be the on­ly legislative body, but rightly so since it con-

clings to life, but finding hope and joy in hel­ping your neighbor to overcome it. This is what Cedric Mason lives for. This is what Steve Biko died for. 
In the last analysis, there is no excuse if most of the campus votes "No Opinion/Not Informed Enou~" concerning divestment in today's referendum. If the majority of Notre Dame students have this inclination, then it might be fair to conclude that we are politically comatose. This week students will have plenty of opportunities to inform them­selveson the issue through literature, debates, and a rally. They will have the chance to hear rebuttals to University President Father Theodore Hesburgh's dubious statements on divestment. 
Politics is a garment that shields the naked­ness of our values. What would an apathetic and uninformed referendum tally indicate about our values here at Notre Dame, espe­cially in a tragedy in which our University can make a difference? 
After Cedric Mason lectured at the Center for Social Concerns, we gathered at a friend's house. In the midst of his incredible account of the torture and interrogation that he ex­perienced in 13 months ofprison, there was a jolting knock at the door. 
"It's probably the security force," he said jokingly. A few more friends filled the house. 
A friend immediately looked at me. "For a split second, he probably really thought that it was the security," he said. 
In our careless indifference, in our smother­ing isolation at Notre Dame, we can never completely comprehend the utter helpless­ness, the paralyzing fear of such a late night encounter with an oppressive regime. But at least we should think about it-and then do all we can in own little corner of the world to alleviate the pain of those men, women, and children who are daily stripped of their human dignity. 
The world knows too much of those who do not.

sists of a representative from each dorm and class. 
The current senate approved the new pro­posal, but the HPC voted it down with their main complaint that there was no check on the senate. This seems kind of ironic since the HPC wanted to disband the senate and have itself be the only legislative body. The HPC was asked to suggest changes to the proposal but they did not suggest anything. 
The proposal is a sound one because it has the senate in charge of campus affairs and the HPC in charge of dorm affairs. When someone votes for a hall president, he or she votes for someone to concentrate on hall business rather than campus business. This is not to say that the hall presidents are unin­formed or uninvolved with campus business, but it seems to be a great deal of work to ask someone to be in charge of a hall and also to make an informed vote on campus issues. 
This new proposal was not written for anyone to gain a great deal of power, it was written to give the students the most effective and efficient student government. So let's put the power where it belongs by voting for 
the proposal  for  the restructuring of the  
senate.  John Hayward

Irish track wins weekend meet 
By CHUCK EHRMAN 
Sports Writer 

It was a dark weekend for Mar­quette and DePaul, as both teams fell victim to the Irish track team. For the Irish it was a meet oh so golden. 
The Irish ran away with it, scor­ing 95 points. Marquette followed with 47, with DePaul finishing a distant third with 13 points. The meet featured 15 events, and the Irish won 12 of them. 
"Overall, it was a· good meet," said Head Coach Joe Piane. "We gave a strong performance and I'm happy with the results." 
Piane was especially pleased with the -performance of Robert Nobles and David Wurst, who finished first and second in the half-mile with respective times of 1:53:21 and 1:55:41. 
In the 600-meters, John Dadamio, returning to action following recovery from a nagging sprained ankle, managed a fourth­place finish. 
"It was good to see him back," said Piane. "He had been out for a longtime." 
Other individual winners includ­ed Gary Lekander in the triple jump, Van Pearcy in the 440, Chris Matteo in the pole vault, Ray Dumas in the hurdles, Jeff Van Wie in the mile, John McNelis in the 600, Joel Autry in the long jump, Jim Tyler in the 1000, Tom Warth in the two-mile and Brandy Wells in the 60. The mile-relay team also won. 
Matteo qualified for the IC4A's, which will be held at Princeton, with a vault of 15 feet. Pearcy also qualified with a 440 time of 49:68. 

SMC fencing team finishes fourth 
By GLORIA ELEUTERI 
Sports Writer 

Four members of the Saint Mary's fencing team competed in the Great Lakes Tournament this past weekend, combining their ef­forts for a fourth-place finish in a 10-team field. 
The Belles tallied 23 points at the meet, placing all four members among the top-20. Seniors Becca Barnett and Mary Beth Proost placed eighth and ninth, respective­ly, junior Ann Raney finished 14th and senior Shannon Maughan followed in the 20th position. 
"The results from this weekend were nice," said Head Coach Mike Weeks. "I was pleased that there wer no letdowns among the team." 
The Belles continued to fence as well as they have all season. Weeks felt that at the fourth position, behind Notre Dame, Wayne State and Detroit, the team's consistency was maintained. 
"It was too bad we couldn't have placed in third over Detroit but with the point system, they were able to pass us by four points," stated Weeks. 
"Raney was the only fencer to meet against the Detroit women who managed to pull the team into the third position." 
The six remaining opponents present at the meet were Cleveland State, Michigan Dearborn, Chicago, Lawrence University, Tri State and Oberland. 
This may have been the last meet of the year for the Belles because the decision has not yet been made about nationals, which are held at Hunter College in New York City, in two weeks. 
Duke remains in first place 

Notre Dame stays at No. 12 in poll 
Associated Press 

Notre Dame, despite victories over top independents Marquette and DePaul, remained No. 12 in The Associated Press college basketball poll released yesterday. 
Duke, the top seed in this week's Atlantic Coast Conference tourna­ment, remained No. 1 and missed being a unamimous selection by one vote. 
The Blue Devils, 29-2, received 62 first -place votes and 1,259 points from the nationwide panel of sportswriters and boradcasters. Kansas, 28-3 and champions of the Big Eight, received the other first-place vote and 1,195 points to hold second for the second consecutive week. 
Duke held the top spot by winn­ing the ACC regular-season title with an 82-74 victory over then-No. 3 North Carolina, which dropped one spot in the poll. 
Thus, with one week of voting re­maining before the NCAA tourna­ment gets underway, the only teams teams to hold the No. I rankmg this season have all come from the ACC. Georgia Tech was No. 1 in the preseason poll and North Carolina begun its reign with the first week of the regular season. 
Kentucky, 26-3 and champions of the Southeastern Conference, jumped from fifth to third with 1,080 points, 35 more than the Tar Heels, 26-4, who held the No. 1 spot for 13 weeks before being dethroned by Duke in last week's balloting. 
St. John's, 27-4 moved from eighth to fifth with 938 points, 12 more than Georgia Tech, 23-5, with which finished between Duke and North Carolina in the ACC stan­dings. 
Michigan, 25-4 and currently tied for first place with Indiana in the Big Ten, improved from lOth to seventh with 829 points after vic­tories over Wisconsin and Nor­thwestern last week.

Women's tennis drops match to Purdue by close 5-4 count 
SpKial to The Obsernr 
The Notre Dame women's tennis team dropped a heartbreaking 5-4 decision to Purdue over the weekend in a match at West Lafayette. 
"It was a tough match to lose," said Notre Dame head coach Michele Gelfman. "We fought back from a 4-2 deficit after the singles play and had a good shot at winn­ing the match." 
Picking up wins at Purdue were lzzy O'Vrien (7-6, 6-2) and Tammy Schmidt (4-6, 6-1, 6-4) in the singles. In the doubles Susie Pan-

tice with the team before the tour­nament. He was not completely healed for the tournament, which had an effect on the whole team, according to McCann. 
"Durso's injury affected us a lot more than I thought it would," he said. "He's usually a big spark plug for us, and with him being less than 100 percent, we didn't get going like we should have. It really hurt us mentally." 
Magnifying the frustration for the Irish was the finish of Drake, a team which Notre Dame beat ther and Michele Dasso teamed up for a 6-4, 6-1 victory. The number­two doubles tandem of Mary Col­ligan and Natalie Illig scored a 6-0, 6-4 win. 
The team comes back home this weekend, as it will play host to Bradley, St. Mary's and Akron in the Notre Dame Quadrangular at the Courtney Tennis Center. 
"Now we'll have to get ready for this weekend," said Gelfman. "If we can play up to our potential, we should be pretty tough to beat. I'm really looking forward to getting back to our own courts." 
earlier this season. The Bulldogs sent five wrestlers to the National Tournament and placed second overall. 
The disappointing finish in the 
tournament  leaves  the  Irish  with  
some  bitter  memories  from  the  
season,  according  to  McCann,  

despite the progress his young team showed in his second year as head coach. 
"It leaves us with an empty feel­ing," he said. "We didn't win the big matches and we didn't wrestle with the confidence we had in some other matches. 
"It is really hard to accept. We all feel the season should not be over for us, but it is."

Gymnastics Club places second 
The Gymnastics Club traveled to West Lafayette Saturday to participate in a five-team meet. The men's team, after a rigorous week of practice, finished second with a score of l2l.l5. The Purdue men's team won the meet with a score of 128.10. Chicago placed third, followed by Miami (UhlO) and Indiana. 
"The men have shown a lot of improvement," said Club President Jim Ciesil. "The routines are really coming together." 
Paul Nowak took fourth in the all-around for the Irish with a score of 42.2 for six events. He top­ped the competition in the rings, and he placed fifth in the parallel bars. 
"Paul is a balanced, all-around gymnast," said Ciesil. "He had a good routine on the rings, hitting all his tricks." 
Matt Sennett placed fourth for Notre Dame in the horizontal bar with a score of 6.4, and Ciesil finished second in the floor exercise with a strong routine. 
"Practicing routines during the week helped me a lot," noted Ciesil. "I had been having trouble with a press, but I had no problem this time." 
The women's team was hindered by injuries and homework demands. Only three gymnasts com­peted, combining to give the team a third place finish.

Women's swimming team captures third 
Earlier in the season, Darlington had reset the University record in the 400-yard individual medley. 
Senior Venette Cochioli tied the University record in the 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 109.50. 
As a final piece of good news for Notre Dame women's swimming fans, it was announced this past weekend that Notre Dame will host next year's Women's Midwest In­dependent Swimming and Diving Championships in the last week of February at the Rolfs Aquatic Center.

Sports Writer 
"This team has been a wonderful group of kids to work with. They are very special." That is how Notre Dame swimming coach Tim Welsh described his team after the women captured third place in the Women's Midwest Independent Swimming and Diving Champion­ships. 
The event was hosted by the University of Illinois (t:hicago) and took place Thursday through Saturday. 
Notre Dame finished third out of a tough 14-team field. Winning the event, as they did last year, was Il­linois State with 749 points. In se­cond with 542 points was last year's third-place · finisher, Northern Michigan. 
Tied for third with Notre Dame 
was Oak Land (Michigan) with 404 
points. Nine points behind in fifth 
place was last year's runner-up, 
Western Illinois. 
Rounding out the field in respec­tive order were Eastern Kentucky, University of Illinois (Chicago), Evansville, Northeast Missouri State, Eastern Illinois University, St. Louis, Northern Iowa, Grand Valley State and Oral Roberts. 
"Going into the meet, we had three goals: to have a winning season, to win our conference, and to finish third in this Champion­ship meet," said Walsh. 
"In the very first event we had our relay squad disqualified for a false start. We lost up to 30 points because of this. But from this point on we swam beautifully." 
The Irish were fifth after the first day and fifth after the second. On the third day, however, Notre Dame swam to near perfection to move up to their third-place finish. 
One of the events which helped facilitate this comeback was the last swimming event of the meet, the 200-yard butterfly. 
"Our team depth was a key to the third place finish," said Welsh. "In the 200-yard butterfly, we entered five girls and they all scored, and that is a lot of points. In contrast, Oak Land (Michigan) had no one in the event and Western Illinois had only one swimmer competing. 
"There was no one event which sparked the team. I think the key to our success was that a lot of single decisions were made to focus on personal excellence, to do our best. We talked about this before each event. 
"This commitment is evidenced by the fact that by and large everyone swam their seasonal or lifetime best." 
Four University records were set and one was tied at the Champion­ships. 
Sophomore Barbara Byrne broke two Notre Dame reocrds. The first was in the 100-yard backstroke where she reset the mark at 102.92. She also broke the record for the 200-yard backstroke at 216.01. 
Sophomore Amy Darlington also broke two records, one in the 200­yard freestyle and the other in the 500-yard freestyle. Her times were 
154.56 and 508.60, respectively.
