Russians assail new Reagan proposal 
WASHINGTON (AP)-President Reagan, in his major foreign policy speech, challegcd the Soviet Union yesterday to take "a giant step for mankind" by joining the United States in a sweeping reduction of nuclear and conventional arms in Europe and around the world. But the Soviets immediately denounced the proposal. 
In a speech televised livt· to Europe and the United States, Reagan said he Is prepared to caned deployment of Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missiles to NATO forces if the Soviets dismantle their 55-20, SS-4 and SS-5 missiles. 
"This would be an historic step," Reagan said. "With Soviet agree­ment, we could substantially reduce the dread threat of nuclear war which hangs over the peopk of Europe. 
"This, like the first footstep on the moon, would be a giant stt·p for mankind." 
Reagan asked the Soviets to pull 
ba<:k some of their conventional 
forces, saying there could he "no 
more convincing contribution to 
peace in Europe and in the world." 
And, finally, he renewed a 
proposal for a conference -and an 
invitation for the Soviets to join it ­
to rt>duce tht· risks of"chance ofwar 
arising out of uncertainty or miscal­
culation." 
Tht· prt~sident promised that "no 
NATO weapons, conventional or 
nuclear. will ever be used in Europe 
exet·pt in response to attack." But he 
said "the momt·ntum ofthe continu­
Ing Soviet military build-up 
threatens hoth the conventional and the nuclear halance." 
Cancelling deployment of 5 72 new cruise and Pershing II missiles in Europe and a dismantling of the Soviet SS-20. SS-4 :mrl SS-"i missiles would eliminate intermediate range nuclear forces in Europe. 
It would leave the United States with its current 6,000 short-range nuclear warheads in Europe, which can barely reach the western edge of the Soviet Union. 
The Reagan proposal will be presented formally in Geneva on Nov. 30, the start of talks on limiting theater nuclear weapons. 
Reagan said the United States has prepared carefully for resumptions of strategic arms negotiations "because we do not want a repetiti­tion of past disappointments ... that sends hopes soaring only to end in dashed expectations." 
He said he ha.~ told Brezhnev that the cuts he seeks should result in levels "that are equal and verifiable" and that "our approach to verifica­tion will be to emphasize openness and creativity, rather than the secrecy and suspicion which have undermined confidence in arms control in the past." 
Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig, Jr. is to meet in Geneva on Jan. 26 and 27 with Soviet Foreign Minis­ter Andrei Gromyko to discuss the beginning of the talks. 
The president made no mention of any pre-conditions for the negotiations, although he previously has said he would not meet with Brezhnev or conduct arms talks un­less the Soviets stop arming insur­gents in El Salvador.

U.S. asks for nuclear reduction 
MOSCOW (AP)-The Soviet Uni­on accused President Reagan of trying to achieve U.S. milit .. ;y super­iority "through the back door" with his proposal yesterday to reduce U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles in Europe.

Yat'n ofyen: Japanese tell stoty 
By RICHARD BILL 
Associated Press 
TOKYO -japanese editors and publishers are 
surprised at the uproar created by reports that Presi­
dent Reagan's national security adviser accepted a 
$1,000 honorarium from ajapanese women's magazine 
for helping to arrange an interview with Nancy Reagan. 
It's a "customary practice" in Japan, said one editor, 
although most journalists arc wary ofoffering money to 
public officials. 
"The practice of paying for interviews to celebrities is prevalent in Japan -it's just like paying someone who has contributed articles for publication," said Kinjl Kawamurd. 
--------------------------~\
managing direc­
tor ofthe Foreign 
Press Center. an 
organization 
funded by the 
governmt·nt to 

help foreign journalists. 
But Kawamura, who formerly headed the Wa.~hing­ton hurcau of the mass-circulation newspaper Asabi, said such payments arc made to the person inter­viewed, not to intermediaries or people in office. 
"That is totally unacceptable," he declared. 
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said last week the money wa.o; discovered in mid-September, eight months after the interview, in a safe belonging to Reagan adviser Richard V. Allen. 
While denying any impropriety. Allen acknowledged receiving the money from the magazine Sbufu-no­Tomo (Housewives' Friend), which interviewed Mrs. Reagan in Washington on Jan. 21, the day after her hus­band was inaugurated. Allen said he forgot about the money after it was placed in the safe. 
TheJustice Department Is investigating the incident. 
Asabi reported yesterday that the women's magazine which gave Allen the S 1,000 also sent Mrs. Reagan a handmade letter box. The newpaper said the first lady sent two thank-you letters, written on White House stationary, for the gift to the reporters who conducted the interview. 
The value of the box was not disclosed in the Asabi 
article. U.S. officials are prohibited from keeping gifts 
valued at more than S I 00. The penalty for violating that 
law, enacted in 1977, is a fine ofup to Sl 0,000. 
Speakes identified the gift as a black lacquered 
stationary box with a hand-painted design. He said that 
a Washington gallery that specializes in in Asian art has 
valued it at S75. 
Kawamura said popular magazines like Sbufu-no­
Tomo, which claims a circulation of ';00,000, rarely 
have extensive business contacts or large editorial 
staffs. "So the only way they can get scoop interviews is 
to offer large sums of money," he said. 
Mitsuru Ando, editor of Bungei Sbunju, a monthly literary magazin.: with 700,000 readers, said, "We al­
ways pay money or give gifts to interviewees. Payme range from 10,000 yen ( S45) to millions of yen, depending on news value and the time it takes to set it 
up." 
Ando said ! 1,000 for Mrs. Reagan's interview was "probably the proper amount." But he added: "I won­der why the party in Washington didn't straighten it out (the matter of who received the money) beforehand, since they knew they couldn't accept it." 
Tsunco Takahashi. former editor ofjoset }isbin, a women's weekly, said that publication "usually gives gifts to public figures instead of money when we inter­view them. In the case of private citizens, we usually give money." 
Takahao;hi, who now edits another publication for the same company, said his magazine would not have done whatSbufu-no-Tomo did. 
"We wouldn't give her (Mrs. Reagan) money. We probably would have given a gift to her, not to a mid-

the U.S. president was only "pretending" to renounce deploy­ment ofnew U.S. nuclear missiles, in order to influence European public opinion. 
"He cited completely fantastic data about the balance of forces on an order of six-to-one, in spite of ir­refutable facts which confirm the existence in Europe ofapproximate balance on these arms between NATO and the U.S.S.R.," asserted the Tass report, read on Soviet tdevi­si!m's main evening news program. 
Reagan offered to retreat from a NATO decision to station 592 Persh­ing II and cruise missiles in Western Europe if Moscow agrees to pull back its own SS-20s and other medium-range missiles, already sta­tioned in Western Russia and aimed at Western Europe. 
Soviet and American negotiators to sit down in Geneva, Switzerland, Nov . .30 to discuss limiting theater llllclcar forces. 
Earlier yesterday, before Reagan's address, the Kremlin rejected this idea in advance. 
Such a move would tilt tht· European balance in the West's favor and would amount to "the Soviet Union's unilateral disarma­
ment," the official N(WOsti news agency said. 
The Novosti commentary was a reiteration of Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev's previous rejec­tion of such a U.S. negotiating posi­tion. 
The North Atlantic alliance decided in December 1979 to begin deploying the so-called "theater nuclear forces" in 1983 to counter the Soviet weapons. 
The prospect of additional nuclear weapons on the continent 
stirred growing prott·st demonstra­tions by disarmament advocates in West Germany and elsewhere in Europe in recent weeks. Comments by Reagan about the possibility '1f confining a nuclear conflict to Europe heightened the opposition. 
Reagan's proposal, coming less than a week before Brezhncv visits West Germany, may put the United States in a less defensive position politically as the negotiations begin.

Finance club sponsors business lectures 
By TOM SHAUGHNESSY 
News Staff 
Jonathan Lindley, the executive vice president of the National Savings and Loan League, spoke at the Center for Continuing Educa­tion last night in the second of three 
lectures sponsored by the Finance Club. 
Lindley addressed pertinent issues in the field of finance, among them housing mortgages and the current trend toward diversity among regulated depository institu­tions. He stated that "in this period of deregulation, savings and loan in­stitutions should be more free to choose" their financial endeavors and the variety of profit-yielding ventures in which they deal. For the future, Lindley projected that savings and loans will have to become multi-service firms. 
The Savings and Loan League is a national trade organization which represents nearly 300 savings and loan associations, concentrated primarily in the Sun Belt. 
Lindley is a graduate of George Washington University, and he com­pleted graduate work in economic policy there while working as a teaching fellow. In 1964 he was awarded a Congressional Staff Fel­lowship by the American Political Science Association.

The head Of the Veterans Administration said yester­day that ifthe govet:nment decides to compensate Vietnam veterans for any harm caused by Agent Orange the cost will run into the billions of dollars for years to come. "We would be looking at hundreds of millions ofdollars per year, going into the middle ofthe next century," VA administrator Robert Nimmo said in the first public estimate by a high official of the cost of paying veterans if studies conclude that the herbicide permanently damaged their health. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., questioning Nimmo at a hearing, suggested that the high cost ofcompensation is "a major inhibiting factor" in reaching a conclusion whether the herbicide has harmed veterans, as many say. Nimmo told the Senate Veterans Affairs Com­mittee of another delay. He disclosed that the Veterans Administra­tion has rejected a proposed design for the study. The design was prepared by the University of California at Los Angeles under a 
$114,288 VA contract awarded May 1. UCLA has been given 35 days to revise it, Nimmo said. The designers of the study said that the investigation will not produce duce findings for four years. -AP 
"Whetherthe issue is one ofincreasing employment stability to enhance group learning, cooperation, and productivity, or ofincreasing employment stability to avert bloody class warfare, the times are ripe for a new 'New Deal' for labor." So says Michael). Carter, an instructor in economics at the University of Utah, in the introduction to a book recently published at the University on labor economics. New Directions in Labor Economics and Industrial Relations, published last month by the University of Notre Dame Press, includes essays by Carter, William H. Leahy, a professor of economics at Notre Dame and Charles Craypo, an associate profes­sor of economics at Notre Dame, as well as three others by economists David M. Gordon; Lester C. Thurow, and Charles C. Kil­lingworth. "The unifying theme running through the essays,"

He called the anticipated campaign spending "totally out of proportion to the importance of the office." Peck has lost two con­gressional bids.

Campbell discusses 0-C plans 
Vice President for Student Affairs Fr. John Van Wolvlear recently announced the appointment of BrotherJohn Campbell as assistant director ofstu­dent housing at Notre Dame, succeeding Brother Edward Luther, who resigned to resume full-time activities as rector of Morrissey Hall. 
Brother Campbell begins serving in this posi­tion Dec. 1 and will be in charge of off-campus housing. 
This announcement comes in the wake of Fr. Van Wolvlear's rejection ofthe Campus Life Coun­cil's proposal for a full-time off-campus housing director. 
The CLC Task Force on the Northeast Neigh­borhood recommended that the University devote more professional attention to off-campus concerns in order to improve neighborhood rela­tions. 
The Task Force decided that a full-time off­campus housing director would help resolve such problems as the shortage of on-campus housing; stressful relations be­tween students and per­manent residents in more densely student­populated areas such as the Northeast Neighbor­hood; the off-campus housing list, which is 
-feportedly somewhat in­accurate; off-campus crime; and the amount of time the director is available for students. 
The Task Force proposed several duties for the position, includ­ing: inspecting new housing listings and re­inspecting old listings; encouraging realtors and developers interested in providing new and remodeled housing for off-campus students; working with the off-campus commissioner; improving relations with landlords; becoming a member of the Northeast Neighborhood Council; maintaining contact with South Bend Police and Notre Dame Security; increasing availability to students; and maintaining and improving current off-campus to campus transportation. 
This program, according to the Task force, would benefit both the University and students by providing a comprehensive approach for off­
 campus housing direction. 
Brother Campbell, assistant rector for Fisher Hall, said he plans to perform many of the duties proposed by the Task Force, adding that he has met with student representatives and plans to schedule meetings with Off-Campus Commis­

The first major project Brother Campbell plans to undertake is revision ofthe off-campus housing list. "I plan on updating the list by checking back with landlords every 2-3 weeks," Campbell said. "I also plan to have photos ofthe listings available for students." 
Campbell added that he sees no need for addi­tional staff at this point. "I have a full-time secretary," he said. "I don't know whether I will 
need assistants at this point." 
A former Marine Ser­geant, Campbell has been a Holy Cross Brother since 1973, serving as a medical assistant since 1976 at the Holy Cross Brothers Infirmary and the Student Health Cen­ter. Brother Campbell also does volunteer work at St. Joseph's Medical Center and is a Spanish tutor for Notre Dame ath­letes. 
Campbell noted that 
he wants the off-campus /) f<Jl~ housing office to be -I vl recognized by StUdentS. 
"I want to let students know I'm there," he said. "I want students to use the office and take advantage ofwhat we have to offer." 
Campbell emphasized the fact that he has a great deal oftime available to devote to the office, since he is leaving his job at the Student Health Center and, unlike Brother Luther, is an assistant rector at Fisher, which consumes less time. "I feel that I can perform adequately both as assistant rector and off-campus housing director." he said. 
Campbell's immediate plans and enthusiasm for the role of assistant housing director indicate a positive future for the off-campus housing office.

Carter discusses policy of South Africans 
By MOLLY RYAN 
News Staff 
Professor Gwendolen M. Carter of Indiana Vniversity discussed the political and economic changes occuring in South Africa in a lecture last night in the Library Auditorium. 
The talk, entitlc:d "Change in South Africa: How Deep Docs It Go?" was thc· fourth in the Provost's Lecture Series which is dedicated to the International Year of Disabled Persons. 
Carter, an international authority and government advisor on African affairs, expressed the hope that, through changcs in economic, political, and racial spheres, race dis­crimination will he reduced in white-dominated South Africa. These changes, which arc currently evolving, arc the result of the achievement of more African con­trol in South Africa and of the desperate demand for skilled laborers, the majority of which come from the predominantly African population. 
The home-land system which separates a vast number of Africans from whites by a forced population movement was deemed "the largest and harshest (movement) in modern times" by Carter. This sys­tem is also not economically feasible, and the South African government may be pressured into action hy the demands of the home­land inhabitants for economic change:. 
Other an:as of hopeful changes are found in South African trade uni­ons, which are demanding better conditions for hlack Africans. The young trade union members and the Allied Workers Union arc two groups cited hy Carter which are achieving positive labor gains. "American companies could take a lead of genuine significance by supporting African trade unions," Carter said. 
The existence of a stable black middle-class and the enactment of constitutional amendments to in­clude the black majority in politics arc two goals which, if achieved, would aid in eliminating black dis­crimination in South Africa. 
"The most significant recent happening for African blacks was the meeting of thirty African organiza­tions who pledged themselves to the

the century wrongly included retardation among the many rising urban social prohlems of the era. "Feehlemindedness" and retarda-, tion were characterized as social evils similar to juvenile crime, vagrancy, prostitution and venereal disease. Fearing the corruption of. society, the public, said Taylor, felt that "if we let these people out in society, they will outbrc-ed or infect 
us." 
According to Taylor, it was not until the Sixties that a significant in the public's attitude occurred. Exposes, scholarly studies and the civil rights and con~umcr move­ments contributed to the new way of thinking, and federal legislation 
was written to correct the appalling 
Freedom Chapter which claimed that Africa belongs to blacks and whites," Carter claimed. 
Thc·sc changes, though a sig­nificant beginning towards achiev­ing racial equality, only emphasize the magnitude ofwhat remains to he done. 
Professor Carter, a vtcum of childhood polio, has served as a member of the State Department's advisory council for Africa and as a trustee of the African-American In­

conditions in state institutions. 
Throughout the country, 
"normalization," the practice of 
treating the mentally disabled no dif­
ferently from others than is ab­
solutely necessary, became the 
catchword used to explain an in­
stitution's approach to treating the 
disabled. 
Unfortunately, said Taylor, the ac­

tual conditions in state institutions have remained "dismal" and "degrading" despite reformative measures. While a few states have encouraged the development of · small model communitics for the mentally disabled, a hacklash against reform has occurred. Many neigh­borhoods discourage the disabled from "moving in next door." Labor unions fear the impact of de­institutionalization on employment, and the courts arc increasingly reluctant to protect the mentally 
retardcds' rights. 
Concluding, Taylor characterized 

de-institutionalization as a 
"fundemental moral issue of human 
rights." While it also raises kgal 
questions and is of concern to 
researchers and sociologists, de­
institutionalization, he said, is a

"l think 51,000 was too much, but I think the price was high because there was a middleman," said Takahashi. 
He said that if his former magazine interviewed the wife ofJapanese Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki, for ex­ample, no gift or money would be given. "We pay only 20,000-30,000 yen ( 590-5135) -such a paltry sum would be taken as an insult.'' 
There appears to be no generally fixed scale of pay­ments within the publishing industry. Amounts vary widely and are determined by what a particular publica­tion con!>iders appropriate or manageable. 
It is generally acknowledged by editors, however, that magazines engage in the practice of paying for in­terviews more than do newspapers. And Japanese television networks appear more inclined than other media to offer cash gifts to public officials for newsmak­ing purposes.

skills," says Lichtenberg. "He works very hard to improve, and with his talent, Ken could become an out­standing quarterback for Notre Dame. Each day he gets a little bet· ter, but like most young quarter­backs, it takes awhile. 
"Right now, it is tough for Ken to get a lot of work with two good players ahead of him. Basically, Ken needs the work, the repetition, so he can develop more consistency." 
Karcher was offered scholarships by almost every major university, so a logical question would be why Notre Dame? 
"I felt that Notre Dame is the place to be a quarterback," replied Kar· cher. "It is the best university for combining academics and football, and I like Gerry. Everybody wants to be an NO quarterback. Since I thought I could play here, I decided to come::." 
As a freshman football player, Kar­cher has had a major adjustment in both school and football. However, the business major says he had very few problems. 
"When I first got here, I decided that I was going to do it. I think a lot of freshmen psych themselves out before they even set a foot on campus. I just decided I was going to catch on to the scheme of things as fast as I could. 
"Notre Dame is an easy place to adjust to. The whole campus has a friendly atmosphere to it. Whether it's football or walking around on campus or South Bend in general, this place seems like a big family." 
Karcher's confidence and talent are not limited to the gridiron. He won three letters playing first base and pitching for Shaler Area High School. As a junior, Karcher pitched two no-hitters while helping his team to 36 straight wins and the Pennsylvania state crown. 
During his senior year, the all­
around athlete captained h,is foot­
ball, baseball, and basketball teams. 
In basketball, Karcher started at guard for three years. 
In the spring, he will be playing both spring football and spring baseball. 
"While I am playing football in the spring, I'm going to play infield, so I don't usc two different arm motions. When football is over, I'll probably start pitching." 
This weekend Karcher will be able to visit the sights of his former conquests as the Glenshaw, Penn., native will be accompanying the team to Penn State. 
"It should be a lot of fun. I only live two and a half hours away and a Jot of my friends will be there, so I hope to play." 
In a few years, Karcher believes he will not only be hoping to play, but starting. 
"I really believe that I have a good  shot at being the Notre Dame quar­terback. Right now I'm learning a lot behind Blair (Kiel) and Timmy (Koegel). I feel, in my mind, that I will be the starting quarterback for Notre Dame in a ft. N year~· "

Faust wanted was leadership. There is no doubt that he got it. See KARCHER, page 5 
While the names Bob Crable and John Paxson carry 
proud tags for the University as competitors who are 
among the best in their athletic field in America, anoth­
er name is quite often overlooked since the sport of 
sailing is not exactly one that grabs headlines. 

A relaxed, laid back and winningattitude is what 
characterizes Notre Dame's sailing club. 

And no one better epitomizes that charachterization 
better than fifth year engineering major, Phil Reynolds. 
On October 1 7 of this year, Reynolds competed In 
the "Midwest Single-Handed Championships" at 
Northwestern University. The top three finishers would 
go on to represent the Midwest in the 1 5 field nationals 
to be held on Nov. 9 at Vancouver, Canada. Reynolds 
finished in 4th place out of the 18 participants at 
Norhtwestem leading him to embark on another form 
of"sailing." 

"After that meet I decided to put the boat away 
awhile and head on down to Corby's. There was a slight 
disappointment in having just barely missed the nation­
als," recalls Reynolds. 

Three days before the nationals, however, Reynolds 
received a call informing him that the top finisher at the 
Midwest meet would be unable to compete in the na­
tionals because ofa sustained injury. 

For Reynolds, though, it was just another honor that 
has become quite typical ofhis career as he has proudly 
followed successfully the footsteps of his brother 
"Buzzy," an all-American sailor at Notre Dame in 1976 
and near-miss qualifier for the 1980 Olympic squad. 
Among the awards that the younger Reynolds has 
received includes a third place finish in the 1976 
"National Junior Championships" in the 12-foot pen­
guin boats. In the same year he also placed third in the 
"Mid-Atlantic Youth Championships" in the one-man 
laser boats. 

Since his entrance into Notre Dame in 1977, one im­
pressive feat after another has piled up. In the 1979 
"Timmee Angsten Memorial Regatta," (one of the lar­
gest regattas in America) Reynolds finished fourth in 
the A-division of the race and first among teams from 
the Midwest. Come 1980 he would place third in the 
"Midwest Dingy Championships" which qualified 
Notre Dame as a representativve in the team nationals. 
He would also finish first out of 21 participants in the 
"Midwest Collegiate Single-Handed Championships" 
the same year. 

Finally, besides his qualifying for the nationals in 
1981, Reynolds placed first in both the spring and fall 
regattas at Indianapolis this year, while also placing 
tenth out of 105 sailors at the "Canadian Nationals" 
over the summer. 

Thus, his eighth place finish out of 1 5 competitors at Vancouver may not sound as glamorous as his perfor­. mances ofthe past, but, in essence, it may have been his 
greatest performance. 


Explains Reynolds, "Overall, I was pretty happy with my performance considering that I had hardly any time at all to prepare for it. There were also six all-Americans. a couple ofNorth American champions and past Olym­pic representatives competing in the meet, so I can't be too disappointed." 
In addition, Reynolds cites how sailors at top schools ofthe program from whence they came practice up to five or six hours a day with the best of facilities. In reference to the suitability for racing at St. Joseph's Lake at Notre Dame, members ofthe club have come to call it "the puddle." 
Nevertheless, Reynolds, who completes his studies in mechanical engineering this December, has been more than happy with his nine semesters at Notre Dame. 
"I like the idea ofsailing being offered as a club sport where we can run our own operations on when and how long you want to practice, whereas at schools where it's offered as a varsity sport you don't have that freedom," he says. "Yet we have had more than our share of top performances throughout the country where we have been ranked in the top twenty. 
"I was seriously considering going to the Naval Academy," he continues, "but I didn't want to put up with all that garbage of rules and regulations. Here I'm able to take the spirit ofNotre Dame with me whenever we travel as a team, and also have a social life" -which he reminds us is what you make it. 
While the Barnegat, N.J., native sees sailing as his hob­by rather than a profession, Reynolds does leave room for more goals -including the 1984 Olympics. 
And although that goal will be a little harder to attain, one should not underestimate Reynolds. He has made quite a few difficult things at Notre Dame seem like smooth sailing. 
SAILING -While Reynolds is the star, the team itself has done its fair share in helping the team to the "Timmee Angsten Memorial Regatta" which will be run over Thanksgiving break. The team qualified by finish­ing second out of 6 teams at Ann Arbor. Both the A­division and B-division finished second in their races. The A-divison was led hy skipper Reynolds and· "my very hard working and dedicated crew" Carol Silva The B-division alternated ].B. Kuppe and Bob Hannau at skipper while Dawn Barkkari served as the crew. 
Upsurging Ir-ish take on Pater-no, Lions 
The sign ofa good football team is one that gets stronger as the game goes on. We think we showed the marks ofa good football team last week against Air Force. When Air Force made it close early in the fourth quarter, our players and coaches responded to the·challenge. They did not panic. 
The most imprcssi~ing was the way we exploded in the fourth quarter. Our offensive line really got down to business after Air Force cut the score to 14-7. After that touchdown, the offense went 71 yards on four plays and 62 yards on nine plays on its next two possessions to score. 
Air Force Coach Ken Hatfield did an excellent job getting his team ready for the game. The Falcons had two weeks off to prepare, and their game plan was excellent. And their saf­tey,JohnnyJackson, who had nineteen·tackles, proved to me that he is one of the great ones in the nation at the position. 
Offensively, the Falcons took split end Joe Howard away from us with double coverage and they took away our outside sweep. They forced us to make adjustments in both areas. Without Howard, we had to go to the wingback more, and our wingbacks, especially Greg Bell,-came up with some big plays. 
With the outside sweep shut off, We went to our inside game and it was effective. On the touchdown drive that made it 21-7, Phil Carter had a great run inside of 43 yards and finished with 156 yards on 27 carries. 
Even though he only made one reception, Howard still helped us with his downfield blocking, and our fullbacks ­John Sweeney, Larry Moriarty and Mark Brooks-all played well. We also thought Tim Koegel came through when start­ing quarterback Blair Kiel had to leave the game. 
Blair, who was in the hospital early last week with the flu, 
was still weak during the game, and the high altitude com­
pounded his problems. His 31-yard scramble in the first quar­
ter that set up our first score took a lot out of him, but he 
hung in there. 

When you play in that altitude, there is a noticeable dif-

in your recovery time and )'OU are not used to it, it can be troublesome. That is why we called a timeout at the start of the fourth quarter during Air Force's long touchdown drive. 
Otherwise, our defense played well. We got some solid performances from linebacker Mark Zavagnin, who made seven tackles and had an interception, and defensive end Tony Belden, who had six stops, two for losses. Tony, our special teams' captain, was playing because ofan injury toJon Autry. 
We were also pleased with the performances oflinebacker Joe Bars, defensive end Mike Gann and cornerback Chris Brown. Bars had six tackles after replacing Rick Naylor, who left in the first quarter with a thigh bruise. Naylor had started in place ofJoe Rudzinski, who was left home to recover from some minor injuries. 
Gann, who hails from the Denver suburb of Lakewood, replaced Kevin Griffith in the second quarter whin Griffith suffered a knee bruise. Mike finished with four tackles, the same as Brown, who took over for John Krimm when Krimm became ill with the flu Friday. 
Fortunately, none ofthe injuries or illnesses are serious. 

A big moment for all of us was when middle linebacker Bob Crable made the tackle in the first quarter that broke Bob Golic's career record for tackles. I had asked Coach Hat­field if we could have the ball that was being used when Bob made the tackle, and after the game, we gave it to him. That really meant a great deal to Bob and his teammates. 
We think we have made great strides the last four weeks, and we now have an excellent opportunity to find out how good a team we really are. Despite its loss to Alabama last Saturday, Penn State still is one of the great teams in the country. 
When the topic of Penn State comes up, you naturally think about all the great linebackers and running backs the school has produced over the years. But mostly, you think about the man who has headed the program. Coach Joe Paterno is one of the great coaches and gentlemen in the profession. We are excited that Saturday's game at University Park will be the first ofa long series betwen our two univer­sities. 
This season, Coach Paterno once again has an outstanding running back in junior Curt Warner, who ranked fourth among college rushers last weeek despite some injury problems. His backup, sophomore Jon Williams, is a good one too. 
The Nittany Lions also have a fine pa~sing attack headed by sophomore Tod Blackledge, who was lOth in the NCAA statistics prior to last Saturday. He has an excellent group of receivers in split end Gregg Garrity, tight end Mile McClos­key and flanker Kenny Jackson. 
But what makes Penn State go is its offensive line. Coach Paterno has a great two-guard tandem in Sean Farrell and Mike Munchak. CenterJim Romano is also excellent. 
Defensively, Penn State plays with tenacity, and once again, the linebacking corps is solid and experienced. All three linebackers -Chet Parlavecchio. Ed Pryts and Matt Bradley -are seniors. And we'll be facing another outstand­ing safety in sophomore Mark Robinson. 
Penn State also has a solid kicking game with punter Ralph Giacomarro, who is averaging 44.7 yards a kick, and placekicker Brian Franco, who has kicked 12 field goals this 
season. 
The Nittany Lions will certainly present several challenges to our football team. We hope the reverse is true.
