The renovation of the LaFor­tune Student Center will be "substantially complete" in three weeks according to Chris Nye, managing architect for the project. 
Delays in the shipment of materials last spring had postponed the tentative date for completion to sometime last week. A series of "things here or things there,'' however, has caused a further postpone­ment to sometime before Thanksgiving. 
"We're shooting for substan­tial completion in three weeks," said Nye. "The build­ing will be basically done, but we'll be back to do punch items which are things that I may find wrong such as painting." 
While most of the renovation will be complete by mid­November, however, work crews will not vanish from the area until the spring of 1987. 
"Everything won't be per­fect again until spring-time be­cause they will have to re-sod the area," said Nye. 
"I'd be much happier if we were done right now," Nye said. "But I think the building is coming out super. It's com­ing together the way I had hoped it would, as far as what it's going to look like and how it's going to work." 
Currently, the second and third floors are complete ex­cept for some minor patchwork, according to Nye. All of the organizations with space on those floors have moved in and are adjusting to the new surroundings. 
The first floor is also in good condition except for the Huddle which is experiencing the greatest delays, Nye said. Ac­cording to Nye, problems in the Huddle are centered around delays in the shipment of kitchen equipment. 
"Cross your fingers on the Huddle," said Nye. "The first floor is done except for some work in the Huddle which predominantly irivolves kitchen equipment. We do have the furniture in and the booths in, it's painted and it's car­peted. Hopefully, at Thanks­giving, we'll have at least part of the Huddle open," he said. 
Other than the Huddle, the basement poses the next greatest challenge for the proj­ect. Currently, contractors are finishing up painting work on the bottom floor. 
"In the basement ... we are painting," Nye said. "Mter painting, the floor finishes will go down, and then we'll be out of there. 
"We're looking at about three weeks for most of the work to be done," he said. 
One area that has met its Oc­tober date for completion is the ballroom which will house Theodore's, a non-alcoholic bar and lounge. Despite "some out­lets, some wiring, and some other minor things," Theodore's will open its doors tomorrow. 
According to Nye, construc­tion and renovation of the many different offices that LaFor­tune will house has not posed the main problem. 
"It's not so many rooms," 
· said Nye. "It's renovating an 
old building. Renovating an old 
building is much more difficult 
than a new building because 
you don't know for sure what's 
there until you tear the walls 
open," he said. 
When the building is com­
plete, Nye expects students to 
be surprised. 
"The basic format of the 
building -what's in there -has 
stayed the same," Nye said. 
"The thing that will surprise 
people is that the building will 
not look like a typical Notre 
Dame building inside. The 
surprise will be the building it­
self . . . the finishes and the 
colors and the appearance," he 
said. 
"It's probably more contem­
porary but a sophisticated con­
temporary. It's not a very 
flashy contemporary, 
however, there are some areas 
that have some flash . . . like 
the Miami room, an eating and 
meeting area next to the 
Huddle," Nye said. . 
Despite the contemporary 
flare, Nye believes that some 
may not be pleased with the 
final product. 
"This thing has been in the 
works for four years, and you 
always run across difficulty in 
something like this, especially 
in the student sector of the 
building," he said. "They may 
say they didn't have any input 
... well they didn't. But their 
predecessors did, and as they 
get in, they might find that they 
don't like some things." 
"It's the best thing I've done," Nye said. "It's a much better utilization of space."

The University of California at Santa Barbara fired a campus radio disc jockey for playing a 15-minute record that narrated the thoughts of a fictional couple during a violent sexual encounter. "It's one thing to.introduce new ideas and broaden horizons," the station manager said, "but it's another to abuse our audience." -The Observer 
Vice President George Bushwill visit Notre Dame to attend the Nov. 15 football game against Penn State, the Univer­sity announced Wednesday. Bush was invited by Univer­sity President Father Theodore Hesburgh, who enclosed a football schedule in a letter to the vice president. Bush attended a Notre Dame game more than a decade ago as a guest of the late O.C. Carmichael Jr., then treasurer of the Republican National Committee and a local civic leader, Hesburgh said. Penn State, 7-0, is ranked second nationally. Notre Dame is 2-4. -The Observer

Next ND president should share Hesburgh's philosophy and vision 
Way back when, David Letterman posted an imposing calendar to count down the days until Phil Donahue moved his show to New York. 
Letterman's countdown became famous over the television; however, the suspense was not very great since everyone knew who was doing what and when. 
In a much a more serious way, I imagine many of the old priests and administrators at Corby Hall are awaiting the announcement of the new University president. 
As each day gets a big "X" mark, Notre Dame moves 24 hours closer to making official who will replace Father Theodore Hesburgh. 
While The Observer lacks the dramatic flare of Late Night, the staff has been preparing for who it will be, what challenges and changes will he oversee and how Notre Dame will react to his selection. 
A good daily newspaper takes days to produce. 
In The Observer's case, the J?rocess of col­lecting and organizing information on the pos­sible choices began quite a long time ago. 
Still, as a friend and longtime Notre Dame priest told me last spring, no one really knows who it will be. Those that do aren't talking, he said, and those that don't are. Rather than speculate on who it might be and try to make a horse race out of a very serious and monumental moment at Notre Dame, I would like to suggest that no matter who it is, Notre Dame will continue to grow and prosper. 
Notre Dame Magazine has identified five men as possible choices. While I do not know all of these men, I am sure that whoever it is, he will do a fine job managing an excellent University. 
Last spring, someone handed me a survey asking for student input on the presidential se­lection. It asked: "What is the most important qualification the new president should pos­sess?" 
I said he must be an excellent administrator. Itis not enough to be honest, hard-working, fair and so forth. To run this institution, the presi­dent must be a strong and effective leader. He must meet the vigorous financial and academic demands which will be placed on him. 
First and foremost in my opinion, he must be an organizer of people, a man who knows how to achieve the ends which the University seeks within the Catholic context of Notre Dame. 
The president must embody the characteris­tics of the University. He must be a man of competence, compassion and character who has a strong Catholic faith. For these reasons, I believe the next president should be a member of the Holy Cross Order which as a collective entity embodies the faith and profound spirit of Our Lady's school. Essential also is that the president be familiar with Notre Dame's uniaue strengths and weaknesses. Thus, he should be

a member of the community of Notre Dame and have extensive experience working with its present staff since he will have to do so once he assumes office. 
As the University has become more for­malized, the distance between the administra­tion and the students has widened. The new president must keep in close contact with the students to know their needs. The world changes quickly. Educating Catholic students for this world must be the central component of his philosophy. 
The big task Notre Dame faces results di­rectly from its success. 
The new president will have to maintain in­creasingly higher academic standards while upholding Notre Dame's strong Catholic char­acter. The task is much easier to put into words than to do. 
But enough of my words, the only man to truly know what type of person the next presi­dent must be is the man who has made the presidency what it is. 
In a recent issue of America magazine, Fa­ther Hesburgh said to those who ask, "What is the most important factor for the future of the whole enterprise?", Hesburgh simply said, "Guard your Catholic character as you would your life." 
He continued by stating, "We receive enor­mous support because we work hard, in season and out, to be what we profess to be: an excel­lence that is profoundly Catholic." 
May the next president share Hesburgh's phi­losophy and vision. May Our Lady, who guided Hesburgh, guide him.

MBA School Forum to aid student choices 
By CARL PUTNAM News Staff 
Information regarding ad­missions and special programs of 37 MBA schools will be the main thrust of the MBA School Forum today from noon to 4 in the Center for Continuing Edu­cation, according to Career and Placement Services Director Kitty Arnold. 
The event is designed to help students make a knowledge­able choice of schools. "There is an overwhelming amount of information to wade through,'' Arnold said. 
According to Arnold, the Forum is an informal meeting of students and MBA admis­sions representatives. The rep­resentatives will be able to an­swer questions concerning admissions, special programs and other pertinent informa­tion about graduate school. 
Students should learn all about their options before makin~ a choice, said Arnold. She sa1d most students are not aware that they have the option of defering admission for a to gain experience or financial stability before entering MBA school. Students also have the option of entering a special pro­gram such as a combination law and business degree, Ar­nold said. 
According to Arnold, the 
forum has met with nothing but praise from students and schools alike. Students gain the opportunity to speak with rep­resentatives of such highly re­garded schools as Boston Col­lege, Stanford and the University of Michigan. Graduate school representa­tives have found it well organ­ized and "they are always com­plimentary to the caliber of students," Arnold said. 
The MBA School Forum was modeled after several major forums held annually in Chicago, New York and Los An­gelos, said Arnold. 
All students are encouraged to attend regardless of major or class. Arnold said the schools "don't demand a Busi­

Magazine writer says liability not to blame 
By JIM RILEY Assistant News Editor 
The threat posed by industry and insurance carriers to Americans' common law rights was discussed br Paul Brodeur Wednesday m the Memorial Library Auditorium. 
Brodeur, a writer for New Yorket magazine, spoke of the "massive, unprecedented as­sault on strict liability and common law rights." 
"Government regulation in this country is abysmally inef­fective," said Brodeur. "The only thing (to protect consu­mers) is the common law and the fact that (the companies) fear punitive damages. 
"Their is no such thing as the liability crisis. This is a colos­sal hoax," said Brodeur. He said some insurance compan­ies are jacking up rates on places such as day-care centers and want to claim it is because of liability. But the ar­bitrary raising of rates often has much to do with needing money to ~ay off their asbestos and envrronmental claims, said Brodeur. 
"Industry wants to de-form not reform the tort system," said Brodeur. Under current law, manufacturers are ex­pected to test products to make sure they do not cause a dan­ger, according to Brodeur. When products do cause injury, manufacturers can be liable under the common law to pay ~unitive damages to the in­Jured party. But industry wants to do away with punitive damages, said Brodeur. 
The common law is the court­made part of justice, not depen­dent on legislation or the con­stitution, according to a law professor. Much law is formed by precendents set in previous cases. 
Strict liability, a concept that is hundreds of years old, began when makers of food and drink were required to guarantee the safety of what they made. This required guarantee was even­tually extended to all products, said Brodeur. 
Though a company acts as a "person," it "cannot be placed in the same jeopardy as a per­son," said Brodeur. Therefore the company can only be as­sessed punitive damages, Brodeur said. 
But companies don't want to pay these damages, said Brodeur. "They want to be above the law." According to Brodeur, insurance companies say they want the reforms be­cause "morally flaccid" jurors are awarding too high of dama­ges and should be stripped of their power. 
"Never mind that insurance companies have not shown they are m any economic danger,'' said Brodeur. 
Brodeur said what lies be­hind the alleged insurance crisis is the triumph of the com­mon law in recent asbestos cases. 
Insurance companies and as­bestos manufacturers had known for years that their product was dangerous, accor­ding to Brodeur, yet they claimed they didn't know of the danger until 1964. Brodeur went on to cite many cases, dating back to 1918, where the companies and their insurers had known about the dangers; according to Brodeur. 
The insurance industry has underwritten policies as fast as it can, said Brodeur. He also said the industry has made bad 
investments  in  farm  
mortgages and Sunbelt  oil  
wells.  

"Insurance companies want to stop lump sum payments of damages," and just pay the victim the interest while keeping the principal, said Brodeur. The principal would be returned to the insurance company when the person died. 
Instead of punitive damages, insurance companies and in­dustry "want to substitute a simple schedule of payment . . . . That way they can fold the cost of claims into the cost of production. And make it predictable," said Brodeur.

Robert Wilmouth, of the Na­tional Futures Association in Chicago, said, "There is definitely a split on the Board. In view of the circumstances the Board will probably vote to stay with the companies in South Africa. I don't see any drastic change in University policy."

Reagan campaigns to maintain a Republican Senate 
Associated Press 
President Reagan crusaded for continued Republican con­trol of the Senate on Wednes­day, while Democratic chal­lengers in some of the nation's closest races were buoyed by fresh poll results and newspa­per endorsements. 
In Alabama's bizarre guber­natorial race, Attorney Gen­his write-in candidacy. Grad­dick, a conservative former Republican who lost the Dem­ocratic nomination on a court ruling earlier this year, has been running a distant third in public opinion polls. 
As the candidates headed into the final week of cam­paigning, the Federal Election Commission reported that the Republican National Commit­raised more than $225 million since the beginning of the two­year election cycle. That's nearly four times the $57 mil­lion reported by their Demo­cratic counterpart commit­tees. 

Reagan left Washington aboard Air Force One for a seven-state swing that will end Election Day in California. He made an afternoon stop in freshman Sen. James Abdnor, who is in a tight re-eMction campaign with Democratic Rep. Tom Daschle. 
On his way west, Reagan stopped in Evansville, Ind., where he accused Democrats of a "naked display of power politics" in awarding a House from the 1984 campaign.

House race in a busy fall of campaigning. Both parties agree the Democrats will retain their majority in the new 435-member House that is elected next Tuesday, possibly gaining 10 or more seats in the process. 
There are 36 statehouse races on the ballot, as well, with Republicans expected to pick up at least a half-dozen seats. 
The main battleground in this year's mid-term elections is the struggle for control of the Senate, where Republicans currently hold a 53-47 edge but must defend 22 of the 34 seats at stake. 
At the Abdnor rally in economically hardhit South Dakota, the president renewed his prediction that a second economic boom is at hand, and urged voters to re-elect the "clean-up crew" of conserva­tive Republicans they sent to the Senate in 1980. 
Democrats took a pounding from another source as con­sumer advocate Ralph Nader called a news conference in Washington to accuse the party 
of a "very serious strategic campaign error" by not forum­lating a national reply to Reagan. 
But there was encouraging news for Democratic Senate challengers in Georgia and Al­abama, two states where Reagan campaigned on Tues­day, as well as Idaho, where he is headed later in the week. 
In Georgia, a poll conducted for a television station and released Tuesday night gave GOP Sen. Mack Mattingly a 47 percent to 44 percent lead over Democratic Rep. Wyche Fowler. The results of the sur­vey of 300 voters were closer than an eight-point gap that an­other poll reported earlier in the week. 
In Idaho, where GOP Sen. Steve Symms has been locked in a tight race with Gov. John Evans, the governor won the endorsement of the state's largest newspaper, The Idaho Statesman. A poll taken for the paper and a Boise television station reported Evans with a slender lead of 47.4 percent to 
45.2 percent. 
In Alabama's close Senate race, incumbent GOP Sen. Jeremiah Denton drew 50 per­cent support in a new public poll, compared with 43.4 per­cent for his Democratic op­ponent, Rep. Richard Shelby. That poll had a mart'in of errior of 5 percent, and mdicated a smaller lead for Denton than earlier surveys turned up. 
Alabama's gubernatorial race seemed ready to take an­other weird twist, with Skip Tucker, an aide to Graddick, saying there was a "50-50 chance" the attorney general will drop his write-in bid. Grad­dick won a Democratic runoff in June, but the party certified Lt. Gov. BillBaxleythewinner, saying that Graddick had im­properly appealed to Republi­can crossover votes. A federal court agreed. 
The two main party candi­dates in the race, Baxley and Republican Guy Hunt, already were courting Graddick sup­
porters.

OPEC head fired in surprise move; Planning Minister to replace him 
Associated Press 
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia ­Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, Saudi Arabia's long-standing petroleum minister and leader of OPEC, has been fired, the official Saudi Press Agency re­ported in a terse announcement today. 
No reason was given for replacing the 56-year-old Yamani, perhaps the most well-known figure within the Organization of Petroleum Ex­porting Countries. 
There have been rumors that Yamani was on the outs with the royal family, and King Fahd appeared to undercut him at a critical juncture of the Oct. 6-22 OPEC meeting. But there was no evidence that he was in danger of losing his job. 
The surprise announcement 
issued before dawn in Riyadh 
said Planning Minister Hisham 
N azer had replaced Yamani. 
N azer is considered one of the 
key ministers in this kingdom 
of 11 million. 
The announcement comes 
between two key OPEC 
meetings, one that agreed to 
continue interim production task of lining up a new production-sharing agree­ment, or distribution of produ­tion quotas among members. 
Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil-exporter and the leading OPEC member. In recent statements Saudi Arabia has made it clear that it will demand an increase in its own production quota of 4.35 million barrels a day. 
The announcement of Yamani's firing came amid reports within the oil industry that Saudi Arabia was offering a 50 cent-per-barrel discount on its oil prices. The Saudi govern­ment denied this Monday. 
Yamani, his country's oil minister since 1962, is the ar­chitect of the Saudi oil policy and the figurehead in OPEC's rise to prominence worldwide. He was appointed oil minister by King Saud, the present monarch's half-brother. 
Yamani, a lawyer by trade, is considered the architect of the 1973 Arab oil embar~o that triggered the first maJor oil price rise and reshaped the world economy. 
He remained the key OPEC powerbroker, the top man in said Saudi Arabia would con­tinue insisting that OPEC work out a permanent system for dis­tributing oil-production quotas and that the Saudis be given a bigger share of the total. 

But the next day the Saudi government announced that it had dropped its demand for an OPEC agreement on per­manent production quotas and said it was now willing to go along with another interim ar­rangement. The timing of these two statements gave the im­pression Yamani was being overruled at a key juncture in the OPEC negotiations. 
Yamani was one of 12 OPEC oil ministers seized in 1975 as hostages by pro-Palestinian 
terrorists during a conference at OPEC headquarters in Vien­na, Austria. Since then he has always traveled with personal bodyguards.

Philippine 
minister says  he was not an appointee 
Associated Press 
MANILA, philippines Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, whose criticism of gov­ernment policies has prompted calls for his resignation, said Wednesday that he was no mere appointee and that he and the military handed power to President Corazon Aquino. 
Mrs. Aquino's vice president and foreign minister, Salvador Laurel, meanwhile, suggested voters be allowed to decide whether presidential elections should be held next year, as urged by Enrile. 
"I thought it would be more fair not only to the people, but also to Mrs. Aquino and myself to know what the people feel about our tenure," Laurel told a news conference. 
Enrile, who also was defense minister under President Fer­dinand Marcos but helped lead his ouster, has insisted Mrs. Aquino call elections to legitimize her government. 
But a recently drafted consti­tution that is to be submitted to a referendum next year would keep Mrs. Aquino and Laurel in office until 1992. 
Mrs. Aquino maintains she won an electoral mandate in the fraud-tainted Feb. 7 ballot­ing in which government offi­cials declared Marcos the vic­tor. Marcos fled to Hawaii two weeks later in the face of a mil­itary and civilian revolt. 
Enrile told a nurses conven­tion Wednesday, "In the final stages of the revolution, we (the military) had complete control almost of the levers of power in the land." 
He said, "We decided not to accept that power and wield it, but instead we handed it to a civilian government headed by Mrs. Aquino.... And so, there­fore, no one can tell us that they ,1 handed to us an appointment of 1 a position because we were ~ holding those positions before 1
,
any one of them had their pos­
itions." 
1 1 
Enrile told the nurses he ~ would resign if Mrs. Aquino 
1
demanded but would first have to consult the military -"the people I represent in the gov­~ ernment." 
~ 
In recent weeks, Enrile in­creasingly has criticized Mrs. Aquino's policies, especially that of seeking a negotiated peace with communist rebels. 
Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno told reporters Wednesday that Mrs. Aquino believes her position as na­tional leader reflects "the con­tinuing support of the people."

Business background is found in many majors 
So you are considering a business major. Well, forget it. Do your future a favor and major in something else. 
All of the company presidents that I have questioned regarding majors have sa1d the same thing: a liberal edu­cation is the most important asset that an employee can have. 
Brian Murray guest column 
One can always get training in a cho­sen field from an employer. Acccount­ing and finance firms have training pro­grams that will teach a non-business major three years of accounting or finance in only one year. You could earn an MBA. Or you could learn by doing, which, regardless of your college edu­cation, you would have to do anyway. 
Whichever way you choose to enter business, starting with an unrelated major will double your worth. Your co­workers will have one degree. You will

Lawyer proposes use of pre-trial diversion 
Dear Editor: 
While I was in traffic and mis­demeanor court this morning representing clients of my own, I had the unpleasant occasion to witness a Notre Dame student being fed to the wolves by long distance. 
The student had been charged with public intoxication and had been sub­Jected to some terrible legal advice and was about to make a serious mistake. Apparently, some law students have been advising Domers how to "deal with" these misdemeanor citations. I know that the "legal advice" is surely well-intentioned, but it is also most as­suredly ill-advised. 
We live in a time when alcohol related hi-jinks are not well tolerated. Whether 
they are collegiate or "townie" in na­
r 
ture, they can involve a great deal of
r 
r lost time, expense and most impor­tantly a lasting criminal record. The young man in question had ap­parently been advised to fight the sys­tem, to reject offers of pre-trial diver­sion. I will leave to the legal philosophers the question of whether you can or should f1ght the system. Let them decide how many intoxicated minors can dance on the head of a pin. 
For the rest of us, however, let's get realistic. First, this isn't New York City. A lot could be done to improve the quality of the social life at our local colleges. Second, pre-trial diversion is a gift. If you want to take advantage of the system, take advantage of this gift. 
Pre-trial diversion is based upon a wise old American concept that "every dog deserves one bite." If you don't 
Doonesbury 
have two. (And since I have never heard of a business major going back to school to get a Liberal Arts degree, chances are that your advantage will be permanent.) 
The first senior that I met my fresh­man year at Notre Dame was a Philos­ophy major. Upon graduation, he ac­cepted a job with Solomon Brothers, a large and prestigious financial firm in New York City. He now trades stocks. 
So you are probably saying, "Brian, what should I do?" 
Most of you are Science, Engineer­ing, and Arts and Letters majors. These are all perfect pre-Business majors. Learn your field. Get work experience. Then go to law school, get an MBA, or do both. 
Ifyou want to take business courses, take only the essential ones. Accounting courses are always important. Intro­ductory Finance, Marketing, and Man­agement courses will give you a great . overview of those fields and assist you in decisions about your business career. 
Most importantly, make sure you load your undergraduate courses with plenty of writing and general classes that you will not take in graduate school. Philosophy, psychology, history and literature courses are important to make you a well-rounded individual. These courses teach thinking and com­munication skills that you will need no matter what your job. 
Also, a great part of your business education can begin now with appropri­ate reading outside of class. Forbes, Business Week, The Wall Street Jour­nal, and other business publications of­fer the generalist valuable information. Many books, such as "In Search of Ex­cellence", do not have to be read in class to benefit the reader. This reading is a critical element for a successful business career. 
The next question that you probably have is "Brian, you hypocrite, why are you an Accounting major?" Good ques­tion. However, I am planning a career in Finance, marketing, or general man­agement. Accounting gives me an ana­
have a criminal record· and you get in­volved in a criminal matter, you can be placed on this program. Stay out of trouble for a year, and your one-time criminal dalliance will be wiped off you record. It's a freebie. Take advantage of it. 
Yes, it costs you a nominal service fee. It costs you some time. But even­tually, you walk away from your dal­liance without a scar. 
There was a time in our society when a drunk driving conviction or a public intoxication conviction or a drunk and disorderly record was simply a battle scar from a "normal" youth. That time is past. It may return, but not during your minority. 
Now, we live in an era when this kind 
of "minor" criminal record will effect 
your ability to get into graduate school, 
certainly medical school, probably 
business school, and possibly even law 
school. Pre-trial diversion can wipe out 
that record, and I would strongly en­
courage anyone caught in this situation 
to take advantage of it. 

Oh, yes. One final word of free advice. 
Even if you own one, don't bother dress­
ing up in a suit and tie to appear in 
court. Dress like you would for Mass 
before going to a football game. You're 
a student. Dress like a student, not like 
an investment banker out to screw the 
the system. That judge sitting there has 
seen a thousand others just like you, 
and a suit is not going to convince him 
that your .24 blood alcohol level was an 
innocent mistake. 

You broke the law. Know your rights. 
Protect yourself in the clinches but 
stand up and take it like a person.

THAT PILL-Wtl5 AN 

Jacket wearer explains the origin of saying 
Dear Editor: 
Last Monday (before break) I returned from lunch to discover the phrase printed on the back of my jacket had attained notoriety, thanks to a dis­gusted and angry Dolores Warwick Frese. I am referring specifically to the phrase "Liquor in the Front and Poker in the Rear,'' an advertisement for Casey's Bar (a tavern with legalized gambling in the back room and a bar out front) in Whitefish, Montana, a small, rustic town in the Rocky Moun­tains just south of the Canadian border. I could go on with my jacket saga, but how I acquired the jacket is irrelevant to what I want to discuss--Frese's ir­responsible "embellishments" upon her story to make it more palatable, and certain notions of propriety which she holds to be self-evident in her own little world. 
Frese began her letter by describing a "local vignette," one in which she takes the liberty to fabricate a descrip­tion of how I felt as I purposely flashed my jacket at passers-by: "This person felt not only free, but proud and clever, to communicate such a crudely ... " Al­low me to state explicity that Frese and I have never spoken to each other before, and that she could have no pos­sible insight into what I was thinking. It is not as if she didn't have the chance to talk to me. From the context of her letter, she must have followed me for at least two minutes. Solely from my appearance, she described exactly what I must have been feeling. (And what does the fact that I am balding have to do Wlth anything)? If I were to

lytical base to understanding business. From here I can concentrate on a spe­cific area in business, any specific area that I choose. 
If I were to go into Accounting, I would major in English. If I were con­sidering investment bankin~ as a career, I would major in Engmeering for the math background. If I wanted to manage people, I would be a Psy­chology maJor. 
These pre-career majors adequately prepare the individual for any business field and are interchangeable. A good case could be made for any major, no matter how unrelated. But whatever career is chosen, a broad background will advance one's potential. 
With a little creativity in choosing majors, you will be able to expand your education and set yourself above your peers. Of course, get a degree in your chosen field. Just get an education first. 
Brian Murray is an junior Accounting major at Notre Dame 
take the same liberties in describing Frese from her letter, I might conclude that she is a militant feminist; one can plainly see the dangers of making such rash judgements concerning others. Frese must have been too busy paging through her thesaurus to notice them. 
For the rest of her letter, J:t'rese ac­cepts my legal right to wear my jacket, but suggests that everyone should ex­press their opinion on the subject, so that a consensus on this issue could be formed, thereby establishing a level of propriety for this community. I must warn of the dangers of imposing proper "guidelines" to govern where laws do not. A simple example will suffice: 75 years ago, black men had the legal right to attend this university, but I doubt any went to school here because at the time, it was just not "proper" to accept them. Because what is "proper" is not necessarily right, I willfully choose to ignore propriety. Instead, I follow what I think is right and wrong (some consider this a novel concept>. If anyone wants to know why I wear my jacket, just ask. 
I admire Frese's ability to stand up and express her opinion, but I refuse to throw my jacket away just to satisfy her own notion of an ideal world. Every­one, including Frese, should deal first and foremost with their own shortcom­ings and problems. When she can prove that she is perfect, then she can start blasting other people's choice of cloth­ing. Doesn't that notion sound vaguely familiar?

Star Wars is a vital aspect of defense package 
It's amazing how contemptuously some people view P~~si~ent Reaga~'s Strategic Defense Imtlatlve, otherwise known as Star Wars. Understand, by this I am not lumping the majority of people into a generalization, for a sur­vey as recent as Monday, Oct. 13 shows that the majority on this campus are at least open-minded with regard to SDI. Still many professors I have talked with won't even give the program the benefit of the doubt. 
Chris Julka 
in plain english 
Some people's ideological prejudices make them reject Star Wars out of hand. At best, others seem to view it as nothing more than a convenient means to attack an ideological enemy, like the President. What's even more amazing, however, is that many as­sume automatically that to support SDI is to comport with militarism. The rea­son why I say the latter is especially amazing is that when one takes the time to consider the program on its own merits, apart from the circus known as American politics, quite the opposite case can be made. Short of a policy of unconditional surrender, meaningful nuclear disarmament is impossible without Star Wars. 
Numerous marches and demonstra­tions come from today's nuclear weap­ons protestors, but as soon as the skull masks and the New Wave costumes are doffed, and the partying is over, noth­ing in terms of significant political ac­tion ever happens. 
Similarly, despite the popularity of denouncing whomever happens to be in office, it is unrealistic to point the finger at the conveniently visible politicians because the situation has only consis­tently worsened, regardless of whether a Republican or a Democrat was Pres­ident. 
Rather, if we are to deal with the problem of nuclear disarmament in a realistic manner, we must recognize that the balance of terror has continued unabated, regardless of public concern or the efforts of any politician. For what we have lacked for the past forty years is a definite means of enforcing a stra­tegic disarmament treaty. 
True, for about the past twenty-five years we have had an effective means of verifying strategic agreements with infrared detection and high resolution photography based in satellites. This has only served to make the era of detente and superficial limitations treaties practical, however, not treaties of significant reduction or elim­ination. 
The reason for this is simple: in con­trast to a mere limitations treaty, which can be enforced by two still fully capable arsenals, a significant reduc­tion treaty would have had no way of keeping the other side honest. If, for example, one side were to violate an extremely superficial limitations treaty, like SALT (which some argue has in fact happened), the advantage which this side would accrue by doing so would be relatively trivial because it would still have to reckon with an enemy arsenal which has only been su­perficially limited, not significantly reduced. If, however, one side has suc­cessfully cheated on a significant re­duction or total disarmament treaty and the other side has not, the side which has not cheated had better either get the first available copy of Das Kapi­tal or start watching Bonzo movies, for 

its rival now has only a significantly reduced arsenal -or no arsenal at all -with which to contend. Thus a disarma­ment treaty has always been impracti­cal because if it were violated, the status quo could not be enforced. If a comparatively conservative and super­
ficial limitations treaty were violated, on the other hand, the status quo could be enforced precisely because such a treaty is so conservative and superfi­cial. 
It is precisely here, however, where Star Wars should become the disarma­ment activist's dream, for an anti­ballistic missile system could be precisely such a means of enforcement. Above all, in· contrast to the means of enforcement in a mere limitations treaty, this particular one would not depend on nuclear weapons of mass destruction. 
All of this sounds nice and may be so, you may be saying, but is Star Wars -which is the name of a science fiction film after all -really feasible? 
This is not the place for a technical argument. Even with the appearance in the popular media of such exotic technologies as rail guns, particle beams, and X-ray lasers, the crucial questions must remain beyond the realm of speculation because of the very secretiveness of the research being conducted. Still,. if Star Wars were a complete waste of money, Gor­bachev should have had nothing to worry about at Reykjavik. If anything, one would expect Gorbachev to support Star Wars more enthusiastically than Reagan, for by doing so he could have only made his capitalist rival that much more needlessly poor. 
As it stands, however, Gorbachev is very much opposed to SDI and has in­sisted quite emphatically that its elim­ination or restriction be a condition for any reductions treaty. Furthermore, the Soviet Union has its own ambitious anti-ballistic missile program, with an arsenal of olash missiles poised to defend Moscow, an operational particle beam in Sary Sagan, a number of killer satellites, and what some have called a ten-year lead in particle beam tech­nology. 
Which does not prove that Star Wars or the Soviet program is feasible. But the emphasis with which Gorbachev denounces it is suggestive. Moreover, although SDI seems far out and im­plausible, anti-ballistic missile systems have worked in the past. On Aug. 28, 1944, for example, the British destroyed 97 of 101 German ''buzz bombs" which approached England -a success ratio of 96 percent. Antimissile destroyers have also become important compo­nents of the American and British navies. 
Of course all antimissile technology needs work yet, and Star Wars is still nothing more than a research program. Furthermore, even a kill ratio of 96 per­cent would not be of considerable ad­vantage when one considers an attack force of ten thousand nuclear missiles. 
It is when one considers Star Wars 
as a means of enforcing a disarmament 
treaty, however, just as reconnais­
sance satellites can currently enforce 
a limitations treaty, that these absur­
dities cease. As such, both the oppo­
nents, as well as proponents of SDI, 
generally start with a completely 
inapplicable conception of the pro­
gram. That is, they both generally con­
ceive of Star Wars as something totally 
divorced from nuclear disarmament, 
when in actuality no two programs are

For just as Star Wars technology, is pursuing a summit strat­could create a situation in which a dis­egy precisely opposed to a goal of ul­armament treaty is practical by pro­timate nuclear disarmament, if that isviding a formerly unavailable means what he truly desires.

R.E.M--"Femme Fatale" (Give­away tlexi-disc from The Bob music fanzine.) R.E.M has a way with slow songs. "Perfect Circle," "Camera" and "Pale Blue Eyes" are all lilting, ethereal, majestic case.) All the best parts of R. E. M

lornly resigned vocals about a 
girl who's going to "play you for 
a fool" as she "builds you up, 
just to put you down." "She'sjust a little tease" he murmurs, sounding as if he's going to cry all the way to her house. This one of those rare records where a group transcends its image and its past to create something truly memorable. 

Ciccone Youth (a.k.a. Sonic Youth)--"lnto the Groovy!Burnin' Up" (New Alliance Records) Cic­cone Youth is Sonic Youth in dis­guise. If you like songs about murder and ghosts and if you like people who play their guitars with screwdrivers you'll like 
Sonic Youth. If you don't like those things forget it. This single is however, a good introduction to the band. You already know the song right? Wrong. It starts off with a drum machine at high speed and breaks into harsh monotone vocals that make Madonna's bouncy tune into more ofa threat than a come-on. An occasional blast of guitar noise breaks through the mix sounding like a dentist's drill stuck on a raw nerve. Madonna's voice actually surfaces four of five times before being sucked back in by the ever-present drum 
machine. You can even dance to it sort of. Guaranteed to scare you away from your Madonna records forever. 
The Miracle Legion--''The Backyard1Jntil She Talks" (Making Waves Records) The Miracle Legion play tight-guitar­
and-drums rock 'n' roll. "So what?" you say, "Who doesn't?" Well you've got a point but these guys aren't singing about a six pack and being real lonely on a Saturday_ night. Instead they've managed to be enigmatic with­out sounding pompous. "In the Backyard" seems to be about the singer's mother although he never says so. Lyrics like "The world was so big and I was so small)!our voice was always ... the loudest ofall" sure sound like he's talking about his mother. But it could be his father or his girlfriend or his alcoholic grandma. The mood is sad with­out being sentimental and the music is great. The guitars are crisp and loud, the drums are sparse and mean and the whole song turns on a great hook. It isn't a miracle but it is a great single. 
Independent labels are the fu­ture of rock and roll. The big companies, Columbia, Warner , etc., are usually too busy to care about anything else but money. lndie labels have no money and don't have much chance of making any. They're in it for the fun and the fact that they care about the MUSIC. So do yourself a favor, buy some records by groups you've never heard of. You'll like what you hear more often than you think and you'll support what rock 'n' roll was all about in the first place. Indepen­dence.

Coryell has had enough 
Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO -San Diego Chargers Coach Don Coryell resigned Wednesday following a meeting with team owner Alex Spanos, a Chargers spokesman said. 
"I feel a change would be beneficial to the Chargers,'' said Coryell, 62. 
Coryell was in his ninth season with the Chargers, who are 1-7 in the current season. The team has lost seven straight games. 
Chargers spokesman Rick Smith said Coryell would be replaced by A1 Saunders, who was named assistant head coach at the end of last season. 
Coryell is the only coach to win more than 100 games at both the professional and col­legiate level. 
In 14 years as an NFL head coach at St. Louis and San Diego, Coryell was 114-88, in­cluding playoff games.

Field hockey takes victory 
By MARGOT MACHECA Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame field hockey rebounded from its last five games when it traveled to Val­paraiso yesterday and tallied a 2-1 victory over the Crusaders. 
With the win, the Irish raised their season record to 6-9-1 in­cluding a 2-0 sweep of Val­paraiso in both of the meetings between the two teams this fall. 
In the first period, junior for­ward Ann McGlinn scored the first Irish goal on an assist from senior Steph Giggetts. Just before the half ended, Val­paraiso scored on a breakaway to tie the match at 1-1. 
Giggetts knocked in the final and deciding goal on a feed from sophomore link Christine Sweeney to secure the victory for Notre Dame. 
Head coach Jill Lindenfeld 
liked what she saw in her 
team's performance and con­
tributed the low score to player 
losses on the forward line and 
a strong defensive showing for 
the Irish. 
"The team played a great game on a lousy field, but we did not have Corrine DiGiacomo, our leading scorer," noted the coach. 
Despite a broken nose from an earlier match, co-captain Mary Wagner did contribute yesterday to add needed strength on offense. 
The Irish also had to make 
up for the loss of junior Benet 
DeBerry, the team's most dom­
inant defensive player. 
"We did not have Benet today, but the links played very well," remarked Lindenfeld. "The whole team really had to drive and hit the ball hard on a field with very thick grass." 
Although the Irish controlled the ball for practically the en­tire game, they missed many opportunities to improve their score. 
"We totally outshot Valpo and we had thirteen penalty corners, but we could only capi­talize twice," noted Linden­feld. "Our defense played their usual strong and consistent game." 
In the final home game of the season for the team, the Irish face Albion College on Cartier Field at 3:30 p.m. Monday. There will be both varsity and junior varsity contests between the two schools. 
Following the Albion matchup, Notre Dame will have only one regular season game before traveling to Ken­tucky for the Midwest Regionals.

"Last year, the fullback was a glorified lineman. This year the fullback touches the ball on almost every play. 
"Now you don't know who's going to get the ball, so that opens up the hole for the ful­lback."

Big Ten championship is in doubt, according to conference leaders 
Associated Press 
EVANSTON, Ill. -Michigan and Ohio State are back on top in the Big Ten football race, threatening a return to their 1970s domination of the league. 
Not so, chorused most Big Ten coaches yesterday in their weekly telephone interview. 
Back in the 1970s, the Big Ten was represented in the Rose Bowl solely by Michigan and Ohio State. 
The championship monopoly was broken up by Iowa in 1982 and 1985, and by Illinois in 1983. 
So far this season, Michigan is undefeated and ranked third nationally. No. 17 Ohio State has climbed back into the rankings with six straight vic­tories.

The two teams are tied for the Big Ten lead with 4-0 records. If Ohio State defeats No. 11 Iowa this Saturday, the championship probably will be decided when Michigan and Ohio State meet Nov. 22. 
Could the two powers be heading for another period of conference domination? 
"I don't think Iowa would agree, and rightly so," said Michigan Coach Bo Schem­bechler. 
"Both of these teams have al­ways been in the race except for us in 1984. I'm not surprised that we're there now. But there are four games to go and I'm not as confident as I was in the 1970s." 
Ohio State's Earle Bruce, who takes his Buckeyes to Iowa on Saturday, was cautious with his reply. 
"School's still out," said Bruce. "We'll know more after this week. Iowa provides a tre­mendous challenge for us." 
MeNamara finishes second again as Lanier cops top skipper honors 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON-Hal Lanier of the Houston Astros, who learned his managing skills from St. Louis' Whitey Herzog, yester­day matched an honor won by his old boss by being named The Associated Press' Manager of the Year. 
Lanier guided the Astros to the NL Western Division title in his first year as a manager after five years as a coach for Herzog, who was manager of the year in 1985. 
Lanier received 53 votes and was a runaway winner over Boston's John McNamara in nationwide voting by sports writers and broadcasters, which took place before the playoffs. 
McNamara, whose Red Sox lost to the New York Mets in the World Series, received 14 votes. 
Texas Manager Bobby Valentine, a rookie like Lanier, was third with 12 votes, fol­lowed by Davey Johnson of the Mets with 10 votes. 
New York Yankees Manager Lou Piniella, Pat Corrales of the Cleveland Indians and Gene Mauch of the California Angels each received one vote. 
Lanier's Astros charged from an also-ran status all the way to the NL playoffs where they lost to the Mets in six games. 
"Whitey taught me how to run a pitching staff and I think that is a major part of manag­ing," Lanier, who was the Car­dinals' third-base coach in 1985, said. "I think I added to that a knowledge of how to recognize the talent we had and what we could do and couldn't do." 
Lanier said his 10-year major league playing career, five years as a minor league manager and five seasons of watching Herzog, had prepared him for the chal­lenge. 
Houston also became aggres­sive on the bases under Lanier. The Astros almost doubled their stolen bases from 1985, stealing 163 compared to 96. 
That was a key to the Astros' charge to their first divisional crown since 1980, when Manager Bill Virdon was named manager of the year.

working hard at it. The prac­tices are tough, but we're much happier with our play. If we keep improving, 'the sky is the limit."' 
Lambert, however, feels that it is better to take it 'one game at a time'. This weekend, the team will go back on the road facing Northern Illinois and Marquette.

The womens' Interhall foot­ball playoffs start tonight at Cartier field. The post-season tournament should prove to be an exciting one with no clear­cut favorite having emerged among the field of four which includes Farley, Breen­Phillips, Pasquerilla East, and Lyons. 
Farley, Breen-Phillips, and Pasquerilla East finished the regular season in a three-way tie for first place with each pos­ting a 6-1 record. The tie­breaker was determined by adding the total points scored in the games between the three teams. 
Farley came out on top then, with Breen-Phillips second and Pasquerilla East third. The fourth team, Lyons, finished 4-3 losing to all of the three top teams but winning the remainder of the games on their schedule. 
The first game tonight will feature Farley vs. Lyons at 7 
p.m. Farley will be the heavy favorite. Farley possesses an explosive offensive attack with talented quarterback Mary Lou Armeida who runs the op­tion and passing plays with equal skill. Farley coach Dave Hanes calls Almeida, "the key to our team." Hanes also cites running back Suzanne Schwartz as a major con­tributor to the Farley offense. 
"Our team is peaking at the right time," said Hanes. " We'll be ready for the playoffs." 
Lyons coach Matt Roy isn't ready to concede the game yet, however. 
"They're (Farley) loaded with talent, but we're talented too," he said. 
A lot of that talent is housed in Lyons tailback Robin McHugh. 
"Robin is probably the back-
l 
bone of our-team,,-said Roy. l "If you don't cut her off, she'll get outside and score." t

The Saint Mary's volleyball team raised its record to 16-5 on Tuesday, defeating both Marion and Manchester Col­leges. 
The Belles beat Marion in three out of four games, 15-9, 15-12, 8-15, and 15-6. 
The team's second win came in three straight games, as the Belles defeated Manchester, 15-12, 16-14, and 15-7. 
Senior Julie Schroeder, and sophomore Margaret Feldman, led the Belles in kills for the day, scoring 12 and 10, respectively, for the first match, and 17 and 9, respec­tively, in the second match. Schroeder also aided Saint Mary's, totaling six service aces for the day. 
These wins bring the Belles' league record to 8-1, their only league loss to Huntington Col­lege earlier in the season. 
The tea:m leads the district in passing percentages with a .920 avera~e per game. 
In addition, the Belles are ranked third in the state for most blocks per game. 
Schroeder leads the league in this category, while senior teammate Mary Reidy ranks third. 
The Belles face stiff compe­tition this weekend in the Saint Mary's College Volleyball Invi­tational, in which eight colleges and universities will partici­pate.
Two exceptional teams the Belles will be facing are Illinois Benedictine and Franklin Col­leges. 
Illinois Benedictine ranks first in the nation in the third division NCAA. The team has a 26-5 record, with one loss to the Belles earlier in the season. 
Franklin is also a seeded team, with a 25-5 record. It leads the Southern League and is undefeated in league matches.

Burtnett's status secure until finish; President doesn't want to disrupt 
Associated Press 
WEST LAFAYETTE -Coach Leon Burtnett's future at Purdue will be decided at the end of the football season, says Athletic Director George King, refusing to put additional pres­sure on a team that has lost six straight games. 
"I can't give you a definitive statement right now," King said. "I don't want to ~et into the game of s~culatlon be­cause I don't think that's help­ful to the program." 
Burtnett says he knows "there are some people out there who are out to get me," but he has no intention of quit­ting. 
"You can print this ... I will never resign from Purdue Uni­versity," said Burtnett, who two years ago was the Big Ten coach of the year but has come under increasing fire as Purdue slipped to 1-6 this season. 
As the Boilermakers prepare to play Northwestern in Evanston Saturday, they are trying to avoid becoming the first team in school history to lose seven straight games in a season. 
Despite Purdue's problems, Burtnett appears to have the support of President Stephen C. Beering and King. 
"Nothing will happen until the season ends, then an eval­uation will take place the kind of evaluation that we do every year for every coach in every sport. Then we'll go from there," said King. 
Burtnett confirmed Tuesday that $450,000 "is in the bal­lpark" of what it would take to pay off the salary and perks for the remaining four years of his current five-year contract. 
But Burtnett, 19-32-1 in his four seasons as head coach after serving five years as an assistant under Jim Young, has no intentions of it coming to that. 
"I love Purdue and I love the alumni," he said. "I know they're not happy we're losing, and I'm sure not happy we're losing. We're all in the same boat there. 
"My job just happens to be one that I'm judged on every Saturday by 70,000 people, very few of whom have ever had a football suit on but are experts in our field. 
"But they can always fire you. You're hired to be fired. They get us all eventually. And if they want me bad enough and are willing to pay off four years, they can get me. I have no control over that, so I don't worry about it." 
Burtnett said 80 percent of spring practice was devoted to the running attack, but injuries have decimated runners and blockers. 
"This is not a true test of this football team because of all the people we've lost," Burtnett said. "I'm not saying we would have won the Big Ten, but the outlook would have been a lot different." 
Burtnett said he has lost nine key players for the season, some to injuries, several be­cause of academic shortcom­ings and two due to expulsion from school.
