Sociologist Gordon Zahn: Pacifist and Roman Catholic 
Though many U.S. Catholics have yet to recognize 
pacifism as a viable option in today's world, the U.S. bis­
hops' pastoral letter on peace and war gradually is 
making more persons aware of the Christian commit­
ment to pacifism, says Catholic pacifist Gordon Zahn. 
The 66-year-old Zahn, a professional sociologist and 
historian who served four years in a U.S. Civilian Public 
Service camp as a conscientious objector to World War 
II, is the author of In Solitary Witness, a biography 
about Franz)agerstatter. 
jagerstatter, a Catholic Austrian peasant, against the 
advice offamily, friends and his local bishop, refused to 
serve in Hitler's army on just war grounds and was be­
headed Aug. 9, 1943. 
What follows are exerpts from an interview Zahn 
gave while at Notre Dame last month: 
Have U.S. bishops, in issuing theirpastoral letter on peace and war, taken the prophetic edge away from the laity and assumed the role of prophet in the Church? 
It (the pastoral letter) is really rather a cautious step ahead, a step toward viewpoints which do have more radical connotations. For example, the elevation of pacifism as a legitimate option for Catholics is a pretty big step even though in the final version they (the U.S. bishops) do go back a bit and seem to put it entirely on an individual basis. Even so, that's important. 
With the discussion of non-violence, the same thing happens. But they recognize it to an extent that it has never been recognized before -as a group position. And in this case, they go beyond the question of legitimacy and treat it as a viable possibility, as possibly efficacious. They strongly recommend further study in it. And I think that's important. 
In the pastoral you've got that instruction that we must regard as normal the path of persecution and the possibility of martyrdom. That's a very important rever­sal. And to that extent, you have at least the beginnings of prophecy. 
The biggest contribution of the pastoral is that which was previously dismissed as the type ofthing (pacifism) you get from heretical sects is now something worthy ofexamination by the Catholic community. It spoke of it favorably, in fact. That's an important difference. And it's a starting place. They haven't spoken a final word and they give no impression of having spoke a final word. 
You say this is a starting place. What isthe next step? 
There's going to be continuing stress on defending concientious objection (by the bishops). I would im­agine one ofthe things that I would certainly be pushing for is a more explicit condemnation ofcertain forms of military service. 
It could be in keeping with the spirit ofthe document 
to say that a Catholic can't serve on the Trident or in a 
missile silo, or something like this. Or even that a Cath­
olic can't train to do it. 
Until now, a person has had to establish his right to 
classification as a C.O. I would like to see the emphasis

lnsi 
ay 
of the bishops and the Church be on basically you assume that a Christian is not supposed to take part in war and would have to justify accepting military service. It would be a switch ofemphasis. It would bring us back pretty much to what the early Christian were doing. 
How do you make the average Catholic aware of pacifism as a viable option? 
There are different forms of education programs (which can be) undertaken at the parish level. Obvious­ly that's very important -that's where you can reach these middle-class Catholics who have never heard of the whole idea ofpacifism. 
As far as the people at parish levels, there is a task of undoing what has already been learned (about pacifism). The best you can expect out of a parish education program is at least an awareness of the new trend and the implication. 
What do you see as the major problems with the peace movement ttsetp 
In terms of the Catholic peace movement, (there) is the problem of liberation. My full sympathy is with liberation movements, but I would reject aligning myself with those groups which incorporate violence as a way of seeking resolutions to problems. There arc those (such as Jesuit Father Daniel Berrigan and his brother, a formerJosephite priest, Philip Berrigan) who feel it (I iheration) has to be confrontational. 
The good and bad thing is that confrontation gets notice. The good thing about the notice is that people contest their position in courts and certainly get press attention. 
The negative effect that goes along with it is that con­frontation sometimes distorts the message. It's a com­munication problem, I think. 
I think the first two Berrigan actions (the first, on Oct. 27, 1967, when Philip Berrigan and three others "annointed" draft records in a Baltimore Selective Service office with duck blood bought at a nearby delicatessen; the second, on May 17, 1968, when Daniel and Philip Berrigan and seven others burned, using homemade napalm, hundreds of draft cards outside a Selective Service office in Catonsville, Md.) were mag­nificent. 
But as he (Daniel Berrigan) seems to escalate both in numbers ofparticipants and frequency ofaction, I think the point got lost and ifnor lost completely, was at least clouded by the resentment ofmany people. 
I don't intend to dismiss their recent actions. For myself, I have more individual (ways ofprotest). The important thing that we have to recognize is that there is no dichotemy between prayer and protest.

Panama Archbishop ordains priests at ND 

By KERRY HAVERKAMP 
StaffReportet· 
Four priests were ordained into the Holy Cross Order by the ·Arch­bishop of Panama last Saturday at Sacred Heart Church. The new priests are Michael E. Connor . 
Joseph V. Corpora, James E. McDonald, and Arthur Wheeler. 
Following their ordination, the newly-ordained clergymen have a variety of plans. Connors is intend­ing to do parochial/pastoral work. Corpora wishes to teach foreign lan­guages ~t Notre Dame or one of its extensions, and is also contemplat­ing missionary work in South America. 
McDonald will be on campus in a residence hall next fall, and is preparing to do doctoral work on a Ph.D. which he may complete in London. Wheeler, who has a Ph.D. in history, wishes to continue working at the California parish where he has been a deacon. He is also consider­ing teaching at Notre Dame or in London where he has taught before. 
Wheeler said he decided to join the priesthood because he felt a call. "I wanted to be a priest all my life and felt that it wasn't a choice but an answer to God's call." He described it as a "nagging of the Holy Spirit." 

According to Father Andre Leveille. head of vocations at Moreau Seminary, there are two main reasons young men choose the Holy Cross Order. One is that the or­der is committed to a community­centered life. The second is the wide variety of ministries to choose from. such as missions, parish work, and teaching. Wheeler said he had been leaning toward the Jesuit Order un­til he came to Notre Dame for his doctorate. His experiences with the Holy Cross priests turned him toward that order. 
To become a Holy Cross priest a man spends a year as a candidate, a year as a novitiate, three graduate years in theology, and a year as a deacon. As a deacon, the priest-to-be serves an internship with a master priest and can perform all services, such as marriages and baptisms, with the exception of Mass and confes­sions. Father Leveille called it a type of"on the job training." 
Father Leveille commented that 
on the whole. the number of men in 
the U.S. choosing the priesthood has 
fallen. but the Holy Cross Order has 
increased its intake. The order has

group prepares the meal. The meal is advertised and served to the public. Any profits are used for the charitable purposes of the organiza­tion or family. 
Roemer said, "We wouldn't allow an organization to come in just to make money. Our criteria is that any money made goes to an area of real need." 
Such organizations as the St. Augustine Soup Kitchen and La Casa Mexican-American Day Care Center have served lunches. There have been other Spanish lunches and also Cambodian lunches prepared by Asian refugees. Roemer said that from 50-100 people have attended each of the lunches, which have ranged in price from $2.50 to 83. She added, "We try to connect our work with students here on campus as well as the outside community." 
Roemer said, "Through coming to these type of activities, we would like to have the students become aware of the other opportunities we offer at the Center." Some of the other activities the escsponsors are the Urban Plunge, the Senior Reflec­tion Group, the semester in Mexico and various peace and justice ac­tivities. 
She said, "We realize that many students are active in such activities and we encourage others to par­ticipate. We feel that such activities have been and should be part of the education here at Notre Dame." 
Roemer stressed the hospitality and fellowship of the Lunch Program. She said, "We see a lot of suffering and sadness but fun times are a part of any service activity. It's not just the grim aspects that should gain publicity. Celebration is also a part ofour work." 
Todays lunch will consist ofsalad. bread, vegetable soup. dessert. and coffee or tea, for 52. 50. There will be live Spanish music and the meal will be outdoors, weather permitting. Proceeds from the lunch will go to the Garcia Family, who recently arrived in America from Chile. Anyone interested in helping with this or other programs may contact Roemer at the CSC.

Counselor emphasizes social alternatives 
By CHRISTOPHER RYAN 
News Staff 
"If two years from now the social life at Notre Dame is a more positive, less alcohol-dominated world, the committee will have accomplished its job," said Dr. Patrick Utz, Notre Dame's director of alcohol counsel­ing, regarding the Committee on the Responsible Use ofAlcohol. 
Utz strongly supported the com­mittee's decision to conform to state drinking laws and its efforts to decrease alcohol's central role in Notre Dame social life, but he pointed out that a major issue to be addressed now is the lack of social alternatives. 
He said "like the majority of the people in the Notre Dame com­munity, I feel that these issues had to he dealt with, and that the commit­tee has made excellent recom­mendations for change." Utz added, "it seems the challenge is now for all members of the Notre Dame com­munity to look at the overall social life on this campus and to make a concerted effort to improve it." 
Alcohol abuse at Notre Dame isn't any more serious than at other col­leges or universities, Utz believes. 
But he sees a problem in Notre Dame's "centrality of alcohol use in social activities" and the lack of al­ternatives to replace it. He hopes one positive result . of the new 
policy, if any come about, will be to put "pressure" on all those con­cerned to make an effort to expand, improve, and develop alternatives to alcohol. 
Regarding the efforts needed to develop social alternatives, Utz said that "Our role as faculty, students, and staffof the University is to work towards this goal" and that it is up to members of the community to find the answers needed to reach it.

Student Senate criticizes alcohol directives set up by Dean Roemer 
By MIKE MILLEN 
Staff Reporter 
The student senate blasted Dean Roemer's Alcohol Directives at last night's meeting. According to Stu­dent Body Vice President Cathy David, the trustees "will be discuss­ing the directives and voting on them" at their meeting on Thursday. David, along with Student Body President lbb Bertino and several student senate members, will be present at the meeting to express their views on the issue. 
David voiced displeasure at the "beer and wine only" directive, noting "it is unfair to impose a strict limitation." Joan Cahill, President of Lyons Hall, found fault with the "number of people in a room" policy, stating "you can have a lot of people in a room and it's really low key, while halfas many people might be a real party." Student Body Treasurer AI Novas felt that a clear set of rules are necessary. "It would be nice to formulate a uniform 
policy. I'm sure that some dorms will be more lenient than others," he said. 
Other senate members disagreed. Grace Hall President Todd McMul­len believes interpretation of the policy should rest with the hall staff, commenting "the rector should decide whether it is a party or a gathering." Doug Wurth, executive coordinator, warned that the policy should take RA responsibility into account. "We must be careful about how much pressure will be put on RAs," he said. 
The "no bars in rooms" point, thought to be rather non-negotiable by David, was critically discussed by Novas. He believes bars do not promote increased alcohol con­sumption, noting "I don't know a lot of people who have a well-stocked bar-they can'tafford it." 
Duane Lawrence, president of St. Edward's Hall, was unhappy with the "50 percent alcohol, 50 percent food" budget which the directives advocate. "We have a 30 per cent food requirement here," he said, ad­ding "it's always enough." 

The senate at large disagreed with the last two proposed rules. No one was in favor of the directive which demands that transported alcohol be "in original, unopened packing with the original receipt." 
The rule requiring students from other colleges to give IDs when re­quested also met with general disap­proval. Senate members cited the impracticality of a student from the University of Illinois giving his lD to a Notre Dame Security Guard and having it mailed back to school weeks later. 
In other matters, Student Body President Rob Bertino said letters requesting support for the student government position on the directives and alcohol policy will be sent this week. "We are going to have these letters signed by students to show support, and we will show them (to the administration) a the CLC meeting." 
Government reports economy lag 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The govern­ment's main gauge of future economic activity turned down sharply last month after 18 con­secutive increases, signaling slower growth but no recession, economists said yesterday. 
The Commerce Department reported that its Index ofLeading In­dicators dropped 1.1 percent in March, ending the longest string of advances for the index since the end ofWorld War II. 
The &agan administration sought to minimize the significance of the decline, blaming much of it on bad weather. 
While no one believed that the steep drop signaled a recession, all analysts said it was further proofthat the nation will see much slower economic growth for the rest of the year. 
The decline was the first since a small 0.1 percent drop in August 1982. Since that time, the index made solid advances as the country pulled out ofthe 1981-82 recession. 
The March decline was not unex­pected because ofa string ofreports indicating much weaker business ac­tivity during the month. Housing construction posted the steepest decline on record, unemployment failed to show improvement for the firt time in six months and retail sales were down sharply. 
In addition, the government 
reported Monday that sales of new 
single-family homes were down 4.9 
percent in March. 
Commerce Secretary Malcolm , Baldrige said the March setback for 
leading indicators "exaggerates the 
extent of the slowdown in 
'economic growth." 
He said the decline was ag­
gravated by unusually bad weather 
during the month and that a better 
measure of the economy was ob­
tained by looking at the Q5 percent 
average increase in the past six 
months. He said this reflected the 
more moderate growth which is ex­
pected in coming months. 
"An occasional dip in the leading 
index is normal at this stage of the 
economic expansion," he said. 
Private economists agreed. 
"I don't think one negative leading indicator in the past 19 months indicates we are plunging back into a recession," said Robert Wescott of Wharton Econometrics. 

Wescott forecast eonomic growth at a rate of 3.7 percent from April through June, compared to an 8.3 percent pace in the first three months of the year. 
Gordon Richards, of the National Assocation of Manufacturers, said the index "points to the emergence of a major slowdown during the lat­ter part of 1984" of 3 percent growth in the third quarter. 
Jack Carlson, of the National As­sociation of Realtors, said the decline in the indicators should "allow some softening of interest rates in the months ahead" as fears in markets of an overheated economy begin to subside.

ment there isn't a lot of rank-and-file support for Gary Hart." 
David Tierney, who opened his home for an overnight stay in 1980 to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., when he campaigned in Anderson, presented Hart with a blue and gold UAW cap. Hart slipped it on and just as quickly slipped it off. 

Chris Sheets, a Middletown housewife, brought her two children to the airport where she first saw Bobby Kennedy in 1968. Mrs. Sheets said she supports Hart "because he looks to the future. He's not in the past like I feel some ofthe other candidates are. I feel like he's for the people and not the corpora­tions. I'm sick ofthe president being for corporations. The little guy is the one that counts as far as I'm con­cerned."

In past decisions, the Supreme Court has said public officials and public figures who sue for libel must prove that the alkgedly libelous statement was false and wa~ made with "actual malice" with knowledge or reckless disregard that it was false. 
The case decided Monday arose when Consumer Reports, a monthly magazine published by the Con­sumers Union of the United States, evaluated 24 loudspeakers in a May 1970 article. The report said that sounds from a Bose Corp. speaker "tended to wander about the room." 
The Ist Circuit Court of Appeals, throwing out the award, said the magazine was "guilty of using im­precise language:" but did not act out of "actual malice." The: Supreme Court agreed. 
Tyson said, ··1 think some im­provements that don't require struc­tural work could be done this summer."

McCann named wrestling coach 
Fran McCann, wrestling coach the past eight years at Indiana State Uni­versity, has been named head coach ofthe Notre Dame wrestling team. 
McCann, 44, has produced an im­pressive 76-48-3 dual record since taking over the Sycamore program in 1976. Three of his last four teams finished among the nation'~ Top 20, including the 1982 squad which 
ended up  15-1  in dual  meets and  
took  seventh  place  in  the  NCAA  
Tournament.  

McCann takes over for Brother Joseph Bruno, C.S.C., who had been the Irish head coach the last four seasons. Assistant coach Toth-Fejel handled the squad on an interim bases the last half of the '84 cam­paign. 
"Fran McCann is responsible for the national recognition Indiana State has gained the last few years," said Notre Dame Athletic Director Gene Corrigan in a statement released yesterday. "We're hopeful he can do the same thing for Notre Dame. 
"Indiana State gained everyone's respect at the NCAA level because of what it accomplished while Fran was there," Corrigan said. "We're awfully excited to have someone of his caliber to handle our program." 
Among the six Division I All­Americans coached by McCann was Bruce Baumgartner, the '82 NCAA heavyweight champion. Baum­gartner was a three-time All­American, an NCAA Top Five choice for his academic achievements and is considered a strong possibility for the gold medal in the '84 Olympics this summer in Los Angeles. 
McCann takes over a Notre Dame program that is coming off three consecutive winning seasons, including 15-2-1 and 18-2 marks in '82 and '83. 
A Chicago native, McCann previously was head coach at Winona State, where he compiled a 37-8-1 record beginning in 1970. He was '70 NAJA Coach ofthe Year after helping Winona State to a second­place finish in the NAJA tournament that season. 
A standout wrestler at Oklahoma State and Iowa, McCann t1nished third in the NCAA meet in '6.2 at I I 5 pounds while wrestling for the Haw­keyes. He graduated from Oklahoma State in '65 and spent a year at both Oklahoma State and St. Cloud State as an assistant before earning his Master's degree in '67 at St. Cloud State. McCann then was an assistant for two seasons at Winona State before becoming head coach.

State goal. As if eight seconds was not quick enough, Franklin scored again just seven seconds after his first goal. 
Ohio State never recovered from the sudden outburst as the Irish added three more goals by the end of the quarter. Meanwhile, Notre Dame goalie Rob Simpson was keeping the Buckeyes from cutting into the lead. Simpson turned away 12 OSU shots before sitting down af­ter the first half, improving his save percentage to 70 percent. 
By the time the teams reached halftime, Notre Dame held an insur­

Once again, Trocchi and Franklin led the Notre Dame offense. Trocchi scored three goals and assisted on two others to improve his sea~on to­tals to 3 3 goals and 12 assists. Franklin, who has come on strong during the winning streak, scored four times. 
Pearsall, Grote, and Tony Rettino each contributed two goals to the cause, while Don Gayhardt added two assists. 
On the defensive end, Pat Poletti and Brian McKeon split time in the second half, picking up seven and two saves, respectively, after Simpson played the entire first half.

It was not much different in the second half, either. Steve Pearsall and Franklin scored early in the third quarter to push the lead to 1 I­0 before O'Leary began substituting freely.

NFL Draft today 
Teams pick from depleted crop 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -The lll'isman 
Trophy \Vinncr is gone. So is the top 
quartlTha<.:k and tht· top-rated 
tkknsivt· lineman. 

Now it's the turn of the National 
Football l.t·ague, which sat by quiet­
ly while a 2-yt·ar-old rival signed 
some of the Class of 198-l's prime 
prospects, to pick over what's left. 
When NFL teams sit down today 
at tht· Omni Park llotd to divide up 
tht· rights 10 :H6 <.:ollegc: seniors, 
they will t1nd the nop depleted ­
nine playt·rs considered t1rst­
roundc:rs have signed with the 
llnited States Football League and 
perhaps 30 of the top I00 prospects 
havt· done the same. 

Gont· is llc:isman winner Mike 
Rozier of Nebraska, the only top­
caliber running hack available this 
year; gone is Reggie White, the 280­
pound defensive tackle from Ten· 
m:ssee; gone is Brigham Young 
quartt·rhack Steve Young, who 
signed a 43-year, 540 million con­
tract with the Los Angeles Express. 
In tact. the free-spending Express 
h;L~ snappnl up more than a dozen 
prospects who might have heen 
draftnl in tht· NI·Ts first four rounds. 
But for NFL tt·ams -and for the 
many tans who tfl·at the draft like 
the opening game of the next season 
-thert·'s still enough left to make 
for an intt·rc:sting, if somewhat 
confusing, day. Even tht· people who 
make a living at judging prospects 
acknowledge that doing that this 
year is dift1cult. 

"It's a wugh draft to make sense 
ot:" says Steve Ortmayer, director of 
football operations for the Super 
Bowl champion Los Angeles Raiders. 
"It's hard to tell what's happening, 
which means there's liable to he 
more mistakes made in this draft, al­
though maybe not on the t1rst 
round." 

Moreover, the lJSFL remains a fac­tor. Last year, after the NFL draft, it signed two of the older league's picks -quarterback Jim Kelly, drafted by Buffalo and signed by the Houston Gamblers; receiver-
Split 
continuedfrom page 12 

Freshman Ken Soos continued his 
streak of impressive hitting as he 
hammered a home run in the 
nightcap. Metzler added a pair of 
doubles to complete an impressive 
day. Trudeau also had a double, 
while Dan Harrington contributed a 
triple to the Irish attack. Conlin im­
proved his record to 4-3 with the 
victory. 

All signs pointed to continued 
Irish dominance on Sunday, as they 
travelled to Bulldog country in In­
dianapolis. But a disastrous first in­
ning, in which Butler managed to 
score six times, stole all hope for a 
sweep from Irish hearts. 

"We just didn't play well on Sun­
day," said Gallo. "We had the 't1rst 
inning blues', and they hurt us." 

Although tht· Bulldogs could only collect t1ve hits off Irish starter Mark Clcmtntz, they scored seven runs over the course of the game, includ­ing those six in the t1rst. Two Irish errors contributed greatly to Notrt·  Dame's demise. 
Notre Dame could only score: four times, three times in the third and once in the t1fth. Metzler and Vuono again highlighted the Irish attack, as they once again smashed home runs. Clementz took the tough loss, drop­ping his record to 3-5. 
Yesterday, the Irish again fell apart in the t1rst inning, letting in three Bulldog runs. The Irish came hack, and closed the gap to 3-2 in the fifth on a Mctzler sacrit1ce fly. 
But a Butler home run in the sixth closed out the scoring, and the Irish 
running hack Gary Anderson, drafted by San Diego, signed by the Tampa Bay Bandits. 
That means NI'L teams will he making sure a player can he signed hcfi)re he is drafted. 
Houston, for example, wanted to draft linebacker Wilber Marshall of Florida, hut balked at his asking price ofa reported S I million a year. Philadelphia would like Penn State wide receiver Kenny Jackson, hut is concerned about his talks with the lJSFL's Philadelphia Stars. 
In fact, the: t1rst two choices have already heen made and lockt·d up. 
The New England Patriots, who dealt with the Cincinnati Bengals af­ter the Bengals declined to match the kind of money the lJSFL was spending, took wide receiver Irving Fryar of Nebraska and immediately signed him. Then the Houston Oilers, declining to pay Marshall's price, said they had agreed to terms with Fryar's Nchraska tt·ammate, guard Dean Steinkuhler. 

That leaves the New York Giants with the opening pick. 
The Giants, who need offensive linemen and coveted Stcinkuhlcr, may, despite one ofthe NFL's strong­est linebacking units, pick the player scouts consider the next hest in the draft -linebacker Carl Banks of Michigan State. Or they may trade down for additional compensation and take offensive tackle Bill Roberts ofOhio State. 
In addition to Banks, defensive standouts include Marshall; defensive backs Mossy Cade of Texas, Russell Carter of Southern Methodist, Leonard Coleman ofVan­derbilt and Don Rogers ofUCLA; and defensive linemen Bill Maas of Pitt, Rick Bryan of Oklahoma, Keith Mil­lard of Washington State and Ron Faurot ofArkansas. 
Showing at relays earns three Championship bids 
By CHUCK EHRMAN 
.\ports Writer 
What did the Drake Relays mean to the Notre Dame track team this past weekend? For some, it now means a road trip to the upcoming IC4A Champion­ships in Villanova in three weeks. .lim Tyler;JcffVan Wie, and Mark Wozniak all qualified. 
In the 1,500-meters, Tyler bet­tered the recommended IC4A outdoor standard time by nearly four seconds with a 3:45.00 clocking. And for freshman Van Wic, a 1:49.30 time in the 800­meters was good enough to earn an invitation. Wozniak ran the 10,000-meters in 30:14.00. Said coachJoe Piane: "They ran well." 
Piane labeled the team's per­
formance as adequate. "We can he better," he said. "But I was satist1ed. We placed two out of three relay teams. And that's not bad." 

Notre Dame's 4x I, 600-meter relay foursome ofJim Moyer, Tim Cannon, Tyler, and Andy Dillon managed a fifth-place t1nish, while Moyar, Dan Shannon, John McNelis, and Cannon combined to take sixth in the distance med­ley event. 
In the field events, James Pat­terson continues to impress. The fleet-footed junior jumped his way into second place in the long jump with a 25-foot, three­quarter inch effort. 
The Irish return home this weekend to play host to the Mid­west Catholic Championships. Ail track fans should attend. "It should he fun," said Piane. 
went home unhappy. Joe Dobosh pitched well, but picked up the loss which dropped his record to 2-6. 
"We had oppurtunities to score runs, but we left too many men on hase," said Gallo. "Joe Dobosh pitched a good game. We just didn't score any runs for him." 
The loss yesterday dropped the Irish to 19-20 for the season, and left them 4-6 in the Midwestern Gty Conference. 
The split with Butler was exteme­ly disheartening for the Irish, be­cause it dimmed the conference playoffpicture greatly. 

"We are probably out of the playoffpicture with our 4-6 record," commented Gallo. "These were very disappointing losses, because I thought we had a great chance to make the playoffs." 
The Irish meet Western Mchigan in an away doubleheader tomorrow, and return home for a twinhill Thursday against St. Joseph's. 
"We now have to shoot for a win­ning season," said Gallo. "If we end 
· up on a real good note, we can still have a relatively successful season, although it would have been nice to make the playoffs."
