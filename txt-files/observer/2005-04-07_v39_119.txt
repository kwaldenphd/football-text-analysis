Women gather to envision future for Catholic Church 
Discussion e11sues at Saint Mary's College 
By MEGAN O'NEIL Sainr Mary's Ediwr 
While mnmbnrs of thn College of Cardinals gatlwred in Vatican City this week to hury Pope John Paul II and to appoint a rww lnadtw, a group of' roughly equal size nwt in 

J.n Mans llall al Saint Mary's to discuss hopn for the future of tlw Catholic Church. 
Tlwre were no t1dnvision 

cameras present, and at the end of the night there would be no smoke, gray or white, waf'ting from tho bell tower. But students and f'aeulty talked with energy and some­times emotion about issues ranging from thn ordination of womnn to homosexuality to Terri Sehiavo. , 
Thn discussion, entitled "Tiw Chureh Women Want," began with opening eomments from two chureh nxpnrts and five studnnts and then contin­tred in small groups. It was part of' an ongoing dialogue at the collego in relation to its of'f'ieial af'f'iliation with the Catholic Common Ground lnitiativn, a movement found­ed by former Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin. 
Mary llnnold, professor at Hoanokn College and an export on Catholic feminism, told the audience she was a "eontradietion" within the Church. 
"I am unapologetically pro­grnssive and thoroughly Catholic," llenold said. "I ean't imagine over leaving tho ehun~h. although I have come to understand that ol.lwrs are perfectly justifi11d in doing so." 

When she asked herself what she would like to soc in the Catholie Church, llenold said, there were several obvi­ous answers including the ordination of women and tho recognition of single, non-celi­bate women whom, she said. the chureh currently ignorns. 
Other responses, llenold said, took her by surprise and will take further thought to develop fully. 
"First," llnnold said, "thn Chureh I want is a church that lives." 
llenold said tho decline in 
vocations to tlw pri11sthood, spocif'ically the ordnr of Jesuits that dt1eply infhwncn hnr, is frightening. 
"I'm willing to take on morn responsibi Iity as a layperson, so that the chureh I love remains vibrant and visionary in tho ehanging world." llenold said.

l'n1 not offended 
One hazy night in London, I mis­takenly boarded bus number 23 without my lovely roommates. When they realized back in Flat 16 that I was missing, they "organ­ized" a makeshift "search party" Christie Boisen that consisted of them wandering 
Assistant

Scene Editor 
Strongbow­induced stupor, asking randoms if anyone had seen "the Asian." 
Judging by the offended reaction of passers-by, we apparently find ethnic jokes a bit too funny. l must have the sensitivity of a rhinoceros when it comes to the fine nuances of the diversity debate, since it's okay for people to refer to me as "the Asian," or to make me keep the cups score because "my kind" is "good with numbers," or to tell me that we're only good at Little League and hot dog eating contests. 
We're all careful about being politically correct, so saying you hate Asians in Scholastic is not received as humorous, and Latin Expressions emcees are perceived as alienating non-Latinos. Is it really the people making good­natured jokes we should worry about, when we know for a fact that they are not at all racist? Please, let's rally our efforts instead against the boorishly igno­rant, like people who try to find out what kind of Asian you are by ask­ing, "Where are you from?" If you really want to know what kind of Asian someone is, the effectiveness of this question is clearly depend­ent on the assumption that we all recently stepped off a plane from Asia. I'm from Ohio. Back off. 
I don't know what the world is coming to when we can't all gather round and have a nice hearty laugh at an ethnic joke. Sure, Latin Expressions featured Latino pride, sometimes at the expense of white people. Maybe it went too far, I'm obviously one of the least qualified people to judge that, but isn't it better than the alternative of pre­tending we're all the same? It's funny because it's true -when someone has a "you don't under­stand us" attitude they're usually right. I don't know what it's like to feel uncomfortable around white people, like one of my Mexican friends who ex-pressed this senti­ment to me, so I really don't under­stand her situation. Let people have their harmless fun. 
So the next time someone makes an inappropriate joke about your pocket abacus, it's probably not because they're prejudiced or because they're trying to build up more barriers between ethnic groups. There's already underlying differences in place, so commenting on them doesn't mean you created them, it means you can acknowl­edge and maybe celebrate them. Discrimination is not funny; ridicu­lous stereotypes about minorities are. 
But seriously, guys ... stop mak­ing me keep score.

Professor accused of stealing manure 
ROCKPORT, Mass. -A Harvard economics profes­sor has been accused of neglecting the standard mar­ket practice of paying for goods and services by trying to steal a truckload of manure from a horse farmer. 
Stable manager Phillip Casey says Martin Weitzman, Harvard University's Ernest 
E. Monrad Professor of Economics, has been steal­ing manure from Charlie Lane's Rockport farm for years. 
Police said said Casey found Weitzman on the property last Friday, so he blocked in Weitzman's pick­up truck and called police. Weitzman got angry, Casey said, then offered to pay for the manure he'd already taken. But Casey said he wouldn't budge because he wanted the thefts to stop. 
Police say ex-teacher acted on old grudge 
SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y -Police say a former ele­mentary school teacher held a grudge almost 30 years after receiving poor work reviews, littering the drive­ways of former co-workers and administrators with roofing nails and splattering paint on their garage doors. 
Thomas R. Haberbush, 72, of Niskayuna pleaded guilty Tuesday to one count each of stalking, criminal mischief and criminal tampering, all misdemeanors. Police said that three former school board members, a retired principal and a retired assis­tant principal at Caroline Street Elementary School were among the nine victims Haberbush targeted over the past two years. Their car tires were damaged by roof­ing nails that Haberbush threw in the driveways, police said.

In addition to campus news, Fowlkes said SMC­TV will also have to ability to broadcast other pro­grams from talk shows to special interest programs. 
"As long as the proposed programming follows our slogan of 'creative, intelli­gent, and engaging', as well as the professional standards set by the advis­ing committee, the sky's

"We believe SMC-TV will serve as a great innovative way for students to express themselves, as well as learn the .skills needed to create and produce on-air perform­ances."

There were 11,316 students who applied to Notre Dame this year -the third-highest num­ber of applicants ever. Of that number, less than one-third of applicants were accepted to Notre Dame, with 3,478 stu­dents receiving acceptance let­ters. Last year, just ten fewer students were admitted.

"The reality for many of us who grew up in Vatican II's wake is that we never experi­enced that which made Catholicism truly distinctive, and so now there's a real hunger in my generation and younger for a vibrant Catholic culture," Henold said. 
According to Henold, her position could be misinter­preted as an argument to return to the days before the second Vatican Council. Instead, what she would like to see is a return to a teach­ing of Church history. 
Senior Carolyn Madison said she has had many strong role models in her life and in her faith, particularly her mother and grandmother. These roles, however, are no longer sufficient in a modern Church, Madison said. 
"There are many positions in which women can make a difference, can inspire others, can lead someone to a better union with Christ," Madison said. "However, [these are] positions in which women are restricted in their actions and these women desire more." 
Senior Sarah Brown recounted her most memo­rable childhood experiences as a Catholic, bringing the gifts up to the altar and being asked to serve as a cross bearer during mass. 
"These feelings of having been included and taken seri­ously in the Church are both what made me Catholic and what keeps me Catholic," Brown said. 
Brown said that while she feels fortunate to have been given certain roles within the Church as a woman, the Church still fails to include them on an equal level. 
"When I watch CNN inter­view members of the leader­ship of the Church on the sig­nificance of the death of the Pope and I see no women approached, I do not feel included," Brown said. "I do not feel as if my voice is being taken seriously." 
Brown told the audience the Church must make a place for women at every level. 
"The Church that I want, as a woman, is one that works to make women's voices and women's experiences includ­ed and taken seriously in every arena of the Church ­from carrying the gifts of the Eucharist during mass, to leading the Church in its deci­sion making."

crisis and the revelation that many predatory priests had been relocated rather than removed caused many Catholics to desire a greater voice in choosing local church leaders. The Vatican refused to change its policy. 
As a result, many Americans turned their anger toward Rome. Kaveny said the empowerment of local leadership could have helped ease the minds of con­cerned American Catholics. 
"We need to empower our local bishops to address the situation in their own diocese, and I think the pope was a model of the uni­versal Church," Kaveny said. "The next call will be working out a fruitful relationship between the local and the univer­sal Church." 
Many have said John Paul II breathed new life into the priest­hood, inspiring new American priests to follow in his conserva­tive footsteps. The work of these young priests, many of whom are more conservative than their eld­ers in the priesthood, will play a key role in shaping the Church. 
But the number of priests is shrinking. Worldwide, their ranks have dropped by more than 15,000 during John Paul II's pontificate. 
Associate professor of history professor Robert Sullivan said, in response, that it is important to note the decline in the number of priests in America under John Paul II's reign is not an indicator of an unstable relationship with the U.S. Church. The shrinking numbers are apparent all over the world and are not character­istic of Catholicism alone, Sullivan said. 
"The decline in vocations is a 

worldwide problem; it is not con­
fined to United States," Sullivan 
said. "[The U.S. Church] not 
doing that badly relatively speak­
ing. There has also been great 
difficulty trying to fmd rabbis in 
any number." 
Pope John Paul II's firm stance 

on issues such as birth control, 
euthanasia and capital punish­
ment sparked debate in the 
United States and encouraged 
more non-Catholics to give th.e 
Church's views on such issues 
some of their attention, Sullivan 
said. 
"There has also been a kind of 

movement in the public sphere 
toward a greater willingness to 
entertain the Catholic position on 
a range of life issues," Sullivan 
said. "Political data suggests a 
slight increase in the number of 
people toward the Church's side." 
Kaveny said John Paul II 

reigned during a time when the 
U.S. Church faced issues that rocked its foundation. She also said dignity needs to be restored to the priesthood and its authori­ty. 
"I think that Pope John Paul II 

has shown that moral authority 
is really incredibly important in 
our media age," Kaveny said. 
"Not just the appearance of 
authority, but au\hority rooted in 
holiness." 
John Paul II's effect on 

American Catholics is only begin­
ning to become apparent, and 
the force of his impact is yet to be 
seen though it will likely play out 
gradually, parish by parish, 
according to the Associated 
Press. 
"In our relationships with God it's one soul at a time rather than mass movements," Sullivan said. "In his words and prayers he was able to strengthen the spiritual lives of individuals and that's the most anyone can hope to do."

goal was "to make Notre Dame a more diverse place, not just on paper." Coleman referenced Diversity Awareness Week, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transsexual (GLBT) Week and the Board of Trustees report focusing on equality as last year's key committee projects. 
New chair Sarah Liu said this year's committee would be different from last year's due to the addition of a Minority Affairs committee and men­tioned her biggest goal, a diversity retreat to be held next August. 
Liu said the retreat would cover race, religion, class and GLBT issues. 
Shappell, who previously served as Gender Issues committee chair, discussed last year's Sexual Assault Awareness Week and Eating Disorders Awareness Week and development within the Gender Resource Center. 
Incoming chair Ali Wishon said the committee would focus on awareness weeks as well as peer inter­vention groups, updated health and counseling cen­ter websites, resident assis­tant and rector training and increased male involve­ment.

committee chair Katie Boyle 
said last year's group 
worked on issues that affect students' everyday lives, such as Fair Trade coffee in the din­ing halls and LaFortune as well as basketball tickets, among other projects. 
Incoming chair Matt Walsh discussed his overall view of the committee, defining its area of concern as University policy that affects students and their lives and saying it would potentially target issues such as the dome scaffolding con­troversy, AllianceND recogni­tion and the programming endowment. 
Liz Kozlow, chief executive assistant and last year's Oversight committee chair, said last year's group exam­ined the student government constitution for inconsistencies and tried to change the transi­tion date, among other proj­ects. 

Returning senator and new committee chair Sujal Pandya said this year's Oversight com­mittee would continue last year's work, making minor changes in the constitution to increase efficiency and setting up .a master calendar. 
Minority Affairs, chaired by Rhea Boyd, and Community Relations, chaired by Nick Guzman, will be ad hoc com­mittees that will be soon be explained in further detail, Shappell said. 
Shappell noted committees will be composed of both sena­tors and non-Senate members, since anyone can apply to join. Some committees have up to 15 to 20 members, Shappell said. 
Besides the committee intro­ductions, liaison positions were also introduced. Senators can apply for seats on Judicial Council, Council of Representatives, Financial Management Board and Campus Life Council. 
Senators will be assigned to committees and liaison posi­tions by next meeting, Shappell said.

MCI rejects Qwest's buyout offer 
Associated Press 
DENVEH -The board of MCI Inc. has rnjected an $8.9 billion buyout pro­posal from Qwest Communications, opting instead to go with a lesser oll'er from Vnrizon Comrnunieations lne. 
In a statemnnt <~arly Wednesday, the MCI board said the firm was "not will­ing to jnopardizn the certainty of its Vorizon agrnoment for the uncertain­ties surrounding the Qwest proposal." 
Qwest Communications International Inc., which has made throe bids for MCI, plans to evaluate the situation before doeiding its nnxt move, Qwest spokesman Stove Hammack said Tuesday night. 
"We are weighing our options, and shareholders will dietate the next steps in the process," llammaek said. "MCI's board of directors has chosen to rnjnct what we believe is a superior om~r to acquire MCI." 
Denver-based Qwest issued a mid­night Tuesday deadline to MCI last week when it raised its bid by noarly $500 million to $8.9 billion, or about 20 percent more than the sweotoned $7.5 billion Verizon bid that MCI accepted just days earlier. .

FDA to reconsider ban on breast in1plants 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The gov­ernment is considering lifting a ban on most silicone-gel breast implants, but federal scientists question whether there's enough evidence indicating how long the devices will last inside a woman's body -or what health risks may result if they break. 
The Food and Drug Administration will consider the issue in a three-day meet­ing with its scientific advisers next week. The meeting is a key hurdle in determining whether the implants can re­enter the market. Since 1992, they have been available only to women enrolled in strictly controlled research studies because of fears they could cause major health problems. 
The implants have been largely exonerated of causing such serious illnesses as can­cer or lupus. But painful scar tissue that can form around the implants, breaks that require surgery to remove or replace implants, and other complications remain con­tentious. Ju~t 15 months ago, the FDA told manufacturers that it wouldn't lift restrictions on the implants' sale until questions about breakage in particular are settled. 
The FDA posted documents on the controversy on its Web site Wednesday. 
Competitors !named Corp. and Mentor Corp. believe they've met that requirement, arguing that breast implants, just like pacemakers or metal hips, don't last forever but that newer generations are accept­ably durable. They're better than salt water-filled implants that U.S. women can buy today, lnamed Vice President Dan Cohen said. 
Broken implants don't always cause immediate symp­toms, so the FDA asked manu­facturers to use MRI scans to track durability. Mentor cited one study suggesting three­year breakage rates ranging from fewer than 1 percent to 5 percent of patients. [named data showed that over four years, implants ruptured in 3.4 percent of women who had received them for breast enlargement patients -and in 
20.5 percent of breast cancer patients who received implants after a mastectomy. The com­pany attributed that higher rate to a particular implant model that is being redesigned. 
But those studies tracked small numbers of women for a· short time, FDA scientists cau­tioned in preliminary analyses posted on the Web site. 
"These data are of limited value" in determining how many years a woman can expect her implant to last ­and what pain or other compli­cations she might experience if it breaks and silicone gel oozes out, one FDA document con­cludes. 
In a second document, FDA scientists estimated that up to three-quarters of the devices might rupture within 10 years of implantation, requiring women to undergo additional surgery to remove or replace the implants. 
Moreover, additional docu­ments suggest that if the FDA approved widespread implant sales, implant recipients would be encouraged to get regular MRI exams, perhaps every year or two, to check for breakage. Those exams cost hundreds of dollars, and there's no way to ensure women would get them, said Diana Zuckerman of the National Research Center for Women and Families. 
It's the second time in less than two years that the FDA is debating the silicone-gel implants. In October 2003, its advisers narrowly recommend­ed allowing the implants to sell again, advice the agency declined to follow. 
Next week, the debate again will pit woman against woman, patients who say the implants caused lasting scars versus others who say the silicone-gel versions look and feel more natural than saline implants. The FDA has set aside an entire extended day -from 8 
a.m. to 11 p.m. on Monday ­to hear from the public. 


Gay civil unions bill approved 
Unlike Vermont, no court pressure motivates Connecticut vote 
Associated Press 
HARTFORD, Conn. -The state Senate has approved a landmark bill that would make Connecticut the first state to recognize civil unions between same-sex couples without being pressured by the courts. 
Senators debated for nearly four hours on Wednesday· before voting 27-9 in favor of the bill, which would give gay and lesbian couples many of the same rights as married couples. Vermont has approved civil unions, but only after a lawsuit by same-sex couples. 
"We stand today before a portal to history," said Democratic Sen. Andrew McDonald, one of a handful of openly gay lawmakers. "I ask you to pass through it." 
Proponents say the legisla­tion will likely clear the House of Representatives, possibly as early as next week. Republican Gov. M. Jodi Hell has not taken a stand on the bill, but has said she supports the concept of civil unions. 
Brian Brown, executive director of the Family Institute of Connecticut, maintained that most voters do not sup­port civil unions or same-sex marriage, and he called the vote "a slap in the face of democracy." 
"This is same-sex marriage by a different name," Brown said. 
The vote came a day after Kansas became the 18th state to pass a constitutional amend­ment banning gay marriage. Thirteen other states passed such prohibitions last year, while Alabama, South Dakota and Tennessee plan elections next year on constitutional bans. 
Gay rights proponents origi­nally hoped to pass a bill simi­lar to the Massachusetts law that allows same-sex couples to marry. But legislative lead­ers determi~ed there was more political support this ses­sion for Vermont-style civil unions, which extend the same rights and privileges of mar­riage, but without the mar­riage license. 

According to the 2000 cen­sus, there were 7,400 same­sex couples in Connecticut. 
Six of the Senate's 12 Republicans and 21 of the 24 Democrats voted for the bill. Six Republicans and three Democrats voted against it. 
Civil union supporters said the state should be proud to voluntarily extend basic human rights to thousands of gay and lesbian couples. 
"I believe that our most pre­cious a"nd important job is to make sure the rights of all our citizens are protected whore they exist and expanded where they don't exist," said Democratic Sen. Mary Ann Handley, who is part of a group of legislators who plan to press for gay marriage in Connecticut.

Treaty pacifies Ivory Coast 
Mbeki helps warring factions agree on disarmament, new elections 
Associated Press 
CAPE TOWN -Ivory Coast's warring factions agreed Wednesday to end hostilities, start immediate disarmament and make plans for new elec­tions in a bid to prevent a renewed explosion of violence in the world's leading cocoa producer. 
The agreement followed four days of talks in Pretoria mediated by South African President Thabo Mbeki, who summoned all sides to his country's capital to try to res­cue the peace process. The negotiations were the factions' first face-to-face meeting since civil war flared up again last fall in the West African nation. 
"The parties ... hereby solemnly declare the immedi­ate and final cessation of all hostilities and the end of the war through the national ter­ritory," said the agreement signed in Pretoria. 
"In this regard, they unequivocally repudiate the usc of force as a means to resolve differences among themselves," the accord said, acknowledging the "untold misery and suffering" inflicted on the lvorian people and the disastrous economic repercus­sions of the fighting. 
Ivory Coast has been split between the rebel-held north and loyalist south since a failed coup attempt in 2002. A peace accord was reached in France in January 2003, but to little avail. A cease-fire reached in May of the same year was violated twice by lvorian President Laurent Gbagbo, raising doubts about elections. 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed the accord and urged both sides to follow through with their commit­ments "promptly and in good faith," his spokesman Fred Eckhard said in a statement. 
The agreement commits the warring factions to "immedi­ately proceed with the disar­mament and dismantling of the militia throughout the entire national territory." 
All sides said they were committed to holding presi­dential and parliamentary elections scheduled in October. On his return to Abidjan, the lvorian capital, Gbagbo said disarmament would begin April 14 in the northern rebel headquarters at Bouake town. 
A copy of the deal, which was signed by Mbeki, Gbagbo, Prime Minister Seydou Diarra, former President Henri Bedie, opposition leader Alassane Ouattara and rebel leader Guillaume Soro, was sent to The Associated Press in Cape Town. 
Mbeki, who was mediating on behalf of the African Union, said all sides had agreed to the text after negotiations ran for two extra days. 
To promote fairness and transparency, the agreement said the United Nations would be invited to participate in an Independent Electoral Commission comprising repre­sentatives of both the ruling party and rebels. 
The accord also gave a more prominent role to the prime minister, who is regarded as much more moderate and conciliatory than Gbagbo. 
However, the trickiest issue -the eligibility of presidential candidates -was not final­ized. The current constitution contains a clause that all pres­idential candidates be second­generation lvorians. As it stands, the clause effectively bars Ouattara -a former prime minister who is consid­ered Gbagbo's main opponent -from running. 
Mbeki said he was confident this could be sorted out within 
a  week,  according  to  the  
South  African  Press  
Association.  

The U.N. Security Council on Monday extended the man­date of its peacekeeping mis­sion in Ivory Coast for a month to give more time to mediation efforts. The council had threatened sanctions to com­plement an arms embargo in place since November. 
The United Nations has 6,000 peacekeepers in the buffer zone between the two parts of the country, and France has an additional 4,000 soldiers. 
The Pretoria talks marked the first face-to-face meeting of all the factions since vio­lence flared in November, when Gbagbo sent his newly built-up air force on bombing runs in the north.

MEXICO 

Civilian border guards slovv inunigrant influx 
Determined migrants promise to find other routes through desert 
Associated Press 
AGUA PRIETA -The number of Mexican migrants trying to sneak into the United States through southeast Arizona has dropped by half since hundreds of U.S. civilians began guarding the area earlier this week, say Mexican officials assigned to protect their citizens. 
But that doesn't mean the migrants have given up. Most remain determined to cross and say they will simply avoid the 23-mile stretch of desert between Agua Prieta and Naco, where volunteers from the "Minuteman Project" are guarding the U.S. side of the border. 
Grupo Beta, a Mexican gov­ernment-sponsored organiza­tion that tries to discourage people from crossing illegally and aids those stranded in the desert, began patrolling that area along with state police offi­cers on Sunday, when Minuteman anti-immigrant activists began showing up. 
Before the volunteers arrived, Grupo Beta encountered at least 400 migrants daily. On Monday, the second day Minutemen were present on the border, they spotted 198, said ·Bertha de Ia Hosa. Beta's coordinator in 

Agua Prieta, a town across the 
border from Douglas, Ariz. 
De Ia Hosa said that doesn't 

mean most have decided to stay 
home. 
"The fact that we're not see­

ing them here doesn't mean 
they are not trying to cross," de 
Ia Rosa said. "They say they will 
look for another place or wait 
awhile -but they are not giv­
ing up." 
Grupo Beta, along with armed 

state police officers, began 
patrolling the Mexican side of 
the border on Sunday. 
Jose Luis Mercado is among 

those determined to cross. 
Mercado, a f'arm worker from central Mexico state, was one of 10 migrants who walked through the desert all night Monday and early Tuesday ·before they were abandoned by the smuggler they had paid to 
g<!'t thPm across the bordPr. 
"lie just said it was too risky 

to cross and to wait f'or him, but 
he never came back," Mercado 
said. 
Mercado, like most migrants 

trying to eross into the United 
States from this dusty border 
city, had been unaware of the 
Minuteman Project, despite 
extensive news media coverage 
of the group. 
He and his companions were 

resting in a ditch littered with 
plastic bottles, clothes and 
empty tuna cans when they 
were spotted by Grupo Beta 
agent Hector Salazar. 
Journalist's house arrest concludes early 
Associated Press 
PROVIDENCE, R.I. -A fed­eral judge on Wednesday granted a television reporter early release from the home­confinement sentence he was serving for failing to disclose the source of a videotape that showed a city official taking a cash bribe. 
Jim Taricani, 55, was expected to be released Saturday, two months earlier than his original release date. He was originally scheduled to be released in June. 
Taricani sought early release, and U.S. District Court Judge Ernest Torres found that Taricani had com­plied with all the conditions of the home confinement, which included a ban on him work­ing, giving media interviews or using the Internet. 
Prosecutors also did not object to releasing him early. The order frees Taricani from probation or any further court supervision. 
Taricani, who works for the NBC affiliate WJAR-TV, has been confined to his home since Dec. 9. He was given a six-month sentence for failing to disclose the source of the video. 
Taricani, who is a heart transplant recipient and suf­fers from a variety of medical ailments, cannot speak to the media until his release on Saturday. 

"We are very relieved, very happy," said Taricani's wife, Laurie White. She said her husband's health is stable, and he is looking forward to walking and enjoying outside air. 
His TV station said in a statement that it was pleased by the ruling and looked for­ward to Taricani's return. White said she expected her husband to be back at work as early as next week, at least on a part-time basis. 
Taricani's lawyer, Deming Sherman, referred all calls to the station. 
Six days after Taricani was found guilty, his source. defense lawyer Joseph Bevilacqua Jr., admitted that he had given Taricani the tape. Bevilacqua had previ­ously denied under oath that he had been Taricani's source and is now the subject of a criminal investigation. 
Taricani is among a small but growing number of reporters who have became ensnared in the legal system for defying judicial demands to disclose where they got information. At least 16 reporters and 14 news organi­zations are involved in legal fights in courthouses from New York and Washington to San Francisco.

AFGHANISTAN 
U.S. Inilitary copter 
crash kills 16 people 
Associated Press 
KABUL-A U.S. military heli­copter returning from a mission smashed into the southern Afghan desert Wednesday, killing at least 16 people in the deadliest military crash since the fall of the Taliban in late 2001. An Afghan official said most of the dead appeared to be Americans. 
The CH-47 Chinook was returning to the U.S. base at Bagram from a mission in the militant-plagued south when it went down near Ghazni city, 80 miles southwest of the capital, Kabul. 
"Indications are it was bad weather and that there were no survivors," said a U.S. spokes­woman, Lt. Cindy Moore. An Afghan official said there were no signs the craft was shot down. 
A U.S. military statement said 16 deaths had been confirmed and two other people listed on the flight manifest were "unac­counted for" when the recovery operation was suspended at nightfall. 
U.S. officials said the four crew members killed were Americans, but declined to give the national­ities of the passengers. The names of the victims were being withheld pending notification of next of kin. 
Moore said the transport heli­
copter was returning from a 
"routine mission" when con­
trollers lost radio contact. A sec­
ond Chinook made it safely back 
to the sprawling base north of 
Kabul. 
Associated Press Television 
News footage showed dozens of 
Afghan security forces and offi­
cials scurrying round burning 
wreckage. Strong winds that had 
whipped thick dust into the 
darkened sky fanned the flames. 
Abdul Rahman Sarjang, the chief of police in Ghazni, said the helicopter crached about 2:30 
p.m. near a brick factory 3 miles outside the city and burst into flames. U.S. troops rushed to cordon off the area, he said. 
Sarjang said he saw nine bod­ies. "They were all wearing American uniforms and they were all dead," he told The Associated Press by cell phone from the crash site. 
Sarjang said that the weather was cloudy with strong winds and that witnesses reported one of the helicopter's two rotors looked damaged before it hit the ground. He said he saw no.sign of enemy fire, and militants issued no immediate claim of responsibility 
According to U.S. Department of Defense statistics, at least 122 American soldiers had died before Wednesday's incident in and around Afghanistan since Operation Enduring Freedom, the U .S.-led war on terrorism, began after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. 
Accidents have proven almost as deadly as attacks from Taliban-led insurgents, including a string of helicopter crashes and explosions caused by mines and munitions left over from the country's long wars. 
The previous worst incident in Afghanistan was an accidental explosion at an arms dump in Ghazni province that killed eight American soldiers in January 2004. 
Most recently, four U.S. sol­
diers died when a land mine 
exploded under their vehicle 
south of Kabul on March 26. 
Last November, six Americans -three civilian crew members and three U.S. soldiers -died when their plane crashed in the Hindu Kush mountains. The mil­itary's last fatal helicopter crash occurred a month earlier when a pilot was killed in the west of the country. 
About 17,000 U.S. soldiers are 
in Afghanistan battling a 
Taliban-led insurgency and 
training a new Afghan army. 
The top U.S. commander here, 
Lt. Gen. David Barno, told AP on 
Tuesday that the military would 
also now train Afghan police and 
provide intelligence to Afghan 
forces battling the country's 
rampant drug industry.

Celebrities attend Cochran's funeral 

Associated Press 

LOS ANGELES -Johnnie Cochran Jr.'s most celebrated clients, O.J. Simpson and Michael Jackson, joined civil rights figures and Hollywood stars at the lawyer's funeral Wednesday, remembering Cochran's cunning legal skills and his commitment to the peo­ple he represented. 
Cochran, 67, died March 29 of an inoperable brain tumor at his home in Los Angeles. He was diagnosed with the tumor in December 2003. 
"He didn't just love justice or admire justice -he did justice, he achieved justice, he fought for justice, he made it happen," said Mayor James Hahn, the former city attorney and a Cochran friend. 
The Rev. AI Sharpton drew applause fr?m the packed West Angeles Cathedral -a throng that ranged from the Hev. Jesse Jackson to Michael Jackson ­by describing the emotional aftermath of the Simpson trial. 
"We didn't clap when the acquittal of Simpson came for O.J.," Sharpton said. "We were clapping for Johnnie." 
"We were clapping because for decades our brothers, our cousins. our uncles had to stand in the well with no one to stand up for them. And finally a black man came and said, 'If it don't fit -you must acquit,"' Sharpton said, referring to Cochran's famous quote from Simpson's sensational trial about a glove found at the mur­der scene. 
The line drew a roar from the crowd, which also heard from other figures in Cochran's life, including two other members of the Simpson "dream team," Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck. 
The line was on the back ofT­shirts being sold for $10 outside the church. The shirts had a picture of Cochran on the front with the words: "Freedom and justice." 
Colorful and eloquent, Cochran became a legal super­star after helping clear Simpson. 
"Johnnie fought for his clients," Simpson told reporters outside the cathedral. "lie was just a good friend, a good Christian man and a great lawyer." 
Jesse Jac·kson called Cochran "the tallnst tree in our legal for­est. ... Tht> national stagc~ did not make .Johnnie, it revealed him." 
The range of mourners reflected Cochran's work in high-profile civil rights cases and high-glamour trials. Also paying respects were such celebrities as Stevie Wonder and Earvin "Magic" Johnson. 
Neufeld said Cochran's real accomplishments were in civil rights and defending downtrod­den clients: "Johnnie Cochran taught us the importance of doing well by doing good. lie lived it and preached it, and the world is a better place for all of us." 

Percentage of primate 
species may disappear 
Associated Press 

CAPE TOWN, South Africa­Human activities such as hunt­ing and logging have driven nearly one quarter of the world's primate species ­man's closest living relatives -to the brink of extinction, according to a new report. 
Without concerted action, great apes such as the Sumatran orangutan of Indonesia and the Eastern gorilla of central Africa are at risk of disappearing, according to the report to be released Thursday by the World Conservation Union, the International Primatological Society and Conservation International. 
It said Madagascar and Vietnam each have four pri­mates on ·the list of 25 most endangered. Brazil and Indonesia have three. Sri Lanka and Tanzania have with two each. Colombia, China, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda, and Congo have one each. 
"The situation for these pri­mates is down to the wire in terms of extinction," said Russell A. Mittermeier, presi­dent of Conservation International. "If you took all the individuals on the list and gave them a seat in a soccer stadium, they probably would-n't fill it," he said in a tele­phone interview from Madagascar, where primate specialists are meeting. 
While listing 25 species as most endangered, the report said that one in four of the 625 primate species and sub­species are at risk. Fifty experts from 16 countries cited deforestation, commer­cial hunting for meat and the illegal animal trade -includ­ing for use in traditional medi­cines -as the biggest threats. 
The golden-headed langur of Vietnam and China's Hainan gibbon number only in the dozens. The Horton Plains slender loris of Sri Lanka has been seen just four times since 1937. PPrrier's sifaka of Madagascar and the Tana Hiver rc1d colobus of Kenya arc now restricted to tiny patches of tropical f'orest, leaving them vulnerabiP to rapid eradica­tion, the nport said. 
The threat is especially per­ilous in Madagascar, one of the planet's biodiversity hotspots that has lost most of its origi­nal forest cover, the study said. 
"More than half its lemurs, 
none found anywhere else in 
the world, are threatened with 
extinction. Without immediate 
steps to protect these unique 
creatures and their habitat, 
we will lose more of our plan­
et's natural heritage forever." 
Mittermeier said.

Editorial content, including advertisements, is not governed by policies ofthe administration ofeither institution. The Observer reserves the right to refuse 
Schiavo not to be overlooked 
Schiavo is more important than Roe v. Wade. In Roe, the Court can­celled prohibitions of abortion because the Court wrongly said the unborn child is not a person whose life is protected by 
Charles
the Fourteenth 
Rice
Amendment against deprivation by the Right or state. The courts do Wrong? not themselves order abortions. The mother makes that decision. In Schiavo the state itself ordered Terri's execution. As Columbia law professor Michael Dorf commented on U.S. District Judge Whittemore's ruling that there was no state action and therefore no Fourteenth amendment violation, "Judge Greer issued an order instructing Michael Schiavo to remove Terri's feeding tube, even specifying the exact date and time ... The state court did not merely stand idly by while permitting Michael to take such action;.the court ... man­dated the disconnection. That ought to have counted as state action by a state actor." 
In Schiavo, the state itself executed an innocent person without the pro­tections mandated for a defendant accused of capital murder or even of shoplifting. Judge Greer found that Terri was in a persistent vegetative state (PVS), in the face of contrary evidence, and that she would have wanted her tube removed. He relied on Michael's testimony despite Michael's conflicting statements and despite his conflict of interest that should have caused his removal as guardian. The Florida courts deferred robotically to Greer's find­ings which they never would have done in a criminal death penalty case. Nor would a convicted murder­er's desire to die be considered by any court as a justification for sen­tencing him to death. The federal courts refused Terri the stay of exe­cution which is automatic whenever a condemned murderer brings his case from the state courts to a feder­al court. Governor Bush also abdi­cated his responsibility by his defer­ence to Judge Greer. 
Schiavo is important for reasons beyond judicial abuse. Since the Bouvia case in 1986, the law allows a competent adult to starve and dehydrate himself to death. This is a form of suicide. If a person is incom­petent, food and water may legally be withheld from him if there is evi­dence that he would hiwe wanted that withholding or, in some states, if a court decides that the withholding would be in his best interest. Where the family and caregivers agree that food and water should be with­drawn, it is commonly done without court involvement. The intent to deprive a patient permanently of food and water is essentially an intent to kill. In moral terms it is murder. A ben.evolent motive does not change that reality. 
John Paul II said, "the administra­tion of water and food, even ... by artificial means, always [is] a natu­ral means of preserving life, not a medical act." It is "morally obligato­ry" as long as it is achieving its goal of "providing nourishment to the patient and alleviation of his suffer­ing." Food and water do not aim to cure the patient's underlying disease or the suffering caused by it. They sustain biological life, nourish the body, and prevent the suffering of hunger and thirst. "Death by starva­tion or dehydration," said John Paul, "is ... the only possible outcome ... of their withdrawal." 
The only reason anyone heard of Schiavo was because Michael wanted to kill Terri and her parents and sib­lings did not. An impasse arising from such disagreement was inevitable in a legal regime which allows family members, who agree, to kill quietly an incompetent rela­tive. 
In Schiavo, the focus on PVS, including Governor Bush's petition to intervene on the ground that Terri might not have been PVS, generated an inference that an indisputably PVS patient would want to end his life. Schiavo is precedent for courts to order the starvation of PVS patients in reliance on testimony of hostile, court-appointed guardians even against the wishes of family members who want to care for the patient. With diminished public attention, starvation will give way to the painless injection. And the trig­gering disability will drop below PVS. 

In late 1938, the Knauer case, in which Hitler authorized euthanasia of a blind and deformed infant, was the "test case" that "was pivotal for the two killing programs of children and of adults." (Robert Jay Lifton, The Nazi Doctors (1986), 51). Within months the grounds for killing included such defects as cleft palates and "badly modeled ears." Those programs evolved into the Holocaust. 
It is useless to criticize the Schiavo execution by the state of an inno­cent, disabled person without con­fronting the practice that allows family members to starve and dehy­drate an incompetent patient to death when they agree thaJ he would so desire. More basically, Schiavo is a predictable result of the accept­ance of contraception in which man, of both sexes, assumes the role of arbiter of whether and when life shall begin. Inevitably that role will extend to that of arbiter of whether and when life shall end. 
The Nazis, as arbiters of the value and termination of life, brought dis­aster to Germany. Maybe, because we are Americans, God will consent to be mocked indefinitely. But it might not be a good idea to count on it.

Embrace the season 

Thn death of Pope .John Paul II on Saturday has left the world mourning tlw loss of a great man and wonder­ing who will bf' snlnctnd to lead thn Catholic Church at this critical time. Luckily !'or us Amnrieans, however, we have b«>ml handnd a wnkonw distraction from all of our sorrows: tlw start of baseball season. The lirst regular 
season ganw of tho year took place  
in the Bronx on Sunday night, when  Molly Acker  
tho Yanknns upniHIPd their hated rivals, tlw Boston Hod Sox. For most other tnams, hownvnr. Monday after- 1\r l d 1 'k 'vo JO Y ,l es a/Jumb Blonde  
noon marked thn start of t.lw 2005  

campaign. Ballparks <uToss tho nation wnkom11d fans hark to dwnr on tlwir favorite teams and partake in some of Anwriea's most time-honornd traditions. 
It is rathnr appropriate that Major League Baseball raised its eurtain on 2005 just as many of its fans found thnms1~lves in a statn of grin!'. For over 150 years, base­ball has provided Amnricans with wnleomnd relief dur­ing tumultuous limns. Though the gamn is thought to havn bonn inwntnd during the 1 H40s, it was tho Civil War that pPrmittnd it-to flourish, when Union soldiers playnd tlw !{amn as a way to pass tho timn during an otlwrwisn grim pnriod. Similarly, basnball provided rnlief on the homo front during the Second World War. Although gn~at players like Ted Williams had to abandon tlw ganw in onlor to dnf111HI the country, the major leagues gavn Amnrkans an opportunity to rnad about sonwthing otlwr than troop movenwnts and casualties in tlw moming nnwspapnrs. In addition, the war prncipitat­Pd thn formation ol' thn lirst all-liHnale lnagun, which was immortalizml in tho Tom flanks movie A League of tlwir Own. 
1\von wlwn hasohall was not distracting people from tho horrors of war. it still provided poopln with a tmnpo­rary Pseapn from thnir daily lives. In ordnr to appredato hasPball's importance in Amerkan eulturn, one need not to look any further than the way in which we have come to idolize those who play tho gamo. Babe Huth has long boon eonsidnrnd a symbol of the fast-paend, excessive lifnstyln of tho 1920s; Lou Gehrig is lookod upon as a souren of courage and pnrseveranee in the face of a 
hopeless situation; and .Jackie Hobinson's emergence with the Brooklyn Dodgers is heralded as a key moment in the Civil Hights movnment. 
Nowadays peoplo 1mjoy tho games for the samn rna­sons. Although ovnrpaid players, nlevated tieket prices, and steroid scandals may havn caused baseball to lose somn of its innocence, millions of fans still eagerly antici­pate hearing the umpire yell "Play ball" for the first time each year. In my hometown of Chicago, the beginning of the baseball season is always an exeiting time, as the rivalry between the dty's two teams is rem~wed. True basnball fans in the Windy City must choose between the White Sox and the Cubs, and simply "rooting for Chicago" is eomplntely unacceptable. As a popular South Side song reiterates, "And when it comes to basnball, we have two favorite dubs: the Go-Go White Sox and who­ever plays the Cubs!" 
As a White Sox fan. the onset of spring always allows me the opportunity to trash talk some of my North-side rivals. I usually take some time to remind them that the Cubs havn not won a World Series since the Hoosevelt Administration (Theodore Hoosnvolt that is). Also, I usu­ally makn sure that they are aware that llarry Caray spent morn seasons as the Whito Sox announcer than he did as the voice of the Cubs. Finally, I like to point out that, unlike those who flock to Wrigloy Field to simply drink and pnople-wateh, Sox fans aetually go to baseball games in order to watch baseball. 
In addition to somn good naturnd Cubs-bashing, I also enjoy the start ol' baseball season bocauso it allows me to bnconw macquaintnd with many of the institutions that have become a part of my White Sox experiem~es. Certainly, I always enjoy ballpark food, and U.S. Cellular Field has some ol' the best in basoball. In addition to sta­ples sueh as hot dogs, pretzels and popeorn, "the Cell" also has great pizza, curly fries and churros. 
In addition to the great cuisine, I also look forward to hearing the familiar tunc of the ballpark organ. On the South Side, Naney Faust has boen the White Sox organist for several docades, and she has become a sort of local eelebrity. In addition to thn always liuniliar, "Take Me Out to the Ball (;;um~." she also plays classic tunes sut'h as "Hunaround Sun," "My Kind of Town" and "Na Na llny lley Kiss llim (;oodbye," whieh has been adoptnd as tho unollieial fight song of tlw White Sox. 

While the food and music always add to tho ballpark experience, my personal favorite aspect of Whitn Sox games is sadly no longer with us. From the I1J(>0s until the 1990s, a man known as "Andy the Clown" bm:anw a fixture on tho South Side. Nnvnr nmploynd by the team, Andy was simply a !'an who would attnnd nvnry homo game drnssed in a cheap down suit, with a light-up nose, and a bowling hat. In addition to his fnstivn appearance he would also kind ol' sing out his cheers. lin became famous for his battle ery, "C'mooooooooooon you White Sox."

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
It could be worse 


I am writing to respond to a Iotter written by Duncan Melntyre entitled "Cable creates dis­tractions," which was printed on April 6. Thorn is one line in the letter that I would specifically like to analyze. Mr. Melntyre states, "I would likn to put forward the opin­ion that providing cable in the dorms would be the worst thing that could possibly happen to this University." I have come up with examples that, in my humble opinion, are elearly worse than Notre Damn providing eablc in the dorms. 
I. The radiation building explodes causing studonts to snnk refuge at either Saint Mary's or Stepan Cnnter. 
2. 
A plague of locusts mysteriously descends upon campus and infests every elassroom building to bn~ed. 

3. 
In a frnak accident, the scaffolding over the dome collapses and turns a $500,000 ren­ovation into a $10 million rebuilding process. 

4. 
;\ rnntnor the size of a Volkswagon collides into DeBartolo llall during peak elass time. 

5. 
Pownr gons out in Michigan and northern Indiana for the remainder of the semester, causing studnnts and teachors alike to resort to using typewriters to type final papers and nxams. 

6. 
The administration decides to cancel this ynar's comnwncement cnremonios due to a "laek of enthusiasm." 

7. 
Notre Dame professors begin a strike which thny elaim will last until the next Notre Dame football championship. 


H. A draught causos St. Mary's and St. .Joseph's lakos to dry up. 
9. 
Father Poorman establishes a new posi­tion for the University ontitled Spiritual Advisor and appoints Michael Jackson an unconditional spot there for the remainder of his tenure. 

10. 
All Notre Dame alumni stop donating money, forever. 


The scenarios I just described may be outra­geous, but they are not as ridiculous as a col­lege graduate believing that putting cable into dorm rooms is the worst possible thing that uould happen to a school. This will be my last semester living on campus, so this decision will have little if any effect on me personally. However, I believe that asking the administra­tion to put cable in the dorms is not asking too much. The majority of schools that are similar to ours as far as tradition and demographies are concerned already have provided cable to their students living on campus. The imple­mentation of cable in the dorms would almost eliminate the usage of satellites that litter the exteriors of many dorms and provide an opportunity to get a decent number of chan­nels for students living in dorms which pro­hibit the use of satellites. If television is such a big distraction for students who are already very busy with classes and extracurricular activities, it ean be turned ofT. Let individuals decide how they want to spend their time.

Individual responsibility 
The University of Oklahoma is experimenting with the 1920s all over again. That's right: Prohibition. It seems that OU is not the only campus to dry out, either. In fact, many universities around the nation are banning the bottlo. 
But why? Well, it seems that our univorsities are full of idioL-;. Aetually, allow me to darify. Our universi­ties are full of two kinds of' idioL-;. Jonas 
The first type eonsisL-; of binge drinkers. Hogg These arc the people whose sole purpose 
Kansas State 

is to consume as much of the cheapest 
llnicwrsity

booze around in the shortest possibln time. 
Collegian

It seems that-surprise, surprise-these people are starting to turn up dead on an increasingly frequent basis. 
Obviously, if you arn one of the people who believe "one drink is good, so 100 must be the eat's meow," then you are failing on the smart scale. Buzzzzz! No gene passing li1r you, plant food! 
The seeond group of idioL-; are those "in power," who are choosing to punish an entire student body due to the irresponsi­bility of a handful of people. Beeauso, everyone knows, if' you have a problem, just pass a new law. After all, the 1 Hth Amendment-prohibition-solved all sorb of problmns. 
This llat ban simply begs the question, why should Billy Hay be punished just because Amy Sue is a dolt and drank lwrsnlf' to death? 
Tho answer is that even though Billy Hay didn't ewm know Amy Sue, he must have been, through some bizarre aligning of the planets, part of the problem that caused Amy Sue to die. 
Although the f(mnders of this eountry seemed to bn a big fan of' personal rosponsibility, it is refreshing to see that sud1 an out­moded and defunct value has not stuck around to plague us. After all, personal responsibility would dictate that I, personally, should bo mindful of how mueh I'm drinking. 
But cropping up as a solution to that pesky rnsponsibility prob­lem is the good old notion of "punish everybody." 
So here's a solution. For the drinker: Don't be a moron. I don't care how badly you want to lit in or be cool. Anyone trying to get you to stick a funnel in your mouth to force-fend you alcohol is an idiot. If you follow thnm, then you'rn twice the idiot. ldioL-; don't get to pass on their genes, and you'll generally find that a drink or two will work just line, leaving you with a much dnaror head and many fewer questions the next morning. 
For the authorities: Leave me alone.

CONCERT REVIEW 
In Chicago
Bob Dylan shines  
By JULIE BENDER Scene Music Critic 
"The poet laureate of' rock 'n' roll. The voice of the promise of the '60s counter­culture. The guy who forced folk into bed with rock, who donned makeup in the '70s and disappeared into a haze of substance abuse, who emerged to 'lind .Jesus,' who was written off as a has­been by the end of the '80s, and who suddenly shifted gears and released some of the strongest music of his career beginning in the late '90s." 
Ladies and gentlemen, please wel­come Columbia recording artist Bob Dylan. 
With these words, pop music critic Jeff Miers summed up the unpredictable life of Bob Dylan in a feature story that appeared in The Buffalo News in August 2002. Apparently, Bob Dylan liked this quick summation of his life so much, he now uses it as his introduction at every concert he performs -and he certainly performs. 
Embarking on what has become known as his "Never-Ending Tour" in 1988, Dylan has played a constant stream of shows on and off throughout the world. This past week Dylan and his six-piece entourage added five more dates to the Never-Ending Tour, stop­ping in Chicago at the Auditorium Ballroom Sunday night. 
Though Dylan will be 64 this May, he never seems to tire of his life on the road, and this is a blessing for his devot­ed fans in Chicago who attended Sunday ni'ght's concert. 
Anticipation was high after the open­ing acts, Amos Lee and Merle Haggard, but when Dylan finally took the stage, he left no one disappointed. He kicked things into high gear immediately with an electrified version of "Drifter's Escape," from his 1967 album "John Wesley Harding," and then settled into the haunting "Senor" from Street Legal. Both songs have appeared in set lists regularly on this leg· of the tour. The songs created an appropriate introduc­tion to what the rest of the night veld in store. 
Dylan remained fixed behind his elec­tric piano for most of the evening, allow­ing his band -supplied with a fiddle and a pedal steel guitar -to shine musically. Dressed in all black with his signature (as of late) black cowboy hat, Dylan spurred on the show with periodic harmonica solos that rang with clarity throughout the ballroom. 
The most endearing quality of the per­formance was Dylan's voice. Often ridiculed for his lack of vocal expertise, in recent years, Dylan has changed his voice yet again, differentiating its sound from that on former recordings. On Sunday. he almost seemed to hiss and growl into his microphone as he maneu­vered his gravelly voice through the words he has made so famous. What the vocals lacked in beauty and finesse, they made up for in passion and charm. 
Perhaps thl~ best monient of the night 
·was when Dylan slowed things down with a poignant rendition of "Don't Think Twice, It's Alright." A folk dassic he penned in 1963, "Don't Think Twice" has a startling beauty with its sweet melody and bitter-tinged lyrics. On Sunday night, the band gave this nor­mally sparse song a full instrumental backing, which -combined with Dylan's harmonica -left the audience in silent awfl. 
For the remainder of the show, Dylan coursed through various components of his repertoire, including a raucous ver­sion of "Highway 61 Revisited," the love­ly "Shooting Star" and his protest-era classic, "A Hard Rain's A Gonna Fall." 
As the concert came to its close, Dylan left the stage without a word only to return minutes later to deliver his encore. Delighting fans of his 1960s songs, Dylan nudged into a gentle ren­dition of "I Shall Be Released." The song found a new meaning as Dylan's vocals hummed an aged wisdom: "I see my light come shining, from the west down to the east I Any day now, any day now, I shall be released." 
Ending the night in true rock 'n' roll fashion was a song off the same album as the opener -"All Along the Watchtower." Although originally an acoustic number, Dylan took elements from Jimi Hendrix's electric version of the song and sent charged vibes through his haunting lyrics. Turning from growl to howl by the ending chord, Dylan left

the stage in Chicago to a standing ova­tion as though this were his last per­formance on a farewell tour. 
Of course, with show dates lined up long into the future, fans know that for­tunately, there is no end in sight for the original Song and Dance Man on his "Never-Ending Tour."

ALBUM REVIEW 
Nanook's naivete a sincere delight 
By MATTHEW SOLARSKI Scene Music Critic 
At the imaginary "37th Annual Concept Album Awards Ceremony in the Sky" (affectionately known as "The Tommies"), Nanook of the North's "The Tiiby Tapes" would have glaciered over the competition and emerged with more awards -bronzed miniature pinball machines, naturally -than there are Inuit words for snow. The Swedish act would have garnered "most whimsical concept," "most far­fetched concept," "most ridiculous concept that actually kinda works somehow," and, most notably, "the Honorary Bono Award for Unabashed Idealism" for the endearingly naive track "Israel and Palestine -a Solution." 
As far as concept records go, Nanook's resides in a class all its own. Invoking the title character of Robert Flaherty's celebrated 1922 quasi-docu­mentary "Nanook of the North," multi­instrumentalists Mattias Olsson and Olle Soderstrom weave a loose narra­tive across 12 tracks that takes Nanook from the Canadian Arctic to the sterile Stockholm suburb Tiiby. Along the way, Nanook joins a band, fights a dragon, outdoes the Camp David Accords, duets with several of Sweden's finest female vocalists of the 1980s and debates the verity of love in postmodern suburbia. Bizarre? Certainly. Ridiculous? Perhaps. Entirely unique and oddly enchanting? 


Quite. 
Nanook excels on the songcraft front. However outlandish the subject matter, the songs on "The Tiiby Tapes" remain fun and accessible and abound in a certain wistful vitality. Olsson and Soderstrom utilize a smorgasbord of instruments, some of which are possi­bly made-up, including guitars, key­boards, accordions, theremin, orche­stron, optigan, omnichord, stylophone, and percussion. With such an impres­sive musical arsenal comes substantial risk of meandering, ennui-inducing arrangements or needless instrumen­tal flourishes, but Nanook showcases crisp refinement throughout, with a refreshing hint of lo-fi. 
What distinguishes Nanook and makes "The Tiiby Tapes" so richly affecting, however, is the vocal inter­play between Nanook and his coterie of female duet partners. Olsson and Soderstrom construct many of the lyri­cal passages in call-and-response fash­ion, carving rather telling roles for the male and female voices and creating some often fascinating dialogue. 
On "Karin Boye's Grave,'' vocalist Camela Leierth embodies the ghost of Karin. She and Nanook alternate, "We would have loved your style I I would have loved to be alive I ... I could have held your hands I you could have played in our band" and then harmo­nize, proclaiming, "we could have spread revolution through this land." Despite an upbeat arrangement, the 

conditional perfect tense lends this track an air of melancholy, along the lines of Hemingway's famous "isn't it pretty to think so?" 
Also fabulous is "St. George and the Dragon," where Irma Schultz plays the misunderstood mythical beast to Nanook's brazenly self-righteous St. George. "So you think I'm just the vii-. !age moron?" the latter taunts, "we'll ponder that when you go down." The song's closing exchange reveals Nanook may not be so naive after all -Nanook begins, with Schultz responding, ''I'm bound to be a hero I but I am unarmed I easier for me then I but I'm just a girl I wen: I will tell nothing of that to the world." 
Nanook of the North's many talents culminate and coalesce on "Forget it Jenny, Love is Just a Privilege for the Rich,'' the album's final track. Here, Nanook becomes the jaded postmodern lover who rationalizes the futility of love in sublimely witty fashion: "love is just a privilege for the rich, you see I cause love requires time I and time is money." Vocalist Malin Olofsson retorts, "No! Love is universal to humanity I it gets to you no matt'er of economy." "Forget it" climaxes in a chorus of Ia Ia Ia's -a fittingly ambiguous conclusion to a record that succeeds on so many contradictory lev­els.

ALBUM REVIEW 
'Everything's OK' with AI Green 
1\y 1\ECCA SAUNDERS Assisranr Scent Editor 
AI c;rePn has finally returrwd. 
Although tlw Hnverend AI Creon has not bonn in tlw businnss of real soul musk sinc1~ tho mid-70s, he has finally rntunwd to full form in his nnwnst album. "1\vnrything's OK." Tho latest album is produ1~ed by Willie Mitchell, tho producer Croon workod with in tho nal'ly 70s wlwn lw namnd his tilln as -a1~cording to many listnnnrs -the first roal soul artist. The two worknd togotlwr on a 2003 album eallod "I Can't Stop," but many critics felt tho album was weighed down by Grnnn's dnsirn to hold onto the spiritual and gospel nlnments in its music. "1\vmything's OK" suffers from no such ailrrwnl. c;renn has officially risen from the depths of gospel musie and is soulfully singing at the hnight of his talent. 
Green is a man with a rich and inter­esting history. Arter rising to fame in th1~ oarly 1970s with his soul hits, Gn~nn's earner took a sovnre swnrve at tho height of his fame in 1974. Mary Woodson, one of Groen's ox-girlfriends broke into his homo and poured boil­ing grits on (;reon while he was bathing, causing severo buns on his baek, stomaeh and arms before shoot­ing herself. This ineidnnt was inter­protect by Green as a sign from God that he should go into ministry. Thus hn bought a church, bncame a pastor and, although he released other albums during that time period, never bncame as popular as he once was. 
"Everything's OK" is a reminder of what AI Green was and what he still is. 


Green's voice does not seem to have aged a day with his falsetto still pierc­ing the beats of many of the songs. The album makes one feel like he has stepped back into the best part of 70s and it is hard to do anything but enjoy it. 
While the title track is probably the single best song on "Everything's OK," there are many other high points on this generally solid album. There is not a bad song on "Everything's OK," but there are some better ones, such as, "Build Me Up" and the new renditions of the past hits "Perfect to Me," "You Are So Beautiful" and "Real Love." Green transforms the over-popularized song "You Are So Beautiful" into the best and most passionately believable version ever sung. With a good mix of upbeat and deeply soulful songs, "Everything's OK" makes for an album that one can simply listen to again and again. 


There is no q uostion that "Everything's OK" in the musical world of the Heverend AI Green -everything is terrific. Although tho album is a bit stacked with the best songs on the first half of the track list, the entire album reveals the Groen that fans and those who do not know that they are fans yet have waited more than 30 years for. Thank the Lord -tho Heverond is back.

SINGLES RouNDUP 
Aberdeen's heartfelt pop never cloys 
By MATTHEW SOLARKSI Scent Musir Critic 
Few worthwhile romances begin in whirlwind. Horneo-and-Juliet fashion. Usually, a chance encounter will fostnr a sublln liking, which over time may evolve into a mutual allinity, which in those few ran~ and wonderful cases, blossoms into f'ull-flmlg11d amoro. When love works. it is bneause the bnloved in quostion gradu­ally grow upon one another where other suitors have dazzlod for a brief time and swiftly lizzll~d. Thn songs on Abordnen's nnw single operate in very much tho samn manner as tho love that works. 
Whornas most pop has the tendency to grate, achieving optimal potency around the fourth or fifth listen and careening downhill forever thereafter, Aberdeen's brand of pop makes a dramatically dif­ferent ascent. The three songs on "Florida" may strike the listener as unexceptional at first-and this is good, as successive listens will reveal the songs' nuances and nndearing qualities that the casual pop aficionado may have missed. 

"Florida" opens with the title track, a sophisticated number featuring the vocals of John (Aberdeen's press materi­als expressly omit surnames), that culmi­nates with an exalted "don't fall in love I don't ever break my heart." The second song, "Late Bloomer," linds John paired with primary Aberdeen vocalist Beth. The third and perhaps finest track draws lyrical inspiration from Haruki Murakami's "Norwegian Wood" and fea­tures Beth on vocals once again. She asks, "Did it snow the day she left? I Cherry blossoms caught the blood that foil." Lyrics like these haunt the listener long after the music has faded into obliv­ion, retaining the same understated pull as that lover who becomes something more. 
Longtime Aberdeen fans may be dis­mayed somewhat by the relative lack of jangle on this release, as the combo sound increasingly like brother band Tn~mbling Blue Stars here, but the wist­fully romantic essence of' Aberdeen remains quite intact. 
B-sldes, guests redeem Esthero's tardy tirade 
Canadian chanteuse Esthero has an odd history of tardiness. Her debut, 1999's hypnotie "Broath From Another", arrived with a whisper several years after trip-hop had faded from the main­stream music consciousness. While an uneven effort overall, "Breath" boasted a handful of exceptional tracks, includ­ing the brass-tinged "That Girl" and the neo-murder ballad "Heaven Sent." The latter saw an iota of MTV airplay thanks in large part to its haunting video inspired by Luis Bufiuel and Salvador Dali's avant-garde milestone "Un Chien Andalou." 
Fast-forward to late 2004, and Esthero has resurfaced at long last to deliver, or all things, a hackneyed diatribe against the sorry state of the music industry. On "We H in Need of' a Musical Hevolution" the lady prattles, ''I'm so sick and tired of the !bad music] on the radio I MTV they only play the same thing I no matter where I go I see Ashanti in the video I I want something more." Her plea is indeed valid, but such quality-mongering reached its peak during the same late 1990s that nearly swallowed Esthero for good. And besides, the state of music production has never been better. Our chanteuse should curb her frustration and invest in an iPod. 
Graciously, the other five songs on this

comeback EP strike a morn consonant chord. Esthero puts herself' in good eom­pany, collaborating with Soan Lnnnon on the bouncy piano-eenternd romp "Every Day Is A Holiday (With You)," and with the mighty Cee-Lo Green on the H&B-fla­vornd "Gone." The trun payoiT, howevnr, comes iri the form of "Arnbnr and Tiger's Eye," the EP's dosing track, and a mes­merizing, string-laden midnight dril'tnr. Esthoro's voien. a rich and sultry high alto, manages to transcend anything it says, and the top-notch production rounds out an overall pleasurable pack­age.

MLB -AMERICAN LEAGUE 


ChiSox rally, edge Indians behind 4-run 9th 
Konerko, Dye both homer as White Sox win second straight 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Bob Wickman was consistent: Pretty much everything he threw turned into a hit. 
Paul Konerko and Jermaine Dye hit consecutive home runs off Wickman as the Chicago White Sox rallied with four runs in the ninth inning Wednesday to beat the Cleveland Indians 4-3. 
"He just didn't have it today," Cleveland manager Eric Wedge said. "The ball was up a little bit and a couple of good hitters got on them." 
Kevin Millwood pitched six scoreless innings in his debut for the Indians but was done in by Wickman {0-1 ), who inherit­ed a 3-0 lead from Arthur Rhodes and was trying to com­plete a five-hit shutout. Wickman allowed hits to his first four batters over a span of just eight pitches, then made an error. 
Wickman was the Indians' most reliable reliever last year in his second stint as their clos­er. l-Ie had saved 12 in a row stretching to last season. 
"I throw strikes and today, 
obviously,  it  hurt  me,"  
Wickman said.  
Carl Everett took a  strike,  

then singled, and Konerko homered to left on a 1-0 pitch. After swinging and missing the next pitch, Dye homered to left­center to tie it. 
"In that situation his job is to come. after me and throw a strike, make me swing the bat," Konerko said. ''I'm not trying to hit a home run. I'm just trying to get a base hit and keep the rally going." 
Aaron Rowand took a ball, then doubled, and A.J. Pierzynski was intentionally walked. 
Pinch-hitter Willie Harris' bunt was misplayed by Wickman for an error that loaded the bases, and Juan Uribe flied to right as Rowand tagged up and scored from third to win the game on the sacrifice fly. 
Chicago had 46 comeback wins last year, including four after trailing in the ninth inning. 
"We've got a group of guys just like last year," Harris said. "We're not going to roll over." 
Damaso Marte (1-0) got the last two outs in the top of the ninth for the win. 
"Winning a game like this where we hadn't swung real well in two days, I think it got the guys pumped up," Chicago 

CLASSIFIEDS 
manager Ozzie Guillen said. "I bet they can't wait for tomor­row to start." 
Signed to a $7 million, one­year contract during the off­season, Millwood allowed four hits, struck out one and walked two as his fastball reached 94 mph. He was trying for his 99th career win, his first in the American League. 
"Nothing was working a lot," Millwood said. "I didn't locate very well at all. It just seemed like I was able to make a pitch when I needed to, and that kind of got me through it." 
Last year, he went 9-6 with a 
4.85 ERA for Philadelphia, and the condition of his elbow was a concern to the Indians, who put special clauses in his con­tract to reduce their risk. 
Freddy Garcia, acquired by Chicago from Seattle last sea­son, gave up two runs and five hits in six innings, struck out six and walked three. He threw 109 pitches. 
Cleveland went ahead in the second when Grady Sizemore singled and scored on a Ronnie Belliard double. Garcia walked Victor Martinez in the third, and he took third on Ben Broussard's double and scored on a balk. 
Boston 7, NY Yankees 3 
NEW YOHK -The Boston Red Sox pulled off another comeback against Mariano Rivera, then turned their thoughts to Terry Francona. 
Playing without their ailing manager, the Hed Sox rallied for five runs off Rivera in the ninth inning -helped by Alex Rodriguez's costly error -and beat New York Wednesday to avoid a season-opening sweep. 
Francona was taken to a hos­pital in the morning with tight­ness in his chest. He was rest­ing there comfortably awaiting test results, the team said. Bench coach Brad Mills filled in for him. 
"We're just concerned about Tito and what's going on," Mills said. "They're a great bunch of guys, a great bunch of coaches, and they did a great job." 
Derek Jeter left the game after he was hit in the helmet by a pitch and was taken to a hospital for a precautionary CT scan. The results were normal and Jeter was expected to play Friday night against Baltimore, the Yankees said. 
The teams play three more games next week at Fenway Park beginning with Boston's home opener Monday, when the Red Sox will receive their World Series rings. 
"It was a huge win to get us on the board," Boston knuckle­bailer Tim Wakefield said. 
Rodriguez and Tino Martinez homered for the Yankees, who went ahead in the eighth with­out a hit. Gary Sheffield drove in the tiebreaking run with a sacrifice fly. 


Rivera entered in the ninth with a 3-2 lead for the second consecutive day and blew it again. He issued a leadoff walk to Bill Mueller before consecu­tive singles by Mark Bellhorn and Johnny Damon loaded the bases with none out. 
"Even though I walked Mueller, I made my pitches," Rivera said. "After that, I was getting groundballs that were 
going  through  the  holes.  
There's nothing you  can do  
against that. I'm fine."  

After Trot Nixon struck out, Manny Ramirez hit a routine grounder to Rodriguez at third. He should have been able to get at least a force play at the plate and possibly a game-end­ing double play, but he bobbled the ball and the tying run scored. 
"When I went down with two hands, I think I locked myself up," Rodriguez said. "I was going to go to second before the bobble. Then I knew I still had Bill Mueller at home, but then I bobbled it again." 
David Ortiz drove in the go­ahead run with a dribbler to the right side, and Edgar Renteria made it 6-3 with a two-run single. 

After walking Doug Mirabelli, Hivera was lifted -a rare sight. He walked off the mound to a healthy dose of boos, but he thought those must have come from Red Sox fans. 
"I think it's inexcusable if the boos were from Yankee fans because they wouldn't be crawling all over themselves to get into this ballpark if it weren't for him," New York manager Joe Torre said. 
Pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre had a similar reac­tion. 
"I was very surprised by that. Everything he's done here and in this ballpark, I was shocked. But that's New York," Stottlemyre said. 
The final run scored on Felix Hodriguez's wild pitch. 
Rivera (1-1) allowed five runs -one earned -and three walks in two-thirds of an inning. He also gave up three hits and threw 38 pitches. 
"I don't want to say he lost his cool, but he definitely lost his command," Stottlemyre said. 
The All-Star closer has blown his last four save chances against the Hed Sox, including two in the 2004 playoffs, and six opportunities in all against Boston since the start of last season. 
lie yielded Jason Varitek's tying homer in the ninth on Tuesday, but Jeter bailed out Rivera with a game-winning homer in the bottom half. 
"Yesterday's game had noth­ing to do with today," Rivera said. 
Mike Timlin (1-0) got two outs for the win. His first pitch hit Jeter in the left shoulder and then deflected off his ear flap, knocking Jeter's helmet off and sending him sprawling to the dirt. 
He remained in the game to run the bases, but was replaced at shortstop by Rey Sanchez in the ninth. 
"He heard some ringing in his ears. He felt a little woozy," Torre said. "Timlin wasn't try­ing to hit him. He was just try­ing to rush a little, and his ball was all over the place." 
The Red Sox got a strong out­ing from Wakefield, who allowed only three hitsin 6 2-3 
innings  - including  solo  
homers  by  Rodriguez  and  
Martinez.  

Making his first start of the year, Mike Mussina gave up nine hits but worked out of trouble. Helped by three dou­ble plays, he limited the Red Sox to two runs in six innings. Kevin Millar's two-run single gave Boston the lead in the fourth.

Righifielder Carlos 
Lee homers, drives in four runs in victory 
Associated Press 
PITTSBUHGII -Brewers manager Ned Yost insisted all spring his offense is much improved, especially with Carlos Lee batting cleanup. Yost has some believers now, many in his o.wn clubhouse. 
Lee homered and drove in four runs in his first big game since an offseason tradn and Doug Davis pitched eiTnctively over six innings in the Brewers' seeond rout of' the Pirates in as many games, a 10-2 decision Wednesday. 
"So far, so good," Lee said after Milwaukee outscored Pittsburgh 19-4 in the two­game series. "We're doing a good job with defense, pitch­ing and we're getting some key hits, big base hits, and that's the way we have to play." 
The Brewers dealt popular leadoff hitter Scott Podsednik and reliever Luis Vizcaino to the White Sox for Lee in a deal that wasn't popular with some Brewers fans, but it probably looks a lot better to them now. 
"That's why we got him, that's why he's in middle of lineup," Davis said. "(As a pitcher), you can't lay one in there and expect him to get himself out. You take a look at our lineup, and it's totally dif­ferent." 
Lee hit a two-run double off Kip Wells (0-1) in a four-run first that had some of the 12,077 fans booing even before Pittsburgh batted, then hit a solo homer leading ol'f the fifth. Lee also had a run­scoring grounder in the sixth against reliever John Grabow. 
If the Brewers were looking for a positive start al'ter drop­ping 94 games during a 12th 
consecutive losing season  in  
2004, they got it in  one  of  
their least-favorite eities.  

They went 6-12 against the Pirates last year and, going into the series, wore 11-26 in Pittsburgh since PNC Park opened in 2001. 
They hadn't won back-to­back there sinee April 8-9, 2003, a span of 16 games, before following up Monday's 9-2 vietory with an even more one-sided win. 
"It's big to eome in here and win a couple of' games from those guys," said Junior Spivey, who had three extra­base hits after striking out four times Monday. "They have good pitchers, a good staff and a young team. It was good to get going against this team." 
The Pirates are 0-2 for the first time since 2000 and now seem as eager to get out of Pittsburgh as they were to get there following seven weeks of spring training. 
They start a seven-game trip Thlll·sday in San Diego. 
"It's still only two games, and two games at the begin­ning don't count any more than two games at the end," Matt Lawton said. "When it starts to get deeper is when you start to press." 
Manager Lloyd McClendon, who hoped a good start would elevate the confidence of his relatively young team, said, "You always want to play well here. But it's only two games, it's not tlw end of the world." 

Wells, nrratie during spring training, constantly lel't his pitches over the plate as five of' the first seven Brewers bat­ters nHtehnd base. 
Spivey doubled and Lyle Overbay walked ahead of Lee's double in the first, and Hussoll Branyan followed threo batters later with a two­run double. Spivey added a solo homer in the fourth and a double in the sixth. 
"To givn them a 4-0 lead right out of the gatn, I didn't give us much of' a chance," Wells said. 
Wells lastnd five innings, giving up six hits and six runs while walking five. 
"lie wa~n't very good," McClendon said. "lie got his pitches up and it was not a good outing." 
The left-handed hitting Branyan is nxpeded to get the majority of starts at third base, but didn't start the opener so the right-handed hitting Jeff Cirillo eould faen Pirates left-hander Oliver Perez. Cirillo responded with a double and homnr. 
Davis was much more ef'f'ec­tive than Wells, allowing two hits over five shutout innings ahead of Tike Hedman's two­run homer in the sixth. Davis gave up four hits and two runs and struck out five over six. 
Likn opening-day starter Ben Sheets, Davis is expected to start throe timns in the Brnwers' f'irst 10 games because the team has thriHl off-days during the f'irst two weeks of the season.

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Chest pains forced Terry Francona into a hospital Wednesday. How soon the Boston manager returns to his team remains to be seen. 
Francona was taken by ambulance to New York Weill-Cornel! Medical Center in Manhattan after experiencing chest tight­ness in the morning. He underwent a variety of tests and then listened on the radio as the Red Sox rallied for a 7-3 victory over the Yankees, their first win of the season. 
Red Sox spokesman Glenn Geffner said 
Francona, who turns 46 on April 22, was scheduled to be transferred Wednesday night to Boston, where he will remain under the supervision of team doctor Thomas Gill. 
The Red Sox, meanwhile, were off to Toronto to open a series against the Blue Jays on Friday. 
"Tito has meant so much to this whole team," center fielder Johnny Damon said. "He's the guy that would go to battle for you." 
The Red Sox would not specify what Francona was tested for or any results. 
General manager Theo Epstein informed the team of Francona's situation in a very brief meeting after the second Red Sox bus arrived at Yankee Stadium around 10:30 a.m. He then went to the hospital and spent the game with Francona. 

Francona came to Boston with a reputation for being too nice and letting players take advantage of him. But the Red Sox responded to his easygoing personality and gelled into a raucous bunch that brought Boston its first World Series title in 86 years. 
With Francona in the hospital, the Red Sox band-· ed together in the collegial manner that made them champions. 
"I almost needed a bed next to Tito," acting man­ager Brad Mills said jok­ingly of the tense game. "[The win] was a lot to do with the guys focused on what they have to accom­plish." 
Damon said during the game players asked the trainers, including Jim Rowe, who accompanied the manager and returned to the ballpark, about Francona but they "didn't give us any until after the game." 
The Red Sox were upbeat after their ninth-inning comeback, yet there was little of the boisterous rev­elry common from the team that dubbed them­selves Idiots during the playoffs last season. 
IN BRIEF 
Myskina advances, Molik 
upset at Bausch & Lomb 
AMELIA ISLAND, Fla. -Anastasia Myskina survived a three-set match with unseeded Shahar Pner of Israel to advance to the round of 16 Wednesday at the Bausch & Lomb Championships. 
While the third-seeded Myskina advanced, Virginia Razzano posted the tournament's first surprise, upsetting No. 9 ranked Alicia Molik, 6-4, 6-4. 
Myskina, ranked No. 6 in the world, defeated Peer, ranked 112, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3. 
Serena Williams played Dally Randriantefy later Wednesday. _ 
Myskina rolled through the first set in 20 minutes, holding her service at love in her first three serves and breaking Peer's serve at love in the eighth game. 
The second set was nothing like the first. Peer broke Myskina in the first and third games and held her own service twice to jump out to a 4-0 lead en route to a win. 

"I played really well that first set, but then I got a little bored," Myskina said. Baylor welcomes home national champions 
WACO -The crowd was already in a frenzy, having been introduced to ali but one of the Baylor players. Then senior Steffanie Blackmon emerged from behind a curtain hoist­ing the NCAA championship trophy. 
Flashbulbs lit up the arena Wednesday, and more than 7,000 fans screamed even louder in appre­ciation of the prize a well-deserved shining moment for the university and the town. 
"This is a women's basketball championship," coach Kim Mulkey­Robertson said. "But it's bigger than that. It is a Baylor national champi­onship." 
The Lady Bears (33-3) won their first national title with an 84-62 win over Michigan State on Monday night. 
Pirates minor leaguers fail 
drug tests 
PITTSBURGH -Three Pittsburgh Pirates minor leaguers were sus­pended Wednesday for failing drug tests last year, with Triple-A pitcher Brian Mallette drawing a 30-game penalty as a two-time offender. 
Outfielder Jon Nunnally, also with Pittsburgh's Indianapolis farm team, was given a 15-game suspension as a first offender, as was infielder Tom Evans, who plays for Double-A Altoona. 
Mallette and Nunnally were with other organizations when the tests were conducted before signing minor league contracts with Pittsburgh. Both attended the Pirates' spring training camp as non-roster players but did not make the opening-day roster. 
Evans is the only Pirates farmhand to date to fail a drug test, though results of tests conducted this year among Florida-based spring training teams have not been released.

Pettitte leads Astros to their first victory 
THE MASTERS 

Mickelson looks to repeat 
Tiger's still drawing crowds, but others demand attention 
Associated Press 
AUGUSTA, Ga. -A half­dozen grown men were walk­ing along the 11th fairway Wednesday morning when they scampered into the woods and huddled around a golf ball, gawking as though it were a meteorite that descended onto Augusta National. 
They kneeled over and held their cameras inches from the ball -a swoosh on the right side and "TIGER" print­ed on the top -and clicked away. Other fans came over and started passing the men their cameras for more pic­tures. 
And it was only a golf ball. 
The guy who hit the tee shot some 50 yards off line ­right of the trees, right of the gallery and into a small forest of Georgia pines -never showed up. A marshal even­tually broke up the crowd and heaved the ball to Woods' caddie. 
Tiger Woods is used to this kind of star treatment at Augusta National, where he shattered scoring records as a 21-year-old and already had three green jackets by the time he was 26. 
But he no longer is the main event. 
Phil Mickelson is the defending champion when the 69th Masters begins Thursday, and many believe he is primed to join Woods, 

Nick Faldo and Jack Nicklaus as the only back-to-back win­ners of a green jacket. 
His victory Monday in the BellSouth Classic was his third of the year. And his con­fidence soars even higher just driving down Magnolia Lane, walking upstairs to the cham­pions locker room, being on a golf course where a year ago he birdied five of the last seven holes to capture his first major. 
"Being able to come through when I needed to gives me a little of extra con­fidence," Mickelson said. 
Vijay Singh is No. 1 in the world, and has been for all but two weeks in March. And while his only victory this year came in the second week of the season, he is the only player who seems to be around the top of the leader­board no matter where he plays. 
"Vijay is the one that is playing the best at the moment," Sergio Garcia said. 
Ernie Els is seeking redemption at Augusta National. Retief Goosen is seeking recognition. 
Those two South Africans, along with Mickelson and Singh, all have won majors in the nearly three years since Woods last captured a covet­ed Grand Slam event. 
"If you look at guys who are at the top in the world rank­ing, and the guys who have won major championships, you know they can handle the heat," Woods said. "You know they're not going to make a mistake." 
He hasn't had this much 
competition since winning the first of his eight majors at Augusta National in 1997. 
On perhaps the most famous stage in golf, the lat­est battle begins to unfold Thursday with a Masters that is being billed more as a free­for-all than a heavyweight prize fight. 
And while top players are getting most of the attention, another familiar theme threatened to intervene. 
A line of violent thunder­storms began working its way toward Augusta National even as the undercard -the Par 3 Tournament -was being held Wednesday. 
Weather already has inter­rupted play in eight of 14 tournaments, and one fore­cast said the course could get as much as an inch of rain about the time the Masters gets under way. 
"See you Friday," Woods said jokingly as he left the course after a nine-hole prac­tice round, knowing that his 
1:33 p.m. starting time might be pushed back. 
Perhaps the adage this year will be the Masters doesn't start until the back nine Monday. 
If nothing else, rain figures to soften an Augusta National course that has been firm, fiery, fast and frightening, with players remarking they had never seen the greens this fast so early in the week. 
That could be an advantage for the longer hitters, although accuracy is under­rated at the Masters. And to see Woods send his tee shot on the 11th hole so far to the right only raises more ques­tions about his game.

HOUSTON -Andy Pettitte felt better than he had in a long time, going all the way back to his final game with the New York Yankees almost 18 months ago. 
He pitched like it, too. 
Pettitte allowed only a solo ho.mer to Reggie Sanders in a strong six-inning season debut, and Mike Lamb's two­run triple in the bottom of the eighth sent the Houston Astros to a 4-1 win over the St. Louis Cardinals on Wednesday. 
"It was great to go back out there and not pitch with a lot of pain," Pettitte said. "I can't tell you how happy I am to go out there and not hurt. It makes you appreciate your health." 
Chad Qualls pitched two perfect innings and Brad Lidge got three outs for a save to help Houston break a three­game losing streak against the Cardinals, dating to Game 6 of the NL championship series last October. 
Coming off an elbow injury that ended his season last August, Pettitte proved that those painful days of 2004 might finally be behind the hurler. 
The last time Pettitte looked this good, he was wearing pinstripes and pitching in Game 6 of the 2003 World Series. 
Washington 7, 
Philadelphia 3 
PHILADELPHIA -A few players drank beers. Others quietly grooved to hip-hop music. Some simply showered and dressed. 
The Washington Nationals have their first win. They're still working on how to cele­brate. 
Brad Wilkerson hit for the cycle for the second time in his career and Jose Guillen hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in the eighth inning, leading the Nationals to a vic­tory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Wednesday night. 
It was Washington's second game since moving during the offseason after 36 years as the Montreal Expos. 
"It's a special day to get the first victory," Wilkerson said. 
Vinny Castilla was 4-for-5 with two doubles and one RBI for Washington, which hadn't celebrated a victory by a major league team since the expansion Senators left for Texas following the 1971 sea­son. 
The Nationals play their home opener at RFK Stadium on April 14 against Arizona. 
"It's nice to win your first game," Nationals manager Frank Robinson said. "It's a good feeling." 
Wilkerson was 4-for-4 with a walk and two RBis, com­pleting his cycle with a ground-rule double in the eighth against Aaron Fultz. 
Wilkerson homered off Brett Myers in the third, singled off Myers in the fifth and tripled against ~heal Cormier in the seventh. Wilkerson's first cycle was against Pittsburgh on June 24. 2003.

Belles set to challenge MIAA-leading Hope 
By KATE SERYAK Sport Writer 
On Thursday, the Belles will take on the flying Dutch of Hope College in one of their most important conliwence matches. 
Hope recently reached the .500 mark after a 9-0 shutout win over Olivet College on Tuesday and is curnmtly tied with Albion College atop the MIAA confer­ence at 3-0. 
"Jnsid1l of' our conference, this will be our first big challenge," Belles captain Miranda Mikulyuk said. "This match, how we play in it, will be a good indicator for the rest of the season. 
"It will also be a good challenge !'or our doubles [pairs]." Mikulyuk said. "TuPsday's match wasn't a good ehallenge for the doubles, but llope is almost stronger in doubles than they are in singles so this will be a good challenge." 
Captain Kristen Palombo echoed Mikulyuk's thoughts. 
"The doubles will be key to set­ting up the match tomorrow," Palombo said. "If we can go into the singles having won two out of the three doubles, I think we have a chance at winning the whole match. That would take the pressure ofT of the singles players -they would only have to win thren out of the six singles matches." 
This will be only the Belles' second conference match. Saint Mary's played Tri-State University on Tuesday and won with a 9-0 sweep, beginning their conference run at 1-0. 
Despite a strong start to the season, however, the Belles were not invited to the Midwestern Tournament in Wisconsin this year. 
"I think its kind of hard to be judged so early in the season," Mikulyuk said. "We've only played one conference match, whereas Hope and Albion have played three. I don't know what the criteria are to get invited to that mat<:h. I'm not sure its clear to anyone." 
The Belles, however, aren't fazed. Instead, they are looking forward to tomorrow's match. 
"We've beaten Hope in the past few years, but they have always been dose matches," Palombo said. "They always come ready to play, and it will be a tough match. llope had a really good win against Calvin last week, so !Hope is] definitely strong this year." 
As of yet, it has not been deter­mined where the match will be held. If it rains before 11 a.m., the match will be held in Hope's indoor facilities. If not, the match will be played at St. Mary's as originally scheduled. 
"Tennis is mostly mental, and right now we don't even know where we are playing this match," Palombo said. "It will be tough if we have to sit in a van for two hours beeause your legs get cramped and it's hard to stay focused. 
"Also, ifwe don't play at home, we won't have as many fans, and Hope has the loudest and most obnoxious fans. I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow," Palombo said.

Top seed U Got A Bad Draw wins but does not dominate 
By JOHN EVERETT Sports Writer 
In a game that took a lot longer than it had to, the Moonshiners !inally reached 21 points to put away Ghetto Fab, a squad of girls from Pasquerilla West who showed up for the game in white tank-tops with messages written in marker. Ghetto Fab member Julie Opet said the messages were not meant to have a pur­pose. 
Although Ghetto Fab won the coin toss, it was The Moonshiners who got off to a fast start by forc­ing turnovers on each of Ghetto Fab's first two possessions and ex!lcuting the break pllrfectly fgr a 2-0 lead. 
At that point it appeared the game would be over quickly, but Eric Blevins of the Moonshiners decided to take a larger role in his team's offense. 
Blevins made it abundantly elear that he did not mind shoot­ing the ball. His first, from beyond the 3-point are, cleared the back­board, hitting the metal pole behind it, and the second cleared everything. Blevins was heard, after each shot, saying, "That was pretty close." 
If not for the efforts of Rob Gilmer it is hard to say whether this game would have ever ended. Gilmer, known as "The Toledo Tornado" in homage to his hometown and hi<> patented spin move down in the post, put up six points and eight rebounds to lead the way for the Moonshiners.

Opet led the way for Ghetto Fab, scoring three of the team's four points. After the game, Opet and her teammates were only mildly di<>appointed. 
"Our shots weren't falling," Opet said. "We hadn't planned on winning this game, but we hope this will help us do better in the women's tournament." 
Team Awesome 21, We Go Down the Court 2 

In a game that came danger­ously close to being a shutout, Team Awesome made quiek work of We Go Down the Court, a team comprised of five McGlinn ~:,rirls. 
Team Awesome was led by it<> trio of Pats -Pat O'Brien. Pat Conley and Pat "Tastyeakes" Gotobeski -who had their own cheering section, as three of their male friends stood on the side­lines, bare-chested, with the let­ters P-A-T emblazonnd in green on their ehests. 
Team Awesoine maintained a high-intensity playing style throughout the game, long after the outeome was no longer in doubt. Whether they were just exhibiting their work ethic or needlessly trying to embarrass their opponents is hard to say, but We Go Down the Court's Katie Grimes let her disapproval be known. 
"We considered thL<> a chance to tune-up for the women's tourna­ment, but apparently it wa<> also a way to boost the self-esteem of some of the men on campus," Grimes said.

Pitching and fielding are costing Irish dearly 
A year ago, Notre Dame's 12th loss was its last-a 7-6 defeat to Arizona in the NCAA tournament on June 6. 
This season. the Irish sur­passed that loss total Wednesday with a one-sided, 14-5 manhan­dling from Ball State at Frank Eck Stadium. 
After being swept in a double­header for only the seventh time in their Big East history with two losses Monday to Rutgers, the Irish stum­bled again in unchar­acteristic fashion. They could­n't got any key hits. They could-n't field, tallying five errors. And they certainly couldn't pitch. 
Two of the three reasons for Wednesday's loss also explain why the Irish are struggling 27 games into the 2005 season. The defense has been bad, the pitching

solid pitching. But this season. the arms are a weakness. The teams' ERA hovers around 5.11, with opposing hitters batting .314. Two of Notre Dame's better pitchers from 2004, Tom Thornton and Jeff Samardzija, are just 5-4 combined with ERAs of 5.59 and 6.04, respectively. 
Not having the team's top four pitchers from the beginning of last season isn't helping the situ­ation, either. Chris Niese! and Grant Johnson both left school early for the Major League draft, and current starters Jeff Manship and John Axford are slowly recovering from arm problems that kept both out for all of 2004. 
"The biggest change is that you've got two power arms with Niese) and Johnson [gone]," Mainieri said. "When Johnson came back [from injury] we basi­cally had two No.1's." 
Axford, who was drafted in the seventh round of the 2001 draft by Seattle, showed he's not back to form yet, yielding five earned runs and five walks in just 1/3 of an inning Wednesday. Manship has only logged 5 1/3 innings this end's trip to 
Boston College, three of the next four Big East series are at home, where the Irish are 7-2. 
All is not lost, but things must change. 
"It's obvious that we have some areas of our team that are not playing up to the level that we've grown accustomed to over the last decade," Mainieri said. "Right now 'we need to win as many games as we can, and we need to qualifY for the confer­ence tournament. Onee you get in the conference tournament, that's your way into the NCAA tournament." 
It's a simple plan. But it will become much simpler if Notre Dame improves pitching and defense. 
Do those things well and the Irish will start doing what this program's used to -winning baseball games. 
The views expressed in this column are those ofthe author and not necessarily those ofthe Observer.

"That's eating at me rriore than anything else," Mainieri said. "Infield defense has been a concern and third base has been our Achillies' Heel all year. I've always taken great pride in our infield defense. 
"I know we have the players. We just haven't done it." Ball State built a 
season. 
Either way, Notre Dame needs someone who can be a stopper. Someone who gets the job done nearly every time out. Someone who gives teammates confidence that the game is under control. 
The Irish just don't have that guy right now. Without him, Notre Dame will eontinue to be up and down all season. With him, the Irish at least have a chance at making a run in the Big East tournament. 
Whether the pitching comes around or not, Notre Dame's defense has to improve, particu­larly in the infield. Last season the Irish had a .967 overall field­ing pereentage. That dropped to just .954 this season entering the Ball State game. Middle infield­ers Ross Brezovsky and Greg Lopez have struggled the most with .839 and .924 percentages, respectively. 
"Our infield defense has been the big concern for me all year," Mainieri said. "It's been such an Achilles' Heel for us. I don't know what to say except that the infield has been a bigger coneern than our pitching ... I really feel like we've got the players that 
can play, they just 
haven't played 
''I've coached over 1,300 games and with the start to the game that we had, it would have been a daunting task," Mainieri said. "I don't want to make more out of it than it is."

Irish their first run. Matt Edwards hit his 11th homerun of the season after Smith's sin­gle to make the score 14-4. 
The Irish got their fifth and last run of the game in the eighth when Matt Bransfield seored on a fielder's choice. 
The Irish travel to Boston 

College this weekend for a three-game series. 
Despite the 14 runs and five errors, Mainieri knows not to put too much stock into this game and just to get his team focused for the important con­ference games remaining on the schedule.

continued from page 28 
All season, Corrigan has emphasized the Irish need to be consistent from start to fin­ish in order to win. That con­sistency was not there against Dartmouth and will need to be there against Denver. 
"We didn't play well at Dartmouth. If there was any consistency at Dartmouth, it was not on the positive side," Corrigan said. "[Denver] is one of those games -it's a league game that we need to win, and they need to win, frankly. So I think this is one of those games where you just lind a way to get it done." 
The Irish have only played one home game this season ­a 22-6 romping of Butler -so the prospect of playing a game at Notre Dame tomor­row is exciting. 
"In a year when we don't have a lot of home games, we're very excited to be home," Corrigan said. "!They're excited] to play in front of their friends and family here." 
The game will begin at 4 
p.m. at Moose Krause Stadium.

Unlucky 13 
Axford gives up six runs in one-third of an inning as Irish fall 
By MATT LOZAR Senior Staff Writer 
Heading into Wednesday's game against Ball State, Irish coach Paul Mainieri expected a wide range of possibilities for John Axford's first start since 2003. 
Unfortunately See Also for Mainieri and "Pitching and the Irish,

end of the range. 
Axford pitched 1/3 of an inning, walkod five of the eight batters he faced and allowed six runs, five earned, as the Irish dug themselves too much of a hole in losing to the Cardinals 14-5 at Frank Eck Stadium. 
"It's just one of things where the kid ne1~ds to find his confi­dence again," Mainieri said. 
"I knew this was a possibility. He's had some control issues his whole career. Even when he was throwing great he had con­trol issues. 
"I knew the possibility existed that that could happen, but. I just felt like for all he's done for the program, I just needed to run him out there and give him a chance. Unfortunately, he just struggled like crazy. Once we got off to a bad start against a good ball club, it was an uphill battle. 

"I just can't give up on the kid," Mainieri said. 
Axford walked the first two he faced before a Brad Miller single scored Mike Sullivan to give Ball State its first run. 
After two more walks, one of which forced in a run, Axford retired Chris Pestle on a foul pop out to Matt Edwards. 
Then, Axford allowed another single and walked in another run before being removed for Tyler Jones, who got the last two outs of the inning. 
During the next two innings, the Cardinals got six more runs off Mike Dury, but only two of

FOOTBALL 

Defense looks to stay tough without_Tuck 
Several players hope to fill void left when star decided to go pro 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN Associate Sports Editor 

Coming into the season, the Irish clearly have a huge miss­ing piece on the defensive line. A 6-foot-4, 265-pound missing piece. 
That's not to say that anyone 
involved with Notre Dame 
football is noticeably worried 
about the absence of Justin 
Tuck. After all, it's a new sea­
son and there is a new coach­
ing staff. . 
"We're building towards the 
future," Irish defense end 
Victor Abiamiri said. "The old 
guys, they did us well, but 
they're not here anymore." 
The Irish being optimistic 
about their defensive line next 
season has a lot to do with 
Abiamiri. The sophomore 
defensive end is a talented 
pass rusher who will be the 
leader in this year's group. 
"''m ready to step up to this 
challenge," Abiamiri said. 
"We've got guys that have 
been through the program and done well, but they arc gone now. It's like a new team try­ing to build a new identity, and I'm trying to be one of the anchor points of the defensive line." 
Tuck's absence has created a situation in which a number of players are vying for a chance to take his place. 
As of now, Chris Frome and Travis Leitko appear to be the front-runners. 
"Right now we got Chris Frome working on the right side, and we got Travis Leitko working on that side," Irish defensive line coach Jappy Oliver said. "Those two are competing well, and I've been pleased with their progress right now." 
Abiamiri echoed his coach's thoughts. 
"We're rotating a lot to see what kind of abilities everyone has, giving everybody equal chances," Abiamiri said. ''I'm not sure how its going to be when the season comes around, but hopefully we'll have a nice rotation going and keeping guys fresh in there." 
This competition is no secret to Leitko, who expressed his own desire to be on the playing

Bailers crush Team 536; Seabiscuit also takes down Number 1 
By ANN LOUGHERY Sports Writer 
Fueled by an opportunistic offense and a patient defense, the Bailers overwhelmed Team 536. 21-11, Wednesday night. 
Although the Bailers seemed a little unsure in the first min­utes of the game, they quickly recovered and gained enough composure to pull ahead of their stumbling opponents, 6­

Off-campus junior fan Matt Goulet was quick to point out attributes that made the Bailers so successful.

other team is drunk [and] the other team smoked at half­time," Goulet said. "It's pretty much a blowout." 
The Bailers combined a solid short game and a num­ber of key steals to extend their lead. Battling blustery winds, Keenan sophomore Bob Laney boasted one of the more impressive plays of the game, capitalizing on an alley­oop after a break away boost their lead to 13-6. 
"We were able to get a lot of open looks at the basket," Laney said. "We broke down their defense, and they had a hard time shooting after that." 
With the score at 19-11, Team 536's fate seemed cer­tain as the Bailers secured two consecutive points for the win. Keenan sophomore J .J. Vega made a layup for the final point of the game.

Before they worry about that, however, they will first have to defeat Denver (5-2), an extremely talented Great Western Lacrosse League team that has yet to play a league game. 
"We're going to face a real challenge, because Denver is a very good team and our guys know that," Irish coach Kevin Corrigan said. "But I think we're a good team too." 
The one-goal, 10-9 loss to Dartmouth was tough as the Irish allowed two goals in the final three minutes, but Corrigan is confident his team will be able to rebound. 
"I think we'll bounce back well," Corrigan· said. "l think that last weekend was a tough_ weekend for us, but I really believe that our guys are excited."
