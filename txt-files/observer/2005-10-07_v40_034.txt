Siegfried suiTered from amyotrophic latnral sclero­

sis (ALS), also Siegfried known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. 
"The Notre Dame family today lost one of its most cherished nwmbers, a man whose wisdom, leadership and generosity will be felt on this campus for all time," University President Father John Jenkins said in a statement. "We will miss his warm friendship and will be inspired by the courage he showed while tested by medical challenges in the past few years. Along with our prayers, our deepest sympathy goes to Milann, his wife, and all the Siegfried family." 
Senior resident assistant and former Siegfried Ilall president Dan Carey, who met Siegfried twice, described him as "an all­around great guy." 
"He had several loves in his life and they've become appar­ent," Carey said. "First, his fami­ly and his kids. lie was a great family man and had a great love 
for his wife." His second great love, Carey said, was Notre Dame. 
"His father was also an alum here and this place means the world to him," Carey said. "lie was still active on the Board of Trustees until the day he died." 
This active role in the University and in campus life was a constant for Siegfried, who Carey said had a strong connection to Siegfried residents and the dorm's community. 
"Even through his personal struggles he still took the time to come out and meet the guys," Carey said. "lie always went out of the way to make it feel like you lived in the best place on campus." 

Push for research underway 
Hditor's Note: This is the first article in a two-part series examining the presence and future of undergraduate research within different col­/eyes at Notre Dame.

In the wake of University l'rnsident Fatlwr John Jenkins' inaugural address calling for an increasn in the number of undergraduatns involved in research. representatives from a number of colleges indicated that undergraduates are tak­ing part in rnsnarch activities but stressed that more work IHliHls to be done to promote and fund research opportuni­tins.

provost Dennis Jacobs said one of the challenges in discussing undergraduate research is accurately identifying the per­centage of undergraduates who are eurrently involved. 
According to the 2004 senior exit survey, 30 percent of graduating seniors identified themselves as having worked on undergraduate research with a faculty member at some point during their four-year tenure. 
However, in counting the number of students who sign up for academic credit in research, special studies or a senior thesis, only 10 percent of Notre Dame students are currently involved in research.

Fifth Blue Mass honors e111ergency workers 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
News Writer 
Notre Dame police, fire and emergency personnel celebrated the annual Blue Mass Thursday in the Basilica of the Sacred lleart. 
The Blue Mass, which earns its name from the predominately blue-colored uniforms of police officers and lirelight­ers, was first held at Notre Dame Of! Oct. 11,2001. 
After Sept. 11, 2001, Director of Campus Ministry Father Richard Warner proposed to then-University President Father Edward Malloy the idea of a spe­cial Mass in memory of tho lire lighters and police ollicers that died as a result of the terrorist attacks. 
The memorial Mass, called a "month's mind," was held 30 days after tho attacks following Catholic tradition. Since 2001, it has been held every October.

Carey never actually spoke with Siegfried due to the sevnrity of his ALS. 
"The first time I met him, hn was able to mumble maybe a thank you," Carey said. 
But this inability to spnak did­n't stop Siegfried from communi­cating with the men of the hall that bears his name. 
"Since then hn has spoken to the guys in tho dorm through lettnrs," Carny said. "Ito has this technology, this computer on his wheelchair" that allows him to write. 
Siegfried also connected with students through his rngular presnncn at Sil~gfrind int(lrhall

SMC vvill upgrade Internet 
By MEGAN O'NEIL Saint Mary's Editor 
Just days artnr warning stu­dents to buckle down for a year of slow Internet connections, Saint Mary's director of Information Tnchnology Keith Fowlkes announced Thursday the rnallocation of $17,000 to increase the College's band­width. 
Currnntly opnrating at 6.5 Megabits, the Internet connec­tion will expand to 45 Megabits, providing for substantially fastnr maneuvnl'ing of tho Wnb and legal downloading of music. 
StudHnt frustration with tho slow lnternnt connection increased in rnc:ent wonks. Many students said thn situa­tion was hindnring their ability to complete schoolwork.

INSIDE COLUMN 
A colu111n fro111 the inside 
I realized a while ago that I work for The Observer, and that gives me the opportunity to write a column on the inside. This is the inside col­umn where you get the inside story 
on things you  
are on the out- Adam Fairholm  
side of, right?  
OK.  
What I'm  Cartoonist  
going to say is  
that if you  

haven't already gone totally berserk over the infrared paper towel dispensers in the North Dining Hall bathrooms, there is probably something wrong with you. 
Man has always been contemplat­ing, saying, "What if we didn't have to touch things to get dry hands?" For about six million years the best thing anyone could come up with was a guy who sits in the bathroom and hands you towels. Psh, lame. Absolutely lame-o. Thanks history, thanks a lot. If history were here right now, I'd say, "Thanks a lot." I'd say it in a way that history would know that I am being sar­castic. 
Worst of all is the big blast of air things. If I wanted a blast of air to dry my hands, I'd go to an alter­nate universe where everyone loves to dry their hands with a blast of air, but unfortunately in this alter­nate universe, everyone eats noth­ing but garlic bread and is boring. That's the point I'm trying to make. If you like the blast of air, you are boring. 
This is off-topic, but if you are reading this in the dining hall and you are one of those people who likes to walk really slowly in front of me when I'm trying to get around, one day I'm going to pour milk down your back. 
Our forefathers probably thought advanced robots would give us paper towels in the bathroom, but they could never imagine such a simple and beautiful machine like the infrared dispensers. With one wave of the hand, it not only sends you a piece of paper towel, you have also inadvertently flicked a moderate amount of water off your hands, essentially pre-drying your hands for paper towels. If you have noticed this before, I bet you are a happier person for it. 
So get happy about these dis­pensers. When you come out of the bathroom, tell the card swipers how nice it was in there. Especially tell the nice one who looks at your card and says your name. That makes me feel good. If you are reading this, lady who goes the extra mile and says everyone's name, that's cool. If not, it would be nice if someone could bring this column to her attention.

Arts and Letters 
Gretchen Heydams-Schils, director of the Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts, said the College of Arts and Letters is at the forefront of sponsoring undergraduate research. 
"The College of Arts and Letters is ahead of the game at this point," she said. 
Reydams-Schils directs the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UHOP), a college funding agency that provides grants for undergrad­uates to travel to conferences, conduct their original research, travel to undertake research, or stay in South Bend for the summer to work on research projects with a professor. 
Interim grants of up to $1,500 provide support for conducting original research or conference travel, while the summer grants provide $1,200 per month for up to three months to permit students to earn income while assisting a professor with summer research or to travel to con­duct research during the sum­mer. 
The 2004 Dean's Report said UHOP funded 103 student grants for a total of $145,221 during the 2004-05 academic year. The Heport notes that this total does not include some students who are sup-and chemo caps to mini-golf passes. Physics professor Ikaros Bigi is offering tutoring in physics, math, history, German and the history of art in exchange for a $15 donation for each hour. 


Some businesses outside of Notre Dame, like the Hoseland Pizza Hut, donated a portion of each customer's bill on four days in September to the American Cancer Society. 
The American Cancer Society's Helay for Life has three million partieipants in 4,200 communities across the 
U.S. who will raise millions of dollars in this year alone. Proceeds from these events support cancer research, spreading the word, political lobbying for cancer issues and support for victims and sur­vivors.

ported by faculty grants through such agencies as the National Science Foundation. A survey of undergraduate research revealed that 15 per­cent of Arts and Letters stu­dents participated in a research project in 2004-05, the Dean's Report said. 
Reydams-Schils said the College made undergraduate research a priority after a report on undergraduate edu­cation at research universities called the Boyer Heport was released in 1998. 
The report stressed that uni­versities could do a better job of funding and promoting undergraduate research. She said UROP grant applications have increased significantly in the last three years. 
"(Undergraduate research] is part of a 
stronger connections between teaching and research, to make faculty think about how to bring research into teaching and undergraduates to see how research relates to teaeh­ing." 
She also said research and teaching do not need to be at odds with each other. 
"I think it is wrong to see teaching and research pitted against each other. The best research is done in connection with teaching concerns," she said. 
Mark Hoche, dean of the College of Arts and Lntters, said students are also involved in non-UHOP-funded "research" projects like a sen­ior thesis or an art exhibition. He said 14 out of 18 depart­ments within the College cur­

Reydams-Schils said in addition to a Web site that explains the UROP program, her office is working on further ways to promote th~ opportunities. 
A presentation from past UROP winners will be held Nov. 3, and Heydams-Schils said she speaks to individual classes or departments when­ever asked by an instructor or department chair. The College is also working with the College's Office of Publicity, News and Information to pro­mote UHOP through a video. 
Heydams-Schil stressed the importance of research for undergraduates. 
"Undergraduate research brings the teaching and research together," she said. "It allows one to make 
tal priority. 

"There will be more funding with or without Father Jenkins' largesse," he said. 
Since only 18 percent of UHOP applications were accepted last year, Hoche said he would like to increase the number of funded summer grants. lie also said some indi­vidual departments have also received endowments that can fund undergraduate research. 
Hesearch involvement, Hoche said, is an essential part of undergraduate education. 
"Those experiences tend to be the most formative and memorable experiences of their undergraduate days," he said.

Mass 
continued from page 1 
Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) assistant director Phil Johnson served as a lector and delivered an introduction about the increased respect given to those in uniform since the 2001 attacks. 
"This was an event that made us more mindful of those many who serve and make risks every day," Johnson said. 
John Antonucci, the opera­tions chief of the University's fire department, also served as a lector. Although the first three Blue Masses were held primari­ly in remembrance of the vic­tims of Sept. 11, Antonucci said the Mass has developed to demonstrate the gratitude of the community for law enforce­ment and emergency workers. 
"Now as we move away from the event, we move the focus of the event to being a celebration of life and to honor those who protect us every day," Antonucci said. 
NDSP, the University Fire Department and South Bend fire fighting and police depart­ments attended the Mass, as well as some police officers and fire fighters from around the country. 
University President Father John Jenkins presided at the Mass, which he called a "signifi­cant ND tradition." He wel­comed the opportunity to "honor and appreciate and thank police officers, fire fight­ers, and emergency personnel in our community." 
In his homily, Warner hon­ored the members of the police and fire departments and emer­gency personnel who "place the common good above all." 
Warner called those in uni­form "men and women of the beatitudes." He paid special tribute to the families of the men and women in uniform and their unique sacrifice. 
Warner asked Mass attendees to remember especially the vic­tims of terrorism, members of the armed forces and all those who have died in the course of duty. 
The Blue Mass tradition closely resembles the long­standing Catholic tradition of the Red Mass, a special service for lawyers, judges and politi­cians that is held at the begin­ning of the judicial year. Cardinal McCarrick of Washington, D.C. celebrated a Red Mass with the Supreme Court justices. 
Notre Dame celebrated its own Red Mass Oct. 2 with lawyers and judges from sur­rounding communities.

Carey recalled a "little initia­tion" Siegfried gave to incoming Siegfried freshmen in front of Main Building. 
"[ALS] had already started to take a toll on his body, but he has addressed the freshmen the last two years," Carey said. "This year his son Terrell [a sec­ond year Notre Dame law stu­dent] read that on behalf of his father." 
Siegfried was chairman of the board of the NORDAM Group, an international aerospace manu­facturer. He received an hon­orary doctor of law degree from Notre Dame in May 1995. 
For the last four years, Conley said Siegfried Hall has donated all funds raised from its signa­ture spring event, the Rambler Scrambler, to the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Association in Siegfried's honor. 

"I believe the family is also going to designate some addi­tional charities," Conley said. 
After Siegfried Hall won the interhall football title two years ago, a game that Siegfried attended, Carey said the dorm took an extra step to thank the "avid sports fan" for his support. 
Following the game, the dorm contacted Joe Montana and arranged for Montana to meet up with the team.

Jobless claims increase to 363,000 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON -The number of people thrown out of work from Hurricanes Katrina and Hita rose to 363,000 last week with more bad news expected Friday when the government releases its unemploy­ment report for September. 
The unemployment report could show as many as 400,000 job losses from Katrina in what would be the starkest sign yet of the economic devastation from the country's most expensive natural disaster. 
"We arc going to gnt a lot of ugly data in the next few weeks as we see the full e!Teet of these storms," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com 
Zandi said he was looking for the September employment report to show a loss of around 350,000 jobs because of Katrina, which hit near New Orleans on Aug. 29. The num­ber of people filing applications for unemployment benefits was still ris­ing the week of Sept. 12, when the Labor Department conducted its survey for the monthly jobs report. 

Zandi said the loss of 350,000 jobs in the hurricane areas would be offset somewhat by a gain of 150,000 jobs in the rest of the coun­try, leaving total payroll employ­ment falling by a still sizable 200,000. 
In August, before the storms hit, payroll jobs rose by 169,000. Jobs haven't fallen in more than two years. 
The consensus among economists surveyed is for jobs to declinn by 150,000 and for the unmnpfoymnnt rate to rise from a four-year low of 
4.9 percent in August to 5.1 per­cent. But analysts said predieting this month's data is extremely 
tricky given that the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the report, faeed great difTiculty doing its normal surveys in the hurricane areas. 
"!low do you survey pnopln who are displaeed? flow do you survey businesses in Nnw Orlnans if their phones don't work or they are not there'?" asked David Wyss, ehief economist at Standard & Poor's in New York.

Ind. sex offender arrested out of state 
Associated Press 
FARGO, N.D. -A convicted sex offender from Indiana named on the FBI's Most Wanted Fugitives list has been arrested here. 
William C. Davis, 33, of Wadesville, Ind., 15 miles northwest of Evansville, faces felony charges of molesting three Evansville-area boys and failing to register as a sex offender. 
Davis was arrested on Thursday and taken to the Cass County Jail, where he will await an extradition hearing to return to Indiana. Authorities said he had been wanted on the felony charges for more than a year in both Vanderburgh and Posey coun­ties. 
A picture and details of Davis aired briefly on "The Oprah Winfrey Show" on Tuesday. The TV show focused on convicted sex offenders who victimized chil­dren again. 
Winfrey's production com­pany 1-Iarpo Productions Inc. offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of any of the fugitives profiled on the program. 
The profile of Davis prompt­ed a Fargo woman to call another woman about it, said FBI Special Agent Paul McCabe of Minneapolis. 
The second woman went to the Oprah.com Web site to look at Davis' picture. She then called Minneapolis FBI agents about a man she knew as Mark A. Davis, McCabe said. 
"Naturally, from there, we had some investigating to do," he said. 
The FBI investigation con­firmed Davis' background and led agents to Davis' apart­ment at about 4:45 p.m. Thursday. 
"Through a ruse, they were able to get him to come to the door," McCabe said. "He actu­ally denied who he was at first but finally admitted he was William C. Davis." 
Davis had shaved his head and was wearing a leg cast when arrested. 
Fargo police also plan to investigate how long Davis lived in their city and what he was up to. 
"We don't want to be known as a haven for child moles­ters," said Police Chief Chris Magnus. 
Cass County Jail records show Davis said he was unemployed. He listed his mother, Pat Davis, as a con­tact person. 
Davis told authorities he would decline all requests for interviews. 
The latest Indiana charges stem from accusations Davis molested boys from January 2004 to July 2004, according to the FBI's Web site. 
The site, along with the Indiana sex offender registry, says Davis was convicted for two counts of child molesta­tion in January 1992. 
Prison officials released him about 28 months later, and Davis failed to follow Indiana's sex offender regis­tration laws. He disappeared in the summer of 2004, after learning that police in Evansville were looking for him. Local FBI agents investi­gated sightings of Davis, but never located him. 
Indiana authorities asked the FBI to issue a warrant on a federal charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution for the latest molestation accusa­tions. 
If convicted, Davis faces between 20 to 50 years on each of five Class A felony counts, two to eight years on each of five Class B felony counts and an enhanced sen­
tence  up  to  38 additional  
years  as  a  repeat sexual  
offender.  

The Evansville Courier & Press reported Vanderburgh County Deputy Prosecutor Donita Farr said Davis was known as the "rubber band man" when he volunteered with a local social agency that offers mentoring programs to children. 
He acquired the title because he made toys out of twisted rubber bands.

Lavv111akers push private screeners 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Law-mak­ers, many of them upset with the performance of the Transportation Security Administration, hope to encourage airports to return to privately employed screen­ers. 
A provision in the Homeland Security spending bill, which was passed by the House Thursday evening, shields air­ports from lawsuits if they switch to private screeners. 
Some airport officials haven't made the switch for fear that they could be sued if terrorists carried out an attack because of something private screeners did or didn't do. 
Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., added the legal protection to the Homeland Security spend­ing bill to give airports the option of using private screen­ers. 
"Private screening -under the watchful eye of the TSA ­would have a lot more flexibil­ity and maneuverability in addressing peak-hour loads and moving screeners around on the clock, rather than a large bureaucracy like the TSA," Rogers said. 
Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., a member of the House avia­tion subcommittee, thinks pri­vate screeners will weaken airport security. Companies that hire screeners already have some legal protection, he said. 
"If the private screening's so great, why do the private screening companies need the federal government to cap their liability?" DeFazio asked. "Why do the airports want to be exempt from any liability?" 
The switch to TSA screeners came after the Sept. 11 attacks exposed problems with pri­International, estimates there vately employed workers. still are 20 or 30 airports Private screeners have been interested in making the used by five airports as part of switch. a test comparing them with However, he said legal pro­federal screeners at the other tection is only part of the 450 commercial airports.

ers performed statis­tically better than the federal screen­ers, though opponents of pri­vate screening say the differ­ence was slight. 
In November, all airports were allowed to apply to switch from government screeners to private screeners. 
Advocates of private screen­ers predicted that dozens of airports would rush to make the switch because of frustra­tion with TSA's staffing deci­sions and procedures. 
But only Elko Regional Airport in Nevada and Sioux Falls Regional Airport have applied to opt out. 
One of the five test airports, San Francisco International Airport, had said it would switch to government screen­ers because it didn't have suf­ficient legal protection. Airport spokesman Michael McCarron said it would keep private screeners if the congressional plan becomes law. 
Steve van Beek, executive vice president of policy for the trade group Airports Council 
D-Ore. 
George Doughty, execu­tive director of 

Lehigh Valley International Airport in Allentown, Pa., says he doesn't see much benefit in having TSA hire a screening company. 
Airports now have half the responsibility for security and the TSA has the other half, he said. "If I'm just going to bring in yet another third party in the process, it doesn't seem to get me anything," he said. 
"Right now we've got a sys­tem in place. It's working," Doughty said. "We could improve on it if we could man­age the screening." 
TSA spokeswoman Carrie Harmon said the agency is pleased the issue appears close to resolution. 
"We know there are a num­ber of airports that have been awaiting resolution of this issue," Harmon said. 
The other four airports that use private screeners are in Rochester, N.Y., Tupelo, Miss., Jackson, Wyo., and Kansas City, Mo.

"Sum th(~ oyster industry is not nearly as big as it used to be, but the oysters anm't going to beeome extinct," Helyea says as he plies waters where Theodore Hoosevelt onee lished and where Billy Joel's mansion sits near the shorn. "And if we manage them properly, it's going to be a thriv­ing farming operation." 
The federal review was prompted in large part by the situation in Maryland's Chesapeake Bay, whieh has seen a dramatic dropoff in oyster numbers. Between the 1930s and 1970s, Maryland's annual oyster harvest ranged between 2 and 4 million bushels a year. Last year, that number dropped to less than 33,000 bushels. 
But the Chesapeake is not the only concern. 
The Fisheries Service, which is part of the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, said U.S. Atlantic Coast landings of Eastern oysters dropped from 
160.6 million pounds in 1890 to 
2.4 million pounds in 2003 -a trend believed to be driven by overfishing, lost habitats and disease.

Better late than never 
If you were a student at Saint Mary's in 1998 and dialed up to an Internet Service Provider to check your e-mail on a Sunday night, your connection would be faster than the bandwidth students now receive in 2005 when connected to Saint Mary's HesNet. 
The 6.5 Megabit of bandwidth divided up among the student body has resulted in download speeds as slow as 1 KB/sec, com­pared to dialup download speeds of 56.6 KB/sec. This amount of bandwidth is only one-sixth of the 45 Megabit bandwidth necessary to satisfy the needs of the College -which have clearly expanded since 1998, as administrators, pro­and to using outside e-mail accounts to communicate with their families. 
But then eame a weleome about-face. After students voieed their frustrations at Monday's Board of Governance meeting and else­where, Saint Mary's made a swift turnaround, with administrators deciding to immediately reallocate $17,000 to increase the College's bandwith. Both Fowlkes, who attended the meeting, and the College are to be commended for listening to students and for 
quickly changing direction to meet a legitimate stu­
dent need.

resources to keep up with these needs. 

A'> the Internet has beeome a staple in the daily lives of most American college students -used for everything from researching papers to talking with friends to downloading music ­and as technological advances have made eonneetions laster than ever, it is hard to underestimate the Internet's importance. And for an educational institution that strives to maintain its academic innovations and reputation, a lagging Internet conneetion is a defi­nite problem. 
So it is troubling that College administrators and the Department of Information Technology allowed more than a month of the fall semester to pa..<;s before recognizing the seriousness of this disrup­tion to student life. At the beginning of this week, Director of Information Tedmology Keith Fowlkes said the College would not have the money to upgrade the connection by the end of this aca­demic year -a disheartening forecast for students who had resorted to waking up at 3 a.m. to do Internet-based homework however, studenl'> should follow his recommenda­
tion to cut back on downloading music and using strP-aming media so students who need to use the Internet for aca­demic work are able to do so. 
But for the long term, Saint Mary's not only a place of learning for il'> studenl'> -it is also home to those who live on eampus ­and students want the ability to use these advances without hin­drance. They have the right to expect the most oul'itanding techno­logical resources from the College, including a fast Internet corulee­tion that ean support music and other non-academic uses. 
As more and more academic requirements are filled by elass schedules, PowerPoint notes and group discussions that are facili­tated through the Internet, it has beeome more apparent how essential an efficient Internet conneetion is to any eollege's opera­tions. With this much-needed upgrade, studenl<; will be able to bet­ter participate in life at Saint Mary's -a goal the College has finally rightly rceognized as worth its immediate attention. 
Honoring the 'angels' of Notre Da111e 
Aeeording to legend, angels of varying shapes and sizes roam the earth. lneonspicuously walking among us, they are known only by those to whom they have bestowed good deeds. Notre Dame is 
no stranger to the angel brigade. One such soul, Hev. Hobert Gri.ffm, C.S.C., has been gone now for a half-dozen years but would have celebrated his 80th birthday this week. Unfortunately, 

unless a seholarship or Gary other memorial is Caruso established, few may remember his grace Capitol and eompassion as Comments time slithers along. 
Occasionally we stare squarely into the eyes of angels like "Fr. Griff' but fail to recognize them until they have vanished. A typical Notre Dame student will, in just four years, encounter many who are impressive not so much for Catholicism as for their spirituality. When this writer studied at Notre Dame during the waning years of the Vietnam War, that era's angels included Fr. Griff, Frank O'Malley, Dean Waddick, Lenny Sommer, Thomas Stritch and Rev. A B. Brennen to name but a few. 
These men touched student lives in divergent ways. For example, retired speech and drama professor of thirty­three years and Notre Dame Debate Coach, Lenny Sommer, led students to ten national championships in forensies, per­suasion and debate competition. He described his secret for success as "hard work, a belief in Notre Dame, and an occasional hopelessly dry martini." His testimonials, mere memories of his stu­dents, are much like the ghosts of Scrooge's youth at boarding schooL But oh, what wonderful memories. 

English professor Frank O'Malley and American Studies professor Tom Stritch were the la..<;t of the University's mid-20th Century "bachelor dons," faeulty who lived in the residence halls and mentored stu­dents. Coincidentally, both campus giants resided in Lyons Hall where they regularly spoke to students well beyond the mid­night hour. They taught students how to discover the meaning of life during those most sacred of nocturnal educational experiences. Both lived a vigorous exis­tence, attempting to fuse the ideal with the reaL Through their own seholarly style, each touched students in valuable ways. 
O'Malley fought personal demons aris­ing from a gin bottle, but eloquently spoke of the blood in the bricks on campus, of understanding the bread of live and of our everyday trials while following the foot­steps of Christ. Stritch almost single-hand­edly created the American Studies Department that melded American litera­ture, politics, communications and history at a time when our nation's culture was still exploding with antiwar fervor in the post-assassination 1960s. Never again will "bachelor dons" live as perpetual students within the confines of eollegiate dormito­ries. Their testimonials in today's digital existence are reduced to fmding the meaning of life through a Google search. 
For those who never had an Internet search engine while attending Notre Dame, they had Fr. Griffin. Griff comforted the lonely, the hurt, the losers, the misfits and the suicidal. He was a campus misfit who always gave a hug to visitors, and his immense size earned him the name "El Gorgo,'' the large one. Sitting all night in Keenan Hall on a large reclining chair just beyond his open door, Griff was the sponge who soaked up the heartbreak, frustration and uncertainty of Notre Dame teenagers who were homesick or upper­elassmen who were troubled. 
Working the spiritual graveyard shift each evening, Griffin seldom rose before noon. However, whenever he strolled across campus at midday, small armies of students "just happened to be going the same way." It was not until he adopted his cocker spaniel, Darby O'Gill, against University regulations, that some students felt at ease enough to use the dog to seek his guidance. 
Griff even managed to open the first 24­hour campus lounge in the basement of the La Fortune Student Center. Named after his dog, Darby's Place aeeommodat­ed mass gatherings. Yet Fr. Griffin could exude a personal one-on-one spiritual warmth students lacked elsewhere on campus or within their families. 
Perhaps someone today on campus has replaced Griff as the soother of souls, but none can attract legions who tag along while crossing the quads. Allowing his memory to fade as generations pass is not an option for many who loved Griff, whose lives were changed or saved through his unselfish and giving nature. Some desire the creation of a scholarship fund but laek an ability to coordinate the effort. 
It was suggested that an adequate schol­arship requires a hundred friends eon­tributing $1 ,000 each for a University fund in Griffin's name. This writer would be happy to coordinate such alumni interest with the University financial aid office. As one who personally felt Griff's charity and compassion, that is the least that can be done to remember this, or any of the Notre Dame 'angels.'

EDITORIAL CARTOON 

Opinion short-sighted 
As a veteran of the war in Iraq and student at Notre Dame, I read Michael Schorsch's Oct. 5 Letter to the Editor ('"War Culture' the wrong path") with obvious interest. I'II begin by saying that as a practicing Catholic I'm also fully aware of the Vatican's position concerning the shrinking nature of just war theory, and the idea that the use of force has relatively few justifiable applications. I also respect and sup­port Michael's right to criticize our nation's military and the Notre Dame Heservc Oflicer Training Corps program. 
That having been said, what naturally struck me concerning Schorsch's letter was a basic lack of respect for contrary viewpoints-something that I feel to be a hall­mark of the Catholic faith. In using words like "ridiculous," "subversive" and "dan­gerous" to describe the viewpoints and life choices of our nation's service mnmbers appears patronizingly short sighted to say the very least. Schorsch then goes on to line up a few passages from the Bible and proceeds to shut the lid on our discussion with the image of a smug, contrite Jesus looking down on our HOTC program with obvious disdain. I'm quite certain that kind of vitriol is inconsistent with the Catholic faith I know. 
Forget for the moment that his opinion ignores the often noble intentions and eon­tributions of our men and women in uniform. Instead of using The Observer space to explore those contributions in depth, I'll simply ofl'er a suggestion. Next time you feel the urge to boil a very complex issue of the Catholic faith down to a black in white contest in condescension, just skip the next non: article and hit the sporl'i seetion­our win over Purdue was much more interesting than the non: FTX anyway.

Respecting Saint Mary's 

Today when I flipped open The Observer, I immediately read the Question of the Day. Normally the answers amuse me, but today I was woefully disappointed. Dave Gruener's response to the question, What community service do you do and why?, made me smile. He said, ''I'm going down to New Orleans to do some hurricane relief work over break." However Patrick Pawlicki's answer-"I hang out with SMC chicks" -infuri­ated not only me, but a percentage of the Saint Mary's population. 
There is a reason that The Observer is an "Independent Newspaper Serving Notre Dame and Saint Mary's." It's impossible to express the frustration we Saint Mary's women feel about the stereotypes held by a number of Notre Dame stu­dents. Saint Mary's is a remarkable place, and we love our school. The women here are confident, talented and goal oriented. We are not here for the sole purpose of pursuing Notre Dame men, in spite of what people such as Pawlicki believe. 
Saint Mary's is not an inferior institution ­quite the contrary. The school has a unique histo­ry and an outstanding academic reputation. We respect and admire our Notre Dame family, but did not choose Saint Mary's simply because of its proximity to the University. Nor did we choose to come here as the "second-best" option to Notre Dame. We are separate and proud of the distine­tion, and couldn't be happier here across the street. 
It's unfortunate that Pawlicki feels that oll'ering his manly presence to Saint Mary's women is a service to us. I pity his closed mind. lie's missing out on the chance to meet some of the most incredible people in this Notre Dame, lloly Cross and Saint Mary's community.

playing running back Jamie O'Hara in "Rudy." 
''I'm sure it's going to be a great experience for [Vaughn] to come back to where his film career started," said John Pisani, Vaughn's publicist. "I think he's always had a fondness for Notre Dame, and there's a great tradition there. So to be able to come and do a show on the campus, he's thrilled about it." 
Saturday, Vaughn brings his national c·omedy tour, "30 Days & 30 Nights ­Hollywood to the Heartland," to Stepan Center, the 27th stop on the tour's nationwide road trip. Vaughn will act as the event's emcee and also take part in some of the skits. The show will also feature national touring comedians Bret Ernst, Sebastian Maniscalco, Ahmed Ahmed and John Caparulo, all comedians from the famed Los Angeles Comedy Store. 
Playing in 30 cities in 30 days is a daunting task for any performer, but Vaughn and his comedy crew have embraced the rare opportunity to tour all the way from Los Angeles to America's heartland, taking in the sights along the way. 
"We've been having a great time and it's been awesome performing at all these venues, some more historical than others," Ernst said. "We visited a few college campuses already; but nothing to the magnitude of Notre Dame. I'd love to go down to the [foot­ball stadium] field, especially since 'Rudy' was one of my favorite movies." 
The idea for the tour was spawned from Vaughn's previous work on come­dy benefit shows for charity. He organ­ized a similar show with the Comedy Store performers more than a year ago to support the Army Emergency Relief Fund. The success of that Memorial Day weekend show convinced Vaughn to spawn a nationwide tour. Proceeds from the current tour's profits have been used to support various charities, including those aiding the victims of Hurricane Katrina. The tour is also being filmed for an upcoming documen­tary movie detailing the trip's experi­ences. 
"Vince really respects .~hat we do as far as stand-up comics go," Ernst said. "He's really an amazing individual as far as his work ethic and his character. [He and his ~Ytffl put this all together in pretty much':f'our weeks; which is unbe­lievable. The idea of doirtg it for charity just motivated him even more." 

For Maniscalco, a fan of Vaughn's 1996 hit comedy "Swingers," the tour has offered a chance to travel around the country and work with someone who had inspired him onscreen years ago. When "Swingers" came out, Maniscalco was still living in Chicago and thinking of pursuing a career in standup. 
"To work with Vince Vaughn was a pretty surreal experience -to watch this guy's movie nine years ago and love what he did, and now, nine years later, we're roommates on a tour bus," Maniscalco said. "For me it's been great because now I get to tap into Vince Vaughn's audience base and he's validated us as his favorite comedians. It's been great. He's like the Johnny Carson of the millennium." 
As the comedy tour has neared South Bend, more discussions on the tour bus have been directed towards football and Notre Dame. Vaughn, a college football fan, also grew up in La'ke Forest, Ill. 
Between his love for college football, growing up in the Midwest and starring in "Rudy," Ernst isn't surprised that there might be a correlation there. 
"[Vaughn] is a big Notre Dame fan," Ernst said. "We were arguing on the bus. He kept bringing up Notre Dame and saying, 'classy program, Notre Dame doesn't do what the University of Miami does.' He's pretty attached to it and plus he's a Midwestern boy, which might explain why he loves Notre Dame." 
It's been over a decade since Vaughn started 'his film career on this very campus. He met fellow actor and good friend Jon Favreau during the filming of "Rudy," a relationship that opened an avenue to "Swingers," the film that helped launch the pair to stardom. This Saturday, Vaughn's career progression will come full circle. 
''I'm sure it's going to be a great experience and one that he's excited about -being able to come back after the success he's had in films like 'Dodgeball,' 'Wedding Crashers,' and 'Old School' that helped him become an A-list movie star, which is a nice arc,'' Pisani said. 
Not bad for a third-string running back.

Belles ready to repeat success in Eagle Invitational 
Team hopes for best times at annual race hosted by Benedictine 
By KEN FOWLER 
Sports Writer 
This one is big for the Belles. 
Today marks the last race in the middle third of the season for the team, and Saint Mary's enters the competition with high expectations. 
Last year in the five-kilome­ter Benedictine University Eagle Invitational in Lisle, Ill., Becky Feauto led Saint Mary's to a fifth-place finish in the 23­team field. 

Today, the Belles and first­year head coach Jackie Bauters are hoping for just as much success. 
"I think this weekend's going to be really good for us," Bauters said. "We tend to do pretty good at this race." 
Bauters said her strategy is to continue to improve Saint Mary's team results is to maxi­mize the performance of indi­vidual Belle runners. 
"Just a gut feeling, I think this race -because it's been very good for us -I think it will prove to be the best race for a lot of people this year," she said. ·

"We had a pretty full, hard week of practice this week, and the girls did great," she said. 
The race is the Belles' final five-kilometer meet for the year, and Baqters said that most of her runners are aiming to record personal best times in the race. 
"I really hope they can accomplish [their goals] and have their best [times]," she said. 
The race begins at 3:30 p.m. on the campus of Lisle High School.

HOMULUS, Mich. ­South Florida heat pre­vailed over a city whose last Super Bowl was an icy one. 
Miami was awarded the 2010 Super Bowl on Thursday. a record 1Oth time the city will host the title game and record 15th time it will be in Florida. 
"We love our city and we love our area. We think the weather is the best. We think we have the best hotels, the best restaurants, the best beaches and the best golf courses," Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga said. 

Miami, Atlanta and Houston made a final pitch for the marquee event at an NFL owners meeting about 25 miles from Detroit's ford Field, where the next Super Bowl will be played. 
What would Falcons owner Arthur Blank do differently? 
"I would take Atlanta and move it to the Caribbean," he joked. 
An ice storm and frigid temperatures struck Atlanta in 2000, the last time the game was played at the Georgia Dome. 
With New York, which had been conditionally 
awarded the game, out of the running, tho NFL picked from three cities that lost a bid in May for the 2009 game, which went to Tampa, Fla. 
The vote took three bal­lots. with Houston elimi­nated on the first. No city got the three-quarters vote needed on the second ballot and Miami won by a simple majority on the third. 
"Obviously. it was very close," Blank said. 

Some regarded Atlanta and Houston as favorites because Miami already had been picked for the 2007 game, but Blank said South Florida's 
IN BRIEF 
ManninJ! and Harrison find 
themselves close to record 
SAN FHANCISCO -Peyton Manning and Marvin Harrison are poised to make history, and the San Frandsen 49ers know there's not much they can do to protect one of their franchise's most hallowed records in their own stadium. 
The 49ers are just hoping Dwight Freeney doesn't set some sort of sacks record of his own while chas­ing Alex Smith, San Francisco's own star quarterback of the future. 
With one touchdown pass against the Niners' patehwork secondary on Sunday, Manning and !Iarrison will become the most prolif'ic passing combination in NFL history. Their 85th touchdown hookup last week lied the league reeord set by San Franeisco's Steve Young and Jerry Hice from 11)87-99. 
Manning and !Iarrison already hold the records for most com pie­lions (726) and yards (9,677) by a tandem, but the scoring mark is the 

most prized. Young and Hire led the 49ers to dozens or victories and a Super Bowl title from their home at wind-swept Candlestick Park. Johnson rea~ to pitch game three for the Yankees 
NEW YOHK -Handy Johnson knows his mission: Win and nothing else. 
The Yankees imported the Big Unit last winter to be their ace, snuff out opponents and get New York its first World Series title since 2000. 
With the best-ol'-f'ive AL playoff series against the Los Angeles Angels tied at one game apiece going into Game 3, the 42-year-old lel't-hander sounded determirwd as he prepared for his Yankees post­season debut. 
"I understand that I am here to get this tnam over the top," hn said. "And with that, there's no making mistakes. I made a few during the weather won out. The 2008 Super Bowl will be played in suburban Phoenix. That means al'tc~r the game in Michigan this year, there will be three Super Bowls in Florida and one in Arizona. 
"If you look at the last number of votes, it's very elear the ownership feels strongly about having the game where the weather is generally warmer." Blank said.

WOMEN'S INTERHALL 
Lewis and Badin face off in Blue League tilt 
Howard hopes to give favored Cavanaugh a tough game Sunday 
By JACK THORNTON, 
COLIN REIMER and 
BEN VINCENT 
Sporrs Writers 
With playoff's on the horizon, thn Lnwis Chieks (3-2) and the Badin Bullfrogs ( l-3-1) will meet Sunday at 9 p.m. at Hhinln Wnsl Fields in what should he a parlieularly hnated game. 
Lnwis, the No. :~ seed in the Wonwn's Blue League, just fin­islwd healing thn Bullfrogs 14­
1) on Tunsday and will now face llw No. 4 send in a game that eould have playoff irnplieations. 
Tuesday's game was won on inlnnsily, Badin reeeivnr Courtney Hains said. 
"They eame out a lot more aggrnssive than us, and il was­n't unlit about the last 10 min­utes when we !:anw out aggres­sive, lhal we played them strong and started to eorne haek," Hains said. "They just had il all game and we didn't and lhal gavn them the edge." 
Even if Lyons loses lo Walsh, guaranteeing the Bullfrogs a playoff spot, Hains said they'll he gunning for the Chieks. 
"I think it's going to be pretty tense," she said. "There was a lot of trash talking on the field, and I think they're going lo como out knowing lhal we want to bnal thnm." 
Lnwis rncniver Beeky Hambo says the Chieks will have to slay extra sharp to pull oil' the season-sweep. 
''I'm kind of nervous, because we just played them, and they kind of know what we do now," Hambo said. "We just need to be on the top of our game, because now they're going to try to adapt to us." 
Though the Chicks have already clinched a playoff berth, Lewis is approaching this game as if it meant as much as any other. 
"We come out every game 100 pereent," Hains said. "Every game is just about improving on the last, and fine­tuning everything and getting everything ready for the play­offs." 
In particular, the Chicks are looking to prepare for a trip to Notro Dame Stadium. 
"It's very important Ito usl to win this game," Hains said. "Two years ago, we went to the stadium, and a lot of the sen­iors and juniors want to go baek." 
Howard vs. Cavanaugh 
It's David versus Goliath Sunday night at 7 p.m. as the Howard Ducks (0-4-1) take on the unde~ated Cavanaugh Chaos (5-0) in a No. 1 vs. No. 6 positional game. 
Cavanaugh comes in as a heavy favorite, most recently coming off of a 13-6 win against Lyons. The Chaos have posted four shutouts in five games, and also possess a high-powered offensive attack that dismantled Walsh 18-0 earlier in the season. Led by quarterback Lisa Huffer and receivers Nancy Powaga and Janice Flynn, Cavanaugh has rolled through the women's Blue League en route to a No. 1 seeding this week. But despite their success. middle linebacker Kerri Bergen said her team is aware of the dan­gers of facing a team with nothing to lose. 
"We are definitely not looking past this one," Bergen said. "We have to work on what we want to do for the playoffs, and we want to stay undefeated." 
Bergen added Cavanaugh will look to get inexperienced players some valuable playing time should the score allow it. 
"When it comes time for the playoffs, it's always a good thing to get everyone some playing time, so they're ready if we ever need them to come in," Bergen said. 
Howard does not have that luxury. 
The Ducks enter the contest without a win, but receiver Mary Kaminski is looking on the bright side. 
"By the numbers, we look like we haven't had a great season, but we have shown signs of improvement week by week," she said. 
Despite looking at the posi­tives, Kaminski acknowledged that it will take a tremendous effort to upset the Chaos Sunday night. 
"We have to execute perfeetly and put all the little things together, but we haven't been able to do that yet," she said. "We've been working on the lit­tle things, like blocking, tack­ling, defensive coverage and running routes." 
Kaminski pointed to senior running back/safety Callie Whelan and freshman receiv­er/cornerback Liz Price as players who could possibly help the Ducks pull the upset. 
To the casual viewer, this 

game looks to be a runaway for the Chaos. They appear to hold a very favorable advantage both offensively and defensive­ly. 
But as history has shown, the game isn't played on paper. 
Lyons vs. Walsh 
Hope is not lost. 
If Lyons can beat Walsh in the final regular season game this Sunday, and if Badin loses its game against Lewis, the Lions can make the playoiTs. 
Of course, beating Walsh is easier said than done, as the Wild Women's only loss this season came to unbeaten Cavanaugh. 
Lyons knows the difficulty of the task it will face, because the Wild Women shut them out 20-0 when they met last week. 
However, Lyons has a new source of confidence as it just played its best game of the sea­son on Tuesday against Cavanaugh, becoming the first team to score a touchdown on the Chaos all season and show­ing remarkable defensive resilience. 
They lost, but gave Cavanaugh a strong challenge, and captain Katie Mackin said she and her team are confident heading into Sunday. 
"After our game against Cavanaugh, we are starting to pick up momentum," she said. "We had practice today and will again on Saturday. We know Walsh's plays, offensive and defensive, and we think we can play well against them." 
Walsh, meanwhile, looks to hold onto its No. 2 seed in the Women's Blue league heading into the playoffs and would like nothing more than a solid win to boost its confidencn. However, the Wild Women are assured a playoff bnrth no mat­ter the outcome. 
TIHl game looms at H p.m. Sunday night on Hiehle Wnst. 
Pangborn vs. Pasquerllla East 
On Sunday at the West Quad fields, the Phoxes of Pangborn will take on tho Pyros of Pasquerilla East in a game with playoff implieations. 
In the Women's Gold Leagun, Pangborn, as of thn latest released standings, sat a half game behind second-place Welsh Family, and one game behind first-place McGlinn, which handed the Phoxes their only loss of the season. 
Pasquerilla East, at 1-3, needs a win to stay in the hunt for tho playoff's. 
In the Gold Lnague, four teams make the playoffs. MeGlinn and Welsh Family sit in strong positions for the first two, but the last two may eomn down to tho final slate of games as the other live teams are still in the hunt. 
So far, the tnams have playnd two common opponents. Both lost to McGlinn -PE fell, 20-0, and Pangborn, 6-0. Pangborn defeated Pasquerilla West, IH­0, while PE camn up a toueh­down short against its neigh­bors, 19-13. 
With so much at stake, fans can be sure they will witness a hard-played and omotionally­eharged game Sunday.

MEN'S INTERHALL-BLUE LEAGUE 
Knott, Carroll lock horns 
By CATHERINE KANE, 
CHRIS HINE and 
JAMES FEGAN 
Sports Writers 

Hailing from extreme sides of campus, Knott and Carroll are preparing for what could prove to be an exciting game on Sunday at Riehle field. 
"These are two totally differ­ent football teams," Carroll cap­tain Kory Wilmot said. 
And they come to the field with two different goals. 
Carroll posts a 2-1 record with a loss only to Zahm in the first game of the season. 
The team hopes to advance its standings for the playoffs, this being its final game of the regu­lar season. Knott, on the other hand, is looking for at least one win this season. Having lost both of its games this year, Knott is more focused on secur­ing at least one victory. 
"Carroll has obviously had more success than we have so far this year, so they are proba­bly the favorites on Sunday, but we are going to go out and give it our best shot," Knott captain Dan Gray said. 
Carroll hopes to continue uti­lizing its passing offense, which, besides its first game, has proved successful. 
The squad came away with .a six-point victory against Siegfried and a 28-point blowout against Fisher last week. Ironically, the two teams that Carroll has beaten are the two that defeated Knott. 
Carroll wants to chance to prove its skill. 
"[We want to take] another opportunity to show everyone that we are as good as any team in interhall," Wilmot said. 
And each team seems confi­dent in the improvements it has made so far this season. 
Even though Knott comes into the game on Sunday as the underdog, Gray is optimistic. 
"We've made some improve­ments in the last two weeks and hopefully we can translate them into a win," he said. 
Fisher vs. Sorin 

The Sorin Otter's (1-2) will take on the Green Wave of Fisher Hall (1-1) Sunday in a Blue League contest that has playoff implications for both squads. Sorin would be out if it loses. If Fisher loses, they are essentially out of the playoffs, barring a miraculous series of events in the final set of games that would get them in due to a technicality. 
Sorin is looking to jump-start an offense that has only one touchdown in three games. The Otters feature Stu Mora at quarterback and Pat Lopez at running back. 
"We're trying to make the offense a little more produc­tive," Sorin captain Pete Lavorini said. "Hopefully, the defense will play as tough as it always has and our offense can live up to its potential." 
The defense thus far has one shutout and has given up a combined 22 points in Sorin's two losses. Lavorini said his team understands how crucial it is to win this game, but it doesn't feel any added pres­sure. 
"We're just going to go out and play our best," he said. 
Fisher opened its season with a 6-0 win over Knott and is looking to avenge a 28-0 defeat last week at the hands of Carroll. On offense, Fisher fea­tures sophomore Patrick Gotebeski at quarterback and running back Tom Sullivan. 
"This week at practice we focused on fundamentals and we feel ready to go," Gotebeski said. 
· On defense, Fisher hopes to fix a pass defense that surren­dered four touchdown passes last week to Carroll. The Green Wave features the tough line­backing corps of Andrew Lorenz, Tommy Bufalino and Mike Bufalino. 
The game will be held at 3 
p.m. on Riehle North Field. 
Siegfried vs. St. Ed's 
Siegfried (2-1) looks to end its regular season by clinching a playoff berth against St. Ed's (0­
2) this Sunday at 2 p.m. With a win, Siegfried will punch its ticket for the playoff, while another loss leaves its destiny hinging on the result of other games. At 0-2, St Ed's playoff

ambitions are on life support ­the Stedsmen need a win and help from others to have a chance. 
Siegfried will depend on its juggernaut defense to carry it Sunday, as it has all year. 

Throughout its offensive trou­bles, Siegfried has forced turnovers and made defensive scores to carry it to the brink of a playoff berth. 
Siegfried's offense has man­aged only one touchdown all season, and has gotten just as many points this year from kicker Pablo Diaz as it has from offensive skill players. The squad is hoping that it can work out its difficulties against St. Ed's defense before moving on to the playoffs. 
The St. Ed's defense desper­ately needs to forget the 29-0 razing it received at the hands of Zahm and return to more consistent play. 
After holding Sorin to one touchdown, the Stedsmen got torched by Zahm 's rushing attack, giving up big plays by the fistful. Adding to the issues that the Stedsmen have is the fact that they have yet to put any points on the board yet this season. 
After a sloppy close loss to Sorin and a drubbing at the hands of Zahm, a season that started with playoff ambitions is now in danger of being effec­tively ended. 
If the Stedsmen want to play after fall break, they will need to overcome a powerful Siegfried defense.

MEN'S INTERHALL -GOLD LEAGUE 
O'Neill, 'Roos ready for Mod Quad battle 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 

Sunday's game between O'Neill and Keough holds major playoff implications for the Mob, while Keough comes into the game attempting to get its first win of the season. 
O'Neill, which had a bye last week but lost to Morrissey 6-2 the previous week, has had two weeks to prepare for this game, and the Mob has used the extra time to their advantage. 
"The first week we just emphasized going back to fundamentals, but this past week we've been preparing for both the Keough offense and defense," O'Neill cap­tain Matt Hughey said. 
Hughey also said that O'Neill was installing some new offensive plays they felt would be advantageous against the Keough defense. These new plays are intend­ed to get the Mob offense back on track after it was umible to put up any points against Morrissey. 
Keough is also entering Sunday's game with its last result being a loss to Morrissey. 
The Kangaroos were soundly defeated 21-6, as they were unable to stop Morrissey running back Nick Klein, who ran for 141 yards on 18 carries and three touchdowns. 
However, the absence of two of Keough's starting linebackers undoubtedly 
contributed to Klein's stellar performance. 
"We had a lot of inexperi­ence at linebacker because of forced adjustments, and we weren't able to prevent their running game from going outside," Keough cap­tain Zach Brown said. 
The regular linebacker core for Keough will be back to full strength for this week's game, which will make it more difficult for O'Neill to find running. 
The game is Sunday at 1 
p.m. on Riehle FB South. 
Alumni vs. Stanford 

The Dawgs face off against the Griffins in a pivotal bat­tle with a potential playoff spot on the line. 
With both teams stuck in the middle of the competi­tive Men's Gold League, Sunday's contest could ulti­mately be the difference between a ticket to the play­off -and a chance to play in Notre Dame Stadium in the championship game ­and a trip home. 
The contest kicks off at 2 
p.m. on Riehle FB South. 
Dillon vs. Morrissey 

The Big Red and Manorites are slated to meet Sunday afternoon at 3 on Riehle FB South in a Men's Gold League showdown. After vic­tories in its first two games, Morrissey is in prime posi­tion to make a long playoff run.

MLB PLAYOFFS -AL 
Defending chan1pion Boston needs victories 

Associated Press BOSTON -For once, the Boston Red Sox have history on their side. Heading into Friday's game against the White Sox at Fenway Park, the team that went 86 years between World Series titles is undaunted by Chicago's 2-0 lead. 
After all, these Hed Sox over­came a 3-0 deficit against the New York Yankees to win the AL 
championship last year. They're 8-1 in games in which they faced playoff elimination since 2003. 
And they had the best home record in the majors this season. 
Every experience you have helps you," Roston manager Terry Francona said Thursday. "If players or me or the coaches or somebody can pull something positive from that experience, good." 
The White Sox haven't been World Series champions since 1917, the year before Boston won it -and they're not about to get comfortable now. 
"When your enemy's down, you've got to keep your enemy down," Chicago manager Ozzie Guillen said. "You make some noise and you wake up the mon­ster, you're going to be in trou­ble." 
Freddy Garda, who pitched much better on the road this sea­son, will try to elose out the series for the White Sox. Boston knuckleballer Tim Wakefield will try to prevent that. 
"We've been in this situation before," Wakefield said. "Now that we're baek at home playing in front of our home crowd, there's still a chance."

MEN'S SWIMMING 

Irish open new year at 41st Starks Relays 
By JACK THORNTON Sports Writer 
When the defending Big East Champion men's swim­ming team opens its season today at 6:30p.m. at the 41st Dennis Starks Relay at Rolfs Aquatic Center, the exhibi­tion atmosphere will give the squad an opportunity to gauge this year's potential in a thrilling but relaxed atmos­phere. 
"It'll be both exciting and laid-back," head coach Tim Welsh said. "It's exciting because it's everybody's first meet of the season, and it's exciting because relays bring a lot of energy ... and it's laid back for the same reasons ­

because it's that "I don't mean this 10 seniors. first meet of the the the wrong way, "We want to

Tim Welsh 
The relay, As the first
Irish coach 
which is named in honor of for­mer Notre Dame swimming coach Dennis Starks, will fea­ture Ball State, Cleveland State, Marquette, Oakland (Mich.), Valparaiso and Wisconsin-Milwaukee. 
Walsh said those are some solid opponents, but his swimmers won't be compet­ing with the men in the next lane. 
"I don't mean this in the wrong way, but we want to race the clock," Welsh said. "When we look at the meet from our point of view, we're not looking at trying to beat a particular team, but rathe_r racing the clock and finding out where we are and getting better." 
After winning its first-ever Big East Title and sending its first swimmer. junior Tim Kegelman, to the NCAA Championship in Minneapolis last year, the team is looking to build on its success in the conference and on the national level. 
"We want to win Beg East again by even a larger mar­gin of victory, and we'd like to send even more guys to the NCAAs at the end," co­captain Patrick Heffernan said. 
Welsh emphasized disci­pline as the key to achieving those goals. 
"With getting faster there's no magic word that will help you achieve that," Welsh said. "It's 'Do we have the skill, do we have the desire, do we have the fitness, the heart and do we have the discipline?' 

"If we improve enough, we'll be Big East Champions. If we improve beyond that, we'll send more than one to NCAA championship and more than that we'll score for the first time at the NCAA championships." 
The squad will have to make up for the loss of grad­uating seniors Matt Bertky, Frank Krakowski, Dave Moison and Andrew Pittman. Nonetheless, experience and leadership should make up for any shortcomings as the Class of 2006 provides the men's swim­ming team with

season, Friday night will provide coaches with the opportunity to eval­uate each individual swim­mer, but special focus will be put on the freshmen. 
"If this was a football game, everybody gets in; if this was a basketball game, everybody plays a quarter," Welsh said. "What we're looking for is how fit is everybody, how race-ready is everybody, what sort of skill level at racing speeds -do we start well, turn well, breathe properly? But emphasis will be on the freshman because we haven't seen them race in this pool before." 
In addition to talent and the natural level of competi­tiveness, the incoming class will bring with it at least a smidgen of sibling rivalry. Three of the incoming fresh­men have older brothers on the team, something that has never happened in the 21 years that Welsh has been coach. 
"It's kind of funny because we have quite a few fresh­men, but this made assimi­lating them into the group a lot easier, because we've seen a lot of them at meets and practices, so they've added to the family atmos­phere," Heffernan said.

MEN'S GOLF 

Team journeys to Durham 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN Associate Sports Editor 
The Irish will travel to Durham, 
North Carolina to take part in the 
Coca-Cola Duke Golf Classic this 
weekend -the same place where 
head coach Jim Kubinski coached 
for a year and a half before coming 
to Notre Dame. 
Despite the retum to his old team, 
Kubinski is not thinking about the 
homecoming, instead putting 
emphasis on what hi<> team needs to 
do to win. 
''I'm going to approach it as busi­
ness as usual," Kubinski said. "We 
can't have any distractions, and I 
think that would be kind of a dis­
traction. We're ju<>t going to go there 
with business as usual." 
If Notre Dame is going to be suc­
cessful thi<> weekmd, it will have to 
putt well. 
"The only thing that kept us from winning last wenk L<> that we didn't ·make a<> many putt<>," Kubinski said. 

"I think we [have to] putt well, and I think we will because it's our second tournament in a row in the south east. Ifthe putts drop, I think we are hitting the ball as well as anyone in the country." 
The same team that traveled to last weekend's Shoal Creek Intercollegiate will be heading to North Carolina. 
Scott Gustafson, Mark Baldwin, Eric Deutsch, Cole Isban and Greg Hodgers will compete against some of the top ACC and Big Ten schools in the nation. 
"With the field coming, we got a lot of good teams playing there," Kubinski said. "I think you're going to have to shoot some good num­bers, you're not going to be able to just kind of put it in cruL<>e control. We're going to have to play hard, and we're going to have to play well." 
Duke, North Carolina and NC State are three of the ACC teams that will be competing. Big Ten teams Ohio State, Penn State, Northwestern and Minnesota will also play at the course that Kubinski has a lot of appreciation for. 
"I think it's a great golf course," Kubinski said. "It's a great test of golffor us." 
The Irish will look to lsban to con­tinue to lead them this weekend. Isban has been hot lately, with an average under 71 since he shot an 80 in the opening round of the Gopher Invitational. 
"lie's really come into his own and dofinitely had a breakout week last week," Kubinski said. 
Isban finished in first place at Shoal Creek after firing rounds of 69-69-72. He lost in a playofl'to Ea<>t Tennessee State's Rhys Davis, a Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup player and Tennessee's Jonathon Mount. 
Notre Dame will play Sunday and Monday befi>re returning to South Bend on Monday night.

MEN'S SOCCER NO WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL 
Irish W"ill host No. 9 Connecticut Saturday 
By KATE GALES Associate Spons Editor 
A 1-0 win Wndnesday was just the appntizer needed hef'orn a Saturday night home game against the No. 9 Connneticut lluskies. 
Thn lluskins are first in the Big East and have bnnn ranked as high as No. I this season. 
"Playing oil' any win gets you mornontum," coach Bobby Clark said. "I always say win­ning's a habit and losing's a habit. The morn you win, the more it bocomes a habit, and you want to knep that going." 
After dropping out of the national rankings, the Irish are looking to return to the spot­light with an upset win before going on the road for four straight games. 
"IThn tnam is! very excited for tlw game with Connecticut," Clark said. "This is obviously a big game for us and it'll be a good test for us. This is a good team eoming in ... this will b1~ a vnry good tnst for us." 
The Irish have benn up and down this season. but have not lost since Sept. 25 in a 2-1 horne loss to Cincinnati. Their win against Marquette Wednesday improved the team to 7-3-1 (:{-2-1 Big East). 
Against Marquette, .Justin Md;onrwy marked the only scorn of the contest. Goalkeeper Chris Cahill recorded his fifth shutout of the season with tho 1-0 vietory. Clark said that dnf'ensn was a highlight of the road game. 
"Dale [Hnllasl and Benny Crouse were superb," Clark 
said. "ThP.y were the backbone of the team at MarquP.tte. Marquettn is a very direct team and a vnry aerial team, and we had to handle that threat." 
On the offensive side, the Irish had a 10-7 shot advan­tage, and Cahill recorded two saves. 
"A few other people took their leads from [Hellas and Crouse], and I thought Kurt IMartin I had an excellent game," Clark said. "It really was a tnam performance, there was nobody who didn't play well." 
The win gives the Irish some much-needed momentum going into one of the season's most challenging eontests. 
"It should be an opportunity for us to really get baek into the national prominence," Clark said. "We've been doing well, we've been working away but you want to win a couple of big games, and this should be a niee big game and a nice time in the snason for us to win." 
The game last year at Connecticut drew more than 5,000 spectators, many of them students. Clark hopes that the game will draw a large per­formance, especially as most other sports are oil' or away. 
"We play Connectieut, it's always a huge game," Clark said. 
The tnam will takn the 11eld on Saturday at 7 p.m. With luck, thn momentum will keep coming. 
"A winning habit's a pretty good habit to keep," Clark said.

with the amount of undefeated teams ahead of them in the country. 
"I think the only thing we can control is us," Waldrum said. "I think we need to win as many of the remaining games as we pos­sibly can. Unfortunately, there are some teams in front of us ... that haven't lost yet. We'd prob­ably need a little bit of help to get a No.4 seed." 
But before the Irish can worry about seeding in the NCAA tour­nament, they have to deal with winning this weekend against the two Big East teams from New Jersey. 
In Hutgers and Seton Hall, Notre Dame will encounter two very difl"erent opponents. 
Waldrum expects Rutgers to attack the Notre Dame defense, something that most teams avoid when they play the Irish, opting instead to wait for an Irish mistake. 
"I think Rutgers is going to

girls take a lot of stock in know­ing that I've been here and I've been through what they're going through," Nixon said. "I know with midterms coming up this week how tired you get, and I know how hard it is to push through it, but I know you have to keep pushing. 
"I love Notre Dame, and I hope that bleeds into the girls." 
Key for the upcoming season will be the return of team MVP Katie Carroll. 
''I'm so pumped up for Katie ­she's a great leader," Nixon said. "She understands the meaning of hard work and really embraces that. She's really great, and she's a joy to have around. In order to be a top-10 program, we have to have athletes that are in the top 10 in their respective events. One of those is Katie Carroll." 
Nixon said that Carroll, who earned All-America honors last year, played an important role in making sure the coaching change went smoothly. 
"She's been a big part of [the

come out and try to play us," Waldrum said. "They always have. They are not a team that really sits back. 
"They've been one of the Big East teams that has been fairly successful against us the last few years, and the games have all been close." 
Waldrum anticipates a close game with not a lot of goal scor­ing because of the intensity that Rutgers will bring after strug­gling in the Big East so far this season. 
Seton Hall is a team that is usually very aggressive, some­times so much so that Waldrum is not sure whether or not their attitude is over the top. 
"[Seton Hall has] no real, real special players, but it is a really physical team," Waldrum said. "Almost borderline, is it good, clean physical play or is it cross­ing the edge a little bit into the other side?" 
The Irish will play Rutgers Friday at 7 p.m. and will chal­lenge Seton Hall Sunday at 1 p.m.

transition] as far as helping me realize what we were missing last year, what things we can do better," Nixon said. "She and I have a great relationship, so it's easy for us to talk about those things." 
The format for the Stark relays will be different from other meets. There will be only one individual contest, one-meter diving. Most of each team's score will come from a series of relays. 
Nixon said the format will be a big help to freshmen Claire Hutchinson, Christa Riggins and Casey Wagner, who will all be competing in their first collegiate meet. 
"It's kind of an icebreaker for the freshmen," Nixon said. "It gives them a chance to be in the team atmosphere without the individual pressure of perform­ing or trying to prove themselves in the first meet. A lot of fresh­men feel like the have to do their lifetime best in the first meet, and this relay format just takes a lot of pressure off them." 
The meet begins at 6:30 p.m. today at the Rolfs Aquatic Center.

20-yard line. 
The game began with a 60­yard score by Farley on the fourth play of the series, and Farley was able to quickly intercept the ball on PE's ensu­ing drive. They were unable to score, and PE scored on 77­yard completion to Megan Conway. The rest of the half was all Farley, with their third and fourth touchdowns going for 58 and 18 yards, respective­ly. PE got one last chance to score before halftime, but time ra,n out just after they made their way onto Farley's side of the field. 
"It was an amazing game," Popik said. "I was very pleased. I just wish we had played bet­ter earlier in the season." 
Farley's playoff status is still in doubt, but the squad has put itself in a good position to make the postseason with this win. Popik and Duran both stressed the importance of their coach­ing staff, some of whom are members of the Keenan inter­hall team, in their win as well. 
"The coaches have done a great job," Duran said. "They come straight from their own practices to coach us." 
In addition to Duran's touch­down reception, Jenny Rolfs caught two scoring passes from Popik, and Kim Crehan caught one. 
Paul and Pat Rigney, brothers who coach the PE team, were proud of their team despite the loss. 
'The girls really played hard, showed a lot of effort," Pat Rigney said. "We gave up some big plays, got unlucky, and that made the difference." 
Paul also acknowledged the tough matchup. "Farley was talented -they had a lot of good players," Paul 
Rigney said. "We've just got to work hard for Sunday." 
Pangborn 21, Welsh Fam. 6 
The Pangborn Phoxes put up 21 unanswered points in the first half and were able to hold off a second-half Whirlwind offensive effort to win over Welsh Family Thursday. It was the second straight victory for a Pangborn squad that sought to prove itself against the team that denied it an unbeaten sea­son last year. 
The Phoxes found their rhythm early, jumping out to a 21-0 lead in the first half behind an impressive offensive performance. Katie Mooney connected with Katie Riemersma and Brinn Johnson for touchdown catches, and Trish Connelley ran for another as the Phoxes took a command­ing lead into halftime. 
The Pangborn defense did its part by preventing a Whirlwind score in the first half. Amanda Dosch came out with a momen­tum-shifting interception early on to help keep the Phoxes on top 21-0 going into halftime. Pangborn captain Katie Murray was pleased with her team's play in the first period. 
"The first half was just amaz­ing," Murray said. "We really just need to be playing like that the whole time." 
"Our offense came out really strong and we were just really pumped coming into the game," Johnson said. "Our defense played awesome as well." 
Though the Pangborn offense took charge early, a motivated Welsh Family squad came out strong in the second· half and shut down what had appeared to be an unstoppable Pangborn attack. Though the Whirlwinds could not come up with the vic­tory, coaches Tom Chesnick and Ben McClain were pleased with their team's second half effort. 
"We're proud of the girls' sec­ond half performance, and the effort they showed despite being down three scores," Chesnick said. "Even though we took the loss, there are still definitely some good things that come out of the game." 
In addition to an impressive second half defensive perform­ance, the Whirlwind offense also came out strong after half­time. The Whirlwinds drove to the Pangborn 3-yard line but were unable to score due in large part to a stingy Pangborn defense which tipped two pass­es at the goal line. On the next Welsh Family possession, Melissa Sands connected with Jenni Gargula for 16-yard touchdown but, with time run­ning out, it was too little, too late for the Whirlwinds. 
"We were able to make some good adjustments after the first half," McClain said. 
"We were till able to get right back in it even after being down by three scores." 
Pasquerilla West 13 Breen-Phillips 6 
The Purple Weasels knocked off the Babes in Women's Interhall Gold League action Thursday. 
The Weasels scored two unanswered touchdowns after Breen-Phillips took a 6-0 lead. 
Maureen Spring scored both touchdowns for the Weasels, with a game-tying catch and an interception return for a touch­down with just over two min­utes left in the game, sealing the victory for Pasquerilla West. 
The Weasels took the lead on the ensuing possession after the Babes' go-ahead touch­down. Spring's reception, com­bined with a successful extra point, gave Pasqerilla West a lead it would not relinquish.

Battle preparation 
Weis says he wants to accomodate fans with stadium rally 
By MIKE GILLON 
Sports Editor 
Disappointed that several thousand fans were turned away from last month's Michigan State pre-game pep rally, Irish coach Charlie Weis spurred the decision to move next Friday's USC pep rally outdoors to Notre Dame Stadium. 
Speaking at his press confer­ence Thursday, Weis said he talked to Notre Dame athletic department officials and encouraged them to move the event to a larger venue after hearing that approximately 5,000 fans were turned away from the Sept. 16 Michigan State rally. 
"I think [if1 the fans want to be going to the pep rally, they should have a venue to be able to go," Weis said. "We just felt it was the best thing for the fans was to give them the opportunity to be a part of the experience." 

Oct. 14's rally will be the first Notre Dame pep rally held in the Stadium since the Irish played No. l Nebraska in 2000. 
Gameday heading to ND 
ESPN's College Gameday program will broadcast from the Notre Dame campus the morning of the USC game, according to Gameday host Kirk Herbstreit. 
"From what I understand Gameday will be in South Bend next weekend, and I can't wait to see my Irish ballclub in per­son," Herbstreit said in an ESPN.com Internet chat ses­sion. 
The former Ohio State quar­terback, who hosts Gameday along with Chris Fowler and Lee Corso, is looking forward to the matchup between the No. 12 Irish and No. 1 Trojans. 
"I'm going to go on record and say that [this] Gameday will be the most hyped-up show that I've experienced in the 10 years I've been on the show," he said. "I can't wait to get to South Bend for that one." 
A little relaxation 
With no game this Saturday, Weis has more time to prepare for USC. But he will also spend a little quality time with his family. 

"First I will get Charlie [Jr.] a haircut Saturday morning, and then I will videotape Maura riding on her horse before that," Weis said of his son and wife. 
Weis then plans to head 

home to watch USC take on Arizona Saturday afternoon. But his leisure time won't last long. 
"We will be in Sunday morn­ing to gameplan USC," Weis said.

WOMEN'S INTERHALL 
Popik and Farley-win againstPE 
By TIM KAISER and JASON GALVAN Sports Writers 
Farley quarterback Katie Popik's touchdown pass in the waning minutes of the second half helped the Finest put the game out of reach of the Pyros of Pasquerilla East Thursday. 
The touchdown was the only score of the second half, and Popik's fourth of the game. She threw for a total of 200 yards in the contest. 
Down 20-6 at the start of the second half, PE lost the ball on downs, but stopped the Farley ofl"ense inside PE's 20-yard line on its next drive. The Farley defense intercepted the ball on PE's first play of the series, but quickly gave the ball back when Courtney Chen intercepted a wayward pass by Popik. The PE offense wasn't able to mount a drive, and Diane Duran set up the ofl"ense for Popik's fourth TO with an interception on the PE

Irish travel to coast for two games 
Team will square off against Big East foes in weekend action 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN Associate Sports Editor 
The defending national champions, treading in some dangerous water with two reg­ular-season losses, will travel to New Jersey this weekend to play Rutgers and Seton Hall. 
Notre Dame (10-2-0, 4-1-0) will need to have an impressive weekend in order to regain its top-tier recognition of teams around the nation. 
"I feel great and confident, but I don't play," Irish coach Randy Waldrum said. "I think it's a big weekend for us to be able to show everybody around the conference and country that it was just a little slip up, and we're still on track." 
With six regular season games left, the Irish are in a situation where they need to win as many games as possible to assure home-field advantage in the postseason. 


"If we go up there and strug­gle this weekend, we may have some [trouble] through the rest of the season," Waldrum said. 
After Notre Dame's loss Friday at Marquette, Waldrum understands how important every game will be heading into the Big East tournament

ND WOMEN'S SWIMMING 
Team prepares for Dennis Starks Relays 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Writer 
Four years ago, Carrie Nixon was preparing for her final Dennis Stark Relays as a mem­ber of the Notre Dame swim team. 
Friday, she will experience her first Stark Relays as head coach of the Fighting Irish. 
The Relays, which traditionally begin the season for the Irish, have been held every year since 1964. This year, Notre Dame will host Illinois State, Ball State, Oakland, Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Valparaiso, Cleveland State and Marquette. 
Nixon said the meet will offer the team an opportunity to gain confidence before the dual meet season, which begins Oct. 28 against California. 
"We have to learn how to race and how to swim our own events so we can go into the dual meets with confidence," Nixon said. 
Nixon, who was promoted to replace former head coach Bailey Weathers after he resigned in March, is attempting to bring a new spirit of team­work and unity to the Irish. 
"The biggest thing that we've changed is the attitude and how we approach the sport of swim­ming," Nixon said. "We try to inspire the girls, make them bet­ter leaders, better athletes, bet­ter people and better students. 
"Our biggest emphasis for the year having a great team, being supportive of each other's strengths and weaknesses and really embracing everything we do as a team together." 
As a Notre Dame graduate, Nixon feels she has a unique bond with her athletes and that she can understand their day-to­day life. ·
