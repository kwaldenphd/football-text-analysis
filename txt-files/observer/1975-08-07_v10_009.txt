In response to international critics, State Department has pointed out that the controversial American Evacuation of Orphans from Vietnam in April was not without historical precedent. 
"Many times in the past, humanitarians have come forth to aid the infant victims of international clashes and catastrophes," declared a State Department spokesman. 
He went on to note that during the seventeenth and eithteenth centuries, Portugese ship captains rescued thousands of helpless children from the strife and political chaos then afflicting the continent of Africa, while during the Middle Ages, courageous bands of gypsies conducted a lonely campaign to free European babies from medieval towns threatened in the Dark Ages. 
And, in 1284, P. Piper, Westphalian am­
bassador, responded to the alarming plight 
of youngsters in rat-endangered Hamelin 
towns by organizing a massive footlift to the 
nearby secure insides of a mountain.

Veterans Administration officials are investigating the case of a paralyzed former marine who was apparently left in an elevator in which he rode up and down for 27 hours. The hospital is located in Chicago. 
Erwin A. Pawelski, 54, was admitted after suffering a blood clot at his home. Donald La Rocque, assistant to the hospital's chief of staff, gave this account of Pawleski's long ride, which he said did not contribute to his death 17 days later: Pawelski, strapped to a wheelchair and unable to walk because of the stroke, was taken by an attendant from a third-floor ward to an occupational therapy room for treatment about 9:30a.m. After treatment, he and another patient were taken to a bank of elevators by a hospital worker, who put Pawelski on the elevator, but for the next 27 hours he was missing. 
Eventually, he was found by a staff member, slumped over in his wheelchair on one of the three elevators in constant ser­vice. "As hard as it is to believe, I now think that he was on the elevator all that time," said a hospital official. He added that Pawelski suffered no ill effects, and "his death had no association or connection with the incident." 
."There are about 1,300 patients at Hines 
and 2,800employees," noted Vern Rogers, a 
spokesman for the V.A. "In all that traffic, a 
patient was lost." 

Dr. Robert Fruen, the director at Hines, 
added: "We can only assume that no one 
who happened to be in the elevator realized 
his condition."

Joseph A. LaFortune, a 1916 graduate and member of the Board of Trustees at the University of Notre Dame since 1941, died Tuesday night (Aug. 5) in a Colorado Springs, Colo., hospital. A resident of Tulsa, Okla, 81 year old LaFortune, had been vacationing at the time of his death. 
Funeral services will be held at 10 a.m. tomorrow, in Christ the King Church, 1530 S. Rockford, Tulsa. 
Mr. LaFortune majored in a special advertising-commerce sequence during his un­dergraduate days at Notre Dame. The South Bend native moved to Tulsa after graduation where he was employed by the Tulsa World newspaper and began a long 
association with the oil undustry. 
He was named deputy ad­ministrator of the Petroleum Association in Washington in 1953. 
Named to the Associate Board of Lay Trustees in 19411 Mr. LaFortune was reappointed to the Board of Trustees in 1967, and has served as trustee emeritus since 
1971.  He  received  an  honorary  
L.L.B.  doctorate  at  the  1949  
commencement  on  the  campus.  

A cash gift to the University in 1953 helped finance the renovation of the former Science Hall for the use as a student center, the present LaFortune Student Center. A scholarship fund in honor of their parents was presented to Notre Dame in 1960 by four children, Joseph Jr., and Robert, Jean Henry and Mary Ann Wilcox. His wife, Gertrude Tremel LaFortune is a native of Mishawaka.

Macheca and Roemer working togetherfor smooth transition 
by Andy Praschak Associate Editor 

It was officially announced on July, 31, that Dr. James A. Roemer would be replacing Mr. John Macheca as dean of students at the University of Notre Dame. With the appointment effective for only seven days now, both Macheca and Roemer are still reluctant to discuss any official plans for the future of the office of dean of students. "I am presently working with Dean Roemer to provide as much continuity as possible under the new dean," Macheca said. 
Macheca, who was the first lay dean of students ever appointed at the University of Notre Dame, explained that his job now is to help Roemer understand "what" has to be done as dean of students while leaving the choice of "how" the job is to be done to R H

oemer. e a1so exp ained 1 that much 
understanding and many concepts must be worked out before they can make any definite plans for the future public. 
Macheca, who was appointed to this position in 1973, noted that he first started thinking about devoting more time to his master's degree in May when he started discussing the possibilities with Br. Just Paczesny, vice president for student affairs. 
"I now feel that I will have the time to in­vestigaet the MSA program that I have been interested in," said Macheca. He said that when he first considered furthering his studies, he did not know exactly how this would affect his job as dean of students. 
"I've been here two years and the first year was spent mostly immersed in the process of learning how to be the dean of students. It was an awful lot of hard work. The second year I was beginning to adjust and it wasn't quite so demanding," said Macheca. 
A press release issued by the university on July 31, said that Macheca would serve as a special assistant to Brother Just next fall. Macheca commented that his job as special assistant would include working with Roemer as well as continuing to work with the Senior Club. "I want to be able to give the Senior Club and the Senior Class as much support as possible next year," he said. 

Macheca, who announced that his wife is -------r------. expecting a child in October, explained that his entire family will not take some time to decide exactly what he will be doing in the 
future. "However, I do plan to stay at Notre Dame for the next semester and probably for the entire year," he said. 
Macheca was careful to note that although he well be around to help Roemer as much as possible, each man brings his own per­sonality to a job such as this. 
Briefly reflecting on the past two years, Macheca pointed out that it was a very demanding job. "But it's a job that has to be done," he said. He continued, "We have to hold expectations up for eaeh other; that's the only way to continue to grow and better 

ourselves," he said. He said that he hoped that during his term he was able to do as much as he could to better the student's life. "When I took the job, I realized that this would not be a long-term one," he said. 
Dr. Roemer, who has been University counsel since October of 1972, felt that he was chosen for the job because of his close involvement with Notre Dame students throughout all his stay here. "Notre Dame students have been welcome in my house for the last five years," he boasted. 
Roemer has been involved with many student activities throughout the years. He was on the board of directors of the Neigh­borhood Study Help Program, in CILA and a board of director's member of the Om­budsman service here at Norre Dame. 
Brother Just officially made the ap­pointment although Roemer said that Just received input and recommendations from all members of the Notre Dame com­munity. Roemer, who prides himself on being a double domer, attending Moreau Seminary and "practically being born on the golf course", explained that his basic policy will be to emphasize the positive rather than the negative aspects of the students. 
Both Macheca and Roemer agreed that they will be happy to divulge more of their plans for the future and reflections on the past, probably at the end of the summer, when they manage to work out many of the details and concepts they are now discussing.

American-sponsored torture 
In a televised speech of April 16, 1953, President Eisenhower said, "Any nation's right to a form of government and an economic system of its own choosing is inalienable." Iran was in the process of choosing its own economic and political forms at that very moment. The country nationalized the oil companies run by England, and voted by 98 percent to back this move, along with its sponsor, Premier Mohammed Mosfadegh. The young shah of Iran had crumbled before Mosfadegh's popular strength. 
America did not like this show of in­dependence along the Russian border. If the country would not be England's puppet, then we would make it ours. A rival premier was found, and the shah was given CIA pep talks. CIA Director Allen Dulles went to Switzerland to orchestrate the men and money for a coup; and he sent one of his best spooks, Kermit Roosevelt, to the scene in Iran. 
K. Roosevelt known as "Kin" to his fellow spies, bought himself a mob and an army-­he is reported to have spent $19 million in the effort, and emptied Iran's health clubs of all beefy specimens to lead the mob. With things arranged for him in this way, behind a bought little mobil army of taxicabs, the timorous shah crept back from Rome, shither he had fled. Then President Eisenhower exempted American oil com­panies from monopoly statutes to set up the consortium taking oil out of Iran. So much for freedom of political and ecomomic choice. 
It was not surprising to find, earlier this year, that Northrop Corporation had paid bribes of at least $10 million to Iranian of­ficials. The principal adviser to Northrop in this area--for a fee of $75,000 a year-is none other than Kin Roosevelt. And guess who is our ambassador to Iran? Richard Helms, ex-director of the CIA, who has had sudden and drastic lapses of memory about CIA 

r:~arry wills 
activities under his directorship' And which country was the first to be allowed to hire American technicians with classified knowledge? Iran, of course. 
The shah is a fearful man, just the kind who panics and grows vindictive, like Richard Nixon. But the shah lives in a world without the free press and judiciary that plagued Nixon. Reports of torture, mass illegal imprisonments, and executions without trial, have not been confirmed by outside observers, because the shah has allowed no outside observers to check up on the fears expressed by the family and friends of missing prisoners. 
Yet we toast the shah at the White House, treat him to Ann-Margret's vulgar Las Vegas act, and give his wife an honorary Georgetown degree. Since we set up the shah's government for him,. and surround him with our money and spies and in­ternational operators--men like Helms and Roosevelt--we share the responsibility for terror and repression in that country. 
There are thousands of Iranian students in America, some of whom knew those reported as murdered under torture. For years they have tried to alert us to what we, in effect, have been doing to human beings with out tax dollars. Now they have gone on hunger strikes in four cities (Washington, Houston, Los Angeles and Chicago) to get visas for an international team of lawyers and doctors to investigate reports that prisoners are mistreated. Anyone who agrees with them can send a letter requesting this to the Iranian ambassador in Washington. 
Since we let the shah have our very best spies and spying equipment, and gave him a government to start with, and flaunted Ann­Margret 's thighs in his face, the least he might do is return and let us see the inside of his prisons.

Vice President Nelson Rockefeller and his wife were reading in their $35,000 bed the other night when Happy said to Nelson, "It says here that Bo Callaway, Ford's campaign manager, told the press President Ford may be looking for a younger man to be his running mate in 

1976." . 
"Don't pay any attention to what you read in the newspapers," Rockefeller said. "Gerry assured me he was behind me 1,000 percent." 
"Callaway also said that besides your age he finds you have no support in the South, the conservatives can't stand you and everyone he's talked to says you'd drag down the ticket." 
"No body's perfect," Rockefeller said. 
"I don't see how Callaway can say those things unless the President gave him the okay." 
"Don't be silly. Why would an honest, decent person like Gerry Ford pull the rug out from under his own Vice President?" 
"That's the question I'm asking you," Happy said. __ 
"I think the President told Callaway to cut my throat to get sympathy for me. It's part of the Southern strategy. Don't worry, Happy, Gerry needs me. After all, I'm a liberal." 
"All right then, Nelson, let me ask you this. Why did Mrs. Ronald Reagan call me this morning and ask the color of our drapes in the vice-presidential bedroom?" 
"She did?" 
"Yes, and when I told her it was a blue floral print she said, 'They'll have to go. Ronnie can't stand blue."' 
"What did you say?" 

"I said I didn't expect Ronnie to come into 
our bedroom" "And what did she say?" "Nothing. She just giggled." "I wouldn't put too much emphasis on one 
telephone call from Nancy Reagan. The President assured me we could decorate the vice-presidential house any way we wanted to, and he said he was looking forward to coming to dinner here as soon as the house was ready." 
"Did he say before or after January, 
1977?" "Come to think of it, he didn't." "Nelson, I think there's something going 
-on that you don't know about. Mrs. Howard Baker was over the other day measuring the living room. She said she wanted to know if her Persian rug would fit in it." "No kidding?" "And Mrs. John Connally came over with samples of new wallpaper for the bathrooms. And Mrs. Donald Rumsfeld called our cook and asked him if he'd be willing to stay on and work for her. Don't you see? It all adds up. Your job isn't as secure as you think it is." "Happy, don't be unhappy. This is all politics. After the dust settles, Gerry Ford is going to put his arm around my shoulder at the Republican Convention and say 'I want Rocky in my swimming pool for the next four years."' "Well, I'm glad you're so optimistic. But I'm going to tell you one thing. If I have to move out of here, I'm taking this bed with me." "It only cost $35,COO. Why are you worried about a little old bed?" "Because I don't want someone to put a plaque on it which says 'Nancy Reagan slept here."'

Many problems arise over the relations between words and Ideas. Some special problems arise over the relations between humans. See what you can do with these.

The Women's Political Caucus (WPC) is an organization of men and women who are active in many activities--locally, statewide and nationally. 
Some of the membership of the caucus includes the IUSB faculty. Gloria Kaufman, Professor of English, is the WPC mem­bership chairperson. Paula Auburn, Continuing Education, is the vice-president. Other members from IUSB are: Christa Maria Beardsley, German professor; Nicole Dominique, English professor; Patricia McNeal, history professor; Anne 
l ) Marie Poinsatte, foreign language; Donna Harlan, head of the Library. The annual dues for membership in the local, state and national WPC is $20. Ac­cording to Kaufman, a scholarship fund is
\ 
available to pay for the dues of women students who can not afford the membership dues. 
Ending Discrimination 
The WPC is divided into many task forces. 
"Women, minorities, and the handicapped are the last to be hired and the first to be fired," according to the WPC. Task Forces

station 1n September 
by Judy Smith IUSB Editor 
Beginning September 1, IUSB will have a radio station broadcasting from the former audio-visual room. The call letters are WVIU, which stand for the Voice of Indiana University. The station will be on an FM frequency, with a range of 50 miles. 
The station will employ about 48 people, according to Gerry Campbell, station manager. Larry Lovett is the program director and Mary Benninghoff is the news director. 
"We will get our news service from United Press International and the American In­ter Collegiate Broadcasting Association," said Campbell. 
The Public Broadcasting station will have a wide spectrum of music from classical to acid rock. The air time will be from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. seven days a week. 
Of the weekly programs will be Radio Theatre, airing on Saturday and possibly another day of the week, according to Lovett. The Children's Theatre will be one of the educational programs. The first program will be the Hobbit. Other shows include The Andersonville Trials and Sorry Wrong NumberL Most of the plays will be taped. However, Lovett said that some would be live, giving the students a chance to go to the radio station and see the reading of the plays. 


"Funding will come from the United States Government," said Campbell. "There is roughly four or five places we can get funding from. One is Health, Education and Welfare. The others are Corporation for 
.... Public Broadcasting, The National 
' ( 
,. 
J 
Association of Public Broadcasters and the National Defense. We can get funding from HEW for up to 10 years, and we hope to get some underwriting from local businesses." 
Campbell hopes to have credit and non­credit courses offered through the station. He said this would be a good community service. "The station is an outreach of IUSB. It is very hard with today's economics, for working couples, husband and wife, to get to school and take courses. This might be a change for the wife who works and takes care of the kids, or whatever the case may be, to get an education. I felt this was a need, when we started this idea, in the community." 
"I feel this is an extension of the campus, if not in fact physically then technically and spiritually," said Lovett. "The tower that we have is 360 feet tall which would give a radius of 50 miles. Technically and elec­tronically it is an extension of IUSB. The more people that know the happenings of IUSB, the more who may eventually come to IUSB. Radio is an aid and a tool." 

WVIU will feature two talk shows. "Rap Session" will be a conversation type program. Two people will man the mikes while the public calls in to talk about anything. "Hot Seat" will feature local controversal figures and open the telephone lines to the community. Hot Seat will be an issues and answers type of program. 
"Communications is a way to extend oneself. IUSB needs a voice; another ad­dition going into making the whole." said Lovett. 

locally, initiated by Kaufman, to improve employment possibilities of women. Em­ployment opportunities and fair treatment is one of the main concerns of the caucus 
The E.R.A. Amendment is still alive and being made known to the public by the WPC. 
According to Harlan, the E.R.A. is for the benefitof men and women. The right to a job with equal pay and the rights of women apply to men in the E.R.A. amendment. 
Kaufman said IUSB students will have the opportunity to join the WPC in the fall. Many activities will be planned in the fall by the WPC which will be of interest to the students. 
The Women's Committee on Sex Offenses and the caucus are jointly sponsoring Rape Prevention and Awareness Month in August. They will be informing the com­munity of : 1) the fact that a great number of rapes go unreported; 2) the fact that many victims do not know the procedure for reporting rape; 3) the fact that there is a social and emotional burden placed on the victim. 
On September 20, the caucus will have a Festival-Banquet to celebrate International Women's year. It will be held at St. Mary's College. At the banquet, the caucus will be awarding a plaque to a local woman for outstanding contribution to society. Rolande Parent is serving as ticket chairperson. 
The Sense o( Self-Women's Colloquium sponsored by the Michiana Coalition for International Women's Year and IUSB's Continuing Education will be on November 14 and 15. 
In October plans are being made to raise funds for candidates. The WPC is also working on a workshop on "Women in Government."

Special Services Program re-funded for 1975-76 
The federally-financed Special Services 
program at Indiana University at South Bend, designed to help low-income students the physically-handicapped and veterans t~ enter and stay in college, has been re-funded for 1975-76. 
A grant of $70,000 to underwrite the program has been made by the Office of Education of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The program is in its fifth year at IUSB. 
Michael S. Klaybor, director of the Special Services office, announced receipt of the grant. 
Special Services is part of the federal Trio Program designed to make higher education accessible to students who might not otherwise consider college. These in­clude low-income students, physically­handicapped persons and veterans. The program sponsors students for admission to IUSB and then offers academic and per­sonal support of help the student do well in 
Music Academy IUSB students 

the classroom. 
The program helps students through admission procedures, financial assistance, orientation, counseling, tutoring ;andcareer advice. 
Special Services students have access to the program's learning resource center at 1916 Mishawaka Ave., on the north edge of the IUSB campus. The center is supplied with books, typewriters, tape recorders, reading machines and magazines. It provides a focal point for social gatherings for students in the program. 
Last year, the program aided ap­proximately 220 students at IUSB, Klaybor said. 
He added that a high school visitation in the Michiana area is scheduled for some time in the fall to identify 60 students who might be interested in attending the Special Services comprehensive summer program next year. Information about requirements for the program can be obtained at the Special Services office on the IUSB campus.

A Music Academy for 
beginning and advanced students in piano, guitar or string instruments will be offered by the Continueing Education division of Indiana University at South Bend this fall. 
Designed for young people (over

Graduate 

Student recitals for those preparea to perform will be scheduled on the IUSB campus at the end of the academic year. 
Music Academy instruction for strings is through private lessons only, while piano and guitar in-

pre-enrollment schedule announced 
Graduate students in education at Indiana University at South Bend can pre-enroll for fall calss~ Tuesday through Thursday, July 29-31, from 3:30 to 7:30p.m. in the Greenlawn Hall lounge on the IUSB campus. 
Fall-semester classes begin Sept. 2. Fall registration will be hels Aug. 27 and 28. 
Pre-enrollment will allow graduate education students to 

select courses in advance of the registration period. Class assignments will be made after the pre-enrollment period ends, and 
students  will  be  notified  of  
assignments  before  registration  
begins.  

Schedules of classes for the fall can be obtained in most IUSB divisional and departmental of­fices. Schedules can be requested by mail from the University Relations office. 
structions will be offered both in private lessons and in group in­struction. 
The academy program will begin in mid-September and run for 14 weeks. Information and registration materials can be obtained from the IUSB Office of Continuing Education in Northside Hall.

must help himself. He must be educated. Understanding his own predicament, knowing the causes, and learning who to reach, who to talk to, is basic to the problem. 
As a result of the activities of people genuinely concerned, sufficient interest in consumer ween being has been generated. The attempt to develop an in­formed public is an ongoing struggle. Whatever the motives of our legislators may be to enact the laws they do, the businesses which serve the consumer are gradually becoming engulfed in a tangle of 
•.,...~.~· ··~ ...,...,... ,. ~-..-.~'0~:0:9',.,).

~­

governmental regulations and red tape that has reached deplorable proportions. It is simply too much .or many businesses and business people to cope with and the ·:co{l.­sumer unwittingly is further taxed and burdened. 
Accepting the proposition that consumers must be protected we should now ask ourselve~ what they are being protected from. It is not alone in the area of com­mercialism that they must be protected. Consumers should also be protected from the acts of government officials and most particularly elected government officials. Here exists an enormous vacuum. Consumers, or most of them anyway, know next to nothing a bout their voting record. Theyknow nothing about their incomes, their expense acr:ounts, their free jaunts here and there, their work habits, their duties. 
What  bills  do  they  vote  for  or  
against?  Do they vote at a ll?  Do  
they attend hearings?  

This information is available somewhere in Washington, but not readily so to me or to you or almost any consumer. It would seem quite qppropriate that the daily activities or at least the voting record of our lawmakers should be common knowledge to an other­wise poorly informed electorate. Elected officials on every level are accountable to their constituents. This too, you see falls under the heading of consumer protection. 
That fondly labeled word "disclosure" which has raised so much havoc in business and personal life should aalso apply to members of the government. The consumer, or constituent if you prefer, is entitled to know what his elected agent is doing in Washington. Without such disclosure how can the poor con­sumer know how to evaluate his position. Put very bluntly without such disclosure, how is the con­sumer protected from government itself. 
This letter is being written to you with the hope that what has been stated may perhaps inspire a decision on the part of the Editor of your excellent newspaper to ap­point one or two of your fine reporters to explore the subject and perhaps publish their findings on the over-kill aspect of consumer protection on the one part and under-informed aspect on the other part. I believe that it would be very well received and of great value to your readers who may be

To What Court? 
Dear Editor: To what court of 
appeals does a person turn for 
justice on this campus of beauty 
and academic peace and quiet. 
Beauty, yes, but where has all the 
quiet gone? 
Some two to three thousand 
graduates have invested nigh to 
$1000 to partake in the academic 
qualities of Notre Dame. Then 
rumors start to spread about the 
annual onslaught of the junior-high 
drum and cymbal corps. Next day, 
the distant sound of drums con­
firms all rumors. The distance 
blends the sounds into the 
monotonous hum of other human 
activiey, the blessed monotony 
necessary for success in bookland, 
especially during close-to-the-end 
pressures. Then, lo and behold, the 
sounding distance has vanished; 
and drums are sitting on the 
nearest window ledge, beating like 
sledge hammers on every cranial 
nerve ending. 
Now I ask you what is one to do: circulate a petition, join a picket line or maybe simply walk up to the nearest instructor and sweetly ask them to retreat to the nearest stadium or clearing beyone the center of campus. There are three other possible alternatives, in­volving a form of retreat for those in bookland. They could move, bag

If none of the above alternatives 
seem workable, then it is all back 
at the beginning: to what court of 
appeals does one turn? It might 
even be endured if it were a one­
time happening; but an annual 
event, that dreary anticipation 
would seem to require either a 
change in some calendars or else a 
possible change in address; if the 
latter choice turns out to be the 
only possible solution: i.e., co­
exist (detente) or leave, then all 
that can be said is it is surely a sad 
commentary on the status of 
American scholarship, within the 
total value structure of our society.

Taking sides 
tany prasc:ia 
Despite a flashy success at Uelsinki, Henry Kissinger has apparently been dealt one more setback in his crusade to make friends with nearly everybody. After taking both sides in Europe, the Middle East and Cyprus, the State Department still managed last week to turn up one expensive enemy: the United States Congress. 
It was, of course, Turkey af'ms sales that set Kissinger and the Legislature snapping at each other. But the strain became even worse this week when Lawmakers and the Administration --caught in a stalemate -stubbornly opted for the worst possible energy policy rather than surrender credit for a better one. 
Apparently, however, Congress is one foe the Ford Administration wants to keep. Now that foreign no-goods seem not so heavy, the President has been in need of someone with whom to do heroic battle. ·Given. the ho-hum list of Democratic Presidential hopefuls, the new Ford campaign has been stalled for some time without

Duggan was appointed president of 
Saint Mary's on February 24, 1975. 
Dr. William A. Hickey, who 
served as acting president of Saint

at the college. Sister Francesca 
Kennedy, CSC. has resumed her 
duties as the school's registrar, 
having served as acting vice

Politics of embarrassment 
The feeling, of course, is mutual. With Legislative-Executive relations reduced to little more I han the politics of em­barrassment, the Branches' "marriage" has been looking like a scene from Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe. The President, calling names and tearing calendars, has assailed a "spend­thrift" Congress, while legislative leaders have pictured Mr. Ford as the enemy of Labor, the Elderly, the Poor and Mother Nature. 
Both strategies, furthermore, seem to be working. Polls now put the President ahead of even such popular spenders as Uncandidate Edward Kennedy, but far behind among Labor, the Elderly and the Poor <Mother Nature is a traditional fence-straddler). Even complicated energy legislation ha~ 
An editorial in the current issue of 
the Notre t>ame Journal of 
Education calls for a special 
congress to examine the future 
direction of Catholic education. 
According to the article, the current pattern of failure of Catholic elementary and secon­dary schools is determined by financial strength or weakness. The authors reject this pattern as ''mindless" and suggest that "strategic intervention" based on empirical data about education should be used to control the future of catholic education. 
They offer seven alternatives to the present course and recommend I hat representatives from the Bishops Conference, NCEA and Catholic universities meet with teachers, parents and students in June 1976 to examine these and other alternatives. Their 
alternatives range from con­centrating a traditional educational effort in secondary or urban schools to developing an experimental program of education for human development. 
The editorial is written by Dr. Richard H. Metzcus, assistant professor of graduate studies in education at the University of Notre Dame, Dr. Gregory M. Holtz, Herbert Lehman College, City University of New York, Bronx, and Dr. Jerry G. Florent, educational consultant, University of Notre Dame.

the other for higher prices. 
In fact, if all the allegations are true, the entire government is engaged in an all-consuming effort to strangle itself. 
No matter. The Branches were, after all, set up to behave this way, and the tattling is supposed to be what keeps them honest. But when both sides come up with egg on their face, the real problem is to find someone to play the hero. 
Castor oil 
Intuitively, Mr. Ford's Trumanesque position seems the weaker. He is not, after all, con­fronted with a do-nothing Congress; he has been vetoing popular bills at the rate of one a week. An effective challenger (of which the Democrats haven't many) might easily exploit Presidential vetos of such vote­getters as Conservation, Public Jobs, Housing and Health Care.

"Ten Nights in a Barroom" 

review by ralph brovoco 
During the mid 1960's Mary Martin <you remember her don't you? Peter Pan?> starred on Broadway in an ill-fated musical called "Jennie". "Jennie" was a fictionalized account of the not so happy marriage of playwright Charles Taylor, the tum-of-the­century king of melodrama and his actress wife Laurette Taylor. As a prologue·to the marital saga of " Jennie" the curtain rose on what might have been a typical Taylor melodrama. <It was titled "The Mounty Gets His Man or Chang Lu, King of the White Slavers"). Here, we found a wide 

eyed Miss Martin as Our Melissa <sigh> trying desperately to rescue 
herself and her baby from the clutches of Chang Lu -truly a villi an's villi an. <Boo! Hiss! ) Their demise seemed imminent when suddenly (emphasis on "suddenly") the Royal Mounty, our hero (applause, cheer) ap­pears not only to rescue Our Melissa and Capture Chang Lu and his lackies but also to Kill a local bear who gets in his way. Happy ending. <Relief.) 
Unfortunately, "Jennie" peaked during the hilarious prologue When the more serious business of the play began to unfold, not even Mary Martinwas able to rescue us

from that theatrical villian called boredom. (curses! ) 
I couldn't keep from wondering why the authors of "Jennie" didn't maintain the comic mood of the prologue and perhaps write a, show which would spoof the btooa and thunder of the old Taylor melodramas. Last week the SMC­ND Theatre presented "Ten Nights in a Barroom", a full length 
musical parody on an old melodrama, and I wondered no more. For an evening's en­tertainment spoofing a melodrama wears pretty thin and the idea becomes somewhat old even before the first act curtain . 
"Ten Nights in a Barroom" is a musical spoof in the three acts based on an 1858 Temperance Drama of the same name. The original version of "Ten Nights", written by William Pratt from a novel by T.S. Arthur, was first performed as a serious sermon against the evils of alcohol. It was made into a full length film in 1921 and in 1928 the play was again performed for 111 performances at the Wallack Theater in New York. The New York Times reported that this 1928 version was performed "with a straight face and no

become tedious. 
Tho' weakened the material might be, the energy and spirit of the SMC-ND players was never dampened. Every member of the cast of seventeen was simply superb. First of all, there is Katherine Burke as the Saloon Canary, Goldie Hills. Her first act entrance was a moment of mad perfection ("Nail down the bar boys, Goldie's here!) A troupe of waiters singing sixteen verses of "Hello, Goldie!" couldn't have improved it. Miss Burke's throaty chirping of the Harry 0. Sulton 1904 classic "I Don't Care" was enough to turn any red blooded boozer three hundred and sixty degrees on his bar stool. Every musical should own a Katherine , Burke. Katherene Wales' little­Eva-like death scene had precisely the right amount of silliness to make it one of the truly comic moments of the evening. Mary Toll, as the wife of the tavern owner, with her repetitive "0 how happy we were at the old mill" stole more than a chuckle from very receptive audience and, Kirk Packo as the villian Harvey Green won more than his share of boos and hisses as he cheated young Reginald Bain Jr. out of his well earned mild money. 
However, it was the in-front-of the curtain musical numbers (the program calls them "olios") that were the biggest audience pleasers. Little Laurie Bain stopped the show with the John Rosmond Johnson number "Under the BambooTree" ("If you lak-a­me lak I lak-a you"). And, let's not forget Miss Susan Stevens, a Julie Andrews look alike, who drew cheers for her pompous yet innocent "There are Faries in the Bottom of My Garden." 
But, a fine cast and some snappy direction by Charles Ballinger was not enough to turn a one joke farce into a two hour entertainment. 
If the SMC-ND Theater wants to do a spoof perhaps "Little Mary Sunshine" or "The Boy Friend" might be more appealing. Or, how about reviving the prolog from "Jennie"-starring Katherine Burke, of course. 
conscious attempts at burlesque." It has been rumored that if "Uncle Tom's Cabin" helped abolish slavery then "Ten Nights" may have brought on prohibition. The version presented by the SMC-MD Theater is a 1970 musical adaption by Fred Carmichael sprinkled with a moderate collection of tum-of­the-century songs. To the best of my knowledge this version has never been performed on or off 
Broadway but it  seems  to  be  a  
favorite  Summer  and  Dinner  
Theater presentation.  

Basically, the plot twists and turns around the effects of Demon Rum on the citizens of Cedarville. Among the victims of the soul poisoning beverage is Joe Mor~an. Neglectin~ his "Heartbroken Wife and Angt!l Chile." 
Morgan spends most of his time as one of several resident drunkards in the sleazy at­mosphere of the local Sickle and Sheaf Saloon. When daughter Mary urges her father to return home <"Father, Dear Father, 0 Father, Come Home') she is struck with a wayward beer mug. The poor dear dies (of course) and seeing the sinful brew as the cause of his family's destruction, pappa reforms. Woven into the plot are many of 
the stock characters expected in any of your basic melodramas. There are Sample Switchel and
