Improving communication between student government and the student body was the focus of the Notre Dame Stu­dent Body Presidential Debates Wednesday night. 
During the opening state­ments, the Rask-Smith ticket presented a platform which proposed a "consistent" housing policy, guaranteed stu­dent housing, implementation of an off-campus crime policy, expansion of cultural diversity and increased faculty-student interaction. 
The Fahey!Benedictus ticket's platform centered on the idea of monarchy. As Fahey said, "I am not running for president. I am running for king." Co-residential housing, a student union, discussion of sexual issues such as AIDS and birth control and softer toliet paper in the rest rooms were some of the issues emphasized by the ticket. 
The McTamaney;Russell ticket proposed plans for in­stalling phones in the parking lots, working for a computer­ized bulletin board to inform students of campus events and better defining the role student government. 
The BreslinKinkopf ticket suggested installing telephones in all campus buildings, estab­lishing a legal department for students and having hot sand­wiches in the dining hall. 
The issue of off-campus crime and improving relations with the South Bend commu­nity was also addressed by all four tickets. The Fahey!Benedictus ticket said that landlords should be forced to install burglar alarms in off-

WASHINGTON-The former House intelligence committee chairman testified Wednesday at Oliver North's trial that his first inquiries about reports of 
U.S. military help to the Nicaragua Contras met with repeated official denials. 
Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., the first prosecution witness, said he got denials in two let­ters from then-National Secur­ity Adviser Robert McFarlane and at a committee briefing before he finally asked for a meeting with North, then an aide on the National Security Council staff. 
The inquiries were first made in August 1985 following news reports that North was helping raise money for the Contras and giving the rebels tactical military advice despite prohibitions on U.S. aid first enacted by Congress in the so­called Boland Amendment of 1984. 
"Colonel North insisted he had not violated the Boland Amendment, that he was not assisting the Contras by raising money, that he had not pro­vided any military advice to the Contras," Hamilton said. 
Hamilton said he asked McFarlane about the media reports.

Personal appearances, door­to-door campaigning, poster placement and flyer distribu­tion are methods the student body presidential and vice­presidential candidates are using to win votes in this year's student government elections. 
Each of the four tickets run­ning, Matt Breslin and Dave Kinkopf, Bob McTamaney and Pat Russell, Tom Rask and Melissa Smith and Dan Fahey (the "monarch" candidate) say they are also currently in the process of making personal appearances in each dorm and introducing themselves to as many students as possible. "We're doing that (going dorm­to-dorm) so we can have stu­dents recognize the face that goes with the name and give them a brief summary of why we feel we are the best candi­
"When McFarlane told me they were not engaged in raising funds for the Contras and that the National Security Council was not providing mil­itary advice. . . I took Mr. McFarlane's word for it. I relied upon what the national security adviser for the presi­dent told me," he said. 
For that reason, said Hamil­ton, he did not pose questions about the Contras to the CIA or the Defense Department. 
Prosecutors are trying to show that North, then a Marine lieutenant colonel serving on the NSC staff, subverted the processes of government by helping McFarlane draft false dates," according to presiden­tial candidate Rask. 
Presidential candidate McTamaney said, "We don't want (door-to-door campaign­ing) to be a nuisance; we're not going to wake anyone up or call­them on the phone. We just want a realistic sample of what people on campus are think­ing." 
The methods each candidate employs to gain votes must fit into a framework of rules pro­vided by the Ombudsman Elec­tion Committee. Campaigning officially began at 12 a.m. on February 20 and is scheduled to end by midnight on February 26 giving the candidates one full week to introduce their platforms to the student body. 
All of the candidates said they are using posters to publicize their ideas. 
Ombudsman set a $125 cam­paign limit for all tickets as well. The candidates said they answers to letters from Congress inquiring about the news reports. 
North is charged, among other things, with obstructing congressional inquiries into his activities in 1985 and 1986. McFarlane, who is expected to testify as a prosecution wit­ness, has pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts of with­holding information from Congress. 
Before the jury was admitted to the courtroom, Hamilton was cautioned not to refer in any way to the public testimony North gave in 1987 at a televised hearing of the House­Senate committees . 
have paid for their tickets out of their own funds and that no donations have been made. 
Candidates have also had the opportunity to publicize their campaign issues through inter­views with "Scholastic" Mag­azine and a talk show on campus radio station WVFI Tuesday night. All three presidential candidates were featured on a WVFI program where they answered questions posed by call-in listners. In the Wednesday night debate, the candidates also presented their ideas to the student body. 
The election will be held February 27. "Most of all, we wartt to encourage the students to vote because, by voting, they voice their concerns on the problems facing the student body, and they are trusting that candidate to represent these concerns to the administra­tion," said vice-presidential candidate Smith.

Saint Mary's students chose to "steer in the right direction" and "ride with experience" when they elected the 
. Catenacci ticket in the student body elections Wednesday. The Saint Mary's student body government for 1989-90 consists of Lisa Catenacci, stu­dent body president; Deirdre Milon, vice president for aca­demic affairs; and Mary Beth Blajda, vice president for stu­dent affairs. Catenacci's ticket defeated the McGowan ticket of Shannon McGowan for student body president; Debbie Neiman for vice president for academic af­fairs; and Kathy Sullivan for vice president for student af­fairs by a 15 percent margin. The Catenacci ticket carried 57 percent of the votes, while the McGowan ticket had 42 per­cent. "It was a close race, just like we knew it would be," Catenacci said. "My ticket and I felt McGowan was extremely qualified and the students would have had a good presi­dent no matter how the results turned out." Catenacci did add, "We're ecstatic over our victory." Michelle Agostino, elections commissioner, reported that there was a 45 percent voter turnout. "The only disappointing fac­tor was the bad turnout on the part of the student body," McGowan said. "I just don't feel that there was an adequate reflection of the school." In response to their defeat, McGowan said, "I'm sure they will do a fine job, and I hope to work with them in some capacity next year." 
In the senior class elections, neither of the tickets received the majority of vote, so the 
president; Amy Blong for sec­retary and Laurel Vitale for treasurer, with 38 percent of the vote, will compete in a run­off election with Tara Melichar for president, Carol Berkowski for vice president, Kristin Dietzler for secretary and Jane Schnell for treasurer, carrying 32 percent of the vote. The run-off election will be held during all meals in SAGA on February 24.

INSIDE COLUMN 


ND T -shirts should be sold by students 
After watching the Irish win the Fiesta Bowl over Winter Break, I prepared myself for the inevitable: National Championship T-shirts. 
I expected students to be selling every possi­ble kind of Notre Dame National Champs T­shirt when I got back from break. Strangely enough, only one person actually came to my door selling his wares. Finally, in the February 9 issue of The Observer, I read an article that partially explained the scarcity of student de­signed T-shirts. According to the story, the Uni­versity brought legal action against Umbrella Graphics, a Mishawaka retail store, for produc­ing unlicensed products bearing the Notre Dame trademark. 
Technically, the University has the law on its side, but what it really boils down to is the big fish eating the little fish. How in the world can a small firm in Mishawaka, Indiana stand up to the University of Notre Dame? By halting the production of items bearing the Notre Darp.e logo, the business probably will go under, unless they can come up with another T -shirt they could market, and I'm afraid "South Bend­Mishawaka: Alive With Pride" T-shirts wouldn't sell as fast as a Fighting Irish T-shirts. 
I suppose that the University is coming down on the retail store as a matter of principle, be­cause I doubt that the administration would be concerned about losing money. Somehow I don't see this school as hurting financially. With all the money it makes from our tuition, alumni contributions and football weekends, some little company in Mishawaka is hardly going to make a dent in their incoming revenue. 
By stopping this firm from producing Notre Dame T-shirts, there's only one place left for students to buy their National Championship T-shirts: the bookstore. This doesn't appeal to me for one simple reason: bookstore T -shirts are boring. I just don't buy T-shirts at the bookstore because I haven't found any designs that are as creative as the ones offered by the students at this school. 
According to the article of February 9, any products licensed to use the ND trademark would be regulated by the University. So even if Umbrella Graphics licensed their products, University censuring would reduce the originality of the student designs to the drab T-shirts offered by the bookstore. I don't think I'm the only one who finds student-made T­shirts more interesting than the University­approved clothing. Around the time of the in­famous Miami game, Sports Illustrated ran a

story about all of the hype surrounding the game. Receiving honorable mention were the numerous types (I believe 15 in all) of "Hate Miami" T-shirts circulating around campus. "Hate Miami" T-shirts made the pages of Sports Illustrated, "Notre Dame Football -100' Years of Tradition" T -shirts did not. 
Still, I don't think the bookstore has much to worry about. The way this campus is set up, the bookstore virtually has a monopoly on Notre Dame memorabilia (where else can you go to get Notre Dame golf tees and a desk set?) Every football weekend, thousands of alums bombard the bookstore to buy their conven­tional, conservative, Notre Dame apparel. And of course, students will continue to empty their bank accounts each semester to pay exorbitant fees on their textbooks. 
Umbrella Graphics isn't hurting the bookstore or the University as a whole. This University has enough money and power to run a small company into the ground, and I think the administration could spend its time and money doing something more productive than bullying local businessmen and busines­swomen. In other words, lay off.

Lawmakers critique S&L bailout bill Bush proposes 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-In their rush to catch up to thrift industry fraud and mismanagement, federal regulators may have unknowingly hired some of the culprits responsible for the savings and loan debacle, The Associated Press has learned. 
The Federal Home Loan Bank Board hired as many as 800 people-a "high percentage" of them from failed S&Ls-without perform­ing background checks, gov­ernment and industry officials said. 
Two of them are now targets of criminal investigations. One is being prosecuted for alleged fraud committed last year at the Federal Savings & Loan In­surance Corp., the agency that insures thrift deposits. 
The other has been ·trans­ferred from a top regulatory job while the FBI pursues a probe requested two years ago when his old S&L went under. 
CATHOLIC FAITH SERIES 
CATHOLICISM: COMMUNITY AND SACRAMENT 
Catholicism is an especially rich tradition within Christianity. It maintains that the Christian vision can and should embrace all times, places and cultures and all aspects of the human person. Catholicism is a form of Christian humanism. 
FR. MICHAEL J. HIMES is Associate Professor of Theology at Notre Dame. He was awarded with distinction a Ph.D. in the History of Christianity from the University of Chicago. He has served as Dean of Immaculate Conception Seminary, Huntington, N.Y. Most recently, at the invitation of the World Council on Religion and Peace, he delivered the address in honor of the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the United Nations. Sunday, February 26 and Tuesday, February 28, Keenan Chapel 7-8:30 p.m. 

Regulatory officials in Wash­ington did not know about that inquiry, which had been launched in Dallas, when he was hired last year. 
The bank board made 6,000 such criminal referrals to the FBI from insolvent thrifts, as­king the bureau to look into spe­cific transactions and individ­uals. 
When employees of failed thrifts are hired as regulators, "that's a risk, sure," acknowl­edged bank board spokesman Bill Fulwider. 
Still, he added, "The assump­tion is it's generally not their fault the institution went down. They understand the assets, and they have expertise that's valuable." 
Most of the people hired to handle the billions of dollars' worth of property and loans seized from failed thrifts are honest, officials said. Yet they expect to find more bad apples. 
"I would not be surprised to see one or two instances of that emerging as the (Justice De­partment's bank fraud) task force proceeds," said U.S. At­torney Marvin Collins, who has been working on S&L fraud since the mid-1980s. 
Added one longtime industry official, who spoke on the con­dition of anonymity, "I would imagine there would be one or two others when you hire 800 people. Maybe 80 or 50 or 30 people-some percentage that drops over the line .... It will take a long time before it all gets out." 
The collapse of the S&L in­dustry is expected to cost some $100 billion to resolve. A large portion of that cost, officials have said, results from mis­management and outright fraud by S&L executives. 
Some criminal activity is still going on, Collins said."Some people feel they can take ad­vantage because the system is currently overloaded by inves­tigations," he said. "We'll be very attentive to them."

Court: State not responsible for protecting abused child 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The Su­preme Court, ruling against a child who suffered brain damage from repeated beatings by his father, said Wednesday states generally may not be sued even if they negligently fail to shield people from abuse by others. 
The 6-3 decision said public officials have no constitutional duty to protect those who are not in state custody. The court said there is no legal recourse even in the "undeniably tragic" case where officials were aware of the beatings but did not intervene. 
The court killed a lawsuit in behalf of Joshua DeShaney, a Wisconsin boy who since age 4 has been profoundly retarded and is expected to remain in­
stitutionalized for the rest of his 
life. 
Child welfare officials and the state were sued by Joshua's mother, Melody DeShaney, on grounds the boy was deprived of liberty without due process. 
But Chief Justice William Rehnquist, writing for the court, said, "Nothing in the lan­guage of the due process clause itself requires the state to protect the life, liberty and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors." 
"Because... the state had no constitutional duty to protect Joshua against his father's vio­lence, its failure to do so­though calamitous in hindsight-simply does not con­stitute a violation of the due process clause," he said. 
In an unusual emotional dis­sent, Justice Harry Blackmun said, "Poor Joshua! It is a sad commentary upon American life and constitutional prin­ciples... that this child, Joshua DeShaney, now is assigned to live out the remainder of his life profoundly retarded and without an opportunity to sue the state." 

Blackmun accused the court of "sterile formalism" for failing to grant Joshua and his mother an opportunty to seek damages from the state. 
Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall also dissented. 
Rehnquist rejected argu­ments that the state had a duty to protect Joshua because it once had given him shelter and because social workers suspected he was being abused. 
Duke takes Louisiana House seat 
Associated Press 
BATON ROUGE, La.-David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, overcame two last-minute challenges and was sworn into the Louisiana Legislature on Wednesday as black lawmakers vowed to keep an eye on him. 
Duke took the oath of office after surviving a lawsuit and an attempt by a lawmaker to deny him his House seat in a dispute over whether Duke was a legal resident of his suburban New Orleans district, which is 
99.6 percent white. 
"I want to allay fears that I will be divisive or a problem in this great body," Duke told his new colleagues. "I truly believe when we took the pledge of allegiance this mor­ning and we said 'Justice for all,' I believe in that for America. 
"And I believe that discrim­ination is wrong and reprehen­sible when it is waged against anyone, black or white, in this country." 
Duke, 38, smiled broadly and waved before Speaker Jim Dimos, who administered the oath, which followed an at­tempt by Rep. Odon Bacque to have the House investigate whether Duke lived in the Metairie district a year as re­quired by law. Opponents have said Duke lives a couple of blocks outside the district.

Rutgers professor proposes idea for ND recycling project 

By KATHLEEN CROOKS News Staff 
The possible cash benefits of recycling was the topic of a lec­ture Wednesday afternoon by Professor Ray Ching of Rut­gers University. 
Ching said the Rutgers recy­cling program has made a good deal of money for the Univer­sity. "Notre Dame has literally got a gold mine in its trash bins," Ching said. 
Ching gave information on how to set up a recycling pro­gram and how to divide up recyclable items. He also gave a summary of the monetary benefits of recycling. 
Ching said the Rutgers pro­gram was started after manda­tory recycling laws were estab­lished in New Jersey. The program calls for recycling of newspaper, aluminum, glass and excess food from the uni­versity dining halls. The waste is sold to various companies who, in return, provide the col­lege with monetary and envi­ronmental benefits, Ching said. 
In implementing a program, Ching said it is important to make the recycling bins con­venient and "user-friendly." "We can't force people to com­ply; we must rely on people's concern for the environment and peer pressure...factors like that." Ching said. 
Ching also said that, in order to have a successful program, it is important to publicize it. "People can't respond to what they don't know about," Ching said. 
Sophomore Lisa Mackett, head of the Environmental Ac­tion Team at Notre Dame, said Professor Ching's lecture was the first step the University is taking in a possible effort to in­stitute a campus-wide recy­cling of cans, bottles, newspa­per and cardboard. 
Mackett said in her research of recycling projects, she looked for a program that would best fit the needs of the Notre Dame community. She found the Rutgers program to be "unbelievably efficient," and so she contacted Professor Ching. 
Mackett became interested in environmental issues after working on a class paper. She began doing more research on the subject and eventually formed the Environmental Ac­tion Team. 
Mackett said that the pro­gram has gotten a good response so far. "It is only going to work if students whole­heartedly support it. The goal is not to set up a 2 to 3 year program, but to make this an ongoing process," Mackett said. 
Mackett cited environmental concerns and monetary costs as reasons for implementing the program. "St. Joseph County has only one landfill left, and that will be full in 2 years, then what are we going to do?" said Mackett.

Bush travels to Japan for first presidential trip 
Associated Press 
ANCHORAGE, Alaska-President Bush today launched a five-day mission to the Far East, his first overseas trip as president. The White House said the journey might not generate quick headlines, but would demonstrate that "the United States is an Asian power." 
Bush will also make a weekend visit to China and a 4-hour stop in South Korea. 
Following the 7-hour flight from Washington, the presi­dent spoke to members of the armed forces at a airplane han­gar at Elmendorf Air Force Base. 
Although it is unusual for an American president to travel overseas just 33 days after his inauguration, Bush decided to travel to Tokyo to represent the United States on Friday at the state funeral of Emperor Hirohito, who died of cancer at the age of 87 on Jan. 7. 
In prepared remarks in Alaska, Bush noted that El­mendorf was the first stop 18 years ago in a trip that made Hirohito the first emperor in Ja­panese history to set foot out­side his homeland. 
Bush said he would pay his respects in Tokyo, and added, 
"It is as well a measure of our 
respect for a valued ally and 
fellow democracy that I make 
this trip." 
"At each stop," Bush said, "I aim to strengthen key relationships with ourJriends and partners in the Pacific region." 
Meanwhile, however, the White House released a state­ment by Bush suggesting he was not interested in a U.S.­Japanese free trade agreement modeled after a U.S.-Canadian pact to eliminate all trade fees and import barriers. 
Bush said that Tokyo and Washington agree on the need for mulilateral and bilateral ef­forts to create a more open in­ternational trading system. 
'We will stress the multi­lateral approach," Bush said. "We are always open to new ideas, but in our view the key now is to work hard for the suc­ceess" of international trade talks known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
His comment was made in a written response to questions submitted by the Kyodo news service. Typically, the responses are written by the National Security Council staff.

P.O. Box Q
Observer endorses Breslin, Kinkopf 
The Observer endorses the ticket of Matt Breslin for student body president and Dave Kinkopf for student body vice president. 
Breslin and Kinkopf's considerable experience and leadership in the student government structure set their ticket apart from the other three tickets. Breslin currently serves as junior class president, while Kinkopf served as sophomore class president and freshman advisory council president. 
Experience is not always the most important determinant for positions in any organization. Breslin and Kinkopf, however, seem to be the most likely to continue the current student gov­ernment's dramatic improvements in visibility, efficiency and intellectual concerns. 
The Breslin ticket also shows the most complete knowledge of student government bureaucracy and the pragmaticism to meet student concerns. 
In order to succeed, the leaders of student government will have to persuade the admini~tration to see the student side of key issues on and off-campus. Breslin and Kinkopf's confidence, communication skills and previous experience with Board of Trustees' reports will serve them well in this area. 
Finally, Breslin's idea of forming a legal department within student government is the most innovative in dealing with stu­dent concerns off-campus. Student government must begin work immediately to improve off-campus relations with South Bend residents and police. 
Much of the success of student government rests on the in­volvement of all students. Please vote on Monday and cast your vote for the Breslin-Kinkopf ticket.

Basketball craze hits campus 
Dear Editor: 
It has been brought to the attention of the Bookstore Basketball Committee that there are people at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, whether they are stu­dents, faculty or staff, that are not going to play in-this year's tournament. We couldn't think of any reasons why someone would not want to participate in the largest basketball tournament in the world. So, we came up with the fol­lowing top ten reasons why everyone should play in Bookstore Basketball this year. 
10. It's more fun than make-your­own-burrito bar. 
9. Elvis is playing this year. 
8. You can get your team name cen­sored. 
7. Better chance of scoring at any SYR. 
6. No minimum SAT requirement. 
5. No experience necessary. 
4. No drug testing. 
3. You might play against football players-Oh, what a thrill! 
2. We don't censor profanity in the "Hey" cheer. 
1. You can do it in all kinds of wea­ther. 
On a more serious note, we hope that all of you will come out and play Bookstore Basketball this year. Last year's tournament consisted of 666 teams, and we would like to increase this year's pool to over 700 teams. All the games are played after 4 p.m. on weekdays, so there are very few scheduling conflicts. Also, we are en­couraging more faculty to play so that there will be more interaction outside of the classroom. Women are allowed to play in both men's and women's Bookstore Basketball, and all Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students, fac­ulty, and staff are encouraged to par­ticipate in this, the 18th year of the tournament. 
A few things are different than last year: 
Only one football player will be al­lowed to play on the same team as a present or past NCAA basketball player. 
A team may consist of more than five players: only five of those players may play in any one game, and NO ONE is allowed to play for more than one team in the tournament, or both the player and second team are disqualified. 
There will be increased emphasis on controlling unsportsmanlike conduct of any sort. 
Sign-ups are this Sunday, Feb. 26 in the Great Hall in O'Shaughnessy from 1-4 p.m. In addition, sign-ups are at Saint Mary's from 6-8 p.m. in the game room in Haggar the following Monday, Feb. 27. If you don't have a full team, remember a captain can sign up and fill in the gaps later. 
Faculty and staff may sign up in the Student Activities office in Lafortune between now and Tuesday. 
Hope to see you on the courts.

Loss of shakes hard to take 
Dear Editor: 
Someone once said it's the little things that make life enjoyable. In my 37 years I have found that to be true more often than not. 
Shortly after arriving here I dis­covered one of the mentioned 'little things' about Notre Dame--milkshakes at the Pro Shop in the Rockne Memorial. I have been fortunate enough to sample milkshakes on four continents and a few islands and I can say with all honesty, those dairy delights at the Pro Shop were delicious. 
Imagine my chagrin, shock, surprise, and even dismay when I learned the Pro Shop would no longer offer milkshakes. If this is progress, bring back the days of the horse and buggy. I know of a number of people who, like me, are upset at this latest attack on our standard of living. Please give us a fair shake and bring back the milkshakes to the Pro Shop.

ND track hosts premier field at Meyo's Alex Wilson Invite 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO Sports Writer 
Saturday will mark the last home meet of the season for the Irish as Notre Dame plays host to the Alex Wilson Invitational at the Meyo Track in the Loftus Sports Center. 
For some of those competing, it is a meet with "national im­plications." 
This meet will be the last chance for some atheletes to qualify for the NCAA Indoor Track Championships, sched­uled for March 10-11. 
Included in this group are junior Mike Rogan, freshman Brian Peppard, sophomore Mark Lavery and senior David Warth, who comprise the two­mile relay squad. 
When this powerful middle distance relay team steps onto the Meyo Track, it will be its last chance to qualify for the Indoor NCAA Championships, the feat the team has been working for all season. 
"Basically this is it," said Rogan. "This is what we've been pointing at all season long." 
Head Coach Joe Piane pur­posefully invited some of the best two-mile relay teams in the nation to attend, and he got just that. 
Georgetown, Villanova, Penn State, and Loyola (Ill.) have all indicated that they will be attending the meet, and all these schools have excellent two-mile relay squads. All of these teams have the ability to qualify for the NCAA's, Notre Dame included. 
"This race has the potential to have a team come in fifth place and still qualify for the 
Mike Rogan
' 

NCAA's," said Piane. "This is the premier event. I don't think there's any event as deep." 
Another note regarding this meet is that senior All­American Dan Garrett will be running his first meet of the season in the 3,000 meters. Gar­rett lhad been bothered with tendonitis throughout the season. 
"We're going to try to get Danny to qmilify for the IC4A's," said Piane. "In fact, I'm putting (senior co-captain Ron) Markezich in there for the first mile just to make sure Garrett stays on his tail.'' 
"Basically this meet is going to give us the opportunity to get some qualifiers for the national championships and IC4A's," said Piane. "For some kids it will be a tuning up meet.'' 
This relay event is not the only one with national compe­tition on the line. Freshman Raghib Ismail, for example, is just .03 seconds away from qualifying for the NCAA's in the 55-meter dash. 
Ismail, however, will have another chance at qualifying next week when he runs the same event at the IC4A Cham­pionships (Intercollegiate As­sociation of Amateur Atheletes of America) in Princeton, NJ, so he is not feeling any addi­tional pressure. 
"It's hard for me to say how I'm going to do," said Ismail. "I'm just going to do my best. If I make it, that's great, but if I don't, you know, there'll be other times."

Trip east next for women's swim team 
By MARY GARINO Sports Writer 
Coming off a decisive victory at the Midwestern Collegiate Conference Championships, the women's swim team heads for West Virginia to compete in their first Eastern Intercol­legiate Championships. 
This is the second year that the meet has existed for wo­men. It was created to parallel the men's meet as a way of recognizing the growing impor­tance of women's swimming. The meet is also designed as a season-ending preview of the NCAAs. 
"The meet creates a cham­pionship that encourages elite swimmers to qualify for the NCAAs," said Irish head coach Tim Welsh. "It's a full team 
championship  also,  which  
means  we  can bring  a  full

Because this is Notre Dame's first year in attendance, Coach Welsh does not have any goals as far as the scoreboard is con­cerned. The team will mainly directed," Welsh said. "We want to finish the the season with everybody swimming their best, and also reset as many university records and individual records as possi­ble."

The Irish will be facing some powerful teams, including three teams that already faced Notre Dame earlier in the year, St. Bonaventure, Cleveland State and Villanova. Among the rest of the ten teams will be West Virginia, the host school, who would love to beat Notre Dame and avenge the Mountaineers Fiesta Bowl loss to the Irish. 
Coach Welsh was quick to point out that even thought the Irish are not planning any strategy to beat these teams, the meet will be very intense. 
"These championship meets outweigh the dual meet season," he said. "Just because we don't have any external

The training in the earlier part of the season was targeted at the the three championship meets at the end of the year, the MCCs, the Eastern Inter­collegiates and the NCAAs. The Irish also have the added ad­vantage of confidence from their success last week. 
The Irish have another rea­son for wanting to do well be­sides resetting records. The better the team does, the better it looks for perspective stu­dents. One way recruits evalu­ate the program is by the per-

The women's Eastern Inter­collegiates will take place Thursday, Friday and Satur­day. The men's meet will be during the first week in March. 
According to Adams, Boggs said Rice "thinks he's white." 
Asked to comment on the story, Rice said, "I have not read it and I am not going to read it " 
Adams, who is receiving at least $100,000 for the story, also graphically describes the sex lives of Boggs and several teammates she does not iden­tify.
Adams also detailed a num­ber of Boggs' superstitions. She claimed she took 64 road trips with Boggs, purchased his clothes and avoided sex with him during the day because "Wade believes that sex weakens your legs, and he needs strong legs to play third base."

ND baseball travels south for a sunny season opener 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Assistant Sports Editor 
An 18-game season-opening road trip for the Notre Dame baseball team, which will in­clude stops in Florida and North Carolina, begins today with a tour of Texas. 
The Irish begins its season today in San Antonio with a 4 
p.m. game against Trinity. Notre Dame then heads to Aus­tin to face third-ranked Texas Friday at 3 p.m., and returns to San Antonio for a matchup with St. Mary's Saturday night at 7:30. 
Notre Dame is just fortunate to see an outdoor baseball field at this point. The Irish had been conducting their pre-season practices at the indoor Loftus Center. 
"Loftus is an incredible facility, but it's still difficult to simulate a game situation in­side," said second-year Irish coach Pat Murphy. "We need to get outside and play some games." 
Trinity is a young team com­ing off a disappointing 5-31 campaign last year. The NAIA school dropped its first four games this year with losses to state rivals Texas Lutheran, St. Mary's and Howard Payne. 
LeftfieldeDJ>itcher Tommy Anderson leads Trinity in hit­ting with a .308 average. Centerfielder;pitcher Robert Burns, the only senior on the team, is batting .289 with 12 runs batted in and 56 total bases. 
''Trinity was noted for its baseball 10 years ago," said Murphy. "They're rebuilding their program now. 
"Coming in (to Texas) 9:30 at night and playing the next day will be tough, especially since we haven't been on the field yet." 
Texas will provide Notre Dame with an extremely diffi­cullt early-season challenge. The Longhorns sport an 8-3 record that includes a three­game sweep of UCLA. 
In other games this season, Texas has won two of three games from Arizona State, swept a doubleheader from St. Mary's and split doubleheaders with Texas Lu­theran and Texas-Arlington. 
"I can't spend too much time thinking about the opposition, but I hear they're something special," said Murphy. "You're talking about the ul­timate road game, being in Austin. There will be about 9,875 Texas fans there and 125 Notre Dame fans." 
Despite the Longhorns' high his team's recent play. A loss to Texas-Arlington Tuesday particularly upset him. 
"It was a curious game in that we had 16 baserunners and failed to score a run," said the veteran Longhorn coach. "That's been our plight; we haven't hit well with men on base." 
Righthanded pitcher Jeff Seale figures to start for Texas Saturday in his collegiate debut. The freshman turned down an offer from the New York Mets, who drafted him in the second round last spring, to attend Texas. 
"He's an outstanding prospect," said Gustafson. "He's not a polished player at this time, but he has pretty good stuff." 
Seale missed the first several games of the season after being suspended for disciplinary reasons. 
After playing Notre Dame, Texas hosts second-ranked Miami in a three-game series from Saturday to Monday. The Sunday and Monday games will be televised nationally by ESPN. 
St. Mary's, another NAIA program, currently holds a 3-6 record in a season that has in­cluded six games against

Off Campus beats Grace, ~tanford earns p1ayoff berth 
By KEN TYSIAC Sports Writer 
The final games of the Inter­hall Hockey regular season provided an interesting glimpse of what the playoffs might be like. In the Blue Divi­sion, top guns Alumni and Stan­ford skated to a 2-2 tie which clinched playoff berths for both teams. 
Meanwhile a 5-3 Off Campus victory over Grace in the battle for first place in the Gold Divi­sion assured the Crime of a playoff spot. Assuming Dillon beats Flanner later this week, Grace will be forced to battle the Big Red for the fourth and final playoff spot early next week. 
Off Campus took an early 2-1 lead in their game against Grace on a pair of goals by Tom Keating. However, Grace player/coach Erik Galis managed to tie it before halftime with his second goal of the night on a slapshot from just outside the blue line. 
Joe Levan scored on a two­on-one break early in the second half to give Grace a 3-2 lead, but John Kirk and Craig Carufel countered to give Off Campus the lead for good with goals 45 seconds apart. O.C. goalie John Krutzer then slammed the door on Grace, and Keating rounded out the scoring by completing his hat trick with an empty net goal with one second left. 
O.C. coach Chris O'Grady is confident about his team's chances in the playoffs. 
"We have the best players in the league. If we just play our game and get some breaks we should be tough to beat in the playoffs." 
"We didn't play well tonight," said Galis. "We got hurt by two flukey goals at the end. We'll have to just take it one game at a time now, but it's tough for us to play with less than two lines." 
The other big story was Stan­ford's first Interhall Hockey playoff berth ever. Twice the Studs rallied from one goal deficits against Alumni, and soon after Bob Kuskie tied it at two goals apiece with 4 minutes left, Stanford went on the power play. 
Alumni managed to hold Stanford scoreless when they had the man advantage, however, and goalie Hardie Tankersley had to make a big glove save in a goalmouth scramble to preserve the tie . 
Report: Rose replacing Sutton at Kentucky 
Associated Press 
COLUMBUS, Ohio-­Kentucky coach Eddie Sut­ton will leave the Wildcats "in 10 days to two weeks" and will be replaced by former Purdue head coach Lee Rose, according to a source quoted in a published report. 
The Columbus Dispatch, in its Thursday editions, quoted a source close to the Kentucky program as saying "Sutton is going to be told he's gone in 10 days to two weeks. The new coach is picked and it's Rose. He's (C.M.) Newton's choice for the job." 
The Dispatch said its source had spoken on the condition of anonymity. 
Newton will become ath­letic director at Kentucky on April 1, replacing Cliff Hagan, who resigned last year. Newton refused to dis­cuss the Kentucky coaching situation with The Dispatch. 
"I'm not AD there until April1," Newton said. 
Rose, contacted by The Dispatch before Wednes­day's New Jersey Nets­Cleveland Cavaliers NBA game, was asked if he would be a candidate if the Ken­tucky job opened. Rose has been an assistant coach with the Nets since last summer. 
"Until there is a position open, no one is a candidate because the job is still in the hands of the man who has it," Rose said. "My mother lives in Lexington and I have a lot of ties there. And that's no secret."

RALEIGH--' 'Personal Fouls," a book about the North Carolina State basketball pro­gram under Coach Jim Val­vano, will not be printed by Simon & Schuster because the book didn't meet its standards, the publisher said Wednesday. 
Excerpts of the book, based on book jacket blurbs, were published in The News and Ob­server of Raleigh last month. According to the published story, the jacket listed allega­tions of improper gifts to players and grade changes. It also alleged that a player deliberately lost N.C. State's first-round game in the 1987 NCAA tournament to avoid de­tection for drug use. 
"I am very pleased with this decision and want to express my appreciation to Simon & Schuster for taking the time to conduct a careful and complete review of the manuscript," Valvano said in a written state­ment. "Now, I am hoping to turn my full attention and energies to the players of the North Carolina State basket­ball team and to the people in­volved in the operation of our Department of Athletics."

He has steadfastly denied the allegations made in the blurbs. 
Pocket Books, a division of Simon & Schuster, said the decision not to proceed with publication of "Personal Fouls" was made after a review of the manuscript with Peter Golenbock, the author. 
The publisher had been warned by the North Carolina attorney general to be sure of its facts. 
But Golenbock said in a tele­phone interview from his Con­necticut home that he would "stand by my work and I am confident that 'Personal Fouls' will be published."
