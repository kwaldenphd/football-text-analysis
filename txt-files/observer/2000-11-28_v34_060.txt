Saf eRide faces 
scrutiny, new system likely 
By KIFLIN TURNER 
News \XIrite, 
The fate of SafeRide has reached a crossroads, the ver­dict being that the student run service is ineffective, unorganized and is rarely if at all used by the student body. 
Jay Smith, Student Body Chief of Staff said the pro­gram is currently under the process of being revamped that will include re-naming based on the negative stigma placed on it because of its inefficiencies in the past 
"It's unreliable; it's inconsistent; and so we're looking towards creating the same type of service which will be reliable and consistent and something that will be able to happen for years to come," said Smith. "We have to figure out ways to publicize it and make it fashionable again and that's one of the reasons we're looking into renaming." 
Past problems have been attributed to low worker turnouts as well as low student body participation. 
"The first time when I used it sometimes it took a long time, and I think that's maybe why students didn't use it. Honestly I forgot about it because I haven't seen anyone use it all year," said senior Nichole Meyer. "I think that the general perception was still that it was somewhat of a hassle." 
In the meantime, while the service is undergoing reconstruction, the concern over whether more students will choose to drive or walk home drunk could possibly become a pressing issue, however many students will go unaffected by its absence.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Pains, Strains, and automobiles 
It is six o'clock in the evening and I am standing on the corner of Michigan Avenue, downtown Chicago, waiting in the cold and rain that feels like ice. 
Yes. waiting for the No. 145 bus that is 15 minutes late. In the time my friend and I have been Myra McGrlff waiting. five No. 151 buses have gone by. 
We don't take that bus 
because it goes to the zoo. News Writer 
The question I ask is who 
is going to the zoo in 20­
degree weather and why 
do they need five buses for it? 
But I continue to wait calmly and pretend that the wind chill is no big deal and all the people surrounding me like leeches is a pleasant feeling. I watched people armed with shopping bags, umbrellas and bad atti­tudes steal each others taxi cabs never utter­ing the words ·excuse me'. 
I never knew Chicago natives were so rude. I mean, I was standing almost in the gutter next to a planter, with passing cars splashing me with muck and all the while I have this rather large man trying to squeeze between the planter and me. 
With what seems like acres of room sur­rounding me this man chooses the tightest place to squeeze through and then gives me a crazy look when I refuse to step in the gutter to permit him to pass. 
After being knocked about, ogled by people with missing teeth and standing in the freez­ing rain, [ wanted to tell this man where to go. But no, with winter cheer I smiled and let him pass, just to be splashed by a passing cab. 
Oh yes, the bus came 10 minutes later and we all pushed and shoved ourselves on like cattle only to be greeted by limited seating. 
Like some survival of the fittest experiment people knocked down old women just to get the most coveted seat on the bus. I did not have to go to such extremes, but by this time I was prepared to do battle for a seat. 

I didn't dare close my eyes, so I was alert to the bizarre conversation going on between two people standing beside me. But to top it off something was dripping on me from some where, and all I wanted to do was scream. 
I managed to get back to my friend's house in one piece but definitely traumatized, bruised, and drained. The lesson being, don't go downtown unless you are wearing your combat boots and ready for hand to hand bat­tle.

OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY 
Security to post sex offenders 
OKLAHOMA CITY 
The Oklahoma State University Police Department (OSUPD) will post, on its Web site, the names and pho­tos of all registered sex offenders enrolled or employed on campus if a proposed federal bill is enacted, said OSUPD Support Services Lt. Richard Atkins. The Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act, which passed the 
U.S. Senate in October and which President Clinton said he will sign, would require states' Department of Corrections to keep a record of registered sex offend­ers who are employed by or attend a university, and then distribute that information to the campus and local police departments. "Once we have that informa­tion, we are going to have it on our Web site," Atkins said. "If someone does not have a computer, then they can come by here (the OSU police department)." Arizona Congressman Matt Salmon introduced the bill and said it would close a loophole in the 1996 Megan's Law, which requires states to notify community mem­bers about sex offenders living in their cities. 
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON 
Faculty claim sexual discrimination 
SEATTLE 

More than 1,000 University of Washington (UW) women professors could be a part of a discrimination lawsuit against the University, originally filed by five women professors in 1997. The suit claims that the University pays female professors less and gives them fewer promotions than their male counterparts. Originally filed by female professors in the dental and medical departments, it has now been expanded to include all UW women faculty employed since Aug. 18, 1994. The suit will include tenure and non-t enure female faculty at the UW's Seattle, Bothell and Tacoma campuses. According to the Seattle Post­Intelligencer, King County Superior Court Judge Glenna Hall ruled that the case could be expanded into a class-action suit. A trial date is set for January 2002. The Seattle P-1 reported that less than 25 per­cent of tenured faculty are women, while nearly 60 percent of the lower-paid, non-tenured faculty are women.

Gore 
continued from page l 
declare Gore the winner of' the electoral voles. 
Gore faulted Harris and election officials for fail­ing to acceµt partial recounts of' votes and, in one case, stopping the recounts. 
Gore's lawyers said in Lheir brief the refusal to hand count ballots and the certification of results that did not include uncounted ballots amount to "misconduct sufficient to change or place in doubt the result of the r.lection." 
In tho three-county con­test f1led by Gore, lawyers alleged that the vote totals reported to the secretary of' state Sunday were inac­curate. 
In Miami-Dade, Gore lawyers want a count of' the 10.000 votes they said could not be read by a voting machine and w·ere not hand-counted. 

In Nassau County, Democrats am seeking to add a recounted total that would give Gore 52 more votes. 
In that case, the county reverted to reporting its initial postelection total instead of a machine recount because some 200 ballots were inadvertently left out of the recount. 
Multiple problems were alleged in Palm Beach County where Harris refused to extend the 5 
p.m. Sunday deadline for hand counting and then rejected the partial count submiued. 
The brief said the final total, completed at 7:30 p.m.,. would have added 215 votes to the Democrat. 
Heyond that, the brief said some Palm Beach voters did not completely perforate their ballots. No allowance was made fur partially perforated or indented chads on the presidential votes unless similar dimples were seen in other races. 
In other legal 
developments: 
. 
Both sides agreed to move a lawsuit alleging Republican tampering with as many as 15,000 absentee ballots in Seminole County to the circuit court in Tallahassee because that's where the election was certified. The Gore team did noL make that complaint part of its own suit. 

. 
Still unresolved were state lawsuits filed by Bush on Sunday seeking to force Hillsborough, Okaloosa, Orange, Pasco and Polk counties to count a small number of reject­ed overseas absentee bal­lots. 

.The 
Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network filed a federal lawsuit in l\liami on behalf of three Miami residents. It says minority voters were dis­enfranchised because Bush was certified as the winner without a complet­ed Miami-Dade manual recount. 




SafeRide 
continued from page 1 
"I don't know of anything horrible that has happened because some­one walked homo or hitched a ride with someone else, but I think that it is something that could be helpful if it got up and going again" said Mever. 
'fhe recent car accidents outside of the Linebacker Lounge that have included hitting two Notre Dame students, alum Julia Gillespie, and senior Joe Steirer has raised atten­tion to the importance of SafeHide as a means of injury prevention. 
"Our fellow students are not always responsible and the absence of SafeRide may contribute to that 
but at the same time that type of behavior Axisted when SafeRide exjsted," said Smith. "To address the Linebacker situation specifically, historically rather. it is my belief that Safe Ride hardly ever went to the Linebacker because of the location, because of it being so close to cam­pus." 
Another concern is one that the Notre Dame administration may hold as well as other authori­behavior is a concern that will go into the restructuring of the pro­gram. 
"We don't want to condone stu­dent drinking and that's why we're trying to examine some of these dif­ferent routes and some of these dif­ferent places that the service might want tu go to in addition to the local establishments and off-campus housing," said Smith. 
However, members of the commu­nity see the service as potentially helpful to students who would oth­erwise make unwise decisions. 
"I think that it's a good safe mea sure. but I just wish kids wouldn't abuse themselves to the point of not being able to w;e good judgements," said Lewis Hall rector Sister Annette George. "The best of' all worlds would be if people would go off-campus and come home

HAITI 


Associated Press 

PORT-AU-PRINCE 
Following a presidential election boycotted by all of Haiti's major opposition parties, apparent winner Jean-Bertrand Aristide denied opposition claims that he would squelch democracy and said his opponents would be wel­come in his government. 
Appearing Monday at his first news conference since 1994, the former president did not explicitly declare victory, but he spoke as if he had been declared presi­dent. 
"There will be a place for everyone in my govern­ment," Aristide said. "To have a peaceful Haiti, the opposition is indispensable ... It is part of our democra­tic fate." 
Asked if he planned to become president for life, the former Catholic priest said: "It is not in my agen­da." 
Opposition parties that boycotted the presidential vote, meanwhile, claimed that Aristide has no man­date to govern because most Haitians did not vote. 
Opposition leader Herve Denis said the coalition of all major opposition parties that urged voters to shun the polls would create "a peaceful alternative" to the government of Aristide and his Lavalas Family party. 
Denis, a former ally of Aristide, refused to elabo­rate. But it seemed Haiti's floundering democracy could remain locked in a fight for power that has stymied development and foreign aid and left many Haitians as poor and hun­gry as ever. 
Speaking to a crowded room of journalists, Aristide described the election as a victory for democracy. 
"We observed a huge majority of the Haitian peo­ple yesterday expressing their right through their vote," he said. "I am ready to hear what the electoral council will give as a result." 
The electoral council dis­puted claims of a low turnout and said 60.5 per­cent of more than 4 million registered voters participat­ed. In some areas, they said, every registered voter participated. 
"They are hallucinating," Denis countered. "The elec­tion was illegitimate. Aristide does not have a mandate to govern. The people's abstention means they refuse to be governed by Lavalas."

Bombs explode in bus stop, crowded market 
Associated Press 

LAHORE 
Three bombs exploded iu eastern Punjab province Monday, killing a 4-year-old child and injuring at least 24 other people, police said. 
Two bombs went off within minutes of each other at a bus stop in the Badamibagh neigh­borhood of Lahore, the Punjab provincial capital. Fourteen people were hurt, they said. 
The third bomb ripped through a crowded market in Muridke. some 18 miles north­west of Lahore, killing one per­son and injuring 10 others. 
A 4-year-old boy lost both legs in the explosion and later died, doctors said. 
No one has claimed responsi­bility for the series of explosions. 
Police suspect the bombs in Lahore were hidden in luggage that had been abandoned. Fire and smoke billowod from burn­ing vehicles, witnesses said. 
"People were running and screaming. I don't know who knocked me down but someone ran into me. My legs were on fire," said Mohammed Ashraf. who. like many of the victims, suffered burn injuries. 
In Muridke, the bomb was apparently hidden beneath a horse-drawn cart in the middle of a bazaar selling secondhand clothing and household goods, said Jan Mohammed, 40. 

AP 

Mohammed. who suffered burns to his fac11 and legs, said he was knocked unconscious and awoke in a Lahore hospital. 'T don't remember anything after hearing a loud noise," he said. 
Muridke is also the headquar­ters of one of the larger Kashmiri militant groups. Lashkar-e-Tayyaba. 
Police said there was no immediate connection betwticn the explosion and the militant group, but an investigation was underway. 
There ·have been a series of bomb explosions in major cities throughout Pakistan in recent months, causing dozens of casu­alties. 
Pakistan routinely blames the explosions on uneasy neighbor India.

The phenomenon of the 'sleeping hero' seems to be a universal theme in folklore and mythology, Arthur in Britain, Charlemagne in France, Barbarossa in Germany being the best known reflexes of this ubiquitous myth. In this O'Donnell lecture Prof. Breandan O Buachallla studies the Irish evidence as reflected in Irish folklore and literature and locates the Irish versions of the myth in their historical context. 
Breandan 6 Buachalla is the leading expert in the literature and ideology of early modern Ireland. He has published widely on the impact of the Counter-Reformation on Irish political thought, on early modern historiography, on the cult of the Stuarts as reflected in Irish literature, and on Jacobite rhetoric and ideology. The University of Notre Dame and The Keough Institute for Irish Studies are delighted to have Breandan 6 Buachalla as this year's O'Donnell Chair for Irish Studies.

Ford issues 5th recall on Escape 
Associated P re,s 
DETROIT 

For the fifth time in a little over a year, Ford Motor Co. told its dealers either to pro­hibit sales or test-drives of its new Escape sport utility vehi­cles while they're checked for safety-related problems. 
The latest notice. tu dealers was sent Nov. 18, affecting 51,022 Escapes and about 24,000 Mazda Tributes, which share basic parts with the Escape and are built in the same plant in Claycomo. Mo. Of those, 27,516 Escapes and about 12.500 Tributes have already been sold. 
Ford spokesman Mike Vaughn said dealers were told to check for damaged wind­shield wiper link ball sockets and replace them il' necessary. Ir the sockets were improperly built, thP wipers could stop working. Parts to fix the prob­lflm "are in the pipeline" to dealers, Vaughn said. 
Previous warnings to deal­ers on the Escape and Tribute, both of which only went on the market in August, have included warnings about the steering wheel coming off. leaky fuel lines, incorrect wheel hubs and a problem with the cruise control that could cause the throttle to

A variety of corn developed by Monsanto to be resistant to the company's popular Roundup weedkiller will be dis­tributed for sale next year only to farmers in areas where grain is seldom sold for export, Verfaillie said. The corn is approved for food use in both the United States and Japan but not in Europe. Traces of the corn were found this fall in British-made tortilla chips. 
The second Monsanto corn variety, which won't be put on the market until 2002, is toxic to an insect pest. the corn root­worm. It is yet to be approved

The actions announced Monday don't affect Monsanto's most popular gene­altered crops, which include Roundup-resistant soybeans and cotton and a variety of corn that is toxic to another pest, the European corn borer. 
A representative of the National Corn Growers Association, which is especially concerned about losing sales to Japan. praised Monsanto's moves. "We could not jeopar­dize our biggest corn market by supporting the commercial ization" of a corn variety that was not approved by that coun­try, said Susan Keith, senior director of public policy fur the growers group.

U.S. corn exports have fallen sharply this fall, especially to Japan, the biggest foreign cus­tomer for the grain. 
Critics both inside and out­side the biotech industry say Starlink, the only gene-altered crop not allowed in food, never should have been put on the market without being approved for human consumption. 
The Environmental Protection Agency is holding a public meeting Tuesday on a request by Aventis to approve StarLink temporarily for food use to avoid further food recalls.

Although sales of the Escape began in August, some dealers had small numbers of the vehicle in their lots since October 1999 which were used f'or test-drives. 
Vaughn said this was the first Escape notice that had involved a large number of vehicles already sold to con­sumers. He said the wind­shield wiper problem was found through warranty claims, and that Ford expects leading the list. The company also announced in April that it would pay for failing bead gaskets on about one million 3.8-litcr V6 engines built in the early to mid-1990s. 

Ford executives have said recalls are acceptable to the company as a way of improv­ing relations with customers, a prime directive of Ford CEO Jae Nasser. 
"Our philosophy is to con­stantly monitor the perfor­mance of our vehicles, and 
goal is to correct them quick­
ly." 
One industry expert said Ford doesn't appear Lo have been penalized by customers for the recalls so far -but could be if more come soon. 
Ford has seen its share of high-profile recalls this year, with the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires on Ford trucks Ford's imuge with potential buyers, they could also improve relations with Escape owners in the first 90 days, when automakers survey cus­tomer satisfaction.

American troops patrol the Kosovo side of the zone. Nevertheless, the presence of additional tanks, armored personnel carriers and infantry was seen as a demon­stration of Belgrade's resolve to prevent ethnic Albanian rebels from seizing and hold­ing Serbian territory. "They are terrorists and bandits and will be treated as such," said Vladan Batie, a leading Kostunica ally who vis­ited the area Sunday. "It is the task of every responsible state to protect its citizens." In a report obtained Sunday by The Associated Press, the Yugoslav Interior Ministry estimated that about 1,000 ethnic Albanians were involved in the recent attacks and were receiving support from ethnic Albanian sympa­thizers in nine villages on Serb-controlled territory. 
Yugoslav officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the militants had smug­gled small artillery pieces and more than 100 small mortars across the U.S.-patrolled boundary into positions on the Yugoslav side of the demilita­rized zone. 
The Interior Ministry report said Serb police "cannot hold out long unless they receive reinforcements from Serbia proper." It recommended mobilizing Serb men of mili­tary age and using them to augment police units already in the area. 
In Buj an ovac . one of th e towns in the contested area, Mayor Stojanca Arsic blamed tho attacks on the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian rebel group which fought Yugoslav forces in Kosovo last year but which NATO says has been disband­ed. lie urged NATO peace­keepers in Kosovo to "really disarm the supposedly demili­tarized Kosovo Liberation Army" and prevent more weapons from reaching the buffer zone.

Admittedly, Advent can strike the modern .sensibilities as something out of seep, an awkward resistance to the festive holiday spirit which begins, at the very latest, on the day after Thanksgiving. Everyplace else Christmas is announced with greater or lesser dignity, but in church we can seem to be scuck in a sort ofsemi-Lent with the 
somber tones of "O Come, 0 Come Emmanuel" to keep us company till rhe poinsettias finally show up on the alrar for Midnight Mass. It is a fair question: Advent ... what's the point? 

The layers ofAdvent give us a window into the thinking and spirit ofour ancestors in the faith. Various clans ofthe ancient Catholic family tree have had their say. Ancient Gallican, Spanish, Roman and even some Germanic influences have shaped the season. Today Advent is dominated by two figures and two themes. 
Advent opens with the fairly scary John the Baptist. He ears grasshoppers and wild honey. He lives in the wilderness and dresses in the pelts of beasts. His message is fiery and to the point. Repenr! Change your life. Get ready. The Messiah is coming. The point of Advent is to remind us that chis world is

Advent is as deep as the commercial season can be superficial. Outmoded, Medieval, and our of sync? Perhaps. But, it bears within it the essential stuff no Christian life can do without-reflection on a two thousand year old story, our openness to the Lord and to his call, and the eternal home for which we are all in preparation.

Lawmakers propose alternatives 
. Texas analyzes current capital punishment policy 
Associated Press 
AUSTIN, Texas 

As the U.S. Supreme Court 
prepares to hear the appeal of 
a Texas death row inmate 
whose lawyers say he is men­
tally retarded, a group of state 
lawmakers said Monday juries 
should be allowed to sentence 
killers to life in prison without 
parole. 
Current law allows Texas 
juries two options for capital 
murder convictions: death or 
a "lifo" sentence that allows 
for parole afler 40 years. 
"I think we should give them 
as many options as possible," 
said. Democratic Sen. Eddie 
Lucio, who is sponsoring a bill 
to create a life without parole 
sentence. The Legislature con­
venes in January. 
Lucio said 33 other states, 
the federal government, and 
the military have the death 
penalty with an option for life 
without parole. Such a sen­
tence might appeal to jurors 
who fear that a convicted 
killer could go free or who 
cannot decide whether to give 
a death sentence, Lucio said. 
Lucio said the bill is not 
meant to reduce the number 
of executions in Texas, the 
nation's busiest death penalty 
state, where 37 inmates have 
been put to death by lethal 
injection this year. 
"I support the death penal­
ty," Lucio said. 'Tm not trying 
to steer jurors away from the 
death penalty." 
But retiring llarris County 
District Attorney John 
Holmes Jr. said the bill 
"would eliminate the death 
penalty." 
"A jury will have a heck of a The court said it will use the time giving the death penalty case to clarify how much if they have the possibility of opportunity jurors in death locking them up forever," penalty cases must have to Holmes said. "As a taxpayer, I consider the defendant's men­don't know whv I have to take tal capacity. someone who has engaged in Lucio said he didn't know such conduct ... and support whether Penry's case would that guy for the rest of his be one in which a jury would natural life.

senator, (D)-Texas
said chang­ing the law would be unlikely to slow the pace of executions in Texas. 
"You may see a decrease ... but I think it will be virtuallv unnoticeable," he said°. "They'll s~ill get their death sentences. 
Lucio filed a similar bill in 1999. Both it and the House version of the bill died when they never came up for a vote. 
Despite that defeat and the fact there has been little change in the Legislature's makeup, the bill sponsors said they felt they should bring it up again. 
"I think I think as long as its clear we're not trying to elimi­nate the death penalty and just trying to give juries a dif­ferent option it has a decent shot of passing," said Sen. Rodney Ellis of Houston.

The death penalty still has strong support in Texas even though recent polls have shown some concern about its enforcement. 
A Scripps Howard Texas Poll released in June found that 5 7 percent of those sur­veyed believe Texas has put an innocent person to doath. Nonetheless, 7 3 percent of those surveyed favored the death penalty. 
A Gallup Poll earlier this year put support nationally for capital punishment at 66 percent, its lowest level since 1981. 
Steven Hawkins, who heads the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, said public support of the death penalty erodes when juries are given the choice of life without parole. 
"We definitely see life with­out parole as a positive devel­opment because it offers an alternative to the death penal­ty," Hawkins said.

"This is regrettable because we believe the government has an obligation to honor the cer­tified results of the election," Cheney told a Washington news conference, referring to Florida's certification Sunday of Bush and Cheney as winners there.

With the election tied up in court, the government's house­keeping agency says Bush doesn't qualify for the $5.3 million. 
President Clinton endorsed the agency's decision but said he didn't guide it. 
"The General Services Administration believes that it cannot offer transition assis­tance to both of them, which is what I would otherwise be inclined to do," Clinton said. "And I think they're going with what they think the law requires."

The 90,000 square feet of office space leased by the GSA for the transition will remain locked up as long as "any doubt" remains about who won, said White House Press Secretary Jake Siewert. 
"The law is pretty clear," he said. Siewert said the decision has been left to GSA Administrator 
David  Barram,  a  Clinton  
appointee,  but  the  White  
House  also  has  asked the  

Justice Department to provide guidance on interpretation of transition law. 
Barram is authorized by law to determine the "apparent" winner for the purpose of turn­ing over the otlice and money. 
"We believe that as long as both sides are still pursuing their court challenges there is no apparent winner," said GSA spokeswoman Beth Newburger.

At Notre Dame good things happen from the bottom up. For example, on Nov. 9 the Maritain Center, Knights of Columbus and St. Thomas Moore Society sponsored a presentation by Father John Harvey. OSFS, and David  Morrison on Catholic teaching and homosexuality. 
The Church teach­es that "homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered," accord­ing to the Catecism. Homosexuality, or the inclination to such acts, is not itself a sin. However, as the Letter on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons, issued with the approval of John Paul II in 1986, states: "Although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not_a sin, it is a ... tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil and thus the incli­nation itself must be seen as an objec­tive disorder." The Catechism states: "The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tenden­cies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, consti­tutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, com­passion and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the dif­ficulties they may encounter from their condition." 
Father Harvey and Morrison put this issue in a personalized context. At the request of Terence Cardinal Cooke of New York in 1980, Father Harvey founded Courage, the growing interna­tional support group. Courage includes 

groups for men and women and a sup­
port group for parents, called 
Encourage. 

The Five Goals of Courage, written 
by the early members, are: "1. To live 
chaste lives in accordance with the 
Roman Catholic Church's teaching on 
homosexuality; 2. To dedicate our 
entire lives to Christ; 3. To foster ... fel­
lowship [to] ensure that none of us will 
have to face the problems of homosex­
uality alone; 4.... [T]o encourage one 
another in forming and sustaining 
[chaste friendships]; 5. To live lives 
that may serve as good examples to 
others with homosexual difliculties." 
Courage members "follow a plan of 
life that takes the person as far as pos­
sible from the gay milieu ... Since 
Courage is primarily concerned with 
helping individuals to live a life of inte­
rior chastity, it does not require that 
its members strive to get out or the 
condition itself. Courage, however, 
does encourage members who want to 
do so to seek counsel and group thera­
py in a context of prayer." 
David Morrison, author of Beyond 
Gay, described his "pilgrimage from 
being a homosexual-rights activist to 
living life as a chaste Catholic. I had a 
lover of five years, a condominium in a 
major urban area, a satisfying job, and 
a church life as an Episcopalian." The -writings of the Protestant, Dietrich 
Bonhoeffer, martyred by the Nazis, led 
Morrison to embark on what became 
his "journey to the Catholic faith ... 
[T]he Catholic Church is the only 
Christian institution that not only 
preaches the truth of chastity for 
homosexual people but offers practical, 
tangible help for achieving it." 
"In the act of ... 'coming out,"' notes 
Morrison, "one sacrifices individual 
personhood for identity in the group ... 
[O]nce a person has made a decision 
that he is not merely homosexually ori­
ented, but is gay, then ... everything 
else -society, faith. institutions and 
even God will be viewed ... through 
that ... lens. Homosexual orientation is 
not a choice for most people, but being 
gay is and it is this choice which moti­
vates homosexual groups ranging from 
Dignity to ACT UP." 
It has not been proven that the 
homosexual inclination is genetic or 
otherwise innate. We do not delinitive­
ly know what causes that inclination. 
Yet there is abundant evidence that 
persons of homosexual inclination can 
lead chaste lives committed to Christ. 
Neither Father Harvey nor Morrison 
makes any universal claim beyond 
that. although they affirm that some 
persons of' homosexual inclination 
have been able. with counseling and 
therapy, to go on to marriage and suc­
cessful heterosexual lives. 
The Administration misleads Notre 
Dame students here. The 
Administration refuses to admit that 
the homosexual inclination is disor­
dered. Yet the Administration affirms 
that "oflicial Church teaching" man­
dates that the inclination may not be 
acted upon. This implies that the 
"Church teaching" is an arbitrary 
restriction. If the inclination is not dis­
ordered, why may it not be acted 
upon? In truth, homosexual acts and 
the inclination toward them, are 
"objectively disordered" because they 
are contrary to the nature built into us 
by God. The recognition of this reality 
is the lirst step toward a coherent 
approach to this question. 
The Administration should invite 
Father Harvey to form a Courage chap­
ter at Notre Dame. Students could ben­
efit from the efforts of this admirable, 
perceptive and charitable priest. 
Political correctness ought not to stand . in the way.

Do it right rather than rapidly 


Last Sunday my host family invited my par­ents, who visited for Thanksgiving, and I to dine at their home. We arrived at two o'clock and moved slowly to the dinner table, where we enjoyed u wonderful three-course meal consisting of Austrian specialties. Conversation about Innsbruck and Tirol and the Alps filled the pauses between the bites of food and sips of Viennese wine. After eating for an hour and a half we took a walk around their small town of ~-­Sistrans located outside of Innsbruck and returned to coffee and Sachortorte, an Austrian chocolate-cake dessert. Classical music hummed in the back­ground as we sat by the fire and finished off the Sunday dinner five hours

The shelves of grocery stores are lined with 30-minuto frozen piz­zas, Stouffer's Lasagna in a disposable pan and Unclfl Ben's minute rice. An average American meal lasts only 12 min­utes. 
And in those 12 minutes Americans barely taste the food that they shovel into their mouths. 
In contrast. Europeans seem to savor every bite. The Austrian appreciation for good food evidences itself not only in the meals enjoyed at host families, homes but also in the super­market. In Spar and M-Preis stores, only one

The supermarket offerings certainly differ from those in American stores, which sell all varieties of chemical-laden reduced-fat, lower calorie food. And yet, ironically the American, not the European, waistline constantly expands. Perhaps the health of the french lies not in their consumption of red wine, but in their slow, moderate consumption of all food and drink. 
In my first semester here in Innsbruck I have found that this appreciation for mealtime parallels the greater appreciation of Europeans for life in general. Everything in Europe seems to move slower than in the United States. Stores in Austria often close for two hours for lunch and the shopper cannot count on the owner of the business to return for the afternoon if he has had good company at his midday meal. Business usually ends at five and work rarely extends into Sunday. Students in no rush to obtain a diploma and to enter the work force study for seven or eight years at the university.

Religion is scared of Hollywood 
STILLWATER, Okla. 
Throughout the tornadic fury that was once research for a pro­ject, I came across a jewel of an article claiming that Hollywood was in part responsible for the decline in religion across the world. I would have dismissed it, had the article not blamed many of the films I consider to be prominent examples of what cinema should be. 
The first example cited by this skewed report Cass Rains was the latest sci-fi psychotic thriller, "The Cell." The author states a crucial piece of the plot by revealing that the killer committed his 
Daily

horrible acts because of a botched baptism. 
O'Collegian

Hence, blaming Hollywood for directly relating religion to the imaginative slaughter of an actor -obviously the intent of the writer, producer and director. 
The tirade continues to attack films that decay the once shining white moral fiber of America, claiming that Kevin Spacey led many to abandon their families and smoke pot in their garages. The author also states, "American Beauty" glorifies the dysfunctional family and promotes promiscuous sex and deviancy. 
The list went on and on, citing scenes from films such as "Stigmata" and "Dogma," insinuating they defame the image of the Catholic Church and defile any self-sacrifice in the name of free­dom of religion. 
But the author failed to realize that the entertainment business makes its money from giving people what they want. Hollywood doesn't force people to follow the norms and stigmas exaggerated in their films. because the people supplied the wood for this fire. 
Maybe some thought Kevin Smith playfully examined the hypocrisy of the Catholic Church or really enjoyed seeing the little guy win for a change in "American Beauty." Maybe some even find it entertaining to watch an unusual plot unfold about a serial killer. Obviously they do because these films fared very well according to box office returns. 
Had the films been the true atrocities they were made out to be, no one would have gone to see them. People would have skipped the matinee and gone to sit through a sermon concerning the decline of morality. But they didn't because they wanted to be entertained. The public wants to be shocked and appalled and see everything turn out all right after an hour and a half. 
Movies that are now considered to be boring and dull were once the pivotal stories of a generation. Believe it or not, "Gone With The Wind" met some resistance on the way to the top. Then, it had a great plot, real characters and a universal setting. Now, moviego­ers would turn their noses. We have seen the same story rehashed so many times that we need a surprise every two seconds and enough blood to fill a swimming pool to even watch the trailer. 
Things such as films, music and literature are a reflection of the times and state of society. There will always be someone who com­plains about those things because they have nothing else to hold onto -except the strife they created. Revived McCarthyism won't make the world a second Eden. 
Attacking movies, music and books won't prevent the decay of anything. We live in an age that is wealthy with information and advancements -some cannot come to grips with such a blatant reality. If you don't like the movie don't buy a ticket and try not to spoil the show for everyone. And in the now immortal words of Kevin Spacey, "J rule!"

The Clan also finally brings in big names like Nas, Snoop Dogg, Redman and Busta Rhymes to rap on a couple of their tracks for the first time. Even Isaac Hayes makes an appearance on one of the tracks. The album starl'i off incredibly strong with the song "Chamber Music," which features Haekwon at his best and an awesome cho­rus by Method man that only demonstrates why he is the best selling solo Wu-Tang artist. The second song, "Careful (Click, Click)," is really raw but if you listen to it more than once, it becomes almost hypnotic, and will leave fans listening to it over and over. With producing that is probably best labeled as "inter­esting," and the constant chang­ing of sound levels, "Careful" truly is a great song. The only  negative aspect being that the band actually recycled some of their lyrics from the '95 release . 36 Chambers. The fourth song, "Redbull," features possibly the hottest duo in rap today with Hedman and Method Man showing olT their lyrical superiority to a horn background. And even though it may not be up to the quality of songs that one would hear on the album Blackout, this song's musical divergence from the Wu-Tang norm make it a must listen. "Conditioner" is another extremely significant song to the album because il"is the only song in which O.O.B. actually raps.  And in true O.O.B. style, it sounds almost as if' it were recorded in a garage (or pr.rhaps in this case. a jail cell). Snoop 0ogg, one of the greatest cameo rappers ew~r. makes this song more than decent. "Do You Heally (Thang Thang)" is just flat out awesome and will definitely be among the best tracks the Wu-Tang Clan has ever produced. As will "Gravel Pit," a song that features fast lyrics, cool spy music, female vocals and all fans could ever ask from the Wu-Tang. Overall, the wait was worth it. If this is to be the last true Wu­Tang Clan album, at least they went out with a bang.  


ALBUM REVIEW 

Slim explores experimental concepts on Halfway 
By TOM OGORZALEK 
Scene Music Critic 
When it comes to the big beats, there is no artist better known than Fatboy Slim. Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars, his first release since his 1998 breakthrough You've Come a Long Way, Baby is more mature and inventive than even that offering (which he called "too Disney"). 
In Halfway, though it doesn't seem to offer the blockbuster dance hall potential of tracks like "Funk Soul Brother" and "Praise You," it does 



On his most recent release, Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars, Fatboy Slim breaks from his up a spicy traditional formulaic club music, experimenting more with trance music and guest vocalists. dance stew. Far from the 
seem that Slim -real name Norman Cook -has decided to back away from the formulaic club scene in which he flirted with in the past to explore more experimental ideas. 
Halfway takes more from the genre of trance than Fatboy's earlier work. This innuence is particularly evident in the hypnotically surreal "Sunset (Bird of Prey)." in which a spoken word sample of Jim Morrison is used to paint a picture of what Fatboy calls "Every sunset I've ever watched." 
Cook gets some unbelievably sweet help from the living as well. Macy Gray, fresh off of' a breakout of her own, teams with her fellow Brit to provide the vocals on two well-pro­duced tracks, the funky "Love Life" and the more subdued "Demons." Ashley Slater, Bootsy Collins, Roland Clark and Roger Sanchez also con-

tribute to the effort. 
W h i 1 e assembling this roster of talent, Cook also took care to create an album that somehow remains effectively balanced in spite of ­or perhaps because of -the myriad of influences that might potentially pull tracks in different directions. He rides a veritable pendu­1um from straight funk -for the funky -to pensive trance -for the 
stoned -to a sort of disco­

funk fusion that is sure to amuse those in the crowd that want to move and then back to a sort of peaceful float­ing piano that serves to bring a twisted and uneasy sereni­ty. Throw in lyrics like, "Walk without rhythm, and it won't attract the worm," and Fatboy Slim is once Photo courtesy of fatboyslim.org.uk again brewing 
mindless lyrics and repetitive beats of the typical mainstream electronic artist, Fatboy Slim has proven with Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars that he is more interested in coming up with experimental concepts in electronic sound that are nonethe­less pleasing to a wide-ranging audi­ence. And like Moby, he has been able to touch the mainstream without becoming polluted by it. Cook's music remains !'resh and dynamic, and he's not afraid to try new techniques and sounds within his work. 
Furthermore, this album could bn seen as a concept in itself. There is a distinct cohesion, despite its varied internal styles, and it ends as it begins. with a mystical crescendo into a big bright y(i!low sun.

LOS ANGELES 

Winning teams capitalize on oppo­nent's mistakes and make very few of their own. 
The Irish proved this theory Saturday afternoon. taking advantage of four USC turnovers en route to a 38-21 victory that likely sends the Irish to a Bowl Championship Series bowl. 
"We're not a team that has marquee players," Irish head coach Bob Davie said following the game. "We probably played a football team today that had more talented individuals on the team than we do, but we're a good football team." 
Notre Dame broke away early in the third quarter following an interception by Glen Earl. On the first play following the interception, freshman quarterback Matt LoVecchio found a diving Javin Hunter downfield for a 48-yard comple­tion that put the Irish on the 4-yard line. 
"We've been certainly waiting for Javin to break loose," said Davie. "I think he has the potential that maybe some of those receivers you saw out there on the other side of the field have." 
Following three failed attempts to run the ball into the end zone, Davie decided to go for the touchdown on fourth-and­goal at the 2-yard line rather than kick a field goal. The strategy proved success­ful as Lovecchio ran the option perfect­ly, running the ball into the corner of the end zone to put the Irish up 28-14. 
"Thank God we've got him," Notre Dame offensive coordinator Kevin Rogers said of LoVecchio -now 7-0 as a starter. "You're talking about a kid who's a different guy for an 18-year old. It's not so much in terms of his ability, it's the intangible qualities that he's got in terms of his cool under pressure and his belief in himself." 
Notre Dame's first score of the game ca.me after a partially blocked punt by David Givens. Following the block, the Irish took advantage of the field position, marching 40 yards downfield in a drive that culminated in a 1-yard touchdown run by Terrance Howard. 
USC tied the game tied the game at seven later in the first quarter, but the Irish took control of the game in the sec­ond -thanks to two stellar defensive plays. 
Walk-on Chad DeBolt's blocked punt -the fifth block punt of the season for the Irish, a school record -put the Irish in the SO-yard line. 
Four plays and one roughing the pass­er penalty later, LoVecchio scored on a 13-yard run down the sideline. 
Only three plays later, senior safety Tony Driver intercepted a Carson Palmer pass and returned it 43 yards to the USC 19-yard line. Six plays later, Tony Fisher scored the fourth touch­down of the game for the Irish. 
"I haven't seen a special teams team like this in a long time," said Fiesta Bowl selection committee member Evan Paoletti. "J think they're a good team." 
After a Nick Setta 39-yard field goal. the Irish were able to run down the clock on their final scoring drive, moving the ball 80 yards on the ground before Julius Jones scored on a 2-yard run to put the Irish up 38-21 with 2:57 left. 
"At the end of the game when you have something line 10 or 12 straight running plays and ice the game, it shows that you can run the football," said Davil!. "When you can run the ball when other people know you're going to run it, you're a pretty good rushing football team." 
Notre Dame also tied an NCAA record for fewest turnovers in a season with eight. Davie expressed pride in that sta­tistic, a statistic that exemplifies the low­risk offense that Notre Dame plays. 
"My first year as football coach we had 12, which was second-lowest in the history of Notre Dame football," said Davie. "My second year we had 13, which was third-lowest in the history of Notre Dame football. Last year we had 30 turnovers, and we went 5-7." 
On Friday night before the game, Notre Dame had a ceremony honoring each graduating senior. The team brought out each player's home jersey and had a poster made honoring each athlete. After a highlight reel was played of the player's accomplishments, each player's position coach spoke of the player's accomplishments. 
"That's one of my most memorable moments at Notre Dame," said senior wide receiver Joey Getherall of the event. "It showed how much we care for each other. We'd sell our souls for each othor."

IRISH INSIGHT 

LOS ANGELES Could there have been a more fitting scene? 
Here, minutes from Hollywood, Bob Davie completed his transformation from outcast to outstanding. 
Shortly after his postgame press confer­ence, Davie spot­ted Kevin Hickey, the Fiesta Bowl's treasurer, in the corridor leading to the Irish lock­er room. 
Then, follow­ing a script straight from central casting, the unlikely duo embraced. 
"I saw you guys before that first pep rally," Davie told Hickey after Notre Dame's 38-21 win over USC. "You've been with us the whole way." 
And now, three months since Hickey attended the season opener against Texas A&M, Davie and company seem destined for a New Years in Arizona. 
"I'm not justjumping on the band­wagon," Hickey said. 'Tve been here since the beginning." 
He's in the minority. On the gloomy Sunday morning (Sept. 10), when Arnaz Battle's navicular bone injury became official, a devastated Davie tried to downplay the incident. 
"Although this is a major, major blow it's not going to be an excuse," Davie said on Sept. 10. "No one should feel sorry for us." 
No one did. By mid-afternoon, Irish fans basked in Davie's imminent departure. 
Less than 90 days remained until the Tom Coughlin Era began, these so­called fans thought. 
When the end ofDavie occurred, one could imagine a 10-Step Method of celebration, 
Cue the Victory March. Kiss Rockne's grave. Genuflect in front of the Basilica. Light a candle at the Grotto. Scream across South Quad. 
Sing the Alma Mater. Dream of the next coach. Shine the Golden Dome. Jump in Stonehenge. Praise Kevin White. 
Now? 

Anyone have extra tickets to Tempe? 
And there will be no repeat of the infamous yard sale one former Notre Dame coach had in July. 
"I would suspect Bob Davie will be a very successful coach here and he's earned it," said White, Notre Dame's athletic director. "He's moving pretty 

Tim Casey 
Assistant Sports Editor 

dramatically in that direction. I think we're all seeing what Bob's capable of doing." 
That includes joining old boss Lou Holtz and Oklahoma's Bob Stoops as one ofthe three finalists for the Football News 2000 National Coach of the Year Award. 
Plus, with a 9-2 record and No. 11 ranking in the Bowl Championship Series polls, the Irish are BCS-eligible. The Big 12 champion has an automat­ic bid for the Fiesta Bowl. But if top­ranked Oklahoma defeats Kansas State in Saturday's conference cham­pionship game, then the Sooners are headed for the Orange Bowl to play for the national championship. 
Either way, the Fiesta Bowl has the first at-large pick. Other teams vying for the one or two (if Oklahoma beats Kansas State) spots include Oregon State (10-1), Miami (9-2), Nebraska (9­
2) and Virginia Tech (10-1 ). 
The official pairings won't be announced until Sunday. But Notre Dame's choice bv the Fiesta Bowl is the worst kept ~ecret since Davie announced Matt LoVecchio as starter. 
"Anytime you can have Notre Dame, they travel very, very well, they're a class group of people to have around and it's rich with tradition," said Hickey, who attended "four or five" other Irish games this year. "Notre Dame is always healthy for any bowl." 
How appropriate Hickey would use "healthy" to describe the Irish. During the nightmarish November of 1999. Davie kept referring to the Irish 's 21 injured players. At the time, writers (myself included) criticized Davie for his excuses. Besides the health issues, Davie also constantly mentioned his team's lack of talent and difficult schedule. 
On Saturday, Notre Dame's head coach commented on the 2001 squad. 
"I look forward to next year," Davie said. "This will be the most talented team we'll have since I've been at Notre Dame and we'll probably play the most difficult schedule in the histo­ry of Notre Dame." 
Instead of a whining fool, people perceived Davie as an honest man. Or they ignored the statement. Winning's a potent cure in this crazy profession. Consider USC coach Paul Hackett. 
Moments after Davie hugged Hickey, Hackett entered the media room. Hackett, who was fired on Monday after compiling a 19-18 record in three years (including a 5-7 mark this season), refused to discuss his uncer­tain future. 
'Tm going to take a few questions," Hackett said, "and then I'm going to hibernate." 
Add that scene to The Bob Davie Story. Because popular opinion said Davie would be the one searching the Help Wanted sections jn late November. 
Not according to tailback Tony Fisher, however. 
"We couldn't worry about [the spec­ulation]," Fisher said. "Coach Davie is like a father out there and we're his kids. So we had to go out there and protect our father." 
Hcferences to "family" routinely arise under the Golden Dome. And Davie may be the campaign's biggest supporter. 
Following practice on Oct. 4, I spoke with Davie about offensive guard Mike Candy's ascension from academic pro­bation to graduation in four years. 
After the other reporters left, we talked for nearly 10 minutes, an eter­nity for the busy coach. 
"Coming to Notm Dame is about guys maturing and guys growing." Davie said. "You're always going to have some guys on your team, just like in any walk in life, guys are going to make mistakes. But what you hope is that people in the student body appre­ciate that as a group they can really be proud of the way our guys go about doing things. 
"This isn't always an easy place. There's places where they don't have Davie 101 [a study hall for struggling football players] and you don't have to go to class. But here you do. And in the end, the ones who survive it are stronger for it and better people." 
He could have been talking about himself. But Davie never takes credit (at least publicly) for the turnaround. 
"l found out pretty quickly when I became head coach that you better put your own personal t'eelings aside, you better only focus and concentrate on other people -the players and the coaches," Davie said on Saturday. "You can get so consumed with worry­ing about your own situation that it changes your personality, it changes how you approach football every day. And I'm never going to do that." 
Memo to Davie: 
Relax and reflect. Place your head on the pillow, pull the sheets up and close your eyes. 
In the dark, with no cameras rolling, no microphones recording. Just you and your thoughts of the past 365 days. 
Curse the critics. 
Cry tears ofjoy. 
You deserve to.

Irish defensive line shuts down Trojan offense

"Probably the biggest sur­prise in the ball game was our inability to run," the now-fired head coach of USC Paul Hackett said after the game. "Without a running game against a team like Notre !Jame, you're reully going to struggle." 
The Irish defensive line con­trolled the line of scrimmage throughout the game and plugged nearly every hole in the Trojan front. Defensive tackles BJ Scott and Lance Legree along with defensive ends Ryan Roberts and Tony Weaver combined for six tack­les for loss. They also sacked USC quarterback Carson Palmer four times and forced a fumble.

HUNGRY FOR A FIESTA 
With chants of "BCS! BCS!" echoing from the stands, the Notre Dame players raised their helmets in victory at the Colesium for the first time since 1992. The 38-21 victory made the Irish eligi­
ble for a Bowl Championship Series bid as they finished with a 9­2 record and are currently ranked in the top 12 of the latest BCS standings. While no official BCS bowl pairings will be announced until Sunday, two members of the Fiesta Bowl selection commit­tee were seen at Saturday's game and expressed great interest in the Irish playing in Tempe on New Year's Day. If the Irish lock up a Fiesta Bowl Bid, it would be their third trip to the bowl and their first since 1995.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Boys show off new sense of maturity in new album 
By LAURA ROMPF Scene Music Criri~ 
A lot has happen since the summer of 1999, when the Backstreet Boys released its sophomo,re album Millennium. The single "I Want. H That Way" Look the country by storm. and landed in the top 10 of the Holling Slone/MTV Top 100 Pop Songs of all time. 
Boys Brian Littrell and Kevin Hichardson proposed to their long-term girlfriends and got married. BSB's rival boy band, *NSYNC, released its second album, Nu Strings Attached, which slutttered record sales, selling 2.4 million copies in the first week. 
So, nearly a year and a half later, the Boys have a lot to prove with the release of their Lhird album, 13lack and 
Blue. 
Was "I Want It That Way" the group's musical peak? Or can the Boys get even bigger'? Does growing "old" and get­ting married hurt sales among their primary audience? And finally, will this album sell at *NSYNC's level? Or will the Boys have to settle for No. 2 in the world of boy bands?

on Billboard's Top 100, the song is consis­tently No. 1 on MTV's TRL video request show. Its medi­um tempo and catchy lyrics will have audiences singing along in no time. 
The Boys newly released single, "The Call" is about a young gentle­man who's out for a night of clubbing with his buds and meets a girl. Eventually, he ends up calling his girlfriend at home to tell her

he's not coming home anytime soon, "Listen Baby I'm sorry, jusl wanna tell you don't worry/ I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me." Although it's about a complete play­er, it's a lively song, perfect for dancing. 
"Get Another Boyfriend" and "Nol For Me" are the album's other two upbeat songs. Both are good party hits with lyrics simple enough for anyone to sing along easily. These two tracks provide some much needed variety on the ballad-heavy album. 
In an attempt to silence many of their critics, the Boys wrote, or co-wrote, six of the 13 songs on Black and Blue. "Time" is a col­laboration of all five Boys and was pro­duced by Babyface. The song describes the Boys' road to stardom. "Time, look where we are and what we've been through. Time, sharing our dream. Time, goes on and on everyday. Time is what it is, come what may." 
All five Boys also wrote the song "The Answer to Our Life." And though the song's beat is catchy, its lyrics sound more like Christian rock than that from their normal fun party hits. 
And while these songs are decent, their cheesy lyrics may give the band's critics even more to complain about than before Lhe boys even starting writing their own music. 
The album also includes several ballads, one of which stands out from the rest. "Yes I Will," co-written by Boy 
A.J. McLean, is beautiful and ½ill likely be heard at wed­dings across the country for years to come. "Yes I will, take your hand and walk with you. Baby, I promise you. Yes I will, give you everything you need and someday start a family with you."

This ballad could have been even more charming if the entire album wasn't full of ballads. Perhaps the Boys have matured, and these songs about commitment and mar­riage reflect their current stage in life. However, while that seems to be a nice sentiment, it provides for very little variet)' on the album as a whole. 
So to answer the questions -does any song on Black and Blue compare to "I Want It That Way?" Well, if it doesn't, "Shape of My Heart" comes very close. It's appeal is universal, tempting audiences of all ages to tum up the radio and sing along. 
Will the Boys' age make a difference in their album sales? It has created a more mature sound on Black and Blue, but this is what separates the boys from other acts like *NSYNC, 98 Degrees and BBMak. 
And finally, will Black and Blue break records? Only "Time" can answer that question, and as the Boys them­selves say, "Time is what it is, come what may."

NFL 
Sacks take toll on Tampa Bay's King 
Associated Press 
TAMPA. Fla. 

Tampa Bay quarterback Shaun King sat out Monday's workout because of lower bat:k strain, but expects to play against the Dallas Cowbovs this weekend. 
The· second-year pro was sacked seven times during Sunday's '.H-17 victory over the Buffalo Bills and four times the previous week by the Chicago Bears. and the pounding is beginning to take a toll. 
''It tightened up at some point during the game. It's one of those things that just happened," King said. "It had been sore earlier, but nothing like that. It's just my back getting old." 
Dungy said the injury did not occur on any particular play, attributing the soreness to the usual wear and tear of a season. If King cau 't practice Wednesday, backup Eric Zeier will work with the starting offense in preparation for the Cowboys. 
"I don't think it was any one particular blow or anything that happened. It's just something he's complained about the last few weeks and it seems to be getting a little bit worse," Dungy said. 
"We'll probably know more Wednesday.... This is the worst he's felt after a game. I know he's had some X-rays and they've looked at it and we're getting some opinions on it and they don't seem to have pinpoint­ed exactly what it is." 
Although King has only thrown for 197 yards the past two weeks, the problems the Bucs had moving the ball against the Bills and Bears were not related to the quarterback's health. Tampa Bay only gained 180 yards against Buffalo with Warrick Dunn accounting for most of that with 106 rushing 
and 23 receiving. 
Defensive tackle Warren Sapp called attention to the offense's difficulties last week, criticizing offensive coordinator Les Steckel's system and play-calling and saying the unit lacked an identity. 
"I guess I don't have all the answers for why our passing game has struggled the last two weeks or we would have gotten it corrected and we would have thrown for 500 yards," Dungy said. 
"I think we know what we want to do and I think we can't lose sight of how we win and we can't worry if media-types think that passing for 60 (net) yards and winning 31-17 is bad. We happPn to think it's good." 
Uungy, who reiterated that he would have preferred Sapp air his frustration in private rather than the media, disputed the contention that the ilucs have yet to establish an identity on offense. 
"I think we have an identity. I think our players know what that is and hopefully we'll continue to build on that," the coach said, adding that Sunday's victory in which several players made sig­nificant contributions was a per­fect of example of how Tampa Bay likes to win. 
"When we're playing well, that's how we play. Everybody contributes. You never know who it's going to be. This week it was Karl Williams and David Gibson and the defensive line and the next week it may be someone else," Dungy said. 
"When it's going well, that's how it is. We can't rely on Derrick Brooks and Keyshawn Johnson every week. You expect big plays from your stars. But to be a good team you ve got to get it from everybody when it's need­ed. and when you get it from everybody you become a good team."

USC fires Hackett after 3 seasons 
Associated Press 

LOS ANGELES 
Paul Hackett was fired as Southern California's coach Monday after three seasons of mediocrity at a school that has won eight national championships. 
The dismissal came two days after the Trojans com­pleted their first losing sea­son since 1991 and just their third in the last 39 years. 
"Paul's a very nice human being, someone who I thought was a great leader for our kids," athletic direc­tor Mike Garrett said at a news conference in his office. "I'm sorry it didn't work out. It was not an easy decision. We have failed. Our whole objective now is to improve." 
Hackett, the fourth USC coach to be fired since 1986, had two years remaining on the five-year contract he signed in 1997 to succeed John Robinson. 
It's believed Hackett, an assistant under Robinson at USC from 1976-80, is being paid a buyout estimated at $800,000. 
The Trojans had a 19-18 record under the 53-year­old Hackett, including 5-7 this season. 
"For someone who's given three years of his life and for the last six months hasn't slept or eaten, I'm very disappointed," Hackett said. 'Tm disappointed we don't get a chance to contin­ue this and complete this, I felt things were headed in the right direction. 
"There's no question we took our lumps this year. In the time allotted, we didn't get a chance to make the kind of progress Mike Garrett wanted. I'm sure he'll do the right thing for

Paul Hackett fonner USC head coach 
the university." 

Hackett and Garrett met on campus Sunday night and again Monday morning to finalize details of the firing. 
Garrett, who won the Heisman Trophy as a run­ning back at USC in 1965, said he didn't make the decision solely on the Trojans· record. 
"Kids weren't progressing, weren't developing," he said. "All of us have gone through a lot of pain, a lot of suffering. When we don't beat people, it's painful." 
Garrett said a search for Hackett's successor would begin immediately, and he hoped to find one "as soon as possible." 
Garrett wouldn't identify potential candidates, but responded favorably when three names were men­tioned -Oregon State coach Dennis Erickson, Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez, and Mike Riley, a former USC assistant now coaching the San Diego Chargers. 
Garrett said he has already received calls from interested parties, but wouldn't say how many. 
He also said no calls have 
been made since the deci­sion to fire Hackett only came a day earlitir, and that it's unlikely he'll look at a coordinator. 
Hackett was offensive 
coordinator for the Kansas 
City Chief's when he was 
hired. 

"Hight now, I'm looking for the best coach." Carrett said. "lie could be in Cucamonga, I would go sec him. I'm not excluding any­
one." 

Oregon State athletic director Mitch Barnhardt told XTHA radio in San Diego he would give USC permission to interview Erickson if' Garrett request­ed it. 
Erickson has been offered a contract extension, but hasn't signed it. 
The fifth-ranked Beavers (10-1) have been one of col­lege football's biggest sur­prises this season. 
Hiley, who has three years left on his contract with the Chargers, told XTHA he wanted to concentrate on his job in San Diego. 
"I want them to want me here, that would be great for me," said Hiley, whose team has a 1-11 record. 
The Trojans wound up tied for the cellar in the Pac-10 with a 2-6 record, including losses at home to California and Washington State. 
"In this day and age, you've got to make it happen quick," Hackett said. "We didn't make it happen quick enough, we didn't make the improvement we needed to make." 
USC has won eight nation­al championships, but none since 1978. 
The Trojans have played in 28 Rose Bowl games, win­ning 20, but have played in only one since beating Michigan 17-10 on Jan. 1, 1990.

Kennedy reasserts innocence 
. Co-defendant in Carruth murder trial set to retake stand today 
Associated Pres 
CHARLOTrE, N.C 

A co-defendant in Rae Carruth's murder trial said Monday he rejected plea agree­ments twice because he was innocent in the killing of the for­mer pro football player's preg­nant girlfriend. 
Michael Eugene Kennedy. one of three co-defendants, said he thought Carruth and the con­fessed triggerman, Van Brett Watkins, should be held accountable in the killing last year ofCherica Adams. Kennedy testified for prosecutors and was due back on the stand Tuesday morning. 
"I have no motive and neither does Stanley," Kennedy said, referring Lo another co-defon­dan t, Stanley Drew "Hoss" Abraham. 
Kennedy has testified he was driving a car carrying Abraham and Watkins, who shot Adams as she sat in her own car where it was stopped behind Carruth's vehicle. 
Kennedy said he felt Carruth had threatened his life. After the slaying, he said, Carruth told him not to talk to police. 
Adams was eight months pregnant with Carruth's child when she was shot Nov. 16, 1999, in what prosecutors said was a trap laid by Carruth to avoid having to pay child sup­port. 
Carruth, at the time a member of the Carolina Panthers, has denied involvement in the shoot­ing. 
"I have four children," Kennedy said. "Unlike Rae, I would never kill them or pay somebody to kill them.... Some people might call me a snitch for what I did, but I'm pretty sure nobody in their right mind would have gone down for something they didn't do." 
Kennedy said Carruth paid Watkins to shoot Adams. He also said Carruth gave him $100 to buy a gun. 
The 26-year-old Carruth could be executed if convicted of arranging Adams' shooting. Adams, 24, gave birth to a son, then died a month later, The boy is in the custody of Adams' mother. 
Watkins has confessed to shooting ,A.dams, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and agreed to testify against Carruth. 
Carruth 's defense has claimed Watkins shot Adams in anger because Carruth reneged on a promise to pay for drugs and because she made an obscene gesture at Watkins from her car. 
Kennedy and Abraham are to be tried separately on murder charges. 
On cross-examination, Kennedy admitted to selling drugs, but said he was forced to do it because he was out of work. 
"l had lost my job and I did it every once in a while," he told defense lawyer David Rudolf, who tried to discredit Kennedy's testimony. 

For more than two hours. Rudolf attempted to impeach Kennedy as a credible witness, asking him questions about past drug dealing and his role in the 1994 shooting of another drug dealer. 
Ile tried unsuccessfully to get Kennedy to say he was testifying without a plea agreement in hopes of earning a more lenient sentence when he goes on trial. 
"I just want that family to know the truth," Kennedy said, looking at Cherica Adams' rela­tives in the courtroom. 
At the end of the day, with the jury gone. Superior Court Judge Charles Lamm upheld a motion by witness Candace Smith, who wanted to prevent her face from being shown on Court TV or in still photographs when she testi­fies. 
According to published reports, Smith, a former girl­friend of Carruth, told police he said he disliked Adams so much he wished she was dead. Smith also said Carruth told her he had seen Adams shot and left the scene worrying that he would be implicated. 
As testimony opened Monday, Kennedy repeated parts of his testimony from last week's two days of trial to refresh the mem­ories of jurors who had a long holiday weekend off. 
He said Carruth told him to follow as he and Adams drove in separate vehicles. Carruth said a friend would be in Kennedy's car who "would know what to do," Kennedy testified. 
He said Carruth had talked to him prior to the killing about wanting to avoid child support payments.

Beurlein's passing leads Carolina to win 
Associated Pre» 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. 
Steve Heuerlein has felt per­
sonally responsible for several 
Carolina losses this season. On 
Monday, he was a major rea­
son the Panthers won. 
Beuerlein overcame two 
turnovers to pass for 24:-! yards 
and three touchdowns to lead 
the Panthers to a 31-14 victory 
over the Green Bay Packers. 
Beucrlein, who only had 13 
turnovers all of last season. 
came into the game with 19 
this year. He'd also been 
sacked a league-high 45 times. 
The poor numbers caused the 14-year veteran to take responsibility for several set­backs~ especially a 20-10 loss to New Orleans this month, when he gave up the bull five times. 
Against the Packers, it looked like Beuerlein's turnovers would again hurt Carolina (5­7). He threw two first-quarter touchdown passes to put Carolina up 14-0, but negated those with a fumble and inter­ception in the second quarter that led to Green Bay TDs. 
As Beuerlein dropped back to pass early in the second quar­ter, LeRoy Butler pushed the ball out of his hands directly into Nate Wayne's open arms. Green Bay scored 44 seconds later, when Ahman Green ran 
26 yards untouched into the 
end zone to make it 14-7. 
Beuerlein later wasted fan­
tastic field position when he 
was intercepted at the 10-yard 
line. 
The Panthers got the ball 
when Ken Walters' punt 
dropped between Allen Rossum 
and Mike t\IcKenzie, and the 
ball then bounced up and hit 
McKenzie. Carolina's Karl 
Hankton pounced on it and the 
Panthers had the ball at the 20. 
But Beuerlein was picked off three plays later by Tyrone Williams. who returned it 46 yards. Packers quarterback Hrett Favre then hit Donald Driver with a 32-yard touch­down pass that tied it 14-14 with 2:02 to play in the half. 
Beuerlein finished 22-of-37 with two turnovers and two more sacks. But he came up big when it counted, and for tho second year in a row hurt the Packers' bid !'or the play­offs. 
A year ago, he scored on a 5­yard touchdown run as time expired to rally Carolina to a 33-31 win. Several Green Bay players later said that loss cost them a shot at the postseason. 
This year. Green Bay (5-7) needed to win to keep their slim hopes alive. The Packers must now win out -against Chicago, Detroit, Minnesota and Tampa Bay -to have a chance to make the playoffs.

NCAA FOOTBALL 
Beamer plans to return to Hokies 
Associated Press 
BLACKSBURG, Va. 

North Carolina's whirlwind courtship of Frank Beamer is over, and Virginia Tech and its football coach are still together. 
Beamer said Monday that he will return for a 15th season as coach of the No. 6 Hokies, ending a frantic day and a half that included an interview with North Carolina athletic director Dick Baddour, a widely reported job offer from the Tar Heels for as much as $1.4 million and a series of meetings with Virginia Tech officials. 
"What I really want to du is keep this thing going here," Beamer said at a news conference, "Sometimes it just takes you a little time to realize what a special thing we have here." 
Virginia Tech boosted Beamer's salary by 25 per­cent, to more than $1 mil­lion. He also will receive a $200,000 bonus if the Hokies earn a Bowl Championship Series berth, $100,000 for any other bowl invitation. 
"This is the university doing what it feels is right," Virginia Tech athletic direc­tor Jim Weaver said. "The university feels strongly that Frank Beamer should be among the highest paid coaches in the country, because he certainly is one of the best, if not the best." 
But Beamer said money was not the biggest consid­eration. 
"There's been a lot of talk here about money, but I can tell you relationships and the guys we have here in this program and the people I have helping me in this program is what's really important," he said. 
Beamer's assistants also will benefit. Virginia Tech added $100,000 to raise assistant coaches' salaries. 
"I wanted to make sure our coaching staff was com­pensated at a level that was the highest in the country because I think they are the best in the country," Beamer said. 


His success at Virginia Tech has made him a fre­quent target of other pro­grams, with Clemson and Alabama among the schools that have courted him. 
He was the near-consen­sus national coach of the year last season after lead­ing the Hokies to an 11-0 regular season record and the national championship game. 
The Hokies capped a 10-1 regular season on Saturday with a 42-21 victory against rival Virginia, and are in contention for a BCS berth. It would be their fourth trip to a major bowl in six years. the best such stretch in school history, and high­lights the Hokies' remark­able turnaround. 
Beamer. nearly fired in 1992 after compiling a 24­39-2 record in his first six seasons at his alma mater, has guided the Hokies to a 74-21 record since. Tech will extend its bowl streak to eight years this season, has won three Big East champi­onships in the past five sea­sons and become a fixture in the national polls. 
For a time Monday. it looked as if Beamer was leaning toward the Tar Heels, who have a glistening new athletic facility and a football history similar to Virginia Tech's. 
Earlier in the day, Virginia Tech defensive coordinator Bud Foster said Beamer met with his staff and was 
.,,.. 

"struggling" with the possi­bility of leaving after 14 sea­sons. 
"I think the bottom line is we're with him whatever he decides," said Foster, a member of Beamer's coach­ing staff' since 1981. when both were at Murray State. 
"He has a lot of loyalty to his staff and with his staff," said Foster, who turned down Florida's defensive coordinator job before last season. "He's a guy that knows how to run a success­ful program, it's not one guy. We as his assistants appreciate that."

The Irish didn't help the Bearcats' cause any, denying them second chances at the hoop. 
"We just buckled down defensively," Graves said. "We're a year wiser and a year better this year." 
In the second stanza. the Irish outrebounded the sup­posedly more athletic Bearcats squad 27-10. only allowing the Bearcats one offensive board. llumphrey dragged down 12 rebounds for Notre Dame. 10 of which came at the Bearcats' end of the court.

Dame to finish third in their division of the Big East behind Seton flail and unranked Georgetown. Perhaps a win like this \Viii help make them beHevP.rs. 
"Given all the preseason hype, we backed a little bit of it up, especially in the second half," said Brey, whose Irish outscored the No. 13 Bearcats 38-25 in the final 20 minutes. "We played defense, rebound­ed and got them in one-and­done situations. We were really poised and methodical with how we built our lead. We understand how to use our weapons to build a lead." 
They built that lead by con­tinually feeding the ball to the best player on the IToor. Murphy scored 15 of his 30 points in the final 13 minutes of the contest to help the Irish pull away. 
"That was a against the Bearcats while being guarded by Naismith candidate Kenny Satterfield. 
Graves and Matt Carroll are incredible shooters and smart role players. And perhaps the most important reason is that Brey has the Irish playing man-to-man defense. 
Matt Doherty's zone allowed players like Providence's Donta Wade to knock down a Big East record 10 3-pointers and score 38 points. That won't happen this year. 
And for those reasons, Notre Dame is expected to beat teams like Sacred Heart and Loyola by 40 points. And it is no longer an upset when the Irish beat the Bearcats by 18. 
"It was kiud of a program game," first-year head coach Brey said. "Their program is thought of better than ours. They've gone to the NCAA tournament for nine straight years and we haven't been there in 11 straight years. But we still have a long way to go 
and a Jot to

down the like this. It's stretch. They Irish head coach definitely 
know whose hands to get the ball in." 
This year's Irish squad has the chance to be something special. Last year, they were considered lucky when they knocked off Ohio State or swept the season series with defending champ Connecticut. But now people can come to exp_ect extraordinary things from this group. And there is good reason. The Irish are a lot better than they were last year. 
"They talked about what they wanted to do even before I was hired," Brey said. 'Tm just trying to point them in the right direction." 
"We're a year older and a year wiser," forward David Graves said. "Everyone has really bought into what Coach brings to the table." 
Aside from experience, there are several other rea­sons why this year's basket­ball team is better than last year's. Transfer Hyan Humphrey is the real deal and the missing piece of the puz­zle. Murphy is the most valu­able player to his team in the country. Senior Martin Ingelsby is a better point guard than Jimmy Dillon. He's 9-of-11 from 3-point range this season and he had an 8-1 assist to turnover ratio 
something to build on in the third game of the season." 
And with three more of what Brey likes to call "pro­gram games" ahead on the slate, the Irish have a chance to crack the top 10 and con­tinue to build a name for their program if they can avoid upsets by Vanderbilt, Indiana and Miami (Oh). With five cupcake games against teams like Long Island and Canisius following this challenging three-game stretch, the Irish could be staring 10-0 in the face before opening Big East play. 
The sky seems to be the limit for this year's Irish squad. 
"We played well but I don't think this is the best this team can play," Murphy said fol­lowing the win over Cincinnati. "It was a good beginning but we need to con­tinue to get better. It's nice to have all these things in the preseason, but we need to continue to win games. We're listed as one of the top teams, but we want to be there in the end."

Last year, Notre Dame knocked Santa Clara out of the tourna­ment in tho semifinals with a 1-0 victory. 
As in iast year's playoff game. Santa Clara outshot Notre Dame hy a wide margin, this time 18-4. Rut it didn't matter, because Santa Clara's shots were stopped by Irish goalkeeper Liz Wagner, who recorded eight saves. 
"I think Liz Wagner is the best goalkeeper in the country this year," Notre Dame coach Handy Waldrum said. "The fact that she doesn't get the recog­nition she deserves has been kind of amazing to me." 
Wagner leads the nation in goals against average at .302. Behind her defense of' the box, Notre Dame has given up just eight goals while scoring 75, and no team has scored more than one goal against the Irish. 
Notre Dame took the early lead on a shot by forward Ali Lovelace at the 16:31 mark.

Irish defender Monica Gonzalez swiped the ball from Kraus, then dribbled it down­field before heading it off' to Erikson. Erikson sent the cross to Lovelace near the middle of the field, who drilled the ball into the upper right hand cor­ner ol' the net with a spinning kick. 
It was Lovelace who scored the gamcwinner in '99 over then-No. 1 Santa Clara. 
Following Notre Dame's first score, Santa Clara let off a t1ur­ry of offensive shots. Midfielder Veronica Zepeda, forward Kristi Camlau and midl'ielder Dcvvyn llawkins each had a go at scoring, but Wagner kept each shot out of tho goal. 
The game became a defen­sive battle after that. Notrn Dame did not take a single shot on goal in the second half, and although Santa Clara took 11. all but one were turned away, 
1t was the final shot, at 87:12, that brought the Broncos back into the contest. Unassisted, Kraus delivered a rebound shot into the upper left corner of Notre Dame's goal, just out or Wagner's reach. 
"With the goal coming so late," Waldrum said, "and with all the pressure they were putting on us, I was worried that we might feel too deflated. But I'm so proud of how we came back in the overtime and created the opportunity to get the game-winning goal." 
Santa Clara's goal sent the game into overtime, where nei­ther team had lost this season. 
"We've been pretty success­ful in overtime this past year," said Slaton, who competed on the 2000 U.S. Olympic women's soccer team. "I think we went Aldama all in position to take into overtime four times, and the kick, Aldama took the shot, this was unfortunately the first but it sailed wide right and Liz time we had lost." Wagner tipped the shot away.

But Wagner was rock solid, and the Irish are 011 their way to San Jose. They will face the North Carolina Tar lleels Friday.

By MATT ORENCHUK 
Sports Writer 
The Notrn Dame hockev team entered this past weekend \-Vith high hopes or making some headway in the CCHA standings. 
But those hopes were dashed as the Irish finished the weel..nnu with a loss and a Lie to the Wildcats of No11.hern Michigan. 
Afler a bruta.l early schedule in which the Irish playr.d thre1i teams ranked in the top 10 nationally, Notre Dame had a 3-6-2 record and three points in the CCJIA standings. 
Predictably. Notre Dame was in dead last coming into this weekend's series against Northern Michigan. But the Irish didn't make up the ground that they needed to. 
On Friday night the Northern Michigan Wildcats came out strong. handing the Irish a 3-1 loss. 
Dave Inman got Notre Dame going early as he scored live minutes into the gamo to givo Notre Dame a 1-0 lead. While Notre Dame controlled the momentum for much of the first period, that was all the goals they were able to muster. In the second. momentum shifted to Northern Michigan. The Wildcats got the equalizer with 4:20 leil in the second period, and the tt~ams went into the second int.crmi'ision deadlocked at one goal apiece. 
Northern Michigan was able to capitalize on a Notre Dame turnover at the 12-minutc mark of the third for the eventual game-win­ning goal. The Wildcats added an insurance goal thrne minutes later for a 3-1 score. 
Saturday night's game featured much of the same back and forth momentum swings as Friday night's game did. Northern Michigan jumped on the Irish early, putting two quick goals on the board. [rish coach Dave Poulin then decided to pull sophomore goalie Tony Zasowski, in favor of senior Kyle Kolquist. Kolquist responded in kind, holding the Wildcats scoreless for the next 43 minutes or the game.

Meanwhile, Notre Dame chipped away at the Northern Michigan lead. The Irish got a goal from freshman Hob Globke with five sec­onds left in the first period to pull to 2-1. Notre Dame then got the equalizer by Aaron Gill five minutes into the third period. This set up a wild finish which left teams locked in a 3-3 tie. Ryan Dolder scored for the Irish with just 1:15 left in the third period to put Notre Dame ahead 3-2. 
Northern Michigan furiously fought back to scorn with just 45 seconds left to send the game into overtime. Neither team could score, and the game ended in a 3-3 tie. 
"We were disappointed with our perfor­mance this weekend," said sophomore left wing Michael Chin. "We have played a lot of good teams, and we have played well against them, but we haven't found a way to win. That is something we need to learn to do." 
There arc some bright spots for the Irish, though. Globke and Aaron Gill have been solid contributors since the beginning of the season. 
"The guys have been doing a good job ol' incorporating us into the system and treating us as they treat everyone el'ie," Gill said. 
In addition to the freshmen, Notre Dame has killed off 23 straight penalties in their past five games. The last time Notre Dame gave up a power play goal was on Oct. 27 against Michigan State. That is something the Irish ½ill need to continue to do to win some hockey games. 
Notre Dame will also need to outwork their opponents. 
"Coming off the BC game I felt good about the season," said Chin. "We outplayed them, but still lost. So we were hopeful [coming into this weekend's series against Northern Michigan]. The bottom line is we got out­played by Northern Michigan." 
Notre Dame will get to test its work ethic this weekend when it travels to Lake Superior State for a two game series with the Lakers. 
Player and senior captain Julie Norman joined Matha on the All-Tournament Team. 
"I think [Matha] is such a leader by example," said head coach Suzanne Smith. "She lays it all out on the court. She has really stepped up and played well." 
And lay it out she did. Matha led the team with a remarkable 23 points and 19 rebounds in Saturday's victory against Marietta. Although she only had four rebounds in Sunday's tournament championship, she did turn in 17 points for the Belles. Matha, however, con­tributes her title to her teammates. 
"There is no way I would have gotten [the title] without my teammates," she said. "It really reflects our team more." 
Following that performance, Matha was also named MIAA Conference play­er of the week. Norman also turned in a star performance at the Turkey Shoot Classic. 
During the Marietta game, Norman fouled out in overtime. Although she scored 14 points for the team, she was looking for redemption on Sunday. 
"With Julie fouling out, she was very frustrated," Smith said. "Sunday she was very determined to win that game." 
Norman turned in 19 points and nine rebounds on Sunday. The tournament championship pitted the Belles against the Lady Crimson of Oberlin College. The Belles and the Crimson traded the lead during most of the game. 
"It was close most of the game," Smith said. "It really came down to the last three minutes." 
In that last three minutes Saint Mary's pulled ahead, ultimately de!'cat­ing Oberlin and claiming the Turkey Shoot Tournament trophy. 
The Oberlin defense managed to keep Matha to only four rebounds, the first

were evenly matched. 
"They were a great penetrating and 
passing team," Matha said. "We stuck 
with it." 
The Belles were down most of the 
game, by as much as seven at one point. 
With less than one minute to play Saint

Saint Mary's stayed with Franklin for 
the first half and the game and Franklin 
had no substantial lead until the second

'They had a lot of depth and a lot of

The Belles will have a week off to 
recover before hosting a tournament 
this weekend. Friday will mark the first 
home game or the year and the Belles 
are looking forward to coming into it 
with a winning record. 
"Everyone expects us to lose," Matha

had a winning record in a long time."
