In the Philippines, police have detained 17 people in the killings of three Americans near Clark Air Base and await tests on weapons before deciding whether to file charges. At least six of those held are also believed to be rebels of the communist New People's Army. 11 of the 17 were picked up Tuesday in the Angeles City area, next to the U.S.-run base 50 miles north of Manila, and the others were arrested last week on weapons charges. Ballistics tests are being conducted on confiscated pistols to determine whether they were used in the Oct. 28 kilings.

A 6-foot ostrich on the lam in Oklahoma City caused quite a stir in Linda Alvarado's house. Alvarado's pooch first spied the bird near the house Tuesday and pursued it past her daughter's bedroom. The girl promptly dashed out after the flapping fugitive. The family terrier cornered 
the bird near a shed. While 10-year-old Graham covered the ostrich with his BB-gun, his parents called the sheriff's department, who responded: "We don't do ostriches, ma'am." Finally, after the Alvarados endured hours of guard duty, the ostrich's owner and a friend came by and literally bagged the escapee. -Associated Press Of Interest Saint Edward's Hall's academic commission will hold a talk by Professor Kevin Scanlon on "The Stock Market Crash: How Did It Happen? ...

Scholar series speaker offers views of art 
The Observer I Wen Vi 
By PRATIBHA TRIPATHI 
News Staff 
College of Arts and Letters' Distinguished Visiting Scholar Series brought anthropologist Alexander Alland, Jr., as the guest speaker to Notre Dame Tuesday and Wednesday. 
Alland discussed the evolu­tion of aesthetic behavior as a form of affective communica­tion in a lecture entitled ''The Role of Culture and Biology In Human Aesthetic Behavior" 
"Art is the accidental result of a series of evolutionary unr­elated adaptations each of which has adaptive sig­nificance in domains other than aesthetics," said Alland elaborating from his book "The Artistic Animal." 
"The fact that artistic behav­ior is built out of a grab bag of adaptive systems does not mean that art, once it emerges, does not have its own powerful adaptive value." Alland said. 
In his speech, the Columbia University professor discussed the emergence of aesthetic be­havior as the result of five majo.r human adaptations: en­vironmental exploration, play, attention to spatial configura­tion, ability for fine-grained perceptual discrimination, and the emergence of transforma­tive process , which is ex-the 90 days allowed for comp'li­

emplified in the linguistic metaphor. 
"Without metaphor we would have neither true language nor art," said Alland. "Metaphor is a basic characteristic of lan­guage in which, to use a metap­hor, new patterns arise from old cloth." 
The lecture attempted to in­tegrate, under the class of l coherent theoretical approach, a set of biological and cultural­historical factors in aesthetic behavior. Alland drew his con­clusions from his comparative research including a controlled cross-cultural study of drawing by young children in Japan, Bali, Taiwan, France, Ponape, and the United States. 
"Our results show that cul­tural differences appear very early in the kinds of drawing children do," said Alland. "The Active artist data show that, except for

ministration because officials saw the accord as a virtually cost-free way for Nicaragua's leftist government to win an end to American aid to the Con­tra rebels. 
Now, however, those fears appear somewhat exagger­ated, the officials say, adding that the Sandinista govern­ment is finding itself increas­ingly on the defensive and faces some extraordinarily difficult choices in the weeks ahead. 
The peace agreement was primarily aimed at ending Central America's insur­gencies through cease-fires and a process of national recon­ciliation. But fighting con­tinues in each of the three war­plagued countries--Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala­with little sign of an early settlement in any of them. 

El Salvador has held cease­fire discussions with leftist rebels with no progress re­ported. However, consistent with the requirements of the agreement, President Jose Napoleon Duarte is expected to announce a general amnesty for political prisoners. A par­tial, unilateral cease-fire may also be decreed in time for Thursday's deadline. 
Guatemala also has held direct discussions with leftist insurgents, but a settlement seems no more than a remote possibility. 
Central American leaders appear to recognize that the 90­day schedule for implementing the agreement was too am­bitious, and U.S. officials say the region's leaders now are looking to January as a more realistic deadline. Early that month, the five presidents are scheduled to review compli­ance with the agreement. 
The United States, while making its concerns about the agreement known to friendly Central American countries, is not a signatory and thus has assumed the unaccustomed role of bystander.

The survey will show if the image of the homogeneity of Notre Dame students is true, said Viz. "There are lots of preconceived notions (about students' attitudes)," he said. "You can 'guesstimate' how most of the students would an­swer by a knowledge of the people around you." He said the survey is not trying to prove or disprove these notions, but is just trying to see if they are legitimate. 
Viz said the key thing is that people return the surveys. "Only if we get a decent response can we really call it a legitimate survey," he said.

While the University wants to decrease the amount of cheat­ing in the classroom by imple­menting the Honor Code, Ger­lach also sees a dual purpose involved. "This is a device to help moral growth. In the real world if a lawyer witnesses un­lawful and unethical conditions existing to get a criminal off the hook, he has a responsibil­ity to say something" he said. 
The clause in the code which has stirred the most contro­versy is the Non-Toleration Clause.

Mabus, who defeated businessman Jack Reed by a margin of 53 percent to 47 per­cent in Mississippi, said his victory was a signal that the South is changing. 
"I think this is a new day for Mississippi," said Mabus, who campaigned as a crusader after a term as auditor spent investigating irregularities by county supervisors around the state. 
Julie Anbender, a Demo­cratic National Committee spokeswoman in Washington, called the election outcome "a good preview for 1988 ... We're extremely pleased. We had ex­pected the gubernatorial vic­tories that we won." 
Frank Fahrenkopf, chair­man of the Republican Party, cited Reed's showing and said, "Mississippi has not elected a Republican governor in 114 years, yet the Democrats were barely able to pull this one out."

Fahrenkopf called the results a "bittersweet suc­cess." But in his statement, he made no mention of the record landslide loss suffered by Har­per in Kentucky, and did not refer to his oft-repeated claims that a national political realignment toward the Republicans is taking shape in the country. 
Kathryn Murray, the GOP's director of communications, noted that Republicans had gained control of the Washing­ton state senate by winning a special election, held control of the New Jersey state assembly and expressed hope that Reed's relatively strong showing could assist the Republicans in their bid to win the seat being vacated next year by Mississip­pi's retiring Democratic Sen. John Stennis.

Malizzo, 43, was reported in serious condition. 
"They haven't seen the last of the Republican Party in Hobart," Malizzo said after his defeat Tuesday night. "We have to regroup now, evaluate the campaign, and maybe in four years, try it again." 
James Dayhuff, Malizzo's campaign manager, said the candidate began suffering chest pains at home. Barbara Malizzo, the candidate's wife, drove him to the hospital, where he was placed in the in­tensive care unit. 
Dayhuff said Malizzo's heart condition may have been ag­gravated by the campaigning. Marie Caldwell, Hobart Repub­lican chairman, agreed. 
"It was a very strenuous campaign, and he was going all the time. It's bound to be the cause of all the problems now," Caldwell said.

Defector to U.S.S.R. returns to States 
Associated Press 
FRANKFURT, West Ger­many-A U.S. army private who defected to the Soviet Union seven months ago returned to the West on Wednesday and said he would surrender to American authorities. 
Wade Roberts, 22, said he did not want to return to the Soviet Union but did not know if he would be going to the United 

States.  
Roberts,  who  flew  to  
Frankfurt  from  Moscow  
aboard  an  Aeroflot  jetliner .  

with his pregnant girlfriend, Petra Neumann, told Cable News Network in an interview that he did not expect to be charged with desertion. 
"I have a piece of paper from the United States Embassy that they gave me stating that the only charge that they have against me is for being AWOL," or Away Without Of­ficial Leave, Roberts told CNN. 
Roberts, who was assigned to a post in West Germany when he defected to the Soviet Em­bassy in East Berlin, said two weeks ago he was prepared to go home to face trial on charges of desertion. 
Since then, he had been in ~ontact with the U.S. embassy in Moscow trying to arrange his return to the West. 
Peter Arnett, CNN Moscow bureau chief, accompanied Roberts on the flight and said he was not met by any U.S. mil­itary officials at the Frankfurt airport. 
Roberts was declared AWOL from his unit in West Germany on March 2 and declared a deserter and dropped from the Army's rolls on April 2. 
Neumann, 24, helped Roberts slip across the border into East Germany in the trunk of a rented car in April. 
Roberts told CNN he decided to return and give himself up because of Neumann's preg­nancy. 
"I've got this child coming with Petra, and I really don't feel like I should go around for the rest of my life having a charge . . . from the United States hanging over my head," Roberts said.

House vote bans lie detectors 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The House voted 254-158 Wednesday night to impose a sweeping ban on the use of lie detector tests by most private employers. 
The House acted after reject­ing a substitute bill, 242-169, that would have allowed private polygraph tests to con­tinue under strict new federal guidelines intended to prevent abuses. 
Supporters of the ban, ap­proved and sent to the Senate after more than 10 hours of in­tense debate, charged that polygraph tests were unreli­able and constituted a threat to workers' guarantees against job discrimination. 
House opponents of the bill argued that polygraph tests are a valuable weapon against em­ployee thefts that cost business firms an estimated $40 billion annually. 
The ban, which was sup­ported by organized labor and civil liberties groups, would ap­ply to all private employers, al­though the House approved ex­emptions Wednesday for security guards at sensitive in­stallations and for drug com­pany employees with access to controlled substances. 
Federal, state and local gov­ernments also were exempted, as well as private contractors doing intelligence work for the government. 
The defeated substitute, sponsored by Reps. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., and George "Buddy" Darden, D-Ga., would have prohibited polygraph examiners to ask ir­relevant personal questions, and required that test results not be the sole basis for hiring or promotion decisions. 
The Reagan administration and the business community both opposed the ban on private polygraphs, which are ad­ministered each year to about 2 million employees and job ap­plicants.

Roe vs. Wade to fall as science grows 
Every abortion decision involves a conflict of values. The rights of the de­veloping unborn child are in conflict with the rights of the pregnant woman. Every physician who cares for preg­nant women is caring for two patients -the pregnant woman herself and the un­born child. The pregnant woman is fre­quently called upon to act in a way that is primarily oriented toward the wel­fare of her unborn child. She may be asked to optimize her diet, abstain from smoking or drink alcohol in moderation for the purpose of protecting her fetus. She may even be called upon to submit to procedures such as intrauterine transfusion or various fetal surgical measures to improve the condition of the infant without producing any direct benefit to herself. There is some dis­agreement about the ethical obligations of the mother in each instance, but few would claim that a mother may act with callous disregard for the welfare of the fetus. No one would claim, for example, that a woman is free to take Thalidomide during the first trimester of pregnancy. 
Eugene F. Diamond 
guest column 

The long tradition of legal constraints against the practice of abortion in the United States was derivative of English common law, operative in colonial times during the framing of the Consti­tution, and codified into laws of every state for over a century. This tradition was interrupted in 1973 by the Supreme Court in its Roe vs. Wade and Doe vs. Balton decisions. The legalization of abortion was based on a constitutional right to privacy, but it was contingent on a declaration by the Court that the pre-viable fetus lacked personhood. It should be emphasized that the Court was discussing "personhood" in the le­gal sense of standing before the Court. It was not considering personhood in a broader philosophical or metaphysical sense and, in fact, specifically pres­
cinded from a decision as to when life begins. 
The existence of biologically indepen­dent life in the unborn from the time of conception is supported by the follow­ing observations: 
First, human life can be made to begin under in-vitro conditions by the fertilization of an ovum by sperm. 
Second, the zygote and embryo thus produced are independently viable and not "part-of" the Petri dish or the 
uterus into which it will be eventually implanted. Third, criteria necessary for the def­inition of "life" rather than "death" 
(e.g. heartbeat, electroencephalograp­hic activity) are present in the first trimester. 
The unborn child has a unique depen­dency on its mother, but it will continue to be totally dependent on others long after it is born. 
The existence of life is intrinsic and demonstrable. The existence of "per­sonhood" is extrinsic and conferred by consensus, at times, arbitrarily (the Su­preme Court, for example, in the Dred Scott decision declared black slaves to be non-persons or chattel for purposes of the law). The Harvard Conference on Abortion, in both its ethical and medical committees, concluded unani­mously that life begins at fertilization. Expert testimony before the East com­mittee in the Senate regarding the beginning of life fell into two categories: life begins at conception (majority view) or when life begins is uncertain (minority view). 
If we conclude that when life begins is uncertain, we have a serious quan­dary. If we conclude that a human life or a human person does not exist until some arbitrary stage of life after con­ception (quickening, nervous system development, viability, or birth), we may feel free to carry out lethal measures against preborn individuals against whom we have passed this judgement. If we are incorrect, there is no remedy for the individual who has thus suffered a wrongful death. If, on 

.the other hand, we extend protection to all stages in the human continuum, we avoid the wrongful death without causing any injustice to the unborn in­dividual in the process. It has been cus­tomary in other contexts in the Amer­ican experience to act in favor of life where the existence of life is uncertain. When there is a coal mine cave-in, for example, we do not board up the shaft but rather we dig for suvivors. In al­most every instance we continue to dig even when we are morally convinced that the oxygen supply has been long exhausted. It would seem reasonable to act similarly with regard to the un­born child. That is, presume that he qualifies for protection unless and until we can be certain that he is not a live human person. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics, as a child advocate organi­zation, has identified an obligation to the welfare of the unborn patient: First, on page 52 of the Policy Reference Manual, an official Academy statement on the "Age Limits of Pediatrics" states that our obligation begins "in the period prior to birth when conception is apparent." Second, the Academy ac­tively endorsed and participated in the United Nations Year of the Child. The 

U.N. Declaration on the Child states, 
"The Child deserves protection from conception". Third, the Academy has endorsed the development of joint perinatal teams with obstetricians, fur­ther affirming its interest in the fetus as a separate individual. Fourth, various Academy members are deeply engaged in projects involving therapeutic procedures, both medical and surgical, carried out in-utero. It will be difficult to sustain the position that a fetus can be a patient and, at the same time, not a person. 
Recently, in San Francisco, an un­born child had surgery for an obstruc­tive uropathy. He was removed from the womb, operated upon and then returned to the uterine environment. Was he a person while outside the womb and then a non-person when he was placed back in the intrauterine environ­ment? Or, since the procedure involves removing only the lower half of the body from the uterus, did he achieve personhood for his buttocks but not for his brain? This is what the Supreme Court would have us believe. No wonder Supreme Court Justice Sandra O'Connor has stated that the Roe vs. Wade opinion "is on a collision course with itself." As science progresses the ridiculously reasoned legal status of the unborn child as a non-person will in­evitably collapse. Eugene F. Diamond, M.D., is a profes­sor of pediatrics at Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine. 
P.O. Box Q 
Pothole repairs an exemplary solution 
Dear Editor: 
Anyone unfortunate enough to have parked on Green Field in recent weeks can attest to the presence of enormous potholes. These holes often became swamps when it rained and probably could swallow whole a small Yugo with­out leaving a trace. Many students complained to each other, and assumed nothing could be done. 
In late September a committee com­prised of Student Senate members and Cabinet officers was formed to deal with short and long term improvements in student parking. On October 26, 1987 representatives of this conmittee met with Don Dedrick, Director of the Physical Plant. When Mr. Dedrick was informed of the condition of Green Field he said he would look into it im­mediately. By Friday, October 30th, many of the potholes had been repaired, although there are still holes where cars were parked. Mr. Dedrick assured us that Green Field would never deteriorate to that condition again. 
The members of this committee, on behalf of all members of student gov­ernment, would like to publicly thank Don Dedrick for his cooperation and concern. If the actions of Mr. Dedrick are any example, the administration has shown its willingness to discuss and act upon legitimate student concerns. We also would like to encourage any students who have a problem or idea to approach their representatives in student government. This is a perfect example of how students can work with Student Government and the Adminis­tration of Notre Dame.

Council volunteers are dedicate 

THERESA LOOMIS accent writer 
T
he Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Council for the Retarded has played an integral role in shaping the recreational pro­gram offered by South Bend's Logan Center. The Logan or­ganization satisfies various needs for the retarded commu­nity through Its pre-school, adult rehabilitation, and resi­dential programs. Ever since the center was founded in 1968, student involvement has centered on a Saturday recrea­tion program and weekly bowling. 
The council is led by co­presidents Dennis Hughes and Marie Mellin. Hughes says the council's main purpose is "to promote more social behavior in the clients." Their relation­ships in the community are broadened by bringing them Into contact with people other than immediate family and friends. 
Other goals include providing a therapeutic program in which skills can be developed, provid­Ing recreation in which relaxa­tion and cooperation can be learned, and promoting aware­ness about mental retardation by dispelling myths and misin­formed attitudes. 
The Saturday morning recreation program extends from 9 to 11 :30 a.m. and is held at the Logan Center. Lo­cated at 1235 North Eddy Street the site is within short walking distance from campus. These student run sessions are informal and Include activities such as singing, arts and crafts, and games. 

Clients taking advantage of this program vary in age, func­tioning ability, and back­ground. They include children and adults from Corvilla Home and the Northern Indiana State Hospitai(NISH), as well as others living in home environ­ments who attend Logan edu­cational programs or work at Logan Industries, a workshop employing 300 people in pack­aging, operating machinery, or cleaning. 
"'People go into this thinking they'll do a lot of giving, but they end up receiving. " 
Some clients are wheelchair bound or profoundly retarded while others have had fairly normal experiences but are learning desabied. 
Student volunteers have in­Itiated several new develop­ments this year. In the past, games and crafts tended to be geared toward lower function­ing clients. Now, however, proj­ects on both low and high levels are offered so that ail clients can participate and will be attracted to those better suited to their interests. 
Also this year, the higher functioning clients are being encouraged to work with children from NISH. In this manner the clients act as su­pervised volunteers them­selves. "Previously," comments Hughes, "some of the older clients formed separate little cliques. Now that they're in the capacity of 'teacher', they are more involved." 
Hughes feels that the Special Olympics, which was held on campus this summer, is one reason for the expansion expe­rienced this year. As a result of the visibility, more people are aware of the programs and are volunteering to help. 
Bill Thomas, Logan's liaison with the ND-SMC Council for the Retarded, agrees that the Olympic games have had a positive effect. "Increased gen­eral understanding of handi­capped people has been the biggest result in the communi­ty." 
Occasionally, the council or­ganizes special activities for Saturday recreation. For exam­ple, one Saturday the group visited a farm. The session was extended to 2:30p.m. and will include a picnic lunch. 
Other special activities in­clude field trips, overnight camping excursions to Mic­higan, Christmas parties, one home football game per season, and monthly theme dances at Logan Center. 
The volunteers always have a

party after these dances. Says 
Hughes, "The volunteers be­
come a social unit. The fact 
that we're friends positively 
affects the way we enjoy rec 
and the way the clients enjoy 
rec." 
Funding for the council's ac­tivities comes from many places. Half of the budget is derived from a trust at the uni­versity. The remainder comes from the Center for Social Con­cerns, Student Activities at ND and SMC. and donations from outside sources. Some of the special activities, such as the camping trip and dances are quite expensive. Commfnts Hughes, "Those are not small matters for us to operate." 
He continues, "We do a lot of financial planning, organizing, and training. We've been in­volved a long time and are an integral part of Logan's pro­gram. They couldn't offer everything they do without our cooperation. We enjoy a good reputation and recieve a favor­able response. That speaks well of us as a school and also of our student leadership. 
That's pretty impressive. It's 
not something every campus 
could boast." 
Generally, between 50 and 60 students volunteer each Sat­urday. Some Saturdays entire groups volunteer their time. Last year the football team and its head coaches, the hockey team, Shenanigans, and the Glee Club participated in rec periods at Logan Center. Fac­ulty, staff, and graduate stu­dents also contribute. 
However, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students are not the only volunteers. Students from Indiana University--South Bend and Holy Cross College, interested adults of the com­munity, and young people in­volved in local confirmation programs are active partici­pants too. 
Countless reasons exist for 
people's desire to volunteer 
with the retarded. Says 
Hughes, "When you go you can almost regress back to child­
hood. When volunteers see ad­
vancements in clients--changes 
in behavior or greater personal 
discipline--it's really amazing

and makes the program worth the effort. I know I'm helping when I see that they're able to Improve. I know that It works." 
"God brings the people he wants to volunteer. I try not to be pushy. We get enough people to keep the program running. If they e'l]oy It, they come back. It's worked well for 20 years. The clients think It's fantastic." 
Bill Thomas of the Logan organization also supports this sentiment. 'The students can serve the people on a more Individual basis. A lot of friendships are made--real friendships, something that carries over ... The volunteers and clients remember each other, even after the students graduate." 
Christine Hartman, a co­captain of the bowling program says, "They all love Notre Dame students because, every time they meet, the students are doing something for them." Client Ted Puchala Is a prime example. He Is known as "Mr. ND" because of his unbounded enthusiasm for ND football and his wide array of clothing carry­Ing the ND Insignia. He admits that singing the flght song Is one of his favorite parts of Sat­urday recreation. 
Volunteers for the bowling program meet In the lobby of Pasquerllla West at .3:45 p.m. on Friday afternoons and return by 6:00 p.m. They do the scoring for the bowlers but cheering Is just as Important. 
Paul 1\elly, the other co­captain, believes a neat aspect of Involvement Is that "people go Into this thinking they'll do a lot of giving but they end up receiving." 
All volunteer leaders stress the point that new volunteers are always welcome. Everyone 

How to buy sunken 
Associated Press 
NORTH MIAMI BEACH, Fla. ­Why dream about searching for treasure at the bottom of the sea or a ship that went down In a violent storm, asks Sidney Simon, when he has 18 such ves­sels for sale? 
"Even a scuba diver would have a ball with any of these," said Simon, who describes him­self as the "human dynamo of eastern Canada." 
The sunken or abandoned ships he owns, Simon admitted, will not produce gold and sliver treasures, but the 70-year-old businessman promises that, as salvage, they are worth a fortune. 
"Why search for the Republic when you can buy one of mine and go for the real cash?" asked Simon, referring to current ef­forts to salvage the 600-foot RMS republic that sank off Nantucket Island, Mass., In 1909 with an estimated $1.2 billion In valu­ables on board. 
Most of Simon's wrecks are In relatively shallow waters off his native Nova Scotia, having run aground or struck sunken reefs can flnd their own level of In­volvement. Volunteers do not have to promise any particular time commitment. 
Says Hartman, "We would never say 'no, you can't volun­teer enough time.' We can make use of time If you're will­Ing to give lt. If that means once a month--terrlflcl I have the most fun doing it. It's my hobby. I don't have any great 
between 1900 and 19.35. Al­
though some are broken In half, 
Simon claims they are mostly In­
tact. Some are partially visible 
from the surface. 
None of his ships are small, 
said Simon, a Canadian citizen 
who also has a residence here. 
They are mostly freighters, but 
he also owns what's left ofa 4 70­
foot hospital ship and a four­
stack World War !-vintage U.S. 
destroyer. 

There are only two conditions to buy one of his wrecks, ex­plained Simon, president of Trans World Slag and Metals Co.: "cash up front and only U.S. dol­lars." 
Records Simon has Indicate most of the ships carried coal, lumber or salt or were empty when they went down. However, some apparently carried general or unrecorded cargoes when they sank. Their value, he said, Is In scrap metal, flttings and en­gine parts he contends have been preserved by salt water. "And there's the copper tubing," he added with a smile.

said. "Just dig away the sand and cut the shaft and there's $50,000," he continued. "Someone could make a killing." 
Most of the ships were pur­chased from the Canadian gov­ernment or Insurance compan­Ies by his father, the late John Simon, and passed on to him In 1948. 
Simon also owns millions of tons of old white slag and coke breeze at two abandoned steel mills he has In Londonderry and Ferona, Nova Scotia. 
Slag Is a steel mill byproduct used to make building and In­sulation materials, asphalt, glass and for nourishing oyster beds. Coke breeze Is the residue of the manufacture of coke and used to make charcoal briquettes. 
Simon also speculates some of his ships might be refloated with the help of a large salvage ship. 
As to a price for any ofSimon's ships, he said, "Make me an of­fer. What's It worth to you?" The m<Uorlty of the ships would have to be bought sight unseen. "I couldn't see them either when I bought them," he said.

Sophomore is versatile 


Markovitz off to hot start 
By SEAN S. HICKEY Sports Writer 
"I'll help out wherever the team needs me... that's all I care about," said sophomore hockey player Kevin Markovitz. Markovitz dis­played his versatility against Windsor in the season-opening series last weekend. 
Against Windsor, a Canadian team, Markovitz contributed on both sides of the red line, tallying both nights as Notre Dame split the series. Markovitz finished the series with one goal and two assists. 
"Last year I played defense," said Markovitz, "and the coach started me at center last Friday night but switched me back to defense Saturday night." 
Markovitz is from St. Louis, Mo., where he played four years of varsity hockey in high school. He attended an All-Star national hockey tournament in his senior year where he con­sulted with Notre Dame coaches. 

"Basically I chose to attend Notre Dame with the idea of finding the best academic school with a good hockey pro­gram," said Markovitz. 
As a freshman, Markovitz had 22 points--18 of those com­ing on assists and four on goals. 
"One of the most thrilling moments for me was my first collegiate goal against West Point," said Markovitz. 
"Kevin is a clever stick hand­ler," says Head Coach Ric Schafer, "and a good skater. His stick handling skills will help us, especially on defense, to get out of the defensive zone more quickly." 
The next opponent for Notre Dame is Kent State at Kent, Ohio, a fellow American Col­legiate Hockey Association member. The Golden Flashes have gotten off to a shaky start thus far this season and sport a 3-7 record heading into this weekend's contests with Notre Dame. Kent State also has a new coach, Tom Viggiano, who, like Schafer, is returning to his alma mater to coach. 

Despite the competitiveness in the ACHA and the calibre of teams Notre Dame will play, Schafer is optimistic about the season. 
"I want to win the remaining 29 games and win the ACHA conference," added Schafer. "The team is hardworking, but we just need to eliminate a few mental lapses. If we can cor­rect some of those mistakes, I think we can get Notre Dame hockey back on track." 
Switzer closes in on Soc,ner win mark 
Associated Press 
NORMAN, Okla. -Oklahoma Coach Barry Switzer laughed at the audacity of the idea. 
"When you first started out," a questioner asked, "did you ever think about surpassing Bud Wilkinson's record?" 
Wilkinson is perhaps the school's most famous coach. And until this year, he had also been the winningest coach in Oklahoma football history. But now Switzer, in his 15th season, can pass Wilkinson if the top­ranked Sooners beat No. 12 Oklahoma State on Saturday.

straight points to take the match. The strong net play of Shea and senior Kathy Baker gave the Irish the momentum, while the hustle of White and Morin shut down any hopes for an Eastern Michigan com­eback. 
"Morin set a beautiful 
game," said Notre Dame head 
coach Art Lambert of the 
decisive fifth game. "The team 
was passing well and we played 
good defense in that game. 
Kathy Baker played well 
tonight and I thought Zanette 
Bennett had a good game." 
Notre Dame, 21-8, heads to 
Dayton tonight to face their 
North Star Conference rival. 
The Irish then return to the 
Joyce ACC Pit Saturday night 
at 7:30 to host Louisville.

Switzer enters the game with a 145-25-4 record. Wilkinson compiled a 145-29-4 mark in 17 seasons. Wilkinson won three national championships, and Switzer also has won three. 
''If I had said in my first year that I was going ·after Bud's record, you would have put me over·at Central State," Switzer said, referring to a Norman mental hospital. "You don't start out with those types of goals." 
Instead, he said, you start out by trying to establish yourself, to prove you are deserving of the position. Switzer wasted no time doing that. His first season, 1973, the Sooners went 10-0-1, with the only blemish a 7-7 tie to Southern Cal. 
The following year Okla­homa went undefeated and won the national title. In 1975, Swit­zer's third season as coach, Oklahoma went 11-1 and won another national title. 
In 1976, the Sooners stumbled just a bit, finishing 9-2-1. They came back strong the next four years, combining for a 42-6 record in those seasons and winning three Orange Bowl titles.

Bears resort to passing in come-from-behind contests 
Associated Press 
LAKE FOREST, Ill. --The come-from-behind victories they have pulled off the last two weeks might show character, but they are not characteristic of the Chicago Bears. 
Some of the guys in the of­fensive line are showing con­cern, and the Bears' chances of leading the NFL in rushing a record fifth time are in jeopardy. 
"We don't want to keep going through that, but sometimes it happens," said Jimbo Covert, a two-time All-Pro tackle, of the come-from-behind vic­tories that have forced the team to abandon its running at­tack. 
"We have to run the ball to be effective but you can't run when you're behind," said Covert. "We're becoming like San Diego. We have a good quarterback and good receivers, but that's not our characteristic. 
"As long as we're winning, it's fine, but we can't keep doing that," said Covert. "It's about time we win a toss and drive downfield and score." 
Since the strike ended, the Bears, behind quarterback Jim McMahon, have had to resort to the passing game for vic­tories of 27-26 over Tampa Bay and 31-28 against Kansas City. They fell behind Tampa Bay 20­0 and behind Kansas City 14-0 and 28-14. 
Center Jay Hilgenberg, also a two-time All-Pro starter, doesn't think falling behind puts any more pressure on the offensive line. 
But Hilgenberg rather likes the Bears' new image in which

SAN FRANCISCO -The defeat of a plan to build a down­town stadium means that the San Francisco Giants will be looking for a new home, club owner Bob Lurie says. 
"The Giants will not be in San Francisco," Lurie told a news conference after Tuesday's election defeat of a proposition that would have replaced Candlestick Park with an $80 million ballpark. "There are lots of cities across the country that are dying for the Giants." 
Lurie, whose lease on Candlestick expires in 1994, said, "I will be talking to a lot of different communities, starting in 1988. I'll consider anyplace that wants us." 
Not everyone believes him. 
Ex-San  Francisco  Mayor  
George  Christopher  was  
skeptical.  "I  don't  think  it  

means anything ..." he said of the Proposition W loss. 
"We have seen Lurie change his mind before and I don't think anybody believes that he would turn down a downtown ballpark if a site like Third and Mission were made available ... " said Dan Woodhead, pres­ident of the Downtown Bal­lpark Boosters Club, adding that there is plenty of time for

more negotiations on a new stadium. 
It has long been Lurie's con­tention that the Giants, tradi­tionally one of the worst teams in the National League in terms of attendance, would do far bet­ter if they played in a stadium that was not as chilly, windswept and inaccessible at Candlestick. 
"A lot of improvements have been made, but you can't put earrings on a pig," said Giants catcher Bob Brenly. "It's al­ways going to be windy and it's always going to be cold." 
But fans did turn out this past season, breaking all past records as 1.9 million watched the Giants capture the NL west title. 
Should the contributions fail, they warned, the city's hotel tax funds would be tapped, however.

game," Holtz said of Satur­day's Notre Dame-Boston Col­lege earlier in the week. "For the last year, it's all I've heard about any time I talk to some­one from that part of the country. It may not be for the national championship, but you'd never know that from the interest that's been shown." 
Whether or not the interest stems from the fact that anum­ber of Notre Dame students live in the Boston area, or the fact that the contest pits the two Division I Catholic football schools against one another, I'm sure the last meeting be­tween the schools has someth­ing to do with it. 
It was billed as the "Vatican Bowl." 
The 1983 Liberty Bowl was decided by the success and fail­ure of the placekickers after the six touchdowns scored. Boston College missed its first on an icy field, and then failed to convert on two-point at­
tempts  after  its  next  two  
scores.  
The Irish, meanwhile,  con­ 

nected on their first PAT and had the last two blocked. That one extra point and a 111-yard day by tailback Allen Pinkett were enough for a 19-18 victory over Doug Flutie and the Eagles. 
The only other time the two schools met, in 1975, Dan Devine rolled to a 17-3 victory over BC in his first game as head coach of the Irish.

This is getting to be a habit. And one Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz wants to break. 
No injuries as serious as the broken collarbone suffered by senior quarterback Terry Andrysiak four weeks ago against Pittsburgh have plagued the Irish lately. But nagging injuries to key players have made life difficult for Holtz in practice, al­though the results haven't shown come game days. And this week, nagging injuries have resulted in another decision for Holtz as to a starting quarter­back for Saturday. 
All-America flanker Tim Brown and starting quarterback Tony Rice were among a large group of players who missed practice Monday and Tues­day, only to return Wednesday. The pattern is get­ting ridiculous, and is making Holtz' weekly press conference every Tuesday sound like a broken record. 
"(The injury situation) is reaching a point where it's going to hurt us," Holtz said Tuesday afternoon, expressing concern about the number of players who missed practice Monday and Tuesday. Rice missed practice early last week as well, after suf­fering a mild concussion against USC. 
The list was a larger one this time, including Brown (broken left ring finger), Rice (ankle), split end Pat Terrell (ankle), defensive linemen Mike Griffin (back and ankle), Tom Gorman (illness) and Ted FitzGerald (ankle), and offensive linemen Tom Rehder (ankle) and Jeff Pearson (back). 
All but Pearson were back in action Wednesday, and the sophomore is expected to be ready for Sat­urday's game against Boston College. 
The players always seem to be ready by Saturday afternoon. And it's tough to second guess a 6-1 record against perhaps the toughest schedule in the nation.

But you've got to wonder how much the team's timing and chemistry (there's that word again) are improving when all those players are missing half a week of practice time. 
"It's hard to retain any kind of consistency when you don't have the right guys in there," Holtz said Tuesday. 
The Irish haven't started the same defensive line since the third week of the season against Purdue. Griffin, Jeff Kunz and Bryan Flannery had on the first-team gold uniforms in practice Wednesday. 
As for the quarterback situation, Holtz announced after Notre Dame's 56-13 thrashing of Navy that Rice was the starter and freshman Kent Graham the backup. But Graham filled in well Monday and Tuesday, and Holtz announced earlier in the week that the freshman might open up against the Eagles. 
"It's too early to say," Holtz said after Wednes­day's practice. The last practice before Saturday's contest is today, as the team watches game films on Friday. 
"Tony Rice was No. 1 coming out of last week," Holtz continued, "but he missed an awful lot of work. I think both will play, but I don't know who'll start." 
The quarterbacks split time with the first team Wednesday. 
A good week of practice usually means a solid performance on game day, Holtz said after his squad disposed of the Midshipmen this past Satur­day. 
Evaluation has been difficult this week. That's just another problem caused by the injuries. 
"You can't judge that just quite yet," Holtz ex­plained Wednesday. "It's hard to judge exactly what kind of week of preparation we're having. I think we'll play well, though. At least I hope we'll play well." 
"I can't believe the interest in this football
