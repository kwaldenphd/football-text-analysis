Who will start? 
Today's Quarterback Derby 
kY Beth Huffman Sports Editor 
One thing of which Purdue 
coach Jim Young was positive 
weeks before today's 52nd 
meeting of the Boilermakers 
and Irish was his starting 
quarterback, Heisman Trophy 
hopeful Mark Herrmann. 
··r think you're better off to 
have an established quarter­
back," said Young. 
One thing Notre Dame coach 
Dan Devine was unsure of 
weeks prior to this clash was 
who his starting general would 
be. 
"We don't think it's any big deal that we're not announcing who our quarterback is right now," Devine said. "We've got · four or five guys who can play." 
Likely candidates for the job 
include Mike Courey, Tim 
Koegel, the now-injured Greg 
Knafelc, and freshmen Blair 
Kiel and Scott Grooms. But time, chance and luck (or fate) often turn the tables. 
One thing the retiring Devine says he has been pos­itive of for days is who his starting quarterback will be. But he isn't telling. Informed sources indicate that Courey will get the nod. 
But days befort~ this after­noon's contest, Young became unsure of his starting quarter­back. 
Herrmann, the celebrated Boiler with an arm more precious than the Purdue "Golden Girl'' tradition, suf­fered a sprained right thumb in a practice session on Tuesday. The 6-5, 194-pounder from Carmel, Ind., the key to the experienced and explosive Purdue offense, was listed as "questionable" according to a spokesman for the university 

yesterday. Herrmann has not 
been throwing in practice, and 
Purdue trainers consider the 
injury an hour-to-hour, day-to­
day problem. 
Of course, Jim Young could just be ''playing games" with Dan Devine. Could Young be fighting fire with fire? 
''I don't know whether it will hurt or help Purdue to know (the qul:lrterback). It didn't help us last year against Michigan to have to wait until the first snao to find out who 
they were ·going to play," Devine said. "As long as it's not illegal, we're going to do any­thing we can to win. Ho~efully 
Purdue will have to spend some time preparing for di~ferent types of quarterbacks, plus a punter !,Kiel) who can throw the ball and run it.

The Polish Communist Party replaced 
the ailing Edward Gierek as part leader in that country last night, placing Stanislaw Kania in his stead. The announcement was made at about 1:30 a.m. (7:30 p.m. EDT), following an emergency meeting at the party's downtown Warsaw headquarters. The session began after it was announced tha Gierek, who had been under fire for is handling ofthe wave of strikes that swept Poland over the past several weeks, had been hospitalized with heart trouble. Similar labor troubles brought down Gierek's predecessor Wladyslaw Gomulka in December 1970. 
Marine Robert Garwood. who 
presently faces court-martial charges of desertion and col­laborating with the enemy in Vietnam, was arrested yesterday by the Onslow County Sheriffs Department and charged on two counts of felony child abuse. Onslow County Magistrate Margaret Murrill said Garwood was charged with attempt to commit sexual abuse by force against a 7-year-old girl. He also was charged with committing and attempting to commit a sexual offense on the body of the girl. Mrs. Murrill said both alleged incidents occured on or about August 7. Garwood was released under $10,000 bond. 
Members of The Who. fearing for their 
safety, slipped into Cincinnati yesterday to give depositions in 
lawsuits stemming from their Dec. 3 concert that led to 11 
deaths in a stampede offans at Riverfront Stadium. Lead singer 
Roger Daltrey, guitarist Peter Townshend, bassist John 
bntwistle, and drummer KenneyJones flew in from England to 
meet with plaintiffs' lawyers wednesday afternoon and all day 
yesterday. The band took great pains to avoid publicity, even 
using a decoy limousine. An attorney for plaintiffs estimated 
that 14 suits have been filed seeking more than $100 million in 
damages against the band, coliseum and concert promoters.

neglected to inform federal officials that between 300,000 and 400,000 gallons of water contaminated by radioactivity. is recorded as missing from its Dresden nuclear generatmg station, the Chicago Sun-Times said yesterday. Utility officials blame the water shortfall on faulty devices measuring the water supply, the newspaper said, and do not believe any water had leaked from the plant. Even if any leaked, they said, the radiation level would be below federal limits. But the newspaper said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not . ruled out a leak. "If you are losing water, that's bad," NRC project inspector Frank Reimann told the Sun-Times. "From what we know, there is between 300,000 and 400,000 gallons of water that apparently is missing. The question is whether this is a paper loss ofwhether there is an actual loss ofwater off-site." Unnamed sources quoted by the newspaper said the amount of contaminated water mysteriously disappearing from. the facility has been increasing for three years.

Saturday, tember 6, 1980-pase 3 
Let's go on with the show 


"An opening on Broadway can't compare to this," says Notre Dame Athletic Director Edward "Moose" Krause. "Our football opener is better than the celebration of Christmas, Easter or any holiday." 
Ah yes, the coming of autumn and the donning of helmets and pads­often referred to as the official be­ginning of the school year. Certainly a New York stage star would question Moose's claim, but nonetheless, Notre Dame's first home football weekend is the most active and most anticipated weekend of the academic year. 
The football season evokes a variety of emotions in people's minds and 
1 hearts. It is weekends of anticipation and excitement, of alumni and mem­ories, ofpartiesand rallies. But the first one-it's something a little special. 
For the players, it is a beginning and 
· an end. The season openeris the first of 11, and hopefully 12 games. Yet it also signals an end to the anxious anti­cipation, the sometimes tedious daily practice sessions which just two weeks ago were twice a .day, the countless team meetings and the cautious tackling of teammates as opposed to the real thing. Yes, much of this will continue through the season, but now the monotony will be broken each week or two. 
For the rest of the students, the 
I 
opener is-the event to which they geara 1 whole slew ofevents and activities. On 1 the Wednesday prior, there's the 
annual panty raid of the silk-seek.ing Notre Dame men scouring the six women's dorms on their campus and the five at St. Mary's. 
For the legi~ns ofgreen-clad alumni, this is the time to return and remember. "Brother, I hated this place. when I was here," belched one '72 grad yesterday, "but now you can't keep me away. It's great to pretend I'm a student again." 
For the freshmen, this is one weekend (make that one week) they probably will never forget. One Dillon Hall freshman said yesterday, "This 

has been one. unbelievable week ­
two days of studying and five days of 
partying -and I even managed a six 
on my E.q1il." 

On Thursday night, much of the · South Quad comes to life with the . annual Dillon Hall Pep Rally bol­
stering dorm and campus spirit. On 
Friday, the stereo speakers find their 
way into window bays blasting forth 
everything from "The Notre Dame 
Victory March" to "Rock Lobster." 

Contrary to common belief, football 
weekends (especially the first' one) 
aren't all fun and games for everyone. 
For administrators and stadium per­
sonnel, it's an amazingly hectic pace. 
Last-minute ticket arrangements, .pre­
game press conferences, post-game 
press conferences, catering to VIP's, clearing the cob webs from the press box and locker rooms -just part of the preparations. 

There are those who have been part of Notre Dame's opening football game for decades. Moose Krause's secretery, Eleanor Vanderhagen, has seen her share of Irish footbll games. "This is too early in the year to be doing this," she moaned about the early date for this season's start. But her frown quickly vanished. She must enjoy it if she's been doing it for 25 years. 
There have been some memorable openers over the years. All in all, the Irish own a lopsided 57-7-3 advantage in home openers, but that statistic has heen on the deeline in recent years. The last two times Notre Dame has kicked offthe season at home, it's been chalked up in the loss column. 
Upperclassmen should easily re­mmber the disheartening 3-0 loss to Missouri in Notre Dame's first title defense of1978. Thatgame was played in the sizzling South Bend sun and the temperature on the field soared to the 110-degree mark. The September 9 opening was then classified as the earliest ever for the Irish, but this year's clambake takes the cake not only for the host team, but for the Boiler. makers as well. 
In 1976, the Irish opened at home against Tony Dorsett and the soon-to­be national champion Pitt Panthers. National television cameras looked on as Dorsett and Company rolled over their hosts with wreckless abandon, 31-10. 
The last time the Irish managed a victory when they opened their season in Notre Dame Stadium, came back in 1973 when Ara Parseghian's squad clobbered hapless Northwestern, 44­
0. In fact, Notre Dame's last three home-opening victories came at the hands of the Wildcats. 
Ofcourse, this afternoon's game is a sellout, but it hasn't always been that way. The last time there was a seatto be had for an opening game in Notre Dame Stadium was in 1963, Hugh Devore's last season as head coach. The Irish opened against Wisconsin that year before .56,806 disappointed fans. The home team lost as the Badgers scored with just 1:07 to go to tke the 14-9 victory. 
Some of the old-timers can re­member the first game ever }J~ayed in the stadium. The year was 19 30, Knute Rockne's last season at the helm. In the season-opener, the Irish came from behind to defeat Southern Methodist, 20-14 before less than 15,000 fans. 

So today we begin again. Some 59,075 fans will be screaming, many students will be carousing, a few alumni will be crying, the band will be playing and hopefully, the Fighting Irish will be winning.

'Survival is the only glory in ~ar' 
The movie "The Big Red One" is a film that's at the right time and the right place. lt's a war film in the traditional sense. The Americans are portrayed as white-hatted, mother­loving good guys, while the enemy are shown as sinister, devious sorts, who probably entertain themselves by doing immoral things to Girl Scouts. 
"The Big Red One" is a movie from another age, made bv a filmmaker from another age. SamuelFuller-he was known as the king of"B" movies a decade ago-was responsible for a whole slew of hard-hitting, raw-edged melodramas like the previously men­tioned "The Steel Helmet", and "Merrill's Marauders". The past few years have seen Fuller inactive while he worked on a project he's planned for for a lifetime: a film documenting war solely from an infantryman's point of view. 
The film follows a quartet of young soldiers through their tour of duty. In this case their "tour" takes them from the beaches of North Africa, to sunny Sicily, on to bloody Omaha Beach, across Europe, and finally to 
tzechoslovakia Coincidentally, this exactly mirrors Fuller's own war ex­perience. The film's title comes from Fuller's wartime unit, the first infantry division, otherwise known as "The Big Red One". 
The principal characters you've seen before: a hog herder with hemorrhoids (Kelly Ward), a street-wise punk from the Bronx (Bobby Di Cicco), and the company sharpshooter who cannot kill (Mark Hamill). Heading the cast is grizzled veteran Lee Marvin in his best performance since his Oscar-winning dual role in "Cat Bellou". 
These men impress the viewer with their stark primitiveness. From the opening shot of the Sergeant on a ravaged W odd War I battlefield, to the final scenes of the still-warm ovens at Buchenwald, every old cliched melo­dramatic device is used to create superb effect. 
As an example, during the bloody Omaha beach scenes the camera focuses on the still-working watch belonging to a corpse, as it passes the minutes. The battle scenes have Panzers looming larger then life upon a pitifuUy defenseless infantry. 
With the current flap over draft regestration, the film's realistic and unglorified portrayal of the average foot soldier's life provides valuble insight-especially for those aged 19 or 20. The film transcends the normal one-dimensional image of the wise­cracking, heroic American G.l., and shows our principals living li~e in an emotional daze from one skirmish to the next. 

The characters insulate themselves from the stark reality of war by re­fusing to associate with the "replace­ments" (soldiers who replace those who are killed), because, in the words of Zab, "They came and died so fast; you couldn't know them." · 
The Germans are portrayed in a manner familiar to most viewers. Not only do they look like the Nazi thugs in 
"Casablanca" but they have all have the same charm of a moose in heat. 
The movie has many memorable scenes. For example, right after the Americans destroy a dia­bolical German ambush, a pregnant woman, who is suffering labor pains, appears. Thinking quickly, the troops clear out a tank ofcorpses, and deliver the infant inside the death-plagued tank shell. The troops restrain the helpless madame with rounds of machine gun ammunition. 
Further on, the company gets the assignment of liberating a Belgian loony farm from their German war­dens. As the troops blast the Nazis into hell, the assorted nuts calmly eat fruit loops and laugh at the violence. 

The film's most poignant scene, however, is saved for the end, when the principals liberate the horrible Nazi death camp at Buchenwald. Griff follows a sniper into an ominous 


Ryan Ver Berkmoes 

building with tall, still-puffing smoke­stacks. Finding a room filled with doors, he opens one to see the smoking remains of the last batch of victims. 
Stunned into a stupor Grif hears a sound from an adjoining oven and he peers inside to see his quarry. Grif overcomes all his restraints as he slowly and methodically empties his Ml rifle into the Nazi. 
Finally, the Sergeant finds a pitifully abused young]ewish boy. He attempts to restore the boy's will to live, only to have him die in his arms. 
As one leaves the theater, one is left with the feeling that they have justseen a movie made with care, a rarity these days. 
"The Big Red One" is doing sur­prisingly well at the box office to the surprise of the skeptics who said the public had outgrown Fuller's style of film. Fuller seems on his way. to becoming a cult figure of American film.

Harkenriders' the bset skilled freshman I've ever seen-a little Lovejoy-and Kevin's playing better than ever. We're going to be tough." 
Besides increasing the num­ber of forwards, Hunter also has altered their style of play. Co-captain Lovejoy, who could become Notre Dame's first soccer All-American explains. 
''In the past there were set positions. Wings would have to stay in their lanes; backs would have to stick to their assign: ments; everybody was entren­ched in his position. There was no freedom, no overlapping. But now we all have lots more freedom to move. We're encou­raged to use our imagination on offense. We're weaving, over­lapping, changing positions; even the backs are participating more. It adds a whole new dimension to our offense and should give us more open shots." 
More open shots may be just what the doctor ordered if the Irish aren't going to suffer through a frustrating season like last fall's. A year ago, the seven goalposts allowed its opponents across the midfield

line only three times and lost 1-0. It was a scene that was to be replayed all too many times for insh soccer enthusiasts, as Notre Dame lost seven of its ten setbacks by a single tally. However, Notre DAme oppon­ents need be more wary. 
Two weeks ago, Hunter re­leased his six forwards and new offensive strategy in a scrim­mage against Grace College. The result: a 13-0 massacre as each member of the sextet scored at least once. 
Now we know why Hunter wanted to keep things secret.

that last year's top player, Cindy 
Schuster, returns for her final

managed only a 7-11 record in 1979, and Hoyer handily won a confrontation between the two during the team's pre-season intrasquad tournament. 
''I'd like to play No. 1, but I won't be disappointed .if I don't," she says. "The impor-· tant thing is for everybody on the team to do well, because th_is year, to get to nationals, we have to qualify as a team." 
It took Linda Hoyer just one season to prove she belongs among the nation's elite. Now she'll try to help her teammates prove they they belong there, too.

Hunter leads Irish through times 
by Gary Grassey Sports Writer 
There has never been a moment in 
the three-year lifespan of Rich 
Hunter's Notre Dame varsity soccer 
team when there wasn't a new peak to 
climb or valley to leave behind. 
The ups have taken form in the guise of record winning streaks and me­morable clashes filled with national prestige reminiscent of traditional Irish giant-killings past; the lows have appeared sporadically under the head­ing of inconsistencies and humbling defeats that represent the squad's inexperience as much as anything. 
But the program grows stronger every day. The unpolished crew of misfits that once performed the rites of bump and bruise soccer as a club team have crawled slowly through the ranks of the N.C.A.A.'s Division I to the point where they now prepare to field a skilled, organized, confident group of ballplayers and coaches ready to make their first serious run at a post-season playoff bid. 
They've done it without scholar­ships, grants-in-aid, or anything else that resembles the notion 'free ride', and they keep getting better. 
"You know of we had full scho­larship players like some of the other schools-we could field an awesome team," says head coach Rich Hunter, who in addition to his teaching and law practice, continues on as the only coach the Irish have ever known. "But right now, we're really the only minor sport (at Notre Dame) that has been able to move up through Division I with our kind ofschedule. We play the best and we have a schedule that rates with the football or basketball team." 
Eight common opponents with Indiana's Top Ten-rated Hoosiers, including a match down in Bloomington with the Big Red, and dates with St. Louis, Penn State, and perennial midwest powers give cre­dence to the belief that Notre Dame's three-year track record of 5 7-14-3 is not just a bundle of routs over the Manchesters, Valpos and Monmouths of the soccer world. 
"When I was in high school," recalls Steve Miller, one of two remaining players from the club days and now a first-year law student in his final season ofeligibility, "it was a dream come true even to see St. Louis play. They are to soccer what Notre Dame is to foot­ball." 
Don't worry about the Irish taking off on any nostalgia trips when they meet the Billikens, however, because as Hunter explains, "We've really never played badly in our big games. Our problem has been that we play to the level of our opposition. We could beat Indiana one day and turn around the next day and lose to a nobody." 
The inconsistencies and lapses in concentration caused Hunter, his staff and players nightmares in the 20-10-1 season of a year ago. 
"Last year was supposed to be our year," says co-captain Dannie McCurrie, an MBA student playing out liis last campaign. "Things just didn't work out. People got hurt, the goals didn't go in-it was just a disaster.'' 
As much as Rich Hunter pleaded and, sometimes, screamed at his play­ers to turn things around, 1979 never became more than a disappointment. But it was an important lesson at that. 
"We had the players last year," feels senior Mike Mai, Notre Dame's all­time assist leader, "But we were a tea;n that didn't believe in ourselves. We killed Cincinnati (last year's season opener) on the field, but we didn't beat t..~em. We had trouble concentrating. This year we have more quality players overall, much more depth." 
The reason for the improvement comes from two sources. 
"Rich has his head in the game a lot 
more,'' notes Miller. "He's relaxed and 
.more sure of himself as a coach." 
"The coaching now is so much 
better,'' says Mai. "We're doing more 
constructive drills, ourspring practices 
and off-season work mean something 
now. The guys have a great attitude 
about coming. back in shape and 
improving skills." ,. 
''I'v(l always been pleased with 'the 
players' dedication," says Hunter, '::Yho 
until 1977 had no experience w)'lat­
soever either as a soccer coadi or 
player. "I feel much more confident 
with my coaching now. I've always 
worked towards being good at what I 
do and I feel my knowledge of the 
game and the players' knowledge is 
much better. Things are done nor­
mally now that we used to have to stop 
and explain in practice." 
That second factor probably finds its 
roots in the team's club heritage. 
-"Three or four years ago, Rich really 
had to work when we first went varsity, 
because if he gave up there wouldn't 
have been a program," Miller recalls. 
"And all along those long van rides to 
distant cities solidified a lot of friend­
ships-between the players and 
Rich." 
"There was always a real closeness on 
the team," says co-captain Oliver 
Franklin, the final remnant from the 
days of club status, "Rich spent so 
much time and energy and a lot ofthat 
rubbed off on us." 
Assistant coach Tom van Meter tells 
a story about maybe the best example 
of dedication to the Irish soccer team. 
"A key guy here isJoe Ciuni," he says. 
"Joe has had to work so hard to where 
he's at right now (captain and starting 
halfback). We were kidding him the 
other day about how he's progressed 
from ballboy freshman year to captain 
senior year. But he's done it and 
without the skills of a lot of the other 
players. Just hard work." 
"In our first year ofvarsity, we really weren't that good," Ciuni says, "But we just ran every team into the ground. The last two years, we haven't had that attitude, but the skills have gotten so much better. I think maybe the ex­perience of last year is making us have the attitude we've got this vear." 
Just how rar attitude will take the Irish in 1980 is difficult to forecast, but Hunter and his troops do believe they can reach the N.C.A.A. tournament come November. They might even sneak past one of those Top Ten squads. 
"We may get beaten," Hunter predicts, "But those kids will know they were in the .game.'' 
As for the future of the program, however, Hunter can only guess. "I think the kids realize we have the potential to be a very good team. But the future lies on them, not the athletic department (scholarships). I per­sonally think it's unjust for the u­niversity to provide to one ur another minor sports and not the rest, but we can't think about that now. 
The Irish may be just two or three scholarships away from greatness, but right now they'd sure settle for damn good. 
And that's something they can be. Right now. 

Notre Dame vs. Cincinnati 
Seeking to avenge last year's season­opening defeat, the Notre Dame soccer team travels to Cincinnat:j for a return grudge match with the B~arcats Sunday at 2 p.m. (EDT). . Coach Rich Hunter, coming offa 20­10-1 recurd in 1979, fields a veteran starting lineup. All-time scorer Kevin Lovejoy teams with Ed O'Malley ;.ind Mario Manta at the forward slots: Co-

by Paul Partridge Sports Wrtter 
It was rumored that Rich Hunter, as 
.coach of Notre Dame's "other" foot­ball team, was acting on a precedent established by another coach in the athletic department and likewise was refusing to name his starting forwards for Notre Dame's soccer opener against Cincinnati. After all, Hunter is, among other things, a practicing at­torney and any good lawyer will tell you that one can't go wrong if he follows a presiding opinion. 
But, luckily for this feature, when Hunter heard that the verdict on the quarterback case would be out by the time this article was released, he capitulated and relinquished this year's attacking sextet. Grouped in two waves of three, the sixsome includes seniors Kevin Lovejoy and Mike Mai, juniors Sami Kahale and Ed O'Malley, sophomore Mario Manta and freshman Ken Harkenrider. 
Although only three of this group will start, all will log considerable playing time in Hunter's multiple­player shuttle system. Who plays when and where will depend upon whom the opponent is. Ifa playmaker is needed, Mai or Kahale will be inserted. If speed's the thing, Harkenrider will be summoned. If aggressiveness is called for, O'Malley's name will be heard. If big guns are requested, bring on Lovejoy and Manta. 
Hunter will try to make things work by taking advantage of the wide range ofsituations his forwards can adjust to. With six quality attackers, Hunter can use their diversity to field a potent front line under any condition. 
Things weren't always so rosy for Hunter. At the commencement of the '79 campaign, Notre Dame was ba­sically a four-forward team, and when O'Malley broke his leg in the first half of the first game, the Irish quickly became a three-forward team. And it's not that they did a bad job, for Lovejoy, Mai and Kahale finished one-two-three in scoring but it took them awhile to realize that the 1979 season would have to be salvaged sans Ed O'Malley. 
."Last year we went into the season with set forwards,'.' explains Kahale. "It was going to be Kevin, Ed and myself: We all knew each other's moves and were confident as a unit. Then t:d got hurt so early. That threw us off guard. Mentally we weren't prepared to deal with that and we questioned our ability to score." 
While the forwards were trying to adjust to their loss, Notre Dame was shutout. twice en route to a 1-3 start. 
This year Hunter has insured the team against any losses. 
"There's no way one injury is going to shut us down this year," stresses the fourth year mentor. "We have six guys who are all pretty equal talent-wise and they\.;: shown they can adjust to work together. Their styles of play com­plement each other. And the offense now has the confidence to believe they'll score no matter who's hurt or who's in the game." 
O'Malley reiterates his coach's sen­timents. "We're playing with much more intensity this year. We feel like we have the talents to come back, like we're not going to lose. And we have so much talent up front. Teams think that they're going to be able to beat us by shutting down Lovejoy. Well, that's no longer true. Ifthey double team Kevin it'll just open things up for Sami and me or whoever else is out there. And all captain~ Joe Ciuni and Dannie McCurrie open with sophomore Steve Berry at the halfback posts. Sopho­more Mark Luetkehans is the up back, while Steve Miller, Phil Sweetser, and freshman Joe Holterman open as the fullbacks. Junior goalkeeper John Milligan returns in the nets.

With Herrmann as a big "if", Young will have to turn his team over to the number two Boilermaker quarterback. Fres­hman Scott Campbell, a native of Hershey, Pa., is listed on depth charts as Herrmann's backup. But, the 6-0, 188 -pound rookie will have to summon intense courage, ta­lent and authority from within if he is to master a powerful Irish defense. 
Considered to be the strong point of the Notre Dame team, the defense is led by stalwarts Scott Zettek, Steve Cichy, Tom .Gibbons and Bob Crable. The 
!entire Irish squad has been preparing to "get Herrmann", and a possible replacement could end up eating turf in Notre Dame Stadium should the hyped defensemen crack the Purdue offensive line. 
Should Campbell have to take the snap, he will have seven experienced seniors on the Boiler offensive squad to guide him. The most notable seniors are Bart Burrell, John Macon and Dave Young. The HerrmannYoung tandem has paired for many scores, but Campbell might have to sub­stitute in that pair if Purdue hopes are to remain alive.

mark, but Purdue seems to thrive on the thought of de­feating the Irish at home. The Big Ten power has tallied the most wins ever over the Irish in Notre Dame Stadium with nine. 
The rivalry has mounted to one ofgrave intensity, with far­from-cordial comments com­mon of late. 
"We've felt that in the past Purdue has played us looking down their noses," said Devine to the Big Ten Skywriters on August 28. "I think our players resent that Purdue has always played us feeling they were bigger, stronger and better conditioned. We don't scare Purdue. They believe they have better folks than we do." 
What do the Irish players think about Purdue? 
"For some reason we've a­lways had trouble with Purdue. We usually play them at the beginning of the season and they've questioned our endur­ance, and whether we're in shape," defensive end Scott Zettick said to that same bunch of journalists. "But the only way we can answer that is on the field. I don't know about any particular players, but I think the feeling has been in the air that they've accused us ofbeing in poor condition." 
All head coach Young could say about those insinuations

"When it (Playboy) came out I went to the store to get some orange juice and I saw it on the rack and I got it," Young said jokingly. "When I got home I saw they didn't have any tight ends at all so I didn't feel too bad about it. But my first initial attitude was to throw it in the trash. But then I said the heck with it, it's just a magazine. They didn't even have us (Purdue) picked in the top 20 so' I knew something was wrong." 
What are Young's sentiments toward Notre Dame, a team he said he really enjoys playing 
against? "I don't have anything bad to say about them because they're a good ball club. They get a lot of good talent up there. It It's going to be a physical game. We're just going to go up there ready to play football," said Young.

The Port Clinton, Ohio, na­tive with the California-girl looks burst upon the Notre Dame women's tennis scene last fall by winning 21 of 24 matches in the No. 2 singles position. She captured the Di­vision III state and regional titles in the second singles spot, and became ,the first 'Notre Dame woman ever to earn points at the AlA W national meet when she won her first two matches there. 
Hoyer got a tennis start as a nine-year old in Columbus, phio, mainly because Mark had begun playing a few months earlier. 
"I was a tomboy," she laughs. "I didn't play with dolls-I played with guns. And I did whatever Mark did." 
So Linda went to her father and asked if she could take lessons with Mark. 
"He said that he would let me start as soon as I could bounce 
he ball off my racquet 100 times in a row." 
That slowed up her budding tennis career, but only for a short while. Not long after she mastered the 100 bounces, her dad entered her in a tourna­ment. 
"I won the first match, the next girl defaulted, and the last girl had to default when she got a blister on her foot," she re­calls. "So here I was, nine years old, and going to the regional for 12-and-under. I got blown away in my first match, but it was a good experience for me." 
Linda didn't get blown away too often, though, and by the time she reached Port Clinton High School, she was ready for bigger challenges-like play­ing No. 2 singles behind Mark on the boys' team. She com­piled a 15-4 record but people at the school pressured her to switch to the girls' team after her freshman season. 
"It wasn't a very big school, and the people there wanted me to play on the girls' team be­cause they thought I could make a name for the school," she says. "At first I didn't like 
the i~ea, but after a while, I 
figured that it was probably 
better for me ifi wanted to play 
tennis at a universitv." 
So Hoyer ran up a" 68-3 mark in three seasons on the girls' squad, and began to look at different colleges. She narrow­ed the decision down to Notre Dame, William and Mary and Miami tOhio). · "It wasn · t really a hard choice," Hoyer says. "I had been down here sevefal times to visit Mark, and I really liked it. By then, Notre Dame was like a second home to me." 
She was forced to make up her mind without any coun­seling from Mark, though. 
"He was determined not to try to talk me into coming to Notre Dame," she says. "And sometimes that made me so mad. For a while, I almost thought that he didn't want me to come here." 
After deciding to enroll at Notre Dame, it came time to select a field of study. 
"I thought a lot about going into pre-med, because that's what Mark was in," she says: "I wanted to get that balance be­tween athletics and academics that he seems to have." 
She elected instead to give business a try, but she's still searching for that balance. 
"With tennis starting right away in the fall, there was a lot of pressure-everything hap­pened .so fast," says Hoyer. "That's one of the things I want to do this year, get that bal­ance." 
While she may not be quite living up to her expectations in the classroom, it would be hard to find fault with her perform­ance on the tennis court. But she tries. 
"I have to become more ag­gressive," ·she insists. "I think a lot of that had to do with the fact that I was a freshman last year, at least I hope so. I also have to hit my forehand better. I can do it in practice, but I don't always do it in a match. That's just a matter of confidence."
