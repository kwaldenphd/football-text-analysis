Theologians debate abortion issue 
Associated Press 
Notre Dame provided a rare Catholic forum Monday night for two prominent Catholic theologians to debate the Church's stand against abortion. 
"The issue, however con­troversial, must be dis­cussed, and there is no bet­ter place to discuss it than on a university campus," said Father Richard McBrien, chairman of the Notre Dame theology de­partment, who introduced the debaters. 
Daniel Maguire, a theol­ogy professor at Marquette University, argued the Church should reconsider its opposition to abortion in light of inconsistent thought throughout Church history. 
Father James Burtchaell, professor of theology at Notre Dame, said Catholics should instead heed a prohibition of abortion dating to the documents of 1st century Christians. 

Maguire said the abortion issue debate was one of the first such discussions to oc­cur in recent years on a Catholic campus. He thanked Notre Dame Presi­dent Father Theodore Res­burgh for allowing the event to occur. 
Notre Dame President­select, Father Edward "Monk" Malloy, attended the debate but did not speak. When Malloy was selected last fall to succeed Hesburgh this spring, Malloy said Notre Dame would remain a Catholic university which praises thoughtful theologi­cal conflict. 
"Honest debate is the only way to get this abortion bone out of Catholic throats," Maguire said. 
Maguire, who asserted his opposition to abortion in most instances, said "neit­her (Burtchaell) nor I is pro­abortion. "No one in their right mind is pro-abortion." 
Maguire, however, said no "clear and constant" anti­abortion thread can be found in the history of Church teachings.

Beirut kidnappers extend the deadline for killing hostages 
Associated Press 
BEIRUT, Lebanon-Moslem kidnappers said they would ex­tend their deadline for killing three American hostages and an Indian when the appointed time arrived midnight Monday "until further notice." 
A handwritten statement in Arabic signed by Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine described the decision as a response to plea& from the hostages, their families, Lebanese organizations and the Indian government. 
But the statement also said the group would retaliate for the "insult" made by U.S. Sec­retary of State George Shultz, who said the people of kidnapping-beset Beirut "have a plague." It did not indicate what form the action might take, or whether it could in­volve the hostages. 
The statement was delivered to the Beirut office of a Western news agency with a picture of Robert Polhill, one of the hostages. Polhill, frail-appearing and bearded, wearing a T-shirt and spec­tacles, was pictured looking into the camera with a faint smile. 
Hostage Alann Steen had said in an earlier message Monday that the hostages would die unless Israel freed 
400 Arab prisoners. He said the

Senate again defeats gay rights resolution 
By KAREN WEBB Copy Editor 
The proposal recommending that homosexuals be allowed to reserve rooms for meetings and advertise through Univer­sity media was defeated for the second time at Monday night's Student Senate meeting, when Student Body President Mike Switek again broke a tie by voting against the proposal. 
The senate also voted a second time to add a referen­dum to the upcoming student election ballot asking students to rate The Observer, and, in new business, voted unani­mously to accept a proposal outlining plans for the sophomore-sponsored Little Sibs weekend. 
The proposal recomending extended rights for homosexuals on campus was resubmitted in revised form by Student Senator John Gardiner. 
Gardiner said he resub­mitted the resolution because the new one is "clearer in that it separates formal recognition from the basic privileges of reserving rooms and advertis­ing through University media," adding that he thought the reformulation would be more agreeable to student senators. 
Another reason for resubmit­ting his proposal, Gardiner said, was the fact that more senators were present at Mon­day night's meeting than at last week's meeting. 
Student Body Vice President Don Montanaro presented to the senate flyers he said were circulated and were posted around campus Monday. The flyers carried the post office

lnterhall hockey fight leaves one injured, one suspended 
By REGIS COCCIA Assistant News Editor 
A fight during a Thursday night hockey match between Pangborn and Sorin halls left a Pangborn player with a slashed neck and resulted in the expulsion of a Sorin player from the interhall hockey league for the remainder of the season. 
Sorin Hall also has been placed on probation for the rest of the season as a result of the fight. 
Officials ended the game early in the second half, after a fight broke out which cleared both teams' benches. 
An Office of Non-Varsity Ath­letics official said the injured player, Pangborn's Brian Kel­ly, received 18 stitches in his neck, caused by a skate. Kelly was taken to the hospital by Notre Dame Security directly from the ACC. 
"One of the guys on our team checked one of their guys who was kind of small," said Sorin Athletic Commissioner Gary Smith. 
"I saw the kid get taken out on a stretcher and I heard he got 18 stitches in his neck," Smith said. He added that the game was called "about three to five minutes into the second half, probably about quarter after midnight." 
Said Pangborn Co-Captain Kevin Dolan: "I've seen worse fights, but that's the worst I've ever been in in this league." 
The NVA said the player in­volved in the fight will not be allowed to play for the rest of the season. "(Sorin player) Phil Marin was determined the aggressor and has been kicked out of the league," an NVA of­ficial said. 
Marin said he "just checked that guy." 
"They're mad about that," Marin said. "But I didn't start a fight with him. 
"He was moving the puck, I went after him and leveled him. Then the Pangborn bench cleared," said Marin. "It was my blade (that hit him), but I didn't kick him." 
If he did kick the player, Marin said, the player would have been hurt very badly. 
According to Sorin player Mike Moran, "There was a little bumping on both sides. In the first half, there was a little scuffle in front of the net. One of the (Pangborn) guys shoved his glove into the goalie's face. I was on the bench at the time." 
The injury to the Pangborn player occurred in the second half, said Moran. "I saw our guy trying to get away. Four guys were after him. The fight­ing was held up, but tempers were flaring," Moran said. 
"The guy with the cut in his neck was still pretty gung-ho about getting our guy. Every­one wasn't at fault. I'd say the majority was trying to break it up," he added. 
"The refs did the best they could, trying to break it up," said Dolan. "I know one ref was hurt himself. 
"It was uncalled for," Dolan said. "I'm sorry it had to come to this. I have nothing against them making some good hits, but it was a little cheap," said Dolan.

'Assassins' ban questioned in light of Friday night flicks 
"The philosophic underpinnings of such an activity are in diametric opposition to the reli­gious and philosophical foundations of this place." 
The associate vice president for residence life in a news article two weeks ago reiterated this statement, which was officially issued by mem­bers of the Senior Staff. 
Was he referring to pre-marital sex? Plagiarism? Racial discrimination? No, he was giving the University's reason for continuing the ban on the nation-wide "Assassin game," whereby one tries to eliminate opponents with rubber-tipped dart guns. 
Now I took only three cours,es in philosophy, so granted I may be a bit slow with regard to the metaphysics of rubber-tipped plastic darts. Still, I have to say I fail to see the connection between the Catholic philosophy this University has inherited from Father Sorin and proclaim­ing all participants of the Assassin game to be anathema. 
Let's consider for a moment "the religious and philosophical foundations of this place" which suddenly have become so important. Now without doubt this university probably does more than any other to commit its student body to a specific philosophy. If someone from the University of Madison of my home state were to visit, for instance, he would probably think he's having a bad dream about the Middle Ages. Still, when we start banning dart gun games on a philosophical basis, I think it's im­portant we investigate what exactly this basis is a bit critically. 
Go to the Engineering Auditorium, the Snite Museum or the basement of your own dorm to see a movie. For the most part, it is possible even Mother Theresa wouldn't blink at what's shown. But come ott, is a dart-gun game really that much worse than Psycho, The Exorcist, Scarface or Dirty Harry movies? 
I walked in on one flick called "A Nightmare on Elm Street," where a disenchanted chap with a set of overgrown steel fingernails was gleefully raking the flesh of teenagers who had been copulating at some pool-side party--only to explode out of the gut of some poor kid in a number of other scenes. 
Now let's be serious. How is that consistent with the religious and philosophical foundations of this university? Is someone going to tell me that St. Augustine would concur with the ban on plastic dart guns while winking at "enter­taining" films like this? 
Granted, administration offiicials were right in expressing concern if it is true that "we had

one student who suffered serious psychological problems as a result of the game," as they claim. But if a student can crack up from shoot­ing plastitt darts, don't you think it's possible some people may get some rather unchristian ideas from movies of the Texas Chain Saw Mas­sacre genre which are shown regularly here? 
Or let's take parties as another example. Now for the most part Notre Dame students are quite mature, holding gatherings with at the most a keg or beer cooler. But there are a few student bashes, which are not too difficult to find, where one feels one has been transported to the Roman Empire in the days just before it fell. How does one glance away from people puking and shriek­ing, puffing reefers and poking themselves with needles while denouncing a game with plastic darts? 
Now of course we had a thing called the sexual revolution and Woodstock and all that other wonderfully "progressive" sixties stuff. The legacy of this era will probably have to be ac­cep~ed until this country goes entirely down the 
dram. If one grants this, the University has no real choice in allowing these other events, one may argue. 
Nevertheless, invoking our "religious and philosophical foundation" as a basis to ban a game of tag is bringing some pretty big guns to bear (if you'll pardon the tastelessly militaristic expression). If we do this much, we must acknowledge other things we allow which are probably making Father Sorin do cartwheels in his coffin.

Former security advisor McFarlane fails in attempt to commit suicide 

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Former na­tional security advisor Robert McFarlane, who figured prominently in President Reagan's clandestine sale of weapons to Iran, was hospi­talized Monday for a Valium overdose that police were treating as an apparent suicide attempt. 
McFarlane ingested between 25 and 30 pills, said Detective Lauren Acquaviva of the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office. He said he did not know how many milltgrams were in each pill. 
Acquaviva said a police in­vestigation was routine proce­dure lifter a report of "an un­attended death or death attempt." 
McFarlane had been sched­uled to testify Monday before a commission investigating the Iran-Contra affair, according to published and broadcast reports. 
CBS News, quoting un­named, informed sources, re­ported that hospital officials believed the overdose resulted from a suicide attempt. CBS, citing unnamed friends of McFarlane, also reported that he had been depressed and emotional recently. 
But McFarlane's lawyer, Leonard Garment, said ''neit­her I nor the sources of the report can know what Bud McFarlane's intentions were." 
Garment called the story "the most irresponsible and obscene piece of sourcing and reporting I've heard of in my whole professional life." 
The lawyer said he had not talked with McFarlane since last Friday. But, he said, ex­perts on the drug believed it was virtually impossible to commit suicide with Valium. 
"Bud McFarlane has served his country long and faithfully, and never with greater distinc­tion than by coming forward and being the only one to give a full story, under oath and without access to a single page of his official record, of the Iranian arms sale," Garment said. "I am sure the country will simply wish him well."

In regard to the proposal to open Cushwa-Leighton library earlier on Sunday's, Burke SQid 500 more students signed the petition last Wednesday, bring­ing the total to approximately one-half the student body. 
However, the petition will not be presented to the Academic Council as previously an­nounced said Heller. "I am going to meet with Sr. Bernice Hollenhorst (director of Cushwa-Leighton Library). It will depend upon the results of the meeting whether or not the petition goes to the Academic Council." 
In other business, Mary Fis­her, judicial commissioner, an­nounced the proposals made by Security for security improve­ments. The proposals include better lighting, more sidewalks, and speed bumps. 
Rebecca Hetland, campus ministry commissioner, an­nounced that peacemakers, campus ministry, government club, and the women's studies club will sponsor Philippine Awareness Week Feb. 23-26. Activities will include lectures, a presentation on Philippine culture, and a eucharistic celebration in Regina Chapel. 
Burke also announced that the lecture series sponsored by student government will begin Tuesday Feb. 24 at 7 p.m. in

Registration for classes, li­brary hours, and security im­provements were discussed at last night's meeting of the Saint Mary's Board of Governance. 
Jeanne Heller, student body president, said she met with Teresa Marcy, assistant to the vice president, concerning the registration of Notre Dame stu­dents for Saint Mary's classes. 
There have been problems with students, particularly Notre Dame students, who go down the back stairs of Angela Athletic Facility, pull cards, and then wait in line, according to Heller. She said security will be tightened. 
"The only real problem has been with the theology classes. Teresa Marcy is checking to see if theology majors at Notre Dame get registration priority over Saint Mary's students," said Heller.

Group accuses Nicaraguan rebels of killing Sandinista sympathizers 
U.S. government with a pattern of gross human rights abuses that, to date, the Contras show no sign of curbing." 
Specifically, the report said the Contras "engage in selec­tive but systematic killing of persons they perceive as representing the government, in indiscriminate attacks against civilians or in dis­regard for their safety and in outrages against the personal dignity of prisoners." 
It added that rebel kidnap­pings of civilians have been widespread, apparently for the purposes of recruitment as well as intimidation. "A significant number of the kidnap victims are children," the report said. 
But the study also said that the Nicaraguan government, "as a matter of policy," engages in abusive interroga­tion tactics against prisoners, including psychological pres­sure and threats used to secure their confessions. 

The report said the judicial system in Nicaragua often is subject to political manipula­tion because of the close iden­tification between inves­tigators, prosecutors and JU'dtg

WASHINGTON-U.S.-backed rebel forces in Nicaragua carry out "selective but sys­tematic killing" of perceived Sandinista government sym­pathizers and routinely kidnap civilians, including significant numbers of children, a human rights group said Monday. 
The Nicaraguan govern­ment, meanwhile, although it generally respects the laws of war, mistreats prisoners, does not guarantee due process and has imposed unwarranted limits on press and religious freedom, the group reported. 
The 166-page study was prepared by Americas Watch, a liberal New York-based human rights monitoring group, on the basis of a series of fact-finding missions to Nicaragua last year. 
It is the lOth report by Americas Watch on Nicaragua since 1982 and covers from February to December 1986. 
Americas Watch, which of­ten has drawn sharp criticism from U.S. officials during its six-year existence, accused the Reagan administration of un­fairly portraying the Sandi­nista government in the most negative terms while turning a blind eye to abuses of the

rebels, known as Contras. 
"No attempt whatsoever is made to moderate such portrayals in the light of actual performance," the report said. 
State Department spokes­man Charles Redman had no comment on the report, saying department officials had not seen it. The administration's own annual human rights report, which assesses all na­tions of the world, is expected to be released in a few days. 
Americas Watch Vice Chair­man Aryeh Neier told a news conference the report did not specify whether the Sandinista government or the Contras were responsible for the most abuses. To take such a stand, he said, would tend to diminish the abuses of the side deemed less guilty. 
But the report leaves the im­pression that the most serious rights abuses were committed by the Contras. Last week, As­sistant Secretary of State El­liott Abrams, who has fre­quently clashed with Neier in the past, said the Sandinista government is carrying out a "reign of terror" on Nicaraguan citizens. 
The Americas Watch report calls for an end to U.S. funding of the rebels on grounds that such support "associates the 
the parent," he said. 
Notre Dame researchers report that only 6 percent of American Catholic paris­hioners support the practice of abortion on demand legalized by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1973. 
The University's continuing study of parish life showed seven out of 10 parishioners, 
however,  accept  abortion  to  
save  the mother's life,  or  in  
cases of rape or incest.  

Fewer than one in four parish priests surveyed accept abor­tion even under those extreme circumstances.

Coroner's report says Liberace died of AIDS 
Associated Press 
INDIO, Calif.-Liberace died of a disease caused by AIDS, the Riverside County coroner said Monday, reporting the results of an autopsy on the en­tertainer. 
Coroner Raymond Carrillo said he believed that an oppor­tunistic infection triggered by AIDS killed Liberace, who died Wednesday at age 67 in his Palm Springs home. 
"I believe the AIDS virus causes all these .... It allows all these microorganisms to develop," said Carrillo. 
The report contradicted claims by Liberace aides that he had not contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
That Liberace was suffering from AIDS was first reported on Jan. 24 by the Las Vegas Sun. The newspaper attributed the information to unidentified sources. 
Denise Collier, a spokes­woman for Liberace, said Liberace had pernicious anemia, heart disease and em­physema. 
On Jan. 26, publicist Seymour Heller had said Liberace's anemia was caused by a two­month, weight-loss diet of noth­ing but watermelons, although Liberace's Las Vegas physician later disputed that. 
Dr. Ronald Daniels, a physician who treated Liberace, reported the cause of death as cardiac arrest due to heart failure brought on by sub­acute encephalopathy. This means the heart stopped due to a gradual loss of the heart's ability to pump brought on by some chronic problem in the brain. 
Riverside County officials refused to accept the death cer­tificate signed by Daniels when they discovered the coroner had not been contacted as re­quired in the case of_ possible contagious diseases, and be­cause a doctor wasn't in atten­dance when Liberace died, Carrillo said. 
Coroner's investigator Sabas Rosas said if proper procedure had been followed, it wouldn't have been necessary for his of­fice to hold a news conference on the cause of death, offending Liberace's fans. 
"It's too bad it went to this extent," said Rosas. "If protocol had been followed the way it should have been, it probably wouldn't have ended up where we're at. 
"We're doing our duty under 

the law. We owe it to the public we serve. The mortuary had an obligation to notify us," Rosas said. 
Medical records showed that before Liberace's death, the entertainer tested positive in January for the presence of an­tibodies to the AIDS virus, Rosas said. 
A positive test means only that a person has been exposed at one time to the virus and formed antibodies against it, and not necessarily that the person was still infected with the virus or actually developed acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

U.S. atomic weapons system called largest existing target for Soviets 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The U.S. atomic weapons command sys­tem has become one of the larg­est, as well as one of the most important, targets for a possi­ble Soviet strike, according to a book published Monday by Harvard and the Brookings In­stitution. 
An attack on any of more than 1,500 key points in the sys­tem might be misinterpreted as an attack on the whole, trig­gering a devastating American response, said Ashton Carter, a Harvard professor who helped edit the book and con­tributed two chapters. 
"The distinction between in­itiation and retaliation would probably become blurred," Carter told a news conference at Brookings, a liberal re­search institution in Washing­ton. 
The book, "Managing Nu­clear Operations," finds good and bad in the intricate sys­tems devised to manage super­power nuclear arsenals. 
The good news, said con­tributor Donald Cotter, is that in 40 years of handling nuclear arms, neither the Soviet Union nor the United States has acci­dentally launched an intercon­tinental ballistic missile or ex­ploded a nuclear bomb by mistake. 
Yet Cotter, a former assis­tant secretary of defense, ex­pressed concern that "techno}­

ogy opportunities rather than an overriding strategy drove the acquisition" of nuclear forces and the systems to direct them. 
The bad news, and the heart of the issue, the book says, is that although the weapons can be tested underground without breaking treaties or endanger­ing lives, the operating sys­tems cannot be tried out in con­ditions resembling war. 
More bad news is that the 750­page book, written by 22 gov­ernment and academic experts who are supposed to under­stand nuclear issues, raises more questions than it answers. 
One of the editors, John Stein bruner, who is director of foreign policy studies at Brook­ings, likened nuclear manage­ment systems to a giant ma­chine with thousands of gears and parts, which has never been tested. No one knows how, or even whether, it will work. 
Another contributor, Paul Bracken, wrote that the super­powers have not woven ideas on how to end a war "into the fabric of military organiza­tions." 
That could exacerbate two possible wartime problems: breakdown in communications between U.S. and Soviet leaders or breakdown of com­munications between the leaders and their own nuclear forces, wrote Bracken, a Yale professor. 
"You have to make sure that the weapons designed to deter war do not start one," said Steinbruner, who heads the foreign policy program at Brookings. 
While the Soviet Union and United States have avoided the brink of nuclear conflict, the book said, several events have highlighted the slippery edge. 
Mter the death of Kremlin leader Leonid Brezhnev in No­vember 1982, the Soviets waited four days before naming a new general secre­tary. U.S. officials are still not sure who was in charge of the Soviet nuclear arsenal during those four days, and they fear that, given Kremlin problems in transferring power, the lines of control might be confused in a crisis. 
In 1983, the Soviets shot down a Korean airliner, killing 269 civilians, including 61 Americans, after the civilian plane entered Soviet airspace, flying over sensitive military areas. The Soviets said they thought it was a spy plane, and Western powers were left won­dering about the reliability of Soviet detection systems. 
In August 1984, Soviet Pacific Fleet Headquarters flashed a war alert to ships at sea to prepare to engage U.S. forces in combat. The false alarm again shook the West.

Conversational dolls introduced at toy fair 
Associated Press 
NEW York-Once upon a time, dolls just sat there and looked pretty. Then they wet, they talked, and they walked. Now they hold conversations with each other without a child even being in the room. 
At the 84th annual American International Toy Fair, which started Monday, manufac­turers unveiled animated talking toys that not only com­municate with each other, but "understand" what a child says to them and respond with an appropriate answer. 
Also introduced were high­tech action figures that will take electronic cues from sig­nals beamed by new animated TV shows. 
Manufacturers are hoping such toys can enliven the rela­tively flat $12.5 billion toy mar­ket. 
Rick Anguilla, editor of the trade publication Toy and Hobby World, said, "We see the area of growth in true interac­tive toys--not just toys that have something to say and ran­domly say it, but those that al­most seem to think and can have real conversations." 
Put two Talking Cabbage Patch Kids ($100 a piece, retail) in a room and press the buttons on their stomachs. They'll sense each other's pres­ence and begin chatting. 
Th~y may discuss ice cream­-some are programmed to like vanilla, others chocolate or strawberry. Children can join in the discussion too, of course. The new dolls know what's 
Labor market spawns need for office day care 
Associated Press 
An increasing number of child-care programs are likely to be instituted by employers who want to keep experienced staffers on the job, a new study says. 
"In the future, tight labor markets will make it harder to replace experienced female employees who leave work to start a family," says "Juggling Jobs and Babies: America's Child Care Challenge," a report by Martin O'Connell of the U.S. Census Bureau and David Bloom of Harvard Uni­versity, published Monday by the private Population Refer­ence Bureau. 
In the years since the end of World War II, women have flooded into the labor market, a development which has con­fronted millions of families with the dilemma of finding care for small children, accor­ding to the report. 
Today more than half of married women with children under age 6 are employed, compared with only one in eight in 1950, Census Bureau statistics show. 
Responses to this develop­ment have varied from family to family and region to region, with some employers initiating programs to provide their workers with child-care pro­grams. Such actions will be­come increasingly important, says the study. 
Some women can hire help, but most domestic workers do going on around them. Take them for a bumpy car ride and the doll might say, "OK, that's enough. All this bouncing up and down makes me dizzy." Kiss the doll's cheek, and it'll say, "Thank you for the kiss. May I have another one, please?" 
Worlds Of Wonder, the com­pany that introduced the animated talking Teddy Rtix­pin, now has come up with Julie. 
Unlike past dolls that shot out random phrases with little relevance to what a child said, Julie has more than 100 sound­activated responses in her computer chip memory. 
She recognizes voices and words. When she hears some­one say he or she is hungry, Julie will respond, "Let's eat." Take her into a dark room and she'll ask, "Can you see OK? it's kind of dark." The doll can even be trained to only respond to its owner's voice. 
Yes, there is a limit to the dolls' intelligence--they only react to specific words or stimuli. 
The next step in interactive toys are those like Axlon's "Tech Force" ($250 for a dual­control set). As Tech Force characters battle evildoers in a television show, their toy counterparts will charge around the living room floor firing laser lights, in response to inaudible signals sent via the cartoon's soundtrack. 
The developers say such toys will make television watching participatory, instead of merely reactive. 
less than half the housework 
and "husbands are not much help either," with the majority of them doing less than one­fourth of the housework, the authors of the study said. 
Women have been seeking jobs in a market wit:'l a surplus of labor, during a time in which the children of the post-World War II Baby Boom flooded the market. But that will end in the 1990s as the smaller "Baby Bust" generation comes along and there are more jobs than workers, according to the report. 
This means companies will have to compete for experi­enced workers, and the result of this will be increased incen­tives to create such programs as child-care, said the report. 
In addition, pressure for more child-care programs will also be created by other recent trends such as delayed childbearing and the high divorce rate, according to the report. 
Meanwhile, "lack of affor­dable child care is probably preventing many poorly ed­ucated and low-income mothers from working at all, when they are the women who need jobs the most." 
Even after labor becomes more scarce, however, "most employers will need coaxing by federal, state and local govern­ment to adopt progressive child-care policies," the report contended.

captors would not reconsider the death verdict or extend the deadline. 
"We will be executed at mid­night" Steen, 47, of Boston, said in the letter to his wife. It was accompanied by notes to their wives from the two other kid­napped American college teachers. 
"Until then if you do love us and your hearts beat for us, put pressure on Israel to show good will. Let Israel promise the or­ganization (of the kidnappers) to show good will," Steen wrote. 
"Let Israel promise the or­ganization plainly and offi­cially that 400 Palestinian mujaheds (holy warriors) will be free. Otherwise, we won't be alive after midnight." 
The statement at midnight said the kidnappers found' 'cer­tain positive points" in remarks by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel about their demand for the release of Arab prisoners. 
"We want the fastest clarifications on this subject," it said, without elaborating. 
Peres said Monday in Jerusalem that Israel had not received a request from the United States to free the prisoners, and that "Israel won't take any initiative on its own." 
He declared on Sunday, however, that Israel was will­ing to discuss trading Arab prisoners for an Israeli airman shot down in Lebanon. 
The kidnappers' midnight statement also said its retalia­tion for Shultz' comment about Beirut would "deter everybody from daring to attribute his own cancerous diseases to the others." 
Shultz said in New York Sun­day that the "people of Beirut ... have a plague there and they're isolating themselves from the world and the world should isolate them." 
Steen's three-page letter was delivered 8 hours before the kidnappers' deadline to the Beirut office of a Western news agency with a photograph of Steen. 
It implied that an Israeli promise would suffice and that the 400 prisoners would not ac­tually have to be released Mon­day. 
In Washington, the Reagan administration position, as ex­pressed Monday by both White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater and State Depart­ment spokesman Charles Red­man, was once again to rule out concessions to terrorists. Both men said Washington has not approached Israel on the kid­nappers' demand. 
Steen's wife, students and of­ficials of Beirut University Col­lege, where Steen anq fellow educators Robert Polhill, Jesse Turner and Mithileshwar Singh were abducted two weeks ago, authenticated Steen's hand­writing. 
Steen is a communications instructor; Polhill, 53, of New York City, lectures on account­ing; Turner, 39, of Boise, Idaho, is a visiting professor of math­ematics and computer science; and Indian-born Singh, 60, ale­gal resident alien of the United States, is a visiting professor of finance. 
The three-page letter was delivered at midafternoon to the Beirut office of a Western news agency with a photograph of Steen, 8 hours before the death deadline. 
He warned the United States against attacking Lebanon "so that the lives of American citizens don't become jeopar­dized."

box number of a group calling itself the Gays and Lesbians at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
The flyers were not legally stamped by the Office of Stu­dent Activities, he said. 
"I know for sure there's no way the Office of Student Af­fairs is going to allow (the group) any privileges" if it was responsible for the fraudulantly-stamped flyers. 
Gardiner said he received much support for his action on the proposal that he submitted last week. "All week I've received positive responses from students. I haven't received any negative response.'' 

Others objected, including Switek, who said, "I've received a lot of positive response on my action last week. 
"Their needs are already being met as it stands now and I don't see the purpose in as­king the administration to make an exception like this," he added. 
Student Senator Brian Holst urged the senate not to consider the proposal on the basis of whether or not the administa­tion is expected to pass it. "We can't be afraid to not support it because we're afraid the ad­ministration won't approve it," he said. 
When a movement passed to end discussion and vote on the proposal, Switek broke a tie by voting against it. 
Debate also continued on the proposed referendum to elec­tion ballots asking students to rate The Observer. Holst moved to add other questions to the referendum so as not to single out The Observer for criticism. 
"I don't think it's instructive 
as it is. I don't see a reason to 
insult them," he said. 
Gardiner suggested that the questionnaire be more posi­tively oriented. 
Switek, however, said staff members of The Observer weren't at all adverse to the proposed questionnaire rating the paper. 
When a movement was 
passed to vote on the proposal, 
the senate voted to keep the 
questionnaire as it stands on 
the ballot. 
The senate also voted with 
unanimous consent to accept a 
proposal as it stands for Soph­
omore Little Sibs Weekend. 
Dan Ripper, representative for 
the project, spoke to the senate 
on the proposal. 
"We've tried to do something 
remotely like this in the past 
three years, but there were 
problems with the administra­
tion. And the proposals, with 
the exception of last year's, 
weren't particularly thought 
out," Ripper said. 
Student Senator Pat Cook 
added, "It was tried before on 
a campus-wide scale and from 
what I understand there was 
mass confusion. There were 
tremendous problems." 
Ripper said the present pro­
posal and plans for the 
weekend are the product of 
committee research into the 
problems of the 1983 program 
and of interviews with rectors. 
"A wide majority were in favor 
of the program," Ripper said. 
"Students will be very care­
fully registered or the siblings 
won't be allowed to participate 
in the program," he said. 
''The student is going to have 
the responsibility for every ac­
tion the sibling takes, and in 
that way we can keep the prob­
lem of siblings getting out of 
hand to a minimum," Ripper 
explained. 
Restrictions on registration 
include a maximum participa­
tion of 150 siblings under the 
age of 15, and registration on a 
first-come first-serve basis 
subject to rector approval. 
Cook said that by contrast 
only 700 of the 900-1200 siblings 
who participated in the 1983 
program were registered, and 
the program as a result "was 
way out of hand." 
He said if the program runs 
smoothly this year, it can ex­
pand in the future.

Violating approved laws lessens public's trust 
Turn on the T.V., it's there; open up a magazine, it's there; why even page through the "Observer," it's there too! The "Iran-Contra" issue is everywhere. Unfortunately, most people have 15ecome so desensitized by this torrential flood of information, that they merely gloss over the "black and white" or disregard it all together. 
Jerry Duff 
guest column 
Are "we, the people," no longer in­terested with the knowledge explaining what our elected chief executive is doing for us. It would seem to me, that this information is probably paramount if not equal in importance when com­pared with headlines reading: "X" Died Doing "Y," Can Notre Dame Pull Off the Upset, or Will the Bull Market Continue? Furthermore, the media, for the first time in six years, has finally refused to buy another bottle of Ron's "snake-oil." They will settle for no less then "the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth." 
Why do they smell blood in the water? What makes Reagan's current stunt any different from the other ones he has pulled on the American public. TRUST! Integrity in a "rule of law." 
Take the Libyan bombing episode last spring for example. Reagan in­titiated the whole confrontation when he decided to declare us the world "terrorist-policeman." He manip­ulated the American public by "draw­ing a line" he knew the Libyands would cross. When they crossed it, he had "no choice." Either retaliate, or renig on his word. The best choice would have been to never "draw the line" by shut­ting his mouth, but the point is that he did it all out in the open. 
The "Iran-Contra" connection, however, was conducted under the (NSC) table. Our National Security Council (Purely an advisory agency), was not only formulating foreign policy, but executing it as well, without the approval of Congress. While carry­ing out these clandestine operations, at least two major laws were broken. First, the sale of weapons to Iran clearly violated the letter and intent of the Arms Export Act, which strictly prohibits the sale of arms to countries supporting terrorism. I imagine that Iran is £2 or £3 on that list. Second, there is no question that the use of monies, generated from the sale, to fund the military overthrow of the

Nicaraguan government violates the Boland Amendment, which was effec­tive through October 1, 1986. It stip­ulates that no military aid may be sent to the Contras in excess of the amount set by Congress. 
Beyond breaking the law, the "Iran­Contra" issue raises a very fundamen­tal question about our own rule of law: Is the president above the law? I agree that Lieut. Col. North, Mr. Reagan, and any others involved are innocent until proven guilty beyond a shadow of doubt. Unfortunately, the excuse the "I did it for all the right reasons," isn't going to wash as a shadow of doubt. Take me for example. If I go rob a bank and give the money to the needy and the hungry, I go to jail just the same. Why should the rules be changed for President Reagan or anyone else for that matter? Has the "Declaration of Independence" ideal of equality been rewritten to read: ''All men are created equal, but some men are more equal than others." Our country was founded on the basis of a supreme rule of law applying equally to all people, not being changed for one person merely because he broke it for the right reason. 
The other common rational given in defense of Reagan's "Iran-Contra" policy is that he didn't know. Again, I will resort to a simple analogy. If I am driving down the highway at about 80 mph and the state trooper pulls me over, the line "I didn't know the speed limit," isn't going to get me out of a ticket. As many people may remember from driver education "Ignorance of the law is no excuse." The same prin­ciple is at work here with respect to the president's responsibilities and duties. 
The key in both cases, however, amounts to the degree of accountability "we, the people," expect from the pres­ident. He was elected by us, in order to serve us. He does this by executing the laws enacted by Congress, with in our own rule of law, the Constitution. While executing these laws, he must ul­timately delegate authority to numerous subordinate administrators for the sake of effectiveness and effi­ciency. Regardless of this delegation of authority, the president is still solely responsible for any action taken by the subordinates as well as himself. If these policy initiatives and actions are carried out in violation of approved law, then the president has stopped ser­ving the American public. Whether the president knew about the specifics be­comes irrelevant because he is still solely responsible for overseeing the

execution of the law. 
With the "Iran-Contra" incidents at hand, President Reagan claimed that mistakes were made. These mistakes amount to giving in to terrorist demands completely by trading weap­ons for hostages. We criticized the French and other European nations for "cutting deals" with terrorists in the past. Now they turn to us and ask, "isn't that kind of like calling the kettle black?" We want to stop terrorism, so we send the terrorists more weapons. Hmmm, makes sense, right? It's just a simple mistake. It also builds a lot of credibility with our allies, doesn't it? On the international level, more than just mistakes were made, trust in the United States has been lost. The "Iran­Contra" issue has made an utter fiasco out of our foreign affairs policies con­cerning terrorism. 
From the international perspective it becomes evident that more than just a law was broken. "We, the people," deserve more of an answer from our president than "Mistakes were made." Until he is candid enough to give us the full explanation, we must rely on the sixth sense interpretation of "the sharks."

Responsible majority ~ able to end disrespect 
Dear Editor: 
Shame, shame on you Notre Dame! 
Despite a 50-year love affair with 
Notre Dame in general, its athletic pro­
gram in particular, I find it increas­
ingly difficult and embarassing to 
watch a Notre Dame game. 
The actions of the student body 
during and after the North Carolina 
game reached a new low in bad man­
ners and boorish behavior. 
Since the football team's victory over 
Ohio State in 1935, Notre Dame has 
more than its share of spectacular vic­
tories, including the '70 Cotton Bowl, 
'73 Sugar Bowl, '75 Orange Bowl, '79 
Cotton Bowl, '83 Liberty Bowl and 
numerous upsets of number one ranked 
basketball teams by Coach Phelps' 
squads. Thus, we cannot use the excuse 
that the novelty of the experience 
validates unconscionable behavior. 
According to reliable sources, much 
of the irrational behavior was 
premeditated by some, at least quasi-, 
official body, who put cardboard mis­
siles and racial and obscene written 
chants in the hands of juvenile minds 
who reacted predictably when given the 
opportunity to demonstrate "new" 
Notre Dame spirit. 
The follow-up of food fights and glass­
throwing at the evening meal gives fur­
ther proof that the Notre Dame student 
body mocks the claim that they are in­
telligent adults and should be treated 
as such.

Equally distressing, as the actions of the 6th man at the game, were the TV interviews aired the next day and the Observer sports columns. 
Only Chris Bowler, the managing editor of the Observer, had the courage to express that the great victory of the basketball team was considerably marred by the actions of the "fans." 
Not one of the students interviewed on TV expressed any remorse about student behavior. All seemed to reflect the general attitude that as long as you win, anything is acceptable. 
I have sorrowfully witnessed over the years a breakdown in sportsmanship directed at opponents, officials and even our own players and coaches. 
In the not so long ago, when some idiots managed to circumvent the ad­mission standards of Notre Dame, we had two rather effective deterrents to handle their case. 
One was the Prefect of Discipline's Office, who would have had the first toilet paper thrower on the next vehicle out of town. 
A second enforcer would have been the responsible students, who I still feel are the majority, implementing the traditional lake treatment for those who embarass the rest of the student body. 
Since it is unlikely the administration will resume their rightful role in the administration of justice, perhaps the responsible students would resurrect a tradition that would be very effective, especially this time of year.

Hiler said disagreement exists over the need for an­other air craft carrier for the Navy. 
Weinberger said each air craft carrier costs $1.8 to $2.0 billion. 
The administration also is asking for $600 million to cor­rect problems which have emerged in its new BIB strate­gic bomber. 
The BIB and the "Stealth" Advanced Technology Bomber are viewed by the administra­tion as important parts of fu­ture U.S. defense posture. 
The extent of the BIB's electronic, flight control, radar and missile-launching equip­ment problems is a matter of debate; however, the its sup­porters admit serious problems exist. 
Weinberger also noted the Air Force would consolidate some units used for non-nuclear con­flicts. The move was made to reduce costs, but critics say nuclear weapons are consum­ing an Increasingly larger role within the Air Force at the ex­pense of conventional forces. 
Officials at the Pentagon are quick to note that substantial efforts have been made to prevent defense contracting fraud and cite the Packard Commission and the creation of new purchasing oversight procedures. 
"The horror story effect, " as Andrlcos calls it. In most cases involving contract fraud, Andricos said it is defense auditors who discover the abuses and correct them. 
Weinberger defines the budget as making, "substantial allocations, after a couple of years of drought, to research and development, and invest­ments in the future so that we can try and make sure that we have applied the latest and the best technology to the people in uniform who defend us." 
He also noted the United States

T 
he Soviet threat has b~.en the main concern of the United States and its allies since the end of World War 11. 
"The Reagan administration has adopted a peace through strength approach. They ~ry to bring the Soviets to agree to agreements by this approach," said U.S. Congressman John Hiler, D-lnd. 
"The Soviets must believeo that it is their interests to negotiate. They must be per­suaded that the United states is dynamic, and that the Congress is not going to negate our ideas," said Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Frank Gaffney. 
He said, "History has sugges­ted that when we have superi­ority, the Soviets are anxious to negotiate anything to restrain us until they can catch up. 
"If they do not believe we are willing to take the necessary steps, then there is little to believe they will negotiate an arrangement. 
"That's what we have started after the president's speech in 1983. (The Soviets) are, in some respects, farther along than we are in laser work, in some of the directed energy physics, and some areas be­cause of the technology they have stolen from us. 
"But they do not have and they are not ready to deploy, so far as we know, a truly stra­tegic defense system. A strate­gic defense system would be a very effective, thoroughly reli­able (system) that would block and destroy missiles before they hit targets on earth. 
"We are getting close to the point where we would even be able to deploy such a system," Weinberger said. 
Weinberger says the Soviets have already violated the ABM Treaty, and does not see why the United States should be held bound to a strict interpre­tation of it. 
Assessing the Soviet threat 
Missile Production 
USSR and NATO' 

Critics state the Reagan ad­ministration is overexaggerat­ing the Soviet military threat. 
They cite the administrations suggestions that the Soviets were ready to invade Iran. 
"The invasion of Iran would be an exceedingly low­confidence affair for the Soviets -a fact that I believe they have known for roughly 40 years," wrote Joshua Epstein, research associate at the Brookings In­stitute, in his just-published book, "Strategy and Force Plan­ning --The Case of the Persian Gulf." 
"The purpose of arms control is not an end in Itself, but a means to an end. Arms control must enhance our security. There are cases in which weap­ons systems enhance that se­curity without lending them­selves to arms control," said Gaffney. 
"We hope to move the Soviets 
from popularly-seductive 
proposals to those that can be 
verified," said Gaffney. 
"The issue of verification is a 
real problem," he continued, 
"but even if there were not 
testing verification problems, as there are, the United States ·could not stop testing as long 
the safety of our allies required 
these weapons." 
Gaffney said the administra­
tion wants arms-control agree­
ments that are constructive, 
creative, and verifible. 
The coordinated policy which the administration developed to flght the spread of Soviet influence is known as the "Reagan Doctrine." 
This doctrine calls for U.S. support of the anti-communist insurrections in Nicaragua, An­gola, Afghanistan, and Cam­bodia. 
"The Administration has been consistent in implementing the Reagan Doctrine," said Hiler. 
Fred Smith is the deputy as­sistant secretary of defense (acting) for policy analysis in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, International Security Affairs. 
"Low intensity conflicts," Smith said, "refer to the con­flicts in Africa, Asia, and in­dudes insurgencies. This is the most difficult type of conflict because it is difficult to reach a consensus." 
Smith said Central America is the most publicized, but least understood region of the globe. 
He said the administration pursue the "Four D's" in this region. 
The first is "democracy." 
"In this regard, we are tremendously encouraged. In 198L 16 totalitarian regimes existed. Since 1981, 1 0 of these have made democratic transitions," said Smith. 
"In 1979, the last year of the Somoza regime, there were 7, 000 Nicaraguan troops. Today, there are 75,000. Then, rlicaraguan had three tanks; today, 150," said Smith. 
"Compared to the inventories of other countries, Nicaragua has far more tanks and weap­ons than they need," Smith said. 
The second goal is "develop­ment." 
"For every dollar in security assistance, the United States sends four dollars in economic development. The root cause of revolution is economic tur­moil," siad Smith. 
The third goal is "dialogue." 
The Contradora document, signed by 12 foreign ministers with only Nicaragua refusing to sign, Smith said, is a testament to the dialogue the United States has promoted in Central America. 
The final goal is "defense." 
"These offer areas could not develop wUhout a security shield," said Smith. 
"If there is any success story of the 1980's, it is El Sal­vador," said Smith. "While not all of the problems have been solved, President Duarte deserves a great deal of credit. The human rights abuses have stopped," he emphasized. 
The Middle East, though, poses different problems for American foreign policy ex­perts, Smith said. 
"In the Jran-Traq War, the official policy is that we are neutral. We don't want a victory by either side. If Iran loses, greater instability and Soviet involvement is possible," Smith said. 
Smith noted the United States does not have diplomatic relations with Iran. "Iraq would settle the war to­morrow, but as long Khoumeini is around, we prob­ably won't see any change," Smith said. 
Smith also defended the ad­ministration's policies in the Middle East, but called for "a disclosure of what's happened" in the Iran-Contra affair and "taking positive steps to see that it does not happen again." 
"I hope (the Iran-Contra 
revelations) won't have any af­
fect at all," said Defense Secre­
tary Caspar Weinberger on the 
DOD's proposed $312 million 
budget for fiscal year 1988. 
"Neither of them affect the moral of the military and they don't reduce the threat against the Soviets," Weinberger said. 
But Hiler said, the credibility of the administration's policy on terrorism has been damaged. "The administration had made a great deal of prog­ress until Iran. It's going to have to get its credibility back," said the Indiana congressman. 
Regarding the administra­tion's fleet movements in the Mediterranean of recent weeks, Hiler said he didn't know the full details of the U.S. show of strength off Lebanon. 
Hiler said, "It was probably to send a signal to Iran not to get out of hand. 
"There is some saber-rattling going on. It is difficult to un­derstand what the purpose was."

Approximately 2.3,000 people log over 200, 000 phones call per day there. 
The Pentagon Is the one of largest oflce buildings In the world. 
The Pentagon Is headquarters of the Depart­ment of Defense which Is headed by a civilian Secretary of Defense. 
Since 1981, the head of the DOD has been Caspar Weinberger. 
On the other side of the

headed by George Shultz. 
The two men are different In 
but share the same goals. say DOD aides. 
Weinberger, said a young Pentagon Intern, who Is spend­Ing her time analyzing video tapes of his public remarks, Is "much cooler than George Schultz." 
Weinberger never gets flus­tered and he handle reporters very well, she said. 
Recently, the two men and the departments they represent have been viewed as at odds over many Issues concerning 
U.S. foreign policy. The New York Times ran a front-page story Monday with Shultz by quoted as contradicting Weinberger on deploying ele­
ments of the Strategic Defense 
lntiatlve. 
DOD officials, however, deny 
the conflicts exists to the 
degree portrayed In the press. 
"It's overblown," said Fred 
Smith "We work very closely 
with the State Department. We 
work on a day to day basis with 
the State Department. There's 
alot of cross-Information. Mili­
tary officers work In all of the 
bureaus of State," said Smith. 
Much of the confusion con­
cerning the position of the two 
cabinet officials results, DOD 
aides say, from the complex 
crosscurrents which charac­
terize Washington, D.C. 
And DOD aides think Congress will be much more willing to support the military proposals than some critics think. 
"In an average year, Secre­tary Weinberger appears before congressional committees about 20 times," said Mike Andricos, special assistant to the assistant secretary of Defense (legislative affairs). 
"We send 16, 000 to 18, 000 papers ofjustification to the Hill per day," said Andricos. 
"When we work with Congress, we have to take the time to explain the details," said Andricos. 
With so many people and so much paperwork. there are bound to be some communica­tion problems which lead to press stories of disagreement. said a DOD aide.

Munchy Co. gets approval but won't resume operations 
By JEFF HEILERT Business Writer 
After two months of negotia­tion with the University admin­istration, the three founding members of the Munchy Company have received Uni­versity approval to continue operation. But the long delay has made the venture un­profitable, according to the founders. 
The Munchy Company is an on-campus delivery service which provides a wide range of snack foods, according to Robert Very, one of the founders. 
Very said the problems the company encountered, which began after only a week of op­eration, stemmed from the dorm rectors who felt that the Munchy Company was compet­ing with their own food sales. The administration sent a sur­vey to the rectors who voted unanimously to end the compa­ny's competition with dorm food sales, according to Very. 
At this point, John Goldrick, associate vice president for residence life, requested a written proposal from the Munchy Company explaining their entire plan of operation, said Very. 
The three members of the Munchy Company then carried on discussions with the admin­istration regarding their plan. 
The day before Christmas break, the company received a letter from Goldrick which stated that approval was granted to the Munchy Compa­ny, said Very, but ten restric­tions were listed. 
These restrictions included that the Munchy Company had to have an office outside of their residence hall, send let­ters to all distributors explain­ing that the Munchy Company is not a University enterprise, and aquire two insurance policies to cover inventory and liabilities. Frank Angelle, also a company founder, said these insurance costs amounted to about $60 per month. 
After receiving this restricted approval, the found­ing members decided against operating this semester. "After making all the initial in­vestments, the Munchy Com­pany would begin making money at about the time we graduate," said Very. 
Therefore, the three founders said they are looking to sell the company to a group of younger students either this year or next year. 

The Observer is now recruiting tor the following positions:

Office space is still available in LaFortune Student Center for the company to use, if it is started up again by potential buyers. According to the Munchy Company, the buyers would be able to begin opera­tion in about a week. 
Angelle said, "Phone order­ing is the big market area for the future. Customers enjoy the convenience of delivery." 
The purchase price of the Munchy Company is negoti­able, but the original members want a percentage of the profits in the future. Very said, "We still want to be part of the com­pany; it is just unfortunate that we are seniors."

Computers don't solve everything 
The last few years have been filled with a lot of talk about how great computers are. They've been compared with everything from geniuses to Men of the Year. INC. Mag­azine, on the other hand, has made a list of what the miracle machines can't do for you: 
 A computer will not solve broad prob­lems that are poorly defined. The user has 
Alex VonderHaar 
Business Bits 
to understand exactly what problem he wants the device to solve. 
 
A computer can't save money by elim­inating workers. "The cost of automation is rarely offset by reduced payroll expenses," said Tom Christo, a New Hampshire attor­ney. Instead, computers can create new ways of doing things, such as moving out invoices and payments more quickly. 

 
A computer won't clean up errors made by hand. This goes back to the GIGO rule. If you put Garbage In, then you're going to get Garbage Out. "Computers are fast and accurate," said Richard Raysman, another lawyer. "But if you give them bad informa­tion, they'll get you into trouble much faster than a manual system will." 


 
A computer won't do short-term sales forecasting. It is able, however, to look at longer term historical trends and make predictions from these. 

 
A computer cannot solve problems that call for subjectivity. For example, compan­ies who hire on campus probably won't use a machine to fish from a stack of resumes. If they did, an important question would remain unanswered: Do we like the appli­cant? 

 
A computer won't solve all your schedul­ing problems in production. "You have to come up with the details," according to an educational director at one dealer. You have to tell it, for instance, how long it will take for a shipment to arrive. 

 
A computer's software will not accept changes made by amateurs. This one is for those of you who are planning to rely on your friend, the ace hacker. If you want your plumber to wrench around with packaged software, "There's always a reaction to changes and you never know what it's going to be," comments Christo. 


 A computer won't always be right. Sys­
. terns can produce errors, for example, when circuitry is faulty or when programs aren't fully debugged. John King, a leading re­searcher, points out that "before you get de­pendent on the system, you'd better make sure it works."

WASHINGTON -The Stars & Stripes crew brought the America's Cup to the White House on Monday, where Pres­ident Reagan ribbed a trium­phant Dennis Conner as the first man to lose sailing's prized trophy and praised him as the first to win it back. 
A beaming Reagan and skip­per Conner hoisted aloft the 136-year-old, ornate silver prize as Conner's 11-man crew and Vice President George Bush looked on. 
"Today the cup that went Down Under has come back up," Reagan boasted of the Feb. 4 recapturing of the trophy Conner lost to Australia in 1983.

All-Star sub Chambers winds up game MVP 
Associated Press 
SEATTLE-In the beginning, Pat Riley didn't have to worry about his starting lineup as coach of the West squad for the 37th NBA All-Star game. 
Until Houston's Ralph Sampson injured his knee last week, and NBA Commissioner David Stern chose the Seattle SuperSonics' Tom Chambers to fill in. 
So Riley was faced with start­ing one of the original reserve players, or Chambers-the only All-Star from the game's host city. 
He chose Chambers. 
The upshot was a delighted Kingdome-a game-high 34 points for Chambers and recognition as the game's Most Valuable Player. 
"Starting Tom was a great coaching move," Riley jokingly said after the West beat the East, 154-149 in over­time Sunday. "I didn't want to be booed in front of 40,000 fans before the game started. 
"I could have done things dif­ferently, but Tom showed for himself and for the Sonics today," added the Los Angeles Lakers coach. 
The 6-foot-10 Chambers hit 13 of 25 field goal attempts, in­cluding two of three 3-pointers. He had 27 of his points after halftime. He also pulled down four rebounds and had two as­sists. 
The only players to score more points in an all-star game were Wilt Chamberlain, who had 42 in 1962 and Rick Barry with 38 in 1967. Chambers' 34 equaled George Gervin in 1980 and Julius Erving, who played his final All-Star contest Sun­day, in 1984. 
"Today I'm the best in the world," Chambers said. "It's unfathomable, me, Tom Cham­bers, can be that. It means everything. It's just a tremen­dous thrill. I'm as excited as I can be." 
He also gave credit to Dallas' Rolando Blackman, who sent the game into overtime with a pair of free throws with no time left in regulation play and was runner-up for the MVP award. In the overtime, Blackman and Chambers each scored four points as the West won for only the second time in eight games. 
"My award wouldn't have been possible if Rolando had missed one of those free throws," Chambers said. 
Blackman returned the com­pliment: "He's a great player," he said of Chambers. "He's a devastating type player who can blow out a game for you." 
The game was fun for the other players, too. 
"It was magic," said Magic Johnson. "It was just so sweet. This was by far the best game. It was the Doc's (Erving's) last game. We came back from 12 down in the last seven minutes. The hometown hero was the MVP. What more could you ask 
for?" 
Johnson may be able to take at least part of the credit. He and lsiah Thomas held a quick summit at halftime, deciding on plans to pick up the tempo in the second half. 
"That first half was kind of boring," Thomas said. "We wanted to raise the game to a higher level. We wanted to make the place electric. Bring it to the top and let it bust." 
They did, including one wild stretch in the fourth quarter when the teams combined for 13 points in 1 minute, 9 seconds. 
"Everything was happening so fast. It was like we were in a whirl," Johnson said. 
Chambers' performance may help erase a reputation for being a one-dimensional player interested only in scoring. On three occasions Sunday, he was on the floor scrambling for loose balls. 
"I hope this brings me a little bit of respect," said Chambers, now in his sixth NBA season. "I also hope it gives the Seattle SuperSonics a little bit of respect, too." 
Chambers credited Johnson, who had 13 assists, for direct­ing the West's comeback vic­tory. 
In voting by a national sports panel, Chambers had eight votes and Blackman six. Moses Malone of Washington had one. 
"It's always been my dream to play on the same team with Magic Johnson," Chambers said. "It was everything that I Seattle's Tom Chambers was named the MVP West won in overtime, 154-149. dreamed of." in Sunday's NBA all-Star Game in Seattle. The

Grace defeats Dillon, 3-1, grabs Blue Division lead 
By ORLANDO RUBIANO Sports Writer 
With a little less than a month left in the Interhall hockey season, only two teams still remain unbeaten and untied. 
Defending Interhall cham­pion Grace is now 3-0 after defeating a tough Dillon squad last Thursday night at the ACC rink. Later that night, Pangborn (2-0-1} beat Sorin, 6­0, in a game that was suspended in the second-half due to a bench-clearing inci­dent (see related story, page ll. 
But in the Grace-Dillon con­test, after a fairly evenly played first-half which saw no scoring, Grace turned it up a notch in the final period to reg­ister a 3-1 victory. 
Grace had a power-play op­portunity in the first-half, but could not cash in. Several scoring chances by Dillon also came up empty, due in part to the goaltending play of Grace's Gary Davis. 
"Gary was able to stop several of their scoring oppor­tunities which was a big lift for our guys," said Grace captain Jim Rataczak. 
Grace's Drew Spesard got the game's first goal early in the second period. Spesard was in front of Dillon's goal when he knocked home a loose puck that had rebounded off Dillon's goalie, who stopped Steve Bis­hop's initial shot. A few minutes later, Steve Bishop se­cured his team's second goal off a power-play situation. Bis­hop took the puck inside of the blue line, worked himself into the slot area and fired it into the top half of the goal. 
Bishop, who looks like houdini on ice at times, made some impressive coast-to-coast rushes that nearly produced scores. His stick handling and skating abilities were a beauti­ful treat for any hockey en­
thusiast to watch. 
The third goal for Grace was scored by Rataczak, scoring off a rebound. But Dillon avoided the shutout when Frank Gasior scored on a power-play. Gasior took a pass from behind the Grace goal and shot it past Davis. 
"It was a tough game as ex­pected and seems to be that way every year," said Ratac­zak. 
Rataczak knows his club is in good position for making the playoffs, but cautioned that they still have a few hurdles to surpass (Off Campus and CavanaugW Howard) if they are to win the Blue League. 
In the Blue League, Grace is currently atop the standings, followed closely by Off Campus(3-1). Off Campus, which had posted earlier vic­tories against Carroll! Keenan and CavanugW Howard by respective 10-0 and 4-2 deci­sions, suffered an untimely loss to Flanner (2-2), 2-1. Grace and Off Campus are scheduled to do battle on Feb. 18 in what promises to be one of the best matchups of the season. 
There is a logjam for third place among three teams. Flanner, which dropped its first two (the second to Grace, 9-3), evened its record by win­ning 3-1 over St. EdAloly Cross and upsetting Off Campus 2-1. Dillon (2-2) had won two straight in defeating Carroll! Keenan, 6-0, and CavanaugW Howard, 7-1, before losing to Grace. 
CavanaugW Howard (2-2) dropped its last two in losing to Dillon and Off Campus. Carroll! Keenan (1-2) has been unable to score in its last two games as it was blanked by Off Campus and Dillon. Finally, St. Ed's! Holy Cross is at the bot­tom of the league with an 0-4 record. 

Notre Dame's Kevin Markovitz moves the puck up the ice in action earlier this season. Pete 
The standings in the Gold League find Morrissey (3-0) currently in first just ahead of Alumni and Pangborn. M!)rris­sey had no problem in winning its last two by 5-1 and 5-2 scores over Zahm and Fisher respec­tively. Meanwhile, Alumni (3­0-1) has a three-game win streak which includes victories over Sorin, 10-1, and Zahm, 7-5. Pangborn (2-0-1) downed Stan­ford and Sorin and will face a tough test when it must play the Gold favorites (Alumni and Morrissey) to determine divi­sion honors. 
Fisher (2-1-1), which is stili in the hunt, must improve over its last two outcomes which produced a 3-3 tie with Zahm and a loss to Morrissey. The remaining Gold participants, Zahm, Sorin and Stanford, have yet to taste victory. Zahm (0-2-1) came close, but could only manage to tie Fisher. Stanford (0-3) dropped its last two to Alumni and Pangborn. 
Sorin (0-4) has been blown out in every game as indicated by 10-1 and 9-0 whippings ad­ministered by Alumni and Fis­her respectively.

The women also defeated Purdue (16-0), Ohio State (10­6), Kent State (16-0), North Carolina State (14-2), North Carolina (11-5) and Northwes­tern (13-3). 
They now own a 15-0 record, 198-42 (.826) in individual bouts. Auriol has coached his team to a 38-0 record over two years. 
The men had an equally im­pressive weekend, defeating Northwestern (22-5), Purdue (26-1), North Carolina State (21-6), North Carolina (19-8), Ohio State (22-5), Kent State (24-3) and Oberlin (27-0). 
Instead of the epee team fen­cing in the spotlight last weekend, it was the foil team that was unstoppable, perhaps reacting to the 'weak link' sar­casm thrown at them by their epee counterparts and the fact that they entered the weekend with fewer wins than the epeeists. 
Led by Yehuda Kovacs, who now is the only undefeated fen­cer on the team with an indi­vidual record of 24-0, the foilists slashed their way to a 59-4 record over the weekend. 
The foilists were unable to face Ohio State's top foilist, Sunil Sabharwal, because of the fact that the Honorable Mention All-American had been dismissed from the team. The Buckeyes also hid their other top foilist from Irish blades, perhaps in an attempt to protect their records. 
"The idea is to keep your top fencers shielded so that they have undefeated records when they head into the NCAA tourn­ament," said Assistant Coach Rich Daly. "That way they get seeded higher not only because of their record, but also be­cause of schedule strength." 
Epee ringleader Todd Grif­fee, not to' be outdone by the foilists, continued his winning ways, going undefeated on the day to boost his record to 26-2. 
The men have a 16-0 record, 358-74 (.828) in individual bouts. Head Coach Mike DeCicco is now within four meets of winning his 500th meet. That should happen in two weeks, when Notre Dame hosts eight teams, including a very tough Illinois team, on Feb. 21. 
Both teams will be inactive until that meet. In the mean­time, Joel Clark, Derek Holeman, Tim Collins, and Danny Yu will participate in the Junior Olympics in Orlando this weekend. They will be joined by Janice Hynes, Kristin Kralicek, Brenda Leiser, and Anne Barreda.
