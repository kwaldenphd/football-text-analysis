Morals are something which can't be taught 
"You can't legislate morality." 
Tell that to the Indiana state legislature. House Bill1067, passed in committee by a 10-1 vote, states that sex education in Indiana public school must, among other things, "include that abstinence from sexual activity is the only cer­tain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other asso­ciated health problems," and that they "must teach abstinence from sexual activity outside of marriage as the expected standard for all school age children." 
It is technically true that abstinence is the only 100 percent effective method of avoiding sexually transmitted diseases (STD's) and pregnancy. But other methods, such as latex condoms and spermicides, have an effective­ness rate of "over 99.9 percent," according to a national toll-free AIDS hotline. 
Teaching that abstinence is the only way to be safe is technically correct. But it is mislead­ing. It really isn't teaching at all -it's dictating morals. 
The proposed law could have been worse. The previous version would have the state teach schoolchildren that the only way to avoid sexual diseases was to avoid sexual activity except in a "faithful monogamous relationship in the con­text of marriage," which is flat out wrong. The sponsor of this original version said he might not support the new version because it weakened its moral statement. As if the new version isn't a moral statement. 
Anyone who knows teenagers at all will realize that one easy way to get them to do something is to tell them not to do it, preferably in as condescending a: manner as possible. Inner city public schools have tried variations on this theme in sex education, only to see teenage pregnancy rates rise alarmingly. Simply telling high school students not to have sex is at best naive and at worst wrong. 
Aside from whether preaching abstinence will reduce teenage pregnancies or STD oc­curence, the question arises: "Should the state legislate morality?" Does a state or nation have the right to force the views of the majority on the rights of the minority who in most cases would simply like to be left alone? 
Many people seem to believe that sex outside of marriage is permissible. 
Mark 0
Mclaughlin 
Projects Manager 



Even in Indiana. 
Even in Notre Dame, Indiana. 
Indiana isn't the only state to try to legislate its residents into the Catholic Church, though. New Jersey went through a similar debate a few years back, and I'm sure other states are engaged in similar debates with the advent of AIDS. 
But even if only a small minority of citizens believein premarital sex, it isn't right to force­feed the opposite belief to their children. If premarital sex or homosexuality or other forms of 'deviant' sexual behavior are wrong or harm­ful, they are not hurting anyone other than the people who practice them. Does the state have the right to legislate something, be it sex or seat belts, for "your own good?" 
Someday we may be forced by law to vote for the Conservative Party "for our own good." But at least we won't have to worry about AIDS.

Former chief of police elected Haitian leader 
Associated Press 
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti ­The government on Sunday declared political scientist Leslie Manigat the winner of Haiti's presidential election, state-run radio said. 
A former police chief under dictator l<~rancois Duvalier was elected mayor of Port-au­Prince, the radio said. quoting results released by the government-appointed Elec­toral Council. 
Opposition leaders said the election run by the ruling junta was a sham, and the U.S. gov­ernment said it could not be considered "free and fair." 
The radio said Manigat gar­nered 50.3 percent, or 534,080 votes, out of a total 1,061,916 votes cast in the Jan. 17 elec­tion, according the Electoral Council results. 
"The Electoral Council has officially declared Leslie Manigat the new president of the Republic of Haiti," the state radio said.

firmed the victory of the author and political scientist, who is known as a nationalist and po­litical pragmatist. 
Manigat, 57, has pledged to reconcile the nation's powerful military with its restless oppo­sition, but opposition leaders have called him an opportunist and government puppet. 
The Electoral Council also declared Franck Romain win­ner in the election for mayor of Port-au-Prince with nearly 80 percent of the vote. The former army colonel served as chief of police under dictator "Papa Doc" Duvalier and is a former mayor of the capital. 
Critics say he forced school­children to watch the execu­tions of political dissidents. 
The junta led by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy has promised to turn over power to an elected president on Feb. 7. The three­man junta has ruled this im­poverished Caribbean nation since dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile in France in February 1986.

Reagan to address Union 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Reagan's favorite recipe for a State of the Union address: 
I. Stir an oratorical stew of optimism, patriotism and nos­talgia laced with hyperbole. 
2. 
Sprinkle with legislative proposals, mostly leftovers. 

3. 
Add a dash of spicy rebukes for big-spending Democrats, a dollop of praise for the Nicaraguan Contras and a pinch of scorn for Soviet 


militarists. 

4. 
Top off with tributes to an American hero or two sitting in the balcony with Nancy Reagan. 

5. 
Heat to bubbling. Serve before a joint session of Congress and a nationwide television audience. 


If his six previous speeches are any guide, look for Reagan to stick to his standard formula for a boffo performance when he delivers his seventh State of the Union address Monday night. Once again, in the tradi­tion of presidents past, it's likely to be long on rhetoric and short on substance. 
But watch to see if Reagan sweetens the pot with a surprise. 
The old Hollywood actor hinted as much last week when he told a rally of senior admin­istration officials, "As they say in show biz, let's bring them to their feet with our closing act." 
There's an unmistakable Hollywood aroma, in fact, to much of Reagan's past State of the Union oratory. 
His early succession of speeches, focusing on restoring the country to economic health, contained .robust imagery evocative of the late celluloid cowpoke John Wayne. In 1983, he declared that IIAmerica is on the mend." In 1984, "America is back, standing tall." In 1986, "America is on the move." 
While other presidents have quoted the likes of Tom Paine, Ben Franklin or Alexis de Toc­queville, Reagan summed up his vision of America in 1986 with a line from Steven Spiel­berg's popular movie, "Back to the Future." In the same speech, he applauded families and communities as "the co­stars of this great American comeback.'' 
Reagan has seen few of his major State of the Union initia­tives gain the approval of a con­tentious Congress .

Police officer shot with own gun despite pleas for life 
Associated Press 
DALLAS -A man seized a policeman's gun and fatally shot the officer in the face as he pleaded for his life as some spectators yelled "Shoot him," authorities said. 
Officer John Chase, 25, who last month switched from an evening to a day shift to spend more time with his bride of three months, was attacked Saturday as he was writing a traffic ticket. 
The suspect, Carl Dudley Williams, 34, was shot by off­duty officers who responded to the call. The man died a few hours later at Parkland Memorial Hospital, police said. 
A crowd of about 30 people gathered around the officer and his assailant, a homeless man with a history of mental illness, according to police and witnesses. 
"The officer was saying, 'Don't shoot me. I'll help you whatever way I can.' But the guy shot him in the head,"' wit­ness Melitha Johnson said. 
"One girl said that people in the crowd were saying, 'Shoot him, shoot him again,"' said police Lt. Jerald Calane. 
Witnesses said the attacker then strolled down the street, dangling the gun from his hand. 
Investigators said they knew of no motive for the shooting, but Chief Billy Prince and some of his officers blamed recent criticism of the department by some City Council members for creating a dangerous environ­ment for police. 
"This is very tough on the of­ficer on the street,'' Prince said at a news conference. "Constant bashing" of the de­partment created a volatile sit­uation, he said. 
Chase was preparing to give a traffic ticket to the driver of a vehicle he had pulled over when Williams began arguing

with him, police spokeswoman Vicki Hawkins said. 
Williams didn't know the 
driver of the car but began . fighting with the officer and grabbed his .44-caliber gun, 
Hawkins said. 
"Several witnesses said 
p~ople in the crowd were ur­
ging Williams to shoot him," 
she said. 
Williams had a criminal record dating to 1978 with an arrest in August for assault on a police officer, authorities said. 
His father, Carl L. williams, said the family was in "deep shock." 
"All we know is what the police have told us," the father said. "This is very unusual. It's not like him." 
He said his son was gentle but had a history of mental problems. He declined to elab­orate or to explain why Wil­liams lived on the streets.

eating she died from pneumonia, is under review by the University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine, where he is a post­graduate research pathologist. The man who removed the wo­man's head -a research asso­ciate at the medical school -has been put on a paid leave of ab­sence. 
Alcor has refused to turn over Mrs. Kent's head, and ear­lier this month received a tem­porary court order preventing the coroner from disturbing the frozen remains. A Feb. 1 hearing is set. 
Alcor officials say it is the 
novelty of the field that got 
them into trouble. 
"The law is really behind the 
times in dealing with it," Alcor 
attorney Christopher Leanders 
said. 
Coroner Ray Carrillo has found that few if any regula­tions exist to police cryonics firms. 
"It's a big, new, unregulated field," said John Gill, executive officer of the state Cemetery Board, which licenses cemeteries and crematories. 
Gill would like to see cryonics firms outlawed, but he added, "Nothing is going to happen from a legislative and regulatory point of view until you have more proven abuses." 
There have been abuses. In 1980, authorities, acting on the concerns of relatives, opened a tomb in Chatsworth, where four people were said to be frozen. Instead, they found rot­ting remains. 
"I'm almost certain that we're going to have to do some tightening up of the law," said state Sen. Robert Presley. 
The Riverside County coroner's investigation was sparked because Mrs. Kent's death certificate indicated she died at a residence, later deter­mined to be Alcor's laboratory, without a doctor present. 
An autopsy on her headless body was unable to determine the cause of death. 
An estimated 14 heads or complete bodies are known to be frozen by U.S cryonics firms: two bodies are kept by the Cryonics Institute in Oak Park, Mich.; three heads and two bodies at TransTime Inc., in Oakland, Calif.; and one body and six heads at Alcor, which also has a cat and two dogs. 
Alcor is the second-largest cryonics group in the nation, with about 250 members, 98 of whom want to be frozen, Dar­win said. TransTime claims to be the largest with 102 seeking preservation. The Cryonics In­stitute has about 60 seeking cryonic treatment upon death. 
At Alcor, clients pay $100,000 to have their body frozen, $35,000 for a head. There are also $200 annual dues. 
Pictures taken of clients before their deaths greet visitors at Alcor's two-story lab, in an industrial park 50 miles southeast of Los Angeles. A long-haired man wearing a metal-studded choker and a young woman with a Mona Lisa smile are among the portraits. 
The remains are frozen at 320 degrees below zero. The heads, stored in aluminum canisters, are sealed in a cloth bag and nestled in synthetic wool amid swirling liquid nitrogen.

LONDON -Health officials from 145 countries are gather­ing in London this week for a world AIDS summit at which they will plan a global assault on the deadly epidemic. 
The three-day conference, which opens Tuesday, will be the largest meeting of govern­ment ministers ever held on a single health problem, accor­ding to the World Health Or­ganization. 
The U.N. agency, based in Geneva, and the British gov­ernment are co-sponsoring the event.

Debate on the homeless ignores causes 
perception of the homelessness along with the nascent agenda for addressing it. But their picture obscures more than it illuminates." With their insistance that all of the homeless are "just like you and me," they paint a Grapes-of­Wrathesque picture of depression traceable to one figure, the Eternal Bogeyman and Great Satan, Ronald Reagan. All-purpose radical activists like Mitch Snyder attempt to connect the whole homeless problem to Nicaragua, the "new" cold war, the American way of life, and any number of other scapegoats. Sadly ironic is their insistance that Reagan's "cuts" in social spending have "caused" the entire problem, as if it never existed before 1981. Reagan's budget in real terms have in fact doubled the amount of social spending since the height of the Great Society in the mid 70's. Peter Rossi, a University of Massachusetts sociologist whose census of the Chicago homeless was published in leading sci­entific journals, says "The advocates want you to say 'there but for the grace of God and the fact that Reagan didn't look at me directly go 1."' Meanwhile the real homeless are out freezing, or festering in shelters with their mental illnesses and self-enervating habits still very much intact. 
Real charity and effective social policy stress self-improvement in order that the individual, if possible, can as­sume a normal role in society; they should not merely institutionalize the problem at a poverty-line level. Under­standing the problems of the individual is key, rather than lumping him into some mythical category. The very na­ture of the present homeless population dictates a need for more than simply some beds and a roof. Liberal social policy ignores such complications, weakly attacking the symptoms but leaving the root of the problem un­scathed. By ignoring basic human at­tributes, it can often create more prob­lems than it solves. Consequently, the problem is merely sustained while money is poured down a black hole. 
A humane society cares for those who have no way whatsoever of taking care of themselves. Effective help for the homeless (especially for the mentally ill homeless who make up such a large segment of the group), is help that is well-intentioned but more importantly, well-planned and specific.

Quote of the Day 
"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father In heaven." 
At the start of the 80's, a terrible "new" problem showed up on the TV screen of America: a "just­discovered" mass of people called "the homeless." People of good conscience everywhere wondered where this group had suddenly come from, who they were (and how they got that way), and what could be done to solve the prob­lem. To this day, a big questiop mark remains in the minds of most Americans about the nature of the homeless population, while the impera­tive to "do something" seemingly be­comes greater every day. Clouds of misinformation spewed out by self­styled homeless advocates have merely added to the confusion. We are flip­pantly told that the size of population ranges "oh, between 2 or 3 million or so" and that all of the homeless people themselves are "just like you and me." Such "thinking" fails to confront the truth about homelessness (for various reasons, not just ignorance) while we sit with a national travesty on our hands. 
Glenn Fogarty 
the american vision 
So who, then, are the homeless, and how many are there? University re­searchers, guided by policemen, social workers and local homeless people, have searched through the nation's major cities for the past several years. Most of these empirical scientific studies have placed the number of homeless between 250,000 and 350,000. Ten National Institute of Mental Health studies in different sections of the U.S. have consistently determined that fully one-third (over 100,000) of the homeless are severely mentally ill. Another third suffers from alcohol and drug-related problems, and a sizeable group is com­posed of disturbed veterans. The com­mon denominator of the homeless pop­ulation seems to be a varying degree of mental illness. 
The average American asks "But if they're 'crazy' why are they being left alone?" The answer to that question, my friends, is a story well worth remembering. In 1955, the population of public mental hospitals reached an all-time high at 599,000. Thirty years later, after thousands of evictions and denied admissions, the mental hospital population stood at 146,000. Something obviously happened. 
Through a combination of intellectual 
Doonesbury 
quackery, both professional and politi­
cal, and the "best" of intentions, the 
deinstitutionalization movement was 
born 30 years ago. With the advent of 
psychoactive drugs like Thorazine, 
many psychiatrists believed that the in­
sane could be rendered docile enough 
for release (with occasional treatment 
at "community centers") into society. 
The patients would then improve radi­
cally simply because of the social 
stimulations they would find on the out­
side, in contrast with the bleak routine 
of life inside the hospitals. Popular at 
the time as well were the views of 
crackpot psychiatrists like R.D. Laing, 
who claimed that insanity was merely 
a rational response to an irrational so­
ciety. 
Enter the Civil Libertarians. The liberal American Civil Liberties Union and its ideological bedfellows soon launched an attack upon the idea of in­stitutionalization as a whole, claiming that it interfered with the rights of people whom ''no one'' had the slightest right to deem ''mentally incompetent.'' First they forced a Supreme Court deci­sion that changed involuntary commit­ment procedures from decisions based upon professional judgment to court­room escapades examining a person's "potential for imminent criminality." Through a strategic combination of muckraking and class-action lawsuits, the ACLU managed to shut down scores of mental hospitals, flooding the streets with disgorged mentally ill, combined with a community health system (staffed not by psychiatrists, but mainly social workers) totally unpre­pared to suddenly meet the needs of such huge numbers. 
Unlike the liberal insistance on easy sentences and quick parole for criminals, which makes society the vic­tim, the only victims of deinstitutionalization are most often the mentally ill themselves. It is com­plete hogwash to imagine the fact that it's some triumph of civil liberty when people who are unable to make rational decisions are now "free" to make ra­tional choices. 
Some lessons, however, are rarely learned, even at the expense of making the insane the victims in one's ongoing social tinker-toy. Mayor Koch's plan to place many of New York City's men­tally ill (estimated at 60 percent of New York's total homeless population of 35,000) back into mental hospitals has, unsurprisingly, met fierce resistance. The NYCLU has threatened to sue the

City and vilified the mayor, ironically, as an "enemy" of the homeless. Ad­dressing the APA convention in Sep­tember, Koch fired back, "If the crazies want to sue me, they have every right to sue, and by crazies I'm not talking about the people we're going to be helping. I'm talking about those who say 'No, you have no right to intervene to help."' 
. The ACLU joins the self-styled home­less advocates in stating that the home­less don't need any psychiatric atten­tion or special care, just more bends and public housing galore. While nec­essary, these measures leave the root causes of the homeless problem, the be­havioral difficulties, quite intact. Such "advocates" ignore reality. 
Dealing with the problem of the men­tally ill homeless requires pragmatic action in the form of a mental-health system that works. That means 
"The very nature of the present homeless pop­ulation dictates a need for more than simply some bed and a roof. Liberal social policy ignores such compli­
cations~~ 
humane state hospitals for those who can't live uninstitutionalized, and vigorous community outreach pro­grams for the few who can live inde­pendently (and take their medicine) to do so. As to charges that hospitals only offer inhumane treatment, there is no excuse for such a situation, even if re­sources aren't up to par, it is people and methods that are to blame. The funds for such a system are readily available if one looks closely. 
Is any resolution of the problem of the mentally ill homeless on the horizon? Not really. Congress' recent homeless bill provides little if any remedial measures for the root causes of so much of the homelessness (the mental illness and substance abuse). The problems will ultimately remain intact, thanks to ignorance and mis­guided ideas in Congress and the na­tion. Much of the blame rests on the homeless "advocates," a well-meaning lot who more often than not place poli­tical agendas ahead of any pressing concern for the real homeless.

T
he Romantics really pull their weight during a live performance. In their pre-tour, Friday engagement at the acoustically imperfect Stepan Center, the band overcame a subdued crowd and poor sound quality, provided by the facility's domed roof, to give a brief clinic on performing live. 
After a forty-five minute set from special guests Frank Al­lison and the Odd Sox, the Romantics blasted out 20 songs in an hour and a half, including five new tunes from their yet to be released album, and, of course, their classics "What I Like About You," "Rock You Up," and "Talking in Your Sleep." 
Bassist Mike Skill and guitarist Coz Canter provided a wall of rhythm and "the layered background harmonies." Skill started with the band in 1977 as part of its founding nucleus while Canler joined in 1980. 
"We've cut demos for the new ones but we still have to go back in," said a melancholy Wally Palmar of the new album. "I liked the crowd," Wally com­mented, "I like this kind of au­dience better than, say, a bar because they're the same age, and you know where you are with them. They had a good time ... it was a good time." Palmar, the founding Romantic, played guitar and sang lead vocals on the majority of the evening's selections. 
Drummer David Petratos, the newest member of the Roman­tics acquired from South Florida's Slyder in 1985, han­dled the lead vox spot on the remaining tunes. He never missed a beat pounding out the time on his 28 inch bass drum with relentless fervor throughout the evening. Petratos is the partial product of drum mentor Gene Thaler, who has helped to guide such drumming greats as Stew Nevit of Shadowfax and Max Wein­berg of the E Street Band. Petratos' style and experience, as well as that of the entire outfit, was more than evident throughout the evening at Stepan. 
Through a quality musical performance, marred acousti­cally by the lack of an appro­priate facility, and a sincere portrayal of a rock music and goodtimes mentality, the Romantics brought to life what for the mos£ part was a ter­ribly ill crowd. After the show, a certain sense of disappoint­ment was evident on the tired faces of all four band mem­bers, not because the crowd was comatose, but in spite of it as if they could have done more to arouse enthusiasm. Sometimes a horse needs to be shot before it knows it has a broken leg--the crowd missed a great show. 

The evening's opening act . Ann Arbor's own Frank Allison and the Odd Sox, played ·with just as much drive as the head­lining Romantics. Frank Allison, the band's rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist was chosen Ann Arbor's Best Songwriter of 1987 by the Metro Times. Take the Times' word for it on this one. Frank and the Sox performed songs they wanted to play and wanted people to hear with the power and charmisma of a band like the BoDeans--and then some. 
With any luck, Allison, and the Sox, will get some well deserved exposure via their single "The Rodent of Love" and its B side "Some Odd Girl." Unfortunately, this single is available only by mail, so as a special favor to Frank... write: Frank Allison and the Odd SoX'P.O. Box 77961Ann Arbor, Ml 48107. Good luck to Frank and his Sox (Dan Beckett-guitar, John Boyle­bass, Nathan Logus-drums). 
Both the evening's acts, the Romantics and Frank Allison, fit the criteria needed to be filled for the success of a live perfor­mance. Without a harmonious coexistance between the ideals of musicianship and all the elements which create a spe­cific mind set on stage, live performances are moot en­deavors. Still, seeing, and hearing, is believing.

Since Chuck Bower and Mark Schnur began managing Grace's foodsales in the fall of 1986, yearly sales have in­creased by 27 percent. 
Sales increased by 20 percent in the first year alone. 
The phenominal success of Grace's foodsales. named Sarge's after a short. feisty, retired head maid that Grace residents nicknamed "Sarge", is due largely to Bowers' and Schnur's marketing efforts and efficiency. 
Sarge's is run by three stu­dent managers; Charles Bower I Head Manager), Mark Schnur (I nvcntory Manager) and Paul Waguespack (Personnel Manager). They are advised by Assistant Rector Mike Walsh. 
Two major changes the new management team impli­mentcd were a renovation of the foodsales area, and an ex­pansion of the menu. The large sales revenues resulting from these changes, in addition to low costs, have resulted in sub­stantial profit. 
Reinvesting much of the profits back into capital im­provements of Sarge's was a major priority. "We thought that if we increased the aes­thetics, it would attract people to come down and spend more time here," said Bower. 
Initial improvements in­cluded installing a new ceiling, cedar panelling, and mirrors. A big screen TV was also bought for the lounge area. Bower, Schnur, and Waguespack were able to keep costs to a minimum through doing much of the installation work themselves. 
A second change was an en­largement of the menu. New items include pizza, burritos, chili, submarine sandwiches, popcorn and juices. Prices are kept low to ensure that Sarge's offers the most competitive prices. A large pizza sells for $3.90, Jess than half the price of a small pizza from Dominos'. 
Unlike some of the other dorm foodsales, Sarge's man­agement does not have to pay rent for their space. Their main costs, therefore, come from in­ventory and wages. Because Sarge's management has kept inventory costs low. they can afford to pay Sarge's employees better in compari­son to other foodsales employees. 
Low costs coupled with the initial renovations and menu changes paid off so well .that from 1987 profits management was able to purchase a weight machine, a second big screen TV, an electric organ, and three VCR's for the dorm. In addition, they bought track lighting, a new pizza oven, and a neon sign for Sarge's. 
Nlanagernent has expanded hours and hired more employees in response to in­creasing business. Sarge's is now open 33 hours per week with 25 full-time and 25 tempo­rary workers. The average of 70 pizzas sold every night reflects the high sales volume they have reached. 
Unlike other hall foodsales managers, Bower, Schnur, and Waguespack are on a salary and do not get the profits them­selves. Profits either go back into Sarge's, toward purchases for the dorm, or into the food­sales savings account for fu­ture use. 
At the end of every month the three managers meet with Walsh to decide how to invest their profits. Ideas for addi­tions and new improvements are given at this time. 
Part of the new manage­ments' success can be attrib­uted to their ingenuity. "The one thing I notice of these guys, compared to the people who run other foodsales, is that they're always trying new ideas. They might not always work, but at least they try." 
said Grace senior Glen Hegewald. One innovation is a delivery system to the Pasquerillas. 
The one problem Bower, Schnur, and Waguespack have encountered, is getting their ideas implimented through the University. "Dealing with the University is the worst part be­cause there's so much red tape. And everyone wants a say in what you do but no one wants to follow up and do it," said Bower. 
The large size of Grace offers an advantage through sales po­tential and space available for inventory. 
Because Sarge's serves such a large number of people (550 Grace residents alone) order­ing can be done in bulk through suppliers who deliver and stock Sarge's themselves. This in­creases efficiency by saving management time and money. As inventory manager, Schnur is in charge of ordering, dealing with suppliers, and general maintenance. 
Waguespack is in charge of personnel and all of Sarge's banking. His duties include hiring, training, and schedul­ing the workers. 
Bower, head manager, is in charge of Sarge's finance and accounting. He oversees all operations while taking care of 
· the books and the payroll. Every month Bower must sub­mit a balance sheet and income statement to Walsh. 
Both Bower and Schnur devote about 15 hours per week to Sarge's. Although they say that their reponsibilities take "half a grade point off the GPA," both agree that the rewards have been well worth the effort. 
"It's basically like an intern­ship," said Bowers. "We've 
_ learned managerial capabili­ties such as handling people, money, and inventory," Schnur said. He added, "We have a lot of pride in our ac­complishments. We've done a Jot here since we've taken over.'' 
Delco to offer car OAT players 
Associatt'd Press 
WARREN, MICH. -There will be few, if any, tapes to play on them, but Delco Electronics Corp. will be providing digital audio tape players for some General Motors Corp. vehicles by summer, Delco officials said. 
Digital audio tape systems, or DATs, offer virtually peifect sound reproduction because like CDs, or compact disc sys­tems, the music they play is translated into digital signals­-numbers--when it is recorded. 
"DAT is the next step in playback capability format. We want to be one of the first to offer it and develop it." said John Crawford, Delco Electronics' general market­ing director. 
Although DAT players and recorders are available in Europe and Japan, resistance from the entertainment and recording industries has so far prevented their introduction in the United States. 
Those industries fear that the high quality of DAT sound reproduction could eat into sales of original recordings even further than existing home taping systems, so they have taken their case to Congress. 
But Delco Electronics, a sub­sidiary of GM Hughes Electronics Corp., expects the dispute to be resolved soon and has decided not to wait to be among the first on the U.S. auto sound market. 
"The consumer has come to expect the same type of sound in an automobile as they can get in their living room. What's amazing to me is that we've been able to do it," said Donald Almquist, Delco E:lectronics vice president and general manager. 
Ford Motor Co. already has announced it will offer a Sony system in this country, said Mi­chael Shoemaker, supervisor of Delco's playback mecha­nisms group. 
Delco announced Wednesday it will offer optional radio sys-terns that include CD players after March 1 and will follow with a DAT system probably by summer. Prices have not been set, said W. Don Helm, Delco's audio systems direc­tor. 
Delco showed prototypes of its CD and DAT player systems at a three-day "Technology in Motion" show at GM's Tech Center styling dome in Warren. 
The CD system will be of­fered on 30 GM models and the DAT system initially on selec­ted GM cars. But both will fit any car equipped with a recent Delco radio system, said Deb Morgan, one of many Delco employees explaining exhibits at the show. 
Since DAT tapes, blank or pre-recorded, aren't yet sold in this country, Delco will provide a set of three pre-recorded tapes to everyone who buys its DAT system, Crawford said. 
A DAT tape is about half the size of a standard cassette but holds about two hours of pro­gramming, compared with an hour or 90 minutes for most cassettes. 
Ugliness more than skin deep for Yugo 
rrWilliam E. Prior, president of Yugo of America, predicted sales of 200,000 Yugos a year, as quoted in the Wall Street Journal. Yugo sales were held down to 49,000 in 1987 because of poor quality, little reliability, and a blatent lack of styling. 
Despite their intense efforts to overcome these problems, one fatal flaw remains: the car is ugly. Starting at $4200, the car's price rises to $10,000 with options. The higher range borders the cheaper and far more stylish Mazdas, and the lower range comes within a few thousand dollars of the higher quality Hyundais. With a big purchase such as a car, people are more apt to spend the extra money for style. This suggests a bleak outlook for Yugo's future in this country. '::7 Business Week observed that those in the market for blank audio cassettes should stock up soon. The falling dollar is forcing leading cassette makers, including Max ell, to raise prices by as much as 20 percent on Feb. 1.

u There have been two developments at Eastman Kodak Company. The company recently announced that in March they will begin delivery of two new color copiers. Kodak wants to join the growing color copier market, which is ex­pected to reach $2 billion within two years. The new copiers cost $54,000 and produce color copies for just under fifty cents each. 
Friday saw Kodak enter the $110 billion pharmaceutical market with its $5.1 billion purchase of Sterling Drug Inc. The $89.50 per share offer easily surpassed previous bids by Roffman-La Roche & Co. Kodak will be taking advantage of the American pharmaceutical industry's profitability, boosted recently by a weak dollar and the quicker approval of new products. The loss of its instamatic camera line does not seem to be slowing the giant. '::7 Columnist Carol Kleiman recently wrote about a study of the the Peace Corps Dr. Joseph O'Donoghue. He has fol­lowed the careers of 1000 Peace Corps alumni, and found that they tend to rise above their peers in careers after their tour of duty in the Corps. The salaries of Peace Corps alums are 13.5 percent higher in education, 10.6 percent higher in government and a whopping 40.1 percent higher in health service. The rest, including business professions, earned an­incredible 68.98 percent higher than the average. 
Does this mean that joining the Peace Corps will build one into a super worker? 
Unfortunately, Dr. O'Donoghue overlooked the obvious fact that those who have the motivation to spend a year or two in a third world country helping the poor will be as motivated in their careers, and will be more than willing to make the necessary sacrifices. The Peace Corps more than likely gives less of an opportunity to build a great worker, and more of an opportunity to prove oneself. But if that is an obvious fact to us, it will be an obvious fact to employers when searching through resumes. u Another instance of Spuds Mackenzie bashing occurred over the holiday season. As part of a their holiday promotions, Anheuser-Busch put Spuds dressed as Santa Claus suit on Bud Light twelve-pack cases. The State of Ohio, however, banned the sales of these festive cases of beer. According to an obscure Ohio law, Santa Claus may not be used to promote alcoholic beverages.

was good, but he wasn't that good." 
Even more disconcerting was the Bison's quick lead and ability to stay with the Irish despite the barrage of Notre Dame shots on goal. North Dakota State jumped out to 1-0 lead just 54 seconds into the game, and held a 3-1 advantage midway through the second period before Tim Kuehl and Thomas Smith tallied to knot the score at the end of the per­iod. Bob Bilton got the game­winning goal and the Irish held on for the win. 
On Saturday night, the roles were reversed. The Bison were forced to play catch-up as Notre Dame bolted to a 5-1 first period lead. But a second­period letdown allowed North Dakota State to close the gap to two goals, 6-4, at the end of two periods. That was as close as they would come, however, as third-period insurance goals by the Irish assured the out­come. 
Junior left wing Tom Fitzgerald, who scored twice and added an assist in Saturday night's game, echoed his coach's contention that the Irish will need to raise their game a notch in order to win their remaining games and keep faint post-season NCAA tournament hopes alive. 
"We had a really bad second period on Saturday," said keeping the score close with silly mistakes. You still get the scary feeling that no matter how much you think you're dominating, one screw-up defensively could cost us the game." 
Senior defenseman Frank O'Brien agrees with Fitzgerald. 
"We have a tendency to play at our opponent's level, whatever that is," said O'Brien. "We're a decent team, but we've got to be con­sistently good if we're going to be really good. We can't just be great one week and slack off the next." · 
The Irish are home for their next three series, starting with next week's action against ACHA rival Kent State. In two weeks, Notre Dame faces Air Force, a team ranked slightly ahead of the Irish among in­dependents. Of all the indepen­dent teams in the nation, one will receive a bid to the NCAA championships. 
The Irish are ranked fifth and the Falcons fourth in those rankings, but Air Force holds wins over teams ahead of it. 
"It's a confusing situation," said Schafer, referring to the playoff situation. "But all we want to do is win hockey games. If we keep winning and the teams above us stumble, great. But all we can do is to prepare for our own games."

NEW YORK -Sprinter Ben Johnson, acclaimed the "World's Fastest Human" after breaking the world record in the 100-meter dash last year when he went unbeaten in 21 races, was named The Associ­ated Press Male Athlete of the Year on Sunday by an over­whelming margin. 
Johnson became the first Canadian track athlete to win the honor and only the second Canadian in the award's 57­year history -the other was hockey player Wayne Gretzky in 1982. Johnson received 48 first-place votes, 18 seconds, 28 thirds and 322 points in ballot­ing by sports writers and broadcasters. Points were al­loted on a 5-3-1 basis. 
Wide receiver Jerry Rice of the San Francisco 49ers, who set an NFL record with 22 touchdown receptions in only 12 games, finished second with 222 points on the basis of 22 firsts, 26 seconds and 34 thirds.

Associated Press 

BLOOMINGTON -Michigan Coach Bill Frieder knows Bob Knight built a reputation with tough defense, so he knew he had to find a special advantage. 
"We changed all of our of­fense," Frieder said Sunday after his seventh-ranked Wol­verines beat Knight's Indiana squad, and stopped the Hoosiers' home winning streak at 29 games, the second-longest in the nation behind Kansas' 55 games. 
"When Bobby has a week to prepare, you know he's going to know all of your plays by name. So we changed our en­tire offense. That's hard to do in one or two days," Frieder said. 
Rumeal Robinson scored Michigan's first 11 points of the second half, keying the rally that lifted the Wolverines to their 14th victory in 16 games and their fifth Big Ten win against one defeat. 
Indiana, the defending na­59-58. Reserve Anthony Todd hit a 10-foot jumper with two seconds left to cap the com­eback. 
"It's just a miracle for us to win this game," UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian said. "With

defense  went  up  one  notch  
higher.  We  got  into  total  
denial.''  
Brothers  Keith  and  Karl  

James each hit 3-pointers for UNLV during the late rally. 
"They're a big play team and they got the big plays today,'' said Temple Coach John Chaney, whose team fell to 14-1. 
Tarkanian let his team free­lance for the final shot after Temple's Duane Causwell missed a free throw with 17 seconds left and the Owls leading 58-57. 
After Todd hit the shot, Temple called timeout to set up a final play. But a desperation pass slipped through Mark Macon's hands as time ex­pired.

with the best of them. 
Nine of Robinson's points came in the first half on 4-of-4 shooting from the field. The sophomore had the seemingly­impossible task of guarding Manning in both man-to-man and zone defenses, and the J ayhawk senior managed only 13 shots in the contest. Robin­son was helped in that area, as Gary Voce, Scott Paddock and Mark Stevenson often double­teamed Manning. 
With less than a minute left and Notre Dame leading, 74-72, Robinson made what might have been the biggest defen­sive play of the game. 
Kansas' Otis Livingston pushed the ball upcourt against Notre Dame's David Rivers, but Robinson dashed up from behind Livingston and slapped the ball away from him. Rivers grabbed it, was fouled, and hit two free throws to give Notre Dame its largest lead of the game, 76-72. 
"I saw him bringing it up, and I saw that he had his back turned," Robinson explained. "I just sagged off my man and helped Dave out." 
Robinson made mistakes as well, the most critical coming with 15 seconds left when he wa~ called for an over-the-back foul which sent Manning to the free-throw line with a chance to tie the game. But Manning missed the front end of the one­and-one, and Jayhawk forward Chris Piper stumbled out of bounds with the rebound. 
Robinson, who sat out last year under NCAA Bylaw 5-1­(j), said having support from the stands made Saturday's game special. 
"It's a great feeling to have them come down for a big game like this,'' Robinson said, "especially when it's a big win. I wish my mother could have been here, too." 
Robinson's mother is ill and could not make the trip to Notre Dame, the sophomore said. 
"When I watched the game last week against DePaul," Serotte said of the 77-71 Irish loss in which Robinson scored three points, "I said, 'That's not Keith Robinson.' I called Shu (Notre Dame assistant coach John Shumate) and told him that. Then I made arrange­ments to be here to watch him play this week. 
"He was super. But you have not seen what this kid can do. He's got all the skills, the best attitude, and he'll be great be­cause he's playing for Digger Phelps. When they made Keith Robinson, they threw away the mold."

ND tennis team starts strong, shuts out Broncos in opener 
By TIM SULLIVAN Sports Writer 
First year coach Bob Bayliss didn't know quite what to ex­pect, as his men's tennis team entered its first match of the spring season. 
They had a successful fall season under recently retired head coach Tom Fallon, but that was three months and one head coach ago. 
Many of Bayliss's questions were answered Saturday at the Eck Tennis Pavilion, where he saw his Irish handily defeat Western Michigan 9-0. 
"I thought we were a better team going in," said Bayliss. "But I really didn't know. I haven't been through the cycle yet. It'll take me most of this year to learn about the teams we play.'' 
Bryan Kalbas didn't skip a beat in his first match of the spring, downing Western's Karl Krauter 6-2, 7-5. The junior, who played number one throughout the fall, has only ce­mented his reputation as the Irish's best player with Bayliss. 
"He's earned that spot," said Bayliss. "He hasn't lost a chal­lenge match yet. He's an excel­lent player." 
A pair of seniors were the keys to the shutout for Notre Dame. Sean O'Brien, who "hasn't played a whole lot of singles", and Paul Daggs, who was hurt by the flu, each came up with big performances to seal the victory. 
Senior Dan Walsh had a very busy afternoon. In his singles match, he spotted Jerry McKim three points in the first set before winning 12 of the next 13 points for a 6-4, 6-0 vic­tory. He then teamed with Daggs in the most exciting doubles match of the afternoon, a 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (9-7) heart­stopper. 
Bayliss' learning experience will continue next weekend, as the Irish (now 1-0 l play host to two teams who beat Notre Dame last year, Northern and Southern Illinois. 
"A lot of people don't think I'm a very smart scheduler," said Bayliss. "But I want to play as tough a schedule as pos­sible." 

Belles take 2nd in tournament 
By HEATHER ATKINSON Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's basketball team placed second this weekend in a four-team tourn­ament held at Angela Athletic Facility. The Belles' record now stands at 6-6. 
Other teams in the competi­tion were Cedarville, Marian 
and  the  University  of  Mic­ 
higan.    
In  the  first  game,  Saint  

Mary's played Cedarville. The Belles got into foul trouble ear­ly, but took a 7-0 lead. Cedar­ville rallied to tie up the game with a score of 14-14. The score remained close throught the first half, but then Cedarville pulled ahead for a 28-26 lead. 
The second half resembled the first with neither team gaining a significant lead. Saint Mary's obtained control with six minutes remaining and dominated the tempo for the rest of the game for a 52-49 victory. 
Tammye Radke led Saint Mary's with 18 points. 
In the championship game, against Marian College, the Belles ran into trouble from the start. Marian built a 12-8 lead early in the game, but the Belles were able to close it within one at 18-17. Saint Mary's, however, was unable to keep up with the quick pace clock, however, and were and Marian rallied to take a 25-defeated 69-59. 19 lead at the half. Once again, Tammye Radke

Irish upset 16th-ranked Jayhawks 80-76 
NO gamble contains KU 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
Notre Dame picked up the dice Sat­urday against 16th-ranked Kansas, rolled them, and came up with sevens. 
By playing a sagging zone defense around the Jayhawks Danny Manning, the Irish gambled that the other Kansas players wouldn't be able to hit from 
 
outside consistently. The gamble payed off in an 80-76 upset. 
Manning scored 22 points, but took only 13 shots and made nine. His team couldn't pick up the slack. Chris Piper, normally a 68 percent shooter from the floor hit on only two-of-eight attempts. 
"To hold Manning to 13 shots was a great job by Gary Voce, Scott Paddock and Mark Stevenson," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps. "We knew the things we had to do to beat Kansas. Manning is best working working from half-court, and we did a great job hold­ing him to a few shots." 
And while Kansas couldn't get the ball to Manning, the Irish made certain that David Rivers had it in crunchtime. Rivers simply took the game over when it was on the line. He scored a game­high 29 points, including six-straight free throws in the final minute of the game to ice it. For the game, he shot a near-perfect 14-of-15, as he penetrated the lane and looked to kick the ball out or find a way to score. 
"I don't see myself missing a free throw," Rivers, who has made 99-of-116

ND women survive 
By THERESA KELLY Sports Writer 
EAST LANSING, Mich.-The Notre Dame women's basket­ball team spent 39 minutes and and 25 seconds playing defense as tough as it can be played yesterday. Not only were those last 35 seconds bad for anyone with a weak heart, but they al­most cost the Irish the game. 
Notre Dame held Michigan State to .304 shooting for the game and held Spartan scoring leader Kim Archer to seven points, eight below her season average. 
But in those closing seconds, luck, tenacity and the referees put the excitement back in the game. Trailing 57-48 with 35 seconds to go, the Spartans em­barked on a comeback. Taraisa Wills hit a 17-foot jumper to cut the lead to seven, and after the Irish missed a free throw, MSU's Carlotta Taylor hit a three-point bomb from the top of the key. Not only was that the first three-pointer of the season for the Spartans, but Taylor was fouled. She com­pleted the four-point play to make the score 57-52.

ND sweeps Bison, despite subpar play 
By PETE SKIKO Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame hockey team raised its record to an im­pressive 17-2-2 after a weekend sweep of North Dakota State this weekend at the JACC. 
But the play of the Irish was somewhat less than impressive against the Bison, a club team which has won the national club hockey championship three years in a row. Irish Head Coach Ric Schafer knows that his squad must pick up its level of play for its next two series against Kent State and Air Force. 
"I would say we played pretty average," said Schafer, in his debut season as the Irish mentor. "I'd give our effort about a C or a B-. It's tough because I saw the guys play about as good as I think they can last weekend at Army and anything less than that appears to be a letdown to me. But I can't expect that kind of inten­sity every time we take the ice." 
Amazingly, Notre Dame won Friday night's contest only 6-3 while outshooting the Bison 87­
20. Although the Irish came away with the win, Schafer was concerned about the shooting inaccuracy. 
"You could say we kept the pressure on," said Schafer, "but we really were not accu­rate at all. I mean, their goalie

Former coach helps Robinson 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
The words were shocking, but they seemed to work. 
"You're better than Danny Man­ning," Keith Robinson's former high school coach Art Serotte told the 6-9 Robinson before Notre Dame's 80-76 up­set of 16th-ranked Kansas on Saturday. 
Robinson scored 10 points, grabbed a game-high 10 rebounds and made a cru­cial steal in the final minute of what Irish coach Digger Phelps agreed was the sophomore's best game for Notre Dame. 
"I told him that I didn't come 5oo miles to see him lose," said Serotte, who drove into South Bend from Buf­falo, where he coached Robinson at Grover Cleveland High School. Robin­son's father and 15-year-old brother also made the trip. 
"I told him that I thought he was bet­ter than Danny Manning," Serotte added. "From what I saw today, he'll be above and beyond (Manning l. He can do everything, and his attitude is fantastic." 
Manning, who averages more than 23 points a game and is considered by many the favorite for Player of the Year honors, notched 22 points for the Jayhawks on Saturday. And although Serotte's comparison might be a bit premature, Robinson showed a sellout crowd at the Joyce ACC and a national­

was called for a charging foul as she tried to move up the court. Cynthia Lyons launched another three-point bucket for the Spartans, and the Irish lead was down to two. 
Fortunately for the Irish, the clock finally wound down before . the Spartans could throw another prayer at the basket. The final score was 57­55, and despite the score, Irish head coach Muffet McGraw was pleased with the play of her squad. 
"I thought we did a good job with our poise, we were calm despite some adversity," McGraw said. "The crowd was loud, the officiating was suspect at the end. We held our composure and won a close game, which is something we've been wanting to do all year." 

The Irish led 28-24 at the half, as both teams were playing tight defense. The Irish shot 44 percent in the half and held the Spartans to 29 percent. 
MSU took a brief lead early in the second half, but the Irish regained the lead and then went on a ten-point run to go ahead 50-39. The Irish defense took over, and the Spartans did

not make another field goal for over five minutes. Then the comeback began. 
"We made a spurt in the second half, and we got up nine," McGraw said. "We've talked about that, we have to make a run. We did exactly what we wanted to do on of­fense, and we held them on defense. 
"We didn't shoot well, like we've done all year; 28-24, that may be our lowest halftime total in a while. I'd like to see us score more."
