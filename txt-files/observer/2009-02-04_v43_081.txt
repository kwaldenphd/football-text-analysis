ND Olympics results released 
Keough, Welsh Family team wins by 1,000 points, while event raises over $4,500 
By SARAH MERVOSH 
News Writer 
Keough Hall and Welsh Family Hall defended their title as champions of RecSports' Late Night Olympics on Saturday, an event which raised just over $4,500 for St. Joseph's County Special Olympics, according to John Beven, Facilities and Student Development Intern for RecSports. 
Beven said that the $4,599.62 raised does not include the donations made at the door and T-shirt sales, so the amount raised will likely increase once that money is added. 
Beven said that the highlight of the night was when "the 
Special Olympians trounced the Athletic Department and Rectors in the basketball game." 
"Fr. Pete McCormick; [rector] of Keough Hall, was the one bright spot of Notre Dame's bas­ketball team, but turnovers, poor teamwork, and tempers did their team in," Beven said. 

McCormick said that his favorite part of the night was "playing against the Olympians and seeing ... the excitement· and energy they had during the game."

Groups react to abortion-funds ban-reversal 
Right to Life Club, Feminist Club presidents disagree on Obama's decision to lift ban 
U.S. would begin funding abor­tions. · 
"When I first heard that Obama overturned the policy, I thought it meant we would start giving money to fund abortions. Really, though, it's more that ... organizations that receive government funding 'are no longer banned from promoting and providing abor­tions," she said. "There's no movement of money. just a ban lifted." · 
With this act, Obama is fail­ing to live up to his campaign promises, Daly said.

Professor defends pope on disputed bishop issue 
By ROBERT SINGER News Writer 
Pope Benedict XVI's recent de.ci­sion to lift an excommunication order on four radical bishops, one of whom denied the Holocaust, has focused worldwide criticism on the Vatican. 
But Lawrence Cunningham, profes­sor of Theology, 
supported ·the pope's decision, helping to clarify the reasons for the action amid criti­cism from Jewish groups and liberal Catholics. 
"The pope's 


desire to reconcile C I h these people was unn ng am good but it was handled very badly from a public relations stand point," he said~ According to Cunningham, the four men reinstated by the pope were part of a rogue sect -the Society of St. Pius X -that had been operating without the .church's permission. Radically traditional in their views, members of this group reject reli­gious liberty and have supported authoritarian political rulers in the past, such as General Franco in Spain and Augusto Pinochet in Chile, he said.

Mt. Rushmore 
As is their nature, ESPN recently asked another meaningless and com­pletely subjective question of its audi­ence: Who belongs on the Mt. Hushmure of Sports? And, as is my nature, I had to come up with my own idea of who belongs on the Mt. Rushmore of Sports, and discuss (or argue) with anyone who is willing (or even unwilling) to listen. By no means do I consider my opinion to be infalli­
ble, but I do think  
that my knowledgeof sports is suffi- Eric Prister  
cient to at least  
allow myself an opinion. I have  Sports Writer  
talked to multiple  
people about my  

own opinion and have heard the opin-· ions of many others. I have heard responses that vary from Jackie Robinson to Arnaz Battle to Barry Bonds. Robinson, because of the impact he had on baseball, and on sports itself. Battle, because he is my cousin's favorite player, and what bet­ter criteria for one's mvn personal Mt. Rushmore of Sports than the athletes you like best? And Bonds, because if one goes purely by stats alone, then no one has dominated the game as our favorite steroid-ridden home run king. 
For me, though, one deserves to be on the Mt. Hushmore of Sports ifhe (or she) transcends his sport. He must have not only been an athlete, if not the greatest of all time, but must also have meant more to the image of his sport than any other. Therefore, I have cho­sen four athletes who I think are most deserving of the honor: Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Muhammad Ali and Babe Ruth. 
In my opinion, Jordan is the most deserving of the honor. Not only is the unquestioned greatest basketball play­er of all time, but he also did more for the sport than it ever could have done for him. One only needs to look at the state of the NBA post-Jordan to see what I mean. Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time, and may even be the greatest athlete of all time. He clearly deserves a spot on _this great sports monument. 
The next most obvious for me is Woods. I have heard people argue that even though he is the most dominant golfer ever, it is still just golf. One friend said that Mt. Rushmore is for presi­dents, and Woods is simply the greatest ever Secretary of the Interior. He is great for his game, but his game just doesn't have the prestige of the other, more mainstream sports. I however, think that golf is commonly considered a mainstream sport, and that Woods is so dominant that he deserves his face immortalized. 
For me, then, Ali and Ruth go in the same category. Both dominated their sport in their own time, and became the image for it as well. Although nei­ther has statistics that prove their greatness, at least not when compared to others, they truly transcended their respective sport. Thus, they deserve a spot on Mt. Rushmore. 
These four athletes would be my choices for the Mt. Rushmore of Sports. Feel free to disagree, however. 
Remember, it's just a meaningless and subjective argument.

Man celebrates birthday with 24-hour treadmill run 
BROOKLYN CENTER, Minn. -A Twin Cities man was looking for a chal­lenge, so he decided to cel­ebrate his 30th birthday by running on a tr~admill for 24 hours straight. B.J. Van Beusekom covered about 80 miles before he stopped running at noon Tuesday. He promptly went to the nearest chair and rested his obviously stiff legs. 
The 6-foot, 175-pound Van Beusekom took breaks 
only to use the restroom and change clothes. 
He accomplished his feat at Athletic Performance Inc., a training center in Brooklyn Center. To keep him motivated, API provid­ed a dance with a disc jockey, a slumber p~rty and a big screen television. 
For the rest of his birth­day, Van Beusekom says he just wants a nap and a massage. 
Van Beusekom 's effort also raised just over $3,000 for the American Lung Association.

Panel to discuss electric power 
Special to The Observer 
A panel of energy industry experts will discuss the future of electric power and energy Feb. 25 {Wednesday) from 3 to 5 p.m. in the Center for Continuing Education at the University of Notre Dame. 
The discussion, which will be led by moderator Joan F. Brennecke, Keating-Crawford Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and director of the Notre Dame Energy Center, is free and open to the public. 
The forum is part of the University's yearlong emphasis on global energy, which was introduced during the 2008 Notre Dame Forum on Sustainable Energy. 
Sponsored by the Energy Center and the College of Engineering and coordinated by Frank P. Incropera, the Clifford and Evelyn Brosey Professor of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Dean Emeritus, the panel features four experts in the field:

tionalist lines, according to Cunningham. 
"The pope's motivation was to get these people back under papal authority, so they're not con­secrating more bishops out­side the authority of the church," he said. 
Some critics have highlight­ed the decision as an exam­ple of the pope's conservative leanings, arguing that he would not be so willing to reconcile with fringe reli­gious groups on the left. But Cunningham denied that point and also noted that the pope's next encyclical will be about social justice. 
"The difference is that these liberal groups don't have bishops who are ordain­ing other bishops," he said. "In some ways, he does reach out to liberals." 
Cunningham 
said that the 
Vatican had been 
planning to take action to prevent schisms for some time. 
"I guess he wanted to get this done and maybe hadn't fully realized how much of a clamor it was going to cause," he said. "He'll proba­bly make some kind of amends about it." 
According to Cunningham, the pope_ must be careful about the image of the Catholic Church he projects to the rest of the world. 
"He has to think not only think of his position in the church," Cunningham said. "He has to think of himself as a symbol to the larger world."

and answer questions that the council had about the new Web site. 
The Web site is designed to allow students to find useful information about places and events off campus in one loca­tion, rather than having to visit several Web sites. 
CLC and the Office of Student Affairs are sponsor­ing the Web site that is tenta­tively set to launch in early March. 
The project was developed in part from the Good Neighbor Guide, the current booklet given to students that reside off campus. Instead of 
reprinting copies of the guidt~ from year to year, the Web site would Gnntain virtually all the information listed in the guide. 
Along with this information, the Web site will also incorpo­rate various other aspects of off-campus life. 
Information from the pres­entation given last Wednesday by attorney C.L. Lindsay about students' rights off campus will also be included. 
Members of COR suggested that an additional tab called "Entertainment" that lists bars, pubs, clubs and other

the site. 
Members also proposed a tab with links to shopping around the Michiana area. The shopping would include directions to Wal-Mart, Target and other places relevant to students. 
In addition, information regarding safety off campus will also be available. This will include a link to a crime prevention officer from the South Bend Police Department. 
Students will be able to e­mail the officer and ask to place their name on a listserv that will alert subscribers if a crime happens in their area. 
A listing of local cab num­bers was also recommended. 
Although the Web site was designed with the purpose of helping students off campus, members of COR felt that it would also benefit students who reside on campus as well. 
"I think that the Web site would be useful for people before they move off campus. Also, there are many people on campus who go off campus who could also use the site," junior class president Kim Kyrouac said. 
Since the Web site is also in part a conjunction with the Office of Residence Life and 
1000 and the valleys of 9000, who are involved in making political decisions," he said. 
"We are going to hope to build a structure that they can actually meet in, that they can have an office in," Masak said. 
Masak became involved in Peace Studies after working with Catholic Charities. He participated in a summer pro­gram where he worked with refugee placement in Allentown, Pa. 
"(When] I gGt there, and I was told I was going to be working with refugees and the immigrant population," he said.

President Reagan first enacted the Mexico City poli­cy, so named because it was unveiled at a United Nations conference in the Mexican capital city, in 1984. 
The policy has historically been instated by Republican presidents and rescinded by Democrat presidents. President George H. W. Bush kept it in place. President Bill Clinton rescinded the rule in 1993, and President George 
W. Bush reinstated it in 2001. 
Critics refer to the policy as the "global gag rule" because they consider its restrictions a violation of free speech.

don't think it's fair to cut off aid because of the abortion issue," she said. 
Lewis supports Obama's decision to lift the ban. 
"I think abortions should be reduced. I don't see a problem with Obama's decision," she said. 
Lewis also wrote in an e­mail: "Research suggests that actively addressing social problems ... is more likely to result in fewer abortions than just banning funding to groups that, among other services, provide access to abortions. Obama seems to understand that concept, and we support our president as he tries to tackle the serious social problems that face him." 
While Obama's act may be an effort to solve social issues, his decision hurts the American economy, Daly said. 
Housing, it will include a list 
of rules that apply to off-cam­
pus students as well as 
important rules from du Lac. 
One recommendation by COR members that will not be included in the Web was a classifieds section. The com­mittee who put the Web site together felt that certain pri­vacy issues could arise if stu­dents were placing ads for potential roommates.

LOS ANGELES -Where is the unlimited supply of diapers, formula and baby wipes? The free van? The brand-new house? 
Women who give birth to six, seven or eight babies are often showered with dazzling gifts from big corporations, local businesses and strangers. But that is not happening with the Southern California mother who delivered octuplets last week. 
The news that she is a single mother with six other children -and that all 14 were con­ceived by having embryos implanted-seems to have turned off many people, and companies are not exactly rush­ing to get publicity by piling on the freebies. 
Nadya Suleman, 33, has been lambasted by talk-show hosts, fertility experts, even her own mother, who has her hands full taking care of Suleman's other children. ages 2 to 7. 
A veteran Hollywood publicist said Suleman's handlers have their work cut out for them in trying to win public sympathy for her. 
"I think it's a calamity," said publicist David Brokaw, who has handled crises for celebri­ties. "I don't see, the way this is shaped, how you can say much about it in terms of something favorable." 
Makers of diapers, formula and other products would prob­ably want to steer clear of her, Brokaw said. He suggested she lie low for now and concentrate on crafting an image as a responsible parent. 
Gerber spokesman David Mortazavi said that if the baby­food maker was planning to do

Procter & Gamble spokes­woman Tricia Higgins said that the maker of Pampers does not actively seek out parents to sponsor, but that the octuplets' mother can ask for what is typi­cally provided in multiple births: a jumbo pack of diapers for each child, baby wipes, and coupons for discounts. That is unlikely to last ·suleman a week.

by Hamas-allied militants in Gaza since June 2006. 
"We are going to deal with all the issues as one package, because we are going to avoid the trap of gradual implementa­tion," he said. 
Hamas demands that any truce include the opening of borders into Gaza, which Israel and Egypt have largely kept sealed since the group seized control of the territory from the rival Fatah faction in 2007. 
Hamas also wants a role in administering the border cross­ings in recognition of its power in Gaza. 
Israel says it won't ease the 20-month blockade of the densely populated and impover­ished coastal strip without international guarantees that Hamas will be prevented from smuggling more weapons into Gaza. It does not want any deal to give Hamas a role in control­ling Gaza border crossings. 
Hamas remains committed to Israel's destruction and refused to renounce violence. Both the 
U.S. and Israel consider it a ter­rorist group. 
Egypt is also pressing Hamas to start reconciliation talks with U.S.-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to form a unity government that can negotiate peace with Israel. Abbas, a moderate, runs a rival Palestinian government in the West Bank that has been con­ducting peace talks with Israel for more than a year. 
But past attempts to broker a power-sharing deal among the rival Palestinians factions have failed. Prospects remain dim, with Barnas increasingly entrenched since its takeover of Gaza. 
So Egypt has focused on what may be a more limited goal ­installing forces loyal to Abbas at the border crossings. Egypt's proposals would include some form of symbolic llamas pres­ence at the crossings along with European monitors. 
Barhoum said the key to any truce is that Egypt open its crossing with Gaza, but added that the details of running the crossing into Gaza are open to discussion. 
In the Gulf emirate of Abu Dhabi, foreign ministers from Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other Mideast nations gathered Tuesday for a hastily convened meeting that represented a more assertive effort by pro­
U.S. Arab governments to push llamas toward an Egyptian­mediated truce -and away from Iran. 
It made starkly clear the split in the Arab world between U.S. allies and the pro-Iranian camp, particularly Syria, which backs Barnas and the Lebanese mili­tant group Hezbollah. Syria was not invited to the meeting-nor was Qatar, which has taken an increasingly pro-Hamas turn since Israel's Gaza offensive. 
"We have to ensure with our unity that unwelcome, non­Arab parties do not interfere in our affairs in an unneeded man­ner," the United Arab Emirates' foreign minister, Sheik Abdullah bin Zayed AI Nahyan, said in a clear reference to Persian Iran. 
Egypt, Saudi Arabia and allied Arab nations accuse Iran of using its alliance with Hamas to increase its influence in the region and gain a foothold on Israel's doorstep. Iran gives mil­lions of dollars to Hamas and is believed to supply the militants with weapons -though Tehran denies this. 
Jordan, Tunisia, Morocco. Bahrain, Yemen and Abbas' Palestinian Authority also attended the meeting.

Supplies tight for US troops abroad 
KABUL -U.S. troops in Afghanistan saw their supply lines squeezed from the north and east Tuesday after militants blew up a bridge in Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan's govern­ment said it would end American use of a key air base following Hussia's announce­ment of new aid. 
Securing efficient and safe supply routes into Afghanistan has become a top priority for U.S. oflicials as the Pentagon prepares to send in up to 30,000 more American soldiers this year. Some 75 percent of U.S. supplies travel through Pakistan, where militants have stepped up attacks on truck convoys destined for U.S. bases. 
Attackers on Tuesday blew up a bridge in northwestern Pakistan in a fresh salvo in an escalating campaign seeking to cripple Washington's war effort in Afghanistan.

"I've rested for 71fz years," Jara told reporters at the airport. "Now it's time to get to work."

The ousted governor showed up Tuesday for a taping of CBS' "Late Show with David Letterman." He laughed with the audience when Letterman mentioned watching him on several television talk shows.

Disease kills bats in northeast 
ROSENDALE, N.Y. -A mysterious and deadly bat disorder discovered just two win­ters ago in a few New York caves has now spread to at least six northeastern states, and scientists are scrambling to find solu­tions before it spreads across the country. 
White-nose syndrome poses no health threat to people, but some scientists say that if bat populations diminish too much, the insects and crop pests they eat could flourish. Researchers recently identified the fungus that creates the syndrome's distinc­tive white smudges on the noses and wings of hibernating bats, but they don't yet know how to stop the disorder from killing off caves full of the ecologically important ani­mals.

'Mother' of bomb network arrested 
Iraqi woman confesses to recruiting troubled women to be suicide bombers 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD -A woman accused of helping recruit dozens of female suicide bombers looked into the camera and described the process: trolling society for likely candidates and then patiently converting the women from troubled souls into deadly attack­ers. 
The accounts, in a video released Tuesday by Iraq police, offer a rare glimpse into the networks used to find and train the women bombers who have become one of the insurgents' most effective weapons as they struggle under increasing crackdowns. 
In a separate prison interview with The Associated Press, with interrogators nearby, the woman said she was part of a plot in which young women were raped and then sent to her for matronly advice. She said she would try to persuade the victims to become sui­cide bombers as their only escape from the shame and to reclaim their honor.

Minn. ballots disputed again 
Associated Press 
ST. PAUL, Minn. -The judges in Minnesota's Senate election trial threw Republican Norm Coleman a lifeline on Tuesday, opening the door to adding nearly 5,000 rejected absentee ballots to a race that Democrat AI Franken leads by just 225 votes. 
It wasn't a total victory for Coleman, who had wanted the judges to look at about 11 ,000 such ballots. He also has to prove the absentees were unfairly rejected, and it's likely that Franken would gain votes from the pile too. 
But his attorneys had said the absentees were the centerpiece of his court challenge, and they cheered the ruling. 
"This is a victory for thou­sands of Minnesotans whose rejected absentee baJlots will now be properly reviewed in this election," Coleman attorney Ben Ginsberg said in a pre­pared statement. 
While the judges limited Coleman's field of potential new votes, they allowed many more ballots than Franken had want­ed. His attorneys had argued Coleman should be limited to about 650 -the specific figure given in his initial Jan. 6 law­suit. 
The judges, however, ruled ballots we thought should be that the Jan. 6 filing laid out examined because they are additional categories of ballots valid.'' He said they never that should be examined. expected the rest to be brought

just put it this way -it was a list compiled by the Coleman campaign," he said. 
Meanwhile, in testimony at the trial Tuesday, Coleman's attorneys sought to show that different Minnesota counties applied different standards to rejecting absentees -the heart of their case in seeking a uni­
form standard on absentees. 
Kfwin Cnrhid, who supervises elections in Washington County, said his county decided on absentees with the best infor­
mation available at the time. 
But Coleman's attorney, Joe Friedberg, highlighted an area where Corbid's decisions appeared to differ slightly from his counterpart in a neighbor­ing county. 
Corbid testified he didn't make a special effort to accept previously rejected absentee ballots if he had reason to believe they were rejected because of mistakes by election judges. A day earlier, Ramsey County Eleetiuns Manager Joe Mansky testified he made a par­ticular effort to remedy such mistakes. 

Merkel: Pope must clarify bishop stance 
Associated Press 

BERLIN German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Pope Benedict XVI to make a "very clear" rejec­tion of Holocaust denials after the Vatican's rehabilitation of a former bishop who ques­tioned whether 6 million Jews were gassed by the Nazis. 
Merkel's rare and public demand came amid increas­ing outrage among Germany's Roman Catholic leaders over the German-born pope's deci­sion. 
Merkel said she "does not believe" there has been ade­quate clarification of the Vatican's position on the Holocaust amid the contro­versy over the lifting of the excommunication of British­born Richard Williamson. 
Benedict last week expressed "full and indis­putable solidarity" with Jews and warned against any denial of the horror of the Holocaust, but several leading German bishops have decried the decision and called for the rehabilitation to be revoked. 
The issue is particularly sensitive in Germany, where denial of the Holocaust is a crime and Roman Catholic leaders have worked hard to restore relations with the Jewish community. 
"I do not believe that suffi­cient clarification has been made," Merkel said. 
The Vatican moved quickly to counter Merkel's sugges­tion. · 
"The pope's thinking on the subject of the Holocaust has 
been expressed very clearly," said Vatican spokesman Hev. Federico Lombardi. 
He cited the pope's visit to a synagogue during his first visit to Germany as pope in 2005, a visit to Auschwitz in 2006 and his remarks during last week's general audience. 
"I hope that the memory of the Shoah leads humanity to reflect on the unpredictable power of evil when it con­quers the heart of men," Lombardi quoted the pope as saying. "May the Shoah be a warning for all against obliv­ion, against denial or reduc­tionism." 
Lombardi said that during the audience "the pope him­self clearly explained the pur­pose of lifting the excommu­nication, which has nothing to do with any legitimization of positions denying the Holocaust, which were clearly condemned" by Benedict. · 
Williamson was consecrated by the late ultraconservative Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre without papal consent, lead­ing to his excommunication. The Holy See has said that removing the excommunica­tion did not imply the Vatican shared his views. 
Merkel's stand was out of the ordinary, said Elan Steinberg, vice president of the New York-based American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors and their Descendants. 
"When the German Chancellor admonishes a German-born Pope it is an extraordinary message," Steinberg said in an e-mail to The Associated Press. 

Protestor hurls shoe at Chinese PM 
Associated Press 
CAMBRIDGE, England -A protester hurled abuse and then a shoe at China's premier Monday while he delivered a speech on the global economy at Cambridge University. 
The protester leapt up from his seat near the back of a crowded auditorium, blew a whistle and yelled that Premier 
Wen Jiabao  was a  "dictator"  
before  throwing  the  shoe  
toward the stage.  

"How can this university prostitute itself with this dicta­tor here, how can you listen...to him unchallenged," the man shouted. 
Like the now-famous incident when an Iraqi reporter threw his shoes at former President George W. Bush in December, the gray athletic shoe missed its intended target. 
China's media were silent on the Wen protest Tuesday, evnn 
though news organizations were quick to report the inci­dent involving Bush. 
Unlike Bush, Wen, who was standing on a stage behind a podium, did not need to duck. He merely paused for a few seconds before he continued with his speech. One of his aides quietly stepped on to the stage, picked up the shoe and took it away. 
Security staff escorted the protester out of the auditori­um. He was arrested and taken to a police station for question­ing on suspicion of committing a public order offense, said police spokeswoman Shelly Spratt. 
"The university is a place for discussion, debate and consid­ered argument, not for shoe throwing," said Tim II olt, a university spokesman. 
The shoe-throwing incident came at the end of a three-day visit to Britain dogged by 
demonstrations over human rights and Chinese policy in Tibet. Security was tight at the university and police kept a group of about 20 demonstra­tors away from the Chinese leader when he arrived for his speech. 
Shoe throwing has become a globally recognized form of protest since the case involving Bush. Iraqi reporter Muntadhar al-Zeidi was sched­uled to face trial in December on a charge of assaulting a for­eign leader, but the court date was postponed after his attor­ney filed a motion to reduce the charges. He remains in custody in Baghdad. 
In China, state-run newspa­pers and Web sites carried sto­ries Tuesday on Wen's speech but had no reference to the shoe-throwing. Content men­tioning it on Internet forums also appears to have been deleted.

US auto sales plunge to 26-year low 
DETROIT -Consumers frightened by the prospect of losing their jobs stayed away from auto showrooms again in January and sent 
U.S. car and truck sales falling 37 percent, a familiar refrain for the struggling industry but an unwelcome start to a critical year for U.S. carmakers. 
Devastated by an economy in which few peo­ple have the spare cash to buy a car or can obtain the financing to do it, Chrysler's domes­tic sales for January were less than half what they were a year earlier. 
Sales fell 49 percent at General Motors and 40 percent at Ford. Toyota and Nissan 's sales each fell at least 30 percent. 
"How many ways can you say disaster'?" asked Aaron Bragman, an auto industry ana­lyst with the consulting firm IHS Global Insight in Troy, Mich. "That's across the board. It's not , unique to one company." 
Wells Fargo cancels Vegas junket 
WASHINGTON -Wells Fargo & Co. abruptly eanceled Tuesday a pricey Las Vegas casino junket for employees after a torrent of criticism that it was misusing $25 billion in taxpayer bailout money. 
The company initially defended the trip after The Associated Press reported it had booked 12 nights beginning Friday at the Wynn Las Vegas and the Encore Las Vegas. But within hours, investigators and lawmak­ers on Capitol Hill had scorned the bank, and the company canceled. 
The conference is a Wells Fargo tradition. Previous all-expense-paid trips have includ­ed helicopter rides, wine tasting, horseback riding in Puerto Rico and a private Jimmy Buffett concert in the Bahamas for more than 1,000 of the company's top employees and guests. 
"In light of thr current environment. we have now deeided to caneel this event as well," the company said Tuesday night in a news release that also said the it had never plannf'd to use taxpayf'r bailout money for tlw trip.

Tax break approved for new car buyers 
Senate sets aside bipartisan issues to give tax deduction for sales of new autos 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Senate voted Tuesday to give a tax break to new car buyers, setting aside bipartisan concerns over the size of an eeonomic stimulus bill with a price tag edging above $900 bil­lion. 
The 71-26 vote came as President Barack Obama said he lies awake nights worrying about the econo­my and signaled he'll try to knock out "buy Ameriean" provisions in the legislation to avoid a possible trade war. 
Sen. Barbara Mikulski led the successful effort to allow many car buyers to claim an income tax deduction for sales taxes paid on new autos and interest payments on car loans. 
She said the plan would aid the beleaguered auto­mobile industry as well as create jobs at a time the economy is losing them at a rapid rate. "I believe we can help by getting the consumer into the show­room," she said. 
The provision was attached to the economic stimulus bill at the heart of 
Obama's e(~onomic rHcov­ery plan and is subject to change or even elimination as the measure makes its way toward final passage. 
Democratic leaders have pledged to have the bill ready for his signature by mid-month, and in a round of network television inter­views, the president underscored the urgency. He told CNN that even three months ago, most economists would not have predicted the economy was "in as bad of a situa­
tion as  we  are  in right  
"  
now.  
He  also  spoke  out  

against efforts to require the use of domestie steel in construction projects envi­sioned in the bill, telling Fox News, "we can't send a protectionist message." 
The stimulus bill 


remains a work in progress, following last week's party-line vote in the House and an Oval Office meeting on Monday in which Obama and Democratic leaders dis­cussed ways to reach across party lines. 
In a series of skirmishes during the day, the Senate turned back a proposal to add $25 billion for public works projects and voted to remove a tax break for movie producers. Both moves were engineered by Republicans who are criti­cal of the bill's size and voice skepticism of its abil­ity to create jobs. 
But several hours later, 
without explanation, GOP conservatives abruptly dropped their opposition to a $6.5 billion increase in research funding for the politically popular National Institutes of Health. 
Even so, Democratic leaders conceded they may soon be obliged to cut bil­lions of dollars from the measure. "It goes without saying if it's going to pass in the Senate, it has to be bipartisan," said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the sec­ond-ranking Democratic leader, adding that rank­and-file lawmakers in both parties want the bill's cost reduced. 
One Democrat, Sen. Ben

Nelson of Nebraska, said he hoped for reductions "in the tens of billions of dollars." 
The developments unfolded as more compa­nies announced job layoffs -including 5,800 ·at PNC Financial Services Group. In another sign of econom­ic weakness, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation predicted the cost of bank failures will exceed its estimate from last fall and urged law­makers to more than triple the agency's line of credit with the Treasury Department to $100 billion from the current $30 bil­lion. 

Government works on payrestrictions 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Obama administration plans to mandate new executive pay limits on Wednesday for government-assisted financial institutions in a new get-tough approach to bankers and Wall Street. 
"If the taxpayers are helping you. then you've got certain responsibili­ties to not be living high on the hog," President Barack Obama said in an interview Tuesday with "NBC Nightly 
..
News. . 
The president and members of Congress are weighing various pro­posals to restrict chief executives' compensation as one of the condi­tions of receiving help undPr the $700 billion linaneial bailout fund. 
Obama did not reveal details of the administration's compm1sation caps. 

But administration ofticials have said that the new restrictions would apply only to those struggling large firms that receive "exceptional assistance," such as the American International Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., and Detroit automakers. They would not apply to healthy banks that receive govern­ment infusions of capital. 
And Obama's chief economic advis­er, Larry Summers, has proposed that firms that want to pay executives above a certain threshold would have to compensate them with stock that could not be sold or liquidated until they pay back the government funds. 
Top oflicials at companiPs that have receivP.d money from the govern­nwnt's Tmubled Asset Helief Program already face some compensation lim­its. But eleetl'd oflidals want to place more caps. a sPntinwnt minforced in recent days by nwelations that \Vall Street firms paid more than $18 bil­lion in bonuses in the midst of the economic downturn in 2008.

The figure is equivalent to the salary of the president of the United States. 
On Tuesday, Sen. Byron Dorgan, D­N .D., introduced amendments to the Senate's economie stimulus legisla­tion that would n~quire firms that receive bailout funds to disclosP tlw bonuses they paid during the tirm~ they n~ceived governnwnt funds.

Tales from an 8th grade nothing 
Carl Sagan may have thought the cos­. mos worth analyzing, but I take a differ­
ent approach. Instead of looking out and 
up, let's look in and down. What can we 
learn about our world from the life of 
thirteen year 
olds? My con­
tention: Absolutely 
Everything. From 
my experiences as 
a summer camp 
counselor, I have 
seen that eighth 
graders truly are 
the unacknowl­
edged legislators 
of the world. They, 
in their interac­
tions, provide us 
with a microcosm 
of our day-to-day 
lives. And so I give you: Microcosmos ­
How 8th Graders Can Teach Us How Not 
To Live. 
Let's first look at Blaire and Jenna. 
Blaire is your average, run-of-the-mill 
cowboy who lives and works on his fami­
ly farm. Jenna is a big-city cosmopolitan 
(Arlington, VA-the biggest of the big 
cities). And the two fall in love. Now first 
of all, you know this isn't going to work 
out for these star-crossed lovers. They'll 
only be together for two weeks at camp 
and they come from families ideological­
ly at odds with each other. The farmer 
and the cowman should be friends, but 
the cowboy-farmer and the debutante­
Heaven forbid! As futile as their relation­
ship appeared, though, Blaire and Jenna 
were making it work. 
Making it work, that is, until Blaire 
decided it was over. lie pulled Jenna's 
best friend aside and told her to tell 
Jenna he never wanted to see Jenna 
again. This was on the last day of camp. 
Jenna's friend faithfully reported the 
news and Jenna cried from lunchtime 
until her parents came to pick her up at 
5 p.m. Blaire and Jenna-separated 
forever. 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 


So what can we learn from this first case? Men don't know how to handle relationships. Blaire didn't commit this folly because he's innocent, naive, or 13. He acted this way because this is the easiest way for a guy to get out of some­thing; he shirked responsibility to remove himself from culpability and feel­ing bad. I sec my guy. friends do similar things all the time. Like when my friend, who for the sake of argument we'll call Friendy-Pants, decided that he wanted to break up with a girl but couldn't do so face to face so he just stopped talking to her. 
Blaire and Friendy-Pants share the trait that all men share. We have an inability to confront the necessary. This may seem counter-intuitive to the macho-mystique that has built up around such figures as John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. But every time one of these actors actually did something active and direct it was probably only to cleverly avoid doing something else that would have bothered him emotionally. Remember, John Wayne built him an air­port and put his name on it only so he could fly away from his feelings. 
Now let's shift our evolving drama and look at Sammy and Jimbo. Sammy is a great kid with a lot of friends: one of the most well liked kids at camp (by coun­selor and camper alike). Jimbo is a qui­eter kid, but deliberately so, because he early on decides that he is better than everyone else. Sammy has a girlfriend; Jimbo does not. Sammy is the life of the party; everyone thinks Jimbo is a jerk. Then one night Jimbo decides to steal Sammy's letters from his girlfriend. 
Jimbo thinks that this will be the perfect way to get back at Sammy for all the popularity Sammy "stole" from him. Sammy, trying to get his private corre­spondence back, swats at Jimbo but inadvertently hits him in the throat. Jimbo starts hyperventilating and threat­ens to sue Sammy. 
The lesson here: we live in an extreme­ly litigious society. Anytime anything happens that could even be remotely considered assault, we go running for a personal injury attorney and sue, sue, sue! Then there are the counter-suits, and the counter-counter-suits, and so on. We just love making other people pay for our discomfort. Jimbo would not accept it was his own fault Sammy hit him; he should not have been stealing Sammy's letters. Instead Jimbo responded in the way any of us would have in a similar situation: "You attacked me. I'm not hurt. But I can get money from you if I claim that I was or still am." Just like the woman and the hot coffee that she was not expecting to burn her, Jimbo's rela­tionship with Sammy shows us how far we will go in our society to make other people feel bad for our personal misfor­tunes. 
In these two brief examples (in which I have explicitly changed names but not even slightly changed the details), I have shown you the extent to which eighth graders do in fact represent real people. Yet we look back on our eighth-grade selves and think, ~·wow, I was really lame back in eighth grade. I'm so much more mature now than I was then. I'm glad I never have to be in middle school again." 
But think about it. Really think about it. How much have you actually matured in the past six, seven, eight years? After living with thirteen year olds for three summers straight, I have re-evaluated my own early teenage years. And I real­ize I'm the exact same person doing the exact same types of things. Why don't you take the time to reflect on the same question... 
Yeah. That's what I thought.

If this seems hard to believe, it seruor is because it is simply not true. Look no Stanford Hall further than the University's Annual Feb. 2 
Choose your battles wisely 
This viewpoint is in response to the letter written by Ms. Hass, Ms. Quiros and Mr. Angulo entitled "Why is Notre Dame Involved in the Arms Trade?" (Monday, Feb. 2). In simple terms, the mission of the United States military is to be ready to respond in full force to any conflict in the world as quickly as possible, which usually means putting bombs on target within a day of the order given by the civilian leadership of this coun­try. 
Many different companies, such as Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Boeing, who all recruit at Notre Dame, are just as vital to that operation as Raytheon. If you have an issue with Raytheon's bombs and missiles, then you should also have an issue with all of those companies, as their weapons systems allow for the delivery of those bombs and missiles. However, I rarely see anyone writing in about the atrocities of the F -22 Raptor or the B-2 Spirit, planes whose combined capability allows this nation's military to drop a Raytheon-made bomb anywhere in the world virtually undeiected. 
The vendetta that students at this University have 
against Raytheon is illogical. Raytheon is not even the 
largest defense contractor that this nation uses, and it 
receives many military contracts for products that are 
defensive in nature, such as radar systems, air traffic 
control systems, satellite systems, the list goes on. 'Raytheon is not evil. They build systems that the 

Soldiers, Marines, Sailors and Airmen on the frontlines 
need to accomplish their mission. 

\Vhether or not you agree with the foreign policy of 
our nation, it is largely the U.S. military's warfighting 
capability that allows that foreign policy to exist. If the 
problem you have is with the methods by which our 
military wages war, your concerns should not be direct­
ed at the University allowing companies to recruit its 
students, but at the U.S. government. The University 
cannot tell the D.O.D. whether or not they can buy 
weapons from Raytheon. 

If the D.O.D. feels that it needs certain weapons to 
accomplish the objectives outlined by the foreign policy 
of this nation, a foreign policy put in place by the law­
fully elected civilian officials of this country, then it is 
going to acquire those weapons from Raytheon. If Raytheon were to stop producing its weapons for the 

U.S. military and its allies because they could no longer recruit any engineers, two things would happen: Raytheon ·would go out of business, costing many peo­ple their jobs, and the weapons it made would then simply be made by another defense contractor. 
Raytheon, just like every defense contractor, needs intelligent and moral people with a good education to work for them. Notre Dame offers some of the best, brightest and morally sound students that this nation has to offer, which is why so many defense contractors recruit here. Raytheon is no different than other defense contractors, and therefore has the same right to recruit engineers and students from this University as any other corporation. At the very least, don't start a movement that could cost some of your classmates future job opportunities with a very reputable compa­ny.

After "24: Redemption," a special television event that aired between Days 6 and 7, Day 7 began on Jan. 11 of this year. The premiere was actual­ly delayed by a year due to the strike by the Writers' Guild in 2008. Day 7 has seen Jack officially on trial for tor­ture, having turned himself in to the 
U.S. Marines at the end of "Redemption" after being subpoe­naed. The day has begun at 8 a.m. with a kind of reboot for the series. While "Redemption" saw Jack repen­tant and ·pensive, helping orphans in Africa and living away from direct involvement with CTU, Day 7 brings this enigmatic action figure back to the real world. 
Whether or not-Jack will have to atone for his political actions in a post-Bush diplomatic world remains to be seen. As the season began its Day 7. FBI agent Renee Walker (Annie Wersching) was pulling Jack out of his hearing to work against the African terrorist groups that originally sur­faced in "Redemption." With a renewed focus and a few new charac­ters, including new president i-\llison Taylor (Cherry Jones), Day 7 may prove to be the most intriguing yet.

Intriguingly, like .most things on TV, the show itself is a kind of advertise­ment. Opening with a recreation of a 1979 Chane] No. 5 Chanel commer­cial, "Trust Me" then becomes an excellent example of the placement ad, as Starbucks and Apple fill the screen. 
"Trust Me" doesn't quite find its legs in the first episodes. The balance between comedy and drama was off. the characters were a little too one dimensional even for the first expo­sure, and all that witty banter fell a little flat. The second episode had more momentum than the first, and definitely had more laughs, wisely pulling. the. show in a more comedic·_ direction. It also introduced more characters, such as Mason's wife Erin (Sa.rah Clarke), that should help add interest. The show has a lot of 
g~n1nd to cover before it nears great, _ but all that potential remains. "Trust , Me" could be worth holding onto.

New on FOX this year is the hour ong drama series "Lie to Me" which llows the story of Dr. Cal Lightman Tim Roth) a deception· expert who, ou guessed it, can tell when people lying. He helps uncover the truth r anyone who needs it, including the BI,-local police, lawyers, corpora-
ions, and individuals. The show is nspired by a real-life behavioral sci­stand premiered on January 21st. 
The real expert is Dr. Paul Ekman, who can read clues fixed on the human , body, and voice to expose the dif­rence between truth and lies during ·a criminal investigation. Previews of ·"Lie to Me" demonstrate Dr. Lightman the same· techniques as he ana­yzes a criminal's face, body, voice and eech. He reads his subject's feelings help solve cases. While on the job he ight face skepticism from law nforcement officials, but he is usually orrect. However, outside of the office, ightman's ability can be a curse ecause he is constantly aware of ether or not his friends and family telling the truth. He even cannot elp but notice tpe involuntary body 
anguage of strangers on the street. Dr. Lightman, together with his team, 
forms the Lightman Group and they act as human polygraph machines. Lightman and his partner Dr. Gilli Foster (Kelli Williams), a gifted psy­chologist; run the Group. Together they have impeccable insight of human behavior. Roth, a Qu~ntin Tarantino favorite, and Williams of "The Practice" fame make a dynamic duo. 
Rounding out the team is Eli Loker (Brendan Hin.es) as the lead researcher. Loker is uncomfortable with the excessive amount of lying he witnesses on the job and decides to try "radical honesty." Of course, being brutally honest causes trouble. Then there is the "natural," Ria Torres (Monica Raymund) the newest member. of the Group who has an innate ability to read people. 
The ratings for the series premiere were quite respectable, as it held its own against ABC's established show "Lost" and 13 episodes of the drama have been picked up. Of course, "Lie to Me" did have a good chance at early success since it premiered in the: extremely coveted post-"American· Idol" spot. 
Discover the truth with the cast of. "Lie to Me" Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on FOX.

"Burn Notice" loses nothing over the mid-season break. Two episodes in, the series has not lost any momentum.

Not that it mattered. Many just wanted to be part of the festive atmosphere and have the chance to revel in the team's 27-23 victory over the Arizona Cardinals in Sunday's Super Bowl. Rousing chants of "Here we go Stef3lers!" pulsed through the crowd as they waited for the team to make its way along the route. 

"We're going to tell the school we had fever -Steeler fever," 12-year-old Rachel Russell said, excusing her absence from school before leading a Steelers chant.

IN BRIEF Ramirez rejects latest offer 
from persistent Dodgers 
LOS ANGELES -The Dodgers are still trying to bring back Manny Ramirez. Only the enigmatic slug­ger doesn't like their latest deaL 
He rejected their third offer -for one year -that would have made him baseball's second-highest paid player behind Alex Hodriguez. 
That leaves Ramirez unsigned three months after deciding to test his value in the recession-plagued free agent market, with the Dodgers the only team to have con­firmed making any offers. 
"We have interest in signing Manny," general manager Ned CoJietti told The Associated Press in an e-mail Tuesday. "We don't have a deadline but these situations can 
change in  an  instant and either  
side  can  change  them  in  an  
instant."  

The Dodgers open spring training for the first time in Arizona on feb. 14. 

Fans filled parking garages, skyscraper windows, bal­conies and even climbed trees to get the best view of the team they love and possi­bly find shelter from the spo­radic flurries and tempera­tures that hovered in the mid­20s. 
"It's never too cold to watch the Steelers," said Annette Mowery, 4 7, who drove from the Pittsburgh suburb of Mars with her children, Lexie, 12 and Lucas, 10. 
"We didn't have a good day, we had a great day. It's hi'>to­ry," Lucas said, a Super Bowl XI JII hat perched atop a blue ski mask, a matching T-shirt squeezed over hL'> jacket.

Moorad reaches deal to

SAN DIEGO-In a move that could prop up the team's sagging on-field fortunes, former agent Jeff Moorad reached an agreement Tuesday for his group to buy the San Diego Padres from majority owner John Moores. 
Moorad, who resigned last month as chief executive officer of the Arizona Diamondbacks, and his group will acquire 100 percent ownership during a period of up to five years, subject to approval by baseball own­ers. 
Mom·ad heads what he has called a "small but significant" group of investors that has had an exclusive right to negotiate with Moores since early January. Moorad hasn't identi­fied any of his partners. 
"The deal with Jeff has been signed," Moores said in an e-mail to The Associated Press. "I will remain involw~d with the dub for-the next few years -but r absolutely dread think­ing about the last day. Life goes on."

Tomlin couldn't stop smil­ing as he was greeted on stage at the end ofthe parade route with thunderous applause. 
"What do you say to this?" Tomlin asked the massive crowd. "Steeler Nation, you leave us all speechless, man, we just appreciate the love. I low about the Steelers? I low about the greatest fans in the world? How about number six? Thank you, we love you guys." 

Hornets' Paul day-to-day
with mild groin strain 
WESTWEGO, La. -Chris Paul laughed and joked with teammates after Hornets practice on Tuesday, the grim silence that followed the All-Star point guard's injury and his team's ensuing collapse a night earlier fading into memory. 
New Orleans learned while blowing a big lead to Portland on Monday night that adjusting to life without Paul may be even harder than imag­ined. 
The good news for the Hornets is they may not have to endure without him for much more than a few games. An MRI indicated that Paul had only a mild strain of his right groin and he is listed as day-to-day. 
"I feel good," Paul said. "Maybe I can play (Wednesday), maybe Friday, so I'm going to just go with it and see how it fef~ls. ... Any time something's torn or something like that. it can be a long time, but this right here. I felt like that was good news."

Selig to take wait and see approach on MLB salary cap 
Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE -Baseball commissioner Bud Selig says the game's economic struc­ture has come a long way and still could use some tinker­ing. 
And while the man who bought the Milwaukee Brewers from Selig's family, Mark Attanasio, has suggest­ed a salary cap might be the solution, Selig isn't ready to take a stand on an issue that could revive dormant ten­sions between owners and players. 
The current collective bar­gaining agreement doesn't expire until 2011, and Selig suggested securing long-term labor peace with continued economic reforms could be his final major achievement as commissioner. 
"The last year of my com­missionership will be devoted to that," Selig said Tuesday during a seminar with stu­dents at Marquette University's law school. "So there's no sensf~ in me sitting here today and engaging them on (a salary cap). We'll just watch how the system develops and what we need to do." 
Whatever economic tweaks to the game might be forth­coming, Selig said they will be made with one goal in mind. He calls it hope; others might call it parity. 
"Our job is to give hope and faith in as many franchises as possible on April 1st." Selig said. "That's the intent." 
Toward that end, Selig praised measures baseball has taken to help teams in smaller media markets com­pete with big-market teams, such as revenue sharing and a luxury tax on tPams with lofty payrolls. 
Selig used Tuesday's hour­
long session with students to 
make the case that baseball 
is stronger than ever despite 
increased competition from 
an ever-expanding universe 
of entertainment options. 
Selig said baseball is "more 
popular than it's ever been" 
in the U.S. and has signifi­
cant growth potential over­
seas, adding he would like to 
see games played in Europe. 
Selig also went out of his 
way to praise franchise own­
ers for showing restraint on 
ticket prices. By his own 
count, Selig said eight clubs 
have cut ticket prices, 15 or 
16 have kept them the same 
and others have raised prices 
"very judiciously." 
But when asked afterward 
about his personal economic 
well-being, Selig was less 
forthcoming. 
Selig brushed off a question 
about this week's revelation 
that he made nearly $17.5 
million in 2007, according to 
Major League Baseball's lat­
est tax return. 
Is that commensurate with 
the success the game is expe­
riencing? 
"I let others make that 
decision," Selig said. ''I'm not 
going to comment on that." 
Selig also sidestepped 
reports that financially trou­
bled Citigroup was rethinking 
its sponsorship of the New 
York Mets' new stadium. 
"Believe me, that's a very 
complicated issue," Selig 
said. 
Nor was Selig ready to offer an opinion on a salary cap, an idea recently put forth by Attanasio after the New York _Yankees snapp(~d up Brewers ace CC Sabathia as part of a three-player, $423.5 million 
frPe-agent spending spree. 
''I'vt~ talked to Mark about that, and I've talked to other 
owners," Selig said. "But I'm just not going to comment on that. ... The cap has been talked about a lot. All caps are different. Some of them have worked, some haven't." 
Teams already have been more cautious with their money this offseason because of concerns about the slump­ing economy, and almost half the players who filed for free agency remain unsigned. Manny Ramirez, Ben Sheets and Adam Dunn are among the players still on the mar­ket, and the players' union is keeping a close eye out for evidence of collusion. 
"We are, as always, looking at the market," union head Donald Fehr said in an e­mail. "When conclusions are drawn, it won't be a secret." 
Selig pointed to the success of the Brewers, who made the playoffs for the first time since 1982 last season, and other small-market clubs as evidence that revenue shar­ing and the luxury tax already arc helping to level the playing field. 
"There's more competitive balance than ever in the his­tory of baseball," Selig said. "The reason you're seeing small-market teams do better is because the economic sys­tem allows them to be bet­ter." 
Selig said the outlook for small-market teams is far dif­ferent today than it was in the 1990s, when his family 
still  was  running  the  
Brewers.  
"We  didn't really  have  

much of a chance," Selig said. "We couldn't say that, but it was true. Today, they do. And can it be made bet­ter'! We'll se~. I meant what I said today. I'm just going to watch it. We've got three more years."

AC Milan hopes to keep English superstar 
Associated Press 
MILAN -David Beckham has the support of AC Milan's coach and management if he wants to get out of his Los Angeles Galaxy contract to stay in Italy. 
Beckham is halfway through a three-month loan with Milan that will end on March 8, and he's told the Italian media he's enjoyed his return to Europe more than he expected. While he respects the five-year con­tract he signed with Los Angeles in 2007, Beckham said playing for Milan was "something spe­cial." 
The Galaxy has reiterated that it wants Beckham, who has two goals in five games, back when the loan ends. 
But Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti, who has been surpris­ingly in1pressed by Beckham, would like the England mid­fielder to remain at San Siro. 
"Nobody can tell what will happen after March 9," Ancelotti told Sky TV Italia. "He wants to stay here, he has not hidden that fact, but it is a problem between him and LA Galaxy. As a club, we cannot get into this matter. 
"Beckham has given a new push to the team in terms of quality and enthusiasm," Ancelotti added. "He has given the team something extra and certainly if he stayed it would make it easier to win the scud­etto (the top Italian league title)." 
Beckham has had such an impact that he was included in Milan's 25-man roster for UEFA Cup games against Werder Bremen on Feb. 18 and 26. 
"l am realistic about his future," Ancelotti said. "I knew that he will be with us until March 9, that is for certain, so we will have to make the most of him during his time here. 
"He has given the team all his quality, by his work rate, his tal­ent, his assists and the goals he has scored. He has made an unexpected contribution." 
Vice president Adriano Galliani said the financial bene­fits of Beckham's presence have also boosted the club. 
"I think he does (want to stay), but I can only speak of what the club wants to do and Milan will do everything possi­ble to have Beckham after March," Galliani told La Gazzetta dello Sport. 
"It is evident that our will is there to keep him until the end of the season or even on a per­manent transfer. There is hope, but contracts have to be hon­ored. If the Galaxy want to start negotiations we will be happy to try, but they are right, the agreements are clear -on March 9 Beckham must return to America." 
In January, he played in a lucrative friendly with Hannover, and was expected to play some part in a friendly against Rangers in Glasgow on Wednesday. 
"(Beckham's marketing appeal) exists and we under­stand it following the many requests we have received to play friendly games, but it is not only his presence which attracts other clubs," Galliani said. "We have a group ofstars."

After Kobe's royal performance, Knicks brace for Kffig James 
Associated Press 
GREENBURGH, N.Y. -The scoring record at Madison Square Garden lasted more than 24 years, even with­standing a famous challenge from Michael Jordan. 
Now LeBron James can seize it from Kobe Bryant after just two days. 
Of course, he'll need to score 62 points to do it. 
"We set the bar up high for him. He'd have to play really well," New York coach Mike D'Antoni said Tuesday.

2010, and the Knicks have positioned them­selves for a run at him by clearing salary cap space for that summer. The Knicks still hope to get far enough under the cap to offer maximum deals to two superstars, hop­ing they can convince a Chris Bosh or Dwyane Wade to join James in New York. 
"That's a long ways off, so that's not our focus," D'Antoni said. "Our focus is to win that game." 
James had only 26 points in his November visit, but he sat out the fourth quarter of Cleveland's 119-101 romp. He's less likely than Bryant to have huge scoring nights because he tries to do so many other things -he had 10 assists and eight rebounds in his 50-point game here ­but his size and strength could make him a more diffi­cult matchup for the Knicks.

DePaul trailed by 18 points in the first half and was able to cut the margin to five at halftime. The Golden Eagles went back ahead by 11 early in the second half. The Blue Demons were within 62-54 after two basket'i by Mac Koshwal, but a 3-pointer by McNeal made it 65-54 with just over 5 minutes remaining and Marquette remained in control fi·om there.

While most people may focus on the "swimming" aspect of the Notre Dame swimming and diving squad, the Irish divers have also been doing their part in helping the team towards a 13th consecu­tive Big East title. 
Former Chinese national coach Caiming Xie, currently in his 31st season with the Irish, has led his divers to both All-Americans awards and Big East Championships. Caiming has also earned some accolades himself, being named Big East Diving Coach ofthe Year five times. 
"In Big East competition, the only events are the 3-meter and 1-meter springboard dives" Caiming said. "But our women's divers have been doing very well, winning many dual meets with some big competition like Northwestern and Michigan State." 
This year is no exception, with two outstanding divers leading the way for Notre Dame in the pool and on the springboards. Sophomore Heidi Grossman and junior Natalie Stitt have been leading the Irish all season. 
"Natalie and Heidi both have potential to win the Big East, and both qualify for NCAA diving Championships," Caiming said. "I believe they will do very well at the conference championships this year." 
At the recent Shamrock 
Invitational, the Irish divers navi­
gated through a strong field of 
competitors from West Virginia, 
Denver and Michigan State to help 
the team improve to 6-2 on the 
season. 
In the 1-meter dive, Grossman took first with a score of 280.70, followed closely by Stitt, who earned a mark of 273.20 to take second place. The results were similar in the 3-meter, where Stitt placed first with an impressive 307.OS, and Grossman snagged second with 291.10. 
These are just 1\\'o more excel­lent performances added to a multitude of wins and top-three performances that the duo has racked up throughout the regular season, including wins over Toledo, then-No. 21 Northwestern, Pittsburgh, and Louisville. 
In a sport with only 19 total events, the ability to dominate two of those is essential in the tight Big East. Ac;; the IrLc;;h prepare for the post-season, Still, Grossman and the rest of Notre Dame's Women Divers will be an essential part of the Championship seeking team. 
Caiming, along with first year swimming head coach Brian Barnes, are certainly sharpening up in these final weeks to prepare for a dominating performance as the postseason starts in two weeks.

Raiders plan to keep Cable as HC 
Associated Press 
OAKlAND, Calif. -The Oakland Raiders retained head coach Tom Cable on Tuesday, officially remov­ing the interim designation from his title more than five weeks after their season ended. 
Cable went 4-8 after replacing Lane Kiffin with the Raiders.{S-11}, who have lost at leac;;t 11 games in six consecutive years. Cable, Kiffm's former offensive line coach, rallied Oakland to back-to-back victoriAs to And last season. 
Raiders owner AI Davis inter­viewed a handful of candidates for the job, but never seemed seriously inclined to replace Cable, valuing his organizational loyalty and lead­ership. Davis spoke to New York Giants offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride and Green Bay assistant head coach Winston Moss before sticking with Cable, the former Idaho head coach who joined the Raiders in 2007. 
Cable's hiring, to be announced at a news conference on Wednesday, will bring some stabili­ty to a coaching staff that's already undergoing wholesale changes even with Cable staying in charge. Cable, who represented Oakland at the Senior Bowl in Alabama last month, has argued that keeping him would bring stability to a club already on its fifth head coach since 2003. 
But several key assistant coaches who finished the season under Cable's leadership already have left the Raiders for new jobs, including defensive coordinator Rob Ryan {Cleveland), offensive coordinator Greg Knapp (Seattle), special teams coordinator Brian Schneider (Southern California), running backs coach Tom Rathman (San Francisco) and linebackers coach Don Martindale (Denver). 
While waiting to announce Cable's hiring, Davis filled several positions on the Raiders' new staff, hiring a few new assistants and retaining several others. Oakland notably picked veteran offensive coach Paul Hackett to be JaMarcus Hussell's quarterbacks coach. 
With a head coach finally in place, the Raiders can get to work hiring coordinators. They're also deep in preparations for ·the draft., in which they have the seventh overall pick. 
Cable went 11-35 in four seasons in charge at Idaho from 2000-03 in his only previous experience as a head coach before Dm,is promoted him to replace Kiffin, who was fired Sept. 30 after a series of embarrassing public disagree­ments with Davis. Cable spent 2006 as Atlanta's ofl'ensive line coach following two years as UCLA's offensive coordinator.

I personally fling their order according to would love to end my career the finish in meets. Bulfin ·at the NCAA Championships believes that this competition in College Station, Texas." has helped the team succeed. 
One of the most impressive "I think that one of the aspects of the Irish's domi­main reasons for the success nant stretch is the relative of the team this year has youth of the team. Of the been the level of competition Irish's six divers, B ulfin and in practice," Bulfin said. "The been a point of emphasis all season, the Irish have strug­gled under their own basket of late, allowing 78 to Rutgers, 67 to St. John's and 75 to Marquette before giving up 82 points to Pittsburgh Tuesday night. 
McGraw said she does not know how she plans to fix the defense before Notre Dame's next game, Sunday at home against DePaul. 
"We're gonna watch film tomorrow [Wednesday] and decide that tomorrow," she said.

guys on our team are very talented and when some of your biggest competition is right in front of you everyday, it really keeps you motivated to get better each practice. We are each others' biggest fans and also our biggest competitors -it is a great dynamic." 
As the season approaches its end, the Irish diving squad does not plan to cool off. 
"We have two or three meets left this season," Bulfin said. "First we will head to the Big East Championships -we really want to take five of the top eight spots at this meet. It is a pretty high bar to meet, but I believe we can get it done." 
After the Irish compete at the Big East championships, they will compete in the NCAA Zone meet, which Bulfin thinks will serve as great experience for the younger divers. Finally, the team is looking to send one or two divers to the NCAA Championships at the end of March.

something that hasn't, or won't happen with this year's squad, according to senior Zach Hillesland. 
"I think it's a good point of comparison to see the psyche of this team compared to the psyche of that team because that team was falling apart a bit at certain places," Hillesland said. "I think, look­ing at our guys, everyone seems like they're still on board and everyone's ready to go. So, this group is ready, they're mentally tough and we're going to go out and keep fighting." 
And why is this team able to avoid this internal disruption that happens when teams fall short of expectations? 
"I think as a group we're closer and have a better line of communication between everyone on the team between the players and the coaches," Hillesland said. "Everyone's on the same page. We know what has hap­pened, we're going to be hon­est and up-front with it. 
"We know what we need to do and there really isn't any bickering or behind-the-back finger-pointing." 
Part of that honesty is rec­ognizing that Notre Dame 
isn't going anywhere unless its post defense and rebound­ing improve. Against Pittsburgh Saturday, the Panthers made fools out of the Irish on the glass, outre­bounding Notre Dame 49-30, with 22 of those coming as offensive boards. DeJuan Blair had 22 by himself. So far in Big East play, Notre Dame ranks 14th in rebound­ing defense. This has been a point of emphasis as Notre Dame prepares for Cincinnati. 
"They pose some problems with an athletic front line that we've had problems with keeping people off the back­board," Brey said. 
Cincinnati is led by guard Deonta Vaughn, who averages 
15.3 points per game. But if the Irish can contain Vaughn, it won't mean much if they can't rebound. If they can, Notre Dame may finally turn the page on a brutal first half Big East play. 
"I think we're ready to do it," McAlarney said. "No one likes to lose, and five in a row puts you at the point of God­knows-what. I think we're ready to do it. I think prac­tices have gone very well, very good lately, and it's just a matter of us translating that over to the game."

MEN'S BASKETBALL 
H~ops squad looks to get back on track vs. Cincinnati 
By CHRIS HINE Spons Writer 
Ever sine e Notre Dame's loss to Louisville on Jan.· 12, the Irish have been trying to turn the page, and start a :new chapter, a new winning streak. Too bad the pages have been glued together. 
Five straight games against ranked opponents, four against teams now in the top­tO, offered no respite, no easy wins, and in fact: no 
wins at all. 
"You know, I think after each loss, we've been trying to turn the page and get onto something different," Irish guard Kyle McAlarney said. "But I think nowt you've just got to forget about all that and you've got to just go out and play." 
Notre Dame's matchup Wednesday at Cincinnati rep­resents Notre Dame's best chance at a win since the Irish downed Seton Hall on Jan. 10, a win Irish coach 


NO WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
Senior guard nets 29 for Panthers, ensures Irish skid continues 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Wrirer 
Pitt guard Shavonte Zellous made sure that Notre Dame would not get out of its current funk, scoring 29 points in 31 minutes to lead the Panthers in their 82-70 win over the Irish. 
The loss was Notre Dame's fourth in its last six games. 
"Muffet on the losing streak," Irish coach Mufl'et McGraw said in a phone interview with The Observer Tuesday night. 
Zellous, the Big East leader in scoring, was one of four Panthers in double figures Tuesday night. Guards Xenia Stewart and Taneisha Harrison each put up 17 points and for­ward Shayla Scott added 11 for Pittsburgh in the win. 
"I thought Pitt came out ready to play. It was an important game and they came out like they wanted to win," McGraw 
Over--Zellous 
said. "They played harder than we did. Everybody for them stepped up and had a great game. They did what they need­ed to do; they rebounded, they scored." 
Similar to Notre Dame's most recent loss -a 78-68 home defeat at the hands of Rutgers -its opponents got an early lead with the 3-point shot. Zellous and Stewart each nailed a trey in the first 40 seconds of the game. 
Pitt stayed hot from beyond the arc all game, finishing 7 -of­12 from 3-point land. Zellous was 4-of-5 and Stewart was 2­of-3. 
On the other end of the court, Notre Dame's shooting struggles continued to show up in a big way, especially in the back-court. Guards Melissa Lechlitner and Lindsay Schrader combined to shoot only 6-of-26 during the game for 17 total points. 
The one bright side for the Irish. McGraw said, was the play of forwards Becca Bruszewski and Erica Solomon.

MEN'S DIVING 
Led by Bulfin, Irish divers make their mark 
By MlKE GOTIMER Sports Writer 
Although the Notre Dame men's swimming and diving team has experienced its ups and downs throughout its 6-6 season, the Irish have seen remarkable consistency from its divers. ~ 
In four meets since the start of 2009, the Irish have yet to drop either the 1-meter or 3­
.-meter diving events. Furthermore. the Irish have swept at least the top three spots in six of their past eight diving events, including two sweeps of the top-five and top-four spots. 
Leading the way for the Irish is senior captain Michael Bulfin, who has placed first in five of his six events in 2009. He also ranks third and sec­ond in the Big East in the 1­meter and 3-meter events, respectively. Sophomore Eric Lex trails Bulfin with two first place finishes while junior Caleb Dunnichay has one win in the new year. With numer­ous strong showings at this point in the season, the Irish believe that they are on their way to accomplishing the goals that they set for the sea-
see DIVERS/page 18 Mike Brey said seemed like it was "last season." But Brey said just because Cincinnati may not have the number next to its name doesn't mean you can automatically put one in the win column for Notre Dame. 
"You can't fall into the trap where just because Cincinnati's not in the top-10, you're not ready to compete," Brey said before practice Monday. 
The Bearcats posted a 65­5 7 win over Georgetown last 

week, but Villanova blew them out Sunday, 71-50. For the Irish to beat the Bearcats, they' 11 need to play well in every facet of the game for 40 m i n u t e s·, s o m e t h i n g t h e y haven't done in their current slump. 
"We've done stuff in spurts and then just kind of, orie important play, important rebound we just haven't been able to get, which was evident in the· Marquette and UConn game," McAlarney said. 
A loss to Cincinnati would 
not mean the end of Notre· Dame's season, but it would make the road the NCAA Tournament a lot tougher. Brey and Notre Dame's sen­
. iors were in a similar situa­tion three years ago, when Notre Dame couldn't buy a win, and suffered heartbreak­ing loss after heartbreaking loss, failing to make the NCAA Tournament. Each defeat wore on the team's chemistry and psyche,

SMC BASKETBALL 

SMC seeks conference win 
Belles will try to rebound after blo'lvout loss to rival Hope 
By BOBBY GRAHAM Sports Writer 
Coming into last Saturday's matchup again.,;t lloptl, the Bfllles had generated a considerable amount of momentum. 
After winning the first three 
· games of a grueling four-game road trip, including a tough over­time victory against Calvin, Saint Mary's was tied with the Hope's nationally ranked Dutch for the best record in MIAA conference play and a shut to go head-to-head for the regular season crown. However, despite the Belles' hot streak, they fell behind early in their matchup Saturday afternoon and could never regain their grip, falling to the Flying Dutch 84-59, Saint Mary's most lopsided loss of the sea.<><)ll. 

With their own fate no longer in their hand<>. Saint Mary's (11-8, 9­2 MIM) looks to help them<>elves out a'> much as they can as they face conference opponent Olivet Wednesday at 7:30p.m. 
The Belles' .first home game in nearly two weeks should offer the squad a nice change of pace as the countdown to the MIAA confer­ence tournament draws closer. Including Wednesday's matchup against Olivet, Saint Mary's has already played their next five opponent., at lea<>t once this sea­son. With a combined record of 4­1 against those teams, winning out is a possibility. Throw in a Hope loss, and the race for the mgular season conference championship would heat up once again. 
In order to make sure they don't lose their second straight, howev­er, the Belles will need to rejuve­nate their game on the boards. In la"t Saturday's loss to Hoptl, Saint Mary's was outrebounclfd 57 to 45, allowing the Flying Dutch 30 second chance points. Another strong outing from freshman Jessica Centa. who broke through with 12 points la<>t Saturday, would al.,._l help the Belles' cause.
