Brian McCarthy victorious 
By MIKE O'CONNELL News Staff 
The Student Senate run-off elections held Monday night saw Brian McCarthy defeat Jim McCarthy by a narrow margin of forty votes to be­come the new representa­tive for District Two. 
The votes tallied by John Wilson, President of the Om­budsman Society, gave Brian McCarthy a close vic­tory with 297 votes to Jim McCarthy's 257. 
The election was called after Mary Feliz, a junior from Breen-Phillips Hall, resigned from the Student Senate. 
"My immediate plans as Student Representative focus on the two new dorms, Knott and Siegfried," said McCarthy, "There are many new freshmen and transfer students who need to be made to feel welcome." 
McCarthy's plans include a big brother program for the new dorms and an out­door fitness course. McCarthy will represent St. Edwards, Zahm, Knott, Cavanaugh, Breen-Phillips, Siegfried, and Farley.

The percentage of American households in which the people who live together are related--by marriage or otherwise--has declined a fifth in the last 40 years, the Census Bureau said Monday. Families now constitute 71.5 percent of all households, down from 90.3 percent in 1948, according to new figures, which also showed the makeup of families continuing to change. The number of families without children at home exceeds the number of those with children at home by an even greater margin than· four years ago, when those without children edged ahead for the first time.-Associated Press

effect on administration 
Hello, I'm Michael Moran and I'd like to speak to the administration about ...(click) ... Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? 
The previous clip is fictional, but it describes the seemingly one-sided dialogue the students share with the administration. Sure, the Task­F6rces last year sought out student opinion, and it was repeatedly reported that student opinion was a major factor in the final decisions handed down this August. 
The fact is many students do not believe that student opinion had much to do with the deci­sions at all. The fact remains that the new policies implemented are not popular with the students. 
In the student media, there has been consi­derable student response to the new Alcohol Policy, but the students have not heard anyth­ing in response. In an editorial several weeks ago, The Observer directly expressed its dis­approval of the administration's lack of expla­nation of the rationale behind the new rules. As of this date, the administration has ignored that, and other, calls for a dialogue regarding the policy. 
In many of the students' eyes, the adminis­tration sought student opinion, then ignored it so they could hand down the stone tablet man­dates that they wanted from the beginning. Now the students are responding to the new policy, 
Mike Moran 


.!J~ 

but are not getting any response. 
Students see inconsistencies in the adminis­tration's policies. A dialogue needs to be taken up between the administration and the students to define more directly these inconsistencies, and search for ways of resolving them. One inconsistency is the censorship of liquor adver­tising in The Observer. A university is a place for the free expression of ideas, yet the admin­istration finds it acceptable to prohibit these ads. Do they really think that this will change attitudes about alcohol? Or is there a different motive behind this new policy? Nobody seems to know, and no one is telling the students. 
An inconsistency within this policy itself is that The Observer is allowed to advertise the Alumni-Senior Club (commonly known as Senior Bar), yet cannot do the same for its South Bend competitors. Why is this? We don't know, nobody is telling us. 
Another inconsistency is that students may not sponsor tailgaters, yft alumni can. There must be some fine print Ln the diploma! hope to recieve in May that states that I will then be mature enough to sponsor a tailgater. We don't know. Nobody is telling us. 
If they were really concerned with stepping in line with the Indiana State law like they say, wouldn't the criteria be whether you are twenty­one. 
The University tries to create an atmosphere that stimulates the social growth of the student. Despite the administration's implementing of programs that promote responsible drinking, their new policies are conducive to the opposite. They lead to fewer social events, i.e. SYRs, and will lead to larger off-campus parties, which leads to more drinking and driving. 
The worst part of the lack of dialogue from the administration is it makes students feel like they are beating on a brick wall. This will tend to discourage students from taking leadership roles on campus. If they feel that the adminis­tration will give them little freedom to act, why should students spend the many hours they do now, just to have the university interfere. 
Please, if anyone is home in the Administra­tion Building, respond to the student editorials and open a dialogue to continually review the policy.

Power outage due to fallen tree 
By MARK MCLAUGHLIN Senior Staff Reporter 
Electric power was lost throughout large sections of the Notre Dame campus yesterday after a fallen tree knocked out a feeder line from Indiana and Michigan Power, said Don Dedrick, director of the Physi­cal Plant. 
"A tree fell across a 4000 volt feeder line from I&M," said Director of Utilities John DeLee. "The spike from the power loss drained the 
generators,  and  four  feeder  
breakers."  
The  breakers  that  tripped  
were:

41 tornadoes sweep across Texas 
Associated Press 
SAN ANTONIO, Texas ­Tornadoes spawned by Hur­ricane Gilbert caused more than $35 million damage in this inland southern Texas city, ap­parently worse than coastal cities that faced the main storm, officials said Monday. 
Two people were killed in the 41 tornadoes that leap-frogged across the state. Heavy rain swelled rivers in some areas, but no injuries were reported. 
Gov. Bill Clements was to said that this is not a new policy, and applies to cars parked in any privately owned parking lot around Bridget's. "It (the policy) is like it has been for every year. People park where they are not sup­posed to be parked." When asked u people had been warned about this before, he replied, "It's been like this for three years now." 
Rozel Gatmaitan, a Saint Mary's student, was among those to have her car towed Thursday night. "No one warned me at all. I came out 
on the east side of campus; and 
Breaker 11, serving the Cen­ter for Continuing Education, part of Fitzpatrick Hall, and other buildings on the south side of campus. 
The areas hit by a power outage "depend on what breakers are set at the power­house," said DeLee. He added that the powerhouse staff tries to maximize the percentage of the Notre Dame generated power used, and buys the rest from I&M Power. 
The large voltage spike also shut down the number one boiler, said DeLee. "We have to wait until the boiler starts putting out steam again. Then we have to synchronize the 
generators with I&M again.

She was told that the only way she could recover her car was u she could pay the $50 fine immediately. Be­cause she was unable to pay at the time, she was told to come get her car Friday morning. 
Friday morning, when Gat­maitlin called about her car, her bill had risen to $65. When she actually came in to recover her car, the bill was at $75, and had been visibly changed, ac­cording to Gatmaitlin.

San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros toured tornado­ravaged areas Sunday, and said he wanted to extend his state of emergency declaration through Friday. 
The declaration will enable the city to try to seek assis­tance from the Small Business out. Then we can start reclos­ing the breakers," DeLee 
added. 
"The whole procedure was routine," Dedrick said. "Anytime we lose the I&M feed this scenario will follow." 
DeLee said the last time power was lost on campus was the first day of final exams last May. That time the I&M feed was also the problem. "Over the last five years we've lost the I&M feed about two times a year," said DeLee. 
These losses were normal, said DeLee, due to unforeseen accidents, and lightning. 
According to DeLee, Notre Dame generates about half its power requirements and buys the rest from I&M.

The combined math-verbal average of 904 marked the first decline in eight years. The na­tional average hit a low of 890 in 1980, recovered a bit to 906 by 1985 and was unchanged un­til this year's slight decline. 
Minority students in the class of '88, especially blacks, posted the strongest gains. Verbal scores among blacks last year rose an average of two points to 353, and math scores rose seven points to 384--doubly im­

WASHINGTON -At least 100,000 of America's children are homeless on any given night, the National Academy of Sciences estimated Monday. 
This statistic doesn't include those children who have run away from home or been kicked out by their parents. 
While male alcoholics and former mental patients still make up a large portion of the homeless, the fastest growing group of people with no place to live are children under 18, said the academy's Institute of Medicine. 
"The committee feels strongly that the growing phe­nomenon of homeless children is nothing short of a national disgrace that must be treated with the urgency that such a situation demands," said the report.. 

Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn, N.Y. hold funeral services 5,000 people turned out for the service in the heavily Sunday for six Torah scrolls that were burnt by van­Jewish Flatbush section. dals who broke into a synagogue. Approximately 
One recommendation aimed directly at helping children is the expansion of federal sup­port for enriched day care and Head Start programs, coupled with outreach efforts to make homeless parents aware of help available for their children. 
A recommendation for the homeless in general would be to permit the use of food stamps at restaurants so prepared meals will be avail­able to people who don't have ldtchens. 
The committee formed by the institute to do the study, which was ordered by 
"Those who stay in rural areas remain hidden until some event causes them to lose their housing, at which point they can be found living in, for example, cars, abandoned buildings, and woods," the report said. 
The study says the major causes of homelessness are: 
A 
decrease in the number of housing units for low-income people --2.5 ~illion fewer than in 1980--while the number of people who can only afford such units has increased be­cause of skyrocketing housing costs. 

A 
tightening of eligibility for public assistance programs as well as a decline in the value of such assistance. 

Policies 
of state mental hospitals, general hospitals, rehabilitation facilities and some jails and prisons that have fewer people admitted and free some who were previ­ouslv held.

1P.O. Box Q 

Student justifies denial of movie 
Dear Editor: "' 

I remain unabashed by the Sept.l3 column by Mr. Victor J. Krebs. I readily admit that I have not seen "The Last Temptation of Christ" and yet I confi­dently assert that it is blasphemous and therefore ought not to be patronized. Not having seen the film, I make no claim about its craft except that, com­ing from Martin Scorsese, I feel sure that it contains some very fine work. Neither do I challenge his First Amend­ment right to make such a film. These things are not at issue. In this film the integrity of the God1nan Jesus Christ is demeaned and denied. Out of respect for the one who offered his life that we might be free, we should avoid this pic­ture. 
If I closed here I should fall justly prey to Mr. Kreb's charge of "prejudice." He writes, "Back at Notre Dame I have met with a strange mix­ture of attitudes: indifference to the whole thing on the part of some (always a source of concern to me), but also fear--based primarily on prejudice--on the part of others. The answer is usual­ly: I have been told it's blasphemous, so I don't want to see it." 
Here I must confess that I have ac­cepted the word of some strangers. Per­haps the reader will not judge me too harshly, though. These strangers are journalists for Newsweek, 'fime, The Village Voice, as well as Victor J. Krebs writing for The Observer. What I have accepted from them is not their edito­rial bent but some facts about the movie and its contents. I am trusting that what these authors say is in the movie is ac­tually in it. Thus I believe Victor J. Krebs that in the film Jesus tells Judas "that God told him 'the plan only little by little."' Allow me to concentrate on one such fact. 
Mr. Krebs says that "Christ is pic­tured as having carnal desires." Andrew Greeley would agree with this description. In response to the question "Could Jesus desire a woman?" he says, "The Christian must say that of course He might. .." In the movie Christ is portrayed as visually fantasiz­ing about sex relations with Mary Mag­dalene. 
The idea seems to be that since Christ 
was a man, he must have been subject 
to concupiscence.

0I/..CO!rlmN!13S." 
/ 

Perhaps the meaning of concupis­cence is best explained by St. Paul's description of it in Romans as "a law of my members fighting against the law of my mind.'' This struggle is familiar to us. We have, all experienced the desire to do what we know we should not. We are truly imperfect vessels, subject to this unruliness of the pas­sions as a punishment for original sin. When our first parents fell, they lost for us the preternatural gift of integrity by means of which man's reason and will were in perfect harmony. 
What Scorsese andl Greeley either forget or deny is that even though Christ was fully huma:a, he was not just any man but was pel"fect man. Since he was free from any stain of sin he did not suffer the effects of original sin in his nature. He was fully and perfectly human without the lack of integrity, for, as the Scriptures say, he was "like us in all things but sin." If Christ had the "warring of the flesh," then he can no longer be seen as spotless but as stained by original sin. If Christ "was made lower than angels" in order to redeem us, it seems the height of in­gratitude and a weighty insult to portray him in our movie theatres as stained by original sin and thus lower even than unfallen man. 
Based on what we know without ex­periencing the movie first-hand, it seems best to avoid such an experience.

St. Mary's deserves credit for concert 
Dear Editor: 
Saint Mary's students grabbed their 
Observers on Sept. 14 around noon, as 
they do every day, but conversations 
didn't center around the Michigan 
game or new SYR regulations this time. 
Instead students were furious. They 
were enraged by the George Winston 
story headline on the Accent page. 
The first line of thE! story reads: "In­
ternationally renowned pianist George 
Winston will perform tonight at 8:00 
p.m. in O'Laughlin Auditorium," with a headline that proclaims the event as "An ND First." Thi.s is all fine, but Saint Mary's deserves all the credit. I realize that many ev,ents sponsored by Notre Dame are indeed held at O'Laughlin Auditorium on many occa­sions, but this is one that is not.. 
Randy Brown and the staff of O'Laughlin Auditorium should receive total credit for Mr. Winston's appear­ance on Saint Mary's campus. He is one of the biggest names we, as students, have had the opportunity to see in quite a while on either of the campuses. I feel The Observer has deprived Saint Mary's of this excitement by crediting Notre Dame for this sold out perfor­
mance. 

"Winston Cometh" has yet to be dubbed "An ND first!" As a member of the smaller and often silenced of the two schools making up this most pres­tigious community, I feel Saint Mary's has often been the victim of such abuse. I trust that this will not be taken offen­sively by the students of Notre Dame. We are proud to share our facilities with you as you have been generous in doing with us. All we ask is that credit be given where credit is due.

Economic facts may be slanted 
Dear Editor: 

I am writing in response to a Sept. 13 article by Business columnist Rich Coglianese entitled, "Let's talk eco­nomic facts concerning the 1988 elec­tion." 
Mr. Coglianese asks, and quickly answers, the frequently posed question, "Are you better off now than you were eight years ago?" His article is patently misleading and contributes to the myopic and illusory facade of eco­nomic success much touted in this, an election year. With partisanship aside, "Let's talk economic facts" as this writer challenges us to do. 
On Aug. 31, 1988, the United States Census Bureau reported that the proportion of white Americans living in poverty declined significantly during 1987. At first glance, therefore, it ap­pears Coglianese's conclusion is cor­rect. In that same report, however, the Census Bureau also noted that the proportion of black and Hispanic poor people increased. In short, the median incomes of white Americans increased in 1987 in terms of real dollars while those of black and Hispanic citizens declined. More precisely, the propor­tion of white Americans who were poor

in 1987 was 10.5 percent, or 21.4 million, as against 11 percent, or 22.2 million in 1986, while the proportion of black Americans living in poverty in 1987 was 
33.1 percent or 9.68 million as against 
31.l percent or 8.98 million in 1986. Mr. ' Coglianese's answer is simply wrong. 
We must conclude that the writer either failed to do his homework before summarily concluding that "we are better off" or his definition of who we are fails to include many less fortunate Americans. I sincerely hope Mr. Coglianese's error proceeds from his failure to adequately research the facts rather than from his belief that prosperity is measured only by a lim­ited universe of privileged white Americans.

GSU urges student input about film 
Dear Editor: 

The Graduate Student Union has 
recently cosponsored with the Student 
Union Board a trip to see "The Last 
Temptation of Christ" and an open dis­
cussion with participants from various 
disciplines. There has been much en­
thusiasm and support for this activity 
from many quarters. We have been 
made aware, however, that there are 
graduate students who do not think the 
GSU should cosponsor such an activity. 
In the past, disagreement with the ac­
tivities of the GSU has been answered 
with a withdrawal of the $10 voluntary 
fee from the GSU funds. 

The GSU is a representative organi­
zation, and as such it should act in ac­
cordance with the majority of its con­
stituency. If the GSU does not fulfill 
that role, it is our responsibility to make 
sure that it does. Withdrawing your vo­
luntary fee from the GSU funds hurts 
the GSU's projects, most of which are 
directed to the benefit of the graduate 
student population and the Notre Dame 
community as a whole. 

Help us ensure that your voice will 
be heard by making sure your depart­
ment sends a representative to the 
Graduate Student Council, where 
firsthand information is provided to all 
represented departments and where 
decisions of importance for graduate 
students are made on a monthly basis.

Races reveal depth of ND Sailing Club 
The Notre Dame Sailing Club displayed its considerable depth last weekend, performing well in a pair of races. 
The Irish sent squads to Iowa and Kent State to compete in separate regattas. 
In Iowa, Notre Dame placed third overall in a field of 10 teams, behind only Michigan and Wisconsin. In indi-

vidual results, the "A" team of Pete Wall and Paige Cooper took third, while the "B" tandem of Patti Losinske and Liz Beckley finished fourth. 
The Irish placed second in the seven-team event at Kent State. Michgan's Wolverines also won that race. Individ­ually, Tom Sessions and Betsy Lewis took second in the "A" race, and Chris Bloom headed a tandem that finished third in the "B" division. 
"I'm very happy with the sailing," club president Pete Wall said. "I was pretty pleased because Michigan and Wisconsin are two powerhouses in the Midwest. We hope to fare better against them in the future." 
The Irish will send a team to the women's regatta at Michigan this weekend and also will compete in the MCSA Sloop Championships in Detroit. 
The "C" squad of the Irish Rugby Club bounced back from a season-opening defeat to down Western Illinois Saturday, but the "B" team did not enjoy quite as much success. The "A" group did not play. 
The "B" team lost to Western Illinois 13-12 on a last­minute score to fall to 0-2. Notre Dame's "C" squad won by an easy 16-8 count. 
"The 'B' and 'C' sides looked really good," said club president Jim Lammers. "They showed a lot of intensity and made up for last week's performance." 
The Irish will host Kalamazoo Saturday behind Stepan Center, two hours before the Notre Dame-Purdue football contest. 
The Rowing Club will open its season Saturday in the Head of the Ohio, one of four races for the Irish during the fall season.

Belles share title with Butler 
By HEATHER ATKINSON Sports Writer 
For the first time in seven years, the Saint Mary's tennis team shared top honors in its own invitational. 
With an ending total of 36 points, Saint Mary's tied with Butler University for the number-one position. Of the seven participating teams, Saint Mary's was the only non­scholarship entry. 
"I'm really excited about the outcome of the tourna­ment,"said Belles coach Deb Laverie. "We've never finished any better than fifth place. Most of the players from the other teams are playing with full scholarships, so this was a great indication of our playing ability and how the rest of the year should look." 
Sophomore Sarah Mayer remains the only Saint Mary's player who has yet to be defeated in a match. Mayer lost

only nine games in the tourna­ment and defeated her op­ponent 6-4, 6-1 in the final match of the number-three singles competition. 
Many singles' players lost in the final matches of the tourn­ament, but turned in outstand­ing performances to contribute to the championship. 
Jen Block lost a close match 
in the number two singles final, 
7-5, 7-5. 

"Jenny played excellent ten­
nis all week," said Laverie. 
"Her final match came down 
to just a point here and there." 
In number five singles, Angie 
Mueller was defeated 6-3, 6-3. 
''She (Mueller) really lost a close one," said Laverie. "I'm proud of her effort. It's out­standing for a freshman to be in the final match." 
Marie Koscielski, also a 
freshman, fell in the finals of 
the number six competition, 6­
3, 6-3. 

Coach Laverie was espe­cially pleased with the doubles' matches. Mayer teamed up with Charlene Szjako for a good performance, but the duo lost, 
6-4,  6-3,  in  the  conclusive  
match.  
Block  and  Mueller  joined  

forces to win the consolation bracket, 6-4, 6-4, in number-one doubles. 
If Saint Mary's won the number-three doubles' match the Belles would tie for first. If they lost, the team would place second. Freshmen Koscielski and Ellen Mayer battled the pressure for a 7-5, 6-4 victory. 
"I'm extremely proud of the entire team," said Laverie. "This was the best tennis I've seen played by a Saint Mary's team collectively. Our goal at the beginning of this year was to be ranked in the top ten na­tionally. I think it looks very obtainable at this point." 
The Belles next match will be tonight at Anderson College. 
tential and below what we have worked all year to achieve." 
Things didn't improve much on Saturday as Saint Mary's fought its way to a third-place finish competing against eight teams. The Belles overall record for the day dropped to 2-2 as Aquinas of Michigan beat them in the semi-finals.

Matt Bahr added field goals of 21, 29 and 40 yards for the Browns, sending Indianapolis to its third straight defeat. 
Dickerson broke free for a 41­yard touchdown run in the second quarter that tied the game 10-10. He ran for 104 yards on 14 carries in the first half, but added only 13 yards on eight tries in the second half.

The Saint Mary's volleyball team encountered a tough weekend as it lost in league play to St. Xavier on Friday 
and  placed  third  in  the  liT  
tournament  Saturday  in .  
Chicago.  

The Belles started strong against St. Xavier and won the first game, 15-6. They folded under pressure as they were edged 14-16 in game two. St. 

Xavier took advantage of this and easily took game three 15­6. 
The Belles were not out of it, though, as they came back with a fine performance and a 15-10 win in the fourth game. This was to no avail, as St. Xavier got themselves together to take the last game and the match 15-7.

CLEVELAND-Mike Pagel, Cleveland's third starting quarterback in three weeks, threw for 255 yards and two touchdowns Monday night, and the Browns' defense virtually shut down Eric Dickerson in the second half Monday to beat the Indianapolis Colts 23-17. 
Pagel, pressed into duty be­cause of injuries to Bernie Kosar and Gary Danielson, showed no signs of rust despite starting for the first time since he was with the Colts in 1985. 

He completed 23 of 38 passes, including first-half touchdowns of 14 yards to Ozzie Newsome and 17 yards to Webster Slaughter. They were the first two touchdowns of the year for Cleveland, 2-1, and Newsome

Louganis wins another gold 
Sports Briefs 
Associated Press 
SEOUL-American Greg Louganis, performing with four stitches in his head, won the gold medal in the three­meter springboard diving com­petition Tuesday in the Sum­mer Olympics. 
Louganis hit his head on the board during the ninth dive of the preliminaries Monday and required four stitches. This time, he nailed his ninth dive en route to the gold. 
With the victory, Louganis became the only athlete to win two gold medals in springboard diving. 
Matt Biondi, lower­ing his sights from seven gold to seven medals, won his qual­ifying heat Tuesday in the 100­meter butterfly one day after Janet Evans gave America its first victory at the Seoul Olym­pics. 
While Evans won the 400­meter individual medley gold on Monday, Biondi had to settle for bronze in the 200-meter freestyle as his quest to equal Mark Spitz's seven gold medals in 1972 ended in his first race. 
"The Mark Spitz days are over," Biondi said. 
Boxer Anthony Hembrick's quest for gold ended without a punch as he lost in a walkover. He rushed into the arena, late for his fight, just as his South Korean opponent was being declared the winner. Hembrick left hurriedly, near tears. 
Another Olympic assault also was in jeopardy as Carl Lewis was close to losing his spot on U.S. relay team. That would cost him a chance to win four gold medals, as he did four years ago in Los Angeles. Sprint-relay coach Russ Rogers said Monday that Lewis would be dropped from the

team if he continued his dis­ruptive behavior. 
Lewis has argued loudly with his coaches over the role of his personal adviser, who has been banned from practices, and Rogers said: 
"He's at the end of his rope. The only thing he can do now is hang himself." 
A little Romanian gymnast, meanwhile, was evoking memories of a time 12 years ago, when a countrywoman no bigger than her captivated the world by becoming the original perfect 10. That was Nadia Comaneci; this was 4-foot-6 Daniela Silivas, who had lOs in the uneven bars and floor ex­ercise during women's team competition. 
The American gymnasts, in fourth place after compul­sories, were done in by their own mistakes and an East Ger­man protest. They still had a shot at bronze. 
In diving, U.S. gold medal fa­vorite Greg Louganis had a close brush with a board, but escaped serious injury. Leading the qualifying for the springboard and going for a second consecutive Olympic sweep, Louganis hit his head

while attempting a reverse 2%­sommersault in his ninth of 11 dives. 
He got out of the water with­out help, rubbed the top of his head and smiled. He scored a 6.3. 
He came back about a half­hour later, five stitches in his head, and mugged for the crowd before launching him­self into a near-perfect reverse 1 %-sommersault with 3112 twists. It earned 87.12 points, the highest score of the prelim­inary round, and he made Tues­day's final easily, where the scores start fresh. 
Mter two days of medal events, the Soviet Union led with six, two of them gold. The United States and China, with one gold apiece, were tied for second with four medals. 
Evans captured the women's 400-meter individual medley swimming event by nearly two seconds over world champion Noemi Lung of Romania.

Intelligence, discipline vital to Eilers' success 
By TIM SULLIVAN Sports Writer 
Pat Eilers has earned his playing time the hard way. 
The senior flanker from St. Paul, Minnesota, wasn't even offered a scholarship to Notre Dame after high school and. in­stead, attended Yale-not your national football powerhouse. 
Soon, though, he made a big decision, and he's been wearing the Irish blue and gold ever since. Neither he nor the Irish coaching staff could be happier. 
"I wasn't satisfied with the football program at Yale,'' ·said Eilers. "I decided that if I was going to do som~thing (with football), I wanted to play for a national championship." 
Eilers contacted Irish Head Coach Lou Holtz after his fresh­man year with the Elis, and then made the transfer. In­eligible for his sophomore year, he played impressively in his first spring practices and earned a scholarship. 
"He always gives it the best he has." said Irish receivers coach Pete Cordelli. "He works as hard as anyone and is al­ways trying to learn." 
Special teams became Eilers' home last season, as he led the entire squad in special teams appearances with 224, 64 more than any other Irish playet'. Eilers plays on all four Notre Dame special teams and has made his mark with numerous first hits, key blocks, and now even impressive returns. 
"Special teams are great," said Eilers, noticeably relish­ing his role. "It's a one-shot deal, full speed with reckless abandon. I think it's what foot­ball is all about." 
And the Notre Dame special teams have been outstanding so far-in no small part due to four units with attitudes like Eilers'. 
"Our goals are zero return yards," said Eilers, "and no blocks allowed. (Special teams) are a lot like offensive football where 11 guys have to do their job." 
While Eilers has grown ac­customed to his role on the spe­cial teams, he's just a new­comer to the the offense. Playing flanker and even occa­sionally in the wishbone back­field, he has seen consistent playing time. 

Holtz asked Eilers to make 
the move last December in Dal­
las and the stocky, 5-11, 197­
pounder hasn't looked back.

Pat Ellers 

"I wanted to do whatever was best for the team," noted Eilers. "Of course, you're al­ways looking for more playing time." 
Another new role for Eilers is as punt returner. He doesn't have the speed of a Ricky Wat­ters or a Rocket Ismail, but Co­ach Cordelli cites other, equally important skills. 
"His intelligence makes him effective," said Cordelli. "You've got to make intelligent decisions quickly. Intelligence plus great effort makes one heck of a football player." 
That inteligence could be fruitful for the Irish in another way as well. Because of his transfer, Eilers still has a year of eligibility remaining, and his academic pursuits should al­low him to play next season. 
Eilers will graduate in May 
with a mechanical engineering 
degree and hopes to return next 
year to complete a biology 
degree. The decision on his 
football career is in the hands 
of the Notre Dame administra­
tion. 
One issue that Eilers, as a 
receiver, has heard plenty of in 
the last two weeks is the pass­
ing game. Both he and Cordelli 
are committed to improve­
ment. 

"We've got to make the op­
position defend both (the run 
and the pass). We've got our 
mind set to get the passing 
game going. We'll do it." 
Eilers sounds sure, and noth­
ing has been able to stop him 
so far.

Dillon starts season with win 
By DAVE MCMAHON Sports Writer 
Although offense was hard to come by for some teams, Dillon survived its first test of the 1988 Interhall football season with a 7-0 victory over Off-Campus. 
In other Parseghian division games Sunday, Morrissey and Flanner fought to a scoreless tie and Keenan defeated Grace 14-8. 
"We played pretty well for our first game," said Dillon captain Paul Drey. "Our defense played a great game and the offense had a good first half." 

Gary O'Brien had the lone score for Dillon as he plunged in from the three yard line. 
Stanford defeated Holy Cross 23-0 and Cavanaugh and Zahm held each other scoreless in other Leahy division action. 
Quarterback Raoul Gonzales threw touchdown passes to Rob Merkle and Chris Moscardelli and Merkle ran for another as St. Edward's blanked Pangborn 18-0 in the Rockne division. 
"We have a lot more talent than we did last year," said Steve Schmidt, St. Ed's cap­tain. "We weren't to sure wl)at

Tim Kaiser scored on a boot­leg option for Fisher to tie Sorin 6-6. 
"Our defense played great and our offense got rolling in the second half,'' commented Fisher captain Jim Twecek.
