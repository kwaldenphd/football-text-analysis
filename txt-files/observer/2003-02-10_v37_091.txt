Leaders propose fee hike 
By MATT BRAMANTl 
News Writer 
Student government offi­cials will propose an increase in Notre Dame's student activity fee this week. This year's proposal, however, provides for small annual increases. instead of the larger. more infrequent hikes of the past. The financial Management Board, a unit of the Student Union Board, will recom­mend increasing the fee each year by 3/4 the rate of tuition increase. Tuition i ncreascs have generally been raised by 5 Lo 6 per­cent per year. 
This year's student activity fee was $80, compared to $65 of la~t yMr. The money is a key source of funding for student organizations. Amy O'Connor, chair of the Club Coordination Council, said the plan is necessary to promote the "overall finan­cial health of the student union." 
"Most student activities are under funded." O'Connor said. "Currently, tho student union is unable to meet the demands of the student body." 
She said that The Shirt project generates a signifi­cant amount of money for student activities, hut those revenues can be unpre­dictable. "If the market was saturated this year, we have

What are youlistening to? 
Did you know that you are possibly missing the best radio show streaming out of Notre Dame's Internet frequency, WVFI? The show I 
am referring to is "This is not America" brought to you by Llndsay Mollan and Kate Kala.sky every Monday from mid­night to 1 :30 a.m. 
The show brings the cool sounds of Brit Pop Rock to

favorite, David 8o¼1e. 
Just last week, I was a guest on the show so I was able to personally witness the enthusiasm for the British sounds. The two banter over the newest music coming over the Atlantic, weaving in sound bites about their recent trip to the David Gray concert in Detroit. 
And ifby a pure miracle, David Gray or someone close to him happens upon this humble column, I am positive that Lindsay [your biggest fan] would be more than thrilled if you called her show. 
Beyond spinning tunes from the British Isles, the hosts sometimes try to liven up the radio waves and try their hands at match making. As a guest on the show, I became a target oftheir tomfoolery as they decided to auction me off for a date. 
Describing me as a blond haired, blue eyed, political science major from New York caught me a date with their favorite listener from Virginia. My better judgment told me to forfeit this chance considering that Virginia is a bit far from the Bend and I can't say I am too intrigued by the idea oflnternet dating. 
But, it is these experiences that make college life interesting and add to the pile of possible stories to integrate into a political campaign speech or to tell the grandkids one day. 
Whether you are into British Pop or just want to treat your ears to new sounds, it will he worth your while to give this little college show broadcasted out ofLaFortune a try. It is an excellent accompaniment to help you finish up your work for the day or even some­thing to lull you off to dreamland. 
Ifyou like the show I am sure Llndsay and Kate would love an Instant Message and you, too, could be mentioned on air or possibly auctioned off.

Young alumni want more board activity 
By JULIA MILLER--LEMON 
News Writer 

For many young Notre Dame alumni, graduating from the University presents one of the most significant changes of their lives. Thanks to an expanding network of young alumni, recent gradu­ates are being provided with increasing opportunities for maintaining close ties with the life they had on the campus. 
"When I graduated I was devastated. I loved Notre Dame so much and knew exactly who I was when I was there," said Laura Merritt­Bird, a 1996 graduate and current Young Alumni Director. "I had this wonderful family on campus, and I felt like that was ripped from me when I graduated," she said. 
Two years after graduating from the University, Bird con­tacted her local alumni club in Wisconsin looking to recon­nect with the community atmosphere that she left behind in South Bend. She now sits on the Board of Directors of Notre Dame's Alumni Association as a Young Alumni Director. part of a group composed of 26 voting members who oversee 210 local clubs in 18 Unites States regions, as well as 40 international clubs. 
Until the early 1980s, there were no Young Alumni repre­sentatives sitting on the Alumni Board -there was no one providing a voice for the recent graduates. In 1980, members realized that there needed to be a better mecha­nism for young alumni to voice their concerns to the national board. Thus, the position of Young Alumni Director was born. 
The primary purpose of Bird and the two other Young Alumni Directors is to encour­age the active involvement of young alumni in their local clubs. as well as to makes sure that the Alumni Association provides "great opportunities for young alums to stay con­nected to the University," Bird said. 
Aside from being a channel for graduates to stay connect­ed to other members of the Notre Dame community, the clubs provide a number of dif­ferent activities ranging from volunteer opportunities, spe­cial masses and group game watches. Bird said that the main mission of the club is to "keep people connected to each other and to the core val­ues of the University." 
While the Alumni Association does not provide a formal career placement ser­vice for recent graduates of the University, the organiza­tion has worked to increase awareness about the concerns of young alumni. "[It] has been very receptive to the changing needs of graduates," said Bird. 
According to Bird, the Alumni Association wants to welcome every single person into this extended Notre Dame family. Part of this means that at the local level, members are generally very receptive about linking recent graduates with good contacts for career net­working among the area alumni. 
Bird also emphasized the importance for recent Notre Dame graduates of becoming involved in the Alumni Association in whatever regional area students live in after graduation. In addition to joining their local clubs, seniors should register on IrishOnline during mid-July, a directory of all alumni and a prime resource for locating the whereabouts of other alums, said Bird. 
When recent graduates add their name and contact infor­mation to this database, they will be included on the Alumni Association's mailing list. a direct way to obtain more information about local clubs and happenings.

Lack of jobs keeps students in classroo111.S 
By LYDIA LEUNG Michigan Daily 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. 

The job market is at a 20-year low, according to recently released statistics by the U.S. Labor Department. This information, combined with the uncertainty cre­ated by the possible war with Iraq and the flagging economy, caused University of Michigan engineering students from all disciplines to form long lines at booths of differ­ent companies at the Engineering Internship Fair Thursday. 
Down from 150 companies that participated in the career fair held last September, only about 30 companies which included Shell, IBM, UBS Warburg and many other firms from across the nation came to recruit University students this semester. 
The decline in companies' incen­tives to hire new workers was illus­trated by a report conducted by Conference Board, a research rum that said the number of help-want­ed advertisements in newspapers in the United States hit analmost 40-year low in December. Students said the wave of bad news con­cerning the job market is forcing them to think up ways to avoid entering the job hunt rat race. 
"I think po-;tponing graduation is a good idea," Engineering senior Francine Calderon said. 
In anticipation of the gloomy economy, many graduating seniors have opted to value-add them­selves by staying one more year at school to pursue their masters degrees. 
"Last spring, we saw a lot of panicked students. This year, I think seniors are more prepared," way that they are asking us to help. But there really is no effect on us," Townsend said. "We are strong and healthy, and have quite a few new contracts." 
While Townsend said Lockheed Martin Corp. is hiring over 2,000 full-time positions and 500 interns nationwide tWs year, job-cut state­ments were making news all week Bank of America, Circuit Oty and WorldCom announced that they are going to slash 900, 2,000 and 5,000 jobs respectively. 
Although it was an internship fair, many students in line were trying their luck at securing full­time positions. 
Alum Jonathon Frohlich, who graduated last December, said despite being optimistic about his ability to land a career soon, hisjob hunt was slowed down by the dis­mal economy. 
''I've been to a couple of career fairs, done a little bit of online job search ... but I've got nothing more than an interview," Frohlich said. 
With fewer participating compa­nies and more students trying to find a job at the career fair, stu­dents said they did not get much time to talk to the recruiters because ofthe long wait. 
"It's really impersonal. They just took my resume and stored it in their databases. I don't have much hope. There're just so many peo­ple,"Engineering sophomore Joel Donoghue saidAlthough it was an internship fair, many students in line tried securing full-time posi­tions.

SOUTH KOREA 
Antericans gain support for action against North Korea 
Associated P rcss 
BUSAN 

Thousands of South Koreans staged a pro-U.S. rally Sunday. prayed for North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions and an envoy of South Korea's president­elect urged Washington to hold direct talks with the communist nation. 
Returning from a visit to Washington and Tokyo, President-elect Roh Moo­hyun's envoy said he had made the case for dialogue. 
"I asked Washington to open direct U.S.-North Korea talks soon without con­dition," Chyung Dai-chul told Korean reporters, according to his aide Park Jin­hyung. Roh takes office Feb. 25. 
President Bush believ.es the standoff can be resolved peacefully, but said Friday that "all options are on the table," suggesting that Washington would con­sider military action. 
Relations between the United States and North Korea deteriorated in October, when U.S. officials said North Korea had admitted developing nuclear weapons in violation of a 1994 agreement. The United States then backed out of its part of the bargain, canceling fuel oil ship­ments. 
U.N. nuclear chief Mohamed E!Baradei 
on Sunday cautioned North Korea about indulging in "nuclear blackmail." 
E!Baradei acknowledged North Korean humanitarian and security needs but said those issues "should be resolved quite independently." 
"The lesson would be very dangerous if it shows that nuclear blackmail pays," ElBaradei told The Associated Press. "That, I think, is a very dangerous prece­dent." 
Also Sunday, about 3,000 people attended a pro-U.S. rally in South Korea's second-largest city, Busan. The demon­strators, mostly Christians, burned a pic­ture of North Korean leader Kim Jong II, waved American flags and prayed for an end to North Korea's nuclear ambitions. 
"North Korea must stop nuclear devel­opment," said a statement by the National Council of Churches in Korea, which organized the rally. 
But there is little sign of an end to the standoff after the North suggested it reac­tivated nuclear facilities that U.S. officials say could produce weapons within months. 
North Korea accuses the United States of inciting the current nuclear tension as a pretext to invade the communist coun­ty, and has warned of a "total war" that could devastate both Koreas. 

WORLD NEWS BRIEFS 
Papal envoy seeks Iraq's cooperation: Pope John Paul II will send an envoy to Iraq to appeal for peace and to encourage Iraqi authorities to cooperate with the United Nations. Their mission is to "show to all the plea of the Holy Father in favor of peace and to help the Iraqi authorities make a serious reflection on the need for effective interna­tional cooperation, based on justice and internation­al rights," spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said. Meetings with top Iraqi officials, including possibly Saddam Hussein, were expected. 
German-French Iraq plans spark anger: 
Germany said Sunday it would join with France in presenting to the U.N. Security Council an initiative to disarm Iraq without war, a proposal that has heightened resentment by the United States. U.S. officials bluntly dismissed the French-German pro­posals as ineffective and a ploy to delay military action opposed by Berlin and Paris. 


NATIONAL NEWS BRIEFS 
Lawmakers push missile-defense funds: 
Two New York congressmen on Sunday outlined proposed legislation for the federal government to spend as much as $15 billion to install missile defense systems on all commercial airliners. The electronic equipment proposed by Democrats Sen. Charles Schumer and Rep. Steve Israel could be turned on in case of attack to jam the guidance systems of portable, shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles. An unsuccessful attack on an Israeli air­liner last year in Kenya raised concerns about the weapons. 
Lawyer group considers enemy rights: 
The American Bar Association is set to condemn the government's refusal to give legal rights to American enemy combatants, part of the Bush administration's terrorism fighting strategy. The ABA also is expected to press for more openness about government surveillance in the U.S. 


Colo. may OK pet companionship law: 
Several Colorado lawmakers arc supporting legisla­tion to elevate the status of cats and dogs from property to companions. The measure would allow people in Colorado to sue veterinarians and animal abusers and seek damages for "loss of companion­ship," up to $100,000. Current law classifies them as property, and pet owners can seek only "fair market value" in a lawsuit. 

End near for Galileo after 14-yr. orbit: 
As NASA temporarily grounds its shuttle fleet fol­lowing the Columbia disaster, an unmanned space­craft that has been exploring the solar system for 14 years is nearing the end of its mission -and still revealing the secrets of a planet hundreds of mil­lions of miles from Earth. Like many extended jour­neys, Galileo's will end soon with countless miles traveled, its fair share of breakdowns and album after album stuffed with snapshots.

Students learn about disabilities 
By AMANDA MISNIK 
News Wirter 
Saint Mary's Student Diversity Board wanted to educate the student body about how difficult it would be being disabled, but its focus was not only on physical dis­abilities but "invisible disabili­ties". 
Two representatives from the Counseling and Career Development Center partici­pated in "The Invisible Disability" discussions. Psychologist and director of the Counseling and Career Development Center Mary DePauw gave the presentation "Depression: An Invisible Disability." Counselor and Academic Success Program specialist Gina Christiana pre­sented "Anxiety Disorders: An Invisible Disability." 
DePauw spoke about the symptoms of depression and mania, how to recognize these medical disorders and treat­ment. 
"People can't see it, and people can't recognize it for what it is," said DePauw. "[Depression] is an illness of the whole body, not just the mind." 
The presentation began with a video that discussed symp­toms of depression. DePauw explained that professional help should be obtained if at least five symptoms are expe­rienced for two weeks or longer. Signs of depression include: sad or anxious moods, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, loss of interest in things once enjoyed, insom­nia or over-sleeping, weight loss or weight gain and diffi­culty concentrating or making decisions. 
According to DePauw, many people don't seek treatment because they don't realize noticeably increased energy they are depressed or they and disconnected or racing blame the depression on per­thoughts. Experiences of sonal weakness, believing that mania have mixed features, it is just life's problems. where some symptoms may be DePauw explained the differ­categorized under mania

According to DePauw when helping someone who is depressed you should be hon­est and show that you care. Know when your friend needs his or her own space, and always be supportive. "Let's be committed to support one another." 
Depression affects approxi mately 18.8 million U.S. adults. Ten percent is adults, and 12.4 million are women, while 6.4 million are men. One in five people suffer from depression at some point in their lives, serious enough for medication. 
Symptoms of mania consist of inappropriate irritability, severe insomnia, grandiose ideas, increased talking, the No. 1 health 
issue of women in America. and is No. 2 for men," Christiana said. "It interferes with normal, every­day functioning of life ... it affects your whole being." 
Several types of anxiety dis­orders exist. Panic attacks, obsessive-compulsive disor­ders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and generalized anxiety disorders are some of the most common mental ill­nesses in America. Forty mil­lion people in the United States are affected by these weakening disorders. 
"There are treatments for everything," said Christiana. "[These disorders] basically take control of your life, [but] there is always light at the end of the tunnel," 
The Student Diversity Board sponsored these events.

Treasury chief Gordon Brown -said Sunday he has not ruled out recommending that Britain join the single European currency, with his department on track to complete its review of the issue by June. 
Brown told the British Broadcasting Corp. that government analysts were examining the many ways in which adopting the euro would affect Britain's economy. 
Prime Minister Tony Blair's government has said it favors joining the euro in principle, but will assess by June whether five self-imposed economic tests have been met before putting a decision on membership to voters in a refer­endum.

ABA may oppose U.S. on enemy combatants 
SEATTLE 

The nation's largest lawyers' group is set to condemn the government's refusal to give legal rights to American enemy combatants. part of' the Bush administraLion 's terrorism fighting strategy. 
The American Bar Associalion also is expected to press for more openness about government surveillance in the United States. 
The war on terror has been a prominent theme at the associ­ation's winter meeting in Scuttle, a port city where signs of the heightened terror alert were evident with tighter secu­rity on the water, at the airport and the state border with Canada. 
/\BA leaders will vote as early as Monday on the proposal call­ing for lawyers to be provided to Americans and U.S. residents held as combatants to help them argue in court that their detentions are illegal. 
The government will not release lhe names of those held as combatants. and only a cou­

pie of examples of detentions in America are widely known. The most high profile is Jose Padilla. accused of plotting to detonate a "dirty" bomb, which would use a conventional explosive to spread radioactive material. 
Enemy combatants, a type of wartime prisoner, arc held without charge or trial and are not allowed to see lawyers. 
Miami lawyer Neal Sonnett said it is un-American to deny legal rights to Americans or anyone else in the country when they arc apprehended. 
"We cannot allow individual rights to be eroded as part of the war on terror," Sonnett said. 
Supporting the government's policy is David Rivkin Jr.. a lawyer from Washington. D.C., who said the administration has foiled crimes with information obtained from combatants. Giving them lawyers would ruin interrogations and threaten the public, Rivkin said. 
"If we go in that direction it will disrupt our ability to stop attacks and a lot of people are going to die," Rivkin said Sunday during a debate with Sonnett at an event jointly spon­sored by the ABA and the more conservative Federalist Societv. 
The resolution was bci;g revised to satisfy some critics, by spelling out thatjudges could impose restrictions on lawyer­combatant meetings so that national security is not compro­mised. 
The 400,000-rnernber lawyers· group also is weighing in on the increased surveillance power Congress gave the gov­ernment after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. An ABA resolu­tion would ask lawmakers to amend the law and order more oversight of wiretapping and searches granted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. 
That panel of federal judges, who meet in secret, handles government requests to gather intelligence on suspected spies, terrorists or foreign agents in the United States. The court was created in 1978. 
The administration has argued that the surveillance is important for its terrorism investigations. 
The ABA would urge 
Congress to require the court to give annual statistics of its work and clarify when it can allow surveillance. 
Mark Agrast. a Washington, D.C., lawyer who heads the ABA committee that developed the proposal, said the court's activities are too secret, and the secrecy may conceal constitu­tional violations. 
"You never know whether you've been under surveillance. That's a sobering power io give to anybody," Agra.st said. 
Scott Silliman, director of Duke University's Center on Law, Ethics and National Security, said he is not worried that the judges on the court are "going to be under the thumb of the attorney general." 
He expects legal challenges to the government's monitoring in criminal cases that arise from information collected. "The courts need to speak before the ABA comes on too strong," he said. 
Little was known about the secret court until last year, 
when it rejected a wiretap  
request  by  the  Justice  
Department.

Cult 

pursues claims 
As5ociated Pre.s 

NEW ORLEANS 
It was a brutal and ultimate­
ly deadly confrontation that 
transfixed the nation for weeks 
in the spring of 1993: govern­
ment agents facing off against 
a fanatic cult leader and his 
followers in Waco, Texas. 

Nearly 10 years after the firn 
that ended the standoff and 
killed Branch Davidian leader 
David Koresh and scores of his 
disciples, survivors and their 
families arc still pushing claims 
against the federal govern­
ment. 

On Monday, they're sched­
uled to make a last-ditch effort 
before the U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals here, seeking to have 
the judge removed from their 
wrongful-death lawsuit and 
asking for a new trial. 
In September 2000 in Waco, 
U.S. District Judge Walter Smith dismissed the lawsuit, backing the federal contention that agents had not used exces­sive force in their tear-gas assault on the cult compound. Smith found that the Davidians themselves set the fire that killed nearly 80 men, women and children. 
Monday's appeal arguments 
are being made on behalf of 
the estates of 14 children who 
died in the fire, a 15-year-old 
girl who was badly burned and 
three parents whose children 
died in the blaze. 
The Davidians, whose beliefs 
encompass fierce hostility 
against the government, say 
Smith's rulings in related 
cases, and comments on and 
off the bench. betray "deep­
seated antagonism" and "pre­
conceptions" against them. 
They say he expressed "nega­
tive characterizations" of them, 
including calling one Branch 
Davidian follower "crazy" and 
a murderer. 
Government lawyers dismiss 
the bias claims. 
"To the contrary, Judge Smith displayed patience and diligence wading through enor­mously complicated legal and factual claims and gradually winnowing down the issues for trial," they say in their brief. 
A lawyer for the Davidians, James Juranek, acknowledged that the odds are against him in court. Appeals such as his are "granted less often than they are denied," he said. 
On Feb. 28, 1993, federal agents stormed the Branch Davidian compound looking for stockpiled automatic weapons and hand grenades. Four fed­eral agents and three Davidians were killed in the clash. 
For 51 days, the government attempted to get the cult fol­lowers to come out. On April 19, agents fired tear-gas rounds into the compound and fire consumed it.

Considering costs ofhuman suffering 
As the nation prepares for war with Iraq, the suffering of the war's likely vic­tims, including untold numbers of non­combatants, weighs heavily on our minds. During the initial forum of "Peace and War 2003: 
Debating the Issues," theolo­gian Father Michael Baxter delivered a report on his recent visit to Iraq. where he 

celebrated 
ScQtt Appleby
Christmas with members of the Christian community and interacted with other ordinary Iraqis. Baxter spoke movingly of a people who have been denied basic human needs, including adequate nutrition and health care, by the sanctions imposed on Iraq by the international community over the last decade. Antibiotics are absent or in short supply, for example, and the economic and social infrastructure of Iraq society has virtually collapsed. 
Baxter came away from the experience, he said, with an rueful awareness that Iraqi Christians, who number approxi­mately 1 million, are no more willing to oppose the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein than U.S. Christians are willing to launch a sustained and effective protest against the destructive and perni­cious policies oftheir own government. 
The consequences ofsuch public oppo­sition, ofcourse, are far more severe in Iraq, where freedom of speech, assembly and religion are a distant dream and state torture and execution of dissidents are commonplace events. Respondents Dan Philpott, professor of political sci­ence, and sophomore Teresa Hansen made this point, albeit indirectly, in dif­ferent ways. 
Hansen. who is strongly opposed to war, spoke of her own participation in organized protests against the U.S. mili­tary build-up. One might add that such protests are protected by U.S. law and even encouraged by some public figures as expressions of a thriving democracy. 
Philpott underscored the paucity of effective options in responding to Saddam's ruthless repression of his own people and his designs on regional power. (During Saddam's rule perhaps 1 million Iraqis have been killed. Hundreds of thousands died in needless war, and oth­ers were simply murdered by the regime.) In an attempt to de-fang Saddam, the international community has tried diplomacy, sanctions, embargoes, positive inducement and even limited mil­itary strikes. None of this has worked. 
Over the course of three panels thus far, no one has minimized the monstrous nature of Saddam or his regime. But some have questioned the motivations and intentions ofthe Bush administra­tion. 
Theologian Margaret Pfeil, invoking the John Howard Yoder's call for a just war theory "with teeth," expressed doubt that the U.S. government satisifies the "right intention" criterion for making war. If we are so concerned with liberating the Iraqi people, she asked, why did we wait decades to do so? The U.S. government showed little interest in the people of either Iraq or Iran, P{eil noted, when it supported Iraq in the bitter and pro­longed war of the 1980s. Nor was the senior President Bush particularly con­cerned with liberating the people of Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War. The current Bush administration, in it'> "realist" con­cerns with "regime change," whatever the cost in innocent lives, demonstrates that international law was indeed devel­oped as a law for states rather than a law for the people. 
Were the U.S. government truly con­cerned with the people who would become the victims of war, the following estimates would give pause. The United Nations, in a once-secret report (now available on the web) that draws upon data provided by the World Health Organization, estimates that 500,000 peo­ple would require medical treatment as a result of the military attacks upon Iraq. One hundred thousand citizens would be wounded, and an additional 400,000 would fall ill after the bombing of water and sewage facilities and the disruption of food supplies. More than 2 million chil­dren under the age of five would require therapeutic feeding. 
Wit such estimates in view, Vittorio Hosle raised the question of proportional­ity in considering the consequences of a pre-emptive strike against Iraq. What if the proposed war would end in the deaths of far more innocent Iraqis than would die otherwise (e.g., by a policy of containment, constant harrassment and scrutiny of Saddam's regime)? How could we consider this a justifiable "humanitarian intervention"? 
Christopher Rupar, a senior undergrad­uate in Air Force ROTC. argued that the 
U.S. military, far from being trigger­happy, shares a strong presumption against the use of force and seeks to limit the number of casualties on both sides. The military can play a constructive role in rebuilding war-tom societies, Rupar noted, in part by providing physical secu­rity and stability for post-war govern­ments dedicated to democracy. 
Pfeil nonetheless lamented the fact that Americans, and Christians in particular, have a long way to go in preparing them­selves to pursue peace in the fullest sense of the term -the restoration of right relations with God and with one's neigh­bor. We are far from being converted to peace, far from exhausting every possible alternative to war. 
Future panels will address the impact of a war on the Middle East and U.S. rela­tions with Islam, the role of the media in framing perceptions of the crisis and the financial cost of the war.

LETTER TO THE EDtT0R 
Column wrong to disagree with funding 
Theresa Fralish's Inside Column makes some generalizations and claims that fail to hold up upon closer reading. Fralish's main problem is that Saint Mary's is a Catholic institution and thus should not, and on some esoteric moral ground, cannot fund students to attend a conference of their choice. First, an institution of higher learning has an obligation to let their stu­dents learn, and this does not merely take place in theology class or church-sponsored catechism classes. Forming opinions, religous and otherwise, must be allowed and encouraged to occur on and offcampus. Fralish makes the erronenous claim that Saint Mary's would not give funding to pro-life students to attend a D.C. rally, but instead sponsored the pro-choice trip. The fallacy of this statement is even acknolwedged by the author. Those students who chose to travel to D.C. did not choose to ask the Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership for funding. These students are surely capable of making an application for funding and there appears to be nothing in the mission statement of the grant or the College that would dissal­low a grant to these pro-life students. 
The mission statement of the grant from the Lily Corporation speaks to allowing the women of Saint Mary's to experience "innovative thinking, reflection and action." The approval of a grant and the giving of monies, donated to the college by a pri­vate organization, does not make a statement regarding the morals of a student or their interests. Saint Mary's in its response and future actions will choose the path of education at a Catholic institution or to become intolerant and resemble insti­tutions commonly refered to as Bible colleges, where morals are imposed and disent is disallowed. The choice is clear: indoctri­nation should not be supported by Saint Mary's; inquisitive, edu­cated students must be.

40 miles closer to heaven 
It took the space shuttle Columbia becoming a shooting star in the Texas sky to make space travel seem as extra­ordinary as it was so long ago. 
The Soviet Union's launch of' the bowl­ing-ball-on-a-tripod called Sputnik shocked the world, but mostly because the U.S.S.B.. had momentarily sur­passed the U.S. technologically. But on May 25, 1961, when President John F. Kennedy boldly announced that America would send men to the moon and back, it was not solely for a Cold War advantage. but for the advancement of all people. Dospite his assassination and the deaths of the three /\polio 1 astronauts on Jan. 27, 1967. Kennedy's vision prevailed. When Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon, his first words didn't praise America. but all of' humanity. 
Sadly, since then space flight has made no further giant leaps for mankind. Beginning with the Apollo­Soyuz rendezvous in 1975 and continu­ing to the international space stations of today, the space program has mostly promoted diplomacy and peace. This is a fine goal, especially when compared to the superpower hostilities that spawned the space race, but not the exciting stuff of NASA's heyday. 
Even the scientific missions, which Columbia's final voyage was, don't exactly thrill us. Among the studies the STS-107 crew undertook were for human physiology, fire suppression. global climatology and the German Space Agency's earth-shattering experi­ment involving "development of the gravity-sensing organs of fish in the absence of gravity's effects." This is why we're spending billions of dollars to put human beings in a fragile pod attached to half a million gallons of rocket fuel? For lish? 


Many publications have lamented the fact that Americans treat the shuttle program as so routine that it captures less of our imagination than television shows. However, the sad reality is that few people were consciously aware of the seven people who spent 16 days on Columbia because, quite frankly, their mission wasn't even as exciting as a Gene Roddenberry artHicial creation. It had nothing to with which to capture our imaginations. The shultles, which were given namfls likfl Entflrprisc. Challenger, Discovery and Endeavour, for the most part haven't lived up to them. 
[n the aftermath of the Columbia's explosive descent. the entire purpose of manned space flight is under scrutiny. If all we're doing is studying fish and fire suppression, it's been asked, why are we risking lives to do it? Shouldn't we just replace the shuttles with unmanned probes? And the blame may fall on an institution that's seen its ideals derailed and its budget slashed, yet still asked to perform miracles of modern science like putting people in orbit on a rocket and bringing them back in a glider (all with no real emergency contingencies), or deploying technological marvels like the Voyager satellites, the Hubble Telescope and the Mars Rover. 
These criticisms lack both vision and imagination. Space flight represents the pinnacle of man's scientific achieve­ments, quests to explore and fantasies to fulfill. It's like putting Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Marie Curie, Albert Einstein, Bill Gates and the Wright Brothers on a DC-9 (with nothing to consume but freeze-dried food and Tang) and strapping them to a Manhattan Project that launches them into Carl Sagan's and Isaac Asimov's dreamscapes. Along the way, technolog­ical revolutions occur for the rest of us bound by gravity, from personal com­puters and the Internet to Teflon and Velcro. 
Why do we go to space? Ask John F. Kennedy, who understood both the bur dens and the rewards of the most awe­some undertaking in human history. Ask the members of Apollo 11, who left a plaque on the moon that reads. "We came in peace for all mankind." We go to space for the same reason every brave soul who probes an uncertain new frontier, consequences be damned, has attempted their missions since the beginning of time: to see what's out there. 
Now is precisely the wrong time to scrap manned space exploration. In addition to sending a horrible message to the future scientists of the world ­that discovery isn't worth the risks -it nullifies the cause for which the brave crews of the Columbia, Challenger and Apollo 1 gave their lives (which, in an eerie coincidence, all happened during a six day span on the calendar). However uninspiring the Columbia's experiments might have been, the best way to honor its fallen heroes is to expand both the ideals and the missions of NASA. 
After Apollo 17 left the moon in 1972, no human has ever traveled beyond low­earth orbit. After the massive commit­ment required to reach the moon, we were content to simply pack up and spend the next 30 years performing the cosmological equivalent of circling the block. There are no visionary dreams, no pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. In short, we need the courage to accept a Kennedy moonshot quest for the new millennium. 
Something similar was proposed once, but although it sunk in a sea of bureau­cratic red ink, it remains a feasible goal. On July 20, 1989, the 20th anniversary of the first moon landing, President George H.W. Bush laid out a three-step project for an endeavor to Mars with an ultimate target year of 2019. Fourteen years later, on the 17th anniversary of the Challenger explosion, and four days before Columbia's breakup. President George W. Bush decided not to officially greenlight a new NASA project called "Prometheus," which will explore using nuclear power to fuel space travel, in his State of the Union Address (though he may still include funding for it in his 2004 budget). Bush instead included a $1.2 billion proposal for hydrogen fuel­cell cars "so that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen." Children born in 2003 will reach their 16th birthdays in 2019. 
With that synthesis in mind. it's time to combine these efforts. In 1961, John 
F. Kennedy issued a challenge to place not just an American flag, but a human being, on the moon in just over eight years. To reach Mars by 2019. we have twice the time and two new potential fuel sources to go with all the technolog­ical breakthroughs space exploration has brought us since. All we need now is the temerity we've lacked for three decades when, after taking that bold first step into the void, we retreated back to square one. 
But if there's any legacy that Rick Husband, William McCool, Laurel Clark. Michael Anderson, David Brown, Kalpana Chawla and Ilan Ramon can leave us, it's that despite the risks. the voyage to the stars is still a noble enter­prise and worth expanding upon to infinity.

Trip to Timbuktu allows for adventure rarely experienced stateside 
I just returned from Mali the relative tourist Mecca of West Africa, Mali. Mali is most famous for Timbuktu, the mysterious city of gold that Europeans searched for and imagined about for decades and the murderous Niger River that prevented European penetration with mysterious tropical diseases and earned Malte Uranga West Africa the fabled title of "The White Man's Graveyard." Anti-malarial drugs and the dis­covery of Timbuktu have since Life in Africa made travel in Mali less of a physical threat. 
As a result of these develop­ments, 1convinced my brother to venture to Africa. Bush taxi problems and time did not allow us to go to Timbuktu, but we decided we got close enough to tell people we went there. Similar problems and inability to understand the river system eliminated a boat trip on the Niger. Instead we hiked for five days along cliffs and mud huts and took a boat trip on the Bani River. 
All of these problems, accidents and lack of plans led to an adventure. We were in Mopti, a city on the confluence of the Niger and Bani Rivers, about to get a taxi home when some man came up to us. After brushing him off for a minute or so I asked him ran­domly if we could take a boat from there to Djenne. It started off as a game to sec if it was even possible and, if it was, to hear the sales pitch he would give us. Our destination city was in the complete opposite direction from where most tourists go and also, as I 
later learned, the wrong river. 
Luckily this is one of the few instances that Africa is easier to get around in than other places. Tourist operators. being any local hustler on the street. make everything possible for a few dollars. So around 8 p.m. at night we met some random man, argued about which way the river flowed, wrote a "contract," gave him some money and said we would meet the next morning at 7. We went home that night uncertain whether it was some elaborate scheme to get some money. 
Early the next morning we made our way back to the place we met the guy last night and realized nei­ther of us can remember what the "guiden looks like; we hoped that he would remember us. Five minutes later he found us and we walked to our boat and met the two men responsible for our safety and security for the next two days. 
The boat was about the size and space of three or four canoes put together. It was solid wood, with two long poles to propel us forward, a sail made out of old sewn together plastic rice bags and a mast that was already leaning slightly to the right. 
We checked for water in the bottom of the boat, water to drink and enough food for the two days. With no real idea how far we were going, how we would get there or what was in between. we got into the boat and set off. Immediately one of the boat operators attempted to raise our rice bag sail. One if the strings that held the sail in place broke. The sail fell into the river in a hopeless mass. Through 
McGyver-like ingenuity he repaired the sail with an 
old fishing net, and we were on our way again. 
Moments like this continued for the next two days. All of our meals were cooked on the boat. Never before had 1 thought that an open fire on a wooden boat would be a good idea. 
The entire boat was an example of an amazing recycling program of old rope, plastic and wood scraps. The endless hours on the boat allowed my brother and I to return to childhood imaginations. or perhaps African reality. In the pitch black we got stuck on a sand bar and became completely turned around. I was Tom Sawyer and he was lluck Finn. We passed villages where children cried or stared in amazement when they saw us. 
Thirty-six hours later we arrived at our destination both relaxed and satisfied with the way the chaos and uncertainty went. 
These are the types of days and adventures that 1 appreciate the chaos here that my life in the United States rarely allowed. Some days it is nice to not know how. where. what or even why. And also not to worry when the mast leans a little to the right.

The quotable Woody Allen 


Scene Writer 

Woody Allen has been in the moviemaking business longer than most Hollywood directors and knows his Freud better than most analysts. Of course, it'd be hard to know where to start untangling the Gordian knot of neuroses of Hollywood's favorite schmuck.

Disinterested in col­lege, Allen dropped out of school (and by some accounts was suspended from) after only a year to begin writing for television. Allegedly he failed a class called "Motion Picture Production" during his time at NYU. 
Allen became a writer for standup comedian David Alber. Two years later Alber brought Allen on board as a writer for Sid Caesar's legendary "Your Show of Shows." The young writer worked alongside other soon to be famous names like Neil Simon and Mel Brooks. 

Allen left television writing after five years to try his hand at his own materi­al. He quickly made a name for h. as a standup comedian, ofte ing at ultra-hip Manhat.ta like The Blue Angel. ltw in standup that Alle neurotic Jewish N persona for

MLB 
Pitchers and catchers begin to report to spring training 
Associated Press 
Mike Piazza stepped off the plane and shuddered. Like a lot of places, New York was in a deep freeze. 
"Man, my ears almost fell off," the Mets star said. "I'll be glad when we get going." 
He's not the only one. Because with much ofthe country covered by snow and ice this winter, it just takes a few words to warm up baseball everywhere: It's time for pitchers and catchers to report to spring training. 
The Seattle Mariners will be 

the first team to open camp. They get going Sunday, and there's a reason for the quick start -lchiro Suzuki, Freddy Garcia and the Mariners will play the major league opener real early, on March 25 in Tokyo against Oakland. 
Within a week, every team will break out the bats, the balls and the big hopes. From Florida to Arizona, from Vero Beach to Scottsdale, optimism will mix with the sun and sand. 
All over. teams arc excited, particularly with so many top players having moved. Jim 
Thome, Tom Glavine, Mike Hampton, Ivan Rodriguez and Jeff Kent s,-vitchcd sides, and the New York Yankees brought two newcomers to the big leagues -­Japanese slugger Hideki Matsui and Cuban pitcher Jose Contreras. 
Plus, camps will be fuU of fresh young faces, guys who sooner or later may become household names. Could the new star be 19­year-old Mets shortstop Jose Reves, Cleveland first baseman Travis Hafner, or Phillies center fielder Marlon Byrd? 
So why not be enthused, espe­

cially after what the Anaheim 
Angels accomplished last year? 
Yet even the fabulous K-Rod, 

now about to receive a champi­
onship ring at 21, sounded like a 
seasoned veteran as the Angels 
prepared to open camp on 
Valentine's Day in Tempe, Ariz. 
"Everything starts with zero," the reliever said. "The most diffi­cult thing in baseball is to be consistent. You can have one good year but if the next is bad, you're defrauding everyone." 
And remember how the spring started for the Angels last year? They got in an exhibition fight with San Diego, and Troy Glaus and Scott Spiezio were suspend­ed. By October, Glaus was the World Series MVP, and Spiezio was a postseason star. 
On the field, if there's ever a time to think big, it's now. 
So maybe that's why Milwaukee ace Ben Sheets was looking ahead after a season in 
which the Brewers lost 106 games. 
"To be honest with you, I don't even think about last year. It all goes away --good year, bad year, doesn't matter. Just like a good game, bad game, you can't bring it with you," he said. "Clean slate." 
The Rangers left Port Charlotte, Fla., where alligators used to sun themselves in ponds around the ballpark and former owner George W. Bush would stroll the grounds. The Royals exited· their old Boardwalk and Baseball site in central Florida, which opened wil.h a lot of fan­fare in 1988 but quickly lost pop­ularity. 
This also will be the last time Philadelphia trains at Jack Russell Stadium in Clearwater, Fla. Nearly a half-century old, the ballpark is one of the coziest anywhere, with perfect touches -where else can fans find a warning track made of crushed seashells? 
Meanwhile, a few familiar faces are still looking for jobs. Reggie Sanders and Kenny Lofton, who started for the Giants in Game 7 of the World Series, remain free agents, as do Rickey Henderson, Kenny Rogers, Chuck Finley and B.J. Surhoff. David Justice and Andy Benes, mean­while, say they're done. 
"Fourteen seasons is long enough," said Justice, whose teams made the playoffs in his last 11 years. "I have a dimin­ished desire to play." 
For everyone else, the exhibi­tion games begin Feb. 27. That's when Baker and his Chicago Cubs will take on his old team, the Giants. The same day, Cincinnati will visit the Yankees in Tampa, Fla. 
The Yankees already are gear­ing up for Matsui's arrival, and there's a plan to sell sushi at the concession stands at Legends Field. 
Derck Jeter, David Wells and manager Joe Torre also arc pre­parcd for owner George Steinbrenner's bluster. The Boss was not happy that his guys were whacked out of the playoffs by Anaheim in the opening round. and he let them hear it. 
"We know what it's like to win, and we also know what it's like to lose. You don't want to lose anymore," Jeter said. 
Besides, the Yankees don't need to look far for a reminder of the success Steinbrenner expects. Beyond the center-field fence at Legenrls Field, there's a message board that reads: Congratulations, Super Bowl Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
The Bucs' home is Raymond James Stadium, right across the street from the Yankees' com­plex. 
"I was happy for Tampa Bay. It's great. It's good that they won it," Wells said. "Now that spring training is here, and we're a Tampa product, hopefully it will be catching. The guys can catch on to what the Bucs did."

ATLANTA 
Yao Ming has seemed comfortable most of his rookie season, showing composure on and off the court. 
His first All-Star game might have gotten to him, though. 
Voted a starter for the Western Conference, Yao had only two points and two rebounds in 17 min­utes, sitting out the fourth quarter and both over­times. 
Shaquille O'Neal, Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett were the big men who got most of the play­ing time down the stretch as the West beat the East 155-145 in double over­time. 
Yao, picked No. 1 over­all by the Houston Rockets in last year's draft, became the first rookie to start in the All­Star game since Grant Hill in 1995. His selection was helped with ballots printed in Mandarin for the first time; he out­polled O'Neal by nearly a quarter-million votes, even though Shaq aver­ages nearly 27 points a game and Yao just 13. 
But the 7-foot-6 Yao rarely looked to shoot when he had the ball, 
making his only attempt. His lone basket was a dunk 65 seconds into the game after an alley-oop pass from Houston team­mate Steve Francis. 
His highlight of the night might have been winning the opening tip from Ben Wallace, finally stepping into the circle after fellow West starters Duncan and Kevin Garnett prodded him. 
Yao did wear a pair of powder blue low-top shoes. a tribute to Michael Jordan's alma mater, North Carolina. The brightly colored shoes clashed with the red uniform of the West, but Jordan was making his final All-Star appear­ance. 
Yao's former teammates with the Shanghai Sharks were watching the tele­cast in China, where the game started at about 9 
a.m. Monday morning. He joined Houston after the team reached an agree­ment with the Sharks and Chinese officials. 
Yao was the 16th rookie in NBA history to start in the All-Star game, and the sixth center -joining O'Neal in 1993, Elvin Hayes in 1969, Walt Bellamy in 1962, Wilt Chamberlain in 1960 and Ray Felix in 1954.

No. 43 Notre Dame's close loss to No. 8 Duke was dis­appointing for an Irish team that began the season with the worst start in program history. Nevertheless, after playing the Blue Devils, the Irish believe they have what it takes to contend with a top-ranked team. Such a confidence will be crucial to the Irish in the upcoming weeks, during which they

Buchanan came into the week with a five­m a tch losing streak, but Tuesday he clinched victory for the Irish against Wisconsin, and Saturday he contributed to the Irish win with his singles victory against Purdue.

Sunday was not a great day for Irish veterans, but they had to deal with tough competition. Junior Matt Scott, ranked 119th, was defeated by No" 77 Ludovic Walter, 6-3, 6-4. No. 72 Luis Haddock, a junior, was upset by the Blue Devils' Phillip King, 6-3, 6-1. 
Jonathon Stokke pre­vailed over Irish senior Brian Farrell, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5. 
The Irish were also lack­ing one of their best. Sophomore Brent D'Amico, who has gone 6-0 in singles play this spring. was injured during the doubles portion and could not play singles. 
Saturday, playing at No. 46 Purdue, the Irish partici­pated in another close match. Yet they were able to win, as they came from behind to triumph 4-3. The Boilermakers began the match by winning the dou­bles point and the first sin­gles contest. Then the Irish won the next four singles events to secure the victory, their second of the season. Haddock, Scott, D'Amico, and Buchanan were the contributors to the Irish 
win. 
Notre Dame will have some time off, to reassess its doubles lineup and to improve their confidence on the courts, before they head to East Lansing, Mich. Feb. 19 to take on Michigan State.

S-wimmers look to Big East Tourney after loss 
By LISA REIJULA 
Spores Writer 
In one of the fastest and com­petitive meets of the season, the Notre Dame men's swimming and diving team was edged by Oakland University, 151-149 on Saturday. The Irish finished the dual meet season with a record of 6-8. 
"Obviously it stinks to lose, but it was a test to see where we were," said junior Matt Obringer. "We're partially resting for the Big East meet and we had some season-best times." 
Notre Dame had the momentum to start, as the 200-meter medley team of Doug Bauman, Jason Fitzpatrick, Frank Krakowski and Tim Randolph took first. 
In the 1,000-meter race, Patrick Davis notched a victory, while teammate Matt Bertke was second. 
Other event winners for the Irish included Bauman in the 100 backstroke (50.75) and Jason Fitzpatrick in the 100 breast­stroke (57.63). 
Oakland answered back with victories in the 200-meter freestyle, 200-meter butterfly and the 50-meter freestyle to end the first half of the meet. 
The Irish divers gave their team the lead again, as Joe Miller, Andy Maggio and Tong Xie swept the top three places in the one-meter event. 
However, Oakland soon took control of the meet. The Grizzlies grabbed victories in the 100 freestyle, 200 backstroke, 200 breaststroke and 500 free to catch up to the Irish" 
The Irish stayed even with wins by Krakowski in the 100-meter butterfly (50.08) and Maggio in the three-meter diving competi­tion (313.80). 
The turning point of the after­no on was the 400 IM, as the Grizzlies finished one-two-three and gained crucial points. The 16 point gain pushed the Irish into a corner going into the final event 
In the 400 freestyle relay, Oakland overtook the Irish on the last leg, winning the race and the meet. However, Notre Dame's team of Randolph, Krakowski, Fitzpatrick, and Matt Obringer posted their fastest time of the season (3:06.31). 
The Irish are optimistic even after the close loss. 
"Overall the results were pretty positive," said Obringer. "It was definitely a good sign of our progress and hopefully a sign of good things to come." 
The Irish will compete next in the Big East Championship on Feb. 20-22 in Uniondale, N.Y.

In addition to his record time, four other runners broke the four-minute barrier and the top five runners recorded the live fastest miles in the world this year. The top five runners were separated by less than half' a second. Watson, who did not make his move until the final lap, did not take the lead until the final 30 meters. Watson credited his competitors for pushing him throughout the race. 
"The pacing was perfect," said Watson. "I know this track so well that I know when it's time to make every move and that was an advan­tage. I like to finish hard [and] I like to beat people in the last 100 or 200 meters. That's always been a strength of mine, and I exploited that today." 
"Watson has been just a terrific per­former in cross country. indoor, and outdoor," said Irish coach Joe Piane. "Ilc's a many time All-American and a real positive influence. He works extremely hard and everyone else fol­lows his lead." 
Two other Irish competitors also provisionally qualified for the NCM Championships in the mile, as Eric Morrison finished at 4:01.90 and Kevin Somok finished at 4;03.82. They must wait for other results around the country to find out whether or not they will make the NCAA field. 
"Somok and Morrison train with Luke every day," said Piane. "They know that if they can run with him they're going to run well and we saw that today." 
In addition to Watson's record­breaking accomplishments, freshman Molly Huddle shattered the school record in the women's 3,000 meters. Huddle, who automatically qualified for the NCMs in the event along with teammate Lauren King, broke the old school record by more than fifteen seconds with her 9:14.33 time. She finished second in the race to Nike­sponsored professional Colette Liss, while King finished fifth with 9:19.52. 

Selim Nurudeen provisionally quali­fied for the NCAA Championship with his best 60-meter hurdle time of the season in 7.83. That time easilv bet­tered the NCM provisional quaiifying mark and could put Nurudeen in the NCAA field. 
Other strong Irish performances for the men included Vincent Ambrico who won the regular mile, and Chris Staron who finished third in the high jump. 
For the women. Emily Loomis tied for first in the high jump, Kymia Love won the 400 meters, Jaime Volkmer tied for first in the pola vault, Tameisha King won the long jump, and the 4x440-yard relay team (Love, King, Tiffany Gunn, and Kristen Dodd) finished second with one of the fastest times in the nation. 
"The sub-four minute mile and Chuck Aragon's record (3:59.9 in 1981) have been things I've been 
chasing for two minutes now with a realistic chance of breaking. I needed all the conditions to come together on the right day, and that's something that really doesn't happen all that often. Today was just perfect. I felt great, the pace was perfect, the race was perfect, the competition was there, and all the elements fell into place." 
"We had a wonderful day," said Piane, who credited both the facility and the packed crowd. "We had a couple of ladies [Huddle and King] qualify for the NCAA in the 3,000. Selim is ranked either eighth or ninth in the country [in the 60-meter hur­dles] so that's marvelous. Luke's ranked number one in the country. What a day."

continued from page 24 
But sometime during Watson's run for the records I realized something. Running really can be exciting. There are no timeouts, no breaks in the action. It is sport at its simplest, a race against the competition and a race against time. 
Having five of' the fastest runners in the world pitted against each other doesn't hurt either. Watson was in fifth place during much of the 
race. 

He was behind after a quarter mile. 
At a half mile he remained in the lead pack. 
After three quarters of a mile, he still trailed 
four other runners. 
It was not until the final stretch, the final pos­sible moment. that Watson made his move. "I like to finish hard, I like to beat people in the last 100 or 200 meters," he said after the race. 
And beat them he did. 
Watson's surge came just in time, as he took the lead within 30 meters of the finish line. To put that in perspective, the final 30 meters or a mile-long race is about the same margin that remained when Torin Francis gave the men's basketball team its final lead over Pittsburgh Sunday. 
So it's easy to say that many races have close finishes. After all, some of the shorter track events are won by hundredths of seconds. Being close doesn't inherently guarantee great­ness or excitement. 
But Watson had one more thing going for him. Besides having a flair for the dramatic he also ran the fastest mile on the planet so far this year. The four men that he passed over the course of the last lap fared pretty well too. They finished with the second through fifth fastest miles in the world this year. Watson's time broke the old school record by two seconds, and he also became only the second Notre Dame runner to ever run a mile in under four minutes. 
So next time you think about exciting moments in sports, think about that last second shot, the home run, and the touchdown. But don't forget about the fastest man on the planet this year. 
His name is Luke Watson.

It's the 'Pitts' for Panthers 
. Francis' late layup lifts Irish over No. 4 Panthers in 66­64 comeback win 
By CHRIS FEDERICO 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame tri-captain Matt Carroll had recently lamented that he had never experienced the thrill of being mobbed by a crowd of crazed fans and stu­dents rushing the court of the Joyce Center in his four years with the Irish. 
Sunday afternoon, that all changed as No. 10 Notre Dame puUed of a 66-64 upset of No. 4 Pittsburgh before a sellout crowd at the Joyce Center. 
"We couldn't ask for anything better. The fans were unbeliev­able today," CarroU said after the last-second victory. "I had no idea. There were 20 people jump­ing on my back. I looked up and there was a big wave of green coming on me." 
Just four days after being on the losing end of such a celebra­tion after Notre Dame's 78-72 to Seton Hall, the Irish players saw Sunday's matchup with confer­ence rival Pittsburgh as an oppor­tunity to turn the tables. 
"We had talked the other day about crowds rushing the courts, because at Seton Hall. their crowd rushed the court when they beat us," said freshman cen­

 Senior finishes first in Meyo Mile, claims world's fastest mile time this year

An impressive performance earlier this month in Boston qualified Luke Watson for the NCAA Championship in the 3,000 meters, and created high expectations for Watson in the running of the Meyo Mile Saturday. 
All those expectations were exceeded, as Watson came from behind on the last lap to fin­ish first in the Meyo Mile in front of an ener­gized crowd at the Loftus Sports Center. In the process, he broke the four-minute mile barrier and the school record in the mile, automatically qualified for the NCAA Championship, and ran the fastest mile in the world so far this year in

Hokies deal Irish a close road loss 
By KATIE MCVOY 
Associate Sports Editor 
It was too close to ca1l until the last second ticked off the clock. Fourteen ties and 12 lead changes highlighted the back and forth game between Notre Dame and Virginia Tech Sunday that left the question who would come out on top. 
With only 34 seconds remaining and the Irish down by two, Irish guard Alicia Ratay made two free throws to tie the score at 50. But it wasn't quite enough to make the Irish winning streak any longer than two. 
After a solid second-half performance against Georgetown Wednesday, the Irish (13-8, 5-5 in the Big East) found themselves back on the losing end of the court, as they fell 53-50 at Virginia Tech (15-5, 7-3 in the Big East) Sunday. 
After the two Ratay bas­kets from the charity stripe, it looked like Notre Dame might have been able to piece together a three-game winning streak. But Hokies guard Carrie Mason convert­ed a three-point play with 13 seconds left and the Irish couldn't respond, despite a final effort by forward Jacqueline Batteast to make a trey with just two ticks left on the clock. 
Sunday's game was a bat­tle to the finish line. 
Neither the Irish nor the Hokies led by more than four points at any time. Spurts that put the Irish up by four fell short in carrying momentum through the rest of the game. And with only two players in double digits, Notre Dame could not sus­tain any significant scoring run. 
Neither the Irish nor the Hokies could claim that it was their shooting that kept them in Sunday's contest. 
Only two Irish players fin­ished the game in double fig­ures and, while Notre Dame shot a below-average 38.6 percent from the field, the Hokies shot a dismal 28.6 percent. Notre Dame did manage to dominate Virginia Tech inside, outscoring the Hokies 24-4 in the paint, but the Irish just couldn't get the job done. 
The Hokies found their only offensive success on the foul line. Virginia Tech hit 22 of its 24 free throws, recording a new team-best 
91.7 percent from the free­throw line in Big East play. Hokies junior forward Ieva Kublina was a perfect 11­for-11 from the charity stripe, on her way to leading the team with 21 points. 
Mason and teammate Chrystal Starling also hit double figures for Virginia Tech, recording 11 and 16 points respectively. 
After recording its first positive assist-to-turnover ratio in several games against Georgetown, the Irish fell back into mid-sea­son woes with 21 turnovers and only 10 assists. Although they out-rebounded the Hokies by three, the Irish still struggled to shut off their opponent's ability to make second chance points. 
Batteast led the Irish with 13 points while forward Katy Flecky added 11. 
The loss marks the fifth Big East loss for the Irish and the seventh Big East victory for the Hokies. Sunday's game was an important one for both teams as the second half of the season gets under way and they vie for good position in the Big East tour­nament. 
Notre Dame will have three days off before facing St. John's Wednesday at home.

In front of a rather large crowd at Meyo Field in the Loftus Center last Saturday, the Irish lacrosse team impressed with a 15-9 exhibition win over the Titan Tour Major Lacrosse League team. 
Titan Tour was composed of -several top world players, including former Irish All­Americans Todd Rassas, Jimmy Keenan and Tom Glatzel. The team also featured three mem­bers ofthe U.S. National Team. 
One thing the MLL players didn't have was chemistry, as it was the first time they had played together, and h showed in the first two periods as the Irish leapt out to an impressive 12-3 lead at the half. 
"What I was looking for was to see how we could play as a team," said head coach Kevin Corrigan. "I was extremely happy with our first team defense." 
Junior Irish goalie Stewart Crosland was impressive with the start, turning away 13 of 16 shots from a team that claims the top two offensive players in the world. Senior Nick Antol replaced him in the fourth peri­od. 
In the first period, it looked as though the scrimmage would be a close match. as the teams knotted at a 2-2 tie early in the first period. 
With a series of beautiful passes and impressive deflec­tions, the Irish were able to score 10 straight unanswered goals. 
Impressive individual play allowed the Irish to score one of the 10 unanswered goals, as junior attacker Dan Berger stole a clearing pass from the Titan Tour goalie and shot it into the vacated goal to give Notre Dame a 10-2 lead. 
The Notre Dame defense almost achieved a shutout in the second period, but Titan Tour was able to score with just six seconds remaining to spoil that chance. 
Each team scored once in the third, with midfielder Travis Wells collecting the loose ball and banging it past the Titan Tour goalie to answer a goal from the MLL players and make the score 13-4 going into the fourth. 
In the fourth, Titan Tour started playing like the talented team they were, scoring five unanswered goals at one point and six total in the final period. The Irish only scored two more goals in the final 15 minutes. 
"I think we may have lost a bit of our aggressiveness after the first half," Corrigan said. "But [Titan Tour] is a good team, and they had a lot of pride to keep ihat game from being a blowout." 
The 17th-ranked Irish lacrosse team will begin the 2003 regular season on the road against No. 15 Penn State Feb. 23.
