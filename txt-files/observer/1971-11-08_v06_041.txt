Sence then, developement has been slow but determined. What is the use of the fieldhouse'? Consider the Art Department. According to Department Chairman Dr. Thomas Fern, "We have several classes (in the fieldhouse) and also many studios where various knids of independent effort, creative work, is going

Due to Congressional opposition 
US halts arms shipments to Pakistan 

(c) 1!171 New York Times 
Washington, Nov. 7--The United States plans to announce tomorrow the cancellation of licenses for the export of more than $3 million of military material to Pakistan. 
This will, in effect, end the controversial arms pipeline that has supplied Pakistan with spare parts and other military goods even though the administration imposed an arms freeze in early April. 
State Department officials, in disclosing the move, emphasized that the revocation of the licenses was done with the consent of the Pakistani government, which had been aware of the strong congressional opposition to the continued shipment of goods to Pakistan for possible use in crushing the rebellion in East Pakistan. 
Exempt from the ban will be $16,000 worth of spare parts already cleared by U.S. Customs and waiting shipment in New York pending the end of the dock­workers strike, the officials said. 

The officials said that Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India was informed of the license revocation shortly before she arrived in Washington last Wednesday for talks with President Nixon. It was stated in 
diplomatic  circles  that  the  
revocation  of  the  licenses  
removed  a  major  irritant  in  

Indian-American relations. 

Even though the amount of military equipment being sold to Pakistan in recent months was regularly described by the ad­ministration as "insignificant" and of little military importance, it was viewed by many Indians as indicative of a "pro-Pakistani" prejudice by the Nixon ad­ministration. 
Many U.S. Senators also complained that the flow of spare parts and other equipment was helping the government of Pakistani President Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan in crushing the East Pakistani independence movement and contributing to the flow of nearly \0 million Pakistanis who have fled to India. 
Following the Paksitani Ar­my's move against the East Pakistani insurgents last March 25, the United States stopped granting new licenses for miltary purchases in this country. Ac­tually, the March 25 decision did not go into effect until April6, and some licenses were approved in the interim, officials said. 
Moreover, licenses valid as of March 25 that expired were not renewed, and a "hold" was put on eertain heavy arms, previously approved for shipment, but still in American military depots. 
Officials said that at the time the decision to close down the "pipeline" was taken, Pakistan held about $2.3 million worth of valid licenses issued before April be settled primarily by the

Indian-Pakistani flareup a possibility 

by John Wick Three members of the Notre Dame Government and History departments agreed last night 
that India and Pakistan were on the verge of a major war with each other and that the United 
States would maintain a no­interference policy in any case; two members of the Government Department · Dr. Steven Kertesz and Dr. Michael Francis ­disagreed about Pakistan's future relations with the com­munist world. 
According to Kertesz, the crisis is bound to draw India closer to the People's Republic of China When questioned, he contended that in the past the Soviets have mediated between India and Pakistan, but he argued that dm. to treaties that have just been signed between India and the Soviet Union, Russia will-'un­doubtedly" have to devote much moe attention to India. Ac­cording to Kertesz, since Pakistan can "no longer count" on Russia, it has recently shifted its reliance to China. Dr. Kertesz added that though these treaties are supposedly non-military in nature, "It is certain that India 

can count on very close cooperation from Russia." 
Dr. Francis is more confident 
that Pakistan would steer clear of 
more communism in any form. 
He said Indian Premier Gandhi's

Harbison Award for teaching 
Dr. Joseph M. Duffy, a professor of English at the University of Notre Dame since 1954, has been named one of the 1971 winners of the Danforth Foundation's E. Harris Harbison Award for Gifted Teaching. Duffy, who will receive a $10,000 grant with the award, is the second Notre Dame faculty member in three years to be so honored. Rev. John S. Dunne, C.S.C., a theologian won the award in 1969. 
Announcement of the ten 1971 recipients was made at a dinner Saturday night in St. Louis. others are from Harvard, Boston and Temple Universities, thr Universities of California and Texas, the Massachusetts and California Institutes of Technology, and Lake Forest College. 
Duffy attended Columbia 
Harvard and 

the University of Chicago, where he received his doctorate in 1954. He also did post­
.J doctoral stuies at the 
Duffy University of 
Leeds 
The kind of teacher he is can perhaps be best illustrated by quoting from recent course evaluations published by the student-edited Scholastic magazine: "Duffy is a brilliant lecturer who demands only the interest of his students ... This is the study of literature at its finest, critical hardnosed best. .. Most students who have had this course <Literature and the Imagination) consider it one of the two or three best courses they had at Notre Dame ... The paper and test topics are profound and demand serious and original work ... Mr. Duffy's lectures are so excellent that the student feels a moral demand to reciprocate with excellence." 
Winners of the Harbison awar:ds are chosen annually by panels of educators who make their selections from nominations submitted by colleagues, students, past award winners, and college and· university presidents. To be eligible for an award the can­didate must be teaching in an accredited college, junior college or university in the United States and have served as full-time faculty for at least five years. 
An educator noinated for the award is judged on the basis of his capability as . . . "an ar­ticulate, passionate teacher who

The Senate bill must pass 
As a prelude to the sort of dance macabre the President and the Senate are currently going thtough on the question of pollution control, it might be wise to consider what William Ruckleshaus had to say when he visited Notre Dame last February. 
He argued that the states, hot after enough industry to keep themselves solvent and satisfied, would never be able to make and enforce anti-pollution legislation. He said that such legislation would have to come from the Federal Government. 
Last week the Senate passed, 86-0, the first truly Federal Antipollution measure ever. It would have placed responsibility for the enforcement of Federal antipollution laws in the hands of a federal agency ­the Environmental Protection Agency. It would have given the EPA the right to withdraw licensing permits from states which refused to enforce federal antipollution legislation. And it would have a}lowed the EPA to bring offending industries to court. 
Every voting member of the Senate was in favor of the bill. 
William Ruckelshaus was in favor of the bill -he still is. And William Ruckelshaus is not a lunatic radical or a self-seeking democrat. He is a Nixon Republican-the man who ran against Birch Bayh in 1968. He is simply a man who cares about clean air and water. 
But Richard Nixon is not in favor of the Bill. He's in favor of a bill that would allow the states to enforce lantipollution measures -the same states who are competing for heavy industry. The Nixon bill would have a state legislature attempt to enforce legislation that they know might drive industry out of their state. 
The Nixon Administration is now applying pressure on state governments, urging them to apply 
pressure  on  their  members  of  the  House  of  
Representatives. 'The object of all t his pressure~  to  
defeat the Senate bill.  

When he was here last February, William Ruckelshaus said that in the final analysis, society was the pollutor of this planet. And in society lay the solution to the problem. 
Consonant with this philosophy, we urge every student at this University to write his Congressman and discourage him from voting for anything but a bill that will affirm this nation's directive: to clean the air and the water. Society can put a certain brand of pressure on the Congress too. It's about time they began.

A Column of Priestly Advice 
I'm Not the Kind You Wind Up on Sundays 
One Saturday afternoon about a month ago, as I strolled across the beautiful St. Mary's campus, I was suddenly hailed from all directions with shouts of "Father, Father," and "Father, do you have a minute?" 
I certainly wasn't a father at that time <and I have reason to suspect that I still am not a father), but the sight of so many '.' · pretty chicks running toward, as opposed to away from, me gave cause for reflection, and as I paused I was trapped and beseiged with requests for priestly advice from at least ten girls, all of whom mistook me for the distinguished Director of Sanctity at SMC. Not being a priest, I objected strenuously, of course, but finally consented to a private discussion of the problems of each student, assuming that after I counselled no one would ever again suspect me of beinv a cleric. 
But to my surprise, no one would telieve my protestations of laity even after I had advised, and in the past month I hava been How about it? Can you tell the deluged with requests for aid difference between the

No doubt my visual double at SMC has received as many letters as have I requesting aid in spiritual matters, so in the spirit of true Christian clarity, I volunteer to take some of the cross from his shoulders by sharing my own advice in the form of a column of priestly advice to young Catholics. Write on and be saved. 
Dearest Reverend Ellis, 
I am a pagan student at Saint Mary's College. I love my gods and pray to them every night. They are not in my room with me, as your Christ is in church, but the idols and barbarous images I use are a quaint reminder of our cultural heritage. Do you think that the good sisters should be able to maka me move my idols?

school IS not a gay place to be 
Homosexuality at Notre Dame has long b~en a rather taboo subject. The following is presented 1n the hope offostering further discussion on the subject. It is for further understanding among the members of the community. The author grew up in Los Angeles where he attended school. He is presently working on the staff of the Center for Educational Ref?r~ and is working with the National Student Assoc1atwn. The following is reprinhed from the July issue of 'Ed­centric'. -ed. 
"you must be warren" 
As the clock drew nearer to ten o'clock, my fear 
became almost unbearable. I had long since stopped 
listening to my professor's lecture even though the 
material he was covering would undoubtedly be in­
cluded on the final. The anxiety I was feeling made 
attention impossible. I remember sitting in the 
clasroom shaking and dripping wet. I stared almost 
hypnotically at the second hand of the wall clock ­
suddenly the bell rang and class was over. 
Now I had to make the most important decision of 
my life. Was I going to keep my appointment with the 
unknown woman in the college union or was I going to 
stand her up and retreat to the security of my apart­
ment? As I made up my mind to carry through with 
the appointment, I found myself walking out of the 
room ignoring my classmates, trying to be as in­
conscipuous as possible. I was worried that someone 
would ask where I was going. 

I approached the union, trying to regain my com­
posure. I knew that I couldn't face anyone ~n the 
condition I was in, and if I continued to look so agttated, 
everyone would stare at me once I entered the building. 
I took a deep breath and went inside. Then I looked all 
over the cafeteria for the woman with the green blouse 
and blue pants. This was the outfit she had told me she 
would wear when I talked to her over the phone four 
hours earliar. 

Suddenly I saw her -she saw me at the same time 
and got out of her seat to greet me. She took my hand 
and brought me over to her table. 

"You must be Warren," she said. "My name is 
Lee." 

She was not at all as I had envisioned her. She had a 
kind, friendly face and long sensitive fingers. She 
spoke with an air of understanding which allowed me 
to relax in her presence. I wished, however, that we 
were alone somewhere instead of there in the cafeteria 
where at any time an acquaintance might come in and 
find out the nature of our meeting. 
"Lee," I said, "I called you because ... " At this 
point I became extremely tense and could no longer 
continue.  

"I know of your reasons for wanting to talk to me," 
she replied after almost an entire minute of silence. 
"I've found that many people are in your situation, and 
are in such desperation that they don't know where to 
turn. Please try to continue where you left off a minute 
ago. It would really be helpful to you if you could get 
out the words that are so disturbing to you." 
"Lee, I called you because ... because I think I ... I . 
.. I am a ho ... a homosexual." At that moment I 
placed my head in my hands and wanted to flee as fast 
as I could. After a minute or so she took my hand, and 
as she did, I could see her own eyes swelling with tears. 
It seemed that she knew the torment and self hatred 
which I was feeling because of the simple fact that she 
had gone through the same feelings herself. 
channelling 

I suppose that I have had "homosexual" feelings 
since I was seven or eight years old, but since that time 
until just a very few months ago, I was afraid to admit 
it to anyone, including myself. This meeting with the 
GLF coordinator on my college campus was such a 
threatening thing to me because like most of society, 
school is not a very "gay" place to be. For the 
homosexual in today's educational institutions, life is 
extremely oppressive, lonely and alienating. 
The chain of sexual oppression imposed by my 
schooling started the very first day I entered kin­
dergarten. As my mother dropped me off and kissed 
me good-bye, I felt very alone and began to cry. The 
teacher walked up and said in a rough voice: "Don't 
cry. Only sissies and little girls cry." In retro~pect. I 
realize that she was telling me to deny my feelmgs m 
order to fit a preconceived notion of masculinity, a 
norm I didn't fit and couldn't have fit if I had wanted to. 
Even back in kindergarten, boys were channelled in 
certain activties such as athletics while girls were 
channelled along the lines of housekeeping "skills." 
such as cooking and cleaning up the classroom. This 
channelling seemed to grow more intense in each 
consecutive level of grade school. 

the most oppressive years 
The atutuoes which my classmates developed were formulated within the family unit, but they were reinforced in the school settting. It was usually the girls who were encouraged by their teachers to take advantage of the field trips to the opera each semester, while the boys were pushed to attend a local big league baseball game. It was the girls who we~e allo~ed to help the teacher mix the paints for art perwd, while the boys were permitted to sometimes leave for recess early to get the balls out of the eq~ipme!lt rooms. These instances may appear to be qu1te mmor means of tracking a student accor~ing to sex, but they set. the stage for the most oppressive three years of my hfe ­
the years of junior high school. . 

During this period I began to develop physically and became more aware of my own body. I began to have definite sexual feelings for other members of my own sex. These were feelings which I didn't exactly un­derstand, although although they seemed ver~ real. Once I had a strong sexual attraction for a boy fnen~ of mine. When I told him that I wanted to embrace h1m, he looked at me in the strangest way and called me a "faggot." By that time in my life I knew what the term meant. I was told that "faggots" are homosexuals who are sick and who must go to a psychiatrist in order to be "normal." 
.~fc.b -,_ ,· 

In junior high, "normal" was defined ~Y the teach~rs of our sex education class -the phys1cal education staff. During the course, homosexuality was discussed when we were on the topic of "sexual deviates." If nothing else, this course taught me to keep my homosexual feelings well hidden. Whenever any of my friends told homosexual jokes, I was always the one who laughed the loudest, so no one would discover where I was really at. 
During these years, I hated to go to any school dances. Itwas not that I didn't like to dance, but rather than I wanted to dance with the other boys. Once I had a fantasy of dancing with a boy friend of mine in the privacy of my own room -how beautiful and free it was to finally carry out my desires. 
to never question 

Unfortunately, this was only a fantasy, a brief vision instead of an actual occurence. Subsequently, I rarely attended any of the dances because they were ex­tremely threatening to me. If I were discovered, I not only wouldn't have been able to face my friends and relatives, but I thought that I would have to be tran­sferred to another school so I wouldn't "disturb the educational environment" of my school Recently this was what happened when a 13-year-old told one of his junior high school teachers he was a homosexual. The principal immediately went to talk with his parents and stated that their son would not be allowed back to school unless he was admitted to a qualified psychologist for the purpose of altering his sexual preference. In this instance the parents accepted their son's feelings and were not intimidated by the school They threatened that if their son was not admitted back to the school immediately they would file suit through the American Civil Liberties Union. 
Junior high school sufficiently prepared me for my eventual high school experiences, teaching me ne~er to question the oppressive conditioning I was subjected to. I did not question the military drills in tenth grade physical education class; in eleventh grade I did not question the transfer of a fellow classmate to a con­tinuation school for alleged homosexual tendencies; and I did not question the statement of my twlefth grade English teacher tht "even though Andre Gide was a homosexual he was a good author in spite of it." I felt too threatened to speak out. I tried, instead, to play the games social pressure dictated to me. I went steady with a girl in my history class when I was a senior mainly because all of my friends were going steady and I felt isolated for not having a girlfriend myself. 
My own self-hatred was especially great in high school because I knew I was a homosexual but did not know how to handle it. There was no one to whom I could turn to for help. 
I graduated from high school with the hope that college life would somehow be different. I hoped that people would be more open-minded and readily open to change. To a great extent, this was true. In college, for the first time.. I joined with other people to demonstrate our open opposition to the war in Viet­nam ; now I felt the joy of joining with my Black ~nd Chicano sisters in our common struggle agamst housing discrimination around our campus by the campus slumlords. 
time drawing near 
All of these activities gave me a greater sense of worth, in that now I felt freer to act out many of my previously held ideals, but still something was missing. 
There remained within me a great void from which I could not escape. I knew the time was drawing near for me to make a decision of either coming out with my homosexuality to myself and to others, or else remaining in my suppressed state as I had done ever since I could remember. I continually asked myself why there were no openly Gay individiuals or gay organizations on my campus. 
Then one day in my campus newspaper I saw the headline, in big bold letters, "Gay Liberation Front Denied Campus Recognition." The article went on to say that the chancellor of the California State College system had denied recognition of the Campus Chapter of Gay Liberation Front on the premises that: 
1. 
" ... the effect of recognition by the college of Gay Liberation Front could conceivably be to endorse, or to promote homosexual behavior, to attract homosexuals to the campus, and to expose minors to homosexual advocacy and practices, and 

2. 
" ... belief that the proposed Front created too great a risk for students -a risk which might lead students to engage in illegal homosexual behavior." 


courage and involvement 
After my initial disgust and outrage for such absurd reasoning, I finally chose to "come out of my closet." I soon ch joined an encounter group in the college counseling center which allowed me to gain the support I needed to start to handle my homosexuality in a constructive way. Soon I gained the courage I needed to get in touch with the coordinator of the local Gay Liberation Front chapter as described in the beginning of this article. Since that time I have been involved heavily in gay politics and gay sensitivity groups. 
The void is finally being filled becausenow I have found people who are proud of their homosexuality ­people who are no longer going to put up with the op­pressive conditions which our society imposes on us every day of our lives. People are now fighting in the courts to get chapters of Gay Liberalion Front rein­stated on campuses. A precedent was recently decided in our favor by the Superior Court of Sacramento County, California. In this case, the GLF, represented by the Associated Students of Sacramento State College won a suit against the President of Sacramento State Colllege and the trustees of the California State College System which forced the state college to recognize GLF as a student organization. A court upheld the Associated Students contention that: 
"To justify suppression of free speech there must br reasonable grounds to fear that serious evil will result if free speech is practiced. There must be reasonable ground to believe that the danger apprehenrlPd is imminent." 
Using this precedent, other homosexual groups which have been denied recognition are now waging court battles throughout the nation. Also many groups have not had as much trouble as we have had for there are now over 150 campus homosexual groups throughout the United Staes. The purpose, as stated in one group's constitution, is: 
". . . to further self-understanding among the members, to promote in the community better un­derstanding of homosexuality, and to facilitate a strengthening of social ties between homosexuals and heterosexuals ... to provide ... members with legal, medical and psychological counseling and services as is necessary and proper." 
To be a homosexual in the educational institutions of this country is still extremely difficult even though conditions may appear to be changing for the better. I was able to begin the long process of personal liberation in spite of my teachers and the educational institutions. 
I realize that I can talk only of oppression from the viewpoint of a homosexual male,but the system which oppresses me also oppresses women,. both gay_ and straight, Black people, Chicanos, Nabve Amertcan:' and others. The fact which must be made known 1s 
that we are tired of waiting for change; we are bred of hiding our feelings and we are rising up with pride, love and solidarity.

Irish Frosh bow to Mich  
by Vic Dorr, '7-t Notre Dame's freshman football team suffered its first loss of the season Saturday morning, and in many ways the frosh defeat was "a typical Irish loss." When the final gun had soun­ded, Michigan's Baby Wolverines had placed the Irish yearlings on the short end of a 20-6 tally, but the score was a poor indication of the kind of game it was. Statistically, Notre Dame was the dominant team. The Irish frosh notched 20 first downs to 11 for Michigan, they passed for 197 yards to 104 for Michigan, and they gained 342 yards in total offense to 224 for Michigan. But the Irish also led in the turnover category--they lost four fumbles and three interceptions---and this, in the end, made the dif­ference. The Wolverines gained the scoreboard on the game's first play, when versatile David Brown grabbed the opening kickoff on his 21, hesitated a moment, and then raced through the ND coverage team for 79 yards and a score. Michigan's Mike Lantrey converted, and with but 12 seconds gone in the first period, the Wolverines were out in front to stay. The Wolverines were unable to move the ball on their next series of downs, so they punted to the ND 36, where QB Tom Clements directed the Irish offense on its first serious threat of the day. Back-to-back passes from Clements to wide receiver Pete Demerle moved the ball to the Michigan 38, and from there halfback Eric Penick squirmed for a first down at the 32. But Clements was dumped for a 16-yard loss on the next play, and when his fourth down toss to halfback Chuck Kelly fell in­complete in the end zone, Michigan took over on downs. The Wolverines were again unable to make any headway against the impressive Irish defense. and once more they were forced to punt. The kick rolled dead on the Notre Dame seven. and Clements tried again to get his team back into the game. The frosh offense picked up three first downs while moving the ball to their own 35, but Wolverine linebacker Carl Russ -stopped the drive with the first of his two interceptions, and he returned to the ND 34. From there, Wolverine QB Dennis Franklin sent halfback Dave Brown on a quick-out pattern to the right sideline. Irish defender AI Samuel had the ball played perfectly, but the pass glanced off his hands and was picked off by Brown, who carried it 35 yards for Michigan's second score of the game. The PAT failed, but Michigan still held a 13-0 lead with 4:41left in the first period. The Irish defense rose to its stiffest challenge of the day on Michigan's next possession. Facing a fourth-and-three from the ND 33, Wolverine QB Franklin decided to scramble, and made the first down yardage by the length of the football. Tailback Gil Chapman then slipped through left end for a first 
down at the Irish 11. Three plays

later, Chapman again carried, and he picked up a first down at the ND one by inches. 
An offsides penalty moved the ball back to the six, and from there Franklin's second-down pass was deflected by NO's charging defensive line. Tackle Kl'vin Nobusch broke through to sack Franklin for a four-yard loss on third down, and Michigan's fourth down attempt was stifled when the defense blocked a field goal, and recovered the ball at the ND 18. 
The Irish defense, which was forced to play with its back against the wall for most of the game, was given little time to rest after its sparkling goal-line effort. A snap over the head of ND punter Dave Schwarber gave Michigan a first down at the Irish 21, and then a personal foul in­
fraction  moved  the  ball  to  the  
eight.  
But  the  frosh  defense,  not  

resting on its earlier achievements, once again halted the Wolverine threat. The Irish offense took over on downs when Franklin's fourth down pass to runningback Rich Kaminski fell incomplete at the six. 
The Wolverines threatened once again before the half, when defensive end Richard VanTongeron scooped up an Eric Penick fumble at the Notre Dame 
24. But the defense stopped this attempt. too, when end Bob Sweeney dumped the MU quarterback for a seven-yard loss. 
The second half brought more of the same for the weary Irish defenders. A mix-up in the Irish 



Frosh wide receiver Pete Demerle caught six passes against 
Michigan. backfield resulted in a fumble which Michigan recovered on the Notre Dame 11. The Wolverines advanced to fourth-and-goal from the six, but again the ND pass rush deflected one of Franklin's aerials, and the ball turned over. 
But just as the Irish "D" was good enough to stop Michigan again from within the 10, the Irish offense was again plagued by bad hands. A second backfield mixup Lrought on another ND fumble, and the Wolverines recovered this one at the ND 18. 
And this time there were no defensive heroics. On first down, the Michigan QB rolled to his right and lobbed a pass to Glenn Franklin in the right flat. Franklin, who had come out of the backfield, was all alone, and 
he  carried  18  yards  for  
Michigan's  final  score  of  the  
game.

Despite its attack of "fumble­itis, the Irish offense did move the ball fairly consistently throughout the game. But it was not until the fourth period that Clements was able to generate a scoring drvie. Starting from the ND 26, Clements hit Penick for a gain of nine, and then the Irish got a break when Michigan was caught interfering at midfield. A draw to Penick netted 12 yards to thl' 38. Then, with third-and-six from the 34, Clements rolled left, picked up several sharp blocks, and scrambled his way to the Wolverine 13. 
Thl'n, on fourth-and-six form the nine, Clements hit halfback Chuck Kelly on a crossing pattern at the one to give the Irish a first down. Ronny Goodman swept left end for the score at 9:22 of the fourth period, but the point after was blocked, and the 20-6 score stood up for the rest of the game. 
Kelly and Penick were the game's leading rushers, picking up 55 yards <on eight tries) and 49 yards (on 13 carries). Gil Chapman was the leading ground gainer for Michigan, picking up 42 yards in 15 carries. Clements was the game's top passer, hit­ting on 17 of 40 for 197 yards, but with three interceptions. Demerle, though he was shaken up late in the first half and did not see further action, was the leading receiver with six catches for 90 yards. 
For Michigan, Franklin was 4 of 13 through the air, and his backup, John Spahn, was 2 of 4. Glenn Franklin was the leading Wolverine pass-catcher, as his four catches for 64 yards and one TD netted him top honors. 
The loss brings the Irish record to 2-1, with but one game left to be played. That contest will take place next Saturday in Knoxville, Tl'nn., when the Irish yearlings meet Tennessee's Baby Volun­teers.

ND smashes Pittsburgh, 56-7 
Eight TD outburst is season's best performance 
by Jim Donaldson Sports Editor 

Pittsburgh -Throughout the s('ason, while the Notre Dame offense has sputtered along, averaging Pbout two touchdowns a game, the coaches and players frequently remarked, "One of these days, we're going to put it all together and when we do ­watch out." The Irish "Put it all together" Saturday afternoon in Pitt Stadium_ 
Sl·oring two touchdowns in every quarter, Notre Dame ncorded its seventh win in eight ganw.s this fall by demolishing l'ittshurgh, 56-7. 
The Irish offPnse, which has 

hcl'n largely overshadowed by 
Ihe prowess of the Irish defensive 
unit during the year, had its day 
in lhl' sun, what little of it there 
was shining in the Steel City, 
Saturday and turned in its finest lll'rformunce of the season. The Irish compiled 5:J4 yards in total offense. 4fl4 yards coming on the ground, and completely dominated an outclassed Pitt ch·fcnse. 
Five players scored touch­downs for the Irish as Notre J>amt' posted its highest point lotul since last year's Navy gaml'. Eddie Gulyas led the Sl'oring parade by running for three scores, Larry Parker added a pair of six-pointers and Tom l:atlwood. Willie Townsend and Darryl Dewan had one touch­down apiece. 
Irish quarterback Cliff Brown, making his collegiate debut in his home state, did a fine job of hading thl' Notre Dame attack . liP topp('d the Irish in rushing, gaining 92 yards in nine carries, including a 47 yard run, the longest ND rush from scrimmage this fall. Brown also completed three of Reven passes for 51 yards and a touchdown and directed six of Notre Dame's scoring drives. Brown wus voted "Player of the <:arne" by the writers in the prt>ss box for his fine per­formance. 
Commmting on Brown's play, l'oach Ara Parseghian said, "Everyone has been expecting too much from Cliff. He has four games under his belt and still rweds plenty of work. But he runs Wl'll and gives us a little more consistency each week. This was his best day and I hope he keeps improving." 
It didn't take Brown and the Irish long to "get it together" against Pitt. Notre Dame showed the Panthers just how things Wl're going to be by taking the opl'ning kickoff and marching 77 yards in I:J plays for a touch­down. 
ThP Irish covered lhl' mtire distance on the ground, Parker skirting ll'ft end from nine uyards out for the score only 4:21 into the first quarter. Gulyas and Bob Minnix contributed big plays in the drive, Gulyas running for 20 ~·ards on a third down play and Minnix picking up 16 on an end SWl't>p. Bob Thomas, kicking into a 22-rnilc an hour wind, missed the txtra point attempt, his first had boot of the year after 12 straight, and the Irish settled for an early fl-O lead. 
The Panthers managed to stop the Irish on their next two sortil's down the field, but Notre Dame was able to break through 
for their  second touchdown  in  
the  final  minute  of  the  first  
quartl'r.  
Parker  scored  his  second  

touchdown of the day on a six yard run over left tackle with 35 seconds remaining in the opening period to cap a 49 yard. ten play Irish drive. 
Notre Daml' went for a two­point conversion and was suc­cessful, Minnix going around the right side, behind the blocking of f''rank Pomarico, to make it 14-0. 
A Pittsburgh miscue on the <'nsuing kickoff gave the Irish a break and set up Notre Dame's third touchdown. The Panthers' John Chatman returned Brown's kickoff to the Pitt 25 but fumbled it away there to Tom Devine. 
Seven plays Iater, the Irish made it a 21-0 ballgame. Brown was the big gainer in the short march, picking up 19 yards in three carries, and Gulyas carried the ball in from the one for the score. Thomas booted the extra point just 2:22 into the second quarter. 
Pitt was unable to move the ball following the kickoff and, after three plays netted the the Pitt 26, and, eight plays later, 

the Irish had another touchdown. 
Brown threw his second touch­down pass of the season, on a fourth and goal situation at the eight, for the tally. All-American split end Tom Gatewood was on the receiving end of Brown's aerial and Thomas added the extra point. The scoring grab wus Gatewood's third of the year. , 
After that score, Parseghian substituted liberally but the Irish continued to pile up the points, adding a pair of fourth quarter touchdowns. 
l<:arly in the final stanza, Willie Townsend scored from 12 yards out on a double reverse, hurdling over the last defender and into the Pnd zone for his first Notre Dame touchdown. Darryl Dewan 
uccounted for the final Irish 
score, going in from the five yard 
line with 6:47 remaining. 
Thomas converted after both 
touchdowns. 
Notre Dame almost scored 
ugain in the waning minutes of 
the contest, driving to the Pitt one 
before yielding the ball on downs 
on thP next-to-last play of the 
game. 

Statistically, as well as on the 
scoreboard, the Irish completely 
overpowered the Panthers. Pitt 
was limited to only 113 total 
yards and picked up just seven 
first downs, compared with Notre 
Dame's 28. Notre name was the 
first team Pitt had faced in­
cluding Oklahoma, to r~ord 
more first downs than the 
Panthers. 

The Irish also had possession 
of the ball most of the game, 
running 99 plays to Pitt's 46. 
"I certainly didn't expect to 
lose that badly," Panther coach 
Carl DePasqua said afterwards. 
"They simply five and six yarded 
us to death." 
ThP victory almost proved a costly one for the Irish as their dPfensive leader, Walt Patulski, was carried from the field on a stretcher. The preliminary diagnosis was merely "a bruised kneecap," according to Dr. George Green, the team physician. ~­
"We'll have to wait for X-rays to determine if 'Walter will be with us for Tulane next week," Parseghian corrmented. 
The Irish will host the Green Wuve in the season's home finale in Notre name Stadium next Saturday while the Panthers will travel to Wtst Point, N.Y. to take on Army. 

Cliff Brown was named the Player of the Game for his performance against Pittsburgh. Brown was Notre Dame's leading rusher, gaining !12 yards, and connected on three of seven pass attempts for 51 yard'> and a touchdown. In this photo. John Cieszowski takes out Joe llern· don to pave the way for a gain by Brown.

Panthers seven yards, they punted back to Notre Dame, Mike Crotty making a fair catch at his own 39. 
Once again, the relentless Irish drove for a touchdown. Ed Gulyas carried for five yards to the 44 and then Brown ripped off a 47 yard run to the Pitt nine on a quarterback sneak. Four plays later, Gulyas hulled his way into paydirt from the one and again Thomas converted,giving the Irish a 28-0 lead with 8:26 left until halftime. 
The Panthers mounted their only scoring drive of the af­ternoon after Gulyas' second score. Pitt was able to move from its own 17 tO the ND 12 in just five plays, thanks largely to a 16 yard run by Paul Felinczak and a 35 yard pass from John Hogan to Stan Ostrowski. 
FPiinczak carried to the Irish II on a first down play but Walt Patulski dropped Hogan for a loss, back to the ND 25, on second down. A third down pass went incomplete but on a fourth down aerial to Ostrowski, Notre Dame's Mike Crotty was called for inteference and the Pan­thers had a first down at the Irish one. 
It took Pitt three plays to score from there, Hogan finally sneaking over right tackle for the touchdown. I<:ric Knisley kicked the extra point to make it 28-7 with only I :40 remaining but that was as close as the Panthers were to come. 
The Trish almost added to their lead in the waning seconds of the first half. driving to the Pitt one before Parker fumbled the ball awuy after being hit by the panthers outstanding linebacker, Ralph Cindrich.

Washington--State Deparment officials disclosed that the United States would ~nnounce Monday the cancellation of export licenses for more than $3 million worth of military matertal for Pakistan. The move, which will end the pipeline that has supplied Pakistan with arms despite an announced arms freeze in April, was '>aid to have the consent of the Pakistani government. 
New Delhi--Unimpeachable Indian sources said that Indian troops had twice entered East Pakistan to silence artillery that was shelling Indian territory. India has officially denied such· intrusion into Pakistani territoy. It was the first con­firmation of a border crossing by the Indians during the current crisis. 
Moscow--The Soviet Union commemorated the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917 with its annual "October Revolution" parade in Moscow, and Western diplomatic and military spE;_cialists said the Russian military might that passed in review before the assembled Soviet leaders in Red Square contained nothing new in the way of weaponry.
