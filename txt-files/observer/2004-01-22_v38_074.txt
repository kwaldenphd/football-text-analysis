Students attend March for Life in Washington 
By MATT BRAMANTI 
News Writer 

Over 30 years ago, the Supreme Court legalized abortion, but for several Notre Dame and St. Mary's students, the matter is far from settled. 
About 200 students will attend the 31st annual March for Life in Washington today. Janel Daufenbach, president of Notre Dame Hight to Life, said the march oll'crs a valuable opportu­nity to express the pro-life mes­sage. 
"We're going to protest the 31st anniversary of Hoe v. Wade," Daufenbach said, referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion on demand. "It's very powerful to see so many people protesting this horrible law. 
Chartered buses carrying the students left Wednesday evening to travel to the nation's capital. 
Later today, the students will join about 200,000 other pro-life advocates in a march from the Washington Monument to the Supreme Court. 
"It's heartening to see so many college students," she said. 
Daufenbach went on to say the marchers hope to change public perceptions surrounding the abortion debate. 
"If we really want to change the world, we have to change how people view the beginning of a child's life," she said. 
Some members of the Notre Dame delegation will also partici­pate in a student leadership con­ference sponsored by American Collegiates for Life, a student pro­life organization. The conference, to. be held Friday and Saturday at Catholic University, will feature an address by Bernard Nathanson, a former pro-choice activist who is now against abortion.

The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has published the findings of an audit meant to gauge how well each of its 195 dioceses and eparchies in the country is complying with new guidelines to reduce sexual abuse by priests and lay church workers and reach out to victims. 
The report was part of the USCCB"s response· to the sex scan­dal that has rocked the Catholic Church for the past two years. When reports that former Boston Cardinal Bernard Law moved a priest, John Geoghan. from parish to parish despite evidence that he sexually abused children, the church was faced with one of its biggest public scandals in history. 
Faced with mounting criticism and negative press, the USCCB adopted the "Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People" in June 2002. The charter established the USCCB Office of Child and Youth Protection, which is monitored by a national review board composed of lay Catholics. The OCYP was required to create an auditing system to monitor the progress of each diocese and eparchy toward compliance with the charter. The results of the audit are published in a public annual report. 
The audit process consisted of an onsite review of each diocese and eparchy by investigator selected by the USCCB. The Gavin Group, Inc. of Boston. a corporate

Human rights activist Kerry Kennedy will speak as the Keynote Address Speaker in Saint Mary's annual Play of the Mind conference tonight at 7:30 
p.m. in O'Laughlin Auditorium. She is the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, and has led over 40 human rights delegations in 30 different countries. 
Kennedy has worked on a variety of human rights issues from child labor and ethnic vio­lence to the environment and women's rights. It is hoped that her interaction with students, faculty and administrators from different schools and back­grounds will lead to a greater understanding of others and themselves. 
"Kerry Kennedy was selected because she herself represents the impact that one individual can have on the world," event coordinator Marcia Rickard said. 
Kennedy is also the author of "Speak Truth to Power: Human Rights Defenders who are Changing our World," which fea­tures interviews from human rights activists from around the world. A theater production based on this book will be pre­sented in April.

Ten other colleges have been invited to this year's event. These schools are from all over the country; some from as close as Holy Cross College to as far away as Bennett College in Greensboro, N.C. 

"The theme, Examining Identity, was chosen for the Play of the Mind Conference to link with the first-year theme of the College because it is one which is so important for all of us," said Rickard. 
The Play of the Mind confer­ence began in 1991 and has been held every January since then. The goal of this year's con­ference is to vigorously explore the responsibilities an intellect h8lds in today's world to make a difference in the world. Students, faculty and administrators will

Chinese food here 
Happy 4 701! That's right, it's the Chinese New Year. 
This week marks the beginning of the Year of the Monkey in the Chinese lunar calendar. And what better way to 
celebrate than by ordering some Chinese food, delivered right to your dorm by the friendly people at Golden Dragon? 
Let me start by 


saying that Knott Matt Bramantl Hall loves South Bend's finest Chinese delivery Wire Editor shop. When I say "loves," I don't just mean we enjoy their food. We love them like mothers Jove their babies, like hip­pies love their Birkenstocks, like Howard Dean loves screaming like a maniac. 
I hardly know where to begin, as 
I extol the virtues of the Juggs' 
favorite supplier of Eastern 
delights. 
The variety is simply astonishing. The Dragon's minions serve six­count 'em, six-varieties of lo mein. My personal favorite is roast pork, but beef, chicken, veggie, shrimp, and "house special" can all be had, and they're all pretty good. At under eight bucks a quart, it's the best deal this side of the Great Wall. 
And the General Tso's chicken is some of the best I've had. What would a Chinese menu be without. the contributions of the Szechuan Army's best-fed commander? 
Even better, the menu is not only extensive, but entertaining. Until recently, the cover of the menu proclaimed, "We Delivery!" 
And they do. 
Just pick up the phone, dial 243­8800, and a half hour later you're the proud recipient of a hot, nonde­script paper bag. You open the bag to find not only your order, but a treasure trove of goodies: free soy sauce, free fortune cookies, and enough free sweet-and-sour sauce to float an aircraft carrier. 
If you're really lucky, the delivery guy will even bring you a calendar, featuring either serene Chinese landscapes or lovely Asian ladies. 
As the smell of hot, fresh Chinese food wafts through the corridors, guys in your section start peeking out their doors. And you hear the same question over and over: "Did you get Golden Dragon?" 
Of course I did, and so should you. After all, 1.1 billion Chinese can't be wrong.

ST. LOUIS -A 412­pound trucker who says he was fired for being unable to fit into a smaller tractor assigned to him got an apology and a right-sized rig from the company Wednesday, resolving a flap both sides passed off as a big misunderstanding. 
Walter Geter, 49, also got back pay to cover his wages since his firing last Thursday, offered up by USF Holland Inc. during a brief hearing over the grievance he filed last week with Teamsters Local 600. 
"They were so apolo­getic, told me it was a mis­take and told me this would never happen again, that I'd always have a truck that I could fit it," 6­foot-2 Geter said from his home in Berkeley, a St. Louis suburb. "They were just the nicest people you would ever want to meet."

Seniors graduate early, reflect trend 
By WILL PUCKETT 
News Writer 
Heflecting a growing trend of more and more seniors receiving diplomas in January, 115 seniors graduated on Jan. 4. 
According to information provided by the Registrar's Office, 63 seniors, or just more than half of the 115 January graduates, were graduating in seven semes­ters. 
The remainder had taken at least nine semesters, although the data does not account for circumstances such as leaves of absence or deferral of graduation, said Nancy Osth, commencement coordinator. 
The total number of under­graduate diplomas granted in January has risen in the past few years. In 2003, there were 122 graduates in January, although it is not certain how many of those were early graduates. 
Prior to· that, in 2002, January graduates totaled 83, although it is again unclear how many of that number graduated early. Before 2002, the number is believed to have been relatively consis­tent. 
The most recently publi­cized January graduation was former student body president Pat Hallahan.

Army boots memorialize soldiers 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -More than 500 pairs of empty Army boots were placed side-by-side in downtown Chicago Wednesday to serve as a reminder of U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq. 
The black boots, some dusty and dirty from use, were placed on Federal Plaza in front of a posterboard display that listed the names, ages and states of all soldiers killed in the war. 
"These young men and women will not have died in vain if truth triumphs," said Michael McConnell. regional director of the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker peace and social justice group that sponsored the memorial. 
He referred to President Bush's State of the Union address a day earlier in which the president urged the nation to stay the course. "We say reverse the course," McConnell said. "Admit that this war was fought under false pretenses." 
The United States has not been able to find any banned weapons in Iraq, which in large part was Bush's justification for going to war. 
White House spokesman Jim Morrell said Bush "appreciates that we live in a free society where people are free to express their views. But as the president said ... the world is a safer place witho.ut Saddam Hussein's regime." 
The memorial served as a powerful symbol for visitor Becky Schillo. 
"You hear about one or two soldiers being killed, then 500," the 24-year-old said. "It kind of hits home." 
As of Wednesday, 503 U.S. service members have died since the beginning of military operations in Iraq, both from hostile and non-hostile causes. according to the military. 

Conunittee votes on terrorislll bill 

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A House committee recommended legis­lation Wednesday that would provide for fast special elections if a terrorist attack killed or incapacitated many House members. 
The measure would require expedited elections under "extraordinary circumstances" when the speaker of the House announces that vacancies in the 435-member chamber exceed, 100. 
The bill, approved 18-10, stip­ulates that parties choose candi­dates within 10 days of that announcement and that state elections be held within 45 days. 
The legislation has also been approved by the House Administration Committee and now goes to the full House for consideration. 
Lawmakers have been consid­ering the ramifications of mass casualties in Congress since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. The Senate would be less of a prob­lem because governors can appoint senators when vacan­cies arise prior to an election. Vacancies in the House are filled by special elections. 
Some lawmakers, and an 

independent commission creat­ed after the 2001 attacks, have backed the idea of a constitu­tional amendment that would give the states the flexibility to fill House vacancies either by special elections or appoint­ment. 
But House Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner, H-Wis., the main sponsor of the legislation considered on Wednesday, has opposed the amendment route, saying the House should main­tain its status as a popularly elected body. His bill, he said. would "protect the people's right to chosen representation."

consulting and auditing firm, was hired to serve as an independent agency to verify the results. The Gavin Group sent teams of two to six auditors to 191 sites to inter­view administrators, review doc­uments and policies and issue instructions to dioceses and eparchies found to not be in com­pliance. 
·The Diocese of Fort Wayne­South Bend, which incorporates Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, was audited last August and was found to be compliant with the charter. The audit indicated that the diocese had established an effective prevention policy and a well-publicized code of conduct for priests, deacons and other church personnel who have con­tact with children; no allegations of se~ual misconduct have been reported to the diocese since June 2002 when the auditing system began monitoring, though a statement by Bishop John D'Arcy has indicated the diocese has found credible claims of sex­ual misconduct involving minors against 16 different priests (12 with boys, four with girls). None of these claims involved physical sexual abuse since 1987, he said. The diocese was commended for its early establishment of a sexu­al abuse policy involving minors, which was implemented in 1990. 
The Diocese of Fort Wayne­South Bend includes 14 counties in northeastern Indiana and serves a population of 167,000 registered Catholics with 22 dea­cons and 64 diocesan priests. 
But critics say that the audit can be misleading and does not go far enough in dealing with the sex abuse scandal by allowing the church to keep too much information private. Lois Myers, the Indiana coordinator of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, said that the auditing process has not made the church publicly accountable. 
"They're not any more forth­coming then they have to be," Myers said. "They're forthcoming now because they're backed into a corner, but they're not being as compliant as they could be. I want to see names. I want to see records." 
Myers said that the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend has not allowed victims and survivors of abuse to be involved in the process of reviewing claims of sexual misconduct by priests ­input that she thinks is essential to correcting a system that turned a blind eye and, in some cases, covered up such abuse. And Myers knows the frustration. She brought a claim of sexual abuse by a priest to court in 1991, but it was dismissed in 1993 as not being credible, sounding "more like something out of a horror movie" than a parochial school. 
"My claim was not found 'cred­ible,' but I can tell you that I was raped and molested for three years,'' Myers said. 
Myers thinks that her case might have been more successful if it had been filed today than a decade ago, but said that dioce­ses are still able to brush victims of abuse under the rug by set­tling cases out of court for cash payouts in exchange for confi­dentiality agreements like the one she said her sister signed. 
"There's still too much secrecy here; still to much cover-up," Myers said. "You're seen as a potential lawsuit and they are just trying to see what they can do to make sure it doesn't get out of hand.

Falun Gong leader accuses Beijing 
IlONG KONG -In a rare televised appear­ance, Falun Gong founder Li 1-longzhi said Wednesday that Beijing cracked down on the meditation group because government lead­<ws envied its popularity.

Mainland China outlawed Falun Gong in 1'JIJ<J as a threat to communist rule, but Li said the group -which has attracted mil­lions of followers -has never been interest­ed in challenging the government.

Crime database contains personal info 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -A federally funded crime database run by seven states is looking increas­ingly to privacy advocates like a potent substitute for the data-mining program the Pentagon scrapped after public rebuke. 
Law enforcement officials and the private company that manages the database, known as Matrix, say it merely streamlines police access to information about suspects that authorities have long been able to get from disparate sources. 
But newly emerging facts about the program, including documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union, indicate it could also be made to sift through vast stores of Americans' personal data ­some 20 billion records -and proactively finger crime and terrorism suspects. 
Combining state records with databases owned by Seisint Inc., Matrix details -among other things -the property, boats and Internet domains people own, their address his­tory, utility connections, bank­ruptcies, liens and business fil­ings, according to an August report by the Georgia state Office of Homeland Security. 
The report, which was once posted on a state Web site, offers a broader glimpse of Matrix -short for the Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange -than its guardians are generally willing to make public. 
"This is a major program 
. with very large ambitions, and it needs to be publicly exam­ined. We shouldn't be forced to read tea leaves," said Barry Steinhardt, who heads the ACLU's technology and liberty program. 
The August report touts Matrix's ability to display infor­mation quickly, along with pic­tures of some people on file, and perform analysis: "The user can easily see relation­ships between people, places and things that were previously impossible to discern." 
"With minimal input and the push of a button, witnesses, associates, relatives and sus­pects can be identified and located," adds the report, which was cited in a December Supreme Court filing by the Electronic Privacy Information Center. 
References to Matrix's analy­sis capabilities also emerged in documents obtained by the ACLU under the open-records law in Pennsylvania, one of the participating states. 
Among the files were two 2003 memorandums of under­standing between Pennsylvania officials and Florida police that discussed how Matrix would be used for both criminal investi­gations and "intelligence pur­poses." 
Also, the minutes of an October 2002 planning meeting attended by representatives of 12 states, the FBI and Seisint reveal new details about the involvement of the federal gov­ernment, which seeded Matrix with $12 million and has access to it through the FBI and Department of Homeland Security. 
Those minutes note that the FBI, Secret Service and two agencies now under Homeland Security -the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Drug Enforcement Agency -helped Florida officials craft data-mining software for Matrix. 
In another link with the gov­ernment, Seisint has former federal and state law enforce­ment officials on staff. includ­ing managing director Brian Stafford, former head of the Secret Service. 

"This is the state version of TIA," Steinhardt said. referring to the Pentagon's Terrorism Information Awareness pro­gram, which was. shelved last year after a public uproar and a Congressional inquiry. 
The TIA and its original leader, Adm. John Poindexter, aimed to spot patterns in a much bigger pool of data than Matrix possesses, and people involved in Matrix reject any comparison. They say Matrix essentially is a revved-up search engine, not a surveil­lance tool. 
Launched in response to Sept. 11, Matrix lets states share criminal, prison and vehicle information and cross­reference it with databases held by Seisint, including civil court records, voter registra­tions and address histories going back as long as 30 years. 
Officials at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which oversees the program, say the files do not include phone records, financial transactions or other material that would require a court order for law enforce­ment to see. 
For now the project involves Connecticut, Florida, Mich­igan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Utah. About 450 law enforcement agents are using the system, according to Clay Jester, Matrix coordina­tor for the Institute for Intergovernmental Research, the nonprofit group helping to expand the project from its original implementation in Florida. 

Modified bollworms could combat disease 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO -Some high-tech insect experiments soon may be flitting out of the laboratory: Mosquitos geneti­cally modified to eliminate malaria. Silkworms engineered to produce bulletproof vests. Bollworm moths designed to self-destruct before they can wipe out cotton crops. 
Genetically engineered insects hold the promise of benefiting millions, eradicating diseases and plagues that cause famine in the developing world. 
But despite such good inten­tions, many scientists are alarmed that few safeguards exist to keep unintended conse­quences from harming humans or the environment. 
Fast-producing insects anchor food chains around the globe. Yet the impact that genetically engineered bugs could have on ecosystems is only now being explored, even as researchers push to release biotech insect experiments into the wild. 
Such questions could be vital­ly important, particularly since many researchers are engi­neering insects designed to change the genetic makeup of their very species. 
Unlike with biotech crops or livestock, which are at least designed to be controlled, the goal of much of this insect research is to introduce geneti­cally engineered traits into nat­ural insect populations -for example, rendering tsetse flies incapable of carrying deadly sleeping sickness, a disease that afflicts millions in Africa.

has been conducted outside a laboratory yet, but a few proj­ects are getting close -a prospect that prompted the Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology, in a report being released Thursday, to call on the federal government to adopt strict regulations. 
"Usually, biotechnology seems to move more quickly than the regulations," said Michael Fernandez, Pew's sci­ence director. "But in this case, we have the time." 
No U.S. law specifically addresses biotech bugs. The 
U.S. Department of Agriculture's written policy on engineered insects asserts reg­ulatory authority only over "plant pests," requiring"'lhat any outdoor experiment get prior federal approval. 
Bob Rose, a USDA scientist, said federal agencies can and probably will assert authority over many of these projects ­with some creative categoriz­ing. For instance, Rose said the USDA has authority to regulate insects that cause disease in animals. Mosquitoes are live­stock pests and Rose said genetically engineered malaria fighters could be brought under USDA's authority in that way. 
Rose also says biotech insect research is still in its infancy. Still, he concedes more explicit regulations as called for by Pew would eliminate many of the regulatory loopholes being exploited by biotech compa­nies. For example, no regulator stepped in to monitor the Glofish, a fluorescent zebra fish recently put on the market, because no federal agency was specifically tasked with over­seeing biotech house pets.

One potential juror answered in the question­naire that he did not trust Stewart. In a follow-up interview, he told the judge: "Sometimes people that are -that are power­ful are not so trustworthy." He was disqualified from the jury. 
A woman reported that she worked on a trading desk at a securities firm where the Stewart case is talked about "very regular­ly" and said she would have trouble ignoring news reports about the trial. She was disqualified. 
But before she left the judge's private robing room, according to the transcript, she told Stewart: "I am a huge fan of yours. Good luck." 
Other potential jurors were cleared by the judge despite coming from lines of work, or expressing cer­tain feelings, that lawyers found troubling -a sign of the difficulty in picking a jury in such a highly publi­cized case. 
One woman was allowed to stay after saying she did not believe the government was doing enough to prose­cute corporate scandals. And a man was cleared after saying he believed money, in some cases, could buy justice.

The Dow closed up 94.96, or 0.9 percent, at 10,623.62. It was the highest close for the index stocks since March 19, 2002, when it ended the day at 10,635.25. 
The broader gauges were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index closed down 5.53, or 0.3 percent, at 2,142.45. The S&P 500 gained 8.85, or 0.8 percent, to 1,147.62-its highest close since March 22, 2002, when it finished at 1,148.70.

Much of the advance came late in the day. Earlier, earnings reports appeared to be motivating some investors to sell, said Todd Clark, head of listed equity trading at Wells Fargo Securities. 
"Even some of the stocks that have had great results, like Merrill Lynch are down on profit taking," Clark said. "Others are falling because of concerns about outlook." 
Overall, fourth-quarter earnings are expected to rise 20 percent, but that may not be enough to match investors' heightened expectations. Still, most analysts remain bullish about equities over the long term. 
"The market is sorting out a num­ber of things," said Kevin Caron, mar­ket strategist with Ryan, Beck & Co.,

NEW YORK-Strong bank earn­ings pushed the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 index to new 22-month highs Wednesday, but technology stocks lagged on disappointing news from Lucent Technologies and Motorola. 
With little market-moving news coming out of President Bush's State of the Union address Tuesday night, analysts attributed the gains to upbeat quarterly profit reports, led by 
J.P. Morgan Chase. However. six weeks of advances in tech and telecommunications stocks prompted many investors to collect profits in those sectors.

The power of e·ngineering 

Students in engineering here can feel torn. Answering Notre Dame's call to service is challenging. I considered dropping engineering as a freshman because I couldn't connect engineer­ing to Notre Dame's social Andrew causes. I know 
DeBerry 
now that leaving engineering would have been ND Changing 
a terrible waste. Times 
Ideas on this conviction come through six people interviewed in the College of Engineering, ranging from an undergraduate student to Engineering Dean Frank Incropera. The central message I want to get out to students in our college is that engi­neers have a tremendous power to improve society in ways the world desperately needs. 
Professor Stephen Silliman, Associate Dean and 2003 College of Engineering Professor of the Year, fre­quently takes students to Haiti to work on water pumps. He is firm in saying "engineers are by definition in serv­ice." 
Geoscience graduate student Pamela Crane emphasizes immersion with people in a holistic approach to apply­ing technology. She mostly grew up in developing countries since her father worked for the U.S. Agency for International Development. Without having a personal connection, techni­cal solutions may not be accepted by those most needing them. Effective engineering requires both technical and social understanding. 
One senior mechanical engineer who started a summer camp for children of parents with cancer and who taught at AIDS seminars in Ghana through the Center for Social Concerns holds that engineers have great power in addressing non-technical problems. We have a different approach to prob­lem solving thatcan be a key asset. 
It can be difficult to act on these high ideals as a student, so here are four ideas that may help: 
+ 
Local schools need engineering stu­dents to tutor. The CSC has a board with tutor requests for students to fill. 

+ 
NO's Habitat for Humanity is one of the larger chapters in the country and can expose engineering students to community needs and the needed real-world coordination skills. 

+ 
The Student International Business Club has divisions that can allow engi­neering students to put their technical skills to use while gaining professional business experience. 


+The CSC also provides opportunities to study infrastructure and develop­ment over any break, whether in cities nationwide through the 48-hour Urban Plunge the Summer Service Learning Project. 
If free time is lacking, this second set of suggestions can help students 


for society 
integrate service into the curriculum: 
+ 
Research Experience for Undergraduates has diverse projects allowing students to pursue their interest while gaining early research experience. 

+ 
Silliman brings students to Haiti to work on and teach about water pumps. 

+ 
Professors have research projects that help local communities which need student support. For example, Professor Jeffrey Talley is pursuing a project that would have engineering students develop sensors to monitor pollution and other environmental health issues as part of an environ­mental justice project in a local eco­nomically and disadvantaged commu­nity. 

+ 
Engineering Projects in Community Service links students with local busi­nesses and government groups so they can have a local impact. Next year, 


this program will be execut­ed through the depart­mental levels where projects will have a more direct link to one's major. 
If an upper­
_classmen takes three credits in any of these opportu· nities, it will countas a tech­nical elec­tive. Contact profes­sors, your depart-
me~ 
chair, and the Dean's office to learn more. 
In the Strategic Review posted on its homepage, the College of Engineering notes that students have a lacking understanding of engineering and its impact_on society. Accordingly, the College is seeking to develop courses involving economic, ethical and political issues. Incropera has an inspired vision for his graduates: "I want our engineering students to go out there and really make a differ­ence." 
We will swear to make that differ­ence in May. At graduation we will receive a ring and take the Obligation of the Engineer, wherein we will avow that our "skill and knowledge shall be given without reservation for the pub-lie good." 
How exactly can we help the com­mon good as professionals? The six people interviewed had the same answer: be a good engineer. Do well, gain respect in the profession, and pursue positions of influence. A solid education will reduce insufficient solutions to complex problems. Here are some other specific ideas for our profession: 
1. 
Starting professionals in any corpo­ration can join boards that work on developmental projects locally or abroad. We can join those boards and push organizations to do more. 

2. 
If we manage our finances and lifestyle well, we can pursue philan­thropy and donate funds to groups needing the financial mobility to do their work. 

3. 
Many undeveloped areas, whether domestically or abroad, need only 


need very basic .engineering solutions we can provide to halt far-reaching problems in areas such as telecom­munications, sewage man­agement, water sup­ply and construe­tion. 
4. No matter 
~~ 
our involve­ments, we can always make space to 
volun­teerour technical 
shllls~ 
local organiza­tions and schools. In 20 years, Notre Dame can graduate over 50,000 people. Each in this group has unique strengths. Engineers in particular 
have a remarkable ability to make a difference in ways no one else can. The world needs our skills. If we put them to use in even the smallest way, we will begin to realize the tremendous power of engineering.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Notre Dame 
supports Bush? 
In an otherwise regrettable article, Jacqueline Cuisinier noted that her conversations with students have convinced her that the NO community largely supports President Bush and will do so in the coming election. 
As someone who spent time at NO, this does not surprise me-nor should it; indeed, ND is known as a rather con­servative school. mainly because it is Catholic. 
Yet this level of support for Bush would be a total surprise to me if alii knew about NO were based on what I read in The Observer. Just look at the recent Viewpoint articles. For every five arguing that Bush is a racist, homophobic. skin­head, Nazi who wants to starve the poor, exterminate the old and eliminate all our freedoms, there are maybe one or 
.two suggesting he might be a somewhat decent human 
being, whose policies might perhaps be understood in a 
more favorable light-sort of. 
These attack pieces come not only from the regular columnists but from others who submit articles. Nor is the bias limited to the opinion pieces. Consider the article on Jan. 21 about professors responding to the State of the Union. Try to find a positive reaction to the speech in that article. The author suggests "varied opinions," but they are varied only in the way in which they see Bush as evil. One sees Bush as a warmonger; another as a totalitarian; anoth­er as a bigot. 
What is the cause of this tone? When I was an undergrad­uate. there was nowhere near this level of ferocity and venom toward President Clinton in campus media-not even close. 
Go ahead and look back through old issuel!. you will see. I recall no opposition to the war in the Balkans, for instance. Nor do I remember much criticism of him for other deci­sions. Yet if you ask students, I guarantee most will tell you they prefer Bush to Clinton. Why is this not reflected in a paper which represents the NO community? 
Joseph Muldoon Alumni '00 Jan. 21 
Despite David Tagler's and Jason Arnoult's valiant efforts, their argu­ments do little to clear away my ambivalence with respect to how Catholics can support the Republican Party. 
By immediately dismissing Ms. Cuisinier's idealism and all of the ideas that come with it as defunct by stating that "Unfortunately, we live in the real world," Mr. Tagler loses his credibility in light ofthe achievements of idealists such as Martin Luther King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi and even the Founding Fathers . 
Furthermore, before he begins making any more course recom­mendations, Mr. Tagler should probably review his notes from whatever political science course he took last semester and acknowl­edge that the realpolitik he espous­es under which, "all nations do what is in their best interest," is only one of many different main­stream currents in international relations theory. 
Other theories suggest that nations cooperate with one anoth­er through international institu­tions and use diplomacy and dis­cussion to resolve their differences instead of relating with one anoth­er solely through brute power or force (although in Mr. Tagler's defense, recent actions by the United States might suggest other­wise). 
Our resident political scientist also affrrrns that "there is no doubt everyone on this campus wants the most comfortable life possible" and 

Defending Carroll Hall 
Emily Pike's response to yesterday's "Question of the Day" was a well-inten­tioned attempt at humor, but it remains a glaring example of the blatant dormism all too common at Notre Dame today. 
For those unfamiliar with the sit­uation, Ms. Pike suggested that Notre Dame should settle with the tribe suing over western campus land by giving it Carroll Hall. There has been no worse idea in the his­tory of the University. 
First and foremost, during our current war on terrorism, Carroll Hall plays a vital role in secur­ing the western front of the University. Without Carroll, invaders from highway 31 could storm campus unchecked by resist­ance until they had already taken the Grotto. Moreover, cars in the 06 lot closest to Carroll are rarely van­dalized, thanks to Carroll's vigilant watch and by virtue of their relative dis­tance from the rest of every­thing. 
For incoming freshmen, Carroll serves as a bastion of hope. Thanks to Carroll's small size, men can hope that they will not find themselves living in the most remote location on campus. For others, Carroll serves as inspiration: how amazing that 100 men can commute back and forth to class tirelessly, day in and day out. For more still, Carroll is an ideal, a goal. All students can dream that, perhaps one day, they too can find the strength, energy, and will to make the trek to the House On The 
Lake. Yes, I agree with Ms. Pike: Carroll would be a most gener­ous settlement gift. No recipi­ent could help but to be impressed with our lake­front property and stun­ning view of the Dome, Basilica and Grotto. Our spacious hall­
ways, vaulted ceil­ings, volleyball court and precious Golden 
Tee ar<;:ade machine say, "We want to settle this lawsuit in a manner that is more than fair and charitable." 
Convenient park­ing lot access and our nearby personal 
helicopter pad cour­tesy of WNDU are just icing on the cake. But 
that's neither here nor there. Emily, I am sure you 
thought your words would float like a butterfly through the minds of those who read 
them. But please understand that for 100 Carroll· Hall Vermin, they sting like a bee.

Well, allow me to cast some doubt into your mind. I know that there are many people here on campus, myself included, who are perfectly willing to make sacrifices, especially small ones, for people in other parts of the world. 
When I learned Coca-Cola was complicit in the murder and tor­ture of union organizers in Colombia, I joined an international boycott of their products. Students here at Notre Dame are actively boycotting Taco Bell for their refusal to meet the very basic demands of their workers and con­demning goods produced in sweat­shops. 
Although these sacrifices are small, they still show that plenty of people here on campus do not "want the most comfortable life possible" ll,it comes at the expense of other human beings. 
Before Mr. Tagler has the audaci­ty to make any more outrageous claims, perhaps he should read a few more books and "look beyond the bubble" of his limited perspec­tive. 
While Catholic doctrine may con­demn socialism, it by no means champions the sort of dogmatic, nco-liberal capitalism Mr. Arnoult seems to advocate in his article. Catholic social teaching supports both workers' rights and environ­mental protections; the Republican Party's record on these is shoddy at best, especially under the Bush 
Administration. 
With respect to the abortion issue. all I can say is that many Republicans may respect the sanc­tity of life while still inside the womb. But once outside, the holi­ness ofthat life is cast aside in favor of priorities more important than education, health care, good food, clean water and basic human rights. 
Not to downplay the benevolence of Bush's AIDS relief package to Africa, but a significant portion of the funds for that proposal were shuflled from existing foreign aid programs so the figures are inflat­ed. Also, if one were to take into the account the amount of damage in terms of lives and property lost in Africa during the 20th Century alone as a result ofthe actions of the United States and its allies, $15 billion is merely a drop in the bucket, but nevertheless an impor­tant start. ,. 
To say the very least. the Republican agenda for the country falls well short of the ideals put for­ward by both the Catholic Church and the United States. Props to Jacqueline Cuisinier for her article -without people who think like her, I would fear even more for the future of the people of this country and for the rest of the world.

Keeping the sanctity of 
 
marr1~ge 
President George W. Bush is clearly against the civil union of homosexuals. President Bush stated in the State of the Union address "our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage." He agrees with the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 which was a response to Hawaii's court ruling which allowed same-sex marriage. 
As a person who is pretty lax concerning restrictions placed on honest citizens, I found Bush's stance on gay marriage ridiculous. Bush argues that gay marriage destroys the sanctity of traditional marriage. 
My question is, then, if one is so upset about the sacredness of marriage being jeopardized, why didn't anyone get offended when Britney had her fling with her high school friend? 
Britney's MARRIAGE was taken as a world-wide joke. KDWB's Morning radio show host Dave Ryan thought it would be funny to send one of his interns and a listen­er to Las Vegas so they could get married on the radio, broadcast to Minnesota at the same chapel as Mrs. Spears, only to later have it annulled much like "not that innocent" Britney. 
Despite the view of marriage as portrayed by modern popular culture, marriage is sacred. If you are con­cerned with preserving the meaning of marriage, don't get upset with gays who love each other as much as any married couple and want the same sacred bond (not to mention economic benefits) that married cou­ples have. 
Instead, take arms against people that truly do make marriage seem like a joke-Britney Spears and mod­ern pop culture.

ALBUM REVIEW 
c 
Jet rediscovers rock and roll 
By REBECCA SAUNDERS 
Scene Music Critic 
All great bands have at one time been inspired by, or at least maintain, a deep respect for either The Rolling Stones or The Beatles. The four mem­bers in the Melbourne-based band Jet grew up on both. The influence is obvi­ous in their music, which succeeds in being not only an album heavy with rock, but an album immersed iri the music that is rock and roll. In the faster and heavier rock songs of the albums, Jet sounds a great deal like The Rolling Stones; it is at times almost 

ALBUM REVIEW

ing to a straightforward rock sound with the aptly titled Rock N Roll. 
On the 15 songs that make up the two Love Is Hell EPs, Adams' sound is barely recognizable. Far from guitar­laden, staunch rock, the EPs are works of soft, sparse, sad songs. Melancholy piano and gentle guitar fill the tracks on each EP, but most striking are the hauntingly beautiful lyrics. 
On Pt. 1, "The Shadowlands" is a song of painful hopelessness with lyrics reminiscent of Bob Dylan's "Just Like a Woman: "With a father on amphetamines I Her mother hides the pearls I Reach out into darkness I And find my little girl." 
Adam's poignant cover of Oasis' "Wonderwall" adds a new dimension to the song with its slowed-down gait that gives new emphasis and agony to the beautiful song. 
"Avalanche" finds Adams in a Jackson Browne state of mind. Piano and tapping drums accompany his words, "I found your photograph in a cardboard box in a magazine I I can't remember you, remember us or anything I I taught you how to feel, but you just feel numb." 
Although a bit more full sounding than Pt. 1, Pt. 2 continues with the same melancholy themes and sounds as its sister EP. 
Opening the disc is "My Blue Manhattan," a song that feels as though it is a dusted off remnant of a 1920s piano bar. Jazzy piano pro­gressions and Adams' interchange of bluesy croons and soft vocals con­tribute a distinctive flavor to this song.

Scene Music Critic 
In an effort to diversify a musical discography, many artists try to transform their sound from one album to the next. Such transitions tend to have limited success and more than often fail miserably. (See Madonna's shift from '80s pop god­dess to her recent attempts at techno and rap ... ) 
With his November release Love is Hell Pt. 1 and the January release of Pt. 2, however, singer/songwriter Ryan Adams has managed the transi­tion gracefully. The former front man of Whiskeytown, Adams has become a notable force in the alt-country genre with albums like Heartbreaker and Gold and, as of late, has been hedg­

difficult not to get up and dance along with the beat. Using instruments like tambourines and harmonicas through­out the album, an older and deeper level of rock and roll is explored. The overall experience of Jet's first album, Get Born, is incredible, one that you makes you want to move with the music and fixates all your attention. 
The name Jet itself was taken from Paul McCartney's "frazzled post­Beatles peak from 1973." Jet has the spark of the early Beatles albums that leaves "girls weak at the knees," but in no way can Jet's album be called "pop." It is a mixing of the world of rock and pop under a scratchy garage 
rock sound and all that comes through is terrif­ic. 
The band itself is composed of four members: two brothers, Nic and Chris Cester, Nic on guitar and vocals and Chris on drums and vocals. Cameron Muncey covers guitar and vocals and Mark Wilson completes the group with his unique bass sound. 
Jet grew up on the greats like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, but when writing Get Born, they were looking farther into music history than those two famous bands·, look­ing instead into the sound that inspired 
them. It worked. Get Born is a terrifically diverse album put together by great musicians making an impressive and memorable sound. 
The band's current single, "Are You Gonna Be My Girl," is everything a great rock song should be. Starting with a tambourine, mixing in a funky bass line, adding in some strong drums, the singer clears his throat, the guitar picks up and then the singer jumps into the unique lyrics: "1, 2, 3 take my hand and come with me because you look so fine and I-really want to make you mine." There is not much more that needs to be said. 
Each song is clearly thought through and Get Born takes the listener on a musical ride that they have not been on before. "Last Chance," "Get What You Need" and "Get Me Outta Here" are similar rock climaxes on the album. Furthermore, Get Born is a great mix of the fast and slow. The softer songs such as "Look What You've Done," "Move On" and "Radio Song" are terrific as well. The music is continually interesting and varied throughout the album. There are a lot of sounds of throat clearing, talking and the like, but none of that technique is overdone at all. The music builds throughout each song and the album as a whole is extremely impressive. 

Jet is unquestionably one of the best new bands this year. With a familiar yet unique sound, it would be hard to believe that any rock and roll fan could do anything but love Get Born.

grounds the song from the dream-like elevation of its lyrics. "Colors inside you head go spinning round I Like a ferris wheel I Exploding and falling to the ground," sings Adams with ghost­ly phantasmagoria. 
The collection of songs on these two EPs gives new depth and credibility to Adams as an artist. It is ironic that they were originally shelved by the record company as "not his best work" in favor of the hard sound of Rock N Roll. Adams has the last laugh, however, proving he can twang, he can rock and, with Love Is Hell, he can mope with the best of them.

No. 19 Mississippi State 79, 

No. 16 Florida 68 
If it's still a secret, it won't be 
for long. Mississippi State is 
good -very good -and its 
star player, Lawrence Roberts, 
is right up there with the best 
in the nation. 
Roberts was as dominating 
as his team, finishing with 21 
points and 14 rebounds to lead 
the 19th-ranked Bulldogs to a 
victory over No. 17-Florida. 
"He's a great, great player," 
Florida coach Billy Donovan 
said. "As good as there is in 
this league, as good as there is 
in the country." 
Roberts, the 6-foot-9 forward 
who transferred from Baylor 
after the scandal there last 
season, recorded his 11th dou­
ble-double of the season and 
helped the Bulldogs (15-1, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) to the most impressive win yet in what is shaping up to be a spe­cial season. 

Their only loss so far was a one-point heartbreaker to Kentucky last Wednesday on a last-second shot. The Bulldogs briefly led that game after trailing by 16 in the second half. 
"We just go out there and play, and know we can com­pete with any team," Roberts said. 
Mississippi State posted its first win in Gainesville since its Final Four season, 1995-96, and handed Florida (11-4, 2-2) its first double-digit loss at home since 1999, the year before the Gators made it to the national finals. 
Anthony Roberson had 20 points to lead the Gators, who trailed by as many as 22 and lost their second straight ­this coming four days after an 86-7 2 loss at Vanderbilt. 
"It was pretty much a frus­trating game from start to fin­ish," Florida forward Matt Walsh said. 
The Gators didn't have any­one who could come close to shutting down Roberts, a two­time all-conference player in the Big 12 who is making a bid to win the same honors in the SEC this year. 
The Bulldogs went ahead by double digits midway through the first half and never saw the lead fall below 10. 
Not counting his handful of thundering dunks, Roberts' signature play came with 7:19 left, when he made a spinning, twisting, underhanded shot off the glass for a 68-50 lead. The shot silenced the crowd. 
On the next possession, Roberson threw a sloppy pass that Timmy Bowers stole in stride for a dunk. It brought a smattering of boos from the fans and sent some of the sell­out crowd toward the exits.

NBA 



Cavs trade Miles to Blazers 
Mcinnis will take over point for James 
A&Sociated Pre55 
CLEVELAND -Darius Miles received another wake-up call: lie got traded to Portland. 
Miles, who was fined by the Cavaliers for oversleeping and skipping a practice earlier this week, was dealt Wednesday to the Trail Blazers for point guard Jeff Mcinnis and cente'r Huben Boumtje-Boumtje. 
Miles has been a disappoint­ment in his 1 1/2 seasons with Cleveland. which acquired him before last season in a deal that sent guard Andre Miller to the Los Angeles Clippers. 
The 22-year-old Miles, who jumped straight from high school to the NBA in 2000, was averaging 8.9 points in 24 
minutes per game. lie has shown breath­taking flashes of skill, but has betHl plagued by in cons is ten ey, and first-year Cleveland coach Paul Silas was reluctant to play him. 
Miles will get a 
fresh start with the disap­pointing Blazers, who might not be done turning over their roster. 
Portland general manager John Nash said the trade had been in the works for about a week. but talks had been on and ofT between the teams for the past year. 
"We knew that Cleveland was interested in a point guard, and we knew they'd been interested in Jeff for sev­eral months," said Nash, who may still trade Hasheed Wallace. 
After playing just eight min­
utes Saturday in Utah in the final game of Cleveland's road trip and with trade rumors .about him circulating, Miles missed practice on Monday, 
saying he had for­

Miles was fined by the Cavs, but the lanky 6­foot-9 swingman played 17 minutes in Monday's win over Seattle. Miles, who will be a free agent after this season, is making $4.1 million in the final year of his contract. 
The Blazers like Miles' ver­satility and think a change of scenery may bring out his

where we have had a hard time doing that. Coming here, he has a new look, where he can start all over. We all see the potential in him." 
Mcinnis, 29, will give Cleveland some depth at point guard and another veteran to surround rookie star LeBron James. 
Mcinnis is averaging 11.9 points and 5.0 assists in 32.5 minutes per game, but had his playing time reduced recently when Derek Anderson returned from the injured list.

Sacramento. 
Bryant hearing will be closed to public 
point guard dur­ing stretches . this season. 
Mcinnis will split time with Kevin Ollie at point, leaving James to play off-guard and small forward. 
"We've asked LeBron to do a heck of a lot," Paxson said. "But for him to be most effec­tive, we don't need him bring­ing the ball up, initiating our offense and having to score points. That's going to take its toll. We needed to get him back to his more natural posi­tion." 
Paxson said the Cavs didn't want to wait until the offsea­son to try and add a point guard. They were afraid if they had waited, they wouldn't have been able to get a player of Mcinnis' quality. 
"We feel he is as good a point guard as we were going to get," said Paxson, who had been interested in signing Mcinnis two years ago as a free agent. 
Mcinnis is making $3.3 mil­lion this season, and Paxson said the guard's contract is partially protected for next season and would be guaran­teed if he's on Cleveland's ros­ter on July 1. 
Boumtje-Boumtje, 25, has been playing less than three minutes per game. He was on the injured list most of last season. 

Case will continue on Friday afternoon 
Associated Press 
DENVER -Courtroom arguments over whether· Kobe Bryant's accuser has given up her medical privacy rights will be closed to the public, the judge ruled Wednesday. 
A hearing is scheduled for Friday to determine whether Bryant's attorneys can prove the 19-year-old woman has given up her privacy rights by talking about her medical condition and treatment with others. 
Judge Terry Ruckriegle said evidence and testimony likely to be presented during the hearing would bring up embarrassing information that would be disseminated around the world due to the intense media interest in the case against the Los Angeles Lakers star.

James will likeIy miss Kings game 
Associated Press 
CLEVELAND -LeBron James shot baskets during practice Wednesday, but coach Paul Silas said the Cavaliers' rookie isn't ready to play and will likely miss his second straight game due to a sprained right ankle. 
"Chances are slim," Silas said when asked if he expects James to be available for organizations including The Associated Press, said his clients had not yet determined whether to file a petition with the state Supreme Court to review the ruling. 
Bryant faces four years to life in prison or 20 years to life on probation if convicted of sexual assault. He has said he had consensual sex with the woman, a former employ­ee of a mountain resort where he stayed June 30. 
Other parts of Friday's hearing are expected to remain open. 
The judge is expected to hear arguments on whether the records of a rape crisis center should remain private. An employee with the center sat in during a police inter­view of the woman. 
The judge also is expected to hear arguments over the defense's role in evidence testing and a report from prosecutors about who ordered or received T-shirts mocking Bryant as a "cheater." 
Cleveland's game against Sacramento on Thursday. "But I wouldn't put it past him." 
James, who sat out Tuesday's win over Seattle, was favoring his right ankle Wednesday. Cleveland's lead­ing scorer has not run on the ankle since injuring it in a game at Utah on Jan. 17. 
James was not available for comment. 
Before Tuesday's game, James said he was going to be cautious with the injury and not come back until it was 100 percent. 
James rolled his ankle when he stepped on the foot of Utah forward Andrei .... Kirilenko late in regulation, but the Cavs won in overtime without him and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, who was ejected for fighting.

Christian Unity 
Hear the words Heed the message 
by Frank Santoni Director, Peer Ministry & Ecumenical Initiatives 
This Sunday, those of us who are Roman Catholic will sit in church and listen to the first few lines from the Gospel of Luke. We'll hear about how Jesus went to the synagogue to read from the Torah and by doing so fulfilled the very words he proclaimed. Those of us who are Lutheran will hear the same story. So will the Methodists. Episcopalians. And Presbyterians, too. And although this week happens to be the one observed worldwide as a Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, what will happen on Sunday is not a choreographed event designed to celebrate that fact. In fact, what will happen this Sunday is nothing out of the ordinary. It happens every Sunday. In the majority ofChristian churches around the world, on most Sundays of the year, Christians of mainline protestailt denominations along with Roman Catholics read 
and hear the same exact texts from the Bible. 
What I did not realize until recently is that it's been that way for more than 20 years thanks to what's known as the Common Lectionary, a series of books containing a cycle of readings from the bible. It was developed after the reforms called for by the Second Vatican Council for use in worship services and adopted by dozens of Protestant denominations as well as the Roman Catholic Church. I find it fascinating to 
imagine most of the world's Christians worshipping in churches of all shapes and sizes, with music both contemporary or ancient, somewhere around the 
world and all of them, at various points through out 
the mass or service, taking in the same words pro­claimed from the Holy scriptures. 
As I reflect on this reality in the light of this week's observation of Christian Unity Week, it becomes clear that, whether we are aware of it or not on a daily basis, most Christians in the world share that which is most fundamental to practicing our faith: the Word of God. As Christians, we believe that God desires to be in relationship with each of us and together as a people. We believe that God communicates that message to us through the Word who took human form in the person ofJesus Christ. So if God has a message for us and the majorio/ of Christians are hearing this message each week from our pews around the globe, then only one question remains: Aie we heeding the message? 
The scripture that serves as the basis of reflection for Christian Unity Week this year is John 14: 23-31. In this reading, Jesus, preparing his disciples for his imminent departure, speaks these familiar words to them, "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you." With those words, Jesus sums up for us his message to us then and now. Was it possible for the disciples who heard Jesus' words to fully grasp the message he was giving to the them-to understand the promise he 
Prayer for Christian Unity 
0 God, holy and eternal Trinity, we pray for your Church in the world. Sanctify its life; renew its worship; 
empower its witness; heal its. divisions; make visible its unity. Lead us, with all our brothers and sisters, toward communion in faith, life and witness so that, united in one body by the ONE Spirit, we may together witness to the perfect unity of your love. Amen 
The Prayer of the Fifth World Conference on Faith and Order World Council of Churches 
made them and act on it? Maybe even more important to our world now, Jesus delivers that same message to his disciples today. But like his followers then, are we only able to hear the words without heeding the message? Is the Christian Church living like a people promised the gift of peace by God? 
Peace is a prerequisite to the work of unity. The issues debated today by Christian scholars working toward unity are important ones that require continued dialogue and study. The list of joint statements issued by churches from around Christendom declaring agreement on wide-ranging topics is long and detailed. But ~that's where we are today. It's certainly not where we started. The causes of disunion in the Church most often trace back to conflicts having little to do with theology. Many of the original divisions in the Christian Church have more to do with politics and power than with practices in the pews. 
So where does that leave us? Back at the beginning, with the gift of peace Jesus made to his disciples. The peace Jesus promises doesn't only have to do with an end to war, although we certainly need that. The peace Jesus gives us is a peace that comes from broken hearts healed, from families preserved and from people of faith united. Unity and the peace that fosters it is ours to accept. God has spoken his word. God's message is clear. What remains uncertain is our commitment to reach out and receive the gift. In the first verses ofJohn 14:23-31, Jesus tells the disciples, ""Those who love me will keep my word, and my Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them. Whoever does not love me does not keep my words; and the word that you hear is ·not mine, but is from the Father who sent me." Do we hear the words? Do we heed the message?

Associated Press 
IRVING, Texas -Sean Payton is staying with the Dallas Cowboys, making him the second high-rank­ing assistant to remain with the team after look­ing into a head-coaching job elsewhere. 
The Cowboys said on their Web site Wednesday that Payton has decided to stay with the team rather than become coach of the Oakland Raiders. In California, Raiders owner AI Davis said the job was never offered, despite widespread reports Tuesday that Payton had agreed to a deal. 
"I don't think Sean Payton turned down the job because Sean Payton was never offered the job," Davis said in a rare inter­view. "Sean Payton has a lot of good credentials, but I don't know if that's the direction we're going." 
Regardless, it means Bill Parcf)lls will retain a key member of his offensive coaching staff. He'd already gotten defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer to stay after he received more money and added years to remain in Dallas rather than continue pur­suing the coaching job at the University of Nebraska. 
It wasn't immediately known whether Payton, Parcells' assistant head coach and quarterbacks coach, received a raise or an extension. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was traveling back from the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala., and did not immedi­ately return a telephone message. 
Payton and Cowboys offensive coordinator Maurice Carthon were among the candidates to replace fired Raiders coach Bill Callahan, who eventually took the Nebraska job. Payton was the first person invited back to Oakland for a sec-
IN BRIEF 
Diamondbacks' Orosco retires after 24 seasons Jesse Orosco had enough. 
After a record-setting career, the 46-year-old left-hander told the Arizona Diamondbacks on Wednesday that he had decided to retire after 24 major league sea­sons. 
"To take it a quarter-century -I never imagined that," Orosco said during a telephone interview with The Associated Press. "It's a sad day that I have to call it quits. But it's a great day, too, for the fact I fulfilled my dream." 
Orosco, who turns 4 7 on April 21, was the oldest player in the major leagues last season. He began his career with the New York Mets in 1979 -some current major lea­guers weren't even born yet-and set big league records with 1,252 games pitched and 1,248 relief appearances.

"My serve felt great today," said the top-seeded Roddick, who led the tour in aces last season. "So obvi­ously I didn't use so many of the kicks, too many of the slices, because I felt like I was hitting my big one very well." 
He won 93 percent of points on his

Dent, who compiled 83 winners and 77 unforced errors, screamed "Yeah!" when Chela's backhand vol­ley hit the net on match point.

Kim Carpenter of the women's soccer team, Devon Prescod and Greg Martin of the men's soccer team, Aaron Gill and Bob Globke of the hockey team, Bob Morton of the football team, Kristin Kinder of the volleyball team and Liz Doyle of the cheer­leading squad participated in the event, which Vater hopes will become an annual tradi­tion. The athletes answered questions about becoming involved in their sports, choos­ing to attend Notre Dame, their activities outside of ath­letics and their plans for the future. They also discussed applying the lessons learned on the field to situations in everyday life. 
"You get a chance to go to Notre Dame, it's an opportuni­ty you can't pass up," Martin said. "Getting to put on an Irish jersey is just another aspect of it." 
"I've been a Notre Dame fan in general and in football since I was about four years old," Morton said. "I For seniors like Marti-n, the 

Notre Dame experience is 
almost over and some senior 
captains are unsure of what 
they will do after graduation. 
"It's a tough decision," 
Martin said when asked about 
future plans. Martin and 
Prescod are considering trav­
eling to Africa to play soccer 
and work as AIDS/HIV educa­
tors. They hope to "find a way 
to stay active and stay 
involved in the community," 
said Martin. 
Carpenter plans to attend 
medical school -her lifelong 
goal-after graduation. 
''I'll. be taking a lot from my experience here," she said. "You can't let individual desires get in the way when you've got a team to look out for -the same is true in med­icine." 
Kinder said that the most important goal of a captain is "to get the most out of every individual on a team." She said she is considering playing professional beach volleyball and is looking into making an Olympic appearance, but hopes to go into the field of public health. 
Each athlete had a memory of beginning what would be a lifelong passion -why he or

"We saw it as the opportuni­

teammate Globke said. Globke 
was selected in the second 
round of the draft, and the 
team is ranked in the nation's 
top 15. 
The captains have proven themselves to be leaders out­side of athletics as well. 
"Our captains are responsi­ble for the creative aspect of cheerleading -our practices are run by the creative minds behind the team," Doyle said. 
The cheerleaders also schedule appearances in Catholic grade schools, chil­dren's hospitals and day-care centers to coincide with road trips. 
Others, such as Martin, said that being a recognizable face in the South Bend community has led to opportunities to help a variety of people. 
"My  old  man  
put  me  on  
skates,"  said  

Globke, who initially disliked skating and the cold weather. "But I kind of started to like it and with four little brothers, I had fun shooting pucks at them." 
Kinder had the unique expe­rience of co-captaining the volleyball team with her twin sister. 
"Debbie [Brown], our coach, is a big name in [our home state ofl California," Kinder said. "She played there, her jerseys are retired ... having the opportunity to play with her and my sister was amaz­ing." 
Prescod, Martin and Carpenter were able to share simnar stories about learning to play soccer, with Prescod and Carpenter following ­and excelling -in the foot­steps of older siblings.

True, the Irish currently only sit in seventh-place in the CCHA, with 18 points in 16 games. Their 8-6-2 conference record and 12-7-3 records overall are good, yet not great. But despite what looks like mediocrity, the Irish have been anything but. 
Quick, name three members of the Notre Dame hockey team. Can't do it? Well, don't worry, fans in Chestnut Hill, Mass., Orono, Maine and Madison, Wise. probably couldn't either. 
They should be able to now, though, as the Irish have already beaten hockey power­houses Boston College, Maine and Wisconsin this season. Each team was ranked in the top five at the time, and each win came on the road, with two of those three wins ending in shutouts. 
Not bad for a team that wasn't even picked to finish in the top six in their conference's preseason poll. 
Despite playing in the Joyce Center. an arena better suited to host Senior Citizens' Bingo Night than a hockey game, the Irish have quietly crept up on the rest of the CCHA elite over the past few years. 
Notre Dame has advanced to the Super Six three of the past four years. twice beating high­er-ranked opponents on the road in the first round to do so. True, the Irish have never won a game at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit during the CCHA Championships, but they have still made the rest of the con­ference take notice that they are no longer a pushover.

Michigan and Michigan State for recruits, the Irish have con­tinued to put together competi­tive squads year after year. and this year hit paydirt with one of their best freshman classes ever. 
Goaltender David Brown and defenseman Wes O'Neill are both listed among the top three collegians at their position in the NHL Central Scouting List for the 2004 NHL Draft. And a whole slew of freshman for­wards -Michael Bartlett, Jason Paige and Josh Sciba among them -have come through with pivotal goals at pivotal times for the Irish this year. 
Despite a tradition of goal­tending mediocrity (the school's record holder in save percent­age is an anemic .888), Notre Dame has put together one of the best tandems in the coun­try, which is a big reason for their great start this year. 
Brown and junior Morgan Cey are each in the top three overall for both save percent­age and goals against average in the CCHA, and Brown is tied for the lead in shutouts with four. Brown and Cey continue to compete with each other for starts, and that can only be a good thing for the Irish down the stretch. 
No matter what happens the rest of the season. the Irish have made believers out of col­lege hockey fans nationwide, from Massachusetts to Florida (where the Irish beat then-No. 3 Maine in a Christmas tourna­ment). No longer can teams simply schedule Notre Dame in hopes of getting an easy win. 
Despite all the odds this sea­son, the Irish time and time again have shown they can win over all.

Celebrities born on this day: Steve Perry, Linda Blair, John Hurt, Bill Bixby, Sam Cooke, Olivia D'Abo, Diane Lane, Graham Kerr, Piper Laurie 
Happy Birthday: Don't let your emotional life interfere with your professional advancement this year. If you really want to get ahead, you're going to have to focus on your work. Letting frustrations stand in your way will be detrimental to your advancement. You must deal with issues quickly in order to spare yourself long drawn-out setbacks. This is not the year to vacillate. Your numbers: 6, II, 24, 35, 39, 40 
ARIES (March 21-April19): You will be unpredictable today. Try to stick to yourself so as to avoid confrontations with others. Losses will be likely if you are too eager to risk your hard-earned cash. *** TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Deception is likely. Don't let someone who wants to make you look bad bait you. Stay calm and don't overindulge. Socialize with friends, not co-workers. *** GEMINI (M3y 21-June 20): Unusual circumstances will arise if you are taking care of other people's affairs. Read the fine print before making decisions. Difficulties will result if you have more than one love interest. **** CANCER (June 21-July 22): You may be taken for granted if you are too willing to give of your own time. Do not take on proble~;~~s that don't concern you. Lending money to friends or relatives will result in ill feelings. ** LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Pleasure trips will be better than expected. You can meet exciting individuals who spark a major interest.

Coach Tyrone Willingham and his staff have received verbal commitments from ten recruits thus far. At 2:45 p.m. today, Willingham will find out if Walker has become the eleventh. 
The high school senior from Lawrenceville, Ga. will announce his decision this afternoon from Buford High School in his home state. 
Walker, who stands at 5­foot-11, 195 pounds, rushed for 1,986 yards and 26 touch­downs· as the feature running back for the state champion Buford Wolves. 
He has already taken visits to Stanford (Jan. 9), Ohio State (Jan. 16) and Alabama (Jan. 19). Walker has also sched­uled a visit to Notre Dame for Jan. 23 and Arkansas for Jan.

Bringing together talented athletes and interested ·stu­dents, O'Neill Family Hall invited the captains of Notre Dame athletic teams to speak with students and hall resi­dents for the first annual "Night of Captains." 
Drawing inspiration from a TV show where former lead­ers in fields like politics and business as well as sports were interviewed, hall presi­dents Michael Vater and Ruben Pena organized an event where students could learn more about the life of a student-athlete. 
"We wanted to showcase the captains and [illustrate] that they don't just play sports," said Vater, "but do stuff out­side, in the community."
