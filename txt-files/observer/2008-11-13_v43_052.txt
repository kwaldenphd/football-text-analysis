BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 
IT officer answers tech questions 
Members voice concerns about wireless Internet, campus printing 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY 
News Writer 
Chief Information Officer Janice Thomasson discussed new innovations in Information Technology on Saint Mary's campus during the Board of Governance (BOG) meeting Wednesday. 
Thomasson took questions from board members about students technology concerns on campus, ranging from wireless Internet to the absence of printers in various residence and academic buildings. 
Thomasson referred to the Information Technology 
Strategic Blueprint for Saint Mary's College, which is avail­able on the Saint Mary's stu­dent Web site. This plan lays out upcoming advancements that will take place at the College in the next few years. 
Thomasson described the plan as "the road we plan to take at Saint Mary's to help you have a better student experience through the year 2012." 
One of the major concerns from board members was the availability of wireless Internet in Le Mans and Holy Cross residence halls. They are the last remaining build­ings without this service. 
The reason the process can­not be sped up is due in large part to funding, Thomasson said. 
"It's Holy Cross especially; very historic, very old, with very thick walls which I have to drill through, and that costs much more money. So, it's all about money," Thomasson said. 
Shauna Morris, the board's athletic commissioner, said residents of Opus Hall, the senior apartments on cam­pus, have been having trouble with their wireless connec­tion. Thomasson said the problems are due to the new­ness of the wireless technolo­

Wireless system changes 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 

The wireless Internet net­work at Notre Dame is chang­ing from NOMAD to a new sys­tem called NO-secure, a switch the Office of Information Technology (OIT) said will make the network more secure. 
"The NOMAD wireless net­work has served us well, but we've been striving to bring Notre Dame's network in line with wireless industry's best practices and move to a secure wireless network," OIT security professional Mike Chapple said. 
Notre Dame launched the NOMAD network in 2002, Chapple said. The main reason for the switch is to improve security, he said. 
"[NO-secure] uses a secure login process so the informa­tion you send is protected from eavesdropping by other wire­less network users," he said. 
The new network has encryp­tion technology that NOMAD lacked. 
"When you switch to the new network, you can rest assured that other users of the wireless network cannot eavesdrop on your communications. Unencrypted networks, such as NOMAD, do not offer the same capability," Chapple said. "The encryption technology used on NO-secure is similar to that used by secure Web sites." 

Under the new system, Chapple said NO-secure is available across campus in the same places as NOMAD, and WiFi coverage on campus will

Saturday's dnbacln at Boston College,

As disheartening as thn last two loss­
es have been, Wnis is still my-our­
man. As athletic director Jack 

Swnrbrick said ynsterday, he has the 
program moving in the right direction. 
But thn Chicago Sun-Times and ESPN 
rnports that Wnis was "officially" on the 
hot seat were probably prnmature. 
Unofficially though, in the court of' ran opinion, he's be1~n on it since last ynar's disastnr. Thn 3-9 season wasn't entirely his fault. and neither is this year's 5-4 record that marks both improvement and disappointment. 
But is the war in Iraq all (;eorge

Al'tnr the loss to Pitt, Weis altered the practice sdwdule. After tho loss to BC, he's taken over the offensive play-call­ing duties (a situation complicated by a death in Mike Haywood's family-my condolnncns, by the way). 
When Wnis runs out of ehanges, Swarbrick and othnrs might have to start making some. And that usually starts at thn top. 
It won't happnn this week, probably not this year. and chances arc, not even af'ter nnxt year unless the team takes a major dive-which no one wants to see. 
Alumni can eomplain to Fr. .Jenkins and withhold their ticket donations, but until one of them comes up with the x­million dollars it would take to buy out Weis' contract. it'll all be moot. 
That being said, it's dear Weis needs to step it up-at least, he needs his team to step up for him. 
Notre Dame needs to find some moti­vation-to save their coach's job, to qualify for a bowl game, to avoid another embarrassing loss, to shut up whiney alumni-to turn things around. 
Frankly, I don't think anyone cares how the team does it-we just want wins. 
Without them, the Notre Dame foot­ball program might be !crt looking for a leadnr that can instill a belief. validat­ed or not, that "Yes, we can!"

Pastor issues 7-day sex challenge for married couples 
DALLAS -The pastor of a mega­church says he will challenge married congregants during his sermon Sunday to have sex for seven straight days ­and he plans to practice what he preach­es. 
"We're going to give it a try," said the Hev. Ed Young, who has four children with his wife of 26 years. 
Young, 4 7, said he believes society pro­motes promiscuity and he wants to

SOUTH BEND. Ind. -The South Bend Tribune is reducing its staff by nearly 14 per­cent this year, cutting 56 positions through retirements, voluntary and involuntary sev­erance packages and by leaving some open positions unfilled. 
David Hay, editor and publisher of the newspaper, says the Tribune decided to offer the severance packages to some employees after other cost-cutting efTorts failed to keep pacfl with the economic downturn.

Obama sparks political diversity 
Landmark U.S. presidential election brings hope to European nations 
Associated Press 
PARIS -An Obama effect is rippling across Europe. 
In France, a pro-Barack Obama grassroots group created months ago is morphing into a campaign for political diversity. In Britain, a black voter group says it is inundated with calls and attendance is soaring. 
In Austria, a Rwandan­born activist has fired off letters to big parties urg­ing them to field minority candidates.' And in Germany, the staff of Turkish politician Cern Ozdemir started a Facebook group called "Yes we Cern" -a takeoff on Obama's slogan. "Yes we can." 
Obama's victory is inspiring hopes and even planting the seeds of action for changing the overwhelming whiteness of Europe's political elite. But it's unclear whether these efforts will pay off or merely fizzle. Although polls showed majorities in nearly every European country favored Obama over John McCain, many say Europe is far from voting for a leader from an ethnic minority itself. 

Of course, the victory of son, the Interior Ministry "The vote for Obama end on France's lack of the son of a black man in Germany says "foreign­rings as a critique of poli­political diversity. from Kenya and a white ers" made up about 8.2 tics in France as sclerotic, Spokesperson Azedine woman from Kansas has percent of the population old and tired -and not Haffar said France's brought hope to many in 2006.

Legacy of Klan remains in town 
Associated Press 
OGALUSA, La. -Hattie Dillon got a first-hand taste of the racial hatred that gripped this city in the 1960s when a metal bolt flung by someone in an angry crowd gashed her head as she marched for civil rights. 
On Wednesday, sitting on her front porch just off Main Street, the 61­year-old who is black said Bogalusa is better now. But the bloody legacy of racial violence and brazen Ku Klux Klan activity in the area remains ­evidenced by the arrest of eight local people in the death of an Oklahoma woman shot when a weekend Klan initiation went awry. 

"History was made this month," Dillon said, referring to Barack Obama's election as the nation's first black president. "Then our eyes opened again." 
Sunday's killing was in St. Tammany Parish, just across the Washington Parish line and all the suspects are from Washington Parish, which more than 40 years earlier was beset by anti-desegregation vio­lence. In 1965, Oneal Moore, the parish's first black sheriff's deputy, was slain in an ambush, a crime that has not been solved. 
"In 1965, the Klan ran Bogalusa, and so it's not at all surprising to see the legacy of that organization re­emerge in the form of a new generac tion of Klan advocates," said Lance Hill, executive director of Tulane University's Southern Institute for Education and Research. 
In this week's shooting, St. Tammany Sheriff Jack Strain said Cynthia C. Lynch, 43, of Tulsa, Okla., was recruited over the Internet to participate in the KKK ritual in a rural area and then was to return to her state to attract members. Strain said the group's leader, Raymond "Chuck" Foster, 44. shot and killed her after a fight broke out when she asked to be taken back to the town of Slidell.

Drununer for Hendrix found dead 
Mitch Mitchell, last surviving member ofthe group, dies at 61 in hotel room 
Associated Press 
PORTLAND, Ore. -Mitch Mitchell, drummer for the legendary Jimi Hendrix Experience of the 1960s and the group's last surviving member, was found dead in his hotel room early Wednesday. He was 61. 

Mitchell was a powerful force on the Hendrix band's 1967 debut album "Are You Experienced?" as well as the trio's albums "Electric Ladyland" and "Axis: Bold As Love." He had an explo­sive drumming style that can be heard in hard-charging songs such as "Fire" and "Manic Depression." The Englishman had been drum­ming for the Experience Hendrix Tour, which per­formed friday in Portland. It was the last stop on the West Coast part of the tour. 
Hendrix died in 1970. Bass player Noel Hedding died in 2003. 

An employee at Portland's Benson Hotel called police after discovering Mitchell's body.

AUSTIN, Texas -The University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, a teach­ing hospital severely damaged by Hurricane Ike, will lay off about 3,800 workers -nearly a third of its work force ­because it is running out of money.

Dems seek help for auto industry 
WASHINGTON -Congressional Democrats are pushing legislation to send $25 billion in emergency loans to the beleaguered auto industry in exchange for a government owner­ship stake in the Big Three car companies. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Harry Heid, D-Nev., hope for quick passage of the auto bailout during a postelection session that begins Monday. 
Legislation being drafted by Rep. Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, and Sen. Carl M. Levin, 0-Mich., would dip into the $700 billion Wall Street rescue money, approved by Congress last month, for the auto aid. 
President Bush is cool to that idea. But the White House says he is open to helping the industry, which is buckling under poor sales, tight credit and a sputtering economy. 
In an Oval Office meeting Monday, President-elect Obama spoke to Bush about doing more to aid the industry, aides said, and Bush said he was open to it. 
Any efl'ort to throw the companies a lifeline could run into GOP roadblocks that could derail it in the Senate. In that chamber, Hepublicans, including some who believe their votes for the Wall Street bailout hurt, and in some cases doomed, their re-electinn bids, are loath to agree to any new money. 
Stock market continues to fall 
NEW YORK -A disheartened Wall Street fell for the third straight session Wednesday as investors absorbed another series of dismal corporate reports and news that the govern­ment won't buy banks' soured mortgage assets after all. The Dow Jones industrials dropped more than 410 points to 8,282.66, and all the major indexes lost more than 4 percent. 
The stock market has lost about $1 trillion over the past three days, according to the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 index, which reflects the value of nearly all U.S. stocks.

Financial rescue plan to change 
Bush administration focuses on bank stock instead of buying troubled assets 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Bush administration is embracing an old adage when it comes to its finan­cial rescue plan: Try, try again. 
Urgently shifting course, the administration revamped its $700 billion bailout package by jetti­soning the idea of purchas­ing banks' distressed assets -the centerpiece of the original plan -and announcing Wednesday that it will search for new ways to shore up not only banks but credit-card, auto-loan and other huge nonbank businesses. 
Democrats, meanwhile, are pressing hard to include billions of dollars in help for faltering automakers-over admin­istration objections. 
Unimpressed by any of the overhaul talk, Wall Street dove ever lower.

As of 11 p.m. Nov. 4, Barack Obama was elected to succeed George W. Bush as the forty-fourth president of the United States. A lot of voters across the country -more than in any other elec-· 
tion in history­voted for him. A lot of folks donated time, money, and effort to bring Obama to this point, all for differ­ent reasons, but 

overwhelmingly Jason Coleman because they felt that our country should try heading Man at Large in a new direction. This too was apparent in congressional races, where Democrats picked up seats in both the House and Senate. 
However, Obama himself, put it best in his acceptance speech: "This victory alone is not the change we seek-it is only the,chance for us to make that change. 
What is the change we seek? Or bet­ter yet, what must this new majority achieve in the coming months to vindi­cate the voters of their doubts and inse­curities? Practically speaking, there are three main issues that seem to rise above the rest. 
First, of course, is the economy. Democrats were voted into office (as they were in '92) because the economy wasn't looking good. A new tax plan would probably pass quickly and is nec­essary to spurring growth again. It will involve cuts acros·s various income groups, in hopes of increasing spending again. The details will be controversial and passing something quickly will be diflicult, but not insurmountable. 
Second, some sort of energy policy needs to be put into place. We already import far too much oil, and if there is any sort of price shock while in reces­sion, things could get even more ugly. 
Supporting a seriously alternative ener­gy infrastructure will be expensive, but now is the time to do it. Spending is necessary to boost the economy, and infrastructure spending of this type would be killing two birds with one stone. While the debt will have to be dealt with eventually, the time is not now. 
Finally, a definitive plan needs to be set for Iraq. Whether or not it calls for immediate troop withdrawal, or simply lays out goals that need to be met before withdrawaljs possible, the increasingly dissident public deserves to have some idea of how and when it will end. We also need to be briefed on why Afghanistan is so important, and what the issues with Iran are. 
Luckily, Obama has some tools at his disposal that should ease the process. 
First, he has the attention of the rest of the world. The goodwill that has been generated, if harnessed, could turn into an effective alliance working over a swath of issues. Because our financial problems have become everybody's financial problems, everyone will have to plan together to find a solution. Fortunately, Bush has already called for a conference of global leaders and eco­nomic advisers to begin work. Obama's stamp will only strengthen the legitima­cy and force of such a gathering. Furthermore, it will take an internation­al force to figure out how to ease rising tensions with Iran. An Iran with nuclear weapons, again, is everybody's problem. 
The second tool Obama has is his massive e-mail of supporters. Allegedly, the number of entrants tops 10 million. With the touch of a button, Obama has the ability to inform millions directly of his plans and present his arguments. He will be able to drum up an army of activists lobbying their congressman for action. 
Finally, he has come to power in a time of big problems, and was elected on the platform of big solutions. This is a big opportunity, and his supporters, the majority, have said they want to think bigger. While public opinion is dif­ficult to forecast, I sense that people will be okay with a misstep or two, as long as it is acknowledged and a plan is pre­sented to stay the course. Naturally, there will be those that are ready to pounce at first blood, but I'm not sure those are the ones that drive public sen­timent efiectively anymore. 

Unfortunately, this last tool, the enor­mity of the problems, is also the great­est liability. We arc attempting to wage war on two fronts: our ec<momy has fallen ofT of a elifi, and we can't stop buying oil drawn from countries that are not particularly friendly. It would be difficult for a government built on checks and balances to tackle one of these issues, much less all at the same time. 
The people gave the Democrats a majority, and with it, a mandate to do better than we have bnen doing. This much is dear. Leaders of the world have endorsed Obama and elaimed that they will support him going forward. That is good. 
But it is of the utmost importance that the new majority remembers exactly what it was elected to do. Karl Hove infamously claimed that the Hepublican sweep in 2004 was a new enduring con­servative majority. It lasted just two years, namely because the GOP forgot what it had been elected to do. Hopefully, the Democrats in the !louse and on the Hill wont' forget and seize this great opportunity with humility and purpose.

A worthy investment, and well worth the risks 
Raise your hand if you've ever scratched your head over that some­what mysterious parable of the master who entrusted his money to three of his servants. The first two invested theirs and doubled their 
amounts; the third Kate Barrett buried his in the 
backyard and had to 'fess up upon Faithpoint the master's return. The trickiest part for me was always when the master, furious, heat­
edly lectures the third servant, takes his money back, and cries, "To every­one to has, more will be given and he will grow rich; but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away." I remember that as a kid, I con­sidered this principle a horrible idea: What? Give even more to those who already have? Take away from those who don't? 
I've been thinking about this Gospel, which comes from Matthew, chapter 25 (take a look at Matthew 25 -it's not for the faint of heart), because it's this Sunday's gospel. We're in the last two weeks of the Church year, before Advent starts, and the readings in these coming weeks will reflect this in their close focus on the end-times. The mas­ter, in Jesus' parable, doesn't find the third servant's behavior merely disap­pointing, but seriously reprehensible. He takes away the money, but he really means to highlight the magnitude of the servant's mistake: The servant disre­garded the gift, and then if that weren't enough, tried to pin the blame for his lousy decision on the master. 
Here's a cool fact that helps make sense of the master's cryptic tirade against the third servant. The Greek term "talent" describes the weight of the sums of money the master gave the three servants. This parable is the source of the English use of "talent," meaning a gift that can be improved upon with practice. Even as far back as the origins of the English language, people of faith must have understood that Jesus' parable of the three ser­vants didn't literally refer to money, but to the manner in which a person accepts a gift. Those who are properly open to receiving a gift -that is, a freely bestowed offering from God ­will have the faith and trust to find ways to share and spread that gift and so to make it grow, even though it might mean taking a risk. Those who "have not" the open hearts to receive and appreciate such an offering will find that they lose even any limited ability to act out of faithful belief in God's love. 
Coincidentally -I love when this happens -I attended a meeting Tuesday night for parents of second graders who will make their first recon­ciliation in a few weeks, and it remind­ed me of this gospel yet again. We dis­cussed the logistical aspects of our chil­dren's first confession, how we can help them articulate the sinfulness they need to address (second grade sins are rela­tively unimpressive, but believe me, they understand "doing something wrong on purpose"), and how we can help prepare them to understand and welcome God's forgiveness. 
And there, right on the sheet entitled "Examination of Conscience," one of the questions read, "Do I use the gifts God has given me for the good of others?" Well, there's that third servant again! He didn't use his gifts, and it's a sin! The master trusted him with a valuable asset, and out of fear, or laziness, or lack of imagination, or plain old disin­terest, he hid it away where he could ignore it ... until he was forced to face the master and explain himself. 

Imagine how our lives might change if we take seriously our responsibility to receive well the gifts God has given us; that is, if we look at all we have as a gift from God, and then figure out how, practically and regularly, to give it away. And it's a relatively easy task for us. For the people at the time of Matthew's gospel, attempting to spread the gift of the good news about Christianity meant risking stuff like, well, death. 
When you hear this gospel on Sunday, remember that the master -God ­tells us that only by accepting and using our gifts will they grow. Take some risks with your faith, your time, your skills; your attention to others. Wouldn't God rather that we at least take a chance, even if we fail, than bury our talents in the backyard?

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
The not-so elusive Mandate 
First off, full disclosure: Christie Pesavento is a friend of mine. That being said, I'm glad we have never sat down together for a good, long discussion on politics. Her latest Viewpoint column, "The elusive mandate", trots out all the tired conservative talking points this side of Rush Limbaugh. I cannot take her opinion seriously when she starts out by claiming that the principles of the Democratic Party are "bigger govern­ment, spineless foreign policy and increased spending on ineffective social programs". After the past 8 years of Republican futility, in which George W. Bush's administration ran up trillions of dollars towards the national debt, it is impressive that Christie can call the Democrats the party of bigger govern­ment without a hint of irony. This trope that Democrats are weak on foreign poli­cy is the stuff that Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich sustain their political liveli­hoods off of, but it has no basis in reali­ty. Barack Obama and the Democrats are advocating a smarter foreign policy. How can the world take America seriously if we just spew vitriol to our enemies and threaten to rain bombs on those who disagree with us? Somewhere along the line we lost the notion of diplomacy from our national discourse, and hopefully the Obama administration can deal with the international community in a strategic and reasoned way, not one which drives us into unnecessary war and threatens to completely de-stabilize our economy. Ineffective social programs? One of the biggest messes right now is lame-duck President Bush's No Child Left Behind Act. While noble in intent, its level of execution and planning has rendered NCLB not only ineffective but harmful to the American educational system, with its overemphasis on standardized testing driving teachers and middle class stu­dents out of American public schools. 
I agree with Pesavento's claim that "all any Democratic nominee had to do was avoid any fatal missteps and the election would be gift-wrapped and delivered directly into his or her hands." The Hepublican Party has proven over the past eight years that it is reactionary, small-minded, and harmful for the well­being of the American people. Why is there "widespread resentment towards the previous administration"? Because President Bush and his policies were bad for America, and the electorate decided not to vote in another candidate who shared the previous administration's failed beliefs in government. 
As for her thoughts on President-Elect Obama and his campaign, I can only say this: he was voted into office with an overwhelming majority of electoral votes. Say what you will about our "mes­sianic leader" but in spite of your claims to the contrary, the truth remains that Americans clearly are on the same page with Obama when it comes to governing philosophy. Not only was Obama elected in by a wide margin, but the American people also voted in a largely Democratic Congress to help enact his policies and the policies of the Democratic Party. America is seeking a change in direction and by a vast margin shunning the Republican Party while embracing the principles of the Democrats. Yet it seems that Pesavento is asking us to believe her and the foundering conservative movement over our own lying ballots. 
If there is one thing that Pesavento is absolutely right about, it is that history has not been kind to presidents who overstep their authority. One can only imagine how future scholars will evalu­ate the presidency of George W. Bush, though our tangled foreign policy engagements and collapsing economy can give us just a taste of how harshly his administration will be judged. But unlike Bush, who was only brought into office by a Supreme Court decision after an almost evenly-split election, President-Elect Obama has been given the keys to drive the American state on the road back to prosperity by a wide majority of the electorate. Pesavento, I wish you and your conservative ilk would quit telling the American people that we really did not mean what we voted for when we elected Barack Obama to the Executive Branch. It is clear that America does want Obama and the Democrats to implement their agenda, and by a large margin has granted them the authority to do so.

Sitnple and hilarious 
In response to Robert Scully's "Offensive Comics Are Back" I think it is time for you to chill. David 'The Firestarter" Cavadini was simply referring to the fact that everyone loves Brady Quinn. As a senior, if you are honestly offended by the word erection, too much to show your love for Brady, then I apologize to you for you lack of sense of humor. As for the artistic design of the comic, the fact that David uses simple designs, with simple mes­sages is just down right hilarious. To treat David with such disrespect is the true shame in your ordeal. Just as Picasso was not considered a genius during his lifetime, David might not be either. But time will tell if Mr. Cavadini is still a legend after his short time here at Notre Dame.

Som_e Wom_en Like 'Die Hard' 
Some Women Like "Die Hard" Now that I have your attention, I greatly appreciated Andrew Miller's article "Engendering con­flict," not only because I'm a "die­hard" musical lover, but also for his point on why it's not too far off for men to like musicals ... or are too afraid to admit it. 
On the flip side, there are some women, including myself, who like the so-called "guy movies." As a woman, it may sound crazy, but I would pick a really good action film over a bad chick flick any day. To illustrate my point, I went to see Kill Bill Vol. 2 with 6 guys (since no girl I knew wanted to see it), I get giddy when a new James Bond film comes out, and I find Die Hard rather fun and enjoyable! Seriously, Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Reginald Vel Johnson 
a.k.a. Carl Winslow ... you can't go wrong! Granted, I was an FTT major at ND, but still. 
Nevertheless, musicals are my passion. If guys are still a bit hesi­tant to take a leap of faith and enjoy musicals, here's some info that may ease the process. First, before "300," Gerald Butler played the Phantom in the film version of "The Phantom of the Opera." Before he ever said the catch-line, "This is Sparta," he was singing the famous "Music of the Night." Second, while we all loved Eddie Murphy in the Beverly Hills Cop films and on SNL, you can't deny that one of his best moments was his role in "Dreamgirls." Third, Hugh Jackman. Yes, we all know him as Wolverine, but did you know he also won a Tony award for his performance in "The Boy from Oz," a musical? Heck, even Marlon Brando starred in "Guys and Dolls!" And if you think foot­ball and any other sport involves athleticism, just watch the dancing numbers in "Singin' in the Rain," specifically "Make 'Em Laugh," "Moses Supposes," and that little number in which Gene Kelly sings and dances in the rain. Better yet, just watch any musical with Gene Kelly, who brought athletics to musicals. If guys can watch Stewie Griffin dance with him, maybe it 

won't be so difficult. 
So, if I can admit to my liking of "Goldeneye," "300" and the Die Hard series over "The Notebook," "27 Dresses" and "Made of Honor," then maybe guys should "man up" and give musicals a shot.

This Friday and Saturday, Notre Dame's various A<>ian cultural organizations are com­ing together for the latest annual Asian Allure. Primarily sponsored by the Asian-American A'>SOCiation, A<>ian Allure is a chance for cam­pus's A<>ian community to showcase a wide variety of talent<> and performances. Past acts have included traditional Hawaiian dancing, Korean Fan Dancing, fashion shows and more. Fifth-year Architecture student Thien­An Nguyen-Vu, the Executive Producer of Asian Allure 2008, recently had the chance to speak to the Observer via e-mail about this year's production. 
Scene: What i<> your role in thi<> year's pro­duction? I low have you been involved in Asian Allure in past years? 
Nguyen-vu: I am currently the Executive Producer and Co-Chair for Asian Allure 2008. I'm a fifth-year architecture student and this happens to be my fourth A<>ian Allure. I was actually in the show my freshmen year and did tech work my sophomore and fourth years. 
Scene: I [ow long has A<>ian Allure gone on at Notre Dame? Can you give us a brief history of Asian Allure? 
Nguyen-vu: Asian Allure has been at Notre Dame since the mid-1990s. I believe we're in its 12th year as a production. Originally, it started out as a fashion show predominantly eventually evolving into a cultural showcase. '11m original people involved in the show want­ed to involve the fledgling A<>ian groups on campus at the time. Twelve years later, we've expanded to include new members and groups. 
Scene: What are some acts to note in this year's show? Nguyen-vu: Some noteworthy acts in this show range from exciting cultural homages 
such as lAND's "Hollywood" to the exciting rock fest of Japan Club's "Sakura ne?: The Final Act" and even the generaUy impressive and mind-boggling Matrix Team. While we always invite clubs to perform in the show, this year, we had an increased interest in perform­ances by individuals. So, people will-definitely be seeing some rather polished and excellent talent from the ranks of Notre Dame's own Asian community. This year's show has a record 18 performances, over half of which are individually driven rather than c!ub driven. 
Scene: How does this year's show compare with last year's? 
Nguyen-vu: This show is entirely and com­pletely superior to the previous year's show. I'll leave it at that. 
Scene: Who runs the show? Is it entirely stu­dent-led? 
Nguyen-Vu: We're student-nm and student­IPd. The Asian-American Association is the chief sponsor and umbrella organization involved in the funding <md production of the show. 
Scene: Why should a Notre Dame or Saint Mary's student take time from thPir schedules to cheek out Asian Allw·e 2008? 
Nguyen-vu: Students should definitely take their time to check out Asian Allure to expand their horizons. I mean let's face it, tllis is a bub­ble here. Asian Allure really i<> an attempt to represent a wide and diverse array of A<>ian culture made for students and by students. There is much to enjoy and much to learn, given the rich hi<>tory and current trends for Asians and Asian-Americans. I also believe that it would be a symbol of appreciation for all the hard work, tenacity, and complete dedi­cation of all the individuals involved from pro­duction to execution. We've come far and we've sacrificed much time. And I promise you this; it will be a show to remember.

Maddon, Pinella honored with MOY awards 
Rays rnanager foe Maddon wins AL award after storybook season; Cubs' Pinella claims NL honor with league-best record 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -J01~ Maddon had a good reason !i1r interrupting his IHmeymoon. 
!\bout an hour aller he landed in Honw, the newly married Maddon easily won the American League Manager of the Year award Wednesday !i1r guiding Tampa Bay from baseball's basement to the World Series in one astonishing snw;;on. 
Lou Piniella took the NL honor after hmding the Chicago Cubs to the league's best record. 
Maddon, who sucn~eded Piniella as Tampa Bay manager in 2006, was a runaway winner in balloting by the Baseball Writers' Association of 1\meriea. lie reeeivnd all but one of the 2S first­place votes -the other went to Minnesota's Hon Gardenhire. 
It was a nice wedding gill for Maddon and his wife, .!aye, who got married last weekend. But it nwant that one of the first things he did in Italy wa<> get on the phone for a eonference call with enporters. 
"Jaye is very understanding of the wholn situation. We knew this was a possibility," Maddon said. "Truly a remarkabln sea<>on in so many di!limmt ways." 
Next stop: the Vatiean on Thursday. Then the Sistine Chapd, followed by trips to Florenee, Prah'Ue and London. 
"I really don't think they eare about the World Series over here," Maddon said. "It's kind of fun being a tour h'Uide." 
Pininlla bf1at out Charlie Manuel of the World Series champion Philadelphia Phillies to earn his third Manager of the Year award and first in the NL. The fiery skip­per also won in 1995 and 2001 with Seattle. 

This time, he got 15 of 32 first­plaee votes and totalP.d 1 03 points to 6 7 for Manuel, listed first on eight ballots. Florida's Fredi Gonzalez finished third with five first-plaee votes and 48 point<>. 
''I'm thrillnd and I'm honored. I know thP.re were a lot of managers in the National League who had good seasons," PiniP.IIa said from hi<> home in Tampa, Fla. 
The 65-year-old manager earned a $100,000 bonus for winning, which he plans to donate to the team's charity partner, McConnick Foundation's Cubs Care. 
"My good fortune can get spread around a little bit," Piniella said. "The kid<> in the Chicago area will benefit from this and I'm very happy." 
Two· other managers garnered frrst-plaee votes: Joe Torre of the Los Angeles Dodgers (three) and Tony La Hussa of the St. Louis Cardinals (one). 
Dale Sveum got a third-place vote after managing only 12 games. He took over the Brewers on an interim basis when Ned Yost wa<> fired in September and went 7-5 down the stretch to help Milwaukee secure it<> frrst playoff berth since 1982. 
After the season, the Brewers hired Ken Macha to be their new manager. Sveum will return as hit­tingeoaeh. 
Tampa Bay, which started play in 1998, had never won more than 70 games in a season before Maddon engineered an incredible turn­around. With his motivational quotes and phrases, the 54-year­old skipper led a young team that finished in last place a season ago (66-96) to a 97-65 record and the AL Ea<>t title. 
"The toughest part is to absorb the body blows on a eonsistent basis. I knew what we were doing was right," Maddon said. "We knew we were better, we just didn't know how mueh better. During the season we found out we eould do this, and people started to believe." 
Maddon used his versatile b1meh brilliantly and juggled a mueh­improved bullpen that lost veteran closer Troy Percival to injury. The stunning success continued in October, when the Rays beat the Chicago White Sox and defending champion Boston Red Sox in the playoff<> to capture the AL pennant. 
Tampa Bay's run ended with a live-game loss to Philadelphia in the World Series. 
"It was all there for us. It was just a matter of time," Maddon said. "It happened a little sooner than I thought." 
While Manuel guided the Phillies to their second championship, Piniella and his Cubs (97-64) were swept in the first round of the play­offs for the second consecutive year. Their three-game loss to the Dodgers was a major disappoint­ment for a franchise still seeking its first World Series title since 1908. 
Voting for BBWM awards is con­ducted before the postseason. "Time heals a broken heart, I 

guess," Piniella said. "Looking back, these kids I think tried a little too hard." 
There has never been a unani­mous winner for Manager of the Year. 
La Russa and Atlanta's Bobby Cox have each won the award four times, the only managers with more than Piniella. Dusty Baker and Jim Leyland al<>o have three. 

The BBWM began presP.nting Manager of the Year awards in 1983. 
Piniella beeame the fourth man­ager to win in both leagues, joining Cox, La Hussa and Leyland. Previous winners from the Cubs were Jim Frey (1984) and Don Zimmer (1989).

Associated Press 
IRVING, Texas -Tony Romo laughed at the notion his return to the Dallas line­up will be the complete cure for the struggling Cowboys. 
"We will find out on Sunday," Romo said. "A lot of different people may have gotten to a point where they feel we might not have a chance to do what we hoped to do at the beginning of the year. ... I think that is something that can bring a team together." 
The Cowboys (5-4) have gone from Super Bowl favorites to third place in the NFC East by losing four of their last six. They are 1­2 since Romo broke the pinkie on his throwing hand, but had the same record in the three games before he got hurt. 
Romo, who returned to practice during last week's open date, is ready to get back on the field Sunday night when the Cowboys play the Redskins in Washington. Romo doesn't expect the pinkie to be a problem. 
"It's getting better," Romo said Wednesday. "Every day it gets a little better and I'm confident that I'll feel pretty good for the game." 
Asked what the pinkie might keep him from doing, Romo responded, "I don't know that there will be any­thing." 
Romo said there is a "lit-

IN BRIEF Earnhardt, Ganassi to merge 
NASCAR racing teams 
MIAMI -Teresa Earnhardt and Chip Ganassi will combine their sponsorship-strapped race teams next season, an effort to stabilize their organizations in a tough economic time. 
The combined team will be called Earnhardt Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates and will field cars for Martin Truex, Aric Almirola, Juan Pablo Montoya and a driver yet to be named. 
"In this ultra-competitive era of NASCAR, it is necessary to build and sustain the strongest team possible, and our combin­ing with the people and equip­ment at Dale Earnhardt Inc. will help create a strong four-car program for years to come," Ganassi said Wednesday in a statement. This is a win-win for both organizations as well as all of our partners." 
tle bit of pain" taking snaps from center, but described that as "no different than having a little bruise or something. You just play through it." 
Terrell Owens said it's obvious Romo is feeling bet­ter the way he is throwing the ball. 
"He's trying to get a feel for what he can do and what he can't do," Owens said. "We're going to assess that, the coaches will, just like any practice. I don't think they're going to hold him back by any means." 
Romo got hurt on the first play of overtime in the Cowboys' 30-24 loss at Arizona on Oct. 12. 
While Dallas had strug­glBd after a 3-0 start with Romo in the lineup, includ­ing a loss to Washington on Sept. 28, the offense was horrendous with Brad Johnson and Brooks Bollinger playing quarter­back. 

The Cowboys didn't score more than 14 points in any of those three games, and won 13-9 over Tampa Bay despite a franchise-low 172 total yards. They then gained only 183 yards in 35-14 loss at the New York Giants before the much­needed open date. 
Romo might not be the cure, but his return certain­ly won't hurt. 
"He has got zip on the ball. Players see that, and I think it helps our practices," coach Wade Phillips said. 
76ertJ snap losinf,! streak 
1n victory over Raptors 
TORONTO -Elton Brand scored a season-high 25 points, Andre Miller and Andre Iguodala each had 18, and the Philadelphia 76ers snapped a three-game losing streak by beating the Toronto Raptors 106-96 on Wednesday night. 
Willie Green scored 17 points and Marreese Speights had 12 for the 76ers, who won for the first time in four road games this season. 
Brand, who had scored just 31 total points in Philadelphia's past three games, eclipsed his previous high of 24, set in an Oct. 31 victory over New York. 
Chris Bosh had 30 points and 12 rebounds, but Toronto still lost for the fourth time in five games after starting the season 3-0. Jermaine O'Neal added 19 points and 11 rebounds, and reserve Andrea Bargnani scored 15 for the Raptors. 

Semin's two goals lead 
Capitals to blowout victory 
RALEIGH, N.C.-Alexander Semin had two goals and three assists to move take the NHL scoring lead. and the Washington Capitals routed the Carolina Hurricanes 5-1 on Wednesday night to take sole posses­sion of the Southeast Division lead. 
Alex Ovechkin had a goal and two assists, and Nicklas Backstrom had a goal and three assists for the quick­starting Capitals. They led 3-1 after one period and cruised to their third straight victory. 
Mike Green added a goal and an assist for Washington. 
Scott Walker scored on the power play for Carolina, which was outscored 10-3 in losing two straight at home. The Hurricanes have lost three of four to fall two points behind Washington. 
The Capitals dominated from start to finish, and Semin had a hand in all five goals.

WHY CHOOSE A MINOR OR A SUPPLEMENTARY MAJOR IN LATINO STUDIES AT ND? 
Changes in American demography make it imperative for professionals and leaders, in all fields, to understand the politics, economics, and cultures of the US Latino/Hispanic community. Health professionals, for example, are already implementing programs tailored to the needs ofUS Latinos/Hispanics; the private sector is recognizing their growing purchasing power; and policymakers and political leaders have come to realize that Latinos/Hispanics may play a decisive role in the US electoral vote. 
The minor or the supplementary major in Latino studies will deepen stu­dents' knowledge ofthe cultures, art, history, literature, religious life, politi­cal expression, and public policy issues ofnearly 40 million Latinos/Hispanics in the United States. 
The programs encourage research into new issues such as changing immigra­tion patterns, remittances, emerging transnational communities, and cultural flows between Latinos/Hispanics in the United States and their families' countries oforigin. 
While the emphasis is on domestic communities, consideration ofglobaliza­tion, immigration, and border issues introduces an international dimension.

children and that 11 years of 
commuting coast to coast was 
enough for him. 

"This is the toughest decision 
I've ever had in my life, profes­
sionally, as far as what to do 
next," Burke said. ''I've been 
wrestling with the decision. 
I've got four older children on 
the East Coast and two little 
ones (4 1/2 and 2 1/2), and I 
don't see any of them enough. 
So I felt if I can get a chance to 
get in the same time zone with 
them, I'm going to take it." 
Burke and Ducks CEO 
Michael Schulman have been 
discussing this possibility for 
the past 11 months and Burke 
made his decision Nov. 1. 
Schulman said he was disap­
pointed at first, but insists 
their relationship is "stronger 
than ever." 

"The reason for a midseason change is simple: We wanted to give Brian all the time he needed to make a sound deci­sion. After everything he's done for the franchise, he deserved that," Schulman said. "We accept his decision as being in the best interests of his family. We are a family first organization." 
One o( the factors that made the decision easier for Burke was the 2007 Stanley Cup championship. 
"There wouldn't have been any decision without that," Burke said. "I would have con­tinued to do the !lying and the commute. There's no way I would have had the nerve to ask to go back somewhere if I hadn't have won a champi­onship here. So that Stanley Cup justified my asking ­because if I hadn't delivered, it would have been a real differ­ent equation." 
For now, Burke will remain with the club as a special con­sultant to Schulman through the transition period -which he hopes with be a short one. 
''I'm going to try to get off the payroll as quickly as I can once I'm told it's the appropri­ate time frame," Burke said. "Mike Schulman's been very generous with me, and I don't want to draw any pay here after I no longer have a useful roll. But that's their call, too." 
Your vocation to heal starts here. 

Murray has spent 33 seasons 
in the NIIL, and was a two­
time All-Star during his 15­
year playing career -all of 
them with the Chicago 
Blackhawks. They named him 
general manager in 1997 aft1~r 
two seasons under Bob 
Pulford, then fired him in 
1999. 
"It's kind of bittersweet," 
Murray said. "The day I was 
let go in Chicago, one of the 
first phone calls I got that day 
was from Brian Burke. lie 
called me again the next day, 
telling me that he would hire 
me immediately. His goal was 
to get me back in the saddle. 
There's only 30 of these jobs 
available, and it's an honor 
and a privilege for me to come 
here and take over. I'm excited 
and I can't wait to get started." 
Murray also will carry the title of executive vice presi­dent. lie has spent the last three-plus seasons with the Ducks, who have made the playoffs every year he has been with the team. 
"We all knew that Murph was the guy that should take the job," Burke said. "There arc other qualil'ied people on the staff, but Murph has been my right hand man here and has been involved in every decision. lie's going to be the guy to step behind the wheel, anyhow, than the sooner the better. We've got lots of impor­tant decisions facing this hock­ey club." 
Suddenly, Burke has emerged as one of the top can­didates for teams looking to snag a GM with a marquee name and an impressive track record. But he's uncomfortable talking about it, even though he has to find another job eventually. . 
"There's no fun for GMs who are in trouble when there's a guy out there that's available," Burke said. "I remember when I was a rookie GM in Vancouver and Glen Sather got let go (by Edmonton). It was like being on a beach and knowing there was a great white shark out there. So I hope that this situation doesn't change any other GM's situa­tion."

MLB 
Rockies ship Holliday to Athletics in trade 
Associated Press 
OAKLAND, Calif. -Matt Holliday hardly could have expected to land with the low­budget Oakland Athletics. 
The 1\s completed their trade with the Colorado Rockies for the star outfielder Wednesday, securing the big bat Oakland sought for the middle of its order. 
"Originally, it was a little bit of a surprise considering I've never been traded before," Holliday said. "I spent my first 11 years of professional baseball in the Rockies organization. Any time you make a change there's a bit of an unknown." 
Colorado received right-hand­ed reliever Huston Street, lefty starter Greg Smith and promis­ing outfielder Carlos Gonzalez from the 1\s. The clubs reached a tentative agreement Monday, but had to wait for the results of physicals and other details to be worked out. 
"The long-term model for our organization to be successful has always been built around the team dynamic," Rockies general manager Dan O'Dowd said in a statement. "The three men we acquired from Oakland are tal­ented major league players that are a solid fit for us." 
Oakland GM Billy Beane and O'Dowd speak regularly and had discussed Holliday since just after the season ended. 
"We landed one of the biggest hitters out there," 1\s manager Bob Geren said. "He's definitely a piece of the offense you can build around." 
This is a major move by an 1\s team that began rebuilding last winter and is more accustomed to losing star players than acquiring them. 
"We wanted a right-handed bat and we got one," Oakland outfielder Jack Cust said. "It's usually the other way around ­giving away a bigger-name guy for guys who aren't as estab­lished. It's definitely exciting going into the season."

Holliday, a two-time All-Star and runner-up for the 2007 NL MVP award, is due to make $13.5 million next season and then will be eligible to become a free agent. Whether he stays in Oakland past the 2009 season or even next year's All-Star break, nobody knows. 
''I'm not worried about that. Oakland wanted me for a rea­son," Holliday said. 
He has 128 homers and 483 RBis in five big league seasons. His best year was 2007, when he won the NL batting title with a .340 average. He also had 36 homers and a league-best 137 RBis in helping the Rockies reach the World Series. He fin­ished second to Philadelphia shortstop Jimmy Rollins for NL 
MVP. 
Beane said he's still focused on boosting the A's farm system from the bottom on up, and acquiring talented prospects only helps to pull off deals like this one. He's unsure whether Oakland will be able to keep Holliday long-term. 
''I'm not Pollyannaish enough to believe you acquire one play­er and go from 75 to 95 wins," Beane said. "We'll focus on the whole year. Matt's a premium player. I guess we'll sort of cross that bridge when we get to it." 
Geren spoke to Holliday by phone just after the deal became official. 
"He is going to help us tremendously," Geren said. "We all know the kind of talent he 
has with his numbers, but I 
talked to him and you can tell 
the kind of person he is. It's a 
great fit." 
New 1\s third base coach Mike 
Gallego came from the Rockies 
and has thrown batting practice 
to Holliday the past three sea­
sons -so that's a positive for 
Holliday. 
Oakland reached the AL 
championship series in 2006 
before being swept by Detroit. 
This season, it finished with its 
worst record (75-86) since going 
7 4-88 in 1998. The 1\s lost 44 of 
their last 68 games after being 
just four games out of first place 
on July 11. 
Oakland was last in the major .leagues with a .242 batting aver­
age and last in the AL with 646 
runs. The A's also used eight 
starters in left field, so Holliday 
provides stability in that spot. 
"First of all, we needed to 
upgrade our offense. That was 
obvious," Beane said. "Matt fills 
a much-needed spot in the 
order." 
Holliday joins a roster featur­
ing six-time Gold Glove third 
baseman Eric Chavez, who is 
expected to come back healthy 
from shoulder surgery. The team 
recently re-signed second base­
man Mark Ellis and shortstop 
Bobby Crosby. Cust batted .231 
with a team-leading 33 home 
runs and 77 RBis while drawing 
111 walks in 2008. 
"It's caused a lot of attention 
around these parts, the fact we 
got a big guy the Yankees want­ed and a lot of other teams wanted," Cust said, speaking by phone from New Jersey. 

"The last couple years we've had a lot of injuries and a lot of guys not doing as well as they'd like," he added. "They say hit­ting is contagious and I believe that. Once you get guys rolling and get the pitcher worrying about a few guys, they've got to really bear down in the middle of the lineup. I played with Matt in Colorado. We were in the minor leagues together and now we'll be in the big leagues together, so it's come full circle." 
The 24-year-old Smith had elbow surgery last month. He went 7-16 with a 4.16 ERA in 32 starts and 190 2-3 innings dur­ing his first major league sea­son. 
The 25-year-old Street was demoted from his closer role this season and finished 7-5 with a 
3.73 ERA and 18 saves in 25 chances. He would join a bullpen that includes Manny Corpas but is expected to lose closer Brian Fuentes in free agency. Street can become a free agent after the 2010 season. 
Like Smith, the 23-year-old Gonzalez just finished his first big league season. He hit .242 with four homers and 26 RBis in 302 at-bats. 
Smith and Gonzalez, consid­ered a top prospect, both came to the A's last offseason in the blockbuster trade that sent ace Dan Haren to the Arizona Diamondbacks.

In fact, in Turner's sopho­more year, her team lost in the state semifinals to a Fenwick team that included Pnters. Fenwick went on to win the title, and McGraw said Turner remembered the game. 
"Devereaux set some screens on her," McGraw said. "They were talking 
about that when she came down for a visit. It was a memorable screen, she said." 
The proximity of campus to Chicago helps keep players' parents involved, McGraw said.

Tom has great footwork and one of his greatest assets is that the game comes easy to him. He has a good feel for how to play the game and plays within himself. Tom is just a very steady and con­sistent player."

season. Zahm made it to the intnrhall ehampionship game in Notn~ Damn Stadium. Even though it was three full sea­sons ago, Ossei-Anlo still points to that gamn as the highlight of his interhall foot­ball earnnr, as many of those who had the same experinnce undoubtedly would. 
As a four-year starter at run­ning baek. Ossei-Anto beeamn accustomed to the view of the game from within the game. Thus, being sidelined on the first day of practiee with a broken thumb, Theo began his snnior season with a new van­tage point. 
"It was just a real freak acci­dent," Ossei-Anto said of the injury. "It hurt a lot to have to sit and watch the team lose and not be able to do anything about it." 
This frustration led Ossei­Anto to disregard doctor's ordnrs and resume play after only thren weeks, instead of the recommended six. Once baek on the field, Ossei-Anto and the four other Zahm sen­iors set to improving the Rabid Bats 0-1-l record. While it did not neeessarily turn out exact­ly as desired (Zahm finished 1­

about "making plays," but said sometimes throwing the ball away' or taking a saek bnnefits the offense. 
".lust the r'\atun~ of' playing football, you want to make a play on !Wery single play," he said. "Sometimes it's not a play that ean be madn, and you've just got to either drop the ball down, run the ball or 
even  lake  a  saek."  
The  undern eath  routes

against Boston College. lie completed nine passes to run­ning back Armando Allen in thn middle of the field. Clausen said continued suc­cess of' the underneath routes will !'oren the defense to eome forward. opening the deep route again. 
"Once you throw the ball underneath, dink and dunk teams and you can run the ball and make teams come up and guard the underneath s t ll ff. Ill a k e the rn s t 0 p the run," Clausen said. "Then they como up and you have shots down the field that you can throw and make plays." 
In terms of helping the short passing attack. receiver David (;rimes said the receivers rwed to takn advantagll of the opportunilins they're given. 
Grimes said the level of attention in thn offensive mnetings has increased now 

2-1 ). the Rabid Bats were able to win its final game of the season and the final game of Ossei-Anto's career, 8-0 over Fisher. 
"We had a lot of raw talent in key positions, but just didn't gel as well as we should have," Ossei-Anto said. 
A difficulty in finding team chemistry is understandable when the center, quarterback, and running back are all freshmen, as they were for Zahm the first two games in Ossei-Anto's absence. 
But the team's youth hints at potential for Zahm 's coming seasons, and if the Rabid Bats do find success, Ossei-Anto will know he was a piece of the foundation. 
Looking back upon his four seasons and almost twenty games, Ossei-Anto fondly remembers a lot. But one repeated experience, in which he sees glimpses of himself, stands in the forefront. 
"I honestly think the high­light Ibesides playing in the Stadium! was being able to see other people who always loved the game, who dreamed to get on the field, like me, and then succeed," said Ossei-Anto. "I just love interhall football. I love football in general."

that head coach Charlie Weis runs the meetings. Weis will call plays this week because of a death in offensive coordina­tor Mike Haywood's family. 
"Still the same playbook, same plays, but I think, you know, guys arc paying atten­tion to it and are more aware of attention to detail," Grimes said. 
It doesn't matter to Clausen who calls the plays, he said; the execution of the play remains the same. 
"To be honest, when you're in thll game you're not really thinking, 'Oh, he's calling plays or he's calling plays,"' Clausen said. "You know, you're just getting the play from the sideline and going out there and executing it." 
Both Clausen and Grimes said Navy challenges Notre Dame every time the teams meet. 
"Whenever you play them they're going to give their all," Grimes said. "They're out there defending their country. Football is the best part of the day for them." 
Although Clausen missed last year's Navy game, a triple-overtime loss in South Bend, because of injury. he remembers the impact of the game. 
"I don't think that anyone in this building wants to feel like they did after that game," he said.

on Nov. 25. 
Ifthey keep winning this week­end, though, the Iri'ih ean put themselves in position for a few more games at home-NCAA Tournament games are played on the higher-seeded team's campus until the College Cup's final four (Dec. 12-14 in Fresco, Tex.). 
And that would be an advantage the Irish would love to have. At 9­0-1, Notre Dame is unbeaten at home and settled for its only draw against No. 2 St. John's on Sept. 19. 
"Ideally you want to be in the top four for a No. 1 seed, but it's hard to predict with all the conference tournaments coming up," Clark said. "Ifwe won the two games in the [Big East] final four, we'd have a fair chance of being a top-four seed. If we win one game, I'd say we'll be in the top eight, and ifwe don't win one, we still have a really good chance of being a top-16. 

"That's my reckoning of it, but you just don't know-it's hard to predict how the committee will ultimately decide." 
Ifthe Irish want to earn signifi­cant home-field advantage, how­ever, they'll have to overcome South Florida's tomorrow night. Despite entering the tournament as the Heel division's No.2 seed, South Florida is hosting the semifi­nal and championship games based on a predetermined arrangement. 
"Even though we're the number one seed, with the way things have fallen, it's suddnnly an away game, whieh makes it a little bit more dif~ fieult and more of a challenge," Oarksaid. 
Uke Notre Dame, the Bull<; haven't lost at home all year­they boast a 7-0-1 record on their own field. 
"It's a tough place to go and win," <1ark said. "It's a great envi­ronment. they'll have a groat crowd, it'll bn on national TV -it's exciting stufl'. It's a good tnst to go into thi'i type of environment and see how we handle it." 
llandlll it well, and the Iri'ih won't have to worry about playing away from Numni Field for anoth­ermonth.

Hoops teatn nabs four recruits on National Signing Day 
By GREG ARBOGAST Sports Writer 
Thn time is now for No. 9 Notre Dame, but Irish coach Mike Brey hasn't slopped thinking about the futuro. 

Hrey helped shore up the nnxl wavn of Irish talent Wndnesday as four seniors faxed their letters of intent to play in South Bend for the next four years. This comes on the heels of a year when Notre Dame did not sign any recruits but did nnt two transfnrs ­Scott Martin from Purdun and Ben Hansbrough from Mississippi State. 
The elass of 2009 will includn swingman .Joey Brooks (Houston. Tex.) and a trio of frontcourt talent: Mike Broghammer (Minnetonka, Minn.). Jaek Cooley (Glenview, Ill.) and Tom Knight (Dixfield, Maine). 
"We're excited to have Mike, Joey, .Jack and Tom join our Notre Dame basketball family," Brey said in a statement. "They're a great fit for our program and our style of play. With Mike, .Jack and Tom, we're getting three physical frontline players who like to play hard, while .Joey gives us an athletic presence on the perimeter." 
The recruits fit in with Brey's recruiting style of signing tal­ented but not one-and-done players; players who are likely to develop over four years. Each of the four recruits is rated a three-star player at his position by Scout.com. 

Brooks, a 6-foot-5, 200­pound guard, led Strake Jesuit College Preparatory to the UIL District 18-5A title last season as a junior and averaged 22.0 points, 9.0 rebounds, and 2.0 steals per game. Those accom­plishments earned him a spot on the Houston Chronicle Greater Houston Area team and helped him garner all­state recognition. 
"Joey is lan] extremely ath­letic perimeter player who has the ability to be a slasher to the basket," Brey said. "I was really impressed with him when I first saw him play point guard for his AAU team. lie's got a high basketball IQ and has a great feel and under­standing for the game. " 
Broghammer, a 6-foot-9, 235-pound forward, averaged 
11.9 points and 10.0 rebounds as a junior while leading his team to a 27-2 record with the only two losses coming against

Irish struggle to improve downfield passing game; team prepares to take on Navy

Opposing defenses learnnd their lesson from watehing tape of Notre Dame in the early part of the season and started laking away deep routns, Irish quarterback Jimmy Clausen said in his weekly press conferenee. 
"A.I'ter the first half of the North Carolina game, teams have benn trying to take the two outside guys away, Golden !Tate! and Mike !Floyd!, and dropping more guys into cov­erage and making me tak1~ the undnrneath stuff," Clausen said. 
Boston Collnge took away the deep pass against Notre Dame. Clausen's longest pass, a 32-yard completion to Floyd, was a shorter pass over the middle that Floyd took down the sideline on his own.

"Mike is a physical frontline player who eontinues to devel­op his offensive game," Brey said. "He's strong inside the post, but is eomf'ortable step­ping out and facing the basket. Mike is an excellent defendm and a good rebounder at both ends of the floor and passes the ball extremely well."

Chicago guard signs vvith Irish 
By BILL BRINK Spons Editor 
Kaila Turner, a 5-foot-8 point guard from Joliet, Ill., signed a letter of intent to play for Notre Dame, Irish coach Muffet McGraw said in a press confer­ence. 
Turner signed at the start of the early signing period, whieh began Wednesday. She gives Notre Dame depth at the point guard position, something it eurrently lacks, McGraw said. 
"We need another point guard," she said. "Hight now we're working with one point guard in Melissa Lechlitner. Kaila has an opportunity to learn from one of the best point gua.rds .~n the Big East under Melissa. 
McGraw said Turner's game is complete and that she does many things well.

Ossei-Anto reflects on career with Zahtn 
By DOUGLAS FARMER Spons Wri tcr 
Even though the team in the gold helmets gets all the glory, those in the white hel­mets put in the work, too. Zahm 's Tlwo Ossei-Anto is a perfect example of that. 
Ossni-Anto's entire extend­ed family is from Ghana, and at the age of live, he, his par­ents and his four sisters moved to the United States. But Tlwo did not start play­ing football until high school. 
He soon learned why so many grown men miss their playing days. 
".Junior and senior years of high school, there was always a lot of personal things," Ossei-Anto said. "But on the lield it all melted away and I truly felt at home." 
So Ossei-Anto was elated when he learned of Notre Dame's well-kept seeret-he eould play full contael foot­ball in college as well.
