Petition calls for outdoor graduation 
By DAN MURPHY Staff Reporter 
Junior Jim Winkler has started a pe­tition to move graduation ceremonies into the football stadium next May. 
Big families mean big problems for seniors when it comes to graduation commencement ceremonies, according to Winkler. "I think it's absolutely ridiculous to have to have a lottery among your own family for four graduation (commencement cere­mony) tickets," said Winkler. 
Commencement ceremonies have been held inside the air conditioned Joyce Athletic and Convocation Center since 1968, limiting the number of avail­able tickets. Each graduating senior receives four tickets to distribute to family members, often a difficult task. 
Winkler gave the petitions to hall presidents to circulate in each dorm. He plans on submitting the petitions to the administration early next week. "The petition is to show that it's not just my idea," said Winkler, "There are a lot of interested students." He said about one quarter of the dorms have returned the petition so far, and the number of signatures is "in the neighborhood of 500." Many students have expressed a desire to help orga­nize an outside graduation, he added. 
Winkler said he was unsure of the petition's prospects for success. "Everyone always says the adminis­tration doesn't listen to students. I think the idea is feasible. With a little creativity, we can make it work in the stadium," he said. 
The unstable South Bend weather is an important consideration, noted Winkler. "There is, obviously, always the possibility of rain, so we need a con­tingency plan, possibly in the ACC," he said. 
The threat of wet weather means everything must be duplicated if the ceremonies are held outside, incurring extra costs, according to assistant registrar David Kil. "You can never

House passes trade bill despite veto threat 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The House passed a sweeping trade bill Thursday, deliver­ing a sharp blow to President Reagan as supporters of the hotly disputed mea­sure piled up enough votes to override his threatened veto. 
"Our future isn't in the past," House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, declared as he fought a move to return the bill to a House-Senate conference commit­tee and drop a plant-closings provision that Reagan said he could not approve. "We can regain our competitiveness ... We can be No.1 again." 
The final tally, 312-107, contradicted numerous forecasts that the bill's spon­sors would fail to produce the two­thirds vote needed to override a veto. 
But many lawmakers, even if they had their doubts, appeared to have no taste in an election year for going on record against a measure billed as a plan to upgrade American competitive­ness. 
The bill was a House-Senate compro­mise on two competing measures that passed both chambers last year. The measure now goes to the Senate, where Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D­W.Va., planned to begin debate Friday. He was shooting for a vote on final pas­sage early next week. 
The House passed the measure after defeating, 253-167, a move by Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., to throw the bill back to the conference committee and drop the plant-closings provision. 
Reagan, on the road in Massachu­setts, said he would veto the bill if it came to him with the plant-closings provision intact. He also sent a letter to Michel, saying, "I want a trade bill." 
Controversy over the plant-closings provision overshadowed central fea­tures of the bill, which would stream­line the way the United States imposes import curbs to aid U.S. industries and retaliate against international trade vi­olations. 
Scores of other provisions range from repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies to billions of dollars in new agricultural subsidies.

A $1 million gift from a Wisconsin corporation will fund a legal ethics professorship at the University of Notre Dame Law School, the University an­nounced Thursday. 
The gift from Fort Howard Corp. of Green Bay will fund the Paul J. Schierl chair, named for the company's chair­man and chief executive officer. 
Schierl holds undergraduate and law degrees from Notre Dame and is a member of the Law School Advisory Council. 
Mobs, confusion at checkmarking will be corrected, says Weaver 
By MATT GALLAGHER Copy Editor 
Disorganized mobs rush­ing, pushing and shoving to get their checkmarked classes in O'Shaughnessy Hall should be a thing of the past, said Ellen Weaver, as­sistant chairman of the depar­tment of theology. 
The process of checkmark­ing Wednesday night was typified by confusion among the students in line for theol­ogy and English courses. 
Weaver said the problems arose because the students were unaware where the lines should form. She said the stu­dents in line for theology courses formed from both ends of the hall, and thus there were two lines meeting head­to-head at the office door; pandemonium ensued. 
Weaver, who was present W ednedsay evening in the theology office, said the prob­lem has been overstated. She said there was much confu­sion, but little violence. 
During checkmarking in April 1987, two students were injured as they were pushed through the glass doors of Stepan Center. 
Weaver said that the check­marking was moved to O'Shaughnessy in the fall of 1988 to prevent the confusion which marred the process at Stepan. 
Weaver stated the process went smoothly in November 1987. 
However, the disorganiza­tion was so great Wednesday night that "at a point, we thought (the students) might faint, they were so stifled," said Weaver. 
Joseph Buttigieg, chairman of the department of English, said, "We had a good system worked out. The oroblem was with people skipping lines." 
The "5:30 rule," preventing students from forming lines prior to 5:30p.m., was not en­forced on Wednesday because the departments failed to remind the Security office to enforce it, said Weaver. 
She said that last fall Secur­ity was asked to patrol O'Shaughnessy to prevent lines prior to 5:30 p.m., but apparently no one asked them to do the same this week. 
"No one thought to remind (Security); we assumed that

ND racial must be 
Almost one year ago today, a racial con­frontation marred the championship game of the Bookstore Basketball Tournament. No mat­ter what provoked the incident, I, among many spectators, sensed a very dangerous situation­-something that one would not expect to see at Notre Dame. 
This ugly incident inspired a letter from Uni­versity President Father Edward Malloy that called for the end of "comments or actions that display racial or ethnic insensitivity." Certain­ly, the fact that racially motivated incidents happen on this campus cannot be overlooked. Whether competition on the court or ignorance off the court breeds the ugliness, it is time that the University's administrators, faculty and students challenge themselves to examine their own attitudes concerning racial insensitivity. 
One of the problems at this University cur­rently being looked at is the obvious lack of minority students, faculty and administrative staff. Only 3 percent of the students and only a handful of faculty and administrators are black. The fact that these numbers are not anywhere close to national averages may lead to a general attitude that minorities should not have to be dealt with. This ignorance must come to an end immediately. 
The administration is apparently serious in attempts to end much of the racial ignorance. Its recommendations to increase minority en­rollment reflects Father Malloy's commitment to establishing goals in terms of minorities. Also, the University has named a senior admin­istrator to encourage and implement the direc­tives of the University. All of these steps are encouraging and should be looked at optimis­tically. 
One of the most positive steps that the Uni­versity has taken, however, was the Minority Visitation Weekend held last weekend. The pur­pose of the weekend was to bring in prospective minority candidates and acclimate them to the University setting. 
This is the type of action that needs to con­tinue if the University truly wants to end racial ignorance in the community. For students here in the community, it was a time to share their experiences with high school students and help them adapt to university life. Possibly more important, however, was that the community here saw that the program for increasing minority commitment, though long overdue, is making tremendous strides. 
One hundred and ten minority students came to Notre Dame. Eighty percent of these high school students will enroll here next year, ac-
problems addressed 

cording to estimates. This number eight times the amount of students who attended a similar weekend visitation four years ago. 
Students were able to meet and discuss ad­missions and financial aid possibilities and were given tours of the entire campus. Some were addressed by the deans of the various col­leges, and Father Malloy addressed the candi­dates. Students were also introduced to various student organizations at a student forum. 
Mter discussing the weekend with the high school students and actually taking part in one of the activities, it seems that everyone bene­fitted from the weekend. The entire weekend left everyone with a feeling that things are beginning to change for the minorities here. 
This change, nonetheless, is far from com­plete. When these minorities enter the Univer­sity, they will face many of the same problems that exist now. Integration is still a goal and not a reality at this point. 
It is our challenge now to act. The programs have been set, and progress has been witnessed in minority admissions. But this work will go for naught, unless attitudes change. Last weekend was an indication that attitudes are changing. Hopefully, this weekend, with the bookstore championship, will indicate that the change is not just a one weekend affair.

Israel celebrates 40th b-day 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM -Israel cele­brated its fortieth birthday Thursday, but in the violence­ridden occupied territories, it was called Firebomb Day, proclaimed by the PLO. 
Military jets roared over Jerusalem, and Israel honored Independence war veterans, who fought five Arab armies in 1948. 
Soldiers were on alert in the West Bank and Ga~a Strip, which Israel has occupied since the 1967 war, but Palestinians managed to throw a firebomb at a military patrol in Beth­lehem. 
Journalists were barred from much of the West Bank and Gaza, and the 1.5 million Pales­tinians who live there are prohibited from entering Israel for the rest of this week. Cur­fews in 23 towns and refugee camps affected about 400,000 Arabs. 
Palestinians were on general strike in much of the occupied lands, following the the instruc­tions of a Palestine Liberation Organization leaflet. 
Violence has swept the ter­ritories since Dec. 8, and at least 169 Palestinians have been killed. An Israeli soldier and civilian also have been slain. 
New details emerged Thursday about the assassina­tion of Khalil Wazir, the PLO military commander also known as Abu Jihad (Father of the Holy War). 
Israeli sources said an Is­raeli commando team carried out the operation under the direct command of Lt. Gen.

Firefighters Paul Floridia and Michael Portolese were slightly injured when sections of ceiling cpllapsed on them. 
"I felt the burning on my neck and told the man in back of me to stick the hose down my back," said Portolese. 
Residents told police that a contractor had been working on natural gas lines at the apartment complex the past few days, and that they had smelled gas during that period. 
City fire inspector Joe Bathje said it would be several days before a cause could be deter­mined.

Smoking ban on short flights starts Saturday 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Aboard thousands of airline flights, the smoking lamp is about to be ex­tinguished. 
The federal ban on cigarette smoking on domestic flights of two hours or less -about 80 per­cent of the total -takes effect at 
12:01 a.m. Saturday. Beforehand, some avid smokers are reconsidering train travel while others search for ways to keep their tobacco urges under control, at least for a few hours. 
Government and airline in­dustry officials said Thursday they expect the new smoking restrictions to cause few prob­lems, although some confusion may exist for the first few days. 
"On the whole, I think we're in reasonably good shape on this," said Transportation Sec­retary Jim Burnley, whose de­partment issued the new re­strictions earlier this month in compliance with a law enacted by Congress last year. 
Agostino elected new McCandless president 
Observer Staff Report 
The winners of the McCand­less Hall elections were an­nounced Thursday by Michelle Agostino, elections commis­sioner for Saint Mary's student government. 
The ticket of Kathy Schmidt was elected president with 63 percent of all votes cast. The ticket of Mary English gar­nered 29 percent of the vote, and 8 percent abstained. 
On the winning ticket were also Joanne Martin as vice­president, Nicole Hill as trea­surer, and Kathleen Dowd as secretary, said Agostino. 
33 percent of next year's hall residents voted in the election, the last hall election of the year, said Agostino. 
Schmidt said, "We think that McCandless has the potential to be a unified and active dorm on campus." 
She added that she plans to do this through "personal inter­action with the residents."

The Transportation Depart­ment and the Federal Aviation Administration have come un­der some criticism, however, for not pushing the airlines 
hard enough to publicize details of the new restrictions and avoid passenger confusion. 
"The airlines do not have a uniform policy to inform the public" about the new rules, said Susan Bianchi-Sand, pres­ident of the 21,000-member As­sociation of Flight Attendants. 
She said at least one airline inserted details about the new requirements into flight crew manuals only this week, and four airlines are continuing to book seats in smoking sections of no-smoking flights. 
An estimated 13,600 domestic flights a day will be affected. International flights are not af­fected, and the length of a flight will be determined by the time shown in the airlines' official schedule. 
Even if a flight is delayed in the air or on the ground and

The government has defined a flight as being any single seg­ment between two cities. Thus, for example, a traveler flying from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles with a stop in St. Louis would not be able to smoke on the first leg of the flight but would be allowed to do so on the second, longer leg.

"Even if itdoesn't rain," said Kil, "there is a high likelihood that hot and humid weather would make it very uncomfort­able for the guests, and espe­cially the graduates who would be wearing black ~owns." 
Kil emphasized that the cer­emony will be shown on closed­circuit television for those who are unable to attend. He also said there are many other events which the entire family may take part in during graduation weekend. He noted the glee club concert at Stepan Center on Saturday, a dance, the baccalaureate mass, tours of the Snite, dinners and brunches. 
Kil said he understands that the ceremonies are emotional for many seniors and family members, but he is unsure of how the university officials will receive the petition. "I'm sure they will take it into consider­ation, but I have a sense it will be turned down," he said. 
"If you're interested, and you think it's a worthy option," said Winkler, "write to the ad­ministration and request it." He also said that interested stu­dents should contact their former hall presidents about signing the petition.

P.O. Box Q 
Checkmark system favors cutthroats 
Dear Editor: 
Here we go again, another check­
mark system editorial. Let's review the 
system: stand in line, get checkmark 
card, fill it out, turn it in. Sounds simple 
enough, doesn't it? 
Well, I found out last night, Wednes­
day, that the words "classy, polity, 
courteous, decent, fair, loving and un­
derstanding," words that I thought 
were associated with the University of 
Notre Dame, are not part of the check­
mark system. Maybe it is not the fault 
of the checkmark system but of the 
many students who decided that all is 
fair in love, war and checkmarking. 
I was in line last night to checkmark 
an English course "Principles of 
Practical Writing." I got to 
O'Shaughnessy early because I knew 
that the lines would be long. There I 
was, with about 30 people in front of 
me in the line. The line got bigger as 
the minutes ticked away, and, just to 
be safe (so I thought), I checked with 
the people in front of me to see who 
wanted the same course. My survey 
found eight people in front of me who 
wanted the same course. Whew, I 
thought I was a shoe-in with plenty of 
openings behind me. 
My first mistake was assuming that 
lining up on the third floor of 
O'Shaughnessy were people of honor. 
Instead they turned out to be cut­
throats. I thought that they would fol­
low the rules of fair play, but that would 
be against everything the Notre Dame 
student stands for, wouldn't it? When 
the door opened, the people who were 
at the back of the line, which had 
snaked towards the front of the line, 
rushed to the front and filled the spaces 
in the course I wanted. 
Oh, wait a minute; I got it. It is the 
scripture addage "The first shall be 
last and the last shall be first," right? 
I knew it was connected to Notre Dame 
somehow. 
Whatever happened to "Good things 
come to those who wait?" It was 
replaced with "Nice guys finish last!" 
Solutions? How about callin~ 1-800­
CHECKMARK to register for those 
classes? At least I can have a fair shot 
at getting the class then. Of course, I 
would lose to the students who would 
cut the phone lines down.

O'Shaughnessy last night, but he left 30 seconds before the doors opened be­cause he didn't want to get hurt. How about handing out numbers like at the deli? What about doing each of the four departments in different buildings so the lines don't curl around themselves and let the last be first? The only ad­vantage to having checkmarks in O'Shaughnessy is that there are no win­dows to push people through. Different days for each of the four departments would help, too. 
I don't know what the solution is, but I hope someone finds one soon, for the freshman's sake. By the way, Professor Soens, I really would like to take your class, so if you can fit me in, please call; I'm in the book.

Fidelity ad parallels Python 
Dear Editor: 

Recently, several students have at­tacked a letter writer for objecting to the University's showing of "The Life of Brian." The students admit that the picture is "bawdy" and do not even deny that it is sacrilegious. Yet they conclude that these things should not be a concern and recite the usual lib­ertarian platitudes: "The purpose of a university is free and open intellectual exchange," and the Church's con­demnation of the film "belongs buried in the Church's past, along with the crusades and inquisitions .... " 
This all sounds very nice, and I'm sure the students who wrote these state­ments all got 'A's in their courses on civil rights, the American Consitiution and the Second Vatican Council. Yet isn't it interesting that this resounding attack on the evils of censorship comes only two months after the Notre Dame community in righteous wrath to violently condemn an ad for a Fidelity expose on the Notre Dame theology de­partment? Whatever one's opinion on the article, I didn't hear much about the right to free speech, the importance of freedom of dissent and the evils of censorship then. Instead everyone au­tomatically insisted the ad should be suppressed, to the point where the then editor-in-chief of The Observer knuckled under to outside pressure and

Progressive Quartet promises variety 
CAROLYN GARDNER 
accent writer 

Y
ou may have seen their posters around campus --the Kronos Quartet. Their group photo looks like a takeoff on the "Just Say No" campaign ... or maybe they're some sort of avant-garde garage band. In reality, Kronos is a foursome of serious musicians who perform exclusively 20th century music ranging from rock and jazz to contemporary classical music. 
MUSIC 

The Kronos Quartet will appear at O'Laughlin Auditorium tonight at 8 to conclude the Saint Mary's College 1987-88 Performing Arts Series. 
The group was founded in 
197.3 by first violinist David Har­rington. Other members include second violinist John Sherba, violist Hank Dutt, and cellist Joan Jeanrenaud. Both Dutt and Jeanrenaud are former Hoosiers, having studied and played in musical groups at Indiana University-Bloomington. Since their first performances in 1977, the unconventional quartet has garnered critical acclaim for its experimental and innovative ways of presenting chamber music while retaining the classi­cal tradition. 
The Quartet has premiered over 250 works in the last ten years, more than any other quar­tet In history. Harrington Is 
pleased with the current musical 
scene, maintaining that "this is 
the most exciting time for the 
string quartet. Every composer Is 
interested in writing for the 
string quartet today ... It's the 
most personal medium, the 
most difficult the clearest, the 
most concise." 
Accordingly, Friday night's program will feature music by Philip Glass, a 'new wave tango' by Astor Piazzolla, and the title song from Kronos' latest album, "White Man Sleeps," by Kevin Volans. 
But even if your taste runs contrary to such new music, Kronos may still have something for you. Jazz enthusiasts can expect to hear arrangements of music by Thelonious Monk, Bill Evans, and Omette Coleman, and the program will also in­clude 20th century classical music by Bela Bartok. Finally, though there's no guarantee on this one, the quartet is famous for its interpretation of Jimi Hendrix's "Purple Haze." 
Tonight's performance prom­ises to be an interesting blend of styles and the price is right for all of you budget-conscious (or just broke) music lovers: tickets are $7.50, $6.50, and $5.50 and are available through the O'Laughlin Auditorium Box Of­fice. If you'd like to postpone payment till you get a summer 
job, Visa and MasterCard orders 
are accepted. For reservations 
and further information about 
the Kronos Quartet, call the box 
office at 284-4626.

head, you've taken in the sights and sounds of one of the best known secrets in the Greater Michiana region: Between the Buns, "a sports and spirits, soup and sandwiches" establishment, located at 1150.3 Lincoln Way West in Osceola. 
Between the Buns is the type of place a sports fan loves. They have eight different beer brands, although only Old Style is on tap. The food is good and is aimed at the burger and fries crowd; and the atmosphere and fan in tune with the current sporting news and memorabilia of glorious moments in the past. 
The menu' alone at Between the Buns makes the trip worth the while. All of the entrees are written in the sports motif. "Leading Off and Playing Ap­petizers" tells of Macho Hector Ca-'Nachos,' a spicy bean and beef nacho basket that goes for $2.95. 
Other appetizers of note are the Chicken Strippers ($.3.25), strips of chicken breast deep fried and served with a choice of B.B.Q., sweet and sour, or mus­tard sauce. A note of warning: the B.B.Q. sauce is very spicy and the sweet and sour may be a better choice. 
The restaurant's name obvi­ously indicates that hamburgers are the speciality. The best choice on the menu is the Tinkers to Evers to Cheeseburger, a cheddar cheese burger that comes in a basket with cheese fries and pickles for only $.3. 25. 
Another special of note is the Chili Rodriquezz Burger, topped with homemade chili, raw onion, and cheddar cheese for $.3.95. The burgers are all served with cheese fries and are served on a choice of white, wheat, rye, sesame, or onion buns. It is good to tell the waitress you want the burger cooked well­done, because "rare" means "raw" in the kitchen. 
Although primarily a restau­rant, Between the Buns also has quality drinking capacities, ip­cluding a nice weather outdoor

Wilson and Borgman are both directing as part of their final project for COTH 444 Directing: Practice. Although not enrolled in COTH 444, Shea is currently a teaching assistant in COTH 221 Acting: Process. Shea appears in "Talking With .. " a series of monologues with nine women: two actresses, a housewife who lives in Oz, a rodeo rider, a baton twirler, a daughter griev­ing over her mother's death, a woman in labor, an old lady who loves McDonald's, and a tattooed woman. 
'There's a thread that runs through them all and ties them together," said Shea, "These people represent us. The theater is a mirror that reflects reality and these characters on the stage are a microcosm." 
Borgman is directing "Bent," a drama which depicts the per­secution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany. The story revolves around Max (Kevin Kennedy) who is forced to assist in the killing of his lover Rudy (Eli Coats). In Dachau, Max meets Horst (Matt Nash) another homo­sexual who teaches Max to

hiding behind the yellow Star of David worn by Jews and accept the pink triangle worn by gay prisoners. 
"The play shows homosexuals as real people, as opposed to the common stereotype,'" said Borgman, "They are people with emotions and relationships and problems just like anyone else. They just share a different sexual preference." 
"Gangsters" is another socially conscious play, with a very timely topic. "Gangsters" was inspired by the death of Steve Biko, a black South African ac­tivist and leader of the Black Consciousness Movement, in 1977. The main character of the play is Rasechaba (Eli Coats), a poet who describes the plight of blacks under apartheid in South Africa. 
"South Africa is a very impor­tant cause for me," said Wilson, "I believe that I chose the play because I wanted people to see what kinds of things go on In South Africa and I felt that this particular play was a useful tool ­for this desire."

The ND myth and its dream 
You may have read of timental over the landmarks; Portland, Maine, "the beau­but landmarks are unsentimen­tiful townlfhat is seated by the tal, and as indifferent to you as sea," in Longfellow's poem, dirt would be. It is painful to "My Lost Youth." Longfellow meet the child who was father was born in Portland in 1804, to the man. and I saw the light of day there I had a good time, talking to one and a quarter centuries the Notre Dame Club of later. Portland. I brought two props Last Friday, I went to to use in giving that talk: Pro-Father Robert Griffin Letters to a Lonely God Portland, after many years fessor Fischer's autobiography, away, to speak to the Notre "Notre Dame Remembered", Dame Club, and to test the published last year, and the saying, "You can't go home recent Notre Dame Report ex­again." Lons:~fellow's poem was amining University life. Holding the mood music that haunted up the book, I _said: "This is the me, until it finally became myth." Showing them the  Club in Portland, and In Manchester, New Hampshire, I became aware of how much Notre Dame, as a place where the myth is still taking place, means to the grads. On foot­ball weekends and at class reunions, they look forward to going home again, expecting to find change, yet hoping nothing essential to the myth has been lost. They want to recall, as Longfellow recalled, their lost youth; and many of them find it for a couple of days every spring or fall. Notre Dame doesn't change as their hometown changes, because tradition survives on a campus as a nourishment that keeps the school spirit alive. Notre Dame doesn't exist however, to embalm Its past.  What troubles me about the Notre Dame Report I realize now, after thinking about It for a week, is the perception that the University has, that it must be all things to all comers. So many needs have to be balanced, it seems, if Notre Dame is to fulfill its mission; and apparently we will not be at peace with ourselves until it happens. The Report makes Alma Mater sound as though she wished to be as caring as the earth mother, as involved in peoples' lives as the welfare state. We're replacing the Camelot myth with the myth of Utopia. The Task Force on whole health recommends a compre­hensive program of health promotion that addresses the spiritual, vocational, physical,  paternalism the price the Uni­versity has to pay, if It wishes to be more than a male Catho­lic ghetto, catering to upper­middle class white kids from conservative, Republican· families? The Notre Dame that I wanted to see nourishing is one where young men and wo­men, from an endless spec­trum of backgrounds, could come to be educated, and to grow in grace and wisdom before God and the world. All this in a climate of dignity and freedom that is so pervasive that they are even free to make costly mistakes. The teachers hired to instruct them should be free to teach their classes, write their books, and turn out as geniuses.

Nostalgia shouldn't be the glue that binds the Dream to the Myth; but I hope that in the 21st century, the grads will feel that in their trips to Notre Dame, they can, and will be, going home again.

Is it sentimental to claim that on a weekend in April, when I was 62, I met the child who was father to the man? Even so, It is true that you can't go home again, in a satisfactory way.

Drew leads usx Classic 
Associated Press 
GULFPORT, Fla.-Heather Drew, winless in five seasons on the LPGA tour, had a career-low six-under-par 66 on Thursday to take a one-stroke lead after the first round of the $225,000 USX golf Classic at Pasadena Yacht and Country Club. 
Tina Tombs-Purtzer, Martha Nause and Rosie Jones had 67s over the 6,013-yard course while another stroke back was the foursome of Kathy Ahearn, Donna White, Vicki Fergon and Kathy Postlewait. 
Australians Sherrin Smyers and Susan Tonkin were at 69. 
Drew, who played early in the day and began her round over the back nine, took advan­tage of the calm conditions with birdies on her first four holes. Her only bogey came on No. 4, her 13th hole of the day. 
"I was so far under par by the time I made my first bogey that it didn't really matter be­cause there was a par five right after that where I could make a birdie and get it back," Drew, a 28-year-old native of Solana Beach, Calif., said. 
Tombs-Purtzer, also playing early, posted seven birdies against two bogeys in her round. "Conditions were per­fect for playing early," she said. 
Nause and Jones played in 

the afternoon and had to battle 
wind. Yet Nause had only one 
bogey against six birdies. She 
birdied four of the first six 
holes.

playing together and their overall court balance. They are too solid a team for Hahn's to dismantle. 
In the other semi, look for a tight game between Adworks and Pop A Shot. A look at the position matchups and individ­ual talent gives Adworks the nod. They are a talented bunch of individuals. But they have put together several different lineups during the course of the tournament, replacing injuries and absences, and are not the cohesive team that Pop A Shot is. Pop A Shot is a talented bunch of individuals who also blend into a talented unit on the court.

ln the other 4:30 game, Ad­works All-Stars meets I'll Play, No I Won't. This will be a dandy. Adworks has Gary Voce, flashy Ricky Watters and sharpshooting Kevin Keyes and John Buscher.

But I'll Play is not the same team they were as Leone's Stal­lions for the past two years, missing Mike O'Grady to graduation and the hot hands of Gary Sasse who played with Air Doggers this year. 
Adworks has the guns--last year's Mr. Bookstore, the start­ing center on the Irish basket­ball team, the fleet-of-foot Wat­ters, the bulk of Matt Dingens underneath and the quiet talent of Keyes. They are solid and have perhaps the best talent in the tournament, the question is whether or not they put it all A Shot At Senior Bar and Lou's 
2 QBs and Two Blind Men will meet in another classic and in these eyes, another upset. Put simply, Pop A Shot has more talent on the basketball court and matches tip better against Lou's 2 QBs. Ralph Ferrara and Joe Hills have been on fire for Pop A Shot and could be the best backcourt duo next to the Nanni brothers. The inside games of both teams are strong but not overpowering. Pop A Shot's zone should contain the penetration of Jeff Peters and Tony Rice, and if they can keep George Baldus and Kent Graham off the boards, it's on to the Final Four. 
In the other late game, look for Hahn's Funeral Home to toss Chip's Bar in a tight one. Bubba Cunningham and com­pany are another talented group which complement each other on the court.

His father, two older sisters, two brothers, and a couple of uncles all have passed under the shadow of the Golden Dome at one time or another. 
"I've grown up with Notre Dame all my life," Walsh said. "It's been everything I ex­pected and more. The tennis program has given me a lot, the education is great, and I've made some great friends over the years. I just love the whole atmosphere of Notre Dame." 
Walsh began playing tennis at a local club when he was eight years old. At first, he played tennis simply for the pure enjoyment of it. 
Walsh began to take the sport more seriously when he en­rolled at Brother Rice High School, where he stockpiled an impressive list of athletic and academic honors.

In his four years at Notre Dame, Walsh has left his mark on the varsity tennis program. He is currently the third­seeded singles player for the Irish and teams with classmate Paul Daggs at the number­three doubles position. In addi­tion, he was a preseason nominee for academic All­American. Bayliss credits Walsh with helping his own transition into the Irish pro­gram. 
"Dan is an easy guy to get along with," Bayliss said. "Coming in as a new coach, I was unsure about how things would go, particularly with the seniors. But Dan is a good rep­resentative of Notre Dame, and he is a great competitor. 
"He's been one of our biggest winners. When he's on, he's pretty tough to beat. He'll hit winners from anywhere on the court. He doesn't seem to get rattled; he looks forward to the big matches." 
For his part, Walsh admits that it was difficult at first to adjust to the different style of a new coach. However, through his role as captain, Walsh has done a great deal in the way of shortening the gap between players and coach. 
"I'm the go-between between the players and coach Bayliss," says Walsh. "If they (the players) have a problem or a question and they don't want to take it to coach di­rectly, they tell me. Then, I usually bring it up at a team meeting." 
Despite all of his achieve­ments, Walsh is able to keep his success in its proper per­spective. Complacency has never been a problem for the 6-0 senior. 
"There are a lot of players in our program who are capa­ble of playing that don't play," Walsh said. "That just keeps pushing you. They've gotten stronger since I've been here, and that's been a big change. Just having so many people who can play pushes you to be better or you're not going to play." 
This perpetual drive to im­prove himself has given Walsh an edge over many of his oppo­nents which is not immediately apparent. 
"As a player, I think I've be­come mentally tougher," Walsh said. "Now, I can win a lot of matches just on experi­ence, even if the other guy's a little bit better talent-wise."

Pitching problems continue as Irish lose 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Assistant Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame baseball team could not find a cure to its recent pitching woes Thursday night at Coveleski Stadium, as the Irish fell 10-5 to IUPUI. 
Notre Dame has given up 10 runs or more in each of its last five games. The Irish (23-18) next go to Michigan State for a doubleheader on Saturday at 1 
p.m. before returning to Jake Kline Field for a twinbill with Illinois-Chicago on Sundayat 1 p.m. 
"I'm worried that since we're winning at a better clip than previous years, we've won 23 games and we've clinched a (MCC) playoff berth, we might be getting a little too com­placent," said first-year Irish coach Pat Murphy. "That worries me." 
IUPUI took control of the game by scoring four runs in the third inning and four runs in the fourth. Notre Dame sandwiched that onslaught with two runs in its half of the third, so IUPUI led 8-2 after four innings. 
"Our pitchers are getting ahead in the count, and then they don't know how to make pitchers' pitches," said Murphy. "Late in the year, when the hitters have caught up with the pitchers, you need

to work on your location. We're not that talented in pitching, and we have to be smart pitchers. Right now we're throwing too many right across 
the plate." 
Notre Dame had its share of chances. The Irish had its first two batters reach base on walks in both the first and second innings, but they failed to come away with any runs. Notre Dame left a game total of 12 runners on base. 
Brian Piotrowicz, in relief of losing Irish starter Erik Mad­sen (6-3), allowed just two un­earned runs in 4 2t3 innings of work, but the Irish hitters could not mount any kind of com­eback. 
IUPUI scored two runs in the eighth, and Notre Dame scored three in the bottom of the eighth to close the scoring at 10-5. 
"They (IUPUI) beat Indiana State last night," Murphy said after the Irish loss. "A lot of people don't know who they are, but they're a pretty good team." 
Having lost five of their last eight games, the Irish now await perhaps their toughest two games of the season. Mic­higan State holds a 24-10 record (9-5 in the Big 10), and the Spar­tans only recently exited the Top 20. 
Notre Dame has lost 18 con­secutive games against Big 10 opposition, and Michigan State 

swept a doubleheader from the 
Irish last year at Jake Kline 
Field. The Spartans won two of 
three games from Miami 
(Fla.) early this season, and 
they also sport a 6-2 record 
against Purdue and Northwes­
tern this year. Both the Boilers 
and Wildcats have defeated 
Notre Dame this year. 
"We'll have to have our best 
effort of the year to beat Mic­
higan State," said Murphy. 
"They're an established pro­
gram, and we've hit a down 
note right now."

Top-notch talent missing 1n 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Leigh Stein­berg, who represents some of the NFL's top players, is taking it easy this year, although he still has two players who will probably be picked in the top 15 in Sunday's draft. 
"I consider Brian Boitano my prime first-rounder," he says. 
If you listen to some scouts, Boitano, a Steinberg client who is headed for a professional ice skating career, might be a bet­ter NFL prospect than some of the football players out there. 
In fact, there's rarely been so much moaning and groaning as there has been about this year's NFL draft, which will take place Sunday beginning at noon, EDT. 
Some player personnel people consider it the worst draft of the decade and perhaps the worst ever. Some claim there are no more than 12 to 15 actual first-rounders available and one team gives only 112 players "make it" grades, less than half the 250 rookies who normally make NFL teams in

Perhaps. 
Linebacker Aundray Bruce of Auburn, who has already signed with the Atlanta Fal­cons, isn't considered as good a prospect as the top pi~ks of the last three drafts bruce Smith, Bo Jackson and Vinny Testa verde. 
And even the top seven or eight players are considered flawed in some fashion. 
For example, there are worries about Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown's hands; Craig "Ironhead" Heyward's

But Karl Mecklenburg, Deron Cherry, Mark Clayton, Richard Dent, Joe Jacoby, Jim Burt and several dozen other Pro Bowl-caliber players wouldn't be playing in the NFL if pre-draft ratings always stood up. All were taken in the eighth round or lower and Jacoby, Burt and Cherry were never drafted. 
Sutton pars out 
to lead 
Associated Press 
NEW ORLEANS -Hal Sutton saved par on the final hole, and with it preserved a 65 and a one­shot lead Thursday after the first round of the USF&G clas­sic. 
"That was the only time I got in trouble all day long," said Sutton, who played without a bogey in his 7-under-par effort. 
"It was a real solid round, and it could have been lower," said Sutton, who twice missed birdie putts of five feet or less. 
"I missed those two short ones, but I made a couple of long ones, so I guess it evens out." 
Sutton, a non-winner for al­most two years, hooked into the trees on the ninth hole. 
"I didn't have much of a shot at all," he said. He had to hook 
classic 

a 5-iron around the trees and caught a greenside bunker_ Sutton got it up and down from the sand, making a 5-foot putt to stay one in front of Tom Byrum. 
Byrum, not yet a winner in three years of PGA tour activ­ity, used some long-range put­ting and a fast finish for his best round of the year, a 66. 
He was even par through 10 holes, then birdied six of the last eight. Two of them came on putts from off the green, from about 20 and 25 feet, and Byrum dropped still another from about 25 feet. 
Veteran Lanny Wadkins, a winner in Hawaii earlier this vear, birdied three of his last tour holes for a 67. 
"I probably got the most I could out of it," Wadkins said. 
Fights mar eastern 
Associated Press 
Finesse appears on the way out and fists on the way in, at least in the eastern half of the NHL playoffs. 
"We're not going to be head­hunters, but as I've said before, you don't go to war with pea­shooters. We're going to have to reinforce our gloves with some extra padding when we go to Boston," Montreal coach Jean Perron said after Boston beat the Canadiens 4-3 to even their Stanley Cup quarter-final series at 1-1 Wednesday night. 
Montreal also lost 50-goal scorer Stephane Richer, who suffered a broken right thumb when he was slashed by Bos· ton's Michael Thelven. 
The same rule seems to apply to the Washington-New Jersey series, which is also tied 1-1. The Devils evened it by beating the Capitals 5-2 in a fight-filled game uncharacteristic for those two teams. 
The NHL playoffs continued Thursday night with the CampbeH Conference semi­finals. 
Detroit goalie Greg Stefan earned his first playoff shutout and Peter Klima scored three goals as the Red Wings beat the St. Louis Blues 6-0 and took a 2-0 lead in the best-of -seven Norris Division finals. 
Edmonton, leading 1-0 in its Smythe Division Series, was at Calgary in a late start. 
The Devils-Capitals game was interrupted at the 3:31 mark of the second period by a brawl involving three sepa­rate fights that held up the game 1~ minutes~ Four players were eJected New Jersey's Tom Kurvers and Perry Ander­son and Washington's Ed Kas­telic and Yvon CorrivP.:n1.

Pacers control destiny 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -The In­diana Pacers' season is down to two crucial games, and their chances of making the NBA playoffs for the second year in a row likely won't be decided until Saturday night in the final game against the New York Knicks. 
If the Pacers win, they're in; if they lose, they're out. It's that simple. 
"It doesn't guarantee us 

anything, but it helps our sit­uation," Coach Jack Ramsay said of Wednesday night's vic­tory at Atlanta, a 116-98 tri­umph that lifted the Pacers into a three-way tie with the Knicks and the Washington Bullets for the final two Eastern Confer­ence playoff positions. 
Indiana plays at Detroit Friday night and finishes at home against the Knicks the following night in Market Square Arena. Washington's remaining schedule included games against Detroit Thursday night and Atlanta on Saturday. The Knicks play at Milwaukee on Friday before the final game at Indiana on Saturday. 
If the Pacers beat New York 

and end in a two-way tie with 
Washington, the Bullets would 
get the seventh playoff spot and 
Indiana would get the eighth 
playoff position because of 
Washington's 4-2 season series 
advantage over the Pacers. 
Indiana would then have to 

play Eastern Conference 
champion Boston in the best-of­
five first round of playoffs. If 
the Pacers finish ahead of the 
Bullets, they would face 
second-place Detroit in the 
opening round. 
But Saturday night's game is of more immediate concern, since a loss to New York would give the Knicks a 3-2 season ad­vantage over the Pacers. 
"We've been getting a lot of chances with other teams losing," center Steve Stipanovich said of the Pacers' playoff hopes in the final week of the season. Beating Atlanta "was the first time we capi­talized on it." 
playoffs 

plans right now," he sa1d. "We've got to think of a couple of options." 
The series shifts to New Jer­sey for a game Friday night, giving the Devils the home ir<> advantage in their series. 
Boston, which has lost 18 se­ries to Montreal dating back to 1943, also now owns the home advantage. The two teams also play Friday night in a game that figures to leave a lot of scars on the smaller ice of the Boston Garden. 
As in the Langway incident, Montreal is sending videotapes of the Thelven-Richer incident to the league office. Thelven claims he is innocent of wrongdoing and was just trying to lift Richer's stick when the injury occurred. It is the same thumb the Montreal winger in­jured late in the season and missed five games because of it.

Cubs beat Expos with hot hitting 
Associated Press 

CHICAGO-Vance Law ex­tended his hitting streak to 14 games with a two-run homer, and Andre Dawson hit a home run and a sacrifice fly Thursday, leading Greg Mad­dux and the Chicago Cubs to a 6-2 victory over the Montreal Expos. 
That ended the Cubs' four­game losing streak and the Ex­pos' five-game winning streak. 
Law's homer, his second of the season, capped a three-run sixth and came off loser Bryn Smith, 0-1. Maddux, 3-1, gave up eight hits but was backed by four double plays. He walked three and struck out four. 
Reds 7, Giants 6 

Jeff Treadway tripled home Nick Esasky with none out in the 12th inning Thursday, giving the Cincinnati Reds a 7-6 victory over the San Francisco Giants. 
Esasky, who homered in the third, opened the 12th inning wjth a single off Joe Price, 0-1. 
Treadway, the next batter, lined a ball that caromed off the right field wall as Esasky scored easily. 
The Reds have played six extra-inning games out of 16, winning three. 
Astros 8, Braves 0 

Bob Knepper and Ernie 
Camacho combined on a six­
hitter and Denny Walling had 
three hits and drove in two runs 
Thursday night as the Houston 
Astros beat the Atlanta Braves 
8-0. 

The Braves, shut out by 
Houston's Mike Scott on Wed­
nesday night, have not scored 
in 19 innings. Atlanta has been 
shut out four times this season. 
Kopper, 2-0, gave up five hits 
in six innings. He struck out 
three and walked two. 
Camacho finished up for his 
first save. 

Alan Ashby hit a two-run 
double and Walling followed 
with an RBI single for a 3-0 lead 
in the fourth against Kevin Cof­
fman, 0-2. 

In a big move earlier this week, freshman Ricky Watters switched from tailback to flanker. Junior Mark Green, moved to flanker at the beginning of spring workouts, took over duties at the tall-

has worked with the second 
team for most of the spring, 
and is backed up by James Dil­

At split end for the Blue is another promising freshman, Pierre Martin, who turned in the most spectacular catch of the spring two weeks ago when he was knocked into an aerial somersault by a D'Juan Fran­cisco hit. Steve Alaniz and walk-on Patrick Fallon also will see time at split end for the Blue. 
Mike Brennan, a 6-5 junior. will play tight end for the Blue team. 
Offensive Line -This has been the trouble spot all spring for Holtz' squad, which lost four fifth-year seniors from last season. The defense took ad­Rausch (6-6, 244) and Joe Allen (6-5, 272) at tackle, Winston Sandri (6-4, 247) and Tim Grun­hard (6-3, 283) at guard and Mike Heldt (6-4, 265) snapping the ball. The reserves include Marty Lippincott, Chuck Kil­lian, Mike Harazin and Shawn Anderson. 
DEFENSE 
Defensive Line -The defen­
sive line has had less trouble 
than its offensive counterpart 
finding replacements for its 
graduating seniors, but there 
will be positions to be won once 
fall workouts begin. 

Returning starter Tom Gor­man (6-6, 258) lines up at one tackle on the Blue defense, while freshman George Mar­shall (6-3, 240), who has made some big plays this spring, starts at the other tackle spot. Fellow freshman Brian Shan­non, who sat out the fall season with a leg injury, backs up Marshall. Steve Roddy (6-2, 
237) fills the middle for the Blue, with Michael Crounse (6­2, 266) waiting in the wings. 
A pair of sophomores start at defensive tackle for the Gold. Bryan Flannery (6-3, 249) and Jeff Aim (6-6, 248) have been pleasant surprises this spring, and will be given an occasional breather tomorrow by Bob Dahl and Mike Callan. At noseguard is George Williams (6-4, 285), who played in seven games last season and will be an important factor on the Irish defense in 1988.

vantage of the inexperience up front on offense and dominated most of the spring scrim­mages. With an already inex­perienced line divided into two units for tomorrow's game, the quarterbacks might have to be extra alert. 
The starters on the Blue line include converted tight end Andy Heck (6-6, 246 pounds) and Dean Brown (6-2, 283) at tackle, Ted Healy (6-4, 263) and returning starter Jeff Pearson (6-2, 254) at guard and Tim Ryan (6-4, 240) at center. Also in the trenches for the Blue unit will be Dave Prinzivalli, Norm Balentine, Ryan Mihalko, Jim Kinsherf and Darryl Wodecki. 
The Gol<i starters are Peter 

Linebackers -Perhaps the most reliable position for the Irish is inside linebacker, where both 6-5 junior Wes Pritchett and sophomore Mike Stonebreaker will play for the Blue team. Pritchett and Stonebreaker are two of the top three inside backers entering the fall, and will be helped out by Greg Hudson. 
Junior Ned Bolcar led the Irish in tackles with 106 last season, and lines up with fresh­man Donn Grimm at inside linebacker for the Gold team. They will be replaced by Joe Farrell and Scott Bufton. 
The Blue team boasts return­defense this April. Starting at strong safety for the Blue is freshman Greg Davis. Round­ing out the Blue secondary are cornerback Jerry Bodine and safeties Doug DiOrio and Rich Earley. 
Junior strong safety George Streeter anchors the Gold de­fensive backfield, while con­verted split end Pat Terrell gets the starting nod at free safety. The cornerbacks will be speedy freshman Todd Lyght and junior Bob Satterfield. Reserves include safeties Marc Dobbins and David Jandric, and corners Dan McDevitt, Mike McLoone and Rick Pur­cell. 
Special Teams -All spots are up for grabs in the punting and placekicking departments, and Holtz will certainly be keeping his eye on how the kickers per­form tomorrow in a game sit­uation. 
Jim Sexton and Pete Hartweger will punt for the Blue, while Sean Connor will handle the punting chores for the Gold. 
Reggie Ho and David Neidell tee the ball up for the Blue squad, while Billy Hackett will try the field goals for the Gold team.
