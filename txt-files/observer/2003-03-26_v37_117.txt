Marine graduate injured in Iraq war 
By HELENA PAYNE 
Senior SL1ffWri1rr 
First Lieutenant Dustin Ferrell, a ;woo Notre Dame graduate and U.S. Marine, was recently 
inj tm\d in I r a q , according to rPporl<; from t h (' Associated Press and Fcrrell's rnolher-in­


law, who Ferrell writes for llrn Michigan City (Ind.) News­l)ispatch. 
Thr AP reported that Ferrell had to receive a field tracheoto­my after a Ilumvee accident that caused chest injuries and broken bones. The operation involves cutting a hole in the threat to allow air to pass through. 
"People that have tra­cheotomies, they survive," said Patti Null, a local charge nurse at Mr,morial Hospital of South Bend. 
As of Tuesday, it was reported that Ferrnll was recovering in an Air Force hospital near Frankfurt, Germany. 
Ferrell's mother-in-law, Deborah Scderberg, wrote about Ferrell Tuesday for the Michigan City paper, explaining how he was injured. 
"The details remain sketchy, but it looks as if Dustin and sev­eral other Marines were in an accident in a Humvee. A field tracheotomy by a Navy corpsman s,tved his life. His trachea had been crushed." Sederberg reported. 
Sederberg also wrote abom Ferrell's involvement at Notre Dame, where he was active in the Navy ROTC program, which had given him a scholarship. 
"Between his academic classes and his military obligation, he seemed to be running or study­ing nearly every minute of his four years at Notre Dame, on his way to a degree in business and a stint with the Marines," Sederberg said in the article. 

Some current Notre Dame Navy ROTC students who worked with him also referred to his leadership. 
"I remember him as being a great leader, and also, he had a great sense of humor," said senior John Seiter, who worked under rerrell when he held the position of public affairs officer in Navy ROTC. 
As public affairs officer, Ferrell edited the Navy newsletter. He also wrote a series of columns in The Observer that incited student reactions during his time as an assistant viewpoint editor. 
"They did elicit good dialogue," said former Observer managing editor and 2002 graduate Noreen Gillepsie, adding that. "He really wore the responsibility that they teach you in ROTC in office." 
Ferrell, an accounting major originally from California, was living in North Carolina with his wife, Rachel, a Saint Mary's graduate, before he was sent to the Middle East. The two were married in August at the Basilica. 
In the Air Force hospital, Sederberg reported that Ferrell has to use a ventilator to breathe.

Ralph Nader to speak on campus 
By JULIA MILLER-LEMON 
New, Wriccr 
Consumer advocate Halph Nader will address the Notre Damp community today at 3 µ.m. in thn Jordan Auditorium of' the M1\11doza College of' Business. 
Titled "Legislating Corporate Hhics," the talk is spon­sored by the Notre Dame Law School and is part of the business lec­turt~ series. 
Nader ran for presidr,nt in 2000 as a Green Party candi­date and has been a prominent figure in consumer issues. He founded organi­zations respon­plausibility of legislating ethics at the corporate level and the effect that such legislation would have on the business world. 


Nader has recently headed an effort to create a new organiza­tion to set standards for corpo­rate accountants. 
Lisa Casey, a Notre Dame law professor, said Nader will most likely address Wall Street scan­dals that have occurred over the past year and the need for legislation that will better pro­tect consumers and their inter­ests. Since the admission of false profits and the demise of Enron last year, the accounts of other major corporations have come under close scrutiny and more scandals have been revealed, leading many to ques­tion the integrity of corporate America.

College posts emergency plan 
By ANGELA SAOUD 
News Writer 
While the risk for terrorist attacks on schools is low, Saint Mary's is responding proactively by creating an Emergency Response Plan. 
.Rosemarie Harris, Saint Mary's Interim Director of Security, displayed the nine­page action plan Friday on the College's homepage. 
"I want to strongly empha­size that we have not received any notification thus far to implement the plan," Harris said. "However, we are responding proactive­Iv to the threat. This is sim­ply to make students aware of our heightened state of alert." 
The heightened security alert encourages students to 

increase awareness of their surroundings. Students are asked to watch for suspicious circumstances and report any behavior they find out of the ordinary. 
Harris said students should not be fearful, simply alert. 
The Emergency Response Plan would only be put into action under certain instances. These circum­stances include a red alert issued by the government or a biological or chemical attack. 
The plan suggests that stu­dents equip their rooms with supplies such as bottled water, non-perishable food items, first aid supplies, a radio and a flashlight. Students may want to pre­pare a kit that can be easily taken with them. 
If the plan is implemented, students will be notified through e-mail. telephone calls and personal contact. 
Upon receiving notification of a terrorist attack, students and staff should proceed to the basement of Regina Hall. preferably through the tun­nels running below the cam­pus. Signs have been placed directing students to appro­priate locations, where fur­ther instruction will be given upon arrival. 
Security suggests that stu­dents share this information with their families. They will set up additional phone lines for family members to call and receive news updates on the campus' condition.

Dancing

king 

Two days ago, a female finally spoke the words that I had been waiting to hear for some time: "You're a good lead." 
Wait. Let me explain. Her com­ments were not in the context of a Joe Trombello parietals violation or a role-playing

activity in a gen­
der studies class. 
Production 
You see. I am currently enrolled in Latin Dance as part of my physical education requirement, and in addition to performing the endless turns. twists and steps at a pace seemingly faster than the Concorde. I have the added respon­sibility of leading. 
Leading a dance means that the man must know the move that he and his partner will perform about 10 steps ahead of time. For someone who has difficulty remembering the clothes he wore two hours ago, this kind of foresight proves problematic. 
f'm really not equipped to deal with these kinds of decisions, and I often find that my brain is forced to work overtime, a risky proposition for any college student. 
Compounding matters. dancing and I have never been best friends. Suffice to say that Soul Train has not really come calling for an audition, and I haven't exactly been holding my breath either. I'm not sure how well they would respond to a person with two left feet and an uncanny ability for stepping on toes, tripping and face planting. Sometimes these mishaps occur simultaneously and they certainly would not win any style points with Sinbad. 
In spite of these adversities, I find myself really enjoying the class. The music is often energizing, my instructor is blessed with an inordi­nate amount of patience and I get the pleasure of meeting a different dance partner every class period. I'm now able to spice up SYR dances in ways that don't involve a large consumption of alcoholic beverages. As an added bonus, I get to use my hands in ways that would normally result in a prompt slap and a sexual harassment lawsuit. 
I also had to consider the alterna­tives: Volleyball (if only the net were lower), First Aid (Pamela Anderson and her Babewatch babes would not be present -what's the point then?) and Handball (non-existent hand­eye coordination would prove prob­lematic). Latin Dance really seemed the best option. 
Besides, there is hope for me in sight; I'm taking Ballroom Dancing next rotation. 
l figure I'll get the hang of this dancing thing eventually. Right?

Online service helps enforce Honor Code 
By CAITLIN EARLY 
News Writer 
After introducing a number of sweeping changes to the Honor Code at the beginning of this academic year, the University Honor Code Committee recently compiled a set of statistics to evaluate this year's Honor Code cases and violations. 
The statistics are represen­tative of all Honor Code cases heard from the beginning of the fall semester through Feb. 3, Some cases were also draw.n· from the 2002 spring semester. 
Across the University's vari­ous colleges, the College of Arts, which had 14 Honor Code violations brought before its Honesty Committee, far exceeded the number of cases in the College of Business and the College of Science. The College of Business had three violation cases and the College of Science had one. 
Of these 14 Honor Code 
cases in the College of Arts 
and Letters, 13 violations were 
related to Internet plagiarism. 
Professor Thomas Flint, fac­ulty Honor Code officer, said the statistics and the number of cases involving Internet pla­giarism did not surprise him. 
"With my involvement in the Philosophy Department, I have seen the whole issue of Internet plagiarism become more and more serious," said Flint. "A significant number of cases involve basically good people who made bad deci­sions because the Internet was just two clicks away." 
One of the most notable additions made to the Honor Code this year was the University's decision to con­tract the services of Turnitin.com, an online pla­giarism-detection company. 
Turnitin.com enables profes­sors and faculty members to submit a student's paper and to receive a set of "Originality Reports" within 24 hours, revealing if any Internet docu­ments or resources are used in the student's work. 
While the most contested aspect of the plagiarism-detec­tion company is the direct sub­mission of students' work without any prior indication of plagiarism, Flint said that only a few professors are currently submitting all students' papers to Turnitin.com. 
Turnitin.com was used to detect three of the 14 Internet-plagiarism violations in the College of Arts and Letters. 
Flint said that most profes­sors and faculty members use Turnitin.com in conjunction with various other search engines to detect student pla­giarism, 
To date, 63 Notre Dame fac­ulty members arc registered with Turnitin.com. In total. 535 students' papers and reports have been submitted to the service. 
The University has extended its contract with Turnitin.com for the next academic year. 
With the incidences of com­puter-related cheating on the rise across college campuses throughout the country, Flint said he realizes that there is no easy way to combat this widespread problem. 
"In the most idealistic sense, it should be the aim of every­one in the Notre Dame com­munity to pursue truth and goodness," Flint said. "Plagiarism cuts right at the heart of this idea by falsely presenting work which is not one's own. It goes against what we are and should be about at a Catholic universi­ty." 
A series of other changes made to the Honor Code in the past year involve the organiza tional structure of the Honor Code Committee and increased student involvement. 
Under the new provisions of the Honor Code, departmental honesty committees, which are now comprised of a majority of students, preside over Honor Code violation hearings. 
While the broad provisions set forth in the Honor Code Handbook guide the students serving on the honesty com­mittees, the committees ulti­mately determine the specific type of the penalty based on the nature of the offense. 
"The code is working very well procedurally. I have sat in on quite a number of hear­ings, and I am always impressed with the serious­ness with which the honesty committees are conducted," Flint said. 
While no new changes will be made to the Honor Code immediately, Flint cited that some additional issues, such as the implications of the honor code in study abroad programs. will be addressed in the years to come. 
"In respect to our Honor Code system at Notre Dame. I would say it is far preferable to what many other universi­ties have," Flint said. "There is no panacea for cheating or Internet-plagiarism because there will always be people who will take the short and easy way out, even at Notre Dame. 1 am hopeful that the Honor Code will encourage students to continue to remember what we're about as a University."

Doctor lectures on early childhood brain developn1ent 
By ANDREW THAGARD 
News Writer 

Pediatrician and author Patricia Keener spoke on the brain and its development dur­ing early childhood in Tuesday's presentation titled "Surviving the Wonder Years." The event was the second in the Mini-Medical School Lecture Series. 
Using a combination of slides, video clips and passing out copies of her reference book, "Caring for Kids," Keener focused on neural anatomy and how certain func­tions like language emerge in young children. 
"I think it's one of the most exciting fields in medicine," she said. 
According to Keener, collabo­ration among professionals involved in different aspects of neural development has recently revolutionized the understanding of brain struc­ture and function. 
"We have neurologists talk­ing to psychologists," she said. "There's a great sharing of information." 
Keener discussed the new­born's brain, a structure she said is only partially assembled at birth. 
"Brains aren't like comput­ers," she said. "[Infants] are not born hardwired. The vari­ous connections are wired after they're born." 
The majority of the synapses that link neural cells together form after birth and their development is based on the environment. According to Keener. newborns have approximately 50 trillion synapses. The number peaks a year later at 1,000 trillion and then drops to 500 trillion by age 20. This makes toddlers ideally suited to learn, she said. 
Caretakers need to be aware of this critical time and atten­tive to the child's emotional state, she said, adding that impersonal day care facilities can have adverse affects on a child's development. 
Keener warned against the temptation of replacing human contact with toys designed to provide human-like stimula­tion. She said that in 1997. only 10 percent of toys relied on electronics. By the year 2000, the pe rcentagc had jumped to 60. 
"I think it's a problem when parents are spending money on these things instead of a rock­ing chair," she said. 
Keener also focused on cer­tain behaviors and functions that are time sensitive, using vision and language as exam­ples. 
"Cataracts in a newborn are removed very early," she said. "If you don't take that cataract out early that child will not be able to make the connections in the visual cortex and will not see." 
Language, Keener said, is another function that 1'16qWres early exposure. At birth, new­borns have the potential to rec­ognize and differentiate between every sound or phoneme in every human lan­guage. Early in development, however, associations for cer­tain sounds are strengthened while the ability to distinguish between others is lost, as they are not reinforced. 
Keener also spoke of the uni­versality of "parentese," or baby talk, which leads parents to speak in a higher pitch, using shorter phrases and accentuating the vowels. This type of speech, she said, along with the babbling noises a baby makes, facilitates the success­ful development of language. 
Keener is a professor of clini­cal pediatrics and assistant director for Medical Service Learning at Indiana University School of Medicine. From 1989 to 1992 she served as medical director of the Indianapolis Campaign for Healthy Babies, a program that addressed infant mortality problems. 
The Mini-Medical School Lecture Series is presented by the South Bend Center for Medical Education and the Indiana University School of Medicine and is sponsored by the Medical Education Foundation. Next Tuesday, Michael Vasko will present a lecture titled "Pain: Why does it hurt?"

beyond hospitals, where dozens of health care workers became infected, into at least one workplace, to air trav­elers and some schools have been closed as a precaution. 
!long Kong officials said the nine tourists became sick after a mainland Chinese man with SARS infected them on a March 15 Air China flight to Beijing. · 
If SARS can be more easily spread through the air -rather than by close contact with infected people who cough or sneeze -it could force travel and other restrictions to contain the disease. 
"We would want to be sure .that it was people sitting next to that person and not the ventilation system In the air­plane which was spreading the disease," said Dr. David Heymann, head of com­municable diseases at WHO. "We have no evidence of the latter right now." 

For one thing, he said, health investi­gators have followed thousands of pas­sengers who flew with SARS-infected travelers and did not become sick. 
However, he said that if they find there are cases that did not involve close contact with someone sick or at high risk, "we will then be very con­cerned that this might have become air­borne." 
The airplane cases seem similar to how the disease got its start here ­from une hotel guest who spread it to six strangers staying on the same floor. One expert theorized it might have spread through the air-conditioning sys­tem. 
From the Hong Kong hotel, the exposed tourists took the disease to Singapore, Vietnam and Canada. 
The disease has spread most rapidly through Asian hospitals, some of which lacked the surgical masks and goggles needed to prevent catching the disease from patients. The WHO has been dis­tributing such equipment.

Feminism Symposium sholVs 'The Righteous Babes' 
By SARAH NESTOR 
Senior Scaff Writer 
Saint Mary's Third Wave Feminism Symposium held its third event Tuesday evening, showing the documentary film, "The Highteous Babes." 
The movie is a documentary by filmmaker Pratibha Parmar that focuses on female recording artists and how feminism has been incorporated into mainstream music. The film was released in 1998, and even though some of the artists are out­dated due to the continuingly changing nature of the music industry, it showcased such artists as Ani DiFranco, Tori Amos, Shirley Manson, Sinead O'Connor, Chrissie Hynde ("The Pretenders") and Queen Latifah. 
Through interviews with musicians, writers, profes­sors and journalists, the film explored how female record­ing artists are also feminists and express this through entertainment. The film states that these women "trash the idea that we are supposed to be sweet and kept backstage." 
The film also critiques the recording industry's recent use of selling "girl power," with such groups as "The Spice Girls." Artists such as DiFranco and O'Connor dis­miss "The Spice Girls" as having nothing to do with girl power. 
The critique of "The Spice Girls" led into a discussion after the film about feminism on Saint Mary's camp\is''in the music industry and whether pop icons, such as

WASHINGTON 

Federal officials are investigat­ing whether the smallpox vaccine contributed to the heart attack death of a Maryland woman and brought on heart problems in six others. 
The vaccination has never been associated with heart problems before, but health officials are now recommending that people with a history of heart trouble refrain from being vaccinated while authorities investigate a possible link. 
"It's a balance, and I think we want to err on the side of safety," Dr. Julie Gerberding, director of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, said Tuesday. 
Three of the seven people under investigation suffered heart attacks. including the Maryland woman who died, another woman who is now on life sup­port and a third woman who was hospitalized and released. All three were health care or public health workers in their 50s. 
Two other people developed angina, or chest pain. All five of these patients had 
risk factors for heart disease before the vaccination, such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension or use of tobacco, Gerberding said. 
The other two patients under investigation suffered from heart inflammation, which is not asso­ciated with those risk factors. 
Based on historic data, a small number of people who receive smallpox vaccinations will die and a few will develop life-threat­ening complications. 
Those complications have never included heart problems, but the data were gathered during a time when most people being vaccinat­ed were young children who were not likely to have heart trouble, Gerberding noted. 
"We acknowledge that we don't have a lot of epidemiological or scientific information about the relationship between vaccine and cardiac illness in persons who are older," she said. 
The CDC planned to gather car­diac experts on Wednesday to consider whether something in the vaccine might be triggering heart problems in people who already have risk factors. 
Health officials also plan to compare the rate of heart prob­lems in the pool of smallpox vac-

Fox News leading rival CNN 
. Fox bests one­time leader in war coverage 
Associated Press 
NEWYOHK 
Fox News Channel has outdrawn CNN in the rat­ings through the first five days of Lhe war, a further proof of Fox's audience appeal and a blow to CNN, which was hoping to revital­ize the reputation it built during the first Gulf War. 
Through Monday, Fox News Channel has averaged 4 million viewers each day to CNN's 3.57 million. Fox's audience was bigger when the war began March 19, and every day through Monday. according to Nielsen Media Research. 
While Fox has been the top-rated cable news chan­nel for more than a year, industry experts wondered whether that lead would hold during a big breaking news story. CNN overtook Fox, for example, on Feb. 1 when the space shuttle dis­integrated. 
Despite CNN's overwhelm­ing advantage in reporting manpower, more Americans -at least so far -want to watch the war unfold on Fox.

Stocks rise with prediction of victory 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 
Wall Street moved moderately high­er Tuesday as President Bush's pre­diction that U.S.-led forces will prevail in Iraq prompted investors to pick up bargains following Monday's steep decline. 
Analysts said investors seemed to take heart from a variety of develop­ments, including a somewhat positive consumer confidence report and reports of a civilian uprising in south­ern Iraq. Volume also was light, cre­ating sharper price swings. 
"We had a bunch of small stories that have added to the stronger-than­expected economic data which has helped stabilize the market." said Todd Clark, head of listed equity trad­ing at Wells Fargo Securities. 

"The market is sort of settling into a feeling of while war is going to take a while, we're back in control," he said. 
The Dow closed up 65.55, or 0.8 percent, at 8.280.23 after declining 307 points in the previous session on disappointment about war develop­ments over the weekend. Monday's loss was the largest one-day point drop since Sept. 3, 2002. 
Earlier Tuesday, blue-chip stocks had climbed as much as 123 points before losing some momentum after the Senate unexpectedly voted to cut Bush's proposed $726 billion tax cut in half. 
The broader market also finished higher. The Nasdaq composite index gained 21.23, or 1.6 percent, to 1,391.01, after Monday's loss of 52 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 10.51, or 1.2 percent, to 
874.74. having dropped 31 points on Monday. 
On Tuesday, U.S. and British forces slowly edged closer to the Iraqi capi­tal, hampered by swirling sand­storms. U.S. Air Force Gen. Richard Myers and British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the war would be a tough fight with likely difficult days ahead,

Jury deliberations begin in Tyson case 
Associated Press 
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. 

A federal jury began delib­erating Tuesday in the immi­grant-smuggling case against poultry giant Tyson Foods. 
A Tyson attorney said in closing statements that the nation's largest meat produc­er and three managers who are co-defendants tried to fol­low immigration law with a voluntary employment screening program endorsed by the government. 
Tom Green, an attorney for Springdale, Ark. -based Tyson, told jurors that immi­gration laws allow a company to hire a "refugee from the North Pole or the man from Mars" if the worker has iden­tity documents that look gen­uine. 
Earlier, Assistant U.S. Attorney John MacCoon said Tyson'.s top executives knew illegal workers were being hired at poultry plants in a corporate scheme to "keep the chickens moving, the profits flowing." 
"Headquarters had a mil­lion red flags that things were not right," MacCoon said. 
The federal jury began deliberating Tuesday after seven weeks of testimony, but adjourned a short time later. 
Since the case began, U.S. District Judge Allan Edgar has dismissed 24 of 36 charges stemming from a three-year undercover inves­tigation of Tyson. Remaining are charges of conspiracy, transporting illegal immi­grants and fraudulent docu­ments. 
Tyson and three of its man agers are accused of seeking illegal immigrants to boost production when they couldn't find Americans will­ing to work the $7-an-hour jobs. Executives testified the company does not encourage the hiring of illegal workers, and the managers who did so acted against corporat~ ooU; cies. 
Six managers were charged with Tyson in a December 2001 indictment. One fatally shot himself a few months later; two others made plea agreements in January and testified for the government. 
Robert Hash, 50, a regional vice president and the high­est-ranking current Tyson official on trial, faces seven charges, including two con­spiracy counts. 
A single conspiracy charge remains against plant manag­er Keith Snyder, 44. 
Gerald Lankford, 64, is accused of conspiring to vio­late immigration laws and obstruct their enforcement. 
The managers face jail time and fines if found guilty. If Tyson is found guilty, the company could face millions of dollars in fines. 
Air Force Acaden1y tnakes changes 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Four top officers at the Air Force Academy will be replaced -at least two of them by women -after a series of rape reports and allegations by female cadets of an academy culture that blames victims for assaults. 
"The evidence indicates now that we need to have some changes in leadership at the top," said Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo. "I think they're moving in the right direction." 
Air Force Secretary James Roche briefed the Senate Armed Services Committee in private Tuesday to discuss the military's response to allega­tions that female cadets at the academy were ostracized and reprimanded after they report­ed they were raped. 
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., said Roche told sena­tors that four leaders at the academy would he replaced and at least two women would be moved into top spots. She said the changes show progress, but more needs to be done. 
"We don't send [cadets to the academy] to become part of a fraternity where they defend one another and protect one another against criminal activi­ties that keep going on, so it's not just a change in leadership. It has to be a change in values from top to bottom," she said. 
The Air Force has identified 56 cases of rape or sexual assault reported at the Air Force Academy since 1993. Allard says 50 cases have been reported to his office. many by women upset with the way the academy handled their com­plaints and a significant portion occurring within the last two years. 

Roche would not answer questions as he !Aft the Capitol on Tuesday. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner. R-Va .. said per­sonnel changes would be made, but would not elaborate. 
A congressional source said the four who will be replaced are Brig. Gen. S. Taco Gilbert III, the commandant of cadets and second in charge at the academy; Col. Steve Eddy. vice superintendent; Col. Bob Eskridge, vice commander, and Col. Sue Slavec, training group commander and the highest­ranking woman at the acade­my. 
Lt. Gen. John R. Dallager is expected to remain as superin­tendent and the top official at the 4, 100-cadet institution until his scheduled retirement in June. 
Gilbert, who declined to com­ment, is scheduled to leave the academy this summer after completing a standard two­year tour. 
According to Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., other changes will include clustering together female cadets' dormitory rooms and providing round-the-clock security; training medical per­sonnel how to respond to sexu­al assault cases; giving amnesty to people raising allegations of sexual assault; allowing only juniors and seniors at the acad­emy to discipline freshmen; and expelling any cadet found to provide alcohol to an under­age cadet. 
The academy also will remove a prominent sign that says "Bring Me Men ... " from its spot near the campus court­yard and parade area. 
The Air Force scheduled a news conference on Wednesday to announce the changes. 
Allard said he also expects new directives affecting record­keeping and the way rapes and sexual assaults are reported at the academy north of Colorado Springs. Air Force officials were vague about the timetable for the changes. Allard said. 
Roche also met Tuesday with the Air Force chief of staff, the secretaries of the Navy and Army, the superintendents of the Naval Academy and West Point and other officials. 
"They discussed our agenda for change at the Air Force Academy and shared observa­tions for best practices on the service academies," said Lt. Col. Dewey Ford, a spokesman for the Air Force. 
Also on Tuesday, Rep. Grace Napolitano, D-Calif., Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., and 18 other female House members sent a letter to Roche seeking a meet­ing with the secretary and urg­ing the Air Force. to provide more support for victims of sexual assault and harsher sen­tences for the perpetrators.

NASA panel fears for crews 
. Safety panel wants ejection seats installed in shuttles 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON 

Unless NASA installs a crew ejection system in its space shut­tles, it can expect to lose at lel.l.5t one more astronaut crew before 2020, a safety panel told the space agency's top officials Tuesday. 
Sidney M. Gutierrez, a member of NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel who flew Columbia during a 1991 flight. said the agency's record of two shuttle disasters violates NASA's own safety margin requirements. The Feb. 1 Columbia accident rndur.ed safety margins two mag­nitudes below NA..'iA's minimums, he said. 
"Ifwe fly this vehicle until 2020, we can be assured we'll lose another vehicle and maybe two," he said. 
Gutierrez said upgrades to other parL-; of the complex shuttle program would not bring the spacecraft in line with those safety requirements. Only a crew ejec­tion systnm uffered that promise. 
"The gut fooling is, we're losing people too often in space," Gutierrez said. 
The safoty panel on Tuesday presented ilc; latest report, which covered the months immediately preceding the Columbia shuttle accident. The 106-page report noted that it was finished before the Feb. 1 accident and that no changes were made because of Columbia. 
The report also concluded that NASA should re-examine the way it certifies shuttles as safe to launch because of increasing problems discovered last year blamed on the shuttle fleet's age. But it concluded that safety for the shuttle program has been a prior­ity "first and foremost" at the agency. 
Gutierrez challenged NASA to conduct new studies for designs of crew ejection systems, which could include individual ejection pods for astronauts or a rein­forced, pressurized crew cabin designed to separate safely from a dis1.15ter. 
Gutierrez said the safety panel does not believe NASA must install crew ejection systems before the shuttle's next flight. 
NASA's associate administrator for safety, former astronaut Bryan O'Connor, said he was anxious to see studies on whether improved ejection systems can be installed on the shuttle. O'Connor, who was pilot on a 1985 flight of Atlantis and crew commander with Gutierrez aboard Columbia's mis­sion in June 1991, participates on the safety panel as an ex-officio member. 
NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe noted that the agency is developing an orbital space plane that can be used to fly astronauts to the International Space Station. Once that vehicle is flying, the shuttle could be used merely to haul cargo, O'Keefe said. 
Gutierrez said that deferring the ejection system until the space plane is flying was "not accept­able." 
The panel cited some minor problems during the five shuttle missions in 2002 that it blamed on the fleet's increasing age, It said cracks, leaks and other failures "provide evidence or this degrada­tion and indicate the need for re­evaluation of the certification cri­teria" for shuttle parts. 
The panel found that these flaws "escaped detection by stan­dard preflight tests and were found late in the launch process," causing launch delays. The failed systems had adequate backups, and "no significant safety impacts resulted from these events." 
The board investigating the Columbia accident already has indicated it is looking into whether Columbia's age played a role in the breakup. Admiral Harold Gehman, heading the investigation, declined to com­ment Tuesday on the safety panel's report, saying he had not yet read the findings. 
Columbia, the oldest of NASA's four shuttles, was built in the late 1970s and made its first flight in 1981. But O'Keefe noted at a con­gressional hearing last month that Columbia just underwent an 18­month structural inspection, and that it returned safely from one flight in 2002 since that review. 

Alleged al-Qaida 
trainee pleads guilty 
Associated Press 
BUFFALO, N.Y. 

An American of Yemeni descent pleaded guilty Monday to training in an al­Qaida camp in Afghanistan, becoming the third defen­dant to reach a deal with prosecutors in a case that sent shock waves through the Buffalo suburb where they live. 
Yahya Goba, 26, is one of six men charged with provid­ing support to Osama bin Laden's terrorist organiza­ti'l'J'I'li by training at the camp in spring 2001. 
The men. all in their 20s and American citizens of Yemeni descent. lived within blocks of one another in Lackawanna. 
Goba's plea agreement, in which he detailed his trip to Afghanistan, said four unidentified men 'helped steer him and his five co­defendants to Afghanistan. His plea deal was the first to mention the four unidentified men. 
He described two of the men as having recruited the Lackawanna group to pre­pare for jihad, or "prepara­tion for a possible battle against people not of the same faith," as prosecutor 
William Hochul described it. 
Federal prosecutors 

declined any further com­
ment on the unidentified 
men. 
Goba's plea came one day after co-defendant Shafal Mosed pleaded guilty to the same charge: providing material resources to a for­eign terrorist organization. A third suspect, Faysal Galab, pleaded guilty in January to a lesser charge of supporting al-Qaida. 
Prosecutors said they would seek a seven-year sen­tence for Galab, eight years for Mosed and the maximum 10 years for Goba, whom they believe to be one of the group's leaders. The original two-count indictment carries a maximum 15-year sen­tence. 
Prosecutors and defense attorneys said negotiations were continuing to reach plea agreements with the other defendants. 
Investigators will rely heavily on the defendants' cooperation, Hochul said. 
"Every time somebody has pied guilty, there are some additional details that can be brought to the table and can be followed up and pursued by the FBI and the Joint Terrorism Task Force," Hochul said.

Forgive and forget or forget forgiving? 
When it comes to cheating in a rela tionship. when should you forgive and forget and when should you forget for­giving? 
We all enter into relationships with varied expectations and project different levels of commit­ment to our signifi­cant others. For example, some cou­ples make the de~i­sion, mutually, to ~  become exclusive. Some relationships, however, are simply mutually exclusive. The larger question may be: In a world of break-ups, make­ups and random hook-ups, what even counts as cheating these days? 
Could it be simplified down to the num­bers and be directly proportional to the length of time you've been dating? For example, if two people have been dating for a month or so and then one of the parties get.s a little more than chemistry notes from their lab partner one night, is that considered cheating or simply dat­ing around? 
The line is blurred and the terms are vague. When exclusivity has never been discussed within a new relationship, we often consider it perfectly acceptable to test the waters or at least give others a watered down version of our relationship status with our current love interest. However, when a relationship hits that proverbial let's-talk-about-us stage, the boundaries are often set and the idea of cheating takes on a larger, more omi­nous implication. 
Cheating has always been a part of the dating scene. It's practically biblical­after all, the prophet Abraham had dozens of wives. Cheating is a notion that 
U.S. presidents have embraced, song­writers have put to music and the Academy has given Oscars to for best actor in their various philandering roles. 


However, though cheating may be bibli­cal, presidential and even cinematic, it's usually not quite forgivable. 
After all, can you really forgive some­one who has stolen your heart? 
The funny thing about cheating is that, in the real world, cheating and stealing are criminal offenses. When we cheat on a test, we fail the class, or at least are guaranteed a date with Bill Kirk. \Nhen we steal from a store, we suffer the con­sequences, ala Winona Ryder. However, when someone steals our hearts and then cheats on us, it is the cheated that often suffers the consequences. The cheater may be left feeling guilty, but the cheated is left hurt, confused and angry. 
Let's be hon­est. Cheating on someone isn't painful. Being cheated on is. Flirting isn't cheat­ing. Looking isn't cheat­ing. Admiring isn't cheat­ing. However, when the ante is upped and we begin to play for keeps in a relation­ship, the misdemeanors can add up. 
Yes, people do make mistakes in their relationship endeavors -ones that they can be very sorry for. And sometimes, depending on both the people and the specific relationship, cheating is forgiv­able -or at least correctable. After all, many relationships survive it, some are defined by it and some never encounter it. 
However, in any situation, it's still not considered the way to properly behave in a relationship. And the worst thing possi­ble L,; to try and downplay it. No matter what kind of spin we put on our actions -blaming it on the atmosphere, the attraction or even the Amstcl Llght ­rationalizing cheating by is really just adding insult to injury. 
That said, there very well could be a simple, quick solution to the problems we have with cheating -mainly as a means of deterrence. It's been said that in the old days, if a man were caught stealing, they would cut off his hand to make him pay for his crime. Now imag­ine what they would cut off if he were caught cheating on his wife. 
Just a thought. In a perfect world no one would cheat or be cheated on -nor would they even want to. We would be happy with our­selves and our rela­tionships and never 
be found wanting. However, we don't live in a perfect 
world and we're not a perfect peo­ple. We make mis­takes. We are for­
given for some of them. Others we are not. We simply have to learn from 
them and endure the consequences. With cheating, it's not 
easy to forgive and almost impossible to forget. As pro­portional the cheating scale is to 

time and commitment, it's not a mat­ter of numbers divided and offenses corr.­mitted. And no matter what the result, we always take it as an equation of the heart.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Look at history before making change 
This letter is written in response to the suggestion by junior class presi­dent Meghan O'Donnell that the Executive Cabinet should receive more power under the Constitution and that the Senate is not representa­tive of the opinions of the Student Body. 
I had the privilege to work on the original revision of the Constitution as a District Senator during the 1993-94 school year. At that tirne, the compo­sition of the Student Senate was very similar to the current composition of the Executive Cabinet. One of the rea­sons behind the change in the compo­sition of the Senate to its current form was to make it more representative of student opinions and a more effective advocate of those opinions. Moreover, there was a recognition that student government was responsible for both advocacy and programming, The cur­rent composition of the Senate and the Executive Cabinet is reflective of this division of duties. 

I do not wish this letter to discour­age Ms. O'Donnell or any interested student from trying to take a more active role in effecting positive change at Notre Dame. However, I encourage students to be aware of history before attempting to change the structure of the Student Government. Moreover, if someone truly feels that the Senate is not adequately representing student opinion, they should strongly consider running for a position on that body.

the war. 
It is imperative that everybody honor the women and men of our mili­tary. But as we continue to pray during the lighting in Iraq, we cannot neglect issues that trouble our economy. We cannot overlook the cosls this war bas on our nation and the questionable solutions put forth by the Bush admin­istration. 
There is little question that this war will financially cost our government a great deal. Laurence Lindsay, former economic advisor to President Bush, estimated that this war could cost up to $200 billion, not including reconstruc­tion. 
At the same time that these war costs grow, the strain on the national budget increases. Just recently, the Bush administration estimated a deficit of over $304 billion for the 2003 fiscal year. The national surplus has already fallen around $4 trillion, from over $5 trillion in 2001 to about $1 trillion in the 2003 fiscal year. On top of the depletion of the national surplus, the administration's proposed tax cuts are looking to cut $1.3 trillion between fis­cal years 2004 to 2013. With all the spending on the military combined with the lack of resources, funding for social programs will be cut or eliminat­ed. 
This means sharp cuts in Social Security, education, Medicare and other social programs, leaving millions of Americans helpless. According to the Economic Policy Institute. in 2001 an estimated 41. 2 million Americans did not have health insurance, meaning millions of citizens were, and still are, unable to afford doctors or necessary medicine or medical supplies. To com­pare the cost of the war with the prob­lem of the uninsured, the estimated $200 billion that will be spent on this war is enough to provide health care to 
. all uninsured children in the United States for the next 10 years. School systems and teachers will suf­fer as well. Teachers are one of the most valuable resources of our nation, with an average starting salary just under $29,000. Much research on classroom population has concluded that smaller classroom sizes are more conducive to learning. But in Indiana, 1,500 teachers were laid off for budget reasons. The American Federation of Teachers estimates that an additional two million qualified teachers must be hired to reduce classroom sizes. For 

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Concern for effects ofwar 
I am proud of my country. I am sad for what is about to come. My immigrant grandparents came to this country with the hope of a better life and love of what America stood for. As part of a generation that was torn apart over Vietnam, I am faced with a war that has long lasting consequences for my daughter's genera­tion. 
Just for the record. I do not make apologies for my country's economic and military leader­ship. We are a great nation, strengthened by our diversity and pursuit of our national destiny of personal, religious and economic freedom. 
President Bush came into office promising to be "a unitur not a divider," and he kept his word. Ile has united France, Germany, Russia and China (hardly historical friends) against us. Ile has demanded the leader of a nation to leave his country within 48 hours or face the consequences of war. 
I am not delusional about Saddam Hussein ­he is evil. The doctrine of "first strike" under these circumstances will echo for generations. I respect and admire our military. No one demonstrates a more basic love of our country then these outstanding men and women. Jlowever, 1 grieve at the prospect of the price they will pay. 
Our new doctrine of "first strike" is reason­able only if there is no alternative. Our presi­dent has failed the American ideal by pushing us into a conflict that we will win in the short term, but I fear history will judge us most harshly. 
Joseph A. Cari, Jr.

this to happen, Bush must take a 
stronger stance on education and pro­
vide the money necessary. 
While these programs suffer, Bush is pushing for more and more tax cuts. These attempts to stimulate the econo­my will in the end benefit nobody but the rich of our country. and fail to boost our economy. According to The Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy. the bottom 60 percent in our nation's income bracket, families earn­ing less than $46,000 per year, would receive on average a $1~1 tax cut. The top 10 percent, fq.milies earning more than $104,000, would receive on aver­age a $5,578 tax break. Tax cuts for this income bracket receive 60 percent of the total share in tax cuts. 
These tax cuts will not help those that really need the money. These tax cuts do not create jobs. They do not improve education. They do not help the uninsured afford medical care. lt seems as if Bush is not only attempting to fight a war in Iraq, but also a war against the poor and working America by cutting strained social programs and giving the rich major tax cuts. 
This "War against Labor" can be seen in the administration's active stance against workers' legal right to organize. On Jan. 9, the Bush adminis­tration, in their constant efforts to make our nation secure, revoked the right of baggage screeners at airports from unionizing by declaring that "col­lective bargaining conflicts with national security needs." On Jan. 30, collective bargaining was also revoked from 1,300 workers at the National Imagery and Mapping Agency. Adding to this, the 170,000 plus public service employees that work for the Homeland Security Department and the Justice Department have been stripped of their right to a union. 
Collective bargaining is one of the few ways in which workers can incor­porate democracy in the workplace through negotiating fair contracts that help determine wages. seniority, work­ing conditions and more. This is a right protected under the National Labor Relations Act of 1933. Labor is in no way a threat to national security. It is tragic that Bush ~ould use the rhetoric of fear and violence to advance a sys­tem of greed. 
As we think about the implications for this war, we cannot overlook what is happening here domestically. We cannot be fooled that the suffering of the working poor is for security rea­sons. We must pray for our troops, but we must also act here in our own coun­try.

Defending Velasquez and Azteca 
The Observer recently published an appeal from the Progressive Student Alliance and an editorial written by Paul Graham, both regarding a labor dispute at Azteca Foods in Chicago. Both the appeal and the editorial asked Arthur Velasquez, the owner of Azteca Foods and a distin­guished alumni of Notre Dame (class of 1960) to "negotiate a fair deal with his workers." 
From my per­spective, Mr. Velasquez and his negotiating team have acted fairly while the striking workers have resorted to unethical tactics to promote their side -and only their side -of the issue to the Notre Dame community and to the gener­al public. 
I have the good fortune to work at Azteca Foods in a sales manage­ment capacity and have been employed by the company for over 12 years. I came to Azteca after l5 years in the Mexican food and gro­cery industry. The reason I decided to accept Azteca's employment offer was the respect that I had for Mr. Velasquez, his father and his whole family due to their many acts of philanthropy and support of the Hispanic community in Chicago and 

at Notre Dame. My experience at Azteca has, if any­thing, only deep­ened my respect for the Velasquez family and for their 
community service efforts. The per­sonal nature of the attacks 

on Mr. Velasquez and the half truths and inaccuracies in the appeal and in Mr. Graham's edi­torial were disheart­ening to see in print and 
made me wonder about the journalistic principles espoused by the current Observer staff for allowing such articles to be pub­lished without further investigation. 
Plant employees of Azteca Foods earn wages at the very high end of the tortilla industry pay scale, enjoy benefits such as generous vacations (3 weeks plus on average), are given a health insurance package better than all others in the indus­try and recieve overtime pay in accordance with their current con­tract. Plant employees have enjoyed these benefits for many years. 
Most other tortilla manufacturers offer few if any of the above bene­fits. In addition, Mr. Velasquez was instrumental in helping many of the plant employees earn permanent resident status and eventually U.S. citizenship, dating from back when it was a standard industry practice to exploit undocumented workers and abandon them when immigra­tion authorities would crack down. Mr. Velasquez hired an attorney and paid all legal fees for the work­ers who filed for permanent resi­dency. 
A number of plant employees chose to go out on strike while a new contract was being negotiated. At no time were they prevented from returning; in fact, they were encouraged to return from the first day while the negotiations contin­ued. Five months now have passed, the new union has been unable to present a workable new proposal and now apparently out of despera­tion the union negotiators have begun a campaign to try to smear Mr. Velasquez's good name and rightly deserved high reputation in the Chicago and Notre Dame com­munities. Shame on those misguid­ed individuals. 
I agree with Mr. Graham that "the workers need our help;" they need our help, though, not to protest against Mr. Velasquez, but to realize that they have been mis­led by a small group of disgruntled employees and a union looking for notoriety.

NCAA BASKETBALL 
Teams not graduating athletes 
.------­

page 16 The Observer . SPORTS Wednesday, March 26, 2003 
. Ten of sixteen remaining teams under SO percent in recent years 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

For all the profits and fun of the men's NCAA basketball tournament, too many players wind up with nothing more than memories. 
A study released showed that 10 of the schools in this week's round of 16 have failed to graduate even half of their players in recent years.
-Black players are less likely than whites to finish their careers with degrees, accord­ing to the study of NCAA graduation rates. Butler posted the best num­bers and Oklahoma had the worst. They play each other Friday in the East Regional semifinals. Butler. a small private school in Indianapolis, gradu­ated 86 percent of its basket­ball players and all of its black players over a six-year period starting with the 1995­96 season. Oklahoma had a zero graduation rate, although the school chal­lenged the criteria as mislead­ing. A school is credited with graduating students within six years of their freshman year, and is not credited for trans­
fers or junior college players who may get their degrees. 
"Our graduation rate is 100 percent," Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson said. "That freshman class (1995-96) was Bobby Joe Evans and Michael Cotton, and they both gradu­ated -Bobby Joe from here and Michael from Boston College. 
"They can stereotype us all they want, but the bottom line is our kids are graduating." 
Calling the results "disturb­ing," the study by Richard Lapchick of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida found: 
. 
Five of the 16 teams had graduation rates a third to a half lower than the school's overall athletic graduation rates. 

. 
Six schools had gradua­tion rates for black basketball players a third to three-quar­ters lower than overall athlet­ic rates. 

. 
Only three schools ­Butler, Duke and Kansas ­graduated at least two-thirds of their black basketball play­ers, while just those and two others -Marquette and Notre Dame -graduated at least two-thirds of all basket­ball players. 

. 
Only six schools graduat­ed at least 50 percent of all basketball players, and seven graduated at least half of their black players. 


Men's basketball, where 57 
' 
percent of the players are black, has the worst gradua­tion rates of all college sports, Lapchick said, with 58 of the 328 Division I teams failing to graduate a single black player in six years. 
"It is a nightmare waiting to be fixed," said Lapchick. one of the nation's leading sports sociologists. 
The study lends support to NCAA president Myles Brand's drive to reward or punish schools by tying the number of scholarships to graduation rates. 
"It confirms what we've known for some time," Brand said. "It shows why we need to take steps in order to cor­rect the situation through a clear and fair policy of incen­tives and disincentives." 
Lapchick said schools would "do themselves an enormous favor" if they used the type of system Brand favors. 
"I think he's got a moment in time, where there have been enough scandals hap­pening, to try to mobilize col­lege presidents to say this is an embarrassment to us as a group. We have this window here, let's use it to do some­thing real. 
"The challenge is that there are going to be a lot of power­ful coaches who will argue that this would deny opportu­nities, particularly to African­American students who. wouldn't be able to come to their schools." 
NFL 

Officiating,changes made to postseason 
Associated Press 

PHOENIX 
The officiating gaffes in last January's playoffs have pro­duced a dramatic change in NFL policy. 
Postseason officials will now come from cohesive crews who spent the season together instead of those who were rated the highest at their positions. 
In other words, the difference between a team and a collection of all-stars. _~ 
"The commissioner said, 'We can't stay status quo,"' director of officiating Mike Pereira said Tuesday. "One way of doing it is to revamp the evaluation sys­tem." 
Under the new policy, the eight highest-rated crews will officiate the 11 playoff games, two fewer crews than in the past. The three that are rated at the top will do two games -a wild-card or divisional-round game, plus one of the divisional championship games or the Super Bowl. 
The result is that 56 of the 119 officials will work the play­offs instead of 70. 
In the past, crews were put together for the playoffs based on the ratings of each official. These all-star crews, though, sometimes lacked cohesion. 
"We have always hammered home the importance of being a 
I 
crew, of teamwork," Pereira said. "But the ultimate reward, the playoffs and Super Bowl, was individual. We think this system reinforces what we want to do." 
The change was motivated in large part by commissioner Paul Tagliabue's rare public criticism of the officiating. It came follow­ing San Francisco's 39-38 wild­card victory over the New York Giants. 
With six seconds left, the Giants lined up for the winning field-goal attempt. the snap was botched and holder Matt Allen threw a desperation pass down­field. The Giants were called for an illegal receiver downfield, but tapes showed the 49ers should also have been called for pass interference. 
That would have resulted in offsetting penalties and allowed New York a second shot at the winning field goal. The next day, Tagliabue issued his statement. 
The crew involved in that game was made up of officials from different crews and includ­ed two of the three second-year officials who received playoff assignments. Normally, first­and second-year officials do not make the playoffs. 
That policy will continue. First-and second-year officials on crews that qualify for the postseason will be replaced by veterans who score the highest at the various positions.

Associa1-,d Press 
CLEVEIAND 

LeBron James tore through another high school basketball season, leading his team to a 25-1 record and a third Ohio state Litle in !'our years. 
Now he's about to take on some players who arc a little closer to his exceptional talent level. 
James will be the marquee attraction at the McDonald's All-American lligh School Basketball Boys Game on Wednesday night. James, a 6­foot-8 senior from Akron St. Vincnnt-St. Mary lligh School in Akron. probably won't stand out the way he did during the Ohio Division fl season. when his games packed gymnasiums and drew national TV coverage. 
His fellow All-Americans· can't help but be somewhat in awe of him. though. 
"He's amazing," said J.R. Giddens of Oklahoma City. "This kid, he's really the real deal." 
Giddens went up against James in Monday night's slam dunk contest, which James won by soaring well above the rim for slams. Giddens. who is headed to Kansas, said he wants another shot at James in the McDonald's game. 
"Maybe I can guard him and he can guard me a possession," he said. "Evcrybo(!y's got to go after the top dog to try to take him down." 
.lames. who's expected to be the No. 1 player selected in this year's NBA draft, will be a heavy crowd favorite. The game is being played in the 20,562­seat Gund Arena, about 40 miles from Akron. His presence could help set an attendance record for the game, which was set last year with 16,505 at Madison Square Garden. 
James plays for the East team, and West coach Gary Ernst said his players are eager to match up with the superstar. 
"There's three or four kids who've already come up and said, 'Coach, I want to work against him,"' said Ernst, who is from Mesa, Ariz. "They want the chance to see how they stack up against him. That's pretty impressive to accept that kind of challenge." 
East coach Ron Hecklinski of Anderson, Ind., said he didn't design any special plays for James during the two days of practice. 

"He has a tendency to take over the game naturally," Hecklinski said. "l don't think you have to run a lot of sets for him." 
James, who has been named the McDonald's National Player of the Year, said he doesn't feel any pressure to impress. 
'Tm just going to go out there and p!ay my game," he said. "I think I'll put on a good enough show for the people that have paid their money to come and watch us play." 
The McDonald's All-American staff limited reporters to ques­tions about the game during a 10-minute news conference Tuesday with James. That request was made by James' family. 
A McDonald's staff member wouldn't let James answer a reporter's question about whether he felt he needed to impress NBA scouts in the game. 
Cameras snapped before the news conference as Jamcs ate lunch with players from the McDonald's girls' team. James joked, "What do I look like?" when one of them asked him to get up and grab some drinks off a nearby beverage table. He returned smiling with a couple of sports drinks. 
"He's cool," said Ivory Latta. winner of the girls' 3-point

SURPRISE, Ariz. 
Rangers shortstop Alex Rodriguez went 2-for-8 with a homer and handled four fielding chances cleanly in a minor-league game Tuesday, his first game since being diagnosed with a herniated disc in his neck nearly two weeks ago. 
Rodriguez batted once an inning and played seven innings in the field for Triple-A Oklahoma against Portland, San Diego's Triple-A team. Rodriguez said he felt fine after he was done, and would be ready for the season opener Sunday night at Anaheim. 

'Tm right on schedule," Rodriguez said. "My timing was a little off, but it was really good to get out there. I got in eight solid at-bats. It was good to be able to see some live pitching." 
In addition to his two-run homer. Rodriguez had a sin­gle and drove in two other runs. He struck out just once. All of the fielding chances were routine plays. 
"I was so happy to be out on the field. I felt like I got stronger as I went along. I was a little unsure at first, but it got easier," he said. "If this had been opening day, I would have been ready to play. This has been really tough for me. I have to keep telling myself not to do .too much." 
Rodriguez, baseball's highest-paid player, has played in all 324 games the past two seasons in Texas since signing his record $252 million, 10-year con­tract. 
The Rangers weren't sure what the next step would be, and whether Rodriguez would play in another game Wednesday. If he does play, it was unclear if he would play in another minor­league game or with the major-league squad. 
After Tuesday's game, Rodriguez spent about an hour in the batting cage and then about 40 minutes in the training room getting treat­ment on his shoulder. 
"I didn't see this game as a test," he said. "It was more of a benchmark of where I am and what I still need to do. I'm feeling good." 
Rodriguez hasn't played a major league spring game since March 12, after he experienced fatigue and stiffness in his left shoulder following two straight games. The five-time All­Star and AL home run leader the past two seasons returned to Dallas for tests that revealed a small herni­ated disk in his desk. 
He resumed limited work­outs March 17 after rejoin­ing the team in Arizona.

Despite a number of' valiant trim; to catch the Buckeyes, the Irish l'Pll just short or a ranked fon for the second straight game. 
"I think WC kept kind or push­ing it," Irish coach Tracy Coyne said. "We had our chances, the goalie made some good saves and that's just the way it goes sometimes." 
After the early delicit, the Irish came back to within one goal on three different occasions, the last of which came in the middle of the second half when a goal from Anne Riley pulled the Irish with­in 9-8. Consecutive goals from the Buckeyes pushed the lead back to three at 1l-8 with only a few minutes remaining. 
"There were a lot of aspects of our game that I was pleased with," Coyne said. "It's just a matter of putting it together for 60 minutes. We had spurt<; today where we played very well. It's jusl a matter of starting out strong and maintaining." 
Ohio State was led by sopho­more midfielder Regina Oliver, who scored four first half goals to push the Buckeyes out to the early lead. 
"Regina .is a very good player, she's very athletic and has very good speed and quickness," Coyne said. "I think we did a bet­ter job in the second half of con­taining her, but a player like Regina is difficult to completely shut down." 

The Irish offensive effort was paced by senior Danielle Shearer who registered two goals and an assist, while junior Lauren Fischer added two first half goals. 
After being down 3-0 after six minutes, the Irish responded with two goals to cut the deficit to 3-2. Ohio State pushed the lead back to 7 -4 on Oliver's third goal of the first half. before Shearer and Meredith Simon scored to get the Irish within one at 7-6. Oliver's fourth score put Ohio State up by two at the break at 8-6. 
The Irish now have three con­secutive Big East showdowns beginning with trips to Virginia Tech (1-7) and No. 8 Syracuse before coming home to face Connecticut.

"In the pickup games, that matchup was intense," Brey said. "They are great friends, but they arc the kind of guys Lhat when they are between the lines they want to tear each other's heart out." 
Thomas said that when his Pike High School team played Gardner's North Central squad, Thomas' team emerged with a 3-1 record. And while the Irish point guard isn't one to focus on individual matchups -"It hurts the team," he simply said -the spotlight will shine brightly on both players Thursday. 
Gardner enters Thursdav·s clash averaging 14.3 points and just under five assists per game. One of many seniors on a veter­an Wildcat team, Gardner passed up the opportunity to turn pro a season ago for the chance to win a national title with Arizona. 
ln some ways, he represents the kind of point guard Thomas could become in a few years. 
"He's been to the Final Four. He's been to the championship game. He's played against the Lop players," Thomas said. "He's a leader and a captain, and is what makes that team go." 
The same could be said about Thomas for the Irish. Often the sparkplug for Notre Dame's offense, Notre Dame tends to win when Thomas plays well and lose when Thomas plays poorly. 

Cognizant of that fact, Brey spent much of the time before the NCAA Tournament challeng­ing Thomas to work on manag­
ing the game. Whatever Brey said paid off tremendously in Notre Dame's first Tournament games. 
Against Wisconsin­Milwaukee's full-court press. Thomas played all 40 minutes and committed just five turnovers. But he was even bet­ter in Notre Dame's 68-60 win against Illinois. 
In the first half, when the Irish seemingly couldn't miss from 3­point range, Thomas was instru­mental in pushing the ball up the court quickly. But when the Irish had trouble getting points in the beginning of the second half, Thomas settled the Irish down into more of a half-court offense. And in the final minutes of Saturday's game, the Irish often let the shot clock wind down to under five seconds thanks in part to Thomas' role in controlling the tern po of play. 
"As I've always said, he's a work in progress as a point guard and is learning," Brey said. "But I thought he was 
great in Indy." 

Thomas, whose happy-go­lucky personality disappeared as Notre Dame struggled down the stretch, seems to be in a much more jovial mood in the NCAA Tournament. Ile orchestrated Notre Dame's mass head-shav­ing -even saying Monday he mighL have to bring out the clip­pers again -and is back to cracking the occasional joke in press conferences. 
When Notre Oame got off the bus Saturday, the players got to watch the last few minutes of' the Arizona-Gonzaga double­overtime game. And as Thomas watched, he knew what team he wanted to win. 

"I was hoping in the back of my mind that we would gel Arizona," he said. "That would be my only chance to play against Gardner and it would be a great step for this program."

No problems in beginning the home season this year 

By MATT LOZAR 
Associate Spom Editor 
Last year, the Irish played their first home game 12 days after their home opener was ini­tially scheduled. 
This year, there will be no wait. 
With today's forecast calling for mostly sunny skies and a high of 54 degrees, Notre Dame will begin its home campaign against No. 24 Northwestern this afternoon at Ivy Field at 3 p.rn. 
"We are very excited. At this point of the season, just getting games in is what we want since we have missed eight already," Notre Dame coach Deanna Gumpf said. ult is exciting to be looking outside and seeing the sun." 
Just like any team, the bene­fits to playing at home are the same in softball.

"There is nothing like playing at home," Gumpf said. "You arc comfortable, people are in the stands cheering for you and we get to sleep in our own beds afterwards." 
In the 2002 season, the Irish were 18-2 at home and had a home winning streak of 26 games snapped against Syracuse in April. 
So far this year, the Irish arc 10-9 and the comparisons to last year's 8-12 start have started. In 2002, the Irish won 36 of 41 games to end their season and finished one game short of the College World Series, losing to Nebraska in the regionals. 
"It is very similar, I just hope the finish is similar. If we can just win one more game at regionals, that's our goal," Gumpf said. "Starting the way we started isn't what we want­ed. These girls know they can still do it. The start of our season was spring training and we need to learn from it." 
Notre Dame started the regu­lar season portion of its schedule last weekend in sweeping a dou­bleheader at Western Michigan. In that game, the Irish came out and scored five runs in the first inning of game one and five runs in the first three innings of game two. Taking control of the game early, as they did last weekend, needs to happen today against the Wildcats. 
"We need to hit the ball. If we hit the ball well. that takes them out of their comfort zone," Gumpf said. "If we score in the first inning, that changes momentum like we did when we scored in the first two innings at Western Michigan." 

Northwestern (13-6) and Notre Dame haven't played since the 1997 season. Its top win this season came Feb. 28 when Northwestern defeated defend­ing national champion California 4-3 in eight innings. 
To stay with the higher­ranked opponent this afternoon, the Irish need to take care of the basics. 

"They are very aggressive, very well-coached, very disci­plined and do the little things well," Gumpf said. "Our pitchers need to be in control for seven innings and we need to play strong defense. If we play well in those three areas, then we should have a good chance at winning the game."

. Severe scores 1 7 on way to Irish upset of No. 3 seed Wildcats 
By KATIE McVOY Senior Scaff Wricer 
The few hundred Notre Dame fans in Manhattan. Kan. Tuesday night were making more noise than nearly 12,000 Kansas State fans. Due to another out­standing Irish defensive effort, the Wildcats' 22-game home win streak broke right along with the Wildcats' tournament dreams. 
The final No. 3 seed in the NCAA tour­nament fell Tuesday night and No. 11 seed Notre Dame kept its NCAi\ dreams alive, upsetting Kansas State 59-53 on the way to the Sweet Sixteen. 
"We knew that we were better than an 11 seed but we must not have shown the selection committee that during the year so we're showing that now," Severe said. "We're reaching our poten­tial now." 
In the final minutes of the game, Kansas State just couldn't collect the points it needed. Whenever the Wildcats brought the game within two. they would foul the Irish. With Megan Duffy and Courtney LaVere perfect from the charity stripe in the final minute, the Wildcats could not bring the game with­in one possession when they controlled the ball.

Severe upset 
win streak the Wildcats had heading into Tuesday night's game. In a similar fashion in the win against Arizona on Sunday, the Irish forced a messy offen­sive game and let their defense do the talking. 
A Kansas State team that averages more than 75 point.5 a game scored only 53. 
"We knew we had to get up on the shooters, especially Koehn because she can hit it way out," Severe said. "We knew what we had to do and we knew we could do it." 
The "Big Four" -Kansas State's Kendra Wecker, Nicole Wecker, Megan Mahoney and Laurie Koehn -were the only Wildcats who could score points, grabbing all 53 of Kansas State's points. Despite the fact that the Irish could not control Koehn outside the arc as she went on to 23 points, no other Wildcat hit a single trey. 
Offensively, Notre Dame again showed that when it counted, someone would step up and get the work done. Notre Dame's leading scorer, Jacqueline Batteast, fell short again offensively, hitting only one of 10 shots, raising her total for the NCAA tourna­ment to 2-of-26 from the field. 
But where Batteast fell short, her teammates stepped up. Severe, the junior guard, took a role she usually doesn't take for the Irish -she scored and scored and scored. Severe, who usually dishes the ball to teammates and often grabs more assists than

Doherty impresses in opener 
By BRYAN KRONK Senior SraffWricer 
A new season at Eck Stadium began with a new face on the mound performing the same old dominating rou­tine for Notre Dame. as fresh­man Ryan Doherty hurled his way to a win in his first career start in the 8-3 Irish win over Toledo in the home opener for the Irish Tuesday night. 
"I was really happy for Ryan, his first career start, and he pitched real well out there," Notre Dame coach Paul Mainieri said. 
The homecoming was a wel­come sight for the Irish. who returned home after an 11-6 record in a month's worth of road games. 
"It was a lot of fun being out there tonight," Mainieri said. "After 17 games on the road, our guys were so excited about being back on our home turf. 
You could see there was a little extra bounce in their step, and they were genuinely excited about playing." 
An opening day crowd of over 1,400 witnessed the victo­ry for the Irish. which saw the home team start the game with a familiar sight -an early run. 
Leadoff hitter Steve Sollmann popped a double down the right-field line that was just out of reach of a charging Toledo fielder. After freshman Brennan Grogan sacrificed Sollmann to third and Matt Edwards walked on four pitches, senior Kris Billmaier hit a sacrifice fly to get the Irish on the board first. 
While the Irish would take advantage of shaky Toledo pitching all night, the Rockets were held stagnant by Dohertv, who struck out six of the firs·t eight batters he faced. 
"[My performance) was good," Doherty said. "We just came off a real good weekend at Villanova. so it was just my job to get a good start in there." 
Doherty was poised to retire the side in order for the third straight inning in the top of the third, until an error by short­stop Matt Macri extended the inning for Toledo. After allow­ing a single, Doherty walked the bases loaded before allow­ing a two-run single to give the Rockets a 2-1 lead. 
Doherty was able to recover, striking out one more Rocket batter to close out the top of the third. . 
Notre Dame capitalized on another poor outing by Toledo starter Brian Kovacs. Once again, it was the junior captain Sollmann who started the rally, this time by reaching base on a perfectly executed bunt down the third-base line to lead off the bottom of the

Old friends Thotnas and Gardner to meet 
. Irish point guard impresses coach with his improved control of tempo 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Spores Writer 

They first met on an Indianapolis basketball court. One was two years older than the other, but that didn't stop them from becoming fast friends even as they clashed at rival Indiana high schools. 
One won Mr. Basketball hon­
ors and headed to Arizona. Two 
years later, the other one won 
Mr. Basketball honors and 
headed to Notre Dame. 

They played often in the sum­mer and worked out together. And last July, both served as counselors at Nike's basketball 
camp. But little did Jason Gardner 
and Chris Thomas know that when they met for the first time in college, the loser would be heading home for the season. 
"We always played in the 
same leagues growing up, and 
we played on the same team 
[when I was in] seventh grade," 
Thomas said, jokingly adding of 
the 5-foot-10 guard, "I think he 
was the same size as he is now." 
Gardner and Thomas, two of 
the nation's top point guards 
and two close friends, will clash 
Thursday when fifth-seeded 
Notre Dame takes on top-seeded 
Arizona in the West Regional 
semifinal. 
But all Irish coach Mike Brey can think back to is when the two played each other at the Nike camp in July.
