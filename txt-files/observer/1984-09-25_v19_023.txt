Rowley widow files for bankruptcy 
By MARGARET FOSMOE 

StaffReporter 
Corby Tavern and other assets of C.T.l., Inc., were ffied under Chapter I I of the Indiana state bankruptcy code Friday, by Rose Rowley, acting president of C.T.l. 
The action will allow C.T.l. time to develop a plan for repayment of debts, according to Joseph Bradley, the attorney representing the corpo­ration in the bankruptcy action. 
The action came one day after the bar reopened following payment of nearly $13,000 in back taxes. The operation of the bar has not and will not be affected by the bankruptcy action, said Bradley. 
Filing for bankruptcy means "all debts owed (by the corporation) as of Friday are frozen and will be paid at a later date," said Bradley. 
Filing for bankruptcy prevents creditors from taking action against 
C.T.l. until a repayment plan is sub­mitted, he said. 
The action also prevents the In· diana Alcoholic Beverage Commission from revoking Corby's liquor Uscense, he said. Friday the 
A.B.C. attempted to revoke the bar's liscense but was halted by the bank· ruptcy action. 
Creditors have filed petitions totalling more than S25,000 against the estate of Harold Rowley Jr., the owner of the corporation who was murdered in his home Aug. I. 
Flllng for bankruptcy "gives the corporation a little amount of time to submit a reorganization plan which we think is practical," said Bradley. He estimates such a plan will take six months to a year to develop. 
"This was the best way to protect the only real asset of C.T.I., which is Corby's," he said. 
Sex discrimination plays a part in Notre Dame admissions 
Editor's Note: This Is part two of afive-part seriesfocusing on the issue of sex discrimination at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. Today's article studies the issue of academics; tomorrow's wtll look at another side of the uni­llersity experience, social life. 
By KEI111 HARRISONJr. 
Copy Editor 
Notre Dame ha..o; been a co· educational institution for more than 12 years, but questions con· cerning the admission of women still remain. Possibly the most Im­portant is: Does Notre Dame practice sex discrimination In its admissions policies? 
"I think you could use the term (sex discrimination), but what you have to understand is it's le,!(ally permissible," said Assis­tant Provost Sister John Miriam Jones. 
Jones was referring to Title IX of the Education Amendments. Although it makes sex discrimi­nation in admissions policies ille­gal, Title IX also states, "the admissions policies ofprivate un­dergraduate institutions are ex­empt." 
"So we are not discriminating according to the law...that's really splitting hairs, but that's what the lawyers tell us," Jones said. 
Presently, Notre Dame's un­dergraduate population is "roughly 72 percent male and 28 percent female," said Admissions Director Kevin Rooney. However, "there would be no problem finding qualified wo­men up to 35 or 36 percent ofthe class" from applications received each year, Rooney said. 
Each year the Admissions Of­fice is instructed to enroll a cer­tain number of men and women. 
For the 1984-85 school year, 
I300 men and 500 women were 
the chosen e~ollmem numbers. 
"So you have the men compet­ing among themselves...and the women competing among them· selves," Rooney said. "I can say 
9 d 

Sex Discrimination 
we are denying admission to some women with strong credentials." 
"We're considering the whole community, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's," said University President Father Theodore Hes­burgh. "When you consider the students from Saint Mary's, the male/female ratio is around 60­40." 

"Indeed we are a single col· legiate community by history and tradition and a lot of activi· ties," Jones said. She cited social events, volunteer services and the co-exchange program as ex­amples. 
"On the other hand...we're really two separate institutions," )ones said. "My concern is more the fact of what limiting admis­sions does to the women that we don't admit, and that within our own community (Notre Dame) the women are still a little less than a third (of the population)." 
One reason Notre Dame does not have an equal number ofmen and women is that it might reduce the number of applicants to Saint Mary's. "We would never want to do something unilater· ally at Notre Dame that would harm Saint Mary's," jones said. "The question in my mind Is can we admit more women to Notre Dame without creating that harm." 
"I think we can. I think we probably need to admit a bit greater percentage ofthe women applicants than we do now," she said. 
Various plans for admitting more women are being drawn up. According to Hesburgh, part of the money from the next Uni­versity fund raising drive will build two new dorms (one male, one female). 
"Included in that in some way is an Increased proportion ofwo· men," Jones said. "How, I don't know." However, several plans for increasing the female percentage without increasing the undergraduate population are being seriously considered, according to Jones.

so important to the financial well-being ofthis esteemed institution. 
Perhaps the administration expects us to learn drink· ing habits by example · good or bad. 
Now, I'm not passing judgment on the alcohol policy itself. I think the entire student body has already done that. My complaint concerns the administration's ap­parent double standard -the image they present to visitors (alumni) on a football weekend, and the atti­tude they take the rest ofthe time. 
Can the University condone drinking on football weekends and still justify its actions on behalf of the student body? What are we supposed to think? Or are we supposed to think? You can't train a puppy to do a trick by inconsistently applying rewards and punish­ment. It gets confused, and it won't learn anything. likewise, the administration, with its opinion ofour in­ability to think for ourselves, won't be able to mold us into its perception of responsible adults by changing the rules.

Notre Dame's first real home game has come and gone, and with it, the first test of the administration's new attitude toward student drinking. 
When hundreds ofalumni invaded Green Field -their cars loaded with beer, wine, and other forbidden pleasures -the famed alcohol policy with its ban on stu­dent drinking just seemed to fade into the background. 
The new alcohol regulations ban students from or­ganizing pre-game tailgaters. "No student, student organization, or residence hall may organize or sponsor 'tailgaters' on campus or on adjacent fields or parking lots at any time for the purpose of serving alcoholic beverages," the policy reads. 
But how much effect did the moratorium on student tailgaters have on the weekend's activities? Practically none. Sure, there were fewer student-sponsored tail­gaters, but nobody who really looked had any trouble finding one. While students couldn't sponsor tailgaters themselves, there was nothing stopping them from recruiting alumni, friends, or relatives to organize the festivities. 
Nobody (specifically the administration) seemed too concerned students were drinking out on Green Field. 
The question immedi­ately comes to mind, "What prompted the administra­tion to soften its hard-line approach to student drink· ing this past weekend?" The answer seems apparent. 
Alumni. 

Policy or not, it doesn't seem likely that handing out fines to every minor caught holding a beer would leave a

Systems Mana 

Father Tyson, please explain to me why it's OK to drink out in the open when people from all around the country are here to watch me, but I can't carry a two beers across campus to share with a friend in the privacy of my room. 
Why is it.necessary for me to be a fine, upstanding pillar ofthe Notre Dame community seven days a week, ifI'm going to come back as an alumnus and have a male stripper dance on the top of my RV? 
I'm not so naive as to think the administration ap­proves of student drinking during football weekends, but I would like to know why it doesn't do anything about it. On the other hand, I won't even try to guess what it thinks about alumni drink­ing. 
Is the administration worried about what the alumni will think if it fines every minor caught holding a beer on Green Field? It didn't care too much about what we thought. But then, our $9,000-a-year contribu· tions aren't voluntary. 
I'm confused.

Observer endorsement reviewed before senate 
By MIKE MILLEN 
StaffReporter 
The Observer stated its offical election endorsement policy at last night's Student Senate meeting. 
In response to last week's debate regarding the merits ofObsen'er en­dorsemt·nt of student body tickets, Obsener representatives Bob Von­derheide, editor-in-chief, and Mark Wors<:heh, managing editor, ex­plained their positions. 
"We do endorse tickets for stu­dent body president and vice presidt·nt at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's," Vonderheide said. 
About the possibility raised at last week's senate meeting of endorsed candidates being fined, he responded, "We would endorse can­didates even if Obud penalized them." 
Judicial Board Chairman Joe Zahn asked about candidates who may not want an Observer endorsement. Vonderhide responded, "we would find out everything we could about him," and then cun.~ider endorsing him. 
Senator Javier Oliva was unsure as to why Tbe Observer was concerned with endorsements, asking "why is it so important?" Wurscheh ex­plained,"it Is our opinion that It (the newspaper) has been looking at the issues throughout the year, and we feel qualified to make a choice." 
Vonderheide does nut believe that an Observer endorsement would give a candidate an unfair ad­vantage. "We have no more ofan ad­
vantage  than  the  South  Bend  
Tribune  dues In en dorsing  candi­ 
dates."  

Coordinator Alison Yurko saw no harm In the endorsements, pointing out, "lf the student body starts tel­ling the Observer what they can and can't print, why couldn't the admin­Istration do the same?" 
No further action was taken on the is.~ue. 

Student Body President Rob Ber­
tino announced a "practice trustee's 
meeting" on November 5th. Pos­
sibly taking place in the Center for 
Continuing Education, the meeting 
will be open to students. Bertino 
said the agenda includes looking at 
the woman's role at Notre Dame, 
senior townhouses. and an update 
on the social situation. He hopes this 
"mock" meeting will clarify the 
views presented on behalf of stu­
dents at the forthcoming Board of 
Trustee's meeting. 

A resolution introduced by Senator Pat Browne to encourage professors to lower class book costs unanimously passed. "First, Browne said, "lower the turnover rate." 
He admitted it might be impracti­cal "for science and engineering classes, because of advances in tech­nology," but "it might be feasible for introductory classes." 
Browne would like to see a limit of about $35 for Arts and Letters courses and S40 fur science and en­

Addressing Cuomo, Hyde said it doesn't make sense to state an abor­tion takes a life and it should be allowed. 
He added, "It has been said here at Notre Dame recently that Catholics in their own belief and behavior dont't differ significantly from the rest of the population on the issue of legal abortion. I hope that isn't quite true." 
Towards the end of his speech, which lasted nearly one hour, Hyde said, "Nearly two weeks ago on this campus the Governor proposed a hypothetical, 'Put aside what God expects -assume if you like there is no God -then the g.reatest thing still left to us is life'," he said.

Student views sought 
ByANNE GALLAGHER 
StaffReporter 
Surveys concerning parietal changes, room-pick proceedure, and the alcohol policy were dis­cussed at the Saint Mary's Board of Governance meeting last night. 
Anne Marie Kollman, vice presi­dent for student affairs, announced the surveys would be circulated by R.A.'s in order to obtain student opinion on these issues. 
Questions deal with the increase ofparietal hours, computerizing the room lottery, and upgrading student perception ofalcohol use. 
"I have talked with Pat Rissmeyer (director of residence life) about it and I am really excited," Kollman said. "The information gained could change things in the long run." 
Changes could also be in the making for students participating in student government. Mary Anne O'Donnell, director ofstudent activ­ities, suggested a leadership course become mandatory. O'Donnell rec­ommended a seminar-style course be designed similar to a leadership course already offered in the busi­ness department. She noted most colleges already require such a course for their student government representatives. 

The board's reaction was mixed. "It seems wrong to put a require­ment on something done purely voluntarily," said Lee Ann Franks, student body president. Yet Kacey Horner, public relations commis­sioner, thought the class would be beneficial. "It puts potential candi­dates in a long term frame of mind concerning student government." 
Dorie Murray, parietals commis­sioner, also discussed student atti­tudes concerning theJudicial Board. She stated the goal for the year will be to change students' perception of the board, and let them know who is on the board. "Students don't seem to realize that they can appeal a sanc­tion held against them. We are set up as a council to help students." 
Before closing the meeting, Kol­lman and Franks urged board mem­bers to get involved with the upcoming Alcohol Awareness week, Oct. I-7. Both stressed the im­portance of attending the weekday films and evening lectures. Because of low attendence at last Saturday night's coffeehouse in Haggar, Franks advocated increased aware­ness and participation for the Octo­ber 2 Video Showcase in the Haggar College Center. 

Job rush 
Potential job applicants bang from an over­loaded pick-up truck in San Pedro, California, Sunday as they reach for the applications for 350 high-paying longshoreman and marine clerk openings. An estimated 50,000 people waitedfor two daysfor the350 applications.

continued/rampage 1 
Notre Dame and its single sex dorms, jncreases in the number of women do not occur continually, explained Jones. "It's not that we're sitting back smugly and saying 'listen, we have a legal exemption here, so not to worry'.'' 
Some students suggest converting a male dorm or introducing co-ed dorms in order to increase the num­ber of women on campus. Convert­ing a male dorm is "always an option," said Hesburgh. But this has not been very popular with men in the past, according to Jones. 
However, there is "no discussion" 
concerning coed dorms at present, 
according to Hesburgh. 
"We're special," he said. "I'm not passing judgment on anybody, but we feel separate dorms work best in our system." 

Smuggler sentenced 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -William Morgan Hetrick, the admitted drug smuggler who was indicted with John DeLorean, was sentenced yesterday to ten years in federal prison after prosecutors said he had "cooperated handsomely" with the government. 
U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi, who presided over DeLorean's trial, imposed a series of concurrent sentences on charges that include conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine, cocaine pos­session with intent to distribute and income tax evasion.

U.S. State Department to reinforce embassies 
AliiiOClated Pre!lll 
NEW YORK -'Inc State Depart· ment disc.:losed yesterday it is asking Congress to urgently approve an­other S372 million in emergency funds to improve security at Ameri­can embassies in the wake of the ter­rorist bomb that devastated the U.S. Embassy annex in Beirut last week. 
john Hughes, a State Department spokesman, said the funds will be used to build and strengthen bar­ricades around embassies, to speed up nmstruction of some new em­bassies in "high threat areas," to pro­vide armored vehicles and to control public access to certain em­bassies. 
Hughes said the Reagan adminis­tration wants the aid approved before the end of the current sess­slon of Congress, Oct. 4. 
Plans to upgrade security at U.S. embassies was first envisioned in 1979 as a response to mob attacks against U.S. facilities in Pakistan, Iran and Ubya. 'Inc program called for improving security at I25 sites at a cost of S 192 million. Some posts were dropped from the program, which until yesterday was expected to cost S 145 million. 
Hughes announced the aid re­quest after Secretary ofState George Shultz, attending a United Nations session here, received a report from a team of Investigators who probed the devastation of the embassy an­nex In Beirut and are to make recommendations about how to im­prove security. 
Heading the team was Robert Oakley, the State Department's co­ordinator for counterterrorism. 
Hughes said the administration has no plans to close its diplomatic posts in Lebanon after the terrorist attack, the third to destroy an Ameri­can installation in that city in 1 7 month!i. 
Other blasts destroyed the U.S. Embassy In April 1983 and the U.S. Marine headquarters in October. 
Hughes said the investigators dis­closed that the van that blew up, heavily damaging the embassy an­nex and killing at least 13 people, was carrying the equivalent of 3,000 pounds ofdynamite. 
He said apparently there was only one occupant In the terrorist vehicle which managed to get through the outer gate ofthe embassy annex, and that that terrorist may have already been shot dead by the time the van exploded 20 feet from the annex building_ 
He said the investigators reported that Lebanese guards hired by the embassy fired at the van as It headed towards the annex, but that Lebanese soldiers in the area ap­parently did not fire. He said there were some police who also did not 
fire.  
Asked  if  that  meant  he  was  
criticizing  the  Lebanese,  he  said,  
"I'm not making a judgment_"  

He said the investigators found that while special protective cover­ing over the windows worked well on the side of the building, it failed to work in the front and back of the structure. 
In Washington, meanwhile, the State Department said yesterday it has alerted U.S. diplomatic posts worldwide to reassess their security measures following a new threat by the same group that claimed respon­sibility for last week's bombing.

COLUMBIA CITY, Ind. · Saying "we can't tolerate human sacrifice in the name of religion," a judge sen­tenced a faith-healing couple to five years in prison yesterday in the death of their infant son from an un­treated illness. 
judge Edward Meyers of Whitley Circuit Court told Gary Hall, 33, and his 27-year-old wife, Margaret that 
the sentence gave him "more con­cern" than any he has handed down in 20 years on the bench. Nevertheless, said the judge,

He then sentenced them to five years in prison on a reckless homicide conviction and two years on a child neglect conviction with the sentences to be served concur­rently. 
The Halls, released on their own recognizance, are members of the Faith Assembly Church, a faith­healing sect based In Noble County which shuns doctors and medicine. They had acted as their own defense attorneys during their August trial_ 
They showed no emotion when the sentence was pronounced, and 
said they would appeal.

Before he sentenced Mrs. Hall, who is pregnant with her fourth child, Meyers asked her if she could ever provide medical care for her children. "On the basis of my con­victions, and of my fear of God Al­mighty, I could not provide medical care," she said. 
The judge said after court he was 
unaware of the status of the Halls' 
two other children at home_ 
"I guess I can't recall in 20 years on the bench any sentence that has given me more concern and I've spent more thought thinking about than this one," Meyers said. "I'm not certain why that Is -other than or­dinarily the sentences I hand down are ones I see week In and week out. This is a unique situation." 
But, said Meyer, "Certain societies have now reached a point where we can't tolerate human sacrifice In the name ofreligion. I don't feel you can justify this kind ofbehavior." 
The Halls were convicted Aug. 26. 
Their 26-day-old son, joel David, 
died at home Feb. 16 ofan untreated 
pneumonia, Whitley County 
Coroner Alfred Allina testified. The 
child's life could have been saved 
with readily available treatment, he 
said. 
The Halls, in their unsuccessful defense, told the jury the state had no authority to compel its residents to seek a doctor's care. 
They cited an Indiana child ne­glect law that allows parents caring for a sick child to substitute prayer for medicine in the "legitimate practice" of religious beliefs. 
Attorney john Bloom, who was appointed by the court to file an ap­peal for the Halls, said he will center on the nature of the state's child ne­glect law. 
"It indicates someone who legitimately practices a religious beliefdoes not have to use a doctor. There's a conflict as to the scope of that exception.

Howard fights back against false image 

It has become a tradition that Dillon Hall sponsors a pep rally before the first home foot­ball game every year. This year's rally went off as planned. However, it was marred by an ex­tremely childish act on Dillon's part. 
On Thursday afternoon, someone in Dillon hung a banner from their window which read "Colorado Sucks Howard Pop. 165". When members ofthe Howard football team saw the banner, they got very angry and told the Dil­lonites to take it down. They refused. Dillon's 
Paul Cimino on a pale horse 
rector was no help and the banner was finally removed by force. Later that night at the pep
,..
,. rally another banner, much the same as the first, hung on Dillon's wall and remained there 
,r 
throughout the pep rally. Why? It would seem that a number of years ago 
r 
the president of Howard Hall at that time,
r 
went on "Donahue" and openly proclaimed
r 
that he was gay. Maybe this gentleman
r 
r thought he was doing the right thing at the time, but years later "boys" from Dillon are still harping on this subject to try to get the
~ 
whole campus to believe that Howard is-a gay dorm. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Friday night Howard Hall held its annual Hat and Tie Party. The Hat and Tie has been one of the biggest social events on campus since about 1977 and has always been well attended. This year's party was no exception as there were many girls in attendance. None of these girls gave one thought to this totally false reputation and thay all had a great time. In fact, many of them came to Howard on Sat­urday night also as was partly evidenced by the eight I found in my room at midnight. 
Howard has been. fighting this wrongful reputation for quite a long time now and has been very successful. But acts like Dillon's make all this fighting for naught. No matter what anybody says, Howard is a terrific dorm and filled with, in my opinion, the best bunch of men on campus. It is due to the people and atmosphere at Howard that many football players enjoy living there. Players like Mike Larkin, Chris Smith, Allen Pinkett, Mike Gann, Wally Kleine, Eric Dorsey, Alonzo Jefferson, and Ricky Gray to name a few. I don't see these gentlemen livingin Dillon. 
Then again, maybe the Dillon "boys" are just jealous ofHoward. Sure, Dillon is the larg­est dorm on the South Quad and the perennial inter-hall football champs, however, Howard, at almost one-third the size, fields a football team which regularly wins its division. Add to this the thrashing Dillonls baseball team took last year at the hands ofa Howard team which made it to the finals, and one can see that man­for-man, Dillon may have the quantity, but Howard has got the quality. 
It is about time that this absolutely false reputation was laid to rest, once and for all. Howard should finally be recognized as one of the great halls on the South Quad. Further­more, everyone should realize that Howard is no more a gay dor{ll than is Dillon. And maybe, just maybe ifthe Dillon "boys" would accept this fact they might finally get headed on the correct road to maturity.

The function of this university 
The recent speech given by New York Mario Cuomo at Notre Dame was an articulate statement ofone Catholic politician's view on religious belief and public Morality. While many people might not agree with Cuomo's argument, I think those who listened appreci­ated the eloquence and depth ofthe govenor's 
Mark Boennighausen 
Gravity is a myth 

discussion. It was obvious by the delivery that Cuomo had written the speech and had put a great amount of effort into preparing it. He was not simply an actor reading someone else's words. 
The content and validity of the speech, however, are not to be discussed here. The reaction ofsome members ofthe Notre Dame community though deserve some comment, I think. 
I do not criticize those who disagree with Cuomo's position, but I do have many reserva­tions about those who thought it was im­proper for Cuomo to speak at Notre Dame. It seems that a university should be a place for exploring subjects and seeking new insights into issues. And tho1,1gh it may surprise some, there are other sincere views on the abortion issue than the one put forth by the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. To deny the expres­sion of di1Jerent beliefs strikes at the heart of the function of any university whether it be Catholic or secular in character. 
· A university is one place to develop beliefs about a broad range ofissues and exposure to all sides of these issues is a necessity. Anyone who takes a side ofan issue without exploring the other side believes out ofignorance rather than evidence. Surely those who would have denied Cuomo access to Notre Dame as a forum to express his personal views did not think that he would corrupt the minds of an intelligent and independent Notre Dame stu­dent body. And ifhe did make some students think about their beliefs, even for a moment, he did a great service for the University. 
It is unfortuante that many members of the Notre Dame community would like nothing better than to have only "correct" Catholic views presented here. There does seem to be a feeling that Notre Dame should become, as one professor has complained, a "Cathlic ghetto." Another faculty member, who has since left the University, told me she felt there was an "inquistion" being conducted by the administration to keep the school entirely Catholic. Ifsuch an environment is indeed de­veloping, it spells disaster for the University. Exposure to di11erent perspectives is healthy, and for a univeristy it is a must. 
One protestor outside of Washington Hall, who was marching around before Cuomo's speech, had a sign that stated, "I am a Catholic, I am ashamed." This comment seemed to im­ply that anybody who supported the idea that Cuomo should be allowed to speak was not Catholic. 
Logically, people who question an individ­ual's or Notre Dame's catholicity should have a concrete definition ofwhat it is to be Catho­
lic. Is is possible to have an exact definition. If there is one, I personally wonder what it is. Since I have reservations about the Church's view on birth control and I see some hypocrisy in her decress on divorce, am I no longer Catholic? Ifso, I should call my mother since she has always told our neighbors what a "good Catholic boy" 1 am. 
One thing I have learned at Notre Dame is that Catholicism is not easily defined. Whe­ther one takes Father McBrien's class or a "conservative" theology class, there is no spe­cific recipe for the make-up of a Catholic. Un­doubtedly there are definite beliefs that are demanded of a Catholic but there is room for varying views within the religion. That is what makes it such a strong and vibrant commu­nity. Debate and discussion of di1Jerent views keeps a community strong and those who want to restrain some parts of any discussion are only doing a disservice to the entire com­munity. 
A university is not like a medieval town. Building walls will not make it stonger or bet­ter. The desire to keep di1ferent people and ideas in exile is unhealthy and, in the long run, it only makes a university weaker and more ignorant.

In defense of the lives of the unborn 
In the speech Mario Cuomo delivered recently at Notre Dame, he argues that a law against abonion would be widely violated and that is a reason for not having a law against abortion. I agree with him that within the first few years after the law is passed, there will be much violation of the law -after all, many young women have grown up believing that 
Janet E. Smith 
guest column 

they have a "right" to kill their babies and the fact that the government has paid for this kil­ling has led them to believe that they were doing something moral. It will be difficult to correct the impression we, without bad laws and policies, have created. Laws for affirma­tive action have been and continue to be widely violated because many do not agree with them, but gradually the law is helping change attitudes and correct the situation. Without the laws, gaining rights for women, minorities, and the unborn might happen eventually, but the law is a great facilitator in this process. 
Cuomo also argues that he isobliged 19 up, hold the Constitution even if it legalizes kil­ling (though few scholars support the decision of the Supreme Court that a right to abortion is truly in the Constitution). He would not be violating the constitution. And the constitution surely does not mandate that we pay for abortions. Rather it s~>Pms an im­position on all those who thint.. abortion is kil­ling to use their hard earned money to pay for abortions. Let us hope that Cuomo does not agree with Ferraro who has argued that we should pay for the abortions of the poor be­cause "the cost of putting an unwanted child through the system far outweighs the cost of those procedures (abortion)" Oune 27, 1979 ). I, for one, would gladly pay to suppon the babies of the poor rather than kill them. I am surprised that those who make such gran­diose claims to compassion, don't share my view. Let us also hope that Cuomo would not share the views of the compassionate Ferraro who on Sept. 30, 1982 voted against an amendment to prohibit federal funding of medicaid experiments on living unborn children intended for abortion. 

As mentioned, Cuomo argues that to outlaw abortion would divide our pluralistic nation. Is Cuomo's reading of the American attitude 
. .towards abortion correct? On "Nightline," Fa­ther Hesburgh stated that he believed that most Americans oppose abortion on demand and would support a law against abortion with exceptions for the cases of rape, incest, and health of the mother (and the polls support this statement). Indeed, a poll taken by the Washington Post and ABC at the time of the Democratic National Convention showed that while only 9 percent ofthe delegates sup­ported laws against abortion, 46 percent of rank and file Democrats think abortion ought to be outlawed; if members ofthe party which has the right to abortion in its platform feels this way, it is highly likely that we have the 51 percent Cuomo said he would recognize as a consensus. Does Cuomo realize that such a law as Hesburgh supports would eliminate nearly all abortions? Why is not he working at least for this sort oflaw? 
While I have many and profound disagree­ments with Cuomo, in this day and age of a la carte Catholicism, I found inspiring his repeated statements that he accepted the teaching ofthe Church on abortion, birth con­trol, and divorce binding on him as a Catholic: certainly he is unusual for his loyalty and to be commended for his obedience in this regard. I also thought he was right to point out that rarely are Catholics taught by their priests (and I would add professors) why the Church teaches that such practices are wrong and that this most likely explains why Catholics are so confused and so inclined to have abortions, etc. Mycontact with students here leads me to believe that few ofthem have met with priests or professors who have explained the Church's teaching on birth control or abor­tion to them: in fact they are more likely to have heard from those who dissent from the Church's teaching. 
Abortion, the killing ofthe unborn, is a very great evil. We need intelligent and articulate individuals with great moral conviction who will use their talents, . opportunities, and powers of persuasion to win others over to the cause of life. Let us hope that out of this great Catholic university there may emerge Catholics who can speak as courageously and eloquently in defense of the lives of the un­born as Mario Cuomo did in defense ofhis po­sition of"l am personally opposed to abortion but..."

P.O. Box Q 
A living will allows death with dignity 
Dear Editor: 
While Dane Galden did make some valid points in his guest column "Euthenasia is ab· surd" (September 17 ), he also made a mistake. A living will does not give "permission to kill," it allows one to die with dignity. A living will does not force the physician to kill the patient, It merely asks that extraordinary means not be taken to preserve a life. What is the sense in prolonging life if there is no hope for the future? 
If my brain is so severely damaged in an accident that I will never be the person I once was (or, in coarser terms, if I will be a 'vegetable'), what Is the sense in keeping my body alive with respirators, IV's and other medical devices? All a living will does is ask that such devices be disconnected; the matter oflife or death is up to God. 
Sue Fischer Pasquertlla West Hall 

We must respect dissenting opinion 
Dear Editor: 
Even though I have written some rather strong commentaries about the present politi· cal climate in the past week, I am forced to caution tht· American populace, though, from falling into a pitfall that could endanger the current democratic system we live in. 
With the overwhelming tide of political opinion seeming to stand behind President Reagan, we must be careful not to adopt a McCarthian mentality of the 1950's toward dissenting opinion. lbough the Republican party is portrayed by some as "the party of the future", and some Democrats are jokingly referred to as "pinkos" and "commies", we must keep these comments in the realm of humor. For nearly two centuries the Constitu· tiona! right offreedom ofspeech and opinion has been the cornerstone of American 
democracy. Any faction of the populace, be it Democratic or Republican, Fascist or Com· munist, llberal or Conservative, should and must be able to, without harrassment or threat, propose thoughtful and intelligent opinions about current political, moral, and social issues pressing upon our nation. 
Remember the example of Nazi Germany. Be careful not w be just another "cog in the wheel", but rather make sure you have a good reason to cast a ballot for the candidate you will pull the lever for. Persecution is for criminals, not for those whose opinions dis­agree with those of popular consensus. Re· member the words of former President Uncoln, "A house, ivided against itself, cannot stand." Do not loosen the screws.

A human embryo is a person 
DearEditor: 
After Gov. Cuomo's presentation at Notre 
Dame, the Boston Globe headlined: "Cuomo 
says Church has no teachings that compel 
abortion ban."Well what about Command· 
ment number five · thou shall not kill? 
It is time to clear away all the clutter sur· rounding the abortion issue. The heart of the matter is, and always will be, whether a human embryo is a person or not. If not, then abor· tion is acceptable. 
Intuition tells an expectant mother and an expectant father that what is growing in her womb is their child. 
Science tells us that the joining ofovum and sperm begins a process that Insures the con­tinuation of the species. 
No religion or politics, just reason! 
We have freedom ofchoice: We either hold that a human embryo is a person or that a human embryo is not a person. So let us cut out all this "I am personally opposed...but..." nonsense.

'Lettuce talk' about ND Food Service 
DearEditor: 
For two years I have consistently heard only grievances and complaints in the area ofNotre Dame's dining experience, the latest being "Lettuce Talk" in the Tuesday, September 18th Observer. 
My first year at Notre Dame I thought the food was pretty good, but It wasn't until last year, after spending several months In France, the country ofhaute cuisine, that I knew it was good! 
One complains here about a sparcely supplied salad bar and ketchup in the dressing bins, or about warm milk and little ice cream. Well, imagine a dining hall where there are no choices and no seconds ifone should discover something edible, no deli for alternatives nor a salad bar, no drinks except water, oranges occasionally but never napkins, and stale bread to sop up oodles ofgrease. 

My return to South Dining Hall was, believe it or not, quite anticipated. I have never seen anyone sit down with an empty tray. How could they with several hot plate choices as well as vegetable choices, deli choices, des­sert choices, cereal choices and a salad bar? 
I now appreciate such unseen specialities as peanut butter, ketchup and ice cream and the special efforts for variety (i.e. · picnics or theme nights). 
My mother had trouble pleasing three people at every meal and for the University Food Services to attempt to please 7000 is ex­tremely admirable.

We should not force 
our morals on others 
DearEditor: 
Being one of those students that was "seduced" by Governor Cuomo's speech, I must refute Paul Douglas' argument concern­ing his political double-talk. Ofcourse the au­dience's reception would have been negative ifthe word murder would have replaced abor· tion. That is because it is generally accepted in our society that murder is morally wrong. The difference is not between murder and abor­tion, for I too, believe they are the same. The difference lies in the perspective taken by our society as a whole. It is obvious the majority of Americans do not see abortion as we do. 
The personal morals we each hold are to regulate our own actions. Just because we see abortion as murder does not automatically mean that everybody else does as well. We may try to persuade others to see it our way but can never force our morals on them.

Does Notre Dame look Catholic enough? 
DearEditor: 
All the controversy surrounding the ques· tion "Is Notre Dame Catholic enough?" lacks an important discussion on our understanding of Catholicism. An assumed aspect of Cat· holicism in the articles I have read is the necessity of restricting the exposure of Cat· holies to certain "proper" Catholic view­points. This denies the church's recent swing endorsing the ecumenical movement. This movement Is a timely realization that other religions have an element oftruth and that we can be aided on our spiritual quests with an appreciation of these other truths. 
Maybe our original question should actu· ally be "Does Notre Dame LOOK Catholic enough?" and the ensuing "Do I LOOK Catho­lic enough?" These questions invariably ad· dress how other people view the externals of our faith, how many Masses we attend, the number ofdorms having a daily Mass and even what ratio ofCatholics (with "proper" views) are on our teaching staff. Faith cannot be mea· sured in this way. It Is an attitude toward life, a 
way ofviewing the world with a commitment 
to Christ. Jesus of Nazareth would not appear 
Catholic by todays standards and yet he lived 
the radical life offaith. 
We have all read about the crusades of the 
past which were conducted in order to obtain 
a piece ofland. Many human lives were need· 
lessly lost in this "search for God." Ace we em· 
barking on another crusade to find a peace of 
mind by expurglng all ideas which are con· 
trary to our own? Is the life that Is needlessly 
lost in this crusade our own life of the spirit?

Preventing stupid and senseless wars 
DearEditor: 
Regarding Evan Farley's letter In this space 
on September I8, In which he attacked 
Varga's political views, I have a few com· 
men!S. 
Mr. Farley, it is very good and noble to be 
willing to fight and die for freedom, and if 
freedom and justice are the Ideals which led 
you to choose a military career, then I deem 
you a very good and noble man. 
However, are you really willing to kill and die for American consumers' gasoline supply? Well, even If you are, I am not willing to let you. The greatest quality ofAmerica is that Its citizens have a say in the doings of their gov· ernment, and I intend to work · and vote · to prevent such a stupid waste ofyour life. 
Mr. Farley, as an ROTC cadet you must be a student of American military history. Surely you are aware that we have not fought a single war for freedom since World War II. (And we were in preciousfew before that.) At best, this country's motives have been mixed. At worst, as in Santo Domingo and Grenada, we fought to bolster our national ego or preserve cor­porate profits. Lest you think I exaggerate, ask yourself why we are not giving more overt aid to the Afghani rebels, why we are not pressur­ing South Africa's government to give up Apar· theid, and why we are nru demanding that Chile's military junta allow democracy to return. The United States is not doing any of these things because It is not in our economic interest to do them. (God forbid that the Chileans might elect a government that might nationalize American holdings!) Most Americans simply don't value other peoples' freedom enough to support the sacrifices we'd make to help them secure it. 
Me. Farley, I would be ashamed of a people who would trade their sons' blood for gasoline, but who would not demand freedom for oppressed people everywhere In the world. I would be ashamed of a people who would elect a President who substitutes jln· goistic rhetoric for rational diplomacy. 
Finally, Mr. Farley, one who fights for freedom Is a noble warrior, but one who would die for any President's machismo Is an unfortunate dupe. I, for one, will have no part ofthe slaughter ofsuch dupes. When your are swimmingIn your guts and blood offthe shore of Nicaragua, let your dying curse be for the people who sent you there, and not for the ones who tried to prevent a stupid and sense· less war.

of the goal, where it was headed back in front. The ball was headed one more time before IU fullback · Dan King got his head on the ball and flicked it over the head ofSteranka at 
40:36. 
At halftime, the score remained 
tied at 1-1. Indiana coach jerry 
Yeagley admitted afterward that he 
had been worried at halftime, but he 
said he also was confident that his 
team would pull away in the second 
period. 
"To play that kind of high­pressure (game) and do the kind of running they (the Irish) had to do to contain us in the first half catches up with you," Yeagley explained, "and they're not to the point yet where they have the reserves that they can put in there to maintain that kind of pressure." Conversely, IU has plenty of capable subs, as the Irish discovered in the second half. 
"When jerry makes four or five subs," Notre Dame coach Dennis Grace said, "he's just as tough as he is at the start of the game." 
The Hoosiers began to spread the Irish defense wide on the field, and they were able to get several 

Tuesday, September 25, 1984-page 8 
breakaways from the wings. At 4:01 of the second period, Paul DiBer­nardo put Indiana ahead, and the Irish could not make up the deficit. 
Additional goals by DiBernardo, Iker Zubizerreta and Chris Keenan accounted for the final 5-1 score. 
Fatigue was the biggest enemy of Notre Dame in the second half, as the Irish players no longer could keep up with the Indiana team, which spread across the entire width ofthe field. Grace said he does not feel the Hoosiers were in better shape than his players, but that their skill level was too much for his players to combat with fitness alone. 
"Yeah, they wore us down," Grace admits, "but I think we're in fine physical shape. When you play a team the sort of Indiana, with the control they have, they make you chase and make you work for every­thing you get. You have to extend yourself beyond your limit. I think we did that, and I have no problems with that. 
"We played them 40 good minutes; that's a lot," Grace contin­ued. "I don't know how many teams can say they played 40 minutes of good ball against Indiana University. 
"Unfortunately for Notre Dame," Grace conceded, "it's a 90-minute game." 
Yeagley said he made some tactr cal changes at halftime to force the Irish to do more running and tire more quickly in the second half. 
"What we decided at halftime was that we were not going to try to at­tack as quickly," the Hoosier coach said. "We were going to work the ball up more slowly from the back and midfield and try to make them do a little more chasing anJ draw them out of their defensive align­ment. That seemed to work much better, and we were constantly able to get the ball through on the outside." 
The statistics for the game look as lopsided as the score in favor of the Hoosiers. Indiana had 21 shots to Notre Dame's five. Steranka made eight saves, but Killough had to make only one. 
Perhaps the most striking differ· ence is the number of corner kicks for each team. Notre Dame gave up 16 of the dangerous scoring oppor­tiunities to the Hoosiers, but the Irish had only one corner kick in the game. After the game, Yeagley com­mented on the significance of that statistic. 
"I looked up at the scoreboard (at halftime)," Yeagley said, "and I saw one corner kick and one goal (for the Irish). I still see one corner kick and one goal." 
Notre Dame will have a chance to get back on the winning track to­morrow night at Loyola.

So far, defense the key for NFL's top winners 
Aas<KiatedPrcss 
'Ibe adage that a team wins with defense ha~ returned to the National Football league -for one day at least. 
After several years of routine 41­38 games, primarily a product of the 1978 rule changes allowing defen­sive backs only one bump and only within five yards of the line of scrimmage, the defensive players are starting to get revenge. The pri­mary tools are complex pass rushes with linemen stunting and lineback­ers looping out of disguised varia­tions of 3-4 and nickel defenses. 
Sunday wa~ a good example. 
It was a day in which five touchdowns were scored by defenders -three by members of the Seattle Seahawks in a 38-9 rout of the Chicago Bears. 
It wa~ a day in whi1.:h the Dallas Cowboys knocked Green Bay quar­terback lynn Dickey out of the game; sacking Dickey and backup Randy Wright six times, and holding the Packers to 77 yards passing in a 20-6 victory. How did Green Bay score? On an intercepted pass by de­fensive end Robert Brown. 
"Our defensive line did a great job rushing without a blitz," said Coach Tom Landry, adding that this Cow­boys' defense finally is beginning to remind him of the team's defenses of a decade ago.

Fourteen-year career ends 
Lanier announces retirement 
Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE -Milwaukee Bucks center Bob Lanier announced his re­tirement yesterday afternoon, en­ding a 14-year quest for a National Basketball Association champion­ship ring. 
"Today's decision is the result ofa great deal of mind-and soul­searching for me," Lanier said in a release distributed at a news confer­ence. "I wanted to be a productive part of the team, I wanted to make a difference if I played, and I am not sure that I could get through an­other season. A part of me still lusts for the challenge, but my mind tells me it's time."

Field goal kicking was the key in the two Leahy division games. Zahm's Andy Richardson popped a 35-yarder in the second quarter and the Zahm defense did the rest shut­ting out Cavanaugh, 3-0. 
Stanford took a sidestep in its at­tempt to defend the Leahy crown as it tied Alumni 3-3. Stanford's Dan O'Donnel kicked a dramatic 38-yard field goal in the last minute to offset a 40-yarder by Alumni's Joe Coogan in the third quarter.

Whatever the number, the Cubs ended a magical, Cinderella season with a 4-1 victory over the Pit­tsburgh Pirates that clinched the Na­tiona! League East championship and their first title of any kind since 1945. 
In a champagne-splattered locker room afterwards, the Cubs couldn't wait to heap praise and pour beer on each other to celebrate a title that many in baseball thought would never come to a team that still plays ail-day baseball at home. 
"They said a team that played in the day couldn't win. Well, we proved them wrong," said jubilant Manager Jim Frey, who did in one season what a score ofpredecessors couldn't do-bring a title to Chicago. 
"This is just unbelieveable," said

One might think that with all the po­sition juggling taking place, it may be difficult for a player to concen­trate on a new position. But the coaches are very pleased with McCabe's progress. 
"Initially I was not convinced John could play at the inside linebacking position," says lineback­ing coach George Kelly. "And I'll ad­mit, he had some trouble adjusting at first. But John studied the films in­tently this summer and worked so hard, any improvement that has taken place is all due to his own ef­forts." 
This hard work and dedicated atti­tude culminated in last Saturday's performance against the Buffalos of Colorado. Entering the game late in the second half, McCabe finished the game as the team's leading tackler, wrestling down the opponent 10 times, six ofwhich were unassisted.

The Cubs, who spent six months enjoying the cheers of the two million-plus who jammed Wrigley Field, spent 15 minutes cheering their fans in a nearly deserted stadium 90 minutes after the title was won. 
As the scoreboard flashed a live 1V picture of thousands of revelers jamming the streets outside Wrigley Field, a dozen Cubs watched in glee, slapping high fives and toasting the crowd with champagne. 
"I wish we could have won this in Chicago in front of our fans," Frey said. "But I'm just happy we were able to do this for our fans. This is just a wonderful, wonderful feeling."

"I'm happy that I got some actual game experience," echoes McCabe. "Anything good that happens gives me some hope for the future. But I only wish we (the second team defense) could have held Colorado scoreless. I'm satisfied with my play, but I'll never be totally satisfied un­til I earn a statting position. I'll just wait in the wings till then and keep working at it." 
With this strive for perfection atti­tude and his dedication to the game, John McCabe really doesn't need to swallow any pride, and it certainly looks as though the future will be bright both on and off the football field.
