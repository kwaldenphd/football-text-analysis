News Wnier 

After submitting a portfolio of work from the past year, Hob Finch. Notre Dame class of 1998. was selected by a panel of six judges as 1999's best photogra­pher, winning the National Press Photographer of the Year award. 
The award, one of the most prestigious in the nation, brings significant recognition and a cash prize. Finch stressed that the recognition is far more important than any monetary reward. 
"No one really enters for the money," he said. "Having your work shown and hopefully rec­ognized is the important thing." 
Sponsored by the University of Missouri. the contest provides photographers from around the globe with the opportunity to showcase both single images and multi-picture stories. 
Since graduating from the University of Notre Dame in 1998. Finch has worked as staff photographer at The Beacon News in Aurora. Ill. His interest

Learning to roll 

Sometimes, it's good to come tumbling down. 
I'm not the most coordinated person you'll meHt. It took me three months to learn to ride a two-wheeler in the second grade. I spent the majority of grade school with ban­dages across my knees. and in latter years, have developed an infa­mous knack for falling down the stairs. 
So imagine me on rollerblades. 
As dumb as it may sound, the idea of gliding around on shoes with little wheels was incredibly intriguing to me. It looked so easy -all these peopli>

Fditor 

take any chances. I strapped on my skating gear -kneepads, wrist guards and elbow pads -and attempted to get up. Within Ove seconds, I realized I would not be one of those graceful gliding 
bodies. Instead of f1ying over the concrcle wilh the greatest of ease, I tumbled to the ground in a startling slump. There was noth­
ing graceful in sight. 
Great, just great. I'd only been on these things for five seconds, and already had taken a face plant into the cement. I knew if [ was going to complete this mission success­fully, I had to get back up. So I grabbed my friend's hand, shakily rolled back up to a standing position (almost tearing her down to the ground in the process) and tentatively was on my way again. 
And slowly, but surely, I was rolling. Slowly, but I was going somewhere. Finally! I was navigating bumps, cracks and small inclines, and by the time I reached the end of the avenue, I considered myself a pro. 
Next obstacle -crossing the street. 

I guess the problem started when I couldn't figure out how to stop when I approached the road. Holling out of control, I grasped the stone wall in a desperate effort to brake. Aware my skill was not yet advanced enough to combat moving vehicles, I was forced to lake my friend's hand and be pulled across U.S, 33. Shaking ofT the glances of amused drivers, I made it across the street -with guidance. 
After about 20 minutes of slow progress, I had navigated my way through the grotto, across south quad. and almost back to Saint Mary's. I thought I was home free -maybe even klutzes could manage this rollerblading deal. But it became painfully evident from the sympathetic glances from runners and pedes­trians on campus that I still had a long way to go. 
I guess my biggest victory was getting home that day. I did end up making it back to Saint Mary's uninjured -a major feat for a self­proclaimed klutz. Besides the scrape on my left leg -the one patch of skin left exposed by my skating gear -I returned with a small amount of confidence that maybe, just maybe, with the help of some friends, I could do this. 
And hey -if I'm going to fall, at least they're there to help me up. That's all part of learning to roll.

Harvard activists hold 'teach-ins' 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 
More than 30 student activists evaded Harvard University Police Department (I IUPD) officers and staged three consecutive "teach-ins" to argue for a living wage Thursday morning, disrupting administrators in Mass Hall. the Harvard Office of Labor Relations and the University Developmnnt Officn. 
Supporters of the campaign, which demands a mini­mum $10 per hour wage for all Harvard employees, stormed into each oflice with a prepari>d presentation of graphs, charts and worker testimonies. Whnn IIUPD oflicers arrivnd, the protesters dispersed, met again at a prearranged spot and moved on to the next target. 
The Progressive Student Labor Movement (PSLl\-1) spearheads both the living wage and the anti-sweatshop campaigns, but most activism so far this year, both nationally and at llarvard, has cnnternd around sweat­shop policy. 
Yesterday's action, coinciding with an ongoing three­day sit-in at .Johns llopkins University, was thn first in several months for the living wage campaign. 
"It kept us visible and reassertnd the goals of the living wage campaign," said Roona Ray, a PSLM member.

SMC lecture series to focus on 01artyrs 


By KATIE MCVOY 
News Wricer 
Last night began a series of Lenten lertn1·es at Saint i\1ary's on the martyrs of El Salvador. Marie Dennis. di.rec.­tor of tlrn Marvknoll omce for Global Conce(ns. will be giv­ing the lectures in Stapkton Lounge Monday and Tuesday nigh1...; a'i wel.l. 
The lectures will focus on the men and women mar­tvre<l in El Salvador <lurinla{ the 17-year dvil war. 
Sunday's lecture focused on Archbishop Oscar H.omero, who was Msassinated in the diocese of Sun Salvador in 1980. Dennis used Romero·s story to illustratP the impor­tance of linding life in the res­urrcr.tion. 
Prom 1975 to 1992, approximately 75,000 people were killed in the Salvadoran civil war. Although gen-politi­cal interests. and not religious motivations. f'Ufiled the war. many of those who died were church workers who wr.re martyred for their faith. Ninety-two percent of the killings were committed by the army or army groups, said Dennis. 
t\t that time the Catholic Church in El Salvador under­went a change. Heligious workers were invited to accompany the poor. 
"The church moved from traditional church work to the reality of poverty," Dennis said. "The theology of libera­tion began to emerge. and this theology intersected with politi.~al and ideological ideas. 
Romero was the Archbishop of the diocese of San Salvador. Early in his career he was verv conserva­tive. but following the death of his dose friend Rutilio

Grande, he underwent a transformation. According to Ernestino Riv<'ra. a clos<' friend of Romero's. Grande"s words passed into Homcro. 
Romero became a servant of the pRople. As his vh;ion of how lifo in El Salvador became sharper. he was pulled more and more by opposing forres. On one side he wa'i urged by revolutionar­ies to confront thA govern­ment. On the other hand, he was encouraged by wealthy citizens and other bishops of the church to settle down. Ile would often "pull away to prayer. almost experting an answer. It seems he often got them," Dennis said. 
Romero was ac;sassinated at the Chapel of Divinu Providencia on March 24, 1980. Moments before his death he said, "As a Christian, I don't believe in death with­out resurrection. If am killed, l will rise again in the people of El Salvador." 
Dennis said that the chal­lenge for today's Catholic is to look at the story as we jour­ney to new creation in the Lenten season. 
"We too are invited to allow the blood nourished seeds of liberation to grow in our souls to move with [Romero] in the cWTent of history that knows death is not the end." 
When asked what was esperially poignant about this story for today's college stu­dent, Dennis said that the oppression happened to stu­dents as well. 
"Some of the worst repres­sion occurred in the universi­ties because the students were organizing for a social change. Many fled the country and didn't return to their lives until they were in their thir­ties. You are living the years that were stolen away." 
The lectures will continue 
this week. Monday night's 
lecture will focus on four 
women missionaries mar­
tyred in El Salvador and 
Tuesday night's lecture will 
focus on Jesuit martyrs.

Associated Press 

MAPUTO 
With fears of heavy rain 
again looming, authoritiPs 
warned thousands of dis­
placed l\lozambicans on 
Sunday against returning 
to low-lying areas to 
search for what remains of 
their homes and belong­
ings. 

As the swollen Limpopo 
and Savr rivers rec:Pded, 
rescue workers and aid 
officials said the risk of 
drowning had diminished. 
'v\lhat now facPd f1ood sur­

food and dean wat-r. 

"The rescuA phase is 
corning to a close," said 
Boss Mountain. a United 
Nations spArial envoy who 
spent two days .flying ovAr 
still subnwrged arnas of 
the southeast African 
nation. 

He Ii er e!Torts focused 
instead on distributing aid 
to desperate survivors, 
many of whom were still 
onlv accessible bv air. said 
Brend a Barton. ·a spokes­
woman for the United 
Nations World Food 
Program. 

Fights broke out in 
camps as survivors. raven­
ous and thirsty after being 
stranded in trnes and on 
rooftops for up to a week, 
clambered for food. 

A total of :n helicopters 
and 15 planr.s delivered aid 
on Sunday, mostly in thn 
Limpopo Hivrr valley, 125 
miles northeast of the capi­
tal. Maputo, Barton said. 

Another two helicopters 
were ferrying strandPd 
people to locations whrre 
relief groups were attrmpt­
ing to distribute the enrnr­
gAncy supplies. she said. 

In neighboring South 
Africa, 32 airmen from 
McGuire Air Force Base in 
New Jersey and Dover Air 
Force Base in Delaware 
arrived at llor.dspruit air 
base on Sunday to set up 
aid operations for up to 
600 American troops. 

Mountain said many sur­
vivors were ignoring the 
pleas of aid workers and 
government officials and 
returning to flood-battered 
areas, raising the possibili­
ty they may ner.d to br. res­
cued again if heavy rains 
and flooding resume. 

The remnants of Cyclone Gloria, which together with a steady, two-week down­pour caused the deluge, has been downgraded to a tropical storm. The storm hovered over the Indian ()r,ean off the coast of Mozambique on Sunday, and was expected to bring more rain. Mozambican weather forec:asters said. 
Although tlrn rPlief effort was gaining pace, Prnsident Joachim Chissano said thr. interna­tional community had been slow to respond to the cat­astrophe, an allegation the 
U.N. envoy denied. 
"It does take timn to get helicopters from Europe, We need to be realistir,," Mountain said. More than $40 million had already been pledgcid for r,mer­gency relief and recon­struction. he said.

Californians to vote 

on gay 01arr1age 

Associated Press 
NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. 
The pastor of St. Andrew's 

Presbyterian Church told his 
congregation Sunday that he 
welcomes gay people into his 
church. Rut he doesn't want 
them marrying. 
Dr. John Huffman said he 

supports Proposition 22. the 
controversial measure on 
Ttmsday's ballot that would bar 
gay marriages from official 
recognition in California. 
"Love the sinner, hate the 

sin." Huffman said. "I am not 
prepared to declarn that what 
the Bible says is sin is no longer 
sin." 
With the election just two days 

away, churchgoers around 
California struggled with how to 
vote on a meac;ure that has gal­
vanized and divided the reli­
gious community. 
Leadf'rs of Mormon, Roman 

Catholic and evangelical 
Christian churches support 
Proposition 22. Three Southern 
California bishops -Episcopal, 
Lutheran and Methodist ­
issued a joint statement oppos­
ing it, saying it could lead to dis­
crimin a ti on. On Friday. the 
Roman Catholic priest who 
heads the Los Angeles 
Arc:hdioc:ese's ministry to gays 
and lesbians also publicly 
opposed it. 
Huffman titled his sermon 

"The Bible. Homosexuality and 
Proposition 22." 
"God c:alled his people to sexu­
al purity -a man and a woman committed to each other," he said. 
Church elders at St. Andrew's voted last month to support Proposition 22. 
"We feel. as Christians. we should be taking a stand on that, a loving stand, and basical­1y be supporting marriage br-tween a man and a woman," said Pam Metherell, 56, an elder. 
The issue was on the minds of 200 Mormons gathering at a suburban Sacramento church for a monthly sac:rament meet­ing. Churc:h member John Tennant urged the c:ongregation to pray for Proposition 22's pas­sage. 
In liberal San Francisco. a forum at an Episcopal church failed to attrac:t any proponents of the measure. 
San Francisco Supervisor Mark Leno, who is gay, called the proposition "mean-spirited," pointing out that gay marriages aren't allowed in California. 
"It's a completely bogus argu­ment," he said. 
California does not allow same-sex marriages, and that won't change whether Proposition 22 passes or fails. The measure would keep California from recognizing same-sex marriages allowed elsewhere. 
No other state allows such marriages, but proponents argue Vermont is close enough to make the initiative a neces­sary preemptive strike.

Infec:tions contracted in hospitals kill as many as 88,000 people· each year, a number that c:ould be reduced with inc:reased use of technol­ogy and simple measures suc:h as more frequent hand washing, a researcher said Sunday at a conference on the problem.

Last Wednesday, a l'\otre Dame stu­dent r,hucke<l an empty watM bottle onto the court in the closing seconds of the men's basketball game against Syracuse. which prompted the referees to whistle a techni­cal foul on the Irish and potentially cost them the match and a berth in the NCAA tournament. 
rpersonally believe that whoev­er supplied that particular person with the water bot­tle should be pun­ished. After all, ifit can happen at Notre Dame, it can happen anywhere. 
That's about the silliest thing you've ever heard, right? Now, read that last paragraph again and replace "water bottle" with "gun" and "Notre Dame" with "Columbine" or "Mount Morris Township, Mich." Odds are many of you would believe that statement then. 
By no means am I equating th<' tragedies of school violence with the travesty of the Syracuse game. I'm sure I speak for the team when I say that when compared to Columbine or Mount Morris Township (where a six-year-old boy shot a classmate last week), the result of the game last week or its implications -or even the game in general -become minutely insignifi­cant. 
However, some connections can be made. The water bottle itself isn't to blame for Wednesday night's incident. 
Whoever sold the water bottle isn't. The NWBA, National \\later Bottin Association, isn't. Scenes from video games or music videos or movies where water bottles are thrown aren't. The only person at fault was the kid who threw the water bottle. !\lo one disputes that. But when two teenagers plot for over a year to murder their fellnw stu-dents, fingers arc pointed at the guns, whoever sold them. the NRA, video games, MTV, Holly,vood -in short. anyone and everyone except Dylan 


Klebold and Eric Harris. 
When a six-year-old grows up in a decrepit home environment surrounded by guns and drugs and then shoots Kayla Holland, a six-year-old classmate, President Clinton blames the Hepublican-led Congress: "They have done nothing and meanwhile ... every single day there are 13 children who die from guns in this country." 
Gun control advocates believe that their programs can prevent future Columbines. But the 20,000 gun laws that are already on the books haven't stopped anything. What makes them so sure lhat the 20,001 st law will work? 
The plain and simple truth is that it won't. Rough and easy proof: The four areas with the strictest gun control laws in the nation are New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, 
D.C. Fourteen percent of America's murders occur in these havens of gun­control legislation. Why is that? Well, the phrase may be trite or stale, but "when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns." Common criminals can get weapons as easily as fans can get watc1r bottles -legislation or no legis­lation In areas where it is next to impossible for law-abiding citiznns to exercise their Second Amendment rights, the criminals have the market cornered. 
But where guns are less restrictnd, crime goes down. Professor John Lott of the University of Chicago noted that "when state concealed handgun laws went into effect in a county, murders fell by 8.5 percent, and rapes and aggravated assaults fell by five percent and seven percent [rr,spectivclyJ." In fact, the reason why a school rampage in Pearl, Miss. ended was that Joel Myrick, the assistant principal, went to his car to get his gun. 
So what can be done? Step one is to proporly prosecutn illegal uses of firearms. A Syracuse University study found that from 1992 to 1998. prosecu­

tions of illegal uses of firearms dropped 
46 percent. However. prosecution has 
to be done without punishing rnsponsi­
ble gun owners. 
In 1997, criminologist Gary Kleck estimated that more than 2.5 million people a year defend themselves lawful­ly with firearms. But no one ever hears about this fact because of the din of the constant drum-beating for gun-control legislation targeted at responsible gun owners. 
ror example, President Clinton's lat­est brainchild are so-cal!Pd "smart guns"-firearms electronically protnct­ed so only the adult owner can use them. Why is this even an option'? If the motlrnr of the six-year-old in Michigan was a responsible gun owner, these gadgets wouldn't have been necessary. If irresponsible gun owners were pun­ished properly, there would be no need for this legislation. 
The Washington Times states. "What matters is who has his hands on the weapon -not the weapon itself." It sounds so simple: throw a water bottle, you're to blame, you get punished; shoot someone, you're to blame, you get punished. 
When I was a kid, I was always told that "when you point your finger at someone, you havP three lingnrs point­ing back at you." Gun-control activists should heed this advice instead of con­tinuing to push worthless legislation while blaming everything else for today's gun problems. 
Mike Marchand is an a.ff-campus junior English major who belieues we should find the guy who threw the water bottle on Wednesday night, then throw things at him while he's taking his midterms. This column appears every other Monday and his e-mail address is Marchand.3@nd.edu.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Don't discriminate in church 

There are very few tinrns in my life when J have felt so out of place as I did Saturday at the 5 p.m. mass at the Basilica. I felt more ostraci.t:ed than when I went to mass in the crypt church covPrnd in paint from Christmas in April last year. This time I was not covered in paint, but when l walked into the Basilica there WPre several pi~ople in tuxedos and fur coats. This was the weekend to recognize scholarship and fellowship donors. 
Now, I don't have anything against this group of people. In fact if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't be :it Notre Dame today, What I am against is the ushers asking everyone who was not in formal attire, "Could you please sit in the side aisle today, the center section is reserved." 
I cringed in disgust every time one of the ushers had to sav this, so did the ushers. This was not plannee!" by the ushers, or by the donors. In fact, all the donors who were sit­ting next to me were extremely nice. 
I kept thinking about the Dark Ages when the peasants had to stand way at the back of the church and were not allowed to partake of communion, especially of the blood of Christ. 
The Basilica is a small church. How impor­tant is it that someone sits in the center aisle, or five feet away in the side aisle? Generally, I am proud to be a Domer. I like telling people how great Notre Dame is and what wonderful people live, work and study here. As I spend more and morn time here, there are many instances that make mo ashamed to be a Domer. These include tossing an octopus, a fish and a frog (who almost caused a little girl to lose an eye) at_ football games. insults towards our athlete classmates, derogatory comments aimed at players from other schools in basketball and hockey games and tossing water bottles on the court at basket­ball games. I realize that this is the minority of lhe student body, but they are still repre­sentatives of our University. They are the rot­ten apples that give everyone here, and the University of Our Lady a bad image. 
Saturday I had to watch as people who wanted to get to mass early and get a good seat were asked to leave their seats to make room for the donors. Is there something wrong with this? While I realize that the gen­erosity of the scholarship and fellowship donors should be recognized, and that these wonderful people deserve respect and admi­ration, this should not be done by making members of the Notre Dame and South Bend community who do not have the resources to be so generous feel inferior.

Reaction to 'Waterboy' is shameful 
One can't attribute final outcomes in reality to "what-if' scenarios that could radically change the path of'the outcome. 
Does the thrower's rash act of civil disobedi­ence warrant death threats? Does it warrant perpetual threats of being b<'aten? Does it warrnnl threals and harassing phone calls made to his parents? llis parents, for (~od's sake! (Humor has it they had to shut down their phone to escape the calls.) The l.hrower can't go to his room anymore; he's staying elsewhere lo avoid being harassed. His room­mates no long<lr have the use of a phone dufl to tlrn inabilit;-to escape the perpetual stream of malevolent solicitations. Stanford locked its doors early this wePk to avoid lynchers coming 
The thrower is not a bad person. The stu­dents have not done anything on the court that deserves the scrutiny that they have received recently. .Just remember to act with a little ml>rc class after the game has ended. It is. after all, just a game.

Farley boasts history of cherry bombs and smokers 
l\iinc out of 1 O Notre Dame students associate the word ··smokers" with Farlr,y Hall, locatr.d on North Quad, rn,xt to the ;\/orth Dining Hall.

()ther Farlev residents erho this fear of b(ing typecast. "It's not as if every person in thic; dorm smokes." says sophomorn Susan \VislPr. "Om' girl in my section dopsn't." 
I!all ro-prcsident Jenny Gerari notes that the little front porrh slwltPring nicotine addicts is not tlw only remarkablr. thing about Farlr.y Hall. 
"We are a close dorm with many great activitit1s and a rich history." she says. 
Farley Itall. after its opening in 1942, housed 200 freshmen men. In the pre-mod quad days, it was thought to be almost off-rampus. The male residrnts ""ere not known as smokers. but instead got the n:putation for having thr healthiest legs on campus because of thr. long walk to South Dining Hall. a full 965 str.ps by onf' resi­dent's count. 
Father Theodorr. 1-lesburgh, among various othrr accomplishments. was the first rector ol' Farley. At the timr.. Fathrr Hesburgh divided his time bAtwAen writing a book. tear.bing four classes. heading the Theology department and taming the freshmen mr.n -the last perhaps the most daunting of the tasks. This yAar at a Farley Mass. Father Hesburgh related the story ora hall r.onflict from the early days. Some unknown perpPtrator set off a cherrv bomb in the stairwell. Father I!P-sburgh gathen·d all of the boys in the hall together for a mAet­ing, explained his intolerance for this type ol' bfllrnvior and pulled out his own supply of cherry bombs. a rather large box. lie threatened to set off one cherry bomb cvnry hour on the hour until the guilty party came I'or­ward. It seems that the Farlev men valued their sleep becausP the cherry bomb prriblem promptly ended. 
No cherry bomb problems have plagued the curnmt rer.tor. SistPr Carrine Etheridge. but she sp8nds her time keeping the women busy. Like most dorms on campus. Farley can boast a number of' inlr.rhall sports teams, Sunday and weekly Masses and various service activities. Besides the smokr,r slereotypP, thP rest of campus knows Farley best for Pop Farley WPnk. This week. named in honor of Rever<\nd Farlev. consists ol' Mass and activities. wlminating in a very el,{boratcly dr.corated <lane.A on Saturday.

Farley residenLs fr.el very centrally located on campus. with short walks to LaFortune, the library, Rolfs and the North Dining l lall (although on nice days many girls still make tho 9(>5 stnp trek to South for tlw arguably bntter food!.

Tho '.'Jotro Dame basketball team will nut be the only team nervously awaiting the NC.M's decision as to who advances to the championships. Many members of the Irish track and field squad a w a i t 1v1onday's announcc­menl by 
the NCAA 
about who w i 1 1 advance to next weekend's indoor cham­pionships. 
Going into the Alex Wilson Invitational, several of Notre Oarne's top athletes wen' hop­ing to get the extra inch on their jumps or the fow seconds off their times to make it to Urn national championships at the University of Arkansas next weekend.· 
AftHr Saturday's meet, the only sure spot is held by the men's distance medley. The team broke the meet record of 9 minutes. 43.18 seconds with a time of 9:39.40. and missed tying the school record by one second. 
The team of Phil Mishka, Chris Cochran, Tim Kober and Luke Watson is now ranked second in the nation and is looking to win the event at nationals. 
"Running with competition, which we really haven't done yet, will definitely help," Cochran said. "Looking at the competition, we have to lnok to win. I think we're in strik­ing distance cit' Stanford. Anyone can step up in a national meet. I think we can step,,up as much as anyone else. 

Going into Saturday's meet, the team wanted to take a couple of seconds off its time to secure its spot in nationals. 
"I think the main differencfl with Friday's porformance was that we all knew we had to run a little better than last time to ensure getting in the national meet," Cochran said. "And we all had experience in the events. 
Last time it was Watson's first timo in his leg [of tlrn race] and I'm sure the 1200 was new for Mishka." 
Marshaun 'Nest was one of the long jumpers hoping to qualify on Saturday. lie need ed a jump or ai least 25-foot-6 to ensure the championships, but only jumped 24-foot-5 on Saturday. 
"It had to do with the level of competition and also my health wasn't 100 percent," West said. "I'm just going to concentrate on outdoors_.. I'm going to try and stay healthy and work on my technique and not get hurt." 
He has a provisional qualify­ing mark in the long jump, but will have to be in the top 15 in the nation to go. It will be announced Monday evening who will advance. 
Along with West, high jumpPr Jen Engelhardt and long jumper Tameisha King wern hoping to get the dis­tancn needed to get into nationals. 
Although Engnlhardt's jump of 5-foot-9 and 3/4 was a pro­visional qualifying mark for the championships, it may not give her the necessary edge. 
"I don't think Tameisha and Jenny will get in," fields coach Scott Winsor said. 
Winsor believed that the competition is tougher this year than in previous years and that may affect who quali­fies. 
"IThe field] is prelty compet­itive," Winsor said. "It's an unusual year, I would say. Usually it takes 180 !inches in high jump] to gpt in, bnt this year it took 182."

400. Patty Hice also has a qualifying time in the mile, and Alison Klemmer in the 3000. 
"I hope they all go," he said. 
Monday's announcement will tell if they'll be· packing their bags for Kansas next weekend.

Thn lloyas were unable to get any closer than 17 points in the second half and Notre Dame cruised to its largest margin of victory in a confer­cmcr game since the 1996-97 season. 
"We gol thoroughly out­playrd in every phase of the game -defense, rebounding, shooting," Georgetown head coach Craig Esherick said. "Our offense stunk up the place and Notre Dame had a lot to do with that. We got our butts kicked today." 
The Irish did an excellent job crashing the boards, as they outrebounded the Hoyas, 
51-2()_ 
"W<> wern trying to work on that in practice and we made sure we did a good job of doing that," sophomore power forward Troy Murphy said. "Coach really stressed that a lot in the pre-game talk. He said that was going to be a big part of the game and we did that well." 
All seven Notre Dame play­ers who scored shot over 50 percent from the field. Murphy, the conforence's leading scorer and rebounder, led the way with 23 points and 1!'i rebounds. 
Sophomore David Graves also had one of his biggest gamrs of the season. pouring in 14 points and grabbing 13 boards. 
Senior point guard Jimmy Dillon dished out nine assists, 
while Martin 
Tngelshy and 
early on. Kevin 
Rraswell and Lee Scruggs. two of Georgetown's leading scorers, werr both 2-for-11 from the field and combined for just 11 points. The Boyas shot just 30 percent for the game and only knocked down 5-of-26 shots (19 percent) from behind the arc. They also struggled from the foul line, making just 9 of their 17 attempts. 
Demetrius Hunter had a team-high 14 points, while Ruben Boumtje Boumtje grabbed 11 rebounds. 
With the win, the Irish close out the regular season with a 17-13 record and an 8-8 mark in the conference. Notre Dame locked up the No. 7 seed in the Big East Tournament ­its highest seed ever -and will play No. 10 seed Rugers on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. at Madison Square Garden.

Men defend title at Mid"7ests 
. Women fall to Northwestern, take second 
By MIKE CONNOLLY 
Sports Writer 
Jan Viviani was in trouble in the deriding hout of the 2000 Midwest Conference team epee championship. 
With the score tied 2-2 in his bout with 0 h i o State's G e o f f Kane, the freshman cpeeist began to lose his balance and fall off the edge of the strip. He quickly recov­ered and stabbed the Buckeye to score a touch and take a 3-2 lead. Viviani went on to score the next three touches and win the champi­onship for the Irish. 
"I think it was when I almost fell off the strip and still got a touch -that was the deciding factor in the bout," Viviani said with a smile. 
The men's fencing team was all smiles Saturday as the Irish won each weapon en route to the overall title. 
In the finals, the foil squad cruised to a 5-1 victory over Cleveland State while the sabre squad blanked Wayne State for the title. Only the men's epee team had a chal­lenge in the finals. 
The Buckeyes surprised the Irish as they opened up a 2-0 lead with wins over Viviani and Brian Casas. 


"The first two bouts that we Jost kind of surprised me," Gaither said. "Our guys are definitely good enough to come back." 
The Irish quickly recovered to win the next four bouts to take a 4-2 lead. The Buckeyes, however, would no go down easily -winning two bouts over Casas and Gaither. 
With the title on the line, Viviani, who finished second in epee wins for the Irish this season, wrapped up the bout despite his near slip. 
In foil, the Irish rolled to victory -winning 15 bouts while only dropping two. Ozren Debic, Forest Walton and Steve Mautone led the Irish in the finals. 
Mautone clinched the title with a 5-4 win over Tamir Strowder. 
On the sabre side, the Irish cruised through the quarter­finals and semifinals relying mostly on reserve fencers. In the finals, however, the Notre Dame starters returned and dealt Wayne State a 5-0 loss. 
Irish No. 4 sabreman Matt Fabricant fenced the decid­ing bout for the Irish against Mark Mathias. Mathias, who finished in the top 8 in Sunday's individual champi­onships, jumped out to a 3-0 lead on the freshman. 
Fabricant never panicked, however, and won the next five touches to clinch the championship for Notre Dame. 
"I think it is a testimony to the fact that he is a really good fencer," sabre captain Clay Morton said about Fabricant's victory. "He got a few bad calls against him so he just refocused. He forgot about the bad touches and 1999 Midwest Championship as Northwestern won the epee and sabre titles along with a second place finish in foil to win the championship. 
Alt.hough Irish managed to top the Wildcats in foil, the sabre team lost in the finals while the epec team lost to Cleveland State in the semifi­nals. 
Notre Dame jumped out to a 4-3 lead but could not win the deciding bout as both Kim DeMaio and Anna Carnick lost consecutive 5-4 bouts. 
"We had some equipment problems early but it was no excuse," DeMaio said. "There was zero leadership on my part as a captain and it came down to the last bout which it never should have come down to. All excuses aside, we just didn't fence the way we should have." 
Although DeMaio went 0-3 and Carnick went 1-2 against Cleveland State, freshman Meagan Call led the Irish with a 3-0 record. 
"Megan Call was great," DeMaio said. "It's just too bad that Anna and I couldn't come up with the other two wins." 
In foil, the Irish fell behind 2-0 to the Wildcats before Magda Krol defeated Maggie Kebrdle 5-0 to kick off a run where the Irish won 5 of 6 bouts to take the match. 
Northwestern, however, got the best of Notre Dame in the other head-to-head match as the Wildcats won the women's sabre title 5-2. 
Freshman Natalia Mazur won both bouts as the other starters, Carianne McCullough and Katie Flanagan, struggled against the No. 1 sabre squad in the country.

Penn upsets top-seeded Nowak in title fight 
By BILL HART Senior Sporrs Writer 
Fans gut Llleir money's worth in ono of the mos1 antiripatr.d fights at the Joyce Center on Friday evening, when Sean "The Frir Kiel" Nowak facPd off against Don "The Destroyer" Penn for the 165 lb. division title. In likely the most balanced bout of the night., Penn came l'rom bAhind to take a split deci­sion and shock the top seed. 
Both lighters came out aggrns­siwly in the early rounds, each dPpending on the same styles that had gotten them through the semifinals on Tuesday. Penn relied on the left jab and hard right. whilP Nowak used high­low combinations and boxed his opponrnt within the ropes. 
"I had to be aggressive, bccam,P l knew ho was a strong boxPr," Penn said about his strategy. "I needed to be [aggrnssive] continually through­out the course of the fight." 
After trading blows through the first two rounds, Penn con­nectPd with a strong right hook that sent Nowak staggering. But the top seed recovered, respond­ing with a hook of his own that sent Penn to the mat midwav through the round. · 
"I was surprised," Penn said about the blow. "He took a lot of punclrns, and yet he was able to come bark like that. I-lo threw a lot of punclrns, and hP didn't scfnn fazed by the punches I was throwing." 
By the time Penn brushed himself off with a standing eight count, both fighters wern so tired that neither could land another solid blow. The crowd came to its l'er,t for the fight's conclusion. drowning out the final bPIL

Keough sophomore Marc Criniti ar.complishrd a frat fr.w boxers can claim when he bPat out both the first and second seeds to earn a division title. 
After defeating Tom DeSplintr,r in the snmifinals on Tuesday. he completed his improhablH road to a champi­onship with a split decision win over Joey "Socia Pop" Leniski in the championship bout. 
With two left-handed lightPrs, this bout proved to be different for Criniti than his previous fights. 
"For the whole time this year, he and I wen) sparring against right-handers, proparing for fights against them." he said. "We really didn't have any expe­riPncc against loft-handed oppo­nents: Ii was pretty awkward." 
The contender came out early with hift-right combos in thci center of the ring, and came back from an early deficit in the first round. Lcniski seemed unable to connect with the jabs he used so frequently in the ear­lier bouts. and Criniti used that to prnss his advantage even more. Aftc~r a vicious flurry in the second round, Leniski lost his balance and stumbled to the canvas.

"I was starting to get a little more tired in the third round," Criniti remarked on l!rn come­back. "Joey was really starting to come af"ter me at that point, too. I just had to keep moving and using my jab, just lrying to score points."

After defending his top seed from freshman Chris Pearsall in the semifinals, senior Mike "Honey" Hammes proved he had what it takes to do it again and earned a split decision over sophomore Kevin "Hardcore" Brandl.

"I knew he had a better reach," Joyce said. 'That made it pretty hard for me to get inside on him. He tried to pre­vent me from staying inside for most of the tight" 
Hobbins seemed to be unable to recover from those early blows. With .Joyce's endless assault. the Keenan junior was unable to both defend himself and time his punches effectively. A big right hook in the second round by Joyce gave him a com­manding lead, but he had to also stop one of Hobbins' patented third-round comebacks to pre­serve the victory. 
"I knew I had a slight lead in the third," Joyce said. "But I also knew I had to keep things up. He was a pretty tough fighter, and hr, really rame at me in the third. I didn't face that in my other two fights."

In the third round, Hammes landed two powerful left hooks bnfore backing away from a potentially disastrous barrage from the challenger. While Brandl was able to anticipate multiple combinations from tlw top seed, IIammes' offensive ver­satility def'oated Brandl in the end.

Using a combination of agility and caution, Keonan junior Peter "Beat the Hap" Hyan ended the night with a textbook display of boxing tact, beating graduate student Dan "Lpt Me" Adam by unanimous decision. 
Adam came out strong, look­ing for a heavy hit to knock the top seed out. I!is aggressiveness paid off early on, with a set of punches putting Byan on the ropes. 
But after the initial fireworks ended, the junior captain settled into this game plan: aller wait­ing for Adam to mako his move, Hyan would wait for tlw threat to pass and pummel his oppo­nent before he had a chancn to put his guard back up. 
"I played a littlP conservative because he's such a big, strong boxer," Hyan said. "I wantnd to stay away from his punches and just play off his mistakes." 
In that style, tlw champ got many shots in early on, prompt­ing the ref to stop the light early in the second round when Adam's face was dripping blood. Hyan eventually wore Adam out, prompting some wild round­abouts from_ the challenger throughout most of the third round. 
"I don't think it was frustration more than it was exhaustion." Ryan said about Adam's move­ments. "Wn were both prntty tired by the third round. The guys in my corner were l<\lling me to stay away, and he still had a powerful blow at that point."

Northwestern head fencing coach Laurie SchiIJer could tastP virtorv. 
There was no way his fencer, Kellie MacDonald, could lose. She had an 8-5 lead over Notre Darrw freshman Anna Carnick with just 12 sPconds remaining in the bout.

"That is men­tal toughness." Notre Dame head coach Yves Aurinl said about Carnick's win. "That's very unusual to come back and score three touches. That shows something." 
Carnick showed that, despite being just a freshman, she. has the poise and toughness of a seasoned veteran. After taking a 5-3 lead into the final period, she lost five straight touches to fall behind 8-5. Instead of pan­icking or giving up. she just took a deep breath, reevaluated her style and started her come back. 
"I knew how I had beaten her before and I kind of lost focus for a while," she said. "So I just needed to concentrated on the action. I knew that she was stronger but I was quicker so I had the advantage with a little bit of time left." 
Camick's first Midwest cham­pionship was the second cham­pionship of the day for the Irish. Just minutes before Carnick won her title, Ozren Debic defeated tPammate Forrest Walton to win the individual foil title. 
Debic lr.d Walton 10-7 before Walton battled back to close the gap to 1. 11-10. That was as closo as Walton would got how­ever, as Debic wou the next four touchfls to win the bout. 1 5-11.

"I have beat him before so I think in Regionals I will defi­nitely take him," he said. 
In addition to defeating Szelle, the 1999 Midwest Champion, in the semis, Crompton faced a tough battle in the quarterfinals against junior Irish All­American Andrejz Bednarski. 
"I don't really like fencing teammates," Crompton said. "But I use that as an advantage. I know how they fence but they also know how l fence."

"Coach gave me some advice and I took that advice," Viviani said about his change1 in strate­gy after the first two rounds. 
Viviani, however, did not stick to his new strategy in the dos­ing minutes and lost the bout 15-13. 
"I changl'd up and started act­ing like an idiot." Viviani said. "I just relaxer! and I thought I was going to win." 
As victory slippml away from Viviani in tho !\pee finals. senior Magda Krol and rreshman Liza lfoutsikaris each dropped their bouts in the women's foil semi­finals.

Abdelnour came back swing­ing furiously, and he did land some damaging hooks that bloodied Mellin. 
"At first I felt pretty good, especially aftr,r the knock­down, but he came back after that. He's a really hard hit­ter," Mellin said. 
Mellin avoided getting into trouble in the third, fighting more conservatively to earn the decision.

By the third round, Dobosh was in control, countering Mchan with jabs and straight rights that almost knocked off the helmet of his foe, leading to a standing-eight. 
"I love the counterpunch. but he didn't charge so I had to be the aggressor, and that's not my style," Dobosh said. "In the third [round], he felt he had to come to me. so that worked well." 
Dobosh was especially thrilled to meet Muhammed Ali after his victory. 
"I met [President] Clinton, and that was nothing, but [after meeting Alil l was in total awe," he said.

In a battle of surprise final­ists, Chris "My Nickname Was Excised" Matassa needed just over a round to take the title in a technical knockout of P.J. "Downtown" Duwors. 
What became apparent early on was the significant reach advantage of Matassa, which he used to land several dam­aging hooks and capitalize with uppercuts when Duwors put his head down. 
The second round began with more of the same, as Matassa landed jabs and hooks at will. The fight was stopped 29 seconds into the round for what appeared to be only an interruption for bleed­ing, but Matassa was soon declared the winner.

MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Graves' play opens door to Notre Dame's success 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN AssiSlant Sports Ediror 
WASIIINGTON. D.C. 

Notre Dame men's basketball coach Matt Dohertv snid Saturday that sophomore David Grav!ls· play in the paint is a kPy ingrcdiPnt in the recipe for Notre !Jame success. 
"You know Troy [Murphy] is going to compete," Doherty said. "You know Harold [Swanagan] is going to compete. You know IYan [Kartelol is going to compete. David's the key, I think. to our front-line. and he really came out and bat­tled and boxed out." 
ff Graves is the kev, thP door to victory is wide-open for the Irish following Grawis' tremen­dous pr,rforrnance against Georgetown. 
The 6-foot-6 forward domi­nated the boards for the Irish, lighting his way to every loose ball. His 13 rebounds. 10 of them on the defensive end, kept Georgetown from connecting on sPcond and third chance shots. They also helped :",J'otre Dame gain a 51-29 rebounding advan­tage in its final regular-season game. a 77-54 victory on the road. 
"I was most impressed with their rebounding," Georgetown head coach Craig Esherick said. "I knew they were a good shoot­ing team. but I thought they rebounded the ball very well, particularly Graves. They beat us to every loose ball, outhus­tled us." 
Graves averages just 4.9 rebounds per game, but provid­ed fans with a glimpse of his power potential, nabbing 12 rebounds against Vanderbilt in December. 
Because Graves is not the pri­marv rebounder for Notre Dam·e. his extra rebounding against Georgetown gave the blue and gold an unexpected boost. If one rebound equals a two-point basket, Graves' "bonus" rebounds prevented a 16-point swing in favor of the Hoyas. 
"To get 13 rebounds -you know, the whole team compet­ed," Doherty said. "But he

[Graves] was very imprnssivc." 
Graves added 14 points rm tho offensive end. one morn than his spason average. As in rebounding, Craves !ms had his ups and downs in scoring. rang­ing from a rock bottom of three points in a loss io Maryland to a high of 33 in Notro Dame's overtime loss to VandPrbilt. 
Graves was six for 10 from the lield against. the I loyas, hit.­ting shots from all over tho floor. He muscled his wav inside for three lay-in shots· in tlrn paint. lie hit two short jumpers from opposite views of the hoop. And he mitted his 66th 3­point field goal of the season, the third highest total in school history.
"We had seen what the teams have done to us," Graves said. "They've really jumped on us and got in the lead. We just wanted to come out tonight and just jump on thorn. so I think we did a great job today. We played the best basketball wo've playeel all year." 
Graves' line of statistics in Saturday's box score didn't show a single goose egg. Ile recorded two steals. two blocks and one assist. On the down side, he also gave the ball away three times. The most telling statistic, however, is that Doherty was pleased enough with Graves' play to keep him on the court for the entire 40 minutes of the game. Graves didn't get a rest from the open­ing tip-off until the final buzzer. 
"This one's just rewarding," Graves said. "It's rewarding to get a win like this and in the fashion that we did." 
Notre Dame's second-leading scorer behind Troy Murphy, Graves is a guy who builds on momentum and. unfortunately. slides into ruts. 
Every game he scored in dou­ble digits has led to a string of high-scoring games. Likewise, each game he has been held lo single-digit scoring, with the lone exception of fast week's nine-point outing against Syracuse, has been followed by another. 
The 14-point performance at Georgetown followed nine points versus Syracuse, so it should bn the l"irst of s,weral double-digit gamrs. With Graves in a rhythm, tlrn Irish can count on solid shooting and rebounding. 
When lw gPts into a groove, Graves is tlrn go-tn guy for tlrn Irish. 
In the pm-season NIT, he hit a jump shot at the buzzpr lo hand Notre Dame tlw victory ovnr rnlurning Final hmr team Ohio State. Last month, Craves knocked down a jumper with .3 seconds remaining to give Notre Dame a 76-74 win over Seton Hall on the road. 
Although just a sophomore, Graves plays a commanding role for the Irish. After Notre Damn's two-point loss to No. 9 Syracuse Wednesday, a deter­mined David Graves promised that his team would not give up on the rest of thn season. 
"This team has a lot or char­acter," Graves said. "We're not going to quit." 
One of Graves' primary goals in coming to Notre Dame was to bring Notre Dame back to its glory days -the days of sold out crowds. excitement on cam­pus and regular trips to the NCAA tournament. He's been helping the Irish to deliver, as fans have returned to the Joyce Center in droves and the Irish have beaten five top-25 ranked teams. 
With the Big East Tournament beginning Wednesday, the Irish need a tournament title or at least a strong run to stand a chance of going to March Madness for the first time in 10 years. 

"We still have chances for the NCAA tournament," Graves said. "We're going to keep working hard. We're going to come out with a lot of intensi­David Graves looks for an open player in Saturday's win over ty." Georgetown. He finished with 14 points and 13 rebounds.

into March. And they knew it began Sunday, with a first-round Big East tournament game against Miami. 
The Irish overrarne their own poor shooting early on and a tough Miami defense through­out to emerge with a 67-52 vic­tory. But by the way they played against the llurricanes you could ha\'e sworn their l'ocus was elsewhere, presumably on a rematch with the Huskies in the final on Tuesday night. 
"We had a week to prepare but we didn't have a week to prepare for Miami -we just had a dav to do that," hear! coach Muf'f'ot McGraw said. "I think it was hard to focus on just one wam." 
That lack of focus almost hurt the Irish, 
"We took a coupk days nff of practice !this week(," McGraw said. "13ut I think it looked likti we took the week off."

Looking at the crowd on Senior Night at the Joyce Center Fieldhouse, one might have seen a few fans crossing their fingers. But with the events of Notre Dame 2 
the paSt MichiganState2
week, Irish hockey fans had many reasons to be ner­vous. 
While Notrn Dame did hold a two-point l1rnd on fifth place in the CCII/\ and the last playoff spot played on their home ico, sixth-place Ferris State had two games of its own against 10th-seed­fld Western Michigan. 
Meanwhile, Notre Dame was taking on l\·lichigan State, which holds the top pr,nalty killing and power play units in the conference. Even worse, the Irish onlv had 16 healthy skators to put on the ice against the Spartans, aftM sophomore David Inman was declared likely to miss the rost of the season due to illness. 
But through the emotions of the eight seniors, possibly playing their last home games at Notre Dame, the 
Irish Parned a 2-2 tie against the Spartans, good Pm>ugh to secure home ice for the first round of the CCIIA playoffs when combined with a loss by the Bulldogs·on Friday. 
"You don't like to have things out of your control." Poulin said about the playoff picture. "The ideal situation would have been for us to win tonight and tomorrow night, but you takP all tlw help you can get in this league. Home ice is a big advantage for us. We like this building and w11 play well at home." 
The Irish dodged a few bullets oarly in the first peri­od, including a Spartan pass which slid through the blue circle, after freshman goalie Tony Zasowski was puslwd away from the net. Both teams traded shots until tlrn 14 minute, 50. second mark of the first. when ldt wing Dan Carlson went coast-to­coast. evading two clefond­ers, en route to a scorn
