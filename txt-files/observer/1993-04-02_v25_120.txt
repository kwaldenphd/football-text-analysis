BOG revises smoking policy 
By GWEN DUFFIELD News Writer 
The Saint Mary's College Board of Governance (BOG) will vote next Monday to approve a revised smoking policy that restricts smoking in public areas. 
The proposed policy, which would take effect next year, was prompted by a survey con­ducted on March 25, in which 
73.8 percent of Saint Mary's students voted to prohibit smoking. If BOG votes to ap­prove the policy, the proposal will be submitted to the Senior Officers for approval. 
"There was a lot of concern voiced by students and the Board of Regents about the ef­fects of smoking, so we con­ducted a residence hall survey that would accommodate those students who didn't smoke," said Karen Fordham, Resident Hall Association (RHA) presi­dent. 
According to the new policy, smoking will be permitted in student rooms as agreed upon by roommates and in the vend­ing areas of each residence hall. There will be no smoking allowed in all other public areas in the residence halls, including, but not limited to, laundry rooms, bathrooms,

Handicapped students push administration for campus access 
By NICK RIOS News Writer 
Monday, 7:58 a.m. A student hops down the stairs of her dorm, races across the quad, sprints up a flight of stairs and slides into her seat in a classroom on the second floor of O'Shaughnessy just as eight chimes ring out from the bells in Sacred Heart. A typical way many students start a Monday-that is unless you are a physically handicapped student at Notre Dame or Saint Mary's. 
Handicapped students are finding some areas and buildings on campus difficult to access, according to freshman Alejandro Montoya. 
"I would say that overall, the faculty as well as the general population of this University make it a very happy and lovable environment to live in, but as far as their efforts for making the University fully accessible to disabled students, they have not yet reached their full potential," said Montoya, who is physically disabled. 
While many of the newer buildings on campus can easily accompany handicapped stu­dents, many places need to undergo some sort of remodeling to make them accessible for all students, Montoya said. He cited LaFortune Student Center and the Administration Building as two examples of buildings at both extremes of accessibility for handicapped persons. 
"Metal door knobs, special bathrooms and fountains, and elevators make LaFortune fully accessible," he said. "But the Administration Building is a constant reminder that we can not move around the building without the help of

INSIDE COLUMN 

Your unfriendly barbs don't hurt; I love Indiana 
I'm a Hoosier, and I'm damn proud of it. 
In my nearly three years on this campus, I've heard more crap about my state 
Shayne
than I could possibly recount. Generally it's in Bushfield good fun, but most of you Viewpoint Copy interlopers have an Editor arrogant attitude that this -------­state just doesn't quite measure up-isn't quite as cool-as your state. Well, I'm here to inform you right now that there is no state more excellent than Indiana. 

Allow me for a moment to examine some o your home states; you who have yet to waste an opportunity to obscene the state I hold so dear to my heart. Firstly, let's look at Minnesota. Sure, everybody likes lakes, and Minnesota accents are fun to listen to, but the weather makes even South Bend feel like a tropical resort. 
How about Florida? Okay fine, nice weather, beaches, sun, pleasure, The Magic Kingdom. But one drawback ruins it all: too many old people. The poor quality of health care in Indiana make the average life expectancy something like 50 (unofficial figure), so old folks are not a problem here. 
My most vocal anti-Indiana critic hails from New Jersey. I find it ironic that I sometimes defend my state to someone from New Jersey. 
Most complaints that we Hoosiers hear about Indiana are really complaints about South Bend, and usually I can see where they're coming from. I come from a small town a little south-east of Indianapolis, where the literacy rate is almost 50% and the people are still debating whether they should join the war (The Civil War; for the South). In fact, a tiny little town near mine seceded and never officially re­entered. My Indiana is much different than the Indiana found at Notre Dame. 
Where I live, life is much simpler. Give a real Hoosier a stick, a whittling knife, corn on the cob, and some teeth, and he'll be happy. Oh, and a TV. 
Back home, everybody watches Hoosier Lottery, that is unless an IU game is on. Where I'm from, people are such big IU fans they even bleed red. I need not mention how important basketball is to a Hoosier's livelihood. God has a name-Bob Knight. No argument will be accepted. 
Some Indiana critics have only been exposed to Michiana, and perhaps, on a drive to Chicago, the pleasant experience that is Gary. While these places have much to offer (your guess is as good as mine). the true Hoosier Heartland is downstate. 
Many people complain about the terrain here, but southern Indiana actually has hills, and pretty nice ones at that. Plus, they aren't littered with trash and nuclear waste and hypodermic needles. Hoosiers have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of, geographically. I'd rather lie in the grass beside a tall cornfield than be stuck in traffic in a Cement Hell any day. 
So, for all of you arrogant jerks who find it necessary to complain about Indiana, think again. You may think this state is boring, but that is probably because you are boring. To me, Indiana is the essence of greatness.

NATIONAL President Clinton crjtjcjzes Perot 
 ANNAPOLIS, Md. -President Clinton rebuked former presidential rival Ross Perot on Thursday for criticizing his chief of staff, declining to endorse his economic plan and perpetuating stories of anti-military bias in the White House. "You know, Mr. Perot came to Washington the other day 

and attacked my chief of staff as not being a real business person," Clinton said during a question-and­answer session with members of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. "And he had to call him on the phone and personally apologize the next day. I mean, people can say anything from the podium." Clinton also wondered aloud why Perot, who ran for president last year largely on a platform of reducing the federal budget deficit, had not endorsed Clinton's economic plan, which includes a five-year, $496 billion deficit-cutting measure. ''I'd be more interested in why my economic program, which is 85 percent what Ross Perot recommended in the campaign -except we raise taxes less on the middle

Wild tigers face extinction 
 WASHINGTON-Wild tigers face extinction in less than 10 years if effective measures aren't taken to stop increasing poaching for Oriental medicines, the World Wildlife Fund said Thursday. On the 20th anniversary of Operation Tiger, a successful India program to protect the animals, the fund said tiger populations have increased on the Indian subcontinent. But the world's tiger population has been reduced to about 7,000, with just 2,000 remaining in their main Asian habitats. Fifty years ago, 100,000 tigers roamed the earth. The population has been devastated by hunters seeking their bones for Oriental medicines. Wildlife experts also are concerned about the loss of tiger habitat, since they require among the largest areas of land of any animal to survive. Tigers generally hunt alone, and each animal can require hundreds of square miles to survive. Among threats to the tiger are poisoning by cattle owners, commercial logging and agriculture.

Gender, genre alter views of media 
By DAVE HORAN News Writer 
Too often, interpretations of media ranging from movies to classic novels overlook the im­portant considerations of the gender of the author and the genre in which the medium is written, according to Mary Gerhart, visiting theology pro­fessor. 
"In the past, {readers') inter­pretations of texts generally slighted either gender or genre considerations," she said in a faculty forum based on her re­cently published book Genre Choices. Gender Questions. 
The current view among most scholars is that any read­ing of a book or viewing of a film or other medium involves analysis which arises from the reader and not the text itself,

In a recent survey by the Residence Hall Association {RHA) 97 percent of Saint Mary's students who responded said they wanted cable television installed in residence hall lounges and in Haggar Col­lege Center. 
Approximately 500 people responded to the survey, which was taken March 25. 
Eighty-four percent of the students polled said that they would like a Fox affiliate in­cluded with cable service. MTV was the second most-requested channel asked for by 80 percent of the respondents.

Patty Warfield, Holy Cross Hall director, said that next year's RHA board will meet in the fall of 1993 to develop a proposal for Saint Mary's to re­ceive cable sometime during the next school year. 
There are several ideas on how to utilize cable, such as the possibility of forming a news­study group that would meet and discuss events on CNN, ac­cording to Warfield, an advisor to RHA. 
"I think students should get cable because of the current events that have been happen­ing in the past few years," said according to Gerhart. The crucial role of interpretation still does not receive enough recognition from many people, including students, she said. 
Gerhart, visiting this year from Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, New York, explained that after sitting on several panel discussions, she is convinced that interpretations of texts most often fail due to a failure to integrate both gender and genre analyses, which work in inverse relation to one another. 
Warning against "overgendering," that involves interpretations that fail to fully consider the structural and more traditional aspects of a text, Gerhart explained, "We all know that something which is politically-correct can still be a lousy text," 
1 1Lenten Special1 1 Partx Pack 11 1... 14" Large 1 1 4~14 L~rge 1 I I Cheese Pizza I I 1 Topptng I 
Gerhart cited a recent debate published in The New York Re­view which featured critic He­len Vendler against critics Su­san Gubar and Susan Gilbert. 
"Vendler recognized the dis­tinction between great texts and lesser, period pieces, and that was an important distinc­tion to be made." 
Likewise, overgendered in­terpretations focus too much at­tention on structural consid­erations and ignore the texts' interdisciplinary settings with regard to gender and other is­sues, she said. 
Gerhart explained that she never realized how many dif­ferent genres and genders exist until she began researching her book. 
"The sheer plurality of gen­ders needs to be made more of than we normally do," she said. 
RHA President Karen Fordham. 
Fordham added that students might eventually receive cable in their dorm rooms but that it will not happen for a while. 
"I think cable is a good idea to have in the hall," said Liz Holzemer, a sophomore in Mc­Candless Hall. "However, it would be even better if we all got cable in our rooms." 
The Long Range Planning Coordinating Committee re­cently recommended the im­plementation of campus-wide cable in the residence halls in its tentative recommendations for the College. The report is­sued by the committee said that cable television would open up opportunities for students and increase revenue.

Europe faces difficult trip toward integration 
By ROB ADAMS News Writer 
Although European integra­tion was a popular idea a few years ago, current crises in Eu­rope have prolonged the inte­gration of the European com­munity by creating nationalistic barriers, according to Antonio Menendez, professor of sociol­ogy at Indiana University. 
"Most Europeans feel that with increased international interaction national identities might be lost," Menendez said. 
"Recently, Europe has shown the illusion of a promising fu­ture, but high unemployment Antonio rates, the 

Menendez
increasing number of refugees, and disenchanted farmers have resulted in nationalism that is almost fascist, as in the neo­Nazis of Germany." 
Attitudes in Europe vary from country to country and from person to person, accord­ing to Menendez. 
"Great Britain is reluctant to give up any sovereignty," he said, "they like to check how the pound is doing against the dollar." 
Great Britain, however, would benefit from further integration because the biggest investor in Great Britain is the EEC, according to Menendez. 
"Germany has always sup­ported the European union, especially since reunification," Menendez said. 
"However, eighty percent of the German citizens reject the idea of losing the mark. They want some kind of 'German Europe' but they don't want it immediately." 
While Germany supports the integration, France is resisting the idea due to reasons of both national pride deep-seeded fear of the Germans. 
"In France, a large part of the population do not want integra­tion," said Menendez. "The French elite are mainly in sup­port of European integration, but the common people are against it." 
Menendez believes that most citizens have stubborn French pride and want to live indepen­dently. 
"They fear that the European community will raise their taxes, destroy their farmers, and then destroy France," he said. 
The situation in Spain is very similar to France in that the elite are in favor of the integra­tion, while blue-collar citizens and farmers reject the idea. 
Presently, only forty percent of Spain supports European in­tegration, according to Menen­dez. 
"The Spanish worry that only the French and German cul­tures will survive because they 'hold the most weight' in Eu­rope," said Menendez. "They also worry that they will lose their regional cultures, as many Spanish people have already adapted to foreign ways," he continued. 
All European countries are so mixed already that they cannot avoid the action of the European integration, but they have a very long way to go, ac­cording to Menendez.

66.9 percent cf students wished to see smoking prohibited in the 2nd floor and 24-hour lounges in the library. 
"We found that the faculty was in favor of prohibiting smoking in public areas which shows the need for a change, and we don't want to infringe on their rights since they use the facilities on campus also" said Melissa Whelan, Spiritual Life Commissioner. 
The current policy limits smoking to all vending areas, one lobby area in each hall, all student rooms except on floors designated "non-smoking," and the hallways in Le Mans and Holy Cross Halls. 
"We are hoping that by next year we can get the policy im­plemented because the per­centages show there is enough concern," said Tricia Wallace, RHA president-elect.

Offering an alumna-donated motor scooter, a free parking pass to Notre Dame Stadium on football weekends and several keys to ground level entrances, Saint Mary's accommodated Wallace's handicap. 
Wallace said one of her biggest obstacles came in the form of a door that was com­pletely unaccessible to handi­capped persons at Le Mans Hall. But Wallace said help was only a phone call away. 
"Anne Marie Jordan (Le Mans Hall director) would come and open the door for me any time, but I couldn't have gotten into LeMans by myself," she said. "I felt bad having to be that dependent on everyone, but so many people were going out of their way to make ac-about the nature of the facilities the administration is consider­ing to upgrade facilities for handicap students. 
"I know that the administra­tion is coming up with plans to fix some of the problems, but I wonder if they are coming up with plans that satisfy what we need?" he said. "It would be nice if they could show us or maybe even consult us to see in exactly what areas we would like to see improvements." 
However, Montoya said many disabled students are not con­cerned with overwhelming construction changes. Instead, he said most students are con­cerned with the little things-things which will simply help them become independent members of the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's community.

Clinton urges aid on eve of summit 
ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -In an impassioned plea for spending scarce tax dollars on Russian aid, President Clinton said Thursday that America should help "not out of charity" but as a crucial investment in peace and prosperity. 
"The danger is clear if Rus­sia's reforms turn sour, if it re­verts to authoritarianism or dis­integrates into chaos," Clinton said, two days before a summit with beleaguered Russian Pres­ident Boris Yeltsin in Vancou­ver, British Columbia. 
The world cannot afford to see 
Russia turn into a much-larger 
version of chaotic Yugoslavia 
"armed with a vast arsenal of 
nuclear weapons," Clinton said. 
He made his case in a speech before a convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, meeting at the U.S. Naval Academy. 
It was his most detailed dis­
cussion of the political and eco­
nomic crisis in Russia and what 
he feels is at stake for the 
United States. Clinton offered 
an unqualified endorsement of 
Yeltsin as the leader of reforms. 
"The success of Russia's re­
newal must be a first-order 
concern to our country," he 
said. 
Yeltsin, who narrowly over­
came an impeachment attempt, 
is looking to the West for money 
and technical assistance to ease 
Russian misery resulting in part from belt-tightening economic reforms. 
The Russian leader also hopes Clinton can boost his prestige before an April 25 referendum on who has ultimate authority: Yeltsin or the Communist-era Congress. 

The president urged Ameri­cans to be patient with Russia's faltering pace of reforms and said they should not be con­cerned by "every growing pain within democracy." He recalled that America's own history was marked by revisions of the Constitution and even fist fights in Congress. 
"You can't be so impatient about what's happened in the

short stretch of time from (Mikhail) Gorbachev to Yeltsin to the present crisis," he said. 
"Despite today's troubles, I have great faith that Russian reform will continue and eventually succeed," the presi­dent said. 
In a message directed to Russian listeners, Clinton said, "I speak for Americans every­where when I say: We are with you." 
Mindful of the unpopularity of foreign aid, Clinton said that many Americans, watching the budget deficit grow larger, ask, "Why in the world should we help a distant people when times are so tough here at home?" 
Answering his own question, he said, "We must act now, not out of charity, but because it is a wise investment. ... While our efforts will entail new costs, we can reap even larger dividends for our safety and our prosper­ity if we act now." 
He said America had spent trillions of dollars on the Cold War. "If Russia were to revert to imperialism or were to plunge into chaos, we would need to reassess all our plans for defense savings. We would have to restructure our defenses to meet a whole different set of threats than those we now think will occur. That means billions of dollars less for other uses"

Salvadoran killers freed by judge 
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -Two military officers convicted in the 1989 murders of six Jesuit priests left prison Thursday, freed by a Salvado­ran judge. 
Col. Guillermo Benavides and Lt. Yusshy Rene Mendoza were the first to benefit from a con­troversial general amnesty for human rights violators from the country's 12-year civil war. The amnesty took effect Wednesday. 
Both men were serving 30­year prison terms in the west­
ern city of Santa Ana. 
Prison Warden Juan Campos said Mendoza slipped out of the prison Thursday night to avoid a waiting crowd of journalists. Benavides left separately later. 
Many fear the amnesty will impede a U.N.-backed panel's recommendation that the ac­cused be punished and will close the issue of abuses before most Salvadorans learn the full story about them.

Attention 
approved by the National Assembly, which his rightist 
ARENA Party controls, the amnesty blocks criminal charges against Salvadorans who were named in the report as committing rights abuses during the country's 12-year civil war. 
It is not clear, however, if it also protects them from the punishments proposed in the report. 
The "Truth Commission" recommended, among other things, the dismissal of several military leaders, the replace­ment of the entire Salvadoran Supreme Court and a ban on political office for some offend­ers, including some leftist guerrilla leaders, for 10 years. 
The U.N.-backed report by a team of international jurists blamed the military and rightist death squads for about 95 per­cent of the atrocities during the civil war.

Defense rests in King beating trial 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -Defense attorneys in the Rodney King beating trial stunned a federal court Thursday by abruptly resting their case, a move one lawyer said was designed to unnerve prosecutors. 
Attorney Harland Braun, who had told Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Clymer he had 10 witnesses waiting to testify but then called none, said outside court: "I just wanted to keep Clymer up till 3 in the morning 
they can't deal with surprise." 
Braun and attorney Paul De­Pasquale, who represents former police officer Timothy Wind, halted the defense by resting without calling any fur­ther witnesses Thursday morning. 
The attorney for Officer Lau­rence Powell rested late Wednesday, canceling his client's expected testimony. 
The lawyers denied they stopped their case because sev­eral witnesses had backfired on them, most notably a highway patrolwoman who wept on the stand as she recalled the bru­tality of King's beating. 
"We got together and we decided less is better," Braun said. 
Braun denounced the prose­cutors outside court saying, "They're bad people, evil peo­ple.... They're overly anal peo­ple. They can't deal with sur­prise." 
"One thing I never forget when I deal with the govern­ment is this is a political prose­cution," he said of the racially charged case. "They indicted an innocent man, my client, for strategic reasons, not based on the evidence.... I assume they are scum and I treat them as scum." 
Of Justice Department attor­ney Barry Kowalski, Braun said: "He's just like an S.S. offi­cer for the civil rights division." 
Only one of the four white policemen on trial, the sergeant who commanded the March 3, 1991, videotaped beating of the black motorist, took the stand in the federal trial. Other defendants said Sgt. Stacey Koon adequately defended them. "Stacey Koon speaks for ev­
, eryone who's willing to accept responsibility for their actions," said Braun. "We salute Stacey Koon." 
He acknowledged his client, Theodore Briseno, disagreed with Koon's handling of King's arrest and testified so at the state trial, which ended in ac­quittal on most charges. That verdict set off three days of deadly rioting. 
Braun said Briseno joined forces with his co-defendants in the federal trial to deprive the government of a split defense. 
Braun expects the case to go to the jury by Wednesday. 
Clymer said he was unpre­pared to call rebuttal witnesses immediately because of the premature defense conclusion. He moved to play for jurors a two-hour segment of Briseno's videotaped testimony at the of­ficers' state trial. The defense objected and the judge did not immediately rule. 
U.S. District Judge John Davies also took under consid­eration motions by the four defendants to be immediately acquitted. Their lawyers said the government didn't prove its case. 

Attorneys fail to end cult standoff 
WACO, Texas (AP) -Two at­torneys met for eight hours Thursday with the leaders of a heavily armed religious cult and said they wouldn't go back, failing to end a nearly five-week standoff with federal agents. 
"We've done about all a lawyer can do now," attorney Dick DeGuerin said after a fourth day of face-to-face con­tact with cult leader David Ko­resh. 
He was joined for the first time Thursday by Jack Zim­mermann, an attorney hired to represent Koresh's lieutenant, Steven Schnejder. 
"We've answered all their questions. It's now decision time for them," Zimmermann said. "They understand what they're facing in the legal sys­tem and what their opportuni­ties are in the courtroom." 
The FBI had expressed hope earlier this week that contact with the lawyers would con­vince Koresh, a doomsday preacher who has claimed to be Jesus Christ, and his 96 fol-

lowers to end a 33-day standoff peacefully. 
"They are going to do it. Now it's just a question of timing," Zimmermann said. 
Schneider has led negotiations during the standoff while Koresh nurses wounds from the Feb. 28 gun battle that began the siege. Four Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents and at least two cultists died in the shootout when the ATF tried to serve search and arrest warrants. 
DeGuerin said Wednesday that Koresh's pain was slowing his work and asked the FBI to send in a doctor. The agency refused. 
"Our goal is not to treat ev­erybody in there and make them happy. Our goal is to get them out," FBI agents Bob Ricks said Thursday. "There's plenty of medical attention just a few hundred yards away." 

Tower bomb suspect released on asylum 
NEW YORK (AP} -The 
newest suspect in the World 
Trade Center bombing entered 
the country illegally but was 
released because he requested . asylum, an immigration official said Thursday. Now he's the ' su)lject of a worldwide search. .. Also Thursday, a Sept. 14 'trial datewas set for the fugi­tive, 25-year-old Ramzi Ahmed 'Yousefi''and three other men +charged in the bombing. The 
three others appeared in Man­
hattan's. federal court, relaxed, 
even laughing at times. 
Judge Kevin Duffy imposed a 
gag rule meant to stop leaks to 
the public about evidence fol­. lowing complaints by the de­fense. 
Lawyers entered innocent 
pleas for Mohammad Salameh, 
2.5; Nidal Ayyad, 25; and Mah­
mud Abouhalima, 33, the al­
leged organizer of the Feb. 26 
bombing that killed six people 
and injured more than 1,000 
others. 
As Duffy read the indictment, , Salameh shook his head vigor­¥ously at the allegation that the 
defendants damaged the 
world's second tallest buildings 
"Jly means of fire and an ex­
plosive."' 
Earlier, Salameh, of Jersey City, N.J., smiled at artists seated in the jury box as his lawyer, Robert Precht, relayed his request that they sketch him to look "like a human be­ing, not like a terrorist." 
All three men had been in­dicted before, but were re-ar· raigned on a new indictment that combined their cases with Yousers. 
Yousef, an Iraqi-born man who lived in Jersey City and has been described as a major player in the bombing scheme, is the subject of a worldwide search, said FBI spokesman Joe Valiquette. 
Immigration records show Yousef was once in the gov­ernment's grasp. 
Rosemary LaGuardia, a spokeswoman for the Immigra­tion and Naturalization Service, said he entered the United States from Pakistan in September but did not have a visa and was detained at Kennedy International Airport. Because he requested asylum, a hearing was scheduled and he was released. He did not show up for a hearing last week, she said.

Beauchamp details venture capitalism at ND 
By JOHN CONNORTON 
Business Editor 
Venture capital investing plays a crucial, yet little-recog­nized role in the nation's econ­omy, as well as private institu­tions like the University of Notre Dame, said Father William Beauchamp, Executive Vice-President of Notre Dame, at the College of Business Ad­ministration's annual Finance Forum. 
"Venture capital is an in­vestment in our country, our future, and our quality of life," said Beauchamp. "It is the business of building busi­nesses." 
Money raised by venture capitalists have allowed nu­merous fledgling companies like Apple Computers, Federal Express. Jenny Craig, and Mi­crosoft to grow into industry giants. 
Since 1980, Notre Dame has become a significant player in the field of venture capital in-

vestment, according to Beauchamp. 
"''m proud to say that we are recognized as one of the most knowledgeable venture capital investors in the country. We have been invited, with em­phasis on invited, to invest with some of the nation's largest venture capital firms." 
As proof, Beauchamp pointed to returns from Notre Dame's venture capital investments which averaged 19 percent an­nually, compared to 9.4 percent

Assistant Saint Mary's News Editor 
Saint Mary's Professor William Shannon attended a conference at the White House on Monday entitled "American Business: Meeting the Chal­lenge". 
Shannon was invited to join President Bill Clinton, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, and Secretary of Education Richard Riley to discuss the creation of jobs for America's youth. 
"I was excited to learn that Clinton and two leading mem­bers of his cabinet were inter­ested in suggestions and con­cerns of the business commu­nity in launching a successful program to encourage busi­nesses to offer summer jobs for America's youth," said Shan­non. 
On March 25, Shannon re­ceived a fax from Alexis Her­man, Assistant to the President of the United States, inviting him to the meeting. 
"This is the first fax from the White House anyone remem­bers getting at Saint Mary's," said Shannon. 
According to Shannon, the White House invited a small cross section of American busi­ness people, including representatives from large firms, mid-sized firms, and small firms, to participate. 
Shannon is not only a pro­fessor at Saint Mary's, but he is also an entrepeneur. In 1978, he founded the Hacienda Mexi-

William Shannon 
can Restaurants, and is now the chairman of the chain. 
In the past, Shannon owned and was the president of Avante Industries, manufacturers of food equipment, in Wheeling, 
IL. He was also the corporate vice-president of an international company called Berkel Inc., in LaPorte, IN. 
Shannon has been a full-time member of Saint Mary's faculty since 1983 in Business Admin­istration and Economics. He teaches marketing and inter­national business courses, as well as an entrepreneurship for women course. He is also a fac­ulty advisor for the Notre Dame Council for International Busi­ness Development. 
"I was excited for the oppor­tunity to represent the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame com­munity at the White House, as well as provide a small business perspective towards an obviously worth-while pro­gram," said Shannon. 
The conference was held on Monday in the East Room of the 
for bonds, and 12 percent for stocks. 
Beauchamp emphasized that the University shies away from high-yield, but risky invest­ments. "We don't look to the short-term in our endowment. As an institution in perpetutity, we look to the forever, if you will." 
Notre Dame is currently in­volved in eighteen limited part­nerships with $57 million dol­lars in committed capital. Ven­ture capital investments, which now make up 65 percent of the University's investments, are important for the diversification of Notre Dame's $730 million endowment, said Beauchamp. 
"Our venture capital goals are two-fold. Our primary intention is to outperform the public equity market. But almost as important a goal is our tertiary goal, to reduce our endow­ment's volatility. Basically, we're hedging our bets." 
Notre Dame became involved in venture capital investment right when the field finally be­gan to attract public attention, during the 1980s. 
"Until the 1980s, Notre Dame's investments were plain, vanilla stocks and bonds. Then we committed $4 million to a venture capital investment and received back $8 million," said Beauchamp. 
Since then, Notre Dame has never looked back. 
"We recognize venture capi­talists as one of the principal fa­cilitators of change in the world. They start often from scratch, the ground level, the very beginning, and transform an idea into reality," said Beauchamp. "We at Notre Dame realize we have the op­portunity to contribute to the nation's economy." 
James Blair, a partner at the venture capital investment firm of Domain Associates, and Jacqueline Morby, senior gen­eral partner of TA Associates, also spoke to the Finance Fo­rum. 
Bentsen: Clinton administration won't budge on energy tax 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Trea­sury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told business leaders Thursday the Clinton administration won't budge on its proposed energy tax, but he listened with interest to their plea for more investment incentives. 
Top officials of the National Association of Manufacturers, in an hour-long private meeting with Bentsen and senior deputies, complained that the proposed tax on energy ranging from gasoline to coal to electricity would amount to a tax on production. 
It would put U.S. manufactur­ers at a disadvantage with their overseas competitors and hurt the administration's effort to create jobs, they said. 
Stanley Gault, chief executive of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. of Akron, Ohio, said the tax would add $1 to $1.50 to the cost of making tires in the United States, hampering his company's efforts to compete against Michelin of France and Pirelli of Italy. 
Bentsen, however, refused to budge, saying the administra­tion believed its proposal treated all regions of the coun­try equitably and that manufac­turers' energy costs would only increase from 2.6 percent of total production cost to 2.7 per­cent. 
In a statement accompanying details of the energy tax re­leased Thursday, the secretary said the administration would, as much as possible, encourage the cost of the tax to be passed on to consumers. The depart­ment said tax penalties would be exacted against utilities whose state regulators do not allow them to pass the tax on to energy users. 
Also, in a concession to the Northeast and Midwest, the department said it would tax fuel oil at less than half the rate of gasoline and diesel fuel. In new estimates, it said the im­pact of the tax would range from $124 per person in New England to $102 per person in the East South Central states ­Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee. 
The manufacturers argued that a value added, or national sales, tax would be better than an energy tax. Bentsen said a value-added tax was a possibil­ity, but not this year. .._ 
White House. Vice-President AI Gore was called on to replace President Clinton, who had to leave town. 
"Vice-President Gore expertly lead the discussion in the absence of President Clinton who left the White House unex­pectedly due to the acute illness of his father-in-law," said Shannon. 
According to Shannon, the group discussed creating summer job opportunities for college students who have the energy and potential to work. It was acknowledged that stu­dents who get out of school in May or June may lose some ac­quired skills before returning to school in September. 
"It is a positive activity in trying to use the economy to help American youth continue to learn," said Shannon. 
Shannon said that it was his impression that the officials were sincerely interested in the group's comments and sugges­tions. 
According to Shannon, he was invited to participate be­cause he had been on The United States Government Na­tional Advisory Council for Small Business Administrations. Recently, he was appointed by Congressman Tim Roemer to the White House Conference for Small Businesses, to be held at the beginning of next year. 
Shannon said it was very nice to participate, and he also felt he made an important contribution.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

'It happened to me, and it could happen to you'
How could this be, especially with the men at Notre Dame? After all, they come from stable families which instill traditional Catholic values, one of which is to be humanitarian. They are clean-cut and handsome. You know, good ol' American boys. They would never smoke a joint if it was the last thing to eat on this earth.

V. It's easy, don't listen. 
What I am trying to convey · and what the college is trying to convey to you is really fiction. This does not happen, espe­cially at Saint Mary's and Notre Dame. You're still safe. Don't listen to just anything you read. I didn't. 
A Survivor Dear Editor: 

In opening the Observer yesterday, I was amazed to see an issue that has been plaguing my life for 3/4 of a year. That issue is rape -there, I said it. No one knows but a rape victim what that word does to you. How it grates on your teeth to even say it. When the word is said in passing, you look around because you know that they know. You feel it, their eyes pouring in on you noticing the change in your face that you try so desperately to hide. 
This was not supposed to happen to me and it shouldn't happen to anyone. Everyone's rape experience is different. Perhaps that is why it is so hard to come forward and say that yes, I am a victim. Because there is no straight definition of what a victim is. That is why I have been so afraid to go for

With the help of a close friend, I am going to get help. This has been hurting me too long. It has been hurting a relationship that I care about. 
The last thing l want to say is this: Don't be fooled or led astray because you go to a Catholic institution like Saint Mary's or Notre Dame. Don't believe that it won't happen to you. Because it will if you aren't careful. I am no different than you. If you were to see me, you would see no scars. But I am injured deep within my heart. 
It happened to me. It could happen to you.

The 'Absolute Truth' is justifiably questionable 
Recent weeks have shown that religious extremism, generally thought to inhabit only places outside the United States, such as the Middle East, is alive and well here in the good old US of A. Although the motives are still not clear, it appears that Islamic fundamentalists tried to blow up the World Trade Center. Next we have of a wacko group in Texas, headed by someone claiming to be the messiah, which has stockpiled massive amounts of weapons with the result being that, so far, four federal agents and at least three group members are dead. Then, a doctor was killed in Florida because he provided a constitutionally protected ser­vice for women. 
What all these instances have in common is that those who committed the acts of violence believe that they possess the ultimate, Absolute Truth and that whatever they do to bring about their version of the truth is justified. Absolute Truth defies logic and limits; it allows an individual to justify his or her actions without regard for the consequences, whether it means blowing up an airplane or office building, assassinating a doctor, or psychologically terrorizing people. Anything goes because this is what Allah or God or Jehovah wants. 
A type of extremism has existed to a certain extent here on campus, but we and the rest of the community are faced with it head on as South Bend is inundated with college students from around the country who have decided that they have nothing better to do on their spring break than come to Northern Indiana to get arrested. Thus, it is timely and appropriate to examine some of the extremist positions and activities undertaken by various factions of the anti-choice movement. 
A couple of quotes from Randall Terry, founder of Op­eration Rescue, the most well known anti-choice group, should serve to underline such extremism. In 1990 he said: "...we are in more danger than we were then [1986], we are even teetering more towards severe chastening and judg­ment, and we may have passed the window where America can be restored without bloodshed." Thus, while disavowing violence on other occasions, he seems to be saying that his Absolute Truth is leading his movement towards justifiable bloodshed. Another quote, from 1989, will illustrate the irrational persecution complex which he, and others, uses to justify his actions: "I've read and reread Jeremiah lately, and I encourage you to do the same. I have come away seeing the frightening reality that op­pression, tyranny and destruc­tion are stalking the church and the nation. In a few short years, we may find ourselves hiding in the hills to protect out families, or locked up in huge holding facilities. We may find our churches seized, closed or burnt to the ground; our chil­dren being taken by the state, our women violated; terrorism on American soil; a national economic collapse so great that you may have to spend your

life's savings for a loaf of bread; drought and famine so severe that people actually degenerate to cannibalism." Such apocalyp­tic views (which, by the way, can also be seen nightly on channel 46) create a climate which breeds extremism and violence. This quote also seems to indicate that any form of government other than theoc­racy is seen as oppressive and a violation of the Absolute Truth. 
This extremism includes a wide range of activities. The recent murder of Dr. Gunn is the first in what may be a growing trend. And the responses to the murder are indicative. When hearing of the assassination, protesters out­side another Florida clinic re­portedly shouted "Praise God! Praise God! One of the baby­killers is dead." John Burt, the regional director of Rescue America, the group to which Dr. Gunn's murderer belonged, and a former member of the Ku Klux Klan, said: "We don't condone this, but we have to remember that Dr. Gunn has killed thousands and thousands of babies." 
If he were truly serious about not supporting such tactics, there would be no "but," no qualifier whatsoever in his statement. And, the head of Rescue America, while dis­avowing such activity, set up a fund, not for the victim's family, but for the person who carried out this crime. 
One level below murder have been the various fire bombings of women's clinics, including one clinic and two doctor's offices in Pensacola. Various forms of psychological violence have also been committed against doctors and other members of clinics and their families, as well as patients and 
·their families. Dr. Gunn and other doctors have had their faces, addresses, and telephone numbers put on "wanted" posters, certainly an indirect incitement to violence. These doctors and other clinic workers have been harassed and terrorized at home and work -including death threats (which is ironic since the movement calls itself "pro-life") -and have had vandalism done to their property and clin­ics. Clients of clinics, both those seeking abortion and those not, are terrorized at home. For ex­ample, anti-choice activists copy down the license plate numbers of women who go into clinics and then use contacts in the department of motor vehi­cles to illegally find out their phone numbers and where they live. Then, they are harassed at home and their relatives and ministers are informed that they were at a clinic where abortions are performed. Being on a mission from god apparently justifies harassment and intrusion into other people's private lives. 
Finally, a few thoughts on the immediate impact of anti-choice protest. Here in South Bend, police erected a fence around the clinic which CALL tried to shut down. The head of CALL said this was unnecessary and a waste of taxpayers' money. submit that the real waste is that which is spent on extra police, jail and judicial activities to protect women from these people who come in from outside to harass others. Further, CALL complained that Notre Dame was losing its catholic character because it would not put them up for two weeks and provide them with meals and a base from which to launch their illegal activities, and because the administration allowed people such as Bill Clinton and Jesse Jackson, who are pro-choice, to speak on campus. This further demonstrates the totalizing, anti-intellectual and anti-demo­cratic mindset inherent in those who believe they hold Absolute Truth. As President Malloy pointed out, this is a university, and part of being a university means allowing and encouraging discussion on a variety of issues from different viewpoints. Anything else means giving up our ability to think. 
Not all anti-choice activists engage in all of the above activities. However, the mindset which says that one knows Absolute Truth can lead just about anybody to justify just about anything -even murder. And even lesser forms of ha­rassment impose psychological violence, which, apparently, is okay with god.

The danger of judicial ac­tivism and the correctness of the conservative position can only be clearly seen at a dis­tance, as is demonstrated by an infamous example of judicial activism. In Dred Scott, Chief Justice Roger Taney decided, among other things, that blacks were clearly inferior to whites and were unfit to be anything but slaves. Taney's decision was based not on the text of the Constitution or any law, but on Taney's personal vision of social justice. 
Today's judicial activists differ from Taney only in their political opinions. They fully agree with his vision of the role

Catholic Worker House to hold fundraising hootenanny 
By MATT CARBONE Assistant Accent Editor 
Hootenanny, n. A gathering of folksingers with participa­tion, typically by the audience. 
This definition appears on fliers printed for the Holy Fam­ily Catholic Worker House of Hospitality. which will be hold­ing a hootenanny tomorrow to raise funds for the House. 
The Catholic Worker House is located in South Bend at 502 N. Notre Dame Avenue. Estab­lished in 1986, it provides tem­porary housing and food for families, usually single-parent, and single women -with a twist. 
The twist is that the House does much more than give transients a place to stay for a few months -it strives for last­ing social justice. 
"What sets us apart from a homeless shelter is that we are committed to nonviolence and simple living," said Jacquee Dickey, a volunteer at the House. "We have a more com­plete vision [than social service organizations]." . 
This complete vision is articu­lated in the goals of the House. In addition to providing food and shelter, these goals include "living in community with our guests following a simple lifestyle; accompanying guests

cial service agencies; and work­ing toward a just and lasting change in housing legislation for low-income families," ac­cording to Sister Suzanne Pat­terson, Holy Cross Sister and director of the House 
The House does many things in pursuit of these goals. In addition to providing each House guest (at present there are three families with a total five children, and two single women) with housing and food, the workers at the House, who are mostly volunteers, play with the children, accompany the guests as they work through the social services system and provide them with a sense of community while they get back on their feet. 


Everyone is welcome at the community meals, which take place on Thursdays at 6 p.m. 
Patterson also recently sat on a panel that discussed possible solutions to homelessness. 
Several Notre Dame students volunteer on a weekly basis, helping with the cooking, playing with the children and tutoring those who live in the House. 
"Their great service is atten­tion, affirmation and interest in the residents, said Patterson. "In return, students feel a connection [to the residents]. and see that the homeless are human, ordinary people." 
Allison McCarthy, community service commissioner for Walsh Hall, chose the Catholic Worker House as her dorm's service project. Every Monday, Walsh Hall volunteers go to the House to cook dinner and play with the children. 
"People really enjoy interact­ing with the people of the House," said McCarthy. "It's a good way to get involved in the community." 
Paul Pearl, a graduate stu­dent of sociology at ND and vol­unteer at the House, also wanted to get more involved in the community. "I was looking for a way to integrate my reli­gious beliefs, my support of disarmament and social jus­tice," said Pearl, who saw working at the House as a per­fect way to satisfy all of his wants. 
True to the ideals of the Catholic Worker movement (see sidebar), Pearl said that he is interested in getting into social justice work. "I would ulti­mately like to be an advocate for the poor and marginalized in society." 
Dickey is an "extended com­munity member" volunteer at the House -volunteers "that come to the House on a regular basis to help out, celebrate the liturgy, have dinner and do work for the House," said Dickey. 
In Dickey's case, this work is 
'Their great service is attention, affirmation and interest in the residents. Students feel a connection, and see that the homeless are human, ordinary people.' 
-Sr. Suzanne Patterson 
fundraising; she helped orga­nize the upcoming hootenanny. It will be performed by "Papa Joe" Taschetta, a travelling folksinger, originally from South Bend, who has been touring and performing for 27 years. 
Dickey met Taschetta several years ago when he was touring and performing in Iowa on be­half of the peace community and service organizations. 
"He will perform traditional folk songs, historically the way... the frustrations and struggles of American life have been recorded," said Dickey. "He will also play some silly songs for children that are kind of fun." 
The hootenanny will be begin tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. at the Unitarian Church, located at the corner of U.S. 31 and North Shore Drive, two blocks north of Memorial Hospital. Admis­sion is by donation, and items made by guests of the House will be given as door prizes. The show will end at approxi­mately 9 p.m. 
To receive more information about volunteering at the House, or about the community meal on Thursdays, call Sister Suzanne Patterson at 234-1196, or stop by the Center for Social Concerns .

Thomism 

at Notre Dame  Fall, 1993 
The philosophy department at Notre Dame is nationally ranked and world class. Among other things, it has, over the years, been noted for its contributions to interpreting and teaching the thought of St. Thomas Aquinas. 
It is not often clear what courses among the many excellent offerings in philosophy are designed to serve that interest. A brochure providing descriptions of the Fall courses which are Thomistic in inspiration has been mailed to Freshmen and Sophomores. 
Ifyou have not received the brochure, ask for one at either the Philosophy Department, 337 O'Schaughnessy or the Jacques Maritain Center, 714 Hesburgh Library.

Irish down Andrews; await MSU 

By KEVIN DOLAN 
Sports Writer 
The Irish men's volleyball team tuned up for a big week­end last night with a lively scrimmage against Andrews University (Michigan) in the Thunderpit of the Joyce A.C.C. 
Andrews was filling in for the University of Toledo, who was unable to field a team and can­celled. 
Although the Irish were ex­pecting a pickup team, An­drews proved to be more than solid. However, the Irish still bested them in four straight games (15-3, 15-13, 15-7, 15­8). . 
Game 1 was all Irish, as Brian Ceponis was having his way with Andrews, blocking or spiking nearly every ball that came his way. The Irish ran off a 9-0 lead before cruising to a 15-3 win. 
Former Irish head coach Kim Reefer was the guest coach last night, filling in for Jen Slosar, who had an exam. 
One move Reefer made was to insert Tim Regan and Matt Limtiaco, two freshmen who have seen limited playing time. Regan responded with his best performance of the season, blocking balls like a seasoned veteran. Limtiaco's perfor­mance at setter was also solid. 
In the second game, the Irish appeared to be asleep early on, falling behind 9-5. Poor hitting and mental errors combined to put the Irish in that hole, but they rallied behind a monster Regan spike and a well-placed tip by freshman outside hitter Bill Raney to take an 11-10 lead. 
Raney and Regan would con­tinue to pace the Irish, but the remainder of Game 2 was a struggle for the Irish, their winning point coming on a ball that just seemed to fall to the floor for the 15-13 win. 
The Irish returned to form in Game 3 behind the urging of assistant coach Dan Ka­vanaugh, who donned a jersey to fill in at setter for Won Suh. Kavanaugh had a tip and an ace as the Irish jumped out again, going up 6-0. 
Ceponis and Regan were the bright spots for the Irish in Game 3, and Pat Madden be­gan to come on late, serving up a kill and two blocks while un­veiling his jump-serve, a rare treat for the Irish faithful and an indication of how seriously the Irish were taking the match. 
The Irish frivolity continued into the fourth game. Ka­vanaugh set up Madden with a beautiful pass, and Madden promptly smashed it off the head of Matt Strottman, who was refereeing the match.

Light weekend for Irish tennis teams 
NCAA rule cancels men's match 
By JONATHAN JENSEN 
Associate Sports Editor 
You know things must be going your way when bad news is actually good news. 
Men's tennis coach Bob Bayliss was forced to cancel this weekend's match at West Virginia to stay under the NCAA limit for matches. The Irish played one more match than expected at the Blue-Gray Oassic, as they won all four matches and captured the championship. 
Though the cancellation of a match is usually associated with bad luck, both Notre Dame and West Virginia were rather happy to postpone their match until next season. 
"They have a couple of injuries and were facing a tough time," said BaylL'is, "So we determined it would be in both team's best interests to reschedule." 
The Irish players especially welcomed the cancellation after playing in the maximum amount of matches allowed in a season with many of them at such remote sights as Montgomery, Ala., Baton Rouge, La., and Austin, Tex.. 
"We've been on the road so long," cracked Bayliss, "That I think they could fllm a remake of "The Road Warriors" starring the men's tennis team instead of Mel Gibson." 
The players were given Monday and Tuesday off after getting in from Sunday's match at Louisiana State well after midnight. 
"They've definitely earned it," noted Bayliss. 
In addition to the rest the road­weary Irish will get, the extra time off will also allow Bayliss and assistant coach J.P. Weber to experiment with different combinations of their doubles teams, hoping to find the right chemistry before the NCAAs in May. 
"We will be working on doubles and also begin to work on conditioning," stated Bayliss. "We really need to do some additional things, including getting back to the basics and beginning to emphasize conditioning." 
The Irish will be back in action on Wednesday against the Michigan Wolverines, which will mark the la.'it home match for the Irish's five seniors. Will Forsyth, Chuck Coleman, Mark Schmidt, Hon Hosa.'>, and Chris Wojtalik will all look to end their home careers in style at 3:15 at the Eck Tennis Pavilion.

Women looking for 7th vs. A & M 
By RIAN AKEY Sports Writer 

If the 23rd-ranked Notre Dame women's tennis team is superstitious, then they must feel pretty lucky going into this afternoon's tennis match against Texas A & M. 
The Irish (12-6). winners of their last six matches, go for lucky seven today at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. By winning, Notre Dame hopes to hand the Aggies (6-9) their seventh straight loss. 
Despite the opposite direc­tions the two teams seem to be heading, Notre Dame head coach Jay Louderback cautions against overlooking the Aggies. 
"Their last six matches have been against some tough schools, and they've done pretty well against them," he said. "They only lost 3-6 to Mi­ami, who's ranked 14th, and 4­5 to Oklahoma State, a team on the fringe of the top-25. 
"Texas A & M started the sea­son not playing very well, and then they won a few matches, but now they've run into a tough schedule. Just before their recent losing streak, they beat a tough Wake Forest team that has been in and out of the top-25 all season." 
The Aggies top player is ju­nior Janine Burton-Durham, ranked 47th in the latest Inter­collegiate Tennis Association poll. Burton-Durham carries a 21-11 overall record into to­day's contest with the Irish. 
At number-one doubles, Bur­ton-Durham has teamed with senior Julie Blackburn for a 10-7 season record and an ITA ranking of 28th. 
The Irish will attempt to counter the Aggies number-one singles player with freshman Wendy Crabtree. Crabtree (19­

8) is ranked 78th in the latest ITA release and is coming off a 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 upset of Clemson's Boba Tzvetkova, the 58th ranked player in the nation. 
In addition to A & M's ranked player, Louderback points to some of the lower seeds as im­portant matches. 

"Last year, their three and four singles players (Anna Schlumpf and Christine Di­Nardo) beat Christy Faustmann and Lisa Tholen in good matches. This year, those two have been playing at five and six, so those should be competi­tive as well." 
The Irish's five and six spots will likely be filled by sopho­more Laura Schwab and freshman Holyn Lord who hopes to continue her 15-match win-streak against the Aggies. During the streak, Lord has lost only one set out of 31 played. 
The match, originally sched­ule to be held outdoors at the Courtney Tennis Center, has been moved indoors to the Eck Pavilion. 
"Having the match indoors should be to our advantage," said senior captain Eniko Bende, "because we haven't had much chance to play out­side yet this season, while Texas probably has." 
The contest with the Aggies will end a seven match homes­tand for the Irish, and they will not return to the Eck Pavilion until their last match of the season, an April 20 contest with Purdue.

QB picture still unclear 
By GEORGE DOHRMANN Sports Editor 
Questions will be asked, as­sumptions can be made, and opinions will be voiced, but six practices into spring drills the quarterback for the 1993 Notre Dame football team is as uncertain as ever. 
Head coach Lou Holtz and his staff are mum about who has the edge at this point in spring drills. 
"They have both done good things," said Holtz. 
"It will definitely be a dog­fight," said offensive coordina­tor Skip Holtz. "Physically they are both in great shape. They are great athletes. They both have surprised me in terms of their leadership role." 
One player who has an inter­esting view of the situation is center Tim Ruddy who will be snapping the ball to one of the two players as a member of the first team. 
"I here a lot about it (the quarterback controversy)," commented Ruddy, "but right now all I can worry about it the offensive line. Whoever is be­hind me is going to to a great job." 
There appears to be no ani­mosity between the two quar­terbacks, as both appear moti­vated by the chance to better the team. 
"If I am the best person, I should get it. If he is, then he should," said McDougal, "whatever is best for the team." 
"I have so much respect for both of them," said Lou Holtz. "They both understand the sit­uation. We are honest to them. All we want to do is give our seniors the best chance to win." 
Fans wonder if prize recruit Ron Powlus can step in and lead the attack, a possibility which was not ruled out by Skip Holtz. 
"If Paul and Kevin don't show that they can lead this team, then we will have to go into the fall and take a look at Powlus," stated Notre Dame's offensive coordinator. "How hard a look he gets depends on how well those two do in the spring."

because we have no linebackers," joked Minter. Moments later the second-year coach followed by saying, "Our front four are going to be pretty darn good." 
The real motivation for the change is to utilize the strength of the defense, depth and talent on the line. 
"I think it (the 4-3 defense) works best for our defense," said Young. "We have some experience guys and a lot of younger players with talent." 
Offensively the coaching staff is doing little changing, just at­tempting to see what hand they've been dealt, but they are trying a few new things in the way of offensive tactics. 
"If you are going to try something new, you do it in the spring," said offensive coordi­nator Skip Holtz. "We have been working on more under coverage reads instead of down field and some other things."

Love, Mom, Dad, Ben, David, Sadie, &Spook 
By TIMOTHY SEYMOUR Sports Writer 
In any sport, it usually takes a newcomer a while to become established and be able to com­pete with the better programs in the sport. Coach Tom Hanlon and the Notre Dame women's golf team hopes to continue their improvement with a strong performance in this weekend's Indiana University Invitational. 
, Established as a varsity sport in 1988, the team will get a good test of how far it has come this weekend against some of the better teams in the region including traditional Big Ten powers Indiana, Michigan, Iowa, and Ohio State. 
However, recent perfor­mances including earlier victo­ries over Michigan and Iowa indicate that the Irish are ready to be very competitive and def­initely improve on last year's disappointing last place finish in the tournament. 
The Irish hopes will rest most heavily on senior captain Kathy Phares who is coming off an impressive showing at last weekend's Western Kentucky Invitational with a strong 7 4 in the first round. 
''I've been very encouraged by Kathy's play. She's been my most consistent player for four years now," said Hanlon. 
However, consistency among the other four players making the trip will be key to how the Irish are able to finish. Hanlon notes that all are capable of scoring well in any given round, but cautions, "They need better 
concentration and can't throw 
away any shots." 
After playing two solid rounds 
in the Western Kentucky Invi­
tational, sophomore Katie 
Shannon will play in the second 
slot for the Irish, while fresh­
man Julie Melby, who played 
very well when the team trav­
elled to Florida, will be in the 
third position. The team is 
rounded out by juniors Alicia 
Murray and Chrissy Klein, both 
of whom are capable of scoring 
in the 70's or low 80's. 
Indiana comes into its own tournament as the favorite, with Wisconsin and Northern Illinois expected to challenge strongly. However, Hanlon was confident that if all five golfers · shoot as expected, improvement 
will continue.

"Stuart Tyner and John Smerek are looking better and better each week," said field event coach Scott Winsor. "We're looking for some improvement out of them. They still have not reached their po­tential by far."

In the jumping events, Brian Headrick, Tom Mescall and Todd Johnston will be competing in the high jump. The long jump will feature Ray Holder and Tom Mescall while Holder will also compete in the triple jump. Dan Grenough will compete at the Indiana Intercollegiates in the pole vault. 
"Ray Holder did a good job last week," said Winsor, "We're looking for him to improve." 
"This will be an excellent track meet," said head track coach Joe Piane, "I'm looking forward to it." 
Also competing this weekend will be Todd Herman of the Irish men's track team. Herman, however will be competing at the Texas Relays in Austin Texas . Coach Winsor is hoping that the high jumper from linton, Ind. will provisionally qualify for the NCAA's. There has been good competition at this meet in the past. Last year Herman placed fourth, with a jump of 7' V2". 
"Hopefully he can jump well and find some warm weather," added Winsor, "If he performs as he's capable of performing he'll do fine."

Perfect record in jeopardy as Hoyas visit ND 
By KEVIN MCGUIRE Sports Writer 

Just over halfway through the season, the Notre Dame lacrosse team is well on their way to achieving their goal of being undefeated heading into the NCAA tournament. 
Hut the 14th-ranked Irish (8­
0) encounter a possible pitfall to their untarnished record when they faceoff with 15th-ranked Georgetown (4-1) at 2:00 Sat­urday afternoon at Moose Krause Stadium. 
The Irish will be put to the test as they run up against a powerful Hoya team that de­feated them last year in Wash­ington D.C. 10-6. Notre Dame is looking at that loss to provide some inspiration. although Irish coach Kevin Corrigan denies that there is a revenge factor involved. 
"We didn't play too well last year, so it's up to us to earn their respect and show them our best lacrosse," Corrigan said. 
Notre Dame will have to bring all their weapons to the table on Saturday because Georgetown coach Dave Urick brings in a very talented and deep Georgetown squad that should cause some problems for the Irish. 
The Hoyas boast the potent combination of twin junior midfielders Andy and Mike Sco­laroney, who are up for All­American honors this season. "They are a midfield-oriented team that is very good at creat­ing transition opportunities that result from a solid defensive team," remarked Corrigan. 
Therefore the pressure will be on the Irish midfield to re­spond to the Hoya attacks with strong defense and hard riding to prevent their transition game from resulting in a lot of shots on goal. That task will fall primarily on the shoulders of freshman Rob Tobin and ju­niors Willie Sutton and Billy Ahmuty with senior Ed Lamb, sophomore Kevin Lynyak, and freshman Brian Erickson seeing considerable time. 
On attack, Georgetown looks to junior attacker Scott Musa who leads the team in goals scored this season, and is de­scribed as a "quick, dangerous scorer". The Scolaroneys also provide a good deal of offense once the ball is settled in the offensive zone, so the Irish will have to keep their eye on both the attackers and the middies. 

It will be the job of the defensive line of junior Garrett Reilly

In the offensive zone, the Irish will send junior attackers Randy Colley and Robbie Sny­der, along with freshman Kevin Mahoney, to challenge sophomore Kevin Gates in goal for the Hoyas. The Irish have been on an offensive roll of late, averaging nearly 18 goals a game over their last three games, and will need every goal to crack a notably tough Georgetown defense. 
Another interesting match-up on Saturday will be between senior faceoff specialists Chip Lonsdale for Notre Dame and Cliff Clancy for Georgetown. Last year Georgetown domi­nated faceoffs, along with ground balls, which allowed them to dictate the tempo of the game and frustrate the Irish offensively. To be successful on Saturday, the Irish will need to

the Hobart struggle which went down to the wire. Corrigan foresees a tough contest that 
should stay tight the entire game. 
"Georgetown is a deep, tal­ented team, so I anticipate some streaks for both teams, but it should be a long day be­cause the game will be closes," said the Notre Dame coach. 
Saturday's game is one that the Irish need to win to main­tain their long-term goals for the NCAAs, and one that will, once and for all, prove to the lacrosse community on the east coast that Notre Dame deserves a permanent place on the lacrosse map.
