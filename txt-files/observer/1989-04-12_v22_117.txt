Rape self-defense stressed 
By JOANNA GRILLO 
News Staff 
Amidst the growing concern about rape in the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's communi­ty,Campus Alliance for Rape Elimination (CARE) spon­sored a two-part presentation Tuesday, featuring discussions on date rape and self-defense demonstrations. 
Jerry Wroblewski from the Midwest Karate Academy in Mishawaka offered some safety and prevention tips with the help of some of his students. 
According to Wroblewski, the key to self -defense is awareness. Since the goal of a rapist is domination, it is im­portant for a potential victim to convey self-confidence. Wroblewski says to be aware of your surroundings. 
"Walk with your head up. Don't do things that will put you in a vulnerable situation-use your head. If you isolate your­self, you are putting youself in a potentially bad situation." 
Six of Wroblewski's students demonstrated physical self­defense techniques, stressing the importance of targeting vulnerable areas such as the eyes, hair, toe line, and groin. 
Wroblewski said that Karate heightens awareness and makes you more in tune with your body, more able to adapt. He does not suggest that you can become a self-defense ex­pert overnight, but he does in­sist that you can be aware, and avoid putting yourself in vul­nerable situations. 
Molly Meyer, a Saint Mary's senior, and Pat Credon, a senior at Notre Dame led a dis­cussion on datelaquaintance rape. Both students are affili­ated with Sex Offense Services (SOS), a 24-hour rape crisis counseling service that operates out of the Madison Center in South Bend. 
Both Meyer and Credon said that datelaquaintance rape is a widespread problem, although it may not be one that is well publicized throughout the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's com­munity. They stressed aware­ness and prevention. 
Much of the problem on campus is that most of the rapes that occur are not re­ported, and therefore other stu­dents are.unaware of the exist­ing danger. 
One student expressed a familiar sentiment, . "The schools are just avoiding the problem. It is up to students to put pressure on the schools-to get them to admit that these things do happen on these cam­puses. Just because there is a rule prohibiting sex does not mean that it is not happening." 

Another observer added, "This applies to your life out­side of school. It could happen anywhere-on the job, at an in­ternship, while you are home during break, any time." 
Another problem addressed was the false sense of security the students have. Because of the social stigma attached to rape, it is a problem that is not given enough attention in the NMMC community. One stu­dent said, "Notre Dame and Saint Mary's aren't so different that these things do not happen here." 
Awareness is one thing that CARE and SOS are trying to promote. Meyer said, "Rape is not a women's issue. It is a people's issue. It affects everybody.'' 
"It is something that both sexes have to talk about. It can-

experiences at the mall
Syrian gunners shelled Christian areas Tuesday in spite of a 6-day-old truce called by the Arab League, and Paris sent an envoy to work out a distribution plan for two shiploads of French humanitarian aid. Police said the howitzer shells landed in a scattered pattern in Christian territory and no casualties were reported. They said the Christians held their fire. 
The Soviet navy said Tuesday it plans to retrieve a nuclear submarine that sank off Norway to learn what caused the acci­dent that killed 42 sailors. "We consider that we must raise it," Vice Adm. Sergei Vargin said on the nightly television news program Vremya. Vargin, who is with the Soviet Baltic Fleet, said details of how to bring the submarine up from nearly 5,000 feet below the surface had not been worked out. 
U.N. troops opened checkpoints Tuesday in northern Namibia, but South Mrica said no guerrillas showed up to begin a withdrawal to salvage a U.N. cease-fire and independence plan for Namibia. Chief Inspector Kierie du Rand, a South Mrican spokesman for the territorial police, said groups of more than 50 black nationalist insurgents were seen heading south, disobey­ing orders from their exiled leader to withdraw north to Angola. 
NATIONAL BRIEFS 

President Bush's minimum wage plan was defeated Tuesday as the Senate moved closer to confronting him with a proposal he repeatedly has promised to veto. The Senate, on a 61-39 vote largely along party lines, backed an amendment to legislation sponsored by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., that brought the measure essentially in line with a House-passed bill calling for an hourly minimum wage of $4.55 by October 1991. 
Police found a mass grave just south of the Mexican border Tuesday containing the bodies of 12 people who were the victims of human sacrifice by a satanic cult of drug smugglers, officials said. "It was horrible," Cameron County Sheriff Alex Perez told a news conference in this border city. "It was like a human slaughterhouse." Mexican federal police arrested four people, said sheriff's Lt. George Gavito. Gavito said the suspects were U.S. and Mexican citizens, but did not identify them further. 
Vice President Dan Quayle will visit Australia, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand over a 10-period from April 26 to May 5, aides said Tuesday. Quayle will represent President Bush at this year's celebration of Australian-American Friendship Week, which symbolizes the historically close relations between the two countries and commemorates the Battle of the Coral Sea during World War II, in which U.S. and Australian forces overcame great odds to gain a military victory. 
INDIANA BRIEFS 

South Bend police say they cannot guarantee the safety of Alan Matheney in the St. Joseph County Jail, where he will await trial in the March 4 beating death of his former wife. St. Joseph Superior Court Judge William Whitman ruled Monday that Matheney should be held in the county jail, as his attorneys requested. Deputy Prosecutor John D. Krisor Jr. and jail officials wanted Matheney to remain at the Indiana State Prison in Mic­higan City, where he has been held for four weeks. 
We have a stereotype of the shopping mall containing dehumanized and faceless people going about their humdrum featureless exis­tence oblivious to the presence of others. Many people see nothing but junk to buy and robot-like salespersons to sell it. 
But, this conception of a modern day was­teland was shattered for me on Monday when I had a spiritual experience at the shopping mall (no, I did not buy a new wardrobe). 
The woman who permed my hair brought up the subject of supernatural phenomena by describing a mansion in South Bend that she used to clean. It was built in 1927 as a house to host international gambling. 
As the woman described the gambling room, I suddenly felt chilled (maybe from some per­ming solution). She told me that she saw a vapor of a person in that room one day while she dusted. 
Then, she went on to tell me about the spirit of her deceased friend walking around, clatter­ing pans and calling her name at night because she now lived in her friend's home. 
"What do you think about this?" she asked me. 
Well, I've never given much thought to vapors and spirits before and so I intelligently responded: 
"Un..., hum..., my sixth grade Girl Scout leader told me about a spirit in her house once during story time around the campfire. 
Next, she cut right to her out-of-body experi­ence telling me that she experienced the "black tunnel" when she was 18. 
"Aha," I thought, "I know something about this." I jumped in and told her "I just studied near-death experiences in my philosophy class." 
"Who's your professor?" she asked. "Professor Morris," I answered while think­ing "she's not going to know who he is." 
She totally surprised me then (but, I guess by now, I really shouldn't be shocked by anyth­ing she tells me). "I cut his hair once," she said. 
I began thinking "this conversation is going beyond weird." 
Because she was interested in what we were "itudying, I told her that we had just started

studying something about theism and evil. "Do you believe that evil exists in the world?" she questioned me. 
Again, I respond with my intellectually ex­cellent mind. "Well ..., ah..., I haven't really thought about it, we just started the section today." 
She tells me that she believes evil is very real in the world and it seems that the end of the world is near because of the diseases such as AIDS and cancer. "Did I know what the world was supposed to be like when the end of the world was proximate? Had we discussed it in class?" 
I told her that I didn't know what the world was supposed to be like then, and I didn't believe that we would study it in class. 
By now, I was feeling rather overwhelmed and bewildered. My stay of three hours was quickly coming to a close. 
As she finished my hair, she mentioned that she doesn't talk to everyone like she talked to me. She also expressed hopes that I would come back and we could have another discussion. 
I enjoyed talking to her and probably will go back (I kind of like the way my hair turned out), but, next time, I will not be astonished by the topics of our conversation. In fact, I will think about those issues before I go back. 
The mall is not only a place of people selling things. So the next time you go to the shopping mall, don't be surprised if something out of the ordinary, such as this conversation, happens to you.

Pow Wow planned 
By PETER LOFTUS News Staff 
The first annual Pow Wow, organized by Notre Dame's Na­tive American Club, was an­nounced Tuesday at the Hall Presidents' Council meeting. 
This educational event, which is sponsored by fourteen various campus organ iza­tions, is scheduled for April 16 at Stepan Center. 
One hundred fifty Native Americans from around the country, along with 26 Notre Dame Native Americans, will be at the celebration, which is scheduled from 10 a.m. to 7 
p.m. The events will include demonstrations on beading and basket-weaving, with the par­ticipants wearing their tradi­tional Native American gar­ments. 
In other business, an an­nouncement was made for the SUB's Anti-Apartheid Week. "Cry Freedom" will be shown, and the author of the book it was based on, Donald Woods, will give a lecture Thursday. Also, there will be an open­house at the SUB office on Mon­day, April17, from 6 to 8 p.m. 
Deadlines were set for appli­cations for various positions within the HPC. 
Also, any dorm that wants to apply for more money from the HPC budget is to submit an ap­plication by Friday, April14.

Panelists debate over University's divestment 
By JULIE RYAN News Staff 
In a panel discussion Tues­day, Professor Peter Walshe, Dean David Link, and Profes­sor James Carberry spoke on divestment in South Mrica. 
"This struggle has been going on a long time and has just gotten bad since the race riots in the 1960's and has never been as bad as it is now," said Walsh. Each member gave their opening comments, responded to questions posed by former Student Body Vice President Mike Paese, and then responded to questions posed by the audience. 
Walshe took the liberal side. He said that it is Notre Dame's duty to listen and support the blacks in South Mrica. 

W alshe emphasized the fact that the University's help can save the 35,000 black Mricans that have been detained with­out trial, remember 3,500 that have lost their lives, and give justice to those who face segregation and torture. 
Carberry took the conserva­tive side. His opening com­ments were that divestment is a "political and economic fol­ly" and he said that "apartheid is intrinsically evil." 
Carberry said that the South American blacks do not want the divestments of American corporations and that Americans have looked foolish by rushing in trying to help where they are not wanted. 
Notre Dame should not divest in South Mrica, accor­ding to Carberry. 
Link said that Notre Dame can be "effective in the area of education on apartheid." 
Notre Dame could invite black South Mricans and white South Mricans to debate the issue of divestments. Students and faculty could have a better understanding of the situation by learning about it from first sources. 
The panel was sposored by the Student Union Board and the Year of Cultural Diversity during Apartheid Awareness Week.

MOSCOW-Police arrested hundreds of people and were seizing tens of thousands of hunting rifles from Soviet Georgians in an attempt to calm the republic, which on Tuesday mourned 19 people killed in a pro-independence rally. 
Tanks, armored personnel carriers and soldiers patrolled the streets of the southern republic's capital, Tbilisi, to enforce a ban on public gatherings and an 11 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew. 
President Mikhail Gor­bachev said he considered it a "sacred" principle that Georgians and others should have the right to express their opinions freely, but said the law set limits on their actions, reported the head of West Germany's So-

Reports indicated a gen­eral strike that began Friday to back demands for Georgia's secession was easing. Some buses and trol­leys resumed routes Tues­day, said Nana Natadze, the wife of a Georgian nationalist activist. She said many schools remained closed because of a boycott. 
Tuesday was declared a day of mourning to mark what the Georgian Commu­nist Party leader, Djhumber Patiashvili, called "a com­mon grief"-the deaths of civilians killed in a clash Sunday with soldiers and police at the pro­independence demonstra­tion.

The current one-year lobQy­ing ban for executive branch workers would remain but would be extended to cover all agencies rather than just the one in which the individual was employed.

Weather improves for Valdez clean up 
Associated Press 
VALDEZ, Alaska-RouglY seas that helped stall and break up some of giant oil spill from the Exxon Valdez became cal­mer Tuesday and winds shifted away from fish-rich Kodiak Is­land, the Coast Guard said. 
"Kodiak still seems to be saved," said Jim Hayden, the state of Alaska's cleanup co­ordinator. 
Coast Guard spokesman Ken Freeze said the spill appears to have stalled and is breaking into tar balls. "That's better than ooey, gooey oil," he said. 
Equipment continued to pour into the area aboard military transports. About 67 tons of ma­terial, everything from con­tainment booms to absorbent pads, were scheduled to arrive Tuesday. 
A huge Soviet oil-skimming vessel, the Vay Dagursky, was expected to arrive Saturday, state officials said. The ship can skim 200,000 gallons an hour and store 2 million gallons of oil on board, according to the officials. But it remains un­clear how effective it might be against the Alaska spill. 
Despite the favorable wea­ther, a light sheen of oil seeped into the Kenai Fjords National Park at scattered inlets and fjords, Freeze said. With a thickness measured in molecules, the sheen does not threaten serious environmen­tal damage, he said. 
The Coast Guard said it planned to deploy a flotilla of

Coast Guard Capt. Joe Black­ett said tests Monday showed the nets break the oil into small globs, which don't reform. The operation may not begin until Wednesday, Blackett said. 
Much of the cleanup opera­tion so fAr has relied on floating containment booms. Cleanup crews ran into trouble when they tried to deploy a more per­manent boom at Sawmill Bill site of a salmon hatchery: Anchors weren't available in adequate numbers, Freeze said, and depth charts that hadn't been updated since the 1964 earthquake proved inac­curate.

Monday's  rough  weather,  

which saw seas to 15 feet, gale­force wind warnings and small craft advisories, turned calmer Tuesday. Aerial spotter flights resumed, seas reduced to 5 to 7 feet-still above normal-and winds shifted from the northwest. That could steer oil to the southeast and away from the coastline and Kodiak, the nation's richest fishing port last year.

North denies role 
Claims conduct not deceptive 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-Oliver North defended his honor and his efforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras Tuesday against a fusillade of sugges­tions from the prosecutor that he violated the code he was taught at the Naval Academy. 
"At the U.S. Naval Academy you would have been kicked out for this?" Prosecutor John Keker asked at one point. 
"In the U.S. Naval Academy nobody taught me to run a covert operation," North retorted. Nor about "political warfare going on in Washing­ton in 1983-1986." 
On specific matters, North: 

Denied he tried to help his as­sociate, Richard Secord, make a half million dollars by renting a ship to the CIA, which turned out not to be interested in the offer. Said he was merely fol­lowing orders when he drafted a letter to Congress denying in­volvement in helping the Con­tras at a time when official aid was barred. 
"At the Naval Academy you were taught falsehood included deception?'' asked Keker of the witness, a Marine lieutenant colonel until he resigned in the wake of the Iran-Contra affair. 
"You were also trained to obey all lawful orders?" asked Keker, underlining the word lawful on a large pad on an easel facing the jury. 
"Did you take courses in that and learn what was meant by lawful and unlawful . . . you were trained and taught that it was a crime when in World War II at the end of the war German officers came and said they were ordered to do it?" 
Said North: "I don't believe I have ever received an unlaw­ful order." 
Bush battles for S&L plan 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-A house banking panel battled Tuesday over proposals to weaken the heart of the Bush administra­tion's savings and loan bailout plan by diluting a requirement that S&L owners back loans with more of their own money. 
In the first of a planned series of votes on proposed tougher capital standards, the House Banking subcommittee on fin­ancial institutions adopted, 30­17, a weakening amendment of­fered by Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. 
The administration wants to encourage S&Ls to get out of areas such as real estate and insurance by r~quiring owners to back those investments en­tirely with their own capital. McCollum's amendment ex­empts healthy thrifts already engaged in those businesses from the stricter standard. 
Rep. Jim Leach, R-lowa, argued against the change, saying risky areas not tradi­tionally part of S&Ls' business helped push the industry into crisis. 
"What we're saying with this amendment is that vice in the past is acceptable," Leach said.

Madonna soars 'Like a Prayer' 
COLLEEN CRONIN 
assistant accent editor 

M 
adonna has finally grown up. Her fourth release, Like A Prayer, is a far cry from her first album, and outshines all its predeces­sors. 
Like A Prayer is a very personal album--Madonna can claim it as completely hers. She drew from many of her own experiences, past and present, for the song ideas. With the revealing lyrics in "Till Death Do Us Part" and "Oh Father" that are in sharp contrast to "Like A Virgin" and "Holiday," Madonna proves to her fans-­and to herself--that she can have a hit album without resorting to trite topics and lyrics. Like A Prayer pos­sesses depth and meaning, and is not simply two sides worth of mindless dance tunes. Madonna abandons the airheaded girlish voice of her first three albums for a more adult sound, though her range is still heard on Like A Prayer. 
"Till Death Do Us Part" is a somewhat autobiographical tune about a rocky marraige. What makes this song so out of the ordinary is the contrast of upbeat music and reveal­ing lyrics, such as "He starts the fight, she starts the lieS" But what is truth when some­thing dieS" He's not in love with her anymore." 
Madonna abandons the airheaded girlish voice of her first three albums for a more 
adult sound . 
Those Madonna fans who are looking for a dance album will be slightly disappointed. Besides the title song, only three or four songs lend themselves to dancing. "Keep It Together" has a slightly black influence and is one of the more upbeat songs on the album. In "Express Your­self," one of Like A Prayer's best cuts, Madonna advocates an attitude exactly opposite that of her hit "Material Girl": "You don't need dia­mond rings or eighteen karat gold! Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last! What you need is a big strong hand! to lift you to higher ground." 

Only two songs do not hold up to the album's standard. "Act of Contrition" opens with a metal guitar riff that would make Metallica proud. Madonna recites the Act of Contrition amid chaotic music and the Andrae Crouch Choir (a gospel choir). The only way to describe the song is interesting. According to the inner sleeve, the song was produced by "the Powers that Be". The only bad song on Like A Prayer is Madonna's duet with Prince on "Love Song." Though it is on Madonna's album the sound is definitely Prince's and so is quite out of place. The song does not flatter Madonna's voice in the least, and the al­bum would probably be better off without it. 

Another aspect of Like A Prayer that proves Madonna has grown up is the use of instruments in the back­ground music. Her previous albums could easily be reproduced with a syn­thesizer. This album, however, employs pianos and stringed instruments in most of the songs, which makes for a fuller and more complex sound. 
No two songs on the album are alike, which adds to its uniqueness. As with every new album, Madonna again sports a brand new image. She is now hippie-ish and, though she still flaunts her trademark belly button, she seems to be wearing clothes again (more at least than in her "Open Your Heart" video). The album is much different--and much better-­than anything she has done before and definitely deserves a listen. 
A day at the races in Old England 
Alison Cocks 
accent writer 

M 
ost Americans, I've noticed, tend to spend their Saturdays in London jos­tling fellow countrymen and other tourists at the Tower of London, in the shops at Ox­ford Street, or in the lines at the Hard Rock Cafe. 
Along the sides of the track men stood on boxes gesticulating frantically to the bookmakers, who were just as rapidly altering the odds on the boards. 
While I, too, enjoy such amusements, I have dis­covered an alternative form of Saturday entertainment that is infinitely more rewarding. In fact, it surprises me that few other Americans have discovered it, since it involves two pas­times many "Yanks" never tire of: elbowing crowds and spending money. 
I refer to the age-old En­glish practice of spending Sat­urday afternoon at the racetrack. 
BUZZ MC FLATTOP 
Horseracing satisfies the stereotypical Englishman's love of sport, while destroying any American myths about ' "The English Reserve." My own father is an Englishman by birth, and therefore has inherited the love of sport, along with an urge to gamble, that is characteristic of the racegoer. I overheard him planning an excursion to the Newbury racetrack and decided to accompany him in an attempt to understand his enthusiasm. 
As with any sport, the best way to correctly learn about horseracing is from the ex­perts. The virtuosos in this 
field are older men, who are 
well-known at their local pubs 
on the weekends, and at the 
local bookmakers'. They are 
also avid readers of the 
Racing Post, an English 
newspaper devoted solely to 
coverage of horseracing 
events. 
It was with just such a group of experts that I set out early one Saturday morning. Although the first race is never before 12:30, it is nec­essary to make an early start as an 11:00 stop at the nearest pub is a necessity in order to have a quick pint or two of ale and exchange hot betting tips. 

Once this preliminary was dispensed with, we proceeded to the track itself, where I found the adeptness I had ac­quired at fighting my way through crowds of tourists in London quite useful. I was handed a race card, which was a list of the afternoon's races, along with statistics on the horses and jockeys. My companions studied it religi­ously, and though I was con­vinced that Greek was more easily discernable, I began to understand the ins and outs of the statistics at my disposal. I was well on my way to ex­pert status. 
After I had translated my race card and had made what I thought to be an intelligent choice, I followed my com­panions to an area next to the track itself, where I was con­fronted with a scene that resembled the confusion of 
the New York Stock Ex­change . There seemed to be hundreds of bookmakers scat­tered about. Their operations were simple: each had an open carpetbag in front of him, presumably to hold cash, and a large board with his name on it and the going price on each horse. 
Along the sides of the track, men stood on boxes ges­ticulating frantically to the bookmakers, who were just as rapidly altering the odds eys on to victory. To my on the boards. The secret to amazement, it was my horse placing a successful bet that won. From that point on, comes in two parts: first of I was hooked. all, putting money down at My day didn't end as suc­the right time in order to cessfully as it had begun, and have the most favorable odds, I learned that it is necessary and secondly, picking a horse to be prepared to lose a cer­that actually wins.

horses, I soon found, is an expensive venture, as most bookmakers will take a mini­mum of £5. Finally, I battled my way to one and placed my fiver on a horse that I was sure would win. 
During the race itself, I watched a metamorphosis that was almost as entertain­ing as the action on the track. The gentlemen I had arrived with were no longer the same reserved, unassuming, tweed clad figures. They had changed into wild men, jump­ing and screaming as they boisterously urged their jock-cause for merriment if anyone manages to break even. Also, as my youngest sister gleefully taught me that while a knowledge of horse flesh is an asset, it is by no means a requirement. At 11, she is already profi­cient at reading her race card, but still has the annoy­ing tendency to pick on the basis of the horse's name or because she likes the jockey. Generally, it is she who fares the best, much to the chagrin of the rest of us who still believe that by employing reason, we can beat the odds.

Victim testifies as trial continues for OU players 
Associated Press 
NORMAN, Okla. --The vic­tim of an alleged gang rape in an Oklahoma athletic dor­mitory told a court Tuesday she came to believe suspended Oklahoma football player Nigel Clay was one of her as­sailants after discussing the case with prosecutors. 
Clay, Bernard Hall and Glen Bell, Sooner teammates, are accused of first-degree rape in the alleged attack at the dor­mitory on Jan. 21. Hall and Clay face two other charges each of furnishing liquor to a minor. 
The victims has testified that she and a friend had gone to Norman for a double date with two Oklahoma football players, and that said she was attacked after she came out of a bath­room in the athletic dormitory. 
Sherrelyn Lynette Osborn said she and her boyfriend, Larry Medice, were in Medice's room, directly below Clay's, when she heard screams. 
"It was a noise that sounded like a struggle," Osborne said. "I said, 'Nigel must be fighting somebody.' " 
Osborn said the noises got louder, she heard a second scream and that the noises sounded as though someone was falling to the floor. 
"We looked at each other and said, 'It sounds like some girl's getting her butt kicked,"' she said. 
She said Medice went upstairs to investigate. A few moments later, she said, she went to find Medice. 
"He came downstairs and told me some girl had just got raped," Osborn said. 
She said neither she nor Medice called police. They later told the district attorney what they had heard, she said. 
In cross-examination, Os­born told the court she had once described the screams as pos­sibly being screams of passion. 
The 20-year-old Oklahoma City victim spent seven hours on the witness stand Tuesday for the second day of a prelim­inary hearing which is used to determine if the suspended football players should be tried on the charges filed against them in Cleveland County Dis­trict Court. 
Clay's attorney, Joel Barr, began Tuesday's questioning by asking the victim when she came to believe Clay may have been one of her assailants. The woman said she had seen evidence Feb. 9 in the district attorney's office that led her to believe Clay was one of the at­tackers. The prosecutor's of­fice filed charges the next day. 
She said she believed, be­cause of his size, that Clay woud have been the fifth of the six people she said attacked her. An Oklahoma media guide lists Clay as being 6-foot-4 and weighing 274 pounds. 
In earlier testimony, the vic­tim had said the fifth attacker "knocked the breath out of me." 
The woman often struggled with questions from Barr and from Charlie Cox, Bell's attor­ney. 
Cox tried to determine how many men were in Clay's room and how many the woman was able to identify. 
The woman told the court Monday that she could not iden­tify her attackers because the

room was dark.

Associated Press 
CHICAGO --Jerome Walton homered in the 
first inning and scored the tie-breaking run in 
the eighth when Mark Grace grounded into a 
fielder's choice, giving the Chicago Cubs a 5-4 
victory Tuesday over the St. Louis Cardinals. 
It was the Cubs fourth straight victory. 
Loser Jose DeLeon, 1-1, walked Walton and 
Mitch Webster to open the eighth. The two run­
ners pulled off a double steal. Todd Worrell 
relieved DeLeon and got Ryne Sandberg to foul 
out. Worrell then walked Andre Dawson inten­
tionally, filling the bases. 
Twins 14, Tigers 0 

DETROIT --Carmen Castillo hit a grand slam 
in Minnesota's eight-run eighth inning, and 
Kirby Puckett drove in three runs Tuesday with 
a double and homer, leading the Twins to their 
12th straight victory over Detroit, 14-0. 
Allan Anderson worked seven innings for the 
Twins, allowing seven hits as he beat the Tigers 
for the fourth straight time. Rookies German 
Gonzalez and Gary Wayne completed the 
shutout with an inning apiece in relief. Gonzalez 
struck out all three batters he faced, and Wayne 
gave up one hit in the ninth. 
Astros 5, Reds 3 

HOUSTON --Ken Caminiti's two-run single highlighted a four-run, first inning and his field­ing helped thwart a seventh-inning Cincinnati rally, leading the Houston Astros to a 5-3 victory over the Reds Tuesday night. 
Pirates 4, Mets 3 

PITTSBURGH --Bobby Bonilla singled home the winning run off reliever Randy Myers with two outs in the 11th inning as the Pittsburgh Pirates won their home opener Tuesday night, beating the New York Mets 4-3. 
Phillies 6, Expos 2 
PHILADELPHIA --Steve Ontiveros pitched seven shutout innings and drove in three runs with a bases-loaded double in a five-run, fourth inning as the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Montreal Expos 6-2 Tuesday night. 
Ontiveros, who wa: on the disabled list most of last season with Oakland, yielded five hits. He underwent elbow surgery during the winter after leaving the A's to become a free agent. 
Royals 6, Orioles 5 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. --Bo Jackson and George Brett hit two-run homers and Danny Tartabull had a solo shot as the Kansas City Royals beat Baltimore 6-5 Tuesday night for their 15th con­secutive victory over the Orioles. 
Angels 7, Athletics 1 
ANAHEIM --Bert Blyleven hurled a four­hitter for his first victory with California as the Angels beat the Oakland Athletics 7-1 Tuesday night. 
Blyleven, 1-0, walked two and struck out five. The 38-year-old right-hander, who is tied with Steve Carlton and Nolan Ryan on the all-time list with 55 shutouts, blanked the A's on two hits until the ninth. They scored on Stan Javier's single, Dave Parker's double and Carney Lansford's grounder. 
Padres 3, Braves 2 
SAN DIEGO --Ed Whitson allowed five hits 
in 7 2-3 innings and had a run-scoring single as 
the San Diego Padres beat the Atlanta Braves 
3-2 Tuesday night. 

Tony Gwynn hit his second homer in the fifth 
inning. 

Whitson, 2-0, struck out eight and walked 
three.

Notre Dame lacked the inten­sity in game two that the players had in game one, ac­cording to Boulac, but the Irish will take the wins anyway. 
"We didn't go after them like we should have, but our girls didn't want to lose," Bouulac noted. "It's a big rivalry."

peted there before have been all-star collections or interna­tional squads. 
USA Wrestling, the national governing body for wrestling, asked the Notre Dame team if it wanted to make the landmark tour. 
"Notre Dame's a good name, a high-profile name worldwide," said McCann. "We've had a lot of kids do well at the international level in junior competitions." 

Freshmen Tim Anderson and Curt Engler, who both graduated from Dowling High School in Peru, Iowa, each competed in the Junior Olym­pics last year. Engler won an individual championship, while Anderson placed second in his weight division. 
Durso and junior Andy Radenbaugh each have won Junior National champion­ships, and freshman Marcus Gowens placed second in a Junior National competition. 
With recruiting season in full swing the last few weeks, the Notre Dame wrestlers have not had much actual mat time. They will have to adjust to the international form of wres­tling, which differs from the collegiate style. 
"The international style is more wrestling on your feet with more emphasis on 

irish 

takedowns as compared to col­lege, where there's a lot of mat wrestling," said Durso. "The international's a lot more wide open, and you're allowed to take more chances." 
McCann does not know ex­actly which wrestlers his team will face in the three dual meets, though he has heard theories about how the Soviets might arrange the lineups. 
''The Russians will make it as close as possible as long as they win," said McCann. "I've heard that what they might do is see us wrestle and figure out how they're going to beat us, yet make it look like a close match." 
The United States just defeated the Soviet Union 19-18 in a World Cup dual match. But according to McCann, the So­viet Union's large number of wrestlers makes it a bigger power in the sport than the United States. 
"We can match up our elite with their elite," said the five­year Irish coach, "but they have so much more depth. A lot of times, you don't know if they're bringing their best people because they have so much depth. 
"We're better in some areas," continued McCann. "Our youth programs are much better. We have intense high school and college pro­grams. They've got them but don't stress them as much."

At Xavier, the Irish got three wins from their four starters. In Sunday's first game, senior Mike Passilla went six innings to earn the victory, allowing one earned run. In the second game, senior Mike Coffey went 3 1-3 innings of scoreless relief to pick up his third win. In that time, Coffey walked one and struck out five. 
On Monday, freshman Brian Conway shut out Xavier for six innings to earn the win, allow­ing only three hits. In the second game, senior Erik Mad­sen earned his team-leading fifth win by pitching a complete game in the 6-3 victory. 
The hitting remained fairly consistent over the four games as well. In the Sunday doubleheader, the Irish pounded out 15 runs on 19 hits, and in the Monday doubleheader did not lose a step by scoring 18 runs on 24 hits. 
Juniors Dan Peltier and Ed Lund both enjoyed outstanding weekends, with Peltier raising his team-leading average to .429 and Lund hitting a home run and picking up seven RBI. Both picked up two game­winning RBI. 
Peltier was 8-for-15 over the four games with five RBI, in­cluding three doubles. In his last six games, Peltier has raised his average 42 points. 
Lund enjoyed a near-perfect game on Sunday in the 12-3 vic­tory. In the game, he was 2-for­2 with a home run and four RBI, including three walks. 
Freshman Frank Jacobs, who had a 5-for-13 weekend, has raised his batting average from .212 to .290 in his last six games.

TliE STORY OF THE IRISH CLADDAGH 
The Irish Claddagh story began in the 16th Century 
when Richard Joyce, a native of Galway was captured 
by Algerian Cosairs while on his way to the West Indies. 
He was sold as a slave to a wealthy Moorish Goldsmith 
who trained him In the craft. His master took a great 
liking to him and offered him his freedom which Richard 
very happily accepted. 

He returned to his native county and settled down in the 
ancient village of Claddagh, just outside Galway city, 
where he designed and made the first Claddagh. 
The design of the Irish Claddagh is simple, but 
yet unique: The Hand Signifies Friendship, The Crown Loyalty, And The Heart Love. 
The Irish Claddagh, because of its tradition and design grows daily in popularity and is being used internationally as a token. of great friendship and love.

LEXINGTON, Ky. --Lute Ol­son appears to be the No.1 can­didate for Kentucky's vacant basketball coaching job if the price is right. 
Olson, head coach at Arizona, is expected to meet with Kentucky athletics direc­tor C.M. newton this week to discuss the details of the job. 
"Hopefully, it'll work into that," Newton said of Olson be­coming the school's prime can­didate to replace Eddie Sutton, who left under fire. "Obviously we're interested and obviously he's interested." 
Olson and Newton were ex­pected to meet in Lexington on Thursday.

things to talk about," Newton said. 
Cedric Dempsey, University of Arizona athletic director, said he gave Kentucky officials permission to talk with Olson but didn't know of the coach's intentions. 
"I would hope we could bring all these rumors to a head and resolve what needs to be re­solved," Dempsey said. 
Dempsey said that before the Olson-Kentucky linkup, he had recommended that Olson's contract be extended three years and his base salary be increased, and that the Board of Regents had approved the measure. 
The current contract has two years to go, meaning Olson would have a five-year con­tract at Arizona. The Arizona Republic in Phoenix said Ol­son's current base salary is believed to be between around $85,000 to $95,000 with a total package reported to be worth between $400,000 and $500,000. 
The Republic also reported that one unidentified source said the Kentucky package for Olson would be more than $750,000 each season. 
Olson, 54, was offered the Kentucky job in 1985 but turned it down. 
He has compiled a 137-55 record in six seasons at Arizona. 
Olson also has said the sanc­tions Kentucky could receive from the NCAA committee on Infractions as a result of 18 al­leged violations of NCAA rules could influence his decision. University officials are sched­uled to meet with the NCAA committee on Infractions on April22. 
"I can't sit and wait. The more I sat on the bench last year, the more I thought about retiring. I think I made the right decision, but it's going to take awhile to get used to it. 
"I've never lost that enthus­iasm, never lost that joy," said Knight, who, in addition to his World Series MVP year with the New York Mets, had .300 seasons earlier with Houston and Cincinnati. 
In past years, Lopez adjusted her tour schedule so she and her husband could spend time together. But when Knight was traded from Baltimore to Detroit last year in spring training, it threw their plans into disarray. 
"Nancy's schedule was already set according to Bal­timore's schedule," Knight said. "It didn't match with Detroit's schedule and we wound up seeing each other only five weeks during the en­tire summer." 
Knight said his new job, "is not as easy as it looks." 
"He knows what he's doing out there," said Lopez, who will be among the favorites in the $450,000 Ai Star-Centinela Hospital Classic that starts Friday at Rancho Park in Los Angeles. 
"He's good for my game. He gives me the yardage and keeps me from making mental mistakes." 
So far there have been ·vir­tually no family spats on the course. 
But, recalling the Kemper Open earlier this year, Knight said, "We had a disagreement with club selection; I thought she should use a 4-iron to the green and she wanted to hit a 5-iron." 
Lopez proceeded to hit the 5­iron short and into the water. 
"I ended up saying, 'See. vou never listen to me. If you don't, why ask me?' It was a stupid statement for me to make, very stupid," Knight said.

ND lacrosse faces tough road stretch 
By PETE LaFLEUR 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame lacrosse team takes its five-game win­ning streak on the road today, facing off against Lake Forest College in Lake Forest, Illinois at 3:30. 
The Irish (5-3) are playing possibly their best lacrosse of the year as they look to peak for four tough games following the match against the Foresters. 
Four of the last five Irish games are on the road, and the team has had most of its prob­lems away from home. They opened the season with three losses on eastern trips before struggling to defeat the College of Wooster 8-7 after an emo­tional win over Air Force. 
But the Irish should not ex­perience a similar dropoff in in­tensity against Lake Forest fol­lowing last week's big win over Kenyon, according to sopho­more defenseman Dave Bar­nard. 
"I don't really expect a let­down. I don't think anyone will, look past Lake Forest," Bar­nard said. "We beat them pretty well in a scrimmage before the season, but I'm sure they've improved." 
Barnard cited the team's ability to capture a quick lead and maintain it in the 14-7 rout of Kenyon as an indication of an improved team confidence and intensity. 
"We're a lot more confident now as far as being able to keep a lead," Barnard said. "Against Georgetown and Stony Brook 51-t the start of the year we got the upper hand and lost it. That's a sign of a young team. 
"But when you're able to come together and keep a lead that's a great sign of mature leadership." 
The Irish attack will again count on their leading scorers, senior tri-captain John Olmstead (17 goals, 10 assists) and junior Brian McHugh (18 goals, 6 assists). The team can also now consider getting some scoring off the bench, as shown by freshman Mike Sullivan's four goals against Kenyon. 
Freshman Tom Duane is 
averaging 12 saves a game and 
will start his third game in the 
Irish net. Senior tri-captain 
defensemen Kevin O'Connor 
and Doug Spencer will lead the 
defense, which has allowed 
only seven goals per game this 
year. 
Notre Dame is in contention 
for the NCAA tournament west­
ern bid following an emotional 
win over Air Force on March 
29. The Irish could capture their first NCAA tournament invitation if they beat Division I rivals Michigan State and Ohio State on the road April 26 and 29, respectively. 
But Irish head coach Kevin 
Corrigan said his team has 
learned the importance of not 
looking past any opponent. 
"Our biggest concern is Lake Forest," Corrigan said. "We're not looking past them because we've found this year that we're not a good team unless we concentrate on what we're doing at the moment." 
Irish concentration was seen in many areas in the win over Kenyon. Notre Dame dominated in groundballs and faceoffs, with sophomore John

Streaking baseball squad has tough week 

By SCOTT BRUTOCAO Sports Writer 
As the Notre Dame baseball team travels to Illinois­Chicago today for a doubleheader at 4 p.m., it takes with it a full head of steam. 
The Irish (20-6), coming off of a four-game sweep against Xavier, beating the Mus­keteers 12-3, 3-2 on Sunday and 12-1, 6-3 on Monday, have been victorious in eight of their last nine contests and in the last month have won 14 of 17 games. 
This, according to Head Co­ach Pat Murphy, has given the team confidence and added ex­perience for the remainder of a season that shows much promise. 
"I think this team is growing in confidence," said the second-year head coach. "We've got a demanding week with a number of games and so few pitchers on our staff. We're gaining confidence and we're going to need it." 
In the next five days, Notre Dame will play eight games. On Thursday the Irish are at home for a doubleheader against Butler, and then travel to Dayton to take on the MCC Eastern Division rival Flyers. 
Today, as Notre Dame faces Illinois-Chicago, the Irish will be looking to avenge a 5-0 loss suffered against the Flames on

MCC honors Boulac, NO players 
Special to The Observer 

Notre Dame softball coach Brian Boulac has been named Midwestern Collegiate Conference Coach-of -the-Year. Boulac has guided the Irish to a 16-13 record in their first year on the varsity level. 
The Irish also placed several members on the All­Conference teams. Outfielder Rachel Crossen earned first­team honors.

The Notre Dame softball team claimed the local brag­ging rights by sweeping St. Mary's in a doubleheader Tues­day. 
The Irish improved their record to 16-13 by shutting out the Belles in game one, 10-0, and outscoring them again in game two, 4-2. 
Notre Dame jumped out to a quick 5-0 lead in the first inning of game one when St. Mary's pitcher Michele Pinter lost con­trol of her pitches, allowing five walks, two wild pitches and hit­ting one batter. The Irish scored all five runs on only one hit as the Belles made two er­rors. 
Notre Dame added another run in the third inning and three more in the fifth. Mean­while, senior captain Barb Mooney held the Belles score­less for the entire game. Step­hanie Nomura scored the last April 5. On that day, the Irish split a doubleheader with the Flames, with the Irish taking the first game by a score of 13­2. 
In the loss, the Irish were shut out by an Jim Shortall, who at that time had an 0-1 record and a 6.94 ERA. The Irish could only manage four hits in that game. 
"I think our kids were em­barrassed by the one loss we had to them, and the way that we lost," said Murphy. "I have a feeling they'll be ready for them. 
"I just think our kids will speak for themselves, and that they'll go up and do the job. I'm sure they're sitting home and waiting for that (Shortall) to pitch," continued Murphy. "I think it would be a big mistake to start (Shortall) against us." 
Despite this determination, due to the great number of games that the Irish will be having, Murphy will be start­ing pitchers "without any ex­perience" in the two games with the Flames. 
This decision is due in part to Murphy's faith in his pitch­ing staff and due in part to the strength of the team's hitting. 
"I really feel like if our team continues to improve, stays confident, and backs up confidence with day-in day-out preparation and work, we're going to be after graduation." 

One key to the team's "'u'-""''~" will be its pitching, which been keeping the team in game and saving it when sive production is less than quate.

Father-son tandem boosts Fightin Iris in close game 
By GREG GUFFEY Assistant Sports Editor 
The milestones continued in Bookstore Basketball XVIII Tuesday afternoon. 
A great-grandfather ended a 41-year sabbatical last Thursday, and a father-son combination followed by leading its team to a victory Tuesday. 
Pat and Tony Leonardo helped The Fightin' Iris to a 21­18 win over Strapper Prisby and the Leather Monkeys in first-round action. It's not the 
first time for a father-son team in the tourney, but it is a rare occurrence. 
Pat works in the admissions office, while Tony is a sopho­more at Saint Joseph's High 
School and an employee of the University. Tony scored the last three hoops in the contest, and Bob Mundy was the leading scorer with six. 
"I think it's magnificent," said Pat, a 10-year veteran of Bookstore Basketball. "A vic­tory is a victory in Bookstore Basketball. It's nice to have someone young and energetic on the team." 

In other games, it was a day of extremes. Two favorites won in under 15 minutes each, while three games were decided in overtime battles. 
Clockwork Orange, led by Dan Sharp and Dan Madison with six baskets each, routed Freedom Rock 21-3 in 12 minutes. The winners con­nected on 21-of-34 shots from the field. 
"It was unbelievable compe­tition," said Frank Starns, a member of the winning team. "What really threw us was the Freedom Rock Dillon music in the background. Their gameplan was all mental. This is the Year of the Malaysian Orange." 
Malicious Prostitution also won handily, destroying 4 Skins and a Shirt 21-4 in 12 minutes. Joe Sternberg paced the win­ners with eight hoops. 
Maureen McFadden Is a Fabulous Babe went overtime to defeat Malodorous Bad Ath­letes 24-22. The winners led 5-4 early in the game, but did not regain the advantage until late in the contest at 23-22. George Fish paced the victors eight baskets. 

"We did it for Maureen Fish said. "We'd like to Maureen to our next game." 
In another overtime contest Ocean Motion edged Butt ers and N arne Takers 22-20 Three players on the squad scored at least five kets. Boob Leffler Shamokin Heat also won in overtime against Dr. Justice and the Kareems. 
We Can't Think of a Name showed it's not name, but how a team plays that counts with a 21-12 victory. Too Drunk To Play evidently had a few too many before the game, losing to Air Borden and the Milkmen 21-8. 
Licensed To Brick put up plenty of bricks in its contest, falling to Ted Bundy and the Electrics 21-8. 
Basses of Death brought some comic relief to the day by playing tubas during the game. The gimmick almost worked, as they lost only by a 21-17 count to The Monsters: The Disciples of the Death Ball. 
ND wrestling squad will travel to USSR 
What began as an inside joke has turned into reality for the Notre Dame wrestling team. 
Irish coach Fran McCann will take 12 of his wrestlers to the Soviet Union on May 22 for a 10-day tour that includes dual matches in Moscow, Leningrad and Minsk.

McCann had told seniors Pat Boyd, Jerry Durso and Chris Geneser when he recruited them that the team might make a trip overseas in mind. This trip fulfills that promise...with slight variations. 
"Coach McCann said we might be going to Japan," said Boyd, who earned All-America honors last month with a fifth-place finish in the NCAA 142-pound division. "It was kind of a joke among Chris, Jerry and myself that it was just a recruiting ploy they came up with. 
"Then they mentioned last year the possibility we might go to Russia." Notre Dame will become the first college team to wrestle in the Soviet Union. All the American teams which com-
