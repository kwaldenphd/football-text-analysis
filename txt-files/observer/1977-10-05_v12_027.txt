Kidnapping occurs 
HPC discusses United Way 
Tony Pace Staff Reporter 
Speaking before an informal gathering of approximately SO stu­dents in the Dillon Hall chapel, Notre Dame Dean of Students James A. Roemer stated that "the only university rule which does not apply to off-campus students is parietals. The sexuality rule, which is distinct from the parietal rule, applies to all students." 
Roemer, who was responding to an Observer opinion column by Tom Byrne, said, "I beg to differ with my good friend, Tom Byrne; the rules which we now have apply to all students, not just those on campus. Whether on East Angela 
..,Boulevard or on-campus, all Uni­versity rules, with exception of parietals, apply. The parietal rule is only one of the nine rules which we have governing students." 
These rules, which include man­dates on pre-marital sex, alcohol and drugs, are now being dis­cussed in the course of a revision of du Lac. "The revision," said Roemer, "Does not concern the rules themselves. Rather it is concerned with the procedures for dealing with violations of these rules as outlined in du Lac." The procedures set forth in du Lac have come under fire because of what Roemer termed the "celebrated cases" of the past year. 
Though he never referred to it directly, Roemer attempted to clarify the circumstances surround­ing one of those cases, that concerning former N~tre Dame running back AI Hunter. when

and

asked about his appeal supposedly occurring after the five day dead­line for appeals, Roemer stated, "The judicial board returned their verdict on May 9 and I appealed the decision on May 12, only three days later and well within the estab­lished deadline. I sent a supple­mental. my initial appeal occurred within the time limit." 
He went on to describe the methods whereby students can appeal their decisions. In the first method, students would simply "climb the university ladder," appealing first to Brother Just and then. if the situation warranted, to Hesburgh. 
These approaches were dis­cussed in connection with the other "celebrated case" which involved two Dillon men and two Lyons women last fall. All four of these students were expelled for a bla­tant parietals violation. Though theywere all given the option of 
applying  for  readmission  to  the  
University,  none  of  them  has  
returned as of yet.  

Roemer said these two cases have been instrumental in bringing about discussion for changing the disciplinary procedures. He pointed out, ''Two years ago a committee, which had one student on it, recommended that we remove students from the board. They felt that it placed too much pressure on the students to make these types of decisions concerning other students. But because of extraneous reasons, this proposal was never acted upon. These rather celebrated cases have started things moving." 
''After the trustee meetings this summer, we brought representa­tives from student government, the Observer, the Scholastic, and · WSND back early, on August 25, to begin the task of restructuring du Lac. I have not received any proposal from the student commit­tee as of yet. I wanted a smaller committee, of three or four, to· write the revision. But this was . defeated by the HPC, so there the committee doing the revision has seven people. I'm ready to negotiate the points of their pro­
posals anytime. The final pro­posals have to be submitted to the trustees during their meetings on USC weekend," he summarized. 
Roemer's appearance in Dillon was sponsored by the Dillon Hall academic commission. Roemer was the first speaker to appear 
McTaggart informed the HPC that the money raised in the South Bend area wifl be used to fund volunteer programs in South Bend. ''More than likely there is not one volunteer organizatio_n in the city that will not benefit from the United Way campaign," he said. 
He also noted that money raised at Notre Dame will not be used to finance abortion or other activities the community deems inappropri­ate. 
Russell stressed the importance of student participation, stating. "We're simply asking the student to donate the money they would probably spend on a few beers. or on a sandwich at food sales." He added, "the money will be put to fine use." 
Later in the meeting. Anne Thompson, Student Government chairperson of co-education, ad­dressed the HPC concerning the Student Government's proposed escort service. She indicated that the service would operate on a volunteer basis. 
The list of volunteer escourts will be available at the ombudsman office in a few weeks. 
She also announced a proposal for a Security Advisory Board, which would meet with Security Director Arthur Pears once a month to discuss complaints and sugges­tions concerning campus security. The board will consist of four undergraduate students, two rec­tors, one graduate student, and an off-campus sesident. 
The HPC also discussed the budget for this year, and approved a set of guidelines for its budget committee. The schedule for allocation fo funds to the halls was discussed, and Russell called for "accurate estimates" of each hall's financial situation and plans for using the available funds. 
The HPC was also briefed on changes at Memorial library by Student Body Vice-President Tom Soma. Soma ~aid that new tables have been installed in the base­ment, and that all of the seminar rooms are open on weeknights for students' usc. 
He also said that socializing on the second floor is "still a prob­lem;" but it is hoped that the basement improvements would help alleviate some of the noise in the library. 
Additionally, Mike Kammer­diener. co-chairperson of the hom<.>­coming committee, addressed the HPC concerning the schedule for homecoming week. He said that students who purchased a home­coming ticket package must have their dance tickets validated, due to the limit of dance tickets being sold. 
The meeting was disrupted for a short period of time when a group identified as the "Dillon Liberation Army" kidnapped Grace hall presi­dent Jerome Castellini. The kid­napping was said to be in retalia­tion for an incident on Saturday when Grace residents stole a Dillon flag from a party in Green Field. 
Wearing disguises and armed with an electric hair dryer, the DLA burst .into the meeting and carried Castellini out of the room. His whereabouts are unknown. 
In an official statement, Grace said that it does not condone the kidnapping, and will wait for a civilized, legal approach from Dil­
lon before returning the flag.

Brother Joe McTaggart stressed cooperation and participation as keys to the success of this year's United Way campaign. Speaking at last night's Hall President's Council meeting. McTaggart asser­ted a ''Christian obligation to take care of the poor." and urged the Communitv Services Commisioners 
and  the  hall  presidents  to  work  
together  for  the  success  of  the  
cam(lllign.  

"'I'm confident we're going to see some good results from the hall campaign." HPC Chairman J.P. Russell stated. "It's good to see the hall presidents and the com­munity services commisioners workin-g together on the same project," added Russell. 
The one-week campaign differs from past years in that each student in the halls will be contac­ted personally. Striving for a goal of ·'1 00 percent participation,'' the commisioners and hall presidents will organize door to door cam­paigns to raise funds.

SMC nurses to be capped 
By Pat Payne 
Forty-six St. Mary's juniors ~ill 
officially be accepted as nursmg 
majors during a Mass and capping 
ceremony to be held on Saturday, 
Oct. 8, at 8 p.m. in the Church of 
Loretta. 
"The ceremony marks the begin­
ning of our shift of focus from 
theory to application towards our 
fellow man," stated Sue Mazanec, 
co-chairman of the capping 
activities. 
Rev. James Zatko will officiate at 
Literary Festival chooses Joyce for theme 
by Pat Dermody 
The Sophomore Literary Fes­
tival, according to this year's 
chairperson Theresa Rebeck, is a 
celebration of literature that "ev­
eryone can enjoy." Beginning 
February 12 and running through 
Feb. 18, writers from various 
countries wilL visit the campus to 

join with the Notre Dame com­
munity in celebrating the art of 
literature. 
Rebeck, a second year Arts and 
Letters major, chose the theme for 

this year's Festival from James 
Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as 
Young Man. "The following quote 
says Rebeck, "explains to people 

who don't know a whole lot about 
the Festival, what it is we're trying 
to do:" 
'To speak of these things and to 
try to understand their nature and, 
having understood It, to try slowly 

and humbly and constantly to 
express, to press out again, from 
the gross earth or what It brings 
forth, from sound and shape and 

color which are the prison gates of 
our soul an Image of the beauty we 
have come to understand--that Is 
art.' 
Rebeck said this passage from 

Joyce's book embodies what the 
Committee is trying to do--"to 
define and describe contemporary 

literature and it's creators." 
Although Rebeck was hesitant to 
name specific artists who will 
appear in the festival she said that 
approximately thirty five invita­

tions have been sent. Acceptances 
have already been received from 
British poet George Macbeth, 
American poet Howard Neverov, 
and Amercian playwright Preston 
Jones. 
"We're trying to get a real 

international flavor to it this year," 
continued Rebeck. Consequently, 
African writer Chinua Achibe has 
been invited to join the Festival as 
well as Latin American author 
Gabriel Garcia Marquez. 
Many "big name" authors have 

also been invited, but none have 
replied yet. "It's always q~estion­
able who is going to be here right 
up to the week of the Festival," 
Rebeck said. She added that a list 
of scheduled guests will be avail­
able sometime in early January. 
The Sophomore Literary Festival 

planning committee consists of 
sophomores and faculty advisors. 
According to Rebeck, "because the 
literary festival is such a unique 
event, hopefully everybody will 
enjoy it." 
Big Brother/Sister meets tonight 
The Big Brother/Big Sister Or­ganization of Notre Dame and St. Mary's will hold it's orientation meeting at 7 p.m. tonight in the lounge of Alumni Hall. For all those interested, the orientation will consist of a short film, an explanation of the program by case workers from the Big Brother/Big Sister Agency in South Bend, and a question-answer session. Refresh­ments will be served. 
the Mass, which is the high point of the weekend's activities. Also being planned are a picnic at the clubhouse Saturday morning, a reception in Stapleton lounge fol­lowing the Mass, and a breakfast Sunday morning at the dining hall. Over 400 parents, faculty, and 
guestsare expected to attend. 

Co-chairman Ann Gatmaitan ex­
plained that the caps will be 
blessed at the Offertory of the 
Mass, and Dr. Mary Martucci, 
nursing program director, will 
present a cap to each nurse. They, 
in turn, will recite the Nightingale 
pledge while holding miniature oil 
lamps. 

"It's our f{)rmal invitation into the 
nursing profession,'' added 
Mazanec. 

Martucci pointed out that the 
nursing cap signifies a transition 
period for the students. "They 
have accomplished certain things 
and will start others," she said. 
The cap also symbolizes much 
spiritual and traditional meaning. 
The students wear the cap selected 
two years ago by the first nursing 
class, and it is St. Mary's tradi­
tional cap," Martucci noted. 

According to Martucci, histori­
cally the nursing cap has been 
handed down several centuries. 
The women who cared for the sick 
partially covered their hair. "It 
represents the spirituality to which 
the individual is connected," 
stated Martucci. 

She also mentioned that the 
pledge is reminiscent of Florence 
Nightingale, the English nurs~ 'Yho 
restructured nurses trammg 
programs. 

Actual clinical work will commence tomorrow at St. Joseph's Hospital, Memorial Hospital and various clinics in the South Bend area. The nurses have been participating in training prog­rams, however, for five weeks. Learning to read vital signs, body mechanics, and complete patient care have been stressed in the mock-clinic set up at Havican Hall. 
Cindy Danford, co-chairman of the ceremony, expounded on the nurses' new duties. "Each student is placed in a rotation group with seven or eight other students and a faculty advisor. The rotations, lasting three to four weeks each, are composed of medical surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics, psychiatry and public health. One or two patients are assigned each week to every student and she is in charge of the care, medication, and needs of the patient for that period." 
.Danford noted that the students are, for the most part, on their own as to the needs of the patient. At the end of the day, however, there is a conference with the advisor to discuss and evaluate the day's activities. 
The nursing students will parti­cipate in clinical work every Thursday and Friday for the re­mainder of the year. Gatmaitan stated, "We get more experience with the real world than any other students here. We're continuing to 
learn  through  practical  
experience."  
''All  the  students  are  really  

enthused about the capping ceremony," Mazanec said. "We've had a lot of cooperation 
from Dr. Martucci and Mary Jo Kubinski, our advisor," she added.

Steam pipes burst, flood Pangborn basement room 
by Pat Dermody 
"The rug was floating on top of the 
water, ''said Pangborn resident 
John Riley, "That's how deep it 
was.'' According to Riley, the 
flood that occurred early Sunday 
evening in Room 005 if Pangborn 
Hall was just one of several 
problems with the new heating 
system in the basement of Pang­
born. 
The system, installed earlier this 
year, prohibits the residents of the 
basement from regulating the 
temperature of their rooms. Al­
though thermostats have been 
placed in individual rooms, the 
temperature dial is covered by a 
glass plate. Therefore the only way 
a student can control the heat is to 
take the thermostat apart. 
Riley said that although his was 
the only room that flooded due to 
the heating system, other rooms 
have had problems. "One room 
got up to 85 degrees and another 
to 90 degrees the other night,"riley 
continued. Many rooms have been 
plagued by steam leaking from the 
pipes as well. Riley said that about 
two weel.:s his room "turned into a 
sauna." 
Sunday evening, however, 
Riley's room flooded. "We noticed 
a wet spot on the rug sometime 
Sunday afternoon, "he began"but 
we thought something had just 
been spilled. Then when we came 
back after dinner, the whole rug 
was wet " Riley said that he and 
his three roommates called the

heating system in Pangborn. 
"The guy was standing right there," explained Riuley, "when all of a sudden the pipe cracked and water started pumping out." Riley added that it was "just like turning a tap on. Diry water just poured 
out." After working on it for about forty minutes, the man from the heating company was able to fix the cracked pipe. By this time how­ever, the rug in the room was "more or less destroyed," accord­ing to Riley, "and so were some paperback books that had been left on the floor." Water had also leaked out into the hall and was, Riley estimated, "about four 
inches deep.'' Father Riehle, rector of Pangborn and University Director of Energy Conservation, was present at the scene of the flood but was unavail­able for comment. Terry Johnson, Pangborn resident assistant said, "evidently, what happened, is that one of the copper pipe fittings broke which was put in for the new 
thermostat system.'' 
While Johnson was reluc­tant to connect the flood directly to the experimental heating system, he did comment that "it happened right at the place where they were doing the work." 
Senior Class to sponsor 
'~semi-formal'' 
The Library Bar will provide the setting for a senior "semi-formal" on Oct. 15, according to Senior Oass President Pat Flynn. 
The cost for the event will be SlO per couple, and will include a flower for the lady, champagne upon entry, and access to an open bar, which will serve beer and any type of mixed drink usually avail­able at the bar. 
Only 150 tickets will be sold for the affair. They will be available in LaFortune lobby tomorrow and Thursday between the hours of 1 pm and 4 pm. 
No one will be admitted without a ticket, and everyone must have a date. Any questions about the 
. event may be directed to Flynn (233-6773) or the other senior class officers: Mary Lou Mulvihill (8067), Tex Keffier (234-0330) and Sue Bailey (7187).

WASHINGTON (AP)-U.S. Dis­trict Judge John J. Sirica ended his long involvement in the Watergate case yesterday by drastically re­ducing the sentences of the biggest fish netted in the scandal. 
He reduced the two andone-half year sentences of John N. Mitchell, 
H.R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman to a period of "not less then one nor more than four years." . 
Ehrlichman, who went to prison without waiting for the outcome of his appeals, thus becomes eligible for parole from his Watergate cover-up conviction after Oct. 28. 
He still is under a 20 month to five year sentence for his conviction in the so-called Watergate plumb­ers case but it was expected the the judge in that case would reduce tha time to conform with that handed out by Sirica. For Haldeman the magic date is June 21 next year and for Mitchell, June 22. 
Sirica made his decision after hearing tape recorded requests for leniency by the three men, and eloquent pleas by their lawyers. 
Sirica was chief judge of the U.S. District court in the District of Columbia when the seven Water­gate burglars were indicted on Sept. 15, 1972. He assigned him1>e Jf to hear their trial and that began an involvement that ended only Tuesday. 
"I'm glad it's the last major decision I'll have to render in this case." he told a reporter before entering court. "It's a long, difficult case, in many respects a sad case. I'm glad to see the end of 
the tunnel."  
There  are  no  more  Watergate  
prosecutions  pending  and  it  is  
expected  that  Sirica  will  soon  

voluntarily take the title of senior judge, which will free him from day to day courtroom responsibilities. He is 73. 
Mitchell, Haldeman, and Erhl­ichman were convicted of cons­piring to cover up White House involvement in the Watergate scan­dal and of lying about it afterward. They fought their conviction and sentences up to the Supreme Court wuhout success and there were no judicial remedies remain­ing other than Sirica's action.

If Sirica had failed to reduce their sentences their only other recourse would have been intervention by President Carter. 
Ehrlichman, 52, formerly domes­tic couselor to Richard Nixon when he was president, has been in the federal prison camp at Safford, Ariz., since last Oct. 28. Mitchell, 64 who was Nixon's attorney general, went into prison at Max­well Air Force Base in Alabama on June 22 and Haldemn, the Nixon chief of staff, entered the prison facility at Lompoc, Calif., the day before.

Carter says SALT pact in sight 
(AP)-President Jimmy Carter told the United Nations yesterday that a new strategic arms limitation agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union is in sight. 
He also said the United States will be willing in some future treaty to cut its nuclear arsenal in half. 
"Peace will not be assured until the weapons of war are put away," the President said. 
After his speech, the President 
Walsh named course evaluation booklet editor 
Mark Perry Staff Reporter 
Scholastic editor Kathleen Mc­Elroy has selected Maureen Walsh to be the editor of the course evaluation booklet which Scholastic will be printing this semester. McElroy said that the books should be distributed to students in early November. 
Walsh, who presented the pro­posal to the Student Government Board of Commissioners to obtain $1500 for the production of the booklet, said that editors will be selected for each department in the Universtiy to gather course de­scriptions from professors, and solicit evaluations of the course and 
teacher  from  students.  
"Each  professor  will  fill  in  a  
description  form,"  Walsh  said,  

"noting work loads for their course, number of tests, books required, attendance policies, and other information about their class," added Walsh. 
"For courses offered both se­esters," Walsh continued, "stu­dents currently enrolled in these courses will be asked to evaluate the course and the professor, including comments on lecturing style, availability, fairness, and any other comments they might want to offer." For courses only offered in the second semester, students who took the course last year will be asked for their opinions. Walsh added that courses offered this semester will also be evaluated to be included in a booklet which should be made in the spring. 
Walsh said that both the editors and students who are evaluating courses will be majors in the particular department. Further­more, the editors will try to get judgement of the courses and professors. 
Anyone who would be interested in serving as an editor, student evaluator, and would like to help in the production of the booklet should call the Scholastic office at \500 
Day of Renewal sponsored by prayer group 
A Day of Renewal sponsored by the Notre Dame-St. Mary's and The Queen of Peace charismatic prayer communities will be held this Sunday, Oct. 9, at the Queen of Peace parish hall in Osceola. The afternoon's activities will last from I :30-7:30 p.m. and all interested people are invited to attend. 
The day will consist of a series of talks and discussions and will be concluded with Mass and dinner. The purpose of a day of renewal is to provide a pleasant and informal setting in which a person can further explore his role as a member of the Christian commun­ity and in doing so, strengthen his commitment to Christ. 
There will be cars leaving from the library circle at 1 p.m. on Sunday to provide transportation for all those who need it. A small· donation is asked to cover the cost of the meal, but no one should hesitate to come because of lack o~ funds. Anyone interested in learn-j ing more about the day should call Fr.

turned his attention to the Middle 
East and received what he des­
cribed as a "positive" message 
from Egyptian President Anwar 
Sadat. 
The president refused to divulge 
the message from Sadat, which was 
delivered to Carter by Egyptian 
Foreign Minister Ismail Fahmy. 
However, Egypt is known to be 
concerned about an expanded 
Soviet role in the quest for a Middle 
East settlement and the absence so 
far of explicit U.S. support for a 
Palestinian state. 
Carter told Fahmy that ''if we can just keep the Arabs and Israelis moving in the right direction, we can see peace come." 
A key White House adviser told reporters the administration "anti­cipates a very difficult Geneva conference" and that it might even recess in discord. 
Carter's speech to the United Nations was termed by Oleg Jroyanovsk_v. the Soviet Ambass­ador to the U.N., as satisfactory. 
"On the whole, it was a well­balanced speech but there was nothing new in the U.S. position," he said. 
A lower-ranking Soviet represen­tative said the absence of any reference to human rights-Carter's major theme when he addressed the United Nations last spr.ing-was a "victory" for the Russians. 
British Ambassador Ivor Richard said he felt Carter "gave a major push to controlling proliferation of nuclear weapons and arms control." 
The President's announcement that an arms agreement is in sight was a turnaround from his earlier statements.

Carter had said only last week that there was no immediate prospect for a new weapons treaty with the Russians despite "some further progress." The President also had said after a White House meeting last week with Soviet Foreign Minister Adrei A. Gromyko that he wouldn't be "optimistic" about an early settlement. 
U.S. officials said some major differences had been resolved in talks which Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance held here with Gromyko. But they said there are other differences remaining to be resolved by negotiations in Geneva. 
The President was accorded a 
standing ovation as he entered the United Nation's hall for the second time since taking office. He read from a prepared! text and affirmed "the great trust" the United states continues to hold in the United Nations. 
He devoted much of his speech to arms control. 
"If we are to have any assurance that our children are to live out their lives in world that satisfies our hopes or that they will have a chance to live at all-we must finally come to terms with this enormous force and turn it to beneficial ends." 
On another subject, he called on Israel to respect the ''legitimate rights" of Palestinians. 
Carter told the General Assembly, whose Arab and Communist blocs weigh heavily against Israel, that the U.S. commitment to Israel's security is "unquestionable." And he said Israel is entitled to borders that are recognized and secure. 
At the same time, Carter said "for Nations which now have the the Arabs, the legitimate rights of capacity to export nuclear fuels and the Palestinians must be technologies have a solemn obli­reco~nized." -· gation, Carter said, "to ensure that

Senate votes to lift price controls 
W ASBINGTON (AP)-The Senate voted yesterday to lift price controls from newly discovered natural gas, rejecting President Jimmy Carter's proposal for contin­ued regulation of the scarce fuel. 
Breaking a two and one-half week deadlock, the Senate ap­proved the deregulation proposal by a SO to 46 vote, then went on to pass the overall natural gas bill by voice vote. 
A House-Senate conference com­mittee now must decide the final form the bill will take. The House passed acomprehensiveenergy bill in August that contained the Pres­ident's proposal for continued price controls. 
In New York, White House Press Secretary Jody Powell quoted Pres­ident Carter as terming the Senate legislation "unacceptable" and de­claring "I will not· sign an unfair bill." 
"It is an injustice to the working people of this country. . . " the President said. "I hope and expect that a reasonable bill will emerge from the conference committee and be approved by both houses. 
"I look forward to signing legis­lation that provides adequate pro­duction incentives while protecting the interests of American con­sumers. I will not sign an unfair bill." 
Deregulation would increase gas prices, with the cost of immediately deregulated gas rising at a faster rate than that remaining under federal price controls. The Senate bill contains a clause that would require gas pipelines to give home­owners the first chance to buy the cheaper gas still under government price controls. 
Under the Senate's deregulation measure, there would be a lid on prices of new gas of about 52.48 per thousand cubic feet for the next two years until controls are removed. The price limits would be removed from newly discovered onshore gas after two years and from offshore gas after five. 
Natural gas, which has increased four fold in price since 1973, is now unregulated· if used in the states where it is produced, but controlled under a $1.46 ceiling when shipped in interstate pipelines. 
Carter, and the House, want to end this du8J market by extending controls to the intrastate markets while lifting the price lid to $1.75 for newly discovered gas. 
The Senate's action was a major setback to Carter's energy program But it was expected after three previous trial votes showed dereg­ulation forces had the upper hand. The Senate passed a similar decon­trol measure in 1975, but it failed by four votes in the House. 
The vote came a day after a filibuster against deregulation col­lapsed. Both those who wanted to continue price controls and those who wanted them lifted had sought an end to the ftlibuster, which ti~d up Senate business for 13 days.
