A couple hours and a 198 yards from now, Notre Dame likely wilt have a new aU-time total offense leader. He's an easy-going fellow of many nicknames and many talents. The man whose record he breaks is a guy of many memories. Terry O'Neil tells about both on page 7.

A Funny Thing Happened to Allan 

ANHEUSER-BUSCH, INC. • ST. LOUIS • NEWARK • LOS ANGELES • TAMPA • HOUSTON • COLUMBUS 
By TERRY SHIELDS 
A funny thing happened to Denny Allan on his way to oblivion. He became a first team Notre Dame halfback and when one plays first string at NO he is given a great deal of acclaim. But it was not an easy road to fame for Allan. 
He came here much like any other freshman athelete. He had a great schoolboy record at St. John's High in Ashtabula, Ohio. In his senior year at St. John's he was All-city, All-conference and All-state at tailback and middle linebacker. Allan then received the usual (at least for an All-state Ohio tailback) offers from schools all over the country. He narrowed the field down to Syracuse and Notre Dame before making his final

decision. Denny says, "I visited both schools but I was most impressed with Notre Dame because of its great tradition and the fine coaching staff, especially Tom Pagna (offensive backfield coach)." His parents also were a great influence on his decision. (His roommate, Tom Eaton, a sophomore end, says, "His dad calls every night and they talk about football for at 
least a half hour.") 
So Denny Allan now had to prove that his high school clippings were for real. He

1Pick up a half-barrel of Bud"' (good for about 245 12-ounce cups ... with foam) and the tapping equip­ment on the day of the party. Just set the beer in a it cold. 
2Just before the party begins, tap your beer. First, make sure the beer faucet is closed (you wouldn't want to waste a drop of Beechwood Aged Bud!). Then, insert the faucet­and-pump unit into the upper valve of the keg, give it a quarter turn and lock it in place by tightening the lower wing nut. 
3Next, insert the lager tap in the lower valve of the keg and give it a quarter turn. set the keg upright in a tub and pack ice around it. 
4You're now ready to draw beer. Pump pressure to the proper point for good draw, usually about 15 lbs. That's all there is to it, but there's no rule against sampling just to make everything is perfect. Ahhhhh! It's no wonder you'll more taverns with the famous "Bud on Draught" sign than any other!

Remember the Wildcats 
Illinois is basically the same type team as Northwestern. And if your memory is not too short, you recall the Wildcats gave us a rough time for three quarters. lll inois will come into our stadium Saturday with the same idea that Northwestern had in mind-beat Notre Dame and make your season a success. But this is nothing new for the Irish. We realize this is the attitude of our opponents each week. The only week we do not have to worry about our opponent having this in mind is November 23. 
Illinois is looking for an upset, 
but the Irish have a few surprises 
in store for them. Purdue has 
been beaten and many of the 
other top teams will lose. We 
hope to be playing Southern Cal 
for the National Championship 
next month. However, we are 
not looking ahead. Illinois is our 
main concern and they must be 
beaten. 
Illinois boasts a very good one-two punch in the offensive backfield. Rich Johnson is a two-time All-America. In his junior year, he rushed for over 800 yards. Because of his team's record, he was overlooked for national recognition. This year 1 he has shown more speed and is having an even better season. 
Bob Naponic, their quarterback, is having a good year also. Naponic has had two major operations on his knees, 
which slowed him down considerably. So look for Naponic to stay in the pocket and direct his offense from

Denny Allan 
(Continued from page 2) 
started as a halfback on the freshman squad but when spring training rolled around he was an obscure third or fourth string. But by the time of the Blue-Gold Game he had moved up to second team. His determination finally paid off when he was given the starting nod for the Purdue game. He has been in the starting line-up ever since. Denny explains this rather simply. ·'I guess I just tried harder." (Denny must take lessons from Ara as the master of understatements.) 
In regard to his alternating between flanker and running back Allan says that he "enjoys the variety." But if he had to pick which he preferred it would be running back because "I get a kick out of the contact." 
Like most men on the team, the Ashtabula flash feels that we still have a strong chance to regain our number one ranking .

"Ara says that there are only six undefeated, untied teams in the top twenty. So anything can happen." 
Allan, who is a sophomore in the College of Arts and Letters, hopes to major in the English. During the winter he keeps in shape by boxing with the N.D. Boxing Club. Last year he made it to the finals in the heavyweight division in the 
Bengal Bouts. He was beaten 
by teammate Chuck Landolfi. 
This year he plans to "get 

back."  
Denny  is  a  doubtful  starter  
for  this  week's  game  against  
Illinois  due  to  a  pulled  

hamstring. (This is a recurring injury he first suffered in high school.) But with his determination he shouldn't be out of the line-up very long.

MEXICO CITY (UPI)-The high altitude here affects all the athletes differently. 
Most of them say you can have it but there are some who like it. Others say the height makes no difference at all. 
Then you take the Arkansas Razorbacks' football team. They're not here but they like the altitude anyway. The Hogs are way up there in the Southwest Conference with a 4-0 laundry mark and they like it fine except when some wit suggests that maybe they're living a little high on the Hog. 
The oddsmakers figure they'll tumble in their up-tight 
conference  confrontation  with  
Texas  at  Austin  Saturday.  I  
don't.  I  think  the  Hogs'  

soph-quarterback Bill Montgomery will get them home all right. 
Two of my other preferences are Tennessee over Alabama. The Vols are in love with their new home "track" which is pretty much the same material those 0 yll'lpic records are being set on here. And Indiana over Michigan because the Hoosiers figure they have something to prove. 
And then they wrote: 
Navy over Pittsburgh-You should've heard what the Pitt coach told his players after the Syracuse 50-17 shambles. It won't do any good. 
Rutgers over Army-see what happens when you're not looking. 
Princeton over Colgate-Red Raiders are gunning for the

Not Perfect ••• But Still Pretty Fair 
By TERRY O'NEIL 
Probably the first nickname 
his teammates hung on him was 
"The Rat" 
Soon h e b u r s t onto 
national magazine covers 
with a couple of super games 
and the publicity men began 
staying up all night, trying to 
discover a name the fans could 
remember in their sleep. 
Roger Valdiserri volunteered 
"Mr. Fling." Joe Doyle 
contributed "The Butler Bullet." 
Then last year, fullback Ron Dushncy (one of his closest friends) came up with the tag that stuck-'The Gobbler." 
Today, . Terrance Hugh (The 
Gobbler) Hanratty is at least 
even money to become Notre 
Dame's all time total offense 
leader, thereby surpassing a man 
whose nickname has adorned 
more than a million square yards 
of sheet signs-The Gipper. 
George Gipp played four 
years of football with the Irish 
(1917-20), saw action in 28 
games and gained 4,110 yards 
rushing and passing. 
A broken ankle eliminated 
him from the last two games of 
1917. lie played full scheduales 
the next two years. Then, in 
1920, with only the final game 
at Michigan State remaining, 
"The Gipper" contracted a strep 
throat and died less than a 
month later (Dec. 14, 1920) at 
age 25. 
For nearly 50 years, Gipp's 
mark stood unchallanged, 
despite names like Bertelli 
Lujack, Williams, Guglielmi, and 
Hornung. 
But today, in the 24th game of his college career, (or next Saturday at the latest) Hanratty will smash Gipp's total offense standard and then spend the rest of 1968 putting it so far out of reach that it may never be broken again. 
Indeed, it will be a long time before any Irish player is presented with circumstances so ideal for stacking up total 
offense yardage. Consider: 
-When Terry went to spring practice at the end of his freshman year, there was no upperclass quarterback. He had only Coley O'Brien to beat out for the job. lie did just that and became a three-year starter. 
-!lis coach is one of the game's most ardent proponents of wide-open football.

-Terry has been blessed with some of Notre Dame's finest pass catchers in Jim Seymour, Bob Gladieux and Rocky Bleier. Seymour is the all-time leading receiver and Gladieux currently is tied for seventh on the list. 
None of the above is meant to discredit Hanratty's superb performance over the past two and a half seasons. Surely, the principal reason nobody will smell his record for a long time is because, well, there just aren't many guys near him in ability. 
"lie's the finest quarterback I've ever been associated with," says Irish offensive backfield coach Tom Pagna. "And for speed of the ball, distance, trajectory and relative accuracy, he's got the finest arm I've ever seen in college football. 
"He's given us a very fluid offense here. There's a lot of things you can do with a boy like Terry. We've assembled a lot of offense around him. 
"Besides his arm, he's very quick-footed. Not just for a man his size (&-I, 213), but for any quarterback. I'm sure he'll be a to pro draft pick and he's got an excellent chance to make it. He's tall enough to see out of the pocket, he's quick enough to move from the pocket when rushed and he's very knowledgable about football. I hope he has a fine pro career. He deserves it." 

Pagna 's accolades are weii-directed. Hanratty leads the all-time NO forward passing list in every department save two. 
He is five scoring flips behind Angelo Bertelli in touchdown passes and .026 behind Frank 


Tripucka in completion "Every time there's an percentage. interception, the quarterback automatically takes the blame. 
It is also true, however, that But we've had interceptionsTerry is the most intercepted because pass patterns were run passer in Irish history, and it is wrong, because of tipped balls,

his defense. 
of cours_e, some because of bad "You know," he begins," 
throws," Pagna explains. The big complaint amongwe've had people come in here armchair quarterbacks is thatto the coach's offices, to the Terry sometimes "forces the ball Stadium, to my house or to one 
in" to a well-covered receiver and misses a secondary receiver who is open. Rebuttal, once again by Pagna: 
"Sure, I'll admit that 
sometimes Terry unconsciously 
hunts for Jim Seymour. But 
that's because most of the time 
he knows Jim can work free if 
he's coverend. You'll find this 
same situation with lots of 
passing combinations, like Starr 
and Dowler for instance. Most of 
the time, he can get the ball to 
Seymour, but when he doesn't, ' 
you hear people say he forced 
it." 
On the the question of secondary receivers, Pagna says, "one some of our patterns, there is not such thing as a secondary receiver. One guy is out there to be a decoy and the other one is supposed to get the ball. Now, if he's well covered or he trips and falls down, Terry has to start moving and improvising. Most of the time, he has success, but you 
only hear about the few times when he doesn't. 
"He has some things to work on. One of his biggest flaws is confidence. He's so confident in his arm that often he doesn't set himself and get properly balanced before he throws," Pagna adds. 
Other than those few items, Hanratty's biggest trouble is the fact that he can't thrrow the ball 50 yards with his left hand. 
But, like Pagna says, "He's not a machine. None of us was f!lade perfect."
