Buffalo's cold reality 
Ahh, Super Bowl season once again, a treasured time for sports fans. For me, however, this time of year brings a host of tortured memories. 
Let me clarify. I'm from Buffalo. B~sides wisecracks about the snow, 
Julie Bender 
Buffalo also has a history of athletic letdowns. News Wlre 
Where do I Editor begin? Maybe with the loss of our NBA franchise in 1978? Or perhaps with our failed bid for a Major League Baseball team? Or how about with former Buffalo Bill O.J. Simpson's murder trial? 
These events all wounded the Buffalo pride, but nothing hurt as badly as our four-year Super Bowl run in the early '90s. 
Though I was only six years old when the Bills faced the New York Giants in Super Bowl XXV, I remember it vividly. Buffalo had never been to a Super Bowl before, and football fever invaded our snowy city. 
I remember having "Bills Days" at school, which I took to an extreme with my Bills sweatshirt, my large helmet ear­rings and my "Zubaz" striped hat. Bills songs played on the radio, and young boys had the Bu!Talo logo buzzed into their hair. 
Everyone knows how the story ends, but only those from Bull'alo know the pain of watching Scott Norwood attempt tho47-yard lield goal with four seeonds to go and Buffalo down by one. The eeho ol'that infamous kiek still resounds in my !wad, as do those awful words, "Wide right." 
Stunned. Buffalo fans consoled each other with the sad chorus, "There's always next year." And, for once, they were right as we were blessed with limr Super Bowls in a row. The pain ol' losing those lour Super Bowls, though, took its toll on the fans. I still remember our last Super Bowl loss to the Dallas Cowboys. I felt disgusted as they showed a television close-up of Jimmy Johnson. As I turned around, I felt sadness watching my brother brush away tears as my dad hugged him. 
Though Buflalo football has never been the same, we got another chance at a national championship with the Sabres in 1999. My family sat on the couch, our eyes glued to the TV as game six of the Stanley Cup went into its third overtime against the Dallas Stars: We weren't giv­ing up. 
That is, we didn't give up until' the Stars' Brett Hull tapped in the game-win­ning goal. As the Stars poured onto the ice in celebration, the replay showed that Hull's skate had been in the crease. Despite a review of the goal, Dallas was declared the winner. To this day, Buffalo fans protest the game with "No Goal" bumper stickers on their cars. 
Buffalo has gotten the raw deal in sports too many times, but our fans are resilient. Maybe it's our naive hope and constant pride-or maybe it's that we've come to grips with the cold reality of losing. 
Either way, up in Buffalo, we're used to the cold.

Sarin addressed need for post office 
University founder's vision brought campus benefits through the years 
Special to The Observer 

Anyone familiar with Notre Dame's history knows thn University's founder, Father Edward F. Sorin, C.S.C., was a fim~eful. even blunt, loader who lnt nothing stand in the way of his vision for the institution. flo was "one of' those people who assume that they should be in charge and p1·ocend accordingly," wrote Fath1~r James T. Connelly, C.S.C., nditor of "The Chronicles of Notre Dame duLac." 
Among the early projects on which Sorin took charge was the petition lilr a U.S. post ollicn on the Univnrsity's grounds -with him, of course, a.<> postma.o;ter. 
Beyond the convenienen faetor, Sorin knew there were many other benefits associated with having a fnderal facility on the campus, induding the opportuni­ty to generate revenue, the inclu­sion of Notre Dame on all ollidal government maps, and the assurance that roads leading to the campus would be better maintained. 
Given Notre Dame's proximity to South Bend, U.S. postal olli­cials said there was no need for a separate ollice on campus and rejected Sorin's rnqunst in early 1850. Aceustomed to getting his way, the French priest then turned to Henry Clay, the well known and respected U.S. Senator from Kentucky, for a.<>sis­tance. llow or why Sorin and Clay knew each othnr is a mys­tery, but the extra clout proved eJTective, and a post office was ol'l'ieially established at Notre Dame on .Jan. 6, 1S51. S(irin was appointed postma.o;tnr, a position he held until his dnath in 1S93. 

The post ollicn was a modest operation in its first year of exis­tence. There was no separate building and postal receipts amounted to just $36.02, according to an artiele published by tho Northern Indiana Philatelic Soeicty. Business

Train wreck suspect faces charges 
Associated Press 
GLENDALE, Calif. -Thn suicidal man who authorities say caused the chain-reaction train derailment that killed 11 people has been charged with multiple counts of murder and could face the death penalty, the district attorney said Thursday. 
Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, lef't his sport utility vehicle on a railroad traek Wednesday after changing his mind about committing suicide, authorities said. He was held with­out bail at a hospital's jail ward after apparently slitting his own wrists and stabbing himself in the 
chest. 

In addition to the 11 dead, nearly 200 people were injured. The last person reported missing was accounted-for Thursday and fire­lighters ended recovery efforts. All but one of the dead had been iden­tified. 
Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley said prosecu­tors filed charges late Wednesday for 10 counts of murder with "spe­cial circumstances" of committing murder through a train derailment. Cooley stressed however that the ease were still being evaulated. Under state law, special circum­stances allegations could makn a 
defendant eligible ftlr the dnath penalty. 
Cooley said the complaint would be amended to add anothM eount to refer to the 11th victim, found in the wreekage late Wednnsday night. And he said tho def'ondant's suicidal intent didn't make any dif­ference to him. 
"lie's not going to nngagn rny sympathy because he was dnspon­dent. llis despondency doesn't move me," the district attomny told The Associated Press. 
Arraignment was initially plamwd for Thursday aftnrnoon hut was put ofT until Friday beeausn of Alvarnz's medical condition.

father, Gregg. "Once she found out we had a professional plumber come it to look at everything, she stopped threat­ening." 
Russwurm did not respond to repeated requests from The Obs1~rver for comment for this article. 
According to Trench, the cause of the damage was not in fact that the heat was turned ofT (though the tenants claim it was indeed left on), but rather negligence on the part of man­agement to correct a flaw in the piping system that caused a similar situation several years ago. 
In the inspection report given to Gregg Boyd, Trench wrote due torepair work that had already been performed, he "could not see any damaged piping." Instead, "the pipes were in an open chase that was opnn to the attic ... these pipes will freeze again if not correct­ed properly," Trench noted. "Insulation will not solve the problem." 
"Trench told us, 'I was the plumber that worked on this problem before, and I told them how to fix it, and they wouldn't pay for it,"' Gregg Boyd said. "They just paid for the patch. Heat wouldn't have affected it. It wasn't the tenants' fault." 
The inspection was complet­ed on Jan. 6, he said. 
Since Jan. 12 further damage has been discovered in the apartments, and communica­tion with Paramount has become increasingly difficult, Kristin Boyd said. 
"Yesterday I found mold growing in our closet," she said. "But management has been telling us for weeks there is no mold and yet won't give us back the mold test we requested." 
Her roommate, senior Elizabeth Cain, said Russwurm's absence from her office the past week has made obtaining the results of the mold test nearly impossible. 
"The company [who per­formed the mold test] said that the test was completed but that they were not allowed to dis­close the results," Cain said. "So I called Paramount. But they said Patty was out of town." 
In the Jan. 12 Observer arti­cle, Husswurm said huge eiTorts were put forth to ensure the apartments returned to a liv­able condition. 

"It has been very difficult to try to get students back in to their apartments," Russwurm said. "We have had contractors, cleaning crews, disaster relief agencies, all working 24n to repair the damage." 
But now the tenants are seek­ing an explanation for why their furniture, now covered in dry wall, was not removed from the apartments before the repairs were made. 
Local general contractor Philip Mosby, Jr., who was hired to repair the drywall in the apru1ments, defended Paramount, commending the company's professionalism and practicali­ty. 
"I did suggest that it would be a good idea to move the furni­ture out before I began work­ing, but they [management] told me that they couldn't move the furniture because the students had to be there to give them the okay," Mosby said. 
Gregg Boyd and his daughter, however, maintain a different story. 
In a document Gregg Boyd compiled of the problems he has encounter.ed with Paramount, he wrote, "Paramount refused to pay the fees required to move out the furnishings of the tenants. Thus they were piled up in the mid­dle of the rooms, left wet, get­ting mold." 
Amid all the controversy, other students living in the damaged apartments are seek­ing a peaceful reconciliation. 
"I would just like to move on and just make sure everything is covered," said Kristin Boyd's neighbor, senior Conner O'Keefe. "But as far as my anger is toward Paramount, I'm still disappointed in the way they handled it." 
For the Boyds, filing a lawsuit is the next step. 
"The suit would be against all the parties that have been involved," Gregg Boyd said. "They have been persecuting these students that have been devastated by something that did not need to happen." 
Russwurm told The Observer for the Jan. 12 article that Paramount did not intend to file lawsuits against the student tenants.

presidency. They also claimed to be free of the "greed, vice and corruption" they said plagued student government. 
The fact that half of the candidates have worked side by side on some of this year's hot-button issues has led to similar platforms ­focusing on points like put­ting a student on the Board of Trustees, securing a con­cert endowment and finding a new process for ticket dis­tribution -but they all indi­cated the solutions they offer are what set each ticket apart. 
"We all respect each other, but at the same time have different ways to approach­ing issues, which is why many of us are running," Leito said. 
As the Notre Dame student body proved last year after electing Adam Istvan and Karla Bell, relative newcom­ers to the student govern­ment scene, experience is not the ultimate measuring stick. The candidates agreed, calling a working knowledge of the student government useful in accom­plishing goals, but indicated the need for a deeper moti­vation. 
"Experience is no doubt a benefit in terms of knowing the system, relating to administrators and trustees, and mobilizing the student body. However, experience will only take a president and vice president so far," Baron said. "It takes inge­nuity and resourcefulness to make real changes happen."

ITALY 
Country begins 2006 Oly111pic preparation 
Associated Press 
TURIN -Figure skaters glide across the freshly laid ice at the renovated Palavela arena. Short-track speedskat­ing is a big hit with the locals. Ski and bobsled races come oll' without a hitch in the sur­rounding Alps. 
One year before the 2006 Winter Olympics, Turin and the Piedmont region of northwest­ern Italy are getting a taste of the real thing. 
So far, so good. 
Despite continuing budget, sponsorship and housing prob­lems, a series of successful test event<> has eased concerns over the statH of preparations for the Feb. 10-26, 2006, showcase­the first Winter Games in Italy since Cortina d'Ampezzo in 1956. 
"I don't want any triumphal­ism -I'm aware that we still have a lot of work to do," organizing committee chief Valentino Castellani said. "But we don't have delays or emer­gencies." 
A few months ago, Turin's preparations were being com­pared to Athens' frenzied, last­minute race to get ready for the 2004 Summer Olympics. Now there's a sense of relative calm among local organizers and International Olympic Committee officials. 
"I don't think there is any possible comparison between Athens and Turin," said Gilbert Felli, the IOC's executive direc­tor for the Olympic Games. "The venue for figure skating is ready. The venues for cross­country, ski jumping and all the Alpine skiing are ready, so there is nothing to compare with Athens. They are on track." 
Felli spoke after attending this week's opening of the European Figure Skating Championships at the 8,250­seat Palavela, featuring an arching cement roof resem­bling a billowing sail. 
Workers were still painting and tinkering with wires days before the event, but completed the job just in time. 
The PalaveJa also hosted the European short-track speed­skating championships this month, drawing full crowds for a sport with little following in Italy. 
Cross-country ski races took place Jan. 22-23 in Pragelato; bobsled and skeleton events were held Jan. 20-23 and luge events are scheduled for Feb. 5-6 in Cesana-Pariol. In December, the World Cup ski circuit made its annual stop in Sestriere, a resort founded by Fiat's Agnelli family that will be the center for Alpine events during the Olympics. 
Ice sports will be in down­town Turin and snow events in Sestriere and surrounding vil­lages, about 62 miles from the city. There will be three Olympic villages -one in Turin for 2,500 athletes and coaches and two more in the mountains for an equal number of com­petitors. Housing problems remain in the Alpine zone for fans, media and others.

Bank agrees to $16 million fine 


Riggs Bank pleads guilty to charges of failing to report suspicious transactions 
Associated Press 
Wi\SIIINGTON-Higgs Bank pleaded guilty Thursday to failing to report suspieious transac­tions in the accounts of for­eigners, induding two dic­tators, and agreed to a $16 million proposed line. 
It would be the largest crimi11al penalty ever imposed on a bank of Higgs' size, according to prosecu­tors, and eomes atop a meord $25 million eivil line levied on the bank by a Treasury Department agency last May. 
The plea agreement still needs the approval of U.S. Distriet Judge Hicardo Urbina, who expressed skepticism about the penal­ty's adf1quacy at a !waring Thursday.

break -bringing the campus community to full size and strength -would go towards relief efforts. Then other student and administrative leaders joined in, as representatives from Student Government, International Student Services and Activities, the Athletic Department and the Office of Student Affairs chose to work together to organize various collections and fundraisers, from basketball games to benefit dinners. In recognizing that they could do more together than apart, the Tsunami Relief Drive's planners acted with savvy, gen­erosity and perspective. 
Notre Dame's response to the tragedy was not only ment to the Church's charitable mission. 
In all, an impressive $173,000 was collected from the Notre Dame community during the past two weeks­enough to make a difference in rebuilding hundreds of livelihoods. 
A similar amount of money could very well have come from individual donations. Any money is all the same to the victims. But the fact that Notre Dame's relief efforts were staked on strong undercurrents of cooperation and Catholicism-not competition -makes the University an admirable public example. 
And the best part is that it wasn't trying to be.

Combating 'senioritis' 
For the soon-to-be graduating class of 2005, January brings the beginning of the end of what is commonly referred to as "the Notre Dame experi­ence." Most seniors, this writer includ­ed, morph into an unusual mode of exis­Gary Caruso tence during their final semesters on Capitol campus. It is a condi­Comments tion uniformly described as "senioritis," but one with many symptoms, some unique only to certain individuals. 
The Board of Trustees eventually cures senioritis each spring by confer­ring degrees, although peculiar symp­toms may linger long after some matriculated students physically depart campus. To adequately understand the atmosphere that has just presently begun but climaxes in May, begin with the choice of commencement speaker and work backwards through time. 
Graduating classes take on the char­acter of their commencement speakers and honorary degree recipients. Each class strives for the most globally pres­tigious marquee of speakers, often­times hoping for a president on the dais, and certainly seeking anyone affiliated with Notre Dame. This year, as the turmoil of death headlines the Iraqi war and a tsunami in the Far East, the atmosphere begs for a speak­er who epitomizes the qualities of humility and sacrifice. The logical choice is Notre Dame Professor Emeritus Gil Loescher, the world's fore­most authority on refugees, displaced persons and forced migration due to famine and war. In 2003, Loescher was the sole survivor of the Baghdad blast that leveled the United Nations head­quarters. 
As a result of his ordeal, Professor Loescher is a double amputee. His is a remarkable story of survival that was featured in last spring's Notre Dame Alumni Magazine. The University also responded quite generously to assist with the professor's staggering medical bills. The commencement selection committee would do well to summon Loescher to convey his personal strug­gles, revelations, faith and revised view of life now that he has felt the breath of God while trapped in a building's rub­ble. Notre Dame's Loescher is the living embodiment of the character of every fallen veteran and civilian in the bloody Iraqi conflict. His insight would leave no eye dry in the Convocation Center. 
Wet eyes and aching hearts are obvi­ous symptoms of senioritis. Sometimes eyes water on our day of departure, but many times hearts swell when each of us, regardless of whether or not we asked, gain a further sense of commu­nity for having attended Notre Dame. Ultimately, time catches up with every senior who is thrust into the final semester. They are forced to think of losing their friends, moving their sur­roundings and changing their lifestyles. Ready or not, senioritis sets into their consciousness. 
The best way to combat early January senioritis is to slow time by savoring each moment of the final semester at Notre Dame. I can still vividly remember my birthday party in February, interhall sports, broadcast­ing at the campus radio station, attend­ing a spring dance, Bookstore Basketball, playing pranks on my fel­low Domers and several other warm memories of my second semester of senior year. I forced time to crawl for nearly four months. 
By semester's end, I moved closer toward my faith and came to better know some of my closest classmates whom I thought I knew for three and a half years prior. Appreciating my sur­roundings helped cleanse me of many prejudices and allowed me to absorb many of the diverse perspeetives espoused by others. Ironically, my slowed sense of time had excellorated my learning curve. 
By opening ourselves to our sur­roundings when we savor each moment, we also gain many subtle insights into life. My last semester bestowed upon me more of a sense of belonging to Notre Dame. I can say with all honesty that I moved closer to better understanding how Notre Dame graduates are attracted to a higher call of community, public and family serv­ice. Upon my graduation, I could feel the ghosts of those who had gone before me struggling. 'A(ith similade!t.,;rfl sons and feelings. 
Those of us who are currently mere ghosts of another time on campus con­tinue to live in the blood of the bricks. Once we pass through Notre Dame, our heartaches and triumphs can soon be forgotten. I, however, can reflect on what once was mine but remains so vividly portrayed in a scene similar to Dickens' "A Christmas Carol." 
On a long-ago May 20 when I watched the golden dome disappear in my rearview mirror, I conquered senioritis despite my lingering feelings of heartache and loss. What could have been a fiasco of my final semester actu­ally was the most memorable of my tenure at Notre Dame. 
Although my boring and unimpres­sive commencement speaker has since faded from my memory, my final semester remains a colorful part of me. Countering senioritis is more of a process than a remedy, a process that can begin well before January of senior year rather than after our exodus from campus. The trick is diagnosing your personal symptoms and starting your savoring process.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Harvard president's cotntnents inappropriate 
Call to all 'real' basketball fans 
Whon I rntunwd to my room aftnr class Wednesday I had a voic(1flHtil from my morn. Slw wanted mo to rnad the society portion of tho latest Newswenk -some­thing about tlw presidnnt of Harvard, sei­(~ncn and the inmlnquatnnnss of women.

Tlw artie!~ wont on to point put that throughout tho country, women account for rwarly half the baelwlor's dogroes earned in dwmistry and math hut only about 10 pNcnnl of the faeulty. Or how about the fart that only four of 32 fnmale !'acuity mPmbors were offered tenure last year'!

Every career-minded woman, in science and beyond, must deal with the issue of a demanding work schedule and the prospects of an adequate family life. llowever, I would like to suggest to Summers, and anyone who might secretly agree with him, that it is attitudes and soci­ety that are inadequate, not tho scientific aptitude of women. 
Even more disheartening is that women who are entering tho doctorate programs ani eventually linding themselves disillu­siorwd with the environnwnt, tired of searching for understanding mentors and are ultimately pursuing career options with the government or industry in order to avoid the struggle of elimbing the faculty ladder. 
Tho bottom line is that as a female col­lege student navigating through the rigors of a science-based curriculum at a top uni­versity, I do not appreciate a former econo­mist telling me what I am innately capable of doing in comparison to my male class­mates. I think it is a hard curriculum and I think we're all in the same boat.

Vagina Monologues deserve students' attention 
I was sorry to rnad that Peter Wicks has such a low opin­ion of tlw annual production of the Vagina Monologues. If he doesn't like the show, that's his prerogative. He's obviously rnad it, which is more than a lot of the people who complain about it can say. 
llow1wer, while his ridicule of the February furor that descm1ds on campus every year is relatively accurate, it is limitod in that it !'ails to address the reasons behind our pro­d uetion of the show and all the activities surrounding it. 
V-Day campaigns around the world generate broader attention for the light to stop violence against women and girls, including rape, baW1ry, incest, female genital mutila­tion and sexual slavery. Along with three benefit perform­ances of tho Vagina Monologues, we will be holding a week­long campaign to address the issue or campus rape. Proceeds from ticket sales and other donations will be going to the YWCA of St. Joseph County and Sex Offense Services in South BmHI. 
The student body of Notre Dame is notoriously apathetic about anything that does not involve sports, aleohol or abor­tion. Without the controversy surrounding the Vagina Monologuos, very few pnople would buy tickets to see the show, and not many morn than that would take a moment to think about any of the prndicamenls that women face today. 
If you're uncomfortahlo with the word "vagina," do not watch this show. (;o on your merry way. I lopefully, you and yours will nevnr have to deal with the pain of sexual assault. 
Still, whilo tho ongoing dnbato has brought this issue to your attention, at least do a little bit of independent research lir yourself on viohmee against women or donate to one of tlw many organizations working to eombat it. 
Try to remember that thoro arn thousands of women worldwide who can'tjoke about all the controversy and walk away as nasily as you do.

United States the victilll of political correctness 
Poor SpongeBob. It's hard enough going through life in a pair of SquarePants. Now he stands accused of participating in a video that some con­servatives call "pro-gay propaganda." 
Makers of the video deny the claim, instead pointing out the video promotes unity and cooperation. But a 
Adam 
Kotlarczyk
spokesman for the conservative 

group Focus on the Family insists it is "manipulating and Northern potentially brainwashing kids." Illinois 
People, when a cartoon University sponge is no longer politically Northern Star correct, it's time for some cul­tural soul-searching. 
Not long ago, political correctness was a rela­tively harmless (if highly irritating) practice reserved largely for liberals. A "chairman" became a "chairperson,' a female·poet, a "poet-· ess." Although often annoying, these changes in how we talk were intended to make the American English language as diverse and inclusive as America. 
But liberals no longer hold the monopoly on political correctness -and PC no long~r means diversity and inclusiveness. Since the days imme­diately after Sept. 11, 2001, when then-White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer warned Americans they "need to watch what they say 1and 1watch what they do," it seems it is conserva­tive groups that have more and more frequently sought to control how we talk, how we act and what we see. 
This past Veteran's Day, for example, ABC want­ed to show the Oscar-winning "Saving Private Hyan" unedited, but several afTIJiates refused to air it despite having dono so in past years. The conservative group American Family Association applauded the move. Why? The movie has bad language. 
\ 
And that brings us back to the unfortunate Mr. SquarePants. It's bad enough that elemonts of our society hypocritically deny rights like marriage to homosexuals while simultaneously using them for entertainment, enjoying shows like "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" and "Will and Grace." But in 
, criticizing SpongeBob for even suggesting homo­. sexuality (because he often holds hands with another male character), we're now offended not just by gay rights, but by the slightest hint of potentially gay mannerisms. Which brings us to the all-important question: Where does that leave the Smurfs'? I mean, you can't tell me that in a whole village with only one female, there wasn't at least a little locker-room experimentation going on. A joke, of course, but if this craze of conserva­tive-style political. correctness doesn't subdun, what else is at risk? Will we apply it to literature, as well? In Tolkien's "Lord of the Hings," for example, Frodo and Sam frequently hold hands (never mind that Sam goes on to marry and have a passel of hobbit-kids). Should we keep that work away from children, too'? Naturally, not all people who are conservative ot· religious support this new politieal correctness. But when their views are mismprosnnted by their leaders or organizations (as, I would guess, many have benn by SpongeBob-gate) and they remain largely silent, it becomes incumbent on them to unite (they don't need to hold hands) and speak out against anyone -liberal or fellow conserva­tive -who seeks to manipulate their views.

Looking for a hint of warmth during these cold South Bend days? Legends is providing enter­tainment with a Latin flare tonight with Banda Hika. Named Chicago's best Salsa/Meringue band in 2002, the first band from the suburbs to gain that distinc­tion, Banda Hika comes to Legends with a great reputation. With a show featuring salsa, meringue, cumbia and bachata, Banda Hika promises entertain­ment and excitement. 
The 12 members of Banda Rika are split into a 10-piece "Orquesta" and a two-person front line.. Brass, bongos, bass, piano and other instruments back up vocalists Ramon Hiviera and Luis Berrios. Formed in 1999, Banda Rika began by open­ing for a show called "Grupo Kaos." 
As anyone who has listened to good Latin music can guess, the musicians leave no room for boredom anywhere they perform. The music and dancing are sure to provide enough energy and warmth for the entire room. There isn't much in the world of music that can equal a great Latin band -show up tonight to hear one of the best for miles around. 
The show starts at 10 p.m. on the club side of Legends.

Matt Wertz did not begin his life with aspirations of becoming a songwriter and performer. In fact, earlier in his life his aspiration was actually to become a shoe designer. Fortunately for Matt and the crowd that will be at Legends Saturday, Matt left those dreams behind after he began writing songs during his freshman year of college. 
The acoustic guitar player claims on his Web site that originally, "When I began writing songs, I never intended for anyone to hear them ... It was simply the natural outpouring of my heart." Fans of Wertz across the ·country are grate­ful his songs, comparable to the, likes of John Mayer and Jack Johnson, have come out and met the reeeptive fan base Wertz has started to create for himself through national touring in the last year and a half. 
Wertz's show is sure to be light and entertaining. 
Matt Wertz will be preceded by Notre Dame senior Kevin Leicht who is also a solo artist. Leicht will begin playing at 10 p.m. at the club side of Legends. If an enjoyable and laid back show is what your Saturday night needs, then Legends will most probably be the place for you.

A 
sold-out Lei!{hton Concert llall at the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center awaits anoth­er world-class perform­ance from the Chieftains, some of the best-known ambassadors of Irish music. 
Tlu~ Chidtains have bmm successful partly through bridging a gap between modt~rn and traditional Celtic. musk and roaching out to both fan bases. The group plays traditional Celtic reels and ballads with tlw best, but brandws out in pm·forming with prmnier artists from many gmu·ns. Some artists have lost erndihility through similar endeavors, but the Chinftains have succeeded in nutking many styles their own. 
Tho ChiPI'tains were formed in Dublin in 1962 with tlw intent of performing traditional Celtic musi<:. The group's legacy bears a semblanco to the English group tho King's Singers who performed at the Leighton Concert llall in November. Paddy Moloney founded the original group and still performs today as its front man. Moloney performs on the Uilleann (pronounced "illian") Pipes and tin whistle. Other musicians include Kevin ConnetT on the Bodhran (an Irish drum pronounced "bough-rawn") and voeals, Sean Keane on the fiddle and Matt Molloy on /lute. 
The Chieftains have crossed over to rock music by performing with guest artists including Pete Townshed, Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello and fellow Irishman Van Morrison. On "Long Black Veil" the group performs with the Rolling Stones, Sting, and even Tom .Jones. On "Down the Old Plank Hoad: The Nashville Sessions" the Chieftains also performed with bluegrass greats like Bela Fleck, Tim O'Brien and Allison Kraus. 
Since its creation, the group has enjoyed the luxury of an appreciative audience. The band first garnered acclaim in Ireland and England, when it maintained a senti-professional, part­time aspect to its work. The band broke out internationally with its scoring of' the 1975 lilm "Barry Lyndon." After a four­decade long career, the Chieftains have released 44 albums, with their next album, a tribute to departed member Derek Lowe, due in stores Feb. 22. 
The Chieftains also set several per­formance milestones for Western music, becoming the first Western music group to tour China in 1983 (a tour that included a performance on the Great  Wall of China), and breaking worldwide concert records with a 1979 concert in Dublin before 1.35 million people including Pope John Paul II. The band's current tour takes it throughout the United States up until late March, and includes performances at Clrdwst.ra llall in Chieago and tho Kemwdy Cnntnr in Washington, D.C. 
So great is tho Chieftains' reputation for traditional Irish music that in 19S9 the Hnpublie of' ln~land appointed them tho ol'fieial musk ambassadors /'or Ireland. Even so, tho band has prov1~d to not only be a driving /'oren through Irish music, but through tlw popular musir culture as a whole. Its work has recP-ived 10 Gram my nominations, and it won tho award multiple times through­out the 1990s. Its "Barry Lyndon" scor­ing was awarded with an Oscar, and it has provided musk for numerous film, television and stage produt:t.ions.

Brady trying to downplay Montana comparisons 
Associated Press 
FOXBOHO, Mass. -Tom Brady played in his driveway 20 miles south of San Francisco and pretended to be Joe Montana. He even tried to spot the 49ers' quarterback at Super Bowl victo­ry parades. 
Today, Brady is often com­pared to the Hall of Farner and children look up to the New England star the way he did to Montana. 
"It's really neat on Halloween when you see those jerseys," Brady said Thursday. "I had a lit­tle kid come up to my door with a No. 12 jersey on. It's like, 'Oh, man.' It's just come such a long way." 
From part-time starter at Michigan to sixth-round draft choice to two-time Super Bowl MVP. Brady has made huge strides in a hurry. He's just 27, but is in position to help the Patriots become only the second team to win three Super Bowls in four years. 
But he's still behind Montana's four Super Bowl wins and eight Pro Bowl selections. Brady, head­ed to his second Pro Bowl, admits he's uncomfortable with the comparisons. 
''I'm very flattered," Brady said. "I don't think I'm on that level (and) I'm still trying to get better." 
But he's not easily distracted once he sets his goals. 
He had a fever last weekend but still played brilliantly in the Patriots' 41-27 over Pittsburgh in the AFC championship game. But he said he never came close to missing the game and down·· played the illness. 
"There's a lot of guys who were sick and a lot of guys aren't feel·­ing good and a lot of guys are probably playing with tougher ailments than I was," Brady said. "Guys have been doing that all year. 
"Everyone plays with great toughness and never complains. A little !lu bug. Like that's a big deal. You know (the attention it got) takes aw~y from what thosn guys do." 
He wouldn't say how sick he was but said he was feeling bet­ter Thursday. 
Montana completed 63.2 per­cent of his passes and is seventh in NFL history in touchdown passes and eighth in yards pass­ing in 13 full seasons. Elbow problems sidelined him for the entire 1991 season and limited him to one game in 1992. 
Brady has completed 61.6 per­'cent of his passes in five seasons, including his rookie year when he played just one game, and is 8-0 in the playoffs. Montana was 7-1 in his first eight postseason games before finishing at 16-7. 
"Tom is as competitive as Montana," said Patriots third-


string quarterback Jim Miller, a 10-year yeteran. "I just think Tom's got a great feel for the game. He just has a great feel when to move in the pocket, when a certain guy's going to be open." 
Brady has improved his accu­racy and game management since he took the starting job after Drew Bledsoe was hurt in the second game of the 2001 sea­son. 
"When he's in the zone, I don't think there's anybody better," tight end Christian Fauria said. 
The charismatic star has made such an impression that his teammates hear about it at home. 
"Troy Brown tells me his little kid says I'm his favorite player," Brady said. "So when you hear stuff like that from your own teammate you get the biggest kick out of it." 

As his achievements pile up in a career that should last many more years, more fans will wear his No. 12 jersey and admire the kid who once tossed a football in a driveway not far from where Montana was becoming an idol. 
"I lopefully," Fauria said, "peo­ple will bn comparing other peo­ple to him. Iley, you got that Tom Brady quality. That would be more of a compliment than any­thing."

MLB 
Delgado's four-year deal with Marlins finalized 
Associated Press 
Mli\MI -Carlos Dolgado and tlw Florida Marlins final­iznd tlwir $52 million, l'our­yoar contract Thursday, a rnovo that could chango the halanco ol' pownr in tho NL Hast. 
Dolgado, who hit at least :~0 honw runs nach of the past night seasons with Toronto, passed his physical Wndnesday and was introducml at a news conl'nrnncc1 . 
.. 1 want to put mysell' on a tnam that has a chanco to win, and that's tho Florida Marlins," Dnlgado said. "I can't wail to mnnt tlw guys." 
J!lorida won out over the Nc~w York Mots, who .also 
o ITn n~ d $ 5 2 m i II i o n , a n d Baltimorn and Texas, whieh (Htch ol'fnrc~d $4H million. 
"I think this is tho best lit for nw to havo a dHtnce to win," l>nlgado s1tid. "i\nd thn fact that. it's nico and warm here, thn fact that it's only only two hours from Puorto Hico, yeah, it is vory nicn as wnll, it's gravy." 
llis addition is a boost to the Marlins, who are trying to put together a financing package for a new ballpark. 
"It shows my desire to win. Everybody knows how I hate to lose," Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria said. "This signing makes porfeet sense for this team at this time." 
Florida is trying to end i\tlanta'~ record streak of 13 conseeutivo division titles. 
"I still think they're the team to beat," Marlins manager Jack McKeon said. "They find a way to como up with the players. Everybody gave the Bravns a goodbye last year, and look what happened." 
There's no assurance the Marlins will be bettor than last year after losing aee Carl Pavano (1H-8) and elosnr Armando Benitez (47 saves) to free agency. 
General manager Larry Beinfest signed AI Leiter to take Pavano's spot in the rota­tion. Guillermo Mota is slated to becomn a first-time eloser as part of a revamped bullpen. 

A left-handed power hitter has topped McKeon's wish list ever since he became manager in 2003. Delgado's one of the best. 
"Jack, I guess now you know you've got the lert-handed bat that you want," Loria told McKeon, seated near him at Thursday's hiring press eon" ferenee. 
"About time," McKeon quick­ly responded. 
Delgado has already started to earn his keep. The Marlins sold $150,000 worth of season tickets Wednesday, five times their daily norm. 
"This ballclu b has a very good lineup, a very.good pitch­ing staff and a very, very good chance to make it to the play­offs," Delgado said. 
Delgado is the city's newest Latin celebrity but hardly the Marlins' lone star. He'll be one of seven regulars to have played in an All-Star game. And the rotation, the team's strength the past two seasons, still includes .Josh Beckett, A . .I. 

Burnett and Dontrnlle Willis. 
"The Marlins were good before Delgado, and now they're a better team than thny were last year," said Leite·. who pitched the past seven seasons for l.lw Mets. "With tlw considorabln movement of players in the NL East, it's up for grabs. No disrespnct t.o the Braves, but there's a sense that ovorybody has a shot."

After slow start, Bulls begin to pick up steam 
Associated Press 
UtiC"-<iO _.K"trnp in mi-nd that wach Scott Skilns gets paid a lot to mako sure the glass always looks half-full. Anybody olso who says they saw the Chicago Bulls in the playoJT hunt midway through this season is

The reason has little to do with the spend of the Bulls' turnaround or the lack of prece­dent. The N BA's mantra, after all, is "everybody makes a run," and just last season, the Miami Heat stumbled 0-7 leaving the gate and still managed to dose a respectable 42-40 and make · the playofTs. 

So why not the Bulls? 

Before we tackle that ques­tion, a word from Skiles.

endure this season," Skiles said after practice the other day. "But even then, we never saw ourselves being any 0-9 team. At least it didn't feel that way. So that gave us a mental head start in turning things around. We always had confidence that we are a good team." 
With Thursday night's visit by the Charlotte Bobcats marking the official midpoint of the sea­son, the Bulls suddenly look like a very good team. They came in having won four straight, 11 of 12, and 17 of the last 21. Even in a weak Eastern Conference and a league filled with surpris­es, that has to be the most sur­prising development of all. 
Skiles, of course, had a per­fectly reasonable explanation. 
"We went from virtually last in the league to first in one major defensive statistic," he said, referring to his team's ability to hold opponents to a league-low 41 percent lield-goal shooting percentage. But play­ing great defense is a symptom and not the cause of the Bulls' success. 
Credit for that belongs mostly to Skiles and general manager John Paxson, who as recently as six weeks ago had no reason to believe that their commitment 
and tough lovn were about to be rewarded. 
Franchisos reaeh tipping points all thn time, and at that moment, this futurn of Chicago's looked a lot morn like thn Clippers than one just a half­dozen years removed from tlw salad days of Michael Jordan. What the Bulls had in eommon with the Clippors was a handful of losing seasons, a team loadnd with undorachieving draft pieks and disgruntled veterans who viewed Chicago as a rnst stop on the way to somnwhnrn else. 
Paxson turned out to be shrewder than his predecessor Jerry Krause. lin found better players in tlw draft and patient­ly pruned the roster instead of cutting down the trne and start­ing over one more time. Then he quit meddling and let tlw hard-nosed Skilns do the rest. 
Even so, as recently as Deeembnr, Uw Bulls were flop­ping and offers were coming in for Eddy Curry and Tyson Chandler, tho high sdwol phe­noms whose arrnstnd develop­ment was the legacy of the last administration. Paxson sur­rounded them with a better mix of veterans and four rookies that turnnd out to be mueh bet­tor than advertisnd.

NCAA MEN's BASKETBALL 

Associated Press 
EAST LANSING, Mich. ­When Michigan State met at halftime. the Spartans talked about putting away Michigan in the first 5 minutes of the second half. 
They did. 

Maurice Ager scored 18 points and No. 15 Michigan State started the second half strong before coasting to a vic­tory over the Wolverines on Thursday night. 
"That was huge," Ager said of scoring the first eight points after halftime. "We got a lot of energy out of that. Guys got after it, and got on the floor. You can't help but go on a run." 
The Spartans (13-3, 5-1 Big Ten) have won 11 of their last 12, and 11 of 12 against Michigan (12-8, 3-3). 
Michigan State plays No. 1 Illinois on Tuesday at home after a nonconference tuneup against Oakland on Saturday. 
The Spartans were subdued in the locker room after han­dling their rival easily because they knew. a similar effort against the Fighting Illini would lead to a loss, hurting their Big Ten title hopes. 
"That's just kind of a sign of where we are and that we do have a good idea of the big pic­ture," guard Chris Hill said. 

Dion Harris and Courtney Sims each had 12 points for the Wolverines, who were without standout point guard Daniel Horton. He was sus­pended indefinitely after being charged with domestic vio­lence on Monday and without him. Michigan had 23 turnovers against the Spartans' pressure defense. 
Harris said the Wolverines missed Horton a lot. 
"l think we just broke down offensively and defensively," said Harris, who had six turnovers. "They pressured me every time I got the ball, they

Belles look to move up in the conference 
By JUSTIN STETZ Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's swimming team will be traveling to Albion College Saturday to face the Britons and the Knights of Calvin. The Belles currently reside in sixth place in the MIAA with a record of 1-3, but can overtake Albion for the fifth spot with a vic­tory. Calvin College sits on top of the conference with a record of 3­0 as it has dominated most of its competition to this point. 
Last year, Saint Mary's suffered losses to both teams during con­ference action. Albion defeated the Belles by a score of 128-106, while the Knights breezed by the Belles with a relatively easy 119­84 win. In the meet against Albion, Bridget Lebiedz finished second in the 200-yard freestyle and teammate Kelly Nelis placed second in the 50-yard freestyle with a time of 26.56 seconds NelL'> also won the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 5:30. 
Against conference rival Calvin, Nelis finished second in the 200­yard freestyle event, while Sarah Nowak had a strong performance in the 200-yard individual medley with a time of 2:27. The team also captured first in the 200-yard freestyle relay finishing with a time of 1:46. 
Heading into this weekends meet, Saint Mary's is coming ofl' a devastating loss to Kalamazoo, a team that beat the Belles 144-71 last weekend. Because of the defeat, it is crucial Saint Mary's have a strong performance to gain ground in league play. However, coach Gregg Petcoff believes the team has an excellent chance of moving up in the conference standings. Two wins this weekend could move the Belles to as high as fourth in the MIAA. 

So far this season, Nelis has the top finishes in both the 50-yard and 500-yard freestyles with respective times of 26.43 and 5:30. 
Nowak leads the team in the 100-freestyle with a time of 57.34 and has recorded a time of 2:04 in the 200-yard freestyle. She has also posted finishes of 1:11 and 
2:32 in the 100 and 200-yard breaststrokes. 
Lisa Balog has had an impres­sive freshman campaign by swim­ming a team-best 11:43 in the 1,000-yard freestyle as well as recording a time of 20:05 in the 1,650-yard freestyle. 
This weekend, the Belles will need all of their swimmers to be in top form if they wL'ih to have a chance at beating both competi­tors. 
The first event commences at 1 

p.m. on Saturday. Following the events, Saint Mary's will preparP for the MIAA Swimming and Diving Championships on Feb 10.

Balanced scoring lifts Pistons over Pacers 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Chauncey Billups seored 20 points and Tayshaun Prince had 16 points and seven rebounds as the Detroit Pistons used a balanced scoring attack to defeat the Indiana Paeers 88-76 Thursday night. 
lt was the seeond meeting between the teams since Nov. 19, wheri Pacers players brawled with Pistons fans after Ben Wallaee shoved Ron Artest. Both games have been in Indianapolis. and both times the Pistons have won. 
The teams faee each for the last time in the regular season March 25 at Detroit. That will be Indiana's first trip back to the Palace of Auburn Hills since the light. 
Detroit won its seeond straight after losing four in a row, while Indiana has lost three straight and five of seven. The Pacers dropped under .500 for only the second time this season. 
Thursday's game was full of emotion, too. 
Indiana fans booed loudly as the Pistons were introduced and booed again each time Ben Wallaee scored. The game also was marrPd by five technical fouls, and fans jawed with Pistons players, sometimes play­fully, in the final minutes of the game. 
Ben Wallace finished with 10 points and 11 rebounds. 
The game got off' to a con­tentious start. Two days after five Pacers players appeared in a Detroit courtroom, Heggie Miller, Hasheed Wallace and Pacers coach Hiek Carlisle all drew technical fouls in the first half, and Jermaine O'Neal picked up another technical early in the third quarter. 
The Pacers' scoring burden was carried by O'Neal and Stephen Jackson, who were both involved in the November melee. O'Neal finished with 27 points and nine rebounds while Jackson scored 11 points, five rebounds and three assists in his second game baek after a 30-game suspension for his role in the brawl. 
Fred Jones added 14 points off the bench, and point guard Jamaal Tinsley was particularly ineffective after missing Wednesday night's game in Boston with the flu. Tinsley missed all six of his shots, fin­ishing with two points and four assists after being in foul trou­ble most of the night. 
The Pistons used a runs of 13­2 and 6-0 to build a 39-25 lead. 
The Pacers rallied just before halftime, scoring the last five points to close to 47-40. But Detroit opened the second half by scoring five straight points and pulled away with a 7-0 spurt that made it 66-51 with 
2:18 left in the third quarter. 
Kings 90, Spurs 80 
The Sacramento Kings played San Antonio twice this week ­the first time with Peja Stojakovic, the second without him. The Kings lost both times, but on Thursday they were more competitive minus their No. 2 scorer. 
Manu Ginobili scored 25 points and Tim Duncan added 20 for the Spurs, who fended off a late rally for win. 
Stojakovic, averaging 20.3 points, sat out with back spasms. The Kings lost the pre­vious meeting by 30 points. 
"We are not happy just because it was closer," Sacramento's Chris Webber said. "A loss is a loss." 
The Kings cut San Antonio's lead to 78-77 when Webber stole the ball and passed to Brad Miller for a layup with 5:06 left. 
The Spurs then went on an 8­0 run as Robert Horry made three free throws, Bruce Bowen hit a 3-pointer and Duncan worked inside for a layup over Miller. 
Sacramento missed nine of its last 10 shots after Miller's fayup. 
'The only way we are going to win this game is to play good (defense)," Harry said. "We were very fortunate that we contested shots and they missed those shots." 
Bowen finished with 14 points, 10 of them in the second half. 
Tony Parker finished with 12 points, and Duncan had 12 rebounds. 
"We didn't play our best bas­ketball," Duncan said. "We gave

them too many opportunities to get back in the game." 
Miller scored 19 points, Mike Bibby 17 and Webber 16 for Sacramento, which trailed by double digits several times.. Matt Barnes,-starting in place of Stojakovic, had eight points on 3-for-5 shooting. 
Kings coach Hiek Adelman said his team held its own, but that San Antonio executed bet­ter down the stretch. 
"Obviously they are the best team in the league right now," Adelman said. "They hurt us getting to the basket -Parker in the first half and then Ginobili in the second half." 


Parker had a hand in 1 0 of the Spurs' first 12 basket., scoring four of them and recording assists on six others. San Antonio fed off Parker's ability to penetrate in building a 23-11 lead with 4:49 left in the first quarter. 
Sacramento shot 5-for-8 to finish the first quarter and then made its first five of the second quarter to take its only lead of the game, 35-34. 
On the go-ahead basket, Miller hit Darius Songaila with a long toss for a breakaway dunk while Malik Hose, assigned to defend Songaila, was hiding his faee in his jersey after a turnover.

HOCKEY 
Solid finish would move Irish up in the CCHA 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER 
Associate Sports Editor 
While they may be in last place in the CCIIA at this point in the season, the Irish are cer­tainly not out of postseason eontention. 
Currently, Notre Dame sits in 12th place with 10 points, with the sixth-place team, Bowling Green, only six points ahead. That's just a three-win differ­nnce, and as Irish coach Dave Poulin knows, Notre Dame still has a chance to havn a hot streak heading into thn last 10 games of the year. 
"We can do whatever we want to do," he said. "I talked to our guys and told them that every team I've been associat­ed with here at Notre Dame has had a roll where things happen for you, and you get that confident roll and your energy level picks up. 
"That hasn't happened for us over a stretch of time, yet, and I think it's ahead of us for this final stretch." 
Notre Dame will hope to start a winning streak this weekend as they take on Bowling Green in a home-and-home series, with the Irish meeting the Falcons on the road tonight and returning home to the .Joyce Center to close out the series Saturday night. 
The Irish are currently mired in a six-game losing streak, dating back to a 2-1 victory against Rennselaer on Jan. 2. 
Notre Dame has also failed to score a single goal in its last 156 minutes, 50 seconds ­dropping two 2-0 shutouts to No. 5 Wisconsin last week­end.On the season, the Irish are averaging just 1.50 goals per game, the second worst average in all of Division I (Army is last with a 1.39 goals­per-game average). In the 26 games Notre Dame has played to date, the Irish have scored one goal or fewer in 15 of them. 
"We're trying to focus on the simplicity of not talking about goals," Poulin said. "We're try­ing to talk about completing a pass, completing two passes in the neutral zone, getting our feet moving, being in better position for our teammates. 
"We've sort of gone back to the fundamentals of hockey and not focused so much on the topic of goal scoring." 
If the Irish can manage to get a few goals per game, they should have a good chance of finishing the season on a roll. Notre Dame's goaltending has been phenomenal, even if the final records don't show it. 
Irish senior goalie Morgan 


Cey has been strong all snason, but nspAcially in thA month of January, where hA has a 2.23 goals against average and a .926 save percentage. His record during that month was just 1-6-1 however. 
"Our defense has been really good all season," Poulin said. "Our goaltAnders played well both games [against Wisconsin l and our penalty kill was espe­cially strong. Three of the four goals were rush goals, and Wisconsin has some guys that can finish plays. 
"We did play well defensively in that series and we have to keep that up over the last part of the season." 
Notre Dame has already faced Bowling Green this sea­son, losing to the Falcons 3-1 on Nov. 4 and tying 4-4 on Nov. 
5. That tie was perhaps the best offensive output all season for the Irish. with the team putting 54 shots on net against goalie Jordan Sigalet. 
The four goals are also a sea­son high. 

"This is a team that we've had 50 shots at against this year, and that's the kind of effort it's going to take against one of the top goaltenders in the country," Poulin said. 
Notre Dame faces off against Bowling Gn~en Friday at 7:05 
p.m. in Bowling Green, and Saturday at 7:05 p.m. at the Joyce Center.

MEN'S TRACK 
Runners prepare for Invitational 
By JOHN EVERETT 
Sports Writer 
The Irish will take to the track Saturday in the annual Notre Dame Invitational. The Irish men will be competing against runners from Marquette, DePaul, Loyola, Butler and Michigan State. The meet is another event designed to prepare the Irish for the Meyo Invitational on Feb. 4 and 5, which is seen as the first big meet of the season. Notre Dame has proven itself in other preparatory events, which has head coach Joe Piane excited heading into the Invitational. 
"This will be a pretty good event, the men's 800-meters and hurdle races should be good, and the 3,000-meter race should be excellent," Piane said. 
The 3,000-meters is expected to be a compelling race, consid­ering the depth the Irish pos­sess in distance runners. 
The Irish distance squad, fea­turing runners such as Kurt Benninger, who won the mile at last week's meet, and freshman 800-meter runners Brett Adams and Jake Watson, will be a large factor. 
However, other schools will prove to be a challenge consid­ering the squad from Butler fin­ished fourth at the NCAA Cross Country Championships, and that Michigan State has Steve Sherer, an All-American, run­ning in the race. 
In the hurdle races, the Irish will look to Selim Nurudeen, who has already turned in sev­eral outstanding performances in this young indoor season. 
Piane stated he was very pleased with the way the season was turning out. 
"Things are coming along well, when you realize that most of our guys have only run at one meet," he said. "Right now our goal is to get guys qualified for the Big East [Indoor Championships]."

No. 21 Irish l~ok to bounce back on road trip

True, last weekend's loss to No. 14 Northwestern may have left Notrn Damn a little rattled. 
But morn than anything, it inc.rnasnd tlwir rnsolvn to prove just how much potential they possess. 
"We wnrP a little bit out of' racing pradir.e," Irish eoach Tim Welsh said. "It took us sonw time to gnt back in the c.ompPlitiv11 spirit. But now we know what we need to do to win this wPekend. and we're rnady to win."

"Wiwn you race, you just havP to know that you can't giv1~ up 01111 inch to tlw competition. no rnatltr how long tlw race is or who you're going up against," Handolph said. 
Notrf' Damn will takn that hardnosnd attitude on the road this W11ehnd, l'adng Cleveland Statn (7-21 and Canisius (0-Sl today at 4:30 p.m. and St. Bonaventure (6-3) Saturday at 12 p.m. 
Last weekend, host Notre Dame fell to Northwestern (4-41 in a 1(J 3 . 5-1 34. 5 decision. i\lthough the Wildcats broke four pool records, they were unable to socure the win until tho last ovnnt. 
Notre Dame defeated the Wildeats 2S-S in tlw two diving nvnnts. Sophomore Seott Coyle bested 
Northwestern junior Mike Oxman oiT of both boards, giv­ing tho Irish valuable points tlwy nnmled in the liereoly eon­tns tl'd meet. 
The Irish also took at least two or tlw throe top places in 10 of' the 14 individual events. Sophomorn Tim Kegelman, who ranks fifth in Division I this sea­son in tho I00-yard f'ly. gar­twrl'd the only two swimming vietorins for the Irish with a limn of I minutn, 52.2S seconds in the 200-yard lly and 49.2S in tho I00-yard fly. 
Clnvnland State will also bring a talent-ladnn loam to thn pool today. Tlw Vikings are on a six­mnnt winning streak and led by snnior divnr Thatchnr Carr, snn­ior buttnrf'lyer Thatcher Carr and junior backstroker l'ietnr Peiser. 

Carr, who qualified for the NCAA Championships in 2001 and 2002 while at Navy, has already gained recognition this year for breaking the 1-meter dual record in his first meet with the Vikings with a score of 
349.40 points. 
Han ked No. 50 in the 100­yard butterlly and No. 89 in the 200-yard butterlly, the senior looks to be one of Kegelman's greatest challenges. Tnammatn Peiser has broken school rncords in both the 100-and 200-yard backstroke this sea­son and is tied for 38th in the nation in the 100 and 44th in the 200. Notre Damn's other competition today will come from tho Goldnn Griffins of Canisius, who arc looking for thnir first win in morn than two seasons after nearly beating lona in Dncnmbnr 12S-70. 
St. Bonaventurn will provn to bn Notre Damn's biggest threat this weekend. Thn Bonnies are ranked lirst in thoir confnrnnec and 50th in the nation, boasting national rankings in the 400 free (44th), SOO free (45th) and 400 medley (48th).

tougher than when Notre Dame faced them on Jan. 12. · 
Back from injury is leading scorer and second team All-Big East performer Barbara Turner, who averages 12.4 points per game. Not far behind Turner in the scoring column is li~llow junior Ann Strother. The 6-foot-2 guard averages 12.1 poinl<; per game on 
39.1 percent shooting from beyond the are. 
Conneeticut has found another source of offense in freshman Charde Ilouston. In just 19 min­utes per game, the freshman is averaging 11.8 points and 4.9 rebounds, and shoots 56.5 per­cent from the field. llouston was the Big East's Freshman of the Week the past two weeks after a 25-point performance against Texas. Houston gave Notre Dame problems during the last matchup, as she scornd 19 points on 8-for-15 shooting, which com­plemented her five rebounds, three steals and thrf~e blocks. 
The Huskies are the No. 1 team in the Big East conference, mak­ing this game especially important for the Irish, who sit in fourth place, behind Connecticut, Boston College and Rutgers, after Wednesday's win over St. John's. 
"Nobody's really given them a game in the Big East," McGraw said. "They've been dominant in the Big East. They're the team to beat again, the No. 1 team, and they'r~. playing with a lot of confi­dence. 


Notre Dame escaped Wednesday against St. John's after coming back from a 35-31 halftime deficit to win 72-65. All­American Jacqueline Batteast said Notre Dame needs to play better defense if it wants to deal the Huskies their first conference loss. 
"I think it starl<; with defense," Batteast said. "It's been that way the whole season -the better defense we've played, the better offense we've had. So we can't go out there and try to outscore UConn, because that's not going to happen, so we really need to work on our defense right now -the offense, it will come." 
Sunday's game is at the Hartford Civic Center. whieh is not only Connecticut's home court, but also the site of the Big East Tournament. McGraw knows the Huskies always draw a tough crowd. 
"Certainly playing in their build­ing, they'll be playing with even more [confidence]," McGraw said. "They know that they can beat us badly at our place, and so they fig­ure, I'm sure, that the same thing is going to happen up there." 
Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. Sunday on ESPN2.

ways to go iri doubles, but we're better than we were a year ago, and we're making some progress." 
The doubles point is of par­ticular concern for Bayliss. 
"We certainly are concerned about all our doubles," he said. "Getting to the level of teams we're going to be playing now, that's not going to be good enough." 
North Carolina will provide Notre Dame with its biggest test in the season so far. 
"North Carolina is a very well-balanced team with a lot of aggressive baseliners who really, really make you play," Bayliss said. "They play great doubles -I think the match Saturday is going to be very hotly contested and a great match." 
The team has worked to pre­pare for the talent that the Tar Heels will bring to the match. 
"I had a chance to watch them practice a little bit," Bayliss said. "They really do hit their ground strokes with authority." 
Sunday's match will not prove any easier, as Bayliss calls the Seminoles a potential top-20 team "loaded with tal­ent." 
The team did not change their practiee strategy, although Bayliss and his play­ers are foeused on the impor­tant weekend ahead. 
"We tried to keep the prac­tices a little more compact and specific knowing that we've got two very, very tough teams back to back," Bayliss said. 
The team is also sponsoring a dorm challenge event, where dorms with the most students coming to matches will receive a prize. This weekend, Seigfried, Pasquerilla West. and Lewis will be the dorms competing at Saturday's match, with Knott, Pasquerilla East and Welsh Family vying for the prize on Sunday. 
Hegardless of the contest, however, fans this weekend can expect to see a high cal­iber of play at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
"We're healthy, everyone's looked good in practice, there's no reason to think we won't play well," Bayliss said. ''I'm excited because I know we've come a long way, and we either need to learn that we've really achieved a lot or fmd out what we need to do to get bet­ter -and we're going to find out."

Although the Irish will be head­ing into the match with a higher ranking over Wake Forest, Notre Dame is not taking the contest too lightly. 
"They may be ranked 30th, but Competing for Ohio State will be foilist Boaz Ellis and sabre Adam Crompton, who also won in 2003.

Donohue agreed to not under­estimate the talented Wake Forest. 
"Ranking doesn't mean any­thing because anybody can upset anybody," she said. 
However, after achieving wins over Ohio State and Michigan, Sarah Jane Connelly has full con­fidence in the team's capabilities. 
This confidence stems from three players who were able to comeback from early deficits in their matches and secure the win dur­

to know that we can't take anything lightly. We can't look at rankings because everyone is tough and everyone is out to get us." 
But, if the match comes down to the last point, Donohue is con­fident in Notre Dame's ability to achieve the victory because of how encouraging the team is towards each other. 
"We are so supportive of each other, especially when you're the last match out there. So it is great to know that your team is there for you," she said. 
Fencing Association (IFAl recently made changes to the way points are scored, short­ening the interval of time that double points can be scored to 35 hundredths of a second. Also, the IFA lengthened the period of time that a foil must be pressed into an opponent's body to count as a point. As scoring is electronic, the new equipment, which was just installed over winter break, are calibrated to be sensitive to these new specifications. 
Because of these new rule changes, the Irish have been working extensively on tech­niques that will help them adjust to the new regulations. 
"The kids have had problems adjusting to the new situa­tion," Bednarski said. "But we've done lots of technical work, [and] it's a good idea because it's not easy to change machines."

Since that game, the Huskies have been red-hot. winning four straight, including a 73-57 defeat of No. 15 Texas and three straight Big East wins, leaving them unde­feated in the conference. 
Sunday, No. 6 Notre Dame (17­3, 5-2 Big East) looks to end this winning streak as the Irish travel to Hartford to face Connecticut for the second time in less than a month. 
"They're on a roll right now," Irish eoach Mullet McGraw said. "I think we put them on a roll. The win over us really got their eontidence back." 
The lost eonfidence came after the Huskies (13-4, 6-0 Big East) dropped four of their first 12 games, losing at No. 12 North Carolina and Arizona State and losing at home to No. 11 Michigan State and No. 5 Tennessee.

Bayliss is ready fora challenge 
By KATE GALES Sports Writer 
Thrashing their way to a 4-0 start, the Irish arc ready for some tougher competition ­and this weekend's matches against No. 18 North Carolina and No. 41 Florida State will provide just that. 
Top teams? Of course. But coach Bobby Bayliss is ready for a challenge. 
"I feel pretty good about our team," he said. "I think we've grown and its time to take on a big challenge and it's here -so let's get it on." 
After compiling a 4-0 record, including last weekend's wins over Indiana and Wisconsin, the team is seasoned and making the in-season adjustments nec­essary to success. 
"We had two matches over the weekend, so the first thing we did was to make sure we had a day off and kind of regrouped," Bayliss said. "I was pretty pleased with the singles last weekend, and we've still got a

Ohio State and Penn State come to Duals 
13-team field set to face offat the JACC 
By ERIC RETTER Sports Writer 
First looks, second chances and three national title con­tenders are descending on South Bend. 
The Irish have a very busy and important weekend ahead of them, as they compete against Northwestern, Penn State and top-ranked Ohio State. The Buckeyes topped both the women's and men's teams last weekend at the NYU duals. 
In addition to these teams, a host of other combatants in a 13-team field will be filling the JACC this weekend to face the Irish and each other in the Notre Dame Duals which beings Saturday at 8 a.m. 
Both Irish squads will be try­ing to answer for their defeats from last weekend, including a 14-13 thriller between the women's squads. 
"We would like to get revenge and try to beat them on the women's side and improve our performance on the men's side," Irish coach Janusz Bednarski said. 
The Duals will feature more than a season's worth of NCAA individual champions who will look to defend their claim to their 13 collective titles. Three of these champions, senior foilist Alicj a Krczalo, senior epeeist Kerry Walton and sophomore sabre Valerie Providenza, will be competing for the Irish, giving the squad more individual titlists than a:ny of their competitors.

Irish set to face No. 30 Wake Forest 

By DAN TAPETILLO 
Sports Writer 

This Sunday, the No. 21 Irish (2-1) are looking to avenge last season's 7-0 loss to currently ranked No. 30 Wake Forest (2­
0). 
To achieve this feat, Notre Dame is looking to start the meet strong. 
"After last season's loss, we know they are going to be tough," junior Liz Donohue said. "So we are going to have to make the most of our home­court advantage and play like we have nothing to lose." 
The Irish are hoping to set the tone early in the contest by win­ning the crucial doubles point.

schedule looked daunting when released in September, now it looks out­right frightening: No. 19 Connecticut. No.4 Syracuse, No. 8 Boston College and No. 20 Pittsburgh -alter­nating home and away-in 14 days. 
The Irish have four games, against teams with a com­bined 62-9 record. to deter­mine what typ~ of team they are. 
"Going up against some of the top teams in the nation, it shows you where you're at as a basketball team," Chris Quinn said. "We have to take it one game at a time, stay focused and go from there." 
If the Irish can tread water-by going 2-2 ­they'll be 14-7 and 6-5 in the Big East with two very, very good wins over teams that aren't only going to qualify for the NCAA tour­nament, but are legitimate contenders to be playing on the second weekend. 
Anything better is cause for celebration. Anything worse, we'll get to that later. 
Now for the reason this murderer's row of oppo­nents even exists. 
It is and it isn't Notre Dame's fault they have this upcoming stretch. 
Mike Brey's success in South Bend has resurrected the program from the dark days of the 1990s. Now, national television can count on seeing the Notre Dame name with a competi­tive team against anyone in the country and that obvi­ously brings ratings. 
However, no one expected Boston College to be this good. And it really isn't fair when you see the Irish play­ing Syracuse, Connecticut and Pittsburgh twice every sea­high after a great win, and we can't get too low after a disappointing loss," Brey said. "I think that's how this group is, they've been pretty good, and that's how we're going to have to be." 
But of all the things the Irish must do during the next two weeks, the most important one might be sur­viving. 
Not just surviving on the scoreboard, but off the court as well.

easy two-time opponents are Hutgers and St. John's while Villanova gets Seton llall and Providence. Notre Dame's two easy teams are, yup, you guessed it -Villanova and Georgetown. 
It's especially unfair come March, when you have to compare their conference record not only in the Big East but also across confer­ences for postseason berths. 
Look at last season for evidence: Notre Dame was 9-7 in the Big East and received a NIT bid. UTEP was 13-5 in the Western Athletic Conference and earned a No. 13 seed in the NCAA tournament. 
Fair or not, Brey has come to accept it. His team knows how to deal with it. 
"When you get into this stretch, you can't get too logical to 
think those doubts will linger in the Irish locker room. 
All the Irish have to do is think back to last season when it took them until game No. 20 to get that first big win. Three wins eight days later put the Irish squarely on top of the proverbial bubble. 
Everyone knows what happened on Selection Sunday. 
Four games, four top 20 opponents, 14 days. 
Scary-yes. 
Impossible -no. 
Survival -vital.

In the St. John's win, Cornette played 34 of' a total 40 minutes. One week later against Georgetown, he played just 22. But Cornette -whose l<~ft bicep ~attoo,,proc.lai!ns th.e mckname Jay-C -ms1sts h1s unselfishness and attitude are not unique. 
"I think I'm no diiTernnt f'rom any of the other guys on this team in terms of whether it's playing live minutes or playing 40 minutes," Cornette said. "If the te<~~n's winning, then you're happy. 
With Connecticut, Syracuse, Boston College and Pittsburgh waiting on the upcoming con­f'erenee schedule, being happy demands the obvious things ­few turnovers, strong def'onse, good shooting. But most impor­tantly, the Irish need a leader who has been through these stretehes before. 
Nothing new 
Since Jordan Cornette has averaged 3.9 points and 4.5 rebounds during his four-year career, his name often gets skipped over in discussions of players to watch. Mention lead­ership, however, and "Jay-C" seems synonymous with the term. 
"I definitely feel comfortable in that lleadershipl role," Cornette said. "From sopho­more year through I've had that type of role. So it's nothing new." 
Cornette has played on difTer­ent teams with different fates, but his attitude has remained consistent. 
In his f'reshman season, the Irish lost a near upset of' No. 1 Duke when Cornette's class­mate Chris Thomas was already seeing significant play­ing time at point guard. But a 22-11 season was sonwthing to build on, and with Cornette's minutes going up to almost 20 por game the f'ollowing 2002­03 season, the Irish went 24­10. 
Notre Dame reached the Sweet 16 ol' the NCAA tourna­ment that soason, but in 2003­04 the Irish fai!Bd to make the NCAA's, earning a bid to the National Invitation Tournament and losing in the third round to Oregon. 
Cornette, who has been a constant through the ups and downs of' a rising Notre Dame program under Broy, appreci­ated the !'an response to his team's showing last season. 
"Last year we ended up play­ing in the NIT, and a lot of' peo­ple looked at the season as a throwaway," Cornette said. "Just having those types of standards shows how far this program's eo me."

Free throw line becoming just that for the Irish 
Big East leaders have seen the importance in conference play 
By MATT LOZAR 
Sports Wrirer 
They're called free throws for a reason. The Irish are taking full advan­tage of that generosity. 
Sitting at the top of the Big East, and in the best 10 percent of the country with a 7 4. 7 free throw percentage, the Irish have kept themselves in games with their success from the stripe. 
That mark improves to 82.1 percent when only Big East games are factored into the equa­tion. 
Likewise, it's been an even big­ger factor in their conference play. 
Go back to the home win over Villanova. The Irish made all 19 of their free throws en route to a 78-72 victory over the Wildcats. 
Then move forward to the St. John's game where in trying to pull the upset at the Joyce Center, the Red Storm only made 10-of­22 free throws. That inability to cash in from the line allowed the Irish to stay close and gave Chris Thomas the opportunity to make the game-winning 3-pointer. 
Yes, the Irish have a plethora of long-range shooters, so it's natu­ral to think they should be suc­cessful from the line. 
Breaking it down, it's even sim­pler. They practice it. 
"We shoot free throws at the end of every practice -make 10­of-13, make 4 in a row as a team," Thomas said. "We do it as a team because you can put your best free throw shooters up there at the end of practice, and get out of practice quickly, it's not going to benefit the team if just your best free throw shooters are up there in game situations in prac­tice." 
Thomas, Chris Quinn and Colin Falls are leading the team. Thomas shoots
