Although he is upset by his portrayal in the new film "Rudy... former Notre Dame football coach Dan Devine will not take legal action against Tri-Star Pictures, citing both his wife's health and his commitments to the University of Missouri as more important priorities in his life. 
"Basically. there's not going to be any lawsuit," Devine said. "But I want to say that I was one of the most loyal and de­voted Notre Dame people in the country. and I am very. very. dissappointed in the way the University handled this situation." 
One particular scene in "Rudy" has upset Devine to the point where he and his South Bend attorney. Lyn Leone. had threatened to file a suit against Tri-Star Pictures based on defamation of character. 
"He (Devine) has been in tor­ment about this scene for quite a long time-he certainly wouldn't have retained my ser­vices over a year ago if he wasn't," Leone said.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Notre Dame ain't no .Drive­thru U 
It is 3:00 a.m. on a Friday and we are return­ing from an evening in Chicago. We're tired, it's late, and we have class in five hours. The people in my car live in Lyons, Howard, Walsh, and Flanner. We approach 

the security gate with the John Potter intentions of dropping the Advertising Executive women off and returning to 02. 
How could we have been so na'ive! Those roads aren't for students to drive on! 
It's a closed campus, I'm assured. They are trying to cut down on traffic. Exactly how much traffic is there on campus at 3:00 a.m. on Friday? I can tell you. since we walked the whole thing-none! 
Now the intentions of this are not so bad, because having a campus accessible a pied is wonderful. especially compared to larger schools with more pavement than grass. But obviously we're not going to park on campus because there is nowhere to park. 
Fine, I thought, I'll adhere to the pointed fin­ger and go out through Stepan to 02. A cordial "sorry" from the officer would have softened the blow, but he was busy talking to the patrol­man sitting in the booth with him. I'm glad they secured the gatehouse. 
What bothers me the most is that when we reached 02, there were two rather suspicious men wandering around. Isn't that a better place for the officers to patrol? 
The next day, I figure I'll try again. Same destination, except it's 4:00 p.m. A different guard. yet I get the same stoic finger pointing at Stepan. 
"Why?" I ask. 
"Are you a student here?" the guard demands. "Yes." "Give me your ID." "No, I'm asking you a question. Why can 
those ten cars who just passed through here drive on campus and I cannot," I inquired. 
"Because it's a closed campus." 
This is a University community with around 10,000 students. So why is it that students are the last ones to be allowed to drive on campus? And if they do let us on because there is a woman in labor in the back seat, they still ask if we have any alcohol in the car! 
Actually, I found the trick to getting on cam­pus in a car. The approach must be timed. 
The other night we figured we would try our luck again. The guard happened to be napping when we pulled up. Upon arousing his atten­tion he let us right through. l guess he was too embarrassed to attempt to dissuade us. 
Let's get down to the issue here. It is time to focus the security efforts of the University on where it is needed-to protect the University and its community. So why do we protect the University from its community? 
Allow the students, before anyone else, to drive on campus. We all know you can't park anywhere on campus, and it's a much less sub­jective rule to allow only students through the gate. Granted, the argument against this is that student parking lots are closer and larger. but realistically we just need to pick up or drop off. 
Notre Dame Security can still allow non-stu­dents to drive on campus. but knows full well that all they do is clutter the campus trying to park.

WORLD AT AGLANCE 
Somali warlord has elusive past 
NAIROBI 
Mohamed Aidid, the Somali warlord accused of order­ing the attacks on U.N. peacekeepers. has never given up easily. 
He once stayed alive in prison. it is said. by eating soap. Aidid then waited nearly two decades for the chance to take up arms and oust the U.S.-backed dictator who imprisoned him. 
To his supporters Aidid is a brave, patriotic and charis­matic leader, and even his foes see the balding, 57-year­old former general as destined to be the next president of the East African country. 
Aidid was trained at military schools in Moscow and Rome, but he is the son of a nomad and, in a country with a rich tradition of rhyming storytelling, fancies him­self a poet. He is a Muslim with two wives and 14 chil­dren, most of whom live in the United States. 
This has not deterred him from attacking American sol­diers and by any measure, Aidid has shown himself to be a man not to be trifled with. Indeed, in Somali, "a}did" means "he who would not be insulted." 
Aidid has largely bottled up half of the United Nations' 
28.000 peacekeepers behind fortified positions in the capital. Mogadishu, and forced a painful reassessment of the U.S. role in Somalia. 
And he has eluded capture for nearly four months despite a high -tech effort by the United States to bring him to heel with an elite group of army Rangers and Delta Force commandos. 
Although in hiding, he demonstrated his power again 
Man freed from prison in health fraud case 
CARVILLE 
A man who switched identities with an uninsured friend so the friend could get medical treatment was released from prison Wednesday after serving nine months for fraud. Benny Milligan, 31, was greeted at the prison gate by his wife and three young daughters. "When can you come home?" one of the little girls asked. "Right now!" Milligan replied. Milligan is unemployed and uncertain where his next job will be. But he said he likely will speak out for a Washington-based consumer group backing President Clinton's national health care plan. His release ends what his wife called a nightmare. "Thank God. it's over," said Tammy Milligan, 28. "Just being back togeth­er as a family will do a lot for all of us." The insurance switch -fraud in the eyes of the law -occurred when James McElveen of Metairie was severely injured in a fall from a cliff while the men and their families were vaca­tioning in Tennessee. On the way to the hospital. Milligan switched identification with the unconscious McElveen, who didn't have health insurance. 
Poets among nominees for Nobel Prize 
STOCKHOLM 
The Swedish Academy has lots of poets in its pantry, but novelists also are in the running for the 1993 Nobel Prize in literature being announced Thursday. Irish poet Seamus Heaney. Belgian poet-playwright Hugo Claus, Chinese exile Bei Oao and a Syrian-born Lebanese poet who writes under the name Adonis are among nominees the 207-year-old academy has pondered for years as pos­sibly worthy of the world's richest literary honor. When the golden clock at the academy's 18th century headquarters strikes 1 p.m .. the winner of the $825.000 prize is unlikely to be the writer of the latest popular novel. "In the Nobel committee, we would work on a long-term basis." former academy member Lars Gyllensten told the Swedish news agency TT this week. "We have set up a 'pantry.' The ones who have so far gotten the prize have been from the pantry. and some are still in there, but I'm not allowed to say who."

No charges in display of toy to page 
ATLANTA 
The inability of a teen-age legislative page to identify the lawmaker who showed him a fake penis makes it impossible to bring charges, the state attorney general said Wednesday. State Rep. Jimmy Benefield acknowl­edged taking the toy to the House floor on March 23. but said he never knowingly showed it to Jason Bunkley, who was then 13. The toy popped up when an apron covering it was raised. Attorney General Michael Bowers said a Georgia Bureau of Investigation report showed that "in all likelihood" Benefield displayed the toy to the child. but the boy wasn't sure. Bowers said he has no explanation for the boy's inability to identify the individual. "What to do with Rep. Jimmy Benefield now is clearly up to the House," Bowers said. Jason's mother reported the inci­dent to House leaders. but there was no action until she took it to state prosecutors. The House Ethics Committee voted in August to conduct its own investigation but post­poned further action pending Bowers' decision whether to prosecute. 
Teen-ager convicted in "Hail Mary" slaying

A former altar boy was convicted Wednesday of stran­gling a teen-ager who died after being forced to recite the "Hail Mary." A jury convicted James Wanger. 19. of Clifton of murder in the Feb. 16. 1992. killing of 17 -year­old Robert Solimine Jr. Wanger's grandparents left the courthouse in tears. declining to speak to reporters, but Solimine's father expressed satisfaction. "I knew he was guilty from day one," Robert Solimine Sr. said. "The way he acted showed he was a cold-blooded killer." Wanger could be sentenced to life in prison with no parole for 30 years. During the trial. Wanger denied he was present when Solimine was strangled in a car. but three other teen-agers who previously pleaded guilty said they watched him kill Solimine. The three, along with Wanger and 18-year-old Frank Castaldo, said they considered Solimine a pest.

By AMY SANTANGELO News Writer 
Robert Kennedy Jr.. noted environmentalist. will speak at Notre Dame's Stepan Center tonight. He will be presenting a lecture called "Our Environmental Destiny." 
Student Union Board (SUB) representative Bridget Conley is one of the people who made Kennedy's visit possible. 
She said that SUB and Student Activities wanted to bring someone to campus to speak on an issue important to the Notre Dame community. 
They wanted to get away from the area of politics and government. according to Conley.

College of Engineering wants to teach ethics 
ByNICKRIOS 
News Writer 
The teaching of ethics by engineering professors can help produce more ethically con­scious engineers in the work force. according to Jerry Marley. associate dean of the College of Engineering, 
"We should start concerning ourselves with figuring out a way of being careful of what we put into the pipeline; that way we won't have to be concerned with what goes out," said Marley. the first guest speaker in a three part series called Campus Conversations. 
Each person shares respon­sibility for three different levels of ethics. according to Marley. 
"I think the first level of ethics is that of an individual per se. independent of whether they are professionals or not," Marley said. "A person should have some set of ethics that they must uphold at all times." 
The other two levels are the ethical obligation to the em­ployers or those who benefit from the final product and so­cial ethics. Marley said. 
"Socially the engineer must concern himself with the well being of the people and of soci­ety," he said. "For example. say there is a very cheap way of producing a product. but by do­ing it. it results in harm to so­ciety. It is the responsibility of the engineer to be sufficiently ethical not to choose that alter­native of production." 
Among some of the students that attended the conference were Matt Loesch. junior civil engineer. and Chris Falkner. junior mechanical engineer. 
Both asked questions regard­ing ethics in technological engi­neering, environmental issues and practical everyday prob­lems confronted on the job by engineering. 
Falkner expressed concern about how the engineers could help make decisions that could help further destruct the envi­ronment. Loesch. on the other hand. asked whether all engi-

Catholicism," where Catholics often pick and choose those Church teachings that they wish to believe. 
This is not a major problem because throughout history this "picking and choosing" has taken place, according to Cunningham. Most Catholics try to live within the Church and follow its teachings to the best of their abilities. 
His worry, however, is that people no longer have a "com­mon store of knowledge" about the Church and that they may not pass down the values that they were taught to the next generation. he said. 
The likelihood of major changes taking place in the Church. including the possibil­ity of married clergy is unclear. according to Cunningham. 
"Changes will not come from the top, but from the bottom," he said. 
Some changes may have al­ready taken place in the types of religious communities, he said. For example, many lay men and women are already conducting liturgies in areas where there are no priests. 
However. Cunningham said. that most people simply have not realized that these changes are taking place right now.

Former fugitive to face prison 
By JONATHAN YENKIN _Associated Press 
BOSTON 
Former anti-war radical Katherine Power. who came out of hiding to confront her past. was sentenced to eight to 12 years in prison Wednesday for a 1970 bank robbery that left a police officer dead. 
"To say that I am sorry for his death seems so utterly. ut­terly inadequate." Power wrote in a letter to Suffolk Superior Court Judge Robert Banks. 
Standing in a packed court­room. she said she "will con­tinue to live my life from this day forward as a responsible citizen abiding by the law." 
Banks. who heard emotional testimony from two children of the slain officer. Walter Schroeder Sr .. went beyond prosecutors· recommendations by also ordering 20 years' pro­bation. 
Violating the probation would make Power liable to a life term in prison. 
"I can think of no greater crime than the one committed by you and your accomplices,'' the judge said. 
Power. 44, surrendered last month after remaining a fugi­tive for 23 years. She pleaded guilty to manslaughter and bank robbery. 
As a student at Brandeis University during the Vietnam War era. she and several other people went on a crime spree in September 1970. robbing banks in Philadelphia and Boston and stealing ammuni­tion from an armory outside Boston. Their goal was pur­portedly to help support a revo­lutionary army. 
Fugitive of 1980s IMC scandal arrested in Spain 
By RICHARD COLE 
Associated Press 
MIAMI 
A fugitive at the center of a billion-dollar scandal with links to Republican presidents and Democratic politicians was ar­rested in Spain on Wednesday. six years after fleeing the United States. 
Miguel Recarey Jr. who ran International Medical Centers. fled while under indictment on fraud and wiretapping charges. 
IMC. Florida's largest health maintenance organization. col­lected nearly $1 billion from taxpayers before collapsing in 1987. Regulators said $200 million to $300 million was never accounted for. 
Recarey was arrested in Madrid. the FBI said. The Justice Department will work for his extradition to Miami. said Andrew Duffm. head of the FBI office here. 
At one point in 1988, Recarey was living near Caracas. 
~ 1!), e. I!' l 
Venezuela. and FBI agents complained publicly that the 
U.S. government was dragging its feet on extradition. 
Starting in 1981. Recarey re­lied heavily on well-connected lobbyists and friends to build a small Miami clinic into the na­tion's largest Me~i.care-certified HMO. He paid millions for lob­bying, consulting and legal help. 
All the recipients have denied wrongdoing, saying the pay­ments and their activities were perfectly legal. 
Among those receiving pay­ments were President Reagan's former aides Lyn Nofziger and John Sears. the lobbying firm of President Bush's campaign chairman. the late Lee Atwater, and Bush's son Jeb. 
Democrats also received money from Recarey. including the campaign of the late Rep. Claude Pepper. who even ap­peared in ads for IMC.

Valery Zorkin, Chairman of Russia's court, resigns 
By ALAN COOPERMAN 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW 
The contentious chairman of Russia's Constitutional Court resigned Wednesday. ridding Boris Yeltsin of yet another thorn in his side. 
Valery Zorkin had been un­der growing pressure to quit since Monday. when Yeltsin crushed parliamentary oppo­nents and ended his 18-month power struggle with those who resisted his reforms. 
The court is Russia's highest tribunal for constitutional is­sues. Zorkin. a 50-year-old for­mer law professor. had led the panel of 13 judges since its cre­ation in late 1991. 
Yeltsin could not legally fire the chief judge. but the presi­dent's chief of staff reportedly urged Zorkin to quit on Monday. It was unclear whether he would remain a judge. and the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Wednesday he was suffering from an undis­closed illness. 
Rabin,Yarafat name 
 
peace committees 
By ALLYN FISHER 
Associated Press 
CAIRO 
Yitzhak Rabin and Vasser Arafat got down to the business of turning words of peace into reality Wednesday. but there were signs that generations of enmity would not be easy to erase. 
The Israeli prime minister and Palestine Liberation Organization leader had no handshake for the cameras at their first official meeting. which ended with separate news conferences. 
Still. the longtime adversaries said their 90-minute meeting at Egypt's Unity Palace was con­structive. And they announced the formation of four commit­tees to work out the details of last month's accord on limited Palestinian self-rule in Israeli­occupied territories. 
The task of making peace. al­ready hard. will be made more difficult by continuing violence in the occupied lands. And as at the Sept. 13 signing on the White House lawn in Washington. the prime minis­ter's frostiness toward the PLO chief was noticeable. 
Rabin and Arafat sat in chairs about six feet apart when photographers entered. After some urging. the two men moved to a couch and sat on opposite sides of the Egyptian president. Hosni Mubarak. 
But Rabin refused photogra­phers' requests to shake Arafat's hand in front of the cameras. although his aides said the two later shook hands in private. 
Rabin's coolness recalled his reluctance to take Arafat 's hand as the PLO chief thrust it out when they met briefly for the signing of the peace pact. 
But it was the prime minister who asked for the meeting, out of concern. Israeli officials said. that only a high -level encounter could put the accord into mo­tion.

Britain to abolish right to silence 
By MAUREEN JOHNSON Associated Press 
BLACKPOOL 
The British government pro­posed Wednesday to abolish a criminal suspect's right to si­lence. a basic principle of the country's justice system. 
The move. announced at the annual conference of the gov­erning Conservative Party. is one of a series of initiatives aimed at curbing a rising crime rate. It was denounced by trial lawyers and civil liber­tarians. 
"The so-called right to silence is ruthlessly exploited by terrorists," Home Secretary Michael Howard said. "What fools they must think we are. It's time to call a halt to this charade." 
Under the new system. sus­pects could not be forced to answer the questions of police. But prosecutors and judges would be permitted to tell juries they could draw a "proper inference" from a sus­pect's silence. 
The government abolished the right to silence in Northern Ireland in 1988 -a change largely aimed at terrorism cases. 
The change announced Wednesday would apply only in England and Wales. Officials in Scotland. which has a separate legal system. said they had not decided whether to make the change. 
The government-appointed Royal Commission on Criminal Justice recommended in July that the right to silence be pre­served. It said the possibility of convicting more guilty sus­pects was outweighed by the risk that increased pressure to talk would result in more inno­cent people being convicted. 
Roger Pannone. president of the Law Society. an attorneys group. is opposed to the pro­posal. which he said would shift the burden of proof to the defendant.

SERV honors vocations 

By HOLLY BUCHAN 
Accent Writer 
In 1987. after fourty-four years of ser­vice at Notre Dame. Herbert Juliano retired and began looking for other ways to do the Lord's work. He attended services at the Grotto regularly and met many students who were questioning entering the priesthood. It was because of his discussions with these students that Juliano decided to form a group he entitled Students Encouraging Religious Vocation (SERV). 
The goal of SERVis to make the mem­bers more aware of their Christian voca­tion. to pray for religious vocations. and to offer support and encouragement to others through sharing prayers. 
Now entering its fourth year. SERV has steadily increased in membership and now stands at a high of 55 student members and 25 associate members. which includes priests. nuns. graduate students and faculty interested in show­ing their support for the organization. 
Juliano's aim is not to report record highs of membership. but to express pride in the quality of the members. 
"It is the quality of the members. no matter how few or how many. that is most important," said Juliano. "Students that care and know or feel that fellow members want to follow a religious vocation and are willing to support and encourage them are the kind of members the program hopes to attract." 
This past summer Juliano decided to expand SERV onto a national level. He sent information to high schools. col­leges and churches around the country hoping to spark an interest in the pro­·gram. and he found the response to be significant. 
"Everyday people are calling or writ­ing me asking for more information. They think it's a good idea and a good concept." said Juliano. 
The National Legion of SERV hopes to establish programs on campuses throughout the U.S. and aid students in the discernment of religious vocations within the context of the Catholic Church. with Notre Dame serving as the focal point of the legion. 
SERV strives to form groups of like­minded peers who can join together and express themselves spiritually. regard­less of whether they choose to enter a vocation or not. 
"Students on campus need to know that there are people who want to assist them in any way they can in discerning a religious vocation," said Tony Popanz. president of SERV. "Males and females contribute equally to the mission." 
Popanz said he considers SERV a vital function in the church today because of the problems it is experiencing with attracting people to the vocations. 
Juliano recently completed his first book titled Notre Dame Odyssey: A Journey Through Sports and Spirituality on the Notre Dame Campus. The pro­ceeds of the book. which is available in the bookstore. are entirely donated by Juliano to SERV for funding the pro­gram's activities. 
The National Legion of SERV's events include a weekly mass for the vocations at Notre Dame. a weekly Rosary at the Grotto and a monthly Way of the Cross along St. Joseph's lake for vocations. 
Other activities sponsored by SERV are "Vocation Vigil," a program which urges students to pray at least one hour per month for vocations. and "Operation Andrew," a program which guides and helps students to select and support a member of their community who is pur­suing a religious vocation. 
Hesburgh highlighted 
ByTONYPOPANZ 
Accent Writer 
This evening, at 8 p.m.. Students Encouraging Religious Vocations (SERV) will sponsor a talk by Fr. Theodore Hesburgh. C.S.C. In the Center for Social Concerns Auditorium. In recognition of his great dedication to the priesthood. marked by his 50-year golden jubilee as a Holy Cross priest. Hesburgh will speak on the meaning of religious vocation. and reflect how God's call has touched his life. 
Hesburgh was educated at Notre Dame and the Gregorian University in Rome, where he received a bachelor of philosophy degree in 1939. After re· turning to Notre Dame. he was ordained a priest of the Congregation of the Holy Cross in Sacred Heart Church on June 24. 1943, by Bishop John F. Noll of Fort Wayne. Following his ordination, Hesburgh continued his study of theology at the Catholic University of America, Washington. 
D.C.. receiving his doctorate (S.T.D.) in 1945. 
In the same year. he joined Ole Notre Dame faculty as a professor of theolo­gy. and served as chaplain to World War II veterans on campus. In 1948, Hesburgh was appointed the head of the Religion Department. and the fol­lowing year was appointed executive vice-president in the adniinistration of Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C. 
From June 1952 until June 1. 1987. Hesburgh served as the fifteenth presi­dent of Notre Dame. and he continues to contribute to the spirituality and academic life of Our Lady's university. He has held the longest tenure among presidents of American institutions of higher learning. 
As perhaps the most accomplished and well-known president emeritus in higher education today. Hesburgh remains active both nationally and internationally as a coordinator of ecu­menical and human rights movements. 
For those who are interested in join­ing SERV, a meeting will be held tonight in the same location at 7 p.m.

The co-presidents said the Sorin Talent Show plays an ac­tive role in promoting both dorm and campus unity. 
"This is one night when all the guys in the dorm are brought together ... Eppinger 
.... explained. Lefort feels the event has the same effect on the community as the Keenan Revue or the Fisher Regatta. "During the show we let other dorms see what we're all about. and invite other students and their families and friends to join us at the show and the post-tal­ent show party afterwards. " said l.ef ort. Eppinger said that most 
events will be comical and em­phasized that the show will fea­ture more fun than talent. The men of Sorin have spent a long time preparing for the show. clearing the performance with Student Affairs and helping the freshmen put together their acts. according to Eppinger. 
A wide variety of acts will be performed. Freshmen Chris Fahey and his roommate James Bozer are among a group of men participating in a Blues Brother's routine co-ordinated by sophomore James Taylor. 
"Deitz is a Blues Brother. and we'll be playing the trombone and the saxophone," said Fahey. "It will probably be more of a comical than a musi­cal production." 
Freshman Paul Heller and his friend are also looking forward to the Talent Show. "My friend and I are going to try to sing a song I wrote about the Notre Dame/Michigan game. If I can get a karaoke machine we might have background music. If not. it could get interesting." Heller explained. 
The men of Sorin are hopeful that this year's show will fare as well as last year's, when Sorin co-president Scott Curtis shaved his head. The event helped raise more than one thousand dollars for the Center for the Homeless. 
This year. as part of a major fundraising effort. Eppinger and Lefort are competing to see who can raise more money for the Sorin Appalachia trip. Over October Break a group from Sorin will travel to the Appalachia region to help local residents prepare for the long winter ahead by donating sup­plies. material and manual la­bor. 
The trip. which was orga­nized by Sorin senior and resi­dent assistant Curtis. will cost more money than is currently available to the dorm. Each dorm on campus has been approached by one of the two presidents to help with the cost. 
The president who receives fewer pledges will have his head shaved on stage during the Sorin Talent Show. The two men have agreed that if pledges exceed three thousand dollars. both of them will go under the razor together. 
Eppinger admitted that he is­n't too excited about his future as a bald man. 
Eppinger. who described his hair as "thick. red. and very natural looking," has been preparing himself psychologi­cally for the event. asking friends to lend him emotional support. and keep cruel com­ments about his appearance to themselves. 
Lefort is also uncertain about the prospect of being a bald man in the 90's. "Losing my hair will emotionally scar me for the rest of the semester," he of us will end up bald by the predicted. 'Tm sure stock val­end of the evening." predicted ues will rise in the Hair Club for Eppinger. Men." Lefort explained that whoever 

Still. Eppinger and Lefort are wins. the dorm as a whole will more than willing to part with come out ahead. .. Hair will their locks in order to help grow back." said Lefort. "It Sorin Hall raise money for the means more to me that we will dorm's fall break trip to have raised enough money to Appalachia. supply the citizens of 
Both presidents said they are Appalachia with adequate hopeful that the show will be a materials to survive the win­success. "Somehow. I bet both ter."

Jordan 
continued from page 16 
Flanked by his wife. Juanita. and Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf. Jordan looked relaxed and frequently flashed the coy smile that graces bill­boards and airwaves world­wide. 
He still loves basketball and did not qlle out a comeback. but said he'd never play for an NBA team other than the Bulls. 
'Tm not making this a 'never' issue. I'm saying I don't have the driveright now," Jordan said. 
''Five years down the line. if the urge comes back. if the Bulls will have me and (com­missioner) David Stern lets me back in the league. I may come back. But that's a decision I don't have to make at this moment." he said. 
Stern, who attended the news conference, said Jordan's departure "means that an era is closing, that certainly one of the greatest players to play the game is leaving." 
Jordan's departure follows the retirement last year of NBA greats Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. but Stern said the league is still strong. 
Jordan's graceful athleticism seemed to defy gravity and gen­erated lots of copycats, but no player could match "Air" Jordan's accomplishments. 
Marten

to knock him down off the court. 
With the advent of the multi­million dollar endorsement contract, Jordan doesn't have to stay in the game for the money like his predecessors did. He's got enough stashed away to bet small change in $100,000 chunks on putts. 
So, Jordan is off to search for new challenges. No matter what he decides to do. for him it will be more exciting than hanging around the NBA and waiting for someone to come along who will challenge his accomplishments.

St. Ed's, after winning their first game in six years, is back In action this week against an Alumni team that lost last weekend. St. Ed's beat Sorin by recovering a blocked punt for a touchdown with 1 :45 left in the game. Alumni failed to score a point in their 19-0 loss to Fisher.

Belles' soccer prepares to face Calvin College 
ByMARYGOOD Spons Wri1er 
The Saint Mary's soccer team is facing a challenging match this afternoon as they take on Calvin College in Grand Rapids. MI. 
After their victory over DePauw last Saturday. the Belles' spirits are high. They had a couple days of rest and some good practice time. according to coach Tom Van Meter. 
"We are anxious to get back and play," he said. 
The team has suffered some injuries in recent weeks. but three key players recovering from knee injuries have been practicing for today's game. 
Seniors Patty Hand. Molly O'Connell. and Mandy Eiler all suffered knee injuries earlier this year. and may be available to play depending upon their progress. 
"Their status still remains day-to-day," Van Meter said. 
Today's matchup is going to be a difficult one for the Belles. Earlier in the season the Belles were defeated by Kalamazoo who subsequently suffered a loss to Calvin. 
"This is a very important game," said sophomore Rita Juster. 
Van Meter also feels it is a key match. but admits it won't be an easy one. 
"It is going to be a break either way." he said. "If the team executes the way it did against DePauw. I think we have a good chance."

Women's soccer shuts down Wisconsin-Milwaukee 

By BRYAN CONNOLLY 
Assistant SportS Editor 
To keep a team from scoring is outstanding. To keep a team from shooting is unbelievable. 
Not only did the Notre Dame women's soccer team crush Wisconsin-Milwaukee 6-0 last night. but it also outshot the Panthers 24-0. 
The sixth ranked Irish improved their record to 11-1 after rolling past 6-5-2 Wisconsin in an offensive blitz which featured five different scorers. 
Junior midfielder Tiffany Thompson opened the scoring for Notre Dame 9:31 into the contest with an unassisted blast from thirty yards out to the left of the goal box. 
Fellow midfielder Jodi Hartwig expanded the lead to 2-0 two minutes and 47 sec­onds later when she booted a loose Thompson corner kick through a crowd and into the net from five yards out. 
Sophomore attacker Michelle McCarthy, who started at mid­field because Ragen Coyne was out with a pulled hamstring. added two more goals before the end of the half to all but assure Notre Dame the victory. The goals. which were McCarthy's eighth and ninth of the season. were both assisted by freshman midfielder Cindy Daws. Freshman forward Stacia Masters and sophomore forward Rosella Guerrero also earned assists on the scores. 
With a reshuffled line-up on the field to open the second half. the Irish wasted no time getting back on the board. With just under eight minutes expired in the half. Masters received a 20 yard pass from Daws and booted in her fourth goal of the year from five yards out. 
Senior forward Tasha Strawbridge wrapped up the scoring when she kicked in a Kate Fisher corner kick for her first goal of the season. 
"They're a very talented team," said Wisconsin head coach Susan Moynihan. "I respect them a lot. Hopefully we learned something from it." 
"We played with a little bit more intensity than we did this weekend," said McCarthy. 
"We played alright." said Thompson. "We moved the ball well. and that's what we've been working on." 
"It gives us some momentum going into the weekend," said Irish head coach Chris Petrucelli, referring to the important conference contest with Xavier. "It sends us into the game with the right frame of mind." 
"Even though this wasn't a huge game," said McCarthy, "it builds our confidence a little bit." 
"It's good for us,"' added Thompson. 
The Irish have now won 16 of their last 1 7 games. dating back to last October. 
Daws' two assists brought her scoring line to seven goals and fourteen assists. Her 28 points place her at ninth in the Central Region and 14th in the nation. Guerrero's assist brought her scoring line to eleven goals and four assists. Her 26 points place her at tenth in the region and 16th in the nation. 
Coyne is listed as question­able for this weekend.

Right now. he is truly the best at what he does. There is no one better in the NBA. There is no one who can guard him

their career-long battle became mean­ingless. Clearly. Jordan was better than the aging stars were in their prime. 
The reason people are having so much trouble believing Jordan's decision is because there is no comparable example in any sport. There has never been an athlete who is has excelled so completely at what he or she did and who set a stan­dard for excellence so high that it doesn't appear that anyone will reach it anytime soon. 
In the evolutionary process of all sports. the athletes get better with advances in training and equipment. but professional basketball has reached a point where it has to evolve to Jordan's standards. 
He just ran out of goals. He proved he could dunk better. He proved he could score more points in a game than any­one. He proved he could win it all by bringing Chicago its first NBA Championship. And its second. And its third.

Jordan makes retirement official 
By LINDSEY TANNER 
Associated Press Writer 
DEERFIELD. Ill. 
With no tears. just that trademark twinkle in his eyes. Michael Jordan retired Wednesday from the game he redefined but hinted that basketball may not have seen the last of him yet. 
"I've reached the pinnacle of my career," Jordan said in an announce­ment that shocked fans and teammates alike. "I just feel that I don't have any­thing else for myself to prove." 
At a news conference packed with hundreds of reporters at the Bulls' training center, Jordan said he'd lost the motivation to play and had thought about retiring after leading the Bulls to their third straight NBA championship in June. 
The 30-year-old superstar said the slaying of his father this summer was not the main reason behind his decision. 
"I was pretty much decided at that particular time. but I think what it made me realize was how short life is," he said. 
"I guess the biggest positive thing I can take out of my father not being here today is that he saw my last basketball game. That meant a lot," Jordan said. 

AP File Photo Michael Jordan made his retirement offi­cial at a press conference yesterday. 
Jordan had been dogged in the last year by reports of excessive gambling. and a highly publicized book about the Bulls portrayed him as a sometimes self­ish player who looked down on most of his teammates. 
He said media scrutiny had not driven him from the game. but acknowledged that he won't miss the spotlight.
