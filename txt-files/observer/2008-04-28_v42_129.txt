ND student assaulted, left 7 miles from campus 
Sophomore got into car on Ironwood Drive, said he was robbed, found early April 20; still in University Health Services 
By CHRIS HINE News Writer 
A Notre Dame student suffered a concussion and a broken right hand on April 20 after he was allegedly assaulted, robbed and left approximately seven miles from campus, St. joseph county police said Saturday. 
Sophomore Timothy Clarke, 20, said he left Tailgaters Sports Bar around 3 a.m. and got into a car with either two or three men near Nick's Patio on Ironwood Drive early in the morning on April 20. 
Clarke, a resident of Keough Hall, said he thought the men would give him a ride back to campus. The men, whose identi­ties are unknown, allegedly assaulted him, took Clarke's wallet and cell phone, and left him on the side of Primrose Road about seven miles from campus, St. Joseph County Police Detective Phil Williams said. 
A 911 call was placed to county police by a passer-by, who saw Clarke lying unconscious. Police responded to the call and found Clarke at approximately 6:45 a.m. and took him to Memorial Hospital in South Bend. Clarke is currently staying in University Health Services. 
Williams said the identities of the suspects are unknown and he and Clarke said they did not know why the assault and robbery occurred. 
Clarke said Sunday he could not remember if he voluntarily got into the car or was forced into the car, but Williams said he would not likely charge the men with kid­napping or abduction if he fmds them. 
Clarke's account of what hap­pened may not be 100 percent accurate, Williams said, because of memory loss Clarke suffered from his concussion and other head injuries, and also possibly from alcohol he consumed that night. But Williams said that with time, Clarke is regaining recollec­tion of what happened that night. 
Clarke spent most of last week in University Health Services before having surgery on his hand Thursday. After surgery, he was returned to Health Services where he will recover for the next few days, but doctors may need to per­form a second surgery on his hand. Clarke also sustained other lacerations and bruises on his head, chest, and elbow. 
Clarke said he tried to phone a friend, who was serving as a des­ignated driver, to pick him up from Tailgaters on Ironwood Drive at approximately 3 a.m. The driver was picking up other people at the time and told Clarke to wait at Tailgaters until he arrived to take Clarke back to campus, Clarke said.

Presidential hopeful challenges Barack Obama to Lincoln-Douglas style debate in Indiana 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY 
News Writer 
New York Senator and Democratic presidential can­didate Hillary Clinton chal­lenged Barack Obama to a debate in Indiana and dis­cussed key election issues in a speech Saturday afternoon at Coveleski Stadium in South Bend. 
"I am offering Senator Obama a chance to debate me one on one, no moderators," Senator Clinton said. "Just the two of us going for 90 minutes, asking and answer­ing questions. We'll set what­ever rules seem fair." 
Clinton said she is disap­pointed that Obama and she have only met four times in one-on-one debates. However, Obama rejected Clinton's request for another debate Sunday morning. 
"I think this country is sure worth debating about its future. I think the issues we face are sure worth dis­cussing. I want the American people to be part of that dis­cussion," Clinton said. 
Former Congressman John Brademas introduced Clinton to the crowd and emphasized the importance that Indiana will play in the upcoming election. 
"Indiana can play a key role in restoring vital leadership to our country," Brademas said.

Relay helps raise funds 
Event collects over $50,000 for research 
By MEG MIRSHAK News Writer 
In a spirit of celebration and remembrance, the Notre Dame community walked together as the Fighting Irish Fighting Cancer in the fifth annual Relay for Life. 
"The goal of Relay for Life is to raise awareness about cancer because it really is a disease that affects us all," public relations chair Adam Lamm said. 
The event, a fundraiser for the American Cancer Society, honors and remem­bers victims of cancer. Although the final total has not been released, students, faculty and staff collected over $50,000 in donations according to the Relay for Life Web site. The final total will be much higher after corporate donations are included. 

The Relay for Life was held on South Quad between Badin Hall and the Rockne Memorial Gymnasium. 
"The location was really good, in the center of stu­dent life on campus," chair of the Student Committee Chris Pingel said. 
Traditionally, Relay for Life is an overnight event, symbolizing that cancer endures. However, the event was scheduled to end at 1 
a.m. in observance of University policy that man-

'justwar' 
By JOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
Living by the just war the­ory is more essential now in the war on terror than ever, University President Emeritus Father Edward 
Malloy 
said in a 
lecture 
Friday. 
"As far as 
Christians 
are con­
cerned, 
there are 
two viable 
alterna­

tives just war theory or pacifism," Malloy said. 
Christianity began as a strictly pacifistic religion, according to Malloy. This pacifism was the result of both a strict interpretation of Biblical texts and the fact that Christians were a per­secuted minority, and had no need for military power. 
"If an alien comes from outer space and reads the text, Christianity would come out on the pacifist side," he said. "But does [pacifism] have a realistic view of human nature?" 
When Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, followers were no longer able to be pacifistic. 
"All of Christianity began to embrace just war theory, as an attempt to be realistic about evil and harm-doing," Malloy said.

Saint Mary's College president Carol Ann Mooney invited University president Fr. John Jenkins and Holy Cross College president Brother Richard Gilman to discuss the values and traditions of a Holy Cross education in a public meeting Friday. 
Moderated by vice president for College relations Shari Rodriguez, the three presidents spoke of the first time they encountered Holy Cross educa­tors, the beatification of Blessed Basil Moreau and the benefits of a Holy Cross education. 
All three said they try to apply Moreau's words "the mind will not be cultivated at the expense of the heart" from his book "Christian Pedagogy" to their own institutions. 
"What we're trying to do as a Holy Cross institution is having a seamless environment," Gilman said. "Learning doesn't just take place in the class­room." 
Gilman said Holy Cross College Board of Trustees recently approved a new strate­gic plan that takes Moreau's writings into account. 
"Having reflected on some of the things Moreau said ... [edu­cation is] really a holistic thing," he said. "The strategic planning that we've adopted really looked on the Holy Cross education that we are offering as a 10-year education not a four year edu­

But Clarke said he declined the ride and thinks he saw students he knew walking north on Ironwood toward Nick's Patio alone. 
"I figured I'd go there and wait for a cab," Clarke said. 
Clarke walked north along Ironwood Drive and said he thought he was near Nick's Patio when the car approached him. 
Clarke does not clearly remem­ber what happened next except that he thought these men would give him a ride back to campus. He got in the backseat and two men were in the front. A third man may have also been in the car, Clarke said. Williams said

I have always wanted a 'The Sandlot"

you lind yoursdf and you learn that with 
teamwork or a pair of PF Flyers, you can do

1-,rirls in both movies learn very serious les­
sons about themselves, their families and 
thn world the hard way. 
Then thnrn Lo; the pre-"Greao;e" summer, 
tlw one before the movie when the heroic 
Danny and 1:ramp-inflicted Sandy meet 
mid-swim, fall in love, and sing their way to 
a happy ending despite the soda.! trials of 
Hydelllligh. 

"Savnd by tim Bell" summers were epie. Zaeh, Kelly, Screech and the rest of the Bayside gang all go to a snazzy resort and take up jobs a<; busboys, waiters, coaches, lili!J.,tuard'i, ete. and spend time playing vol­leyba.IJ <md applying sunscreen to guesl'>. Even alter Zach starts dating the boss's daughter, he still manages to stay on the man's g1xKi side. Morri'i does not just enjoy summer. lie uses it to network. 
But it's "The Parent Trap" summer that truly serves a<; the model for a summer that is both fun and productive. Not only do llayley Mill<> and Lindsay Lohan (since both version<; deserve to be mentioned) get to go to summer camps where they make bird­cages out of popsicle sticks and learn to fenr,e, but they al'iO manage to find one another and reunite their divorced parents. Whethnr in 1961 or 1998, that's a summer wnll spent. 
There io; al'>O the Ray Bradbury "All Summer in a Day," summer. The short story takes place in a world that rains con­stantly. For a brief peri1Ki on one day of the year, though, the sun shines and all of the seh1x>l childnm (theoretically) go outside to enjoy the weather that will not be back for another 365 days. The shortness ofthi<> summer a.llows for the tension in the story (whieh is one of the saddest things I have evnr read, but very worth reading) and truly makes me appreciate the three or so months of n~liable sunshine that we get here. 
Taking all of thio; into consideration, I plan to take a break from working and throw a bwit~ball around thi'> summer and during whatevllr 'summers' I get from here on out. I hope that everyone does the same, because whether we are college kids, work­ing adullo;, or in between, summer seerno; to ~~ th1~ time to enjoy this life that we have.

Senator campaigns to ban replicas of bull testicles 
TALLAHASSEE -They're proudly displayed by any self-respecting bull, but dangling big metal ones on the back end of a truck could be banned in Florida. 
Metal replicas of bull tes­ticles have become trendy bumper ornaments in some parts of the Sunshine State, but state Sen. Carey Baker is campaigning to ban the orbs. 
Baker acknowledged that Florida lawmakers have more pressing issues, including huge revenue shortfalls, but said the state needs to draw a line on what's obscene before more objectionable adornments appear. 
State Sen. Steve Geller argued against Baker's bill. 
"I find it shocking that we should be telling people that have the metallic bull testicles . . . you're now going to have points on your license for this," said Geller. 
Saints give 53-year-old a second chance to pitch 
ST. PAUL -A 53-year­old knuckleballer named Jon Secrist isn't giving up on his goal of pitching in 
pro baseball, and the St. Paul Saints are giving him another chance. 
Secrist was invited Friday by the Saints to their spring training camp after a tryout in front of manager George Tsamis. Secrist will pitch for St. Paul in an exhibition game on Tuesday night. 
He had a prior stint with the Saints in 1999, when he posted a 9.34 ERA in two appearances. At the time, Secrist was the oldest signed rookie in profession­al baseball.

Students organize canned food drive 
Collection for poor part of Earth Week activities to promote awareness 
By EMMA DRISCOLL NewsWrirer 
Students collected canned food items from members of the South Bend community to be donated to The Food Bank of Northern Indiana in Saturday's Earth Week Canned Food Drive. 
"We basically go around and collect food from a bunch of neighborhoods in South Bend." co-coordinator Katie Day said. 
Day said South Bend resi­dents were informed about the Canned Food Drive by fliers passed out by student volunteers throughout the week. 
To kick off the Canned Food Drive, Lead ND brought kids they have mentored from the South Bend community to the event. 
The day was concluded by a blessing from University President Emiterius Father Ted Hesburgh. 
"Most student activities are for the benefit of the students ... but of all the things that get done around here, this stands out each year as some­thing very typical of Notre Dame because you're doing it for the poor," Hesburgh said. 
Last year. the Canned Food Drive collected 14,000 pounds of food, but Day said she expected less this year because not as many neigh­borhoods would be covered. 
Totals are not yet available for this year's Canned Food Drive because the Food Bank weighs the collections itself, Day said. She estimated that there "might have been 6 or 7,000 pounds of food, but that's not definite." 
The collections will be com­ing at a good time for the Food Bank of Northern Indiana. 
"Basically, the Food Bank of Northern Indiana has a diffi­cult time meeting the demand for food right now because a lot of collecting takes place in the winter months," Day said. 
The Canned Food Drive also calls attention to current events. 
"It is especially important this year because of the food and security issues going on worldwide are also effecting what's going on here," Day said. 
The Canned Food Drive was one of several Earth Week events. 
"We've had a really busy week, even more so than last year. We really expanded [Earth Week]." Students for Environmental Action [SEA] co-president Tracy Jennings said. 
The week kicked off April 19 with a tree-planting event in the Northwest Neighborhood before the Blue-Gold game, Jennings said. There was also game day recycling at the game, she said. 

On Monday, coffee and dis­cussion of environmental top­ics took place in O'Shaugnessy Hall, Jennings said. 
One of the larger events of the week was the Earth Day Festival held on Tuesday on Fieldhouse Mall. Representatives from the Farmers' Market and Elkhart Environmental Core attended to speak with students and WVFI brought music to the event. 
"A lot of people stopped by on their way to class and it was a big success," Jennings said. 
SEA teamed up with ND for Animals to hold a vegetarian no-waste dinner Wednesday, Jennings said. 
"No utensils were provided. You had to bring your own plate, spoon and fork so you didn't waste anything," Jennings said. 
Thursday night was the Nature Film Festival, which featured films treating envi­ronmental topics. 
Notre Dame power plant tours were offered Friday, and Sunday the SEA partnered with Best Buddies for a picnic and to share information about recycling and compost­ing with the buddies. 
"It was a great week for fel­lowship and for education and for having a good time," Jennings said.

Mooney agreed with Jenkins saying Moreau was an innova­tive educator.

"I think that has characterized Holy Cross higher institutions specif­ically ... the ability to examine ideas from a variety of perspec­tives because we're not afraid of engaging the world."

Williams said he could not

According to the county police log, Clarke was only able to give police limited identification. Canarecci, who has been sherill' for six years, said this case is unique. 
"That I'm awam of, it's the first such abduction and assault of a Notre Dame student," Canarecei said. "There have been thefts, there have been assaults but to aetually pick someone up and beat him, I can't recall that in many, many years." 
Canarecci also said he hopes this typn of <Timl~ doesn't become a l'mquent problem and urged stu­dents to use caution when getting rides back to campus. 
"The fortunate thing was he wasn't hurt worse than he was," Canareeei said. "I hope this does­n't become more of a eommon­place thing. I hopo it's just an iso­lated incident." 
NUSP director Phil Johnson con­tacted Canarecd Friday about the case and ollf1red any assistance he muld give, Canarncr.i said. NDSP S!-,rt. Dave Dosmann is now a<;si..<;t­ing Williams in the investigation. 
Canareed said he did not know il' Tailgaters would be fined for serving to an underage person, because that would depend on what type of identification Clarke presented to l11e bar. 
Anyone with inliJrmation about the incident should call St. Joseph County Poliee.

Father imprisons daughter for 24 years 
VIENNA -Police have found a woman miss­ing since 1984, who told authorities that her father had kept her in a cellar for almost 24 years and that she had given birth to at least six children after being repeatedly raped by him. 
The 73-year-old father was taken into cus­tody, said franz Polzer, head of the Lower Austrian Bureau of Criminal Affairs, on Sunday. 
Authorities found the woman Saturday evening in the town of Amstetten following a tip, Lower Austria police said in a statement. 
The 42-year-old woman told police that her father began sexually abusing her when she was 11 and locked her in a room in the cellar on Aug. 28, 1984. 
During the 24 years that followed, she said she was continually abused and gave birth to six children, the statement said. She said she gave birth to twins in 1996 but one died several days later; police said they were investigating.

WASHINGTON -Democratic presidential candi­date Barack Obama said Sunday that race is not the reason he L'> struggling to attract working-class votes and insisted he can win over uncommitted supordelegates by showing he is "best able to not just defeat John McCain, but also lead the coun­try." 
Speaking in a broadcast interview, Obama also brushed aside a challenge from Hillary Rodham Clinton to debate before the May 6 primaries in Indiana and North Carolina. ''I'm not ducking. We've had 21" debates, he said. 
Civil rights advocates protest verdict 
NEW YOHK -A coalition of civil rights advo­cates on Sunday urged changes in the handling of police misconduct and brutality complaints after the acquittal of three officers involved in the shoot­ing death of an unarmed man on his wedding day. 
They also called for a permanent state-level spe­cial prosecutor to investigate such cases. 
"The verdict in the Sean Bell case proves it is almost impossible to successfully prosecute cases of police misconduct, especially in homicide cases," said lawyer Norman Siegel, former head of the New York Civil Liberties Union. 
"The verdict underscores the need for systemic change in the way New York handles these impor­tant and at times high profile cases, and to improve community relations," said Siegel, an out­spoken advocate on civil right'> and law enforce­ment issues.

Neighbor describes accused as 'strange' 
SOUTH BEND -A neighbor of a 16-year­old boy accused of planning a Columbine-style attack on his high school described him as "kind of strange." 
"lie was an average kid, but kind of strange," said Allen McBride, who lives seven houses away. "He came down here one day with a snake wrapped around his arm and said, 'Do you want to buy a snake'?' I said, 'Man get back there."' 
McBride said he's lived in the house for 22 ynars and had watched the boy grow up from tlw time hn usnd to visit his deceased gqmdfa­tlwr until he movPd into the house with his undn. lin said the boy didn't spend time with other children in the neighborhood, though he used to play with another boy who has since mov(~d away. 
Wildfire spreads near Los Angeles 
More than 1,000 people must evacuate; fire expected to burn for two or three days 
Associated Press 

SIERRA MADRE, Calif. -An early season wild­fire slowly chewed its way through dense brush near Los Angeles on Sunday, forcing more than 1,000 people from homes in the foothills. 
More than 400 fire­fighters attacked the 350-acre fire, aided by two helicopters and water-dropping air tankers, said Elisa Weaver of the Arcadia Fire Department. Residents evacuated at least 550 homes Saturday night and Sunday, but none had burned. 
"This is pretty serious," Weaver said. "Some of these areas have not burned in over 40 years." 
Smoke and fire bil­lowed near neighbor­hoods on the outskirts of Sierra Madre near Bailey Canyon Wilderness Park. The fire moved slowly as it fed on brush and was estimated to be 5 to 10 percent contained. It is expected to continue burning for another two or three days. 
Winds were calm early Sunday, boosting fire­fighter efforts, Weaver said.

IN BRIEF 
Chavez threatens Sidor expropriation 
CARACAS, Venezuela -President Hugo Chavez is threatening to expropriate Venezuela's largest steel maker because he says shareholders are demanding excessive compensation for the company's nationaliza­tion. 
Chavez dismissed a request made by Sidor's parent company, Luxembourg-based Ternium SA, for US$4 billion (2.6 billion) in exchange for a 60 percent stake in the steel maker. 
Chavez ordered Sidor nationalized earlier this month, taking sides with workers who fought for improved salaries and benefits. 
His government is still negotiating the price it will pay to shareholders to take over the company. Chavez says he may expropriate the company outright if the two sides fail to reach an agreement. 
Israel slows Palestinian economy 
RAMALLAH, West Bank-The Palestinian economy won't grow this year, largely due to Israeli restrictions on movement and despite billions of dollars in aid meant to shore up support for peace talks, the World Bank pre­dicted Sunday. 
The bleak prognosis stands in contrast to the bank's initial assessment that double­digit economic growth would be possible if Israel, the Palestinian government and the donors did their part. 
The bank now estimates that the Gross Domestic Product -currently at about $4 billion -will grow by only 3 percent in 2008. 
"That, taking into account population growth, leaves per capita income static, if not lower than the previous year," the report said. 
The bank noted that the Gaza economy has sharply contracted because of the virtually complete closure of the Gaza strip by Israel and Egypt after the violent Hamas takeover there last year. In the West Bank, where Israel maintains a network of hundreds of checkpoints, gates and earthen barriers, GOP growth was only modest, the bank said. 
In December, donor countries pledged $7.7 billion over three years to help fund a Palestinian reform and development plan.

Workers strike over pensions 
BP PLC shuts down pipeline system; group predicts $100 million loss per day 
Associated Press 

EDINBURGH, Scotland -Hundreds of workers at Scotland's only oil refinery on Sunday began a 48-hour strike that has forced BP PLC to shut a pipeline system that delivers almost a third of Britain's North Sea oil. 
BP said it had complet­ed the closure of the Forties Pipeline System by 6 a.m., when 1,200 workers at the Grangemouth refinery in central Scotland walked off the job. The pipeline brings in 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the North Sea to BP's Kinneil plant, which is powered from the Grangemouth site. 
Energy industry group Oil & Gas U.K. said the strike, over pension issues. could cost $100 million a day in lost pro­duction. 
The main effect of the walkout was likely to be felt by the British Treasury -which relies heavily on taxes from oil production -and at gas stations in Scotland, some of which limited purchases in anticipation of the strike. 
The government urged Hutton, told the British pounds $2.47 Ineos, and the workers' motorists not to hoard Broadcasting Corp. "But Saturday for a liter of union, Unite.

Continental says it will not seek merger 
Associated Press 

DALLAS -Continental Airlines Inc. said Sunday it would not pur­sue a combination with another carrier right away, a surprising move after weeks of growing specu­lation that it would join with United Airlines to create the world's biggest airline. 
Continental Chairman and Chief Executive Lawrence Kellner said in a message to employees that the Houston-based airline was better off alone than merging. 
"We have significant cultural, operational and financial strengths compared to the rest of the indus­try, and we want to protect and enhance those strengths -which we believe would be placed at risk in a merger with another carrier in today's environment," Kellner told employees. 
Although it reported an $80 mil­lion loss in the first quarter, Continental is widely viewed as the second-strongest U.S. carrier in financial terms, behind only Southwest Airlines Co., which has indicated it isn't interested in a merger. 
While Kellner ruled out a merger for the time being, Continental appeared to leave the door open to an alliance with another carrier. The airline has reportedly discussed such an arrangement with AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, in which the companies would work together in many ways but not merge their operations. 
Airlines have been considering consolidation as a way to cut costs and raise fares in the face of record fuel prices. Delta Air Lines Inc. announced earlier this month it has agreed to buy Northwest Airlines Corp. in a stock-swap deal that would create the world's largest carrier. A Continental-United com­bination would have trumped Delta­Northwest in size. 
"Every U.S. carrier, including Continental, is under enormous pressure from record high fuel prices, a slowing U.S. economy and a weak dollar," Kellner told employ­ees. "In today's harsh environment, we must continue to adjust our business model to ensure we suc­cessfully navigate through these dif­ficult times, so that in the future we can once again grow and prosper." 
Continental expects to spend $1.2 billion more on fuel this year than it did in 2007. To cope with the added cost, the airline plans to take some older, less-fuel-efficient planes out of service over the next 12 months and to reduce its U.S. capacity by 5 percent beginning this fall. 
Ray Neidl, an analyst with Calyon Securities, said Continental's exit leaves US Airways Group Inc. as a potential merger partner for United. 
The CEOs of United and US Airways are both vocal proponents of airline mergers. But US Airways lacks the strong international routes that made Continental an attractive partner. 
A US Airways spokesman declined to comment, and a United spokesman did not immediately return a call for comment.

Please
the ease in the Division 1-AA games I'd seen. The sec­ond was that before the game, I heard more than a few fans chanting "Go Irish. beat 'gay' Tech," then laughing at their own cleverness at substituting "gay" for GA. Later that term. I heard that a few people worn planning on demonstrating (against homosexuality, I guessl by wearing "Gay'? Go to Hell" T-shirts around campus. In both cases, I rolled my eyes and wondered how people could act in such poor taste, but didn't dwell too much on it. 
Last week, I was asked to sign a petition to get the University to add sexual orientation to its non-discrimi­nation elause, something that students have been trying to get passed for about a decade. And as I thought back to those episodes from last fall, I real­ized that there was a common thread connecting them with the petition. By refusing to protect homosexuals in its non-discrimination elause, the University is doing the same thing as the people who use the word "gay" pejoratively or who are wearing "Gay'? 
Two words 
Go to Hell" T-shirts. All of them, sim­
ply put, are reducing a person's iden­
tity to their sexual orientation. 
According to the University, adding the words "sexual orientation" to the non-discrimination clause could open up a Pandora's Box of litigation, possi­bly compromising its ability "to sup­port Church teachings on sexual ori­entation and conduct," especially problematic since such a matter has "theological connotations." The gov­erning bodies of the University, mean­while, pay lip service to inclusiveness -as the Spirit of Inclusion reassures us, "we value gay and lesbian mem­bers of this community as we value all members of this community"-but will not say so in any legally binding sense. In the meantime, the University tacitly reserves the right (one that, to be sure, is very rarely, if ever, invokedl to keep gay and lesbian stu­dents from taking classes, playing sports, getting scholarships and gen­erally taking advantage of the many great opportunities afforded to them by the University. 
I wonder, then, how insisting that homosexuals are equally valued mem­bers in the community but refusing to give them the same legal protection that everyone else gets promotes a "Spirit of Inclusion." To define some­one by their sexual orientation ­whether for comic effect, for the sake of provocation or to refuse them legal protection from discrimination -is to judge thHm for one small aspect of' thHir identity, not on the mnrits of' their personality, intnllnet or charac­ter. Even thn Church acknowlndges that a homosnxual person is not del'ined entirnly by tlwir snxual eon­duet. Such reduetionism is a dnnial of' basie human dignity. And it is thorn­fore doubly insulting that thn reasons that the University gives for doing so are ultimately practical (i.n. to pre­vent legal meddling in University affairs), though the theological impli­cations arH sometimns vaguely alluded to. 
According to its mission statement, Notre Dame prides itself for instilling in its students not only "those disei­plined habits of mind, body and spirit which characterize ndueated, skilled, free human beings," but also impart­ing to thHm "a st~nse of human soli­darity and concern for the common good." We need look no further than our own university-in fact, no fur­ther than thn book that contains these very statements-to see where a sense of human solidarity and concern for thn common good is laeking, all over two words. 
I signed thn petition, by the way.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Spell check 'Juicy Campus' 
I once heard a piece of wisdom that has now become frighteningly more applicable: Don't do anything that you wouldn't want to see cov­ered on the front page of the newspaper. That is, when faced with a decision, imagine the consequences (with your name attached) as the next day's headline. With JuicyCampus.com, that imaginary front page has, unfortunately, become a little less imagi­nary. 
With this in mind, Juicy Campus, to me, seems a little less evil. Knowing that your actions may magically appear before the world for anyone to read may make you think twice before you drunkenly leap onto a dorm coffee table (I heard some guy tore his you-know­what doing that). But, if it doesn't get you to change your mind about certain courses of action, at least it can bring you to the realiza­tion that gossip is real and it just may be about you. Did you do something you shouldn't have with someone you shouldn't have over Spring Break? Well, if you thought no one was going to know about it, you're living iri fantasyland. People talk. And isn't Juicy Campus nothing but a collection of thoughts, sentiments and notions that we all may have but just not ver­balize? 
That brings us to the racism, sexism, clas­sism, heterosexism, anti-geekism, whatev­erism that is so shockingly prevalent in our classmates' posts {was anyone truly shocked?). Now, at least, the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's communities can't deny that these are real problems. Instead ofthese thoughts being locked away in our minds, they have manifest­ed themselves on this public forum and, hon­estly, it's pretty ugly. I personally haven't been attacked on Juicy Campus but I cannot help but point out the most obscene, disgusting and utterly offensive thing I have found in the posts: the spelling and grammatical errors. This is Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. Come on, people. If you're going to cruelly degrade another person or group in order to cover up your own insecurities, at least retain a shred of your own dignity and use spell check.

Greatness through sensibility 
As an alumnus of Columbia myself, Andrew Nesi's recent column {"The best school in the country," Apr. 24) was a joy to read as it brought back many fond memories of my days in the John Jay Lounge. I am, though, somewhat confused by the logic of his column. He suggests that Notre Dame is a great institution because it mimics the same polarizing debates that are found in the American mainstream media. 
However, I would counter that what is great about Notre Dame are the people who are shocked and dismayed that in the year 2008, such debates can continue, as if certain ques­tions are still open for discussion. To me it is most appalling, given the numerous documents of the Catholic Church on the dignity of the human person, that any Catholic university would still be arguing over adding sexual orientation to the non-discrimination clause. Nesi is correct in that this is indeed a "mockable conversation" if not for the fact that those who advocate discrimination are so lamentably serious.

Want to lower drinking age? Stop driving drunk 
What is it about alcohol that makes some people lose all cognitive func­tion? After being dressed up as the ethanol scarecrow that would fight farm overproduction, oil dependence and global warming 
Tim Williams

-despite much evi­dence to the contrary -a vocal minority in The Badger several states includ­
Herald 

ing Wisconsin has once again turned to alcohol to solve their problems. Seemingly as a half-hearted recom­pense to young soldiers fighting a war in Iraq most Americans no longer sup­port, some want to lower the drinking age to 18-for military personnel only. 
The most bizarre proposal, however, is a bill introduced in Minnesota that would allow 18-year-olds to drink in bars and restaurants, but not to buy liquor in stores. Presumably support­ers are afraid of uninhibited binge drinking at teen house parties, but wasn't the whole point of the federal government strong-arming states into raising the drinking age to 21 to stop drunken driving? Overwhelming evi­dence shows raising the drinking age lowers fatal automobile accidents, which is why Ronald Reagan, who made big government public enemy No. 1, signed a constitutionally ques­tionable 1984law that ties 10 percent of federal highway funds to setting the drinking age at 21. A 2003 review by the Center for Disease Control showed increasing the drinking age lowered fatal accidents by 16 percent and the National Traffic Highway Administration estimates 900 lives each year have been saved by the switch. While that might not seem like a huge number, it's hard to argue against a proven safety measure. 
Students can moan and groan all they like, but proposals to change the drinking age are doomed to failure as long as one out of six of adult motorists nationwide report driving under the influence, as found by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. According to a 2007 Gallop poll, 77 percent of Americans oppose lowering the drinking age. Until it's no longer a given that someone at a party will drive home drunk, the visceral images of deadly car accidents will continue to stir outrage, even as we decide it's OK to drive intoxicated ourselves. 
Wisconsin tops the list of drunken drivers, with more than a quarter of motorists saying they have driven while intoxicated in the past year. Of course, analysts immediately hit on the obvious cultural factors at play here, with both Nina J. Emerson, director of the Resource Center on Impaired Driving at the University of Wisconsin Law School, and Paul Moberg, senior scientist at UW's Population Health Institute, pointing to Wisconsin's gen­eral acceptance of drinking being high­er than many other states, according to an Apr. 22 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article. 
But this ignores the fact that even in Utah, a state where a majority of resi­dents belong to a religion that pro­hibits the consumption of alcohol, one in 10 people reported drinking and driving. Clearly, the problem is that Americans love their cars as much they love their booze. The United Kingdom-with the same .08 blood­alcohol concentration legal limit as all 50 U.S. states -had only 560 alcohol­related deaths in 2004 among its 60 million people, according to the British Medical Association. While the U.S. has five times the population, it had more than 20 times the alcohol-related deaths. 
One oft-cited explanation for high 
U.S. traffic fatalities is that most inter­national drivers first receive permits after they reach the legal drinking age. This makes little to no sense, however. The difference, if any, is usually less than a year, and traffic fatalities, sober and not, remain high for young people well after they turn 21, as any insur­ance or rental car agent will tell you. The only reason the drinking age won't raise to 25 is the uproar would be even louder than if it were lowered to 18. It's certainly true Europeans are less car-dependent, but the move to public transportation in this country has been slow and painful. 
No, what Wisconsin needs is to cor­rect its two-faced attitude toward drunken driving with harsh penalties even for first-time offenses -this is the only state where a first drunken driving incident is not criminal. While there are concerns that ignition locks may not yet hold the answer, as a California Motor Vehicles Department study found they did not deter first­time offenders, we should look to inno­vations like these to keep alcohol­impaired drivers off the street. If we can do that, then maybe college stu­dents young and old can legally have a beer together.

Belles end season with series split 
By LAURA MYERS Spons Writer 
The Belles (23-8 overall, 12-4 MIAA) finished the regular season with a dou­bleheader split with Tri­State Saturday at Saint Mary's. 
In game one, the Belles took an early 3-1 iiHtd after thn third inning, but the Thunder scored five unan­swnred runs in the next three frames to win the game 8-:3. Junior Calli Davison (11-8) took the loss. 
Game two started out sim­ilarly, with Saint Mary's jumping out to a 3-0 lead in tho first on a home run by junior Ashley Fusaro. This 

time, however, it was the Belles scoring five more unanswered runs, as they went on to shut out the Thunder 8-0. 
Saint Mary's' only senior, McKenna Corrigan, pitched the complete game shutout to finish her final season a perfeet 12-0. She also hit a three-run home run in the top of the fifth in her last home at-bat. Overall, she. was 2-for-3 with three HBI and two runs scored in game two. 
")Corrigan) was fantastic," coach Erin Sullivan said. "She hit [the home run] off of Elise English, Tri-State's stud pitcher." 
English pitehed the fifth and sixth innings of game 
two. The three-time MIAA pitcher of the week came into the game with an ERA of 0.98. 
The Belles are nearing or have already surpassed sev­eral school records. Their 12 league wins are the most in the regular season for Saint Mary's since it joined the MIAA in 1998. 
Individually, sophomore Ashley Peterson is close to single-handedly re-writing the offensive reeord book. She posted two hits on Saturday, tying her for most hits in a season with 53. That record, held by Andrea Arena, dates back to 1997. Peterson's 36 RBis are only three away from tying the school record, and Corrigan 
is right behind her with 32 RBis. Peterson, who has hit 13 doubles so far, is just six doubles from tying the career record. 
Sullivan said Peterson also has a good chance at being the regular season batting champion with a .580 in­conference batting average. 
The Belles will head to the MIAA tournament as either 
the  No.  2  or  No.  3  seed,  
depending  on  whether Tri­ 
State wins  or  loses against  

Adrian. Tri-State will also be eompeting in the tourna­ment, which will be held at Alma College on Thursday and Friday.

Nadal beats Federer, takes Monte Carlo 
Associated Press 
MONTE CAHLO, Monaco -Hafael Nadal won his first title of the season, defeating top­ranked Hoger Federer yet again on elay to elaim his fourth eonsecutive Monte Carlo Masters. 
The second-ranked Spaniard won 7-5, 7-5 Sunday, and improved his clay-eourt record over Federer to 7-1. 
"Winning four times here is unimaginable," said Nadal, who earned his 24th career title. "l{oger played a great match. We always have good finals." 
Nadal has won 98 of his last 99 matches on clay, with a loss to Federer in the 2007 llarnburg final the only blip. 
The Swiss star blew com­manding leads in each set, breaking Nadal to lnad 4-3 in the first and racing to a 4-0 lead in thn second. 
"Disappointing seeond set," Federer said. "After playing the right way against him and thnn letting him back into the match, it was disappointing. Maybe I didn't play my best." 
Federer eommitted too many unforcnd errors, sur­prisingly on his forehand, and 

...­
let Nadal back into the match. 
"lie deserves to win, Federer said. ''I'm pushing Rafa today, having the feeling I ean beat him if I play the right way. And I think that's thn feeling I didn't have after (Monte Carlo) last year." 

Nadal is the only player in the Open era. to win four straight titles at Monte Carlo, and the first since Anthony Wilding of New Zealand (1911-14). 
Nadal has won 22 eonsecu­tive matches at Monte Carlo since losing to Guillermo Coria in the third round in 2003. Federer was the last person to take a set from him in the 2006 final. Nadal missed 2004 with injury. 
The three-time French Open ehampion is 19-1 in clay-court finals, while Federer dropped to 7-8 on his least favorite surface. The 12-time Grand Slam ehampion has never won the French Open, the only major .title missing from his resume. 
Still, Nadal thinks Federer remains the best, despite a slower start to the season. Federer picked up his first win of the season last week at the Estoril Open. 
"I think he doesn't get enough credit," Nadal said. "It is impossible to be at 100 per­cent all your career, he is still No. 1, the best in the world." 
Relying too much on his forehand, Federer also missed routine volleys at the net, and made 44 unforced errors. 
Federer seemed poised to even the match after hitting some near-perfect winners down the line and taking a 4-0 lead in the second set. Nadal struggled to hold his serve in the fifth game, but turned the

Girls take second at qualifier 
By ALEX BARKER Sports Writer 
It was just too little too late this weekend for Saint Mary's, who Jinished second in the MIAA's NCAA qualify­ing tournament in Marshall, Mich. 
The Belles shot the final round low seore of 342 but were unable to overcome the 23-stroke deficit they faced after the first two rounds of the three-round event. 
In the final round of the qualifier, senior captain Katie O'Brien led the Belles with an 81 and freshman Rosie O'Connor fired an 84. 
Saint Mary's finished 22 strokes behind first-place finisher Olivet, who received the MIAA's auto­matic bid into the NCAA tournament. 
With their recent success­ful performances in the Vassar Invitational, the Illinois-Wesleyan Spring Fling and the MIM tourna­ment, the Belles have a good chance of receiving an at-large bid into the nation­al tournament by being chosen from a group of teams by an NCAA selection eommittee on May 5. 
If the Belles are among the chosen, they will travel to Waverly, Iowa, to com­pete in the NCAA champi­onship tournament May 13­16.

It was the fourth career runner-up finish for Moore, the first player since Tiger Woods to skip Q-school and go straight from college to the PGA Tour. Woods got his first victory in his sev­enth start as a pro, while Moore is still looking for his first after 70 tourna­ments since 2005, after he was a four-time All­American at UNLV.

IRVING, Texas -Adam Scott felt he needed to make a statement by win­ning Sunday. He did, though, not quite the way he wanted to do it. 
After blowing the three­stroke lead he carried into the final round, Scott made a 9-foot birdie putt on No. 18 to force a playoff, then made a 48-footer playing it again on the third playoff hole to beat Ryan Moore in the EDS Byron Nelson Championship.

!HYING, Texas -The NFL for­mally approved Tennessee's trade of suspended cornerback Adam "Pacman" Jones to the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday. 
"l think for Adam's sake it's a very good 11rst step," Jones' agent Manny Arora said. "We still have to get through the NFL commission­er's office. I think once we do that we can breathe a sigh of relief and get back to playing football." 
Jones must still be reinstated by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. Arora declined to discuss the details of the contract Jones signed. 
Dallas gave the Titans a fourth­round pick in this year's draft and a sixth-rounder next year for Jones. The Cowboys would get back a fourth-rounder in 2009 if Pacman isn't reinstated, or a fifth-rounder if he returns then gets punished again. 
wasn't quite the statement I had in mind. I would have liked to have gone out there and have played like Rya?, played and won by a few. 
Still, Scott made the clutch shots when he need­ed them for his sixth PGA Tour victory after cutting short his post-Masters trip home to Australia so not to waste his good play there. 
Playing the 18th hole for the third time in less than an hour, the second time in the playoff. Scott hit his tee shot into a fairway bunker to the right. But he got his approach to the front of the green, then rolled the putt over two ridges and into the cup. 
"I got away with one today," said Scott, at No. 10 in the world the highest­ranked player in the Nelson field. "A bit lucky." 
Moore still had a chance to force another hole, but his pin-high putt from the fringe skimmed just past the cup. 
''I'm just a little frustrat­ed I didn't make mine," said Moore, who closed with a 2-under 68 to match Scott (71) at 7 -under 273. 
The playoff was a fitting end after a back-and-forth Sunday duel between Scott and Moore, who 11nished four shots ahead of Bart Bryant (72). Nicholas Thompson (67), Mark Hensby (69) and Carl 

Busch cruises to victory
under caution flag 
TALLADEGA, Ala. -Kylp, Busch fell a lap down midway through the race, and after racing his way back into contention, needed an awesome save to keep himself from triggering a massive crash. 
"Typical Talladega," he thought. 
Only this time, the crash happened behind Busch. Instead of leaving Talladega Superspeedway with a smashed-up car, he drove into Victory Lane. The kid who couldn't conquer Talladega fmally won at the harrow­ing track Sunday, and in this break­out season for Busch, it was only fit­ting that he coasted to the victory. 
''I'd like to say that I'm smarter than I look, but that's certainly not the case," Busch said. "Today was just due to having a great car. Getting a lap down, that was like, 'Oh, typical Talladega' there. But I didn't wreck today and I was definitely happy of that." 
UCLA's Ship_p declares for 
draft, won'fliire agent 
LOS ANGELES-UCLA's Josh Shipp will enter the NBA draft, but the junior won't hire an agent, leaving hin1 the option of returning to play for the Bruins. 
Shipp averaged 12.2 points and 3.2 rebounds during UCLA's run to its third consecutive Final Four. The Bruins lost to Memphis in the national semifinals. 
"After speaking with my family and with coach (Ben) Howland, I think I should test the NBA waters to get some feedback," Shipp said in a state­ment Sunday. "I feel like it really can't hurt me at this time. I want to go through the process this year, which will serve as a positive experience for me in my future development." 
Shipp is the fourth UCLA starter to enter the June draft, along with fresh-. man Kevin Love, sophomore Russell Westbrook and junior Luc Richard Mbah a Moute.

freshman J iII ian II urI e y both earned all-MIAA hon­ors. It marked the first time since 2005 that two Belles were named to the all-conference team. 
In Friday's first match, Saint Mary's lost 5-1 to Kalamazoo after beating the Hornets 6-3 on April 19, moving them into the consolation round. Saint Mary's only victories against Kalamazoo carne from their four singles wins. No. 1 singles Gebert won 7-5, 6-2, No. 2 Burley won 7-5 in the first set before not finishing the second, No. 3 Betsy Heed won 6-2, 5-0 in an unfin­ished second set, and No. 5 Lisa Rubino won 6-4, 1-0 before the second set was concluded. 
"Our first round match against Kalamazoo was dis­appointing," Gebert said. "Had we started stronger with our doubles, we could have turned the match around, but we did not play our best." 
As part of the consolation draw, Saint Mary's took on Tri-State Friday. The Belles won two of the three dou­bles, won three of the six singles, but three singles matches went unfinished. No. 1 doubles of Gebert­Hurley won 8-2 and No. 2 doubles pair of Reed­Rubino won 9-8 (8-6). 
In the singles against Tri­State, Saint Mary's won three matches, and three went unfinished. Gebert, Reed and Arnold all won full matches. Hurley's, Jessica Kosinski's and Rubino's matches were not finished. 
Saturday morning Saint Mary's took on Alma in a match for fifth place in the tournament, winning 5-2. The Belles won two of the three doubles, three of the 
singles. Two singles match­es went unfinished. No. 1 doubles Gebert and Hurley defeated Margaret Curtiss and Kelly Schwartzkopf 8­6; No. 2 Reed and Hubino won 8-3 over Laura McKendry and Lindsay Wagner; No. 3 Camp and Lee lost 9-7 to Kelsey Erwin and Emily Noss. 
In singles on Saturday Saint Mary's won three matches and had two unfinished. No. 1 Gebert defeated Schwartzkopf 6-1, 6-2, No. 2 Hurley beat McKendry 6-1, 6-2; No. 3 Heed defeated Wagner 6-0, 6-3. No. 4 Kosinski was defeated 7-6 (7-3). 6-2 by Heather Spratt. No. 5 Hubino's match against Curtiss and No. 6 Arnold's against Noss went unfin­ished. 

"We were able to rebound and win our next to match­es, however, to secure fifth place," Gebert said. "I think that we played with our hearts this weekend. We left it all on the courts, all the hard work, all the late night practices. As usual, our singles were stronger than our doubles play and took care of itself. enable us to take the lead in our last two matches." 
Saint Mary's ends its sea­son in fifth for the MIAA for the fourth conseeutive year. 
"I feel as though we've all matured in our own way through the course of the season," Gebert said. "We started a little slow in the beginning of the season, but definitely ended strong. I know that next season we will have more experience, and more confidence, so we can manage to get over the hump in our conference."

10) was hot for the Irish on the mound, going seven innings in the doubleheader without giving up an earned run. 
Game two of the double­header with the Friars began with Providence jumping out to a 2-0 lead early with two doubles off of freshman Jody Valdivia (8-7) in the first. Valdivia gave up four runs on five hits with five strikeouts and no walks in the loss. 
Valdivia gave up two more runs in the fourth to bring on Bargar, who pitched the final 3 and 1/3 innings with one unearned run on three hits. 
The Irish got back in the game on the force of an RBI triple from Fleury and an RBI single from Smith, but it would not be enough, as the Friars never relinquished the lead, winning 5-3. 
A lot of opportunities were left on the bases for the Irish -they left 11 runners on base. 
Sunday was senior day for the Irish, and they celebrated with a sweep of Connecticut (25-21, 11-7 Big East) in Melissa Cook Stadium. 
Game one against the Huskies was not for the faint of heart Irish fan, as the Irish were trailing by a score of 5-1 in the bottom of the second. 
The Irish came back quick­ly, however, evening the score at 5-5 with runs in each of the first three innings and a two­spot in the fourth. 
In the sixth inning with the score tied, freshman outfield­er Brianna Jorgensborg blast­ed the ball over the center­field fence to take the lead. 

The Irish scored twice more on Kohan's two-out double to right that scored senior sec­ond baseman Katie Laing and Smith after they had singled earlier to get on base. 
Bargar had a workman-like outing for the Irish, giving up five runs on seven hits with five strikeouts. 
The se.cond game was a dif­ferent story, as this time it was the Irish jumping out to a three-run lead after three innings. 
Smith and Fleury had RBI hits in the first and second innings respectively, before sophomore first baseman Christine Lux hit a solo home run in the bottom of the third. Lux went 2-for-3 with two runs and two RBis for the Irish. 

Bargar went the distance for the Irish again in the sec­ond game, allowing one earned run on four hits and tallying two strikeouts. Bargar added seven defensive assists in her 26th win of the season. 
The Irish will next be in action on Tuesday with an away game against Valparaiso. The game will begin at 5 p.m. before the Irish will complete their Big East schedule with double­headers against Pittsburgh and Syracuse next weekend.

forced fumbles, four fumble recoveries and six blocked kicks. 
Laws, who played defensive tackle under former Irish defen­sive coordinator Rick Minter's 4-3 scheme and defensive end for cur­rent defensive coordinator Corwin Brown's 3-4, said he is more suit­ed to playing tackle for the Eagles. 
"I looked at their roster a little bit, but I see there is a position for me to contribute. There is an 
opportunity for me to get in there and compete with some guys. I think it's a pretty good place for me," Laws said in a conference call with Philadelphia reporters. 
Laws rejoins former teammate Victor Abiamiri in Philadelphia. Philadelphia took Abiamiri, a defen­sive end, with the 57th overall pick in last year's draft. 
Laws said he is thrilled to be back with his friend and former teammate. 
"We're real close friends. We were roommates for over a year. I talk to him on a weekly basis almost," Laws said. "It's really exciting to go to the same team as hirtl." 
The next Irish player drafted was Zbikowski, who the Ravens took with the 86th overall pick during the third round of the draft. 
Zbikowski set the Notre Dame record for tackles by a defensive back with 300, eighth best in Irish history. He also had eight inter­ceptions, seven forced fumbles and four fumble recoveries in his career. Zbikowski also returned three punts, two interceptions and two fumbles for touchdowns. 
Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome said in a press confer­ence in Baltimore that he wanted to increase the defense's size and speed, and that Zbikowski was part of that. 
Newsome said Zbikowski is cur­rently slated as the backup safety

Relay team claims three-peat

The weekend for the Notre Dame men's track team can be summed up in one word: dominanen. With outstanding pnrf'ormances at the 99th annual Drake Hnlays and a strong showing at the llillsdale Belays. the Irish will have a good chance of earn­ing the top seed in next week's Big East conference meet.

That started a string of good looks for Notre Dame, as rising

Notrn Dame auditioned a pair of goalkeepers in the game, both of whom fared well. Rising sen­ior Andrew Quinn manned the net during the first half, while rising junior Philip Tuttle closed out the game with a solid per­formance in the second.

Irish athletes shine in weekend's relays 
By ALEX BARKER 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame sent a lim­ited number of athletes to both the Hillsdale and Drake Relays this week­end, but it walked away 
with  more  than  a  few  
impressive results.  
At the  Hillsdale  Helays  

meet in Hillsdale, Mieh., the Irish shined with a number of top finishes. 
In the 1500-meter run, senior Julie Opet grabbed the top spot with a time of 4:31.77. Marissa Treece, competing in her first meet since the World Cross Country champi­onships, rounded out a solid Irish performance in the event with an eighth­place finish.

At the Drake Helays, the Irish got quality perform­ances from of the two athletes that were sent to the highly competitive meet.

Irish win final home game 
By GRIFFIN DASSATTI 
Sports Writer 
In its last home game of the season, No. 7 Notre Dame cap­tured the GWLL regular season title with a 17-12 win over No. 13 Ohio State. 
The victory pu lied the Irish ( 11-2, 4-1 GWLL) into a three­way tie with the Buckeyes (9-4, 4-1 GWLLl and Denver for first place in the Great Western Lacrosse League, which the Irish won by virtue of a tiebreaker. The Irish came out !iring early, scoring three goals in tho first seven minutns, including one by junior mid­lielder Peter Christman just 51 seconds into the game. 
But the Buckeyes wouldn't go down easily. Following a time­out, the Buckeyes scornd four straight goals to take the lead for the first time in the game. 
Despite this impressive offen­sive display by the Buckeyes, Irish coach Kevin Corrigan said he remained confident in his team's ability to adjust to the pressure. 
"We knew it was going to be up-and-down and I wasn't con­cerned with the mentality of the team," he said. "A lot of times you would call time-out in that situation but I didn't call timeout because I wasn't wor­ried." 
After ending the first quarter down 5-4, Notre Dame showed its coach that his confidence was not in vain, going on a 4-2 run of their own to go into half­time up 8-7. 
Senior midfielder Michael Podgajny dominated during the run, scoring all three of his goals, two of which were assist­ed by sophomore midfielder Grant Krebs. 
The third quarter saw much of the same as the Irish extend­ed their lead to 12-9 on goals by sophomore midfielder Neal Hicks, junior attack Duncan Swezey, senior attack Alex Wharton and sophomore attack Matt Ciambella. Wharton, who leads the Irish in assists this season with 27, had four in the game. 

Notre Dame closed out the game thanks in part. to two goals by Krebs, who finished the game with three. Senior goaltender Joey Kemp made 12 saves. 
Having secured the No. 1 seed in next week's GWLL tour­nament, the Irish will take on the Quinnipiac, a team the Irish beat 16-6 on April 18. Corrigan said after the game that the team is happy with the win but determined to keep their focus. 
"Denver and Ohio State are very good teams, excellent teams, and I think that not hav­ing to play one of them in the first round and the other in the second round is terrific," Corrigan said. "We're glad that we'll only have to play one or the other, but our job now is to play Quinnipiac in the first round and take them down. We only have one game on the schedule right now, and we have to work hard this week to prepare for it."

NBA 
West's three vvith 5.4 seconds left lifts Cavs 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON King James lost his crown. 
All right, so it was his bur­gundy headband that went fly­ing when LeBron James took a shot to the noggin from DeShawn Stevenson, their simmering feud nearly boiling over. James kept his cool, allowing the 11agrant foul to spark him and his Cleveland Cavaliers. 
At game's end, James was just as collected, drawing waves of Washington Wizards defenders before dishing to Delonte West for a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 5.4 seconds left. That shot, along with James' 34 points and 12 rebounds, led the Cavaliers to a 100-97 victory on Sunday and a 3-1 lead in their best-of­seven Eastern Conference playoff series. 
"There's been some extracurricular activities going on outside and inside this series," James said, "but I've been able to stay focused." 
The Wizards were ahead by a point with three minutes left in the first half when James drove to the basket, and Stevenson came from behind and swiped a hand out, clip­ping the Cavs' star with what James said teammates told him was a closed fist before tumbling to the court. James kept his balance and stepped toward Stevenson, who got up and stepped toward James. 
They exchanged words, but that was it, before teammates stepped in between. 
"If we was on the park, · something definitely would have escalated," James said. "But, you know, I guess that's ­what they want to do. They want to hurt LeBron James this series. It ain't working." 
Stevenson's take? "That's how it goes," he said. "It was a big game for 
us." 
Now the Cavaliers, who eliminated the Wizards in each of the previous two post­seasons, have control, with Game 5 on Wednesday at Cleveland. 
James got help Sunday from more than just West, whose career playoff-high 21 points included five 3-pointers. Daniel Gibson made four 3s, and Ben Wallace had 12 rebounds -part of a remark­able 51-31 edge on the boards for Cleveland. 
One small sequence that epitomized things: At the end of the third quarter, Joe Smith's three-point play fol­lowed two offensive rebounds and gave the Cavaliers an 80­73 edge.

Notre Dame 8, St. John's 4 
Despite an unusually early l'irst pitch at noon Sunday, the Irish bats woke up in a hurry and chased Hed Storm starting pitcher Jared Yecker from the game before the end of the third inning. Notre Dame tagged Yecker for three runs, providing a sizable 
"They always say hitting is contagious so when you got guys at the top or the order and the bottom of the order hitting well, that's all you can ask for," Brezovsky said. "All­it takes is one guy to have a good at bat and get a hit and it starts rolling and all of a sudden you have 13 hits like we did today." 
When he stroked a single to right field in the fifth inning, Brezovsky extended his hit­ting streak to 21 games, whid1 is tied for the longest by a Notre Dame player since 1995. 
"I could care less about hit­ting streaks as long as we're winning games," Brezovsky said. "It feels good to get a win the day after losing two in a row." 
Brezovsky's hit put men on double into left-center to give Notre Dame a 5-0 advantage. 
The lead was more than enough for Maust, who retired the leadoff batter in seven of eight innings and ran his record to 5-l. 
"He's a bulldog. He goes out and gives it his all every out­ing and we have a lot of con­fidence in him," Brezovsky said. 
Barnes was one of four Irish hitters with multiple hits in the contest. 
Irish senior right-hander Tony Langford worked the final 1 and 113 innings and did not surrender a run, low­ering his ERA to 1.10.

tlw !warts of the Irish ( 11-7, 4­1 Big East). 
"It's gu t-wnmehing bncause when you put your heart out tlwn1, our sports psychologist says it's agony or ecstasy," Irish snnior captain Caitlin MeKinrwy said. "[ wouldn't want it any other way, hut right now. it's agony because wn put everything out there. That's thn hardest part. to walk off and know that you gavn nvnrything you ran. 
"It gives you peaen, but it also tears you inside bncausn you wish thn hall would have bounced your way, and espe­rially as a s1~nior, it's really dif­lkult." 
Thn Irish started with a bang, scoring the game's 11rst six goals to take a 6-0 lead with just under 15 minutes to play in the lirst half. Freshman Shaylyn Blaney scored thrne of her career-high five goals over 

· the strnteh. "It was just on thn fiPid, somothing comes over you," Blaney said. ''I've got a whole team in tlwre that I feel like I'm playing for. I would do any­thing for these girls, and that sort of inspires 11111 to just go." Georgetown finally got on the board with 14:25 to play in the first half'. but Notre Dame scornd twiee ovnr the next live minutes to grab an 8-1 lead. The tnams traded goals bnfore tlw momentum began to swing in Georgetown's favor, as the lloyas, down 9-2, began a 6-1 run that would cover the last fivn minutns of' the first half and the lirst live of the second. lloyas midfielder Ashby Kanstner scored all four of her goals over that stretch, trans­forming a 9-2 game with 7:31 to play in thn first half into a I 0-8 battle less than four min­ult~s into the second. 
"When they started getting 
possession off' the draw, then 
Kaestner. their best play1~r. 
stepped up and started killing 
us at the end of the lirst half," 
Irish coach Tracy Coyne said. 
"I think we tried to take her 
out of the mix and facn-guard 
her off the draw, I mean we 
wen1 definitely trying things, 
but they're a good team. We're 
not two top-1 0 teams for no 
rnason." 

Georgetown would tie the game at 11-11 on Allie llubschmann's third goal of the game at 18:51 and take a 13­12 lnad. their lirst of the con­test. with just over four min­utes to play. McKinney's third goal tied it at 13-13 with 1:17 to go, and the game entered overtime after the lloyas, stalling for the linal shot, were unable to convert. 
Eight seconds into the first of two three-minute, non-sudden death overtimes, sophomore attack Gina Scioscia gave the Irish a 14-13 lead off an assist from McKinney. But Georgetown's Jordy Kirr tied it right baek up 15 seconds later on an unassisted goal. 
Both teams were held score­less over the second non-sud­den death overtime and the first or the two sudden death periods, though both had sev­eral chances to put the game away. 
"We had opportunities to win the game in regulation, and we had our chances," Coyne said. "We just didn't capitalize, and when you get to sudden death, it's a funny bounee that's going to end up winning it -it is what it is, but it's unfortunate that we're on the losing end." 
Notre Dame's best chance came when McKinney, running down the field after a draw, had her bid for the game-win­ner stuffed by Georgetown goalie Caitlin Formby. With the ball on the ground just in front of the net, McKinney opted to try to !lick the ball in with her 
stick, as she had done successc 
fully earlier in the contest, 
instead of picking it up and 
shooting normally. 
"I got too excited and I 
should've just picked it up and 
put it in," McKinney said. 
I was back and forth between 
flicking it and picking it up, 
and I should've had more con­
fidence and composure. It 
could've changed the game but 
I guess that's how it goes 
sometimes." 
The Iloyas dominated the 
possession in sudden death, 
and even when the Irish man­
aged to pry the ball loose, they 
were plagued by untimely 
turnovers, including two in the 
deeisive overtime period. 
"I want the team to play to 
win, so I don't really question 
some of the decisions they 
were making because I want 
them to go with their gut," 
Coyne said. "If they think they 
can take it and make some­
thing happen, I don't want to 
take that away from them by 
forcing them into something. 
We have our set plays, but at 
the end of the day, you want 
the players out there pulling 
the trigger and playing to win. 
Maybe we lived and died by it." 
The Irish players were visibly 
distraught by the. loss, both on 
the field and in the locker 
room following the game. But 
they will have to regroup for 
their final regular season 
game, at home against Cornell 
on May 3, in order to have any 
chance at an at-large bid into 
the NCAA tournament. 
"There aren't really words that are going to give them consolation right now," Coyne -said. "They wanted to be in the championship game, and we wanted to be representing Notre Dame and winning our first Big East title. It's a really difficult position we're in right 
now."

The Irish sent their seniors

The wenkflnd began with a 10-1 drubbing of Providenee (24-20-2, R-X Big East) on Saturday, highlighted by sophomore outfielder Ashl1~y Ellis's fourth-inning grand slam. The slam, which was I:llis's snvnnth home run on this season, was the first
