Investigators travel to Minn. for Sharon case 
By TERESA FRALISH Assistant News Editor 
An investigator from Notre Dame Security Police met Wednesday in Minneapolis, Minn. with police from other areas in 
t h e Midwest where male college stu­dents have disap­peared, said Rex Hakow, 

director of Chad Sharon N o t r e Dame Security and Police. 
NDSP attended the meeting to discuss the Dec. 12 disappear­ance of freshman Chad Sharon with other investigators. 
Shortly afler the investigation into Sharon's disappearance began, NDSP contacted the FBI to investigate possible links between Sharon's case and the disappearances uf three other male college students who had been drinking and disappeared in areas near a body of water, said Rakow. 
"We asked the FBI to look into it," he said. "They didn't feel that there were any [con­nectionsJ." 
The main purpose of tho meeting was not to discuss pos­sible further links between the cases of missing male students but rather to cnmpare notes on how the different police depart­mcnts were conducting their investigations. 
"We heard this meeting was going on [and] we asked if we could attend," said Rakow. 
The three other cases involve missing students from the University of Minnesota, the University of Wisconsin-Eau

Senators call emergency meeting 
By MEGHANNE DOWNES Associare News Editor 
Eight senators submitted a petition Friday to Trip Foley, student body vice president, calling for an emergency meeting to discuss tho position of Libby Bishop, student body president, regarding in-hall dances in her report to the Board of Trustees on Thursday. 
This petition followed a lengthy debate at Wednesday's Senate meeting regarding the failed resolution to attach a letter to Bishop's report asking for in-hall dances to be reinstated. 
Section II Article II of the Student Union Constitution states that a minimum of five senators is needed to call an emergency meeting. 
The petition said the reason for the meeting was "to pre­sent a unified student voice on the issue of reinstating the

The recent decision by Saint Mary's Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership (CWIL) to sponsor four stu­dents to attend a pro-choice conference has left many on the Saint Mary's campus con­fused, although Saint Mary's does not stand behind the decision, said Melanie Engler. a spokeswoman for the College.

Sponsoring the trip to the conference "doesn't fit into the Catholic identity of the College," she said. "Any event that the Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership spon­sors should fit into the Catholic identity of Saint Mary's. I don't think the intention of the Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership was negative LandJ I'm sure the intention was to expose stu­dents to Washington D.C.; it was just the wrong conference to choose." 
Meredith Sarkees, director of CWIL, did not return Observer phone calls seeking comment. 
"The program itself wa:, stu­dent leadership. The purpose was to show students how to become involved in lobbying and leadership," Sarkees told the Observer last week. 
" The College's position is that this was a regrettable decision to fund support for this workshop," said Pat White, vice president and dean of faulty for the College. 
White also added that the College and the CWIL would continue to review the Center's grant approval procedures in the coming weeks.

Editor

than normal donni­tories found at many other national col­
leges. 

Does anyone see a problem with this? 
Many university officials do, comment­ing that a greater emphasis on single housing will give students one more rea­son to hole themselves up in their room. With a greater importance on privacy, some students may never need to share their personal space or possessions with a roommate. Such arrangements often divorce students from the real world because they never have to learn the art of compromise, negotiation, or simple interaction they will ultimately encounter with co-workers, bosses or spouses. 
Don't get me wrong, I respect the wish­es of many upperclassmen that have dealt with the negative aspects of having a roommate and have decided against such living arrangements, but I find that pro­viding single housing for demanding freshman would violate many ofthe lessons that college is supposed to teach. 
As important as the academic realm of college is, there are other areas in which students should experience growth and maturity. Shared experiences such as housing provide students the opportunity to interact with their peers in ways that living alone does not. 
The housing system at Notre Dame eliminates many barriers that would impede such necessary social maturity. Many students choose to live in a dorm for all four years because they so highly value the dorm life -one that does not allow students to live in a class-discrimi­nated dorm but rather ensures that all four classes will come in contact with one another. Since Notre Dame does not have fraternities or sororities, the dorm is meant to provide many ofthe same social benefits without the potential for danger­ous and even deadly rush practices. Donn spirit unites many Notre Dame under­graduates who would seem to have very little in common other than a similarly colored sock-cap or sweatshirt that proudly announces their dorm allegiance. Furthermore, the abundance ordoubles, triples, quads and even quints requires undergraduates to avoid isolation and instead to interact with the person or peo­ple they live with. 
living with a roommate means learning to compromise and having to live with idiosyncrasies and oddities you may never have imagined. such as your roommates' penchant for obnoxious country music or bizarre sleeping patterns. You may not always like your roommate. He or she may not be your best friend. Or he or she may. Neverthel~. the experience is an important one and should not be bypassed by increasingly demanding stu­dents who refuse to compro~e and are accustomed to getting their way.

Saint Mary's students protest Keenan Revue 
By MEGAN O'NEIL 
News Writer 
Several Saint Mary's students handed out llyers of protest prior to the Keenan Hevue this past weekend. The rlyer and its authors criticized the program for utilizing "hatcf'ul stereotypes" in many of ilc; skits. 
The Keenan Revue, a comedic variety show put on annually by the residents of Notre Dame's Keenan llall, well known for its vulgar and sexual satire. The show's producers and participants embrace this image. However, in recent years the show has been increasingly criticized for what some call its overly racist and sex­ist content. Some Saint Mary's stu­den ts have been particularly angered at the inclusion of numer­ous jokes about the Saint Mary's student body. 
"I don't understand why if we arc truly a Christian community there are such negative stereo­types on campus," saic.l Jessica Bland, one of the flyer's authors. "It is truly hateful." 
The distributed flyers included the definitions of words such as "stereotype." "misogyny," and "intolerance." On the right side of the sheet in bold type was the question "Still Laughing?" 
One specific Revue comment that the flyer cited was a skit's ref­erence to 
Saint Mary's patron saint as 
"Saint Mary Magdalene, patron saint of whores." The flyer called the reference "slanderous" and "degrading," and said ''this implies that the College communi­ty is composed of such persons." 
The Oyer also noted the fact that Keenan Hall was voted the best residence hall of the year. Keenan, as a result of this honor, has the responsibility "to uphold a stan­dard of leadership, respecting all community members." the flyer said. 
"I want to challenge Keenan residents. and all members of Notre Dame, Saint Mary's 
and Holy Cross College to ask hard questions about how we're living up to the tradition of 'God, Country. Not re Dame,' and what that means to us as Americans and Christians," Bland said. 
Not all Saint Mary 's students, however. were so critical of the program, and felt that all the jokes were in good fun. 
"The tickets arc free and every­one knows what goes on," said Saint Mary's sophomore Kelly Doherty. "If you don't want to hear yourself get made fun of, don't go." 
'They made fun of Notre Dame girls more than the Saint Mary's girls," added sophomore Kelsey Schatz "Why shouldn't we be able to take some ofit?"

Scientists study heinophilia 
By MELISSA LOU 
News Writer 

Researchers from Notre Dame's Keck Center for Tra.nsgene Research have been investigating cellular transplan­tation as a possible cure for hemophilia, said Elliot Rosen, associate director of the center. 
The Center has been studying the genes involved in dissolving and forming blood clots. In order to perform this research, the Center has used mice with genetic modifications that affect this process. 
"One of the main challenges we faced wa'l that a lot of these animals died early on tufter their birth] so we couldn't studv them," said Rosen. · 
A possible solution came in 1999, when Rosen attended a scientific meeting, where he learned about an in-utero tech­nique for transplanting blood cells. 
By the summer of 2001, tho concept of using in-utero trans­plantation techniques to pro­long the lives of the genetically modified mice had gained momentum. Given the possible medical impact of this research today, the initial results of this innovative research were fea­tured in the inaugural run of the Journal of Thrombosis and Homeostasis. 
Rosen discussed the social dimensions of the research by expanding upon the relation­ship between hemophilia in humans and the condition pre­sent in the mice. Hemophilia is caused by a missing or defective protein known as factor VII or 
IXI. The mice Rosen works with present a rare and deadly form of hemophilia because of their lack of a protein necessary for proper blood coagulation known as Factor X. Because of this, many of the mice exhibit massive hemorrhaging upon birth and die shortly after. 
The strategy Rosen and his team developed involves taking cells from healthy mice embryos and transplanting them to the livers of sick mice. 
"Currently, the donors have a gene that allows us to track the cells in the recipients by adding X-gal to the cell<;, turning them blue," Rosen said. 
If the cells from the donor embryos survive and colonize in the liver of the recipient, they could make enough of the Factor X to allow the mice to survive. 
Rosen explained several posi­tive factors about the current research. 
"Because the defective genes that cause hemophilia are known, it is possible to detect the disease before the child is born by genetic screening of a fetus in utero. Genetic screening would be focused on potential carriers eliminating the need for an impractical general screening of all unborn chil­dren," said Rosen. 
The strategy he and his researchers developed trans­plants cells in utero so that the disease could be cured before it develops. 

The second advantage of this strategy is rnlated to current cures for hemophilia. 
"Currently, if a person mani­fests the disease, you can inject the missing protein and manage the illness [and] sometimes 15 to 20 percent of the patient's immune systems begin to rec­ognize the protein as alien to the body and build antibodies to inhibit the injected factors," said Rosen. "We are injecting the cells before the immune system forms. thus our hypothesis, which we still have to prove, is that the immune system will recognize these cells as 'self and will not develop antibodies inhibiting the therapeutic pro­teins." 
In order to use the strategy in humans, however, the team needs to increase the cfiiciency of the procedure and find a more convenient source of' donor cells than isolating them from another embryo. Additionally, the team must prove that tl1e recipients do not reject the donor cells as alien. explained Rosen. 
At present, the research team has successfully increased the life expectancy of 50 percent of the mice in the experiments. The next series of experiments are designed to test if the mice are developing the antibodies that would inhibit the curative factors, said Hosen.

Student body vice-president Trip Foley attended the forum to offer support from student government for international students. Foley said most of the students present were freshmen and seemed to be happy with University ser­vices. but have found it diffi­cult at times to learn about all of the opportunities that are available. 
"A lot of their concerns were not much different from those of any group of students," said Foley.

Kohli added that many international stu­dents do not know about all the opportunities available to them. 
Kohli said an international student representative on stu­dent government or the CLC would be of immense help to international undergraduates. "At least international stu­dents would have a voice," said Kohli.

organizers for Disabilities Week have planned for a wheel chair rugby team to come to the College to demonstrate their skills. On Thursday, some Saint Mary's students will use wheelchairs and crutches to travel around campus in an attempt to discover what it is like to be disabled and to get around campus. 
"On a scale of one to 10 I would rank Saint Mary's as a five for physical handicap accessibility," Mahoney said. 
Improving the accessibili­ty of campus is a concern for both students and visi­tors, explained Mahoney. 
"An admissions counselor told me of a tour she gave to a student who had a grandmother in a wheel­chair," Mahoney said. "They had to enter all of the unat­tractive parts of campus so that the grandmother could get in and eventually they had to leave her behind." 
Bruder said she hopes this week will increase aware­ness for accessibility. 
"Since the 1990 Disabilities Act, the campus has done more for mental disabilities, but the campus is working at a pace that will show change and improvements for physical handicaps as well," she said.

Americans mourn Columbia disaster 
Assodated Press 
United again in sorrow, Americans mourned the deaths of the space shuttle astronauts at church services Sunday, while investigators pursued early clues about what went wrong. Search crews -some on horseback. some in helicopters -tracked charred debris across Texas and Louisiana. 
"I don't know that we'll ever find all these pieces." said Sheriff Thomas Kerss, overseeing the hunt for hundreds. possibly thou­sands, of bits of wreckage strewn over Nacogdoches County after the shuttle burst apart above Texas. 
At churches across America, at the Johnson Space Center in IIouston, at a U.S. Army base in Afghanistan, even in the Iraq National Assembly, the loss of the seven Columbia astronauts gave rise to grief and rel1ection. 
"A lot of things occur, we just wonder why and how," said Jim Andreini, 58, attending a service at Grace Brethren Church in Westerville, Ohio. "We like to think it's all part of the plan. Sometimes, it's hard to under­stand." 
Officials said the collected debris would be trucked to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana for analysis by engi­neering experts. Their findings will be part of a NASA investiga­tion aimed at discovering why the shuttle disintegrated Saturday, just moments from its scheduled landing in Florida. 
The shuttle program manager, Ron Dittemore, said engineers have detected a sudden, sharp rise of temperature on the fuse­lage -60 degrees in five minutes -moments before the craft broke apart. 
That was followed by signs of increa::,erl drag that caused the shuttle's computerized control system to try to adjust the flight pattern, he said. 
Stressing the evidence was pre­liminary, Dittemore told a news conference it was possible there had been damage to or a loss of thermal tiles that protect the shut­tle from burning up during re­entry into the Earth's atmos­phere. 
NASA chief Sean O'Keefe said investigators would examine whether damage was caused by insulation from a fuel tank during Columbia's Jan. 16 ascent. 
A special federal commission also will conduct an investigation, with its emphasis on policy mat­ters affecting the future of the U.S. space program. Harold Gehman Jr., the retired Navy admiral who helped lead the Pentagon's inquiry into the USS Cole bomb­ing, ~ill head that commission.

ITALY 
Pakistanis deny involvement in terrorism case 
Associated Press 
ROME 
The 28 Pakistanis arrested in a raid that turned up explosives and maps of a NATO base either have denied any links to ter­rorism or rel'used to answer questions during interrogations, lawyers said Sunday. 
After an all-day hearing, a judge ruled Sunday that the suspects should remain jailed while the investigation continues, lawyer Gennaro Razzino said in a tele­phone conversation from Naples, where the Pakistanis were jailed. 
Razzino said all 10 of his clients invoked their right not to answer questions during the first hearing in the case, which began Thursday when police raided a Naples house during a crackdown on illegal immigration. 
Another lawyer, Giovanna Cacciapuoti, told Italian state television that those who did answer questions denied the charges. 
"They denied having any knowledge about this explosives material and denied having any connections with, or any knowledge, about fundamentalist circles or terrorist circles," Cacciapuoti said. 
No future hearing dates were set, Razzino said. During Thursday's raid, police said they 
found a circled newspaper photo of Britain's military chief as well as a few pages of a map, ripped from the directory of city streets that all local telephone sub­scribers receive, of the area of Bagnoli, a suburb that is home to a NATO base. 
Italian media Sunday reported that sub­sequent searches of the apartment turned up other maps, including of tourist spots like a Naples museum, the coastal town of Sorrento, the spa island of Ischia, and Ercolano, site of the ancient Roman city Herculaneum. 
But a police officer familiar with the probe and speaking on condition of anonymity said only the map of the NATO base area was found in the raid. 
Razzino, however, said prosecutors pre­senting evidence at Sunday's hearing pro­duced a highway map of the Campania region, which includes Naples, that they said was found in a subsequent search of the apartment. The lawyer said no partic­ular targets were marked on the map but that places like Pompeii and Positano, two top tourist draws, were circled. 
A police official on Saturday confirmed reports that a Jan. 25 newspaper in the house had a photograph of British Adm. Sir Michael Boyce, who was expected to visit Naples next month, but declined to say if the admiral was a target.

Israeli astronaut named national hero 
In a Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon declared astronaut llan Hamon a national hero. And across the country, flags flew at half-staff as the nation mourned its latest loss. After 28 months of daily violence with the Palestinians, a depressed economy and the threat of being drawn into a war with Iraq, Israelis had been celebrating Ramon's journey as a testament to their achievements. 
Venezuelans petition for Chavez's ouster President Hugo Chavez declared victory Sunday after his opponents agreed to ease a two-month national strike, but thousands of Venezuelans still lined up for a petition drive seeking his ouster. Strike organizers said Friday they would ease the work stoppage this week to protect businesses from bankruptcy. However, the strike will continue in the vital oil industry, where production was cut from 3 million barrels a day to 150,000.

Bush to send deficit-boosting budget 
President Bush will send Congress a $2.23 trillion spending plan Monday featuring new tax cuts to boost the economy, a conservative tilt to major social programs and record deficits for the next two years -shortfalls that Democrats blame on Bush's tax cuts. White House budget officials said Sunday the president's tax and spending blueprint will roll out as scheduled despite Saturday's space shuttle disaster. 
Fund seeks to aid Columbia survivors 
A fund that raised $1 million to assist the children of the Challenger disaster in 1986 will launch an effort to do the same for survivors of the Columbia crash. With non-profit status and volunteer administrators, the Space Shuttle Children's Trust Fund was established with the support of NASA to provide for the health, education and related sup­port of the Challenger survivors. 

Poll: Bush rallying support on Iraq war 
President Bush has reversed the slide in public sup­port for a possible war with Iraq, with 66 percent saying they support military action against Iraq in an ABC-Washington Post poll released Saturday. That's up from 57 percent who felt that way in mid­January in this poll. Significantly, 51 percent said they support military action even if the United Nations is opposed, up from 37 percent in mid­December. 


American secondhand smoke levels down 
Americans have lower levels of lead and second­hand-smoke byproducts in their bodies than they did a decade ago, according to a government study. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed the decline to such things as stricter reg­ulations on harmful chemicals, bans on smoking in the workplace, and programs to reduce children's exposure to lead paint.

"Knowledge of this trip was not widespread," College spokeswoman Engler said. "Many, if not most. did not know about it until they read about it in The Observer." 
Bishop John D'Arcy, bishop of the Fort Wayne-South Bend diocese, which includes Saint Mary's, further added, "I think that at any institution of higher learning the issues of the day should be discussed but one expects [at Saint Mary's] that the Catholic position should be presented. Based on the infor­mation I have received [from The Observer]. it is disturbing and in opposition [to) the Catholic Church and the truths it teaches," D'Arcy said. 
The bishop also questioned the explanation that atten­dance at the conference could be justified on the grounds of developing leadership skills. 
"They're learning leadership and must be passed by a two­thirds vote. The president must sign it within a week for it to be adopted. 

Bishop said during the debate of the resolution at Wednesday's meeting that the letter asking for the reinstatement of in-hall dances would have been super­fluous and detracted from her report. This influenced some senators to vote against the let­ter. Bishop initially supported the letter, but said she changed her mind after reading drafts of it. Bishop said after the meeting that she would have welcomed and referenced the letter in her report had it been addressed to her. 
Kevin Conley, chair of the Residence Life committee that presented the letter, said after the meeting he intended to dis­cuss the letter and who to address it to at Monday's Residence Llfc committee meet­ing. Conley, who signed the peti­tion for the emergency meeting. said he thought it was important that student opinion is voiced and that he still intends to dis­cuss the status of the letter at Monday's Residence Life com mittee meeting.

Childrens' prescriptions vary 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO 

Prescription rates for Ritalin and similar attention deficit disorder drugs -.both widely praised and widely maligned ­vary dramatically across the nation, new research indicates. 
While the prevalence of the disorder is not thought to vary greatly by region, a study being released Monday found that treatment rates ranged from 
1.6 percent of children's pre­scriptions examined in Washington, D.C., to 6.5 per­cent of children's prescriptions in Louisiana. Significantly high­er rates were found in the South and Midwest than in the West. 
Overall, about 4 percent of prescriptions examined for children ages 5 to 14 in 1999 were for stimulants including Ritalin. 
The study, appearing in February's issue of Pediatrics, was done by researchers at Express Scripts Inc., a Missouri-based pharmacy ben­efits management company. The researchers reviewed a nationally representative sam­ple of company prescription claims for 178,800 children throughout 1999. The claims were for all types of medica­tion. 
Lead researcher Emily Cox and colleagues said that while they did not determine if high­er prescription rates repre­sented overuse or if lower rates represented underuse, "both may be occurring." 
The variations should be examined "to reduce the risk to children from unnecessary drug therapy as well as the negative health and emotional consequences to children with untreated medical conditions," the researchers said. 
Critics of excessive use of such drugs, including some doctors, have worried that the drugs sometimes are promoted by schools and others as a "quick fix" without other appropriate treatment. 
Advertising of the drugs, physician practice styles, par­ents' and teachers' values and anti-Ritalin campaigns may have contributed to the varying drug use rates, the researchers said. 
Methylphenidate, the drug more widely known by the brand name Ritalin, was the most common stimulant pre­scribed. Others were dexedrine and other amphetamines. 
Stimulant use was found to be more prevalent among white children and those from higher-income families. Cox said the higher rates likely are representative of the nation's commercially insured popula­tion. The study did not look at Medicaid claims. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics' guidelines for treat­ing attention deficit hyperactiv­ity disorder cite data suggest­ing the disorder affects 4 per­cent to 12 percent of school­age children, or as many as 3.8 million youngsters, most of them boys.

IN BRIEF 
Wall Street suffers heavy losses 
Wall Street suffered its third straight weekly decline, a slide not seen in nearly four months. 
Investors took some chances on blue chip stocks Friday, picking up bargains after the Dow Jones industrials' nearly 900 point drop over the past two weeks. But the buying wasn't enough to save heavy losses for the month. 
Analysts attributed the day's gains to investors seeking lower-priced stocks rather than improving sentiment about the market or the economy, especially since the news on both fronts was mixed Friday. The blue chip advance came despite investors' ongoing con­cerns that a war with Iraq would derail what's already been feeble economic progress. 

EBay deletes 'shuttle debris' listings

"While AOL is still the No. 1 online service in terms of reach and time spent onlinc, it is losing relevance steadily," said Dylan Brooks, an independent analyst of Internet service providers. 


Boeing offers help with probe 
. Aerospace firm pledges support for Columbia investigation 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO 
Boeing Co., NASA's largest space contractor, said it would do what it could to help officials deter mine what caused Saturday's tragedy aboard the space shuttle Columbia. 
Chicago-based Boeing generates about $2 billion, or about 4 percent of its business. from its work on NASA's manned space operations. which includes the space shuttle and the internalional space station programs. 
"We are doing everything possible to support NASA and the United Space Alliance in their investiga­tion of [the] tragedy," the company said on its Web site. 
A Boeing spokeswoman declined to comment on what effect the shuttle dis­aster might have on the company. 
Columbia was built by Rockwell International, but Rockwell turned its shuttle program over to Boeing in the mid-l990s. 
One analyst said it was too early to assess what effect Saturday's tragedy might have on Boeing's business because so little is known about what hap­pened. 
"They probably will stand do\\-'Il until they know what the problem is, but will continue with the program ... so you probably will not see an enormous financial impact," said Cai Von Rumohr. an aerospace ana­lyst with SG Cowan Securities Inc. in Boston.

BellSouth gets court order to keep exec 
Associated Press 

ATLANTA 
A judge has granted BellSouth Corp. a temporary restraining order preventing its vice chairman, Gary Forsee, from accepting an offer to be chairman and chief executive of Sprint Corp 
A Fulton County Superior Court judge issued the order over the weekend after the company filed the request late Friday, BellSouth spokesman Jeff Battcher said Sunday. 
Forsee, who joined BellSouth in 1999. has a noncompete clause in his contract that prevents him from taking a job with a competitor of the Atlanta-based regional phone company. Sprint and BellSouth both sell long-distance irnrvice in nine Southeastern states and compete nationally for wireless customers. 
BellSouth went to court Friday after Forsee, 52, told the company he wanted to take the Sprint posi­tion, replacing William Esrey, a person familiar with the situation said. Forsee, who was a Sprint executive for nine years, oversees lfollSouth's domestic operations. 
Forsee did not immediately return a message left Sunday at his Atlanta home. Sprint spokesman Bill White declined to comment Sunday. 
BellSouth is trying to prevent Forsee from divulging "intellectual capital," including company pricing plans and merger and acquisition information, to a competitor like Sprint. Forsee also is chairman of Cingular Wireless, BellSouth's joint venture with SBC Communications Inc. 
"BellSouth attorneys and Sprint attorneys are in discussions about this matter." Battcher said. 
Sprint, based in Overland Park, Kan., has repeatedly declined to comment on the possibility of Forsee joining the company. 
Sprint is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. and analysts believe the company will discuss the issue then. 
Esrey's departure has been expected since Sprint announced in November that he was undergoing chemotherapy treatment after being diagnosed with lymphoma. But analysts had expected chief operating officer Honald LcMay to be his successor. 
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that LeMay also is expect­ed to leave the company. Sprint declined to comment. 
Esrey, 63, was elected chief exec­utive officer of Sprint in 1985 and chairman in 1990. LcMay, who joined Sprint in 1985, was appoint­ed president and chief operating officer in February 1996. 
Sprint is the nation's third largest long-distance provider and fourth­largest wireless provider. BellSouth is the dominant local phone provider in the South, serving 44 million customers.

GERMANY 




Schroeder's party crushed in vote 
Associa tcd Press 
BERLIN 

Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's party suffered a crushing defeat in two German state elections Sunday, reflecting a loss of confidence in his govern ment's economic course despite broad support for his anti-war stand on Iraq. 
In final results, the Christian Democrats grabbed 48 percent of the vote in represented. 
Though the defeat turned heavily on dissatisfaction with tax hikes and Germany's grim economic picture, it also demonstrated the limits of the strident anti-war stance that helped Schroeder narrowly win re-election in September.

At least 40 perish in Nigerian bank blast 
Associated Press 
LAGOS 
A powerful explosion tore apart a bank and dozens of apartments above it Sunday in Nigeria's crowded com­mercial capital, killing at feast 40 people and trap ping many others, relief workers said. 
Police were investigating a range of motives including that the blast was part of a bank robbery plot. Looting and bloody fights broke out as hundreds of young men grabbed fistfuls of cash from the leveled bank and battled over them. 
In the chaos, trapped vic­tims cried for rnscue and onlookers wailed as res­cuers retrieved bloody. bro­ken bodies. 
The Red Cross said searchers had recovered more than 30 dead and 32 injured. Ten of the wounded died later at Lagos General Hospital, hospital workers said. 
Many more victims were believed caught in the rub­ble. and the death toll could rise, said Emmanuel Ijewere. president of the Nigeria Red Cross. 
The blast occurred about 
12:30 p.m. on Lagos Island. a crowded high-rise district of banks and other busi­nesses packed side-by-side with poor, densely populat­ed residential blocks. 
The four-story bank build­ing collapsed, bringing three floors of apartments crashing down on the ground floor Prudent Bank. Fires flared briefly after the blast, which could be heard for miles and sent a tower of smoke in to the sky. 
Two adjoining buildings were heavily damaged, and buildings for blocks around had shattered windows and other marks of the explo­sion. 
Residents said some vic­tims had been blocks away from the bank building. 
"My uncle was in the bal­cony of our house talking with a friend and the force of the explosion threw them down," resident Remi Oyebanji said. "They're both dead." 
An Associated Press reporter saw 10 crushed bodies. One covered corpse appeared to be that of a child. 
Resident Omololu Kassim. who was helping carry the victims, said he saw 40 dead and as many inj urcd. Local radio put the toll at 50 or more. The blast came as many were at church. pre venting an even higher death toll. 
Hundreds of police sur­rounded the damaged neighborhood, dispersing the looters and forcing back thousands of onlookers. Cranes and other heavy equipment moved in to lift up the heavy concrete slabs and other debris. 
Ambulance drivers fought to navigate narrow streets and push through the throngs to get to victims. 
Survivors bundled togeth­er what possessions they could and set off in search of safe housing. 
"My husband is dead." one middle-aged woman cried. carrying a bundle on her head and dragging a lit­tle boy behind. 
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo flew in from the capital of Abuja to visit the blast site. Obasanjo, accompanied by Lagos state Gov. Bola Tinubu, had no comment.

When I got the news that my little brother had been admitted into Notre Dame's auspicious graduating class of 2007. I immediately thought, "Go Irish." He is a decent dude with out­standing analytical skills and thick

hair, and we really could use more like him. I thought 
Notre Bum

of the benefits, the symbiosis if you will, that would follow from the two of us sharing this small campus. I thought of the costs. 
First, and l do mean foremost, he would be tapped into a life of seduc­tive indulgence and unparalleled cool­ness. Mine. With connections to the raging off-campus party scene, he'd instantly be the coolest kid in 3B. 
Not like I'd mind either. I remember those first few days of freshman year when we'd march single file toward Turtle Creek, following the kid who claimed he had a big brother who lived there. If I could just give him the honor of being "that" kid, my life would be complete. 
In return I could hit up his thrilling section karaoke parties. We could jam to some Ashanti and duet on Foolish, then skirt over to Sbarro for a slice, preferably stuffed. Freshman love that crap. I love that crap. 
Of course it wouldn't be all grins, we'd have to share a car and what limited sum of women dig on us thick­haired math wizards. 
Yes, his first year would be unforget­table. However. when reality hits sophomore year. he'll find himself in the back row of 101 DeBartolo watch­ing the Friday night SUB selection. People will still be searching for the next Boat Club, the next beer, while they lament their late birthday. They'll still be waiting for football season when they can steal sips of Icehouse from a Styrofoam cup. 
That's our problem though. We are always waiting. Waiting until 1 a.m. to go out, in expectations of the next buzz kill. Waiting for something to happen. Despite what many might think, that something is not Panera Bread Company. If anything can illu­minate the severity of the South Bend condition, it's Panera. 
Walking back from class on Thursday, I saw three girls running frantically toward the Joyce Center parking lot. Concluding that they must be running from NDSP, I sprinted to catch up. "Panera!" they screamed. Apparently, they were just hoping to snatch the first tasty morsel of Pumpernickel at Panera before the dinner rush set in. Panera, man. Not Pantera, Panera. 
There is no easy answer here. Theme parties are a start, but they alone cannot subvert this Panera mad­ness. We have to get creative with this one. Joe, a quick learner from Alumni, has grown fond of tennis matches at the Pavilion with the incentive of pro­motional giveaways. Windsor is anoth­er option, or beanbag toss. 
l don't know. What I do know is that we have 8,000 individuals at this uni­versity, all with different tastes, hob­bies and concepts of fun. Sadly, we all end up doing the same thing. We settle for overcrowded bars and under-sup­plied house parties. We show up at the architecture party though we can't draw. We go to the boxing house though we can't box. We get in the cab and ask the cab driver, "What's hot tonight baby'? Take us there." Then we complain that there's nothing to do. 
I used to blame it on the Notre Dame breed. Legacies like myself show up thinking it's going to be like it was in '75, like Dad would always talk about. We think of college as four football seasons connected by a negligible spring. Once we get here we realize those springs are far from negligible, but in fact are sobering and long. We realize that if we don't get up and do something, they'll seem even longer. That's why us legacies are so stinking crazy. 
So we go to the spots Dad used to talk about, the ones that are still standing and haven't lost their permit, and we get our laughs. We soon understand that this is still the same place we heard about in all those sto­ries, minus a couple of bars and plus a couple of rules. 
It's easy to wander through here and think that we missed out, that we came a few decades too late. It's easy to forget why we came here. I didn't come for the business program or the diversity. I came for the tradition, the football, the beer and because it was the best school I got into. 
I came. So did all of you, and so will my brother. He can wait until he hears from Georgetown, but he heard the same stories I did and will be here next fall. 
So go to Windsor if you need to and enjoy the casinos. Mix things up and go drinking on Tuesday instead of Friday. Just don't complain that there's nothing to do in South Bend. I hate that. 
Pantera man.

Bubble
On Christmas morning, I waited patiently with my siblings before we all opened our stock­ings. Once again, mine was full of little trinkets my father had carefulJy picked out and wrapped. 
I went out to a movie with my sister, and my father footed the bill. I also noticed he had filled my gas tank. 
At home in Kentucky, I was 23 going on 18. 
However, reality quickly slapped me in the face as I headed back to Oklahoma City on Jan. 4. I realized I once again had to plan for my daily rou­tine of facing high school seniors, hop­ing the lesson I had planned for the day would be educational and somewhat entertaining. 
However. it's not the routine. the long hours or the sometimes annoying stu­dents that slapped me in the face. 
In Oklahoma City, I am not "Laura." I'm "Ms. Rompf." 
I cannot act as if I'm 23. 
I cannot laugh at immature jokes my students make. Jokes I myself would have cracked whHe at home with my lit­tle brother. 
I cannot stop in the middle of lecture because I'm bored of giving notes. and my students are tired of taking them. There is material to cover, and lam the one responsible to make sure that these students learn or at least are exposed to that material. 
Perhaps the most extreme example I can give occurred at the beginning of the semester. One of my students warned me that she has epilepsy. This means at any moment she could have a seizure, and she wanted me to be informed. 
Here's where "Ms. Rompf' comes into play. 
If she has a seizure in my classroom, there would be no adult figure to turn to. No one to ask what to do, or how to control the situation. 
A classroom full of 25 18-year-olds would be looking to me for an answer. To 25 18-year olds, I would be the adult figure. 
Quite a change from the little girl whose dad buys her gas and mom wakes her up in the morning. 
Perhaps everyone faces this quick transformation after graduating from 
college. 
Perhaps we go quickly from seniors that frequented Corby's on Tuesdays, to adults that can barely stay up past 11 
p.m. on weeknights. 
Perhaps we all long for the day when our idea of responsibility was going to class -even if we weren't showered or hadn't done our reading. 
All I know is that less than a month ago I was 23 going on 18 -and now l feel as if I'm 23 going on 35.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Readers contribute to the SMC funding discussion 
The College was in the wrong 
As a recent alumna of Saint Mary's, I applaud Right to Life's criticism of Saint Mary's pro-choice sponsorship in Friday's Viewpoint section. 
Disregarding one's personal beliefs, Saint Mary's as a whole is a Catholic college, and as such, should uphold Catholic values. While I appreciate that Saint Mary's encourages its students to voice their individual beliefs with courage and conviction, I am disap­pointed in my alma mater for support­ing a venture so obviously against the creed with with it identifies itself. 
I also must address Eric Glass's Friday statement about the "so many people at Notre Dame" who think "the girls across the street are immoral and ignorant." 
Mr. Glass. like you, I am pro-life. I agree Saint Mary's Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership, a Catholic entity. was in the wrong for sending students to Washington, D.C. to support pro-choice endeavors. In short, I agree you have a valid and noble point. 
However, I do not appreciate your tactless stereotyping of students at both our respective colleges. The Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross community has enough strains as it is. In the future, please use some fore­thought before making such remarks.

Saint Mary's mission is to educate 
I am writing in response to the negative letters about the Saint Mary's sponsor­ship of student participation in a pro­choice conference. 
We can talk about the Catholic identity at Catholic institutions until we are blue in the face, but what is more important to recognize is that Saint Mary's and Notre Dame are educational institutions. In order to educate, an institution has to allow its students to explore all ideas and views in society. 
It cannot possibly be accurate that sim­ply because I attend a Catholic institution I have to live in a closed off, conservative bubble for my college years and adult life. I would b~ extremely disappointed that I wasted an entire college career by never questioning or probing into the ideas that I have been indoctrinated with since childhood. 
I have based my life on the assumption that learning is fostered through unique and diverse experiences. I commend the Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership for allowing women "across lhe street" to develop into open-minded, strong, moral, informed and intelligent individuals that are able to make up their own minds about important issues. 
The Catholic identity of this fine institu­tion has provided its students with a sound basis ofethics and values that we will use to forge our own paths and sta­tions in life. 
God forbid, this institution provides its students with the freedom to learn and be educated through first hand experience. 
God forbid, women be allotted the sup­port to think outside of the Notre Dame, Indiana bubble without being labeled "immoral and ignorant." 
God forbid, women be intelligent enough to make their own informed choices. 
Given Eric Glass's overall portrayal of women in his letter, I suppose he is sur­prised that a Saint Mary's woman, or any woman at all for that matter. would be gifted enough to articulate her ideas on paper. 
Glass might also be surprised that a woman from Saint Mary's would have enough time to write this letter, due to all the "immoral" (sluttish) and "ignorant" (stupid) behavior and activities that we all so obviously participate in. 
Sarah Beth Bailey 
LeMmsHall junior Jan. 31 
Respect the right ofpeople to believe in values different from your own 
In one ofmy classes today, several girls reacted in horror and shock to arti­cles in Friday's Observer because they agreed. 
After reading, I realized that I don't agree. I have deliberated how to say this and although it may be hard to hear, I am a pro-choice supporter. I am not Catholic, or any religion, for that matter. 
That doesn't mean I'm an immoral person. I was simply not raised in a church, but that's a different story alto­gether. I am not writing this letter to change anyone's opinion; it would be nearly impossible and unfair to sway such a controversial issue in a person most likely given one value or another a very long time ago. 
When I think pro-choice I don't think murder. as it is often associated with. Murder is a deliberate crime based on hate. While abortion certainly isn't acci­dental, women who have abortions (or any pro-choice advocates for that mat­ter) aren't hateful people. 
In fact, two very close people in my immediate circle have had abortions, and they are two of the best people I've ever met. They made a mistake, and paid for it in a different way than many women. 
Yes that's right, they paid; it is proba­bly hard to believe. They have made a choice that will affect them for the rest of their life. 
Yes, it was at the expense of another human life, which is wrong, and I am not trying to justify it. 
However, there are many instances where choices have been made at the expense of other human lives that many pro-life supporters don't take a second glance at. For example, the choice to sentence someone to death or the choice to bomb an abortion clinic. 
You may be thinking, yes, but abortion kills innocent people, but so do the afore­mentioned "choices." It has been proven in the former that many people who are sentenced to death are later found inno­cent. The latter, however, is an act based on hatred for people who are guilty of having a different set of morals. 
We people who believe in a woman's right to choose aren't monstrous mur­derers. Not all ofus have had abortions either. We simply believe that it is wrong to make it illegal to tell a woman what to do with her body. 
As for Saint Mary's response to the two different trips to Washington, D.C.: Were both groups sponsored by the Center for Women's lntercultural Leadership or was it an individual act? 
I don't know all of the facts on this. I can understand up to a point being upset with the support of those values different than those of Saint Mary's and, as I understand in turn, to those of the Catholic Church. 
As I understand it, the pro-choice girls were sponsored by an organization here on campus dedicated to just such a cause (that is, diverse values). Were the pro-life girls sponsored by the same group, or were they doing this on their own resolve? 
If it was by the same group, I can understand the outrage expressed in prior articles. If not, as a non-Catholic, I don't understand. 
One of the greatest things here at St. Mary's is that I don't feel like I have to conform in religion or any other areas. I feel that as a student, and really, as a woman, they will support me through my four years and beyond, paying no atten­tion to the fact that I'm not Catholic. 
I'm sure that this letter will spark anger and I hope that's all. I'm actually surprised that for my first opinion article I decided to choose two controversial topics; pro-choice and St. Mary's "sup­port" of it, 
I just hope that, because I'm pro­choice, you won't glare or do anything else sparked by hate when we pass each other going to classes. Most of us are a gentle people, and haven't in fact had an abortion, so please treat us as you would any of your pro-life friends.

In the beginning, there was William Faulkner. 
The first Sophomore Literary Festival commemorated the works of this Nobel Prize-winning American writer. 36 years later, SLF looks to expand beyond the traditional and into more diverse types of writing -including writing about fic­tional news, with headlines like, "Man Totally Proud of Last Night's Drunken Phone Calls." 
Joanna Cornwell, one of the co-chairs of the 2003 festival, explains the changes in the spirit of the festival this year, as opposed to recent years. 
"This year, we really wanted to change the direction of the festival and restore [it] to some of its former glory ... we've really tried to increase student involve­ment and appeal to a larger range of people. This year we have multicultural aspects, journalists, playwrights, fiction, nonfiction and poetry. It really is a large variety," Cornwell said. 
Also as co-chair, Meghan Martin wants to provide a wide range of styles, but emphasizes the importance of literary

tradition at Notre Dame. 
"SLF's 36 year existence is a testament to the thriving arts community here on campus-no matter how quiet or unim­posing it may be, it proves that the writ­ten word must be celebrated, if for no other reason than the power that it evokes in such a subtly ubiquitous exis­tence," Martin said. 
Sophomore Literary Festival 2003: WordFest is the latest in a series of SLF's devoted to "Celebrating the power of the written word since 1967." This year's festival includes a partnership with the St. Joseph County Literacy Council, incorporating service to help raise literacy awareness. $1 admission to two of the events will benefit this cause. Another feature of this year's SLF was the organization of pre-events, such as "A Very Potter Evening" in November, held to celebrate the release of the latest Harry Potter movie. 
On Wednesday, the actual festival begins. The first guest making an appearance will be Dan Coyle, class of 1987, journalist and author of "Hardball: A Season in the Projects." The acclaimed non-fiction work is Coyle's memoir of his experience as a baseball coach for troubled kids in 



Chicago's infamous Cabrini-Green housing project. The story of a makeshift young base­ball team playing in the rough projects was adapted into a movie starring Keanu Reeves in 2001. Following Coyle's presentation there will be a recep­tion and book-signing session that will fea­ture entertainment by the student a cappella group Big Yellow Taxi. The next event will be Cavanaugh Coffeehouse, with Sister Jean Lenz. Lenz, assistant vice­president for Student Affairs, is the author of Loval Sons & Daughters: A Notre Dame Memoir. The book narrates her per­sonal recollections of three memorable decades in Notre Dame's history and describes her role in those pivotal years. Lenz contributed as an administrator,

Her appearance at SLF's Cavanaugh Coffeehouse will appropri­ately commence the dorm's Women's Awareness Month. The event will also showcase Harmonia, the all-women a cappella group, and end with refresh­ments and a book-signing. 
Nikki Giovanni, who also participated in the 1993 festival, will make the next writer's appearance. Giovanni has earned extensive critical acclaim, reception to follow. This is the first event to take tickets; the cost is $1 and pro­ceeds will benefit charity.

"[It's] an open avenue for the intellectual and philo­sophic, while maintaining a fun and free environment," he said. The student slam poetry showcase is an open mic night and another opportunity

1993 and brought a 12-pack of Olympia Gold to his first staff meeting. The paper does not use bylines, because the stories are intended to be from "The Onion" instead of a specific writer. The news stories cover an assortment of topics, from sardonic takes on serious current events to parodies of normally unnoticed aspects of everyday life. A reception and book-signing will take place after this event as well; this event also costs $1. 
For the next author, SLF will be a homecoming of sorts. Journalist Kevin Coyne, when writing the book "Domers: A Year at Notre Dame," managed to incorporate as many aspects of our University, from freshman orientation to graduation, as would fit in one year. Coyne's book will be filled with familiari­ty for students, alumni and die-hard fans alike, as it references a plethora of staples in the Notre Dame lifestyle. Pep rallies, classes. dances, parties. masses, football games. faculty meetings and trustee meetings all contributed to Notre Oame eventually winning over the author. 
Coyne's outlook remains realistic, however, and he addresses common issues such as the often-precarious bal­ancing act between spiritual, academic and social life on campus. The book also provides a view into the roles of leg­endary figures in Notre Dame's past, like Father Sorin, Father Hesburgh and the remarkable Knute Rockne. There will be a reception and book-signing after his presentation. featuring Notre Dame's all-male pop a cappella ensemble.

The final event will be ND Unplugged II, designed to be a student and faculty coffeehouse with poets, spoken-word artists, singer-songwriters, fiction authors, nonfiction authors, essayists, playwrights and more from the Notre Dame community. There will also be refreshments and a student art display. Beth Franzosa, one of the organizers of ND Unplugged, is excited for this event because of the tremendous success of last year's. The committee is prepared for an even better response this year, with a larger venue and longer hours. 
The organization and execution of so many events is the result of countless people putting in hours of work. 
"The committee has met weekly since September, and made efforts to bring a wide array of literary artists to campus for WordFest ... Meghan Martin and Joanna Cornwell have worked tirelessly since last April to put together this year's festival and committee," assistant chair of SLF, Bryan Kronk, said. 
I-low did all this literary madness begin? 
In 1967, as the Packers played the Chiefs in Super Bowl I, a Notre Dame student named Richard Rossi was busily establishing an enduring tradition. Inspired by a literary convention he had al.tended in high school, he dedicated himself to organizing a symposium of lit­erary scholars at Notre Dame. With the help of the sophomore class, the first Sophomore Literary Festival was held that year. honoring William Faulkner. 
Thanks to the promise of a football for 
Catch 22 fame 
agreed to speak 

after an autographed football was promised for his son. 
As invitations were sent out, the event began attracting the attention of promi­nent writers; as a result, it also gained support and monetary assistance from the University. The final lineup that year included impressive names in addition to Heller: Wright Morris, Ralph Ellison, Granville Hicks. William F. Buckley, Kurt Vonnegut and Norman Mailer. Mailer, whose youngest son John Buffalo is the Mailer in this year's festival, garnered national attention for the event with the premiere of his film, "Beyond the Law." 
In an e-mail Mroz sent to Martin this year as one of the new chairs, the sec­ond-ever SLF chair had inspiring words for the new chair. 
"You need to have a committee, a little army of dedicated women and men who share a vision. Mountains are moved by vision. You have the potential to move a mountain if you want to," Mroz said. Martin and Cornwell did find their dedi­cated committee, and those words of advice pushed them throughout the planning process. 
The festival has done a great deal of evolving since those first years. More focus is placed now on the students and their contributions. Cornwell feels strongly about how rewarding student involvement will be for all participants. "There is this untapped potential for fes­tivals like this and we feel that only if we can get the word out, students can expe­rience the power of the written word and even showcase their tremendous talents at nights like ND Unplugged," Cornwell said. 
After 36 years, SLF is still going strong, thanks to unique visions by every sophomore class each year. This year is no exception. "Sophomore Literary Festival more or less had a face lift," Cornwell said. 
Sophomore Literary Festival 2003: WordFest will take place from Wednesday to Feb. 13. All proceeds from ticket sales and donations accepted at the door will benefit the St. Joseph County Literacy Council.

Women's s-witnniing beats Wolverines in last dual meet 
By PAT LEONARD 
Sports Writer 

The womens swimming and diving team ended their dual meet season on Saturday with a nail-biting 153-147 victory over Michigan at Rolfs Aquatic Center. The Irish (9-1-1) edged the Wolverines (3-3) in the mcet's final event of the 200 freestyle relay by .33 sec­onds to pull out the win. 
Junior Danielle Hulick. senior Heidi Hendrick. sopho­more Katie Eckholt and sophomore Kristen Peterson clocked in at 1:35.03 and gave the Irish a win over their then-No. 19 opponent. 
"We've had some pretty close meets with them over the years," said coach Bailey Weathers. "Usually they're better at the freesty le relay. But our girls swam hard and I think our girls probably sur­prised them a little bit." 
Notre Dame won nine events on the day. Hulick is responsi­ble for three of the nine victo­ries. Hulick swam on the dif­ference-making relay team and also won two individual events, the 50 freestyle (23. 90) and the 100 backstroke (56.33). 
"Danielle has had a great season for us," Weathers said. "She did an awesome job yes­terday and she is definitely a team leader for us." 
A three-time Big East cham­pion and the Big East 200 freestyle relay record holder. Hulick competed strongly in other events as well, taking second in the 200 medley relay, the 1650 freestyle, and the 200 freestyle events. 
Other Irish victors include Hendrick in the 100 freestyle (51.86), Peterson in the 200 backstroke (2:03.42) and junior Lisa Garcia in the 200 butterfly (2:01.03) 
Junior l\leghan Perry-Eaton won the 1-meter (322.64 points) and 3-meter (307.95) diving competitions. Weathers said that while divers are expected to be more consis­tent as fatigue is not an issue, his swimmers do not take Perry-Eaton's consistency for granted. 
Prior to the weekend, Weathers said he wanted his team to swim its hardest, win or lose, to show themselves they were ready for the Big East Championships. 
So is the team ready to trav­el to Uniondale, N.Y. on Feb. 20? 
"This win gave us a lot of confidence in terms of where we arc," Weathers said. "The girls are really looking for­ward to the Big East Championships. This meet gave us real good idea of where we are and what we have to do to get the girls ready, which is important." 
The Irish finish the dual­meet season one win behind the team's 10-1 record of a season ago and will now con­centrate on resting for the upcoming championships.

Szelle is now seventh on the career wins list after an 18-3 weekend. He is 162-11 in his career. Carnick went 13-3 and now has 167 career wins, which ranks her fourth on the womens epee wins list.

hang their hat on their free throw shooting ability. It paid off big-time, as seven of Notre Dame's 11 points in the second overtinrn came on free throws. 
At one point, the Irish led 90­85 in the second overtime. But the Hoyas slowly chipped away at that lead. Drew Hall, who made a 3-pointer with 4.4 sec­onds left in the first overtime to tie the score, hit another three pointer. And after Matt Carroll ­who finished with a career-high 36 points, including 6-for-12 from 3-point land -hit a short jumper, Mike Sweetney scored a layup to pull the Hoyas to within two with 46 seconds to play. 
After Jones missed a 3-pointer from the corner, Hall hit two free throws to tie the score with 10 seconds left, setting the stage for Jones' heroics. 
"They were frenzied and foul­ing us, and I thought whoever we could get it to, [they had to] just drive and take it all the way to the hole," Irish coach Brey said. "Then we could see what we could get out of it." 
But the game wouldn't have even gone into overtime had the Irish not squandered a 15-point lead. Throughout the first half and for most of the second, Notre Dame seemed firmly in control, and when Carroll hit a 3-pointer -setting a school record for most career 3-point­ers -with 14:05 remaining to give the Irish a 55-40 lead, the only question remaining seemed to be at what point walk-on Dan Lustig would enter the game.

Notre Dame, however, refused to yield. They scored the next three points on free-throws to take a 68-66 lead -a lead they saw disappear again when Sweetney scored, got fouled and made the subse­quent free throw. 
After Tom Timmermans made a free throw to tie the score with 28 seconds left, the Hoyas called a timeout to set up a linal play. Although Hoya coach Craig Esherick said his team was trying to get the ball into Sweetney, they never passed the ball into him and their guards never got a shot off. 
"We had tried to get the ball into Mike, and it obviously didn't work," Esherick said. "We did a great job recovering from that, but we obviously made a mistake." 
In the first overtime, Carroll got the Irish on top quickly by scoring the first five Irish points. Then, after the Hoyas then he makes 

an unbeliev· 
able play." 

Yet the Irish still nearly pulled out the victory in the first over­time. Chris Thomas, who scored 24 points despite shooting 4-for­20 from the field and fouling out in the second overtime, drove the length of the floor and launched an off-balance shot from the right elbow as time expired. The ball glanced off the backboard and bounced on the rim twice before falling a way. 
But in the final overtime peri­od, the Irish weren't about to be denied. 
"We have a team that just refuses to lose, no matter what it is," Carroll said. "We're going to keep fighting if it takes three overtimes, four overtimes, or two overtimes. We're gonna keep fighting until we get that win."

Olivet (7-12. 2-6) proved to be too much for Saint Mary's in the second half. as the Lady Comets overcame a 13-point first half deficit to come back and defeat the Belles 67-58. 
Amanda Johnston was unstoppable for Olivet, scoring 19 points and grabbing nine rebounds in only 24 minutes of action. 
Olivet lived up to its billing as a well balanced squad, as three players scored nine points to help out Johnston, who shot eight of l 3 from the field. As a team, Olivet shot well, in the second half -51 percent-to help them pull away. Olivet also out-rebound­ed Saint Mary's 43-39. 
Saint Mary's was dealt another blow earlier in the game, when leading scorer Emily Creachbaum went down with an ankle injury at the 17­min ute mark in the second half. However, the Belles were not fazed, as the last time these two teams met, Creachbaum did not play in the Belles victory. 
"Losing [Creachbaum] wasn't something that we focused on, because we had beat them without her earlier in the sea­son, but we just couldn't get it done," junior point guard Katie Miller said. 
Saint Mary's has had some trouble finishing this season, as they have been outplayed in the second half in many games. However, the Belles (5-14, 1-7J are not getting down about their season just yet. 
"We are still staying positive, and focusing on getting a win," Milter said after the team's seventh straight loss. "It was very disappointing that we didn't win, because we needed to beat Olivet, but there are other teams in the conference that we can beat. We will get some 'W's,"' said Miller. 
The Belles have reason to stay positive, as they played a great first half, building a 13­point lead. However, they were unable to put the game away early. as the Lady Comets went on a 13-4 run to close the half, and cut the lead to four. The Belles then struggled to start the second half, and the Lady Comets never looked back. 
"It has been so frustrating," said Miller. "We have strug­gled in the second half all year long." 
Despite the loss, the game was not a total negative for the Belles. Freshmen Anne Hogan and Bridget Boyce were bright spots in the loss, as both scored in double digits. with 13 and 15 points, respectively. Hogan also added six rebounds. Miller was also impressive with ten points. 
The Relles now travel to Hope College (19-0. 8-0) on Wednesday night, to face the third-ranked team in the rank­ings of D3hoops.com -and the MIAA leader.

Dame-Georgetown tilt went into overtime. He told his team to believe. 
And believe they did. 
Even Helen Keller could see how much Carroll means to the Irish. 
In the summer, he rallied his teammates for two, sometimes three, workouts a day, because he knew that practice would pay off in games like the one the Irish played Saturday. 
When the Irish headed into the weight room, Carroll didn't team up with backcourt mate Chris Thomas or fellow senior Dan Miller. No, he chose freshman big man Torin Francis, both acknowledging and helping the young McDonald's All-American understand his importance to Notre Dame's success. 
His game has evolved dramati­cally from the point where, as a freshman, Carroll was purely a shooter. Now, he developed the ability to take opponents off the dribble -with left and right hand equally -and shut down opponents on defense. Now, he's poised to leave his John Hancock all over the Notre Dame record book. 
Brcr might cringe at the sight of Thomas hoisting up crazy shots in big games. He winces if Notre Dame's big men 'shrink under the glare of a spotlight. 
Then he looks at Carroll and sees Notre Dame's most consis­tent player scoring, defending and leading at will. 
"He wants to take big shots. 
Brey said. "l will live or die with 
him taking a shot  - or even a  
bad shot, sometimes ­ when the  
game's on the line."  

A week ago, Brey lived to cele­brate an overtime victory over Boston College, keyed in part by a spectacular 4-point play Carroll made in the extra period. 
Saturday, he was at it again. In the two overtime periods alone, Carroll tallied 11 of his career­high 36 points. On defense. he crashed the backboard. often poking rebounds out of the grasp of a Hoya and into the hands of an Irish player. 
And during timeouts, he reminded his teammates that they don't know how to do any­thing other than win. 
There was Carroll talking to freshman Chris Quinn, in the game after Thomas fouled out early in the second overtime, telling him his teammates were going to help him out. 
There was Carroll patting Torrian Jones on the butt after he missed his first free throw, telling Jones the second -and game-winning -free throw was a piece of cake . 
There was Carroll waving his arms frantically to spur the crowd and his teammates during their final defensive stand, and there he was seconds later wav­ing his arms again in triumph. 
"This team believes," Carroll said. "There's something about this team."

Irish win away at West Virginia 
By KATIE MCVOY 
Associate Sports Editor 
The Irish can officially say that January is over and, this time, they've started the month off on the right 'foot. Notre Dame opened the month of February by snapping a four-game home losing streak with a 69-64 victory against West Virginia on Saturday. 
"I don't think I was ever so glad to turn a page in my cal­endar," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "J was so happy to be out of January and mov­ing forward." 
The Irish finally began to find what they were missing during their last four home games, and it paid off. 
For starters, Notre Dame returned its usual players to their places of prominence, Alicia Ratay, last year's go-to scorer, found her rhythm again and hit 14 of Notre Dame's first 24 points on the way to 21 points, her second highest point total of the sea­son. 
"It was great to see Alicia Hatay come out and have a great game," McGraw said. 
Ratay, who West Virginia expected to stand around and shoot, started to do something else on Saturday too -she started to score ofT the dribble. That alone was enough to throw the Mountaineers off their game plan and, despite their two-point halftime lead, they left the floor with some­thing to think about. 
"Ratay, she just took over the game. She had a great game," Mountaineers coach Mike

Carey said. "What made her tough this game is she started taking it off the dribble ... that made her a double threat and that made it tough." 
But the best part for Notre Dame was that Ratay did not single-handedly win Saturday's game. Sophomore Jacqueline Batteast added 21 points of her own, either scor­ing or assisting on nine of Notre Dame's 13 field goals in the second half. Several of her five total assists went to team­mate Teresa Borton, who the victory as

Jackie, thank you," Borton told her teammate during the post-game press conference. 
Le'Tania Severe also had her part to play. The junior guard played with some shoulder padding despite the fact that a shoulder injury she sustained against Boston College had left her questionable for Saturday's game. Severe had three assists and seven rebounds during her 32 min­utes of play. 
-"She's the glue to our team. She doesn't have to score to be effective," McGraw said. "She probably played in a little pain but she said it didn't hurt." 
The solid play of last year's all-stars, supplemented by nine points from freshman Courtney LaVere, added up for the Irish offense. The team effort removed much of the pressure on a single player that had left the Irish cornered in their last four games at the Joyce Center 
"A lot of my teammates played really well tonight," Batteast said. "Teresa [Rorton] was 7-for-7 and Alicia [Ratay] came out really aggressive. So I didn't feel as much pressure. It was good to see everyone was willing to help out and everyone was willing to do their job." 
Notre Dame's defense had its 
part to play in 
three-point 
threat from West Virginia's Kijte Bulger. The junior guard, who leads the Mountaineers in scoring and in treys, was just 1-7 in the second half, hitting her only shot with just 18 seconds left to play. She was just 5-13 overall with three baskets out­side the three-point line. 
"I think we did a great job of finding her," McGraw said. "And after [the first haln we did a great job of shutting her down." 
Notre Dame will take two days off before hitting the floors of the Joyce Center to start practice before taking on Georgetown on Wednesday at home.

Women lose to a 5th­ranked Tarheels tea111 
By JOE LINDSLEY

Notre Dame began its Saturday match against North Carolina with a promising start. The No. 21 Irish won the doubles point to take an early 1-0 lead. 
The lead was extremely short-lived, however. as the fifth-ranked Tarhcels domi­nated in singles play, and visiting North Carolina claimed the match, 5-2.

Prior to their triumph, freshman Jennifer Smith and sophomore Sarah Jane Connelly improved to 11-6 as a pair this season when they won 8-4 at No. 3 doubles. 
Cunha and Stastny did not know they were playing a highly ranked opponent until after the match had been settled in their favor. 
"When we were playing them, I had no idea they were ranked," Cunha said. 
Cunha said she had to check the program after one of her friends claimed that the Bunn-Pinchbeck duo was ranked. 
"After I found that out, [ was really pleased," said Cunha, the team's captain. "That was just an added bonus." 
With the doubles point secured, Connelly would be the only Irish player to claim a singles victory. The sopho­more defeated North Carolina's Lee Bairos, 7-5, 7­6 (7-5). Her victory came only after the Tarheels had already won five straight sin­gles matches.

"Knowing our team's capa­bilities, I think we could have played a lot better," Cunha said. "I think we let some matches slip away a little bit. But it's early in the season, and we have a young team." 
The Irish certainly have to deal with inexperience. Three players in the singles lineup Saturday were fresh­men, one a sophomore, and one is making her comeback

Cunha acknowledged that gaining experience and becoming better able to deal with tough opponents will take a little time for the Irish. 
"I am not worried," Cunha said. "Winning the doubles point [Saturday] gave us a lot of confidence. "North Carolina is an excellent team. There's nothing to be ashamed of." 
The Irish will not compete again until a Feb. 14 home match against Virginia Tech. 
Over the next two weeks, the Irish have plenty of work to do. 
"I think everyone has something they want to work on individually," Cunha said. "We'll probably be playing a lot of practice matches amongst ourselves. We can work really hard without worrying about getting too tired for matches."

Irish tie 1, lose 1 over w-eekend 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER 
Sports Writer 
For both games this week­end against Ohio State, the Irish found themselves down 2-0 quickly. 
The results couldn't have been more different. 
Friday. Notre Dame scored three unanswered goals after the two-goal deficit, only to 
... end up with a 3-3 tie when Ohio State scored with 4. 7 seconds remaining. Saturday, the Irish offense simply never got going and the team ended up with a 2-0 loss, despite a phenomenal effort in goal with Morgan Cey making 41 saves. "We got outplayed tonight, which was disappointing com­ing off the way we played last night," said Irish coach Dave Poulin after Saturday's loss. Friday, in front of one of the smallest crowds this year, the Irish put on perhaps one of their best performances of the season, leading No. 10 Ohio State 3-2 going into the third period before the Buckeyes were able to tie. In front of a sellout on Saturday, the Irish went back to square one. "We need some guys to step up and make plays," said Poulin after his team was shutout for the first time this season. The shutout on Saturday was unexpected following an impressive performance the night before. The Buckeyes normally average giving up 
24.1 shots to their opponent over the course of a game. 
Notre Dame had 24 shots on goal just shortly into the third period. 
Ohio State had a power play that was clicking at a rate of one goal every five chances. 
The Irish only allowed the Buckeyes one power play goal in 11 opportunities. 
"I thought we had a lot of energy," said Poulin about Friday's game. "We didn't throw the puck away and had many great chances." 
The Buckeyes scored on its first power play chance of the game, with defenseman Doug Andress scoring from the blue line past a screened Cey' about four minutes into the first period.

For most of the third period, the Irish appeared headed to perhaps its biggest win of the season, with Cey coming up huge as the Irish were being outshot 13-3. 
It was that 14th shot that Cey could not save. 
With a little over a minute left, the Buckeyes decided to pull Betz in favor of another offensive player. Despite sev­era! opportunities to clear the puck down the ice, the Irish could not get the puck away from their goal, and Buckeye David Steckel was able to score off a rebound with just

Seminoles chop Irish 
on final point of match 
By JOE LINDSLEY 
Sports Writer 
A precious win was in sight for the Irish Friday night at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
After losing the doubles point in the match against Florida State, Notre Dame had rallied to win three singles matches, tying the score at three points apiece. Seminole Matt Cloer and Irish tri-captain Luis Haddock were the last competi­tors on the court. An Irish victo­ry in that final match would give Notre Dame its first tri­umph in a winless spring sea­son. A Seminole win would knock the Irish, still ranked 34th nationally, down once again, for the fourth time in as many matches. 
In the end, Cloer prevailed as he upset No. 72 Haddock, 7-5, 6-4. And the Irish moved to 0-4, the worst start in school histo­ry, as the Seminoles won, 4-3. 
"We're not going to get down from this," junior tri-captain Matt Scott said. "We're just going to build on this and take this to Wisconsin [Tuesday]." 
Scott suggested that the loss was made even more painful because the Irish nearly were able to pull off their first win of the season. 
"I think we felt a little more confident," Scott said. "Then again, is it better to come really close and lose, or to get beat pretty badly? It almost hurts more when you come that close." 
Scott and freshman Brent 
D'Amico won their doubles match 8-3, after senior captain Brian Farrell and sophomore Paul McNaughton were defeat­ed 8-5 at the No. 3 flight. Haddock and Ben Hatten tried to grab the doubles point for Notre Dame, but they lost 8-5 to the 38th ranked doubles duo in the country. The Irish refused to concede the match with the Seminoles' securing of the dou­bles point, and Scott, ranked 119th nationally, defeated Romain Jurd, 6-3, 6-1. It was Scott's first win in dual-match play this season after contend­ing against players ranked sev­enth and second nationally. 
Inexperience most likely played a role in the Irish loss. with freshmen Patrick Buchanan and Eric Langenkamp both suffering defeats in straight sets. 
"With every match the guys are getting more and more experience," Scott said. "I think that will really come in handy towards the latter part of the year when it really matters, come tournament time." 
D'Amico and Farrell, with their wins at the No. 3 and 4 flights, respectively, kept the Irish in the match. D'Amico upset Florida State's Alex Herrera, who was ranked 114th. "We played better than we played against Indiana and Ohio State," Scott said. "Florida State is a great team and they came through when they had to."

Irish top Hoyas in double-OT thriller 
. Jones' late free throw provides final margin after Irish blow huge lead 
 By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
Torrian Jones watched his first free-throw attempt clang off the rim. He heard his teammates come up to him and encourage him, telling the 
t( 66 percent free throw shooter they had confidence in him. He looked at the scoreboard and saw the score tied at 92 with four seconds on the clock. 
So he stepped to the free­th row line again, sunk the shot, and then forced Georgetowns's Drew Hall into launching a 30-foot despera­tion heave at the buzzer. 
And when the ball rico­cheted off the backboard, No. 11 Notre Dame had survived a scare from Georgetown to win 93-92 in double-overtime. 
The game brought back memories of Notre Dame's quadruple-overtime victory over Georgetown last year. And after the game. parallels to the two games were far too easy to come by. 
"We were like. 'Here we go again,"' Jones said. "But we were tested and we'd been there before. We had guys who went through it before, and I knew we'd be ready." 
Notre Dame (18-3, 6-1 in the Big East) is now off to its best start since 1978. And part of their success this sea­son has come when the Irish

. Carroll sets 3-point record, ignites Irish to victory 

The record-setter should have been the backbreaker. 
With the Irish leading the Hoyas 52-40, Matt Carroll caught a pass a few feet in front of Mike Brey -a few steps behind the 3-point arc -and launched a shot toward the basket. 
The ball swished through. the crowd erupted. Georgetown called a timeout and Carroll had career 3-point­er No. 260, surpass­ing his former team­mate David Graves. 


"I know Dave 

probably hates me Andrew Soukup right now," Carroll joked after the game. "He probably Sports won't call me after Columnist this one, he's pretty 
[ticked] off." 

So what would have made Graves more upset -the fact that Carroll broke his record or the fact that Notre Dame blew a 15-point lead? 
Give the Hoyas credit -they knew how to beat the Irish. All the guards did was dump the ball into human dump truck Mike Sweetney, who then made scoring baskets look as easy as taking out the trash. 
But Carroll wasn't fazed. And if Carroll isn't fazed, then neither are the Irish. Because Matt Carroll is the heart and soul of Notre Dame's team. If Notre Dame is Frankenstein, then Carroll is the spark that gives them life. 
Look what happened as Georgetown started to chip away at Notre Dame's lead. Every timeout, Carroll pulled his teammates together and reminded them what happened the last time a Notre

FENCING 

Top-ranked Nittany Lions tamed by No. 2 Irish 
ByMATTLOZAR 
Sports Editor 

After going 9-4 in his first collegiate bouts last weekend, junior sabre Brian Dosal came into this weekend's match against No. 1 Penn State with realistic hopes. 
"I didn't expect to win at all," the second-year fencer said. "I got lucky and when I got some momentum, it really fired me up." 
Sometimes the best surprises come with no expectations. 
Using Dosal's two upset wins. the second-ranked Irish mens fencing team defeated the top-ranked Nittany Lions 15-12 to made their claim for the top spot in the country. 
"He started almost fencing with us like a walk-on and had a little skill but not much," Notre Dame coach Janusz Bednarski said. "He is progressing very quickly." 
Dosal dropped his first bout 5-0, and his next one wasn't looking promising with talented freshman Marten Zagunis on deck. Dosal surprised everybody by posting a 5-3 victory, and by following that win with a 5-3 win over Noah Jacobson. 
"It feels great. They didn't expect me to do it, so doing it makes the whole season worth it." Dosal said. "I defi­nitely can compete at that level. It is only five-touch bouts, but I feel I can steal away a couple which can make the difference [in future matches]." 
Gabor Szelle and Matt Fabricant also posted individual 2-1 records against the Nittany Lions to the give the Irish sabre squad a collective 6-3 record. Fabricant defeated two-time All­American Amir Rahimi 5-4 and Szelle also beat Zagunis 5-4. 
The mens epee team also went 6-3 against Penn State and was led by senior captain Jan Viviani's 3-0 record. Viviani and sophomore Michal Sobieraj each won crucial overtime matches. 
Mens foil compiled a 3-6 record that was highlighted by sophomore Derek Snyder's 5-4 win over current NCAA Champion Nonpatat Panchan. 
While the mens team was able to knock off the top-ranked team in the country for the third straight season, the womens team couldn't complete the upset, losing to Penn State 16-11. 

"This is not unusual with such close rivals clashing with each other. It is good for us because it is good training. a lot of good bouts and we can see how it will be in the future." Bednarski said. "Our fencers fenced very well. I am happy, not really happy, but happy." 
The womens foil team was the only weapon to post a winning record against Penn State, going 5-4. Sophomores Andrea Ament and Alicja Kryczalo each went 2-1. Kryczalo
