By EMMA DRISCOLL News Writer 
Ac; one of the first moves of his presidency, President Barack Obama halted prosecutions at Guantanamo Bay, and the Associated Press reported that Obama would sign an exeeutive order Thursday closing detention facility in Cuba within a year. 
Professor Mary Ellen O'Connell, a Notre Dame professor of international law and a specialist on the law of war, said she was pleased with the action. 
"This was very good news, very good news indeed. The military commissions process that was set up at Guantanamo Bay is widely considered to have been seriously 11awed, very defective ... so halting those commis­sions proceedings now was a very important move by the president to get the United States back into good standing with the rest of the world," O'Connell said.

During the first Student Senate meeting of the semester, the group reviewed work done QVer break, including a resolution to get printers in every dorm, and discussed committee agendas for the spring sbmester. 
The resolution that requested printers in every dorm on cam­pus was passed before break by the Campus Life Council and was approved by Fr. Mark Poorman, vice president for Student Affairs, over break, stu­dent body president Bob Heish said. 
"By the time you get back to school next fall, there will be printers in every dorm," Reish said. 
Heish also updated the Senate on the progress of the Midwest Collegiate Council, an idea that originated in Reish and student body vice president Grant Schmidt's campaign. 
"As you know, the purpose of the Midwest Collegiate Council is to bring other college's to Notre Dame's campus to discuss rele­vant issues," he said. 
Heish told the Senate several prominent universities have agreed to make the trip to Notre Dame. Student Government has received responses from University of Chicago, Northwestern University, Purdue University and Washington University in St. Louis, he said.

Robbins speaks about 'theatre as community' 
By CATHERINE MILLER News Writer

Academy-Award winning actor and social activist Tim Robbins told an audience at the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center Wednesday night that the goal of theater is to "create a lasting, shared experience that will be remembered." 
He related that definition to the inauguration of President Barack Obama, saying that just as the inauguration united"humanity in hope and possibility, theater should have the same efl"ect, he said. 
Robbins gave a lecture called "Theater as C_ommunity" in the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center to students, faculty and statl". 
"Theater by nature is unique and mere relevant when it involves community. It does not work if you pretend community isn't there," Hobbins said.

Change of plan 

Tuesday was all about change for a lot of people. During the afternoon, I was sit­ting on my futon, innocently checking my e-mails, and found out that I got a job offer. Instead of being relieved and excit­ed to prove to every single relative I have that my English major was in fact worth something, I 
Emma Driscoll 

immediately burst 
into tears. 
I'm not typically a News Writer crier, but something about the moment completely overwhelmed me and I felt inexplicably devastated. Sitting there, sobbing, I felt so ridiculous because I had no idea why I was so sad and I felt like I should have been more grateful to have a potential option. 
The longer I sat there, the more I real­ized that it wasn't the strange city or any surprises about the job itself that had upset me. It was the fact that I may have found a plan, and the plan would include a lot of changes: moving away from Notre Dame, away from friends, away from everything that I have spent the last three ami. half years building. 
As much as I have stressed out over the last three and a half years about finding a plan, I think I always secretly thrived on the fact that I didn't have one. For me, options and ambiguity are kind of com­forting and plans_have always felt limit­ing. 
But after casually (and even proudly) proclaiming "I have no idea what I want to do with my life" thousands of times, I may have arrived at something. 
I've always known that the future was coming, but it seemed so far away. Suddenly, it is getting real. 
All of my pre-med friends who spent countless hours in the library and reli­giously attended MCAT classes will no longer be trying to get into med school. They will be in med school, and soon they will be doctors and surgeons. 
My business major friends are no longer seeking temporary summer intern­ships to help move on to something more permanent. They are looking for some­thing permanent. 
Those considering graduate school may soon be the inspiring professors -the ones that everybody knows of and talks about-in just a few years. 
People who have always talked about doing service abroad or teaching abroad will actually be living abroad. 
While all of these changes -or really progressions -are so obvious, they did­n't seem quite as real to me until Tuesday. 
Maybe there is just too much emphasis on the idea of a plan. All of the plans that I have ever made have been thwart­ed in some huge way that frustrated me at the time, but then ultimately lead me to the very best parts of my life. Things tend to have a way of working out. 
As for me -regardless of whether or not I take this job -I plan to make the most of the rest of my senior year (and we do still have a lot of time). I'll be by The Fan, soaking in views of the dome and spending as much time as possible with th'e people that have made college a 
-time of which I am scared to let go. That's a plan I can live with.

Saint Mary's College is offering students the opportu­nity to keep their New Year's resolutions to get in shape with open conditioning class­es. 
The classes, held Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays in the Angela Athletic Facility, are open to all students. 
"These classes are especial­ly geared towards students that are interested in becom­ing better soccer and volley­ball players, but are open to anyone interested in a solid conditioning program this semester," said Saint Mary's

College celebrates history this week 
By SARAH MAYER News Writer 
Saint Mary's students have the chance to reflect on over 150 years of history at the College during the annual Heritage Week events, which began Monday. 
Heritage Week replaced Pride Week almost four years ago. The event seeks to unite the College and educate students about its rich background. 
Coinciding with the feast day of Blessed Basil Moreau on Jan. 20, Board of Governance Chief of Staff Lauren Theiss has organ­ized the events throughout the week. 
"Heritage Week is a time for students to learn about the histo­ry of Saint Mary's and to be able to appreciate the wonderful col­lege that we attend," Theiss said. 
While the event runs for a week in late January, the plan­ning has been going on since November and continued over Christmas break. 
Remaining events during the week -open to everyone on campus -include Bingo with the Sisters on Thursday in the convent and a reading of the poetry of Saint Mary's President Emeritus Sister M. Madeleva Wolff, known as Sister Madeleva, in the Reidinger House on Friday. 
Keeping up with the tradition, tours of the Reidinger House, where Saint Mary's students once went to learn traditional etiquette, will be available on Friday. This House is where alumni stay when they return to campus and is only open a few times during the academic year. 
On Wednesday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m., Heritage Week T­shirts were passed out in the Student Center. 
"The front left corner of the shirt has the SMC script and says Heritage Week 2009. The back has a picture of the avenue with the quote, 'It is not the honor you take with you, but the heritage you leave behind,"' Theiss, said. 
The cuhnination of Heritage Week is the gathering Friday night. 
"The highlight for the week will be the Heritage Dinner on Friday night," said Theiss. "The Sisters, administrators and stu­dents gather for dinner in Stapleton Lounge and exchange stories and experiences shared at Saint Mary's. 
Saint Mary's first year Alexandra Lowe picked up a free shirt and said she is excited about Friday's-Heritage Week events. 
"I live in Holy Cross Hall so I pass the Reidinger House multi­ple times a day. I am excited to finally see what it looks like inside," Lowe said. '

Robbins explained that theater must do more than simply offer entertainment; it must provoke thought and a lasting effect. 
"People want an ice cream sun­dae of entertainment in their belly, but in tl1e morning ilie feeling has disappeared," he said. "What we really need is a good laugh, but community needs more. We need to feel something ilie day after." 
It is not enough to wiggle around on stage and be cute and charming, he joked. 
Robbins said he has been asked why it is necessary to merge art and social issues. 
"I don't know how art can exist without involving the world around it," he said. 
Over the past two years, Robbins has directed the Actors' Gang performance of George Orwell's "1984" and has travelled to 40 states and four continents. 
Robbins explained that the play has sparked similar discussions concerning civil liberties and the use of rule by fear af each loca­tion. He used that as an example of the provocation of thought by production. 
"Art is essential in moments of Student Government to support a resolution that would allow grad­uate school or job interviews to be a University approved excuse for absence from class. Lewis talked to faculty from different depart­ments on campus to gauge if there is any sort of policy, and how professors would feel about this resolution. 
"For the most part, most of the professors reported that their departments don't have an official policy," she said. 
However, Lewis said most facul­ty members she spoke with said they personally would not have a problem with a student missing class because of a job interview.

McKinney agreed the urgency of this announcement sends a message. 
"Generally what happens in the first hundred days or even first hundred hours of any administration or regime sets the tone for the time in power," McKinney said. "It was a very powerful stance on human rights and how it seems this administration is going to be protecting them on multiple lev­els." 
Ultimately, O'Connell and McKinney expeet that the deten­tion center will be completely shut down and they hope that this happens sooner rather than later. 
"I think [shutting down the detention center] is at tl1e end of the road that has been sort of started with this announce­ment," McKinney said.

When Scully was asked if receiving the award from the White House was one of his greatest accomplishments, he said that he does not think in the terms of his own achievements. 
"If anything, it certainly isn't a recognition of my life. It's a recog­nition of all of the work and the passion and the creativity of the hundreds and hundreds of the young men and women -NO grads -who have been ACE teachers," he said. "To that extent, I am very proud of their work and their accomplishments. The President was recognizing the work of the ACE teachers and the ACE principals -and Notre Dame. To the extent iliat it gives glory to Notre Dame and ilie con­gregation of Holy Cross, I think [the award] is great."

some!" That week, he walked into a meeting for the responders to the ad in ilie Notre Dame room of LaFortune, expecting 12 or 15 people to show up. 
"I walked into the room that night and iliere were 150 gradu­ating seniors from Notre Dame and I thought 'Wow, that's just amazing."' 
Scully said he felt this was an indication that the Holy Spirit was asking him to think bigger than just a program in Savannah. Today, he has developed the pro­gram to include well over 1,000 young teachers in 33 communi­ties in the U.S:, as well as a pro­gram for principals and a consult­ing firm for at-risk Catholic schools. 
The ACE program has come a long way since its first budget of two $5,000 checks from then­University President Father Edward "Monk" Malloy's oflice, he said. 
'The Holy Spirit really wanted this to happen and ACE has become kind of a juggernaut. The 
"It's important that we move expeditiously -within the next few months to close Guantanamo Bay," she said. ''I'm sorry to hear that he's been get­ting advice to move slowly. . . . I think ilie pnople who have been advising him ... may not be sulli­ciently expert as to what AmeriCa's legal obligations are." 
O'Connell said she sees a need for international law experts to advise the president, calling the advice oft-fimployed constitu­tional or criminal law experts "inadequate" when it comes to international law. 
"Unless you know the treaties, the customary law rules, and the human rights principles that are at stake, you may be giving the president the wrong advice or inadequate advice," O'Connell said. 
If the Obama administration does dismantle the detention center, it will need to consider what to do with the people who are currently detained. 
Approximately 250 people are currently detained at Guantanamo Bay -down from a peak of almost 800 -and some of these people do not have any charges or evidence against them, O'Connell said. 
"We simply have been unable to convince their home countries or the places we took them from to take them back or it is not safe for them to be returned," O'Connell said. 
Some of the evidence against people detained at Guantanamo has been obtained from "unlaw­ful methods" and cannot be used in courts, O'Connell said. "If we have no usable credible, lawfully obtained evidence against them, we cannot conclude that they are guilty of a crime. Not in our system." 
In situations when credible evidence cannot be found against a detained person, O'Connell believes that these people must be released back into the United States. 
"The only solution I see for individuals in that category is to repatriate them to the United States. It will be very bitter for some people to contemplate, but that is the cost of creating the prison at Guantanamo Bay," O'Connell said. 
"We've made a terrible mis­take in ever using methods of torture and 'abuse, and we may have to pay a high price for that mistake," she said. 
During the period that the administration has halted the prosecutions, O'Connell and McKinney said that the proceed­ings will be reviewed. 
"They're going to review if these are fair or just or even eflective ways to prosecute these prospective terrorists. I think after that is done they're going to create a more effective mech­anism for these prosecutions ... there won't be a need for Guantanamo," McKinney said.

DAKAR, Senegal -Congo's invitation to its longtime enemy Rwanda to deploy up to 2,000 troops marked an extraordinary rever­sal of alliances, but the Congolese govern­ment said Wednesday the Rwandan forces were there only to observe, not to fight Hutu militias. 
Some fear the presence of Rwandan sol­diers could spark more violence or lead to further destabilization in Congo. And the unusual deal may already be facing opposi­tion: U.N.-backed Radio Okapi quoted the head of Congo's National Assembly, Vital Kamerhe, as saying he was shocked by the news and had not been informed about it beforehand. 
Congo allowed the Rwandan troops to cross its border Tuesday, ostensibly as observers, to help disarm deeply entrenched Rwandan Hutu militias who fled to Congo after Hwanda's 1994 genocide, Congo gov­ernment spokesman Lambert Mende said. 
Gaza casualty tally released 
KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip -Squatting in the rubble, his briefcase perched atop his knees, the human rights researcher inter­viewed residents of a house shelled by Israel as he compiled a list of Gazans killed and wound­ed during Israel's offensive against Barnas. 
Yasser Abdel Ghafar's work is part of a painstaking endeavor by the Palestinian Center for Human Rights to count the casualties of the 23-day war. The group released a final tally Wednesday, saying 1,284 Gazans were killed and 4,336 wounded, the vast majority civilians. 
Israel has accused llamas of inflating the civilian casualties, saying it has the names of more than 700 l-lamas militants killed in the lighting.

Nashville may make English official 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -Nashville could become the largest U.S. city to make English the mandatory language for all government business under a measure being put before voters Thursday, but critics say it might invite lawsuits and even cost the city millions in federal funding. 
Though similar measures have passed elsewhere, the idea has ignited an intense debate. Proponents say using one language would unite the city, but business leaders, academics and the city's mayor worry it could give the city a bad reputation, because, as Gov. Phil Bredesen put it, "it's mean spirit-

Study finds cleaner air adds to life 
LOS ANGELES -Cleaner air over the past two decades has added nearly five months to average life expectancy in the United States, according to a federally funded study. 
Researchers said it is the first study to show that reducing air pollution trans­lates into longer lives. 
Between 1978 and 2001, Americans' average life span increased almost three years to 77, and as much as 4.8 months of that can be attributed to cleaner air, researchers from Brigham Young University and Harvard School of Public Health reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.

Bill to ensure end-of-route checks 
INDIANAPOLIS -School bus drivers would have to do end-of-route inspections to make sure no child is left behind under a bill endorsed by an Indiana Senate committee. 
The bill approved Wednesday would require drivers of a school bus or special purpose bus to inspect each seat at the end of each trip. Failing to do so would be a Class C infraction with a maximum penalty of a $500 fine. 
Three South Bend students were left on school buses last year, and earlier this month a 4-year-old child was left unattended inside a parked school bus in Hichmond. 
President Obama begins office duties 
Economy, Iraq, Guantanamo Bay, among others at the top of his to-do list

Wall Street bounces back from sell-off 
NEW YORK -Investors acted Wednesday as if they had overdone it a day earlier. 
Wall Street snapped back from a steep sell­off with a rebound in the same financial stocks that were pummeled Tuesday. Upbeat com­ments from banks, stronger-than-expected results from IBM Corp. and hopes that Washington will offer more help to the econo­my powered a rally that recovered most of the previous session's losses. 
The Dow Jones industrials surged nearly 280 points and all the major indexes rose more than 3.5 percent. Some bounce would have been expected after the Dow tumbled 332 points Tuesday but forecasts from PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and Bank of New York Mellon eased concerns that the troubles at financial giants like Citigroup Inc. were hitting all banks. 
Inauguration boosts newspaper sales 
NEW YORK -Barack Obama's inauguration as president gave struggling newspapers anoth­er sales boost Wednesday as readers temporari­ly looked beyond the Internet and snatched up multiple printed copies as keepsakes. 
At News World in downtown Washington, Moira Tsanga indiscriminately grabbed copies of any newspaper that had Obama splashed across the front page. 
"I'm getting some for my mother in Zimbabwe," said Tsanga, who is from the southern African country but now lives in Virginia. 
Rhonda Hazelock also stopped by seeking to commemorate Tuesday's historic event -just as she had the morning after Obama was elect­ed. She had her hands full as she clutched nine newspapers, including The Washington Post and The Washington Times. 
"I have almost all of them," Hazelock said. She planned to give some of the papers to her boss and frame the rest or use them for a scrap­book. 
The Obama-drivim demand won't lift a news­paper industry besieged by falling advertising revenue, but the one-time sales boost could help avert a layoff or two down the road, while serv­ing as a reminder that even the Internet can't replace the value of printed newspapers in marking history. 
Toyota's sales trumped GM's in 2008 
First time in 77 years tha_t General Motors has fallen from highest-selling spot 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Toyota Motor Corp. sold more cars and trucks worldwide than any other automaker last year, seizing the crow~ General Motors Corp. held for 77 years. But with its overall sales having fallen for the first time in 10 years and the entire industry mired in a slump, there's little for the Japanese com­pany to celebrate. 
GM said Wednesday it sold 8,355,947 cars and trucks around the world in 2008, falling about 616,000 vehicles short of the 8.972 million Toyota announced Tuesday. GM said the short­fall was mainly caused by the economic downturns in the U.S. and Europe that slashed vehicle demand in those major markets, where Toyota doesn't have as large of a presence. 
Mike DiGiovanni. GM's executive director of global market and industry analy­sis, downplayed the signifi­cance of the drop to No. 2, saying that the automaker is focused on profitability rather than sales volume. 

"I don't think being No. 1 in vehicle sales means much at all to the American consumer," DiGiovanni said in a conference call with reporters and analysts. "I think what matters most to the consumer is strong brands and strong products. And the key thing right now facing risks and challenges sales fell 6.5 percent, fewer vehicles than the U.S. with what the industry is not seen since the Great including a 21 percent company did that year. going through now is viabil­Depression, and he pointed plunge in the fourth quarter DiGiovanni said Toyota's ity and profitability." out that even Toyota as the global economy melt­move to the top of the sales

Liberals aren't supposed to be reli­gious. They're not supposed to buy into a young savior who explodes onto the scene. They're not supposed to wake up to join together and sing and chant 
and, yes, worship. 
The first and only time I saw Barack Obama speak live was at American University last spring, when Sen. Kennedy, Rep. 


Kennedy, and Andrew Nesi maybe-senator­to-be Kennedy endorsed the Spicy Sea now-President. Nuggets 
It was the sort of thing that probably won't go down in history-endorse­ments, as a rule, do not-but at the time, it mattered. It legitimized Obama!Kennedy comparisons, and it legitimized Obama's experience in Washington vis-a-vis Hillary. 
But for the people at the rally -like the people at most Obama rallies -it was something more. The room had an energy and excitement I usually only experience on six or seven fall Saturdays each year. 
Liberals aren't supposed to be reli­gious, but this was a religious experi­ence. We yelled about being fired up and ready to go. We chanted that yes, we could. We wanted to be part of something. 
And, sure enough, it felt like a move­ment was taking hold. This was a tent revival for young liberals. 
Obama whipped the crowd into a political frenzy. To take the religious implication to a new level, everybody drank the Obama Kool-Aid that day. When he asked for an amen, we gave him an amen. Everybody at the rally would have gone to war for Barack by

Inauguration 
the end. 
As George W. Bush took office in 
2001, David Brooks called the typical 
college student today "The 
Organization Kid." He wrote, "The new 
elite does not protest. Young achievers 
vaguely know that they are supposed to 
fe!ll guilty about not marching in the 
street for some causfl ... Today's elite 
college students don't live in that age or 
rebellion and alienation." 
The reason we didn't rebPI or protest, 
pPople said, is because our generation 
was apathetic. Passive. We didn't care 
enough. 
But Barack-sorry, President Obama 
-was supposed to make us loud. lie

supposed to make us more like our 
parents: rallying, protesting, and 
actively working for change. Hevival­
style rallies were supposed to show 
that we WPre more political than ever 
before. 
But a funny thing happened on the 
way to the Inauguration. People had it 
all wrong. For all his rallying during 
the campaign, Obama turnPd out to be 
pragmatic at heart. He isn't an ideo­
logue. He is a liberal who acknowl­
edges bravery at Khe San in his 
Inaugural Address. He wasn't born of 
protest or rebellion. 
In other words, he is one of us. He 
proves what we know: that relative 
quiet is not apathy. We're not passive 
bystanders. Just because we don't 
march doesn't mean we don't care. 
We don't "vaguely know that [we] are supposed' to feel guilty about not marching in the street for some cause." We're not supposed to feel guilty about

abroad, we Teach for America, we vote in record numbers when somebody speaks our language. 
The excitement of his campaign was not because it charged us to act like our parents generation expects. It was bPcause he spoke to us in language we understood, because he approached political activism the way we did. Tent­revival endorsement events were thrilling because Obama taps into something our generation knows, not because he was changing us. 
Obama won't make us more like our parents. Instead, he'll make our par­ents more like us. 
Of course, not everybody has realized this yet -least of all, our news media. But it is time we develop a new way to talk about politics. Trying to under­stand the impact of Obama on young people through the political lens of Vietnam and 60s-style activism makes no sense. It just doesn't work. 
This is what President Obama means when he says that "the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply." The tech­niques of political activism of the past, rooted in the "stale" ideological clashes of the past, no longer apply, either. 
It seems like President Obama gets that intuitively. We get it intuitively, too. It's time that everyone else finally catches up.

A week of reasons to hope 
Well, this week has certainly provided food for thought and a reason to get out of the regular drill. If we ever get lulled by sheer monotony, sub-zero temperatures, exhaustion or apathy into allowing the cir­cles of our thoughts 
to become circum- Kate Barrett  
scribed in narrower  
and narrower ways, will this week shake  Faithpoint  
us out of our winter­ 

in-northern.-Indiana stupor? 
The celebration of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day on January 19 could not help but be tinged with the anticipation of Barack Obama's inauguration on January 20. King could say in 1963, when the future looked desolate in so many ways for peo­ple of color, "I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; 'and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.' ... With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will ba free one day." 
Just as any other recurring event, the transition and inauguration are fraught with tradition. There are those dictated by the Constitution: the time and manner in which a new president is to be handed power, dating back to George Washington. And there are those that are much more informal, such as the precedent set Mary Todd Lincoln of wearing a white gown to the Inaugural Ball. 
There are few traditions that interest me more, however, than the assorted letters Jason Coleman written by those leaving for those arriving. This is a Man at Large tradition, depending on the position, dating back to the founding of our country. 
The most mysterious of the bunch, of course, is the letter sealed and left on the oval desk by the outgoing president. What does it say, and to what effect? In leaving the White House, James Buchanan report­edly said to Abraham Lincoln, "Ifyou are as happy entering the presidency as I am in leaving it, then you are a truly happy man." While I'm not sure Mr. Bush's will be quite as explicit, I can't help but imagine that the letter is written as a warning of the difficulties and trials facing the newest 
President Obama was all of two years 
old at the time of King's speech. We would 
probably all have to agree that now, two 
days ago on Jan. 20, when the new presi­
dent gave his inaugural address facing the 
very monument from which King spoke, 
many of the "jangling discords of our 
nation" have not been transformed. We 
aren't free today, though what binds us 
has changed. In addition to racial and eth­. nic prejudices not yet fully healed, war 
threatens to grip us like quicksand and 
economic fear and despair hover around 
us as we hear story after story of layoffs, 
foreclosures and bankruptcies, even as we 
live in a culture that refers to us all as sim­
ply "consumers." 
Tuesday's address, a mix of realism and 
hope, as well as all the events of 
Inauguration Day, reminded us that we 
are citizens, not merely consumers, a dis­
tinction which implies giving of ourselves 
rather than simply collecting what we can 
obtain or purchase. President Obama 
described the demands of citizenship: 
" ... we have duties to ourselves, our nation 
and the world; duties that we do not 
grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, 
firm in the knowledge that there is nothing 
so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our 
character, than giving our all to a difficult 
task." 
And yet as Christians, we must add 
another, even more fundamental layer of 
truth onto all the inspiring words and images the celebrations of these last few days have given us. Our faith calls us to believe that we will find all that we hope and yearn for ifwe place Jesus of Nazareth at the center of our lives. Catholics believe that we will find Jesus Christ in his Body, the Church, and that therefore the entire focus and purpose of the Church is to point the world to Christ. 

As compelling and attractive as the world seemed to find President Obama on Tuesday, it would be unfair -and foolish -to place too much hope in him. As one commentator said later that day, "He's the President, not the Messiah." President Obama's relationship with Christians of all denominations will probably remain filled with a complex mix of agreements and disagreements, unity as well as discord. Senior Catholic leaders from around the world have already praised his position on immigration at a time when many of the poorest people seeking to come to the United States are caught, with growing desperation, in the global economic down­turn whether they seek work in their home countries or here. At the same time, the new president's support of the pending Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA), which establishes abortion as a woman's "funda­mental right" throughout her nine months of pregnancy, remains an enormous, though unsurprising, disappointment. Furthermore, other aspects of his inaugu­ral address, though inspiring, lose their

member of the world's most exclusive club. 
It will warn of the inevitable time when the honeymoon wears off and the press again turns rabid. It will talk about the inevitable failures of the presidency: hav­ing new legislature blocked and Congress call your bluff. And it will foretell the times when the tasks at hand become nearly impossible, and that it is probably in these times that sentiments similar to Buchanan's arise. It might talk about the difficulty of being a mere mortal, but being compared to some of the immortals of his­tory, those whose faults history has long forgotten. 
In recent months, Mr. Bush has seemed to become far more introspective and reflective of his time in office, asi'm sure outgoing presidents are, and it's perhaps in this simple letter he can find the only audi­ence who will soon be able to understand his travails. 
There is also the distinct possibility that I am completely wrong, and it mostly just advises to be cautious of the second floor toilet; that sometimes it's necessary to jig­gle the handle. 
Another instance of letter passing that I find amusing is the Flack Jacket, a suit coat hanging in the office of the White House press secretary that holds in its pockets words of advice from every former press secretary dating back to Ron Nessen of the Ford administration. Allegedly the job of press secretary is second in difficulty job only to the chief executive himself, so I'm sure the advice left in the jacket is appreciated. 

What might the collective group of outgo­ing Bush administration front men leave as advice for Robert Gibbs? I imagine Ari Fleischer would warn against getting thrown under the bus, and to beware any­thing related to undercover CIA agents and corrupt vice presidential chiefs of staff. 
Scott McClellan probably talked about the horrors of working in the White House, and may have even mentioned future intent to make a fool out of himself. He might have explained the difficulties of working in an environment where a con­flict of conscience can arise. But he cer­tainly didn't allude to confronting those issues; it's better to wait and make a hefty profit. 
The latest secretary, Dana Perino, most likely would give the best piece of informa­tion: Beware speaking off the cuff, and keep it simple. That way you can avoid proclaiming, in reference to Mr. Bush's low poll numbers, "Both the president and the vice president have long believed, and it's a part of what has made them the leaders that they are, which is not to chase popl!­larity polls but to hold themselves to a standard that requires people not to like them." Ouch. 
The newest, and perhaps my favorite incarnation of the letter writing tradition began this cycle when the Bush twins credibility in light of his willingness to back FOCA. "People will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy," he stated. Does this not apply to each and every one of us as much as to the foreign leaders he addressed? 
Today, perhaps even as you're reading this, the March for Life fills the very same National Mall in Washington, D.C. where Martin Luther King spoke 46 years ago and President Obama took the oath of office just two days ago. The United States Bishops ask us to pray for and defend "the basic rights of those who are weakest and most marginalized: the poor, the homeless, the innocent unborn, and the frail and eld­erly who need our respect and assistance." 
We may find much hope for the future in the words and the person of Barack Obama, and in taking note of how far we've come since Martin Luther King, Jr. told the nation and the world that he had a dream. We can't risk forgetting, l'iowever, that all our hopes will only truly come to fruition as we seek together to find and follow the person and example of Jesus Christ.

penned a letter of advice for the incoming Obama girls, Sasha and Malia. Speculation is not necessary for this letter; it was quickly reported and published along with some of the highlights. The girls warned that over time people will come to think differently, sometimes for the better, some­times for the worst, but to always remem­ber who your father is, not the sketch or image in the newspapers. 
They emphasized the "magical" aspects of living in the White House. I'm not entire­ly sure how the "magical" experiences of the 27 year old twins, who were 18 and going to college at inauguration, wholly relate to 7 year old Sash a and 10 year old Malia, but I'm sure they have something to offer. 
They emphasized the importance of first daughter experiences, such as sliding "down the banister of the solarium ... and playing sardines on the White House lawn." I actually also heard there was an unpublished postscript: Until you're 21, watch the bar scene. With a full secret service escort, you'll draw some attention. 
That's probably the most prudent advice of all.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR  
Fairness in hiring  
Charles Rice's editorial on "Catholic identity" and Notre Dame arrives, by a circuitous route, at the conclusion that the University's president should "veto" appointments of faculty candi­dates who are not Catholic. Unless one believes that it is in the interest of the Church in America to have the coun­try's leading Catholic university bereft . of academic credibility, Rice's proposal is most unwise. It is also unwarranted. Rice seems determined to blame Notre Dame's commitment to excel­ lence as a research university for vari­ous ills, including driving up the cost of undergraduate education. In fact, costs have risen comparably at good private colleges, without graduate stu­dents or major research agendas. · Compare Notre Dame's $46,600, for example, to Amherst College's estimat· ed $51,000 to $53,000, Kenyon College's $47,000, the College of William and Mary's $40,000, and Holy Cross College's $49,000. More to the point, he blames the pursuit of  "research repute" for a putative lack of concern for teaching, citing the claim of an unnamed "liberal arts pro­fessor" that undergraduate teaching is irrelevant in promotion decisions. In fact, teaching is weighed very heavily in all the liberal arts I know, through faculty efforts, careful consideration of student evaluations, and labor-inten­sive peer observation and mentoring. It is not just Notre Dame's "research repute" but its reputation for intellec­tual seriousness and its influential  leadership that would vanish overnight if Rice's advice were fol­lowed. Vetoing appointments on the basis of faith would be imprudent. In view of Notre Dame's stated commitment to fairness in hiring, it would also be unethical.

NCAA BASKETBALL 
Hokies hand No.1 Wake first loss of season 
. . 
Michigan State upset at home by Northwestern behind Coble's 31; Gamecocks knock offFlorida with buzzer beater 
Associated Press 
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. ____:. Virginia Tech made sure there are no unbeaten teams left in Division 
I. 
Malcolm Delaney scored 21 points and the Hokies held on to upset No. 1 Wake Forest 78-71 on Wednesday night. 
A.D. Vassallo and Jeff Allen added 16 points apiece for the Hokies (12-6, 3-1 Atlantic Coast Conference}. They led nearly from the opening tip to the final buzzer, pushed their lead to 16 and made it stand up for their first victory over a No. 1 team since they beat North Carolina two sea~ons ago in Blacksburg. 
Jeff' Teague scored 23 points and James Johnson added 18 before fouling out with 1:17 remaining for Wake Forest (16-1, 3-1), which was playing as the nation's top-ranked team for the first time since November 2004. 
The Demon Deacons' early 16­point deficit was by far their biggest of the season, and they trailed by 10 at halftime before they m&de it a game again. They used a 14-4 run early in the sec­ond half that brought them within single digits, then cut it to two twice in the final 4 minutes -the last coming when Teague's 3­pointer with 1:49 remaining made it 71-69. 
But Delaney hit two free throws 7 seconds later and the Hokies allowed one field goal after that to clinch one of the biggest victories in school history. 
Virginia Tech improved to 2-7 against top-ranked teams-and continued its dominance of the Demon Deacons. The Hokies have won five of their last six meetings with Wake Forest. 
The Demon Deacons' school­record 16-0 start is history, and its next home game-a Jan. 28 showdown with Duke -suddenly looks less appealing now that it might not be a 1-vs.::2 matchup. 
L.D. Williams finished with 12 points and Al-Farouq Aminu added 10 for Wake Forest, which looked nothing like the nation's top-ranked team early on. 
That's largely because the Hokies' physical defense took the Demon Deacons out oftheir game. 
Virginia Tech erased its only lead of the half by outscoring them 23-6 over an 11-minute span, going up 30-14 on Victor Davila's layup with 4:18 remaining. 
Wake Forest didn't attempt a free throw in the first half-while the Hokies were 10-for-14 from the stripe -and for a stretch of 13 minutes, Teague was the only Demon Deacon to score. The rest of his teammates were a com­bined 0-f'or-9 during that span. 
Northwestern 70, Michigan State63 
Kevin Coble scored 31 points and Northwestern stunned No. 7 Michigan State on Wednesday night, ending the Spartans' 28­game home-court winning streak. 
The Wildcats (10-6, 2-4 Big Ten) used clutch 3-point shooting and an aggressive 1-3-1 zone to beat a turnover-plagued Michigan State team that got little from leading scorer Haymar Morgan. 
Averaging 14.8 poinl<> per game entering Wednesday, Morgan did not start because of lingering flu­like symptoms. He came off the bench early in the first half but finished with only one point in 18 minutes. 
Michael Thompson had 20 points for Northwestern. Kalin Lucas led the Spartans (15-3, 5-1) with 20 points. 
Michigan State's home-court winning streak had been tied for third-longest in the nation. Only Notre Dame (45) and Kansas (35) had longer runs. 
Wednesday's game was the 300th played at the Breslin Center, Michigan State's on-campus arena that opened for the 1989-90 sea­son. The Spartans are 262-38 in the building, winning 87 percent of the time. 
Michigan State's 5-0 start in the Big Ten was its best in conference action since 1977-78, when the Spartans opened with seven straight wins. 
But Northwestern, relying on its aggressive defense and Coble's 19­point first half, trailed just 34-33 at halftime. 
The Wildcats grabbed a 44-39 lead when Coble nailed a runner in the lane with 13:33 remaining. His leaning, 3-pointer off the glass just moments earlier had broken a 39-all tie. 
Northwestern's lead grew to 48­43 with 9:22 left on a turnaround jumper by Luka Mirkovic. 
Michigan State fought back to take a 49-48 lead on a pair of free throws by Durrell Summers. But back-to-hack 3s by Craig Moore and Thompson gave Northwestern a 54-49 lead with 
6:31 remaining. 
The Spartans trimmed the lead to 57-55 on Lucas' 3-pointer with about 4:30 remaining, but Moore responded with a 3-pointer with 
3:54 left to put the Wildcats ahead 60-55. 
Coble's basket gave Northwestern a 62-55 edge with 
2:14 left. The Wildcats made just enough free throws down the stretch to hold off a Michigan State comeback. 
Moore finished with 11 points. Goran Suton had 15 points and 14 rebounds for the Spartans. 
Connecticut 89, Villanova 83 
A.J. Price scored a career-high 29 points to lead No. 3 Connecticut to its sixth straight victory, over No. 20 Villanova on Wednesday night. 
Jerome Dyson added 19 points and Jeff Adrien had 12 points and 14 rebounds, his fourth· double­double in as many games, for the Huskies (17 -1, 6-1 Big East), who 

improved to 5-1 this season 
against ranked teams, with the 
only loss coming at home to 
Georgetown. 
Dwayne Anderson had 15 points 
for the Wildcats (14-4, 2-3), who 
have dropped three of five, with 
all the losses to fellow ranked 
teams in the Big East. 
The matchup of teams ranked in the league's top five in defense looked nothing like that as the first half ended tied at 48. The defense picked up on both sides in the sec­ond half, although both teams allowed more than 20 points over their season average. 
· Price, the fifth-year senior whose career has been marred by a life-threatening brain injury, a season-long school suspension over on-campus thefts and major surgery after a knee injury in last season's NCAA tournament, had 20 points in the first hall'. He hit all of Connecticut's four 3-pointers in tl1e game, finishing 4-for-6 beyond the arc. 
His previous career high was 26 points against Notre Dame last season and his best outing this season was 24 points in a win over Gonzaga. This was the third time in Price's career he had 20 points in consecutive games -he had 23 in Sunday's win over Seton Hall. 
Price was 1 0-of'-13 from the 
field and had five rebounds and 
five assists. 

The Huskies used a 10-0 run to 
go up 66-59 on a drive by Dyson 
with 13:24 to play. 
Reggie Redding of Villanova hit a 3-pointer to cut the margin to four, but Price answered with his only 3 of the second half with 12:04left to make it 69-62. 

Connecticut's biggest lead came at 75-64 on a free throw by Kemba Walker with 7:42 to go, but the Wildcats managed to get back to 84-81 on a 3 by Scottie Reynolds with 28 seconds to go. The Huskies went 5-of-6 from the free throw line the rest of the way. 
Reynolds had 14 points for the Wildcats, who had won their last two meetings and three of four against Connecticut, while Antonio Pena, Redding and Corey Stokes all had 12. 
Adrien's double-double was the 41st of the senior's career and his eighth this season. 
Dante Cunningham, Villanova's leading scorer and rebounder with averages of 17.4 and 7.4, fouled out with 8:16 to play and fi!Ushcd with six points and three rebounds. 
These teams met in the same building in 2002 with Connecticut winning 46-40. 
South Carolina 70, Florida 69 
Zam Fredrick's layup as time expired lifted South Carolina to 70-69 victory over No. 24 Florida. 
The Gamecocks (13-4, 2-2 Southeastern Conference) trailed 67-60 with less than three min­utes left. Devan Downey began the comeback with four straight foul shots and his 3-pointer with 26.5 seconds left cut the lead to 69-6 7. 
After Nick Calathes missed a foul shot, Fredrick had the ehance to tie the game as he-went to the line with 4.7 seconds to go but missed his second attempt. 
Chandler Parsons had the chance to ice it at the line for Florida with 3.3 seconds remain­ing. He, too, missed the foul shot. 
Mike Holmes rebounded the miss, and threw a long pass to the streaking Fredrick who laid the ball in as time expired. 
The loss ended the 10-game win streak of Florida (16-3, 3-1). 
Calathes led Florida with 20 points. However, only two of those came in the final 11 minutes as the Gators watched their lead shrink. 
Downey finished with 20 points and Fredrick 15 for South Carolina, which defeated the Gators for the first time since the 2006 regular season. 
Florida got back in the national rankings this week -the SEC's only representative in the top 25 -due in part to its long win streak. 
And it looked as if the Gators did just enough down the stretch to hold off South Carolina and first­year coach Darrin Horn. 
Evaldus Baniulis' fourth and final 3 got the Gamecocks within 62-60. But then Chandler Parsons answered with a 3 of his own and Walter Hodge extended the mar­gin with an inside basket. 
Calathes looked like he had saved the day with his reverse from beneath the basket with 35.4 seconds to go to make it 69-64. 
Then Downey, the SEC's second­leading scorer at 19.6 points a game, shook off a poor shooting night with a floating 3 to set up the crazy fmal moments. 
Fredrick's momentum after the winning bucket carried him into the crowd and his tea!11mates fol­lowed. 
Baniulis had 12 points, all on 3­pointers.

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. ­Wayne Ellington had another big game against Clemson, and No. 5 North Carolina added another year of misery to the lOth-ranked Tigers' streak of futility in Chapel HilL 
Ellington had 25 points to help the Tar Heels beat the Tigers 94·70 on Wednesday night, keep­ing North Carolina per­fect in 54 home games against Clemson. 
Tyler Hansbrough added 20 points for the Tar Heels (17-2, 3-2 Atlantic Coast Conference), whose 54-0 run against the Tigers here is an NCAA record for the longest home winning streak against one opponent. North Carolina took control late in the first half and used a 24-4 run span­ning the break to build an 18-point lead early in the second half. 

Clemson (16-2, 2-2) never got closer than 13 the rest of the way and trailed by as many as 27 points. It was the Tigers' second consecutive defeat after a 16-0 start, following Saturday's home loss to Wake Forest that propelled the Demon Deacons to the No. 1 ranking this week. 
Ellington was coming off a 23-point perform­ance last weekend against Miami in which he hit eight straight shots in the second half, seven from behind the arc, after a slow start to the season. He followed that by picking up where he left off in last year's season-long torture of the Tigers. 
Ellington averaged 29 points in three meetings against Clemson last sea­son, including a career­high 36 and the last-sec­ond 3-pointer on the road for the win in the first meeting. This time, he finished 9-for-15 from the field to go with a career-high seven assists and six rebounds. 
It marked the first time in his career that he's had consecutive 20-point games. 
With Ellington redis­covering his shot, North Carolina's offense looked about as sharp as it has in weeks despite Hansbrough being rela­tively quiet against Clemson's physical front­line until the game was in hand. North Carolina shot 53 percent for the game, while Deon Thompson -after fail­ing to reach double fig­ures in the first four con­ference games -had 15 points. 

IN BRIEF Jeff Kent to announce 
retirement at 40 

LOS ANGELES -Jeff Kent plans to announce his retirement from baseball on Thursday at Dodger Stadium. 
Kent spent 17 years in the major leagues and leaves as the career home­run leader among second basemen with 351, 7 4 more than Ryne Sandberg. 
He spent the last four seasons with the Dodgers, hitting .291 with 122 dou­bles, 75 homers and 311 RBis. Los Angeles issued a statement Wednesday announcing the news conference. 
A five-time All-Star and the 2000 NL MVP, Kent hit .253 during the first half of last season, improved to .353 in August, then injured his knee on Aug. 29 and had surgery four days later. He returned to make the postseason roster, but was relegated to a bench role. He went a combined 0-for-9 with four strikeouts during the two playoff series and became a free agent in November. 
He'll be replaced at second base by Blake DeWitt, who took over when Kent was sidelined. 
Olympic champion
Dementieva into 3rd round 
MELBOURNE, Australia -Olympic champion· Elena Dementieva improved her 2009 winning streak to 12 matches on Thursday, beating Iveta Benesova 6-4, 6-1 to reach the third round of the Australian Open. 
Dementieva, who won titles at Auckland and Sydney before the sea­son's first major, struggled with her serve early but recovered to finish the match in 72 minutes. 
The 27-year-old Dementieva reached the French Open and U.S. Open finals in 2004, beaten both times by fellow Russians, and has not returned to the championship of a Grand Slam tournament since. 
Her highlight last year was a win over fellow Russian Dinara Safina in the gold medal match at the Beijing Olympics. She was ousted in the semifinals at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 2008 and has never advanced beyond the fourth round at Melbourne Park. 
Fis:tht between Pacquiao
ana Hatton off for now 
LAS VEGAS Manny Pacquiao's refusal to accept terms already agreed to by his promoter has apparently scuttled the planned May 2 fight between him and Rritish fighter Ricky Hatton. 
Promoters for both fighters said Wednesday the fight is off, with little chance of it being revived. 
"You never say never, but right now it's off," said Bob Arum, who promotes Pacquiao. "Hatton's shopping around for a new oppo­nent now." 
Arurri said the original agree­ment was for the two fighters to split their shares 50-50, with Pacquiao having a $12 million guarantee. That deal fell through when Pacquiao demanded the bigger percentage, and a new agreement called for him to get 52 percent of the purse.

NBA 
Villanueva, Bucks run over Mavericks 
Prince's strong third quarter leads Pistons to win 
Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE Charlie VIllanueva had 32 points and 10 rebounds and Michael Redd added 27 points, lifting the Milwaukee Bucks to a 133-99 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night and snapping a two-game losing skid. 
The Bucks didn't have Andrew Bogut for the fourth straight game due to back spasms. But after a 1-2 West Coast trip, they didn't need his physical presence or rebounding at home. 
Milwaukee shot 69 percent for the fmal three quarters en route to a season-best 133 points and handed Dallas its worst loss of the season to halt the Mavericks' two-game winning streak. 
Dallas gave up midway through the fourth, with coach Rick Carlisle taking out both Jason Kidd. who finished with 18 points, and Dirk Nowitzki, who went 7 -of-16 from the field and 16-of-17 from the free-throw line to finish with 30. 
The duo even walked onto the court toward the locker room before the final seconds ticked off. 
Ramon Sessions added 21 points and Richard Jefferson scored 15 for Milwaukee. 
Kidd hit a 3-pointer to tie it at 67 early in the third quarter, but Dan Gadzuric, who started with seven straight misses, tipped in a shot and Redd began to fmd his stroke, hitting 3-pointers on three straight possessions to spark a 19-2 run. 
Redd wasn't fmished. 
With Nowitzki guarding him on a switch, the veteran guard did a quick crossover for a little space and then hit a 16-foot jumper while fading to the base­line. 
Then Redd used a pump fake to shake his defender, burying another jumper over Nowitzki. Moments later, Villanueva was left uncovered for a 3-pointer that made it 97-7 6. 
Nowitzki, who had his left thumb taped early in the second quarter, scored 14 points in the third, including a jumper that made it 101-85 heading into the fourth quarter, but Dallas never made a run leaving Mavs owner Mark Cuban shaking his head just behind the bench. 
Detroit 95, Toronto 76 
Tayshaun Prince scored 12 of his 25 points in the third quarter, helping the Detroit Pistons pull away from the Toronto Raptors in a 95-76 win Wednesday night. 
Prince's play overshadowed the story of the game. 
The Pistons used Richard Hamilton as a reserve after the All-Star shooting guard started his first 611 games, including the playoffs, in his seven seasons with the team. 
Detroit coach Michael Curry inserted 6-foot-9 forward Amir Johnson in place of Hamilton and kept superstar Allen Iverson in the starting lineup. 
Chris Bosh had 19 points for the Raptors, who have lost seven straight. 
Prince led a balanced attack for the Pistons, who won their second in a row after losing five consecutive. 
Rodney Stuckey scored 17 points, Jason Maxiell had season highs in points (16) and rebounds (11), Iverson scored 11 and reserve Antonio McDyess had 10 points and eight rebounds. 
Hamilton scored seven points in his first game off the bench since Feb. 1, 2002, when he was playing for the Washington Wizards. The following offsea­son, they traded him to Detroit for Jerry Stackhouse. 
Toronto's Andrea Bargnani scored 16 points and reserve Jermaine O'Neal had 11 points, playing for just the second time in 13 games. O'Neal has been slowed by a sore right knee. 
The slumping Raptors got ofT to a solid start, leading 22-17 after the first quarter and trail­ing by three at halftime. 
Prince helped the Pistons dom­inate in the third as they outscored Toronto 30-19 to earn a cushion big enough to set up an easy fourth quarter. 
Hornets 102, New Jersey 92 
Chris Paul narrowly missed his fifth triple-double of the season with 29 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, and the New Orleans Hornets defeated the New Jersey Nets 102-92 on Wednesday night. 
Peja Stojakovic had 20 points and 10 rebounds. 
Vince Carter scored 20 for the Nets, who lost their fourth straight, unable to take advan­tage of the absence of Hornets starters Tyson Chandler (left ankle) and David West (back spasms). 
Stojakovic adjusted his perimeter game to make up for the Hornets' lack of size, sneak­ing inside to grab double-digit rebounds for the first time all season. 
Rasual Butler added 14 points for New Orleans, which has won three straight. Julian Wright had 11 points and James Posey 10. 
Bobby Simmons scored 16 points for the Nets and Keyon Dooling added 12, while rookie Ryan Anderson grabbed a career-high 10 rebounds and Jarvis Hayes added 10 points. 
New Orleans put the Nets in a deep hole with a 16-2 run that started with Melvin Ely's reverse layup early in the third quarter. Stojakovic and Posey each added 3-pointers during the spurt and Paul converted a spinning layup as he was grabbed by Carter, though no foul was called. 
It was a poor start for the Nets, who started 3-of-12 from the field and turned the ball over five times, including three times on offensive fouls. 
Down by 15 in the fmal period, the Nets made one last charge with a 9-2 run ignited by Dooling's third 3 of the game and capped by Carter's putback, cutting New Orleans' lead to 91­85 with 3:33 left. 
After Paul hit a pull-up in the lane, Simmons' third 3 of the game cut it to 93-88 with 2:24 to go. New Jersey missed its next two shots, and Paul hit a run­ning floater as he was fouled with 59 seconds left, giving New Orleans a 96-88 lead. Paul then added a fast-break, one-handed dunk to punctuate his dominant night.

"We have the fight and the drive and we just kept pushing today," guard Ashley Barlow said in the post-game news con­ference Saturday. 
"We had to keep fighting, and if we wouldn't have fought, it definitely WOJ,Jidn't have been pretty," freshman forward Erica Solomon said. 
It is easy to say that the Irish have that fighting spirit-and even easier after a gutsy victory like the one Saturday-but the real question is "Why wasn't it there earlier in the game?'' The younger players need to under­stand quickly that you can't start fighting once the game is close and late, but from the first whistle to the last. Letting teams back into games when they don't deserve to be is the best way to start losing. 
The Irish are lucky that their opponent Saturday was only St. John's. That is not to say the Red Storm are a bad team, but in this year's Big East, they are a team the Irish could have ­ing weeks. 
For point guard Melissa Lechlitner, it is a matter of when -not if-the team will find its defensive energy and intensity. 
"[The freshmen] all have [a killer instinct], it's just a matter of it coming at the right time and each person having the con­fidence to just know it's game time and we have to get that win no matter what," she said. 
But on a team as young and injured as the Irish are (having only one senior and lost two players to ACL injuries), they will need to find that quickly for the team to survive the upcom­ing conference schedule. Waiting around for the younger players to realize when they need to play hard will lead to more nailbiters -and not all of them can fall Notre Dame's way.

Blues top host Blackhawks 
Associated Press 

CHICAGO -Chris Mason 
and the St. Louis Blues put in 
all together for a night. 
Mason made 21 saves for his 
second shutout of the season, 
and Jeff Woywitka and Keith 
Tkachuk scored in the Blues' 
2-0 victory over Chicago on 
Wednesday night. 
Mason was not heavily tested in earning his 14th career shutout as the injury-depleted Blues outworked Chicago and limited the Blackhawks' chances. 
"In order for us to be suc­cessful, we have to work very hard and we did that tonigh.t," ·Mason said. "We did a great job in our zone, did a great job on the penalty kill and did 
what it took tonight. 
"They let me see the shots, 
cleared the rebounds, were 
tough in front of the net, they 
were tough in the corners, 
they cleared the puck. We just 
battled hard and we're start­
ing the see the results." 
The Blues have the fewest 
points in the Western 
Conference -and seven play­
ers on injured reserve, includ­
ing forwards Paul Kariya and 
Andy McDonald, and defense­
man Eric Brewer and Erik 
Johnson. On Wednesday night, 
they made up for it with con­
sistent effort and close check­
ing. 

"Tonight I thought we played 
smart, took their space away," 
St. Louis coach Andy Murray 
said. "We wanted to come into 
this building (the United 
Center), which has a great deal 
of energy, .and wanted to suck 
it up." 1 
Cristobal Huet made 27 
saves for Chicago, shut out at 
home -and before a 23rd 
sellout crowd in 23 games this 
season -for the first time 
since March 12, 2008. The 
Blackhawks have lost two 
straight games at United 
Center in regulation to drop to 
14-4-5 at home. 
Mason made one of his few tough saves just 2:45 into the first, stopping Andrew Ladd from the edge of the crease. The goalie needed to be alert during goalmouth serums a . few times in the second and third, but Chicago generated 
little sustained pressure. 
The Blackhawks entered the 
game averaging 3.45 goals, 
but have scored just five in 
their last four. After going 10­
1-1 in December, they're 5-5-1 
in January. 
"We didn't come out playing 
the way we should have for 
consecutive nights," Chicago 
captain Jonathan Toews said. 
"We know what kind of team 
we are, we showed it in 
December. We want to keep 
going down that path." 
On Wednesday, the 
Blackhawks were clearly 
detoured. 
"We're disappointed with 
tonight's effort," Chicago coach 
Joel Quenneveille said. "You 
can use a lot of different words to describe tonight's game. Bad would be one." 
"I think we're getting sick and tired of people telling us how good we are instead of how hard we worked," he added. "I think that's what.'s going to get us out of it." 
Thanks to three power-play chances -including a 5­minute advantage set up by a major penalty to Chicago's Cam Barker for a hit on David Backes -the Blues outshot the Blackhawks 16-3 in the first period. However, they led only 1-0 after 20 minutes. 
The Blues didn't beat Huet until Woywitka scored a power-play goal on their 16th shot with 1:55 left in the first. Woywitka's drive from the point slid over lluet's left pad and into the net. 
Following a scoreless second, Chicago's Matt Walker poked a rebound of his own shot under Mason and into the net at 2:46 of the third. The goal was not allowed, however, because one of the referees had whistled the play dead when Mason covered the original shot with his pad. 
Tkachuk made it 2-0 during a 4-on-4 at 7:28 of the third. From the edge of the crease, he stuffed a shot between Huet's pads. 
A shot by Chicago's Martin Havlat hit the post at 10:33 of the third. Mason made a point­blank save on Dave Bolland during a Chicago power-play with 4:25 left.

The Mavericks have also taken advantage of a relatively easy early-season schedule to propel to the top of the confer­ence.

Michigan (20 pts, 16-8-0, 10­6-0-0) 
Casual college hock1~y fans may be surprised to see the Wolverines this low in the standings, but after losing some key players from last year's Frozen Four team, Red Berenson's team has undergone some understandable growing pains. However, after back-to­hack wins against Miami on Jan. 10 and 11, the Maize and Blue appear ready to make a late season push. Games against Notre Dame, Nebraska-Omaha, and Ohio Stat£1 stand out as potential roadblocks to Michigan's quest for a second consecutive CCI-IA title.

With a relatively easy sched­ule the rest of the way, the Bulldogs seem poised to make a run towards a top-four spot. Only a final-weekend series against Michigan could pose a problem.

While anything can happen in the conference tournament, the Falcons, Wildcats, and Broncos appear to pose little threat to any of the top teams. The sea­son has been especially disap­pointing for Northern Michigan, who was picked to finish fourth in the CCIIA after a third-place showing in last year's tourna­ment.

Irish lead C.CHA, but plenty ofgames to play 
By SAM WERNER Sports Wrirer 
With only a third of the sea­son remaining in CCHA play, the conference standings are beginning to take shape. 
The important cutoffs are between fourth and fifth place and eighth and ninth place. 
The top four teams receive a first-round bye and host a sec­ond-round series in the CCHA playoffs, and the next four seeds host a first-round confer­ence playoff series. 
The CCHA tournament's first round is set for the weekend of March 6-8, and the second round follows the next week­end. Each of the first two rounds consists of a best-of­three series. 
The final four teams will trav­el to Detroit. where the semifi­nals will be held on March 20 at Joe Louis Arena -home of the NHL's Detroit Red Wings. The CCHA tournament champi­onship game will be played the

MIAA leaders win again 
By ALEX. WEST 
Sports Wrirer 
Saint Mary's started its !'our­game road trip the right way Wednesday night, cruising to a 81-63 road victory over winless Kalamazoo. 
Senior forward Erin Newsom and freshman guard Patsy Mahoney each scored 14 points to help the Belles (9-7, 7-1 MlAA) stay atop the conference stand­ings. 
The Belles jumped out to a 17­4 lead after just live minutes and never trailed. 
The Hornets were able to cut the lead to eight with six minutes to play in the tirst half, but the Bolles responded with a 15-8 run to take a 44-29 half'time lead. 
In the second· half, the Belles put the game away early, leading by 23 with 14 minutes to play in the contest. The Hornets never cut the gap closer than 18 poinL<; lor the rest of the contest. 
Offense wasn't a probh~m for the Belles with four players scor­ing in double ligures. 
Liz Wade also added seven assisL<; and recorded six steals to  help out def(msively. 
The Hornets' Andrea Bedway led all scorers with 22 points. 
The Belles followed through on head coach Jenn Henley's prom­ise to focus on defense, holding the Hornets to shoot less than 40 percent from the field. The Belles also forced 36 turnovers in the game. 
The Belles play their second game of their road trip Saturday ' at Trine. Saint Mary's' next home contest is Feb. 4 against Olivet.
