Soviet leader could be ousted: defector 
By ROB HENNIG Senior Staff Reporter 
The highest ranking Soviet official ever to defect to the West said he would not be surprised if Soviet leader Mik­hail Gorbechev would be removed as head of the Soviet Union. 
Speaking to a capacity crowd at Washington Hall, Arkady Shevchenko indicated he "would not say that ( Gorbechev) was as solidly strong as one can believe. 
"I think Gorbechev's rela­tions with the Soviet army are rather shaky," Shevchenko continued. "It's a tradition of the Soviet leaders not to show to the world that there are dis­agreements." 
He indicated that the Soviet military has a 15-to 20-year cycle in which there is a major modernintion program. 
"In one or two years a crucial decision will have to be taken whether there will be a new cycle of Soviet development of weapon systems and that will be a moment when military may request quite a lot of things," Shevchenko said. 
"If he would like to improve the civilian sector of the Soviet economy, he might have a problem with the Soviet mili­tary." 
Shevchenko said Gorbechev was the first Soviet leader born after 1917, making him a full product of the Soviet system. As such, "We should not harbor any illusions that Gorbechev is really a closet liberal, that Gor­bechev is intent in really changing the Soviet Union," Shevchenko said. 
He continued, "Gorbechev is a true communist. We should not forget about this. He is a man who believes in the future of the Soviet system." 
According to Shevchenko,

South Africa has reached a new high in human rights violations, including torture and assaults by police, according to a U.N. report released Tuesday. The report listed about 10,000 arrests without charge or trial, includ­ing arrests of children under the age of 15, and "numerous allegations of acts of torture" by security forces. It said children were particularly affected by the situation, des­cribed as the "most serious ever in the history" of South Mrica. -Associated Press

Georgetown proves not all Catholic universities alike 
There's Notre Dame and Saint Mary's ... and then there's Georgetown University. Some might say a Catholic university is a Catholic university is a Catholic university. 
Call the SMCs, wake the Domers, rattle the Hoyas because this preconception, my friends, is not so. 
If you have ever studied dipolarity in Intro to Chemistry 101, then the great disparity be­tween the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's campuses and the university overlook:ing the Potomac serves as a fitting illustration of this theory. 
Living on the Georgetown campus last sum­mer for three months awakened me to the various definitions a "Catholic university" can connote. Mter living in the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's community for three years, I was taken aback with the liberality that seemed to hang like a fog above the Hoyas' turf. 
For example, the Georgetown student gov­ernment, one evening, sponsored a keg party on the steps of the administration building. The thought of sipping a beer under the radiance of the Golden Dome made me laugh as I tossed it out as merely a momentary brain cramp. 
A stronger eye-opener came upon experienc­ing the Georgetown University Pub. There, the differing policies administered by Georgetown and Notre Dame and Saint Mary's became more apparent. With the legal drinking age set at 19 in the District of Columbia, most second semester freshmen theoretically could be served alcohol in this establishment (which is located in the basement of their administration building). 
The protected Notre Dame-Saint Mary's en­vironment, which adamently attempts to foster, Catholic ideals through administering rigid standards like the alcohol policy runs a collision course with the alcohol freedom permitted by Georgetown, also a "Catholic" institution. 
While the absence of an alcohol policy at Georgetown opens the widest disparity between the two "Catholic" atmospheres, other differ­ences also exist. While the lack of co-ed dorms at Notre Dame is always bone for contention, the presence of them at Georgetown is an ob­vious distinction. And not too surprisingly, Georgetown continues to maintain its Catholic label without a system of parietals. The selling of "Playboy" magazine :in their campus bookstore, however, serves as the ultimate icing on the cake. 
Examining the extremes taken on the spec­trum of Catholic institutions begs an answer to the question: Just what basic qualities make a university Catholic? It certainly is not the pres­ence or the lack of parietals, or of an alcohol policy, or of co-ed dorms. 

Then, just why do they differ so? 
Some might attribute Georgetown's gover­nance by the Jesuits as cause for its liberal atmosphere. Or some might say Notre Dame's and Saint Mary's location in the conservative midwest is reason enough for its more regi­mented "Catholic" environment. 
But these theories only touch the surface. Three weeks ago, Father Richard McBrien, chairman of the Notre Dame theology depart­ment said, "Our department is as Catholic as Catholic can be," and Georgetown's adminis­tration undoubtedly believes nothing less of its institution and its teaching. 
Then is the mere adjective "Catholic" enough to merit the similar distinctions that Geor­getown, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's so proudly share? While all three institutions begin with a framework consisting of a com­munity of scholars who work to serve intellec­tual, spiritual and cultural development, a mys­terious cloud continues to hang between the two campus environments. 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's seem to share a unique mystique distinctly not present at Georgetown. Whether you like it or not, there's a sort of special Notre Dame-Saint Mary's cam­araderie. It's an aura definitely not present on the loosely knit, Yuppie Catholic Georgetown campus. 
The Hoyas and the Irish will never be inter­changeable and a Catholic university is not a Catholic university is not a Catholic university.

Network anticipates May meeting of ND trustees 

By JOE MARKEY Staff Reporter 
The Anti-Apartheid Network has gained a second wind as anticipation mounts concern­ing the May meeting of Notre Dame's Board of Trustees, ac­cording to the group's chair­person, Margarita Rose. 
"A lot of people were dis­couraged with the Board's decision to postpone their as­sessment of divestment, but now realize the need to make their voices heard again," Rose said. 
In November, the Board decided to completely reassess the University's investment policy, and vote on it during its May meeting. According to Rose, the group is hopeful for a positive outcome at the May meeting. 
A growing number of stu­dents seem to be realizing the importance of the issue, Rose said. Almost 100 signed their names to the group at the recent Social Concerns Fes­, tival at the Center for Social

According to Rose, a workshop was held on Feb. 3 with the purpose of "educating people about apartheid in South Africa." 
"Many people are still not sure about the facts; the workshop gave them the oppor­tunity to have their questions answered," she said. 
Rose said she thinks many people are afraid to get in­volved because they don't know the facts about divestment. "It is a complicated issue," she said. 
Upcoming events include continued Friday afternoon vigils on the steps of the Ad­ministration Building, and the National Week of · Anti­Apartheid Action. 

During the week of March 23­April 4, groups across the na­tion will join in an effort to ex­press concern over the South African apartheid policy, Rose explained. "A lecture by Fa­ther Mulussi, an Anglican priest from South Africa, will highlight the week" on the campus, said Rose. "Films will be shown also." 
Groody, chairman of the pro­gram. 
Groody said the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Right-to­Life group will sponsor the event, which donates all of the money raised to the Women's Care Center, for the third straight year. "In years past we've raised anywhere from $20,000 to $30,000," said Groody. 
The Women's Care Center is a pro-life pregnancy help cen­ter dedicated to assisting wo­men with problem pregnancies by offering free pregnancy testing, crisis counseling, and referrals to other social service organizations, according to literature from the center, Groody said. 
The Center, established in 1983 as an outgrowth of the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Right-to-Life organization, serves about 125 women each month, according to Groody. "So many people need the Care Cert~r that they are trying to exr-tud to one or even two new car · ct_ ·~:r:;," he added. 
"Ta__ ...............-a-thon is an at­tempt to provide an alternative for abortion and at the same time raise money for the wo­men who need the services of the care center," Groody said. 
"I think I'd like to reach 
$30,000, if we can get over 
$30,000 it would be good," 
Groody said. 
Approximately 7,000 poten­tial donors were sent letters containing information about the Women's Care Center and a note from Lou Holtz, the honorary chairperson. 

Also important to the fund­raising effort are student dona­tions. "In years past, just in collection alone we were able to raise $3,000," said Groody. Father Hesburgh, University president, has agreed to con­tribute $1,000 from an adminis­tration fund for every $3,000 earned through student dona­tions, Groody said.

first of these, the expectant fac­ulty member would be given no workload for the semester and receive one-half pay. The second would involve a halved workload and full pay, he said. 
The other two, he said, in­volve parental leave, regard­less of sex. One of these entails no workload and half-pay, the other half a normal workload and seventy-five percent pay. 
Research which led to the proposal was headed up by Co­chairman of the Benefits Com­mittee Terese Ghilarducci. According to Ghilarducci, the issue "came up last year" when a male faculty member chose to adopt a child through Catholic Social Services. Due to the constraints of the current policy, his wife was forced to quit her job to care for the newly adopted child, she said. 
According to Ghilarducci, the University is concerned but does not yet have provisions for such cases. Faculty Senate 
chairman Jean Pee confirmed the need for such provisions, saying several faculty mem­bers have adopted in the past. 
Pee said she is "gratified . with the response of the Sen­ate," and Flint also expressed a hopeful attitude about the success of the recommendation so far. 
Flint said "all are fairly hopefull" that the proposal will be passed by the Academic Council sometime this semes­ter, and take effect next aca­demic year, if fully approved.

Ghilarducci sees an advan­tage in that the new policy would attract female faculty members, adding that cur­rently, about 9.6 percent of Notre Dame's faculty are wo­men. 
All involved said they agree the recomendation would rein­force Notre Dame's position as a leading Catholic university. "Notre Dame is family," said Pee, adding that parentalleave

Reagan won't order aides to testify 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Reagan has refused to order former aides John Poindexter and Oliver North to appear before the board Reagan named to review the National Security Council's role in the Iran-Contra affair, the White House said Tuesday night. 
Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said presidential counsel Peter Wallison told former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, that com­manding appearances by Poin­dexter and North before the panel would compel the pair "to testify against them­selves." 
Tower had written Reagan on Feb. 4, asking the president to use his authority as commander-in-chief to order Poindexter, a vice admiral, and North, a Marine lieutenant colonel, to testify to the three­member panel. Both Poindex­ter and North have returned to active military duty. 
Fitzwater disclosed the refusal not long after the White House made available to mem­bers of the Tower commission a series of typewritten transcripts of notes that Reagan kept on meetings in­volving the secret sales of U.S. arms to Iran. 
In his letter to Tower, dated Feb. 6, Wallison said that both North and Poindexter "have a constitutional protection against self-incrimination un­der Article 31 of the Uniform 
is family-affirming, acknow­ledging the father's role in it. "(Notre Dame) should take care of our own," concluded Pee. 
If instituted, the policy would be a precedent among Catholic universities, said Ghilarducci. 
"We'll be a minority," she said. 
Pee finds the possible "van­guard" position of Notre Dame appealing, and Flint affirmed that the University should lead in this area, "not follow." 
Code of Military Justice," Fitzwater said in a statement. 
Poindexter resigned and North was fired last Nov. 25-­the same day that Attorney General Edwin Meese revealed on national television that mil­lions of dollars in profits from the sales of U.S. weapons to Iran had been diverted to the Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras. 
Subsequently, both North and Poindexter returned to ac­tive duty roles in the military, and both refused to testify before congressional commit­tees, invoking their Fifth Amendment rights against self -incrimination. 
Fitzwater said that in reject­ing Tower's request to produce Poindexter and North, "the White House counsel relied upon a written opinion from the general counsel of the Depart­ment of Defense, who con­firmed earlier oral advice on this matter when similar issues were raised in December." 
In his reply to Tower, Wal­lison noted that Reagan recently had "made clear his desire that both Poindexter and North cooperate fully with all ongoing inquiries, consistent with their rights." 
The presidential counsel also reminded Tower that Reagan had proposed last month that the Senate Intelligence Com­mittee grant limited use immu­nity to Poindexter and North "so the facts would be known without precluding pro1:;ecution based on other evidence." 
Meanwhile, Reagan met with Wallfson and with David Ab­shire, his special counsel on the Iran-Contra matter, in prepa­ration for a question-and­answer session the president is scheduled to have Wednesday with members of the panel.

Khomeini vows to continue war 
Associated Press 
NICOSIA, Cyprus-Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini declared Tuesday that Iran's long con­flict with Iraq is a holy crusade and his fundamentalist regime will make "war until victory " 
The 86-year-old Shiite Mos­lem patriarch delivered his first public speech in nearly three months on the eve of the 
eighth  anniversary  of  Shah  
Mohammad  Reza  Pahlavi's  
fall from power.  

There have been rumors that Khomeini is in poor health, but his voice was strong and steady during the 17-minute address broadcast by Tehran radio. His remarks also were reported by the official Islamic Republic News Agency. 
Khomeini said Iran was bat­tling for a "divine cause" in the war, which began in September 1980 with an invasion by Iraq. 
"Families and children are now being killed and this is hard for us and brings pressure to bear," he said. The speech was delivered at a mosque near his home in the Jamaran sub­urb north of Tehran, the news agency and radio said. 
Iraq and Iran have pounded each other's cities with air raids, artillery and missiles recently. Thousands of civilians have been reported killed or wounded. 
"Almost every day Iran is hit, and many children, youngsters, old men and ordi­nary people see their homes fall in on them, but as soon as they clamber from the rubble they speak of the need for us to make war until victory," Khomeini said. 
Mass rallies are planned Wednesday to mark the an­niversary of the dissolution of Parliament on Feb. 11, 1979, less than two weeks after Khomeini's triumphal return from exile. The shah had left the country in January. 
Tuesday's speech was the first public address by Khomeini since Nov. 20, when he condemned Iranian officials

who wanted contact with the United States, a reference to the Iran-Contra arms deal. 
Western news reports have said Khomeini suffered at least one stroke late last year and was staying out of daily affairs because of bad health. Specula­tion arose again Sunday be­cause President Ali Khamenei read a speech for Khomeini while the patriarch sat in silence. 
Before Khomeini spoke on Tuesday, President Khamenei said Iran does not want to widen the war and seeks to ex­pand "brotherly relations with its neighbors." 
"Iran is interested in assur­ing the security of the region in cooperation with all Persian Gulf countries," the official news agency quoted him as saying at an anniversary cere­mony in Tehran. 
He also issued this warning to countries that provide arms or other aid to Iraq: "We iden­tify our enemies and our friends, especially in these fateful days." 
Iran has made thinly veiled threats against Kuwait for let­ting Iraqi warplanes to use its airspace for attacks on Iran's vital oil installations. 

Programming Board hears of 'Big Apple Send-Off 
By MARILYN BENCHIK Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 
The Saint Mary's Pro­gramming Board met Tues­day night to discuss plans for the "Big Apple Send-Off." 
The "send-off" is a raffle event which sponsors through a random drawing a trip for a member of the Saint Mary's community and three friends. "The other (women) do not have to be from Saint Mary's, but all four of the travellers must be female," said Sarah Cook, vice president for stu­dent affairs. 
"This is open to the entire Saint Mary's community. This means that professors can purchase a raffle ticket as well as students," Cook said. 
Each ticket is sold for $10 each, and Saint Mary's stu­dents can purchase any amount of tickets. "Everything was paid for

"I think one of the things I learned about most there was generosity," Krasevac said. "Every single peso, which is the money they have there, goes toward feeding their kids. One of the lessons I learned down there is that the people who have the least give the most because they know what it means not to have," she said. 
Nanni said he taught English to sixth and eighth grade children in the poor school. He spoke on the lack of adequate health services and shared an experience in which the mother of one of his students died of improper medical care. 
"There, the next day was Mertha, my student whom I had grown to love and care for, crying because she'd lost her 32-year-old mother, the little stability that she had in he1 life," Nanni said. "And I thought, 'dammit, this isn't right,' it hurt but it also struck me as not being right, it an­gered me . . . that humanity, where we have these two VCRs, three car families, couldn't meet the needs of Mertha's necessitites, her health neces­sities, her food necessities. 
"And it smacked of, more than anything else, the indif­ference, the apathy that those who have have towards those who have not," Nanni said. "It's not (the military dictator­ship of) Pinochet that's the worst," he said, "but it's the masses of the indifference that I think are the worst. 
"What can we do as a Notre Dame community? There's a lot we can do. I wouldn't put our expectations too high. Let's say there's a thousand who are completely indifferent, turn their head the other way, there's always one or two or three that give and give and give and those are the people that I think who have the strongest impact on society," Nanni said. "One person can have a bigger impact than a thousand indifferent.''

Soviets free 140 political prisoners 
Associated Press 

MOSCOW -The government 
has freed about 140 imprisoned 

dissidents, is considering par­
doning about 140 more, and has 
begun reviewing the criminal 
code with the idea of softening 
some provisions, a Soviet 
spokesman said Tuesday. 
Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Gennady Gerasimov said the 
government would like to see 
"fewer people behind bars and 
behind barbed wire." 
He made no mention, however, of an amnesty for those sentenced under laws prohibiting "anti -Soviet agita­tion and propaganda." 
Soviet dissidents have esti­mated at least 1,500 political prisoners remain in Soviet labor camps, prisons or inter­nal exile. 
Besides the Kremlin's avowed desire to reduce the prison camp population, the government may also be trying to deflect Western criticism of the Soviet human rights record. The issue has ham­pered better trade and political relations with the West. 

The Soviets plan a weekend forum on peace and disarma­ment to be attended by politi­cal, business, cultural and re­ligious figures from Western countries. They also are trying to win agreement at the Vienna conference on European secur­ity for a human rights confer­ence in Moscow this spring. 
In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Reagan administra­tion hopes the Soviet govern­ment "will follow up these recent moves with the release of more political prisoners and prisoners of conscience who un­justly remain in confinement or exile withOut imposing any requirements that they recant their previous activities and limit future activities in sup­port of human rights. 
By late Tuesday night, the release of dissidents had not been reported to the Soviet public. The English-language service of the Tass news agency carried a report on Gerasimov's comments, but the report was not sent by the agency's Russian-language service. No mention of the release of dissidents was made. 
Correction 
The Student Senate article in Tuesday's Observer in­correctly reported how a gay rights proposal was settled. The proposal was defeated by an 8 to 7 margin, and Student Body President Mike Switek did not vote.

the recent openness in the So­viet Union has been very lim­ited. "To begin with, there is no openness in foreign policy," he said. 
"This openness does not con­cern the army," Shevchenko continued, "The privileges of the elite are not being dis­cussed." 
"There cannot be any kind of real openness if all media, newspaper, television and everything will continue to belong to the government, con­trolled by the government and the censorship by the govern­ment will continue," he con­cluded. 
Shevchenko said the United States should keep its options open in dealing with the Soviet Union. At the same time, "We have to negotiate, have to deal, with the Soviet Union because we have to live on the same planet," he said. "I think we have to pursue arms negotia­tions now because it's a good opportunity." 
Shevchenko said last year's Reykjavik summit between Reagan and Gorbechev was counterproductive because the Soviet Union linked future progress on arms control to a ban on the Strategic Defense Initiative. Yet, "The Soviet program started in the late 1950s, and by the early 1960s they were going on full speed," he said . 
On the larger question of Soviet-American relations in general, Shevchenko said, "We have to win the minds of the Soviet Union. 
"With the revolution of tele­communications and every­thing, we· have perhaps some chances to break the Iron Cur­tain on telecommunications," said Shevchenko. 
"It is for us very important to understand the true nature of the new Gorbechev leader­ship, its dynamics ... as well as prospects for domestic reform," he said.

McFarlane tried to kill self, concludes investigation 
Associated Press WASHINGTON -An investi­gation concluded that former presidential adviser Robert McFarlane attempted suicid-e, a police source said Tuesday, while authofities said officially only that there was no evidence of foul play in McFarlane's Valium overdose. "There's not going to be any ruling that it was an attempted suicide. We are satisfied that there was no crime and there's no further legal action to be taken," said Harry Geehreng, spokesman for the Montgomery County Police in suburban Maryland. But a source close to the in­vestigation, speaking on condi­tion of anonymity, said the

police had determined McFar­lane's ingestion of 25 to 30 tablets of Valium, a tran­quilizer, was an attempt to take his own life. 
The source also confirmed that police learned that McFar­lane, President Reagan's former national security ad­viser, had written a note that his wife Jonda carried to the hospital. However, police did not know the contents of the note, the source said. 
Geehreng said he knew noth­ing of the note, and McFar­lane's attorney Peter Morgan declined comment on the mat­ter. 
The 49-year-old McFarlane, who associates said has recently been in severe pain with a back ailment, was rushed to the hospital Monday morning, shortly before he was to testify before the presiden­tial commission set up to inves­tigate the National Security Council's role in the Iran arms-sale crisis. 
He was listed in good condi­tion Tuesday at Bethesda Naval Hospital in suburban Maryland and was visited by his wife, said hospital spokes­man Lt. Russ Sanford. He said McFarlane was not receiving telephone calls. 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan had not tried to contact his former aide, but that the pres­ident and first lady Nancy Reagan planned to telephone Mrs. McFarlane. He said Reagan would likely call McFarlane "when it is appro­priate." 
Fitzwater said the White House "had no inside informa­tion or medical information" to comment on the reported suicide attempt. 
Mrs. McFarlane, mean­while, issued a terse statement saying, "Bob and the children and I appreciate enormously the great love and support that we are getting from friends and 
strangers alike." 

Teens charged after racial attack 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Three teen­agers were charged Tuesday with murder and nine others with lesser crimes in a racial attack in which a white mob chased and beat three black men, one of whom fled into traffic and was killed by acar. 
The suspects, ages 16 to 18, surrendered Tuesday mor­ning to police in the New York City borough of Queens, where the attack took place Dec. 20. 
The 12 defendants, accom­panied to state Supreme Court by parents and lawyers, were arraigned before Justice Alfred Lerner. All pleaded in­nocent. 
Two of the three youths charged with murder Tues­day had previously faced the same charge until a judge dropped it for lack of tes­timony by the survivors of the ::tttack. 
Those charged with murder again were Jon Lester, 17, of South Ozone Beach, and Scott Kern, 17, of Howard Beach. The other youth charged with murder was Robert Riley, who was described by special prosecutor Charles Hynes as the only defendant who cooperated in the investiga­tion. 
The judge agreed to Hynes' request that Riley be released on his own recognizance. Bail was denied for Kern. Lester, already imprisoned on a weapons charge, was remanded to Rikers Island prison. 
The third youth charged in the original investigation, Jason Ladone, 16, was charged with second-degree manslaughter. His bail was set at $50,000. 
The other charges against the teen-agers included at­tempted murder, assault, rioting, inciting to riot, con­spiracy and criminal facilita­tion. 
Although he noted that all the youths had roots in the community and many had no criminal records, Hynes asked the judge to take into account the seriousness of the charges and sought bails ran­ging from $100,000 to $25,000 for those charged only with the riot counts. 
In each case, defense lawyers argued their clients had voluntarily surrendered and would be available for any court appearances. 
But Lerner, calling the in­cident ''an American tragedy," set high bails in all cases. 

Klansmen killed son, says mother 
Associated Press 
MOBILE, Ala. -The mur­der of a black teen-ager in 1981 was carried out by Klansmen motivated by the white-supremacy doctrines of the United Klans of America, an attorney for the youth's mother said Tuesday during opening arguments in a $10 million civil rights suit. 
Attorney Morris Dees told the all-white jury he wanted it to grant a verdict that would "set the kind of example that will ring out around this state and country that good people will not tolerate this type con­duct." 
The case stems from the murder of 19-year-old Mi­chael Donald on March 21, 1981. His body was found hanging from a tree in Mobile. Two members of the local United Klans chapter, Klavern 900, were convicted in the case. 
Donald's mother, Beulah Mae Donald, is the main plaintiff, in addition to the NAACP, representing all Al­abama blacks. The suit claims Donald's constitu­tional rights and the rights of all blacks were violated by Klan intimidation tactics. 
The defendants include the United Klans of America, In­c., two Klansmen convicted in . he slaying and five others representing themselves at the trial. 
John Mays of Decatur, the attorney for the Klan, told the jury in opening statements that none of the Klan leaders thought the Donald murder was "humorous." 
"They thought it was an atrocity," Mays said. 
In opening testimony Tues­day, United Klans Imperial Wizard Robert Shelton, who is not personally a defendant, said he does not advocate vio­lence to achieve the goal of white supremacy. 
Dees questioned Shelton about a lynching cartoon that appeared in a Ku Klux Klan newspaper. Shelton, who was the newspaper's editor and publisher, said he did not ap­prove of the cartoon. 
The cartoon appeared in a 1979 issue of the Fiery Cross and showed a black with a noose around his neck. The caption read, "White people should give blacks what they deserve." 
Shelton said nothing in the KKK bylaws advocates vio­lence to achieve the political goal of white supremacy. 
"I'm not ashamed to be a white person," he added. 
Dees also introduced the United Klan charter, signed by Shelton, that created the local KKK group in 1979. Shel­ton has been the top officer of the United Klans since it was incorporated in 1961.

Koop favors TV ads for condoms 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Surgeon General Everett Koop told a House panel on Tuesday that he favors advertising condoms on network television because the national health threat posed by AIDS "overwhelms other considerations." 
Koop said that such advertis­ing should promote disease prevention rather than sexual activity and that, properly pre­sented, it would provide a valu­able health service. 
The surgeon general, desig­nated the Reagan administra­tion's lead spokesman on AIDS, did not state his position on ad­vertising in his prepared tes­timony but expressed strong support for it in response to questions from members of the Health and Environment Sub­committee of the House En­ergy and Commerce Commit­tee. 
"The threat of AIDS is so great that it overwhelms other considerations, and advertis­ing, I think therefore, is neces­sary in reference to condoms and would have a positive public health value," Koop said. 

He acknowledged that con­doms do not provide 100 per­cent protection against catch­ing AIDS from an infected partner but added, "With all the failures and drawbacks it's the only thing we have in the way of a barrier." 
Generation gap exaggerated, says association of retired 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Reports of potential conflict between generations of Americans are greatly exaggerated, the American Association of Retired Persons said Tuesday. 
The association released results of a survey it said puts to rest recent reports of inter­generational conflict stem­ming from younger Americans' resentment of older people. 
Concern about such conflict has been expressed in Congress and by population analysts in view of the rapidly growing number of elderly in America and their potential need for costly medical and social pro­grams. 
But instead of such con­frontations, the study found "mutual respect and concern from generation to genera-
There is no vaccine or cure for AIDS, and no one is known to have recovered from it. 
Koop said abstinence is the only sure way to avoid con­tracting the disease sexually, but "that's not terribly realis­tic in our society." 
Rep. Jim Bates, D-Calif., asked Koop to comment on whether television networks have a particular responsibil­ity because so much program­ing contains sexual themes. 
"You could make a good case that if television networks do indeed peddle all the attractive parts of sex then they should be willing to also peddle some­thing that might prevent the transmission of sexually ac­quired disease," responded Koop. 
"But I think even without that relationship, the threat ... is so great to the people of this country that, of itself, the public health message and the preventative aspects of AIDS that would accompany condom advertising speak for them­selves." 
Representatives of the three major commercial networks-­NBC, CBS and ABC said at the hearing that they do not carry condom advertisements be­cause network officials believe they would be offensive to the viewers of many affiliate sta­tions. 
They noted that local stations are free to carry such ads on their own and that condoms are

"Most Americans are con­vinced that a blend of the en­ergy of youth and the experi­ence of older people is required to solve the country's prob­lems," Hochstein told a news conference.

Some women get abortions if not happy with child's sex 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK-Some pregnant women are using genetic tests to find out the sex of their fetuses and are getting abor­tions if it is not the gender they want, a practice made easier by a new kind of test, experts say. 
The practice is rare and test­ing professionals said they dis­courage it. as unethical or a poor use for tests intended to uncover serious genetic defects. 
While many women seeking such tests come from cultures that put a premium on having boys, others want a girl, testing experts said in recent inter­views. 
In one case, a 36-year-old mother of two boys got an abor­tion when she found out her fetus was male, said Marie Barr, coordinator of the-prena­tal diagnosis clinic at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.

If unintentionally pregnant, a woman in her 30s or 40s with three boys may wish to con­tinue the pregnancy only if she knows the baby will be a girl, said Laird Jackson, director of medical genetics at the univer­sity. 
The tests are generally per­formed if a woman has a family history of genetic disease or is 35 or older, because maternal age increases the risk of ge­netic defects. 
The standard test, called am­niocentesis, is performed when the fetus is about 16 weeks old. A newer test not in wide use, called chorionic villus sam­pling or CVS, can be performed as early as nine weeks, allow­ing for earlier abortions. 
Of 2,500 women who have gone through CVS procedures at Thomas Jefferson University in about three years, perhaps 10 have gotten abortions be­cause of the sex of the fetus, said Jackson.

Heightened awareness of justice is petitioned 
Aquino receives praise for maintaining peace 
Although upheaval and violence still rock the Philippines, some good things are happening there. President Corazon Aquino has proven herself .a woman of peace, and in the face of an edgy group of leftist insurgents and a dissatisfied right, she has generally maintained a position consistent with her revolutionary, democratic ideals. 
Ken Kollman 
on politics 

On the whole, Aquino deserves pass­ing remarks for her job in running a revolutionary government, and in that business, passing marks are rare indeed. The new constitution, from all indications approved by nearly 80 per­cent of the population in a plebescite, stands as a remarkable sign of as­surance in this lady who consistently stuns her extremist enemies. 
One can hardly blame those who criticize her. From the left, she stops far short of a bloody communist revo­lution, instead choosing to negotiate, shake hands, and greet rebel leaders in her palace. The Communist guerillas undoubtably seek a share of power, if not a complete leadership role. But Aquino, of course, is not about to hand over even a share of power, and rightly so. So what does she do? She opens negotiations, arranges for a cease fire, and holds total control on the military's urge to pursue the guerillas in combat. This is hardly what good revolutions are made of. 
The right criticizes Aquino for many of the same reasons. Dealing with com­munists on any level other than outright violence is not only unforgiving, it may be downright treason. Calls of treason also come from the right when she holds the military accountable for the inap­propriate way the police handled the protestors two weeks ago. 
Yet that bloody confrontation which resulted in the deaths of 18 demonstrators brought severe criticism from both the left and right because, for the left, it looked too much like a Ferdinand Marcos move, and for the right, her immediate calls for in­quiry lacked some of the law-and-order righteousness of the old Marcos regime. The zealots whom Aquino can't seem to please are the very people whom most of her constituents and the United States are glad to see unhappy. 

Dissatisfied zealots, however, can cause some trouble. The recent two-day occupation of a Manila broadcast sta­tion by disaffected Marcos supporters brings into question the possibility of bigger, more powerful revolts in the fu­ture. Add to this the rift in the military over how to treat the unsuccessful mutineers -some urge aggresssive retribution, and others, a lighter sen­tence -and what emerges is a swirl of many competing interests surrounding Aquino. 
The unceasing pressure on Aquino from all sides threatens to reduce her to a pawn that both left and right can use to gain eventual power. She deserves credit, though, for hanging tough, and so far it is working. The Philippines, with considerable support of its constitution, now stands as one of Asia's most legitimate and credible democracies. 
One wonders if Aquino's refusal to adopt a series of ideologically violent rules, which some would call naivete and which I would call remarkable and admirable, set her up to be toppled. The possibility exists that she will be eliminated, only to be replaced by one who will adopt the "real" rules of the game: police and military power to eliminate opposition. History does not reward revolutionaries who follow a line of peace. The opposition usually kills them. 
A stark scenario such as this would be disastrous for both the Philippines and the United States. Our country has a great interest in supporting the work of leaders like Aquino, and at least be­caus~ our military bases stand to be eliminated. A leader with the conscien­tious strength of Aquino deserves our praise, but also our support. 
Ken Kollman is a junior and a regular Viewpoint columnist. 
Theatrical tragedy, as most of us have been taught in an English class at some point in our academic careers, typically involves a character of high esteem brought down not by vice, but by some weakness or error in judge­ment. Usually this flaw surfaces as the character's quest to gain power, wis­dom or money ends with horrifying results. As part of the foundation of our literary heritage, these tragedies were staged on Greek amphitheaters, lat~r in the Globe theater, and today m theaters around the world. 
Mary Ann White 
guest column 

Today, however, one can witness a tragedy of a different sort without going to the theater. Unfortunately, the stage no longer belongs to the world of acting, but to that of real life. The media often presents a stage in the streets of Manila, Chile, Johannesburg, and sometimes even Chicago or South Bend. But the stage is also set in labo­ratories around the world as we push to improve our technology and in cor­porate offices where executives strike to increase profits at any expense. Though we cannot deny the numerous benefits of the majority of today's tech­nological advancements, dramatic tragedy teaches us to know our limita­tions, which would seem to apply to the world of science. 
Even on our own campuses, the con­cerns over getting the best paying job, going to the right party and being seen with the right people shows that quite often, we partake in this tragedy, too. True, we cannot fault a person for not taking action on issues of injustice if he or she is unaware that they exist. But this is our character flaw: the basic lack of awareness concerning the issues of social justice today. No one will dis­pute that it is difficult for most students to find huge amounts of time to dedicate to a cause. And so often, it is easiest to brush off the issues by using the usual, "What can one person do to help?" line. The longer we let our ignornace of the issues persist, however, the longer we unknowingly contribute to these tragedies. 
Recently, I participated in the Urban Plunge program offered to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students over Christmas break. Like so many people, I was totally unaware of the number of injustices that the poor suffer every day in cities across America. Though I am far from a complete grasp of the issues, the Plunge showed me the incredible number of organizations that are working to improve the situation for the poor. 
Here at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, the opportunities for involve­ment in similar organizations exist right at our fingertips. The Center for Social Concerns and Saint Mary's Campus Ministry and Justice Educa­tion Departments offer countless ways to make us more aware of peace and justice issues. Whether through partic­ipation in different organizations, lec­tures, movies or publications, these groups are willing to educate us. No one is asking that we completely give up our social lives and other interests for such causes, but we must become more aware of the issues at hand. 
Most theatrical tragedies take place in five acts. For the real life tragedies taking place today, we do not kno\\ what "act" we are in. But as a society, we must act soon while we still have time to prevent the outcome that most theatrical tragedies have. In the words of Archbishop Bernard Law of Boston, "what good would life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness be if we become victims of our own technological bril­liance -if the life our our mother Earth is extinguished?"

Special Olympics will benefit from NVA effort 
I am prompted to write this column as the Lewis Hall representative for Late Night Olympics. I was approached by my dorm president and asked if I would like to represent our dorm, and I agreed without really knowing anyth­ing about the event. The only thing I knew was that it had some connection with Special Olympics. Since I have never been personally involved in Spe­cial Olympics, I saw my participation in Late Night Olympics as an indirect involvement. 
Sheila Horox 
guest column 
By now, most of you are aware that this event is being held at the ACC this Friday, February 13, from 9 p.m. to 4 
a.m. It has been organized by NVA and its purpose is to raise money for Special Olympics. The proceeds that we raise will be donated to the St. Joseph County Special Olympic Fund. In other words, our participation in this event con­stitutes an act of giving that will benefit the local community. 
NVA is taking advantage of its access to all the facilities at the ACC by scheduling a wide variety of activities from the Not-Quite-So-Olympic sports 



P.O.BoxQ 
Student is considered automatically guilty 
Dear Editor: 
The rights of Notre Dame students have been violated in many ways during the past four years. Last week, however, a new low was reached when I lound out that even being in compli­ance with Indiana state law is not enough any more. 
This situation started innocently enough when I went into the King Cel­lars on U.S. 31 to buy a six-pack of Heineken. I showed the clerk my trusty Missouri driver's license which clearly stated that I was born on April 24, 1965. This license had never been questioned before. Because the clerk was still not satisfied, I produced two more pieces of identification. Then, without a word of explanation, the still-disbelieving clerk called up a Roseland police offi­cer. After looking at my license, the officer grabbed my drivers license as well as my student I.D. and ordered me to follow him to the Roseland police sta­tion. Once we were there, he called Notre Dame's security department and asked that they release my date of birth. Since this is protected informa­tion, they refused to reveal my birthdate over the phone. Their advice to me was to give up immediately if I was not 21. At this time the police offi­cer explained that the whole problem with my license was that the social se­curity number was typed slightly lighter than the rest of the license. After showing me an Indiana license which contained only one type size, he threatened to impound my drivers license until I could show him my birth certificate. The end result of all this was that I was given a ticket for being a minor in a tavern which would be to a Valentine's Soc-Hop. The Olympic activities include such sports as half­court basketball, indoor soccer, broom­ball, and a sure to be favorite, innertube water polo. For those opting for less strenuous activities, carnival type events, called Not-Quite-so Olympic Games, will be available like the celebrity dunking machine, darts, and a ping-pong challenge. 

The money being raised is generated 
in several ways. Every team that 
enters an event pays an entrance fee 
of approximately five dollars, the cost 
being split among the team members. 
All entrance fee money goes to the St. 
Joseph County Special Olympic Fund. 
All revenue generated from the car­
nival type events also goes to Special 
Olympics. 

Aside from giving Notre Dame stu­dents the chance to raise money for a very worthy cause, NVA has added an­other incentive by giving the dorms a chance to win some money. The dorms have been paired off into teams and each team antes $100, which is then set aside after 20% of it is given to the Spe­cial Olympic Fund. Using the intricate . scoring system devised by the NVA, the team with the highest point total at the end of the night will win the pot of money. The dorm competition not only gives students a chance to get to know 
people within their own dorms but also the dorm or dorms they've been paired up with as well. This night is a social opportunity, something we at Notre Dame are often in desperate need of. 
Only now that the event draws so near am I able to look back in retrospect and appreciate the efforts of so many indi­viduals, those at NVA and each of the dorm representatives. My fist per­sonally banged on every door at Lewis (keep in mind we do have the largest women's dorm) and my voice was lost somewhere in the process ofexplaining what Late Night Olympics was about. But only when faced with a blank sheet of paper before me, compelled to write about the importance of this event, did I really come to understand what this night means. 
Late Night Olympics is an event that transcends itself, in that the effort we put into it benefits others. Since the money we raise goes to the St. Joseph County Special Olympic Fund, it fol­lows that I should talk for a moment about Special Olympics in general. 
If someone were to ask me to explain the significance of Special Olympics, my first inclination would be to describe it in terms of handicapped in­dividuals learning to believe in them­selves and, conversely, our coming to believe in them. Special Olympics is 
invalidated only if I could show him positive proof of my date of birth in 10 days which I gladly did since I am 21. 
Hopefully, this incident will warn stu­dents about the current attitude of the Roseland police. Problems can and will develop when students are assumed to be guilty until they can prove their in­nocence.

Students must aid in maintaining security 
Dear Editor: 

Many, many thanks to the student who took the time to report a suspicious activity! On the night of January 29, 1987 an unidentified student walked to the Main Gate and reported suspicious activity in the D-6 parking lot (near the ROTC building). The student provided a description of a car and its location in the lot. Notre Dame Security officers responded to this call and subsequently apprehended three juveniles. The juveniles, one of whom was armed with a loaded handgun, broke into a stu­dent's car and face charges for posses­sion of stolen property, theft and cri­minal mischief. Furthermore, the apprehension in this case provides a solid lead for the County Police in a related burglary of a home. 
The student who reported this suspi­cious activity did a great service to our community. He faciliated the ap­prehension of potentially dangerous criminals and took only a few moments of his time! The Security Department maintains 24-hour patrol of campus but to be more effective, we need your help. To maintain a safe environment on campus, we need each of you to take time to report any and all suspicious activity. Simply call security at 239-5555 or 283-4444 at any time to report any suspicious activity. Security is never too busy to check out anyone or anyth­ing suspicious. Remember, you are not required to give your name! 
Beginning soon, Security and The Ob­server will cooperate to publish a "police beat" type column. This column will outline recent activity of the Security Department, will provide important crime prevention informa­tion and will be used to solicit informa­tion from the community about un­solved crimes on campus. 
Please join our department by report­ing all suspicious activity. This will send a strong message to would-be criminals. At Notre Dame, we look out for each other and we're not an easy mark! Thank you in advance for your support and cooperation.

Sorin hockey players display poor conduct 
Dear Editor: 
A bench-dearing brawl took place during the Pangborn-Sorin interhall hockey game last Thursday. It oc­curred at the beginning of the second half. Pangborn led the game 6-0. The Sorin team had been delivering cheap shots the entire game; however, the illegal check that initiated the brawl was inexcusably blatant. 
The league specifically prohibits 
checking and is intended to be fun for 
those not skillful enough to participate 
at the varsity level. Yet, a Sorin player 
took a ten stride run at a Pangborn synonymous with opportunity. For so long we told handicapped persons, "You Can't," but Special Olympics repudiates that notion. Special Olym­pians learn to say, "Yes I can," if only they are given a chance. We are giving people the chance to discover for them­selves that their opportunity for ac­complishment is limitless. It is not win­ning that's important, but the bravery in the attempt. 
Late Night Olympics is our chance to make their dream a reality. The Notre Dame community is known for its generosity, and this event is essentially an act of giving. It might not seem like giving because the events are going to be so much fun, but our mere partici­pation is helping so many others. 
My intentions in writing this article are to make everyone aware of this im­portant night but also to urge everyone to get involved, whether it be by par­ticipating in several of the Olympic events or by stopping in at the carnival games. The most important thing tore­member is that the event is raising money for the St. Joseph County Special Olympics. It is a very worthy cause, worth getting involved in. And I guarantee you'll have a great time . 
Sheila Horox is a senior American Studies major and Lewis Hall represen­tative for Late Night Olympics. 
player and deliberately knocked him to the ice in front of the Sorin crowd and bench. As the Pangborn player at­tempted to retaliate, he was kicked in the neck by the same player who delivered the original blow. The Pangborn player was taken to the hospital by ambulance.1~stitches were needed to close the wound. 
Let it be known that even with blood running from his neck the wounded Pangborn player searched the ice for his cowardly assailant. He never found him because the responsible "Otter" could only muster the courage to skate off of the ice and hide among his friends. 
Sorin fans were elated to see this type of action. Both the team and fans seemed only interested in trying to in­jure the opposition. Sorin players were even seen giving each other "high­fives" after receiving roughing penalties prior to the brawl. 
We have been informed that this type of behavior is not uncharacteristic of the Sorin team. As a result of their in­eptitude on the ice, Sorin falls behind early in each game and then concen­trates on their specialty -cheap shots. 
Our main point is that Sorin does not play hockey to win but rather to hurt people. We hope that this letter does not glorify their actions. 
We do not know how many residents of Sorin were aware of the team's con­duct, however, if people did know of their behavior, why didn't someone have the common sense to put an end to it? The incident was an inexcusable display of poor sportsmanship that greatly marred the fine tradition of Sorin Hall.

veryone is looking for a return to summer, espe­cially the citizens of South Bend and surrounding counties. The Beach Boys pro­vided that warm feeling tonight just as they have been providing it for the last 25 breakdown of the then 22-year­old producer and writer of the most popular Beach Boys songs, Brian Wilson. He has been under psychiatric care on and off ever since. Rumors fly about a grand piano being placed in a giant sandbox in his living room. 
But this is all history, you say. What have these boys of lively crew. 
With Love at the helm, the Beach Boys provided wave after wave of hits from past decades, including the classics "Dance," "Surfin' Safari," "Surf City," and "Wouldn't It Be Nice." Carl Wilson, lead guitarist for the group, sang the ballad "God Only Knows (What I'd Be Without You)," the 


started by three brothers, Carl, Dennis and Brian Wilson (the mastermind behind the band's ethereal harmonies.) Mike Love, lead singer and a cousin to the Wilson's, and Alan Jar­dine, a friend of the family, have also been with the group since Its foundation. 
Changes have been made in the band lineup through the years. Bruce Johnston, vocalist and keyboardist, has been with the group since 1965. And

The group has also suffered setbacks, Including the nervous see them, it was obvious when the lights went down precisely what everyone had come to see. For the first time that eve­ning, everyone was standing, and cheering, and clapping. Even the hi:Jinx of two WSBT disc jockey's after the depar­ture of opening act Joan Jett and the Blackhearts hadn't brought out the smiles that broke out when Mike Love, hat firmly on head, emerged from the wings. 

The group welcomed the crowd with the opening song "California Girls," which incorp­orated various synthesizer and guitar solos. It looked as though the boring crowd that had barely applauded for Joan Jett, another veteran of the music scene, had been replaced by a new and more approaches shown by Jett and Mike Love. While Jett didn't even talk to the crowd outside of introducing her songs, Love played with the crowd, teasing them throughout the show with baiting comments about riotre Dame sports teams and the school. 
Spoofing their own long mu­sical history and the nature of their audience, Love said "409," on~ of the songs they would subsequently play that had received much applause when he suggested playing it "was recorded in the 1900's." Without a breath between them, the Beach Boys then proceeded to play "Little Duece Coupe," "Little Old Lady From Pasadena," "409," "Little GTO" and others.

The Super Bowl 
In Britain it's 'just super' 
S 
o this is London. An ocean away--another continent, country, culture. And yet here, too, it is Super Bowl Sunday. 
Earlier today I turned on my walkman in hopes of listening to some British music. Instead, Radio-2 was conducting a Super Bowl poll. Hundreds of British called to make predictions about the winner of the game. 
Here it is, of course, "American Football." And although the game will not end here before .3 a.m., excitement runs nearly as high as in "the states." It didn't reach quite the level that it does in America, but then again the average Englishman knows very little about our game. This is evident by the broadcast preceding the game. The basics of the game were explained, much to the amusement of the darners gathered here to watch. 
The newspapers have run special sections devoted to the Super Bowl this week. The pubs and liquor stores have been making a big deal about the game, too. Huge posters and Budweiser displays fill many of the storefront windows. This fine, imported beer is on special here; a case will only set you back 12 pounds sterling or about $18. 
We found some American football fans last week as we waited for a bus. They heard us talking and knew we were lost. They offered help and asked if we were Americans. 
One remarked, "You probably don't even watch British 
football." "No," we admitted. Fumbling for a reply we added, "You probably don't 
follow American football." "Yes we do," they exclaimed. "We'll be watching the Superbowl on Sunday." We asked who they'd be rooting for. They didn't really 
say; they only added, "We love the Chicago Bears." "I am Refrigerator Perry," said one of them. We have traveled through five time zones only to find 
still more Bears' fans. At least they spoke with a British accent. 
The final outcome of the Radio-2 poll? Fifty-three percent for the Giants, and 4 7 percent for the Broncos. Maybe the British know more about our American pasttime than we think.

Paul Pressey and Sidney Moncrief a question mark, so too are the Bucks. 
Philadelphia is having a nice season, but when they traded Moses Malone they lost two million dollars off the team payroll, they gained an injury­prone Jeff Ruland, and they lost a chance to win it all. 
The Detroit Pistons have Isaiah Thomas and the Notre Dame duo of Bill Laimbeer and Adrian Dantley. Unfortunate­ly, they also have Chuck Daly as a coach, and too little be­sides Vinny Johnson on the bench. 
But who will win and who will lose is not the main issue here. The latest injection of talent has given the league a wider appeal. New superstars, such as Wilkins and Jordan, have made the NBA game exciting again. What else could account for the Chicago Bulls, a team that will count the season as a tremendous success if it wins as many as it loses, averaging 15,000 fans per game? Their uniforms aren't that pretty. 
No matter which team r~alizes the ultimate goal this season, the NBA will be the winner. It is now on a solid fin­ancial foundation fed by great fan interest. Whereas all but five teams were losing money just a few seasons ago, all but five are making money now. The infusion of exciting, young stars from the college game has helped to peak the fan in­terest and strengthen teams that were once also-rans. 
The fact that six teams think 
they have a shot at the Big Two 
makes all their fans think they 
have a chance. That makes the Associated Press 
CHICAGO -If Iowa Coach Tom Davis is a little apprehen­sive about the Big Ten basket­ball race in the approaching two weeks, who can blame him? 
"Every time you look up there's a nationally ranked team staring you in the face," Davis said Tuesday at the Big Ten's weekly telephone press conference hookup. 
The No. 4-ranked Hawkeyes take on No. 7 Purdue Thursday night, and on Saturday 11th­ranked Illinois invades Iowa City. The following week, Iowa goes to Ohio State and to No. 2 Indiana. 
"It's a demanding stretch," said Davis, "I don't know what would compare with it. Those are four strong clubs and then we play the Michigans after that. 
"There's not much breathing room. We all have to face it and that's an indication of how strong the Big Ten is." 
Some clubs could finish near the bottom in this league and finish on top in some others, said Davis, who is in his first year in the Big Ten after coach­ing stints at Lafayette, Boston College and Stanford. 
"Going down the stretch we have to play hard, take each game individually and not look ahead," said Davis. "We can't emphasize any one thing." 
Iowa might not be at full strength even if Bill Jones and Kevin Gamble recover from in­juries. Jones has an Achilles in­jury and the flu and has missed practice. Gamble also has missed practices because of a deep thigh bruise. 
But if any team is prepared for such eventualities, it should be the Hawkeyes because of Davis' theory of playing everybody early in the season. 
"Injuries and foul trouble are not as much of a shock," said Davis. "I look to use my bench early in the season. It gives you consistency and others feel ready to step in." 
In Purdue and Illinois, the Hawkeyes will be facing teams they have defeated on the road. They roared back from a 22­point deficit at Champaign to trip Illinos 91-88 in overtime, and followed that with a 70-67 triumph at Purdue. 
But neither coaches Gene Keady of Purdue nor Lou Hen­son of Illinois figure revenge will be a factor in their games at Iowa. 
"We don't talk about those things," said Keady. "We have to come up with a consistent defense. Iowa's rebounding and press concern us. We have to be consistent over 40 minutes. They rely on spurts and they can score 15 or 20 points in a matter of minutes if you're not careful." 
Illinois' immediate problem is not Iowa. The Illini must play at Minnesota on Thursday before going to Iowa and might get caught looking ahead.

Smith aims for No. 600 tonight at NC 
Associated Press 
RALEIGH, N.C. -North 
Carolina basketball head coach 
Dean Smith is willing to leave 
it to others to determine the sig­
nificance his approaching 600th 
coaching victory. 
As he sees it, "it just means 
that I've coached for a long 
time." 
The Tar Heels held off Vir­
ginia last Sunday for Smith's 
599th triumph. Wake Forest 
comes into the Dean E. Smith 
Center Wednesday night with 
the possibility of becoming a 
part of history. 
Bill Guthridge, Smith's top 
assistant for 20 years, says it 
is his boss' style to avoid all the 
attention he draws. 
"He doesn't like to talk about 
himself," Guthridge said. "He 
would rather the credit go to 
the players." 
Smith, 55, will add one more 
entry to his list of achieve­
ments with a victory in the 
building named last February 
in his honor. No. 600 will move 
him past former Oregon State 
coach Amory Gill as the lOth 
winningest Division I coach of 
all time. 
Starting the year, Smith's 
record of 579-171 gave him a 
winning percentage of .772, 
fourth on the all-time list. With 
a 20-2 record through Sunday's 
action, he now has captured 20 
victories or more in 17 straight 
seasons. His only losing season 
in 25 years was his first, an 8-9 
mark in 1961. 
Mter that first season, Smith 
was hung in effigy for failing 
to produce a winner. Now, in 
the eyes of his fans, he could 
coach forever. 
"This is a great university 
and he likes to represent it," 
Guthridge said. 
lt took UCLA coach John Wooden 29 seasons to capture his 667 victories and DePaul's Ray Meyer coached for 42 to reach 724. if Smith stays on the job through the 1990s, he will even have a shot at Kentucky's Adolph Rupp, who has 875 vic­tories.

Final playoff spot brings tight race as P .E., Far-ey, Lyons roll along 
By THERESA KELLY Sports Writer 
A very strong Pasquerilla East team continues to domi­nate women's interhall basket­ball this season, but that has not curbed the intensity of play as several teams fight for remaining playoff spots. 
P .E. is 6-0 with just three games remaining, followed in the standings by Lyons and Farley A, both 5-l. Barring a. severe letdown by one of those leaders, several teams will bat­tle for the fourth and final playoff spot. 
Even P.E. will be tested in the upcoming weeks as it will face a very important matchup with Farley A. Other teams 
P.E. has yet to play include Breen-Phillips B (1-5) and Far­ley B (0-6). P.E. has momen­tum, however, as it comes off an impressive 38-27 beating of a tough Breen-Phillips A team

(4-2) Sunday. 
Farley A, meanwhile, also showed its strength Sunday, beating 3-3 Lewis A, 37-31. This game saw Lewis take the lead in the first half, with Farley hanging in and approaching to within two points at halftime. Farley then came out strong in the second half, taking the lead and never looking back. 
"We were really unor­ganized," said Farley captain Marilu Almeida of her team's slow start. "Then we put it to­gether and played a lot better in the second half." 
The win by Almeida's squad gave Farley A a clean sweep over Lewis Hall this season, coming one week after Far­ley's victory over Lewis B (2­3). Led by Mary Borkowski and Almeida, Farley hopes to break the Pasquerilla East win streak on February 23, when the two leaders are scheduled to meet. 
Those teams also will b watching a 5-l Lyons squa which has scored victories i its last two games, one ove Walsh and one over Farley B. The team's only loss this year, in fact, was a 45-32 setback t 
P.E. early in the season. 
The Walsh team is 1-3, but i may be a better team than it record shows. 
"We've been losing the close games," said senior captain Patty Mileski, whose team can still pull off a winning record with five games left to play. 
Walsh was forced to forfeit to Lyons Sunday due to a lack of players and was victimized by the tough P.E. team the week before. 
"We played P.E. really close through the third quarter," Mileski said. "But we lost our intensity and fell apart." 
Walsh will get a chance to im­prove on its record Thursday when it faces Badin.

Sophomore guard 
Smith is ND's man in the shadows 



By PETE SKIKO Sports Writer 
It's just a matter of time. 
That's a familiar refrain heard by players who stand in the shadow of nationally­recognized teammates. The frustration of constantly hearing those words from your­self and coaches can be hard to handle, especially when everybody knows you've got talent. 
But Michael Smith knows that his time is rapidly ap­proaching. 
And he's not the only one. Notre Dame head coach Digger Phelps understands that while David Rivers stirs his team's drink these days, having a player of Smith's caliber in the wings is a comforting thought. 
"As an athlete, obviously Mi­chael lives in David's shadow to a certain extent," said Phelps, now in his 16th year at the Irish helm. "But honestly, people don't realize that with the quickness and intensity with which he plays~Smith ~as the potential to be one of the best defensive guards in the country." 
That's a strong statement to make about a reserve guard, but it's obvious that Phelps believes it. Smith, a 6-3, 185­pound sophomore out of South Bend, won the 100-meter dash at the Indiana state meet as a junior at LaSalle High School. His defensive quickness and pressing ability have enabled him to see playing time at

Notre Dame. Any further im­proving of his fine ballhandling and offensive skills should land him more regular time in the future. 
"Michael has to concentrate on shutting people down on defense," said Phelps, "because he is more than ca­pable of doing so. We've used him when we've pressed be­cause of his great quickness and as he continues to run our 

Michael Smith 
system and improve the way he handles the ball, he will be­come increasingly valuable to us over the next couple of years." 
Smith played small forward in high school, and his adjust­ment to point guard has not been without its difficulties. But Smith loves to run, and his role thus far suits that prefer­ence. 
"Even as a forward in high school," said Smith, who has seen action in 15 of Notre Dame's 20 games thus far this year, "I was used to running the floor. Sure, I think that the team this year has the potential to be a running team, but the situations in most of our games this year didn't warrant our running; we had to slow things down more. 
"Of course I'd like to see more playing time, and I'm sure that I will in the future, but right now it's just a matter of taking advantage of the time I do get and then playing well in those situations. I enjoy playing on the team. If I im­prove the things I need to im­prove, I'm sure I'll see more action." 
Smith sees an upswing in team unity this year over last, and feels that the squad can go far if that attitude prevails. 
"There is a lot more of a team concept this year," said Smith. "That's probably be­cause we realized that we had a good year last year and should have gone farther than we did. We know we can play this year. Coach Phelps is a big part of that. 
"Digger expects a lot out of everybody and he has certain ways to motivate and get the most out of the guys on the team. Sure, every now and then he'll get on you, but he does it because he knows you're capa­ble of doing better. He and (Assistant) Coach (Jim) Baron really know what they're doing." 
Phelps sees a good future for Smith, one which will probably extend far beyond the basket­ball court. 
"I love his personality," said 
Phelps. "He's a great kid who 
works hard and will get his 
chance. Believe me, he'll help 
us out a lot before it's over." 

Conner, Cup enjoy parade 
Associated Press NEW YORK-The America's Cup and the skipper who recap­tured it for the United States got a ticker tape parade Tues­day up Fifth Avenue, passing not far from the club that was home to the trophy for 132 years. Dennis Conner, who lost the cup to Australians in the New York Yacht Club's 1983 defense with the vessel Liberty, won it back at the helm of Stars & Stripes last week while sailing for the San Diego Yacht Club .

playing down there, but she's very athletic and she makes very good moves to the basket. She is difficult to stop." 
The Irish will have to pay at­tention to more than Pack, however, if they hope to come away with a win. 
"(Detroit) has a very mature team--they're a senior team," said DiStanislao. "Two of their leaders are fifth-year seniors. They're all capable of handling the ball and pushing it up the floor. We're going to have to do 

Heidi Bunek 
what we do well to win. We're going to have to handle their pressure and get the ball in­side." 
The Irish also will have to contend with the hot hand of Detroit's Daphne Smith, whom DiStanislao labeled a "downtown shooter." The three-point line will be in effect for this game since the Midwes­tern Collegiate Conference, of which Detroit is a member, 
DiStanislao noted the contin­uous improvement of sopho­more Heidi Bunek and the emergence of freshman Annie Schwartz into a solid per­former as positives for her team at this point in the season. Both players have played a key role in ·what has been a strong Irish inside game these past few weeks. 
"Heidi Bunek has made great strides in accepting a role and responsibility on this team. And Annie has come a long way. She probably has the best offensive rebounding instincts on the team, and she has a nice outside shot. As the year goes on she'll learn more about how to position herself to get more shots and rebounds." 
Notre Dame and Detroit will hit the court tonight at 7:05 
p.m. in Detroit. This is the first of two tough road games this week, as the Irish head to Ten­nessee to play the seventh­ranked Volunteers on Satur­day.

day, some scouts were citing this year's recruiting batch as "one of Notre Dame's best ever," Holtz virtually sealed that honor with the addition yesterday of two of the country's most-prized blue­chippers. 
Running back Tony Brooks, a 6-1, 215-pounder out of Tulsa, Okla., and tight end Frank Jacobs, a 6-3, 225-pounder who hails from Newport, Ky, both verbally agreed to attend Notre Dame next fall. Brooks, consid­ered to be the No. 1 runner in Oklahoma, turned down an of­fer from the Oklahoma Sooners to play for Holtz, while Jacobs, an almost-unanimous choice as the top tight end prospect in the country, finally refused over­tures from Penn State and Ken­tucky. 
Those two players join an im­pressive list of other prep players who have verbally committed to attend Notre Dame. Ricky Watters, a run­ning back from Harrisburg, Pa., coveted by Penn State and many other college powers, an­nounced last week his inten­tions to come to Notre Dame, following other highly-touted recruits such as quarterback Kent Graham (Wheaton, Ill.), defensive end Andre Jones (Hyattsville, Md.), and offen­sive lineman Scott Kowalkowski (Orchard Lakes, Mich.). 
Notre Dame's recruiting base, meanwhile, can truly be said to be national, with players coming from all over the continent. One recruit, run­ning back Lincoln Coleman, hails from the same area in Dallas, Tex., as that of current Irish star Tim Brown, while wide receiver Brian Dowler, a prep star from Florida, is the son of former Green Bay Packer star, Boyd Dowler.

By MARTY BURNS Sports Writer 
Today is an official day of rest for the nation's college football coaches. Mter months of travelling around the country, searching out high school talent and making their recruiting pitches, today is the day coaches can finally sit back and start dreaming about na­tional championships. 
Because today is the first day high school recruits can offi­cially sign a letter-of-intent to play college football at the school of their choice. 
And from all indications, Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz can settle in for a long winter's nap secure in the knowledge that his first real recruiting class under the Golden Dome is also one of the best in the nation. 
Holtz filled all 30 scholar­ships which Notre Dame had to offer this year with quality players, and to the astonish­ment of many scouts, he plugged the exact holes which he most needed to fill.

No Better Action around than in NBA 
Last Sunday's NBA All-Star Game was filled with suc­cess stories. 
Tom Chambers, the hometown hero, won the game's MVP after being named to the team as an afterthought. Julius Erving played marvelously in his last mid-season classic. And to top it off, the game went into overtime, with Rolando Blackman hitting two free throws with no time remaining to force the extra period.

It is rather fitting that the NBA be blessed with such a 
momentous showcase. Mter all, the league itself is quite 
a success story_ 
The NBA used to suffer from poor attendance, lack of 
depth in its teams and a lack of general excitement. Today, 
what Larry Bird and Magic Johnson started in terms of 
building fan interest, Michael Jordan has elevated to an­
other level. And with the addition of the marginal fans 
Jordan brings in, the NBA is more popular than ever_ In 
fact, now some people can even swallow the notion that 
the players actually play defense. 
It's so popular now that the All-Star Game has become' 
an all-weekend affair, instead of one day with the stars. 
The Legends Game, the 3-Point Shootout and the Slam­
Dunk Championship keep the fans' attention for six hours 
on the day before the game, and then, if anyone has any 
energy left, the game arrives on Sunday. Whew. The 
demands of being popular, I guess. 
But the All-Star Game is only a reflection of the overall 
strength of the league. Boston and Los Angeles still have 
no company in champions' circle, but the gap is not nearly 
as wide as it was just a few years ago. In years past, fans 
from Milwaukee, Detroit, Atlanta, Houston and Dallas 
could just sigh when the Celtics or the Lakers were picked 
in preseason predictions. Only Philadelphia fans could get 
away with a disdainful chortle or guffaw. My, how things 
have changed. 
In case you couldn't tell by his level of play, Kareem 
Abdul Jabbar is within earshot of 40 years old. (Hint: if 
you don't believe me, try to remember the last time he 
had a full head of hair.) And also if you haven't noticed, 
the Lakers don't have anything that could resemble a 
center ready to take his place. That means one of two 
things: one, the Lakers will trade for a center soon, or 
two, the Lakers will fall a notch in the scale of the mighty 
when Kareem retires. He says it will be next year. Of 
course, he also said it would be last year. 
The Boston Celtics are not the dominating team they were even last year, either. Remember that season Bill Walton had last year, where he was healthy· the whole year? Most people are beginning to think the writers of "Dallas" created that dream too. Don't expect this dream to come back three times and become a reality though, because Walton's healthy seasons are all in the scrap­books. So are the Celtics' dominating ones. A team with no bench help past its eighth player cannot be a permanent kingpin, even though Larry Bird will keep them close. 
But who will catch these two? Perhaps no one this year, but it gets more difficult for them every year. 
If you throw out the Los Angeles Clippers, who are petitioning for membership in the Continental Basketball Association every time they take the court, every team can say it has a shot at the playoffs because of the NBA's ridiculous playoff system that doesn't separate the men from the mice, it separates the living from the dead. But even though all playoff teams do not have a legitimate shot at the Lakers and Celtics, the list of those who do grows every year. 
The Atlanta Hawks have perhaps the best shot at the Elite Two, based solely on the talent in the front line. Dunkmaster extraordinaire Dominique Wilkins leads a crew. of muscular leapers that can rout any team in a 
snap. 
Houston challenged the Big Two last season, but the Rockets have been shot down by drug scandals that cut Mitchell Wiggins and Lewis Lloyd from the picture. That, combined with Ralph Sampson's weekly trips in and out of Head Coach Bill Fitch's doghouse, have kept the Rockets from duplicating last year's success. 
Dallas is the newest team to become bored with mediocrity. The Mavericks took a journeyman giant, James Donaldson, added a sprinkle of playing time--and POOF--they had themselves a center capable of taking them to the title. 
Milwaukee is a contender as long as Don Nelson, the league's best coach, is at the helm. But with the health of
