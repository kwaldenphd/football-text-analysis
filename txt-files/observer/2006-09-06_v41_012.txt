About 40,000 people attended the stadium pep rally before the USC game last October, he said. 
Students from the host dorms -Keenan, Stanford, McGlinn and Welsh Family -can enter the Stadium between 5:00 and 
5:30 p.m. All other Notre Dame students with identification can enter between 5:15 and 5:45 
p.m. The general public is allowed to enter at 5:45p.m. 

Despite the change in loca­tion, the basic pep rally format will remain the same, said Hall Presidents Council (HPC) co­chair Katie Cordelli. 
On Friday, the new Leprechaun will be introduced, the porn squad will perform and the football team will make an appearance. Cordelli said they also booked "solid talent" from other student groups to partici­

New Notre Dame spot airs during Ga. Tech gam_e 
Promotional placement features 'champion' alums in less controversial ad than last year's 'Candle'

Notre Dame Stadium will be the site of thousands of cheering fans not once, but twice this weekend. 
Head football coach Charlie Weis, along with the athletic department, made the decision to hold the first pep rally of the year in the stadium to accom­modate the large number of fans expected to attend, associ­ate athletic director John Heisler said. 
While Heisler can't predict exactly how many people will attend on Friday, it is safe to say the rally will draw more fans than the 12,000 who could fit in the Joyce Center.

The new Notre Dame institu­tional spot aired before half­time during the Georgia Tech game Saturday and features three Notre Dame alums who are "champions" in their fields -a much more secular approach than last year's ·con­troversial "Candle" spot. 
The 30-second commercial spins off the common Notre Dame catchphrase "Play Like a Champion Today" and show­cases alums Mark Monahan,

esc picks theme for progra111s 
Economic justice will be addressed in events 
By BECKY HOGAN 
News Writer 
While the Campus Labor Action Project focuses on eco­nomic issues within the Notre Dame community, the Center for Social Concerns is taking a wider lens to the problem of poverty by making its theme for the year "Economic Justice For All." 
The theme derives from the document "Economic Justice For All," a piece written in 1986 at the U.S. Conference of Catholic bishops that addresses the devastating reality of poverty throughout the world. 
"We chose the document as our theme because we want­ed to look at how Notre Dame can look at poverty and the needs of the community through the lens of Catholic social teaching," said Bill Purcell, associate director of Catholic Social Tradition and Practice. 
The CSC will use the issues addressed in the document to shape many of the events, service learning seminars, lectures and forums it spon­sors throughout the year. The Justice Education Team, along with Father Bill Lies,

Speaker addresses jihad

While the title of Karim Douglas Craw's lecture Tuesday afternoon was "Building Muslim Hearts and Minds," he ended up providing insight into the hearts and minds of people of all spiritual backgrounds. 
Crow, an associate profes­sor of Contemporary Islam at the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies in Singapore, said he believes the problems faced by Muslims are human prob­lems -the unwillingness both to face the truth and to see in terms of complex realities instead of simpli­fied dogmas. 
These human problems translate into the Muslim community, according to Crow, in the form of funda­mentalists.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Feels like home 
I cannot say enough good things about living off-campus. Granted, driving to class is a pain (although I'm batting 1.000 on attendance thus far), but the daily adven­tures in my life more than make up for the 
15 extra minutes K t G 1
of commute time a e a es in my day. And to 
Assistant Sports 
be honest, when 
Editor
your earliest class is at 11 a.m., that 15 minutes is probably a worthwhile sacri­fice. 
My first and favorite off-campus adven­ture is going grocery shopping. This sounds lame until you realize the endless possibilities that grocery shopping offers. Racing other shoppers for the last chicken­and-wild-rice Lean Cuisine when Martin's is running a 5-for-$10 special on those delectable frozen meals is a thrill than only a true supermarket aficionado can experi­ence. 
In this vein, Martin's is by far my favorite grocery store, both for its convenient loca­tion and the deliciousness of its Side Door Deli. Don't feel like cooking? (An odd feel­ing at the supermarket, but I'm not judg­ing.) Try a delicious panini sandwich, soup-to-go, the salad bar or a Ready Made Meal. 
Seriously, I could dedicate a whole col­umn to Martin's. And their muffins. Particularly the chocolate-chip ones. After pulling off the Indiana Turnpike on August 18, Belmont Beverage wa.<; obviously my first stop. But a close second was Martin's -to pick up my Advantage Card, of course. 
In short, I highly recommend the won­derful world of Martin's to the discerning grocery shopper. 
Oosely related to grocery shopping is its end result: Cooking. Although I am confi­dent that my housemates and I will soon tire of making delicious meals from scratch -and I admit it's only really happened a few times in the last three weeks-there's something about sitting around a table together that evokes a real feeling of family and togetherness. 
Five girls around the kitchen may take feminism back several decades, but I get a really rewarding feeling from the team­work of making a meal both nutritious and delicious. Or maybe that's the fact that, in the Italian style, wine is an important part ofour dinners together. Either way, it's a nice feeling. So is laying on the couch wearing "turkey pants" afterwards, in fact. Which brings me to the next great part of living off campus: Space. 
I absolutely love having a room to myself. On the walls hang my dad's old Zahm interhall football jersey, circa 1978, signed photos ofPaul Hornung and Rocky Bleier and a Luxembourg flag. There's also a fake plant that occupies a special place in my heart, mostly due to Dad's mocking of the frivolousness of it. Either way, Tmy Room is a great place for studying, relax­ing and watching "Flavor of Love." 
In short, I highly recommend you find yourself a good group of people and move off campus. 
While it is unlikely that you will be lucky enough to find a house directly between Rocco's and Oub 23, with off-the-street­parking, a porch swing and women asking for "money for a cab ... okay, or a beer" showing up on your doorstep at all hours -wait, that might not be a positive -if your experience is anything like mine has been thus far, it may well be the best year of your life.

Rockne Men1orial gets nevv gyn1 equipn1ent 
Fitness centers expect frequent student use

Members of the Notre Dame community used the University's fitness centers 350,000 times last year, and both the Rockne Memorial and Rolfs Recreation Center have taken measures to respond to the high volume of users. 
Several new workout bikes were added at the Rock, and which "truly extends the [machine's]life," Phillips said.

Talk discusses I.T. ethics 
Start of Berges Lecture Series focuses on tech companies in China 
By STEVE KERINS 
News Writer 

While many people think the Chinese government has total autonomy over its citizens ­that's not the case when it comes to freedom of expres­sion and multinational corpo­rations operating in China. 
The Berges Lecture Series launched its string of six talks on business ethics with a panel discussion Tuesday evening entitled, "Freedom on the Internet and the Ethical Responsibility of I.T. compa­nies in China," with this issue as its heart. George Enderle, the O'Neil professor of interna­tional business ethics, moder­ated the discussion. 
Lionel Jensen, department chair of East Asian languages and literature, was the evening's first speaker. Jensen provided an overview of issues relevant to the use of the Internet in China today. 
"Technology itself may be value-neutral, but it is always employed in a specific cultural context," Jensen said. 
Describing Chinese govern­ment policies directed at infor­mation control, he said, "Rights in such a context are better understood as privi­leges." 
Jensen said Internet access is now widely available in China, especially for young, educated people. He also 
described the rapid growth of information technology opera­tions in China, which has led to conflict with the govern­ment. 
"The [Chinese Communist Party] has encouraged the use of the World Wide Web," he said, but it is less able to regu­late it than it was before the advent of blogging capability. 
Jensen also spoke about the government's latest attempts to restrict the flow of informa­tion across its borders, which he said were "backed up by real policing power." 
It is against this background, Jensen said, that many inter­national companies are willing to cooperate with state censor­ship to increase their Chinese market share. 
Father Oliver Williams, director of the Center for Ethics and Religious Values in Business, followed Jensen. He compared the current situation businesses face in China with that encountered by multina­tional corporations in South Africa before the demise of apartheid. 
Williams said freedom of expression, freedoms to receive and impart informa­tion and right to privacy are among the key human rights issues relevant in the Chinese business environment. 
"If [multinational companies] were complicit in human rights abuses ... it would be unethical for them to stay [in China]," he said. 
Williams also touched on mechanisms for change in the Chinese government's approach to these issues, not­ing its increased emphasis on lifting Chinese citizens out of poverty. 
The final speaker theology professor David Clairmont, who examined how Catholic moral theology might be applied to the issues of Internet freedoms and interna­tional business in China. 
Clairmont posed questions on the morality of accepting restrictions on human rights imposed by the Chinese gov­ernment. 
"[For corporations) to abide by the laws of the land in which they do business is to be complicit...in a qualified good," he said. "Compliance with law has an element of tes­timony ... giving credence to the laws that exist." 
Clairmont said "a further examination of our laws about freedom of information" is needed in the current debate. 
The Berges Lecture Series is presented.each fall by Notre Dame's Center for Ethics and Religious Values in Business and the Institute for Ethical Business Worldwide. The next lecture, entitled "What's Hot in Business Ethics," is scheduled for Sept. 18.

pate in the pep rally. 
Last year, pep rally organizers started to require that non-stu­dents have tickets to get into the Joyce Center -a rule not in place on Friday, Heisler said, due to the "virtually unlimited seating" at the stadium. But after the USC game last October, attendance at pep rallies declined, and event organizers overestimated the number of students who would attend later pep rallies. · 
This year, organizers will make student-seating designa­tions one week at a time after· they estimate what the student interest is for the rally, Heisler said. 
"I think the track record over the course of years suggests that those numbers do vary from week to we~;Jk," Heisler said. 
"That is probably the biggest challenge, trying to do every­thing we can to protect what the seating is for students." 
Cordelli said the 1-IPC, the Student Activities Organization and the athletic department have been discussing ways to encourage students to attend rallies later in the season when the game hype is not as intense. 
"The issues with the pep ral­lies and the time frame -we are doing all we can to have the students not have to get tickets," Cordelli said. "It can be frustrat­ing standing in line, then sitting there for 30 minutes waiting to start. 
"With this season being maybe a national championship season, students are more excited, so we have tried to schedule the times to make it a little less time consuming -but some things just can't be avoided." 
It's a logistical impossibility to avoid a waiting period between when students enter the Joyce Center and when the rally starts, lleisler said. 
"It's just not physically possi­ble," he said, "to think that if you are going to start a pep rally around six o'clock, you can open the doors 10 minutes before­hand and expect everyone to lind a seat." 
Last year, to cut down on entry time, the organizers stag­gered the entry times and moved the approximately 12,000 attendees through differ­ent entrances of the JACC, he said. 
Friday's pep rally will be the first one senior Ann Verwilst has attended in more than a year. Verwilst said she always goes to the rallies if she can, but last year she was abroad, and her freshman year physics lab con­flicted with the rally time. 
"I think everything about them is great," Verwilst said. "It just gets a little repetitive."

executive director of the esc. chose .this year's theme. 
Sean Agniel, a graduate stu­dent in the Master of Divinity Program helping to coordi­nate many of the events spon­sored by the esc this year, said the 20th anniversary of the document "calls for ongo­ing inquiry and demands that the document be revisited." 
"[This year's theme] reminds us that our salvation is tied up with the salvation of the world [and calls] us to think about who we are as Christians," Agniel said. 
Purcell said the CSC plans to use the document as "a reminder that issues of eco­nomics have values behind them." 
"There are multiple ways of exammmg poverty and we wanted to do it in an interdis­ciplinary way" he said. 
Purcell said the lectures, forums and other events planned throughout the year are not only for students but also for faculty and members of the local community. He hopes this year's theme will help people look beyond the Notre Dame community, he said, to consider national and international issues of eco­nomic justice. 
One of the first events spon­sored by the esc in connec­tion with "Economic Justice for All" will be a documentary presented by the Higgins Center Labor History Film Series called "Meeting Face to Face: The Iraq-U.S. Solidarity Tour." This 27-minute docu­mentary will be shown in the I-lesburgh Center Auditorium Monday. 
Several students involved 
with the esc will also be pres­ent at the Notre Dame Academic Forum on Sept. 14 to discuss the global health crisis. 
In October, Pulitzer-prize winning journalist and author David Shipler will give a lec­ture on his book, "The Working Poor." The CSC and Mendoza College of Business will co-host the lecture. 

The CSC chose a theme as the basis of the year's service opportunities and seminars to try to engage all members of the Notre Dame community in issues of poverty and econom­ic justice, Purcell said. If this approach works well, he said, the esc will plan on selecting different themes in the future. 
"We have already begun talking about themes for the upcoming year," he said.

Government pushes professor purge 
TEHRAN, Iran-Iran's hard-line president urged students Tuesday to push for a purge of liberal and secular university teachers, another sign of his determination to strengthen Islamic fundamentalism in the country. 
With his call echoing the rhetoric of the nation's 1979 Islamic revolution, Ahmadinejad appears determined to remake Iran by reviving the fundamentalist goals pursued under the republic's late founder, Ayatollah Huhollah Khomeini. 
Iran still has strong moderate factions, and since taking office a year ago Ahmadinejad has moved to replace pragmatic veterans in the government and diplomatic corps with former military commanders and inexperi­enced religious hard-liners. 
50 Taliban dead in NATO strikes 
KANDAHAH, Afghanistan -Artillery and airstrikes killed between 50 and 60 suspected Taliban militants Tuesday, and NATO's civilian chief warned that insurgency-wracked Afghanistan could again become a failed state if the international community loses the battle to stabilize it. 
The U.S. troops, operating under NATO command, clashed with the militants in Panjwayi district of Kandahar province, where an offensive began over the weekend to flush out hundreds of Taliban fighters. NATO has already reported more than 200 Taliban killed in the operation. 
Maj. Quentin Innis, a NATO spokesman, said the troops had identified Taliban positions and the two sides had exchanged fire. He said the estimate of 50 to 60 killed was based on reports from troops looking through "weapons sights and other observation devices."

McClellan resigns as Medicare chief 
WASHINGTON -After eight months over­seeing the new Medicare drug benefit, the biggest change since the health program's beginning, Mark McClellan said Tuesday it was time to move on. 
McClellan. 43, has been with the Bush administration from the start, and he has been at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services since March 2004. 
"My kids don't remember me in a job where I got home regularly for dinner. It's just time," said McClellan, the father of 7­year-old twin girls. "We've gotten a lot accomplished and I'm very confident with the track the agency is on." 

Florence forms in Atlantic Ocean 
MIAMI -Tropical Storm Florence formed far out in the open Atlantic on Tuesday, and forecasters said it will proba­bly become a hurricane. 
But they said it was too soon to tell whether the sixth named storm of the hur­ricane season would reach the United States. 
Florence had sustained wind near 45 mph, 6 mph over the threshold for a tropi­cal storm. The minimum for a hurricane is 74 mph. 
"Our forecast does have it becoming a hurricane by Friday morning -minimal hurricane, Category 1," National Hurricane Center meteorologist Mark Willis said.

The trooper escaped without life-threaten­ing injures, but suffered a broken vertebrae and many cuts, police said.

Bush quotes Osama's strategy 
President cites previously unreleased documents about intentions for Iraq; world 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

Quoting repeatedly from 
Osama bin Laden, 
President Bush said 
Tuesday that pulling U.S. 
troops out of Iraq would 
fulfill the terrorist 
leader's wishes and pro­
pel him into a more pow­
erful global threat in the 
mold of Adolf Hitler. 

With two months until 
an Election Day that 
hinges largely on national 
security, Bush laid out 
bin Laden's vision in · detail, including new rev­
elations from previously 
unreported documents. 
Voters were never more 
united behind the presi­
dent than in the after­
math of the Sept. 11 
attacks, and his speech 
was designed to convince 
Americans that the threat 
has not faded five years 
later. 

Democrats have been 
increasing their criticism 
of the president's policies 
in Iraq as the congres­
sional elections 
approach, with the latest 
salvo coming in a letter 
Monday that suggested he 
fire Defense Secretary 
Donald H.umsfeld. 

The White House reject­
ed the idea. 

"It's not going to hap­
pen," spokesman Tony 
Snow said in a lengthy 
rebuttal to the 
Democratic letter. 
"Creating Don Humsfeld 
as a bogeyman may make 
for good politics but 
would make for very 
lousy strategy at this 
time." 

To make the adminis­
tration's strategy clear, 
the White House on 
Tuesday published a 23­
page booklet called 
"National Strategy for 
Combating Terrorism," 
which Bush described as 
an unclassified version of 
the strategy he's been 
pursuing since Sept. 11, 
2001. The booklet's con­
clusion: "Since the Sept. 
11 attacks, America is 
safer, but we are not yet 
safe." 

Democrats dismissed 

Bush's actions as a public relations strategy that avoided real solutions. 
"A new glossy strategy paper doesn't take the place of real change that will make our country safer," said Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis. 
"If President Bush had unleashed the American military to do the job at Tora Bora four years ago and killed Osama bin Laden, he wouldn't have to quote this barbarian's words today," said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. "Because President Bush lost focus on the killers who attacked us and instead launched a disas­trous war in Iraq, today Osama bin Laden and his henchmen still find sanc­tuary in the no man's land between Afghanistan and Pakistan, where they still plot attacks against America." 
Bush's speech was the second in a series linked to next week's anniver­sary of the Sept. 11 attacks. It was delivered to the Military Officers Association of America in a hotel ballroom filled with U.S. troops, includ­ing several injured in the war, and with diplomatic representatives of foreign countries that have suf­fered terrorist attacks. 
Bush planned a third speech Wednesday from the White House, laying out his plan to change the law so that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, can be tried for crimes before military commissions. 
Bush argued Tuesday 
that history will look favorably on his currently unpopular war strategy. 
"History teaches that underestimating the words of evil and ambi­tious men is a terrible mistake," the president said. "Bin Laden and his terrorist allies have made their intentions as clear as Lenin and Hitler before them. The ques­tion is: Will we listen? Will we pay attention to what these evil men say?" 
To make his case, the White House cited previ­ously unreleased docu­ments including a copy of the al-Qaida charter found by coalition forces in Afghanistan that says hostilities will continue until everyone believes in Allah. 
MEXICO 

Calderon named president-elect 
Associated Press 

MEXICO CITY -Felipe Calderon was declared president-elect Tuesday after two months of uncertainty, but his ability to rule effectively remained in doubt with rival Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowing to lead a parallel leftist government from the streets. 
The unanimous decision by the Federal Electoral Tribunal reject­ed allegations of systematic fraud and awarded Calderon the presi­dency by 233,831 votes out of 41.6 million cast in the July 2 elections -a margin of 0.56 percent. The ruling cannot be appealed. 
Calderon now must win over millions of Mexicans angry that President Vicente Fox, who is from Calderon's party, didn't make good on promises of sweeping change -and fend off thousands of radi­calized leftists who say they will stop at nothing to undermine his presidency. 
Lopez Obrador, whose support is dwindling but becoming more rad­ical, has said he won't recognize the new government and vows to block Calderon from taking power Dec. 1. Protesters outside the tri­bunal wept as the decision was announced and set off firecrackers that shook the building. 
"We aren't going to let him gov­ern!" Thomas Jimenez, a 30-year­old law student, screamed as hun­dreds of protesters threw eggs and trash at the co"urthouse.

IN BRIEF 
Intel cans 10 percent of its workforce 
SAN JOSE, Calif. -Chip-maker Intel Corp. said Tuesday it will eliminate 10,500 jobs -about 10 percent of its work force -through layoffs, attrition and the sale of underperforming business groups as part of a massive restructuring. 
The Santa Clara-based company said most of the job cuts this year will come from its management, marketing and infor­mation technology ranks, and will expand in 2007 to include manufacturing, design and other segments. 
The cuts are expected to save the compa­ny $3 billion per year by 2008. Severance costs are expected to total $200 million. 
The world's largest chip maker is fighting to reverse sinking profits and make it more efficient as it seeks to regain market share stolen by smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. 
"These actions, while difficult, are essen­tial to Intel becoming a more agile and effi­cient company, not just for this year or the next, but for years to come," Chief Executive Paul Otellini said in a statement. 

Viacom's CEO Tom Freston booted 
NEW YORK-The board ofViacom Inc., frustrated with the media company's lagging stock price, has ousted Tom Freston as CEO and replaced him with Philippe Dauman, a former Viacom executive and longtime board member. Chairman Sumner Redstone said Tuesday he hopes the new team will be more aggressive and entrepreneurial. 
Dauman's business partner Thomas Dooley, another board member, is also assuming an active role with the newly created title of chief administrative officer. Freston had only been in the job since the beginning of the year, when Viacom split up with CBS Corp. 
The news of Freston's sudden departure got a poor reception among investors, who pushed the company's shares down $2.08, or 5.6 per­cent, to close at $34.89 in heavy trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. "We think that it was too early for the board to replace Mr. Freston, who is a seasoned media executive," Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a note to clients.

Gulf of Mexico oil field tapped 
Discovery boosts nation's reserves by more than half; biggest find in a generation 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -A trio of oil companies led by Chevron Corp. has tapped a petroleum pool deep beneath the Gulf of Mexico that could boost the nation's reserves by more than 50 percent. A test well indicates it could be the biggest new domestic oil discovery since Alaska's Prudhoe Bay a generation ago. 
But the vast oil deposit roughly four miles beneath the ocean floor won't signif­icantly reduce. the country's dependence on foreign oil and it won't help lower prices at the pump anytime soon. 
"It's a nice positive, but the U.S. still has a big dif­ference between its con­sumption and indigenous production," said Art Smith, chief executive of energy consultant John S. Herold. "We'll still be importing more than 50 percent of our oil needs." 
Chevron on Tuesday esti­mated the 300-square-mile region where its test well sits could hold between 3 billion and 15 billion bar­rels of oil and natural gas liquids. The U.S. consumes roughly 5.7 billion barrels of crude-oil in a year.

envelope from the University. She then turns to the sky to pray. 
"Candle" sparked debate because some students and alumni felt it projected a far too narrow image of Notre Dame or suggested that faith alone could get an applicant into the University. 
When asked whether the "Candle" spot would run again, Crnkovich said it was likely the new spot would run all fall. 
"Every year, we try to pro­duce a fresh spot," she said. "Sometimes we choose to rotate in an old spot, but I think this year our intention is to use the 'Play Like a Champion' spot." 
Senior Sara Woolf labeled the spot "a big improvement" from last year's commercial. 
"I felt that last year's ad did­n't really show what Notre Dame is about," she said. 
And showing what Notre Dame is about is exactly what the University hopes to achieve. 
Notre Dame football is not only prime time television, Crnkovich said -it is also prime time for the University to market itself to a national audience. 
In addition to the new insti­tutional spot, Crnkovich said the University has produced "seven one-minute vignettes that focus on different academ­ic and research areas of excel­lence at the University. These vignettes are treated, in a sense, as one minute news sto­ries that will highlight these areas." 
She said the University's partnership with NBC enables this opportunity for additional media exposure, allowing the vignettes to air during regular commercial time.

Crow said Islamic funda­mentalists "do not do critical analysis," but rather believe fate causes misfortunes when Muslims do not pray enough. 

This fundamentalist over­simplification is a result of "the lack of a 'deformist' men­tality in the Muslim world ­an anti-intellectual, anti­rational. and even an anti­spiritual mentality that rejects the most critical part [the spir­ituality] of the Muslim legacy," he said. 
A similar mentality can be seen in American culture, he said, in the oversimplified depictions of the "good West" battling the "fundamentalist Middle East," "totalitarianism" or "terrorism." The use of these broad terms, Crow said, is "unhealthy always, but dan­gerous when done by leaders." 
The primary oversimplifica­tion by Islamic fundamental­ists occurs regarding the sacred concept of the jihad, he said. 
"[Jihad fills a] legal, cultur­al, spiritual, political and mili­tary role. It is a form of sacri­fice and suffering by giving up one's 'inner life,"' Crow said. "[Jihad must bel a struggle for the welfare of others, not just for one's own transformation." 

Crow told the story of Abdul Ghaffar Khan, a Pakistani pacifist who worked with Gandhi to non-violently secure Indian independence from Britain, as one of the most successful historical jihads. 
"Jihad can be understood peacefully, but it has been submerged in headline·-grab­bing actions of destruction," Crow said, using the Khan story.­
Crow described himself as on a personal, intellectual jihad, which serves to "expand the mind and thoughts to see a concept." A peaceful jihad can also take the form of a moral, athletic or philosophical strug­gle, he said. 
Crow was born in Lebanon to American and Lebanese parents. He converted to Islam as an adult. Crow opened the lecture in "traditional Muslim fashion" with a prayer and stressed his own spirituality throughout the afternoon. 
"It is painful for a Muslim to talk of our troubles. Some say that we should only talk to other Muslims about the prob­lems," he said. "But it is too late to criticize ourselves only in private." 
Throughout the lecture, Crow emphasized two diver­gent paths that those on a jihad can take -the path of bloodshed, symbolized by ani­mal sacrifice and suicide bombers, or the path of spiri­tual development taken by Abdul Khan. 
"I do not think that God wants the spilling of our blood in sacrifice," he said. "Rather, I think that God wants the sweet smell of our spirit." 
Crow spoke to an audience mostly comprised of faculty, graduate students and mem­bers of the South Bend com­munity, as well as undergrad­uate students. The lecture was held in a Hesburgh Center seminar room with an over­flowing crowd. 
The attendance pleased Crow, who described his mate­rial as "a profoundly impor­tant issue that affects each and every one of us."

First artificial hearts approved by FDA 
Only patients close to death will use device 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON A 
Massachusetts company 
received federal approval 
Tuesday to sell the world's first 
fully implantable artificial 
heart. 
The 2-pound mechanical 
hearts would be used only in 
patients who are close to death 
and have no other treatment 
options. 
The Food and Drug Administration granted Abiomed Inc. a humanitarian exemption allowing it to sell the AbioCor artificial hearts, agency spokeswoman Susan Bro said. Surgeons likely will implant between 25 and 50 of the devices a year, though the company has approval to sell up to 4,000 annually, Bro said. 
"We're talking about a small

group of end-stage patients, whose choice is between immediate death or new. inno­vative technology," said Dr. Daniel Schultz, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. 
So far, the artificial heart has been tested in only 14 men. Two died from the operation, and another never regained consciousness. The rest sur­vived only an average of five months, though notably one patient lived 10 months follow­ing surgery, and another 17 months. The latter patient, Tom Christerson, died in February 2003 after moving home. 
The company said earlier that it would begin implanting the artificial hearts at five hos­pitals around the country once doctor training is complete. Unlike other permanent artifi­cial hearts, including the Jarvik-7 implanted in Barney Clark in 1982, the AbioCor is fully contained within the chest, with no outside wires. 
"I think as the technology improves, it's going to be a good option for people," said Dr. Laman Gray, a University of Louisville surgeon who was part of a team that implanted the first AbioCor. That surgery was done at Jewish Hospital in Louisville, which is expected to be among the five hospitals offering the mechanical hearts to patients. 
Abiomed is targeting men ­but not precluding women ­with heart failure who are too sick for a heart transplant, have exhausted other options and are likely to die within a month. The current device is too large for about 90 percent of U.S. women and many men. The company is developing a smaller and longer-lasting ver­sion. 
In 2005, an FDA panel of outside experts voted against recommending Abiomed be given permission to sell the device in limited numbers. At the time, the experts expressed concern that many AbioCor recipients suffered severe strokes, some fatal, that com­promised their final weeks. 
The FDA then worked with the company to refine the niche device. 
"At the end of the day, the FDA was convinced the spon­sor had met the bar," said Dr. Bram Zuckerman, director of the FDA's Division of Cardiovascular Devices. 
The company now believes a redesigned cuff on the devices will prevent two bars from coming into contact with human tissue. That contact was believed to be the cause of the strokes in some of the first test patients, said Michael R. Minogue, the company's presi­dent and chief executive offi­cer. 
The Danvers, Mass., compa­ny also hopes to implant the hearts in patients who can be treated with blood-thinning drugs, further reducing the risk of stroke, Minogue said in a recent interview. Two patients who received hearts with the redesigned cuff and anti-clotting drugs did not suf­fer strokes, he said. 
"We want to. focus on getting the right patients and getting them home, so whatever that number is, that is what it will be," Minogue said.

My new favorite techie accessory is the ear clip. The sleek, stylish earpiece popping up in middle aged men's ears like there is no tomorrow. And who doesn't love mobile Web casts? Information is liter­ally at our finger­tips. Yet, are we using these advancements in science and technol­ogy to improve and protect our world? Or are we conve­niently ignoring the science presented to us like spoiled chil­dren solely con­cerned about our own selfish desires? 
During the past few months, there have been several major movements in the combat against global warming. AI Gore made a movie and Tom Brokaw did a television special highlighting the dangers and realities of this ultimate disaster. Both media per­sonalities involved scientists and experts to help in the production of the shows. Major time and money were also invested to make the American people aware of global warming and its dan­gers. Millions of Americans watched the film and/or television show and, unless completely cold-blooded, walked away with alarming knowledge and hopefully a little fear. 
U seems like this is not the first time we have been warned about heated world issues. As I recall, experts, such as doctors of Middle Eastern studies, warned government officials that going to war in Iraq would be a horrible mis­take. Intensely aware of Iraqi and Middle Eastern culture and society, 

Katie Palmitier 
It sounded better in my head 

these experts knew that if we declared war, the lighting would result in a quag­mire-and most likely a civil war. 
It seems for years scientists have been warning us of the dangers of global warming, but me, being young and naive, never really paid att-ention or felt fear because it was not going to happen to me during my lifetime, so I did not have to deal with it. We all had the Alfred E. Newman approach of "What, me worry?" However, I now realize that it is going to affect me and is affecting others in the world as we speak. Tragic, destructive hurricanes and tsunamis have devastated millions in the past year alone, and scientists predict the number of these natural disasters is only going to rise, along with their destructive power. Both of these disas­ters are just the beginning of the global warming cycle, which scientists prom­ised would happen. Although we do not have to worry about hurricanes and enormous waves in Indiana we do need to look at these disasters as personal warning signs. While a Noah-like flood may not happen in my lifetime, it could very likely happen to my children or grandchildren. Little things can be done starting today to protect our posterity and ourselves. 
Sadly, our generation has held onto this worry-free, selfish mind set for too long. Perhaps your parents or aunts and uncles took place in Vietnam War protests. Their generation stood up for themselves and fought to put an end to an unnecessary war. Yet our genera­tion, as a whole, sits back quietly, listen­ing to our iPods, saying and doing noth­ing about the current war that could have been prevented, and nothing about the possible life or world ending tragedies that can be prevented. 
Our generation has the opportunity to make a difference when we vote who will represent us in making decisions that affect our society and society's future. It seems now, as well as in years past, the government has blatantly lied to us, ignoring expert opinions and the well being of the country. Therefore, it is crucial that number one, we all vote, and number two, choose a representa­tive that will truly look to our nation's best interest when making some of these decisions. 
We also have a choice when we choose how we get our information. Watching Fox News, reading only the sports section of the newspaper, and Googling celebrity gossip is NOT how we should obtain our knowledge about the world. Do we need to resort to hav­ing Bill Nye the Science Guy on MTV or dating Summer on The O.C. to spark the inner scientist in all of us? Read the front page of a newspaper and watch an entire news broadcast from an unbi­ased station. When we start getting real news and information, we can start making a real difference. 
It is time to wake up to our cell phone alarms and smell the Starbucks. We are living in a world currently suffering from war and the early stages of global warming. It is time for our generation to do our part in providing a better place for us all to live. Besides, who wants to bring their little Domers to the ND vs. USC game in 120-degree heat?

Police priorities 
It seems to me that the biggest problem facing the crime and citation controversy surrounding off-cam­pus housing is poor prioritizing by the South Bend Police Department. If the SBPD has enough time and resources to check the Internet to find out when and where a party occurs, then why do they not have · enough manpower to stop {or at least curtail) the recent series of robberies and assualts against stu­dents? 
There are certainly worse things that could hap­pen than some college students drinking and listen­ing to music -things such as muggings and armed robberies. The students of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's contribute put in an enormous amount of service hours in the community, and we are repaid like this? This appears more than a little unfair to me.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Economics, 111orality and the academic fonnn 
This year's Academic Forum coincides nice­
ly with the twentieth anniversary of the U.S. 
Catholic Bishops' letter "Economic Justice 
For All." The bishops felt compelled to· 
respond to the devastating effects of poverty 
they witnessed in the 1970s and 1980s. "That 
so many people are poor in a nation as rich 
as ours is a social and moral scandal that we 
cannot ignore" (No. 16). The Economic 
Pastoral continues to challenge and encour­
age American Catholics. 
It calls each of us at Notre Dame to consid­
er the economy, in all its elements, as subject 
to the demands of morality; to make our­
selves aware of the concrete realities · imposed on the poor; and, most importantly, 
the letter calls us to "conversion and common 
action, to new forms of stewardship, service, 
and citizenship" (No. 27). 
Does the U.S. economy serve the needs of 
persons (especially the poor), or do people 
serve the economy? Do we, as individuals and 
as a University, participate in the U.S. econo­
my in a way that builds community and soli­
darity in our world? 
In "Economic Justice for All," the bishops 
intended to make available the riches of 
Scripture and Tradition so that we might 
think more creatively about the plight of the 
poor and the complexities of the economy. 
They call us to pop the "Notre Dame bubble," 
and to become aware of what life is like for 
the destitute in South Bend and beyond. If 
you have not yet, consider participating in 
one of the many opportunities offered by the 
Center for Social Concerns that try to move 
us toward solidarity. 
We desperately need liberation from ideolo­
gies and quick fix policies. The 20th anniver­
sary of the economic pastoral gives us an 
opportunity to subvert sound bytes and 
address core problems. Let's read this docu­
ment together, study it, pray over it, and 
work out how best to live it. 
How can the pastoral guide our research, 
shape our programs, liturgies, dorm pro­
gramming, and service? The upcoming 
Academic Forum is a great first step to meet 
this challenge. Make sure you attend.

Recent raids not constructive 
I feel as though all we ever hear about here at Notre Dame is the relationship between Notre Dame and the South Bend community ­how it's not positive, how our com­munity doesn't have a cooperative relationship with the residents of South Bend, how it needs improve­ment. I think it is apparent that there's another relationship we have with South Bend that needs no improvement at all: the one between the Office of Residence Life and Housing and the South Bend Police, or rather the Indiana State Excise Police. On Monday, The Observer reported that 86 people were cited at Turtle Creek Apartments. 
The article mentioned no com­plaint about noise or disruption, sim­ply that an "anonymous complaint was received concerning a party list­ed on MySpace under events and also under people's blogs." I don't know any student that would be so offended by a party simply listed on a social Web page to take the matter to law enforcement officials. I do however know that ResLife has access to Facebook, another social Web page much more likely to list events such as this party. Maybe I am incorrect in that assumption. 

The more important point is that over the past couple years, it seems as though the Turtle Creek Apartments, located near the soccer fields, practically on campus, have been targets of mass raids by police. 
Students partying at houses far­ther off campus are more likely to walk home through unsafe neigh­borhoods or, even worse, simply drive drunk. Maybe the police think that this is a good plan; maybe Notre Dame does too. 
I, for one, though, think that these raids, which encourage increasing amounts of students to move further and further away from campus and into the South Bend neighborhoods, are irrational and frankly danger­ous. The University notifies us con­stantly of assaults and attacks that occur as students walk home late at night, sometimes after consuming alcohol -they're just making us walk even farther to return to cam­pus and pushing us even farther away from the Notre Dame commu­nity.

Personal information 
Being human beings, we all make mistakes; it is inevitable. Eighty-eight people in particular made mistakes Friday evening that they all must live with for the rest of their lives. They are both upset and embarrassed at the events that took place that night. The only thing that could make their situation worse is having the entire Notre Dame community know about it. Revealing people's personal infor­mation such as a name or an address in a front page article of the school newspaper read by thousands of stu­dents is both unprofessional and unethical. 
I am not against the fact that the 


uncecessary 
incident found its way into The 
Observer. When something of this 
size and importance to the local 
community takes place, it is the 
responsibility of a journalist to make 
these events known to the public. 
However, there exists a great differ­
ence between reporting the news 
and negatively portraying people in 
the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's 
community. 
There is no excuse for releasing 
names of those arrested, addresses 
of the incidents or even the extracur­
ricular activities of a resident who 
wasn't even involved. The fact that 
these pieces of information made 
their way into the school paper is a very negative testament to the staff of The Observer. All those involved in the publishing of the article should be incredibly ashamed of themselves, and realize that as students, they are only hurting the community that we work so hard for at Notre Dame. When people make mistakes, we should let them deal with it personal­ly, not advertise these mistakes to 8,000 more people.

"Echoes of Glory: The History of Notre Dame Football" is an amazing highlight reel. The number of games from which footage was drawn is the documentary's high point. However, a low production value and Roy Scheider's uninspired nar­ration bring this DVD down. 
The documentary begins with a time­line of the coaches of Notre Dame and devotes more time to the good than the bad. Ara Parseghian and Lou Holtz get more screen time than Gerry Faust and Bob Davie -an imbalance that is to be expected. This section ends with Charlie Weis as the new head coach and pays lit­tle attention to the controversy of Tyrone

Willingham's firing. Again, this is not sur­prising since the over-arching focus of the production is Notre Dame's tradition and its football highs -not the lows. 
The· DVD goes on to discuss the rival­ries that Notre Dame has developed over the seasons. The USC rivalry begins with Knute Rockne and goes all the way through Willingham's last season. Out of no fault of the production team, last year"s USC game, while still fresh in Notre Dame's memory, is missing. 
The Army rivalry -which began with coach Jesse Harper-was first an argu­ment over money. Army wanted to pay Notre Dame $400, but Notre Dame want­ed $1,000. The University eventually got the money it wanted and traveled to West Point for the game, which left the running forward pass as its legacy. The 30-40 yard passes that Notre Dame used in this high-profile game were the first many people had seen in American foot­ball. 
The fmal sections review Notre Dame's Big Ten rivalries, including the team's first football game against Michigan and the drama of Notre Dame's bids for admission into the Big Ten. After all this history, of which the producers were able to include a large amount, the DVD goes over the greatest games in Notre Dame history and the greatest Bowl games. The highlights are impressive, and the video obtained from some of the games must have taken copious amounts of research. The 1952 Notre Dame­Oklahoma and 1988 Notre Dame-Miami games are also featured. 
The DVD extras are excellent addi­tions. The Knute Rockne speeches are amazing pieces of history that any Notre 
Dame fan should 


watch. To see the man that founded Notre Dame football on film talking to his players is an experience that puts Notre Dame foot­ball in perspective, and it is quite moving to see where Notre 
Dame came from  - 
the  hard  work  of  
many people.  


There is also an extra about the Band of the Fighting Irish, which gives the group its due in the history of Notre Dame football. The band did exist before the team, and this extra gives the group some credit usually reserved for the football team. 
However, this DVD suffers from rela­tively low production values. It looks inexpensively made -surprising, given its association with Warner Home Video. A better narrator could also have been used. Scheider does a line job but sounds old and somewhat bored. This DVD is great for highlights, which abound. The history is interesting but not presented very well. 
With a bit more money and a better director, this DVD could have really "woken up the echoes."

'THE NEw GoLD STANDARD' BooK REVIEW 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Editor 

Tim Pristnr's "The New Gold Standard: Charlie Weis and Notre Dame's Rise to Glory" may initially conjure up bad mem­ories of Alan Grant's "Return to Glory: Inside Tyrone Willingham's Amazing First Season at Notre Dame" -but 2005 wasn't 2002, and Weis isn't Willingham. 
Still, Prister's new volume, published Tuesday, falls prey to the same problems as Grant's -namely, too cursory an analysis and an overly reverent portrayal of the subject. 
Throughout the book, Prister takes veiled jabs at both Willingham and Davie, though it could be argued these are 
The New Gold Standard: Charlie Weis and Notre Dame's Rise to Glory 
Tim Prister 


The biggest problem with "The New Gold Standard," however, is that it's not very insightful. Parts of it read like AP game recaps, and other portions feel like highlight reels of Weis' press confer­ences. Prister summarizes, not analyzes. 
"The New Gold Standard" also has the odd problem of being at once too cursory and too detailed -its lack of analysis is countered by an over-reliance on sound bytes and game specifics. The game descriptions, particularly of the USC game, are nothing new to even casual Notre Dame fans, which means Prister's sense of audience may be slightly skewed -and there probably aren't many Irish fans wanting to read another detailed description of the end of the USC game anyway. 
Prister has nothing 


deserved. He discusses the justifications for firing Willingham, but his research comes into question when he claims that "it was an unspoken, yet unbreakable rule: barring scandal, death, or wartime, it was understood that no Notre Dame head football coach would be dismissed until he'd had a minimum of five years to establish his program." The assertion apparently ignores Hunk Anderson, whose resignation was forced rather than voluntary. 
Prister's approach is not without humor, as the chapters have such titles as "The Tyrone Willingham Years -All Three of Them," "Let the Beat-Down Begin" and "Break Out the Champagne." Tho book reads very quickly and Prister's casual tone fits his approach quite well. His love for Notre Dame football is obvi­ous. though it does slightly skew objectiv­ity, as Ilomerism seeps through in many sections of the book. 
but praise for Notre Dame's coach. There is precious little about the "man behind the myth," as it deals only with superficial, public infor­mation about Weis' per­sonal life. "The New Gold Standard" isn't the insightful revisionism of Murray Sperber's Knute Rockne in "Shake Down 
the Thunder," nor is it the hero-worship of Grant's Tyrone Willingham in "Return to Glory." It sim­ply recounts what Weis publicly did and said, without much comment on either other than lines of praise scattered throughout. 
Doesn't writing a book about Weis after only one season seem a bit premature? 
Yes, it does. Weis, with his "9-3 isn't good enough" banner, would be the first to admit that he hasn't achieved his goals yet. Prister might have been better off waiting for a few years until a more com­plete and insightful portrait of Weis and his coaching came into focus. As it stands, "The New Gold Standard" has too little to discuss, though the hope is that Prister's praise of Notre Dame's new coach doesn't ultimately turn out to be as ironic as Grant's was three years ago.

NOTRE DAME IN THE MEDIA 
By BRIAN DOXTADER AND ERIN 
MCGINN 
Scene Writers 
The relationship between the media and Notre Dame is the very definition of love-hate. Open any magazine or newspa­per referencing collegiate sports and, whether the writer likes Notre Dame or not, it is nearly impossible for the Irish not to be mentioned. 
The Irish appear all over the media world. One of the most recognizable places is in the movies. Notre Dame has had two silver screen movies made about its football team. Lloyd Bacon's ("42nd Street") "Knute Rockne All American" (1940) stars Pat O'Brien as Knute Rockne, arguably the most famous coach in the history of college football, the coach of the Irish from 1918-1930. 
An icon of the football world, Rockne himself literally changed the sport by inventing the forward pass. Former President Ronald Reagan plays the role of George Gipp, whose death lead to the fondly remembered and oft-quoted "win one for the Gipper" speech. 
Nineteen ninety-three brought David Anspaugh's ("Hoosiers") film "Rudy" to the big screen. Based on a true story, "Rudy" stars Sean Astin ("Lord of the Rings") in the title role as Rudy Ruettiger, -a kid who worshipped Notre Dame football enough that he did all he could to become a part ofthe team. 
Despite tremendous obstacles, Rudy eventually makes it to Notre Dame and becomes a legend in his own right. Astin is very moving in the lead role, and the film is also noteworthy for the appear­ances of Jon Favreau and a young Vmce Vaughn. 
There have also been several DVDs released about Notre Dame football in recent years, the most recent including "The History of Notre Dame Football" and to-be-released on Oct. 31 is "University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish -Collector's Edition (College Football's Greatest Games)."

VIDEO GAME REVIEW 

NCAA Football2007 scores big, delights fans 
Latest edition of football game features improved graphics, more control 


The difference between the real Brady Quinn and his pixellated twin can be tough to determine. EA's best-selling video game features unparalleled graphics. 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Editor 

There are some certainties in college football that are like clockwork ­someone from the Seminoles will get arrested, Michigan will be overrated, the BCS will be a mess and EA Sports will release a new version of "NCAA Football." 
"NCAA Football 2007," however, may be the best version yet. It tweaks improvements from 2006 but retains last year's playability. 
The biggest change to "NCAA Football 2007'' is the Campus Legend mode, which is really just a revamped Race for the Heisman from 2006. The user creates his or her own player, chooses a position and goes through training camp, which then gains the player scholarship offers to various schools. Once at the school of choice, the player is immediately inserted into the starting lineup, no matter how unrealistic -a freshman QB obviously wouldn't get the start over Quinn, but that's how it goes in the game. 
Campus Legend mode requires play­ers to balance academics (with majors ranging from Division I-A Mascots to Chemistry) and football with a schedule that allows them to choose where they want to concentrate. Focus too much on football, and the GPA slips (which can make a player ineligible). Conversely, focus too much on academ­ics, and on-field performance suffers. 
The schedule is controlled from a "dorm room," which gets bigger and fancier in each succeeding year ­though it seems pretty unlikely that a Notre Dame or UCLA player would have a Reggie Bush poster hanging on the wall. 
While the mode is actually pretty easy, it unbalances the game by driving the player to use his or her created character more often than is realistic. It's conceivable to win the Heisman all

four years at running back, quarter­back or even receiver, even on the highest difficulty level, as long as you keep feeding your player the ball. This leads to 50-yard bombs late in the fourth quarter when you're ahead by 30 just to pad stats. 
After three or four years, you are given the choice to either export your player to Madden 2007 or to coach ­which is pretty funny, since a 22-year old player probably wouldn't get to be head coach at a D-IA school, even if he did win the Heisman four years in a row. 
Dynasty mode, however, remains the core of the game, as players try to lead their teams to multiple national titles. Players can recruit in-season and invite prospects to visit during key games. 
There are welcome new features, including more varied playbooks and a new "momentum meter" which shifts according to big plays dur­

grabs momentum and gives its players a performance bonus. 
For the most part, the graphics are very good and much improved. The collision engine is better, which means that players rarely run through each other anymore. On the other hand, there are still no gang tackles or shared sacks, even though sometimes it appears that there should be. 
Other animations, especially celebra­tions, are also back and better than ever, although EA needs to fix a few things in the future. There's nothing more bizarre than watching a running back celebrate a two yard run up the gut. 
The game balance, once the series' Achilles' Heel, is much easier in 2007. The running game works as players break tackles, fall forward, push for extra yardage and blockers actually hold their blocks once in a while. Receivers have a greater tendency to catch balls thrown their way, with far fewer inexplicable drops. 
EA has also fixed the balance issues from previous year, which heavily favored mobile quarterbacks. Though they are still extremely effective (espe­cially Troy Smith and Pat White, who runs amok against slower defenses), better defensive recognition and QB spy plays that actually work help negate their advantage and make pock­et passers like Quinn and Brian Brohm more viable. 
The AI, unfortunately, is still dumb as rocks, even on the highest difficulty, which means an offense (or defense, for that matter) can continually run the same play and the computer won't pick up on it. No matter the opponent, you'll feel like you're playing against a Greg Robinson-coached team every time. 
One of the most frustrating parts of the game is the frequency of roughing the kicker and running into the kicker penalties, especially on extra point tries. A penalty is incurred about every other attempt -a stunningly high fre­quency, especially given its rarity in actual games. 
In fact, special teams as a whole are problematic. The new "over-the-shoul­der" cam used when defending punts and field goals is nice and an interest­ing idea, but it makes blocking the kick way too easy. A similar cam is used when fielding kickoffs and punts, which makes it much harder to see downfield. 
The kicking game, however, is much· improved. Kickoffs and punts are now controlled using the right analog stick (think "Tiger Woods Golf"), which makes it much easier to be accurate. 
Historical rosters are once again in the game, though these seem merely transferred from previous editions, which means Notre Dame's 1977 quar­terback still isn't Joe Montana (though he is, oddly enough, the starter on the All-Notre Dame team) 
The unfortunate absence of the absolutely loaded All-America team from 2005 is a bit disappointing for those who would love to see Reggie Bush and Vince Young line up in the same backfield and Paul Posluszny and AJ Hawk wreaking havoc together at linebacker. 
College ball is, in many ways, more exciting than the NFL and the ability to run "gimmick" offenses like Spurrier's fun-and-gun, Meyer's spread option and the triple option attack give the game increased playability. 
There are still some issues with the AI and graphics, but for the most part, "NCAA Football 2007'' is the best game of its kind. And if that's not enough, for the first time in the game's history, Notre Dame is one of the best teams in the game, which means that, at long last, you too can go out there with all you've got and win just one for the Gipper.

Associated Press 
ROME -Italy's Marco Materazzi said he insult­ed Zinedine Zidane's sis­ter, revealing nearly two months after the World Cup final what provoked the French star to head­butt him in the chest. 
In Tuesday's interview with the Gazzetta dello Sport, Materazzi dis­closed that after he held his opponent's shirt, Zidane said: "If you want, I'll give you the jersey later." 
"I responded that I pre­ferred his sister, it's true," Materazzi said. "It wasn't something nice, true. But luckily there 

have been dozens of players who have con­firmed that a lot worse things are said on the field." 
Zidane was sent off after receiving a red card for the he ad-butt. Italy went on to win on penal­ty kicks. 
Materazzi received a two-game ban for the July 9 incident and will miss Wednesday's rematch of the final, a 2008 European Championship qualifier. Zidane received a three­match suspension, but he retired after the World Cup. 
Materazzi said that the Italian federation, in the 
IN BRIEF 
Rainstorm ruins Phillies 
starter's major league debut 
PHILADELPHIA -Brian Mazone bounced around from the independ­ent leagues to the minor leagues, waiting and hoping for an opportu­nity to pitch in the majors. 
The Philadelphia Phillies were finally ready to give him a chance, only to have bad weather alter those plans. 
Mazone, a 31-year-old left-bander, was to make his big league debut on Wednesday against the Houston Astros. However, rain postponed Tuesday night's game between the Phillies and Astros. 
It has been rescheduled for Sept. 
25. So, Randy Wolf, who was to start Tuesday night, will take the mound on Wednesday against Andy Pettitte. 
Meanwhile, Mazone repacked his bags and headed to Rochester, N.Y., to pitch for Triple-A Scranton Wilkes-Barre in a playoff game Wednesday. 

middle of a match-fixing scandal, told him not to complain about the inci­dent during a FIFA hear­ing. 
"If accepting without raising my voice was the price to pay for having brought home the World Cup, I'm pretty happy to have paid it," Materazzi said. 
Asked if the two could make peace, Materazzi said: "You sign a peace (agreement) after terrible 
wars,  so  why  can't  
Zidane  and  I  make  
peace?  

"A peace among men, without a lot of publicity. The door to my house will always be open for 
that. And if Zidane wants, he knows where to find my address." 
France captain Patrick Vieira thinks the apolo­gies should go both ways. 
"I think Zidane is wait­ing for Materazzi to apol­ogize also for the insults he used," Vieira said. 
Vieira, who is Materazzi's teammate at Inter Milan, said he chat­ted with him before leav­ing to join the France squad. 
"He told me he is disap­pointed not to be here," Vieira said. "He's a very cheerful guy, but he loves to wind people up. Sometimes you need to know when to stop." 

Purdue safety out for year
wih hyperextended knee 
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. -In one freakish moment, Torri Williams went from being a starting safety at Purdue to a having an uncertain football future. 
Williams got his right foot caught in the new Bermuda grass at Ross-Ade Stadium in the third quarter Saturday against Indiana State. The resulting hyperextended knee has put him out for the season and raises questions about whether he'll play for Purdue again. 
Coach Joe Tiller said the earliest Williams could return is next fall. 
"What I'm most concerned about is, because of the severity of the injury, is that we do the right thing so that this guy can hopefully experience a complete recovery," Tiller said. 
Williams' roommate, fellow defen­sive back Zach Logan, said team­mates are trying to help however they can. 
Jankovic advances to first 
Grand Slam semifinal 
NEW YORK -Jelena Jankovic lost so many matches in a row this year, she lost count. But she'd taken enough stats classes in college to figure this: It was probably time to quit tennis and go back to school in Belgrade. 
On Tuesday, Jankovic graduated -to her first Grand Slam semifinal, that is -by taking away No. 4 Elena Dementieva's serve and coasting 6-2, 6-1 at the U.S. Open. 
"I cannot believe that I won in two sets," Jankovic said. "What was the score? I don't even know the total score." 
Shortly after she finished, rain began and the other daytime singles matches were postponed until Wednesday. Seventh-seeded Nikolay Davydenko led No. 17 Andy Murray 6-1, 5-7, 6-3; 2000 U.S. Open cham­pion Marat Safin led Tommy Haas

NHL 
.-Malkin evades pressure to remain in Russia 
One of world's best players will be lethal threat for Penguins 
Associated Press PITTSBURGH -Finally, Evgeni Malkin wasn't worried about hiding his emotions or himself. He signed the contract he wanted to sign, with the team he wants to play for. Malkin, under so much pres­sure to keep playing in Russia that he hid out for five days in Finland to escape his Russian team, signed his first NHL con­tract Tuesday with the Pittsburgh Penguins. · No arm-twisting or middle-of­the-night negotiations were needed to make him sign a deal worth at least $3 million and probably much more. The 20­year-old Malkin was so deter­mined to play in North America this year, one of Russia's best­known sports figures was will­ing to risk his image back home to do so. "His dream was to come to Pittsburgh and start his career in the NHL, and he had to go through a lot in the last couple of weeks to achieve that," Penguins owner Mario Lemieux said. "It's always difficult when you've got a different country and a different language, and it will be tough for him for the next few months." It has already been a tough 
time for arguably the best play­er in the world not previously in the NHL. Malkin, a gifted but not one-dimensional scorer and playmaker, is expected to team with 19-year-old Sidney Crosby to give Pittsburgh a dynamic 1­2 center combination. 
After signing a one-year deal last month to remain with his hometown Metallurg Magnitogorsk, reportedly at 3 
a.m. following hours of persua­sion, he immediately regretted the decision and phoned agent 
J.P. Barry for help. 
Barry arranged to meet Malkin at the Helsinki airport when Metallurg arrived for training camp on Aug. 12, and the two secretly left together. They stayed hidden in a hotel there for five days until Malkin was granted a U.S. visa. 
The agent wasn't as con­cerned as much for Malkin's safety as he was that the Russian team, which was still in town, would try to get him back. 
"We were worried that when­ever there's a mystery and someone can't be found, they would try to look for him and if they could find him, they would try to continue the psychologi­cal pressure," Barry said. "We didn't want that to happen. It was really necessary for us to keep him away from that possi­bility." 
According to Barry, Malkin was followed to his home -the agent isn't certain by whom ­whenever the team felt he had been in contact with his North American-based agents. 
Once Malkin was gone, Metallurg general director Gennady Velichkin rebuked his star and threatened to sue the Penguins. Barry expects Metallurg to file for an injunc­tion that would prevent Malkin from playing in the NHL, though no Hussian team has ever suc­cessfully done so with a player once he has left. 
Malkin said he has patched up his relationship with Velichkin the last few weeks, after he was initially worried about how the team and its fans would react. 
"I definitely was a little con­cerned," he said, speaking through interpreter Olga McQueen. "But, knowing him for so many years, I had to believe that he wouldn't go for any harsh measures toward me. After I had my visa obtained, I called my parents and informed them that everything was fine and I was doing great. They contacted Mr. VeUchkin and actually now they are doing well and Mr. Velichkin doesn't have any hard feelings against me." 
Among those supporting Malkin's decision was Russian national team coach Slava Bykov, who said the star for­ward should be allowed to play wherever he wants. Three weeks ago, Malkin faxed a let-ter of resignation to Metallurg Malkin spent three weeks which, according to his agents, training in Los Angeles area allows him under Russian law before arriving in Pittsburgh on to quit his job there.

BLOCK PARTY 
NFL 

Mannings deny personal rivalry 

Siblings say Sunday's matchup is centered on teams, not each other 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Peyton Manning hoped one training camp interview session would e'nd the questions about Sunday's Brothers Bowl. As his New York brother might say: Forget about it. 
With Gotham's most hyped brotherly battle since perhaps the DiMaggios, the Manning vs. Manning affair has become the opening weekend's marquis matchup -much to the family's chagrin. 
"They've both said it's a game between two teams, and it is," father Archie Manning said dur­ing Peyton's recent bowling tournament in Indianapolis. "The media is trying to make it out to be Tiger vs. Phil or some­thing, but it's not like that." 
Certainly the Manning clan would prefer to downplay the first-ever football meeting between Eli and Peyton, Archie's sons who were both taken No. 1 overall in their respective draft classes. 
Peyton, the two-time MVP, tried to diffuse the situation the first week of training camp when he answered the ques­tions he expected from the moment schedule-makers put the Giants-Colts game in prime time on Week 1. Afterward, Peyton said he wouldn't talk about it again. 
Good luck. The blackout will undoubtedly end when Peyton holds his usual Wednesday news conferences this week.

hype, and I'm proud of the way the boys are handling it." 

Relying on 14 years of NFL experience and nine more as an NFL father, Archie Manning has tried to keep things in perspec­tive as the sibling rivalry looms. He's not saying whether the family has scheduled a sewing project to create those trendy half-Giants, half-Colts shirts, and, like his boys, insists Sunday night's matchup really is more than a family affair. 
The duel has created some intriguing family planning, though. 
Last month, Peyton said he'd already taken care of most tick­et requests because Giants play­ers had a limited supply. 
Archie also wouldn't say whether similar comments com­ing from his sons in New York and Indianapolis were choreo­graphed. Peyton and Eli both said during the preseason they're more concerned with the opposing defensive ends 
defensive ends, 
the potent offens­es and th~ playoff-type atmos­phere he expects Sunday night. 
Peyton's teammates have another take. They aren't plan­ning to give their quarterback's younger brother the kid-glove treatment. 
"We can't hit ours, so we've got to hit one of them," Colts defensive end Robert Mathis said as the talk began in earnest Monday. 
It may not be the genteel stuff Archie and Olivia Manning hoped for. Then again, Archie, understands; this is football and quarterbacks have to take their licks -even his sons. 
For the record, Peyton said he hasn't lost to Eli in a sporting event since a pickup basketball game when he was playing at Tennessee and Eli was still liv­ing at home. This time, the stakes are much higher, much grander and the loser may have to live with the legacy for not days, but years.

er," head coach Bobby Clark said. "He has all the credentials to be one of the best attacking players in this country. We knew that before he scored four goals, and I don't think it changes now." 
Individual honors have already started to pile up for the Irish offense, even though the season is still early. Lapira was also named Big East Offensive Player of the Week, becoming the second Irish striker in as many weeks to earn that honor. 
Senior Justin McGeeney earned the ilistinction after he scored two goals in a 4-1 rout of Creighton ­which was also ranked No. 8 at the time-during the opening week­end of the season. 
"Scoring goals early is always a good thing; it relieves a lot of pres­sure, especially as a forward," McGeeney said. "If you don't score goals, the tension kind of builds up." 
Despite the stellar individual performances of his forwards so far this season, Clark remains wary of too much individual praise. 
"Sometimes you get [these awards] and sometime you don't, but I think you usually get them when the team's done well," he said. "When [a forward] scores a goal, there's usually an assist behind the goal,. and somebody had to win the ball first so it's usu­ally a team effort." 
Clark also noted that it takes a special type of player to be a goal scorer at this level. 
"If you are a forward, you're always living on the edge," he said. "There's always a fine line between it being a great game and it being a not so great game, and I think that's part of it, you need to be tough to survive and be a for­ward." 
This season, the Irish have five players who meet Clark's descrip­tion for goal scorers and who will compete to split time this season -Lapira, McGeeney, sophomore Bright Dike, junior Kurt Martin and freshman Tamba Samba, who could prove to be a solid contribu­tor despite the talent ahead of him. 
"It keeps everybody on their toes," Clark said. "One of the nice. things is that someday maybe it's not their day, or they get a minor injury like Justin had last weekend [missing the Indiana game], and the other players are very happy to fill in,; They all get on tremendously well. 
Naturally, the battle for playing time means there is strong compe­tition-even in practice. 
"There's rivalries; there will always be rivalry, but there's also great camaraderie," Clark said. 
However, the players see the intra-squad competition as a posi­tive. 
"We're playing people in practice that are just as good as half the people we come up against [in games], and that just makes us that much better," Lapira said. "I know that if I go out and bust my [rear] for 30 minutes, somebody else can come in for 15 minutes and bust theirs .... It just gives us a lot of opportunities for people to sub on, and we're confident that every forward that subs in is going score goals." 
Clark also believes each of his forwards will rise to the occasion during the course ofthe season. 
"Bright [Dike] can break out as well, [and] I wouldn't be surprised if Bright breaks out this weekend," he said. "Kurt Martin can also get goals ... and then, you know, you've got Tamba Samba waiting in the wings. We're very talented in that respect." 
As an offensive unit, each player plays a unique role on the squad, especially McGeeney, the only sen­ior forward Notre Dame has this season. 
"[McGeeney is] the father of all the younger strikers," Clark said. "He's the father of them all­maybe the grandfather of them all. He's the elder statesmen. They all look up to him, and he carries himself very well." 
McGeeney creilits the team's off­season workouts for the improved attack displayed early this year. 
'The spring was good for getting all of us on the same page," he said.. "More than anything, it was just getting us forwards together getting us to work with each other [and] work off each other. We know the kinds of runs each other makes. We kind of complement each other and know how each other play and it makes it easier." 
The two most experienced strik­ers, Lapira and McGeeney, have become especially close in their time together. 
"Me and 'Geeny have been play­ing together for three years now, [and] of the forwards, me and Justin are by far the closest friends," Lapira said. "We have our own little pregame ritual, and it's been that way since the begin­ning. It helps a lot having him." 
According to Lapira, that ritual includes writing the same phrase on their chests before each game. To Lapira however, the ritual is dose to his heart-and he's keep­ing it that way. 
"I don't think you would want to put that in the paper," he said. "It's just personal." 
Ironically, despite their history together and the fact that they have accounted for all but two of 


Notre Dame senior forward Justin McGeeney turns towards the goal in a 4-1 win over Creighton Aug. 27 at Alumni Field. 
Notre Dame's goals this season, neither McGeeney nor Lapira has scored while the other is on the field. 
"We kind of joke about that," Lapira said. "We play so well together we just haven't gotten it done this year." 
As far as the rest of the season, Lapira believes he has the exact goals as the rest of the forwards ­and the rest ofthe team. 
"I just want to make everyone else around me better, I guess that's every one of our goals, just to step up and make the team bet­ter," he said. "As a team, we just got to keep playing consistently. Obviously, everyone's goal is to make the tournament and win it, but it's a long way until then, so for now our goal is to beat South Florida." 
They'll get their chance Friday night at 7:30 at Alumni Field.

"We'll see how the games go as · to whether we play them or not," Waldrum said. 
Next week, when Bock and Dew resume full workouts with the team, Waldrum said they will have to earn their starting spots back. 
Several players, including fresh· men Amanda Clark and Michele Weissenhofer, have played well in the absence of Bock, a forward, and Dew, a defender. Notre Dame is 4-0 without Bock and Dew in the lineup and has scored 16 goals while allowing just two so far this season. 
"It's going to pose problems for us, but in a good way," Waldrum said. "Obviously, as well as the team has performed at times, it's going to be important to get them back, but at the same time the players who have been out there have done just fine. 
"We're going to have to see how everyone does at practice and then figure out our lineup." 
· Bock and Dew were in Russia since Aug. 12. The U.S. beat Congo, Argentina and France to advance out of the group stage, then downed Germany 4-1 in the quarterfinals. ln the semis, Team USA lost in a shootout to China after a scoreless tie and then fell to Brazil in the third place game, also_on penalty kicks. 
The Irish will take on TCU in Fort Worth, Texas at 7 p.m. Friday. The game against SMU in Dallas will begin at 1 p.m. Sunday.

"We're going to give them the week to get adjusted to the travel and the time zone and recover from the tournament they just fin­ished," Waldrum said. "More importantly, we're giving them time to get the academic side of things taken care of. That's got to

Lapira part ofstacked Irish scoring attack 
By ERIC RETTER Associare Sports Editor 
In the 98th minute of Sunday's game against Indiana, junior forward Joseph Lapira won the ball, beat the Hoosiers' last defender to the inside and chipped the ball into the back of the net -giving No. 8 Notre Dame a 5-4 victory. 
Lapira's game-winning goal was his fourth of the day in the win over the Hoosiers (ranked No. 8 heading into the game). His four-goal total was one shy of Notre Dame's all-time record set by Kevin Lovejoy in 1993 (5). 
For his efforts, which set a record in the 24-year history of the adidas/IU Credit Union Oassic, Lapira was named Top Drawer's National Player of the Week and the offensive MVP of the tournament.

Butkus winner awaits Notre Dame Saturday 
By BOB GRIFFIN Sports Wrirer 
Penn State linebacker Paul Posluszny injured his right knee in the fourth quarter of the 2006 Orange Bowl -a bizarre positive for the Nittany Lions, but a definite negative for opposing offenses this season. 
Posluszny's team went on to beat Florida State in an epic three-overtime 26-23 victory despite his injury, and the senior linebacker from Aliquippa, Penn. was forced to sit out through spring prac­tice even though his knee did not require surgery. 
But with the lllJUry, Posluszny was also likely forced to abandon any thought of entering the NFL draft after a season where he registered 116 tackles and three sacks. The NFL combine takes place during the off­
season  - the  same  time  
Posluszny  was  recovering  
from his injury.

Penn State's coach deflect­ed questions about the buildup to Saturday's game, insisting he can only focus on the strategy of the game at hand. 
"I haven't got the slightest idea of hype," Paterno said in his weekly teleconference Tuesday. "We've got a good tough football game to play. ... Hype is hype. Somebody would have to describe hype to me. I'm not even sure I could spell it correctly."
