ND physicists help with 'Big Bang' experiment 
Six faculty members joined dozens of scientists in particle project to gain insight into universe's creation 
ByJENN METZ 
News Editor 
Notre Dame particle physicists are par­ticipating in an experiment almost 20 years in the making designed to uncover the mysteries of the universe moments after its creation. 
The experiment, which uses a particle accelerator called the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), launched Wednesday in Geneva, Switzerland. 
The Notre Dame team, part of a larger contingent of American physicists and sci­entists from many countries around the world, at the forefront of the field of par­ticle physics, has been working on the project since its inception in 1993, Associate Professor of Physics Colin Jessop said. 
"We've been a part of this community for many, many years," he said. 

Six faculty members are involved in the project: Professors Randy Ruchti, Michael Hildreth, Mitchell Wayne, Kevin Lannon, Dan Karmgard, along with Jessop. 
Two post-doctoral researchers, Jeff Kolb and Nancy Marinelli, are currently at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, better known by its French acronym, CERN, in Switzerland, the oper­ation center for the LHC. 
The LHC collides protons -subatomic particles -together at extremely high energies. The $10 billion machine is located about 300 feet beneath the ground on the French-Swiss border and spans a circumference of 17 miles. 
A ring of superconducting magnets accelerates the particles to extremely high energies, "almost to the speed of light," Jessop said.

.Welsh Fam hosts 'fiesta' on quad 
By ROBERT SINGER 
News Writer 
Spurning their usual location on West Quad and introducing a theme for the first time, the Welsh Family Block Party organ­izers decided to head "south." 
They put on their sombreros and threw a "Fiesta" on South Quad for three hours Wednesday night. 
As music blared, partygoers were entertained by an array of carnival games. An inflatable obstacle course and fun house, free pizza, chips and salsa, bal­loon darts, volley ball, wiffie ball and a ping pong toss for the chance to win a gold fish were among the attractions. In addi­tion, an iPod shuffle was raflled off and T-shirts were sold. 
Wednesday's Fiesta was the highlight of Welsh Family Hall's spirit week, which has tradition­ally been an effort to boost hall pride and raise money for a wor­thy cause. In years past, the event has raised donations for Hurricane Katrina victims and for schools in third world coun­tries. 
Dorm president Tara Schimpf said earlier events this week have included yoga, dorm break­fasts, s'mores and an after-mass social.

Residence halls to host prayer service 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
Associate News Editor 
Seven years ago today, Lewis Hall rectress Linda Cirillo was doing an internship as a chaplain at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington D.C., when terrorists flew an airplane into the Pentagon in nearby Arlington, Va. 
Cirillo, who had retired as a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force after 20 years of service, became "intimately involved" in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 ter­rorist attacks, a day when planes also struck the World Trade Center Towers in New York City and a plane crashed to the ground in Shanksville, Pa. 
"I was actually there on the frontline in the hospital with one of the burn victims that escaped and got out of the Pentagon alive, but not without being burned from head to toe," she said. 
Cirillo, who is now a certified Catholic chaplain, ministered to the burn victim, a lieutenant colonel in the Army. The man survived his injuries. 
Cirillo will share her memories of Sept. 11 today during a prayer service on Fieldhouse Mall to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the worst terrorist

I just love football 
When I began actively watching foot­
ball, there was no NFL team in 
Baltimore. I was stuck in the interreg­
num between the Colts leaving in 1984 
and the Havens showing up in 1996. 
This lnft me with a gaping hole in my 
fandom. Sure, I had the Orioles for 
basoball and the Terps for basketball, 
but what was I to do on Sundays? Who 
would be my team'! 
And then, I remember this gun-sling­
ing eountry boy who just loves football. 
Brott Favre. 
No, this is not Jay Fitzpatrick meant to be sar­castic, nor is it my 
Managing

Editor 

on the Frank 
Caliendo-John 
Madden bit. Brett Favre just loved the 
game, and that made him and the 
Packers fun to watch. 
And so my hopes and dreams rose and fell with the fate of the Green Ray Packers. I can remember how great I felt when Favrn led his team to Super Bowl glory against the Patriots, and how down I was when he fell to the Broneos the next year. 
Evon after the Havens moved to town, I still held a special place in my sporting heart for Favro, who was thankfully in the other conference. To me, he was the unparallelnd best football player in the league, and I did nothing but support everything he did. 
Fast forward to 2008, when Brett 
Favrn rntiros in winter. 
;\ part of me is sad that one of my last childhood ieons is moving on, going the way of Cal Hipken, Jr. But the !-,>"UY had just brokon every major career passing record and was a sure-thing Hall of Famor. EA Sports announcnd that Favre would graen tho eover of' Madden 09 ­the first rntirod player to do so. 
But then, over the summer, as you all assurndly know if you watched, listened to or read anything sporL<>-related dur­ing a three-month span, Favre came back in a kind of sleazy way. Most of his former fans (except a few diehards in Wiseonsin) turned their back on him. The conversations changed from where he ranks among all-time 6'1"eatest quar­terbacks to a more South Parkian ques­tion of whether he is a giant douche or a turd sandwich. 
And yes, even I turned my back on him. 
But then, during my fantasy football draft, as I scrolled through the QB rank­ings searching for a backup quarter­back, I saw "Favre, B. NYJ." Debating between him and the Broncos' Jay Cutler, I took nearly my full 90 seconds. And then I caved. In a rebirth of my childhood passion for the Packers, I took Favre. 
And then last Sunday, when the NFL made its long awaited return, I watched the JeL'> game -likely the only time I have watched a Jets-Dolphins game with such vigor and enthusiasm, to watch Favre do his thing. And he did not disappoint. Watching the Jets last Sunday, I saw the same Brett Favre that made me a Packers fan in my youth. 
The city has changed. The shade of green has changed. But the Favre remains the same. He is still the gun­slinging country boy he always was. 
So lay off Brett Favre. He just loves football.

Large detectors, "sort of like a giant digital camera," whkh were in part designed by the Notre Dame team, will be there when the collisions happen to collect data, Jessop said. 
These machines deteet all the partieles that arn ereated in the eollisions, whieh will replicate the partieles in existence about one microsecond after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. 
This, Jessop said, is extrnmely important. "We are the remnants of the Big Bang," he said.

Students protest CIA at Fall Career Expo 
By JOHN-PAUL WITT News Writer 
Six members of the Notre Dame Peace Fellowship, in partnership with the Progressive Student Alliance and Human Rights ND, dis­tributed flyers outside the Fall Career Expo Wednesday at the Joyce Center protesting the pres­ence of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Raytheon, a defense and aerospace systems sup­plier. 
The protestors entered the Joyce Center to distribute flyers, but were immediately escorted out by Notre Dame Security Police (NDSP) officers and physically barred from re-entry by police. The protest dispersed as the career fair ended at 8 p.m. 
Representatives from the CIA and Raytheon were not authorized to speak with the media, and NDSP officers on the scene had no com­ment. 
When reached at home Wednesday evening, Notre Dame Security/Police Director Phil Johnson said he was not willing to comment without "complete infor­mation on the situation." 
Event coordinator Alicia Quiros, a Notre Dame junior, said the group had been informed that they would be permitted by the Student Activities Office and Student Affairs to pass out fliers inside the JACC after "three meetings" with Notre Dame officials. She said there was a contradiction between what the groups were told in writing from Student Affairs, and what later hap­pened. 
"We did not have banners, we were not yelling, we were simply passing out flyers to educate mem­bers of the Notre Dame community, and if the University will not permit this, it's gone down a road that's dangerous," Angulo said. 
Peace Fellowship member Michael Angulo said he opposed Notre Oame allowing the two organ­izations to solicit applicants at Notre Dame. 
"The CIA eontinues to torture detainees, 60 years after the pas­sage of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the U.N.," Angulo said, ''I'm against AI-Qacda, but I'm also against the CIA kidnapping peo­ple. People recruit at Notre Dame because Notre Dame students are engaged and intelligent -these organizations want to take these qualities and corrupt them." 
Raytheon's career fair handouts describe the company as a "technol­ogy leader specializing in defense, homeland security and other gov­ernment markets." 
But Angulo protested Raytheon's role in perpetuating the use of weapons. 
"They manufacture things that kill people, and we're against things that kill people, especially civilians," Angulo said, "Cluster bombs ­mines released through the air ­are still exploding in Lebanon today, maiming and killing people."

Town turns to tourism after 9/11 
SHANKSVILLE, Pa. -Searching for an eco­nomic boost and home to perhaps the most compelling story of 9/11, rural Somerset County is trying to pull off a balancing act: Remembering the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in a way that encourages development and job growth without devolving into tackiness and disrespect. 
Three years before the anticipated opening of a memorial that the National Park Service expects will bring in 250,000 visitors a year, officials say they are working to make this area of western Pennsylvania more hospitable to tourists. 
By necessity, they say, this would bring more inns, restaurants and other new businesses and jobs to a region where the traditional industries -steel, coal-mining, manufacturing and farm­ing-have declined over the decades.

Officials urge 1 million to evacuate 
Storm threatens nation's largest concentration of refineries, chemical plants 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON -The frail and elderly were put aboard buses Wednesday and authorities warned 1 million others to flee inland as Hurricane Ike steamed toward a swath of the Texas coast that includes the nation's largest concen­tration of refineries and chemical plants. 
Drawing energy l'rom the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the strengthening storm was expected to blow ashore early Saturday somewhere between Corpus Christi and Houston, with some forecasts saying it could become a fearsome Category 4, with winds of at least 131 mph. . 
Such a storm could cause a storm surge of 18 feet in Matagorda Bay and four to eight feet in Galveston Bay, emergency officials warned. The surge in Galveston Bay could push floodwaters into Houston, damaging areas that includfl the nation's biggest refinery and NASA's Johnson Space Center. 
Four counties south and east of Houston announced mandatory or voluntary evacuations, and authori­ties began moving weak and chronically ill patients by bus to San Antonio, about 190 miles from Houston. A mandatory evacuation was also ordered for the west end of Galveston Island. No imme­diate evacuations were ordered in Harris County, which includes Houston. 
Johnny Greer, a 54-year­old retired plant operator at Dow Chemical Corp., boarded up his house a mile from the Gulf of Mexico in Brazoria County and planned to hit the road. 
"Gas and stuff is high. But you can't look at all that," he said. "I think my life is more valuable than high gas prices." 
About 1 million people live in the coastal counties between Corpus Christi and Galveston. An additional 4 million live in the Houston area, to the north. 
The oil and gas industry 

watched the storm closely, fearing damage to the very heart of its operations. 
Texas is home to 26 refineries that account for one-fourth of U.S. refining capacity, and most are clus­tered along the Gulf Coast in such places as Houston, Port Arthur and Corpus Christi. Exxon Mobil Corp.'s plant in Baytown, outside Houston, is the nation's largest refinery. Dow Chemical has a huge opera­tion just north of Corpus Christi. 
Refineries are built to withstand high winds, but flooding can disrupt opera­tions and -as happened in Louisiana after Hurricane Gustav -power outages can shut down equipment for days or weeks. An 
extended shutdown could lead to higher gasoline prices. 
As always, some hard­ened old-timers decided to ride it out. Fourth-genera­tion fisherman James Driggers, 47, planned to spend the storm aboard his 80-foot boat docked in Freeport. 
"We like to stay close to our paycheck," he said. 
At 8 p.m. EDT, Ike was a Category 2 storm with winds near 100 mph. It was about 700 miles east of Brownsville, Texas, and was moving northwest at 8 mph, after ravaging homes in Cuba and killing at least 80 people in the Caribbean. 
No matter where Ike hits, its effects are likely to be felt for hundreds of miles, said Mark Sloan, emer­gency management coordi­nator for Harris County, which includes Houston. 
"It's a very large storm," Sloan said. "The bands will be over 200 miles out from the center of storm, so we have to be aware of its size as it grows over the next 24 to 48 hours and what 
impacts  it  will  have on  
Friday,  Saturday  and  
Sunday."  

Isaias Campos, 27, board­ed up the church he attends in Freeport. lie said he was grateful the church planned to evacuate much of the congregation to Houston by bus. 
"If it wasn't for the church, it would be difficult for many of our members to leave," Campos said.

Chavez deploys strategic bombers 
Associated Press 
CARACAS -Two Russian strategic bombers landed in Venezuela on Wednesday as part of military maneu­vers, President Hugo Chavez said. wel­coming the unprecedented deployment at a time of increasing tensions between Moscow and the U.S. 
The Venezuelan leader said the two Russian Tu-160 bombers will conduct maneuvers and that he hopes to "fly one of those things" himself. 
Russian military analysts said it was the first time Russian strategic bombers have landed in the Western Hemisphere since the Cold War. The provocative foray into Venezuela was certain to add to the strain in U.S.-Russian relations created over Russia's war in Georgia. 
Chavez called the deployment part of a move toward a "pluri-polar world" ­a reference to moving away from U.S. dominance. "The Yankee hegemony is finished," Chavez said in a televised speech. 
The Russian Defense Ministry said the bombers flew to Venezuela on a training mission and would conduct training flights over neutral waters in the next few days before returning to Russia, according to a statement carried by Russian news wires. 
Ministry spokesman Alexander Drobyshevsky refused to say how long the deployment would last or say whether the planes were carrying any weapons. Military officers in the past have said Russian strategic bombers do not carry live weapons on patrol flights. 
NATO fighters escorted the two Russian bombers on their 13-hour trip to Venezuela over the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, the Defense Ministry said.

attack in American history. 
Cavanaugh, Zahm, Keenan, Stanford, Breen-Phillips, Farley and Lewis are sponsoring the prayer service, which will start at 
9:45 p.m. and last between 30 and 45 minutes, junior Angela Rossi said. 
Rossi, one of the organizers of the service, said the event should symbolize "hope for the future." 
"I think it would be something people should be interested in coming to, because when it hap­pened, a lot of us were younger, and we might not necessarily have been able to process every­thing that was going on," Rossi said. "But now, seven years later, we have seen how it has affected us and how it has affected people physically, psychologically and emotionally, but that doesn't mean we can just give up and for­get about it. I think it's important to keep it close in our hearts." 
Though the event is sponsored by mostly North Quad dorms, Rossi said the entire campus is invited. Seven years ago, on the day of the attacks, a mass for the entire Notre Dame community was held on South Quad. 
Rossi said North Quad campus ministry commissioners wanted to start a new tradition to commem­orate Sept. 11. 
"It seems like there are smaller things every year, but maybe not necessarily something planned by the students to remember it, so we really wanted to get that start­ed," Rossi said. 
In addition to the prayer serv­ice, a special Mass for peace will be celebrated in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart at 5:15 p.m. today, Father Peter Rocca, the rector of the Basilica, said. 
On Saint Mary's campus, Campus Ministry will hold a prayer service in the Stapleton Lounge at 4:30p.m. 
Notre Dame Army ROTC has a run planned for Thursday morn­ing and after the run, Father Rocca will lead the HOTC cadet in prayer to commemorate the anniversary. 
Sept. 11 is also the second day the Army ROTC is hosting a blood drive, along with the American Red Cross, in the Grand Ballroom of LaFortune Student Center, Captain Joseph Kosek of the Notre Dame Army HOTC program said. 
"In a way, you ean kind of say it something we are doing for Sept. 11 ... " he said. "It will all go to the Red Cross blood bank. So obvious­ly the intent is to help out anybody who needs blood, so doing some­thing good for the local communi­ty here." 
In years past, the Notre Dame Tri-Military Command has held a ceremony on Sept. 11, designated as Patriot's Day, but this year they will not hold a similar event. 
"Patriot's Day is not necessarily a military event and probably shouldn't be perceived as such," said Capt. Dale Nees, the com­manding officer of the Notre Dame Navy ROTC unit and a pro­fessor of Naval Science. "About 98 percent of the people that lost their lives that day had nothing to do with the military. We didn't want it to take on the context of it being a militaristic celebration or memorial-it was more than just that."

IN BRIEF 

NFL Players marketing files lawsuit 
MINNEAPOLIS -The for-profit market­ing arm of the NFL Players Association has filed a lawsuit in federal court in Miami against CBS Interactive over the use of player statistics in fantasy football games. 
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday, comes the week after CBS Interactive sued the NFL Players Association in federal court in Minneapolis. That suit seeks to clarify who controls the statistics that underlie its fan­tasy football games. 
NFL PLAYERS, which handles all licens~ ing and sponsorships for the players, con­tends CBS Interactive filed the lawsuit in the wrong jurisdiction. It also argues that the filing in Minneapolis names the wrong defendant -the NFL Players Association rather than NFL PLAYERS. 

Database publicizes vehicle accidents 
WASHINGTON -The government unveiled a new public database Wednesday that will enable consumers to look up the number of alleged deaths, injuries and cases of property damage involving pas­senger vehicles. 
Consumer groups have sought the infor­mation, which was part of legislation passed by Congress after the massive recall of Firestone tires in 2000. 
The law required manufacturers to pro­vide data on numerous safety complaints and was devised to help the government quickly detect potential problems. 
The so-called "early warning" data was released because of a ruling by a federal appeals court in July that barred the gov­ernment from withholding key data report­ed by manufacturers. 
Some data was allowed to remain confi­dential, including warranty claims and field reports submitted by the manufactur­er. 
The data, which goes back to 2003, is reported to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration by automakers, tire makers, motorcycle companies and child seat manufacturers on a quarterly basis. The public database now provides infor­mation from 21 automakers.

LANCASTER, Calif. -A teenager was arrested for inves­tigation of four counts of murder Wednesday in the killings of a woman and three girls whose bodies were found in a burning house, authorities said. 
Bail for Corey King was set at $1 million, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Aura Sierra said. 
Authorities had called King, 1H. of Altadena, an associate or friend of the victims when he was brought in for questioning Tuesday. A telephone listing for King could not be immediately located. 
Los Angeles County firelight­nrs on Tuesday found the victims in dill'erent rooms of the burning house in Lancaster. a Mojave Dnsert dty of about 145,000 rns­idnnts about a 70-mile drive north of' I .os Angeles. 
Coronnr's officials on Wmlnesday identified the dead woman as Sonya Evctte Durlield, 43, of Lancaster. The identities of the other three vic­tims were not immediately con­firmed because the bodies were badly burned, said Ed Winter, assistant chief of the coroner's office. 
The victims had "trauma to the body" not associated with the fire, Winter said. He did not elaborate. 
Gregory Kealikea Stewart identified himself as the estranged husband of the slain woman and said the young vic­tims were his three daughters, ages 8, 12 and 14. 
Stewart said he was in a "world of disarray." He received a cell phone call while standing in front of reporters outside the fire scene Tuesday and said, "Oh Lord, it's my wife." 
Sheriff's Lt. Patrick Nelson said Wednesday that King was a "dose friend" of the woman's 19-year-old son, who currently lives out of state. King appeared to have been a frequent visitor to the woman's home, Nelson said.

Let me first make myself clear: I honor John McCain's service to this country as a· man in uniform during the Vietnam War. Furthermore, I applaud his courage in standing strong as an American P.O.W. 
for just over five years. 
Now, let me talk about how absurd it is that this line is necessary before anyone, anywhere criticizes John McCain or his poli­

cies. Because this Jason Coleman point of character is unassailable, McCain has taken Man at Large to using it as a defense for all sorts of missteps and mistakes that tend to be unrelated to his armed service experi­ence at all. The constant use of this plea to patriotism diminishes not only his sacrifices, but also the sacrifices all vet­erans have made for their country. 
We'll start with the gaffe-related inci­dences and move on to those that gener­ate much more cause for concern. In an interview, McCain was asked how many houses he owned. After a bit of thought, he realized he was not sure and told the show to get that information from his staff. While embarrassing and perhaps a little efl'ete, this was a slipup that could probably be overcome. 
To me, what was embarrassing was the following week when McCain was featured on the Tonight Show. Jay Leno and John McCain were doing the usual late night spiel, joking around about the campaign and the headlines. Everything was fine until Leno asked McCain about the house gaffe. 
"For one million dollars, how many houses do you have?" 
EDITORIAL CARTOON

oman forhrS \LP. runnrng
mate... 

He replied: "Could I just mention to you Jay ... I spent five and a half years in a prison cell, I didn't have a house, I didn't have a kitchen table ... " 
Again, I honor his service, but to bring his service up in this context is a dis­credit and an affront to the thousands of other Vietnam P.O.W.s who may or may not even own one house, much less five, the number McCain later estimated for himself. The question had nothing to do with his record, nor was it an attack or insult to it. Hather, it was a late night comedian joking about an interview misstep with a politician known for his ability to kid with the press. 
While this seems to be much ado about nothing, this actually brings me to my point: the larger, more pertinent paradox that John McCain seems to bring to the table with his veteran policy decisions. On the one hand, he implies that he rightly deserves what he has in reward for his time in uniform. But, on the other hand, he consistently votes against legislation that would enable other veterans to achieve similar suc­cess in reward for their service. 
· Earlier this summer, a new G.I. bill was put to vote that, if put into efl'ect, would give aid in full to veterans to attend any public four-year college after three years of service. The bill was fair­ly popular and passed with a veto-proof (Bush had threatened to veto it) majori­ty easily. The sponsors of the bill in the senate, however, met some resistance. John McCain and a group of nine other senators were pressing against the bill, in part because they thought it was too expensive. Granted, $4 billion per year is a lot of money. But this amount seems trite in contrast with the $10 billion per day spent in Iraq that was authorized by these very senators. 
One could give McCain the benefit of the doubt, assuming this is a rare case

for him: voting against veterans. Unfortunately it is not. In fact, Disabled Americans for America found that McCain has voted against veteran fund­ing 70 percent of the time. 70 percent. That means 7 out of 10 times he was saying that veterans should not have the opportunity to go to college until they served for 12 years, or shouldn't have a full and immediate mental and physical evaluation on returning home. 
Of course, it is unfair to make a claim on every bill that he voted on over the past two decades. Given the system of committee review, where the VA sub committee reviews each GI bill, it is accurate to say, however, that each bill was beneficial in some way to veterans. We also have to take into consideration that to increase spending so many times would be irresponsible, but it is also probably inaccurate that 70 percent of the bills introduced were too expensive to be enacted in good conscience, espe­cially if such extravagant spending on the war was so easily justified. 
The heart of the issue lies in the ease with which McCain will play the P.O.W. card at any criticism leveled against him in light of his dismal record on veteran funding bills. While 1 do not doubt in the least that John McCain understands and appreciates the sacrifice of our men in the armed services, I also don't under­stand how he can so easily use his own experience as a defense against almost any criticism without working to improve the benefits for others who have shared with him in those sacri­fices.

Lessons from an atheist: Deep into the life of Christ 
A few years ago at a Marriage Prep retreat at Notre Dame for young alum­ni, I was responsible for meeting with all the inter-faith couples. I knew well that these relationships, however lov­ing, often present­ed unique chal-Fr. Lou Delfra lenges for the cou­ple. But even I was caught a little off-Faithpoint guard when, before the retreat, the Director of the Marriage Retreats approached me and said, "This woman from Notre Dame is a practicing Catholic. And the man she is marrying is an atheist." Courageously, I tried to get out of it, arguing that having no faith can't possibly count as an inter­faith couple! But they didn't buy it. 
So, with a bit of apprehension, I decided to take a walk with this young man -break the ice in a casual way, try to figure out what he thinks about things that matter deeply to his bride­to-be, like Christianity. So, we're walk­ing around St. Mary's Lake, and to my surprise, we quickly hit it off. This guy was great, one head, no weapons. Even more, our conversation revealed him as a great lover of humanity. He believed in respecting every human being, tried to treat others fairly and was profound­ly ethical. So finally, about a half-hour into the conversation, I asked him, "So, what do you think about Jesus?" 
And without missing a beat, he shoots back an amazing reply, which was more or less: "I think Jesus was a profound teacher. He gave the world an incredi­ble system of morals. And the thing I respect about him the most is that he lived by what he taught -even when it cost him his life. For me, he's one of the great moral examples we have of what it means to live life with total integrity and to be fully human." · 
And as he's answering, I'm thinking, "Darn, that's pretty good!" And then I got nervous. I felt sure he was going to ask me, "So what do you think about Jesus?" And in the moment, I wasn't sure I could come up with anything more! 
Now, fortunately, he didn't ask, but the question lurked in the back of my mind for the rest of our walk. When I went to bed that night, I was still think­ing about our conversation, and the question really started to hit home: "What more do I have to say about who Jesus is?" Call it a matter of pride, but I really want to be able to say more about Jesus than an atheist can! 
Looking back, the encounter reminds me of a similar exchange between Jesus and his disciples. Jesus asks his disci­ples what people are saying about him. They respond with some pretty flatter­ing descriptions: Some think he's John the Baptist back from the dead, others that he's Elijah or one of the great prophets. And these are not hugely bad guesses. 
So perhaps, like me, the disciples squirmed when Jesus paused, looked at them and asked them the very same question that I was faced with after my 
LETIERS TO THE EDITOR 
Notre Dame presence essential in CIA, Raytheon 
In a recent Viewpoint article ("Career fair participants unwelcome," Sept. 10), you were criticized for welcoming the CIA and the Raytheon Company onto campus. The four co-authors laid forth impressive statis­tics and numbers on both the Central Intelligence Agency and Raytheon Company, which I will not dispute. The CIA and its domestic counterpart, the FBI, have both used tactics that range from questionable at best and at worst violations of human rights. 
Mr. Angulo, Ms. Haas, Ms. Quiros and Ms. McKinney said that "students [ ... ] are presented with a contradictory picture at the Career Expo." On the one hand, we, the University community, are called to "develop a 'dis­ciplined sensibility to the poverty, injustice and oppression that burden the lives of so many."' On the other hand, the University Administration and the Career Center welcome to campus organizations that will, by their very nature, cause pain and suffering to people in the world, on the basic level of human rights. 
It is for this reason that the CIA and Raytheon must be allowed and indeed encouraged to recruit students from the Notre Dame community. Students that have lived the Notre Dame experience will have lived at a place where "learning becomes service to justice". The University has done well in training moral and upstanding men and women for decades and these are exactly the kind of men and women we want in the CIA and Raytheon. 
I believe we can all agree that sending people with consciences and strong moral compasses (like those from Our Lady's University) will fit well in any role where a strong moral compass is needed. Whether it be signing a torture order for a prisoner to extract information, selling small arms to private contractors or making the cut-throat deal in the board room, I would much rather have people from our community that will stop and-think twice in those roles. I want people that have grown and learned with the mission of Notre Dame clear in their minds to be the ones that stand up in the briefing rooms or the board rooms and protest what the organization is doing or how it is conducting business. 
So keep inviting the CIA and Raytheon back. Send our fellow students to work from the inside and change these organizations. Keep listening to the critics and the protesters of your policies. But don't send these com­panies to recruit at other, less mindful campuses. 
Hope for a more peaceful future, with Our Lady guiding the way.

walk with the atheist: "But you, who do you say that I am?" 
Peter, when confronted with the ques­tion, is given the grace to blurt out, "You are the Christ, the Son of God!" But such a gift of immediate recognition is not always at hand. More often, I have to wrestle with my belief. And as I wrestle with the question, "Who do you say that I am?" I find myself reflecting on other stories from the Gospels, con­nected to particularly significant moments in my life, gracing me with a deeper, more intimate understanding of Jesus. 
"Who do I say that Jesus is?" I am led, for example, to the scene of the healing of the paralyzed man: "Your sins are forgiven. Take up your mat and walk." I start to form an answer: "Jesus is my healer -He is the one who forgives my sins and heals my soul, my hurts and tells me to walk where he leads." 
I am led to the encounter on the road to Emmaus -and I think, "Jesus is the one who has walked beside me my entire life -and sometimes I hardly knew it -but then, suddenly, I knew nothing more certainly than Him." 
I think especially of my favorite pas­sage: the beautiful encounter between Jesus and Mary Magdalene at the tomb on Easter morning. She doesn't recog­nize him, but when he says her name ­"Mary" -she suddenly knows it is him and tries to throw her arms around the one she loves. And I think, "Jesus is the one who knows me most intimately, my whole being, and calls me by name to a deeper friendship with Him." 
Who do we say that Jesus is? When Jesus invites us to know him more deeply than before -as I believe he invited me, through this encounter with this atheist-how do we respond? When we are led past our everyday, comfortable images of Jesus, to ones of deeper, more intimate friendship with him, who do we discover? I believe, in the end, through the gift of our faith, that we are all being led to Peter's graced insight-"You are the Christ!" 
But sometimes, to deepen our faith, it takes time. It takes challenges-a sick­ness, the death of a loved one, tragedies like 9/11 that we remember today, moments of unbelief. And we're sud­denly confronted with the question: "You, who do you say that I am?" 
When these challenges unfold in our own lives, stir up our hearts, make us restless and invite us to come to know Jesus more deeply, let us pray for the grace to really wrestle with the ques­tion: "Who do you say that I am?" 
So that in the end, we might be led, little by little, challenge by challenge, to Peter's revelation -"You are the Christ!"-the very fulfillment of our lives.

Obam.a's health care plan can decrease abortion rate 
In response to Gregory Barr's article searching for any "proportionate reasons" to vote for Obama ("Dude, where's my pro­portionality?" Sept. 9), I write today to offer one reason. My argument is that an Obama presidency would likely lower the number of abortions in the United States despite his pro-choice stance due to his heath care plan. 
To make my case, I'd like to look at ­Western Europe and Latin America. Western Europe has the lowest number of abortions for any region in the world (11 per 1000 pregnancies) while Latin America has among the highest (37 per 1000). The oddity lies in the fact that abortions in Latin America are almost completely illegal while abortions in Western Europe are legal. 
I am not trying to make the point that anti-abortion laws promote abortion. There is no conclusive evidence that I am aware of that suggests there is a direct correlation between abortion laws and the prevalence of abortions. Instead, I am trying to make the point that abortion is an extremely com­plicated issue that cannot be solved merely by making it illegal. While no one knows for sure why Europe's abortion rates are so low, a popular and, in my mind, convincing argument is that abortion rates are low due to their high quality of life -specifically, the quality of health care and education. 
Without going into a prolonged debate, his health care plan provides many potential solutions to the problems our health care system faces. Currently, about 46 million Americans are uninsured. If our healthcare system improves under his presidency like I assume it would, abortion rates would arguably decrease despite his pro-choice stance. If the problems in our health care system are not rectified, it seems clear to me that abortions would likely increase over the next decade. To me, this is a more-than­proportionate reason to vote for Obama.

Will Sheff had an idea for a dou­
ble album, but decided against it, 
thinking it would be "super preten­

ious." Maybe Sheff just didn't 
ant the inevitable, lazy compar­
to Exile that come with every 
album because pretentious­
ness doesn't seem to be a problem 
for the Okkervil River frontman, 
who once wrote an article to Mick 
Jagger telling the king of rock and 
roll, "for God's sake, give it up." 
There certainly are more people 
than Sheff who believe that the 
androgynous, British leader of the 
Stones has started it back up too 
many times, but it's an odd decla­
ration coming from the lyricist 
who most recently declared that he 
was in a "mid-level band." 
Sheff & Co. continues what they started with 2007's lauded "The Stage Names" with their most recent release entitled "The Stand Ins." The record is meant to be related to its predecessor and the covers match up to form the full picture. Yet, the titles are some­hat deceptive. "The Stand Ins" is t simply a b-side to "The Stage ames," rather it explores similar themes, this time from the per­pective of the not so successful artist. The irony here is not sur­prising considering Sheff's hyper iterate lyrics, which have led to comparisons with Portland's "The Decemberists." This linkage com­pletely forgets that Sheff isn't fak­ing a British accent and a more apt analogy may be to fellow

"The Stand Ins" is the fifth studio effort by Okkervil River, and is largely an album about an up and coming rock band trying to avoid categorization. This doesn't seem to be a problem for Okkervil River: the second song of the album, "Lost Coastlines" roughly sounds like an up-tempo mixture of alt­country and indie-pop. The tune features a duet between Sheff and now defunct member of OR, Jonathan Meiburg, who is now officially devoted to his fellow Austin band, Shearwater. With this single, Sheff

In the bombastic "Singer Songwriter," Sheff calls out all hipsters, singing, "You've got taste. What a waste that that's all you have." 
The highlights of "The Stand Ins" are the fifth and seventh songs, "Blue Tulip" and "Pop Lie" respec­tively, which are separated -by a short, 31-second instrumental clip. "Blue Tulip" is a six and a hal minute guitar driven epic, which echoes early Zeppelin and is fol­lowed by the explosive "Pop Lie,"

Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO -Denver Broncos quarterback Jay Cutler was on a conference call with San Diego reporters Wednesday when the subject veered from the injured Shawne Merriman to one of his backups, Jyles Tucker. 
"Who?" Cutler said. 
Jyles Tucker, it was repeated. "Nothing," Cutler replied. It turns out Cutler does 
know a little bit about Tucker, who's played in only seven regular-season games for the San Diego Chargers in his two-year NFL career. Tucker will be asked to help fill the chasm left when Merriman told the Chargers on Tuesday that he will have surgery on two torn ligaments in his left knee. 
"Didn't he just sign a new deal?" Cutler said about Tucker, who indeed was given a five-year contract extension late last month ­despite his limited experi­ence -as uncertainty sur­rounded Merriman's situa­tion. 
"He's going to come out and want to f:tll the role that Merriman had. I don't know if he's going be able to play at that high level right away, but he's definitely going to make some plays for them." 
Tucker didn't seem to care that Cutler doesn't know who he is. Perhaps the two will meet up 
Sunday, when the two-time defending AFC West cham­pion Chargers play their first division game, at Denver. 
"That's cool," Tucker said. "As long as we win the game, that's all that mat· ters.' It's not about me, it's about winning the game and getting to the champi­onship. That's all that mat· ters." 
The Chargers were upset 26-24 by the Carolina Panthers on Sunday, then found out two days later that they'll be without Merriman for the rest of the season. Merriman was placed on injured reserve on Wednesday. The team said it didn't know when he'll have surgery. 
Merriman had an NFL­high 39 1/2 sacks in the past three seasons and played in three straight Pro Bowls. 
Nicknamed "Lights Out" because of his punishing hits, the normally media· friendly Merriman remained mum for the sec­ond straight day. He didn't return e-mails seeking com· ment, and a team spokesman said he wasn't at Chargers Park. 
An associate of Merriman's said the line­backer probably wouldn't talk until doing a radio show on Wednesday night. It's believed that Merriman is paid for doing the show. 
Late in training camp, Merriman said that the pos­

Ohio State rtlill1ing back Wells 
back in practice this week 
COLUMBUS -Ohio State tailback Chris "Beanie" Wells worked out with the team in pads and is on targ-et to play against No. 1 Southern California on Saturday night. 
Jim Bollman, one of the Buckeyes' two offensive coordina­tors, said he was encouraged by Wells' play. 
"I would say he was 75 percent, something like that. He got a lot of work today, certainly more than he's had," Bollman said. "We'll see how sore he is tomorrow, then go from there." 
Darrell Hazell, also an offensive coordinator, said Wells had a good practice Wednesday and did not limp off. 
"We won't know until game time on Saturday night," Hazell said when asked whether Wells would be fully recovered. "If I know him 
he'll be out there ready to go."Cowboys' OB Romo banged 
up after Cleveland game 
IRVING, Texas-The bandage was off, the stitches hardly visible nnder the stubble around Tony Romo's chin. 
Asked about it, Romo mumbled, "Just stitches. It'll be all right. They can be exposed." 
When the injury came up again min· utes later, Homo was just as dismissive, saying only, "It's fine, I'll be good." 
Romo doesn't like talking about injuries or even acknowledging them. He's also not into all the praise he's got· ten from teammates and coaches for the way he handled his pair of injuries in the opener Snnday at Cleveland. 
The biggie was getting sandwiched by a pair of 300-pounders. He winced while on the ground, then stood up to fmd blood coming out of his chinstrap. He'd later need 13 stitches to close the wound, but on the very next snap he threw a 19-yard completion. He led the Cowboys to a touchdown on that drive, too, before trainers got a chance to 2._atch him up.Patriots' QB Cassel says

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -The day after Matt Cassel dropped a fly ball in a high school game, his teammates thought they'd tease him.

that," said Tom Meusborn, the coach of that Los Angeles area team. "He was going to track the guy down and probably body slam him. He had fun with it." 
Cassel can take a joke. But he hates making mistakes, whether it's on the baseball or football field. 
On Sunday, the Patriots' new quar· terback will shake off what remains of seven years of cobwebs and deal with any butterflies in his first start since high school -against the

Saints' Colston to be out four to six vveeks 
Associated Press 

NEW ORLEANS -Marques Colston, the New Orleans Saints' top receiver during the past two seasons, had surgery on his left thumb and will miss four to six weeks. 
Colston said he had a torn lig­ament resulting from a play Sunday when he reached for­ward to make a catch while taking a helmet-first hit to his hands from Ronde Barber. 
"I don't know if my thumb just got caught in an awkward position. It just bent all the way backward," said Colston, who was wearing a cast over his left hand. "I guess the only silver lining is that I'm going to have a chance to come back and play a good portion of the season and hopefully be back in time for that playoff push." 
Colston tried to continue play­ing with the injury during the Saints' 24-20 victory over Tampa Bay, but finished with only three catches for 26 yards. He made one catch after the injury. 
Colston was a seventh-round draft choice out of Hofstra in 2006. At 6-foot-5, 225 pounds, he provides quarterback Drew Brees a big target and emerged as one of Brees' favorite receivers during his rookie year. Colston went on to com­pile 2,241 yards receiving for 19 touchdowns in his first two seasons. 
His 168 catches are more than any NFL receiver has had through only two seasons. During the summer, Colston agreed to a three-year contract extension that could keep him in New Orleans through the 2011 season. 
"It's tough, especially when you lose a guy as productive as him," Brees said after Wednesday's practice. "But there's always an opportunity for a younger guy to step up or guys that might not get as much playing time ordinarily to step up and contribute even more. 
''I'm confident with all our guys. However we piece it together, whoever is on the field knows what to do and they know they'll get their opportu­nities."

Colts' DT under arrest for drug possession 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS Indianapolis Colts starting defensive tackle Ed Johnson was arrested early Wednesday on a drug possession charge. 
Colts president Bill Polian said the team was still gathering facts about the case before determining how it will disci­pline Johnson, but Johnson will not play Sunday at Minnesota. 
"He will not play this week, for sure," coach Tony Dungy said. 
Polian said Johnson was stopped for speeding between midnight and 1 a.m. on Interstate 465 just north of Indianapolis. Police also charged him with marijuana possession. 
He later was released on bond from the Hamilton County Jail. 
Johnson was temporarily expelled from Penn State in 2005 for violating the school policy on sexual misconduct and confining another student against the student's will. He was reinstated in 2006, but later suspended for the Outback Bowl for violating team rules. 
Once considered a first-day draft prospect, the big defensive tackle went undrafted in 2007 draft. 
"We had a talk with him and I thought he was going in the right direction," Dungy said last summer when Johnson was try­ing to make the team. "He has to understand the environment he's coming into and what we expect from him." 
Johnson's past indiscretions could also have an impact on whether the league takes action. 
"As in any other incident of this nature, it will be reviewed under the league's substance abuse policy," league spokesman Greg Aiello wrote in an e-mail to The Associated Press. "A player's prior history can be considered in evaluating potential discipline under the program." 
The 6-foot-2, 296-pound Johnson was the biggest sur­prise in training earn p last year. lie took advantage of an injury­depleted defensive line to start all 16 games, finishing with 63 tackles, one sack and one forced fumble. 
The Colts (0-1) had even big­ger expectations for Johnson this year, but Wednesday's arrest has the Colts reassessing those plans. 
Johnson was not in the locker room Wednesday to answer questions. 
The arrest couldn't have come at a worse time for the Colts. They allowed Chicago to run for 183 yards and average 4.7 yards per carry in a season­opening 29-1:~ loss and now face back-to-hack games against two of the NFL's best running tandems: Minnesota's Adrian Peterson and Chester Taylor, and Jacksonville's Fred Taylor and Mauriee Jones-Drew. 
One option for Dungy is mov­ing 274-pound defensive end Raheem Brock inside, where he was the starter last season. Second-year player Keyunta Dawson is the other starter. They also could use their most experienced tackle, Darrell Reid, in the lineup.

Titans rallying around Young after incident 
Associated Press 
NASIIVILLE -·If Vince 

Young isn't sun~ lw wants to 
play football anymore, he did­
n't show it Wedrwsday. 
lin reported to work, 

watched part of practice with 
a wrap around his sprained 
lnf't knnn and avoided 
reporters wanting to talk 
about his rnotlwr's cornn11mts 
indi!:ating lw doesn't want to 
play beeausn of the negativity 
he's faced since bPing booed 
heavily during a 17-10 win 
over Jacksonville. 
llis coa!"h and teammates 

are sticking with tlwir quar­
terback and tlw official story 
that whatever happerwd that 
promptPCI !:oach .lefT Fisher to 
alert police to help locate 
Young and check on his mno­
tional wnll-lwing was just a 
misundnrstanding. And that it 
was blown out of proportion 
by tiH~ nwdia. 
And no, Young donsn't have 

to prove his !:ommitmnnt to 
nitiH'r Fishnr or his team­
mates. 
"lin IPd us to the playoffs 

last year. WP just want him to 
get lwalthy and back on the 
f'iPid," Fisher said. 
Young stood with linnbacknr 

Keith Bullu!"k and former col­
lege tearnrnatP Michael 
Criff'in for part of' practice. 
Bulluck said lw knows Young 
is f'inn al'tnr speaking with 
him. Tho lwst way they can 
hnlp tho quartPrback? Go 
boat Cincinnati on Sunday. 
Bulluck said ho's seen 

Donovan McNabb and Steve 
McNair get down after losses, 
something that goes with the 
pressures of' being the quar­
tnrback. lie expressed his 
confidence that Young will 
takn the good and the bad of 
his position. 
"That's just things quarter­backs go through. They prob­ably wear red shirts l'or a reason. They're a little more sensitive than any position on the l'ield," Bulluck joked before becoming serious. " ... Being his third year I'm sure he has a lot on his plate like we all do. I know he'll rnbound, and we'll be all right. That's why I'm saying that the situation will takn caro of itself'." 
Center Kevin Mawae called 
Young still a leader whose 
teammates trust and believe 
in him. 
"Anything that happens out­side the locker room will be outside the realm of football, that's something that's betwe!m him and his family and whoever's handling that with him," Mawan said. 
The quarterback didn't talk to reportnrs, but Fisher did promise Young will speak "at some point." 
Young is the only person who knows what he was thinking Monday whon he s k i p p e d an MIU exam to determine tlw extent of his sprairwd nwdial collateral lig­ament. Fisher and a psychol­ogist met with the quarter­back at his horne. then he took ofT in his M1\rcedes to eat ehiekon wings and watch football. 
But whatever he said at honw prompted someone to call Fisher, who said Tuesday night the information he had didn't allow him the luxury of' 
waiting. On Wednesday, 
Fisher only called it a misun­
derstanding, but defended 
what the team did as concern 
for an employee. 
For now, voteran Kerry 
Collins will start. The Titans 
signed Chris Simms as insur­
anen Wodnosday and will not 
project when Young will be 
healthy enough to play. 
Fisher said the starter's job 
remains Young, but admitted 
the quarterback has some 
work to do. · 
"lie has to put some things 
back in perspective, and first 
and foremost has to get 
healthy," Fisher said. 
Young was booed in 2004 
while in college when Texas 
was shut out by Oklahoma. 
and he was benched for the 
second half of a win over 
Missouri the next week. He 
responded by never losing 
another game. 
"Anybody that knows Vince 
knows how competitive he 
is," Texas eoaeh Maek Brown 
said. "lie has a very high 
standard for himself. When 
he doesn't feel like he 
readwd that standard at that 
moment, he does get disap­
pointed. 
"But ho's f"ine. lie's moving forward. ll!~·s been booed bnf'ore. lin's been eriticized before. llis worst moment h o n~ w as h i s bcs t m o m e n t bneause al'ter he played so poorly against Missouri he never lost another game." 
Young's fellow quarterbacks are offering up suggestions on dnaling with the unique pressure of playing in this league. 
Collins, the fifth overall pick in the 1995 draft, said he did­n't learn how to handle all the attention until he wound up with his third team, the New York Giants in his fifth season. lie said he'll be happy to be a resource for Young, but hasn't shared his own story yet. 
"I was a young guy who played a lot, had success early and did some things that looking back probably wercn 't the right things to do. I learned from it. I think that's the most important thing, as it is in lif"e. You make mistakes, you learn from it and move on," Collins said. 
Bengals receiver Chad Johnson said football is fun, while pressure is being sent to fight in fraq. Cincinnati quarterback Carson Palmer, who had to heal up from his own knee injury, doesn't know Young well. But he believes the key is not to worry about what anyone outside the team says. 
"If you're a guy who is always worried about what people are saying about yoli, it's going to be tough, it's going to cat at you and get at you. But you need to experi­nnce it and figure it out and learn to roll with it," Palmer said. 
Aaron Hodgers has dealt with his share of criticism in Green Bay and suggests keep­ing priorities straight. 
"If" you live your life and you decide your joy and happiness in lif"e (is based) on what peo­ple say about you or think about you, you're going to be up and down every day."

NFL 
49ers' QB Alex Smith to miss rest of season 
Associated Press 
SANTA CLARA, Calif. -Alex Smith's season is over with another shoulder injury. The high-priced quarterback's short career with the San Francisco 49ers is probably finished as well. 
Th-e 49ers put Smith on injured reserve Wednesday with a broken bone in his right shoul­der. The top pick in the 2005 draft probably will require more surgery on the joint that limited him to seven games last season. 
Coach Mike Nolan improbably claimed to know little about the injury that ended his former franchise quarterback's fourth NFL campaign before Smith even played in a regular-season game this fall. Smith's team­mates expressed more concern than their gruff coach over his latest injury, which popped up during the club's final practice before last week's season open­er. 
"I feel sorry for him," said running back Frank Gore, the Niners' third-round pick in 
Smith's draft. "He was a great teammate and worked hard. I just hope the best for him, and hope he gets well." 
After paying Smith more than $31 million during his four years with the 49ers, the bleak realities of NFL salary cap life mean the club is likely to release him before next season. General manager Scot McCloughan said last week that San Francisco can't risk paying $9 million in base salary to a backup quarterback in 2009. 
Smith lost his starting job to journeyman J.T. O'Sullivan in training camp. 
''I'm not going to answer any hypothetical questions about the future," said Nolan, who had an embarrassing public spat with Smith last year over the severity of the quarterback's shoulder injury. "We'll cross that bridge when we get there. My focus right now is on (Sunday's game against) Seattle." 
Smith refused to comment after practice, and didn't respond to an additional request for comment Wednesday after­noon. --' 
Smith had surgery on his shoulder in December to repair three torn ligaments, the prod­uct of a separated shoulder from a game in late September 2007. He attempted to play through pain after the injury, but obviously struggled in all three games, culminating in an awful effort in a 24-0 loss at Seattle. 
"I thought he wasn't ready to go," said Seahawks linebacker Julian Peterson, Smith's former teammate in San Francisco.

to push through and make some noise in the Big East this year." 
So far, Sciacca said, so good for the Irish. 
"We've had a few up-and­down games," she said "But we're on the upswing now." 
As far as her own play goes, the management major has also been happy with herself this year. 
"So far, I've had one off game against Eastern Washington, where I didn't play as well as I wanted to," Sciacca said. "But overall, I've been pretty pleased with how things are going, personally." 
Sciacca currently is third on the team with 51 kills, and sec­ond with a .273 hitting per­centage. 
As far as Sciacca sees those numbers, though, there's only room for improvement.

Though Notre Dame surely looks the part of the favorite on paper for tonight's tilt, the Irish are taking nothing for grantPd as they begin their quest to n~peat as Big East Blue Division champions. 
"Anyone who's ever coached or played in the Big East knows there's no easy wins in our league,'' Clark said. "It's going to be very competitive. You've got to stick with your lgamel and hope it works your way." 
Notre Dame will continue its Big 1\ast slate when the Irish host St. John's Sept. 19.

.-Belles, who rallied from behind 14-12 in the final set and faced four match point situations. Olivet is struggling through a five-game losing strnak and has dropped six of seven overall. In addition. the Comets have not puslwd a single one of its last five matches beyond three sets. Hegardless, Schroeder-Biek said Saint Mary's is not over­looking the Comets. noting the intensity of their play and the strides the program has made. "Olivet has been known to really play with a lot of emotion against us," Schroeder-Biek said. "They tend to make for a competitive match. Their pro­gram has continued to improve over the last few years. The key factor for us is simply playing our game, together with the intensity to win." The match begins tonight at 6

we're excited for because we normally don't get to play them," he said. "Marquette always gives us a really tough game so that should be a battle." 
In the end. though, the Irish should end up contending with Connecticut and West Virginia for the Big East crown. West Virginia, which was the presea­son selection to win the American Division, defeated Notre Dame in the conference title game last year in a shootout. The Mountaineers are not on the Irish regular-season slate but Waldrum said his team might very well end up facing its pesky rivals. 
"There could be a great possi­bility that we see them in the [Big East] tournament," he said. "And I know our kids would love the opportunity to play them again because we didn't feel like we played as well as we should have in that game [last season]." 
So the Irish are still disappoint­ed about losing the conference title game in a shootout even though they went on to the College Cup semifinals as one of the top four teams in the nation last season. 
Add "extremely high expecta­tions" to the list of reasons for Notre Dame's unprecedented Big East success.

Sciacca off to strong start 
Sophomore team leader hopes to build on outstanding first season 
By SAM WERNER 
Spans Writer 
A year after turning in what can only be described as one of the best freshman seasons of any Notre Dame volleyball play­er, don't expect Kellie Sciacca to rest on her laurels. 
The sophomore middle block­er has spent the offseason working and concentrating on making herself even better. Specifically, Sciacca has been practicing her blocking . 
''I've been working on it a lot in the offseason," she said. "And I feel very strong about my blocking. 
"I want to be a more domi­nant blocker than I was last year. I did fairly well with blocking last year, but I want to do even better and feel more confident with blocking calls and my footwork." 

Last year, Sciacca made an immediate impact for the Irish and was named the AVCA Northeast Region Freshman of the Year. The Monument, Colo. native was first on the team with a .343 hitting percentage. 
"I want to have a fairly high hitting percentage," she said. "I led the team in hitting percent­age last year, so I want to try and do that again." 
Despite Sciacca's phenomenal year, the Irish struggled, going 15-13 and falling to Louisville in the Big East semifmals. 
"It was hard," Sciacca said. "If I'm being successful but the team isn't, it's not worth any­thing." 
But Sciacca -and the rest of the Irish -are putting last sea­son behind them and focusing on one goal this time around ­a Big East title. 
"We went through a little bit of a frustrating year last year," Sciacca said. "But as a team we told ourselves to forget about that and just move on with this season. 
"Louisville is great competi­tion, but we feel confident that we have the talent on our team
