Hundreds arrested in West Beirut 
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -The Lebanese army arrested hundreds of people in Moslem west Beirut Tues­day in its biggest show offorce since the 1975-76 civil war. 
Hidden arms also were con­fiscated in the former stronghold of the Palestine Liberation Organiza­tion and its leftist militia allies. The operation was part of a government crackdown on PLO remnants and leftist militia in the Moslem sector in an attempt to reassert control over the war-torn country. 
The state television said some of those arrested might be deported, and a Saudi Arabian magazine quoted President Amin Gemayel as saying Palestinians who entered Lebanon illegally must leave. 
Militarv officials refused to sav how many people were rounded up, but reporters saw trucks filled with people, some blindfolded, being driven away. Security sources said 450 people had been seized during the army sweeps. 
Soldiers closed streets in the central shopping district of west Beirut and checked documents of pedestrians and people in automobiles. They blocked street corners with armored personnel carriers as soldiers with bullhorns warned residents to cooperate. 
Palestinian refugees said the move was aimed at intimidating them and forcing them out of the country. Western diplomatic sources said those arrested included Palestinians -some whose papers were in order ­as well as Asians and other foreig­ners without residency permits or with permits that had expired. 
There are an estimated 300.500 to 500,000 Palestinians in Lebanon, following withdrawal of the main body of PLO fighters in August. 
Other sources said Lebanese with illegal weapons also were rounded up as part of the government's cam­
Orders rapid movement 
U·.S. re-enters arms talks with Soviet Union 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Under or­ders "to move as rapidly as the situa­tion permits," U.S. arms control negotiator Edward L. Rowny is entering a second round of talks with the Soviet Union convinced that Americans would abandon the nuclear freeze movement ifthey un­derstood the administration's treaty proposal. 
Freezing weapons at current levels, as Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev suggested last May, or on­ly trimming stockpiles of intercon­tinental ballistic missiles and long-range bombers would heighten the risk of nuclear war, Rowny said in an interview before flying to Geneva for the new round of talks 
beginning Wednesday. 
Rowny's reasoning: it takes the sort ofdeep reductions proposed by the United States to correct the 5-2 Soviet lead in missile power, or throw-weight. Trat edge, Rowny and other ll.S. negotiators said, heightens the risk of a first strike. 

According to this logic, the 
Soviets might be tempted to take ad­
vantage oftheir commanding lead in 
heavy ground missiles by launching 
an attack on U.S. silos. Conversely, the United States could be more in­clined to open fire before the Soviets act on their strength. 
Under orders from President Reagan "to move as rapidly as the situation permits"in the latest negotiations, Rowny will explain with "a lot more detail " the proposed treaty that he outlined during the first, six-week round of talks. The treaty's long-range goal is reducing U.S. and Soviet throw­weight to an equal ceiling. 
In the treaty's first phase, the num­ber of strategic warheads would be reduced by one third. Since the Soviets have put about 70 percent of their warheads on land-based missiles, Reagan's proposal would narrow that critical edge and, Rowny is convinced, reduce nuclear instability. 
"If a number of these people who join the freeze movement would recognize the administration has a proposal now -many of them don't 

.lOW it -I think they would abandon the movement and say, 'Don't waste time, don't go into a freeze, don't hobble yourself,"' Rowny said. 
Brezhnev, however, has dismissed the proffered treaty as "unrealistic" and designed to "insure American superiority." The chief Soviet negotiator, Viktor P. Karpov dis­missed the U.S. formula as a "one­sided" approach . 
Instead, Brezhnev has called for a 
freeze on the modernization and 
deployment ofstrategic weapons as 
a basis for negotiations. 

This tack coincides with a 
worldwide freeze movement, which 
has powerful support in congress 
and among state legislatures. Consis­
tently, polls show a heavy majority 

In California 

Strychninefound in Tylenol capsules 
CALIFORNIA (AP) -Strychnine in Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules purchased in an Oroville, Calif, drugstore caused a 25-year-old man to become ill last week, authorities revealed Tuesday. In Chicago, au­thorities said the incident 
"probably" was not connected to the seven cyanide deaths there. 
The latest twist in the baffling case prompted McNeil Consumer Products Co., which makes Tylenol, to urge retailers nationwide to withdraw all nationwide to withdraw all ofits capsules from sale -both Extra-Strength and Regular­Strength. The company had stopped producing capsules on Friday. 
The California man, who has since recovered, purchased the bottle at a Longs Drug Store in Oroville sometime before last Wednesday, when the poisonings occurred in the Chicago area, according to 
Lawrence (~. Foster, a spokesman for 
Johnson & Johnson, which owns McNeil. 
But the man, who has not been identified, did not take the con­taminated capsules until Thursday, the same day that the medical ex­aminer in Chicago announced find­ing a pattern ofcyanide deaths. 
"The FDA was notified 
immediately," Foster said. "The 
product was picked up within a 25­
mile radius by our peopl~." 

It was not immediately clear why 
news ofthe styrchnine was withheld 
from the public until five days after 
the man became sick. 

Strychine, a nervous system 
stimulant, was formerly used for 
medicinal purposes in very small 
quantities. In larger doses it causes 
convulsions and death, and it has 
long been used as a rat poi~on. 

At a news conference in Sacramento, California Health Director Bevedee :\h·ers called the discovery of the tainted bottles "cause for concern. not for panic.'" 
She said her department was sen­ding investigators to Oroville to col­lect all the Tylenol they could find. 
The strychnine victim in Oroville, about I 50 miles northeast of San Francisco, suffered convulsions and became ill Thursday after taking the Tylenol capsules. He was treated by a physician and returned to work Monday, according to Robert Knif­fen. a spokesman for McNeil. 
The Oroville man's physican reported to McNeil that he asked the man's wife to get additional Tylenol capsules from the store where the first bottle was bought. 
The FDA was informed that the wife provided two more bottles, one of which also contained pink granules, which were subsequently found to contain strychnine. The store operator removed remaining packages from the shelves, and :\tcNeil picked them up and found a

ofAmericans want a freeze. 
During a campaign trip to Ohio on Monday, Reagan said the nuclear freeze movement was being pushed by people who "want the weakening of America and so are manipulating many honest and sincere people." 
But Tuesday, reminded ofthe sup­port for the nuclear freeze move­ment by Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., he told reporters, "I did not have any Americans in mind." 
paign to capture the weapons ofleft­ist militias. 
Police sources said those arrested were being questioned by the Lebanese intelligence agency. There was no information on where the suspects were taken. 
Lebanese Moslem leaders last week charged that the army was carrying out indiscriminate arrests, especially in the Bourj el-Barajneh Palestinian re .fugee camp. 
Diplomatic sources said 2,000 were arrested last week and 600 still were being held. Prime Minister Shafik Wazzan was quoted in local newspapers as saying the army was rounding up illegal aliens, escaped convicts, and those whose papers were not in order. 

Scientists denounce use ofnuclear weapons 
NOTRE DAME INFORMATION SERVICES An international group of scientists, nne-fourth from the Soviet Bloc, have presented to Pope Paul II a statement that denounces nuclear weapons and calls upon the nuclear powers never to be the first to use them. The statement, given to the pope when he visited the unprece­dented gathering September 24 in Vatican City, had its origin almost a year ago in an initiative of University President Father Hesburgh and Franz Cardinal Konig of Vienna. Hesburgh and Konig met in Vienna for three days with presidents and other representatives of the ~cientific academies ofJapan, India, France, Great Britain, the Vatican, the Soviet Union, West Germany, and the United States un­der the title of the Vatican's Pontifical Academy ofSciences. "Nuclear weapons are fundamentally different from conventional weapons," the statement says, adding,"they must not be regarded as acceptable instruments ofwarfare." The statement calls upon all na­tions to: 
Never be the first to use nuclear weapons. Seek immediateendofhostilities in the "appallingevent" that nuclear weapons are used in a putatively tactical situation. 
Abide by the principle that force or the threat offorce will not be used against the territorial integrity or political independence ofanotherstate. 
Seek arms race reductions monitored by the "most effective means." 
Prevent the proliferation ofatomicenergy diverted to warfare. 
Take all practical measures to reduce the possibility of 
nuclear war "by accident, miscalculation or irrational action." 
Continue to observe existing arms limitation agreements 
while seeking to negotiate "broader and more effective agree­
ments." 

The statement presents a stark scientific assessment of nuclear war: "There is no prospect ofmaking defense sufficiently effective to protect cities since even a single penetrating nuclear weapon can cause massive destruction. There is no prospect that the mass ofthe population could be protected against a major nuclear attack or that devastation of the cultural, economic and industrial base of society could be prevented."

ACaliforniawomanhas been treated for severe eye burns after using eye drops that her doctor said contained high levels ofacid. But law-enforcement authorities tested the drops yes­terday and said they were "perfectly normal." "We think it was a false report," said Police Chief Raymond Farmer, who reported the preliminary test results. Another officiai,JuanitaJaronshi, ofthe San Bernardino County criminal lab, said it was too early to say ifthere was something wrong with the drops. "We've only done some preliminary checking, all they've done so far is check the Ph (the level of acidity) of the solution," said Ms. Jaronski, administrative assistant to the lab director. "Based on what we've determined, there is some acid in it (the solution), but the question is whether it has more than it should. We don't have any comparative figures from the 
manufacturer yet." Visine A.C. drops normally contain small amounts of acid. It was the second case of tainted over-the-counter medication reported in a week. Seven people in the Chicago area died after taking Extra Strength Tylenol that had been laced with cyanide. -AP 
A federal judge ruled yesterday that "starch blockers" are drugs and not food, and he ordered seven manufacturers and distributers destroy their remaining reserves of the product. "The safety and effectiveness of the product has yet to be tested" by the 
U.S. food and Drug Administration, U.S. DistrictJudge Nicholas). Bua ruled. Manufacturers and distributers had contended that starch blockers, which are made from the protein contained in raw kirlney beans, were a food and thus no FDA approval was required. But Bua said that "the intent in the marketing of the product is that starch blockers be used as a drug. Starch blockers are marketed for treat­ment of an overweight condition." Manufacturers contend the product helps people control weight by blocking or inhibiting the action of amylase, a digestive enzyme, so that ~tarch is passed through the body without being absorbed. Govemment attorneys contended that prolonged ingestion could lead to health problems.

Smugglers abandoned a truckloadofillegal 
aliens from El Salvador in the stifling south Texas desert, and four Salvadorans suffocated, autho-rities said yesterday. Eight others, suffering from dehydration, were hospitalized. "It wasn't a pretty sight," said Patrolman Henry Trevino, one of the first officers to arrive at the 18-wheel truck, where some of the dozen survivors were unconscious, some were dazed, and others were too weak to stand. An alert was issued for two men driving a second truckload of Salvadorans, including 10 people transferred by the smugglers from the abandoned vehicle. Officers had a description of one of the drivers, believed to be headed to Houston. Trevino said he tried to talk to one woman who was lying on top ofa dead woman inside the truck. "She just kind oflooked up at me in a glaze and seemed to be in shock," he said. "What makes t these people do these things?" Trevin< asked. "Things must be pretty bad over there to make these people go to these lengths to try to go to America." The Central American nation of El Salvador has been tortured by a civil war and the economy is in ruin. -AP 
The American Medical Association, 
which helped torpedo a Carter administration attempt to require warning leaflets with prescription drugs, launched a voluntary drive yesterday to give patients more information about a score of the more wide widely used medicines. "We strongly believe that patients need information about the drugs prescribed for them ..." said Dr. Joseph F. Boyle, chairman of the AMA's board of trustees. "Vp until now Ehey have had available only information that was either inaccurate, incomplete, or too complex for them to under­stand." The AMA, in cooperation with a standard-setting group called the United States Phamacopeial Convention, has prepared in­struction sheets written in plain language on the 20 drugs, including tranquilizers, insulin, oral penicillin, beta-blockers and nitrog~c~~in. Th~ pn;gram is costing $2.7 million, with $1.8 million donated by drug companies and the rest by the 240,000-member AMA. Boyle said the AMA has sent all 400,000 practicing U.S. physicians a brochure explaining the so-called "Patient Medication Instructions" along with copies of the instruction sheets. It invited all physicians to order 100-sheet pads, charging them only for postage and handling. By 1984, the physicians' group expects to have information sheets available for 100 of the most commonly prescribed drugs. -AP 
The United States and seven other countries have agreed to launch a "democratic initiative" in Central America and the Caribbean. They asked Western nations to do more to help democracy develop in the troubled region. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Thomas 0. Enders said Tuesday the 14-page document issued late Monday contains several separate agreements signed previously between the participating nations and represents "more clearly and firmly than ever before the blueprint of what it takes to bring peace to the region." The document was signed just before midnight Monday by high-ranking officials from Belize, Colombia, Jamaica, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and the United States. Costa Rica, which or­ganized the meeting, had issued invitations to all Caribbean Basin countries with democratically elected governments. Conspicuous by their absence were Mexico and Venezuela, two of the region's most powerful nations, which provide oil at highly favorable terms to Nicaragua and other poor nations in the area. Nicaragua and Guatemala were not invited because their governments were not elected, officials said.-AP

'New' Library Honors Hesburgh 
Imagine a facility with the capacity for two million volumes. An automated system to handle circulation and acquisition. Carpeting. A 57-year-old stock trading post decorating the second floor. Call it the Hesburgh Memorial Library. 
Director of University Libraries Robert Miller con­siders it an appropriate coincidence that the Memorial Library should boast these features when University President Father Theodore Hesburgh retires four years from now. 
The building will be named in honor of Hesburgh after he retires. 
Miller credits Hesburgh for the progress ofthe library since it's dedication in 1964. "Hesburgh gave a great deal of attention to the library," he said. "He is respon­sible for its being here. 
"When we moved in from the old library (now the architecture building), it would have been far more normal to construct a building one-half the size of this one. 
"Hesburgh had the foresight to expand the size for space. Probably no other university in this country that built a library 20 years ago hasn't had space problems." 
Although the library has a capacity for two million volumes, it currently houses about one million. 
The library ranks 66 out of 101 among university libraries in this country in terms oftotal volumes. 
But Provost Timothy O'Meara said that ranking is 27 out of 101 in terms of. volumes per student. "We should be better," he noted. 
If projects progress as planned, the library will be much better by fall 1986. 
O'Meara said the most im­portant concern during the next five years will not be with the building itself, but improving the collection of 
volumes.  "We  should  be  
doing  more  than  we  are  
doing," he added.  
O'Meara  noted  that  the  building  and  space  are  

available for improving the number of volumes, but money is needed. He said he is glad we have the build­ing...we may not be able to build one like it today. 
The Memotial Library will also undergo technologi­cal revision, in excess of $1 million. Miller expects a different configuration ofservices as soon as two years from now. 
Installation ofcomputer terminals, on the horizon for years, is in the final planning stages. Work should begin next year. 
He said routine work at the library will be handled by an integrated, automated system. The card catalog will gradually be replaced by computer terminals, which will be located within and in areas outside the facility. 
The staff size should not be affected by new technol­ogy. Miller predicts jobs will change for the better. He believes time now spent on tasks like sending notices could be spent on more positive services.· 
Miller hopes the changing technology will allow the library to play a far more active role in the educational

process. The terminals would increase dealings with various colleges, majors and graduate students. 
The library basement, now used for faculty offices, may become a 24-hour study area after the faculty office building is completed. 
Miller said this possibility is being seriously con­sidered, but it may pose security problems. "There would be a security problem with any building open all ofthe time," he noted. 
The study atmosphere of the library, particularly the second floor, ha.~ been a recurring topic ofconcern for Miller. He said seating in the second floor lobby was removed because it was a focal point for socializing. 
The hard surface made the noise overwhelming, and the seating was removed to reduce the number of people talking. Miller filled 
(,.,,,,_~..... 
that space with copy 
~.........._,.,,/ 
machines. 
Miller realizes that use of the library a.~ a social center can be controlled, but not eliminated. "Whenever you have two or three thousand people, there is going to be socializing going on... there is nothing you can do about it. 
"If students want a study area, they will have to make it that way." 
The Cushwa-Leighton library at Saint Mary's Col­lege reflects a different at­titude toward library 
facilities. 
Miller thinks this is partly because ofthe time when it wa.-; built. O'Meara considers the difference between the libraries a more fundamental one. 
"Ours is a university library," O'Meara said. "Theirs is a college library." 
Cushwa-Leighton has far more comfortable, relaxing environment in Miller's view. He considers it con­ducive to social use. 
But Miller does not think comfort will hinder the study environment. "The library provides adequate, delightful space for them to study," he said. 
"It's carpeted, which was easier for them to do than us, because ofthe square footage involved." 
Miller said carpeting was considered for the Memorial Library, but postponed because other univer­sities have had problems with it. 
"One university replaced carpeting three times in a ten-year period," he noted. 
Although there may not be carpeting, the Memorial Library should be a much-improved facility when the time comes for it to bear the name Hesburgh.

reported that plans for a meeting be­tween Glemp and jaruzelski col­lapsed because of the Communist government's plans to outlaw Solidarity, the independent labor federation which has been suspended since Jaruzelski proclaimed martial law Dec. 13. 
The diplomats said Glemp did not want to appear to give any semblance ofchurch approval to the action against the union. Glemp and the other Polish bishops have repeatedly urged the revival of Solidarity or creation ofsimilar inde­pendent unions.. 
One diplomat conceded, however, that the primate's actions were unlikely to deter the action to do away with Solidarity. 
Parliament is expected to adopt a government bill this weekend repealing the. authorization won in the summer of 1980 for labor unions independent of Communist Party control. All unions authorized under that law would be abolished, new unions would be licensed only ifun­der tight party control, and the right to strike would be sharply restricted. 
Unions also would be restricted-to 
members ofone trade or profession 
and limited until next year to the fac­
tory level, to fragment the labor 
movement "into myriads of mutual­
ly exclusive unions," commented 
one Polish journaJist and longtime 
observer ofthe labor movement.

Federalist Society 
Nuclear freeze debate tonight 
By Bobjohnson 
.Veus Staff 
The question of a nuclear freeze will be the topic of an informal debate between john Gilligan, for­mer governor of Ohio. and Prof. Charles Rice of the :">>otre Dame Law School tonight at -p.m. in the \lemorial Librarv auditorium. 
Rice is a prominent national spokesman for the conservative cause and will be proposing a more conservative view of nuclear freeze. Gilligan's interest stems from his past experience in government. 
The debate will focus on ques­tions such as whether or not to have a nuclear freeze and. if so. under what conditions. The moral and legal implications of a freeze will also be considered. 
The debate was arranged by the Federalist Society, which is cosponsoring the event with Tl!e Observer. Concern that the con­servative position may have been underrepresented in the past was the pervading reason for arranging the debate. 
According to Kevin Hasson, co­chairman of the society. the society wanted to "try to provide a forum where the conservative view can be

The purpose of the Federalist Society is to "help advance the con­servative position in discussions of the state of the legal order and public policy." according to Hasson. The society is a recently formed or­ganization in its first year of exist­ence at Notre Dame. 
Law students, law professors. and attornevs compose the national society which seeks to promote awareness of conservative views. Similar chapters exist at Harvard. Yale, Stanford. and the l"niversity of Chicago.

small number of people present for the talk and the nature of the subject itself, the situa­tion appears to have no correlation to the life of the Notre Dame student. However, a con-· nection does exist-quite a vital connection. 
The whole issue started in August of 1978 when over 2000 farm workers marched off fields in Ohio controlled by Campbell's. Most have yet to return. The dispute is over unsatis­factory working conditions. The laborers have been voicing discontentment of many types since '78, and for good rea;ons. 
The typical farm worker knows a life·of ut­ter poverty. He labors to earn an average hour· Iy wage (dicatated by the corporation) of a mere SI.96. Young children are often forced to labor in the fields alongside their parents, for every penny ofearning is crucial. Housing, supplied by the employer, often consists of a shabby one·room dwelling for an entire fami­ly. Plumbing does not exist in these settle· ments, and many camps do not meet Ohio Department of Health standards. Frequently, the farmer sprays pesticides on the fields with the worker still among the plants. To add to the saga, the National Labor Relations Act does not cover a farm worker. This means he does not even possess the right to form a uni­on and to have his voice of complaint heard formally by corporations. 
In response to their tragic circumstances, the workers are asking reasonable demands. They call for a fair wage of $3.50 an hour with a minimum of28labor hours guaranteed over a two week period. In addition, they request

What's in a name? 
I
t all happened the day that my parents named me. little did they realize the burden that they were· placing upon my shoulders. At the ripe old age oftwo hours, I began what was to become a daily struggle to assert my identity. 
Tatl Btown 
features 

When I was in my pre-school days, my mother enjoyed telling "baby stories" to my little brother and me. One story has always stood out in my mind as being totally indicative of my identity problem, a problem that grew like a thirsty sprout when finally given water. As a baby dressed in my stereotyped pink outfit, bonnet, pinafore, bobby socks and all, my mother and I would stroll along Kentucky Street in Detroit, I in my stroller and she pushing it. We would be greeted by the neigh­bors who would be taking their after-dinner walks. 
"Oh, what a nice little boy you have!" they would say. 
"Isn't he cute, George? 
Being the even-tempered woman that she is, my mot­her replied with all the coolness ofan arctic iceberg that I was a girl. 
"Oh. I'm sorry," they would say. 
I always wondered whether they were sorry that I was a girl and not a boy or whether they were sorry that they had been mistaken. From the tone ofvoice that my mother used I assumed it was the former instead ofthe latter. 
It was at this juncture in my career as a baby that creativity became the word of the day. Not to waste four years ofcollege education, mom decided that the best way to identify her daughter as such was to tape a bow to her hairless head. Needless to say, that didn't stop people. In an attempt to rectify the situation, mom gave me the mortal nickname, "Terri." Ifyou look at my by-line you will notice that I have changed the spelling. There's a good reason. 
Most people aren't protective oftheir names. I am. Would you like to be mistaken for a fellow student named Terence Adolphus just because both ofvou have the same nickname? The ironic part was that Ispelled it differently. My name was spelled with an "i," not a "y." To the day I die, I will maintain that the "y" ending denotes that it is a male term, not female. 
No one noticed when I changed my name to "Teri." 
Mail still came addressed to "Terry." 
With little hope left, I decided, while in my "unique" phase, to really change it. Taking a hint from my friends from New England, I created a phonetic spelling, "Tari." Would you believe, no one noticed' 
While in the depths ofdespair (and my sophomore english class with three other girls named "Terri"), I dumped the old nickname in favor ofa new acronym, "TB." If! hadn't been so desperate, I might have con­sidered the implications ofsuch an acronvm. Instead I was forced to ride the wave oftuberculosi~ jokes. What price fame! 
I don't knpw why but when I got to Notre Dame I sud­denly reverted to my formal given name. (It probably has something to do with the thousands offorms that we have to fill out, last name first, first name last.) "Therese" is not one ofthe more common names to have or to pronounce. Despite my stubbornness, I will even tolerate mispronunciations of"Theresa". It may not be common but at leas.t it is definitely female. And, after all, it is me. 


Senot Kelly's setves a balance 
~e hardest part about reviewing 
.1 restaurants is keeping it a secret. I try to avoid waitresses' seeking eyes, but it's hard to be subtle while furiously scribbling notes berween bites. I wonder how many people might be peering through that win­dow in the kitchen door. They probably don't even care, but a little intrigue makes the evening more enjoyable. 

John Higgins 
restaurant review 

This week my always mysterious and ever cliche dining partner and I stopped in Senor Kelly's on North Michigan Avenue downtown. Opened just recently, Senor Kelly's capitalizes on the latest fad in res­taurant motifS-r:,e Mexican-Irish cafe. Similar restat.rants in other cities really play up the theme in their menus and decor. I was very in­terested in seeing if Kelly's would be as much fun . 
The answer is, in a word, no. The restaurant is indeed nicely decorated, but, save for the waitresses dress, has no hint of either South ofthe Border or the Emerald Isle. Even the simplest touch, piped in music, is missing. The menu fares better, offering everything from corned beefand cabbage to enchiladas. But there are no real creative dishes here and the menu could be much more en­tertaining. 
Senor Kelly's has a wonderful wine list: margaritas, margaritas and strawberry margaritas. I generally don't even like margaritas but after one taste, I quickly ordered a pitcher ( 40 ounce for 59.00). A regular 8 ounce glass is 51.95 and the 17 ounce double is S2.95. The selec­tion ofimported beers ranged from Guinoess Extra to Carta Blanca, all at s1.75. 
The appetizer was the hardest choice and the biggest disappoint­ment. The chile con queso, a fondue ofcheeses, tomatoes and onions with flour tortilla chips ( S2.75 ), and the Mexican pizza, a flour tortilla topped with meat, cheese and other goodies seemed interesting. We opted for the quesadilla, a flour tor­tilla folded and filled with melted cheese, peppers and chopped tomato. I use that description loose­ly for there was hardly any cheese and the garnish was minimal. The cold gazpacho ~-oup ( S.95) was well prepared and filled with chopped vegetables. 
The Irish portion ofthe menu was rather ordinary and limited to 

corned beefand cabbage ( S4.95 ), Irish lamb stew ( S4.95) and a corned beefsandwich ( S2.95). The Mexican offerings were more ex­tensive with various combinations ofcorn and flour tortillas and beans, beef, chicken and pork from under 
S2.00 to 116.95 for the crabmeat enchilada (the best idea on the menu.) We had the wet burrito 
( 53.95) and the chicken chimic­hanga ( 53.95 ). 
The burrito, a flour tortilla filled with shredded or ground beef, beans, lettuce and sauce, was huge, the beefwas wonderfully seasoned and thick with cheese. The chimic­hanga, with shredded chicken, beans and cheese wrapped in a flour tortilla and quickly deep fried, was very good if a little bland. 
Their best kept secret is the St. Louis-style barbecue. The half-slab ofribs ( S 7.95) was the best I have ever tasted (and I'm a big Lee's fan.) The sauce was spicy, but not too hot. I can't believe their barbeque doesn't receive more attention on their menu. 
Senor Kelly's biggest drawback is their service. There were too many small problems to overlook. The first thing I noticed when we were seated was the wilting daisies at our table. Daisies keep for at least two or three days before looking this bad. Flowers are a nice touch, but . 
Also, the basket of tortilla chips we were served were stone cold and the hot salsa dip wa-s watery and not at all spicy. The quesadilla was served whole, not sliced as it should have been. The waitress, while friendly, seemed exasperated when we delayed ordering to enjoy our drinks. My burrito came with ground beef, not shredded as I re­quested. The bar had run out oftwo Mexican beers on the menu. Finallv they were out ofone ofthe desser;s we ordered. 
Senor Kelly's suffers from a problem common to many new res­taurants. The main dishes are well prepared, but many smaller but im­portant aspects escape attention. On the balance, the good food out­weighed the shortcomings. 



Classic Bruce 

N
ebraska is a classic album. But it may never become a popular one. Why is it a classic' Basically, Springsteen has taken his subject, the common man, and has encompassed on a single solo album what he 
· took five to originally do, and added a new dimension as well. On his first two albums, Greetings From Asbury Park, N.j. and The Wild, The Innocent, and TheE Street Shuffle, Springsteen dealt with com­mon men trying to understand why they are in their position. 
EdKontady 
record review 
OnBorn To Run, also a classic ofits time and perhaps in the future, 
Springsteen showed the common man trying to break out ofthe 
society that holds him down and tries to drown him in hopelessness. 
WithDarkness On The Edge OfTown, the common man isn't trying 
to run away anymore -it was time to stick it out and survive, and in 
a perverse sort ofway, enjoy beating life at it's own game. 
On The River, Springsteen tried to present a complete picture of 
the common man's.:view ofsociety, but the time was not ready. 
Something seemed missing, out ofplace, and with Nebraska, 
Springsteen showed us. 
What was missing were the reasons why a common man does the things he does. A perfect example is"Johnny 99": "Now judge I got debts no honest man could pay/The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they was taken my_ house away/Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man/But it was more'n all this that put that gun in my hand". 
But it's more than the lyrics that set this album apart as a classic, 
and Springsteen as a premier musician. His music isn't just accom­
paniment, it sets a tone for the song to be adequately presented. This 
is why The River was not as strong as it could have been, and why 
Springsteen decided not to use the songs on the upcoming EStreet 
Band album. 
During his last tour, Springsteen read and was deeply influenced 
by Joe Klein's book, Woody Guthrie: A Life. This is reflected in this 
somber look at a somber subject. The pop melodies of"Hungry 
Heart" and "Cadillac Ranch" can't carry the message Springsteen is 
trying to get across. 
This evolution of his music is a logical one, going from the CBS­demanded folk-rock-pleading style ofGreetings ..., the foundation oftheE Street Band on The Wild ..., the maturation of the Band on Born To Run, the harder rock ofDarkness . .., to the pop ofThe Ri11er and now the somber folk/rock, but more importantly non-pop sound ofNebraska. 
Now on to "Nebraska" itself: 
The vocals are an important part of this album, with harmonica breaks on almost every song. On"Atlantic City", "State Trooper", "My Father's House", and "Highway Patrolman", Springsteen gets different qualities out of his voice, and all of them are sucessful. The strumming guitar on the first three set the precise tone, while the finger-picking style of the latter lends it to the story structure of the lyrics. 
On "Mansion On The Hill" and "Used Cars", Springsteen puts a dreamy quality to the vocals, guitar, and even harmonica, letting the far-away lyrics remain far-away. 
The four songs that mark this album are the title cut, "Johnny 99", "Open All Night", and "Reason To Believe". "Nebraska" opens the al­bum and its harmonica opening and the dirge-like quality ofguitar, vocals and lyrics set the tone for the album, letting you know that something is wrong with this society. On "Johnny 99", you find out what it is and why. It's slightly rock influenced to set it off from the others, driving along with a good beat, although there is no drum­ming on the song or the album. 
"Open All Night" is another rock-influenced song, upbeat and driving, with strong vocals and quick guitar moves, a songofcelebra­tion -knowing that the common man is overcoming his obstacles to happiness. On the final cut, "ReasonTo Believe", Springsteen adds the final lyrical piece to his pursuit of the workings ofthe common man: "Struck me kinda funny/how at the end ofevery day/you can find some reason to believe.''

After a thrilling triumph in their 
own Notre Dame Invitational Mon­
day, Coach Noel O'Sullivan's Irish 
golfers have defeated 29 teams in 
two fall tournaments. while losing to 
only two. 

"We won it in great style," ~aid an elated O'Sullivan after the match. "Our players were realiy a unit, especially at the end -each player who finished cheered the next guy on." 
The I.rish were down b~· two 
strokes to Tri-State after the first 
three players finished. However, by 
the time first-seed Frank !.eyes 
recorded his blistering two-under­
par 69. Notre Dame had won the 
title for the tirst time in four years. 
Leyes, a junior. was the tournament 
medalist. 

"Frankie had a beautiful round 
and pulled out the team champion· 
ship for us," O'Sullivan said. 

The varsity squad, the Gold team, finished six strokes ahead of Tri­State. Tri-State had won their divi­sion and were on top of their conference last year with essentially

the same team. 
"Last year we had a lot of talent. but you don't win without ex­perience," the Irish coach said. "This year is the time to develop -the talent we had last ,·ear is still there, it's just that now we're clicking." 
The coach credits the player's concern S>n how the team tlnishes, not to their individual scores, that gives this year's team an edge over its opponents. This year's golfers shot IS strokes better in the Indiana State Intercollegiate Championships than the team did last year. 
"Last year we had three first-year starters, (Craig Peters. Dave Moor· nun, and Leyes) and we weren't plaving well all of the time, so the team was frustrated. :\:ow these guy~ ha,·e been in a lot more matches. so we now have no trouble getting five solid scores every time." 
The top six seeds for the Irish are seniors Peters and captain Stoney Ferlmann; juniors captain Stoney Ferlmann, juniors Leyes, Moorman, 
Leyes,  Moorman,  and  Dave  
Pangraze,  and  freshman  John  
O'Donovan.  Joe  Celarek,  junior,  

firmly holds the seventh spot. "Stoney is a great leader; he,

Angels 8, Brewers'3 
AHAHEIM, Calif. ( AP) -Don 
Baylor tied a playoff record by 
driving in five runs, and the Califor­
nia Angels out-slugged the Mil· 
waukee Brewers 8-3last night in the 
opening game of the American 
League championship series. 
The series was billed as a battle of 
two teams with bats of redwood 
proportion, and the Angels won the 
first game by swinging the bigger 
sticks and getting a seven-hitter 
from lefty TommyJohn. 
The second game of the best-of­
five series will be played tonight, 
with Pete Vuckovich, 18-6, 
scheduled to start for :\tilwaukec 
and Bruce Kison, 10-5, getting the 
call for California. 

Brewers' left-bander Mike 
Caldwell sputtered after three in­
nings, finally leaving in the fourth, 
whileJohn just got better. 
Milwaukee held ;,1 .3· I lead after 2 
and a half innings as John yielded a 
second-inning, two-run homer to 
Gorman Thomas. and gave up anoth­
er run in the third. 

However, the Angels got their of­
fense in gear in the bottom of the 
third, scoring four runs, two coming 
on Baylor's two-run triple. 
California, champion of the West, 
took a 1-0 lead in the first on a 
sacrifice tly by Baylor before a 
crowd of 64,406, the largest ever to 
see an American League playoff 
game. 

Brian Downing led off with a 
single and Doug DeCinces then hit a 
grounder back to Caldwell. The 
pitcher's throw to second, however, 
pulled Jim Gantner offthe bag for an error as both ·runners were safe. Downing wound up on third and DeCinces on 1oecond on a wild pitch, and one out later. Baylordrove in his first run with a fly to deep center tield. 
In the .\-tilwaukee second, Ted Simmons led off with a single and Thomas, who shared the major league lead with 59 homers with California's Reggie Jackson, lofted a 
1-0 deliwry from john into the left 
field seats. just barely fair. 
In the third, Milwaukee scored 
again on a fielder's choice grounder 
by Cecil Cooper.

GOLD FEVER -Saturday the Irish host a 4-I ~tiami team whose only loss was to highly ranked Florida in their opening game. It will be Notre Dame's 47th straight home capacity crowd. The game pits two ofthe country's best defensive teams. The Hurricanes rank 20th in scoring defense ( I3.0 points-per-game), while the Irish are rated 14th allowing just I I. 3 points per game. WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE BEACH-In the last meeting between the Hurricanes and the Irish, Notre Dame suffered embarassing 3 7-I 5 defeat on national television -closed out the 198I season for both teams. Miami led 30-6 at the half, as quarterbackJim Kelly picked the Irish secondary to pieces, throw­ing for 238 yards before intermission. Notre Dame's offense was vir­tually non-existent, as the only touchdowns scored by the Irish were on Greg Bell's 98-yard kickoff return and Dave Duerson's 88-yard interception runback. TURNING THE TABLES-The last time Miami came to town was in I 980. The Hurricanes arrived with the No. country against the rush, but they left town considerably lower on the list. Jim Stone rushed for 224 yards, almost quadrupling the over­land yardage given up by a stingy Hurricane defense prior to the game, as the Irish went on to a 32-I4 victory. This year it is the Irish defense that is No. 1 against the run ­No. 3 in total defense. A powerful Miami offense threatens to change those rankings, however, despite the loss of All-America candidate Jim Kelly to an injury in their second game of the season. Kelly is replaced by senior quarterback Mark Richt, who in his last three starts has completed 40 passes for 395 yards, two touchdowns, and three straight wins. Using a pro-style passing attack, the Hur­ricanes have averaged almost 200 yards a game passing -receivers having better than I 0 catches on the season. BIG PLAYS DOWN THE UNE -defense has been so successful this season is the play ofthe defensive line. The "Gold Rush" is led by senior Kevin Griffith, with four sacks for 30 yards lost and 2 additional tackles for losses ­Mike Gann, also with four sacks for 28 yards-lost. Senior Bob Clasby has added three more sacks, as the defense has combined for 16 sacks in three games with ­12 other stops for negative yardage. Also improving were the number of interceptions. After picking off just one (that's right, one) pass in two games responded to the MSU passing challenge by stealing four passes. But perhaps the most impressive defensive stat for the Irish is that in 42 attempts the Notre Dame defense has forced the opposition to sur­render the football without a first down 25 times. Sophomore linebacker Mike Larkin, last week's AP Defensive Player of the Week, leads all Irish tacklers with 34. He has been the leading tackler in each of Notre Dame's games thus far. BACKS TO (THRU) THE WALL-The Notre Dame offense, while admittedly needing more consistency, has been forced to start from poor field position on better than one-half of their possessions, 27­46. Tailback Phil Carter pounded his way into both the team lead in rushing and sixth place on the career-rushing charts with his 101 yard game last Saturday. He now stands at per-game rushing average -20th. THE SERIES ­Notre Dame holds a series advantage over the Hur­ricanes of I2-2-l. Miami broke an 1I game Irish winning streak in last year's debacle. The only other Irish loss was in I960. In a game played at the Orange Bowl in 1966, the two teams played to a score­less tie. Miami's victory over Louisville last Saturday was the 300th win for the Miami program. The Hurrricanes have now won I 0 of their last II games, I9 of their last 2I, and their last nine against indepen­dents.

With the loss of center Ma£k Fis­cher for about four weeks with a knee injury, Coach Gerry Faust once again has 'r...:f',, forccJ l:o-)Liggle his starting lineup. 
Faust has chosen to move All­America-candidate guard Tom Thayer into Fischer's center spot, and tabbed junior Neil Maune as Thayer's temporary replacement at the strong guard position. 
Speaking at his weekly press con­
ference yesterday at the ACC, Faust 
expressed his regret at fischer's in­
jury, but was confident that Thayer 
could step right in immediately 
without difficulty. 

"Thayer played there during the spring (when Fischer contracted mononucleosis)," said Faust, "so he knows how to play the position. Tom Doerger (who replaced Fis­cher last Saturday) played well, but he's only a freshman and he didn't practice at all last year because ofan injury. 
"Thayer's a three-year starter, and at this point of the season we want experienced players in our lineup." 
Maune. a 6-S, 258-pounder from Marthasville, Mo., was originally recruited as a defensive lineman, but was switched to offensive guard during the spring of 1981. He was granted an extra year ofeligibilitY at: ter missing most of the 19...,9 season and all of I980 with a shoulder in­jury.
