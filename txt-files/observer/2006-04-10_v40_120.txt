The Independent Newspaper Serving Notre Dame and Saint Mary's 
ND admits 3,484 from strongest pool ever 
By KAREN LANGLEY Associate NeWs Editor . 
If statistics on accepted appli­cants for next year's freshman class are any indicator, the incom­ing class of 2010 -like each freshman class in recent years ­will be the strongest academically in Notre Dame's history. 
This year's selections were made from a pool of applicants who boasted academic statistics equal to those of Notre Dame's incoming freshman class nine years ago, Director of Admissions Dan Saracino said April4. 
"In the end, we think this is the academically strongest and ethni­cally most diverse class we've ever had," he said. 
With 12,800 applicants, this year's pool -the largest ever ­was up 13 percent from last year, Saracino said. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions sent acceptance letters to 3,484 stu­dents, and Saracino said the University hopes to enroll 1,985 students for the fall 2006 fresh­man class. Notification letters were mailed March 30. 
The size of incoming classes must remain static due to the University's physical constraints, so the number of students admit­ted each year is based on previ­ous years' yields -or the per­centage of admitted students who choose to attend. The yield has ranged during the past four years from 56 to 58 percent, Saracino said. 
"If we admit them, there's a good chance they'll come," he said. 'That's not the norm across the country." 
Saracino said private U.S. col­leges have an average yield in the 20 percent range. 
This year's admitted students ­who represent all 50 states and 32 foreign countries -are on average slightly more academical­ly qualified than last year's admit­ted students. The admitted stu­dents' average class rank places them in the top 4.5 percent of their high school classes, and they boast an average SAT score of 1398 out of a possible 1600 and an average ACT score of 32 out of a possible 36. 
Last year's admitted students also averaged a top 4.5 percent rank and 32 ACT score, but had a

Saint Mary's RAs ~d for 2006-07 school year 
By LIZ HARTER News Writer 
Life as a Saint Mary's resident assistant intertwines dorm liv­ing and significant responsibili­ty, creating a unique living situ­ation for students who decide to take on the job. 
Shortly before spring break the Saint Mary's Office of Residence Life hired 49 RAs, including 25 who are new to the position. 
Freshman Pauline Kistka said she was nervous after being told she would be the RA in Queen's Court, a section of 
LeMans Hall rumored to be 
haunted by ghosts. 
Kistka said she quickly changed her mind, however, and is now excited to live there -especially since she will be a sophomore in a traditionally freshman section. 
"I think it'll be more benefi­cial for the residents ... ·I am just one year older than them and have experienced every­thing that they will be encoun­tering within the past year, and [will] be more in touch w!th what they are going through," Kistka said. ·

Students rebuild area homes 
By MEGAN O'NEIL Senior StaffWriter 
Hundreds of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students took part in the annual Rebuilding Together project Saturday in a west side South Bend neigh­borhood in hopes of making individual home improvements. 
The event, based at the Charles Black Recreation Center, takes place each April and helps low-income home­owners with necessary repairs such as new roofing, electrical wiring and yard work. This year's group spread out among two dozen residences in the area.

I'm surfing th1~ Web. 
Bonsai, in its modern form, dates 
back to about two thousand years 
ago in China. Another two thousand 
years before that, the Egyptians were 
using a similar practice. 
Now. here I am. a 21st century 
American teenager from Louisville, 
Kentucky, trying my hand at an 
ancient art. 
Yes, art-to craft a bonsai tree is 
to engage in an incredibly delicate 
and ereative process that requires 
patinnee, vision and know-how. 
Most people probably think that 
bonsai trees are just "dwarf' trees 
because of their genetics. This is 
entirely false. Bonsai come from the 
same seeds as their "normal" rela­
tives. For example, my little bonsai 
Chinese Elm is genetically pro­
grammed to grow into a full size, 60­
f'oot tall tree. 
What keeps a bonsai from growing 
to its potential is a careful regimen of 
pruning, which must be maintained 
for the entire life of the tree. In order 
to obtain a spneific shape, wire is 
used to btmd the trunk and/or 
brandws. 
But bonsai is much more than trim­
ming and bending. There is also an 
almost mystical aesthetic to it. 
Tlwre are three goals which bonsai growers attempt to bring out of the tree: shen, Znn and hi, or truth, esstmco and bPauty. No easy task, indeed. 
A Japanese cliche says the tree, its shape and the surface of the soil and the selected container come together to express "heaven and earth in one container." 
Whether or not I will accomplish that remains to be seen, as well as unlikely. Contrary to what Mrs. Simpson, my grade school art teacher, used to tell me, I've never been very artistic. But then again, maybe I've always sold myself short. I just keep telling myself I have some kind of pool of untapped potential. 
Maybe you think that this Zen stuff is just a bunch of mumbo jumbo. 
Instead of surfing Facebook in elass, cheek out some pictures of bonsai. Some of them can really take your breath away. One of my favorites is the second one that eonws up in a Google image search for "bonsai." I recommend you check it out. 
I would sell my soul to the devil to create that kind of bnauty. 
So hnre I am, setting out to become a master. Dream big, I always say. If nothing olse, it will give me some­thing to do this summer.

Intruder gains access to the front lawn of White House 
WASHINGTON-A scream­ing intruder made it onto the front lawn of the White House Sunday while President Bush was at home before being apprehended by Secret Service officers. 
Secret Service spokesman Eric Zahren described the man as "someone who has come to our attention in the past as a fence jumper." 
The bearded man, wearing blue jean.'> and a white T-shirt that said "God Bless America," jumped the fence oul'iide the White !louse and ran across the north lawn while repeat­edly yelling, "I am a victim of terrorism!" 
Members of the Secret Service emergency response team, including one holding a barking dog, chased the man with their guns drawn and surrounded him near the row of cameras set up for televi­sion stand-ups. 
Ancient dentistry proves to be a painful procedure 
WASHINGTON -Scientists have proved what patients in dentists' chairs often have thought: Drilling teeth is downright prehi<>toric. 
Dentists drilled nearly per­feet tiny holes in the teeth of live patients 7,500 to 9,000 years ago, according to car­bon-dating of skulls unearthed in a Pakistan graveyard. 
That means dentistry is at least 4,000 years older than frrst thought -and far older than the useful invention of anesthesia. The discovery of the dental work was described Thursday in the journal Nature. 
This was no mere tinkering. The 11 teeth found in the remote graveyard were hard­to-reach molars. In at least one instance, the ancient den­tist managt~d to drill a hole in the back end of a tooth, boring out toward the front of the mouth.

The Observer, staffers garner honors at ICPA conference 
Observer Staff Report 
The Observer was named the third-best Indiana daily student newspaper at the annual Indiana Collegiate Press Association awards ceremony Saturday. 
The Observer editorial board earned first place in the Best Staff Editorial category for "Ordinance a step backward," an editorial describing the amend­ment to the city's disorderly house ordinance passed by the South Bend Common Council in July 2005 as a step backward for relations between off-campus students and South Bend resi­dents. 
The Observer staff earned sec­ond place in the Best Single Issue category for its Nov. 18, 2005 issue, which featured several Irish Insiders as well as a front­page series on disciplinary proce­dures at Notre Dame. 
The staff also earned third place for Best Stand Alone/Pullout Section for a sec­tion on University President Emeritus Father Edward Malloy. 
Numerous staff members cap­tured a variety of individual hon­ors as well. 
Editor-in-chief Mike Gilloon won first place in the Best Sports Column category for "Give sen­iors credit," about the 2005 foot­ball team's senior class. Gilloon also won first place in the Best Sports News Story for "Strong start in the Steel City," an article covering Notre Dame's season­opening victory over Pittsburgh. 
Another first place honor went to scene writer Mary Squillace in the Best Entertainment Column category for "Welcome to the freak show," a piece on reality
TV . Second place honors went to former assistant managing editor Heather Van Hoegarden in the Best Sports Column category for "Navy rivalry more than foot­ball," about the relationship between the Naval Academy and Notre Dame. Winning third place were Van Hoegarden and former editor-in­
chief Claire Heininger in the Best Breaking News Reporting catego­ry for their coverage of Dave Duerson's resignation from the Board of Trustees. 
News writers Eileen Duffy and Nicole Zook won third place in the Best Non-Deadline News Reporting category for their cov­erage of tuition increases at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
Another third place honor went to former managing editor Pat Leonard in the Best Sports News Feature category for "Oh captain, my captain," an Irish Insider pro­rue of linebacker Brandon Hoyte.

"By our saying 'no' to those studenl'i, that doesn't mean they won't go on to do great things," hn said. "It's our loss we can't admit all of them."

The office also projects the incoming class will be 52 percent male and 48 percent female. 

Catholic students will likely make up 84 percent of the class, and alumni children will com­prise 23 percent of the class, Saracino said. The admissions oflice does give alumni children "special attention," Saracino said, a privilege explained by the strong allegiance of alumni to the University. 
Almost 10 percent of appli­cants are children of alumni, and enough of those applicants are accepted that they comprise 17 percent of the accepted student pool. A higher eonfirmation rate by legacy applicants explains their 23 percent proportion in the projeeted elass, he said. 
Despite the admissions office's reciprocation of alumni loyalty, Saracino said he is committed to keeping Notre Dame "inclusive, not exdusive" and preventing it from becoming a "dub." 
'Til always be sympathetic to those students who want to go to Notre Dame but don't have a hook to get them in," he said, noting that many accepted stu­dents have no connections to alumni, faculty, athletic teams or benefactors. 
The class is also projected to be the most diverse in the University's history, with 23 per­cent ethnic minorities and four percent international students, Saradno said. 
Though high class ranks and test scores are an undeniable factor in admissions decisions, they never guarantee admit­tance, Saracino said. He noted that the admissions committees chose to accept only 438 of the 849 applicant<> who were ranked number one in their high school classes. 
In addition to turning down almost half the valedictorians, admissions also rejected a candi­date who had a 1600 SAT score, Saracino said. ' 
All University officers are noti­fied when the admissions office sends decision letters, Saracino said, because alumni, benefac­tors, parents of current students and current students frequently contact officers on behalf of high school seniors whose applica­tions were denied. 
Saracino said about 600 e­mails, faxes and voieemails were received last year, with even more expected this year as 1,400 more refection slips were sent out. 
Though the admissions office does not compile statistics on accepted students' extracurricu­lar involvement until they agree to attend, Saracino said next year's freshman class -like the rest of the Notre Dame student body -will have resumes built on more than grade point aver­ages and test scores. 
"These student<; are just as tal­ented out of class," he said. "I wonder when they sleep." 
Admissions is currently hold­ing online information sessions for admitted students and is working with alumni clubs across the world in an attempt to ensure alumni contact with every admitted student. 

"We're not selling Notre Dame -we're telling the story of Notre Dame," Saracino said. "I don't want to lose a single student because of unanswered ques­tions."

Rising junior and RA Margaret Clark said RAs need to be adaptable to a variety of situa­tions while also able to enforce the rules. 
"The RA position is not a pop­ularity contest, but rather a position to ensure the safety of the students," Clark said. 
said she thinks she will contin­ue to improve as an RA throughout her time at Saint Mary's. 
"[This year] definitely taught me how to deal with certain cri­sis situations and how to say what needs to be said at the exact moment," she said, citing instances where she was able to convince, rather than force res­idents to seek help at the Counseling Center. 
Being an BA is a full time job, 
To ensure that safety, there are certain criteria that HAs must meet to be con­sidered for the position. 
Candidates must not have any outstanding debts to the College or be on disciplinary pro­bation, the Hesidencs Life 

"The RA position is not a popularity contest, but rather a position to ensure the safety ofthe students." 
Margaret Clark resident assistant 
Pangburn said, since RAs must set aside large amounts of time to be on call and meeting with other HAs. They must also be available to work the front desk in case a shift needs to be covered at the last minute. 
While it is a lot of work, being an HA is fun, Pangburn 

Web site reads. Applicants must also be at least rising sopho­mores and have at least a 2.5 grade point average. 
RAs' residential placement depends entirely upon where Hesidence Life feels the candi­dates' strengths would best fit the needs of the residents. 
Brittany Pangburn, a rising junior and RA in McCandless, said -but there are rules to follow. 
"The rules are there for a reason," she said. "You have to follow them for a reason. If something bad happens it's because we weren't doing our jobs."

Chavez clashes with diplomat 
CARACAS, Venezuela -Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said the U.S. ambas­sador was "provoking the Venezuelan peo­ple" and threatened Sunday to expel the American diplomat. 
Chavez accused Washington of seeking to escalate tensions and "looking for another incident." The U.S. embassy in Caracas had no immediate response to the president's comments. 
The State Department said the incident Friday "clearly was condoned by the local government," with local officials handing out snacks to perpetrators at the stadium. U.S. ollieials accused police of doing nothing, say­ing a single city police car stayed well behind the convoy while motorcyclists pounded and kieknd the ambassador's car. 
Chavez says the United States is plotting against him, an accusation American offi­cials deny. The United States, however, has said Chavez is stifling democracy.

With King Gyanendra and his opposition both refusing to back down, the situation appeared to be reaching its most volatile point since he seized absolute power more than a year ago.

The govern­ment warned of harsher measures in response. 
Security forces have killed three protesters, and thrown more than 800 in jail during four days of demonstrations that for the first time brought thou­sands of workers, profes­sionals and business people into the streets alongside students and political activists.

Burger King CEO Brenneman resigns 
MIAMI -Burger King's chairman and chief executive resigned Friday after start­ing a turnaround at the No. 2 hamburger restaurant chain, but his departure raised questions about the company's impending initial public offering and its continued revolving door for leaders. 
Greg Brenneman, 44, is a veteran of fixing troubled companies, such as Continental Airlines Inc. in the 1990s. He joined Burger King in August 2004 amid nearly two years of slumping sales, but the chain says it's now had eight consecutive quarters of sales growth at stores open at least a year, and profits are small but growing. 

Navistar faces accounting problems 
CHICAGO -Truck and bus maker Navistar International Corp., which has been sorting through accounting problems for months, said Friday it has dismissed its auditors and will restate financial results dating back to 2002. 
The restatements will cover fiscal years 2002-04 and the first nine months of fiscal 2005, Navistar said. 
As part of accounting overhaul, the parent of International Truck and Engine Corp. said its board of directors has fired Deloitte & Touche as its auditor and hired KPMG. 

Ford CEO accepts 40 percent paycut 
DETROIT -Ford Motor Co. Chairman and CEO Bill Ford received total compensa­tion of $13.3 million in 2005, or 40 percent less than the previous year after the automaker's North American division lost more than $1 billion, according to a proxy statement filed Friday with federal regula­tors. 
The No.2 U.S. automaker also said share­holders will vote on 10 proposals at Ford's annual meeting on May 11 in Wilmington, Del., including one that would remove sex­ual orientation from Ford's nondiscrimina­tion policy and another that would tie exec­utive compensation to progress in reducing gnHmhouse gas emissions from vehicles. Ford opposes both changes.

Julia Noongwook, 41, swapped some of her baeon and pineapple for a sliee of chicken ranch from a relative. Noongwook said it was the first time she had tasted the popu­lar chicken ranch pie, which also comes with bacon, red onions, tomatoes and mozzarella and dwddar cheeses. 
"It was good," she said. "I like rhickon." 
Frontier Flying Service, an intrastate airline, volunteered last year to fly the pi1'2as at no charge to 1wory village on its regular flight schedule out of Nome, a Bering Sea town settled in 1899 during a massive gold rush. 
Craig Kenmonth, general man­ager of Frontier, said the free deliv­ery service helps the carrier mar­ket itself in a way that benefits cus­tomers in the largely Yupik and Inupiat Eskimo villages. 
"Our success is directly tied to the suecess of the communities we serve," Kenmonth said. "And it's a fun thing to do." 
The savings can be enormous for Nome's largely impoverished satel­lite communities, which pay some of the highest fuel prices in the nation. In White Mountain, gas cost $3.39 a gallon at the beginning of April, according to Dorothy Barr, travel coordinator for the village. 
Delivery of three or four pizzas would normally cost a village about $25, said Matt Tomter, who man­ages Airport Pizza. Tomter's wile, Jeri Ann, owns the business. Freight is charged 40 to 60 cents per pound, depending on the vil­lage's distance from Nome, with a $10 minimum. 
"They fly the pizzas for nothing, which is huge for people out in the villages," said Tomter, who quit his job as a pilot at Frontier to run the thriving pizza joint. 
The Christmas pizza order cost Savoonga anyway after a snow­storm grounded Frontier, said Noongwook, who handled the order a'i the city's gaming manag­er. 
Only 25 of the pizzas made it out on Frontier before the weather closed in. The council wanted to make sure no one felt left out by getting late pizzas on the holiday, so it paid freight charges of almost $100 to have another airline fly 


Eggland' s Best beats regular eggs 
Associated Press 

CEI>AH KNOLLS, N.J.-When Eggland's Bost Inc. launched its low-fat, low-cholesterol eggs in 1992, U.S. ogg consumption was at its lowest point in decades as dieters and others spurnnd cho­lnstorol-rich foods. 
That gave the company a big advantage over generic eggs, and a clear marketing stratej.,ry, exe­cuted with TV ads depicting mothers and grandmothers hap­pily feeding their families l:ggland's eggs. 
The ads and the eggs' health bonefil'i have helped to boost rev­enues at the tiny Cedar Knolls company by double digits lor nine straight ynars.

"The good things we're better on and the bad things we're lower on," said Eggland's presi­dent and chief executive officer, Charlie Lanktree, whose enthusi­asm for his wares rivals that of chicken magnate Frank Perdue. "The perfect food just became more perfect." 
That's accomplished by feeding hens a carefully controlled vege­tarian diet, patented under the unwieldy title, "Egg Compatible With Cholesterol Reducing Diet and Method of Producing the Sarne. " 
"This is a really special product and it has science to back it up," added Lanktree, whose company regularly tests Eggland's eggs, collected at franchisee farms and from store shelves to make sure they have the nutrient levels claimnd on the package. 
Plenty of consumers are willing to pay a premium for "specialty eggs" such as Eggland's, which include nutritionally enhanced, organic and cage-free and free-

range varieties. 
"The specialty egg segment has grown dramatically in the last eight or nine years," said Alan Andrews, director of marketing at Pactiv Corp., the world's top sup­plier of egg cartons. 
The number of specialty eggs sold jumped from 40 million dozen in 1999 to more than 90 million dozen last year. Roughly 5 percent of the volume of fresh egg sales and 11 percent of the approximately $3 billion in rev­enues went for specialty products in 2005, according to data from Pactiv and market researcher AC Nielsen. 
While many specialty brands are sold locally, there are a few other regional or national brands touting lower cholesterol, higher ornega-3 levels or other health benefits, said Marcia Laux of the Iowa State University extension service. Brands include Organic Valley, Chino Valley Ranchers, Christopher Eggs, Land 0 Lakes and Egg Beaters, which are nutri­

About 40 percent of Airport Pizza's business comes from vil­lages that get their supplies by plane through Nome, the region's hub city, Tomter said. 
The Savoonga order was one of Airport Pizza's largest, but it isn't rare to get calls for bundles of 10 or 20 pizzas from villages nearly 200 miles away. Tomter said an order for six reindner sausage piz­zas once came in from the Arctic Ocean town of Barrow, the north­ernmost community in the U.S., 500 miles to the northnast. 
"Anytime they bring a lot of peo­ple into the village it's an easy way to feed everybody," Tomter said.

Playboy creator Hugh Hefner turns 80, reflects on life 
Associated Press 

LOS ANGELES -Playboy cre­ator Hugh M. Hefuer is in the mid­dle of an interview about his 80th" birthday when a TV cameraman asks him to move a statue of for­mer girlfriend Barbi Benton from the shelf behind him. 
The statue's nude breasts were in the shot and that might not pass muster with TV decency standards. 
"A<> much as things change, they stay the same," Hefner remarks, disappointment in his voice. "There is still controversy about, maybe even more than before, not just nudity-a nude statue." 
That is Hefner's point -that Playboy with its mission of sexual liberation is as relevant as ever in these days of federal government crackdowns on television content that some consider indecent. 
"Attitudes toward nudity and Playboy have changed, in many ways, very little," says the man who gave the world the Playboy centerfold. "In some ways it is even more political than it was in the '50s and '60s." 
The invitation to Hefuer's birth­day party Saturday-he turned 80 Sunday -unfolds to show three photos of him: one as a toddler, one holding his new magazine in 1953, and one showing a smiling young Hefuer with wavy black hair and his iconic pipe. 
The hair is thinner now and gray, almost white in places. His hearing is gone in one ear and he has the slightest bit of trouble getting up from his library couch after the interview. He quit smoking after a stroke in 1985. 
But otherwise, the man dressed in black silk pajamas and a scarlet silk jacket with black lapels shows few other signs that he is becoming an octogenarian. 
"Maybe to some extent 80 is the new 40," he says, smiling. "I truly believe that age -ifyou're healthy -age is just a number. On many levels I feel younger today than I did 10, 15 years ago." 
Hef has a lot to make him feel young. He lives with three young, blonde girlfriends in his ornate mansion in Holmby Hills. Their life is being documented in a hit reality TV show on the E! channel, "The Girls Next Door." 
His company is opening a new Playboy club in Las Vegas and a new edition of the magazine has debuted in Indonesia, sparking controversy in that largely Muslim nation. 
The famous mansion, with its free ranging exotic birds, stone grotto and game room, is a part of the fantasy he has carefully crafted around himself. 
As Hefuer reflects on his life and career, he recalls that he first rein­vented himself at 16, when he was rejected by a girl he had a crush on. He began referring to himself as Hef instead of Hugh, learned the jitterbug and began drawing a comic book, "a kind of autobiogra­phy that put myself center stage in a life I created for myself." 
He did it again in 1960, when he began hosting a TV show, bought a fancy car, started smoking a pipe and bought the first Playboy man­sion, in Chicago. 
"I came out from behind the desk and became the living personifica­tion of the dreams and fantasies that were in the magazine," Hefher said. 

Although he continues to person­ilY the Playboy philosophy, he is not unaware of the passing years. 
"You come to a point in life in which you begin to lose some very dear friends, some of whom are peers in terms of age," he said. "In the last few years, I have lost some very dear contemporaries, includ­ing my best buddy in high school, the first girl I went steady with, Mel Torme, one of my closest friends." 
Any regrets? 

"Certainly it is a life well-lived and I wouldn't trade places with anybody," he said.

"There's a war on men in this coun­try." 
Or at least that's what Stephen Colbert announced during a recent interview with conservative Harvard professor I Iarvey Mansfield on Comedy Central's "The Colbert Heport." Mansfield, of course, was on the show pro­moting his new book, "Manliness," which delves into a topic that he daims society is ignoring in the wake of the gay and feminist equality movements. Unfortunately for the appropriately named Mansfield, though. he forgot a vital fact while writ­ing this tome of testosterone that Colbert was kind enough to point out on the show: "Heal inen don't read books." 
How true. 
Still, what exactly does it take to be a real man in America? According to Mansfield in his 300-page paean to prostates, real men are "often intoler­ant," "irrational," "prefer times of war, conflict, and risk" and, most important­ly, they "disdain women's work." In fact, during his interview with Colbert, Mansfield pointed out that in an ideal world, men would earn two thirds of the family drink beer. Not girly mixed drinks with feminine names like "Sex on the Beach" and "Flirtini." but manly lagers, ales, stouts, and draughts that fill out your gut, put hair on your chest, and force you to let out manly burps that eould literally knock down the walls of Club 23. 

It probably eouldn 't hurt to have the occasional bottle-smashing bar fight either, because chicks dig guys with broken shards of Guinness wedged in their cheeks. 

Of course, manliness isn't all sunshine and rainbows, as Mansfield and others would make it seem. There is a tragic dark side that comes along with the weight of lugging around a Y chromosome all day.

While my version of manliness will still involve avoiding mirrors, tight jeans and all hair products other than Pert Plus (and drinking Irish beer by the pint will cer­tainly still be an important aspect of being a man), there are going to have to be some changes around here.

But what else makes a man a man? A little over a year ago, one female Observer writer pointed out that she was sick and tired of "metrosexual" guys who spend half the day in front of the mirror and the oth'er half attempt­ing to use the lake, the reflecting pool, and toilet bowl water to make sure that their hair is styled correctly. More important than that, she said, real men there are even movies 
about this bizarre con­nection between manliness and lazi­ness, like the recent Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker comedy, "Failure to Launch" (which, I am happy to say, I was too busy being manly to see). 
But what does this all mean? Have men simply grown too content with their manly superiority to even attempt to compete with women in the work­place in this era of "equal opportuni­ty?" Or perhaps, as Mansfield writes, since "women are the weaker sex," it "SportsCenter" on repeat, 
Food Network should be 

mandatory daily programming so that 
manly men can learn to cook something 
other than Pop Tarts and Easy Mac for 
their families one day. Finally, since it 
doesn't look as if Congress will be rein­

something will have to be done about 
this tendency in undisciplined guys to 
avoid deaning dishes, floors, bath­
rooms, their bodies and basically any­
thing but their car exteriors and 
PlayStation controllers. 
Because what is the real goal of my ·new version of manliness? Becoming a trophy husband, of course. 
And since most of us don't look or

going to help to know how to scrub a

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

ROTC presence not endorsement 
In his April 5 letter ("Pandora's box"), James Parrot argues that the presence of HOTC on Notre Dame's campus consti­tutes endorsement of the war in Iraq. Not so. The training of military oflicers has been part of Notre Dame's history for over sixty years, well before our country went to war in Iraq. Sustaining an HOTC program does not constitute endorsement of any particular military action, it simply recognizes the Church sanctioned right of nations to raise armies and defend themselves. 
Since Parrot chose to compare sponsorship of HOTC with endorsement of "The Vagina Monologues," let me make anoth­er comparison. Unlike prostitution, sexual abuse of a minor and extramarital sex, which are always morally wrong, the rightness or wrongness of a particular military action is a mat­ter of prudential judgment. George Weigel in the January 2003 issue of "First Things" offers a t;ompelling argument justifying the invasion of Iraq in light of Catholic just war tradition. 

Archbishop O'Brien of the Archdiocese of the Military Services says Catholics may, in good conscience, participate in the Iraq war. Catholic moral teaching allows room for dis­agreement on this issue. Even if Notre Dame were to officially support the war in Iraq, it would not necessarily be contradict­ing the teachings of the Church. A discussion about the war in Iraq would be a good thing, but please leave the HOTC pro­grams out of it.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Calllpus comics: Questioning 'Jockular' 
Comic harmful to relationship 
As a Saint Mary's alumna who had to make the choice between Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, I was somewhat disheartened by the comic that appeared in today's Observer (April 6). It seems that each time a step is taken forward in strengthening the relation­ship between two outstanding institutions, two steps backwards are taken when a few students make the choice to print something such as this comment attempting to damage that relationship that has been so vital to the existence of both campuses. 
In calling Saint Mary's a "parasite" to Notre Dame, it is important to view how that relationship works both ways. While it is true that Saint Mary's students are able to attend football games, classes and even the dining hall .at Notre Dame, it must be kept in mind that Notre Dame students are given equal opportunities. On many occasions I saw Notre Dame students in our dining hall during my four years at Saint Mary's. Even more importantly, as an education major, I had several Notre Dame students in my classes, as this major does not even exist at Notre Dame. Without Saint Mary's, these stu­dents would not have had many of the opportunities that they did. 
In addition, the use of the term "p;trasite" implies a negative relationship in which one body is harming another. In posing the comic strip in the fashion the authors chose to do, they are saying that Saint Mary's is in some way threatening to the Notre Dame commu­nity. If the ability to take advantage of multi­ple majors on both campuses and the ability to work together to promote common values is harmful, then perhaps the authors need to reevaluate what a positive relationship would be. I would hope that a group of adults could continue to promote what has been for so many years such a positive rela­tionship in which both parties benefit rather than making an attempt to harm what could be such wonderful experiences and opportu­nities for students on both campuses, before the tension between the campuses mounts so high that this great history dies altogether. 
Instead of trying to fmd the negative in sit­uations, let's look for the positives and what a wonderful opportunity it is to have two great campuses who have worked so well together for so long so that students of both campuses can continue to enjoy the experi­ences we as alumni have been so fortunate to enjoy, and continue to strengthen this relationship as we work to make each insti­tution the best it can be. 
Lauren Roederer alumna Saint Mary's College Class of2005 April6 


Comic hurts community 
I am writing this letter as both an alum (Notre Dame '95) and parent of a Saint Mary's student. In the April 6 edition of The Observer, the "Jockular" comic strip refers to Saint Mary's and its student population in general as "parasites." I question The Observer's editorial board policy and overall judgment in allowing the comic strip to run concurrent with the issuance of University President Father John Jenkins' highly publi­cized efl'ort to create a new vision for Notre Dame in the future -a vision that attempts to promote a campus-wide sense of reaching out to others with the hopeful exchange of opinions, ideas and overall life experiences. Perhaps the authors do not share the same vision as Jenkins and favor a culture that excludes members from the community, or the authors simply do not know the first rule of comedy: to know one's audience. To allow the comic strip to run and blatantly insult Saint Mary's contribution to what we know and love as "the Notre Dame Experience" is an even greater insult. 
Since the inception of Sorin College, Saint Mary's College and its student population have been a contributor to the sense of com­munity in this experience. I would encourage The Observer's editorial staff, and the comic strip's authors in particular, to review their 
. actions in light of Jenkins' efforts to make a great University even greater and hope that they would then extend an apology to every­one affiliated with Saint Mary's and the stu­dent population in particular. 
Michael McKevitt alumnus Class of 1995 AprilS 


Humor juvenile 
While I was disappointed by the blatantly back-handed content of Alec White and Erik Powers' "Jockular" comic in the April 6 edition of The Observer, I was more appalled by how far it fell short of being funny. It read like. a comic constructed from the Keenan Revue's rejected punch lines. 
Really biting satire, wit and irony, when used effectively, are the stuff of great comedy-and when really great, it should leave the criticized parties stifling a chuckle in spite of themselves. But when humor's potent tools are placed in juvenile hands, the e!Tect is akin to a whoopee cushion placed on the chair of that unsuspect­ing, awkward cl;wbby girl in your bio lecture. While the joke may provoke a few reflex giggles, it should also pro­duce a collective wince -both the stunt and its target are so obvious that the joke would be best confined to elementary school playgrounds or Adam Sandler movies. I was actually surprised that the comic didn't some­how try to work in quotes from "Billy Madison" or "Napoleon Dynamite"­that tactic certainly would have been as easy as the name-calling Powers and White instead resorted to by implicitly terming Saint Mary's stu­dents parasitic. 
My aim with this letter is merely to call out Powers and White on what they did in that comic, which was to repeat a tired joke rather than to seek out new, or at least more clever­ly and subtly delivered, material. I am familiar with their hilarious campaign last year for Notre Dame's student body president and vice president, so I am sure they would have been capa­ble of this had they any knowledge of Saint Mary's beyond its stereotypes. 
Allison Roche alumna Saint Mary's College Class of 2005 April9 


Portrayal inaccurate 
I write with a heavy heart today after having seen yesterday's (April 6) "Jockular" strip charac. terizing the women of Saint Mary's College as "parasites." 
It grieves me to see that such negative attitudes are not merely existent on campus but that they are tolerated to such an extent that the young men who mistook their bigotry for humor could submit such a cartoon for publi­cation with no fear of reprimand or community dismay. 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's are frequently called "sister schools," and like all sisterly relationships, there are some­times bumps in the road and fric­tion in the interaction. Like sis­ters, too, they share some com­mon characteristics and a com­mon heritage, but they are not the same school and should be valued and respected for the diverse gifts that each brings to the community of faith and learn­ing that the Congregation of the Holy Cross planted in South Bend over a hundred and sixty years ago. While Saint Mary's undeni­ably benefits from its relationship with Notre Dame, the benefits are hardly one-sided-Notre Dame students who wish to become certified in education take the requisite coursework at Saint Mary's, for one example, and the Keenan Revue has been hosted at Moreau Auditorium for years because its audience capacity is greater than any of the performing arts venues at Notre Dame. 
Alec White and Erik Powers owe a heartfelt apology to the Saint Mary's community for their narrow and uncharitable remarks and to the Notre Dame community for their poor repre­sentation of the same.

'Jockular' is comedy 
I am writing with a piece of advice for the authors of Friday's editorial ("Jockular misleading and offensive," April 7) and the authors of multiple other letters to the edi­tor that have criticized "Jockular" for varying reasons over the course of this academic year. Take a chill pill, people. "Jockular" is a comic strip. It is a joke. Its she~r nature as a comic"!:;trip suggests that it is not meant to be taken seriously. In the past month, "Jockular" has mocked or addressed in some form the fol­lowing topics: Touchdown Jesus, dining hall food and employees, the broken clock on the front of O'Shag, the nickname "Fighting Irish," the Viewpoint section itself, eating babies, professors and the Notre Dame men's basketball team. 
The authors of "Jockular" are not trying to promote any anti­Saint Mary's sentiments, nor did they mean to insult the mainte­nance workers at O'Shag, or make fun of a timeless Notre Dame land­mark. They are simply doing what good comedians do. They are tak­ing pertinent issues and putting them in perspective. If they want­ed to insult Saint Mary's students, they would do so somewhere else in the paper. Please note that this letter does not intend to take any stance on the Saint Mary's issue as presented in "Jockular." My only message is to relax, take a deep breath, and laugh every once in a while. Things aren't always as serious as they seem.

DPAC REVIEW 
Not your typical Bible story 
'Salome' gives new take on a classic tale, blends multicultural influences 


By MOLLY GRIFFIN Assistant Scene Editor 
Take a Biblical story adapted for the stage by an Irish writer in a production inspired by Japanese and Filipino per­formance traditions -and a picture of the produdion of "Salome" emerges. The wide-ranging inllunnces obvious in the production of Oscar Wilde's "Salome" made th11 show a truly unusual theatre experience that was intriguing on a num­ber of levels. 
The production, presented by the Department of Film, Television and Tlwatre, showcased an all-student cast with the exception of Salome, who was played by visiting performer Olga Natividad. Professor Anton Juan, an internationally acelaimnd director who has put on productions around the world. directed the show. 
It also had an unusually long run -11 performances ranging from between March 2H and April 9 -for a theatre production. 
Thn influences of Kabuki and Kyogen, both Japanese theatre forms, and Pangalay, a typn of Filipino dance based on half-women, half-bird figures, made the production an exceptionally unique experience. The Plaborate costumes, the staging and the movements of the char­acters on stage added a different per­spective on a traditional, Christian Bible story. 
The Biblical story behind "Salome" tells tlw story of how John the Baptist was bnhnadnd. The story -found in Mark 6:17-28 -involves Herod's, ruler of Galilee in Philistine, marriage to his brother's former wife Herodias, who is Salome's mother. Herod asks Salome to dance for him, promising her anything she desires, and she asks for the head of John the Baptist. 
In Wilde's version, which changes the Biblical version slightly, the idea of lust and unattainable desire figures as the central theme. Salome desires the head of John the Baptist-called Iokanaan in the play -because he rejects her amorous advances. Herod offers Salome "up to one half" of his kingdom in exchange for her to seductive dance, and he is forced to give her Iokanaan's head instead. The Syrian, another character in the play, kills himself because of his unrequited desire for Salome as well. 
The costumes -which were designed by Richard Donnelly and showed heavy influence from Kabuki theatre -were breathtaking and made the production visually stunning. The impressive hats and capes of the music playing Nobles (Meghan Hartmann, Megan O'Donoghue and Kathleen Hession) and the boxy bamboo armor of the soldiers (JudeAnne Jasso-Murad and Madison Liddy) were particularly unusual. 
The more familiar Samurai armor seen in Herod (Luke Cieslewicz). the Young Syrian (Jonathan Toupes) and Tigellinus (Larry Richey) showcased the ability of the costume designers to add diversity to traditional designs. 
The Young Syrian's armor was made of fibrous material, while Herod's vivid red and black costume looked slicker and had more detailed patters. Tigellinus' costume was one of the most impressive, with a suit of armor made from what appeared to be interlocking black stones and a helmet with antlers on it. 

The most beautiful costumes may have been the robes that Salome and her mother Herodias (Krysta Dennis) wore. They intricate vivid colors and intricate designs of their Japanese robes were particularly stunning. While Salome's gold-embroidered, white robe was beau­tiful, it was the intricately detailed red robe worn by Herodias that garnered the most notice. The colors of the costumes also served to highlight the constant ref­erences to red and white that occurred throughout the action of "Salome." 
The Kabuki make-up was minimal enough to emphasize the impressive cos­tumes, but still added a degree of theatre to the production as a whole. The absence of make-up also served to difl'er­entiate certain characters, notably Iokanaan, from other actors on stage. 
The music accentuated the half-sung, half-spoken dialogue, which added an interesting twist to what one would expect from traditional theatre. Noises, such as the banging of a stick or the ring of a bell, also served to emphasize cer­tain words or moments during the play. 
Wl}iW not at the center of the action, the Aic's constant presence in the play, couple-ith the not-quite-sung words, gave th~erformance a unique quality somewhere between a musical and a stage play. 
Despite the nearly all-student cast of "Salome," the play could have passed as a professional production. Guest artist Natividad made a fantastic Salome, but the entire cast was fantastic. Particularly notable performances included David Tull's impassioned Iokanaan and Luck Cieslewicz's gleefully nasty, and later tragic, Herod. 
The highlight of "Salome" is the dance Salome gives for Herod, and this produc­tion did a masterful job of showcasing its potential. Natividad's dancing was engag­ing, and the layered dress that came off in pieces during her performance was an achievement in costume design. The number also showed off the music and set design of the production. 
The show's final moments. which show­cased the danger and destructive power of lust, shoW'tld Salome's horrible lust for Iokanaan by having her kiss his decapi­tated head. The final moments of the play, while somewhat disturbing, were highly engaging and powerfully empha­sized the major themes of the play. 
Many plays combine ,!lifferent influ­ences and try to place old stories in new perspectives, and "Salome" masterfully balanced the diverse influences it encom­passed without distracting from the story itself. 
From the costumes to the staging, the music to the performers, "Salome" not only blended different culture elements but also balanced all of the elements of theatre without letting any one over­whelm the others. This combination made "Salome" an exciting and enter­taining theatre experience.

Notre Dame was forced to withdraw from the James Madison University Invitational due to a flight cancellation out of Chicago Friday evening. 
The tourna­ment was held Saturday and Sunday in Harrisonburg, Va. at the Lakeview Golf Course. 
"Our luek really just couldn't have been worse," Irish coaeh Debby King said. 

The event would have been the team's last before the Big East tournament, whieh will be held in Dade City, Fla. April 23­25. 
King said she hopes her team's play in the Big East 
tournament will not be nega­tively impacted by missing the James Madison event. 
"We just have to try and stay as eompetitive as possible after this," she said. 
In order to compensatn for the missed event, King said she might explore the possibility of organizing a competition with either the Notre Dame men's or Saint Mary's team. 
King also said that she is not sure how this will affect her team's bid for a berth in the NCAA tournament.

Irish win three on road trip 
Ruthrauffleads Notre Dame lineup in sweep 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 
Notre Dame bounced back after dropping the first game in a Saturday doubleheader to Syracuse 2-1 with three straight wins -a 7-5 ten-inning win at Syracuse and a sweep of the Pitl<>burgh Panthers (7-0 and 14­
4) Sunday. 
The Irish (21-12, 5-1 in the Big East) started the weekend off strong at Syracuse against the Orange (20-15, 8-2 in the Big East), but failed to come out with a win. 
Syracuse left fielder Tonye McCorkle singled down the left­field line with two outs in the bottom of the second inning. Designated player Cassie Morales scored from third as the go-ahead run in the 2-1 Syracuse win. 
Despite the score, the Irish still outplayed Syracuse in the eyes of Notre Dame head coach Deanna Gumpf. 
"In our one loss, we defmitely played well," Gumpf said. "We out-hit and out-pitched them, but the intensity just wasn't there." 
Intensity has been one of the focal points for the Irish this sea­son, and it showed in the night­cap against Syracuse. Notre Dame pinch hitter Carissa Jaquish's one-out, two-run shot to right center in the top of the tenth inning drove in the win­ning runs in Notre Dame's 7-5 win against Syracuse. 
Notre Dame's bats were key in the team' second victory of the weekend. The Irish lit up Orange pitchers for a dozen hits, includ­ing home runs by Jaquish and senior third baseman Meagan Huthrautl". 

The pitching duty for the game was split between the two Irish aces -senior Heather Booth and freshman Brittney Bargar. Bargar started for Notre Dame and struggled through the first five innings, surrendering four runs on 11 hil<>. 
Booth entered the game in the sixth and pitched five stellar innings of relief, allowing only two hits and one run. 
Booth's performance in relief was crucial to the Notre Dame win, as the Irish failed to muster offense until the Jaquish home run. 
For Booth, the difference between the two Syracuse games was not the team's inten­sity, but rather its nerves. 
"We came out in the first Syracuse game a little anxious, but we were a lot more disci­plined in the second game," Booth said. 
Notre Dame played its second doubleheader of the weekend in Pittsburgh Sunday, sweeping both games in decisive fashion as its bats came to life against the Panthers (24-17, 7 -3). 
Notre Dame dominated the Panthers on offense and defense in game one, winning 7-0 behind a seven-inning shutout by Booth and a home run by Ruthrauff, her second in two games. 
Booth shut down the entire Panthers lineup, allowing only five hits in a complete game ­all singles -while striking out 
11. But unlike in the Syracuse doubleheader, her performance was backed with plenty of run support. 
Behind Ruthrautrs home run and a two-RBI day for senior shortstop Sara Schoonaert, the Irish were able to notch up seven runs against Panthers starting pitcher Meghan Bostick. 
Easily the biggest game of the day for the Irish came in the sec­ond eontest against Pittsburgh, a 14-4 Notre Dame victory led by a record-breaking day by

Ruthraufl". 
Ruthrauff broke the Notre Dame records for home runs and HBI in a game in the second game against Pittsburgh, blast­ing three home runs -including a grand slam in the seventh ­and seven total RBI. The Irish as a whole also tied the team record for hits in a game with 21. 
Irish head coach Deanna Gumpf was most proud of her team in this game, praising especially her dominant offense. 
"We hit the ball really well out there against Pittsburgh in the second game," Gumpf said. "Ruthrauff was on fire this weekend, and it really showed in that game." 
The Irish began their barrage of runs in the first inning with four runs, including Ruthrautrs first dinger. Notre Dame piled on insurance runs throughout the game, up until the seventh with Ruthrautrs grand slam. 
"My swing was intact out there today, and I was just seeing the ball really well," Ruthrauff said about her record-breaking day. "The whole team was on a roll right from the start." 
The three wins over the week­end boosted Notre Dame's confi­dence in Big East play for the rest of the season. With confi­dence in their bats and arms, the Irish are ready to continue playing -and winning -in the Big East. 
"I we can keep playing well and pitching well, we can win the rest of our games this year," Gumpf said. "We just have to keep hitting the ball like we have been."

Nuggets halt Warriors comeback in close call 
Camby's 17 boards, 8 blocks lead defense 
Associated Press 

DENVER -The Nuggets moved closer to their first division title in 18 years, hold­ing off the Golden State Warriors 95-92 Saturday night. They lost focus, they were sluggish, they let an undermanned team with no c.hance of reaching the play­offs come back from a 16­point deficit. 
But they won. 

"It was an ugly win, but we will take it," said Denver's Ruben Patterson, who had 12 points. "I think guys had a lot in their heads today with what happened to Julius last night. I know I did. We were all dev­astated and hurt. But it could have been worse. He could not be here today." 
Hodge, Denver's first-round draft choice last year, was shot while driving on a north Denver highway around 2 
a.m. after visiting a friend at a nightclub. Though he was list­ed in fair condition and is expected to recover within a few weeks, the incident left the Nuggets clearly shaken. 
Denver got off to a slow start, went on an 11-2 run to go up 12 at the half, then let Golden State back in it. The lack of focus was particularly evident at the free throw line, where the Nuggets were just 21-of-40, including 7-for-16 in the fmal quarter. 
If not for Carmelo Anthony's 28 points and Marcus Camby's play inside (17 rebounds and eight blocked shots), Denver wouldn't have much of a chance, even against a team without its top two scorers. But by pulling it out, the Nuggets can win their first division title since 1988 with another win or a loss by Utah. 
"No one thought when you wake up and hear that type of news that you have to go through stuff like that," said Camby, who had at least 15 rebounds for the 15th time this season. 
Golden State played without guard Baron Davis for the 13th straight game because of a sprained ankle and had to do without Jason Richardson, who's been bothered by sore knees. Those two combine for 
41.4 points per game, so that wasn't exactly what a team that had lost seven straight games needed. 
It showed in the first half. 
With Mike Dunleavy and Derek Fisher as their only true scoring threats, the Warriors couldn't muster much offense early, hitting only eight of 26 shots in the first quarter and shooting 34 percent in the first half. It didn't help that Dunleavy and Fisher went a combined 3-for-15 in the half and Camby was all over the place on defense, swatting four shots in the first quarter. 
But after their first-half struggles, Dunleavy and Fisher fought their way back, helping the Warriors cut Denver's lead to 71-68 by the end of the third quarter.

Irish finish third in tournan1ent 
Notre Dame qualifies five more for Big East 
By DAN MURPHY 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame lnft George Rider Track in Oxford, Ohio Saturday with seven wins and five new qualifying marks for the quick­ly approaching Big East Tournament. Both tho men's and women's teams finished in third overall with 11 :~ and 120 points, respectively. 
The host Redllawks took first 
place for both groups in the 
12-team meet. 
Freshman Mary Saxer man­aged to qualify for the NCAA regional meet with her victory in the pole vault competition. !lor 3.R-meter (12 feet,., 5 inch­es) leap was the second highest mark eleared in the conference so far this year. Sho also land­ed a spot in the program's top­live all-time marks, tying sen­ior Jaime Volkmer for fifth place. 
With a smaller squad, Notre Dame's focus was directed towards getting conference qualifying marks rather than wins. The five new additions to the conference meet are Elizabeth Philipp (steeple­chase), Lauren Biscardi (high jump), Kellen Lewis (400 meter dash). Jeff Mensch (discus) and Mike Schubert (hammer throw). The Irish now have 15 athletes headed to Storrs, Conn. for the Big East meet. 
"I think as long as we stay healthy, we have a good chance of winning the Big East," Irish sprinter Okechi Ogbuokiri said. 
Along with Mensch and 

Schubert, the Notre Dame throwers were able to domi­nate their competition, collnd­ing 39 points on tho mPn 's side and 27 for the women. 
Sophomore Kyle Annen eon­tinued his success with his sec­ond consecutive win in the hammer throw with a distance of 53.42 meters. 
"lie is really focusing on his form a lot recently, and his body awareness is getting bet­ter as he continues to take more throws." Mensch said. 
While Garet Koxlien's throw was about three meters short­er, it was enough to land him third place. Koxlien blew away the competition in the discus event, out-hurling the second place finisher by nearly four meters. His mark of 50.39 lert him just short of the 51.70 meters needed to qualify for the national meet in May. 
Freshman Anna Weber post­ed second and third-place fin­ishes in the shot put and ham­mer throw for the Notre Dame women. Her distances 
improved hnr standing in tlw Big East in both events. placing hnr firth overall in the shot put. 
Other winners for the Irish ineludnd Hyan Postel and Maryann Erigha, who both fin­ished first in the 200-metnr races. The sprinters have now captured tlunn individual titles in tho outdoor season. Erigha's time of 24.05 seconds tied her personal best set at the Cal Poly Invitational on March IS. 
"Arter Coach gave us the last weekend oiT, wo were both pretty fresh. IErighal ran pret­ty well," said Ogbuokiri, who finished third overall in the same race. 
With loss than a month until the trip to Connectirut for the Big East Championships, the Irish will attempt to stay on top of their game in order to com­plete track's triple crown by winning championships in cross country, indoor and out­door track.

MEN'S lACROSSE 
Karweck, Notre Dame hold off Butler rally 
Irish attack scored two late goals to seal win 
By TIM DOUGHERTY Sports Writer 
Notre Dame senior attackman Matt Karweck scored the game­winning goal with 4:16 remain­ing Saturday against Butler to give the team a 9-8 victory in its Great Western Lacrosse League (GWLL) opener in Indianapolis. 
Karweck assisted on Notre Dame's first goal to senior mid­fielder Matt Ryan early in the second quarter to cut the B u IIdog's lead to 2-1. lie later scored two of the team's last three goals, including the game­winner on a rebound from Ryan's shot that ricocheted ofT Butler goalie Ryan Kaiser. 
While Notre Dame (7-2, 1-0 in the GWLL) won the game, Irish head coach Kevin Corrigan said the team will need to improve its consistency in order to win games as the season progresses. 
"We played well at times, but we didn't relentlessly execute like we needed to," Corrigan said. "In the end, we were able to gather our poise and play hard down the stretch and pull out a win when we needed to. But I'd like to see us play more consistently than we have been over the full 40 minutes." 
Corrigan said Butler's game plan was to control the clock and try to limit Irish posses­sions. 
"It was clear from their begin­ning what they were going to do," Corrigan said. "Their game plan was to take the ball behind the goal, slow the game down, limit the number of possessions and be in it till the end." 
The Bulldogs successfully held the Irish to four first quarter possessions en route to a 2-0 advantage. After Ryan's goal, Butler responded a few minutes later. Bulldog Adam Wade beat Notre Dame goalie Joey Kemp to push Butler's advantage back to two goals. 
The Bulldogs appeared to hold a 3-1 lead into halftime, but after a quick turnover with a more than a minute remaining, the Irish attack moved into the Butler zone. 
Notre Dame fired three late shots that missed their mark before junior midfielder Bill Liva found senior attackman Pat Walsh for a goal with 54 sec­onds remaining. Walsh scored again with 1.4 seconds left in the half on an assist from soph­omore midfielder Michael Podgajny to knot the game at three apiece. 
Podgajny and freshman attackman Peter Christman led the team with two assists each. Walsh finished the day with one 
assist and three goals ­ his first  
hat trick of the year  - to lead  
all scorers.  
Senior  attackman  Brian  

Hubschmann also extended his team point lead (27) with a goal 
(17) and an assist (1 0), Bill Liva scored his fifth goal of the sea­son and freshman attackman Ryan Hoff added his tenth. 
Butler's offense -ranked out­side the top 50 in the country ­kept chipping away at the N~. 10 Irish scoring defense, match­ing Irish scoring runs and tying the contest at 8-8 with 5:48 left Karweck's the final punch. 
"It came down to a lucky shot on a lucky rebound," Karweck said. "If it wasn't for our face­off play and our defense, we wouldn't have been in the game at all. We've got to give a lot of credit to our defense. They played their [tails] off." 
Notre Dame sophomore 

Taylor Clagett returned to the face-off circle for the Irish after missing four games with an injured shoulder. 
"He's back, and he's on the field, and he's playing for us," Corrigan said. "He's got a little bit of a problem with his shoul­der, but he did a heck of a job yesterday, and he's going to be an important guy for us out in Colorado." 
Kemp -ranked eighth in the nation with a .623 save percent­age -stopped his lOth Butler shot with 2:56 remaining before Driscoll picked up a groundball with 21 seconds remaining to seal the league victory. 
Notre Dame co-captain brew Peters said the defense -a unit with a season-long .690 clear percentage that allowed .783 to Butler -needs to improve before next weekend's trip to Colorado to face Denver and Air Force. 
"There were little [fundamen­tal] things we didn't do right throughout the game, and they also worked hard for the goals they got," Peters said. "If we just played a more solid funda­mental game like we're capable of doing, that might limit their goals." 
Corrigan said the Irish need to find consistency on both sides of the game, but he was pleased with Notre Dame's ability to grind out another win when they weren't playing to their best ability. 
"It was really our execution that was lacking, and we have to do better -whether that's being more tough minded or more disciplined, we have to do it," Corrigan said. "But we had every opportunity to fold up and not make plays, but that's not what we did. It was a tie game in the fourth quarter, and we had to make plays at the end, and we did that." 
Peters·said he was proud to see the Irish perform when they really needed to. 
"Butler is a much improved game from years before, and we really wanted to get a 'W' to start our league games," Peters said. "We got the 'W' and that's what we came for." 
Notre Dame will play at Denver at 7:30 p.m Friday and then head to Colorado Springs to face Air Force at 2.p.m. Sunday.

"Sheeva just kept getting him­self out of trouble, he bent but he did not break, and he refused to give in when he was down," Bayliss said. "His willingness to always meet any deficit seemed to be the difference in that match." 
The Irish have been able to come together and win close matches after a three-match skid. 
"I think the schedule has toughened us and I've seen team go both ways on that," Bayliss said. "You can take hits and after a while your confidence erodes and you're not as good, but if you have the resolve to back it up you will really benefit from the level of competition you're seeing, and I think that's what we've done." 
The team dedicated its match to Keckley, and Notre Dame vis­ited him at the health eenter after the win. lie is expected to play on Thursday when the team takes on Louisville in its final match of the regular sea­son. 
"To win without Hyan the way wn did, I think gives me a lot of optimism about the postseason," Bayliss said.

this week, and it definitely paid ofT," Vinny captain Andrew Nesi said. 
Ridiculousness-ness wanted to. have a strong showing in its first game of the tournament, hoping the team's fresher legs would carry it to victory. Brutoco was able to get his team ready for this game, especially on defense as Ridiculousness-ness forced turnovers and rebounded well against the taller Team Vmny. 
"We came out in the first half and had no fear," Brutco said. "We defmitely lost some momentum in the second half, but we all con­tributed some today." 
Neither team put up a consistent offensive performance Sunday as each relied on sesond or third chance opportunities before they could score. While Team Vinny split the load on offense, Brutoco shouldered much of the responsi­bility for his team. His determined drives to the hoop and great ball­handling skills kept his team close before Vinny was able to pull ahead for the win in the second half. 
Although this year's tournament was one-and-done for Ridiculousness-ness, Team Vmny advances to play We Shoot like Dick Cheney (you better wear orange) in the next round. 
Team 75 21 Out Side Irish Rugby Club 10 
Team 7 5 captain and point guard Matt Haggerty led his team to victory Sunday against the Out Side Irish Rugby Club, directing the offense while making sure the team was ready to defend when they lost the ball. 
Both teams came out with defensive mindsets, hoping to con­tain their opponent. Unfortunately for the Rugby Club, its size limited it;; defensive effectiveness as Team 75 was able to win most rebounds during the game, giving it many put-back opportunities. 
The Rugby Club was able to get some turnovers Sunday, but it could not do too much against the stingy Team 75 defense. 
"I think we played really tight defense out there today," Haggerty said. "We got tons of rebounds, and they gave us a really good chance to win." 
The Rugby Oub did not go down without a fight, nailing long-range jump shots and running a success-ful fast break on multiple occa­sions to keep the score close for much of the first half. 

"We did a lot better than I expected," Rugby Club captain Alex Barnes said. "We played real­ly good defense and scored a lot more points than anyone would have thought." 
The Tournament is named after us, so we have to have a Team 21, Tree Hill Ravens 8 
Home court advantage is impor­tant, especially when you host the biggest outdoor five-on-five full court tournament in the world. 
Despite living farther away from the Bookstore than residents of every dorm besides Carroll, The Tournament is named after us, so we have to have a Team (Hammes) -consisting of five Bookstore employees from the South Bend area -cemented its legitimate claim to the paved domain of the Bookstore courts with a sound defeat of the Ravens. 
Hammes' ostentatious di'iplay of offensive dominance opened up a 13-1 lead over Tree Hill. Though the "L. Scott" and "N. Scott" on the Ravens' jerseys implied they had played together for three seasons on the WB hit show "One Tree Hill," they suffered from commu­nication gaffs and committed cost­ly turnovers, as Hammes picked their pockets and cashed the steals in for points in transition. 
Hammes, led by Matthew Kroll's 11 points, towered over Tree Hill for uncontested baskets, establish­ing a monopoly on first-half points. 
Head Raven cheerleader/player Corey Calabrese urged her team to continue to "be aggressive, be be aggressive," while leading by example with her pavement­pounding hustle. 
As a result of their tenacity, the Ravens received a scare when Lesley Greene tumbled to the blacktop, knocked her head against the hard surface and was forced to sit out the rest of the game. 
Hammes graciously sent off one of its own players in a show of altruism comparable to the Bookstore's Student Appreciation Sale -befitting in a friendly game that heard almost as many apolo­gies as renditions of Gavin DeGraw's "I Don't Want To Be," which blared out of iPod speakers stuck on repeat for the entire game. 
Regardless, the Poe-etically named Ravens, inspired by their "lost Lenore," elevated their game and clawed their way to a 7-6 run to make it 20-8 on the wings of Mark "Romeo Casanova" Venner's five points. But Kroll clipped their comeback by sinking Hammes' decisive 21st point. 
Scored the Ravens, nevermore. "We made a valiant effort in the comeback," Casanova said. 
Hammes profited from superior athleticism, even though it was every player's first Bookstore experience. 
"I like the carnival aspect of it­dressing up in funny costumes in the early rounds," Kroll said. "But as the tournament goes on, we're looking forward to good competi­tion." 
Kroll said they hope to match the run made by a Bookstore employee team several years ago and protect their home court by making it to the round of 64. 
Until then, Hammes, ever gam­ing, still is claiming, still is claim­ing the pallid court of concrete just outside the Bookstore doors. 
B3 Bailers 21, Baller-inas 17 
The Porn Squad has spirit yes they do, they got spirit and tutus, too. But both flair and style could not impede the B3 Bailers' raw ability to make an orange, leather ball go through an iron circle, and fiye Porn Squad stars under the name the Baller-inas could not stop the all-male Bailers as the "march of the boys" continued with a 21-17 victory Saturday. 
The Bailers, led by Art Shelly's three early buckets, stormed out to an 8-0 lead against the Baller­inas. But the Baller-inas eventual­ly adapted their hardwood moves to the outdoor surface, as their first basket by point guard Siobhan Lezynski sparked a 4-0 run, leading one baffled Ballerina to chide, "You guys only have eight!" 
After taking a seemingly com­fortable 13-6 lead, the Bailers instituted the "no dribble offense" to try to slow the tempo, but junior Lindsey Ball used a slightly modi­fied pirouette to boogie the ball handler into disarray. 
With her team down 17-10, sen­ior Kelli Delay led a -true to her name -late Baller-ina run, scor­ing a team-high six points and prompting Ball to declare her "MVP, or whatever they call it in basketball!" 
Blair Minarik eventually turned near-makes into successful field goals, and Kristen Forney's jumper from the block brought the count to 20-17. 
But the Bailers finally made a shot from behind their self­imposed boundary -the three­point line -to end a game length­ened by the Bailers' insistence on alley-oops and chivalric refusal to rebound. 
One spectator -speaking on the condition of anonymity -sug­gested the Bailers lengthened the game because it was the only time they'd ever been around that many pretty girls at once. 
Despite Balls' visionary defen­sive strategy, the Baller-ina's zone defense's inability to stop the Bailers' attack proved fatal. 
"We tried to find the zone, but we couldn't find it," Baller-ina captain Adrienne Larson said. 
But after the loss, the Baller-inas held their heads high, proud of their effort. 
"People said I was a ball hog, but I wasn't," Lezynski said. "I assisted a lot. I made my family proud."

Blue Barracudas stop cinderella tean1' s run 
By GREG ARBOGAST and 
JOE QUINN 
Spores Writers 

We Always Make it to Oregon Before You's cinderella run came to a screeching halt Sunday as it fell to the Blue Barracudas 21-3. 
We Always Make it to Oregon Before You (Oregon) had the look of an underdog as the squad appeared to have two pioneer women, one cowgirl and an ox to go along with its one actual bas­ketball player. 
"I think we're like George Mason," Oregon coaches Meghan Whealan and Corinne Viglietta said. "We came out of nowhere and surprised a lot of people with a win in our first game." 
But the Blue Barracudas were in no mood to. let their opponent advance further in the tourna­ment. The Blue Barracudas were led by their duo from Keenan room 414, Evan Sharpley and Pat Sceehan. Employing the "cherry­picker" style offense, Sharpley and Sceehan accounted for 19 of the team's 21 points. 
After reflecting on his team's accomplishment of beating the so­called "George Mason" of this year's tournament, Barracuda coach Pat Ryan saw good things in his team's future. 
"I guess that makes us like Florida, because we like to stomp on Cinderella," Ryan said. ''I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank our team's sponsor, Speaker City, for their support as well as all their quality products." 
Los Pantelones Del Cristo 21, Mama's Boys 17 
In a game where seven turnovers were committed before the first basket, Los Pantelones Del Cristo won a war of attrition over the Mama's Boys Saturday. 
The game lasted just over an . hour and tested each team's stam­ina. 
"That was the longest game of my life," Los Pantelones Del Cristo player Joe Blakely said. 
Despite the duration of the game, the two teams played each other very closely. Neither team led by more than four points; and the game featured six ties and three lead changes. 
Andrew Winslow hit a jump shot to tie the game at 14-14, but that was as close as the Mama's Boys would get. 
Nick Catella ignited Los Pantelones del Cristo's offense all day (eight points) despite his team's even scoring distribution. When he wasn:t scoring, he was creating offensive opportunities for his teammates. 
"We really executed our game plan today, which was to draw the game out as long as possible and wear our opponents down," Catella said. 
The Saints of Fort Washington 21, Age Before Beauty 9 
The Saints of Fort Washington, equipped with trash bags for jer­seys, used their youth and athleti­cism to outlast the older, wiser but considerably more "aerodynamic" counterpart, Age Before Beauty Saturday. 
Both squads struggled to find their rhythm early in the game as both teams -after making an early shot -went scoreless on their next five possessions. After a quick steal and lay-up by Saints -· captain Nick Trapp, the Saints offense started to click. 
Leading 11-5 at half time, the Saints continued to stay hot while the members of Age Before Beauty could find no room on the offensive side of the ball, starting out 0-of-10 in the second half. 
"It was hard for us," Age cap­tain Dillon Murphy said. "None of the guys have played a lot since we retired from professional ball, and it showed this afternoon." 
The Saints continued to use a seemingly unstoppable offense and a defense with few holes to cruise to a 21-9 victory. 
"I think it was our pre-game warm-up and the benefit of hav­ing an excellent captain allowed us to prevail today," Trapp said. 
No Rudy No Problem 21, Point Shavers3 
When No Rudy No Problem took on the Point Shavers Saturday afternoon, the game was over before it started. The more athletic, experienced and talented No Rudy No Problem defeated the Point Shavers in a rout. 
No Rudy started the scoring early and never really stopped. They quickly opened up a com­manding lead, and it was clear the Point Shavers were no match for them. Unable to do anything on the offensive side of the ball, the Point Shavers were forced to take ill-advised three-point shots that rarely came close to going in. 
On the other end of the court, No Rudy No Problem toyed with the smaller Point Shavers en route to an 11-0 half time lead. Inside or outside, No Rudy No Problem sim­ply could not be stopped. 
"We're very underrated," No Rudy No Problem captain Trey Patrick said. "I think we showed that today."

Duke 
continued from page 24 
Waagbo responded with two goals to tie the game at 3-3. 
During the rest of the l'irst half, the Irish held the Blue Devils to one goal, while net­ting three more of their own. Sophomore attack Heather F11rguson put the Irish in front, beating Duke goalie Mngan Huether with just under 15 minutes remaining in the first half. 
After Duke's Waagbo knot­ted tlw seore at 4-4 on a free position shot four minutes later, Ferguson struek again, tallying her seeond goal of the afternoon. 
The Irish advantage grew to a pair with six minutes remaining in the first half when Irish standout attack Crysti Foote picked up her seeond of four goals. 
The Irish went into halftime eonfident with a 6-4 lead ­thn first time during the 2006 season that Duke has trailed at halftime. 
While Notre Dame seemed poised to upset the favored Blue Devils on their own turf, the second half wasn't nearly as kind to the Irish. 
Duke didn't waste much time getting back into the eontest, as only 10 seconds into the second half, Duke midfielder Carolyn Davis notched a breakaway, unas­sisted goal. Caroline Cryer continued Duke's offensive assault with a goal 34 seconds later. 
Notre Dame quickly regained the lead with two 

goals by freshman midfielder .Jill Byers and Foote, respec­tively. 
During the latter part of the second half, the Blue Devil defense rose to the challenge presented by the talented Notre Dame attack. 
For the next 12 minutes, Duke's defenders kept the Irish off the scoreboard. In the meantime, effective offen­sive play on the Blue Devil's part led to a 5-0 run, result­ing in an 11-8 lead. 
While Foote and freshman midfielder Byers were able to tally a goal a piece in the closing minutes of the game, the Irish's late-game drive was too late, and the Blue Devils came away with a win. 
"Duke just happened to be the team up by one goal when the time ran out," Byers said. "I thought we were very well prepared for the game, and it just didn't work out the way we wanted it to." 
In both of its losses this sea­son, Notre Dame has fallen to a team ranked No. 4 or better. Considering the Irish only won three games last season, the pair of losses to top­ranked opponents through 12 games is a marked improve­ment. 
Irish goalie Carol Dixon recorded a career-high 18 saves in the loss. Foote added to her total for the year with four more goals. 
Foote's four tallies on Wednesday against Ohio State gave her 182 goals, making her Notre Dame's all-time leading scorer.

"Early on we spent a lot of time indoors," the senior said. "Now we get to play outside every day, and we're hitting our stride." 
Notre Dame 9, South Florida 6 
Notre Dame right-hander Jeff Samardzija struggled early Friday, allowing three runs in the bottom of the first, but recovered to pitch 5 and 2/3 innings, allowing six runs on six hits and picking up the win. 
"I have to go back to funda­mentals during the week," Samardzija said of his perform­ance. "There are some things I need to correct, but it shouldn't be too hard to fix them." 
Mainieri said he had confi­dence in Samardzija, who also struggled early in his last start on March 29 against Pittsburgh. 
"By some people's standards, they might see that as strug­gling, but I see it as just him set­tling down," Mainieri said. "A lesser person might give up 

Cooper and Lilley to put the Bulls away early Saturday. 
Notre Dame scored seven runs in the fifth to take a 9-1 lead and put the game out of reach. The Bulls scored three in the eighth, but a run in the top of the ninth pushed the Irish lead back to six. 
Senior left-hander Tom Thornton started the game for Notre Dame, allowing just one run in six innings and earning the win. 
Mainieri started freshman Jeremy Barnes at second base, inserting regular second base­man Ross Brezovsky into the lineup at designated hitter. Barnes went 1-for-4 at the plate with a run scored and two HBis. 
"Jeremy Barnes is one of our best infielders, but Brezovsky, Lilley, and [senior shortstop Greg] Lopez are all returning players and good infielders," Mainieri said of his decision. ''I'm just trying to keep everyone fresh and healthy and give them experience so if we do have an injury, it won't hurt us as mueh." 
Notre Dame 10 
South Florida 1 
Notre Dame right-hander Jeff Manship and South Florida left­hander Davis Bilardello were locked in a pitchers dual through five innings Sunday when the Irish exploded to take a commanding lead. 
Already leading 2-1, the Irish scored five runs in the sixth and three more in the seventh to provide the final margin. Barnes, starting at shortstop with Lopez moved to designated hitter, led the Irish otTensively. He went 4-for-5 with two HBis and two runs scored. 

Manship pitched eight com­plete innings, allowing one run on four hits for his fourth win of the season. 
Notre Dame will play Oakland and Manchester Tuesday and Wednesday at home before three games with St. .John's at Frank Eck Stadium over Easter break. The Irish and Hed Storm will play a doubleheader Thursday and a game Saturday. 
"Obviously, we can't overlook our midweek opponents, because they could jump up and bite us in the butt, but St. John's will be a big series," Cooper said. "They're one of the top teams in the Big East." 
The Oakland and Manchester games will be at 5:05 p.m. The Thursday doubleheader at St. Johns will be at 12:05 p.m., and the Saturday game against the Red Storm will begin at 12:05 p.m.

Tea111 shuts out visiting Marquette, DePaul 
By DAN TAPETILLO 
Sports Writer 
The Irish closed out their regular season the same way they started -with a pair of shutouts. 
No. 2 Notre Dame earned its ninth and tenth 7-0 victories with wins over DePaul and Marquette this weekend at the Courtney Tennis Center. 
Junior Christian Thompson attributed the wins to team members' dedication to each other. 
"Our team is led by a strong tradition and the best friend­ships," she said. "We have per­formed well as a team all sea­son and have not been focusing on personal achievements. [Two consecutive shutouts] was a great way to finish the regular season [heading into the Big East Tournament]." 
In their match against Marquette Sunday, the Irish managed the impressive win 


without their No. 1 singles and doubles player Catrina Thompson. 
"She is someone the team 
·greatly admires," freshman Katie Potts said. "So we had to really focus [against Marquette]."

Cooper, Lilley spark a series s-weep of Bulls 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Sports Ediwr 
Notre Damn first baseman Craig Cooper and third baseman Brett Lilley keyed an offensive nxplosion as the Irish swept South Florida 9-6, 10-4 and 10-1 in a thren-game snries this week­end in Tampa, Florida. 
Cooper and Lilley wero a com­bined 9-for-13 at the plato, scor­ing 11 runs and striking out only once in 31 combined plate appearances. 
Notre Dame coaeh Paul Mainieri also praised Lilley's strong play in the field. 
"Lilley was unbnlievable," Mainieri said. "Obviously he hit well, but he also made three div­ing eatehes. I think they would have been on ESPN's Web Gems." 
Cooper, who has batted at the top of the order most of the year, raised his batting average to a team-leading .429 for the season. 
"lie's been a great lead-off hit­ter for us, just like I envisioned he would be," Mainieri said. 
As a team, Notre Dame batted .409 and got 49 hits in the series. The Bulls, who dropped to 14-19 overall at 5-7 in the Big East, hit only .231. 
The Irish, who started the sea­son 2-5, are now 22-8 overall (8­1 in the Big East). Their league record sits them at the top of the Big East standings in a first-place tie with St. John's. 
Notre Dame is also in the midst of a 12-game winning streak dat­

Irish rally to defeat SMU, 5-2 
By KATE GALES Associate Sports Editor 
Saturday was more of the same for No. 17 Notre Dame as it maintained its perfect home record with a 5-2 win 
over  Southern  Methodist  
University.  
Notre  Dame  took  five  

straight points falling behind 2-0, and improved to 14-7 with the victory. 
"We expected a tough match," Notre Dame coach Bobby Bayliss said. "It was a tough match. We were able to win the dose matches and that was the difference." 
The team has struggled in doubles this season, and los­ing Ryan Keckley -the team's best doubles player­to illness made it tougher. 
"We've kind of done a full court press as far as our dou­bles lately, evaluating where we are, and we're not wor­ried as much about the com­binations," Bayliss said. "It's about everyone developing better skills." 
Notre Dame junior Barry King and senior Eric Langenkamp won 8-4 at first
