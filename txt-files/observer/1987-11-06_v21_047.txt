Cooke evaluates new SB mayor 
By ERIC M. BERGAMO Senior Staff Reporter 
Student Body President Pat Cooke hopes new South Bend Mayor Joe Kernan, a 1964 Notre Dame graduate, will be more "sensitive" to the problems of off-campus students and help improve relations between stu­dents and the community. 
"Just because he has spent such a long time in this envi­ronment with Notre Dame and South Bend that he will be more sensitive to the problems that exsist within the communities and hopefully, together we can 
Kevin Hurley visits campus, meets officials 

By MICHELLE DALL News Staff 
Kevin Hurley, after two years of extensive physical rehabilitation and speech therapy, is visiting Notre Dame, where he was seriously injured in a car ac­cident in 1985. According to Celeste Hurley, Kevin's mother, Kevin's bodily in­juries are "pretty much repaired, due to reconstruc­tive surgery. " He is now able to walk with the use of a cane, but Hurley explains, "His balance is still not that

come up with some resolu­tions," Cooke said. 
Kernan, the Democratic mayor-elect, tallied 17,030 votes or 53 percent, defeating Republican Carl Baxmeyer, who garnered 15,104 votes or 47 percent. 
Kernan will replace incum­bent Mayor Roger Parent, who is retiring from the office after two terms. 
Cooke said he hopes that re­lations with Kernan will be as cordial as they were with Par­ent. 
"What we want is within the next week or so is set up a meeting with (Kernan) and dis­cuss how (the students) can contribute to the South Bend community and enhance our relations," Cooke said. 
Democrat Sean Coleman, a 1978 Notre Dame graduate, won one of the three at-large council seats with 19,269 votes. Coleman, who proposed an eight-point plan for better Notre Dame-South Bend rela­tions during his campaign, has not contacted Cooke about the plan.

Hare Krishnas dupe students 
By SCOTT BEARBY Assistant News Editor 
Campus View residents donating money to people knocking at their doors the past two weekends thought they were contributing to Notre Dame's Appalachian service projects. They were wrong. 
Instead, their contributions were going to the International Society for Krishna Concious­ness (ISKCON). 
Under the ISKCON name of "Appalachian Projects," indi­viduals have twice visited the Campus View apartments soliciting funds in exchange for stickers and University of Notre Dame hats. Door-to-door campaigns were conducted the weekend of Sept. 25 and this past Saturday, according to residents of the apartment complex. 
ISKCON members, affiliated with a Hare Krishna sect in Moundsville, West Virginia, have also been soliciting il­legally during Notre Dame football games for the past few years, according to Rex Rakow, director of Security at Notre Dame. 

Involved in legal cases ran­ging from murder and arson to fraud, the Moundsville sect has been implicated in copyright infringement of major league sports teams, Charles Schultz Peanuts' characters and major universities, including Notre Dame, according to the Wheel­ing (WVA) Register. 
"I'm going to have to issue you a citation for having too much fun," was one of the opening lines ISKCON solicitors used when speaking to the Campus View students. Senior Edward Starinchak said after issuing the citation and asking him to "pay his fine," the individual, dressed in reg­ular street clothes, identified

Band may be 'bowl-bound' with the Irish 
By JIM WINKLER Staff Reporter 
If Notre Dame's football team plays in a post-season bowl game, which now appears likely, the Notre Dame March­ing Band should be bowl-bound as well, said Father William Beauchamp, executive vice­president of the University. 
Beauchamp said, "It's a matter of finances. If the bowl we go to pays enough to send the band without losing money, we will send the band." Beau­champ pointed out that in 1984 the Irish played SMU in the Aloha Bowl in Hawaii and the band did not go. "We figured that it would cost more than $240,000 to send the band to Hawaii. We just about broke even sending the people we did." 
Beauchamp indicated that any game other than the Aloha Bowl could possibly pay enough to send the band. In 1983, the Irish played in a minor bowl game, the Liberty Bowl, in Memphis and the band did go. 
As far as any major bowl game is concerned, Father Beauchamp said, "Put it this way. If we are playing on Jan. 1, the band will be there." That could take the Irish as far away as Miami, Dallas, New Or­leans, or Tempe. However, New Year's Day bowls generate a significantly greater amount of money for participating teams than the "minor" bowls do. This would allow the University to send the marching band. 
The cost of sending the band to a bowl, as Beauchamp indi­cated, is covered by bowl rev­enue. It is up to the band to make travel arrangements, said Father Beauchamp. The cost of the trip would depend on the city traveled to, the hotel accomadations, and whether or not the band charters a plane. Beauchamp also said that in the event of a bowl game during Christmas break, the band would have to decide whe­ther to fly members to South Bend or straight to the bowl city. 

As far as the band's plans go, said Band Director Luther Snavely, nothing has been laid out just yet. "We are just working on this week's game right now." Snavely indicated that as the fate of Notre Dame's football team becomes 
more  apparent,  the  band's  
plans  will  come  together  as  
well.  

"It's up to the football team right now," Snavely said. If Notre Dame does make it to a bowl game with the band ac­companying them, then Snavely will work out a finan­cial plan, as well as a musical one.

Krishna fundraising can be hair-raising 
Question: Which of the following are Hare Krishnas? 
A) Happy, if misguided, souls who shave their heads, wear orange robes and dance and chant in airports. 
B) Pleasant, clean-cut young men and women who approach you at concerts, fairs, shopping centers or football games in order to solicit money for such charities as Meals-on-Wheels, Catholic Charities International, March-of­Dimes and the Appalachian Project. 
Answer: Both. 
Unfortunately, most people only think of Hare Krishnas as the former. If they realized that the "volunteer" who gives them a hat or a sticker and says, "I'm going to have to give you a citation for not having enough fun" is a member of a religious cult and probably has no connection to any legitimate charity, they might not be so inclined to give their money away. 
If they knew that members of the Interna­tional Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) have been implicated in drug-smuggling, insurance fraud, and that one of their gurus in Berkeley, Calif. was arrested for possession of drugs and automatic weapons they might not find the Krishnas quite so harm­less. 
In fact, the more you learn about the Hare Krishnas and their methods of fundraising, the less attractive they seem. 
The Krishna movement began in the United States in 1965 when a Hindu monk, Bhak­tivedanta Swami Prabhupada, arrived in New York from India after a two-month voyage on a steamship. Bhaktivedanta, or Srila Prab­hupada, as he is called by his followers, pre­sented a form of religion, which because of its rejection of materialism and worldliness in fa­vor of spirituality, was enthusiastically received by the American counter-culture of the 60s and 70s. 
To help overcome the stigma attached to their appearance, ISKCON members began to dis­
guise themselves while soliciting funds for the religion. In 1973, they began wearing conven­tional clothes to conceal their true identities. Now when soliciting funds the women wear dresses; the men wear wigs. 
The Krishnas also became more aggressive i~ their fundraising activities and began a prac­bee they call "picking." Picking involves the production of nonreligious articles such as pins,

oriental art, American flags, stickers and 
clothes to give to "Karmis" (an pejorative term 
defining meat-eating outsiders) in exchange for 
donations. Picking also involves deliberately 
posing as a volunteer for the needy in order to 
make the unwary believe they are giving to a 
real charity. 

The Krishnas, however, feel that their decep­tion is justified. 
In his book, Hare Krishna in America, E. Burke Rochford quotes a member of ISKCON, "The money that people give, even if they do feel tricked, helps them spiritually. What would they do with the money anyway? They would spend it on some sense gratification, right? So we are actually rendering these people a special service, even though they may be so foolish that they can't recognize it." 
I for one have a tendency to dislike those who try to trick me. The next time someone gives me a sticker or hat and then demands money, I'm going to keep the sticker. If he presses me for a donation, I'll offer him a ham sandwich 
or a new wig. By the way, during the Christmas holidays Hare Krishnas dress like Santa Claus. Ho, ho, ho.

Wreckage confirms death of university officials 
Associated Press 
BELLINGHAM, Wash. -The wreckage of a light plane car­rying three top officials of Western Washington Univer­sity was spotted at dusk Thursday after a daylong search, a Whatcom County Emergency Services spokes­man said. 
All four people aboard the plane, including the pilot, were killed, said spokesman Bill Quehrn. 
The plane crashed about eight miles northwest of Bellin­gham International Airport and one mile from Bellingham Bay. 
The badly damaged Cessna 310 was found in a densely wooded spot in an industrial area near Lake Terrell, north of the city, where crews had searched earlier in the day, Quehrn said. There was no evidence of a fire. 
Whatcom County sheriff's of­ficers cordoned off the area and planned to photograph and videotape the scene, he said. 
National Transportation Safety Board investigators were expected Friday morning to began probing the cause of the crash, Quehrn said. 
The plane disappeared after being cleared to land at the air­port Wednesday night. 
Listed as passengers on the plane were G. Robert Ross, 59, president of Western Washing­ton University; Jeanene DeLille, 38, WWU vice presi­dent for university advance­ment; and Don Cole, 50, univer­sity vice president for business and financial affairs. 
Ross was dean of students at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., from 1959 to 1962. 
The craft was flown by pilot Ty Hardin, who was returning the three college officials from Tacoma, 110 miles to the south, where they had addressed a gathering of WWU alumni. 
Some 100 ground searchers and seven to 10 light planes and helicopters had searched a 160­square-mile area Thursday. 
The search area extended roughly from Lummi Island off Bellingham, north to Point Whitehorn, east to Lynden and south along the Cascade foot­hills. 
An initial search for the twin­engine craft began late Wed­nesday when the plane was cleared for a Bellingham lan­ding by a control tower in Van­couver, British Columbia, which subsequently lost radar contact with the plane. 
Larry Hammaker, chief operating pilot for Cascade Flight School in Bellingham, said the six-seat plane was owned by the flight school but that Hardin was an experi­enced pilot with Horizon Air­lines who flew for Cascade 

Quehrn said earlier the Van­couver tower had the Cessna on radar during its landing ap­proach out of the northeast and recorded another radar blip at the south end of the field. 
Quehrn said the Vancouver tower also picked up a garbled transmission at the time but that the source of the transmis­sion was not known. 
Standard procedures at Bel­lingham's airfield are for planes which overshoot the runway on a landing attempt to circle over Bellingham Bay and make a new approach from the north. 
The airport is on the shore of the bay.

ND symposium focuses on stock market 
NYSE chairman's keyno1te to highlight investment ethics series 
ByKIMBERLYTRENNER Senior Staff Reporter 
John Phelan Jr., chairman of the board of the New York Stock exchange, will be among the Wall Street leaders meeting with prominent theologians and academicians next Mon­day through Wednesday at Notre Dame for a public dis­cussion titled "Ethics in the In­vestment Industry.'' 
"While much has been writ­ten in recent months about the misdeeds of actors in the in­vestment community, and sug­gestions for new legislation ap­pear daily, the Notre Dame conference will move beyond the headlines and explore the ethical vision and institutional bonding that form the basis for a humane capitalism," said Notre Dame's Associate Provost Father Oliver Wil-Iiams, one of the conference conveners. 
The timeliness of the reeent crash of the stock market and the symposium are "absolutely coincidental. We have been planning the symposium for al­most a year," Williams said. 
"The crash gives focus to the whole question of invest­ments," said Williams. "A lot of people (at the symposium) will indirectly address what happened," he said. 
"There is no question that the (recent crash) has piqued in­terest in the symposium," Wil­liams said. Local newspapers had many questions and showed such a strong interest in the symposium that a press conference with Phelan willl be held Monday, Nov. 9, Williams said. 
"We are bringing top people together for a few days to dis­cuss what has gone awry or wrong and what has to be remedied (in the investment system)," Williams said. 
"We wanted to bring to­gether top experts from Wall Street with some top ethics people in the country because many of them have questions about the ethics in the indus­try," Williams added. 
"They have questions be­cause people make so much money so quickly, Williams said. "Most people think one million is a lot ; we are talking about figures like twenty mil­lion," he said. 
Williams said the sympo­sium has several goals. "The symposium is designed to dis­cuss how Judea-Christian and ethical values affect the finan­cial world," said Williams. "We see our mission at Notre Dame not only to teach stu­dents the best intellectual skills but we also hope to teach stu­dents ethical and moral values," he said. 
The symposium will take place during a period of three days and is divided into ten ses­sions. Some of the highlights from the first day include "The Insider Trading Scandal," in which economists will explain issues in the investment indus­try from an economic view­point. The keynote address by Phelan will also occur that day. 
''The keynote address will be an overview of how we can look at the whole investment indus­try in society and at how invest­ments have an important role in society," said Williams. 
The ethics of takeovers will be the subject of discussion in "The Wall Street Ethos," on the second day of the sympo­sium. Paul Tierney, a Notre Dame graduate, will be one of the speakers. 
"Tierney is a master of 
akeovers," said Williams. "He will explain how takeovers lc>ontribute to more efficient in­kiustry and how they achieve !more good (in society)," Wil­
iams said. 



Other topics included in the symposium are "God and Wall Street," in which Donald Shriver Jr., president of the New York Union Theological Seminar will speak, and "Some Legal Aspects," in which Notre Dame law professors G. Robert Blakey and Patricia O'Hara will speak. 
"Some of the discussions will be presented from complemen­tary viewpoints, others from opposing viewpoints," said Williams. All discussions will be held in the auditorium of the Center for Continuing Educa­tion and are open to all Notre Dame faculty and students. 
The symposium's conveners are John Houck, professor of management, Frank Reilly, Bernard J. Hank, professor of business, and Williams. The symposium is sponsored by the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Religious Values in Busi­ness, the College of Business Administration and the Notre Dame Alumni Association's Department of Alumni Con­tinuing Education in coopera­tion with the University's Center for Continuing Educa­tion.

ND prof attributes market crash to traders' fear 
Friday, November 6, 1987 
The Observer 
By PAT HEALY 
News Staff 
The stock market's Oct. 19 crash occurred because of the fears of traders and investors that were triggered by recent political events, said Kevin Scanlonm Notre Dame profes­sor of finance. 
In a lecture Thursday night, Scanlon said the fears which caused the crash were of two categories-fears that had been building up beforehand and recent ones that triggered the market's plummet. 
Scanlon said anxieties such as the fear of inflation, the plunging dollar, the budget def­icit and the trade deficit had been building up in investors' minds. 
A more recent fear that keyed the crash was a legisla­tion in the House of Represen­tatives increasing tax on busi­ness mergers and acquisitions, Scanlon said. The legislation caused panic due to widescale profits made by watching for takeovers and mergers, he said. Stockholders began sell­ing in fear of the new legisla­tion. 
What Scanlon called the real "spark" of the crash was the bombing of inoperative Iranian oil platforms the same day of the crash. 
It was unclear on Wall Street whether the platforms were ac­tive, Scanlon said, adding that unwary investors then began to quickly sell their stocks. 
In an effort to counteract massive selling in the market, middlemen bought up un­wanted stock, Scanlon said. Middlemen then began selling after it was announced the market would close early. 
The disastrous event of the day, according to Scanlon, oc­curred when the Wall Street ticker fell behind by an hour or two due to the largest trading volume in the market's history. 
The buying and selling in dif­ferent markets became un­stable because of the time lapse, resulting in what Scan­lon estimated was a loss of 250 of the 500 points lost that day.

Scanlon said he thinks the crash will not significantly af­fect the University's endow­ment because Notre Dame's in­vestments are diversified. 
He said Notre Dame "weat­hered the storm as well as anyone could'' and there should be no effect on tuition. 
Scanlon said he "doesn't believe we're facing doom" be­cause of the stock market's growth over long time periods. He pointed out that since 1927, the stock market is up 10 per­cent per year average. In com­parison, over the last decade stocks are up 14 percent per year. 

Scanlon said the market averaged a 20 percent increase each year over a five-year per­iod, beginning Aug. 1982. 
This increase has been de­emphasized in newspapers, Scanlon said, adding that he sees the market as still a solid long-term investment. 
Physician speaks against nuclear war 
By KRISTIN COLLIGAN 
News Staff 
Embracing nuclear weapons as a means of defense is a paradox according to Robert Lifton, founding member of Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. 
"Nuclearism is the embrace of the bomb, a destructive force, as a form of salvation." 
Lifton  said  Thursday  night  
during  a  lecture in the Res­ 
burgh  Library  auditorium.  

"The bomb is embraced as a means of defense, security, safety, peace, deterence." 
The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings that ended World War II marked the beginning of an American cultural crisis, Lifton, a member of Notre Dame's Instutitue for Interna­
tional Peace Studies said. "Nuclear fear, consisting of deep anxiety and the fear of fu­

turelessness," he said, " stems from the Hiroshima bomb." 
"Fear that the Soviets would get the bomb was actually a displacement of the overall fear of the bomb itself," he said. 

Lifton said he sees hope in the "principle of species fate" which he said has recently emerged. 
This principle is "a recogni­tion of shared fate," according to Lifton. "In the case of the 
U.S. and the Soviet Union," he said, "it is inconceivable that either society would survive with the disruption of the 
ot~~h~ societies and their leaders are beginning to recog­nize that whatever our ideologies, we are bound up by the same fate," said Lifton. 
Lifton's lecture was the first in a series of three entitled "The Cost of Militarism," ac­cording to the director of the Institute for International Peace Studies, John Gilligan.

The article, which he wrote for fellow scientists, was to have been published by Profes­sor Erich Marx in Leipzig, Ger­many. However, World War I deterred publication. 
"It's the most complete review of relativity he ever wrote," said John Stachel, editor of "The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein," in an interview. "It is the earliest manuscript of an Einstein paper known to be in existence and an extremely long one." 
Einstein promulgated the special relativity theory in 1905. It deals with the relation­ships among space, time, mat­ter and energy, and includes his formula: energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. The theory says the speed of light is constant regardless of whether the source of light is moving. 
His general theory of relativity, which came later, includes gravity. 
The famous equation ap­pears in different forms in the manuscript and at one point is stated with an extra algebraic constant that Einstein later crossed out because he thought it was unnecessary. 
"The manuscript gives valu­able insight into Einstein's thinking," said Dr. Spencer Weart, director of the Center for the History of Physics of the American Institute of Physics. "You see him groping around towards a general theory of relativity in the manuscript." 
"In many respects, it's ex­traordinary," said David Red­den, Sotheby's senior vice pres­ident in charge of rare books and manuscripts. "It is ex­tremely difficult to estimate (the value of) something like this because nothing is compa­rable.

Alternative site sou~ght to house final pep rallies 
By PATRICK O'CONNOR Staff Reporter 
Tonight's pep rally for the Boston College game will be held at the traditional Stepan Center loction, but this year's final rally for the Alabama game may be held at a new site. 
The Office of Student Activi­ties confirmed Wednesday that Stepan Center has been reserved by the Pep Rally Committee for the two remain­ing rallies. However, Tim Bud­den, co-chairman of the Pep Rally Committee, said that the possibility exists of holding the Alabama pep rally outdoors on Stepan Courts. 
The poor acoustics, stiffling heat, and inability to adE!­quately accomodate the large crowds associated with pep rallies at Stepan Center are the motives that led the Pep Rally Committee to consider an all­ternative location. 
The main problem involved with holding a pep rally out­doors, besides the uncertainty of the weather, is the sound sys-and other concerned and indoor pep rally site is bleak, tern, said Budden.

himself as a representative of Appalachian Projects. 
Although the ISKCON solicitor never said he was from either of the two Notre Dame Appalachian groups who provide service and funds to the impoverished areas of the Appalachian Mountains, at least some of the students ap­proached said they thought their donation was going to those groups. Senior William Hayes said he donated $5 be­cause he thought the Appalac­hian Projects group soliciting would benefit some of the same programs which Notre Dame works with. 
Lt. Rick Kilgore of the South Bend Police Department said he has not heard of any com­plaints and added that the group must have targeted the Notre Dame area. 
Dorene Muszer, secretary of the Campus View Apartments, said the complex has a no solicitation policy and that they will kick the solicitors out if they come back. Muszer said she has received a few com­plaints about the incident. 
Students said the solicitor 
used the back entrances of the 
apartment breezeways. 
There is no indication of how 
much money was donated to 
ISKCON. 
Rakow said the group uses 
Notre Dame hats and stickers 
as a source of funds for the 
Hare Krishna group to operate. 
He said the group has no au­
thorized vending permit to dis­
tribute these items in exchange 
for donations at football 
games. 
Two members affiliated with 
the Moundsville Hare Krishna 
community were arrested last 
November for trespassing in 
connection with unauthorized 
selling of Notre Dame 
souvenirs. 
Rakow said one man was ar­
rested at last weekend's Navy 
game, but he said he did not 
know whether he was affiliated ~~a~mm~~~mm~~~ 
with ISKCON. In the past, Rakow said ISKCON members have col­lected donations for a boys
school called Nandagram, one of many organizations which operate under the ISKCON umbrella. 
Colleen Prentice, chairper­son of the CILA chapter on campus, said the fundraising by ISKCON has "absolutely nothing to do with our own proj­ects." She said CILA has been working with the Appalachian area for about 10 years and does conduct fundraising, but not for the groups which ISKCON supports. 
"We regret something like this had to happen, people thinking they were donating to a good cause," said Prentice. 
Sue Cunningham, special projects coordinator for the Center for Social Concerns, called the incident "upset­ting." The CSC offers a pro­gram where students travel to Appalachian areas to volunteer their time and learn about the region's problems. 
Cunningham said "not a dime" collected by ISKCON goes to the Appalachian pro­grams in which Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students par­ticipate. 
A representative of the Hare Krishnas in West Virginia defended the programs which 

ISKCON supports. Steve Cris , 
A Hare Krishna sticker bearing the 'Appalachian Projects' sign 
who described himself as fundraising coordinator for ISKCON, said the money goes to feed the needy in a newly established community in West V,irginia through a vegetarian meals on wheels program and to help people establish "true goals" in life. 
Crisp said he could not name the individuals working in the zation reportedly uses the 4,000 acre Hare Krishna facility in West Virginia as a distribution center. 
ISKCON distributes hats and other materials to its followers and in return, the donations col­lected are mailed back to the headquarters. One check, writ­ten by senior W. Daniel Mic­helini to "Appalachian Proj­
ects" was deposited by ISKCON in a local Wheelingbank. 
Rakow said the Hare Krishnas work near all major sporting events and activities. "They come in van loads and spread out everywhere," he 
said. 
Crisp said he apologized if people were confused about where the Appalachian Project donations were going. He said ISKCON workers are advised about the proper way to solicit and do have permission to sell trademarked Notre Dame ma­terials. 
Two companies, Twins En­terprise and Universal, sold the Notre Dame materials to ISKCON, according to Crisp. Assistant General Counsel Pat Lyons said these companies are licensed suppliers for Notre Dame. 
Lyons, however, said ISKCON is being investigated for copyright infringement by federal authoriti~s after they seized a major supply of hats and other materials bearing in­signias of major universities 
and professional sports teams. 

(containing Notre Dame rna­terials) were seized in that raid," she said. 
The Wheeling Register re­ported Jan. 5 and Jan. 22, 1987 raids of business records, sports caps and stickers by federal authorities for viola­tions of federal copy tradmark and importation statutes. 
The Register said the second raid occurred after Hare Krishnas across the country, similar to the individuals working in South Bend, became scared after the first raid and failed to pick up their sports materials. 
Charles Schultz, creator of Peanuts, filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit for damages from the ISKCON use of his Snoopy character, and Major League Baseball has filed a $27 million dollar lawsuit for copyright infringement. 
The Hare Krishnas have claimed that they have not in­fringed upon copyrights be­cause they are a non-profit or­ganization. Also, they claim that they do not sell the mer­chandise, but rather give it away as gifts for donations, said the Register.

Rembrandt dealt with four particular subjects in his art: landscapes, portraits, genre scenes and biblical in­terpretations. Spiro selected the bibli­cal theme because it is the "most force­ful and spiritual." The history of Rembrandt's work shows the figure Jesus as his ideal, and the first portrayal of Jesus with Jewish features. 
Porter said that although Rembrandt is popularly known as a distinct painter, he was also a master of the etching technique. This technique uses metal plates, wax and acid to create more complex effects. 
The Rembrandt exhibition is one of the most treasured at the Snite. Porter said from the 72 extant impressions, the Snite display contains 70, with at least 50 of them qualified as "good or superb" in regards to condition and rarity of states. 
There is no admission charge to the exhibition and the museum hours are Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Sunday, 1 to 4 p.m.; and Thursday, 4 to 8 p.m.

good, so he has to concentrate -which he finds very hard every time a cute girl walks by!" 
Hurley, who is currently par­ticipating in freshman English and finite mathematics at Bos­ton College as a part of a cogni­tive therapy program, had a very traumatic freshman year at Notre Dame. On September 7, 1985, shortly after 3 a.m., Hurley was struck by a hit and run driver on US 31-33, the high­way which separates Notre Dame from St. Mary's. 
Hurley suffered from a frac­tured pelvis, a broken leg, a bruised lung, and multiple head injuries. He also had his lower left leg amputated and suffered from significant memory loss. 
Celeste Hurley says that Kevin's reading ability is still slow, and there is a delay in information, but he hopes to eventually become a full-time college student once again. 
The Hurleys are presently trying to organize a group of Notre Dame alumni and South Bend citizens to promote the building of an overpass over highway US 31-33. They hope to reduce the risk of pedestrians being struck by cars. 
"Even if all students don't utilize the overpass," said Hur­ley, "at least we'll be providing them with an alternative." 
The Hurleys are planning to meet with Notre Dame officials during their stay to discuss the history of similar, past proposals. Hurely said they are 
working on overcoming the stumbling blocks they will surely encounter if the mea­sure is agreed on. Mrs. Hur­ley emphasizes that Kevin is still a staunch Notre Dame fan and will definitely cheer on the Fighting Irish in the upcoming Notre Dame vs. Boston college game.

A rare collection of 70 biblical etchings by 17th century Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijn is currently on dis­play at the Snite Museum of Art. The exhibit presents a complete group of works and will be displayed in the O'Shaughnessy galleries until Jan. 31, 1988. The collection took 10 years to complete and represents almost the en­tire Old and New Testament narra­tives. 
Director of the museum, Dean Porter, believes the exhibition will show the process of etching and familiarize students with Rembrandt's works. Porter said the religious nature is part of the uniqueness of the collec­tion. "Rembrandt's Protestant attitude is reflected in his work," Porter said, "but he speaks in a universal language­-one that has a staggering effect on people." 
Greatly impressed with Rembrandt's style, Jack and Alfrieda Freddersen of Elkhart, Indiana are responsible for gathering the unique pieces from around the world and placing them in a permanent home at the Snite in 1980. Curator Stephen Spiro said the Fedder­sens "wanted to keep Rembrandt in the community and decided that Notre Dame was a special place for them." 
The etchings are stored in a temper­ature controlled environment until they are put on display. Every three years the entire collection is exhibited, but at least five of the etchings are presented on a yearly basis. This year the collec­tion is displayed in a chronological fas­hion according to subject matter. The earliest etching is dated 1626, when Rembrandt was 20 years old, and the collection spans to 1658, 11 years before his death.

Deadline past, peace plans goon 
Associated Press 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua-The author of the Central American peace plan said Thursday that only a negotiated truce in Nicaragua will make it work, and the Sandinistas called a rally to hear President Daniel Ortega declare whether one is possible. 
Ortega returned from a quick trip to the Soviet Union in search of more aid and planned to announce new moves toward implementation of the peace plan at the rally Thursday night. He gave no hint in ad­vance of what he would say. 
Thursday originally was the deadline for implementing cease-fires, amnesties and moves toward democracy re­quired by the peace agree­ment. With progress on some points stalled, however, the region's foreign ministers said 
Democrats avoid issue for peace 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -House Dem­
ocratic opponents of aid to 
Nicaragua's Contra rebels 
backed off from an impending 
fight over the issue today, 
fearing a possible loss might 
send negative signals as the 
deadline arrived for implemen­
tation of a five-nation peace 
agreement in Central America. 
The issue had been raised as 
the House took up a stopgap 
money bill to keep the govern­
ment running past Tuesday. 
The legislation, passed on a 
vote of 256-159, included $3.2 
million in non-lethal aid for the 
Contras. 
Democrats, led by Rep. 
David Bonior of Michigan, had 
planned to ask on the House 
floor for tight restrictions to 
prevent the CIA from deliver­
ing the aid through airdrops to 
rebel troops inside Nicaragua. 
Instead, the aid should be 
routed through an interna­
tional relief agency such as the 
Red Cross, Democrats said. 
"You threaten to blow up this 
whole (peace) process," with­
out such a restriction, Bonior 
argued. "We will be giving a 
tremendous excuse to the gov­
ernment of Nicaragua to break 
this whole thing off.'' 
But Republicans threatened 
to mount a major fight over the 
Bonior amendment, and 
Bonior decided not to press the 
issue, fearing that it could 
prompt members on the ex­
treme left and right to oppose last week that only progress 
toward peace would be re­
quired. 
The presidents of Nicaragua, 
El Salvador, Guatemala, Hon­
duras and Costa Rica signed 
the agreement Aug. 7 in 
Guatemala City. They allowed 
90 days for implementation. 
Banners of red and black, the colors of the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front, and the blue and white Nicaraguan flag were strung across wide avenues and tied around rows of trees in Managua. 
White cloth banners made some of the leftist govern­ment's attitudes clear. 
"Peace with dignity, no to the suspension of the state of emer­gency," they said, and "talks yes, but with the owners of the circus." Lettered in red, "total amnesty, never. never. never."

to the United States, which pro­vides aid to the Contra rebels. Ortega's government has demanded talks with Washing­ton and refused so far to negotiate with the Contras. 
President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, who devised the peace plan and won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his ef­forts, said "the essence" of peace in the region is "reach­ing a negotiated cease-fire in Nicaragua." 
"Unless we do this . . . we won't be able to force Honduras to get rid of the Contras,'' Arias said at a news conference Thursday morning in San Jose, Costa Rica. "Once we have a negotiated cease-fire, the Con­tras will become refugees in Honduras, Costa Rica or Miami and they won't be sol­diers anymore."

Black leader freed in S.Africa 

Associated Press 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -The government today announced the release of Govan Mbeki, a 77-year-old former leader of the outlawed African National Congress who has been in prison for more than two decades. 
Mbeki, one of the nation's most prominent black leaders, was among eight ANC mem­bers, including Nelson Man­dela, who received life sen­tences in 1964. 

The Prisons Service said Mbeki, a former ANC national chairman, would be freed today from the Robben Island prison off Cape Town, where he has been held since his convic­tion on charges of sabotage. 
No other details were avail­able immediately. However, the government arranged for a news media pool to fly to the southern city of Port Elizabeth, near the home of Mbeki's wife, Epainette. 
Mrs. Mbeki runs a small shop in the town of Idutywa, in the black homeland of Transkei. The town is about 180 miles east of Port Elizabeth. 
Mbeki is considered a man of intellectual prowess. Prior to his imprisonment, he had a varied career, working as a teacher, businessman, jour­nalist, author and politician. 
Mbeki was born in 1910 in Transkei, a black homeland along the southeastern coast, where his father was a tribal chief deposed by the govern­ment.

Gulf raids continue; U.S.. mine sweepers try water·s 
Associated Press 
MANAMA, Bahrain -Iran and Iraq sent their warplanes to raid each other's territory Thursday, and an Iranian leader said he sees "no hope" that the United Nations can achieve a truce in the 7-year­old war. 
At the Pentagon, the Defense Department announced that two reflagged tankers arrived in Kuwaiti waters, after a trip through the Persian Gulf with 
U.S. warships. 
Newly arrived American mine sweepers conducted exer­cises to familiarize themselves with the gulf area, and four British mine-hunting vessels steamed to the central gulf to begin operations off Bahrain. 
War communiques issued in Baghdad said Iraqi planes at­tacked the Al-Ahwaz oil field in 
Iran did not say how many of its planes participated in the raids Thursday, but it seldom risks more than two or three aircraft at a time because its fleet is small and old, and it suffers a parts shortage. Iraq has about eight times as many planes as Iran. 
The radio also said Iranian artillerymen shelled economic and military targets in Iraq''s northeastern Sulaymaniyah province, killing or wounding dozens of soldiers and destroy­ing a training garrison and a number of depots and eco­nomic installations. 
A dispatch from the officiatl Islamic Republic News Agency said 12 Iraqi military helicop­ters were damaged by the shelling of a base in the same province. Iraq's news agency denied it.

P.O. Box Q 
Alcohol Task Force seeks broad input 
Dear Editor: 
We are writing this letter for two reasons. First, we would like to clear up some of the rumours that have been surfacing in the last few weeks about the Alcohol Task Force. Secondly, we would like to invite the student body to participate in our efforts. 
Last spring, Father Malloy estab­lished the 15-member task force which consists of faculty, student, and admin­istrative representatives. We were given the broad mandate of examining the role alcohol plays on this campus. During the summer, we received much literature on the subject and became familiar with many issues. 
Currently, we are in the fact finding stage. Talking to various interested parties, we are trying to understand the numerous problems and concerns. To this date, we have made no decisions or policy changes! We are still trying to generate as much information as possible. This is where you come in. 
We have set up forums for all the forms as well as in LaFortune during the week on November 8-12. We need your input, ideas, and suggestions. Your input is very important to our ef­forts in evaluating the use and abuse of alcohol on campus and in formulat­ing recommendations that will be given to Father Malloy. Your voice will be heard and considered very seriously. Our report will have a direct impact on student life. This is your opportunity to have a direct impact on our report. Don't let this opportunity pass you by. Watch for schedules posted around campus, and please attend one or more sessions!

Myriad of ideas strengthens ours 
Dear Editor: 
Notre Dame is a Catholic University, which should mean that it has a univer­sal free exchange of ideas. Even though the administration restrains our free expression, it amazes me that students are also covering their own eyes from diversity. 
In response to Matt Crowley's article of November 4, I believe that the only way to understand our own beliefs and morals is to understand the beliefs and opinions of others. We are too much alike on this campus, therefore we can not challenge our beliefs. It is too easy to remain consistent with each other.

Notre Dame must provide classes and allow clubs that help us understand all facets of life. Classes on Buddhism, Atheism and Nazism should be provid­ed. And students with inverted opinions should be able to form a club and ex­
press  their  own  beliefs  without  
hindrance.  
For  example,  a class  in  Atheism  

forces us to question our belief in God. It challenges us to stick up for our own beliefs. Studying Nazism is also bene­ficial. Hitler was evil, but he possessed a charisma that rivaled Jesus Christ. Hitler had the potential to change the world; not many people even try. 
I also think that allowing a homo­sexual club can only help this campus. When I hear or read about them, I get a disgusted feeling. But knowing more about them relieves some of that dis­gust, and it helps me reaffirm my heterosexuality. I don't think we have to worry about a mass sweep of homosexuality throughout the campus. Homosexuals are people who go to this university, how can we morally hide them? 
But Mr. Crowley's main point is that if we know too much about homosexuality, it might destroy this campus' Catholic unity. I believe that questioning homosexual morality is the only way to raise our intelligence of the issue and strengthen our self-respect.

Conservatives need to recognize facts 
Dear Editor: 
I feel compelled to respond to Pro­fessor Carberry's letter in the Observer November 3. Although not an avid sup­porter of Common Sense, it hurts to see such epithets as "the latest venture in attitudinizing moral arrogance" hurled at a relatively innocuous publication. Apparently the editorial policy favour­ing tolerance, equality and human rights goes against the grain of a self­professed ''elitist Burkean, Thomist conservative". The glib comparison drawn between an alternative news weekly (The Nation) and Mein Kampf is more than slightly misplaced, if not a deliberate distortion. He would do well to remember that Adolf Hitler, an­other elitist conservative, made the socialists and communists the first of his targets (perhaps that rings a bell?). In turn Professor Carberry's beloved conservatism has spawned such niceties as, to name but one, the murder and torture of over 60,000 impoverished Indians in Guatemala alone. 
If individuals in responsible posi­tions, with easy access to information, remain uninformed in this day and age one can only assume that it is a willfully imposed condition. If the learned pro­fessor wishes to learn of what havoc the conservatism he supports has wrought in the United States and around the world, he need only spend

a few afternoons in a nearby library (the Hesburgh Library maybe?). Al­though he might find it more informa­tive to look up publications such as the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, the Am­nesty International reports rather than The New Republic, USA Today or even that paragon of journalism, The South Bend Tribune. 
May I also suggest that before lam­basting professors Walshe and Frese, it might not hurt to review his own ac­complishments to date.

Trudeau's slant not by fault but choice 
Dear Editor: 
I find myself feeling a bit disturbed by Kevin Smant's article in the Nov. 2 issue about Garry Trudeau's "Doones­bury." First of all, I'm not sure which intellectual or non-intellectual circles Mr. Smant has observed to determine his general assumption. I don't recall ever hearing anyone claim that Trudeau satirizes people from all sides of the spectrum or that he plays no favorites. Trudeau has obviously shown no attempt to be impartial. Mr. Smant's lovely examples do not serve to prove any point. The point is moot. Given: Garry Trudeau favors the Democrats and sometimes ruthlessly attacks the Republicans. 
Next, I must ask, so what? Trudeau writes a comic strip. The object of com­edy is to make us laugh, not to be par­ticularly reasonable. Comic writers choose many different ways of amusing. One of these is to exaggerate a detail. James K. Feibleman, in his Aesthetics, states that "Exaggeration ridicules current estimates by pushing the emphases to their apogees ... The feature which the cartoonist singles out for attention are made to stand for the whole face." Creators of comic strips, especially those with political implica­tions, are known for magnifying their opponents' faults while ignoring those of their own group. Of course, Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale, Gary Hart, and Joe Biden provide satirical fodder. But leave them to Berke Breathed, who creates "Bloom County," or other con­servative writers. Nothing is wrong with one-sided commentary in a comic 
situation.  If  the  Republicans  can't  
laugh  at  themselves,  don't  read  
"Doonesbury."  

No, Mr. Trudeau was never an inde­pendent commentator on American so­ciety. Yes, he probably has been churn­ing out the Democratic party's latest line. The last two presidential elections, however, do not suggest that being a liberal icon means sliding into ir­relevance. Don't forget, Mr. Smant, that the Executive is not the only branch of government. Remember who controls both houses of Congress? We must be careful to stay away from un-
Garry Trudeau 

qualified over-generalizations. Carry on, Garry. We're still listening ... and laughing.

Euphemisms cannot mask gay realities 
Dear Editor: 
Mr. Storey's recent ballad proposing University recognition of gay student groups is sang to the accompaniment of common nihilistic liberal rhetoric that appeals, upon brief listening, to characteristics in our society which we hold as virtuous and noble. Indulge, if you will, in some elucidation of the arguments presented in that article. 
By defining homosexuality solely in terms of the gender with which homosexuals "fall in love" as opposed to the gender with which they have sex, the author creates a foundation for recognition of gay groups in the virtue of love, which is infinitely more defen­sible than promiscuous sodomy. Addi­tionally, by premising the definition on love, the reader is diverted from a con­frontation of contemplating the physi­cal reality of the sexual activity being defended by such homosexual groups. 
Predictably, the author calls upon be­coming "more tolerant and accepting" as a reason for gay recognition. Tolerance and acceptance are attri­butes that from childhood we are taught to respect. Where on this campus does tolerance end, thus creating the begin­ning of moral and ethical passivism? Bestiality Appreciation Day? The virtue of tolerance is dependent upon understanding the necessary time to stand up and defend valued principles. 
"The panic in straight world" accor­ding to the author is based upon an "ir­rational fear ... possibly rooted in an insecure sexual identity of one's own." You wouldn't want to harbor an irra­tional fear, certainly not here in America-the home of the brave-would you? For that matter, if you don't con­cur that homosexual groups should be recognized then you too must be sexually insecure. Don't let your dorm­mate find out you oppose recognition lest you be branded a homosexual. This sophomoric reverse psychology is transparent to most sophomores and even some freshmen. 
Should homosexual individuals be recognized on campus? Absolutely. As individuals deserving of our compas­sion, care, sympathy, and support during emotional crisis we should treat homosexuals as we would any other stu­dent suffering from a mental ailment. 
Should homosexual groups be recog­nized on campus? Absolutely not! Uni­versity recognition would symbolically justify homosexuality as an acceptable alternative lifestyle, thus condoning sodomy at Notre Dame, in distinct violation of the moral and ethical foundations of this institution.

Balance on court hurt without Bork 
Attention all liberals! Congratula­tions for achieving your goals! Thanks to your light-headed rhetoric and dubious claims of incompetence per­taining to the defeat ~f Judge Bork's nomination, you have succeeded in driving another nail into the coffin American justice. Retiring Chief Jus­tice Warren Burger, who once vowed he would never step down and give Reagan the chance to "hand the court over to the conservatives," supported the nomination of Bork claiming that 
Peter t;tauae 
from the right 
Bork was one of the most qualified people nominated for the post. It seems that you don't hold the opinion of the man who gave you legalized abortion and no school prayer as having much value. Instead you cry about inconsis­tency, possible overturned rulings, and a Supreme Court teetering on the brink of falling into facism and Pacism. Un­fortunately for the senators con­templating Judge Bork's nomination, your voices were louder than the voices of reason. 
The charge of inconsistency had fol­lowed the proceedings, and for the casual onlooker, for good reason. Before Judge Bork had ever set foot on the witness stand, the organizations of the left, ranging from the AFL-CIO to the Communist Party of America, had made Bork out to be some sort of fanati­cal reactionary demon. However, when Bork arrived on stage, he appeared to be someone who followed strict Con­stitutional construction in a logical manner. He was not just someone who was controlled by ideology and partisan politics, putting him in direct contrast with the senators interrogating him. As President Reagan said at one meeting, "The charges that Hobert Bork is too ideological are themselves ideologi­cally inspired ... " Judge Bork was ac­cused then of bending his views to get the job based on prior statements that he had made dating back to the 1960s. Bork's explanation was reasonable. He simply changed his mind over the en­suing years. All of us tend to change our views as we find fallacies in our own views and truth in other views. Therefore, resurrecting old nails to crucify Bork was not a proper method for denying him confirmation. 
As far as overturned rulings happen­ing as a result of Bork's placement on the Supreme Court, understand that it takes five justices to overturn a ruling, and they had better have good reason. Robert Bork on his own could not over­turn a ruling. He could suggest it and justify it, but to convince four other jus­tices to agree with him is a monumental task to achieve. Also, even though four other justices are conservative does not mean they would all fall into line. As an example, look at the Senate where Republicans vote with Democrats and vice-versa. Therefore, the threat that Justice Bork will overturn any of the civil rights bills or any of the liberal, American Civil Liberties Union pets such as legalized abortion, outlawed school prayer, etc., was unjustifiable unless the rulings were against the Bill of Rights or the rest of the Constitution to begin with. 
For the first time in a long time, a judge had been nominated for the spot of Supreme Court Justice who actually follows the Constitution -not the tides of ideology and partisanism. My dear liberals, please pause from your Bork­bashing and consider this thought. Reagan nominated a strict construc­tionist to provide the crucial swing vote. Robert Bork could have gone both ways. If the liberal view was the con­stitutional view, Bork would have sided with the liberals; if conservative, he would have sided with the conserva­tives. Would you rather that President Reagan nominated a judge whose only redeeming quality was that he was con­servative? Think what that would en­tail! No more legalized abortion, the addition of prayer in public schools, and union busting. If Bork had been nominated, there would have been, "God-forbid," actual interpretation of the Constitution -not just whatever the Left or the Right says it is. After all, isn't that the job of the Supreme Court, to prevent the country from flowing too far to the Left or to the Right? Let us return the once dignified process of nominating a Justice back to the treat­ment it deserves, instead of leaving it to the whims of the media, the Radical Left, the special interest groups, and showcasing senators. The Bork dis­aster should serve as a lesson to us all. President Reagan will now appoint a true conservative to the Supreme Court, which will offset the balance Judge Bork would have maintained. Though a conservative court will be a good change for the country, my poor confused liberals, now try to pass your socialist programs. At least with Jus­tice Bork, you might have had a chance.

Religious life still merits respect 
The November 2 issue of The Obser­ver printed a picture of two Notre Dame cheerleaders dressed as nuns, with a caption underneath which read in part "Is anything sacred anymore: Well at least football is." This is not the only media coverage that this act received, as it was also shown nationwide through WGN television out of Chicago. These events have brought to mind several issues which should be of inter­est to those who take seriously their Catholic faith. 
John Raphael 
guest column 
I would like to make clear that this is not· an attack on the two cheer­leaders, nor is it an attack on the media, for I truly believe that the motive of this act was not intentionally malicious, rather, I believe that it is a reflection of the general spirit of irreverance that pervades our social atmosphere. Some, no doubt, will dismiss what I have to say as the rumblings of someone who is living in the past, but it is precisely this attitude that I wish to discuss. 
The first thing I would like to deal with is the religious life. There was a time when the religious life was looked on by all as the highest vocation that a Catholic could have. Today however, there is a much greater emphasis on the universal call to holiness that is ex­tended to all by virtue of their baptism. Is this to say that the religious life is now less important than it was before the council? Well, if one is to take seriously all of the documents of the council and the constant teaching of the church on this subject, without the selective and highly ideologically di­rected reading of concillar documents that is so prevalent today, one can see that the religious life, with its special charisms of chastity, poverty, and obedience provide the~ religious with the greatest opportunity to completely devote himself to God with an un­divided heart. Something which is not to be expected of the person with familial obligations. To a certain degreee the same can be said of lay people who choose the celibate life, but even this life lacks the complete detatchment that the vows of poverty and obedience provides the religious with. As St. Paul says in I Corinthians 7:32,34; "The unmarried man is busy with the Lord's affairs, concerned with pleasing the Lord; but the married man is busy with this world's demands and occupied with pleasing his wife, This means he is divided. The virgin-­indeed, any unmarried woman--is con­cerned with the things of the Lord, in pursuit of holiness in body and spirit. The married woman, on the other hand, has the cares of this world to absorb her and is concerned with pleasing her husband." In addition the Second Vatican Council in its Constitution on the Church, 42; has this to say about the celibate life, which applies espe­cially to religious. As a means of sanctity it ". . .is that precious gift of divine grace given to some by the Fa­ther to devote themselves to God alone more easily with an undivided heart in virginity or celibacy. This perfect con­tinence for love of the kingdom of heaven has always been held in high esteem by the Chur<eh as a sign and stimulus of love, and as a singular source of spiritual fertility in the world." The words of our Dear Lord in Matthew 19: 10-12 also tell us that there are those who are " eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of God." 
These passages I have chosen be­cause they clearly show the sacredness of the religious life, not only in times past, but very much so in our own times. I think that it is very obvious

that taking something which is so pre­cious to each of us as individual Cat­holics, to the Church, and to Our Lord Himself, and making a joke of it in front of the public eye is not something that we at the University of Our Lady would want to be a part of. Does not the world heap enough disrespect and ridicule on the Church of Christ and her children? Do we want to be identified with groups such as the highly irreverent homo­sexual group in San Francisco that is characterized by its abuse of the Cath­olic sisters' habit? As stated before, I am sure that this was not the intention of the participants in this incident, but when the world watches television, do we expect it to understand exactly what is going on. Certainly a society which is tolerant of abortion, sexual promis­cuity, sodomy, and many other crimes against the divine law of God will not understand the great beauty and sacredness of the consecrated life. In the words of Christ we are called to be the "light of the world," not the other wav around. We must show the world by our words and example what it is

that God wants of each of us. The reli­gious habit is the symbol of one of the greatest vocations in the Church, and it is not fitting that the students of a Catholic school promote the mockery of this important symbol, the wearing of which by religious, is mandated by canon 669 of the New Code of Canon Law. 
This, I believe is the result of Cat­holics allowing the world to influence their religion instead of Catholics in­fluencing the world. This applies as much to Halloween and costume par­ties, as it does to nationally televised football games. Every year there is a great number of drunken revelers parading around campus and South Bend dressed as the religious of the Catholic Church. This is something we must take seriously, for whether we are willing to accept it or not, there are many things that are still sacred and football is not one of them.

Women's lnterhall football heads into semifinals 
By JEFF HEILERT Sports Writer 
Some womens' dorms already are looking ahead to next year's Interhall football season, but for four teams, the "real" season has just begun. 
It's semifinal time. 
Three of last year's semi­finalists return, including three-time defending cham­pion Farley. 
The lone newcomer to this year's playoff scene is Pasquerilla West, which won its last seven in a row to cap­ture the regular-season title. 
Breen-Phillips vs. Lyons 
1 p.m., Stepan Fields. 
BP finished the season at 7-1, with its lone loss coming against PW in six overtimes. 

Offensively, BP led the league with 146 points on the season, averaging more than 18 per game. 
Quarterback Teresa Coombs has played a large role in the success. 
''Teresa began the season with little experience,'' said BP coach Dan DeBoer. "She's worked hard all year, and turned into a fine quarter­back." 
Helping Coombs offensively will be tailback Margaret Johnson and wide receiver Ann Curoe. 
Defensively, look for Karen Marsh at strong safety and the two mainstays on the defensive line, Teresa McFadden and Maggie Citarello, to lead the BP BLitz. Lyons ended the season at 6-2, with losses against BP and PW. 
Lyons' strength is its defen­sive, especially the secondary. Led by cornerbacks Carrie Martinez and Beth Rosa, the defense landed 10 interceptions on the season. 
"At any given time, seven of the eight defensive players have two or more years of ex­perience," said coach Matt Roy. "They have allowed only 30 points all year, a league low." 
Offensively, Lyons is led by tailback Robin McHugh, and has been consistently able to move the ball. 
"Our strength offensively is 
Fisher, Sarin escapE3 tiebreaker 
By ROB PIERCE Sports Writer 
The wait is over. The invita­
tions have been sent, and the 
party is just beginning. 
Only one problem stood in the 
way of the "second season" of 
men's interhall soccer -the 
three-way tie in the North 
American Division between 
Fisher, Flanner and Sorin. 
Fisher and Sorin met Wednes­
day to settle that situation, with 
the winner moving on to face 
Flanner to determine playoff 
pairings and the loser dropping 
out of postseason action. 
Fisher and Sorin are no 
strangers to crucial games ­
they battled on the last day of 
the regular season to decide the 
playoff situation. Fisher 
prevailed, 1-0, and as a result 
forced the logjam atop the divi­
sion. And the rematch was no 
different, as they again proved 
to be the better team, 2-0. 
Sorin controlled the first half 
but, frustrated by the outstand­
ing play of Fisher goalie Jim 
Turecek, could not find the net. 
Instead, Fisher captain Tom 
Cramer managed a tally to put 
his team ahead 1-0 at halftime. 

Mark Derwert scored an in­surance goal that sealed the victory and locked up a playoff berth. 
Fisher then ousted Flanner with a 2-1 victory in a penalty­kick -shootout. 
Cramer was again the catalyst as he opened the scoring midway through the second half. But there was little time for for celebration as Flanner stormed back on a goal by Ted Smith less than two minutes later. It stayed that way through two overtime pe­riods and the first round of the shootout. Then, on the first sudden-death kick, Flanner missed wide and Mark Moran booted home the game-winner for Fisher. 
The win gives Fisher the fourth seed in the playoffs and a first-round match against fifth-seeded Morrissey A, while Flanner must settle for the seventh seed and a date with the defending champion and second-seeded Off-Campus Hoobers. Those games will be played this Sunday at Stepan Field at 1 p.m. to determine who will advance to the second round and who will drop into the loser's bracket of the double-elimination format. 
The actual playoffs began Wednesday. Sixth-seeded Zahm A upset third-seeded defenitely our running game," said Roy. "But the key to Robin's success is tight end Judy Grace. She catches every­thing we throw at her." 
In their regular season matchup, BP grabbed a 14-12 victory. 
Farley vs. Pasquerilla West 
2:15p.m., Stepan Fields. 
Farley finished the season tied for third with Lyons with a 6-2 record. Losses came against BP and Lyons. Offen­sively, Farley is led by sopho­more quarterback Carol Elliot. 
Other offensive weapons are wide receivers Kara England and Colleen McGillus. Both have teamed up with Elliot for numerous touchdown passes. 
The to the could be the special teams play of Tami Goodwin. She has returned three punts for touchdowns, in­cluding one against PW. 
Defensively, Farley is led by defensive ends Kerstan White and Connie Boyden. Both have been influential in keeping op­ponents to only 36 points on the season. 
PW won the league title with a 7-1 record, including winning its last seven. The only loss was a season-opening shutout at the hands of Farley, 22-0. 
PW supports a very strong running game. Led by fresh­man Heidi Hanson and senior Colleen Kretz, the PW offense has rolled to 136 points on the season. 

Stanford, 2-0, behind goals by Mike Meyer and Mark Hahn and the shutout performan1t!e of goalkeeper John Gisleson. The win advances them to the second round to face the winner of Flanner F.C. and the Hoobers, while Stanford falls into the second bracket and the brink of elimination. 
Also Wednesday, top-seeded Holy Cross had no trouble with eighth-seeded Elanner B, blanking them, 3-0. They now meet the winner of the Fisher­Morrissey game, while Flan­ner joins Stanford in the loser's bracket.

Men's and women's swim teams dive into season 
By ROSE PIETRZAK Sports Writer 
After two long months of training, the Notre Dame men's and women's swim teams take to the water for a challenging season. 
With a bigger program and a tougher schedule ahead, the Irish squads begin the 1987-88 season with the Notre Dame In­vitational Relays today at 4 
p.m. in the Rolfs Aquatic Cen­ter. The relays are the first step­ping stone for both teams. 
The men's team attempts to capture the relay trophy after settling for heartbreaking second-place finishes for the past two years, falling to Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1985 and powerhouse Illinois­Chicago in 1986. With a lineup that boasts 24 returning mem­bers, the men's team retained 18 monogram winners and the core of its stability. 
Senior co-captains Pat McManus, a native of Abington, Pa., and Ken Barker of Madera, Calif., will lead the Irish. 
"The extra depth throughout the classes -will make us a stronger team this year," says McManus. "The prognosis is good for the season. We lost some key seniors and we have a difficult schedule, but we'll just have to

Spartans stop Irish, 3-1

The Irish field hockey team lost to Michigan State 3-1 Tues­day afternoon, but surprised the Spartans, ranked in the top 20, with strong second-half play. 
"They're the quickest team we've played," said Irish coach Jill Lindenfeld. "They caught us off guard and scored two goals in the first 11 minutes of play, but after that we calmed down. Our defense adjusted to their speed and we mounted our own offensive attacks. " 
Michigan State, ranked third in the Midwest Region, fired 17 shots on the Irish goal in the first half. The Spartans' ag­gressive Carey Greary scored goals at 2:07 and 11:14. Their third and final tally was scored by Colleen King on a penalty

stroke in the last 30 seconds of play. 
The Irish jumped into the game second half, taking 10 shots on goal after managing only four in the first half. Left wing Christine Gregory put the ball in the cage for Notre Dame at 11:23, and the Irish defense limited the Michigan State to only eight more shots on goal. Goalie M.J. Beetel defended an­other Spartan penalty shot and recorded a total of 17 saves. 
"We held them in the second half," said Lindenfeld. "Our defense -JoAnne Marshall, Patty Ahearne, and Caroline Berezny -played brilliantly. 
M.J. had an overall great game, and Christine Gregory and inside forward Amy Bun­dens had their best games of the season." 
"Michigan State expected to run all over us, and for art of 
Grace, the Irish wouldn't have had the same success without them. 
"Their leadership is really needed," says Grace. "Anytime you have seven or eight freshmen, there's a hell of a lot of inexperience. They need direction, and Timmy and Paul know what we want." 
Gluckow and Hartigan have played under Grace all four years that he has been the 
coach of the Irish.

the game they did," said co­captain Beetel. "Then we got mad and played to make them remember us. We'd been in­timidated by their fast, physi­cal style, but our second-half attitude was different. We played confidently and aggres­sively." 
The Irish wind up their season this weekend at the Mid­west Regional Tournament in Louisville, Ky. 
Notre Dame is seeded sixth in the double-elimination tournament's field of eight teams. It will, however, miss the consistent defensive contri­butions of Berezny who won't be making the trip. Their first game is against third-ranked Eastern Kentucky Univeristy today at 1:30 p.m.

Rosters are due November 11 for the Miami Project, an open flag football tournament to benefit the Marc Buonaconti Fund. The round robin tournament will be held November 20-22.

But as the success continued, the team attitude among the players began to wane, and over October break the team's play on the field started to suf­fer. 
"We went through a downsw­ing on the road trip out west," says Hartigan. "We had a big team meeting before the UCLA match, and Paul got up and noted that the things conflict­ing on the team were so minor compared to what we do the rest of the season. He's really good at seeing the whole situa­tion and coming up with a so­lution which will definitely work." 

Although Notre Dame lost both matches at Los Angeles, the team held its own against those ranked teams and had a chance to win both games. 
"Everything is coming to­gether," says Hartigan. "As freshmen we came in as part of a building program with Coach. And the way we've im­proved to where we are now ­it's sweet." 
Not only has the team's suc­cess made things a little bit easier for the two seniors, but the other players say the team wouldn't be the same without Hartigan and Gluckow. 
"They made soccer fun," says Lowney, who also happens to be Gluckow's (and some­times Hartigan's) roommate off campus. "They captured a lot of the team spirit. They were able to combine responsi­bility with a good time." 
They may not have been able to contribute on the field, but you get a feeling that in the fu­ture, the players will be talking about those days when Har­tigan and Gluckow were on the team.

IH men's semifinals on tap for Sunday 
By TIM SULLIVAN Sports Writer 
The past means nothing. The game means everything. And if you lose, there is no 
tomorrow. 
Four men's Interhall football teams will face those realities on Sunday, as the playoffs move into the semifinal round. Dillon will square off against Pangborn in the first game at 1 p.m. at Stepan, while Stan­ford will meet Fisher in the second game at 2:30. 
The two winning teams will take to the grass of Notre Dame Stadium a week from Sunday to determine the champion. 
The most interesting game on paper has to be the Dillon­Pangborn matchup. Dillon, from the Large Dorm Division, has been extremely strong all season, losing only once. That loss (to Flanner in the last game of the regular season) was avenged last week, as the Big Red downed Flanner 3-0 in the opening round of the playoffs. 
Freshman Tim Murphy has been Dillon's main weapon throughout the :~ea:~on. Hi:~ strong running and receiving from the tailback slot have helped the Big Red to a 58-14 scoring edge in just six games. Dillon has another weapon ­one not shared by many teams in the foot of placekicker Mike Braemer. Braemer's 32-yard field goal was the difference in the Flanner game, and he will 
be  counted  on  for  another  
strong  game  against  
Pangborn.  

Hailing from the Small Dorm Division, Pangborn seemingly is at a disadvantage entering the game. In fact, however, the Violence is not much smaller than Dillon (if at all), and they will be counting on their quick­ness against the Big Red. 
"We didn't get a chance to scout them," said Dillon coach Jeff Morgan of his opponent, "but I know they're quick, and they have a multi-talented of­fense. A small, quick guy can do a lot of damage to a big, slow guy. We have to use our strength, not just our size." 
Pangborn's strength is its running attack, and the main reason for that, according to

coach Dan Sherman, is the of­fensive line. Senior tackle Joe Rossi and tight end Rob Kos­sler (Sherman says Kossler is one of the squad's best play,ers) have anchored the line. 
"We haven't been in the playoffs in a long time," said Sherman, "and that just makes us ... hungry. We've had some 
great practices.  If  we don't  
make  mistakes,  I  like  our  
chances."  

Many people are handing vic­tory to Stanford in the second game -possibly prematurely. 
While Stanford has lived up to its preseason, powerhouse billing, Fisher has proven that it should not be taken lightly. 
Before the playoffs began, Stanford coach Al Martin named Alumni as his toughest opponent to date (Alumni was the only team to score against Stanford), and Fisher roan­handled the Dogs in last week's opening round. 
Fisher's most potent weapon is the Greg Gibbons-to-Pat Murphy scoring connection. Quarterback Gibbons's fre­quent passes to freshman flanker Murphy have propelled the Green Wave to a 56-18 season scoring edge. 
Stanford has been everyone's frontrunner from day one. 
Led by senior player-coach Al Martin at quarterback and a talented, experienced offen­sive line, Stanford has rumbled through four games, scoring 102 points and allowing just six. 
Stanford uses both the pass and the run to wear down op­ponents, and the line is equally effective at both pass-bloc:king and at creating holes. Tailback Dan Diebel and flanker John Sheehan have been the main scoring threats. 
The Green Wave is in an ,envi­able position. If they win, they will be "giant killers." If they lose, they can take consolation in the fact that Stanford is a huge favorite. 
"Everyone has the utmost respect for Stanford," said Fis­her coach Chris Carlson. "Ex­perience and size-wise, they're definitely the superior team. We're glad to have a chance to show them what we can do."

Dawson named AP Player of the Year 
Associated Press 

CHICAGO -Andre Dawson was the best player in major league baseball this year, in the opinion of sports writers and broadcasters who were asked to decide the honor. 
Dawson, who skyrocketed to the top of the batting charts after thrusting himself on the Chicago Cubs last spring, was named The Associated Press Player of the Year Thursday. 
This was the first time the AP has awarded Player of the Year honors.

A new tournament played in a new facility may send a team of Notre Dame students to a New Year's Day bowl game. 
An open flag football tourna­ment will be held in two weeks, from November 20-22, in the new Loftus All-Sports Center. 
The USF&G Sugar Bowl Na­tional Flag Football Drive is part of the Miami Project, the Marc Buonaconti Fund to find a cure for paralysis. Buonaconti is the son of former Notre Dame and Miami Dol­phin football player Nick Buonaconti. He played football for The Citadel and he was paralyzed in 1985 while making a tackle. 
The round-robin tournament has both men's and women's divisions. Team rosters should include between 10 and 18 players. The players on each Center and the Eck Pavillion are just for varsity use, and that's just not true," she con­tinued. "We hope this weekend will, in addition to the obvious fund-raising benefits, open the 
eyes  of  the  students  to  the  
availability  of  the  new  
facilities."  

Games will be scheduled at half-hour intervals throughout the weekend, with a gap pro­vided for students to watch the Penn State-Notre Dame foot­ball game on Saturday, Nov. 21. 
There is a $25 entry fee per team. The fee will be returned to the team at check-in and it can then be used as part of the team collection. 
Belles take seventh spot in Invite 
By KATHY JENSEN Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's volleyball team won two of five matches to finish seventh this weekend at its home invitational, finish­ing the regular season with a record of 16-10. 
The tournament consisted of eight teams, divided into two four-team pools. The first and second place team in each pool advanced to the winner's bracket to determine the first­through-fourth place finishers, while the third and fourth place teams in each pool fell to the loser's bracket to determine the fifth-through-eighth places. 
Saint Mary's started out with a tough loss to Xavier, 9-15, 11­
15. The Belles were led by team captains Margaret Feldman and Patti Knoebel, both Juniors. Feldman had five kills and Knoebel was 10-of-10 in ser­vice attempts with one ace. 
In the second game against Defiance College, the Belles were once again closely defeated, 14-6, 13-5. The team served well, as freshman Col­leen Feldman was 8-of-8 in at­tempts and sophomore Tammy Suth was 10-of-10. 
The Belles regained their strength in the third match as they pounded St. Thomas More, 15-4, 15-2. Knoebel again led the team with four kills, and served 11-of-12 with four aces . This win advanced them to the semi-final round, and seeded Saint Mary's third in the pool play. 
After a close 15-8 victory in the first game of the semi­finals, the Belles proceeded to lose the next two games and ultimately the match to Rosary College, 13-15, 11-15. Feldman led the team with 14 kills, and also served 12-of-13 with three aces. Kim Rajski and Suth con­tributed six kills each. 
In the finals, Saint Mary's once again defeated St. Thomas More by scores of 15-2, 15-7, giving the Belles seventh in the tournament. Freshman Melissa Phillips was 7-of-7 in service attempts with one ace, while Michelle Jones had four kills. 
Michigan-Dearborn took first in the invitational and Franklin College took second. Knoebel was selected to the all­tournament team, by record­ing 15 kills and displaying strong consistent serving. 
"It was a honor to be chosen from all the fantastic players at the tournament," KnOE:bel said.

Sometimes, it's better to go fishing 
There is perhaps no greater magazine than Sports Illustrated. On this campus, it's got to be more read than any other publication with the possible excep­tion of the Bible. 
Sports Illustrated's writing is of the highest quality in the country. The photography is also gen­erally excellent, and not just the Swimsuit Issue. When it's February in South Bend, that issue is definitely more inspirational than the Bible. 
But some of the more interesting articles in each issue are the essays which usually are found in the very beginning or toward the end. These essays are usually concerned with more esoteric topics. Two weeks ago one especially caught my eye as I was whiling away the hours of driving from New Hampshire to South Bend. 
This article was about one woman's foxhunting experiences at the Farmington Hunt Club, outside of Charlottesville, Va. My screams of recognition only served to cause the driver to swerve into the next lane and grumpily wake up everyone else. 
I spent a great deal of time at a riding stable a mile down the road from Farmington called The Barracks. It got it's name from the fact that it occupied land that Hessian troops used as a campsite during the Revolutionary War. Some­times I thought it was because of the psychotic animals housed within.

In either case, it was here that I learned a lot about horses and life. 
Riding is a different kind of sport. At first it's easy to think the horse does all the work, but most of them I've known would rather go for a roll in the grass and chew hay all day long than gallop about and hop fences. The trick is to make them do it anyway. 
Of course, sometimes they don't. 
There is nothing that mixes the thrill o(skydiving, the terror of falling from a tree and the embarrass­ment of being caught with your pants down as being thrown from horse. You can't know it until you come galloping at a fence and suddenly see horse, fence and ground whiz beneath you. This intriguing panorama comes to an unfortunate end with the whump of your body falling roughly to earth. 
As you pick yourself up to the stifled laughs of friends and the inevitable "are you all right," your horse (at least mine did) gives you one of three looks. The first is that of an innocent. Not the "who me" look, but a blank, benign stare. The second is a look of vague disgust, a "what the hell are you
