Peter Rocca, rector of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, said he expects high attendance at Ash Wednesday services. "The 5:15 [p.m.] Mass is always pretty packed, all the way back to the Lady Chapel, aRd the 11:30 [a.m.] Mass is usually quite full too," Rocca said. Ash Wednesday is not a Holy Day of Obligation, making the high student attendance more poignant, he said. "It's a wonderful thing because the vast majority of students go to Mass because tl1ey really want to," Rocca said. "They want a good

'Last Lecture' draws crowd 
Ackermann advises students on careers in the series' second installment 
By MADELINE BUCKLEY 
News Writer 
Pursuing a career without con­sidering financial gain may seem counterintuitive in an economic downturn, but fmance professor Carl Ackermann said students embarking on a career path must do what makes them happy. 
"If you do what you really enjoy, you will be a happier and more productive person," he said. "Financial awards will follow." 
Ackermann spoke to a packed room Tuesday night in the Coleman-Morse Lounge for the second installment of the "Last Lecture" series hosted by student government. 
The series invites professors to impart wisdom in a lecture as if it were their last chance to do so, modeled off of the story of Carnegie Melon professor Randy

Architecture School receives top-10 ranking 
By IRENA ZAJICKOVA 
News Writer 
Notre Dame's School of Architecture recently received some good news in the form of a top-1 0 ranking in the annual America's Best Architecture Schools survey. 
The survey is conducted every year by the Design Futures Council and has con­sistently given Notre Dame's architecture program a high ranking. Last year, the pro­gram was ranked 12th, while Cornell University occupied the 1Oth-place spot. The highest rating Notre Dame has ever received in the sur­vey was ninth place. 
Michael Lykoudis. the dean of Notre Dame's School of Architecture, said he and his colleagues are satisfied with the high rating, as well as 
the high rankings of past years. 
"We've been ranked in that area for some time now," Lykoudis said. "Tenth place is an improvement over last year, which was an improve­ment over the previous year, and so on. So, certainly we're pleased." 
Lykoudis said the survey's rankings are determined based on which colleges' stu­dents are preferred by top architecture firms looking to recruit employees for their company. Therefore, Notre Dame's high place on the list means that architecture stu­dents at the University are wanted more for jobs after they graduate than students at many other schools. 
Lykoudis said the high ranking reflects well on all

Facing a sinking economy and staunch resistance from Republicans in Congress, President Barack Obama put forward a bold agenda Tuesday night in an address to a joint session of Congress that met the expectations of College Democrats president Spencer Howard. 
"Even with the current situa­tion we're in, it was nice for him to raise the bar for what the government is doing," Howard said. "He wants us to reach for things that we've haven't thought possible." 
The agenda Obama set in his speech, which detailed sweep­ing changes to education, energy policy and health care, did not prioritize expanding the government so much as improvh1g its ability to meet people's needs, Howard said. 
"It's not about making gov­ernment bigger," he said. "It's about making government smarter. You don't want to over-regulate, but you can't let people run amok." 
Obama not only described the current crisis while laying the groundwork for a short­term recovery plan, but also detailed his plans to strength­en the economy for future gen­erations. Weaknesses in ener­gy policy, a fractured health care system and lagging public

iPod Manifesto 

When the iPod became popular, it not only changed how people listened to music, but also how people threw house parties. 
All you have to do is buy an iPod dock, make a playlist and you're set. The Chris Hine iPod has turned 
everybody into a Editor-in-Chief deejay. This is a problem. I was recently at a house party and everything was going fine. People were dancing, having a good time, but as it got later in the night, some of my fellow partygoers became dissatisfied with the music. This began a spiral effect that nearly killed the party. One girl, we'll call her girl No. 1, went over to the iPod, looked for a favorite song of hers and put it on. Happy with herself, she resumed dancing but her joy was negat­ed by the disappointment of another girl. Girl No. 2 waited a few seconds to decipher what song it was, process that she didn't like it, and went to change the iPod. Naturally, her selection displeased someone else, who then tried to change the song, and so on. Thankfully, the playlist came around to Rihanna's "Disturbia" and the party was saved (Nobody can resist dancing to a Rihanna song). However, not every party has a happy ending like this one did and may have been ruined by poor song selection on the iPod. To avoid such problems at parti~s in the future, here is a guide to follow, called the iPod Manifesto: 
+Let your host control the iPod for the entire party: 
Your hosts want to throw the best party they can, so they have carefully crafted a playlist that will appeal to all partygoers and maximize everyone's enjoyment. For as much as you might want to change the song, resist that urge. Do not mess with these playlists because ... 

+Newsflash: Nobody cares about you or your friends' favorite song. 
This was the mistake girl No. 1 made at the party I attended. Do you see your absolute favorite song on the iPod? Good for you, but nobody else cares. So while you're singing in an ignorant bliss, everyone around you is getting upset and wondering what the hell is going on. 
+If you absolutely have to touch the iPod, please play an artist or song that everyone likes. 

This is related to the second rule. If you can't resist the urge to change the iPod, play any of the following artists: Rihanna, Kelly Clarkson, T.I., Kanye West Akon, T-Pain, Lil' Wayne. When a song by any of these people comes on at 
· a party, there are no problems. You may not personally like all their songs -I don't-but there's no denying that their songs get a party going. 
+Ifyou're hosting a party, hide the iPod. 

Put your iPod on a dock, get a long playlist cued up, connect it to some good speakers, and put the dock in a closet or someplace where people can't find it. This way, people who search for the iPod can't change it to a bad sQilg and ruin your party. 
+If someone changes the iPod to a bad song, you can kick them out, no questions asked.

"We need to see what student government's role is in relation to the University in providing information about off-campus things," Reish said. 
After going over the survey, the floor was then opened for members of COR to suggest additional questions to the sur­vey.

Students give thanks to alumni with notes 
By PUJA PARIKH 
NewsWrirer 
Those green "Holla Back" T-shirts you may see students wearing around campus are part of the Thanksgiving in February event held by The Notre Dame Annual Fund and Student Development Committee. 
The two-day event, which took place Monday and Tuesday, was created in order to have students write per­sonal thank-you notes to alumni who have donated to Notre Dame this year. 
All Notre Dame students were encouraged to go to the Sorin Room in the LaFortune Student Center and write the letters. 
An Annual Fund and Student Development Center flier said donations made by University alumni " ... have supported our dorms, clubs, academic programs, building maintenance and repairs, campus-wide electricity and heating, financial aid pack­ages, and much more." 
Posters placed throughout the residence halls and in LaFortune to encourage stu­dents to participate in the two-day event read, "Bolla Back. Tuition covers less than 50 percent of the cost of your education. Alumni make it possible. Say thanks." 
The goal of the program was to raise awarene.ss regarding the importance of alumni support of the University by having students

Lykoudis also cited the year that

"It takes only five minutes to say thank you," Emma Kloste·rman, who works for The Student Development Committee, a branch of The Annual Fund, said. "As stu­dents who are part of the Student Development Committee, it is our job to help with student-alumni relations." 
The Thanksgiving in February event is part of the Spirit of Notre Dame Campaign, which is the largest fundraising operation in the history of Catholic edu­cation. 
"We basically want to con­tinue to help students who need monetary assistance," Klosterman said. "And we know that it takes a lot of money to help them out. The alumni of Notre Dame make that possible, and so we real­ly need to thank them for everything they have done. They make Notre Dame possi­ble for so many students." 
The event also provided pizza and soda for students who came to write a note. 
The Annual Fund plans on holding the event again next year due to its success and has planned on expanding the dates and times of the events to accommodate a ·larger response.

Howard also explained how Obama's plan for a more sus­tainable energy policy will lead to a better economy. 
"It's very important," he said. "It's more than energy inde­pendence. We have to have a little more control over what's going on in our economy. If there's a conflict in another country and we can't get the energy source that will cause problems." . 
Bipartisanship has been a goal of the Obama administra­tion, but so far the parties have remained largely divided on economic policy. Howard and Fedynsky discussed Obama's efforts to reach across the aisle. 
"It was clear with the stimu­lus that he tried to reach out to them, and I think he was will­ing to compromise on some points, but I don't think the Republicans really met him," Fedynsky said. "He's not going to go all the way to meet the Republicans because he won the election." 
"The Republican Party, it's not a very big tent," Howard added. "They are very set in ideology and there's not a lot questioning among them it seems. In the Senate, the Republicans take a lot of flak for bucking the party lines." 
Toward the end of his speech, Obama shared accounts of Americans who have struggled to make posi­tive change amid economic hardship. Howard said Obama's optimism has helped to lift the public's mindset. 
"I think now they are start­ing to feel a little more helpful with haying a stimulus pack­age in place," he said. "I think these stories help people see what is possible even if they have been going through hard times."

schools have contributed to the crisis now facing the country, but these things can be fixed, Obama said. 
"If we're honest with our­selves, we'll admit that for too long, we have not always met these responsibilities -as a government or as a people," Obama said.

"I feel like the next few gen­erations will look at this point either as the beginning of the end of our time as a superpow­er or a rebirth of American power," Fedynsky said. 
Howard said Obama fulfilled his aim to "speak frankly and directly to the men and women who sent us here" about the problems facing the nation. 
"I think he understands what people are going through and that's why he came out to Elkhart, Indiana, and Fort Myers, Florida -so people can have access to him," Howard said. "It was an extension of er policy." 
Howard also spoke favorably of Obama's plan to pull the nation out of the recession. The stimulus package recently passed into law will have an immediate impact on the econ­omy by helping ordinary peo­ple, Howard said. 
"Our economy can't get' going if people aren't working," he said. 
Other changes must also take place, Howard said. 
"They have to put in regula­tions where the general popu­lation is not hurt by corpora­tions maximizing their profit," he said.

North Korea plans satellite launch 
SEOUL, South Korea -North Korea said Tuesday it is preparing to shoot a satellite into orbit, its clearest reference yet to an impending launch that neighbors and the U.S. suspect will be a provocative test of a long-range missile.

AUSTIN, Texas -Hundreds of business­es that provided transportation, portable toilets and other assistance after Hurricane Ike are still waiting to be paid six months after the storm, the result of a $134 million dispute between Texas and the federal government. 
Small businesses around the country are struggling because of the delay, and many of them say next time a hurricane threat­ens the Texas Gulf Coast, they might be reluctant to help.

The dining halls will continue with vegetarian Lenten Fridays, which have sparked controversy in the past. 
Marc Poklinkowski, general manager of South Dining Hall, said, "We will have meatless meals on Ash Wednesday and on Fridays throughout Lent. This is a University policy that's always existed. But two times in the past 10 years, this issue has been brought up to the administration." 
Despite student complaints, the dining halls will not change this practice any time soon. 
"We're a Catholic university, and the administration really wanted to continue that tradition," Poklinkowski said. 
To appease disgruntled students, the dining halls will serve "meat­less favorites," vegetarian foods students love. Poklinkowski said these items included cheese-filled breadsticks, cheese lasagna and popular fish items, like shrimp. 
"We look for things that are real­ly popular with students to serve in place of meat," Poklinkowski said. "A lot of student<> come in disap­pointed, so we try to make it easier on them."

Ackermann said he was once offered the job of putting together the American League baseball schedule. The job combined his interest in baseball, logic and math, but he declined the job offer. 
"My good friends and I thought there was no money and no future in sports," he said, generating laughter from the crowd. 
Ackermann said he missed out on a great opportunity because he was searching for financial reward, so he encouraged students to take a chance in their job search. 
Learning from this mistake later in life, Ackermann said he came to Notre Dame to focus on research, but instead concentrated on teach­ing, despite warnings that he was making a poor career decision. 
"I deemphasized my research and moved in the direction of try­ing to help students," he said. "It ~as ~aybe one of ~~e best deci­Sions I ve ever made.

The knowledge to be gained from current economic struggles will benefit students later in life, he said. 
"You should be much more opti­mistic," Ackermann said. "Your path may be more circuitous now, but where there's a will there's a way." 
One significant lesson to be gained from the lack of job oppor­tunities is the in1portance of hard work, he said. 
"This economic climate should be a humbling reminder to you to never, ever be mediocre in your meatless Fridays tradition. 
"It's a contribution we can make to the celebration of Lent," Cortes said. "We're not trying to impose this on anyone, but this is a Catholic university. It's good to stop and think about the reasons behind this practice." 
Non-Catholics can e~joy the tra­dition too. There are non-religious reasons that the meatless Fridays are beneficial, Cortes said. 
"Not eating meat is good for your cholesterol. If people have been thinking about being vegetar­ian and want to try it out, this is an opportunity," Cortes said. 
Cortes has undertaken a special project -decorating the large front window in the South Dining Hall lobby. 
"It's a way to show some signs of what Lent is all about," Cortes said. 
The decorations will incorporate purple and white, the colors of Lent, and symbols of the Lenten season, like an empty cross or a crown of thorns.

''I'm still sure you can accomplish

Ackermann said he believes

"If you volunteer in the area of

IN BRIEF 
President says U.S. banks safe 
WASHINGTON -President Barack Obama says the money Americans have deposited in US banks is safe and the nation can rely on the con­tinued operation of the fmancial system. 
In a speech to a joint session of Congress, Obama sought to reassure Americans nervously watching banks struggle to remain solvent. Obama said a greater concern is if the banks don"t start re-lending, the economic recovery will be choked off before it begins. 
He called the flow of credit the lifeblood of the economy. 
To address the problem, Obama said the administration will create a new lending fund to help provide loans such as college and auto. He touted his $275 billion housing plan to help those facing foreclosure. And he said the government will use all resources to ensure that major banks have enough money to grant loans in difficult times. 
Musicians want radio stations to pay 
WASHINGTON -Sheryl Crow, will.i.am, Herbie Hancock and other entertainers on Tuesday urged Congress to force radio sta­tions to pay performers when their music is broadcast. 
Satellite radio, Internet radio and cable TV music channels already pay fees to per­formers and musicians, along with song­writer royalties. AM and FM radio stations do not pay performers" royalties, just song­writers. 
"People deserve to be paid when some­body else uses their property," Hancock said. 
He and the other musicians, including Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle, appeared at a news conference on Capitol Hill on behalf of the musicFIRST Coalition. The group is pushing legislation that would require radio stations to pay musicians roy­alties similar to those paid to songwriters. 
The National Association of Broadcasters, who oppose the measure, said a fee would put thousands of radio jobs at risk. The association also argues that stations drive listeners to buy music and concert tickets.awmakers in the House and Senate have introduced bills that would make radio stations pay the artists when their songs get airtime. 
Home prices tumbling at record rate 
Falling costs will affect homeowners' ability to qualify for mortage relief 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Home 
prices tumbled by the 
worst annual rate on 
record in the fourth quar­
ter, two housing indexes 
showed Tuesday, and the 
slope of decline steepened 
in all but a handful of bat­
tered cities. 

The farther prices fall, the fewer homeowners may be able to qualify for President Barack Obama's mortgage relief plan. Last week, the president esti­mated up to 5 million bor­rowers in good standing who don't owe more than 105 percent of their home's current value would be able to refinance into a lower interest-rate loan. 
Though details of the plan won't be released until March 4, almost 14 million homeowners are already under water, according to Moody's Economy.com, meaning they owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. Nationally, home prices have receded to 2003-lev­els, and half of the metro areas in the 20-city Case­Shiller Home Price Index have lost more than 20 percent of their values from their peaks in 2006, including Las Vegas, Phoenix and Miami. cent during the quarter year-over-year quarterly all saw home values lose

PALESTINE 
Han1.as, Fatah begin unity talks 
Associated Press 
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip -The Islamic militants of l-lamas and the moderates of Fatah have never had more compelling reasons to repair the rift between them that is fast destroying their dreams for a Palestinian state. 
As they begin a new round of unity talks after several failed attempts, l-lamas needs the Western-backed Fatah's inter­national legitimacy to get for­eign aid to rebuild Gaza, which was devastated in Israel's recent offensive. 
Fatah chief Mahmoud Abbas badly needs an alliance with l-lamas to bolster his political standing, eroded after his term as Palestinian

Israel will win ty won't give 
Palestinians a victim of Israel's Gaza huge recon­state. offensive struction sums 
But a unity agreement appears to be a long shot. Distrust between l-lamas and Fatah runs deep after a three­year power struggle, including a civil war that ended with l-lamas' violent takeover of Gaza in 2007, leaving Abbas' Fatah in charge of just the West Bank. 
Sami Suboh, a 32-year-old doctor whose house was destroyed during Israel's Gaza offensive, said he hoped for a unity deal soon. 
"With the unity government everything would go back to normal. I hope that they can reach an agreement," he said, waiting in line for Red Cross aid supplies. But he added, "It is unlikely." 
The sides traded nasty accu­sations this week despite pledges to be civil ahead of rec­onciliation talks beginning Wednesday in Cairo. 
l-lamas claimed Abbas' gov­ernment ran a Gaza spy ring that fed Israel information about l-lamas targets during the fighting. Fatah accused llamas of killing and wounding dozens of Fatah activists under the cover of the war. 
"All l-lamas has been doing is poison the atmosphere," said Abbas aide Yasser Abed Rabbo. Ehab Ghussein, a l-lamas offi­cial, countered that Fatah's statements prove it is not inter­ested in making amends. 
Partly to clear the air, top officials -Ahmed Qureia of Fatah and Mussa Abu Marzuk of l-lamas -agreed to a pre­liminary meeting Tuesday, according to Abbas aide Nabil Shaath. Abbas' security offi­cials also freed 42 l-lamas detainees in the West Bank on Tuesday in a goodwill gesture and promised more releases the next day, said Ayman Daraghmeh, a l-lamas legisla­tor. 
The talks beginning Wednesday will include meet­ings between Egyptian intelli­gence chief Omar Suleiman and officials from both sides. 
The Egyptians envision five negotiating committees dealing with making goodwill gestures, forming an interim govern­ment, holding presidential and legislative elections, restructur­ing the security services and finding a role for l-lamas in the Fatah-run Palestine Liberation Organization. 
On March 2, representatives of about 80 donor countries, including U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Hodham Clinton, are to meet in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheik to pledge money for Gaza's recon­struction. 
According to Palestinian esti­mates, Israel's offensive caused some $2 billion in physical damage and economic losses. 
Conference participants will closely watch the unity talks, particularly progress on form­ing a new Palestinian govern­ment. Such a government could be made up of figures not affili­ated with either movement or 
directly to 
Gaza's l-lamas rulers, but might entrust aid to an interim coalition, provided Abbas is involved. 
"For the donors, the issue is not so much unity, but using unity as a vehicle to strengthen Abu Mazen (Abbas) and him a new foothold in Gaza," analyst Mouin Rabbani said. 
To be accepted by the inter­national community, an interim government would have to renounce violence and recog­nize Israel's right to exist. Barnas has rejected such condi­tions in the past. However, in exchange for softening its stance, l-lamas could strength­en its hold over Gaza by getting a say in how aid is spent and ensuring a 20-month blockade of the territory is lifted. 
Abbas may need the Islamists more than they need him. 
His term as president expired in January and polls suggest most Palestinians side with Barnas' argument that he is not

entitled to an extension. With Benjamin Netanyahu as Israel's next prime minister, Abbas' promise of statehood through negotiations has fallen nat ­Netanyahu considers such talks a waste of time. 
This may explain why Abbas is eager to hold unity talks without preconditions, saying he is entering the negotiations with "an open heart." After the Ham as takeover of Gaza, Abbas had insisted the militants first retract their "coup" before he would talk to them. 
l-lamas and Fatah might reach a unity agreement rela­tively quickly, as thny did in February 2007 in Mecca, only to see it fall apart in bickering over implementation. 
In contrast to those negotia­tions, rival governments are now in place in the West Bank and Gaza, meaning there are more politicians with an inter­est in maintaining the status quo. Also, some llamas and Fatah activists oppose a unity deal on ideological grounds. 
On some issues, the gaps are so wide that compromise seems impossible. 
For example, Hamas wants a major say in the PLO, of which it is currently not a member. 
Abbas rejects the demand because it would amount to redefining the Palestinian national movement. The Fatah­led PLO signed an agreement of mutual recognition with Israel in 1993, while llamas remains committed to the destruction of the Jewish stale. 
Other issues seem just as daunting, particularly restruc­turing the security forces. l-lamas controls some 20,000 troops in Gaza, while Abbas' thousands of armed men in the West Bank are undergoing Western training. Under a unity deal, the forces would have to be merged and depolitieized. 
Gaza-based political scientist Naji Shurrab said outsiders, including Hamas backers Syria and Iran, could decide to sabo­tage unity efTorts. And it is not clear whether the Obama administration will be more supportive of a unity govern­ment than its predecessor. 
"The way is still long, and there are many obstacles,"

Palin 111ust pay Alaska nearly $7,000 for her kids' trips 
Associated Press 
JUNEAU, Alaska -Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin will reimburse the state nearly $7,000 for costs associated with nine trips taken by her children, her attorney said Tuesday. 
Palin must reimburse the state within 120 days, according to a settlement agreement filed by a special investigator hired by the Alaska Personnel Board to inves­tigate an ethics complaint filed against her. 
The exact amount. will be determined by the Alaska Department of Administration, said Palin's attorney, Thomas Van Plein. He estimated the amount would be $6,800. 
There is no state law prohibit~ ing the governor's family from traveling with her and the per­sonnel board found no wrongdo­ing on the part of the governor. But the investigator, Timothy Petumenos, interpreted the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act to require that the state only pay if the first family serves an important state interest. 
Petumenos said "some of the travel raised by the Complaint does not meet this standard," according to the agreement. 
Van Plein said 72 travel author­izations were studied, with nine found to be of questionable state interest. 
Those include airfare and one meal for her daughter Bristol Palin, who accompanied the gov­ernor to New York for Newsweek's Third Annual Women and Leadership Conference in October 2007. 
Other trips include Bristol attending "Beauty and the Beast" at the Valley Performing Arts Center, airfare for daughters Piper and Bristol to travel to Juneau from Anchorage for the State of the State address and airfare for Piper to attend the start of the Iron Dog snowma­chine race and the Alaska Outdoor Council Banquet. 
In a statement issued Tuesday, Palin said she was gratified that no fault was ascribed to her. She said she agreed to support a clar­ification of the rules to avoid sim­ilar disputes in the future. 
"Although I am not required to do so, I will set a new standard on travel now by assuming the burden of these particular expenses," Palin said. 
The former Republican vice presidential candidate called the complaint "an obvious political weapon" filed just before the election. 
The complaint was filed in October by Anchorage Democrat Frank Gwartney, 60, who alleged that Palin used her official posi­tion as governor for personal gain, violating a statute of the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act. 
Gwartney, a retired power company lineman, said he was not surprised that the personnel board, whose three members are appointed by the governor, failed to find wrongdoing. 
"I think it's really apparent that she was wrongfully using state funds to conduct personal busi­ness," he said. "They basically are ail extension of the gover­nor's office so I think they would be hard pressed to actually come out and condemn her as they should." 


Gwartney's complaint followed a report by The Associated Press that Palin harged the state more than $21,000 for her three daughters' commercial flights, including events. where they weren't invited, and later ordered their expense forms amended to specify official state business. 
Administration officials have said Alaska law allows governors to charge the state for their fami­ly's travel if they conduct state business. 
Van Plein said the governor's action in reaching the agreement was voluntary and above what was legally and ethically required of her. 
"She did not have to do this. She did not have to reach this agreement and she's been fully cleared by this investigation," he said. "The problem that was raised by the complaint was determined to be a lack of clarity in the rules and regulations and a lack of familiarity, because of that lack of clarity, with long-term state employees whose job it is to handle this." 
Petumenos was asked to exam­ine the complaint at the same time he was investigating allega­tions that Palin fired her public safety commissioner over his refusal to let go a state tr:ooper involved in a contentious divorce with Palin's sister.

Iovva knew of disabled vvorkers 
Associated Press 
DES MOINES, Iowa -Iowa's social-services agency acknowl­edged Tuesday that it looked into a company's treatment of its mentally disabled meatpacking workers as early as the 1970s, but decided it lacked the jurisdic­tion or enough evidence to act. 
State officials say the 21 Texas men lived for decades in a bat­tered house in the tiny eastern Iowa town of Atalissa and were paid little for their work. The fire marshal closed the living quar­ters Feb. 7, the men were placed in state custody and a state agency is considering criminal charges. 
Social workers, howeve"r, had looked into the workers' housing situation twice before without taking action: once in the 1970s and again in 1997, according to a 38-page file discovered about two weeks ago at the Human Services Department's Muscatine County office. 
''I'm not going to debate whether I would have done something differently 35 years ago," Gene Gessow, the agency's director, said in a statement. "What I will do is pledge that from now forward, the Department of Human Services will be aggressively vigilant to protect the rights of dependent adults." 
His department said the file was incomplete, making it "diffi­cult to put all of the decisions in context." 
Last week, Gessow referred to the newly discovered file in his testimony before the Legislature's Government Oversight Committee, which was looking into the state's response to the situation. A redacted ver­sion of the file was made public on Tuesday. 
The men lived at a 106-year­old house that locals called the bunkhouse. The city of Atalissa owned the home, and city offi­cials recently· acknowledged that some of its doors were pad­locked, windows were boarded up and the heating system was broken, leaving only space heaters. 
The men worked for Henry's Turkey Service, a Texas company that provided labor for a meat-

ments to living expenses, leaving them about $65 a month in wages. 
The file said that in 1975 Henry's Turkey Service was an ancillary firm of Hill Country Farms, based near Goldthwaite, Texas, and described that com­pany's work as social and voca­tional training of mentally dis­abled men. It was unclear where operations for Henry's Turkey Service are now located. 
There was no answer on Tuesday at a telephone number listed for Hill Country Farms and an attorney who rnprosented Henry's Turkey Servic(' in previ­ous Iowa matters said he wasn't authorized to comment. 
The state file includ<~s a Dec. 4, 1974, memo from social worker Ed George, who tells district manager James Strickland that the mentally disabled men lack adequate housing and are deprived of their families, among other problems. 
guage," Turk said. "I promised myself that I would speak in my mother tongue at an offi­cial meeting one day." 
Kurdish lawmakers gave Turk a standing ovation. His party has 21 legislators in the 550-seat parliament. 
Turkey's prime minister himself spoke a few words in Kurdish at a campaign rally over the weekend. But fears of national division -supported by a war between the Turkish military and a Kurdish rebel group in the 1980s and 1990s -prevent any concerted effort to repeal the laws. 
Turkey is caught between the long-held suspicion that outsiders and minorities can threaten state unity, and its moves toward the kind of Western-style democracy that would consider a language ban an affront to human rights. 
Turkish law banned the speaking of Kurdish at all until 1991, and today it is barred in schools, parliament and other official settings on the grounds that it would divide the country along eth­nic lines. Kurds, who are also present in large numbers in neighboring Iran, Iraq and Syria, make up about a fifth of Turkey's more than 70 million people. 
"The official language is Turkish," Parliament Speaker Koksal Toptan said after Turk spoke. "This meeting should have been conducted in Turkish." 
Private NTV television reported that prosecutors launched an investigation. 
It was not clear whether he would face charges. As a law­maker, he has immunity. In certain cases, a normal citizen speaking Kurdish in an official setting could go to jail. 
But Tuesday's incident could hurt Turk's party, which is already accused by prosecu­tors of having ties to sepa­ratist Kurdish guerrillas. 
Turkey's power structure could be at odds over what course to take on the speech. The Islamic-oriented govern­ment has often sparred with secular circles backed by the judiciary and the military. 
In a similar incident in 1991, a Kurdish lawmaker took the oath in parliament in Kurdish. Leyla Zana was later stripped of her immunity, prosecuted on charges of sep­aratism and links to the rebels and served a decade in prison along with three other Kurdish legislators. 
But heavy-handed action by the state this time could back­fire, exposing it to accusations of authoritarian behavior and further alienating Kurds ahead of local elections on March 29. 
Turk's speech was also a vote-getting stunt, as the elec­tions will determine whether his Democratic Society Party can keep southeastern strong­holds in the face of an aggres­sive campaign from the gov­erning party. 
Speaking in Kurdish, Turk described how he was jailed during a 1980 military coup and was beaten for speaking Kurdish to visiting relatives who knew no other language. 
Associated Press 

ISTANBUL -The leader of Turkey's Kurdish lawmakers startled the country Tuesday by speaking in his native lan­guage in Parliament, breaking the law in a country that has tried for decades to keep a firm grip over the restive minority amid fears of nation­al division. 
State-run television immedi­ately cut off the live broadcast of legislator Ahmet Turk. ostensibly to celebrate UNESCO world languages week. But his real aim was to challenge the country's policy toward its Kurdish population, a suppression of rights that only recently has started to ease.

Sen. Burris refuses to resign 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Sen. Roland Burris refused to resign on Tuesday, rebuffing a call from the Senate's No. 2 Democrat who made it clear the embattled Illinois lawmak­er has little hope next year of winning the seat vacated by President Barack Obama. 
"I told him that under the circumstances, I would resign," fellow Illinois Sen. Richard Durbin told reporters after an hour-long meeting with Burris. "He said, 'I'm not going to resign.'" 
"I can't force him," Durbin added. 
Burris, also a Democrat, was appointed by disgraced former Gov. Rod Blagojevich: who was impeached and driv­en from office after he was charged in a federal criminal complaint of trying to sell the Senate seat. 
Burris repeatedly changed his story about how he was appointed. He is facing calls for his resignation after he admitted trying to raise money for Blagojevich. Burris has said he did nothing wrong. 
Emerging from the hour­long private meeting with Durbin, Burris looked a bit shaken and inexplicably said he was under orders not to comment, other than to say the session was a "great dis­cussion." 
Burris has faced intense pressure from all quarters, from politicians to home state newspapers clamoring for him to step down. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn said last week Burris should resign for the good of the state, arguing the contro­versy surrounding his appointment has cast a shad­ow over his service in the Senate. 

In their meeting, Durbin said he told Burris that sup­port among other Democrats was eroding because of Burris' shifting account of whether he tried to raise money for Blagojevich. 
And in the careful language of the Senate, Durbin said he made clear that if Burris tried to run for the seat next year, he would not have much -if any -support from Senate Democrats. Consistent with a Senate appointment, Burris would have to win the seat outright next year. 
"I asked him if he would be a candidate in 2010 and he said he had not made up his mind," Durbin said. "I told him I thought it would be extremely difficult for him to be successful in a primary or a general election under the circumstances." 
The conversation followed Burris' exchange earlier in the day with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., on the Senate floor. 
"I said, 'How was your break?' He said, 'Fine. How was yours?"' Reid told reporters afterward. "I said, 'Fine.' OK?" 
Asked whether Reid thinks Burris should resign, spokesman Jim Manley said: "That is for him to decide." 

The chilliness that greeted Burris in Washington came after outright demands for his resignation in Illinois. 
Burris testified in January before the Illinois House com­mittee that recommended Blagojevich's impeachment that he hadn't had contact with key Blagojevich staffers or offered anything in return for the seat. Blagojevich faces charges of trying to sell Obama's former Senate seat, though he denies wrongdoing. 
But just more than a week ago, Burris released an affi­davit saying he had spoken to several Blagojevich advisers, including Robert Blagojevich, the former governor's brother and finance chairman, who Burris sa\d called three times last fall asking for fundraising help. 
He changed his story again last week when he admitted trying, unsuccessfully, to raise money for Blagojevich. 
Illinois lawmakers have asked local prosecutors to look into perjury charges, and a preliminary Senate Ethics Committee inquiry is under way. Even the White House said last week that Burris should take the weekend to consider his future. 
Burris has denied any wrongdoing. Attorney Timothy 
W. Wright III said Tuesday that he was working on a doc­ument that would prove Burris didn't lie about the cir­cumstances of his appoint­ment.

Most troops will be out of Iraqin 18 months 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Barack Obama plans to remove all U.S. combat troops from Iraq by August of next year, administration officials said Tuesday, ending the war that helped define his upstart presidential cam­paign -although a little more slowly than he prom­ised. 
The withdrawal plan -an announcement could come as eady as this week -could help Obama turn his atten­tion to another campaign pledge: Deploying more troops to Afghanistan, a region he calls the central front in the war on terror­ism. 
The timetable is a compro­mise. Removing so many people

logistical and other support troops. A brigade is usually about 3,000 to 5,000 troops. 
The White House consid­ered at least two other options -one that followed Obama's 16-month timeline and one that stretched with­drawal over 23 months, The Associated Press reported earlier this month. 
Some U.S. commanders have spoken more optimisti­cally in recent months about prospects for reducing the force. 
Marine Maj. Gen. John Kelly, who just left his job overseeing U.S. operations in Anbar Province, said Tuesday that he saw violence drop to an almost "meaning­less" level over the past year. 
Kelly told reporters 
Tuesday that 
in the area 

Iraq if troops are brought out too soon, while others think the bulk of U.S. combat work is long since done. 
Obama built enormous grass-roots support for his White House bid by pledging to withdraw troops from Iraq 16 months after taking office. That schedule, based on removing roughly one brigade a month, was predi­cated on commanders deter­mining that it would not endanger U.S. troops left behind or Iraq's fragile secu­rity. 
Obama expects to leave a large contingent of troops in Iraq, between 30,000 and 50,000 troops, after August, 2010 to advise and train Iraqi security forces and to protect U.S. interests, according to two administra­tion officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plan has not been made public. The con­tingent will include intelli­gence and surveillance spe­cialists and their equipment, such as unmanned aircraft. 
The withdrawal of American forces is set to be c.ompleted by December 2011, the period by which the U.S. agreed with Iraq to remove all troops. 
A senior White House offi­cial said Tuesday that Obama is at least a day away from making a final decision. An announcement on Wednesday was unlikely, he said, but added that Obama could discuss Iraq during a trip to North Carolina on Friday. 
About 142,000 U.S. troops are in Iraq, roughly 14 brigades, about 11,000 more than the total in Iraq when President George W. Bush announced in January 2007 that he would "surge" the force to put down the insur­gency. He sent an additional 21,000 combat troops to Baghdad and Anbar province. 
Although the number of combat brigades has dropped from 20 to 14, the U.S. has increased the number of pulled out 
months ago. 

"There is still a security issue there, but in the province I just left the (Iraqi) army and the police are more than handling the rem­nants of what used to be al­Qaida," Kelly said. "There's other parts of Iraq that aren't going quite as well but all of Iraq is doing pretty well." 
According to officials, Obama had requested a range of options from his top military advisers, including one that would have with­drawn troops in 16 months. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had recently for­warded withdrawal alterna­tives to the White House for Obama's consideration. 
In addition to the U.S. troops to be withdrawn, there is a sizable cadre of contractors who provide services to them who would pack their bags as well. There were 148,050 defense contractor personnel work­ing in Iraq as of December, 39,262 of them U.S. citizens. 
There are more than 200 

U.S. military installations in Iraq. According to Army offi­cials interviewed by the Government Accountability Office, it can take up to two months to shut down small outposts that hold up to 300 troops. Larger entrenched facilities, like Balad Air Base, could take up to 18 months to close, according to the GAO. 
As of Monday, at least 4,250 members of the U.S. military had died in the Iraq war since it began in March 2003, according to an Associated Press count. More than 31,000 have been injured. An additional 35,841 have received medical air transport due to non-hostile incidents. 
Congress has approved more than $657 billion so far for the Iraq war, according to a report last year from the Congressional Research Service.

needed the · English credit to graduate or were just taking the extra class for fun. "Colonizing a subject coun­try that's non-white. Think of China, South Africa, India, Ireland ... " 
I raised my hand. "Ireland is consid­ered non-white?" 
Mrs. G paused, and tilted her head in thought. "Huh. Hmm ... well, I guess Ireland would be an exception there." 
We went on to discuss mimicry, the imitation of one's colonizer. Mrs. G sub­mitted afternoon tea in India as an example. Then we discussed technology as a means of "civilizing" the colonized. I remember a classmate proposing that irrigation might not always be a means to oppress a desert community of Others. 
The outcome of that discussion hasn't, for whatever reason, stuck with me. But Ireland, as "non-white?" That has. 
Maybe because a little over two years later, studying post-Famine emigration in a very clifferent class, we learned that "whiteness" was only a construct, such that more established, "real" Americans were considered "whiter" than the also Caucasian Irish newcomers. 
Now I may owe an apology to Mrs. G. If "whiteness" is a term for social domi­nance, then Ireland, while colonized, would constitute a "non-white" civiliza­tion. 
So I'm sorry, Mrs. G, for briefly ofT­tracking the lecture. In terms of critical theory, you were right. Now, how about a nice cup of tea while we wait for all this discourse to blow over? 
But seriously. Whiteness?

may change. Some words grow unus­able; others become proper. 
But "white" and "whiteness," and other terms referring to color, refer on an actual, literal level to just that: physi­cal eolor. Sure, at some point color came to connote what we and others histori­cally have called race, but far from accu­rately. In Pre-K, I was confused when I first heard a girl on my bus, the girl with the pretty pink and green beads in her hair. referred to as "black." What? Lena was brown. My mother, at around the same age, had a sear on her arm "putT up" (say hello to the keloid genes). She too was confused when someone told my grandmother that this must have result­ed !'rom "colored blood." Mom was unaware at the time that some blood is clear. 
So from the Upper Midwest in 1992 and my mother's England in the 1960s, let's jump to Notre Dame in the late 2000s. Here my gorgeously porcelain skinned acquaintance Raquel once com­plained that a crude loudmouth on the quad had incorrectly identified her·as "white" (and felt the need to make his misconception clear to her. Someone back home needs to learn to hold his Natty). 
So "color" terms, whether socially acceptable or offensive, may not accu­rately describe "race," however that term is defined. Yet "white" and "non­white" now not only refer to color and race, but also apparently to status (in the case of immigration) and character (in the case of oppressive tea-mongering colonizers and unassuming, blissfully un­irrigated subjects). 
And there's the problem. Too many meanings -some contradictory -are conflated in too few words. We should phrase it this way: 
Color is color. As in, what kind of light a skin cell reflects .. 
Race, !'or whatever that distinction's worth and hopefully it's constructive, is race. 
Status is status. 
And people are people. 
I'm not white. I am a person of color. 
Specifically, a pinkish-taupe. On forms and by the census definition, I am Caucasian. But if' I apply eye-liner in just the right dimensions so that my Arab comes out, you're likely to notice that by commonly held standards I'm not consid­ered 100 perent "white." 
That's not uncommon. A dear friend of mine, who so nicely wrote up what hap­pens to be my own perspective on an explosive issue here in the Viewpoint last week, is pearly-skinned like Haquel. She would find it much harder than I would to ehoose'the correct "race" bubble on the Scantron form. Another friend is dark-skinned, "black," but hates being called African-American, beeause she's not. 
As for people being people, the four of us, in spite of and along with everything else, remain ourselves. No one, no mat­ter the theory, is put in a box. One is not just "white" or "non," colonizer or sub­ject. One is not just one's religion or romantic preference. One is not even the sum of one's conduct as that is viewed at this very instant. One is who one is, that is, a person. The suggestion that one is anything else is dehumanizing. 
Which may be why most explanations of Post-colonialism don't involve plain language.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Congratulations swi111111ing and diving. 
I know that it is highly unusual to receive a letter from a head coach at a rival university, but I felt compelled to share with you and your readers something about which you should all be proud -Irish Swimming and Diving. At the recent Big East Championships that ended this past weekend, your Irish men and women walked away with two Big East Conference Team Championships. For the Notre Dame women, it was their 13th straight Championship (13th overall). For the Notre Dame men, it was their second straight title and fourth overall team title. Both team wins were challenged at every turn. But the most exciting moment of the meet and one that will live in the lore of our conference's sport histQ­ry was the final race of the evening that gave a clear underdog Irish men's relay team a win and the Notre Dame men the team title. 
Let me recap the scene for you so that you know how incredible an event this last race was. At the end of the last individual event prior to the relay the Notre Dame men had a slim 3.5 point advantage over the Louisville men. The meet would be decided on the last relay. Notre Dame was a decided underdog. The Louisville men were seeded with a time 
(2:55.59) that was more than seven seconds faster than Notre Dame (3:02.86). In order to win the title, the Irish men would have to swim a school record time to have a chance. It would be uncharted territory for the Irish. Your Irish relay team was John Lytle, Danny Lutkus, Josh Nosal and Andrew Hoffman. At the end of the first leg, Lytle held the lead over 
Louisville by .31 seconds. Lutkus extended that lead by the end of the second leg to .52 seconds. Nosal still kept the lead, but Louisville narrowed it to .22 seconds, while the crowd at the IUPUI Natatorium went crazy. It was impossible to hear anything but the crowd as the swimmers for all four legs of the race went down the pool stroke for stroke. At the end, Hoffman held on to the lead and extended it slightly to out-touch the Louisville men by .32 seconds in a time (2:54.08) that was more than nine seconds faster-than the Irish men had gone all season this year! At the end of the meet, the Irish men had pulled a conference victory out of the mouths of the Louisville Cardinals by the narrowest of mar­gins in a race that will no doubt be the stuff of Irish Swimming and Diving lore for years to come. 
Congratulations to the Irish Men and Women! You should be proud of them. Note: Only one Big East Conference team rivals the success of the Irish in swimming and diving ­Pittsburgh. With 28 Big East Conference Championships between the Panther men and women, the third place Pitt team for both men and women this year will undoubtedly chal­lenge the Irish down the road for the title. Swimming and Diving is alive and well in the Big East Conference!

While I realize the purpose of his article was to most likely to spread awareness for Dillon Hall's Stache Bash benefit, I found Jay Fitzpatrick's analysis of the "Moustaches of the World" to be lacking. Perhaps his motive was to lower the expectations of the ladies attending the bash, most of whom will be escorted by wearers of the "common crustache," but he omits the greatest mustache of our time, that of Keith Hernandez. Named the best sports mustache of all time by the American Mustache Institute, Mets and Cardinals legend Keith Hernandez may possess the best mustache known to man. Clean-shaven from his rookie season in 1975 until 1978, his bat­ting average hovered around .250 until he grew out a grand mustache and hit .344 and won the batting crown in 1979. He kept the 'stache and won the National League MVP award, 11 gold gloves, a World Series in 1986, and the hearts of New York's fans as the voice of the Mets for SportsNet New York. Just because no Dillon (or any other sort oD man could match the great­ness of' No. 17's mustache doesn't mean that its majesty should go unrecognized.

Let's talk honestly about race 
Eric Holder, the nation's first African-American attorney gen­eral, gave a speech last week. In it, he characterized the United States as "a nation of cowards" when it comes to discussing our tortured racial history. Many people were offended etc. Others believe race is no longer an issue. But I beg to differ. Those peo­ple are mistaken. 
I see Holder's words as a challenge to us all to have honest conversations about race in America. We are living at a time when the gains of the 1954 Supreme Court decision, Brown v. Board of Education, have been completely reversed, when the gap in wealth among different racial groups has never been wider, and when the effects of historical inequities have never been clearer in education. 
We attempt to distance ourselves from slavery. But the effects of slavery have been felt throughout our history and continue to plague us today as we strive to be the nation we once envi­sioned -a nation that insured opportunity for all. 
But we cannot distance ourselves from history. By talking honestly about race, we give ourselves hope that we can over­come inequality and become stronger than we have ever been before. · 
We cannot distance ourselves from illegal slave trade that continued from 1808 into the late 19th century and that U.S. presidents from Jefferson to Grant condoned and sup.ported ­even if they only looked the other way. 
We cannot distance ourselves from a history of slavery of a different name. Prison leasing (or forced labor) of black men and women began after the Supreme Court rescinded the Civil Rights Act of 1875 and continued until World War II. This was the practice of arresting former slaves for not having a job or changing jobs without getting permission from a former employer. Found guilty for these "crimes," they were sentenced to 30 days of hard labor. But their sentences were increased to up to a year if they could not pay for court costs. Few could, given widespread unemployment in the 1880s. Prisons through­out the South "leased" Blacks to major corporations to work in steel furnaces and mines. There was a 45 percent mortality rate for prisoners leased to these corporations. 
We cannot distance ourselves from New Deal politics that allowed Southern legislators to exclude blacks from economic incentives that brought a majority population back to work and helped create wealth that blacks were denied. Many of these same legislators insured that few blacks could take advantage of the GI Bill after World War II. 
Predatory lending practices and redlining are all too evident in massive foreclosures. Yet these practices are not new, follow­ing on the heels of the government's disinvestment in urban cities in the 1950s. These practices have existed for years, !;!espite the promise of the 1968 Fair Housing Act. 
So when will we have an honest conversation about race? When will we all face the fact that our government agencies have been complicit in creating inequality and injustice in hous­ing, education, and health care? 
The time is now.

The bombings at Guernica were some of the first exam­ples of terror bombing, as the town was a military stronghold and had no defense.

Approximately 80-120 refugees were crammed onto this ship, which was built to hold a maximum of 30 passengers.

The de facto collapse of democracy in Albania on March 1, 1997, and Albanian presi­dent Sali Berisha's simultaneous decla­ration of a state of emergency, sparked the immediate migration of over 10,000 Albanians to nearby Italy. Foreign gov­ernments pulled their citizens out o the country. 
As anarchy took hold in Albania, Italian officials, suddenly dealing with a refugee crisis, expressed resentment to the United Nations and asked for the organization's support of a naval block­ade to stem the flow of illegal immi­grants.

Scene Editor 
One aspeet of "Guernica," the latest Mainstage production of the Film, Television and Theatre IFTT) Department at Notre Dame, which might go unnoticed to the untrained eye, is its list of eredits, and one of the show's top design credits goes to a stu­dent. 
Kimberly Mering, a senior FTT major from Baraboo, Wis., is the set dPsigner for "Guernica." Mering is taking on the project for her senior thesis in FTT. 
Designing the set for "Guernica" has been a challenging and collaborative task for MPring. · 
"In ordPr to design the set, I had to work from the script and in discussion with the director and other designers to come up with a design that works for the show and in the space where the piece is being performed," Mering said. 
That space, the Philbin Theater, is known as a "black box" theater, a ver­satile facility in the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center that functions as something of a blank slate for each new production. 
The set itself. Mering said, draws its inspiration from the interaction between man and nature, a theme that runs through the production. 
"The set is based on the idea that while humans intrude on natural set­tings, causing dissonance in something that should be beautiful, eventually nature is able to restore itself by over­whelming the intrusion," she said. 
Her design incorporates a variety of "natural looking elements," including sand, rocks, water and seashells. 
uman on environment Mering has designed. 
"There is human 'stuff' all over the place," she said, blending and eroding into the larger landscape surrounding it. 
The process of designing was a diffi­cult one, Mering admitted, and unlike her previous challenges on other pro" ductions. 
"Designing and building was tough," she said. "I never realized just how much goes into getting a design from that first reading ... to up-and-running by opening night. 
"But it was really rewarding to finally see everything as it came together after months of work." 
Designing the set for "Guernica" pre­sented another layer of pressure for Mering, as the project is effectively her senior thesis, the culmination of four years of work in the major. Mering said that while the design is now a cohesive whole, the process of working towards that design had its twists and turns. 
"I knew I wanted to work on a cre­ative project," Mering said. "What real­ly excites me about theater is the chance to be part of a collaborative process that results in· something as beautiful as 'Guernica. '" Through the careful guidance of several members of the FIT faculty, Mering decided to take on the set design of a mainstage show, leading to her position as the "Guernica" set designer. 
If students are wavering in their deci­sion to see "Guernica," Mering said the play will no doubt interest them long after the final curtain falls. 
"It's a very tragically beautiful show," she said. "You'll walk out thinking about something you saw or heard happen to the characters." 
tory ... one; she first encountered the mpnt during her freshman year, in the mainstage production o "Wings." After that early foray into act­ing, however, she found herself: more drawn to the technical side of produc­tion. 
"Since ["Wings"] I've been mostly behind the scenes," Mering said. ''I've been the Assistant Set Designer on a few shows [2008's 'The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus,' among oth­ers] and the Light Board operator on 'The Mousetrap."' 
As an employee of the s<;ene shop at the Performing Arts Center. Mering has also helpPd build the sets for major FTT productions for the past few years. 
Mering actually came to the University with the intent of studying political science. But early involvement with on-campus theater productions got her hooked, and by her junior year, she had declared FIT as her major. Mering said the department's faculty were her strongest influences during her undergraduate career, leading to her work with "Guernica." 
"They're supportive and excited about what they do and what wP stu­dents do," she said. 
Ultimately, the power of theater is what's kept Mering involved these past four years, from that first role in "Wings" to her senior thesis. 
":Just having the chance to be a part ofa live performance in any capacity is very rewarding," she said. "Live the­ater is such a powerful medium, and the more I learn about it, the more I realize how much this is true."

Colts release receiver Harrison from contract 
After 13 years with Indianapolis, leading career receiver released after refusing pay cut, becomes free agent 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS-The Indianapolis Colts released Marvin Harrison, ending the star receiver's 13-year tenure with the team and breaking up one of the great pass"-and-catch combina­tions in NFL history. 
Colts owner Jim lrsay announced the move Tuesday after meeting with Harrison in a final effort to re-sign the fran­chise's career receiving leader. 
"It's a day as an owner you know eventually will eome, but it's not a day you look forward to," Irsay said at a news conference. "I ean see Marvin in 1996 coming in from the draft into our complex and talking to him and meeting him for the first time, and the journey began. 
"As an owner, these are rare events, when you have a chance to talk about an individual who literally changed the face of a franchise," 
Harrison, who did not attend the news conference, ranks sec­ond in NFL career receptions with 1,1 02, the vast majority from quarterback Peyton Manning's passes. Together they helped make the Colts one of the most prolific passing teams in the league for m.ore than a decade. 
} Iarrison made eight Pro Bowls and earned a Super Bowl ring, and his 14,550 yards rank fow-th on the NFL's career list. He is No. 5 all-time with 128 TD catches and holds all major single-season and career receiving marks for the Colts. 
Colts president Bill Polian said he talked with Harrison Saturday night. 
"We talked at length about all the things he accomplished here," Polian said. 
"He worked so hard on his craft, always so prepared. He did every little thing it took to win," Polian said. "And he did it with quiet dignity, with superb profes­sionalism and with a sense of con­tribution to the team that really is second to none. lin is a Hall of Famor, no question. I Ie's the tran­scendent receiver of this genera­tion." 

I Iarrison's agent, Tom Condon, said Monday that th<) Colts had agreed to release !Iarrison after he declined a pay eut. !Iarrison had the highest salary cap num­ber of any NFL receiver at $13.4 million. 
, But he turns 37 in August and is coming off the least productive healthy season of his career. Cutting him could save the Colts about $6 million on next season's salary cap. 
"It's a tough day for us, losing one of the all-tinw grnaL'i. Marvin is a consummate winner," new ct>a<~h Jim Caldwell said: "I had a chance to watch him on the prac­tice lield day in day out. He's the most competitive guy I've ever seen.... He also had a great pride in everything he did."

NEW YORK -The New York Knicks are free of Stephon Marbury, and the troublesome point guard is free to join a playoff con­tender. 
Marbury was waived Tuesday by the Knicks, ending a turbulent five-year stint in which the former All-Star couldn't lead his hometown team to a single playoff victory. 
The team released a statement saying an agree· ment between the Knicks and Marbury had been reached, but did not dis­close financial terms. Knicks president Donnie Walsh has said the team and Marbury have been trying to work out a buyout. 
Walsh's hope was to get something for Marbury in a trade, but with Marbury's salary of close to $21 mil­lion this season and a divi­sive personality, he knew a deal was improbable. 
Marbury would be eligi­ble to play in the postsea­son for any team that signs him because he was waived by March 1. He has been linked to the Boston Celtics, who are in need of a back­up guard with Tony Allen injured. 
"The Celtics are focused on defending our champi· onship and are working day and night to finalize our playoff roster," owner Wyc Grousbeck said. "We don't have anything to announce at this point except that we intend to do everything we can to raise Banner 18." 
Tho_ugh perhaps the most talented player on the ros­ter, Marbury hadn't played in a game this season as new coach Mike D'Antoni preferred to stick with the players who would be part of the Knicks' future. He never gave the tempera­mental guard a chance to cause the same troubles for him that he did for Larry Brown and Isiah Thomas. 
The Knicks' statement also said Marbury's griev­ance against the Knicks had been resolved. The sides attended an arbitra­tion hearing earlier Tuesday regarding the nearly $400,000 in salary the team had docked the point guard after alleging he refused D'Antoni's request to play in a game in Detroit in November when the team was short-hand­ed. 
He then publicly criticized D'Antoni and said he could never play for the coach because he didn't trust him. Marbury sought his depar­ture soon after that episode, but hadn't met face-to-face with Walsh since Dec. 1, when he left a meeting after just 20 min­utes because they weren't close on a buyout agree­ment. 

IN BRIEF WR Crabtree indecisive on 
whether to run for scouts 
INDIANAPOLIS -Michael Crabtree might not perform in front of NFL scouts, after all. 
The top-rated receiver in this year's draft told NFL Network on Tuesday there was only a 50· 50 chance he would run at his personal workout next month in Lubbock, Texas. 
On Saturday, doctors at the league's annual scouting com­bine diagnosed a stress fracture in his left foot and recommend­ed surgery to insert a screw. Rehabilitation is expected to take 10 weeks or more, mean­ing Crabtree wouldn't be able to work out for scouts before the draft if the procedure was done soon. The draft is April 25-26. 
On Sunday, Crabtree changed his plans. He said he would delay surgery until after his personal workout. Now that could change. 
Oden sidelined again
by bone chips in i{nee 
HOUSTON -Portland Trail Blazers center Greg Oden will miss at least two more games because of a bone chip in his left knee. 
Oden was hurt in a collision dur­ing a game at Golden State before the All-Star break. The 7-foot Oden missed the rookie challenge and will miss sit out Tuesday's game iri Houston and Wednesday's game in San Antonio. 
Coach Nate McMillan said there was a "slight chance" Oden would participate in practice on Thursday. McMillan said he want­ed to see Oden run before deter­mining when Oden would play again. 
"We thought, everybody thought, he would be able to be moving by now," McMillan said. "Things just keep getting bumped back." 
McMillan said doctors have assured him that the injury won't turn into a long-term absence. 
Texas ~ech's Knigl}.t gets
suspension for argmng 
KANSAS CITY -The Big 12 Conference suspended Texas Tech coach Pat Knight for one game on Monday for complaining about the officials after a loss to Texas A&M. 
Knight received a technical foul in the second half of the 79·73 loss on Saturday for arguing a foul call and complained about the officials after the game to reporters, saying he didn't care what the Big 12 thought. 
The son of Bob Knight, Pat Knight also was publicly repri­manded by the Big 12 earlier this month for being ejected after run­ning onto the court twice to argue a foul call in a game against Nebraska. 
Assistant coach Stew Robinson will replace Knight for Wednesday's game against Texas. 
"I wasn't surprised because I broke a rule," Knight said during the Big 12 coaches teleconference.

FORMULA ONE 

New team looks for drivers 
Founders of Formula One team hope to make debut in 2010 
Associated Press 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -The founders of a new U.S.-based Formula One team plan to hire a pair of American drivers, and Mario Andretti believes his grandson is the perfect choice to fill one of the seats. 
Ken Anderson and Peter Windsor, the principals behind the team they call USF1, official­ly announced their intent Tuesday to run the 2010 sched­ule. The motorsports veterans said they'll base the team in Charlotte, home for most NASCAR teams, and scour the market for young American drivers. 
"Who they are ... your guess is as good as mine," said Windsor, a former team manager for Ferrari and Williams and cur­rent F1 pit reporter for Speed TV. "But two American drivers, that's what we intend to do." 
Windsor rattled off a prospect list of relatively unknown open­wheel drivers currently compet­ing in lower ranks, the most notable Jonathan Summerton, a 21-year-old Florida native racing in Europe in the A1GP Series. 
Then he and Anderson turned to their dream list, which includ­ed former F1 drlver Scott Speed, NASCAR star Kyle Busch and IndyCar glamour girl Danica Patrick. But Speed has said he has no interest in leaving NASCAR for an F1 return. Busch and Patrick both are willing to discuss the opportunity, but nei­ther has been contacted by USF1 representatives. 
Neither principal mentioned Marco Andretti, the budding lndyCar star and grandson of 1978 F1 world champion Mario Andretti. 
Mario Andretti called into the news conference, which was tel­evised live on Speed TV, as an invited guest in support of the USF1 team. During his com­ments, he recommended his 22­year-old grandson for a future F1 ride. 
"Every time I mention Formula One, he says 'I'd give anything to have this opportuni­ty,"' Andretti said. "If I were to design a Formula One driver today, I would design Marco. We'll see what the future brings for him." 
Marco Andretti signed a con­tract extension last year with Andretti Gree·n Racing, the team co-owned by his father, Michael. He was testing Tuesday at Homestead-Miami Speedway and not immediately available for comment. 
After Andretti hung up, Windsor added Marco Andretti to the list of potential hires, as well as Graham Rahal, a 20­year-old IndyCar driver. 
There has not been an American driver in F1 since Speed was released from Toro Rosso in the summer of 07. 

Speed, who has since moved to NASCAR, was the first American driver since Michael Andretti in 1993. 
The list of potential drivers was one of the few details revealed, as Windsor and Anderson had nothing concrete to offer about their planned race team. 
They are looking at a building in Charlotte to house the opera­tion, and plan to hire roughly 100 team members and operate with an annual budget of about $64 million. They also plan to have a "logistical base" in Europe to house transporters and equipment. 
Beyond that, they would reveal little else. 
Windsor said they've secured four private investors, but declined to reveal their identities and said their stakes in USF1 are small enough that he and Anderson will remain the pri­mary owners. 
Anderson, who worked for the Ligier and Onyx F1 teams in the 1980s before turning to design­ing and engineering IndyCars, said the team will rely heavily on American technical support. 
"Most of the technology in Formula 1 comes from the United States to begin with," he said. "The cost of doing business in the United States is signifi­cantly cheaper than Europe, and there are a lot of good people here."

NBA 
Wade sets career high in Heats'win over Pistons 
Spurs hold Mavericks to worst offensive showing of season while All-Star Duncan sits out with sore knee 
total with 26 games still to play, moved within two games of idle Atlanta for fourth in the Eastern Conference. 
Detroit (27 -28) fell into a tie for sixth in the East with Philadelphia, and needs to win in New Orleans on Wednesday to avoid matching the fran­chise's longest skid since 1995. 
The key for Miami was defense in the third quarter, which finally got the Heat some breathing room. 
Iverson's layup with 9:05 left in the third put Detroit on top 60-5'8. The Pistons proceeded to miss 12 of their 13 shots over the remainder of the peri­od, with only six free throws in the final seven minutes of the quarter keeping Detroit within striking distance. 
McDyess' three-point play with 10 minutes left got Detroit within 82-76, but the Pistons got no closer. Wade scored Miami's next three points, then found Cook for a 3-pointer that restored a 10­point lead. 
Miami outrebounded Detroit 44-34 -an impressive stat, considering the Heat had been outrebounded by an average of 18 in their last three games. 
Spurs 93, Mavericks 96 
Tony Parker had 37 points and 12 assists with All-Star 
teammate Tim Duncan sitting out with a sore right knee, and the short-ha,nded San Antonio Spurs held the Dallas Mavericks to their worst offen­sive showing this season in a 93-76 victory on Tuesday night. 
Parker scored 26 points in the first half and shouldered the load without Duncan and Manu Ginobili, who hasn't played since the All-Star break because of a stress reaction in his right ankle. 
Michael Finley scored 16 against his former team, and Josh Howard led the flat-look­ing Mavericks with 19 points. 
The severity of Duncan's injury wasn't immediately known, nor was his likelihood for Wednesday's game against Portland. Duncan walked around the locker room before the game but was scratched only a half-hour before tip-off. 
He was not on the bench for the game. 
It was the first time this sea­son San Antonio's leading scorer sat out with an injury, and left the Spurs to manage again without two of their big three. The Spurs survived a rocky first few weeks without Parker and Ginobili, who at the time was still recovering from surgery on his othe·r ankle. 
Ginobili, who is expected to miss another few weeks, cheerleaded in "street clothes as the Spurs won their third straight. 
Dirk Nowitzki scored 14 points for the Mavericks, who are also still without one of their biggest offensive weapons, Jason Terry. The standout sixth man missed his sixth game with a break in his non-shooting hand. 
Minus Duncan, Ginobili and Terry, the latest meeting in the Interstate 35 rivalry was a far cry from the 133-126 double­overtime thriller that the Spurs wrested in Dallas in December. 
Tuesday was more of a jog than a sprint. The Mavericks shot just 34 percent from the floor and San Antonio improved to 18-2 when hold­ing opponents below 89 points. 
Matt Bonner added 11 for San Antonio and Kurt Thomas had 10. 
Popovich did not mention Duncan's health in a pregame chat with reporters. But when the subject of the recent rash of notable injuries came up -Ginobili, Phoenix's Amare Stoudemire, Boston's Kevin Garnett -Popovich plainly stated that "everyone knows you got to have your horses to win it all." 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -Not only did Dwyane Wade continue his run of career highs, he sent the Detroit Pistons to a new low. 
Wade scored 31 points and set a personal best with 16 assists, leading the Miami Heat to a 103-91 win and handing the Pistons their seventh 
straight  loss  - Detroit's  
longest slide in more  than  
seven years.  

Daequan Cook scored 16 points, Jermaine O'Neal added 14 and Jamario Moon added 12 for the Heat, who took con­trol with a 22-8 run to close the third quarter and held on from there. 
Allen Iverson scored 22 points and Tayshaun Prince added 18 for the Pistons (27­28). who fell under .500 this late in a season for the first 

Specializing in f)eautih.l Color 
time since 2000-01. 
Michael Beasley scored 11 points and Udonis Haslem fin­ished with 10 points and 11 rebounds for Miami. Antonio McDyess shot 8-for-10 and scored 17 for Detroit. 
Playing for the first time since Sunday's career-best 50­point outburst at Orlando, Wade missed his first four shots before getting on track. He had his 70th career double­double before the third quar­ter was done and finished 11­for-20 from the field, getting 10 points in the final 12 min­utes to keep Miami in front. 
His jumper with 2:02 left gave Miami a 98-87 lead, seal­ing the outcome that provided the Heat with a much-needed boost in the Eastern Conference playoff race.

The  fans  in  the  Dunkin'

Sure enough, after the Friars dribbled out the last 20 sec­onds -it was too far gone for Pitt to try fouling -the fans went over the tables and chairs circling the court and celebrated one·of the biggest wins in school history. 
"We weren't here to get rolled on," Providence forward Jonathan Kale said. "We knew we had to win one. It hap­pened to be Pitt. They hap­pened to be No. 1."

LSU wins ninth straight victory over Florida 
Johnson puts up impressive numbers in Purdue's defeat of Indiana, possible conference player of year candidate 
Associated Press 
BATON ROUGE, LA. -Trent Johnson took over a LSU bas­ketball program last April that had gone through consecutive losing seasons in the Southeastern Conference. 
Now in Johnson's first sea­son the Tigers are SEC cham­pions again, clinching at least a share of the conference crown with an 81-75 victory against Florida on Tuesday night. 
Marcus Thornton scored 32 points for the Tigers (24-4, 12­1), who have won nine straight overall and 12 in a row in SEC play. They can win their second outright confer­ence title in the last four sea­sons with one victory in the last three games. 
''I'm so happy for these guys, you have no idea," Johnson said. "I don't believe in all that destiny stuff. This is a good basketball team. The thing I really appreciate about these guys is they speak from the heart and they have a sense of security." 
Garett Temple scored a career-high 21 points for the Tigers. Tasmin Mitchell added 12 points. 
It's been a huge turnaround for LSU, which fired coach John Brady during last sea­son's losing campaign. Johnson was lured away from Stanford after the season. 
"Winning is always fun," Thornton said. "Last year, we didn't have the season like we wanted to have. Nobody but the guys in this locker room thought we could have a sea­son like this." 


Walter Hodge paced the Gators (21-7, 8-5) with 16 points. 
The Tigers trailed 56-53 before going on a 14-2 run to take control of the game. A basket by Temple was fol­lowed by Bo Spencer's three­point play and gave LSU a 58­56 lead. After Alex Tyus tied the score for Florida, LSU scored nine consecutive points. 
"I think we were playing against the best team in the league right now with a whole bunch of seniors," Florida coach Billy Donovan said. "Our guys did pretty well to be honest with you. We had some plays that we could have made, but we just didn't." 
Two free throws by Mitchell gave the Tigers the lead at 60­58 with 10:18 to go. A 3­poiuter by Temple, a layup by Mitchell and two foul shots by Thornton boosted the LSU advantage to nine points at 67-58 with 8:01 to play. 
The Gators scored six straight points on a three­point play by Ray Shipman and a 3-pointer by Ervin Walker. LSU rebuilt its advan­tage to seven points on two foul shots by Thornton and a dunk by Chris Johnson. Florida came no closer than four points the rest of the way. 
"We really got after them and guarded them in the sec­ond half," Trent Johnson said. "At halftime, we made a cou­ple of adjustments to attack 
their zone.  We made  a  deci­ 
sion  to  run  our  m.an  stuff  
against it."  

Tyus had 15 points for Florida and Chandler Parsons and Nick Calathes each had 12 points. 
Florida, which trailed for most of the opening 20 min­utes, closed the first half on a 17-5 run to take a four-point lead. The Gators were behind 32-24 after Thornton made his third 3-pointer with 6:58 remaining before halftime. 
A 3-pointer by Dan Werner began the Florida outburst. Tyus and Calathes combined to score the Gators' next ten points. A three-point play by Tyus tied the score at 37 with 
1:19 left in the first half. 
Shipman then made a steal and drove for a layup to give Florida its first lead since early in the first half. A layup by Parsons put the Gators on top 41-37 at halftime. 
LSU regained the lead at 44­43 less than two minutes into the second half when Thornton knocked down another 3-pointer. However, Florida came right back to take a 50-46 lead with Hodge making a pair of layups. 
The Tigers answered with seven consecutive points ­five by Temple. 
The Gators scored six points in a row on a 3-pointer by Walker and a three-point play by Parsons to go on top 56-53 with 12:05 remaining in the game. LSU then started the game-deciding run. 
Purdue 81, Indiana 67 
JaJuan Johnson has emerged as Purdue's unex­pected conference player of the year candidate. 
Johnson has carried much of the offensive load while Robbie Hummel, the Big Ten's preseason player of the yea~ has fought through a hairline fracture in his lower back: 
In Big Ten play, the 6-foot­10 Johnson ranks fifth in scor­ing (14.8 per game), fourth in rebounds (7 .2), third in field­goal percentage (.565) and first in blocks (2.57). He's one of the main reasons No. 16 Purdue (21-6, 10-4 Big Ten) remains in the hunt for the conference title. 
Johnson had 14 points and 10 rebounds and five blocks in Purdue's 81-67 win over Indiana on Saturday. Hoosiers coach Tom Crean tried to recruit Johnson to Marquette two years ago.

double figures. Junior guards Ashley Barlow and Melissa Lechlitner had 13 and 12 points respectively and junior center Erica Williamson had 18 points, 11 rebounds and five blocks, tying her career high. She said she still has work to do, however, in the blocks department. 
"I definitely haven't mas­tered it, because I fouled them a couple times," Williamson said. "[It's] stay­ing in front of the ball, not stepping up too much but let­ting them come to you and jumping up in the right moment." 
Sophomore guard Erica Morrow scored 18 points and senior guard Chandrea Jones had 16 points and 11 rebounds for the Orange, who dropped to 15-12, 4-10 in the Big East. 
"We had no problem getting the ball to the post," Syracuse coach Quentin Hillsman said. "We got the shots that we 
· wanted. They do a good job of playing the matchup zone." Notre Dame capitalized on the 25 fouls called on Syracuse and made 28 of its 35 free throws. Hillsman said fouls early in the first half made it difficult to play the rest of the half. "That's going to affect every kind of play," he said. "That means you can't touch anyone for 17 minutes." Schrader fouled out with 
1:11 remaining, but her per­formance earned her a stand­ing ovation from the crowd and a hug from McGraw as she left the court. 
Notre Dame expanded its lead with six unanswered points to make the score 78­63 with 4:54 left. Barlow stole the ball and drove the length of the floor for a layup to give Notre Dame an 84-67 lead with 2:44 left. 
Referees whistled the Orange for six fouls in a 1:21 span, and Notre Dame con­verted all eight free throws it attempted. The Irish led 53­43 with 15:58 remaining, at which point Syracuse had seven fouls in the half. 
After grabbing a rebound midway through the half, freshman forward Erica Solomon collapsed, favoring her left leg. She limped through a couple possessions before Williamson replaced her. 
Notre Dame continued with the foul shooting and didn't make a field goal for 4:56 in the second half, but a techni­cal foul following a personal foul gave Notre Dame four straight free throws, and the Irish made them all_. 
Williamson made a hook shot and tipped in a miss and Lechlitner hit two more free throws to give Notre Dame a 65c48 lead with 10:10 left. 
Just as Notre Dame went to the line often early in the sec­ond half, Syracuse got some help in the foul department later on. Notre Dame commit­ted seven fouls in just over three minutes, including Schrader's third and fourth and two three-point plays. Syracuse made all five free throws during the stretch and pulled within 70-61 with 6:57 left. 
In the first half, Schrader had 11 points in the first seven minutes and her two free throws gave Notre Dame a 22-7 lead with 13:30 remaining. Notre Dame start­ed the game on a 16-3 run and led 24-12 with 10 min­utes left in the first half. 
Three Syracuse fouls in a minute and a half helped Notre Dame start shooting foul shots early. The Irish got to the one-and-one mark with 
8:33 remaining in the half. 
Two quick baskets by Morrow brought Syracuse within 10, but Bruszewski converted a 3-point play to make the score 36-23 with 
5:13 remaining. 
With some help from Jones, Syracuse worked its way back. A four-point play from Tasha Harris tied the score at 36, capping a 13-0 Orange run. The half ended with Notre Dame ahead 38-36. Schrader finished the half with 15 points on 6-of-7 shooting. 
Notes: 
+Williamson now has more than 100 blocked shots, with 102, good for 9th on the all­time list at Notre Dame. 
+Schrader is now six points a way from 1,000 for her career.

Worth the weight 
Burroughs repeats as heavyweight champ; finalists in other 12 divisions determined 
By DUSTIN MADDEN, 
MOLLY SAMMON and 
DOUGLAS FARMER 
Sports Editor 
The big boys got a chance to fight for a title amid a night of semifmal bouts in the 12 other weight classes, and Will "The Stimulus Package" Burroughs beat his good friend Kevin "I Left My 6-Pack in my Gym Bag" Crepeau for the second straight year to claim the heavyweight championship. 
"After we fought last year we became friends, hung out on occasion," said Burroughs, a law student. "I think fighting him again only added to the stress element. When it turned out we were fighting, it was as if we needed to put the friendship on

.Belles top Adrian in playoffs 
By ROBERT GRAHAM . Sports Writer 

Saint Mary's extended its record-breaking season last night after defeating Adrian Bulldogs 74-60 in the MIAA tournament's first round at the Angela Athletic Complex. 
The win was the l6th of the season for the Belles (16-9, 13­3 MIAA), the most in the history of the school's program. 
Saint Mary's never let up after building an early 20-8 lead over the visiting Bulldogs. Senior forward Erin Newsom recorded her seventh double­double of the season, scoring 13 points and grabbing 10 rebounds in the win. Freshman Patsy Mahoney also added 11 points with a trio of 3-pointers.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE 
For Blaney, lacrosse is always a family affair 
By MEAGHAN VESELIK 
Sports Writer 

For Shaylyn Blaney, you could say lacrosse runs in the family. 
The sophomore midfield/ attack has played in 22 games at Notre Dame, and she's scored in every one -but her lacrosse career dates back more than a decade. 
"I started playing lacrosse on a team when I was in second grade, but lacrosse has always been a huge part of my family," said Blaney, whose three older siblings all played at the col­lege level. "My dad coached me when I was younger and my mom was my high school coach. They are always there to support me and help to keep my confidence up. 
"I never liked the title of 'the coach's daughter,' but looking back I wouldn't have it any other way." 
Lacrosse has helped shaped Blaney's life since a young age, and at this point, she says there's no turning back. 
"It is hard to imagine my life without lacrosse," Blaney said. "It is such a big part of who I am. I think that if lacrosse was­n't in my life another sport would be in its place." 
Blaney has a team-high eight goals through three games for the Irish (2-1) this year, and as a freshman scored 43 goals to rank second on the tearp. 
Those gaudy statistics helped make Blaney a unanimous all­Big East preseason team selec­tion this season, as she joined
