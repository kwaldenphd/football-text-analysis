'U' newspaper reinstated 
By FLORENTINE HOELKER 
Associate News Editor 
Student government has de­cided to partially reinstate the subscription to the "U" news­paper, said Student Body Presi­dent Rob Pasin. 

Pasin said that the deci6ion was based on the number of calls received on the FRED line concerning whether or not the "U" subscription should in fact be cancelled. 
In a letter published in the October 11 issue of The Ob­server, Pasin and Student Body Vice-President Fred Tombar asked students to call the FRED line and give their opinion whether or not "U" should be cancelled. 
Since it appeared to student government that few students actually read the magazine, Pasin and Tombar thought it would be best to cancel the subscription, but asked first for student input. "The fate of 'U' is up to you," said the letter. 
Pasin said that after the letter was published, there were 73 calls on the FRED line about "U" with 43 in favor of the sub­scription continuing, and 30 opposed. 
"We felt it was the best way to gauge opinion," he said. "We know it's not perfect, but is was the best option open to us." 
Several persons calling the FRED line made helpful sugges­tions, Pasin said, including the possibility of whether student government could get a partial subscription. "We IPasin and Tombarl checked to see if it was feasible. It is, so we'll therefore be getting 'U' only half as frequently as before," said Pasin. 
He added that "U" will no longer be inserted into The Ob-

NO announces staff changes 
Special to The Observer 

Three changes in executive positions at Notre Dame have been announced by William Sexton, vice president for University Relations. 
James Murphy, 66, associate vice president for University Relations, will assume a major planning responsibility for Notre Dame's Sesquicentennial, to be observed from Sept. 1991 to Oct. 1992. 
While assisting Associate Provost Roger Schmitz, who is directing the Sesquicentennial, Murphy will continue to be a consultant to University Relations. 
A 1947 NO graduate who did graduate journalism study at Northwestern University, Murphy became director of public information at Notre Dame in 1952 and headed me­dia relations at the University until assuming his current posi­tion in 1969. 
Before joining the University's staff, he was a news editor for the American Broadcasting Company in Chicago and a public relations representative for the American Legion's national headquarters in 
Off-campus students often face isolation from campus, but find close friendships 
By  KATE  MANUEL  
News Writer  
Although  most individuals  

who move ofT-campus make the movtl with a group of friends, ofT-campus students must often face a sense of isolation from on-campus life and pvents, ac­cording to Cncelia Burger, a se­nior who moved off-campus in thn summer bntween her sophomore and junior years. 
"If you really want to be around people all the time, don't move off-campus. It's re­ally hard to ke11p up with things on campus. You become more independent but you also be­come more dependent on frifmds to keep you up," she said. 
"You rely on friends to make you at home on campus; to give you a home away from horne," Burger said, eiting the help of Tony Bosco, Jim DeMarco, Jim O'Conner, and Brad Fuller of Keenan Hall "for giving me a home away from home away

from home." 
Burger said that she missed the late night talks with her dormmates. She also missed "this fall, when everyone came back and were setting up their rooms, the bonding going on there. You have to make an ef­fort to spend time with your friends. You need to spend ex­tra time doing special things with friends." 
Despite a certain level of iso­lation among off-campus stu­dents, these students often de­velop close friendships with other off-campus students and with neighbors, according to Dave Haymond, a senior who has lived off-campus for three years. 
"It is difficult to get a hold of information about on-campus events. Finding such events takes more searching," he said. "But it would be difficult for me to make the transition to on­campus life now, because after you've been living off-campus for years your friends are off­campus." 
Off-campus representative Mark Bettencourt hopes to see a greater interest in both social and security concerns among off-campus students, and he encourages interested off-cam­pus students to contact himself or Steve Leinenweber to share ideas or to offer help. 
"We've discussed many times with the senior class officers trying to increase off-campus participation in senior class ac­tivities," he said. "But we haven't made a concerted effort to address the social issues be­cause we thought addressing crime was more important." 


Indianapolis. 
Richard Conklin, who has worked in media relations for Notre Dame for 23 years, 21 of them as director, will be pro­moted from assistant to asso­ciate vice president for University Relations and as­sume Murphy's duties. 
Conklin, 54, holds a bache­lor's degree from the University of St. Thomas, St. Paul, Minn., and an M.A. in American Studies from Notre Dame. He came to Notre Dame as an as­sistant director of public in­formation in 1967 and assumed the directorship two years later. He was made an assistant vice president in 1985. 
Before coming to Notre Dame, Conklin was a reporter for the 
St. Louis Post-Dispatch and Minneapolis Star and taught journalism and ran the news bureau at St. Thomas. 
Dennis Moore will be assum­ing Conklin's duties with the ti­tle director of Public Relations and Information. Moore, 42, a member of the Notre Dame Class of 1970, joined the Notre Dame staff in Aug. 1988 as an assistant director in the de­partment he will now head, and he was promoted to associate director in July 1989. 
Moore's previous experience includes 20 years in corporate public relations, marketing and magazine writing and editing. In addition to eight years spent as a freelance writer and con­sultant, he principally worked for Consumers Power Company in Jackson, Mich. and Kiwanis Magazine in Chicago. 

"These changes in responsi­bility assure that our Sesquicentennial celebration will get the experienced atten­tion it deserves while preserv­ing the continuity in public rela­tions at the University which has been a major institutional strength," Sexton said in mak­ing the announcement.

Panel tells students interested in foreign relations to think about graduate school 



, By MARK CAWLEY News Writer 
Interested students who have strong "gut" feelings about get­ting involved in international relations should consider grad­uate studies in international af­fairs, agreed a panel of repre­sentatives from international affairs graduate schools on Tuesday. 
The panel discussion con­cerned the goals of a graduate program in international affairs and the admissions and financial aid procedures in­volved with pursuing such a de­gree. 
The panel stated that, "a de­gree in international affairs is intended to produce efficient and knowledgeable individuals for work in foreign relations." This type of graduate degree also offers an interdisciplinary education in such areas as politics, history, economics, and law, according to the paneL 
The admissions procedures· are similar at most schools of­fering a degree in international affairs, according to Margaret Clark, director of graduate admissions at Princeton University. "First of all, we recommend that you meet all deadlines. We also want to know where you got your inter­est in international affairs and what you want to do with it," Clark said. 
While law schools and medi­cal schools highly emphasize test scores, "we take a more qualitative look at the student," said Clark. "Admissions offi­cers for international affairs degree programs look closely at extra-curricular activities, letters of recommendations, and work experience," she said. 
To help finance an interna­tional affairs degree, "graduate schools look to give you work­study programs and fellow­ships," said MarJean Knokey, assistant dean for admissions at Columbia University. "These programs are usually merit­need based, though," she added. The Financial Aid Form (FAF) is used most often by graduate schools, according to Knokey. "It is also important that if students have any ques­tions that they do not hesitate to call us," she said. 
The graduate schools repre­sented by the panel are mem­bers of the Association of Public Service and International Affairs (APSIA) Schools.

Persecution of homosexuals is wrong, gay teacher says 
By PATRICK NINNEMAN 
News Writer 
Homosexual activities are not 
immoral or inherently harmful 
to society, and therefore the 
persecution of homosexuals is 
unjust according to Richard 
Mohr. 

Mohr is an openly gay profes­sor of philosophy at the Uni­versity of Illinois and an award winning author. 
According to Mohr, nearly 2/5 of all men have had an orgas­mic homosexual experience, and homosexuals are involved in all levels of society. He stated that "homosexuals are your friends, ministers, teach­ers, office mate, roommate, Congressional representative, your spouse." 
Mohr argued that the stereo­types surrounding gays and lesbians are irrational reactions designed to uphold societal norms and shift blame for social problems from their ac­tual sources to outside sources. Mohr stated that "the stereo­type of child molester functions by giving the family unit a false screen of innocence ... and keeps the unit from being examined too closely for child molesta­tion, incest or wife battering." 
Mohr refuted those who ar­gue that homosexuality is im­moral. He argued that social customs and norms are no ba­sis for morality, rather these customs are only descriptive aspects of society. This line of reasoning, according to Mohr, would justify the atrocities of Nazi Germany, for religious persecution was widely ac­cepted under the Nazi regime. 
The Bible makes no moral condemnation of homosexuality according to Mohr. He stated that Christ made no mention of homosexuality, and that Old Testament references need to be examined in the context of ancient times. He said "Sodom and Gomorrah is becoming in­creasingly recognized as a con­demnation of inhospitality." Mohr pointed out that Lot, although he condemned homo­sexuality, participated in inces­tuous rape, but his tacit accep­tance of incest or rape does not morally justify such actions. 
According to Mohr, homosex­uality is not unnatural, rather it is common in nature. He cited the existence of other human societies where homosexuality is actually encouraged as a rite of maturation. Also, he argued that there is no one specific function for any of our organs, and therefore the sole design of our genitals is not procreation. "If the only design of our mouths is for eating, does that mean we should not use it for talking?" asked Mohr. 
Yet all these charges lead to discrimination and persecution against homosexuals, according to Mohr. He said that "the most severe form of abuse towards gays is queerbashing, where attackers will physically beat a gay person, sometimes until they are dead." These attacks, according to Mohr, often go without punishment because of the high levels of animosity towards homosexuals in society, even in courts of law. 
Job discrimination runs ram­pant against homosexuals, said Mohr, as exemplified by the routine discharge of gays and lesbians from military service. These expulsions are clearly examples of discrimination, said Mohr, for no regard is given to the homosexuals actual job performance. 
Some argue that acceptance of gays and lesbians in society will destroy the family unit and eventually society itself. Mohr argued that some states' strong laws protecting homosexuality have disproved that theory. In such states, the protection of homosexuals have in no way eroded the family or society as a whole, according to Mohr. 
America would be a better place if homosexuality were an accepted lifestyle, said Mohr. 
"All gay's and lesbian's ener­gies could be directed towards socially useful purposes, rather than towards fear of persecu­tion," he said.

Tenacity can help women and foreigners beat workforce obstacles, Sekaran says 
By ANNA MARIE TABOR 
News Writer 
Being both a woman and a foreigner makes it difficult to succeed in business, but tenac­ity and competency can over­come any discrimination in the workforce, said Uma Sekaran, an international business scholar. 
Sekaran, speaking at a lec­ture/discussion on international business in Stapleton Lounge at Saint Mary's, discussed her work experiences and difficul­ties in coming to the United States from India for a job. 
Competition for jobs in India was fierce since "there were very few women working in any organization" but Sekaran's in­telligence, and seriousness granted her career advance­ment. Furthermore, she com­mented, "When all is said and done, it is a male-dominated culture everywhere. We have to learn to live with a delicate balance-there is a place for everyone." 
"In 1971, I applied for a visa and came to Manhattan with $3000 in my pocket. I came here thinking that I could get a job as easily as in India-that my success in business would transfer," Sekaran recalled. 
One obstacle she had to over­come was the discrimination against her traditional Indian dress. At Logics International in New York Sekaran was hired for the job but later was asked to change to Western style of clothing. Suited in native attire at the meeting, Sekaran stressed, "I have nothing against how you dress, but I don't want to be told what to wear." 
Sekaran, who works in Women's Advanced Placement at Southern Illinois University, has discovered that outward appearances are not nearly as important as competency. "I don't care what gender, race, or religion you are. If you're competent, it comes through at some stage," she stated. 
Pat Washington, professor of sociology, anthropology, and social studies at Saint Mary's, recognizes competence in Saint Mary's students. 
Washington said that Saint Mary's women in Notre Dame classes are "usually the ones who will challenge a professor, speak out in class, and are assertive" because of their leadership encouragement as women. 
Sekaran has recorded much progress in her department. "I think we have achieved a lot for women on campus. Since 1988, the women graduates have got­ten a considerably higher per­centage increase in salaries than men." 
Being a staunch advocator of female competency, Sekaran said she "would love to teach at Saint Mary's some day." She continued by expressing her concern that students "have a very sheltered life here and don't know what the business world it like." 
Jerry McElroy, professor of economics, agreed. "Our stu­dents don't get the 'real world' experience, but that is where Saint Mary's tradition comes in. From the active alumni, our students have access to them and gain insights into the busi­ness world." 
A ~onsensus was reached by the panel that there are some things that cannot be learned in a classroom. Sekaran stated that especially for women in the business world "sexual ha­rassment is a fact of life." As unfortunate as it may seem, "There is no way to be pre­pared for unpleasant circum­stances." 
Ravi Parashar, from the de­partment of business adminis­tration, said, "I think that one of the greatest things to see in the Saint Mary's women is the growth in self-confidence. With confidence, you can react better under tough situations, like sexual harassment." 
Sekaran's advice to women in the business world is: "Be flexi­ble!" In the rapidly changing market most college students realize that it is to their advan­tage to know what they want out of life, but not always to follow a rigid plan, she said. 
When it comes to international business, flexibility must go even further. Sekaran spoke from experience. "When you go to a foreign country, you need to know all job opportunities, what the requirements are, how many women are there, and how they are treated. Do your homework!" 
Sekaran has degrees from Bombay University, the Univer­sity of Connecticut, and UCLA. She has published seven books and written numerous journal articles. 
The lecture/discussion was brought to Saint Mary's by the Gathering Voices Series.

Calmeyn asks this University to consider this philosophy be­cause of its sincere commitment to the truth.

Should this University call upon Rand instead of the Gospels, upon Nietzsche instead of Augustine, we would have to raze the esc. all of our social help programs, send the minorities "back to where they came from", etc. The danger and selfishness of the philosophy can be ap­praised quite easily. It is for those who are caught up in this that we fear. 
Rand has inspired "objectivist" clubs around the country, which gather around and talk of how the superficial society is selling themselves short and giving of themselves. There is no humility before the truth -love of ego is the truth for them. 
I once picked up a book by Rand, and, after a period in which it seemed like it was me against the world, was able to identify with this character. That I was open to Rand's thought for any period shows how vulnerable humankind is. Not until I took the eyes off of the self and tried to become truly "objective" did I realize that truth cannot be found in such an imperfection as hu­mankind. Not until I tried to become rationally aware of others did I realize that there is that Truth which is above and beyond ego. 
Call it Ego, God or Love, hu­mankind has realized that it lacks, it needs something to make it whole. There are five billion of us here, and then there is Truth. The mystery of the Cross cannot be explained away so simply.

"What they meant was they wanted to win them all, and just let us win it all one time and we did that and I found out that wasn't really what they meant, what they meant was win them all, all the time. And after we did that, that wasn't good enough, they wanted to win big."

friend says there was some­
thing about Howard Hall in the 
Chicago Tribune," recalled 
Kolodziej. "I picked my tray 
right up and ran back to my 
room, and there was a little 
story about it. Since then, there 
have been calls from all kinds 
of papers, and it's been kind of 
fun." 

Fun, but the stories were in­
correct. All the papers claimed 
the autograph read, "Best 
wishes to all my fans... " The 
true signature read, "To my 
fans in Howard Hall-Best of 
Luck," signed, "Howard Hall." 
Before the Tribune had it, 
Clemson's weekly sports 
magazine (similar to Notre 
Dame's Blue & Gold Illustrated) 
ran a short blurb about it. 
Kolodziej also said newspapers 
such as the Atlanta Journal 
and Los Angles Times had

SPORTS BRIEFS 
The Notre Dame Sailing Team will be conducting a football concession stand this weekend in front of Dillon Hall. They will be selling food, "The Cause" t-shirts, as well as their own team t-shirts. 
Irish Insanity will hold an officer's meeting in room 304 St. Edward's Hall tonight at 7 p.m.

news snippets. Even the mighty Sports Illustrated included a paragraph on it. 
In Howard's next interhall football game, CBS turned up to televise parts of it and include it in a Saturday pregame show for one of CBS's featured games. 
"I thought the whole thing was a cute idea and a lot of fun, but I never had any idea it would skyrocket," said Kolodziej. 
Having received word that CBS would be at the game, Howard had an unusually large amount of spectators. The game was against Lyons, and at the time Howard's record was 1-1. 
Six particularly devoted Howard (or national television) fans came to the game wearing t-shirts that, when put together in a line, spelled H-0-W-A-R-D. On the backs of the shirts, four together spelled H-A-L-L. Two particularly maniacal fans, Bob McAuliffe and Mike "Doyle" Ol­son, ran about, parading an eye-straining banner that read "HOWARD CHICKS RULE." 
Howard won. 
The disappointing note to this 
story is that the CBS represen­tative told Kolodziej that the network ran the sequence on Howard Hall in last Saturday's pregame show, without telling Kolodziej. They will, however, send her a tape. 
Mter the game against Lyons, Kolodziej and her friends were interviewed by a CBS television reporter. 
"With the camera coming and the interview, it was by far one of the best games we've played," says Kolodziej. "We've played well ever since." 
Howard is now 4-1 and going to the playoffs. The week after it beat Lyons, it played Off­Campus and pulled ofT another tough victory. 
The South Carolina Howard 
Hall is proud of his fan club. 
"I hope that my little picture­party motivated them," said Hall, who also sent the team 100 sticker-patches of the Clemson Tiger claw. "I'm happy to hear they're winning. Tell them good luck and I hope they go all the way." 
Now that the nation knows 
about this little episode, maybe 
more Howard Hall football 
players will step forward to 
claim their portion of the 
Howard Hall fan club.

The playoff format for men's interhall football remains the same as last year's, with the top two teams from each league making the postseason. NVA had discussed the possibility of adding extra wild­card qualifiers, but rejected the idea. 
"We decided against granting wild-cards because there are just not enough teams in any one division to justify doing so," said Lloyd Cochran, stu­dent supervisor of men's foot­ball at NVA. "We are afraid, if we have wild-cards, we may end up having a team with a losing record making the playoffs." 
Only the second-place teams from the Leahy and Parseghian Leagues have yet to be deter­mined. Here is a look at the teams still in the hunt, and their prospects: 
LEAHY 
Keenan (1-1-1): The Knights must beat Alumni, and then have Stanford either lose to Zahm or win by 12 points less than Keenan's margin over the Dogs. 

Stanford (1-1-1): The Studs need Keenan to lose for a real­istic chance at earning a berth. If Keenan loses, Stanford must defeat Zahm. If the Knights win, Stanford must by 13+ points more than Keenan beats Alumni. 
Zahm (1-2): If Alumni beats Keenan, and Zahm beats Stan­ford, Zahm is in. 
PARSEGHIAN 

Off-Campus (2-1): A win over Dillon clinches a playoff spot. If the Crime lose to the Big Red, it must be by six or less points, and Flanner must beat Morris­sey so that OfT-Campus wins a three-way tie-breaker on point differentials. 
Dillon (1-2): A win over the Crime by seven or more points clinches the Big Red a berth. A victory margin of six or less points on Wednesday means Morrissey must beat Planner on Thursday for Dillon to advance. 
Fox was stopped an inch from the goal line. Cavanaugh's points came on a safety when Stanford was called for clipping in the end zone. 
"We did everything we were supposed to except put it in," said coach Ken Cotter. "We got the ball twice inside their 10 .. 
and just couldn't convert." 
Zahm defeated Keenan 8-6 in the other Leahy contest. With the Knights' loss, Alumni clinched the Leahy champi­onship. 
Zahm scored after Pete Knight's fumble at the Keenan eight. Knight caught the swing pass from Mike Maier, and while fighting for extra yards, was gang-tackled and the ball popped loose. Pat McAndrew recovered for Zahm, and two plays later, Matt Lahey's five­yard completion to Paul Kell and Matt Seng's two-point con­version made it 8-0. 
Keenan took the ensuing kickoff and answered Zahm's score with one of its own. Dave Deltoro ran six yards for the touchdown. Going for two, Del­tore was stopped at the line of scrimmage. Refusing to give up, he pitched back to Maier, who ran around right end, but was brought down just outside the end zone. 
"I think the key was being ahead in the game and stopping them on the two-point conver­sion," said Zahm coach Dan Stopar. "They had to come from behind, and we were able to

prepare and adjust for it at 
halftime." 
ROCKNE LEAGUE 
Sorin clinched the Rockne championship with a 6-3 victory over Pangborn. The Violence scored first as they took the opening kickoff down to the Otter 10. After a clipping penalty was called on Pangborn on first down, the Otter defense held, and John Jacobs kicked a 38-yard field goal. 
Sorin came back and scored on the opening drive of the sec­ond half when Kevin Kramer completed a 45-yard touch­down pass to Vic Lombardi. The Otter defense then took over to preserve the victory. 
"There's a definite excitement in making the playoffs," said Otter coach Kramer, "but there is also a disappointment in how we played the last two weeks. We're definitely good enough to go all the way, but we just haven't played well." 
"My goal now is to get the freshmen some experience," said Violence coach Rob Thom­son. He especially praised the efforts of freshmen center John O'Rourke, quarterback Justin Sage, and tailback Paul Zachlin. Thomson feels that if the 14 freshmen keep improving, by the time they're seniors, they'll be top contenders for the inter­hall championship. 
Fisher earnerl the Rockne League's second-place berth by coming from behind and defeat­ing St. Edward's 17-15. St. Ed's scored first on Bill Hozel's 10­yard run in the first quarter; Kevin Huie added the PAT. 
Right before halftime, the Green Wave struck back. They drove 70 yards, capping it off when Rick Ebert found Renzy Smith in the back left corner of the end zone from 20 yards out to make the halftime score 7-6. 
Fisher quickly went ahead 14-7 after halftime. Ebert scrambled 35 yards on the first play of the half, and on the next play, Mitch Green took a pitch, swept right, cut back against the grain and sprinted 30 yards for the touchdown. Ebert threw to Green for the two-point con­version. 
St. Edward's retook the lead when it stopped Ebert's fake punt attempt at the Green Wave 
40. Erik Marsh finished the drive with a five-yard run, and after Mike Musty's PAT run, St Ed's led 15-14 with 5:00 left. 
Fisher then drove from its own 20 after an unsportsman­like conduct penalty, keyed by a 20-yard run by Gene Richards and two Ebert-to-Smith con­nections. to the St. Edward's 15. With eight seconds left, Dan McGahn's 31-yard field goal try against the wind barely cleared the crossbar. and Fisher had the victory. 
"Even with our loss to Sorin," said Green Wave coach Ebert, "overall it's been a pretty fun season, and I'm glad it's not over yet."

A's, having their offensive support and bullpen to back him. Dave Stewart (22-11, 2.56) once again is victimized by hav­ing a great year, yet not the best year among all AL pitchers. Dennis Eckersley (4-2, 0.61, 48 saves) had another excellent season, but was not the best rnliever in the league. 
The competition comes down to two non-Oakland pitchers, Hoger Clemens (21-6, 1.93, 209 SO) of Boston and Bobby Thigpen (4-6, 1.83, major league record 57 saves) of the White Sox. The determining factor in my choice is that Thig­pen's season was record­breaking, one-of-a-kind, while Clemens' was outstanding, but almost expected of him by HOW; because of his greatness, the extraordinary becomes somewhat ordinary. So, my pick is Thigpen. CY YOUNG TOP 10:

ROOKIE OF THE YEAR: Kansas City's Kevin Appier (12­8, 2.76 ERA [fourth in the AL]) wins my vote over tough com­petition from Cleveland's Sandy Alomar, Jr. (.290, 9 HR, 66 RBI) and New York's Kevin Maas (.252, 21 HR, 41 RBI). ROOKIE TOP 10: 1. Appier 2. Alomar, Jr

MVP: Bonds or Bonilla? 
Bonilla or Bonds? Nothing against Ryne Sandberg of the Cubs (.306, 40 HR. 100 RBI, 25 SB), Darryl Strawberry of the Mets (.277, 37 HR, 108 RBI) and Eddie Murray of Los Angeles (.330, 26 HR. 95 RBI), but Barry Bonds (.301, 33 HR, 114 RBI, 52 SB) and Bobby Bonilla (.280, 32 HR. 120 RBI) of the Pittsburgh Pirates are the two most logical choices for this years MVP. I give the edge to Bonds because: 
a) Bonilla had the luxury of having Bonds hitting behind Strawberry and Murray (tie) 6. Doug Drabek, Pittsburgh 7. Chris Sabo, Cincinnati 8. Matt Williams, San Francisco 9. Ramon Martinez, Los Angeles 
10. Ron Gant. Atlanta. 
CY YOUNG: Again, several worthy candidates. Frank Viola of New York (20-12, 2.67) will get plenty of support, and for good reason: he was the best left-bander in the NL this year. Ramon Martinez of the Dodgers (20-6, 2.92, 223 SO [second in NL]) quietly assumed Orel Hershiser's role as ace of the lA rotation, holding the staff together and keeping the Dodgers in the NL West pennant chase. John ·Franco was the NL's best closer, notching 33 saves for the Mets. However, Doug Drabek (22-6, 2. 76) led a mediocre-talent­wise-Pittsburgh staff by example to a third-best staff

Women's IH football heats up 
Top eight teams will match-up in November playoffs 
By CHAD WISHCHUK Sports Writer 
The 1990 Women's Interhall Football regular season was completed Tuesday night at Cartier Field, setting the stage for the long-awaited play-offs to determine this years new pigskin queens. 
Following a 6-0 squeaker past Lyons Hall, Breen-Philips captured the coveted regular­season championship with an unblemished record of five vic­tories and no defeats, making them the team to beat in November. Katherine Mapother, captain of the Blitz, leads her "psyched-up" gridders into the play-offs. 
"I hope we play the same in­tense, exciting football that we've been playing all year," said Mapother. 
Staring down B. P. 's throats in the six-member Gold League is defending champion Howard Hall, who rode a string of four straight shutout wins into sec­ond place after an opening sea­son loss to No. 1 B.P. Off­Campus (3-2) put a giant ex­clamation point on their season with a 14-0 win over Badin (1­
4) Tuesday night to vault the Black Plague into the play-offs. Tight ends Michelle· Richards and Liz Nolan caught long bombs from quarterback Jill Bodensteiner to score for the Plague while Jennifer Salmon added the two-point conversion after Nolan's touchdown. 
Lyons will also be represented in post-season competition, fin­ishing their campaign at 2-3 behind leading scorer Maura Long. 
In the Blue Division, Farley's Finest and Lewis Hall blasted to a deadlock at the top spot. Both squads boast a 4-1 record heading into their play-off games. Farley's defense gave up only one TO all season long. Lewis' sole upset came at the hands of Farley by only six points. In the first round of play-offs, interhall fans will also see a 3-2 P.W. team, coming off a huge 20-6 shellacking of Knott (1-4), and the P.E. Pyros (2-3). 

The four winners of opening round play-off games on November 4 will advance to the semifinals the following Sunday. The Championship Final will be held at Cartier Field on Sunday afternoon, November 18.

Former Hurricanes want Miami to beat Notre Dame 
CORAL GAHLES, Fla. lAP)­
The Miami Hurricanes ex­pect a lot of phone calls from around the NFL this week. 
They're sure to hear from Bernard Clark in Cincinnati and Melvin Bratton in Denver. Alonzo Highsmith in Dallas and Cortez Kennedy in Seattle will call too. And Steve Walsh might reach out from his new area code in New Orleans. 
The ex-Hurricanes all know their alma mater plays Saturday at No. 6 Notre Dame. 
"The great thing about this 

program that's different from any other place I've been or seen," coach Dennis Erickson said, "is the closeness of the ex-players with the program and the players that are here. There's a real strong bond." 
Former Hurricanes tele­phone Erickson's office, the players' dorms or the training room. Current 'Canes say the callers provide motivation when the upcoming game is against a weak team and bolster confidence when the next opponent is, say, Notre Dame.

"We knew we had problems with the defensive secondary coming into the (Michigan) game. We knew that. Losing (cornerback) Todd Lyght very early did not help the situation either," Holtz says. 
"We've had trouble against the pass," he continues. "I think that we've given up a lot of big plays, a lot of the yardage running comes when the individual breaks the line of scrimmage and continues to run. The difference is that our front seven is not playing too badly."

''I'd hear9 so much about the Oakland 1\s. Going into today's game, I had hoped what hap­pened would happen," Rijo said. 
Stewart, meanwhile, was wild from the start and lasted only four innings. Baseball's best big-game pitcher had his worst postseason appearance ever. 
"The only pitch that failed me was my fastball," he said. "You just have to keep going and hope you're able to gain con­trol." 
It was Eric Davis who got the big hit, not Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire or the rest of Oakland's bruisers. 
Davis, Cincinnati's slumping star who has been bothered by a sore left shoulder and aching wrists and ankles, pierced the 1\s aura right away with a two­run homer in the first inning. 
"I was fortunate to get off to a good start, and everybody kept going," he said. "When I'm healthy and swing the bat well, I drive in a lot of runs and that takes the pressure off ev­erybody." 
It was Billy Hatcher who pro­vided the spark, not Rickey Henderson.

Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz is concerned about the Irish defense. especially the secondary, going into Saturday's game. 
The real Howard Hall supports dorm team 
It seems that the Howard Hall interhall football team has a new favorite player, and it's not Raghib Ismail, Chris Zorich or Rick Mirer. 
The new choice athlete, and he has been the favorite for weeks now, is Clemson running back Howard Hall, whose name in lights would be quite a pro­paganda boost for the dorm by the same name on campus. 
But the team has not been watching at a distance. Thanks 
to Howard resident Kelly Kolodziej (that's KOHL-jay, brethren), 
Howard Hall and Howard Hall are big fans of each other, and the 
news has spread across the nation. 

"I called home on the day of the Clemson-Virginia football 
game," said Kolodziej, "and my dad said, 'Hey, there's a guy 
named Howard Hall for Clemson.' I knew someone at (Notre 
Dame) Sports Information who could get anything, so I called 
him." 

That someone at Sports Information was student a~sistant 
Derek Mohr, who went to Assistant Sports Information Director 
Rose Pietrzak. Pietrzak, who used to work in the Atlantic Athletic 
Conference, called Clemson Sports Information Director Tim 
Burret and within five days, the surprised Kolodziej had an 
autographed photo of Clemson's Howard Hall. 
That's only the beginning of the story. 
"A couple days later I was sitting in the dining hall and my

CINCINNATI (AP) -The A's aren't invincible, after all. 
The Cincinnati Reds shocked Oakland and maybe even them­selves Tuesday night, routing the Athletics 7-0 in Game 1 of the World Series. 
It was Jose Rijo who was awesome, not Dave Stewart. 
Rijo, a former Athletics prospect, pitched seven shutout innings and ended Oakland's 1 0-game winning streak in the postseason. 

These guys will win postseason awards 
As the 1990 baseball season comes 
to a close, it becomes time once 
again to speculate on who will the Rene Ferran 
post-season awards. While I don't Sports Writer 
get an official vote, here are my 
choices for the accolades. 
AMERICAN LEAGUE 
MVP: The choice comes down to two players: Oakland's 
Rickey Henderson (.325 BA, .439 OBA, 28 HR, 65 SB) and 
Detroit's Cecil Fielder (.277 BA, 51 HR, 132 RBI). While 
Henderson had an outstanding season, and is the consum­
mate leadoff batter, the A's most likely would have won the 
AL West without him. The Tigers without Fielder, however, 
would have been battling the Yankees for the division cellar 
rather than improving 20 games from their 1989 record, 
and maintaining sight of the pennant-they finished nine 
games back overall. Isn't this the definition of a most valu­
able player? Thus, Fielder is my choice, but just barely. MVP 
TOP 10: 1. Fielder 2. Henderson 3. Kelly Gruber, Toronto 4. 
Bobby Thigpen, Chicago 5. Roger Clemens, Boston 6. Fred 
McGriff, Toronto 7. Ellis Burks, Boston 8. Ken Griffey, Jr, 
Seattle 9. Bob Welch, Oakland 10. George Brett, Kansas City. 
CY YOUNG: Again, a close decision. Bob Welch of Oakland 
had a career season, going 27-6 with a 2.95 ERA (the most 
wins in the AL since Denny McLain in 1968). However, Welch, 
like Storm Davis a year ago, benefitted from pitching for the

After week four of the men's interhall football season, the races for the league champi­onships are over. Grace, Alumni, and Sorin have won the titles of their respective divisions, while Fisher has clinched the second berth from the Rockne League. 
PARSEGHIAN LEAGUE 
Grace won its first league title in over a decade by trouncing archrival Flanner 21-0. On its second play from scrimmage after holding Flanner on its ini­tial possession, Steve Homan and Jeff Abbott opened a huge hole in the line, and Joe Mi­nadeo turned a straight dive play into a 60-yard touchdown run. Bob Sweeney added the PAT, and quickly it was 7-0. 
With two minutes remaining in the first half, Grace made it 14-0 on Jim Kossler's 40-yard pass to Jeff Burns, and Sweeney's kick. Grace iced the victory early in the fourth quar­ter when Kossler found Tim
