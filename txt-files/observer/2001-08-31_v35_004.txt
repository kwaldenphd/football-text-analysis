Soaking up spirit 
Alumni create bright yellow towels to unify football crowds 
By JASON McFARLEY 
News Editor 
Mike Costin and Jim Humbert aren't interested in beginning a revolution. 
For the University graduates and business partners. shaking things up a bit inside Notre Dame Stadium will do. 
"Sometimes it's tough getting people to rally behind some­thing," Humbert said. "I wouldn't even know how to start a movement." 
But from offices in their Mishawaka advertising special­ty company, Costin and Humbert are quietly, and maybe unknowingly, inspiring change -one 12-by-17-inch piece of fabric at a time. 
In response to the football game last fall that turned Notre Dame stadium -and Irish fans' faces -red, Costin and Humbert have designed a towel that the men say will help the Irish take back their field. The small, gold-colored towel is emblazoned in blue lettering with the simple directive: "Play like a champion today." 
"The idea grew out of the fact that so much attention was given to the game last year. Surely there were more Irish fans there than Nebraska fans, but every third or fourth red shirt seemed to blend togeth­er," Costin said of the so-called "sea of red" phenomenon last year when Notre Dame lost before a home crowd laden with Nebraska fans in red attire. 
The apparent choice of Notre Dame faculty and alumni to sell their tickets to Nebraska fans dealt an embarrassing blow to school spirit.

Philbin plans to visit campus next week 
By JASON McFARLEY 
News Editor 
Regis Philbin is expected to visit the University next week for a ground-breaking ceremony for a major arts center that the television personality has helped under­write, Notre Dame officials said Thursday. 
University administrators are still negoti­ating with Philbin's spokespeople to deter­mine when he will appear next week and what his role in the ground-breaking ser­vice at the Marie P. DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts will be, according to Dennis Brown, Notre Dame's associate 
director of public relations and information. Earlier this year. Philbin. a 1953 Notre 
Dame graduate, made a $2.75-million gift to his alma mater to fund a studio theater in the 
arts center. Philbin is the host of the popular nationally broadcast shows "Live! With Regis and Kelly" and "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" He is the father of 1996 University graduate Jennifer Philbin and third-year Notre Dame law student Joanna 

Philbin. 
The center will cost at least $50· million and is being underwritten in part by a $33­million gift from the late Edward DeBartolo. The building is expected to open in 2003. 
Named in honor of DeBartolo's late wife, the center is currently the last announced addition to the DeBartolo Quad. The arts complex will join DeBartolo Hall, the Mendoza College of Business and the Hcsburgh Center for International Studies on the quad.

FlipSide sponsors concert 
By ERIN LaRUFFA 
News Writer 
Two years ago, members of FlipSide decided to plan a con­cert for the first weekend of the 2000-2001 school year. 
However, members of the club, which sponsors alcohol­free events every weekend, real­ized that they could not create the type of event they envi­sioned without some help. After delaying the event for a year, FlipSide members will finally see their vision become a reality tonight in the Joyce Center. The concert features four bands: Right Hand Side, Nine Days, SR­71 and They Might Be Giants. 
"FlipSide began planning this two years ago for a year ago, but it became too daunting a task," said Notre Dame junior Michael Rampolla, co-chair of Flipstock. 
Saint Mary's student Sarah Hoshaw and Holy Cross student Amelia Marcum also co-chaired the event. 
The concert, called Flipstock, is free of charge and open to students with Notre Dame, Saint Mary's or Holy Cross IDs. 
Clubs, dorms and depart­ments from all three schools joined forces with FlipSide to plan Flipstock. 
"We want it to be an event for all three campuses," Rampolla said. "We got student input to find out who would put on a good live show." 
He added that the bands were also selected based on their availability for the concert date and whether concert sponsors could come up with enough funds to pay the bands. Rampolla said he and his fellow FlipSide members hope Flipstock will show students that there are alternatives to drinking on weekends. 
"It's the first weekend night of school," Rampolla said, adding that the concert's date was not picked specifically to draw stu­dents away from drinking events. 
"If that's one of the effects, then I think we've accomplished the goal of showing students there are other things to do,'' Rampolla said. 
"This concert is a big way to do what we normally try to do," said Rampolla. "We want to hit students that first weekend, when freshmen are setting their social patterns. We want to

And then, at hand camp ... 
Despite the horrible reference to American Pie, I happen t.o be one ofthose Bandos, you know, the people who love their school's band -live and breathe it, whether they're in the band or not. I happen to fall in the unfortunate category of"not," and not for a lack oftrying on 
my part. 
I first tried out for band as a sophomore (my parents fell for the great myth that the band leaves no time for study­ing when I was a freshman). I was cut. I came back as a junior and, again, was cut. So I said, I have nothing to lose 

and everything to gain ifI try out one more. one last time. Angela Campos 
Ifyou're superstitious. you hear things like third time's a Lab Tech charm, bad things come in 
threes, and three strikes ­
you're out. I'm not superstitious, but that's how I 
felt. 
I was the only senior trying out for a first shot at the band. I gave the band everything I had this year -I gave my heart and soul, held nothing back. God must have greater plans for me, because for the third time, I was cut. 
I love the Band oft.he Fighting Irish. I always will. Some people dream about coming to Notre Dame to play football. I came with a dream t.o play in the marching band. I guess that not all dreams are meant to come true. 
So what am I going to do now ... ? The question doesn't haunt me the way it would did my sopho­more year. For starters, I bought my student season football tickets. I work at The Obseiver. I'm on the Oub Coordination Council. I fence. I sing at Keough Mass. So I know I'm going to be okay, despite get­ting cut on the highly competitive clarinet. 
What I'd like to know, though, is what other peo­ple thought ofme. Did I help someone try harder? Encourage them to be more enthusiastic? Did they think I was some bando-freak that didn't know when she was over her head? Maybe even nuts? 
I know that I had lots of people rooting for me. They all knew how much I wanted to make it. It feels good to know I had people supporting me, wanting me to be a part ofthe program. I know the competition was stiff, and they take only the best. It won't injure me any to admit I'm not the best. But I'll always wonder "Why not me?" 
I'll always cherish the days I was part of the Notre Dame Band ofthe Fighting Irish-all 12 of them. Each one helped me grow a little, to be a big­ger person, a better person. I t.ook on fear, every time I checked the roster at the end of band camp. I found camaraderie in my audition group. I chal­lenged myself to work harder and be better than I thought I could be and do what I thought I could not. 
There are some things I'll never do. I'll never trot out through the tunnel or hike step across the field, march out on Fridays and game days or play the concert on the steps. 
But I will always have my memories. Thank you for giving me 12 days to be a part ofthe band. For letting me march out with you. For letting me learn your cheers. For making me feel welcome when I was with you. 
So, listen for me in the stands, I'll be the loudest fan there, shouting my heart out, cheering you on ... Because even though I never actually made the band, I'll always be there with all ofmy heart and soul.

New CIO looks to create strategic vision for OIT 
By ANDREW THAGARD 
News Wricer 
Gordon Wishon. who was involved in the logistics of infor­mation technology support dur­ing Desert Storm. tackles his new job as Chief Information 
Officer for N o t r e Dame with the same ambitious approach that char­acterized his Air 


F O r c e Wishon career. Wishon assumed the newly created position of CIO. which manages 150 full-time OIT employees and an annual budget of $17 million Aug. 1. He has served as CIO of the Air Force Institute of Technology in Dayton. Ohio and more recently at the Georgia Institute of Technology for seven and a half years. His goal is "to not only pro­vide direction to OIT but to pro­vide strate­gic direction See Also to the

port the administra­tive needs of the institution," he said. 
Although he has only been in his office for a week. Wishon is beginning to formulate a new strategic plan for information technology that will guide Notre Dame through the next decade. The plan is tentatively due out in July. 
"We're going to be taking a close look at the organization ... evaluating our ability to meet ever growing demands," he said. 
Wishon is in the process of 
meeting with University vice 
presidents and deans, and he 
intends to discuss issues sur­
rounding information technolo­
gy with students and faculty as 
well. 
Wishon wanL'i to increase the 
University's ability to keep pace 
with advances in technology as 
well as addressing recurring 
problems facing OfT including 
Internet outages and e-mail 
problems. He intends to make 
security and employee recruit­
ment priorities. 
"Recruiting and _retaining 
qualified professionals is one of 
the primary challenges that 
higher education faces,'' he 
added. 
Wishon commended the 
University's ability to recruit 
top ranking students and facul­
ty but believes Notre Dame 
should work equally hard to 
attract the very best staff in 
information technology. 
"A very complex t_echnology 
environment requires a very 
good staff." he said. "Recruiting 
is an essential component of 
the overall strategy." 
In the future, Wishon also 
hopes to secure a faster, more 
reliable Internet connection for 
Notre Dame, but that will be 
difficult because of the infra­.structure in the area. 
"The major fiber pads just 
don't go through South Bend," 
he said. 
Wishon sees many challenges 
facing him. but he is confidant 
that these problems can be 
worked out. 
"Each incoming class has a 
higher expectation of Notre 
Dame when they come. 
Keeping ahead of that demand 
is extremely challenging and 
it's the most exciting part of my 
job," he said. "It's going to be a 
busy few years."

Printing charge instituted 
By HELENA PAYNE 
Assistam Ncws Editor 
. Printing will cost 10 cents a page after first 1000 sheets 
The University recently ended the period of free and unlimited printing, requiring students who print more than 1,000 sheets of paper a year in University computer clusters to pay 10 cents per sheet. 
All students have begun the 2001-2002 school year with a balance of 1.000 sheets of paper. allocated by the University, which can be printed from a cluster. The Office of Information Technologies (OIT) will deduct the number of pages students print each time they use the clusters· print­ers. When the balance reaches zero, the charges begin. 
· "Obviously somebody has to pay for any service in the community." said Larry Rapagnani, assistant provost of OIT, referring to the University's decision. "You benefit from services ren­dered when you pay tuition." 


The printing fee may alle­viate some of the printing queue back-ups that occur when large documents are printed. Students may be more judicious with their printing choices now that they can incur charges. 
Although he lives off cam­pus, senior Matt Peters fre­quently stops in computer clusters because of the con­venience, but has been annoyed by people who print a large number of pages. 
"A lot of times, you'll go up there and people are print­ing 100 slides," said Peters. "Hopefully, it will alleviate

This year, the Office of Information Technologies is charging students 10 cents a sheet for these print jobs after a student has exceeded 1000 sheets printed during the academic year. 
really long lines." 

According to Rapagnani, University statistics showed that over 80 percent of stu­dents print less than 1,000 sheets of paper in an acade­mic year. He added that the limit could cause people to be more careful about their printing habits in the com­puter clusters.

"Any service that appears 
to be limitless people will 
consume rather readily," 
Rapagnani. 
Some students. like sopho­
more Christina Martini, said 
the 1000-sheet limit appears 
worse than it is. 
"One thousand pages seems like a lot," Martini said. "But I guess it depends on your major." 
Another student, junior Erin Riley, uses the clusters' printers only occasionally, but has already had prob­lems with the new rules. 
"I got charged for printing pieces of paper that didn't coine out properly." Riley said. 
The printing stations cur­rently only record what has been printed, whether or not the pages have anything on them or if they print correct­ly. 
"I think it would be fair to have some kind of compen­sation for any malfunction that takes away from your balance," Riley said. "They're not taking money away from your pockets, but they're trying to take it away from a balance." 
All of the campus comput­er clusters have a detailed description of the new guide­lines. 
According to Rapagnani. the new rule is similar to those of the University's peer institutions. 
Rapagnani will meet with the Graduate Student Union later to discuss their con­cerns on the issue. Rapagnani said the grad stu­dents have expressed greater concerns with the new charges than under­
graduates.

school spirit. 
Following the Sept. 9 Irish loss to Nebraska, and again after Oregon State defeated the team at the Fiesta Bowl Jan. 1, Costin and Humbert began formulating a game plan of sorts. 
"We decided to make this kind of a mission. We want­ed to use this as a catalyst, something that would make a big difference in recaptur­
ing our home field," said 1972 graduate Hum-bert, owner and president of AP Image Team, Inc. 
"We start­ed thinking about what we could have to bond every­one togeth­er," added Costin, a 1979 alum­nus, who also serves as company president. 
"/ think that a lot of people around here want to promote the school, and I think {the towels] would be a great way to do it. It would do a great deal to promote school spirit." 
Brian Moscona Student body vice-president 
"This is the most natural thing we can think of." 
The towels easily could appeal to the campus com­munity, said Brian Moscona, student body vice president. 
"I think that a lot of people around here want to pro­mote the school, anlj I think that would be a great way to do it," Moscona said. "It would do a great deal to pro-· mote school spirit." 
Costin and Humbert con­

tacted Moscona this summer about the interest student groups might have in the inspiring merchandise. In the past, Moscona had worked with the company to create T-shirts for Stanford Hall and the 2003 class council. 
In fact, API has found a loyal clientele in University student clubs and athletic squads seeking screen-print­ed and embroidered apparel. This year, the firm fulfilled orders from dorms prepar­ing for Freshman Orientation activities and from the vol­
leyball team. 

The tow­els are apparently already a popular choice am o n g some on campus. 
The cot­ton towels h a v e retailed for $10 in the Varsity Shop in the Joyce Center and t h e 
Warren 
G o I f Course pro s h o p , 
where the items sold out their first week there. One towel is also on display at 
the  La.Fortune  Student  
Center.  
The towels  are  part of a  

"Play Like a Champion" line that also includes key chains, magnets and other merchandise. 
Costin recalled the pride he's seen the towels inspire. "At the Warren course, we've seen a lot of people 
using them as golf towels. I remember talking to a man one day who was telling me about the great new golf towel he had bought," said Costin, who feigned igno­rance of his company's tow­els being sold in the shop. 
"I looked at the guy's bag and told him I didn't see the new towel there. He said, 'I don't use it on the course. I've still got my brown towel to wipe off my clubs," Costin said. 
That speaks to the enthusi­asm about the towels that Costin and Humbert believe will become contagious. 
"It's not only the towel itself that has the potential to unify the crowds but the message on it: 'Play like a champion.' That's what Notre Dame's all about. Win or lose, our fans act like people we want to represent us,'' Costin said. 
The idea for a Notre Dame fa.n towel is a takeoff on the tradition that fans at the University of Tennessee and other colleges practiced for years. When the Irish meet the Volunteers at Notre Dame Stadium Nov. 3, per­haps Costin and Humbert's towels will be the start of an early tradition there. 
"We don't want to stop our worthy competitors from bringing their towels," Costin said, "But we also don't want a repeat of last year." 
"We don't want this to appear that it's not a tough place to play," Humbert said. 
And maybe that starts one champion-themed gold towel at a time.

The capture just a few miles from the scenes of the grisly murders ended a manhunt that had reached alJ the way to the East Coast. Authorities said they believe Soltys never left the Sacramento area. with its large Ukrainian and Russian com­munities. 
Deputy Sheriff Bill Samuelson said Stepan Soltys was eating breakfast at around 7 :45 a.m. when he looked through a glass back door and saw his fugitive brother under the desk. 
Nikolay motioned for Stepan to be quiet, but Stepan instead assembled relatives in the garage, where police had installed a panic button. Neither the alarm nor a phone police had given the family worked, so the fami­ly piled into the car and fled, Samuelson said. 
Surprised detectives saw the garage door fly open and the car speed away. 

The family drove several blocks to a framing shop, where employee Jennifer Murphy helped Stepan call police. 
"A man came up to me with his cell phone and he was all shaky. He kept pushing buttons 1-1-9, so I knew he wanted to dial 911," Murphy said. "I brought him into the store and dialed 911 for him." 
Dozens of deputies stormed into the cluttered yard and arrested Soltys without a struggle. He was carrying a metal potato peeler in his pocket and a map of the Sacramento area. 
Authorities said they believe Soltys had been staying in woods behind the house. Blanas said the family didn't know undercover detectives were watching the home, and an officer had checked the yard Wednesday evening. 
"At night there's so many ways to get into that back yard, you can't cover every inch," Blanas said.

Central Bank rolls out first euro notes 
Associated Press 
FRANKFURT 
Europeans on Friday got 
a first look at their new 
currency -seven state-of­
the-art notes that are said 
to be the most counterfeit­
proof in the world and that 
planners promise will help 
unite the continent like 
never before. 
The European Central 
Bank, which governs mon­
etary policy for the 12 
nations, has kept the euro 
notes under wraps to give 
counterfeiters as little time 
as possible to unravel 
security features. The col­
orful bills start circulating 
Jan. 1.

in denomination's of 5, 10, 


20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 euros. A euro is currently worth about 91 cents. 
"The euro is much more than a common currency," Duisenberg said. "It is a symbol of European inte­gration." 
Outside the Frankfurt, Germany opera house, where the bills were intro­duced, workers dangling from ropes peeled away large plastic sheets to reveal two story-high copies of the notes hanging from the bank's headquar­ters. 
The introduction of the euro bills as money people can touch and feel will be a historic step in bringing Europeans closer together, Duisenberg said. Starter kits of coins are introduced in most countries in December. 
"In some 100 days' time, the euro will be in our pockets. it will be our money, a tangible reality and not just the virtual market currency which it has thus far been per­ceived to be by many Europeans," Duisenberg said. 
The euro has existed since Jan. 1, 1999 when national currencies were pegged to it, but 300 mil­lion people in the euro bloc have continued to use their old national currencies as cash. After the New Year changeover. national cur­rencies will still be accept­ed as legal tender during transitional periods rang­ing from two to six months. 

The bank's primary job now is creating a sense of confidence in the new cur­rency. After the bank earli­er Thursday helped the euro gain against the dol­lar with an interest rate cut, officials turned the focus on security. 
The new bills incorpo­rate measures tried and tested on outgoing national currencies -such as raised printing so people can identify the real thing from fakes by touch -with fea­tures unique to the new bills. 
Some of those features were purposely kept secret. 
"There are always more security features than you explain to the public," for security reasons, said Regina Schueller, a bank spokeswoman. 
The bills feature water­marks and security threads ~ a dark line that becomes visible when the bill is held up to light. Tilting brings out holo­grams printed on a foil stripe at the edge of the smaller bills. Another stripe near the center can only be seen under very bright light. 
The bigger bills -the 50, 100, 200 and 500 -have a foil patch with a hologram of the bank note and its value. They also have ink on the numerals that changes color as bills are moved in the light.

Officials: football ticket distribution a success 



By ERIN LaRUFFA 
News Writer 
After months of planning, foot­ball ticket distribution for the 2001 season was an overaU suc­cess. according to student lead­ers involved in the process. 
"I thought it was fair. Above all. it accomplished its goal. and that was to get people to sit together with their friends," said Matt Smith, president of the class of 2003. 
This year's process involved students receiving lottery num­bers on enrollment day and then purchasing their tickets by class on assigned days. The system represented one of many changes made in the past few years in student ticket distribu­tion. 
"For the most part, students who saw the process in the past thought that this year was a great improvement," said class of 2004 president Keri Oxley. 
Oxley. Smith and senior class president Peter Rossmann were part of the committee that devel­oped this year's ticket distribu­tion system. Other members of the committee included student body president Brooke Norton and vice president Brian Moscona, along with head stadi­um usher Russell Gagnon and representatives from both the Student Activities and ticket offices. 
"Going in, we knew students wanted it as simple as possible," Norton said. "We really wanted to create something we could do year in and year out." 
The committee will meet again soon to evaluate the process and decide how to proceed in plan­ning next year's ticket distribu­tion, Moscona said. 
"We did get a lot of positive feedback from students, though we did get some complaints," Norton said. One of the major complaints she cited involved students having to stand in line. 
She said the committee will use organizations such as the Student Senate and Hall President's Council to get addi­tional feedback from students. 
Committee members said they believed this year's system was an improvement over the previ­ous one. 
"We think it was so much bet­ter than what happened last year. I've talked to 30 or 40 stu­dents, and they're very happy," Moscona said. 
"I think the process ran smoothly, but we're looking for more ways to improve efficiency for the students," said Oxley.

5 rectors join Notre Dame staff 



By ELIZABETH LEE 
News Writer 
Five dorms have new leaders this fall as Carroll Hall, Howard Hall, Keough Hall, Lyons Hall and Sorin College all welcome new rectors. 
Carroll Hall is now led by Father Jim Lewis who served as rector for Notre Dame's under­graduate program in London the past two years. 
Prior to his work in London, Lewis did various kinds of social work, serving as a therapist in the psychiatric unit of St. Joseph's Medical Center in South Bend, as well as at Central Professional Group in Joliet, Ill. 
Although he enjoys the foot­ball games and retreats, Lewis was mainly drawn to the com­munity life at Notre Dame. 
"I wanted to contribute to and be a part of such a vibrant com­munal reality," he said. "In my short time on campus, I've been touched by the generous sup­port and welcoming of a great many [people who have been] present to me, informative, and inclusive. These are the gifts that I hope to offer as rector." 
Lewis has been a Carmelite priest for 18 years and enjoys film, the theater, classical music and the Rocky Mountains. 
Kathy Brannock, the new rec­tress in Howard Hall, attended Notre Dame as an undergradu­ate before graduating from Notre Dame Law School last May. 
Brannock Dunn 

She is dedicated to service and took a year off between undergraduate and law school to teach for AmeriCorps. 
During her law school days she served as the assistant rec­tor in McGlinn Hall. As an undergraduate, she spent most of her time in Siegfried Hall ­where she was a resident before it was converted to a men's dorm. 
"Not many people remember that [Siegfried] was a women's residence hall originally," she said. 
Originally from Albany, N.Y.. Brannock had never planned on living in Indiana, but she said something about Notre Dame keeps drawing her back. 
She feels blessed to have had so many opportunities at Notre Dame and is excited about her new position. 
"I have met many incredible and talented women," she said. "So far my experience has been wonderful, and I am looking forward to a great year." 
Father Peter Jarret, a 1986 Notre Dame graduate, is the new rector in Keough Hall. 
He lived in Flanner Hall for four years and was a resident 
Jarret 
assistant his senior year. 
After graduating with a degree in government, he entered Moreau Seminary, where he earned his Masters of Divinity in 1991. 
He was ordained a priest at Sacred Heart in April 1992. For the past six years he was the pastor of St. Pius X parish in Granger. where his term expired in July. Free to take another assignment, Jarret decided to return to Notre Dame. excited to be back in the community. 
"Life in the residence halls is a key part of being at Notre Dame, and I was very excited at the opportunity to live, pray and work with students," he said. 
In addition to his work as rec­tor, Jarret, the youngest of seven children. enjoys reading and NASCAR racing. 
Sister Susan Dunn. a Dominican Sister, has recently become the rector of Lyons Hall, where she is currently enjoying "the wonderful views of Saint Mary's Lake." 
Previous to her arrival at Notre Dame, Dunn spent 12 years at St. Thomas Aquinas College in Sparkill, N.Y., where 


Lewis Peters 

for the past three years she 
worked in the residence life 
area. 

Dunn enjoys walking, biking 
and reading, and is a fan of 
women's basketball. She is also 
attempting golf. 

"Please note that I did not use 
the word 'enjoy' with golf yet," 
she said. 

Sam Peters is the new rector 
in Sorin College and came to 
Notre Dame in 1995 to join the 
Congregation of Holy Cross for­
m a tion program at Moreau 
Seminary. He will profess his 
perpetual vows Saturday. 
Although he will soon formally 
dedicate his life to God, he 
didn't always envision a life in 
the Church. 

Peters said he planned on 
becoming a dentist while study­
ing Biology at Loyola University 
in Chicago, but later heard 
another call. 

"God had other plans for my 
life, and I switched from saving 
teeth to saving souls," he said. 
He also enjoys playing basket­
ball and golf.

Conference highlights manuscripts 
Special to the Observer 
Notre Dame's extensive collection of medieval man­uscripts will be the focus of a two-day seminar Sept. 13-15 that celebrates the appointments of Michael Lapidge and Jill Mann to endowed professorships in the Department of English. 
Titled "Medieval Manuscripts at Notre Dame," the conference will draw an international cadre of medieval literature specialists from as far as Japan for discussions on traditional manuscripts as well as the technological advances that are making manuscripts more accessi­ble. 
Sessions will take place in the Center for Continuing Education in McKenna Hall. 
Mann and Lapidge joined the Notre Dame faculty in 1999 as Notre Dame Professors of English, com­ing from the University of Cambridge. Lapidge is a renowned scholar of Anglo­Saxon literature. Mann is widely regarded as one of the world's foremost schol­ars of Middle English litera­ture, and also writes exten­sively on medieval Latin.

OIT service similar to other universities 
By SCOTT BRODFUEHRER 
Assistant News Editor 
While similar sized private institutions Notre Dame. Cornell and Stanford compare favorably in terms of technology and avail­ability of computers, Notre Dame's system is much less reli­able and experiences longer and more frequent network outages. 
Notre Dame's two separate daylong Internet outages and e­mail outage last year greatly ones in the residence halls rang­ing from two to 18 computers. Most of them have around five, six or seven computers, but the one in the student center has at least 40 computers," said 
Ri.kleen. 
Although students do not have to leave their dorms to access a cluster, 95 percent of Stanford students choose to bring a com­puter and use the clusters mainly to print, use an application they do not have, or as social space.

Cornell experienced one Internet outage last year, when the Internet line from their provider in nearby Syracuse. N.Y. was cut, according to Wes Kahle. director of customer services and marketing at Cornell. However, the outage occurred in the morn­ing and was fixed in the after­noon, less than six hours later. 
Stanford University. whose main Internet access is also pro­vided by Genuity, has not experi­enced any problems this year. However, Ethan Rikleen. a net­work and systems administrator at Stanford, said if there was a problem with Genuity's Internet service. students would have sim­ilar problems to those that Notre Dame experienced during its two outages. 
When the computers are work­ing, all three schools have clus­ters readily available for student use as well as in room network connections. 
Cornell's cluster system is simi­lar to Notre Dame's in that clus­ters are located at locations such as the student union and the library and are open very late, or in some cases, 24 hours a day. 
Stanford offers clusters in both these locations, but also has small clusters in each dorm, with one computer for every 20 stu­dents in small dorms and a com­plex formula for larger dorms.

Cornell and

for printing beginning at the first sheet. 
Cornell charges 10 cents a page to print and Stanford 7 cents a page. Notre Dame students would have to print more than 3,300 sheets during each acade­mic year for Stanford's system to be cheaper. These fees are deducted from students' accounts using a method similar to Domer Dollars. 
Stanford and Cornell have slightly more advanced tools available to them through their universities -especially when registering for classes. 
While Notre Dame only recent­ly introduced a Web registration tool, both Cornell and Stanford students have used the Internet to register for classes and enroll ffor several years. 
In the past. Notre Dame stu­dents used the telephone or, more recently, computer termi­nals at the library or registrar's office. Stanford's system allows students to register anytime dur­ing a specified period and there are no limitations as to when particular grade levels can regis­ter. Even with the new Web reg­istration tool, Notre Dame still requires students to enroll by fill­ing out a form at the Joyce Center at the beginning of each semester. 
"Our course registration is totally online and we don't typi­cally have a problem with the number of students registering at one time, although we have a date they must finish registration by," said Ri.kleen.

SMC hosts contemporary artists 
By JENNIKA KIRKBRIDE 
News Writer 
Beginning today, Saint Mary's 
and the Moreau Center for the 
Arts will welcome three con­
temporary artists to display 
their work in Moreau's main 
galleries. 
A reception tonight in Moreau 
celebrates the opening of the 
season and introduces the work 
of Barbara Campbel!. Marcella 
Hackbardt and Cassandra 
Hooper. The free reception 
runs from 5-7 p.m. 
Pennsylvania-based painter 
Campbell displays her own 
unique interpretation of every­
day landscapes in the Sister 
Rosaire Extension Gallery. 
Campbell uses vivid color and form to blend reality and her perception of reality into what is sometimes unrecognizable. 
"The physical space encir­cling us invariably works its way into our interiors, affecting us physically," she said. 
The main components of her work include the use of "bril­liant color, formal elaborations. areas of heavy painting and areas of light, untouched can­vas," the artist said. 
A pitiful. shriveled little shrub she encountered one day on her walk home is one of many memories that inspires her art. 
She noticed that someone had taken the time to carefully place a very small and elabo­rate fence around its base in order to guard it. 
"That act, which seemed so ridiculous in so many ways, really struck me," she said. "I was struck by its poignancy and by an impulse which desires 
decoration and beautification 
and a kind of order even in futility. That act right there sums up why I make paint­ings." 
Campbell is a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley's Master of Fine Arts program, and her work has most recently been included in Miami University's "Young American Painters" exhibit. 
The Little Theatre Gallery displays the photographic art of Hackbardt. Her art deals with the conflicting ideas of mother­hood from society and the reali­ty of the role of a mother. 
"Mainstream images of moth­ering evoke a mismatch between what we ought to be feeling and how we feel," Hackbardt said. Her pho­tographs both question and cel­ebrate the paradoxical emo­tions of maternity, "unity and separation, strength and fragili­ty, intimacy and invasion. and pleasure and resentment." 
She sees her work as only one in "a chorus of voices." IIackbardt is currently a pro-

fessor at Kenyon College in cen­tral Ohio. She continues to cre­ate and teach art because, "the stakes are high ... art is pivotal in our society." 
The final artist welcomed in this exhibition is the mixed media artist Hooper, whose work can be seen in the Hammes Gallery. 
"Hooper's work begins with photographs, which are then layered with other art forms including lithography, etching, painting. collage and computer generated imaging," said Melanie Engler, director of public relations for Saint Mary's. _ 
She creates surreal environ­ments which expose her audi­ence to spaces of hidden dan­gers and secrets, inviting them into worlds "that have never been experienced, but seem oddly familiar," according to the artist. 
Hooper describes her work as, "Invented places and haWlt­ingly real spaces ... which con­jure feelings of both isolation and involvement." Her latest series, "Tug", will explore "the struggle between identity and personal introspection." 
The exhibit runs through Sept. 28. The gallery hours are Tuesday through Friday, 10 
a.m. to 4 p.m.; Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon; and Sunday from 1-3 p.m.

Car seat belt use higher than ever 
Associated Press 
More people than ever are wearing seat belts and fewer children are being killed by air bags, the government says in fresh evidence that a decades­1ong focus on auto safety is paying off. 
Automakers are building safer vehicles, but experts say people's behavior is the big reason for reduced highway fatalities. 
"The most crashworthy vehi­cle, the most well-designed car in the world is not going to help you in many situations unless you take the personal responsi­bility to help the vehicle help you." National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator Jeffrey Runge said. 
NHTSA released data Thursday showing 73 percent of people observed in the front seat of vehicles around the country this summer were wearing seat belts -the high­est since the agency began keeping statistics seven years ago, when 58 percent wore seat belts. 
Experts say more seat belt usage. along with tougher laws and improvements in highway and auto safety, are part of a change in the culture of road travel that emphasizes safety and is responsible for a huge drop in the highway death rate. 
Last year, there were 41.800 fatalities, or 1.6 deaths per mil­lion miles traveled. There were 47,878 deaths in 1977, and because vehicle miles traveled each year has increased signifi­cantly since then, the rate was more than double at 3.3 per million. 
The decline has occurred as the federal government has stepped up safety require­ments, such as requiring air 
bags, and  consumers  have  
demanded  more safety fea­ 
tures.  
Former  NHTSA  

Administrator Diane Steed said when she was at the agency in the 1980s. automakers said safety didn't sell. Now they actively promote it through ad campaigns. 
"We did everything we could when I was there to make it clear that you can choose safe­ty options when buying a vehi­cle," Steed said. "And you could actually see a change in the way companies were adver­tising." 
In 1980, consumers ranked safety ninth among 12 features they considered when buying a vehicle, according to Maritz Marketing Research. Now it's ranked sixth out of 26 features. 
NHTSA, insurers and the auto industry spend millions each year on public service campaigns encouraging motorists to buckle up and put young children in car seats ­away from air bags. 
The Air Bag & Seat Belt Safety Campaign celebrated its fifth anniversary Thursday by releasing a report that shows the number of small children killed by air bags has fallen sharply since 1996. 
Government statistics show the number of confirmed child deaths fell from 25 in 1996 to sLx in 2000, while the number of automobiles with air bags rose from 22 million to more than 80 million. 
An air bag comes out of the dashboard at rates of up to 200 miles per hour, faster than the blink of an eye. They were designed to protect adults, and the force can be too strong for small children and can cause head and neck injuries. 
At least 191 people, including 116 children, have been killed by the force of deploying air bags, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Air bags have been credited with saving about 7,224 lives. 
The government began allow­ing switches to deactivate air bags in 1995 and recommends the passenger-side air bag be turned off if a child under 13 is riding in the front seat. By Sept. 1, 2003, all vehicles must have advanced air bags that deploy with less force or not at all when children are in the front seat. 
While air bag deaths decline, NHTSA says seat belt use con­tinues to climb nationwide. though it varies by region and vehicle type. 
Drivers and passengers in cars wore seat belts 76 percent of the time, while those in pick­up trucks did so only 59 per­cent of the time. 
People in the Northeast are least apt to wear seat belts ­62 percent in the most recent survey -while Southern motorists dramatically increased seat belt use from 69 percent to 76 percent since last fall. NHTSA credited the increase to high-profile enforcement campaigns in the region. 
NHTSA uses the statistics to target its safety messages. 
"It's easy to see that in spite of our great gains, there is much more that needs to be done," Runge said. "It is not time to quit and rest on our successes." 

Seat belt usage is on the rise 
A much higher percentage of Americans are wearing their seat belts according to a recent study. Experts credit tougher laws and campaigns encouraging motorists to buckle up.

2 more claim share of Powerball win 
Associated Press 
DOVER, Del. 

The holders of the fourth and final winning ticket in the $294.8 million Powerball draw­ing -a first-grade teacher and her brother from the Pittsburgh area -stepped forward to claim their share of the jackpot Thursday. 
·1 guess we'll help the econo­my somewhat," said Kathleen Kearney, who with her brother, Michael Kearney, won $73.7 million. 
Kathleen Kearney said she will keep teaching despite her winnings, although she will buy a new car to replace her 8-year­old Toyota, find a good doctor to treat her arthritis and maybe take some trips. 
She also will spend some money on her students. "Certainly better snacks," she said. 
Michael Kearney, a lawyer with two teen-age daughters, hasn't decided what to do with his share of the lump-sum, pre­tax payment of $41.4 million, which they will split equally. 
"It's kind of shocking to win that kind of money, so I really haven't given it much thought," he said. 
Kat_hleen Kearney said she waited so long to come forward because "I never win anything." They didn't check their ticket against the winning numbers until Wednesday. 
Unable to reach state lottery officials by phone, they decided to drive to the office in Dover, about an hour from Kathleen Kearney's home. 
"We said 'We're here,'" Michael Kearney said. 
The jackpot was the third­richest lottery prize in U.S. his­tory. The holders of the three other winning tickets in last Saturday's drawing stepped for­ward earlier this week: an ex­convict from Kentucky. a med­ical records clerk from Minnesota and a couple from Maine. 
Earlier Thursday, co-workers of Maine winner Pat Wales dropped their claim to a piece of the prize. 
The facts did not support their assertion that the winning ticket had been bought for an office pool, said John McVeigh, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. 
"Once we got the answers, we decided to dismiss," McVeigh said. 
In the lawsuit filed Wednesday, four people who worked with Wales at Lincoln Financial Group in Portland said 19 people had kicked in $10 apiece to share 190 Powerball tickets. 
Terrence Garmey, a lawyer for Wales and her husband Erwin, insisted the winning tick­et belonged to the couple, offer­ing as proof sales records from the store in New Hampshire where it was bought. 
He said Pat Wales bought 190 numbers for her office pool, then a few minutes later bought 20 for herself and her husband. The winning ticket, Garmey said, was among those 20. 
Garmey said Pat Wales was "devastated" when told her co­workers might sue. "She put her head on the table and sobbed," he said.

McCain recovering froill surgery 
Associated Prcss 
PHOENIX 
Sen. John McCain was recov­ering Thursday from surgery for a benign enlargement of his prostate and was expected to make a full and rapid recovery, his spokeswoman said. 
The Arizona Republican experienced no complications during the procedure Wednesday -his 65th birth­day -at the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, spokes­woman Nancy Ives said. 
McCain was expected to leave the hospital Friday and plans to return to work when the Senate convenes Tuesday, Ives said. 
"He sounds great and is look­ing forward to coming home, getting back to Washington and getting back to work," she said. 

Because of the surgery, McCain canceled a planned Sept. 4 speech in Minneapolis, but it wasn't known whether he would miss any other public appearances. 
Enlargement of the prostate is common among older men and can lead to urinary diffi­culties. During the procedure, enlarged prostate tissue block­ing the urethra is cut away. 
Doctors also broke up stones that had accumulated in McCain's bladder because the prostate was large enough to prevent the bladder from emp­tying completely, Ives said. 
The stones were too large to remove without an incision, so a laser was used to break them into smaller fragments, she said. McCain was given general anesthesia during the opera­tion, which lasted about 70 minutes. 
McCain had said as he entered the hospital Wednesday that he looked for­ward to having "this minor" problem resolved. 
The former presidential can­didate underwent surgery last August to remove melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer. from his temple and upper arm. McCain's office said checkups since then have found no further signs of can­cer. 
McCain just returned from a five-day congressional delega­tion trip to Estonia, Latvia, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic.

be scrapped for a mail-in system. Students want a mail-in system similar lo ones used at other schools. They want the convenience of filling out one form, sending in their checks and waiLiug for their lickets. 
Even the best lottery systems still require at least two trips across campus, possible interference with class schedules and the hassle of coordinating ticket groups 

Seeing through media biases 
With the advent of cable television came the 24-hour news cyde and the need for cable news programs to latch onto sensational stories. Enter and exit the 0. J. Simpson case. Enter and exit President Clinton's impeachment. Enter and exit the 2000 presidential election and post­election selection of a president. Enter Representative Gary Condit's rela­tionship with miss­ing intern Chandra Levy. 
It is now time to exit the Condit aspect of the story and concentrate on Levy's disappear­ance. 
Many cable program hosts, most notably on the Fox Cable Channel, have used this story for political reasons. Of course, politics was forever yhangcdfor the worse when Newt Gingrich adopu~d the scorch-the-earth and hold-no-pris­oners approach to win control ol' the 
U.S. House of Representatives in 1994. Since that time, both Democrats and Republicans use any opportunity to spin a positive light for their causes. 
Coverage of Condit has gone beyond news and information. Everyone knows that he is a hormonal horn-dog. Some suggest that it probably comes from his repressive upbringing within the Baptist Church. But that is not news anymore since we could list repressed Catholics or Methodists or whatever religion who act just as badly with their brand of morality. Until Condit was implicated when Levy disappeared. his affairs had no standing regarding his performance as an elected official. 
This writer supports the true meaning of"fair and balanced," rather than Fox's fair and balanced "according to lhe con­servative way of thinking" approach that reeks throughout that cable network's reporting. Give me Chris Matthews of MSNBC's "Hardball" any day. While the former Democratic press secretary to ultra-liberal Speaker Tip O'Neill infuri­ates many Democra1s with his criticism of Bill Clinton, he consistently holds to a set of principles regardless of party affil­iation. 

During the upcoming school year, this column may support and espouse the Democratic Party's approach to problems while criticizing the opposition. It may call attention to issues that are uncomfort­able for conservatives or Re.publicans. Unfortunately, in the past, regardless of what appeared in this col­umn, those who disagree seem to read only what they want and misrepre­sent what is written in their e-mail responses. Despite those misinter­pretations, this column will be more like MSNBC than Fox. 
With that said, here is one Democrat who sees Condit acting like every other elected ol.llcial, regardless of party, who has been caught having ­how did Condit describe it? Oh, yes, he could not come right out and say that it was romantic or intimate or just an w1controlled urge. For his rigid pride and immediate denial of his relation­ship, he has paid a terrible price at the hands of those self-righteous individuals whom should be called "the sex police." 
Conservative commentator and self­appointed morality police chief William Bennett told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that adultery alone is not a disqualifier to hold public office. Yet in the next breath, Bennett tired to demean Democra1s in general by saying that at least Republican flir1s such as Senator Packwood and Representatives Livingston and Gingrich chose to resign while President Clinton and Hepresentative Condit did not. Nothing like a little conservative spin to support 

they didn't have enough time to organize a mail-in system. The lottery system they created was an effective stop-gap solution but is by no means perfect. 
They have already proven they can create an effective lottery system in just a few weeks. With several months to develop and implement a mail-in system, student football ticket sales can run even more smoothly in the future. 
Republicans and debase Democrats. 
Blitzer countered that House Republicans Henry Hyde and Dan Burton, also participan1s in extra-mari­tal dalliances, did not resign. Bennett said that their trys1s had occurred years ago and chose to turn the discussion back to attack Condit's current situation, calling Condit a "serial adulator." 
If one focuses on the allegations that Condit attempted to obstruct the 
investigation in order to hide his personal life, then his fitness to serve as an 
elected official is correct­
ly questioned. His best approach should have been to say that he 
was romantically involved from the start. He could have blamed it on the pres­sures of office or the long separations with 
his wife. Or he just could have said it was a weakness for which he was ashamed. It does not matter now, for his political life has ended. Should he run and be reelected, he will still be 

rather ineffective and will always be embattled. Those who are using Condit as red meat for their causes should beware. Casting stones at glass houses tend to splinter everyone. 
And all of us, regardless of religion or personal values, have no business cast­ing the first stone. Try conveying that message in an e-mail to a cable news host when precious ratings are on the line.

GUEST COLUMNS 
LEXINGTON, Ken. 

It is interesting that so many Americans rally behind the U.S. military's efforts to thwart such terrible countries as Iraq from taking over Kuwait in order to gain the

called oil. The 
reason I would say 
that is because the United States 
has this same history of usurpa­tion of other people's land and 
resources. 
Some groups may recognize this policy as "Manifest Destiny." In 1877 the U.S. government claimed ownership of the Black Hills after promising it to the Sioux. In 1868, the United States signed a treaty that set aside the Black Hills "for the absolute and undisturbed use of the Sioux." But it soon came to pass that gold was discovered in the Black Hills. 
Words, when molested by money, can quickly become as malleable as the yellow metal that symbolically birthed this unnatur­al concept. The gold brought in a flood of the gold-seeking explorers who invaded the land just seven years after the Black Hills treaty was signed by President Andrew Johnson. 
After Custer's defeat at Little Big Horn in 1876, Congress told the Sioux that they could either give up the Black Hills or lose earlier pledged federal rations, medicine, blankets and food. Only 10 percent of the adult males signed the treaty to give up the Black Hills, but in 1877 Congress enacted it anyway. 
One federal judge disapproved of the government's deal, saying, "a more ripe and rank case of dis­honorable dealing will never, in all probability, be found in our histo­ry." One could argue that our abil­ity as a nation to follow the edict of the popular vote is somewhat askew even in these modern times. 
In 1980, the Supreme Court awarded eight Sioux tribes $106 million in compensation. The court said that this was retribution for 
"a taking of tribal property." 
The Sioux refused the millions, insisting instead that their land be . returned. The money has been sit­ting in a government account. The 
interest on the account has now 
made the funds grow to as much 
as $570 million. 
The Sioux still refuse to .touch 
the money because they don't see 
the Black Hills as something that 
can be sold. To the Lakota Sioux, 
the Black Hills are sacred. 
The Lakota call the Black Hills 
"Wamaka Og'naka I'cante," mean­
ing: The heart of everything that 
is. Some people may think it fool­
ish for the Lakota to turn down 
this money when they and other 
Native Americans make up the 
most impoverished section of our 
nation's population. 
It may be easier to empathize if 
we consider the following ques­
tion. What dollar amount would 
you put on your family, your 
beliefs, your convictions and 
serenity? 
So, we wave our flags, we rally 
our troops and our population. 
America has been carefully craft­
ed as a benevolent benefactor of 
the bullied peoples of the world. 
That is a wonderful mythology to 
strive toward as a nation. 
But what are we really made of? 
Do we truly practice the values we 
claim to hold? 
The Native Americans of this 
country were attacked and over­
come by our forefathers in much 
the same way that Kuwait was 
invaded and occupied by Iraq. 
I believe that as American citi­
zens we need to stand tall and 
practice the values that we 
espouse. Ifwe are really more 
concerned with helping people be 
free than we are with helping 
economies embrace free-market 
capitalism, then let's see it in some 
action, because it doesn't seem to 
have ever been of much value in 
words.

Crossing the line with college rankings 
CHAHLOTTESVILLE, Vir. 
Kudos to the Princeton Review, those infamous test-prep gurus in New York City. They have effectively created a set of rankings that no college actually wants to win. 
This year, the University of Juliana Chan Tennessee was the unhappy recipient of the Review's well­known "best party Cavalier Daily school" national title. Not only is the dis­tinction ridiculous, it is a nightmare for officials who must deal with the deluge of questions and com­plaints from media and prospective stu­dents. 
Admissions officials at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville were rattled, to say the least, when they discovered that their school beat out everybody else for the unfortunate title. Tennessee took top hon­ors for "most beer" in the Review's "Best 331 Colleges" book, making the uni­versity the uncontested leader in the parties category. 
This is the same University of Tennessee that is, accord­ing to its school web site, investing in research cen­ters and academic pro­grams to "provide an outstanding education for undergraduate and graduate students." Vice president and provost Dr. Loren Crabtree said, "stu­dents are our top pri­ority" in his online welcome letter. With information praising Tennessee's commit­ment to students' intel­lectual development and students' accounts of their strictly social development, prospec­tive students understand­ably would be confused. 
Social rankings simply cause prospective students to color any and everything else that admissions officials say with distrust. Tennessee's admissions office might be extolling its worldwide renown in medieval histo­ry research, but that won't prevent the "most beer" distinction from swirling in the backs of prospective students' minds. 
The more studious contingent at Tennessee will not be taken seriously, since the school is more commonly known for having the nation's rowdiest party ani­mals -the students who begin partying on Wednesdays and don't stop until the last drop of liquor is consumed on Sunday night. 
The Princeton Review may have had prospective students in mind, but it cer­tainly ignored the dignity of the faculty at Tennessee, which is affected by the over­all reputation of the school and thus the extent to which students take school seri­ously. Tennessee's faculty members are the unwitting losers in all of this because their hard work and scholarship has been marred by this senseless award. 
Though academic rankings can also hurt a college's reputation, they keep a school's goals in line by making academic excellence the primary mission. Social rankings, on the other hand, do nothing but cripple a school's reputation. 

Administrators waste countless hours answering to the public about its social 
reputation. 
The Princeton Review handles college rankings a little differently than organiza­tions like U.S. News & World Report and Kaplan. Unlike U.S. News, Princeton Review publishes additional rankings based on college students' opinions about the quality of life and campus atmosphere in an attempt to give color commentary to its rather cut-and-dry academic rankings. 
But with such embarrassing titles as "best party school," "professors suck all life from materials" and "students least happy," you can be sure any administra­tors would be more than a tad upset if they heard that their college's name. topped those lists. 
This was unfortunately the case with Tennessee. Crabtree made it clear that academic rankings and the success rates of graduates are the criteria schools ought to be focusing on ("Top Party School" Ranking Rankles Officials at U. of 
E 
Tennessee at Knoxville," The Chronicle of Higher Education, Aug. 21). Yet they are forced to spend 
time excusing their students' _ flamboyant behavior outside of the classroom. This takes time away from administra­tors that could be spent 
looking for high-quality professors, attracting good students and 
improving class curricu­
la. 
If a prospective stu­dent interested in Tennessee's respected chemistry program heard current students saying they "swill warm beer, hang out with 
sorority girls, pass out, 
wake up around noon, 
put on (their) orange 
(clothing) and sneak some 

Jack Daniels into the game," he might assume that was the norm. The Princeton Review should veer away from stu­dent surveys altogether. Granted, its mission is simply to help students choose a good 
school. But when this mission dis­tracts administrators from improving their academics, this is where they ought to draw the line. 
The rankings have lauded the lesser­known efforts of the University of Virginia, which received high marks for its libraries and having an administration that "runs like butter." In the same way, they have questioned the academic rigor of schools like University of Alabama­Tuscaloosa and University of Georgia, whose students apparently "almost never study." 
As the college admissions season revs up again, the Princeton Review should reconsider how far it will play the ratings 
 game. Maybe after checking on the schools they have rated poorly in the past, they will finally see what an injustice stu­dent surveys are.

You don't need no stinkin' books 
You just dropped five Benjamins on books for this semes­ter. They ran out of used books for your classes the first day. They changed editions after one year, making student to student book deals as common around here as changes 
to du Lac. 
All this hassle begs the question: "What if I just didn't buy books this semester?" 
Do you dare? Are you that big of an academic rebel? Can you successfully tell the bookstore to bite you without failing out of school? 
As Tony Robbins would say, "Yes, my friends, YOU CAN." You have five classes. I am hooking you good peo­ple up with five strategies that will help you, the poor college student, to have a Hammes-free experience. 
Strategy #1 
So, inevitably, you will have to read pages 1-50 of Plato before Thursday's 


discussion. So does that cute member of the opposite sex in your class. Think of your lack of books as a social opportu­nity. Get together with that person to "discuss the materi­al." You just might "discuss" your way to a passing grade. 
Things will get crazy if you try to overcome having no books strictly with "discussions." People talk, and you soon might be known as a male book slut, or a nerd ho if you are female. We need another strategy for those classes with ugly people in them. 
Strategy #2 
Visit the library and actually CHECK OUT A BOOK! People actually do this -I checked. That Plato book you need is freely available there for no charge. You may be thinking, "I thought the library was for overworked, underpaid TAs with beards." Not so. They let undergrads in there too. 
Unfortunately, the library will not provide you with any sort of hook up. The library is prude like that. 
Strategy #3 
With two classes taken care of, we move to our third strategy: listen to your professors. Professors are all differ­ent, but have one common thread. They talk about what interests them and what they know the most about, just like regular people. Whenever they go off on a crazy 25­minute tangent. remember what it was about. They'll test you on that. 
Strategy #4 
Every office of every department of every college has a big copy machine. that can copy like 100 pages a minute. Get a job at one of these places, or get your friends to let you in the office. Then copy the books while laughing hys­terically about your victory over the Hammes Bookstore. If anyone asks what you're doing there, rub some toner on your hands and face and then say, "This toner tastes like cocoa powder." 
Strategy #5 
Drop a class. Nothing feels better. But you should have some fun with it. Get up in the middle of the first class and say really loud, "You people are the problem with America," and light your notebook on fire as you leave. 
That takes care of all your classes with passing grades. Celebrate your 2.0 by blowing your extra $500 on a huge party with a bad Vanilla Ice impersonator. 
And laugh a villainous laugh everytime you pass ihe bookstore.

Sched-ules and 
Buying books is rarely a pleasant process. See, 
By JACQUELINE OSTROWSKI 
Scene Writer 
For Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students, 
the semesterly mass exodus to the bookstore 
marks either a fresh start or a biannual has­
sle. The bookstore and the book-buying 
processes vary from the students who buy 
every text (often eager freshmen) and load 
their arms with piles of books, to the students 
who forgo the bookstore in favor of online buy­
ing or patronizing off-campus bookstores. 
High prices seem to be the top concern 
among students who do frequent the campus 
bookstore. 
"Everybody complains about prices," said 
Derek Demske, a local high school student 
who worked at Hammes bookstore during this 
year's hectic buying season. 
Freshman Rebecca Dunn stopped her search 
for textbooks to confirm Demske's testimony. 
"It's going along rather smoothly ... except for 
the financial part," she said. 
Some students are lucky enough to have 
their textbooks make a repeat appearance in 
another class. 
''I'm an English major, so sometimes I 
already have some books [from previous class­
es]" said senior David Gonzalez. "But I usually 
buy all my books at the bookstore." 
Still, although Gonzalez has frequented the 
bookstore each semester, he is far from happy 
with the process. 
"I think it's pretty terrible -the prices and their policy on the buy backs. When you go at the end of the semester to sell, it's ridiculous what they give you back, if they buy them back ·at all," he said. "It seems kind of unfair to me." 
Those students who wish to look for a better 
deal can try dorm book sales. Typically, stu­
dents use posters to advertise books for sale in 
hopes of getting a better return than the book­
store may offer; however, e-mail is a newer 
method that also catches many students' 
attention. 
"I got e-mails from people in my dorm who 

were selling books, but I had already bought all my books," said freshman Tessa Garcia. 
Some students, usually upper­classmen, do seek other alter­natives to book­store shopping or dorm sales. 
"I buy my books at Borders whenever possi­ble," said senior Kyle Demko. "New books are only a couple dollars more than used books at the campus bookstore, and Notre Dame stu­dents get a dis­count on books there [when they show their stu­dent IDs]." 

Demko had considered online purchas­ing, but figured that "with Borders right here, it's just as easy to drive over there." 
Online shop­ping offers stu­dents one way to avoid the bookstore's monopoly on prices. However, the search can be intimidating, especially if a student is unfamiliar with online merchants. 
"I thought about [online purchasing], but I thought it'd cost more after shipping," said Dunn. 
Still, others do utilize the Internet for their book search. It's quick, convenient and some students claim that browsing Web sites instead of bookstore aisles can save a patient consumer money. 
"I go to the Internet first [before going to the campus bookstore]," said senior D.J. Cattin, who has used BarnesandNoble.com to make several online book purchases. "The Internet doesn't have all the books all the time, but sometimes you save money. It depends on how many books you're look­ing for." 
As for those pesky shipping prices, Cattin said they can be avoided with a larger order. "Or. sometimes you can find specials online or use coupons," he added. 
Although other choices clearly exist in local book­stores or on computer screens, the majority of stu­dents still flock to the campus bookstore. Still, that doesn't stop them from staring in dis­belief at the cashier who announces their total.

and where else you can turn. 

Anotlier common lament involves weak arms, since so many classes require multi­ple textbooks. "Core requires a lot of books," said sopho­more Jen Gushurst, eyeing the seemingly endless piles of Core texts. 
Empty shelves and a lack of used books also rank high on the list of student com­plaints. The line at the back of the textbook section was busy for most of the afternoon as students tried to find out when their required texts would arrive. 
"A lot of people have problems finding books. The tags are confusing, and a lot come in late," said Demske. 
Employee Nichole Armstrong. who often helps students with specific textbook con­cerns, is all too famil­iar with these situa­tions. 
"We get a lot of

ever witness. 
"Mostly, they're in shock," said cashier Patricia Smith of typical student reactions to high prices. "On the posi­tive side, everyone is so polite. Crazy ones are rare. They're ready to get going. Most of the students are so dedicated and want to get on with their education." Smith added that she'd only dealt with one rude student in the past year of working at the bookstore. 
"We had a crazy one in here the other day," coun­
tered neighboring cashier Katie Bobo, who had a differ­ent experience. "One girl had a copied [student) ID card, and she wanted to use it to ring up her books on her stu­dent account. She made a scene and finally threw her credit card at us ... but it [the credit card] didn't work," said Bobo. 
To cut down on the stress of the book buying process and to make sure you get your
books, director of Hammes Bookstore retail operations Jim O'Connor suggested that "it's always better to shop earlier. It gives you the best 
availability of used books." 
Most students follow this trend, buying books before classes have even met for the first time.

Interestingly. O'Connor has observed that not all students will choose used textbooks when given the option. "You'll find that students in high­er disciplines will choose the new book," he said, attesting this to the fact that students may want to keep the book for future refer­ence. 

"The weekend before school started, we were real busy," said Demske. 
Although the rows still seemed relatively busy on Tuesday and Wednesday, most underclassmen seemed decidedly optimistic about the intimidating process. 
"I have a sister in college, so I knew how it'd be," said Dunn. 
Freshman Justin Alanis shared this relaxed attitude. 
"I'm kind of nonchalant about it," said Alanis, who paused from looking up his schedule on lrishlink to share his thoughts and acknowledge that "[books] are expensive as hell." 
said Armstrong. "We 
had 700 used books for Chem 113, but once they were gone, people complained." 
However, management at the book­store notes that used books are a more plentiful option than they had been a few years ago. 
"The availability of used books has increased dramatically," said O'Connor. "We are aware of the 
Used or new, online or on campus -the possibilities are endless when it's time to buy books. From jaded upperclassmen who find other ways to purchase to optimistic freshmen, each student can personalize the book buying process to avoid hassles and get results.

CHICAGO If the Chicago Cubs make the playoffs, remember this game. 
Bill Mueller watches his game-winning homer clear the ivy as Sammy Sosa cheers in the background. 
Looking for something to give them a spark since they dropped out of first place, they final­ly got il Thursday-in a big way. . 
Mueller hit a solo homer in the bottom of thP ninth, and Fred McGriff had a three-run shot as the Cubs rallied for a 5-4 victory over the Florida Marlins. 
The Cubs overcame a four-run deficit ­their largest comeback of the year -and remained four games behind Houston in the NL Central. The Astros heat Cincinnati 6-1 on Thursday. 
"lt's a huge game for us," said McGriIT, who became only the second player in major league history to reach 80 RBI in 14 straight seasons. "Hopefully, we can look back and say this was a huge win for the Cubs." 
Mueller's home run was hi,:; first since May 2. He was on the disabled list for three months after breaking his kneecap May 13, and has struggled to find his hitting stroke since he returned Aug. 13. 
"It's defmitely a great feeling," Mueller said. "It's frustrating when these guys are going into their sixth month and I had to start over. Some of that hard work, hopefully this will be the start of it paying off." 
Kyle Farnsworth (4-3) struck out two and gave up a hit in one inning. 
Ricky Bones (3-4) allowed run and a hit in one-third of an inning for Florida, which lost for the 14th thne in 17 games. 
Florida wasted home runs by Preston Wilson and Mike Lowell. as well as one of Jesus Sanchez's better outings of the year. Sanchez, 0-for-4 in his last six starts, allowed only one run and four hits in six innings. 
But McGriff finally got the Cubs going in the sixth, leading off with a triple to the deep cor­ner in right field. Kevin Millar made a nice relay, rifling the ball to second baseman Luis Castillo. 
But Castillo's throw to third was way off, sail­ing several rows up into the stands to score McGriff and cut the Marlins margin to 4-1. 
McGriff came up big again in the seventh. Braden Looper came in for Sanchez, and promptly gave up a single to pinch-hitter Corey Patterson. Two outs later. he walked Sammy Sosa. 
Armando Almanza relieved, and McGriff sent his 2-1 pitch soaring high into the air. It looked like it might drop, but it carried just enough for the three-run homer that tied the game at 4. 
"I was hoping, but I wasn't really sure," McGrifT said. "I saw Millar going back like he had a bead on it. Next thing you know, the wind got ahold of it and carricd it on out." 
The fans gave McGriff a standing ovation. continujng to cheer until he came out of the dugout for a brief curtain call. 
It vvas McGrill"s fourth home run since join­ing the Cubs on July 27. He joins Hank Aaron as the only players with 80 HB(s in 14 or more straight seasons. 
"It was just a high fly ball that kept carrying, carrying, carrying," Millar said. "Mueller's ball was hit better than McGriffs. But McGri.tfs got 440 homers." 
Bones relieved to start tho ninth, and got Eric Young on a flyout to right. Mueller then sent a 2-2 pitch rocketing over the right-field fence, and the Cubs spilled out of the dugout to meet him at home plate. 
It was Chicago's first game-winning home run since June 2, 1999, when Sosa hit one against San Diego. 
"Anybody coming back in this type of race wants to help," Mueller said. "They remember how they were playing 6efore. That's how I remember myself playing. Right now, that's a little ways off. So it's frustrating to be playing and knowing what you can do and not being there yet." 
Mueller's homer also made up for his fielding error in the second, which gave the Marlins their first run. Lowell made it 2-0 in the fourth with a solo homer to left. his 15th of the year. 
The Marlins added two more runs in the fifth inning, thanks to more sloppy fielding. Derrek Lee led off with a single, and Cliff Floyd fol­lowed with a grounder to short that should have been a double play. 
But Ricky Gutierrez bobbled the ball, and could only get Lee. Floyd reached, and Wilson followed with a homer that soared over the left-field fence and out of the park to giv!l

AMERICAN LEAGUE 
Alomar's homer keys Indians to 3-1 win overSox 
Associated Press 
CLEVELAND 

Just as he's done all season. Hoberto Alomar did it all for the Cleveland Indians on Thursday night. 
Alomar hit a two-run homer and threw out a runner at third. helping Bartolo Colon and the Indians complete a three-game sweep with a 3-1 win over the fading Boston Red Sox. 
Alomar. rarely mentioned as an AL MVP candidate despite having statistics comparable to Seattle's lchiro Suzuki, home­red off Hideo Nomo (11-6). scored twice. walked and made two outstanding defensive plays. 
Alornar, whose .340 average is second in the league behind Suzuki's .351, leads Lhe sensa­tionaJ rookie in several offen­sive categories and has had another Gold Glove season at second base. 
And still. he's somehow being overlooked. 
"I don't know why," acting Indians manager Grady Little said. "He does things day in and day out that help us win games. Whether it's on offense or defense or with something he says to somebody in the club­house. He's a superstar." 
Colon {11-10) pitched six innings and was helped by 
Alomar and Omar Vizquel, who each threw out a runner on consecutive plays in the fourth inning. 
Colon. who won for the first time since July 27, had three losses and two no-decisions in August after going 4-0 the pre­vious month. He said he felt his groin pull slightly while warm­ing up before the game. 
Cleveland used three relievers to get to the ninth, with Bob Wickman getting three outs for his 26th save. 
Once again. Wickman had to pitch out of a jam. He gave up a leadoff single to Mike Lansing and a one-out base hit to pinch­hitter Carl Everett before strik­ing out Chris Stynes. 
Wickman, who had to get out of a bases-loaded threat in the ninth on Wednesday, then got Manny Hamirez to fly to center for the final out. 
The Indians' sweep was their first over Boston since 1996. With their fifth straight loss, the Red Sox headed home for a weekend series against the Yankees six games back of the AL East leaders. 
"We're not down," Red Sox manager Joe Kerrigan said. "We play with a lot of despera­tion, a lot of passion. We're scratching and clawing, knock­ing guys over at home plate. Guys are getting mad in the dugout. You can't ask for much more than that." 
Boston, which hasn't trailed by more in the division this sea­son. went 1-for-23 in the series with runners in scoring posi­tion. 
"We're pressing a bit in those situations," Kerrigan said. "I think we're trying to do too much. We work the count well with nobody on, but with run­
. ners on, we're in too much of a hurry." ··~ 
Indians manager Charlie Manuel remained hospitalized following abdominal surgery on Tuesday and Little ran the club for the third straight game. 
Manuel. who had scar tissue removed from previous surg­eries during the procedure, is expected to be released on Friday and could rejoin the club in Chicago this weekend. 
,i~.Jomar's 16th homer gave the Indians a 3-1 lead in the second. 
After Vizquel singled with one out, Alomar drove Nomo's fast­ball over the wall in center for his third homer in eight career at-bats against the right-han­der. 
"I'm just playing my game," Alomar said. 'Tm just coming to the park every day prepared to play and tonight I was lucky enough to hit the big homer when we needed it." 
Or cut down the runner. 
In the fourth, Shea Hillenbrand tried to stretch a double into a triple and was thrown out by Alomar from short right. 


Scott Hatteberg followed with a single and was nailed at the plate by Vizquel while trying to score on Mike Lansing's double. 
Left fielder Ellis Burks missed Lansing's shot with a dive, but center fielder Kenny Lofton hustled to get the ball and threw to Vizquel, who fired a strike to catcher Eddie Taubensee. 

Hatteberg came in standing up and tried to jar the ball loose from Taubensee, who managed to hang on after: get­ting flattened. 
Jim Thome's RBI single in the first scored Alomar to give the Indians a 1-0 lead. 
Boston tied it in the third on Manny Ramirez's two-out RBI double.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL 
Marshall football players suspended 
Associated P re;;s 
CHARLESTON, W.Va. 

The NCAA has susp(mded 14 Marshall athletes for improper­ly receiving extra work benefits. the school said Thursday night. 
The announcement, which involves 12 football players and two men's basketball players, was made Thursday by the school. two days before the Herd opens the season at No. 1 Florida. 
According to the NCAA, two football players must sit out one game; 10 football players will miss three games; and the bas­ketball players must miss 30 percent of the upcoming sea­son. 
Sports information director Ricky Hazel said some starting players were among those sus­pended, although he wouldn't release anv names. He said quarterback Byron Leftwich ­a 3.000-yard passer last season -wasn't among them. 
The penalties will be served immediately while the universi­ty appeals. 
"This is unfortunate, but I prefer to reserve further com­ment on this situation until we know the result of our appeal,.. Marshall football coach Bob Pruett said.

NCAA said what the extra bene­fits were. A statement issued by the school said the benefits were given prior to February 2000. 
Thursday's announcement is unrelated to a current NCAA investigation into study materi­als given to several athletes by an assistant professor two sum­mers ago. 
The Associated Press had reported that Bruce McAllister, an assistant professor of anato­my and physiology. gave a study guide to students in his class and told them to read it over. The study guide ended up being the actual exam. 
McAllister, who also served as a flexibility coach for the foot­ball team, was fired. 
Marshall reported those alle­gations in October 1999. 
Dave Wellman. the universi­ty's director of communications, declined further comment Thursday night. . 
"I can't say anything except what's in the statement," he said. 
Marshall has been hit with NCAA sanctions at least twice previously. 
In 1969, the Mid-American Conference suspended Marshall indefinitely and the NCAA placed it on one year's proba­tion after 144 football recruiting violations were revealed.

Kicker boots her way into Division I football history 
Associated Press 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. 
Ashley Martin became the first woman to play and score in a Division I football game Thursday night, kicking three extra points in three tries for Jacksonville State against Cumberland. 
A huge cheer went up from the crowd of 11.312 as Martin ran on the field for the first time for Division I-AA. Jacksonville State, her brown pony­tail dangling down her back. 
The standing ovation got louder when she put the ball high through the uprights to give Jacksonville State a 14-0 lead midway through the first quarter. Jacksonville State won 72-10. 
Martin's kick, made easier by an offsides penal­ty against Cumberland. landed just short of an adjacent field house. Earlier, starting kicker Steven Lee put his PAT on the roof to cap the first drive. 
But that didn't matter. Martin punched the air after the kick and ran to the sidelines. where she was greeted by teammates and coaches who pat­ted her on the hehnet. 
She made it 21-3 later in the opening period on a low, knuckleball kick. She got a third PAT in the fourth quarter. 
After the game, teammates chanted "Ashley! Ashley!" as coach Jack Crowe presented her with the game ball. 
"I didn't do a thing. all these guys put all the heart and hard work in it," Martin said. 
The NCAA doesn't keep such records, but Martin by all counts was the first female to play in Division I. 
At least two other women have suited up in 

Memphis coaches indicted 
Division I games without playing. Kathy Klop dressed out for Louisville in 1995 and Katie Hnida for Colorado in 1999, but neither saw action. 
In an interview days before the game, Martin wasn't worried about setting any records. "I've got a job to do, and that's what I'm focusing on," she said. 
Cumberland already was on the short end of another famed record: The Bulldogs lost 222-0 to Georgia Tech on Oct. 7, 1916. in what remains the most lopsided score in college football history. 
Crowe invited Martin to join the team this sea­son after it appeared the Gamecocks needed an extra kicker. She was one of the guys on the side­line -running out with the team and holding up her red helmet with everyone else during the opening kickoff. 
But Martin had an obvious distinction: She was the only Gamecocks player shadowed by network TV crews and news photographers. 
Martin won the chance toldck during fall drills, making 20-of-22 PATs during scrimmages. 
She also kicked in hlgh school, making 2-of-4 field goals and 79-of-92 extra points. She was selected homecoming queen at East Coweta High School, located southwest of Atlanta, and accept­ed the crown in her uniform. 
The only woman to previously score in a college football game was Liz Heaston, who kicked two extra points for then-NAIA Williamette University in 1997. 
The most famous attempt to break the Division I gender barrier came at Duke, where Heather Sue Mercer was cut from the team in 1995 and again in 1996. Mercer won $2 million in a discrimina­tion lawsuit against Duke, whlch is appealing the amount of the judgment but not the verdict. 
seeking to recruit" Means, feder­al prosecutor Terry Harris said. 
Means, a former Parade All­America defensive lineman at Trezevant High, transferred to Memphis in January after play­ing last fall at Alabama. He left the school after hearing allega­tions that Lang and Kirk sold his talents to Alabama for $200.000. 
Kirk testified under oath this week at a Memphis school board hearing that Crimson Tide booster Logan Young paid Lang to get Means to sign with Alabama.

A federal grand jury on Wednesday indicted two former Memphis high school coaches in a recruiting scandal involving former Alabama lineman Albert Means, who was cleared the same day by the NCAA to play for the University of Memphis. 
Lynn Lang, former head coach at Trezevant High School, and his former assistant, Milton Kirk, were charged with conspiracy, bribery and extortion, and war­rants were issued for their arrests.

US OPEN 
Safin survives tiebrakers, defeats [Jubicic 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

When things go wrong, as they often do for Marat Satin. he cocks his head and flails his arms like a conductor try­ing to coax every ounce of drama from a Russian sym­phony. 
There were discordant moments and attacks of angst Thursday at the U.S. Open before despair ull.imately turned to triumph for Safin. He nearly exhausted his allot­ment of tiebreakers bul out­lasted big-serving Croat Ivan Ljubicic in the second round, 7-6 (5). 6-7 (2), 7-6 {5). 7-6 
{5). 
For nearly 3 1/2 hours, Ljubicic had the demonstra­tive defending champion flail­ing. and then some. Saf'in buried his head in his hands, slammed balls into the net and directed at least one obscene gesture toward him­self. 
'Tm like this. I can't change," he said. "It's difficult to play the other way -lo be quiet on the court and nice to everybody. I'm getting angry with me, my coach. my father, everybody." 
He smiled and noted: 'Tm doing better. I didn't break any rackets today." 
Perhaps only because he won. Safin. trying to shake a yearlong slump compounded by injuries, rarely looked like the player who stunned the tennis world by routing Pete Sampras in last year's final. 
But in the tiebreakers Safin was poised, aggressive and a little lucky, and he closed out the win with a 136 mph ace. 
"I was a little bit scared but passed through," he said. "My tennis is coming back. Each time I feel better and better." 
After winning the first-set tiebreak, Safin was up 3-0 in the second when Ljubicic took an injury timeout. ATP trainer Juergen Dess massaged his lowe.r back as the Croatian player lay face down on center court at Arthur Ashe Stadium. 
The treatment worked. Ljubicic recovered and the two men traded serves of over 130 mph. Each player man­aged just one break and their huge serves produced a com­bined 37 aces. 21 for Ljubicic and 16 for Safin. Ljubicic made 65 unforced errors to 38 for Safiu. 
The end came on Safin's 

third match point after he had 
often been frustrated by mis­
takes that left him with his 
head hanging. 
Only 21, Safin fears he has already peaked, and he's dubi­ous about recapturing the form that overwhelmed Sampras a year ago. 
·1t was too perfect," Safin said. "I cannot play like this all the time. It can happen once in my life -last year." 
As if to prove it, in 2001 Satin hasn't won a tournament and has reached only one final. His best Grand Slam showing came at Wimbledon, where he advanced to the quarterfinals before losing to Ivanisevic. He has been slowed bv back and knee injuries but says he's healthy now. 
Safin went through three coaches in 2000 and this year hired seven-time Grand Slam champion Mats Wilander, who has worked with the Russian on his tactics and temper. 
'Tm not so confident like last year, so I have to start from the beginning, from the basics," Safin said. "Had a bad year -a horrible year, I could say. Better times will come for sure. I want to win a few more Grand Slam tournaments, and it will be perfect. 
"And I will win," he added with a laugh. "Otherwise I shoot myself." 
Despite the marathon, the Open remained largely upset­free. Four-time champion Pete Sampras won the final match of the night, beating qualifier Andre Sa 7-6 (4). 6-4, 6-3. 
"They're all tough." Sampras said. "All these guys are out to knock me out." 
Second seed and double U.S. Open champion Andre Agassi survived a second-round scare when he scored a hard-fought 6-7 (4-7). 6-4, 6-2, 7-6 (7-1) victory over Chilean Nicolas Massu. 
Massu, playing inspired ten­nis, kept Agassi on centre court for three hours and 20 minutes as he came back from a break down in the fourth set and saved triple match point in the 10th game to extend a match in doubt until the fourth-set tie-break.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. 
With his Los Angeles Sparks trailing Charlotte by double digits, Michael Cooper dido 't bother with any inspirational speeches or waste his time talking about the NBA champi­onships he won. 
Instead, Cooper simply called his team together and asked them if they wanted to win. The answer was a resounding "Yes." 
The Sparks played dominat­ing defense in the second half Thursday night and got 24 points and eight rebounds from Lisa Leslie in a 75-66 victory over the Charlotte Sting in Game 1 of the WNBA Finals. 
"Champions find a way to win. If I had to say anything to them that was it," Cooper said. "I can say all I want, but it's up to them to get it done. At win­ning time, they decided they wanted to get it done." 
The Sparks did it by holding Charlotte scoreless for over seven minutes in the second half, finally allowing a basket with 1:09 to play and the game out of reach. 
"We can't go into droughts against L.A.," Charlotte coach Anne Donovan said. "You can't not score for seven minutes and survive." 
Leslie showed why she was the MVP of both the regular season and the All-Star game with a dominating second-half performance to rally the Sparks from an 11-point deficit. 
''We didn't make good defen­sive decisions until the second half and I think it's fortunate that we won because we waited so late to become aggressive," Leslie said. 
DeLisha Milton added 19 points and Tamecka Dixon scored 12 for the Sparks. 
The Sparks need only to win one game on their home floor -where they are 18-1 this season -to close out the best­of-three series and join their counterpart, the Los Angeles Lakers. as champions this sea­son. 
Game 2 is Saturday. 
But the Sting, who started the season 1-10 before turning things around and winning the Eastern Conference title, are no strangers to adversity. They won their first tw.o playoff series by winning on the oppo­nents' court. 
"We've had our backs against the wall before," said Andrea Stinson, who led Charlotte with 

18 points. "We have to go in 
composed, ready to play and 
ready to do battle. They are 
going to come at us. but we're 
going to go in there and play 
hard." 
At first, the game seemed like 
a showdown between Stinson 
and Leslie and their different 
styles of basketball. 
They closed out the first half 
by exchanging baskets -Stinson making fancy jumpers using tricky dribbling and · behind the back passes, and 
Leslie answering by lowering 
her shoulder and driving the 
ball to the basket on consecu­
tive possessions 
But Stinson got the last word 
of the half. She missed on a 
running jumper in the final sec­
onds of the half, but scrambled 
for her own rebound, caught it 
in the air and heaved it back up 
and in for a 39-35 Charlotte 
lead at the break. 
"Stinson bad a very good 
game, she was just phenomenal 
coming off the picks," Leslie 
said. 
Stinson gave way to Allison 
Feaster at the start of the sec­
ond half, giving the former LA 
reserve ample opportunities to 
run the offense. She did,' scor­
ing on three consecutive 
jumpers to pad Charlotte's lead 
to 48-39. 
Another Stinson layup gave 
the Sting their largest lead of 
the night at 50-39 with 16:16 to 
play. 
After that, the Sparks ­
especially Leslie -seemed to 
wake up. 
Leslie and Dixon started an 
18-8 run with aggressive drives 
to the hoop that resulted in 
numerous trips to the line. 
After cutting the lead to 58-51, 
Leslie converted a pair of 
three-point plays that pulled 
the Sparks within one at 58-57 
with 8:35 to play. 
Dawn Staley answered with a 
3-pointer for Charlotte, but 
L.A. 's stifling defense shut the Sting down over the next six minutes, forcing five turnovers, hurried shots and bad passes. 
As Charlotte was self-destruc­
ting, the Sparks were taking 
off. 
lJkari Figgs scored on two 
running jumpers to give the 
Sparks a 63-61 lead they did 
not relinquish. Milton hit a 3 
only seconds after drawing her 
fifth foul and Leslie pushed it to 
68-61 with a spinning layup. 
"We were just trying to get the score back even and once we did, we were like sharks," Leslie said. "We went after them."

MEN'S SOCCER 

Irish set to kick off Big East competition 
Observer Scaff Report 

The Notre Dame men's soc­cer team will kick off its 25th season of varsity competition this Saturday night when it faces off at home against Big East rival Villanova. 
After two exhibition wins last weekend, Saturday's game marks Notre Dame's first season and first Big East game. 
Last year, the Irish topped the Wildcats 2-1 on Oct. 20 at Villanova. Junior Erich Braun scored both Irish goals to give Notre Dame the edge. 
Villanova went scoreless until Joe Noonan scored the Wildcats' only goal with 
11 :20 remaining in the game. 
Saturday also marks the inaugural season for head coach Bobby Clark, who signed on with the Irish in January after turning around the men's soccer program at Stanford University. 
Clark hopes to make simi­lar improvements here in South Bend, where Notre Dame is coming off a disap­pointing 7-8-2 overall record, and a 4-7 record in the Big East. 
The squad failed to qualify for the eight-team Big East conference tournament, fin­ishing ninth. 
This year's squad returns eight starters from last year's team, including cap­tains Griffin Howard, Andreas Forstner and Greg Martin. 
The Irish are entering the regular season after an undefeated weekend exhibi­tion tournament, as the defense held opponents Michigan and host team IPFW scoreless, and Notre Dame cruised to 5-0 and 3-0 victories. 
Clark hopes that the week­end exhibition tournament gave him and his team a good idea of where his team stood in terms of room for improvement. 
"We did some good things this weekend, but we also did some things that we need to work on," Clark said. 
However, he pointed out that, while decisive, the vic­tories of last weekend mean very little heading into the regular season. 
"It was just a preseason tournament," he said. "We know that we will have to step up our play because the talent level will step up." 
The key this season for the Irish will be improving on an offense that scored only 19 goals in 17 games last sea­son, while maintaining a dominant defense -led by Forstner and Howard -that shut out six of its 17 oppo­nents. 
The game kicks off Saturday night at 7 p.m. at Alumni Field.

Belles look forward to promising start 

By B.J. STREW SporlS Writer 
The 2001 season is a wel­
come breath of fresh air for the 
St. Mary's volleyball team. 
Bolstered by the return of 
four letterwinners and the loss 
of only one, the Belles are look­
ing to rebound from a frustrat­
ing 7-22 record last season. 
"There will be a lot of great 
competition," said head coach .Julie Schroeder-Biek, who is entering her seventh year at the Belles' helm. "We're really excited to face scholarship teams like St. Ambrose. We have good returners and promising freshmen adding 
depth to the lineup this year." 
For the upcoming season, 
Schroeder-Biek intends to 
quicken the offense and ulti­
mately the team as a whole. 
"We always need to be mak­
ing an attack," Schroeder-Biek 
said. "Our back row must 
always be poised to attack, as 
well." 
The invaluable experience of 
the 2001 squad will no doubt 
start from the top with captain 
Angela Meyers and fellow 
seniors Jaime Dineen, Jolie 
LeBeau and Denise Langlois. 
Langlois, however, will not be joining her teammates for the St. Ambrose tournament due to conflicting plans. 

In addition to the three seniors on the starting lineup, junior Elizabeth Albert, a transfer to St. Mary's and sophomore Alison Shevik will lend their skills to the team. 
Schroeder-Biek said th·at a freshman might get the coveted sixth spot on the squad, but competition for it is neck-and­neck. 
As for the recent change to the rules regarding scoring Coach Schroeder-Biek believes fans and players alike will enjoy a more intense atmos­phere. 
She is excited to see how it will alter the game dynamics, though she does not plan to alter her coaching style, adding, "We just to need to stay up and ready for rallying." 
A hard hitter, Meyers, who ranked 10th in the nation among NCAA Division Ill ath­letes for digs, has experience and leadership qualities that Schroeder-Biek hopes will help the Belles to become one of the top programs in the league.

GAME OF THE WEEK 


By GREG IADKY 
Spores Wricer 
The story lines will inevitably overshadow the Miami-Penn State game in Happy Valley Saturday 
night. . 
Joe Paterno is one win from tying Paul Bryant's record of 323 wins as a college head coach. The Nittany Lions will try to match that record in a newly renovated Beaver Stadium. 
The excitement will begin at the game's open­ing. Nearly a year ago, Penn State freshman Adam Taliaferro was par­alyzed against Ohio State. Doctors told him he might never walk again. Taliaferro responded with a promise that he would lead the Nittany Lions out onto the field someday. This Saturday, he will. 
The game itself features the talent loaded No. 2 Hurricanes versus anoth­er sub-par Nittany Lions team. The Hurricanes lost four players to the first round of the NFL draft, but somehow return an even more talented team. The strength starts up front with Bryant Mc Kinnie and Joaquin Gonzalez, who form one of the best tackle combina­tions in recent memory. 

McKinnie could have been the fifth Hurricane first rounder, but decided to stick it out in Miami. They are protecting Heisman candidate Ken Dorsey, as well as a slew of talented running backs. Dorsey threw for 2,727 yards and 25 touchdowns last year. 
On defense, the Hurricanes have one of the best secondaries around, highlighted by strong safety Edward Reed and rising star cor­nerback Phillip Buchanon. 
Penn State returns just nine starters from a team that went 5-6 last year. 
Starting quarterback Matt Seneca was mediocre at best in spot duty last year. but Paterno has promised he is the real deal. Six­foot-3, 330-pound Jimmy Kennedy has all-Big Ten ability and heads a strong defensive front for the Lions. 
If the Hurricanes keep their heads in the game itself early. they may be too talented for the Nittany Lions. The Nittany Lions need to harness the energy that will surround Beaver Stadium and jump ahead of Miami. Even the talented Hurricanes can't afford to fall behind in Beaver Stadium. 
OTHER TOP GAMES 
West Virginia at Boston College 
You can bet Bob Davie will tune in as these 2001 Irish opponents open Big East competition in Chestnut Hill. Both programs are coming off bowl game victories and look to join Miami and Virginia Tech atop the Big East. 
A lot bas changed in West Virginia since their 34­14 home victory over Boston College last year. Rich Rodriguez has taken over for longtime coach Don Nehlen. 
Rodriguez's defense returns nine starters from a unit that couldn't catch Irish running back Terrance Howard last October. The Mountaineers present dou­ble trouble at running back with Avon Colbourne and former Irish player Cooper Rego, first-cousin of cur­rent Irish back Ryan Grant. On the other sideline. Eagles star William Green is the best running back no one talks about. 
West Virginia may struggle for a while with Rodriguez's new offensive and defensive schemes. They need to run the ball well and control the tempo Saturday in order to win. Boston College has good talent at the skill positions and can score points quickly, complicating West Virginia's transition to a new scheme. 

Wisconsin at Oregon 
The Badgers are hoping that last Saturday's game against Virginia prepared them for the storm they will face in Eugene, Oregon. The Badgers are trying to implement a spread attack on offense. 
This plan failed versus Virginia. If not for two long touchdowns by wide receiver Lee Evans and several Cavalier turnovers. the Badgers would be 0-1. Coach Barry Alvarez bagged the spread attack at halftime last week and returned to the smash mouth style that has made Wisconsin the best program in the confer­ence over the last eight years. 
The Ducks are hoping to smell roses this year. Their offense is dynamite, led by Heisman candidate quar­terback Joey Harrington. The defense lost several starters, but All-Pac Ten corner Rashad Bauman claims this defense is the fastest and nastiest Oregon has ever had. 
Expect Oregon defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti to stick Bauman on Lee Evans and pose a riddle to the rest of the Badger offense. The Badgers must play their smash mouth football to have a chance. 
Eugene has emerged as one of the country's toughest stadiums for the visitors to succeed. The Ducks posses the nation's second longest home winning streak with eight in a row.

FOOTBALL 
Irish passing game remains untested 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Associate Sports Ediror 
Uncertainty is the word that best describes Notre Dame's passing game. 
Nobody knows how good it will be. Nobody knows how dangerous it could be. But more importantly, with the game on the line, nobody knows how the players will respond. 
"J don't know what we can do this year," said Kevin Rogers, Notre Dame's offensive coordinator. "I know that we can do more, and that has a lot to do with what the quarterback is capable of. I do know that we have three quality receivers." 
Rogers is confident that Notre Dame's top three receivers -David Givens, Javin Hunter and Arnaz Battle -will be potent weapons in Notre Dame's offense. And he's excited to have such a strong group. 
Last year. with Battle stnl a quarterback and Hunter sidelined by injuries, the Irish only had Givens and graduate Joey Getherall. And with untested quarterback Matt Lovecchio at the helm, the Irish didn't throw the ball that much. 
"Joey and David ... did a great job of being selfless guys last year, understand­ing that we didn't have a quarterback," Rogers said. "Last year was a deal where we didn't want to go out there and lose the game on offense. Hopefully we'll take a little different attitude and go out there and win the game this year." 
With Lovecchio, Carlyle Holiday and Jared Clark, the Irish have three quarter­backs who have valuable experience with the Notre Dame offense. 
And as Givens is quick to say, experi­ence is everything. 
"I think Matt, Carlyle and Jared Clark all have experience, and with experience comes maturity," he said. "I think we're all more experienced. I think that's a big part of throwing the ball more." 
Givens admits that he wants to play a more active role in the Irish offense. And while Notre Dame's top receiver would trade touches for wins in a heartbeat, he wants to play a more personal role in putting points on the board. 
The Irish have already worked on pass­ing drills more in practice than they did last year. And although Rogers is satisfied with the progress made by the quarter­backs and receivers, he isn't entirely con­fident yet. 
"We'll be able to know when we run this stuff under game tested situations," he said. 
Rogers isn't concerned about the physi­cal capabilities of the receivers. In Givens, the Irish have a flashy, quick playmaker with great hands. Hunter -if he stays healthy -provides a solid receiver on the other side of the field. And the quarter­back-turned-receiver Battle, who has already proven to extremely dangerous after the catch, could be an attractive man to run the ball on a reverse. 
But nobody knows how effective they can be in a game. And nobody will know until the Sept. 8 season opener against Nebraska. 
"The bottom line to us is to get open against bump and run and to be able to throw the ball accurately," Rogers said. "How well we can do that we'll find out soon."

to keep everyone organized." 
Wald rum described Pruzinsky as a "professional." comparing her to NFL great Jerry Rice in terms of her focus and commitment to excellence. 
"She doesn ·t know anything but all out." said Waldrum. "She gives you the same con­sistency all the time." 
Foundations of the legacy 
The rapid ascension of the Notre Dame women's soccer program to its annual Top 5 position began around the time Sobrero arrived on campus in the fall of 1994. That vear would see the Irish advance to the NCAA championship final. eventually falling to North Carolina 5-0. 
Sobrero would be an All­American her next four years, eventually securing a spot on the U.S. national team that won the World Cup in 1999. She was the youngest starting defender on that squad. 
Fourtime All-American Grubb commanded the back line in between Sobrero and Pruzinsky from 1996 to 1999, establishing herself as a hard­nosed defender with a knack for creating offense. Like Pruzinsky, Grubb was a central defender. charged with shut­ting down opposing forwards in the box. 
Grubb is one of only four four-time All-American defend­ers in NCAA soccer history, and has had two stints on the 
U.S. national team. As a senior, she also provided a defensive example for then-freshman Pruzinsky, who had always played forward in high school. 
"I learned a lot from Jen," 
said Pruzinsky. "I wouldn't have been able to make the transition [to defense] as easi­
ly." . Waldrum. who has worked with all three players, described Pruzinsky has having advantages over both Sobrero and Grubb. "The thing Vanessa has over both of them is that she was a forward," Waldrum said, com­menting on Pruzinsky's career as a high-school striker. where she scored 79 goals. "Vanessa is more skillful than Kate was." Pruzinsky recognizes the advantages of her striker expe­rience in terms of ball-han­dling. "I wouldn't have the comfort on the ball if I didn't play for­ward," she said. The coach described Pruzinsky as more of a pure defender as compared to Grubb, who had a tendency to look constantly for the offen­sive spark. "She is so much more of' a physical presence," he said. "Vanessa will defend first. then attack." Pruzinsky describes her play­ing style as "aggressive." 'Tm not a dribbler. you can't be on defense," she said. "I try to tackle hard." That ability for suffocating one-on-one defense, combined with lightning-quick recovery speed has made it difficult to over-emphasize Pruzinsky's worth as the soul of the Irish defense and one of the players leading the charge to the NCM tournament. 
Focus and commitment 
Notre Dame's legacy of domi­nant defenders is in the best of hands with Pruzinsky. 
Nothing is more a testament to her focus and commitment than her 4.0 GPA in one of 



Sophomore forward Amy Warner darts upfield during an exhibi­tion game earlier this fall against Iowa. Warner Is one of sever­al underclassmen coach Randy Waldrum expects to start. 
Notre Dame's most daunting majors -chemical engineer­ing. 
That figure landed her first­team Academic All-American honors, an award unheard of for a player in her sophomore year. She has found a balance between school and soccer that has lead to elite success in both. 
"The soccer gives me a really nice break from school," said Pruzinsky. "It's hard to find time for everything." 
Classic 
continued from page 28 
this year's team and last year's team is the style of play the Irish expect to imple­ment on the field. While last year's team relied heavily upon a possession strategy with the strong play of its experienced midfield, this year's Irish team hopes to capitalize on the blazing speed of its forwards and attack the goal a lot more fre­quently on offense. 
Waldrum is excited about the big play capability of his offense. 
"We have more offensive speed and athleticism up front. Hopefully, Amy Warner will pick up where she left off before her knee injury," Waldrum said. "Watch for Melissa Tancredi. She red­shirted last year with a knee injury, but she has played great in practice." 
While the Irish offense will be looking for some quick strikes against Penn State. the Irish defensfl will be con­cerned with stopping the offensive firepower of Penn State -most notably All­American Christie Welsh. 
The experienced Irish defense, led by junior Vanessa Pruzinsky and seniors Monica Gonzales and Lindsey Jones, should be up to the challenge of shutting down Welsh and her team­mates. 
The Irish midfielders may 

"I want to do everything I can to help the team win the national championship." she said. 
Waldrum knows his junior defender is up to the task. 
"The torch was passed from Kate to Jen, and now Jen to Vanessa," he said. "She knows that expectation, and she's doing a great job with it." 
Contact Jeff Baltruzak at Baltruzak.2@nd.edu. 
But grades haven't created the tremendous amount of respect from her fellow players that surrounds Pruzinsky the soccer player. 
"[The other players] look at her in awe," said Waldrum. "She has the utmost respect from everyone, and she gets along with everyone." 
With the Notre Dame defend­er legacy has to come expecta­tions. Pruzinsky, by all accounts, is the most qualified to accept the torch. 
have the most difficult task of all against Penn State. They must prevent offensive oppor­tunities for Penn State while at the same time make some critical passes in an effort to give the Irish forwards chances to score. 
The midfield will feature senior captain Mia Sarkesian along with juniors Ali Lovelace and Ashley Drier. Sophomore Randi Scheller looks poised to replace the All-American Anne Makinen at the other midfield position. 
Highly touted freshman Gunna Gunnarsdottir may also see some time at defense or midfield on Friday, but she is still recovering from a knee injury she suffered over the summer while playing with Iceland's national team. 
Irish goalie Liz Wagner also returns after a spectacular 2000 season. Wagner feels confident about the veteran defense in front of her. 
"Our defense and midfield should be real strong because we have a lot of experience there," Wagner said. "Christie Welsh is a very physical pres­ence so our whole team has to play good team defense in order to keep the ball away from her." 
In their two exhibition wins over the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Iowa, Notre Dame showed flashes of last year's brilliance, but the play­ers know there is still a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done in order for them to return to the College Cup. 
Sophomore forward Amy Warner feels that the team must play with greater inten­sity and execute better offen­sively in order to defeat Penn State. 
"We played decent in the exhibition games, but I know we can play much better." Warner said. "Penn State will be an extremely difficult opening appointment. Our practices have been much better recently so hopefully that intensity will carry over for this weekend. It would be great to start off this season the same way that we started off last season with a big win­ning streak." 
After tonight's clash with the Nittany Lions. the Irish will have little time to recu­perate as they take on No. 25­ranked Hartford on Sunday at 1 p.m. at Alumni Field on the second day of the Key Bank Classic. 
"This will be a good experi­ence for us to start off against some tough teams in the Key Bank Classic," Waldrum said. "We should immediately fig­ure out what adjustments we need to make as we look to return to last year's form." 
Hartford will play Friday night at 5 p.m. against the University of Connecticut prior to Notre Dame's game against Penn State. Connecticut and Penn State will play Sunday morning at 11 a.m.
