Evaluation, promotion procedures discussed 
by Marjorie Irr Staff Reporter 

The Facultv St>nate discussed last night the provost evaluation which is to be distributed to full-time faculty members on April 16. Action concerning the implementation of the present draft of the proposed Faculty Service Re~ort a_nd amendmen~ to procedures of appointments -and promotions m the Academic Manual were also discussed. 
The Senate passed a motion to limit participation in the evaluation of the provost to full-time, permanent faculty members. According to the minutes of the last meeting, the evaluation will include topics such as the provost's academic leadership and his effect on faculty morale. Those not eligible to vote include part-time and visiting faculty members, num­bering about ninety. 
Senate Chairman James Cushing explained that the full-time members are probably more able to provide an accurate evaluation of the provost than the visiting and part-time members who are less likely to be acquainted with the provost. rushing stressed that this is an evaluation and not a poll or a vote. 
Evaluation results not published 
A motion to publish tabulated results of the provost evaluation in the :'\otrP DamP Reports was unanimously opposed after the Senate proposed a subsequent motion to keep results of the survey confidential. Twenty-four members voted for publishing the results and none opposed the proposal to limit referral of the results to the Academic Council Review Committee, which includes Fr. Hesburgh a.nd Fr. Burtchaell, and the Board of Trustees. 
Faculty members participating in the evaluation will not be Informed of the results of the survey. 
The method of insuring confidentiality of the report was the next item discussed by the Senate. The body voted unanimously to allow the Executive Committee of the Faculty senate to ap­point "two suitable senior persons" to compile and transmit the results to the appropriate bodies. It was also decided to keep one confidential copy of the results in the Senate records. 
A proposal to withdraw a motion sent to the Steering Com­mittee of the Academic Council requesting that the proposed Faculty Service Report not be implemented passed with 22 votes. The Senate had earlier objected to the present form and sent the request to the Steering Committee before Fr. Burt­ehaell informed the Senate that the Faculty Service Report in its present form would not be implemented. The Senate stated that as long as the present draft was not being implemented, then it was safe to withdraw the motion. 
("onespondence on Service Reports 

Another proposal which passed Senate approval concerned correspondence between the Senate and Fr. Burtchaell on Faculty Service Reports. The vote was 22 for, 2 opposed and 1 abstention to the motion to circulate the stated correspondence to departments of the University, provided that Fr. Burtchaell also approves. If he does not, the Faculty Senate will circulate only what they send out. 
Additional ammendments were proposed to ammendments previously proposed by the Ad Hoc Committee on Procedures of Appointments and Promotions to rules stated in the Academic Manual. 
One motion proposed an amendment to divide the Ad Hoc Committee's report into two separate reports before sending to the Academic Council for further amending. The motion was defeated, with opposing members citing the fact that the report and the amendments would probably instigate further discussion and revision in the Academic Council, and the proposed amendment would be unnecessary .Other proposals dealt with wording in the Ad Hoc Committee's report. 
:'\ew members on Faculty Senate Affairs Committee 
Faculty Senate members voted to elect 2 members from 52 nominees to the Faculty Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees and 3 new members from 57 nominees to the Student Life Committee. Nominated at the meeting were Matthew Fitzsimmons, for election to the SLC and James Danehy to the Advanced Student Affairs Committee. 
Elections for next year's Faculty Senate will be held at the next and final meeting of the year on May 1.

The bill to limit the legal liability for colleges and universities in cases of underage student consumption of alcoholic beverages failed last night to reach the Indiana House floor. 
The bill isscheduledto come up for a final House vote today. The bill, drawn up with the assistance of General Counsel Philip 
. Faccenda, passed the Indiana Senate last February by a 46-3 margin. The bill now facing House consideration is an amended version of the Senate-passed bill. The House has amended the bill to provide that 18 year-olds in Indiana be allowed to enter establishments that serve alcoholic beverages as 
long as they do not consume alcohol. Under current Indiana law, only persons over 21 are permitted to enter taverns and restaurants that serve alcohol. 
If the House should pass the amended version of the bill, it will be sent to the Senate. If the Senate accepts the bill as amended, it will go directly to Governor Otis Bown for his signature. If the Senate rejects the amendment, the disputed provisions will be worked out in House-Senate conference. 
According to Faccenda, Governor Bown has indicated that he will sign the bill if it meets House approval. 
The bill, Senate Bill 282, is on the formal House agenda to be con­sidered before the end of the session this month. It is being sponsored by Senatr~ Majority Leader Philip Gutman <R l and Minority Leader Thomas Teague <D l. 
This session of the Indiana legislature has already seen the bill to lower the drinking age to 18 was killed in committee. 
Chester Dovis, chairman of the House Public Policy Committee, killed the 18 year-old drinking bill last month when he decided not to submit the proposal to a committee vote. 
The limited liability bill would free the Universities and colleges from strict liability for students who violate Indiana drinking laws. 
The bill was proposed after two cases in the Indiana State Supreme Court extended a broad in­terpretation of legal responsibility for underage drinking to persons who have knowledge of its existence. 

Story conflicts with Security report 

Woman reports attempted rape 
by Katie Kerwin Staff Reporter 
A Notre Dame woman reported that she was attacked near campus shortly before the Easter break, but was not seriously harmed. 
The woman an undergraduate student, reported an attempted rape occurring late in the evening on Wednesday, March 19. Accounts of the incident differ. 
The victim stated she was walking alone down Notre Dame Avenue towards the campus. Just before she reached Angela, a pick-up truck pulled up and the driver offered her a ride back to campus. She asked him if he could take her to the Circle and when he said yes, she got in. She described him as seeming to be "nice" and "friendly." 
When the truck reached the stoplight at Angela, the driver signalled a right turn. When the girl pointed out that he was going the wrong way, he asked her if he could take her to the Library Circle in­stead and she assented. 
Victim's account Instead of driving to the Library Circle, however, he took Ivy to Douglas and turned onto a side road off Douglas. He then said he had made a mistake and he would go back the other way. The victim said the man then stalled the engine. At this point, she decided that things were getting out of hand and she attempted to get out of the truck. The man grabbed her arm and she told him to leave her alone and pulled away. She kicked the door open and managed to slip out of the truck. According to the victim's story, he followed her and threw her down on the ground. He put his hand on her throat and she said she thought he was going to choke her. All this time she was struggling, kicking and trying to fight him off. During the scuffle her jacket was ripped and she told him she was going to get sick. He kept his hand on her throat for about a minute and then he got up, looking startled, she said. The assailant apologized, saying he was sorry and he wouldn't bother her anymore. He said he didn't know what came over him, but that he was sorry and would drive her back to campus. She hesitated at first, refusing and saying she would walk back, but at last he convinced her that it would be all right. She went along with him. partly because she didn't want to upset him and perhaps provoke another attack. She waited until he got in and then got in the other side of the truck, sitting as far away from him as possible. She rode back to the campus with him, keeping the door next to her open and holding it shut with her hand, ready to get out if he moved towards her. 

The victim said the man let her off, still apologizing, and she went back to her dorm and reported the incident to Notre Dame Security. She gave her account to both Security and the county police. 
The next morning she again talked to a woman from Security and also looked at some pictures shown to her by the county police. 
Security report , Arthur Pears, director of Notre Dame Security, when questioned 
about the attack, described it as a matter of a man making "improper advances" to a Notre Dame student. He said that a Notre Dame girl was hitch-hiking from downtown South Bend and was picked up by a man in a pick-up truck. The man drove past the campus, Pears said, and pulled into a side road off 
Douglas. 

According to Pears, the man then "made improper advances," but he did not pursue her and the girl did not have to fight him off. The assailant supposedly told her that if she resisted, he would leave her alone. She resisted and the man apologized, offering to drive her back to campus, which he sub­sequently did. He reportedly told her that he was sorry, Pears reported. 
Pears was very definite on the points that the girl was downtown when she got into the truck and that the man had not forced himself on her. 
When told of this account, the victim angrily stated that Pears' story was not the same as the ac­count she had given Pears.

The court noted that under state law, an unmarried woman who had a child could be con­victed of fornication and fined up to $100.

WASHINGTON (UPI) Energy consumption in the United States unexpectedly fell 
2.2 per cent in 1974 after climbing steadily for more than two decades, Interior Secretary Rogers C. B. Morton reported Wednesday. 
"This is the first decrease since 1952," Morton said. "I am delighted..! hope we are seeing the start of a new trend." 
If the reversal is a trend, he said, it means conservation efforts can effectively sup­plement President Ford's drive to increuse U.S. energy production and lower reliance on foreign oil supplies.

Viet Cong threaten to attack Saigon if US continues support 
By the <UPI>--The Viet Cong said Wednesday Communist ar­med forces will push on to Saigon unless the United States ends it support for South Vietnam's President Nguyen Van Thieu. 
Dinh Ba Thi, chief negotiator in Paris for the Viet Cong Provisional Revolutionary Government, told a news conference that if Thieu is ~replaced by a government willing to endorse the 1973 Paris peace agreement, the PRG would open talks immediately with the new Saigon administration on ending the war. 
Thi said President Ford's decision to send naval vessels and Marines into Vietnamese waters to help evacuate refugees was considered by the PRG an act of "war and provocation" that would be resisted. 
Thi was asked twice if the Viet Cong would march on Saigon. 
"If the U.S. continues to maintain in Saigon the bellicose clique of Nguyen Van Thieu and 
contues to sabotage the P~ris · Schlesinger said, "It Is not my 
peace accords, the South VIet­namese population and our armed forces will continue their fight." President Ford has ruled out any bombing by U.S. Air Force planes to assist the beleaguered South Vietnamese army against the onrushing communist offensive, a spokesman said today. 
Press Secretary Ron Nessen told reporters that Ford has no plans to resume the bombing operations which were abandoned in January, 1973, and noted "the law forbids it." 
"You've heard the President say many times, he does not have any plans to do that because of his own inclination and the requirements of the law," Nessen told reporters. "The law is very clear." Nessen made the statement after repor­ters told him that Defense Secretary James Schlesinger at a news conference in Washington earlier today appeared to leave the question of bombing open. 
decision to make. 
Nessen announced that Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger will arrive at Palm Springs Thursday and will meet with the President that night. He said Army Chief of Staff Gen. Frederick C. Weyand will be arriving from his fact-finding trip to Saigon sometime Friday. 
The President's aides disclosed Tuesday that diplomatic efforts to stop the communist offensive have been futile. 
"The President has a great deal of sympathy and compassion for the Vietnamese neonle. He con­tinues to feel this Communist onslaught is a gross violation of the Paris Peace Accord and, like any civilized person, he is greatly distressed," Nessen said. 
There was no indication from Nessen and the other senior aides mustered in Palm Springs on what Ford will decide the United States should do about Indochina. 
Third World Relief Fund 


Pledge drive raises thousands 
by Shawn Scannell Staff Reporter 

Professor Robert Rodes, on behalf of the organizers of the Notre Dame Third World Relief Fund Drive stated Tuesday that cash and pl~dge contributions ~y faculty and campus employees m the drive totaled $13,959.90 as of the end of March. 
The pledge drive, initiated in early in February, allowed faculty and university employees to have contributions deducted from their paychecks. 116 faculty and 145 employees have so far par­ticipated. These deductions, plus 
various cash donations, have amounted to this figure. 
Four persons donated $500 or more, 39 contributed between $100 and $499, and 36 gave between $50 and $99, making a total of 88 donating more than $50. Some faculty organizers expressed 
disappointment at these relatively meager results, but hoped that a foundation had been established for a more substantial response in future years. 
According to the preferences indicated by the contributers, the contributions are to be distributed to these seven organizations at the following rates in percent: 
Campus parking permits are opened to freshmen 
by Karen Sikorski Staff Reporter 

Dean of Students John Macheca has approved a proposal by the Freshman Advisory Council permitting freshmen to have cars on campus for the rest of the school year. 
The decision, announced Tuesday, March 18, was made in conjunction with the Freshman Year Office and the Security Of­fice. It went into effect im­mediately after break. 
According to the proposal submitted to the Office of Student Affairs, freshmen will be able to apply for parking permits in lot D­1, where an estimated 50· 75 spaces are available. If more students apply than can be accomodated in lot D-1, they will be able to park in the White Field north of the lot, which has space for about 100 cars. 
Applications should be made at 
the Security Office and will be 
accepted on the basis of the 
student's grade point average for the first semester, also taking into account any deficiency slips received. A student with a grade point average of at least 2.0 , and who has no deficiencies is eligible 

to receive a permit. 

Explaining the reasoning behind this requirement, Macheca stated, "Giving this privilege to students who do not meet these requirements would be a disser­vice to them, since it would create a diversion from their academic pursuits. " Dean Hofman and I felt it was important not to work against the best interests of any students." 
Students who have brought cars 
to campus are encouraged to apply 
for registration as soon as possible 
to avoid being ticketed. A three 
dollar fee will be charged to those 
whose applications are accepted. 

Freshmen who have brought 
cars but do not meet the 
requirements will be permitted to 
park them without being ticketed, 
but will not be able to use the cars 
for the remainder of this semester.

The administrative cost of the pledge drive amounted to $525.26, which the University absorbed. The drive's organizers expressed their appreciation to Mr. Gary Marmontello for handling the administrative details.

Hotline is a 'Brainstorm' 
John Kenward Staff Reporter 

Cathy Falkenberg of 120 Breen· Phillips has been awarded the Grand Prize for her idea of a campus hotline in the Operation Brainstorm contest. 
Operation Brainstorm, an idea contest sponsored by the Om­budsman Service which ran from February 24 to March 12, con­cluded with the announcement of 10 winners, three each in the Social, Service, and Policy categories and a Grand Prize. 
Falkenberg's 50-dollar award­winning idea suggested the establishment of a campus hotline manned by students to take calis from other students and talk about any problems or anxieties they might have. 
Falkenberg further suggested that possibly sociology or psychology majors would work in the service. 
Judges for the contest, Dean Vincent Raymond, Mildred Kristowski, and Richard Sullivan ­all faculty -staff members o f the Ombudsman Advisory Board ­chose the other nine winners on the basis of originality, practicality, and implementation suggestions.. 
First place winners are to receive two tickets to an upcoming concert,not necessarily within this semester; second-place winners were awarded three dollars worth of McDonald's gift certificates: and third-place winners were each given an Bx10 autographed glossy of an ND favorite. 
By categories the winners are the following: 
In the Policy Category, the first­place award was given to Guy G.G. Wroble for his "Roommate preference" idea that suggests using computer cards in matching freshmen roommates. The survey would include such small but important personal distinctions as smokers and night owls. Second in this catogory was John Meuleman and his "Pre-registration in the ACC or Stepan Center" idea which advises complete advance registration in one of the buildings to avoid the helter-skelter in the 
campus-wide procuring of class cards. 1 mrd for the Policy Category was Joe Langenfeld and his "Project Rainbow" university district" suggestion. 
In the Social Category, Robert Sweeney, Jr. took first place with his "Computer Dance" entry. Second place was awarded to Kathy Horwath for her "Skating at the ACC" idea which would allow free skating for all students as well as late night skating and the issuance of skating equipment. 
Third prize was given to John J. Callahan for his "Dance Concerts" idea that would "make a dance more than a dance and make a concert more than a spectator event." . 
The Service Category first-place winner Joe Scott suggested a spring cleanup drive in the Nor­thwest neighborhood tavern district "To improve relations between students and the families living in that neighborhood." Scott also added that the drive could be followed up by a Student Govern­ment sponsored post-cleanup party or picnic. 
Second prize winner in the same category was Chris Reddick for his suggestion that road maps of the surrounding area be distributed along with information on bus routes and bicycle routes. Third place was given to Ken Hallett for his idea that a "quickie beginning typing class" be established at the beginning of each fall semester. 
Riehle to study energy waste as campus fuel costs increase 
by Michele Arrieh Staff Reporter 

Fr. James Riehle has been appointed Director of Energy Conservation at Notre Dame and will be examining methods of reducing energy consumption on campus. Riehle stated, "The recent budget for fuel has doubled from 1112 million dollars last year to 211.z million dollars this year, which is a substantial increase for the university." 
The new director believes that "people should be aware of the higher cost of fuel." He further stated that, "even a 10 percent of cost would mean a $250,000 savings, which isn't a small sum." 
Riehle discussed the need to 

"reduce unnecessary lighting in 
university offices and 
classrooms." He stated, 
"Although the campus power 
system is run efficiently, the three 
necessary fuels of oil, gas and coal 
have increased in cost tremen­
dously." 
"Fr. Hesburgh saw the need inestablishing a full-time and extensive committee to handle the problem of energy waste," stated Riehle. "The former Energy Conservation Committee reduced fuel consumption by one-third is in the past two years by eliminating unnecessary lighting around the ACC, the library and other outdoor buildings." 
Riehle added, "All heat was 

turned off in the dormitories 
during Christmas vacation." 
Riehle cited the interest in fuel conservation on other university campuses around the country. He stated, "Purdue has done much work in this area and we will be examining its techniques in controlling energy waste along with other schools."

Hesburgh's letter 

To the Notre Dame Faculty, Staff, and Students: 
The inflationary costs of fuel and the overall energy crisis in which we find ourselves make it im­perative that we do everything possible at Notre Dame to con­serve energy. An Energy Con­servation Committee was formed and has been under the direction of Reverend James F. Flanigan, 
C.S.C. There have been noticeable· savings in energy because of the work of this Committee, for which I I commend them and all of you. It is my intention to keep this Committee in progress, but the Committee itself recommended that a person be appointed who would devote most of his time to the plannning for and achieving of energy conservation. 
It is with this in mind that I am appointing Reverend James F. Riehle, C.S.C., as Director of Energy Conservation, He will have an office in the Ad­ministration Building and I ask each one of you to cooperate fuJJy with him. 
It connot be overlooked that any savings in energy will also save dollars in our fuel budget. You may not be aware of the fact that in the last two years, the cost of fuel alone has increased Over $1,000,000; that is, the fuel cost in our budget for 1975-76 will be more than $1,000,000 higher than that in the 1973-74 budget. This certainly speaks to the need of fuel con­servation for both conservation of 
energy and also for the con­servation of our funds . 
W count on your complete cooperation with both the new Director and the Energy Con­servation Committee. 
With many thanks, I am Ever devotedly in Notre Dame, <Rev.> Theodore M. liesburgh, 
C.S.C. President

letters from innsbruck 
After a short visit to Israel, it is hard to Imagine that this is such a troubled area. 
The people appear calm and oblivious to the potential of war. Both Jews and Arabs go about their affairs with a business-like attitude. Soldiers, with machine guns nonchalantly slung around their shoulders, blend in with civilians on the streets and busses. 
The land, even frontiers, seem peaceful. Mt. Hermon, within eyesight of the Syrian army, has developed Israel's prime ski resort. Of course, a midnight stroll along the Lebanese border is not recommended, but the same holds true for Central Park. With few exceptions, only the sounds of Israeli Army jeeps break the quiet. 
By far, the greatest concern among the citizens is the fragile state of the economy, something they must live with daily. The monetary hemmorage needed to pay for the Yom Kipper War of 1973 swamped the prosperity built since the Six-Day War of 1967. During those years, Israel was beginning to know a little luxury and im­prove a standard of living that had been harsh since the founding of the state. But the cost of the latest ignited a 40 percent inflation and damaged the important tourist industry. The price spiral has forced the people to scrimp again, a bitter pill after hopes for better. 
The prosperous years were a great building time for the country, and its results are evident everywhere. The area of an­cient civilizations is very modern now. Big cities, small towns and countrysides sprouted a proliferation of new apartmentsand community facilities. Tel Aviv is less than 70 years old, so even the"Old Section" looks of recent vintage. Even Jerusalen has been largely rebuilt, except for the Old Quarter and Arab sector. 
The material surge also benefitted that most Israeli of creations, the kibbutz. Kibbutzim constitute communism in practice, in as pure a form found anywhere. A group that decides to form such a com­mune obtains land from the government, then sets to work on it. The first years are rough; the families live in tents, but all possessions are held in common and all dividends are divided equally. As the farm pays off better, the kibbutz develops more. During the good years many places built theaters, swimming pools, hotels and raised dietary standards, in addition to improving the living quarters. Though only a small 
the passivity of israel 
fraction of the populace, kibbutzim perhaps ' best represent the country's spirit and drive in the face of adversity. 
The most remarkable part of Israel or perhaps the world has to be the Old Quarter of Jerusalem. If one cannot feel hope for mankind here, then he never will. In this center for the three great religions, people of every conceivable belief and background, if not dancing arm-in-arm, at least co-exist peacefully, quite a feat considering the hostilities that swirl not far away. With the walls of the Old City, the Jewish, Christian, and Arab quarters all display distinct personalities, yet accept each other as men. 
Orthodoxy is the main influence in the Jewish quarter. The men walk about in traditional garb: long black coats, rounded black hats, long, braided hair and beards. The food here is strictly kosher. There are several synogogues, but the holiest are located on the edge of and outside the quarter. The Wailing Wall, the sole rem­nant of an ancient temple, borders the Arab sector, and all accesses to the wall are under tight security. Worshippers face the wall, often touch it with their hands, saying their prayers to God. According to Hebrew tradition, men are separated from the women by a screen running from the middle of the wall in this case. Outside the Old City walls stands the Tomb od David, containing many artifacts from the time of this great king. 
When considering the Christian Quarter, one must always remember to divide by three,since most everything is split between the Orthodoxy, Armenian, and Catholic churches. The fourteen stations of Christ's journey through Jerusalem are all marked by churches. The Church of the Holy Sepulche, containing the Calvary, An­nointing Stone, and the Tomb of Christ within one hundred feet of each other, is also a tripartite arrangement, with the floor space within the church being divided. The Calvary fell into the Armenian portion. Three candles stand on each end of the Annointing Stone, one for each religion. The Tomb is a two chambered structure; the larger, outer chamber is split three ways, while the smaller chamber comes under Orthodox control. The Catholics lost out this time. 
A large, open-air market winds through the streets of the Arab Quarter, coming right up to the walls surrounding the Dome of the Rock. Much more variety is found 
'I Do I I Do!' 
The ND-SMC Theater production of I Do! I Do! will open Friday, April4 at the Little Theatre in Moreau Hall at 8 p.m. Additional performances will be given Saturday and Sunday, April 5 and 6. 
The play, written by Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones, is billed as a light musical comedy portraying fifty years of the marriage of Michael and Agnes. The entire play is set in the couple's bedroom and contains scenes from their wedding night, their first, problems with their children and their struggles with aging. 
The role of Michael will be played by Scott Wahle, a senior from Hingham, Massachussetts, and the role of Agnes will be plated by Bridget Ragan, a sophomore from Wayland, Massachussetts. Both players are Notre Dame students. 
l Do! I Do! contains such well-known songs as "My Cup Runneth Over" and "What is a Woman?" Schmidt and Jones are also known for their highly successful musical, The Fa ntastiks. 
Kirk Packo, a senior from Oregon, Ohio, is directing the play and costuming is being managed by Kathy Gaffney, a SMC junior from Stamford, Connecticut. Tickets may be purchased tat the door on the performance nights and the box office will be open for sales at 7 p.m. Tickets are one dollar. 
here than in the tourist shops of the other sectors, because the natives themselves shop here, often in the long robes and headdress identified with Arab sheiks. The dome of the Dome is the most imposing monument in Jerusalem, covered with gold and impossible to miss in the sunlight. The mosque covers the rock where Mohammed ascended to heaven, and is a masterpiece of artistic tilework. Unfortunately, its location inside Israel complicates peace efforts, since the question of who should control the land underneath it becomes a very emotional issue. 
Just outside the Dome another con­troversy has arisen over practice of Israel's national hobby, archeology. In many places throughout the country the people have unearthed traces of past civilizations, 
by fim o 'reiley 
particularly in t~e desertregions. Now, the Israelies have begun digging along the inside walls of the Arab quarter, leaving the Arabs to claim that the area is being defaced. They have responded by forcing Israel off the science and cultural com­mittee of the U.N.,· further heightening animosities between the two sides. 
Which ever way one feels about the 
· Mideast situation, admiration for Israel cannot be denied. Against long odds and many challenges they have carved them­selves a home in the desert, and are working hard to persevere. They feel the large Arab forces on their borders, some resignedly awaiting another war. They persevere, however, and build on in the firm belief that God had meant this land to be their home, something they will never surrender. 
st. paddy's day 

What really to expect? Leprechauns and magic had long passed from mind, but surely something of popularized Eire would surface on this most Irish of days. Knowing the exaggerated Irish spirit in New York and Chicago (was Daley's river green again this year? l, and being forewarned that Ireland would not match that foolishness, my excitement was tempered, but the Irish half of me was drawn irresistably by St. Patrick's charms. 
So, I and throngs of transplanted coun­trymen journeyed from London to Hol head a ort in Wales, and on to Dublin

culture. . Spicy Irish wit contrasted the stories about Belfast murder, and violence even in Dublin. , 
On the 17th we arose to find a steaming American-sized breakfast, the kind lady gone, as we soon learned, to buy us shamrocks. With the clover pinned to our collars, and a brogued farewell floating out the door, we felt more Irish than American as we mixed with the crowds moving toward O'Connel St. and the parade. 
To our surprise the city was filled, with the peoples of a holiday throng. Though not

by ferry. Though certainly they tried, the local dignitaries couldn't quite dye the entire channel. I landed in Dublin on the 16th, at 8:30a.m. At this hour on a Sunday morning a city is not expected to be jum­ping, but it took three hours just to throw on a robe and get a cup of coffee, much less resemble a capitol city. Convincing evidence, though, of Dublin's existence was the sinus-opening Liffey river sludging by the station: no city would dare call itself major without such a symbol of progress. Unnecesary to dye this river--as I walked along, it changed color so many times that green was bound to appear at some point. 
Better things lay ahead, bless St. Pat. Crossing the Liffey at O'Connel St., Dublin's Champs Elysees, I trod the way to St. Stephen's Green, a wooded park, where I took refuge from the rain until a scheduled meeting time of noon. At the proper place, I found two fellow Innsbruckers, one O'Brien and the other Czechoslovak <he likes to drink l, and after salutations and the necessary vulgarities we tramped away to find our hopefully free lodging, wit)l a relative of Chris'. 
We walked into the arms of an authentic 
representative of Ireland. This lady was a 
total stranger to Chris, but warmly 
welcomed us with a cup of soothing Irish tea 
and cakes, a practice she continued 
throughout our stay. That evening, sitting 
around the fireplace, she and a jolly, round 
friend gave us a view into the country's interest were as strong as in the Erin Isles of Chicago, Boston, and New York. The large parade, replete with American high school bands, jaunted along its mile route, with

an appreciative mood, and after much was 
l
sung and danced, and the carousing had ebbed a bit, we careened home <thank God we didn't have to cross the Liffey, or it would have turned yet another color). As always, the reliable Mrs. Erley had sand­wiches and tea awaiting us, and then a little warm, confused conversation finished St. Patrick's Day. 
We stayed in Dublin two more days, to know the city a little better, and to catch as many witticisms and anecdotes of Mrs. Erley's as possible. But the high point of the stay was the St. Patrick's Day celebration, and whatever leprechauns had appeared took their last pint and were off, as the city became quiet again. I left knowing that as dutifully as he tries, Mayor Daley will never be able to create as green an atmosphre as exists in Dublin on March 17th, the day for St. Patrick.

TENNIS COACH Tom Fallon's players went undefeated in Galveston and are preparing this week for away matches against Ball State and Ohio State this weekend. 
Devine debuts today in opening football practice 
by Bill Brink Sports Editor 
One of the things head football coach Dan Devine is being indoctrinated to as he be~ins his tenure. at Notre Dame is the weather. The first day of sprmg practice, Devine's first da~ at the helm, was delayed yesterday by what Will undoubtedly not be the last spell of unfavorable weather, and the eagerly-awaited appearance is scheduled for this afternoon. 
But whether or not the outlook is sunny for the new head coach depends on how you view it. Though a good number of lettermen return, 14 starters are gone, nine from the offense. The competition for starting .berths in the yaca~ed of­fensive backfield and hne and the Juggbng of defensive assignments should make for an in­teresting month of football. 
"Naturally I'm very excite~ about sprin~ drills/' says Devine. "We'll be ?<?mg some thm~s di!­ferently and with all the positions we have to fill this practice session is crucial for us." 
Perhaps the most crucial task is replacing the depleted offense. Three-year star~er Tom Clements is gone at quarterback and expenenced runners AI Samuel, Eric Penick, and leading rusher Wayne Bullock are also gone. Fifth year man Frank Alloco who has another year of eligibility because of an i'njured sophomore season, is ~iven. the edge
-right now at quarterback though semor RICk Slager and a host of talented sophomores will also be comoeting. Reuturning rushers include Art Be~t, Mark McLane. Tom Parise, Russ Kornman, Jim

The Irish rugby team will travel just about anywhere to find the best in rugby competition. Notre Dame's squad flew out to sunny California for warm sun, that Colorado beer, and unfortunately three losses. 
The Notre Dame rugby 'A' side lost to California at Irvine 23-11, were defeated by the San Diego club 20-4, and dropped a tough 23-9 decision to the SC Trojans. 
Before their West Coast trip the ruggers downed the local South Bend team 28-10 under the lights at Cartier Field on St. Pat's Day. Scoring for ND were: Doug Mosser, Tony Mendiola, John Froman, Mike Halman, Mike Tovey, and Mitch Wilkes, handling the kicking duties. 
In the loss to Irvine, Mitch Wilkes hit a three-point penalty kick and Froman and Mosser added a try each for the Irish of­
-fense. Mosser tallied the sole try against the San Diego team. Team captain Larry Casey scored a four­point try against SC, with Wilkes converting on one conversion and one penalty kick for NO's nine points. "We had some team members in the serum who couldn't make the trip because of finances, but we still managed to play well in the first half of all the games," commented Casey, "but un­fortunately the other teams scored quickly on us in the second half which broke our spirit and

mementum. 

"The team picked up much valuable help from the tour, especially from the Irvine and Southern Cal teams," added senior Casey. "SC beat us on plays from the serum, which we are now in­corporating into our game plan." 
The ND 'B' side was a bit more successful in California losing only to Cal-Irvine 19-8, yet defeating San Diego 11-o and SC 13-10. The 'B's also turned the South Bend 'B' team around, winning 13-3. 
In the South Bend contest, Bill Jacobitz, Sean McDonald, George Faherty, with Mark Keown kicking, scored in the Irish win. George Spiegel and McDonald scored in the sole loss to Irvine. 
John Lukanich and Chris Lombardi scored tries for ND and kicker Keown notched a penalty three-pointer. Keown added a conversion and a penalty kick, Tony Mendiola scored a four­pointer, and Pete 'Stymie' Schreck scored the winning try in the 'B's defeat of the Trojans. 
"The 'B's really played well, giving each of the teams a good game," offered Casey. 
The Irish ruggers hope to open 
their official season this weekend 
with a rebound victory over the 
Bowling Green Falcons. 

The games against Bowling Green are at home Saturday af­ternoon on the fields behind Stepan. The 'B' game is at one, 'A' at two and the 'C's square off at 
three. 

Weiler and Terry Eurick. 
All-American receiver Pete Demmerle will probably be replaced by senior Kevin Doherty. The rest of the offensive line will sport some new names, with guard AI Wucjiak the only returning starter. Co-captain Ed Bauer, senior Steve Quehl on his way back from an leg injury, and Elton Moore, Cal Balliet and Vince Klees will try to fill the gap left by the graduation of experienced lineman like Steve Sylvester, Steve Neece, Mark Brenneman and 
Gerry DiNardo. 
"Obviously we're going to have to completely rebuild the offense," says Devine. "We've lost our entire starting backfield including Tom Clements who started for three years. All-American receiver Peter Demmerle is also gone as are most of the interior lineman." 
There is less void to fill on the defense, though some excellent players have left. Most notable is the absence of star linebackers Greg Collins and Drew Mahalic. Tony Novakov, Doug Becker and Pete Johnson are all up at the top of the replacement list, while Tom Eastman presently has the edge at the middle linebacker spot. 
The defensive line is a definite bright spot with standouts Steve Niehaus and co-captain Jim Stock returning at the end positions. Niehaus may very likely be switched back to his natural tackle position, joining frosh Jeff Weston. The other end spot would thzn be up for grabs among Tony Zap­pala, John Galanis, Ivan Brown and others. 
Reggie Barnett is the only starter graduating from the defensive backfield, but the starting berths are bv no means set, and the scramble for them
