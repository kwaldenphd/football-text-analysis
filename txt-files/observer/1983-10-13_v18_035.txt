Hesburgh urges nuclear education 
Special to The Observer 
TORONTO -Notre Dame presi­dent Father Theodore Hesburgh challenged educators and their in­stitutions this morning to organize themselves in opposition to the nuclear arms race. 
"Our students especially must learn that they are not powerless," Hesburgh said at a joint meeting of the Amerit:an Council on Education and the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada. "The groundswdl is there in the freeze movement, but this is just a first step and the whole movement needs more creative direction and focus." 
Hesburgh pointed out the efforts of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and his own efforts to bring together in­ternationally prominent scientists and religious leaders to devolop ways to slow the arms race. 
He said Notre Dame's new course Nuclear Dilemma uses the American Catholic bishops' recert pastoral letter on war and peace as a text, and he applauded the newly es­tablished Inter-Faith Academy of Peace at Notre Dame's Ecumenical Institute for Advanced Theological Studies in Tantur,Jerusalem. 
The nuclear dilemma should con­cern educators aot just politicians -Hesburgh said. 
"If we do not learn and teach our students how to cope with this primordial nuclear problem," he said, "we need not worry about all 
the others. After total nuclear con­
flagration, all human problems are 
moot." 
Hesburgh said there is now the equivalent of four tons of TNT for every human being, "not just theoretically there," but "targeted, poised on a delivery system, hair­triggered to a very fallible com­puter." 
"There is a decision time often or fifteen minutes, much less on the field of battle, and there .will be practically no time for decision once these systems are placed in space," he said. 
Disagreeing with the contention that the Soviets alone have fueled the arms race "while we have presumably been sitting on our hands," Hesburgh said, "well, while we have been sitting on our hands, we have developed the MX with 10 warheads, the Trident submarine with new superaccurate missiles, the Pershing II, the cruise missile, the B-l bomber and the upcoming Stealth bomber which will make the B-1 obsolete." 
Hesburgh has tried privately to bring together internationally known scientists and leaders of the world's major religions to make common cause against nuclear weapons. 
The Toronto meeting of the American and Canadian education councils was the first joint con­ference of North America's two major educational associations.

Azone variance for the planned addition to Galvin Life Science Center was unanimuu~ly approved last week by the St. Joseph County Board of Zoning Appeals. The variance was needed because tht· addition will extend too near to Juniper Rd. to meet standard zoning regulations, according to Don Dedrick, director of physit"al plant at Notre Dame. Construction of the S3 million addi­tion is expected to begin in January. -The Observer 
Despite an apologyfrom city officials, a woman who was arrested and detained by police as she drove to a hospital to give birth says she still plans to sue the Detroit suburb of Fraser. City officials mailed a letter of apology Friday to Kathleen Wise, 31, of nt'ighhoring Mount Clemens. However, Wise said Tuesday after receiving the letter that she still plans to file suit. Police stopped Wise Aug. 29 for a broken taillight. She then was arrested for a 1980 traffic violation and held at the police station until her parents arrived to post S2S bail. She delivered a boy six hours later at a Warren hospital. -AP 
An investigation has been ordered on the Los Angeles County computer system used to process traffic tickets after three court clerks were charged with accepting bribes to fix tickets. The investigation was ordered Tuesday to determine whether the sys­tem requires additional safeguards. Investigators said people were able to have traffic tickets dismissed without going to court by paying part of their fine at the Long Beach Municipal Court clerk's office. The defendants alkgedly pocketed the money and entered a record of a dismissal of those cases into the court's computer, said

With all the controversy about Christie Hefner and Playboy Enterprises, what does the University get out of her visit? 
A lot. 
Ifat first it seems improbable that Hefner's visit could give Notre Dame some academic credibility, one must realize how University administrators could exploit Hefner by saying that they, as Voltaire, believe all per­
sons have a right to say what they want. 
In effect, the University and business college, by inviting Hefner to speak, may try to convince secular academians that the bastion of conservative American Catholicism is an open-minded institution which allows anyone to voice her or his ideology.

Some might object to Hefner's views as "antithetical to everything the Church teaches," as law professor and abortion critic Charles Rit:e does. Hut Heti1er is by no means only concerned with publishing Playb(~}' magazine. 
Few can dt·ny Hefner is a successful businesswoman -one: who heads a multi-million dollar organization which indudes gambling casinos, hotels, and movie studios. 
The magazine itself is much more: than pro-abortio'n editorials or centerfolds of nude models. Playboy publishes fine investigative articles and in-depth analyses of social problt•ms -topics which few other magazines would touch with a 10-foot pole. 
What scares me most about Hefner's visit is that abor­tion critics have hogged the debate. I too do not favor abortion. But to make Hefner's visit

a battle between pro-choice and pro-life activists is to ignore the another great moral problem Playboy and the Notre Dame College of Business Administration face -rabid capitalism. 
Hefner is a successful businesswoman who was invited to Notre Dame not because the magazine is at the forefront of unconventional muckraking, but be­cause PlayboyEnterprises is a profit-making member of capitalist society. 
The business college simply asked Hefner to speak at 
Notre Dame what 
versity cover up the visit? 
Notre Dame's Office of Information Services issued a press release announcing Hefner's visit. The wording of the release. however. belies the llniversity's warped respect for capitalistic success as it <.:harts the rapid rise of Hefner in the corporation her father started 30 yt·ars agl>. 
Administrators who may have feigned embarrass­ment now may soon exploit Hefner's visit. They probably will claim the entire University is open­minded because such a controversial tlgure as Hefner spoke. And single-issue con~ervatives such as Rice will play into administrators' hatids by taking issue against Hefner's visit not because she is a devout capitalist, hut because she favors abortion. 
And that's too had.

ference in the way alcohol is used," said Beauchamp. "It would be very good ifthe students did it, but unfor­tunately they don't seem to and the administralion has to come across as the heavy." 
. Party rules can make a huge dif­ference in the use ofalcohol, accord­ing to Beauchamp. Tyson added, "Social space can determine parties and the use qf alcohol at them. It's partially a space and enviroment problem." 
All four of the committee mem­bers said it is too early to tell the results of the committee's study and what it's recommendation will be. 
However, only Callaghan and Tyson said they were in favor of the present situation and laws. Tyson said, "I'd like to refine the present rules." Callaghan said. "I'm in favor of the present situation, but I think some question have to be answered and some changes may have to be made." 

The three priests said they sup­port tougher policies if that would solve the problem. Tyson said, "I'm willing to go to a dry campus ifthat is what is needed, but I'd really rather not." Beauchamp agreed saying, "If solving the problem requires toughening ofthe rules, such as a dry campus, so be it."

A letter to and from the editor 
/)ear Editor: 
Endosl·d is a 2'5 page letter addressing five subjl-cts. I hope you'll run it on consecutive days without editting, since I are a exellent writer. 
The first pages are a rebuttal of Bob Ilinl·kley's response to Joe Calkins letter on Smith's comments about C. Reilly's feelings on the immorality of breathing. I argue that if (iod thought breathing was morally accept­able, why would he allow pollution to exist? 
Either breathing is wrong, or there is no God. 
Keith Picher 
Profundity's demise 
The next part of my letter concerns a more important subject. As I was sifting through my kitchen the other day, I found my grandmot­her's old recipe for black raspberry dum­pling.o;. Printing it on the Viewpoint page would be a great service to the community. I think her ingredients will stir up a good deal of 
controversy around campus (most people use 
less baking soda and plain, not whole-wheat 
flour.) 

My letter's third part is a rebuttal. That in­fantile, moronic, un-Christian, little snob who writes "Inside" columns has gone a bit too far this time. In his column ofNovember 7, 1981 he asserts the speed of light is 186,200 miles per second. If he had bothered to exercise some journalistic responsibility he would have discovered that light travels at 186,282 miles a second. I know he wrote the column nearly two years ago, but many of us are still 
upset by his irresponsible comment. My letter is three times longer than the original column, but please leave it unchanged since the entire essence will be lost ifyou alter a word. 
The fourth portion of my letter concerns a recent comment made by your editor-in­chief. He states "I like the yellow paint in my room." How can anyone make such a blatent racial slur. Though the comment clearly indi­cates his hatred for Indians, Islamics, and left­handed people, it also suggests (albeit 
implicitly) his Communist ties with Muam­
mer Qadaffi. When will your paper exhibit 
some journalistic professionalism? 
The last portion ofmy text concerns several 
writers on The Observer staff. Miss Manners, 
Berke Breathed, Mr. Larson, Max Lerner, and 
Mr. Associated Press all refuse to comment on student . life here at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. I think you should sit down and have a talk with each ofthem about their 'holier than thou' attitude,' and fire them ifthey don't im­prove. I could do a better job than any of them. 
Please run my letter in large type in the up­per left hand comer uf the page. A staff artist should compose a cartoon for each article. Also, run the article in three columns instead ofthe usual four. The headline should be done in either standard or italic type (after all, I wouldn't want to infringe on your respon­sibilities as editor ofthe page.) 
Very, very, very sincerely yours, 
M.l. Twofaced Masters Candidate in the Obvious 
DearMr. Twofaced: 
Rarely do I·write letters to those who sub­mit material for publication. I have decided not to run your 25 page letter to the editor, and have wntten•this letter so I can avoid talking to you personally. 
My decision was difficult. When a letter like yours finds its way to my mailbox, I either throw it away or publish it in its entirety. If I throw it away I keep the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's community from reading your anti-intellectual drivel. If I publish it, HOOO 
people will learn how naive you arc. 
·Don't misunderstand me, The Obseroer al­ways is looking for letters which arc typed (to keep our typists happy), concise (to keep our readers happ.y) and well thought-out (to keep me happy.) 
Whtn I receive letters. like yours, though, I wonder whether you're more concerned with seeing your name in print orsaying something coherent. Remember, Mr. Twofaced, nobody hao; a right to have a letter published, though I have a responsibility to present varying points of view. 
I never promised to print your letter, so don't be offended when it doesn't appear. In the same way I try to respect your opinions, plcao;e respect my editorial decisions. !lope­
fully both of us will exercise a little common sense. 
Sincerely, The Editor 

So send my Hungarian noodles to India 
llow many times have Wl' left food on our 
platt· going to the slop line and heard some 
wisl· nack about waste? The srandard l'ome­
bat·k is, "So Sl'nd my Llungarian Noodle-Bake 
to India." Ikyond this, thl· issue is usually 
droppt:d. We pay li>r our food and do with it as ·Wl' pka.'il'. 
Mark Fredrick 
Guest Editorial 
llowevn, rhe situation is not so simple. Evl·n a quick glanl'l' at tht· slop line reveals a lot of waste. In addition, thl· problem cannot he attributt:d ro a ti:w uncaring individuals. A rn'l'nt survey of the full porrions of food wa.o;ted during onl· day at South Dining Hall brought ro light somt· startling facts. On the sixth· of this month. thl-re were 161 donuts, I :\H sandwi<:hes, an 224 drinks (not counting the IHl) full gla.o;ses of milk) wasted. And the 
numbers get worse: 2.:\7 mash potatol'S, 290 
salads, and 3 19 rolls were all taken, hut not eaten. If these figures are projected for an entire academic year they become more surprisi'lg: I0,464 portions ofeggs, 21,146 of turkey and I06,602 desserts (that is 489 wa.o;ted in one day). This comes out to about 90 gallons of wasted food per day. These figures more than double when the North Dining IIall is considered. 
The waste is not consciously caused either. If we do not like something, or feel too full to finish, we throw food away. More food always is available. In fact, most of us have had more than enough to eat all our lives. We come from the land (>f pknty. But how about everyone else in the world? For starters, the United States has about five per cent of the world's population and consumes around 35 per cent of the food produced. 
There are 600 million malnourished people (the population of the United States is 213 million) in the world. Three hundred thousand hungry mouths are born each day. The fact is, enough food is produced in the world to feed everyone. Still, hunger is a 
gigantic, worldwide problem affecting even 
some areas ofthe United States. 
So, do I send my Hungarian Noodle-Bake to India? In light of these facts, this joking response is no longer enough. Wqat we can do is try to eat more responsibly. For instance, the first time through the serving line, only get what you know you will eat. Ifyou are unsure you'lllike the item, ask for a smaller portion. If you absolutely cannot eat that last donut, take it for a late night snack. If you get something and then do not like it, go ahead and cat it, 
unless you think it will make you sick (this 
measure may seem a bit extreme, but maybe 
you will think twice the next time). The point is take only what you are going to eat. It sounds so simple, and it is simple to get into good habits. 
Many a'>k, "How is my eating responsibly going to help starving people around the world?" Directly, it might not. Indirectly, this simple change in eating habits could have a large effect. Ifall Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students ate more responsibly, everyone would be just ao; full at the day's end though it would take less food to feed them. If all the schools in the U.S. did this, a surplus offood would form. Furthermore, if everyone in the 
U.S. had responsible eating habits, a large amount offood would be left over to feed the starving. 
As wildly theoretical as this sounds, the principle behind it should be considered. We need to start with the individual in order to deal with the problem permanently. In the end, if you think that discarding your food makes no difference, you should consider the implications of everyone adopting this at­titude. 
If, however, you decide you do make a dif­ference (just as your vote makes a difference in an election), then others may follow your example, and world hunger could be further diminished. It is up to you. 
Can we afford to waste food in a world where 114 people die ofstarvation in the time it takes to read this article? If you are in­terested in more information or in getting in­volved, please feel free to contact the World Hunger Coalition.

"Jltc Saint Mary's tennis team defeated the visiting netters of the University of Illinois-Chicago Circle Tuesday afternoon at Angela Ath­letic Facility by a score of 7-2. Im­pressive singles play helped push the Belles' record to 8-4-2. 
In singles play, only two sets ofthe six matches were dropped. This strong and consistent play enabled Saint Mary's to sweep the singles competition 6-0. 
Winning again for the Belles, in the top three spots were Debbie Laueric ( 6-1, 4-6, 6-2 ), Caroline Zern ( 6-I, 6-1 ), and Kristin Beck (6­0, 7-6). 
In doubles play though, the Belles did not fare as well. Only the second doubles team, consisting of Mary Ann Heckman and Allison Pellar, wa.o; able to pull off a victory in their match. 
The next competition for the 
Belles will be this weekend at the 
NAJA Tournament held at Anderson 
College in downstate Indiana. The 
team hopes to successfully defend 
their NAJA state championship. 
The games will be played on con­
secutive Sundays beginning the 
sixth of November. The setup is 
designed to insure that the two top · 
seeded teams will not meet each 
other until the finals ifat all. The final 
is set for November 20, but the loca­
tion has yet to be determined There 
is hope that the game will be played 
in Notre Dame Stadium as it was last 
year. 
The Rockne Division is indicative 
of the close competition in each 
league. Although undefeated 
Howard, runner-up to 1982 cham­
pion Dillon, sits atop the division 
with a 2-0-1 record, both Carroll and 
St. Edward's are within reach of the 
playoffs. St. Ed's controls their own 
destiny as they face lowly Pangborn 
this week before meeting Howard in 
the season finale. 
As in the past, Dillon continues to dominate the Parseghian Division with a 3-0 record. However, the Big Red has faced some tough competi­tion from Flanner this year. Flanner is now 2-1 after losing to Dillon last Sunday by a 3-0 score. Charlie Rice, captain ot the Dillon squad, wasn't mrprised by the close game with

No More 98-Pound Weaklings 
In case you haven't noticed, we've been seeing a dif­ferent Notre Dame football team over the past two weeks. Granted the opposition has not been the greatest, but the team now has that something extra that ha.o; been missing for quite a while. 
No, it's not Steve Beucrlein. The freshman looks great and makes the future look very bright indeed. In fact, he makes the present look pretty good. But, while he may help the offense's consistency, he doesn't play defense, and that is where the improvement has been most noticeable. 
No, what the team has is that spark, that intensity that 
it so badly needed. 
You may remember that, a few weeks ago, the Miami football team pushed Notre Dame all over the field in front of a national audience. The Miami players badly intimidated that Irish that night, taunting them verbally and physically abusing them. The Notre Dame players must have felt like the guy on the beach who had sand kicked in his face. 
Things have changed dramatically since that pitiful Saturday, however. Now it's the Irish who have been kickingsand in the face oftheiropponents. Charlie Atlas would be proud 
It took the Miami players -not exactly your model humans -to get the players to take a critical look at themselves. On the Monday after the game, the team had a meetingwithout the coaches or anybody else. No alumni and no students around to tell them what was wrong. just themselves. 
If they continue to play like they are now, it may 
prove to be the most important team meeting in Notre 
Dame history. After all, the change has been dramatic, 
to say the least. One day, they play like they don't care 
and jeopardize the reputation of Notre Dame football. 
Then, the next day, they play with an intensity that it 
seemed they didn't have. 
What exactly the problem was only the players will ever know. Hopefully, it will never occur again. There are still six more questions on the matter, however. 
It just seems to me that the team wants to win and refuses to let anybody stand in its way. It's about time. When you are bigger, stronger, and more talented than your opponent, and want to abuse them all over the field and on the scoreboard, you will not lose very of­ten. 
Fortunately, it appears that the football team has decided that it is not going to take any more garbage from their opponents. Ifyou let an opponent mouth off to you and get away with it, the opponent will get all the more confide_nL Colorado and South Carolina learned

that Notre Dame players arc not going to let opponents get away with this anymore. 
South Carolina, which ranks just a little ahead of Miami in amount of class on the football team, didn't have a prayer as soon a.o; Notre Dame came out of the locker room like they were shot out of a gun. The players were so pumped up they could have hurt someone. 
Actually, it looks like they tried to. Something like five personal fouls and unsportsmanlike penalties were whistled against the Irish. I would venture to say that it has been a long time since Notre Dame got that many major penalties. It's a good sign. While dirty play is not the Notre Dame way (if there is such a thing), good, hard, physical play is. Ifan opponent is going to shoot offhis mouth, shut him up. 
Probably the best play of the game came on Notre Dame's last scoring drive. Allen Pinkett had gotten a cheap shot on a sweep to the left and some of his teammates had to be restrained from going after the guilty party. Pinkett got his revenge on the next play, though, as he gave the same player a forearm to remem· ber on the same play as before. It really wasn't dirty football, just good intimidation. 
It will be interesting to see how long this intensity lasts. It should last the rest of the sca.o;on, but then everyone had been thinking national championship and that never happened. We'll just have to wait and sec. 
In the meantime, we can have some fun watching tough, hard-fought football games. The players too can have fun like they say they are having. Not only is it fun to show some team spirit and help out your teammates, but it is also fun to win. And it's got to be fun to get everyone off your back. But, then, if you're having fun playing football, you really don't care about all the criticism. 
The team hasn't won back the favor ofall the students 
yet, but, if it plays with the intensity it has shown over 
the last two games, then it won't be long before the 
students start dreaming about great things again. 
But, the only thing that matters is what goes on down on the field. So, in the now immortal words of Gerry Faust, "Let's kick some· ...." · · · · · ·
