Notre Dame enhances fine arts programs 
. John Haynes first director of arts center slated to open in 2004 
By SHEIIA FLYNN 
News Writer 
While Notre Dame is most recognized for academic and athletic prowess, the University is investing time and money to further develop­ment of another aspect of its identity -the fine arts. 
As construction progresses on the 123,000-square-foot, $50 million Marie P. DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts, the University is enlisting high-profile arts figures to promote the arts on campus. 
The arts center is scheduled to open in 2004. 
The first executive director of the Center, John Haynes, took over the job Aug. 1. The former chief executive officer of the California Center for the Arts, Haynes came to Notre Dame with previous perform­ing arts experience. He previ­ously directed The Children's Theatre Company and School in Minneapolis and served on the board of governors and the executive committee of 

Minnesota Citizens for the Arts. 
In May 2002. Haynes also accepted an invitation from the Chinese government to speak at a cultural forum in Nanjing and to advise Beijing officials on plans for a new performing-arts center and school. 
"Most of these are collabora­tive, as opposed to competi­tive, enterprises," Haynes said of his previous positions, "and develop a set of management skills that I think is especially valuable in a University set­ting." 
At Notre Dame, Haynes will be responsible for managing the daily operations of the Center. which will house the University's Department of Film, Television and Theatre in addition to five performance centers: the 900-seat Leighton Concert Hall. underwritten by South Bend civic leader and philanthropist Judd Leighton and his late wife, Mary Lou; the 350-seat Patricia George Decio Drama Theatre, under­written by Notre Dame Trustee Arthur J. Decio in honor of his wife; the 100-seat Regis Philbin Studio Theatre, underwritten by the famed morning-show host and 1953 Notre Dame graduate; a 200­seat cinema theatre; and a 

100-seat organ and chorale University in general. hall. Notre Dame has also estab­
Haynes 's duties will also lished an Advisory Council for include serving as liaison with the Performing Arts. The new other academic departments, council includes well-known local and national arts com­directors Sydney Pollack and munities, managing all non­Martin Scorsese and talk-show academic arts programming hosts Phil Donahue and and promoting the arts at the Philbin. The board will guide the University's future artistic endeavors. 
"What they all bring to Notre Dame is a willingness to help -to offer advice and perspec­tive informed by many years of remarkable success," Haynes

Credit Union replaces Key Bank in Lafortune 

By lAUREN BECK 
News Writer 
A branch of Notre 
Dame Federal Credit 
Union in LaFortune 
Student Center will bet­
ter serve students' needs 
than the Key Bank office 
it replaced, University 
officials said. 
The move happened in early August, but plans for the change began in April. With Key Bank's lease expiring in late July, Notre Dame put the student center base­ment space up for bid and allowed banks to submit proposals. 
The University con­troller's office also dis­tributed a survey via campus e-mail to gauge students' banking needs, said Nancy Majerik, the office's cash manager. 
Officials used the sur­vey to establish selection criteria. 
"It told us the different things students wanted: low fees, good hours, face-to-face banking and ATMs and other services banks offer to con­stituents," said Brian Coughlin. director of Student Activities. 
After evaluating the 
bids, a lease board 
chose NDFCU as the best 
candidate. 
"NDFCU made the best 
offer -they charged no 
fees, had live tellers, 
could staff a full service 
branch and were more 
willing to be open more 
hours than a regular 
bank," Coughlin said. 
The bank's main 
branch is located just 
north of campus at 
19033 Douglas Road. 
Senior Cristina Ceballos said creating an on-campus branch was practical for students. 
"I'm excited because it's more convenient than walking all the way to Douglas," she said. 
Key Bank, however. was disappointed with the change, said spokesman Ken Baierl. 
"We have always pro­vided good service to Notre Dame students, and we thought that because of our long rela­tionship that we would continue to operate in Lafortune," he said. 
Key Bank sent letters to its customers who used the Lafortune office, informing them of the change and inviting 
them to use the bank's 
University Park Mall 
branch. 
Baierl said it was too 
early to tell if students 
would close their 
accounts with Key Bank. 
but some students say 
maintaining their 
accounts with the bank 
would be too inconve­
nient. 
Junior Dave Barrett, a Key Bank member, said he has opened an account with NDFCU and will allow his Key Bank account to lie dor­mant during the school year. 
"I have always main­tained my Key Bank account at school because I can use it at home also," said Barrett, who is from Maine. "I feel cheated because I came hack expecting my bank to be in LaFortune, and now it isn't." 
The new NDFCU office will operate Monday through Wednesday from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Thursday and Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Be a Part ofthe Paper 
The Observer is up and running again and the staff is prepared to tackle the school year. Cranking out a paper five days a week is demanding work and the only way this is pos.sible is with tips, leads, and story ideas 
submitted by stu­dents and staff  . Justan Krlvlckas  
members.  We  
need you.  
The student body  Assistant  
and the University  News Editor  
share a  mutually  
beneficial relation­ 
ship. Students are  

dependent on The Observer for campus news and events. Every day at the dining halls, tables are littered with copies of the paper and everyone on the stafflooks at this seemingly messy and disordered array and smiles, because their work is being appreci­ated. 
Students spend leisure time discussing the key issues they read in the newspaper. The paper's articles help to spawn educated arguments among students and also the fac­ulty. helping to enlighten the entire campus. 
We are glad that most students regularly read the paper. Most of the staff get paid for the jobs we perform and work profesfilonally to give you the best paper we can layout. You don't have to be on The Observer staff to help the paper out. Tips are always more than welcome and we even have a box in our office dedicated to this all-important part of the paper. Without story ideas. 'The Observer would not be the paper it is today. 
You are the sponge and we're here to keep you soaked 
In order for us to keep giving you the material that we, painstakingly it seems sometimes, put together for you every day, we have to ask for something in return. We need everyone to keep their eyes wide open and pay attention to what is happening around them. 
Please don't hesitate to contact The Observer if you have something juicy you can't swallow and need someone to tell. Think of us as a big sister or brother that you have to keep informed. We're attentive listeners and are eager for any help out there to make The Observer the best college newspaper around. 
It isn't that The Observer runs out of material to print. But a broader array of story ideas will help the paper consistently serve the reader filet mignon, a type of story one only finds once every few months. 
Share with the entire campus something the campus normally would never know of. Ifsomething seems Observer-worthy, please e-mail orcall us. You know where to find us, if not in the office, then you probably know one of the staffin a class. 
We toil five days a week in the basement of South Dining Hall and like trolls we work deep into the night. Give the trolls a break and share a charm or two or we'll have to go back to eating people when they pass into our lair.

Alumni scholarship foundation receives funding 
ByCHAREE HOLLOWAY 
Nc:ws Writer 
The Frazier Thompson Scholarship Fund benefited rrom two major contributions during the summer totaling $350,000. 
The fund received a $300,000 grant from the L.G. Balfour Foundation via Fleet National Bank and a $50,000 pledge from Dr. Carl Anderson, a Notre Dame graduate and member of the Black Alumni Association. 

In order to receive the grant from Fleet. the fund must raise an additional $100,000 on its own from other donors by next March, said Mel Tardy. chair­man of the scholarship's com­mittee.

Tardy added that the scholar­ship is needed because students have been known to transfer in their last years of college when they feel overwhelmed by the costs of a Notre Dame educa­tion. 
"Money should never be a reason for someone to leave school," he said. "Right now the scholarships are reserved for students in their final year because that's when they have the most debt." 
The scholarship began in the early 1990s by the Black Alumni Association of Notre Dame to honor Notre Dame's first African-American gradu­ate, Frazier Thompson of the class of 1947. 
The scholarship fund has grown over the years and bene­fits African-American seniors at

Notre Dame. In the past, the fund could only give one or two scholaships a year. Since the fund began to give out scholar­ships in 1998, eight Notre Dame graduates have received scholarships. This year's recip­ients were seniors Daly Barnes, Kyla Davis, Ogochukwu Okoye and Jason Williams. The schol­arships are awarded according to need and academic achieve­ment. 
Although the Frazier scholar­ship remains limited to seniors, Tardy said the fund could grow. 
"Hopefully in the future, through the donations of alum­ni who remember what it was like to struggle financially. we can expand the fund to benefit all years," Tardy said. ..The committee is also looking into ways to use the money to impact recruitment."

Saint Mary's students no longer need quarters to do their laundry. 
Students this fall can begin using their school IDs to pay for the laundry. 
The College formed a com­mittee last spring to look into the issue. The committee included Student Body President Kim Jensen and Vice President Elizabeth Jablonski-Diehl, who found that most students preferred an ID pay system to the coin­operated one. 
..Ever since I was a student at Saint Mary's, this system seemed like a great idea," said Christine Arzt, McCandless Hall director. 
The Coinmach system requires that the student IDs be encoded at the Information Technology office in the basement in LeMans Hall. First-year stu­dents received cards already encoded with the Coinmach feature. 
This summer all four resi­dence halls were equipped machinery for the coinless sys tern. To use the new 

equipment, students must the revamped system. "It only on their cards, but officials transfer money onto their ID took about five seconds." recommend no more $20.

GAZA CITY 
A Palestinian woman, her two sons and a cousin were killed early Thursday when Israeli tank shells exploded in a Bedouin encampment near an Israeli settlement, residents and doctors said. 
Four others were wounded, including the woman's 4-year­old son, said doctors at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. The act­ing director of the hospital, Dr. Nafez Shalach, claimed that Israeli forces prevented ambu­lances from reaching the wounded for more than 40 minutes. 
Israeli military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said suspicious fig­ures approached an army out­post, and tanks fired at them, hitting them. 
The sources said this was late at night in an area forbidden for Palestinian movement, not in a built-up area. 
The shelling came after Palestinian security forces set up checkpoints in the Gaza Strip Wednesday to show they can maintain order as part of a new security agreement. 
It wasn't immediately clear how the deaths would affect the agreement, but Israel had postponed a meeting earlier Wednesday to implement the pact because of fresh violence. Two Palestinians were killed in separate clashes. 

Arriving at the hospital after the shelling Thursday, a rela­tive, Fares Hajien, 30, saw the bodies and broke into tears. "It's a brutal crime," he said. "This is the Israeli step to implement the so-called Gaza plan." 
Israeli tanks moved into Palestinian territory near the settlement of Netzarim, cutting a main road, residents said, as five Israeli gunboats patrolled the shore, where a day earlier, Israeli forces fired at objects in the water, suspected to be packets of smuggled arms. 
The dead were identified as Rawaida Hajien, 50, two of her sons, Ashraf, 23, and Mehad, 
17. and a cousin, Mohammed Hajien, 20. 
The Bedouin are among the Arabs living in Gaza for gener­ations, who were joined by hundreds of thousands of refugees who fled or were dri­ven out of the newly-created state of Israel during a war in 1948-49. All are considered Palestinians.

Senate to hold discussions about Iraq: 
The top Republican on the Senate Armed Services committee said Wednesday he wants Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld to appear before the panel to discuss how prepared U.S. forces are for a war against Iraq. Sen. John Warner of Virginia is the latest GOP lawmaker to insist that Congress be heard in the debate on whether to invade Iraq even as the Bush administration says that congressional autho­rization isn't legally required. "Congress, as a coequal branch of government, is, in my opinion, not going to sit on the sidelines." Warner said in a letter to com mittee chairman Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. The letter was dated Tuesday and released Wednesday. Warner said the time has come for the committee to hold hearings on Iraq after the congressional recess ends next week. He said the first witnesses should be administration officials -preferably Rumsfeld and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Richard Myers. 
Nine year old boy kidnapped: Two gunmen forced their way into a home Wednesday, kidnapped a 9-year-old boy who was the subject of a bitter cus­tody dispute and attacked the boy's father, authorities said.

Investigators were trying to locate the boy's mother, Debra Rose, 38, of Colorado Springs, Colo. She is not a suspect at this time, Riverside County sheriff-elect Bob Doyle said.

Looking 

at Latin cultures 
By MARJA SMITH 
News Writer 
"Looking In, Looking Out," a film series presented by the Institute for Latino Studies and the Kellogg Institute for International Studies, will give students an opportunity to compare and contrast Latino and Latin American perspec­tives. 
The series of films, shown every other week through the next two years starting Sept. 3, will compare Latin American films with films about Latinos who are of Latin American descent but live in the United States, said series organizer Guillermo del Castillo. an engineering gradu­ate student. 
"There are lots of cultural activities on campus, and many students are just not interested," del Castillo said. "I hope people come not just because of classes. There is a lot of cultural insight here you would never get at this univer­sity unless you travel." 
Del Castillo, who is from Mexico City, said he and oth­ers at the Institute worry that trying to address the Latin American perspective on many issues may be naive. While the cultural spectrum of Latin America may be too broad to include in a single film festival, del Castillo said he has tried to include a diverse selection of films from Mexico, Columbia, Cuba. and many other nations. 
"We have tried to cover many cultures," del Castillo said. 
Through comparing films created by Latin Americans and U.S. Latinos, the Institute hopes to provide insight on some important issues from both points of view. The films will address topics such as life in the metropolis, migration and exile and church and reli­gion. 
In addition to the films, del Castillo said each viewing would include a short session to discuss the issue, with spe· cialists on the various topics to lead the discussions. 
Movie topics will range from "Romero" to Disney's .. The Three Caballeros." 
While the films address Latin American and Latino topics, del Castillo said the fes­tival is intended not just for people of Latin American descent, but anyone who takes an interest in foreign cultures or film. Viewers will not need special knowledge of Spanish or of Latin American cultures to appreciate the themes. For many students. this may be a unique opportunity to gain new perspectives and see many acclaimed American and foreign films. he said. 
The first film, "'Novia que te vea," will be shown next Tuesday at 7 p.m. in Hesburgh Center for International Studies auditorium. The film tells the story of two Jewish girls growing up in Mexico City. Admission is free.

IN BRIEF 
Market faces lows for second day 
A hodgepodge of bad news on Wall Street prompted investors to collect profits again Wednesday, sending prices sharply lower for a second straight day. 
Analysts said the news ranging from job cuts at Nortel Networks to a downbeat bro­kerage report on Sun Microsystems con­tributed to the sell off that has followed gains for the last five weeks. Light pre-holiday trad­ing exacerbated the price swings. 
"More or less you're looking at a situation where stocks are in for a pause and investors are responding to a more negative tint on the tape,"said Jack Caffrey. vice president and equity strategist for JP Morgan Private Bank. 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 130.32, or 1.5 percent, at 8,694.09, after dropping 1.1 percent Tuesday. 
The broader market also finished lower. The Nasdaq composite index declined 33.40, or 2.5 percent, to 1,314.38, having fallen 3.2 percent Tuesday, the worst one-day drop in three weeks. 

Napster in search of buyer 
Bankrupt Napster Inc. on Thursday plans to seek a Delaware court's approval of its pro­posed sale to Bertelsmann AG, which hopes to revive the silenced Internet music-sharing ser­vice. 
No other bidders emerged for Redwood City­based Napster after German-based Bertelsmann forced the company into bank­ruptcy in June. Bertelsmann values its bid for Napster at about $100 million, including debts that will be waived as part ofthe deal. 
Bertelsmann's bid still faces a potential obsta­cle. The Music Publishers Association and the Recording Industry Association of America ­two powerful trade groups that have fought Napster for years -have objected to the sale. Before federal courts ruled Napster's online file-swapping service violated copyright laws. the service had attracted 60 million users and revolutionized the way people obtained music.

Baseball advertisers step away 
Associated Press 
Baseball's biggest corporate advertisers should be able to take a strike this fall without worrying about falling behind in the count financially, thanks to special pro­tection clauses in their contracts. 
But a lengthy work stoppage by major-league players especially one that wipes out the World Series could prompt many companies to do their pitching elsewhere in future seasons, marketing experts say. 
Goodbye, national pastime. Hello, golf, NASCAR and extreme sports. "Let's face it, the sports market 
has a lot of choices besides base­ball," says Paul Swangard, manag­ing director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon. 
"There's concern among adver­tisers that fans are growing increasingly bitter about the possi­bility of sitting through a ninth one of these things since the early 1970s." Swangard said. "And that baseball seems to be the one sport that can't get it right." 
Major League Baseball itself would be the big loser if marketers are le ft without ballgames for hawking their snacks, beer and anti-impotence drugs. 
Strike clauses written into the contracts of its corporate partners baseball's biggest advertisers, who collectively are paying it $170 mil­lion this year could cost the league tens of millions of dollars in repay­ments for lost games and market­ing opportunities. 
But that's only the opening inning, financially. American icon or no, experts say companies will look more harshly at spending marketing money on baseball if the sport becomes a no-no of the busi­ness world: a tarnished brand. 
Baseball already has lost ground to auto racing, wrestling and other sports since the last strike in 1994.

Saint Mary's has created a phone system with improved security and other conve­niences for students. 
The new system gives stu­dents the option of using caller ID and call waiting. The caller ID service will only be accessible for students with the function built into their phones. 
School officials scrapped the old system in favor of the modern technologies. but stu­dents say some of the features are hard to set up or use.

I have a good friend from Wyoming, and our friends always teased her about her state's sparse population and lack of diversions. I always felt bad for her, and in truth, I felt a certain softness toward Wyoming. It seemed like such a nice state. 
Until I actually went there. I drove Marlayna out to school this year from my home­
Soenneker 
town of St. Helens, Ore. My friend Matt and I drove for six days and 2,800 miles. One of our stops was Here We Go Yellowstone National Park, the reason Again for our stay in Wyoming. Yellowstone was gorgeous, despite the lack of excitement exhibited by visiting 8-year-olds. 
We saw Old Faithful do the geyser thing, which was gen­erally spectacular. In the midst of all the oohs and ahhs following the seismic wonder's performance, we clearly heard a small child whine, "Is that it?" We heard this refrain once again when we visited the lower falls of the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. What, we wondered, do these kids want? Free marshmallows? Fireworks? Japanese anime characters? 
Anyway, while Yellowstone was all we ever dreamed (not being 8-year-olds), the rest of the state of Wyoming was a barren wasteland. To be fair to the state, we didn't see much of it, just the northwest corner -which I think was probably enough to convince both of us never to visit again. 
We didn't leave Yellowstone until nine at night, wanting to milk every second of daylight out of the place. We were staying in Powell, Wyoming that night, which is northeast of Cody, Powell's better-known and more expensive neigh­bor. 
Our first problem came about 30 miles outside Cody, when I looked at the map and realized that there are two Highway 14s in Wyo., both of which go through Cody. One of these highways goes to Powell. The other does not. While Matt and I were definitely on a Highway 14, we were not on the correct Highway 14. 
What I want to know is what kind of state has two Highway 14s? Why not choose another number? It's hardly like there are so many highways running through Wyoming that they used up all the numbers. Are they unaware that numbers go on infinitely? 
We had identified the problem at this point, but there wasn't a whole lot of opportunity to do something about it. Most roads have an exit every one or two or even five miles. Not in Wyoming. By the time we figured out we were on the wrong road, we had gone 15 miles past the last exit, and we had about 20 more to go before we could find another exit. 
In the meantime, our detour cost a squirrel his little life. In our defense, the squirrel was suicidal, drunk or perhaps both. Matt was driving and did his best to swerve around the squirrel, but the squirrel was just too quick for him. Our furry friend corrected for Matt's swerve and sacrificed his life on the altar of Goodyear. 
We also had an encounter of the flattening kind with a field mouse later on, when we got onto the road that actu­ally took us to the correct 14. As we saw no one during the entire 20-mile drive on this road, we concluded that the reason we had problems with wildlife so determined to become roadkill was that they had never seen a car at night before .. Or perhaps they had never seen a car at all before. 
We finally arrived at Powell at midnight. We rolled into our motel in this 3,000-person metropolis and inquired as to whether there were any food establishments open this late. We were informed that there was in fact a 24-hour Thriftway just down the street. Thriftway is not really my favorite food restaurant as it reminds me strongly of a gro­cery store, but you make do when you are hungry. 
Upon our arrival at the Thriftway some two minutes later, we realized that not only was Thriftway the local 24­hour joint, it was also the local hot spot for the happening youth of Powell. 
Having grown up in a small rural town ourselves, Matt and I recognized that the flock of teenagers standing around the parking lot were not going anywhere else. Nor were they there to buy anything. We knew that they were actually there to be in the parking lot of Thiftway. Thriftway, in Powell, is an end in and of itself, and an actu­al goal and destination for night life. 
We bought ourselves some fried chicken that, as Matt said, tasted as though it had been basted in sweat. The next morning we left Wyoming as fast as we possibly could, which, because we were going over the Bighorn mountains in my Saturn, was about 40 mph if I floored it in third gear.

Among college controversies this sum­mer, it seems required reading assign­ments have been all the rage. 
First, incoming freshmen at the Univerisity of North Carolina-Chapel Hill were assigned a commentary on the Koran which presented Islam in a very favorable light. Now, everyone should agree that it is very worthwhile to gain a better understanding of that ancient and venerable faith, especially today. 
Critics argued, however, that such sym­pathetic presentation of Catholicism (for instance) would never be offered, much less required, at any similar public insti­tution. They claimed that this assignment violated the principle of the separation of church and state. They are probably right on the first claim, but I am not sure about· the latter. 
Next, it appears students at the University of Maryland are being forced to read a play about the life and death (and strange, politicized afterlife) of Matthew Shephard, the gay Wyoming stu­dent who may have made a pass at some straight men and was then taken out into the country and beaten to death. What they did to him, of course, was awful, but the moral of the play is not "avoid making passes at straight guys." Rather, it is that the lack of hate-crime laws, along with shameful religious bigotry, was somehow responsible for his death. Thus, an aggressive effort to criminalize the kinds of beliefs that motivated his murderers will prevent future instances of violence against gay men who try to pick up het­erosexuals -or so the theory goes. 

This is not to say that the case of Matthew Shephard is not instructive in any way. It is instructive in showing the biases of our own media. The same week­end that Matthew Shephard died, a young boy was kidnapped in Arkansas by two gay men and over the course of that weekend was tortured and almost contin­uously sodomized, then finally strangled to death after a few days of pure, unimaginable hell. I did not even hear of this crime until just last year, and even then it was just a passing allusion in some commentary about violence against chil­dren. I do not know the name of that boy, which is perhaps just as well. 
HBO will never screen a movie about him, neither will enlightened universities ever make their students learn about what happened to him. Getting sodom­ized and then killed is no big deal; not getting sodomized and getting killed makes one a hero and a martyr. 
A survey some years back showed that over 90 percent of major media profes­sionals voted for Bill Clinton in the 1996 election. A much more recent survey of a representative sample of middle to upper level American colleges showed that a similar percentage of professors in humanities and social science depart­ments describe themselves as politically liberal. To believe even for an instant that these numbers do not make their way into the news we see and hear and the instruction students receive would be beyond foolish. 
To believe Notre Dame is very much different would likewise be foolish. I per­sonally believe the Faculty Senate would gladly vote to replace the Basilica with a Buddhist pagoda and replace Mary atop the Dome with Gloria Steinam. Many of you will graduate with a long list of instances of professors pushing their moral and political agendas in class. But cheer up, it could be worse. 
You could be at Maryland.

GUEST COLUMNS Challenge yourself by avoiding shortcuts 
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. 
We are all in college to get educated, yet many of us tend to forget that. Some of you believe that college is a means to an end. It's all Wayne Ma about get­ting a piece of The Daily paper cer­Illini tifying that you're qualified to earn big bucks. Some of you are here because it's just the natural order of things. You're expected to go to college once you graduate high school. 
However, I'm sure many of you returning are hell. Last year, after my first midterm, I decided I could skip my astronomy lectures and just read the textbook. Since my history class gave detailed study guides, I didn't need to do any of the assigned readings as long as I crammed for the exams a few nights before. No one collected my chemistry homework, so what was the point of doing it? And who needs to keep up with the weekly reading in political sci­ence when the only two term papers due all semester don't require any references? 

Once again. I compromised myself and my education. After high school I said, "Now I can 
finally just relax and learn to keep a B, then why study? 
And if your essay was complete 
bull but you got an A, who 
cares? 
How many of us are diligent enough to take the other route? To always sacrifice our points and our free time to actually do some solid learning? Sadly, today it's not what you know but what you can show. 
What company or university will take the time to interview each applicant when it can just screen them by qualifications and scores? It's not about who's the most qualified as much as who has achieved what and where it was achieved. 
With pressure coming from all sides and a competitive job market, it's not easy to disre­gard grades and be a total ide­alist. The goal is to strike a deli­cate balance. The system is the way it is and you can't help but play by its rules if you want to win. Still, you are the master of your education, and the more you put into it, the more you will get out. Many of us tend to stop when we've reached the boundaries and standards that have been set for us. We never wish to know more than we need to. 
All of us want success, but many of us have lost sight of the fact that the process is more important than the end result. Although it's not easy to stay away from academic shortcuts, education must be a challenge.

Judiciary· checks reckless administration 
COLUMBUS, Ohio 
It is a testament to the strength ofour judicial process that an appeals court has stepped up to check the overzealous actions of the executive branch.  
In a ruling immediately chastised by the U.S. Justice Department, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals determined earlier this week the 
Bush administration violated the Constitution  
by holding secret immigration hearings about  Staff Editorial  
suspects with possible connections to the Sept.  
11 attacks.  
We commend the court's fortitude and chal­lenge our government, and in particular the  The Lantern  
attorney general. to desist in its appeals and  
begin acting in accordance with the tenants of a  

more democratic society. In the last year the United States govern­
ment has embarked on a path of secrecy unprecedented in recent 
years. The atmosphere of terror induced public officials to abandon 
this country's culture of openness and opt for secrecy as a way of 
ensuring safety and security. 
Thus far, however, no one has demonstrated that an ignorant soci­ety is a safe society. While some information logically should be with­held because it could pose a direct threat to American ground forces or tip off a terrorist that he is under surveillance, citizens are better able to protect themselves and take action when they know the dan­gers they are facing. 
In this case, the government's argument -that Attorney General John Ashcroft may declare certain cases to be "special interest" ones that can be conducted in secret -is problematic on several levels. 
Foremost. it is the beginning of a slippery slope in which the gov­ernment could argue any number of cases (including criminal pro­ceedings) be held in secret without adhering to any established guidelines or procedures. 
It is essential in times of conflict and crisis that we hold tightly to the fundamental features that have helped our country endure for these last 200 years.

For those who happened to spend most of the summer in the Alaskan wilderness, serving their country in Afghanistan, or hibernating: George 
Lucas' "Star Wars Episode 11: Attack of the Clones" hit theatres in mid-May. 
Set ten years after "Episode I," "Clones" features the multiple plotlines that are characteristic of all the "Star Wars" films. The bold and beautiful Queen Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) is now a Republican Senator in the crosshairs of a mysterious bounty hunter (Temuera Morrison). Sent in to guard her safety are Jedi 
By MAIT KOHLEY Scene Movie Critic 
With the release of his third supernatural thriller, "Signs," director M. Night Shyamalan has once again led audiences into a world of unfamiliarity, suspense and things 
upon sparks, whether they be from lightsaber fights in the rain or amorous liaisons, begin to fly. 
Though "Clones" could be criticized as having pedestrian dialogue and acting at best, and primi­tive at worst, the catalyst of the "Star Wars" films has always been imagination, brought to life by spe­cial effects and storyline. 

"Star Wars Episode 11: Attack of the Clones" 

Director: George Lucas Starring: Ewan McGregort Natalie , Portman, Hayden Christensen 
Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his Jedi-in-training. the very adolescent Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). 
The web of intrigue surrounding the assassination attempts on Amidala prompts Master Jedi Yoda (Frank Oz) and Jedi-not-surviving-Episode III Mace Windu to dispatch the trusty Kenobi in pursuit of the bounty hunter while giving Anakin his first real Jedi assignment as bodyguard of Amidala, where-

his own inner­

impact of the crop circles and invasion on a Pennsylvania farmer and his family. At the heart of the story is Graham Hess (Mel Gibson). a devoted father and ex-minister who has lost his faith after the gruesome death of his wife. Together with his broth­er (Joaquin Phoenix) and 
"The Sixth Starring: Mel Gibson Sense," his newest cre­ative vision lacks the originality and intensity of his earlier films. Reminiscent of a 1950's sci-fi classic, "Signs" depicts a hostile invasion of alien life forms from a distant planet after the emer­gence of mysterious crop circles throughout the world. Instead of focusing on the international implications of a world invasion, Shyamalan chooses to explore the 
demons as he 
struggles to 

regain his faith. 
The strength of "Signs" clearly lies its performances. Mel Gibson provides the perfect mix of confu­sion, fear, self-loathing, frustra­tion and fatherly endearment. Both Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, who play Gibson's two children, perhaps give the best performances of the movie. 
In every other aspect, however, 
The best of Lucas' films have staked their claim for greatness on those grounds and "Clones" is no exception. What sets this movie apart is the further reve­lation of Lucas' epic series as a sober social commentary, never more pertinent than in this pre­sent time and place, when larg­er government, human cloning and an expanding military empire are met with the approval of not just moviegoers. 
but with American society. Accompanied by the usual breathtaking visual effects, heart-stopping sound design and frenetic, if sometimes implausible. pace, "Clones" is a worthy film not just in the "Star Wars" series, but in its own right.

"Signs" falls drastically short. barely achieving mediocrity. During the first half of "Signs" Shyamalan creates a tense, sus­penseful atmosphere. Similar to an Alfred Hitchcock film, Shyamalan keeps the audience on the edges of their seats not by what he shows, but by· what he chooses not to show. By the end of the film, however, Shyamalan reveals entirely too much and ruins the suspense that he builds so wonderfully throughout the story. 
Moreover, the ending of ··signs" feels hollow, superficial and uno riginal. The conflicts developed throughout the film resolve much too neatly. As a whole the film leaves the audience feeling very unsatisfied and slightly cheated. If you're itching for a great, sus­penseful film, do yourself a favor and rent "The Sixth Sense" instead.

During the eclectic summer of 2002 that featured everything from "Road to Perdition" to "XXX" to "The Powerpuff Girls Movie," "Insomnia" may have been the pick of the lit­ter. The story focuses on Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and his partner Hap 
Eckhart (Martin Donovan). two high-profile LAPD homicide detectives that fly to a remote Alaskan fishing village to investigate the murder of a teenage. Meeting them at the float plane dock is Detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank). a small-town cop who has stud­ied and idolized Dormer's work.

and Eckhart are revealed to have been under the bright lights of the Los Angeles media juggernaut before escaping to Alaska and the reason for their publicity becomes a catalyst in the murder investigation, especially when this knowledge filters through to the prime suspect, Walter Finch (Robin Williams). Directed by Christopher Nolan, who amazed and intrigued audiences with "Memento" in 2000, "Insomnia" might have been tagged a thriller or crime drama, but is a rich enough film to defy any genre stereotyping.

Lane delivers an outstanding performance and Gere's limited range in this film turns out to be his strength. The screenplay is well written with symbolism throughout the film and an unexpected twist half way through. 
"Unfaithful," however. is most memorable for its audile and visual beauty. The scenes are chosen and filmed delib­
erately, capturing the indentations on drinking glasses or an escaped lock of hair. The original score, com­posed by Jan Kaczmareks, creates a subtle background. Two wonderful musical additions to the film are "Ai Du," a bluesy piece off the award­winning album Talking Timbuktu, and "Dedicace Outo" and "Devorzhum" by Dead Can Dance that adds an ethereal feel to scenes.

Haas outlasts opponent, advances to next round 
Associated Press

The match stretched 3 hours, 23 minutes, and Haas had to overcome a sudden rash of dou­ble faults at the end to prevail. 
Earlier, former champion Pete Sampras had an easy victory while Wimbledon finalist David Nalbandian was an upset loser. 
Haas seemed headed for the exit, struggling mightily against Sanchez. Haas won a first-set tiebreak but dropped the next two before he came back for the victory. Even at the end, it was not easy. He double-faulted on two match points after having just five double faults in the

It was a long and difficult match for Haas, already strug­gling with tendinitis in his right arm and shoulder. When he showed up for the match wear­ing a sleeveless shirt, he was ordered to change into more tra­ditional tennis garb. 
Sampras, a four-time winner of this event but seeded at No. 17 and still seeking his first tourna­ment championship in 25 months, posted a 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 victory over Albert Portas. 
Sampras, who has not won a tournament since taking his record 13th Grand Slam at Wimbledon 2000, boomed serves at up to 131 mph and was never troubled by the Spanish clay­court specialist in his first match of this year's Open. 
It was a promising start for Sampras, runner-up at this tour­nament each of the last two years and convinced that he still has at least one more major vic­tory left in him. 
"It felt really good," Sampras said. "I felt like I played really well. I have no complaints with the way it went. It's been a struggle this year. I've lost some confidence. But this is the U.S. Open." 
Paradorn Srichaphan won 6-1, 6-3, 6-0 over Prakash Amritraj.

Lasorda ouraged at IOC proposal 
. Committe wants to rid Olympics of baseball, softball 
Associated Press 
I.AUSANNE, Switzerland 
As major league baseball play­ers and owners worked to pre­vent a strike, the sport endured a setback on the international stage Wednesday, as an IOC panel recommended dropping baseball from the Summer Olympics. 
The panel also proposed get­ting rid of softball, another game the United States excels at, while

baseball team to 
the gold medal at the 2000

this. The baseball park was full 
for all the games we played in 
Sydney. 
"Also, the softball I saw at the 
Olympics was an awesome com­
petition and the crowds were 
great. It's just a tremendous mis­
take if they drop these sports." 
The U.S. softball team also 
won in Sydney, defending the 
gold medal it won in Atlanta. 
The International Olympic Committee's program commis­sion made the recommendations in a report delivered to the IOC executive board, according to Olympic officials familiar with the docwnent. 
The executive board is expect­ed to finish reviewing the recom­mendations on Thursday. If the board accepts the proposals, they would go to the full IOC assembly. A two-thirds majority is required for approval, which could come at the next IOC ses­

Baseball, a former demonstra­tion sport, became a full medal event at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. However,

Olympic baseball has failed to include top major league players, since the season overlaps with the games. 
Softball was added to the Olympics in Atlanta, but its long­term status has always been in doubt. The international softball federation is headed by an American, Don Porter. 
Ralph Raymond, coach of the 1996 and 2000 U.S. Olympic softball teams, said the sport is still gaining popularity world­wide. 
"I think that it would be a cry­ing shame at this point, since it's been in now for two Olympics and has proven to be a crowd pleaser," Raymond said. 
Golf and rugby have been among more than two dozen sports lobbying to become Olympic sports. 
Golf, which was in the Olympics in 1900 and 1904, was proposed for inclusion in the Atlanta Games but was blocked because of controversy over the membership policy of the Augusta National club, which has no women members. 
The addition of golf would raise the prospect of Tiger Woods playing for a gold medal in 2008 in China.

NEW YORK 
One day before the union's strike deadline, baseball players and own­ers were still trying to work out their differences and get on with the rest of the season. 
After five bargaining ses­sions Wednesday, the sides remained apart on levels for a luxury tax and rev­enue sharing, leaving the sport on track for its ninth work stoppage since 1972. Many players. however, expressed hope for a deal. 
"The same issues are unresolved,., said commis­sioner Bud Selig, who arrived in New York on Wednesday evening. "It's been very constructive. Both sides are reaching out, but I can't tell you we're any closer. Only time will tell." 
Selig, who presided over the 1994-95 strike that led to the first cancellation of the World Series in 90 years, did not participate in the negotiating sessions, which mostly were brief. The last talks ended just past midnight and were to resume Thursday. 
"The length of the meet­ing doesn't always indicate whether it was a good meeting or not," said union lawyer Steve Fehr, the brother of union head Donald Fehr. 
Selig appeared briefly at the fourth meeting, only to say hello, union lawyer Michael Weiner said. 
"I still think we're going to get something done," said Atlanta pitcher Tom Glavine, the NL player rep­resentative. "I just think we're all too close on too much of this to let it fall apart." 
Owners want to slow spending by high-payroll teams with a luxury tax and in their last formal proposal wanted to increase the amount of locally generated revenue that teams share from 20 percent to 36 per­cent. Players were at 33.3 percent and want to phase in the increase. 
While negotiators didn't disclose details, manage­ment increased its proposed threshold for the luxury tax by $5 million to $112 mil­lion and the union dropped by $5 million to $120 mil­lion, Boston player repre­sentative Johnny Damon said. The sides were still discussing all the proposed rates and thresholds, and the union didn't want a tax in the final year. 
The sides also discussed contract language that dealt with the owners' desire to fold two franchises, one general manager said on condition of anonymity. The union opposes contraction.

SOCCER 


By KATIE McVOY Associate Sports Editor 
As another season begins for the Belles, a team that has undergone innumerable coaching and playing changes will have to begin all over one more time. For the third time in the past four years, Saint Mary's will be under the direction of a new coach. this time Chris Pfau. 
For the Belles, it's back to basics. 
"I want to continue to build a foundation at Saint Mary's College with the young talent and concen­trate more on teaching the individual how to play the game," Pfau told the Saint Mary's athletic department earlier this year. "My goal is to make each player better in their four years at Saint Mary's." 
Pfau inherits a team that made major improvements last season under the direc­tion of former coach Bobby Johnston. Halfway through the season, a team that had won only three games the previous year captured its first win, which sent it on a three game win streak ­it's longest in years. 
But a full-time Division II coaching position lured Johnston away from the Belles. Saturday, as they face off against Hartwick College in New York, Pfau will be at the helm. 
The trip to New York marks a major milestone for the Belles -an overnight road trip for non-conference play. During their spring training, the Belles spent almost as much time fundraising for the trip as they did improving their soccer skills. They leave today. 
Returning to the field is lone senior Lynn Taylor, one of last year's junior captains and the only Belles player with three years of game experience.

Volleyball 
Belles coach Julie Schroeder-Biek returns for her seventh season as the Belles' coach. The Belles will be looking to recover from a tough 2001 season where they earned only three wins. 
Saint Mary's doesn't return any players with more than two years of playing experience and they have only one senior. Elizabeth Albert. The Belles will feel the loss of Angela Myers, who was sidelined by an injury halfway through last sea­son and graduated last spring. They will also miss Jolie LeBeau, who graduated last spring. 
The Belles open play this week­end at the Alma Tournament. Alma finished the season in first place in the MIAA with 11 conference victo­ries and only three losses. It's a dis­tinct difference from a Belles team that only won one conference game and lost 13 games.

The talk about the new pro-style offense has been endless. Ever since Tyrone Willingham was hired in January, the discussions about how effective an Irish passing game will be, who will be taking the snaps and which receivers will be handling the ball have raged. 
But on Saturday, it's go time. 
At the beginning of spring practice, receivers coach Trent Miles focused on introducing his receivers to the new sys­tem. The idea was to get them used to the new offense and make them feel comfortable with their new role on the Irish team. 
Now, the goal is much simpler. 
"Win," Miles said. " ... Win every play, one play at a time and then win the first game. [Those] are our objectives right now. And then we go to win the next game, one play at a time, one game at a time." 
But the question remains: Can the wide receivers do what their coach expects? 

Coming from a run-heavy offense, the Irish had enough hurdles to overcome. But. in addition, the Irish lost last year's leading receivers Javin Hunter and David Givens to graduation. Meanwhile, Arnaz Battle, Carlos Campbell and Omar Jenkins, slated to be the top Irish receivers this year, have only two career touchdowns and 13 career receptions between them. Those are unconvincing lot for the receivers to learn. Spring said.
