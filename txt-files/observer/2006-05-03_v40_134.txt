Jenkins responds, leaves CLAP unsatisfied 
Members continue to fight for living wage 
By JOE PIARULLI 
News Writer 
At 10 a.m. Tuesday, approxi­mately a dozen members of the Campus Labor Action Project made their way to University President Father John Jenkins's office in the Main Building ­where several stayed until 5 
p.m. -to present petitions signed by more than 1,300 sup­porters requesting a task force be formed to evaluate the University's wage policies. 
But the group's demands for change were met by a response from Jenkins affirming Notre Dame's current practices ­noting that University adminis­trators have met with CLAP members five times already this year. 
"For the most part, these have been amicable, productive meetings," Jenkins said in the statement. 
Executive Vice President John Affleck-Graves and Associate Vice President for Human Resources Robert McQuade have been "entrusted responsi­bility for this issue," Jenkins said. "I am confident of their skill, their good faith and their concern for the well being of our employees and the universi­ty as a whole."

Dean Woo dines vvith Bush, Chinese president 
By MEGHAN WONS News Writer 
Carolyn Woo, dean of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business since 1997, dined with world leaders last Thursday at a luncheon party in the White House -hosted by President George W Bush and Mrs. Bush in honor of Chinese President Hu Jintao's first official visit to the United States. 
Woo said she was one of approximately 180 guests, and estimated that 40 of those in attendance were Asian Americans. According to the Mendoza College of Business's Web site, Dean Woo has an incredible breadth and depth of experience as a leader in the business world and has been honored by various organizations for her achieve­ments. 

But regard­less of that achievement, she was sur­prised to be included in the event,


which she Carolyn Woo attended with her husband Dave. "We did not know why we were invited, but went out of

Grab and Go changes 

By MEGHANWONS News Writer 
Beginning fall of 2006, Notre Dame students may have more food options to consider when making their Grab and Go selec­tions. 
According to the Notre Dame Food Services Web site, Grab and Go was designed for students who don't have time to sit down for a meal. With locations in both the basement of South Dining Hall and the north entrance lobby of North Dining Hall, Grab and Go current­ly offers a limited variety of prepackaged and portable foods such as sandwiches, veggie trays, bagels, drinks, chips, yogurt, cere­

curiosity and the desire for an experience," Woo said. 
Woo has also been a member of the Committee of 100 -an organization of Chinese­American leaders devoted to enhancing relations between the United States and China and the full participation of Chinese­Americans in American life ­since 2001. 
Woo said her acquaintance and retired General John Fugh -the highest ranking Chinese­American General when he was in office -made her and her husband feel comfortable in the White House from the moment they arrived. Fugh is also the incoming chair of the Committee of100. 
"General Fugh and I were the only representatives invited from the Committee of 100," Woo said. "He knew everyone, made sure that I was properly introduced and kept taking pictures of me in front of different presidential portraits." · 
The luncheon started at 11:30 
a.m. and was held in various rooms in the East Wing of the White House. 
"My favorite room was the yel­low room -the sitting room for the Ladies' bathroom and where portraits of the First Ladies were hung," Woo said.

SMC update gives optimistic analysis 
Budget, identity, building addressed 
By LAURA BAUMGARTNER 
News Writer 
The Saint Mary's communi­ty experienced a resurgence of optimism Tuesday follow­ing three sessions of joint presentations, which provid­ed updates on the College's budget, identity initiative and new academic building. 
Vice President of Finance Laurie Stickelmaier began each of the presentations with a somber recollection of past years' budget projec­tions. 
"When we had the September 2004 budget con­versation, things were not in real good shape," she said. 
Stickelmaier said at that time the College had finished the last two years with deficits -a trend that was projected to continue into the near future. 

"We had projected, at that time, deficits for the years to come reaching from two to three million dollars," she said. 
In order to deal with ­and possibly reverse -this downward trend, Stickelmaier said the College considered many areas where budget cuts could be made. 
Almost two years later ­after a $4 million transfer of Plant Fund Reserves to an quasi-endowment fund, reductions of non-salary expenditures, a decrease in costs of employee benefits, reductions in employee posi­tions through attrition, retirement and restructur­ing, and leaving vacant posi­tions open for longer periods of time -Stickelmaier said

ND tnay help fund museutn 
D.C. Catholic cultural center fights deficit 
By MARY KATE MALONE 
News Editor 
The University is examining the possibility of helping a struggling Catholic museum in Washington, D.C. University spokesman Dennis Brown said Tuesday. 
Brown emphasized that com­munication between officials from the John Paul II Cultural Center -which is facing a $40 million deficit -and the University is "very prelimi­nary." 
"We're in the analysis process of taking a look at what role we might play on a num­ber of levels, if any," Brown said. "Is this something that would be in our or the Center's best interest? That's why it's important for us to do due dili­gence." 
Backed by Detroit Cardinal Adam Maida, the Cultural Center opened in March 2001 and sits on 12 acres. The muse­um houses art from the Vatican and a research center but, according to a May 2 article in the Detroit Free Press, has struggled to attract visitors. 
Brown said the Center con­tacted the University earlier this year about what role it might play in the Center's future. 
The dialogue between the University and the Cultural Center was reported in the May 2 Detroit Free Press article.

INSIDE COLUMN 

The Churchill Down Low 
It's that time ofyear again, the time 
when all inside columns begin with that 
same trite truism, a'i we all prepare to 
have our critieal capadties tested. 
By thn nnd of this wnek, after tirelessly 
studying liJr every 
possible angle, we Tim Dougherty 
invariably ask our­
selves, is all the 
money wn spend Sports Writer 
worth it. Tuition? 
llellno. Gambling. 
The 132nd Kentucky Derby is 
Saturday and the only book these eyes 
are going to see is my bookie. So whether 
you're racing down to Louisville or plac­
ing oll'-track bets, I humbly oll'er to you 
some words of advice from a perennial 
Derby dilettante. (NOT a connoisseur­
that's just another word for an addict.) 
First things first, ignore the animal­
rwigh, athlete-who's picked first. The 
favorite never wins-that is unless he's 
the underdog. Since 1979, only two race­
day favorites have won, Smarty Jones 
(2004) and Fusaiehi Pega'ius (2001); one 
almost died a<; a liJal and the other wa<> 
Japanese. 
lnstnad li>eus on horses two through 
four and get yourself a racing book that 
contains all the horses' pa<>t perliJrmanc­
es-place, distance, track condition, 
and spend rating. Pay attention to speed 
ratings (it is the (;realest Two Minutes in 
SporL'i), which give a good indication of 
the horse's top ability as it faces the 
toughest competition in the world (e.g. 
Kentucky, where they take !-,rmater e(l'ort 
to brned thnir horsns than they do their 
people.). 
Onn~ you've narrowed it down to a few eontnnders. here comes the most impor­t.ant part (you girls will like it, well that and tho haL'i): pick tlw one with thn best name. Seriously. Some lind that a bit unsdentilk, but think about it, when a bn~(~dnr thinks he ha'i a !-,rrnat horse, he's going to honor it with a damn-tine name -one that rolls oil' the front of the tongue like a mint julep down the back of it. 
Since 1990, the champion at tradition­steep(l)ed Churchill Downs ha'i had a name like Unbridled, Silver Charm, Charismatic, War Emblem. Throw in earlier Triple Crown victors like Secretariat and Citation and c'mon, pick the most awe-inspiring name-it behooves you. 
Now comes the most essential part, betting. Don't bet to win, place or show; it's safe, spineless, and stupid if you want to make money. The combo bets are exacta-lly what you want. Pick the exac­ta (top two in order). Or try the trifecta (top three in order) and if you're watch­ing the race on 'IV with your ticket in one hand and a sandwich in the other, you're only a lilly away from trifection. Or, ironically, you can box your horses to open up your chances, so that with an exaeta-box (quinella) or a tri-box your horses can finish in those positions in any order. 
The secret of boxes is the key. A tri­key, whieh I strongly recommend, makes you pick the winnnr and then choose throe other horses to finish second and third in any order. So you get one extra pick and it pays off between the value of a trililcta and a tri-box. I don't want to brag or anything (that's a bald-faced lie), but I made $.'550 on a $2 bet this way in the 2004 D(lrby taking Smarty Jones on top (that means to win) with lion Heart (fmished second), Imperialism (finished third) and Iimehouse (did not finish in the money). (Note that Lion lleart and Imperialism aren't exactly summer camp horseback riding names.) 
II' all else fails, gnt buddins to throw in live grand each (like 2003 champ Funny Cide's owners) and buy a Derby winner yourself'. Anything to horse around belilre finals.

Lieber predicts U.S. will return to primacy 
By BECKY HOGAN 
News Writer 
With one sentence, a Notre Dame professor has made some very big waves. 
"The United States is on the verge of escaping a MAD [Mutual Assured Destruction I world," assistant professor of political sci­ence Keir Lieber said in a recent article, entitled "The Rise of U.S. Nuclear Primacy." 
From Web logs to statements from Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, the comment elicited huge responses from the international community -most notably from Russia. 
Lieber, together with University of Pennsylvania professor Daryl Press, wrote the article, which appeared in the March/April2006 edition of Foreign Affairs Magazine. 
"We did anticipate controversy [from the article], but we did not anticipate the nature of the response," Lieber said. 
Lieber and Press' chief claim was that the United States "stands on the verge of attaining nuclear primacy" and that it may be pos­sible "for the United states to destroy long-range nuclear arse­nals of Russia and China with a first strike." In other words, the United States may have first­strike capabilities without the threat of a counter-attack. 
Since the Cold War era, schol­ars have argued that the most powerful nations with nuclear capabilities were equally vulnera­ble to attack -something that kept the world relatively peaceful. 

"Nuclear war was tantamount to suicide," Lieber said. "Neither side dared to attack the other." 
From computer models, Lieber and Press determined that the United States has outpaced Russia and China in developing its nuclear technologies. 
"We've taken traditional models of nuclear attacks using calcula­tions similar to those used during the Cold War," Lieber said. 
Lieber said though he believes war with Russia is highly implau­sible -he and Press compared the United States nuclear arsenal to Russia's because Russia is the next strongest nuclear state, pro­viding the hardest case against their claim of U.S. nuclear prima­cy. 
The responses from Russian cit­izens and officials indicate that there may indeed be weaknesses in the Russian nuclear arms pro­gram. According to several press accounts, the article had wide­spread influence in Russia and forced top political and military leaders to respond, including Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, the former Russian Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar and Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov. 
"No serious analyst of the Russian nuclear force would dis­pute how much Russia's nuclear arsenal has decayed," Lieber said. 
The article said that while Russia's nuclear program seems to have "decayed," China's nuclear program has continued to develop -albeit at an extremely slow pace. 
In addition, some reactions in Russia question whether the arti­cle is a warning signal from the United States government. Foreign Affairs managing editor Gideon Rose told The Observer that it was ridiculous to assume that the article was a deliberate attempt to coerce Russia. 
"The reason that it struck a cord in Russia was that it made public in a very provocative way something that many security experts understood, but that Russian citizens may not have [understood]," Rose said. "We thought it would provoke a response, but even we were sur­prised by just how strong the response was in Russia." 
Lieber and Press expected the American government would deny attempting to attain a nuclear advantage as the article proposes, however no such state­ments have been issued. 
"The focus on Iran and Iraq, while justified, has allowed us to miss what could be an equally significant -and potentially very troubling -nuclear develop­ment," Lieber said. 
Although Lieber and Press said the United States has "nuclear primacy" for now, the issue could lead to a nuclear arms race if China and Russia choose to respond by building more nuclear weapons. 
Lieber and Press began compil­ing data for the article about two years ago. Press said that he was motivated to study the issue because he felt it was important to open up debate about U.S. nuclear policy.

'Old to Gold' prepares sale 
Yearly event recycles items to aid charities 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
News Writer 
For students living in resi­dence halls, the last two weeks is a scramble to pass room inspections, pack belongings and study for exams. And for these resi­dents, it may seem easier to toss the carpet in the dump­ster or throw away that cof­fee pot on the way out of the dorm rather than find a storage facility or stuff it in a crowded box. 
But for the second year in a row, the "From Old to Gold" sale offers students a way to donate items they do not plan to use anymore and do not want to store over the summer. 

Last year, 54 tons of items that may have gone to the dumpster found a new home in the South Bend area instead. 
Alan Bigger, the director of building services and the organizer of "From Old to Gold," said he modeled char­ity yard sale after the "Trash to Treasure" event at Pennsylvania State University. Notre Dame debuted its program last year and raised over $27,000 for local charities. This year's goal is to raise $50,000 dollars to benefit 38 local charitable agencies, Bigger said. 
Notre Dame organizers, along with workers from the United Way of St. Joseph's County, began collecting donations from each of the 27 residence halls this week. 
"Last year the halls were really great," Bigger said. "If I could make an all around 
applause I would." 
He said student participa­tion looks like it will be more impressive this year. On Monday, Bigger said he collected a greater number of donated items from the dorms than he did on the first collection day last year. 
"From Old to Gold" is 
interested in electronics, 
carpets, futons, clothing and 
unopened food, provided 
they are in good condition, 
Bigger said. Signs outside 
each dorm indicate where 
students should place their 
items. Bigger asks that stu­
dents tape up rolled-up car­
pets, bundle and tie pieces 
of wood and tie shoes 
together to facilitate the col­
lection process. 
"Last year we ended up with ten thousand shoes and we had to sort them all," Bigger said. 
The "From Old to Gold" sale will be held Saturday, May 27 from 7-11 a.m. in Notre Dame Stadium. The sale is open to the public, but a $5 early admission fee will be charged to customers who want to shop before 9 a.m. 
Last year, nearly 4,000 people attended the first annual sale: Bigger esti­mates 2,000 people were lined up outside the stadium before the gates even opened at 7 a.m. Tables and merchandise took up 55,000 square feet of the Stadium's concourse, and all but four items were sold, Bigger said. 
Electronics -televisions, computers, printers, and DVD players -were the most highly sought after items. Shoppers purchased every item from this depart­ment within fifteen minutes of the gates opening, Bigger said. 
Bigger said he was amazed by the quantity of some of the items at last year's sale. He said students donated two or three thousand pairs of jeans, as well as countless plastic storage crates and coffee pots. 
"We would encourage peo­ple to give items that they would not have use for and then we could put them to use with other persons," Bigger said. 
He said the great thing about the first "From Old to Gold" sale last year was that it took items that would have ended up in a dump­ster and recycled them into the local community. An added benefit of the sale is that the money raised from the sale of the donated items goes to charities. 
"It was like a closed loop system, and everybody bene­fited, and nothing went into the local landfills," Bigger said. 
The Penn State program let students contribute to the local community in a benefi­cial way, Bigger said. He said he heard of people com­ing to the "Trash to Treasure" sale from over 200 miles away. 
"The program tied the stu­dent body together with the community in a somewhat symbiotic relationship," Bigger said. 
Bigger said "From Old to Gold" does not seem to have quite a wide-ranging draw yet, but he knows people come from all over the sur­rounding areas and he has received good feedback about the program from local residents. 
"I think it really improves the town-gown relation­ship," Bigger said.

organizer Kamaria Porter 
"very disappointed." 

"They say it takes time, but how much time?" she said. "We'll fight until we win. This issue is not going away." 
While CLAP did not have an 
appointment scheduled with 
Jenkins, the group arrived at 
the Office of the President at 
10 a.m. and was stopped at the 
door by security members pre­
pared for the planned sit-in. 
CLAP members, all wearing yellow armbands, were told that Jenkins was not in. However, an assistant came out to receive the petitions and a letter to Jenkins. 
In the letter, CLAP expressed its belief that the existing Staff Advisory Council -mentioned by Executive Vice President John Affleck-Graves in an April 19 statement as the appropri­ate venue for workers to raise concerns -is "ineffective in addressing the needs of work­ers." 
"[Y]our administration has refused to give us a definitive response to our call for a task force that was first presented in September, responding that these things take time," the letter read. "We gather today to demand an answer on whether or not you're willing to establish a Just Employment Task Force, and to deliver signed petitions demonstrating our support base." 
The group proceeded to sit outside the Office of the President, speaking with mem­bers of the media and asking passing individuals to sign their petition and include their name, address, telephone number, e-mail and affiliation with Notre Dame. 
Around 10:40 a.m., two group members attempted to 
enter the office and were told 
that no one was available to 
speak with them. 

Jenkins returned to his office 
around 11:30 a.m. and deliv­
ered his statement to the group 
shortly after. 

In the statement, Jenkins 
addresses CLAP's concern for 
social justice by saying 
University policy is grounded 
in Catholic social teaching. 

"At Notre Dame, we value the contributions of every member of our staff, who help make this university the spe­cial place it is. And we are committed to paying fair and just wages and benefits to our workers, as a matter of justice and of fidelity to Catholic social teaching." 
While the sit-in was planned to be an hour in length, four members of the group stayed until around 4:30 p.m., when approximately 30 people returned for a last effort. The supporters prayed a decade of the rosary and then chanted for a living wage as they left the Main Building. 
Porter said the group could not let the semester end with­out trying to get Jenkins' attention one more time. 
"We can't let workers go into the graduation weekend work­ing basically overtime on these poverty wages and not do any­thing about it," she said. 
Porter said the group plans to have another press confer­ence in the near future and will continue to work toward their goals. CLAP's campaign began Sept. 29, 2005, she said, and will continue indefinitely. 
"We got the same sort of non-answer," she said. "Even 30 members of the Notre Dame community couldn't get any recognition, so I don't know what it will take ... but we're gonna keep on going."

Darfur talks to be prolonged 
U.S. Envoy reports African Union will extend Sudan's peace pact deadline 
Associated Press 
ABUJA -A top U.S. envoy said the African Union will extend its Tuesday midnight deadline for a peace pact aimed at resolving the violence in Sudan's Darfur region. 
Deputy Secretary of State Robert B. Zoelliek spoke with time running out on the time limit for mediators to get rebels and the gov­ernment to strike a deal. 
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert B. Zoelliek said late Tuesday that the Africa Union planned to announce the extension, as he waded into the long-stymied talks, pressuring the various fac­tions to strike a deal. British Cabinet member Hilary Benn joined him. 
"I believe there has to be an end to this process," Zoellick said. 
But as time ticked away, there was no word from the AU on an extension and rebels stuck to their demands for concessions on security and power-sharing. 

The Sudanese govern­ment said it approved a draft of the peace deal to end fighting that has killed at least 180,000 people and left millions more homeless. The draft was first circulat­ed last week at the African Union-hosted talks. cide. though they also have bat­porting Darfur rebels. The

IN BRIEF 
Visteon attains first quarter profit 
DETHOIT -Auto-parts supplier Visteon Corp. surprised Wall Street on Tuesday, swing­ing to a first-quarter profit and raising its full­year earnings outlook as its restructuring actions took hold and new business grew. 
Net income for the January-March period totaled $3 million, or 2 cents per share, com­pared with a loss of $163 million, or $1.30 per share, during the same period last year. Analysts, on average, had predicted a loss of 48 cents per share on revenue of $2.97 billion, according to a poll by Thomson Financial. 
Revenue declined 41 percent to $2.96 billion from $4.99 billion last year. The decline was primarily due to the shifting of 23 Visteon facilities to a Ford-managed business entity, Automotive Components Holdings LLC, in October 2005, the company said. Ford Motor Co. spun off Visteon in 2000. 
Visteon has a plant in Bedford, Ind., about 65 miles southwest of Indianapolis, that employs more than 900 people. 
Strong Verizon earnings lift stocks 
NEW YORK -Solid earnings from Verizon Communications Inc. lifted stocks Tuesday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average to its best close in six years even as oil prices neared an all-time high.

There were no new economic reports. On Monday, data on consumer spending and industrial activity showed the economy is expanding at a healthy pace, but comments from FedP.ral Reserve Chairman Ben BernankP. reignited interest rate concerns and triggered a latP.-day selloff.

Leaders aim for more control 
Leftist government plans to regulate mining, forestry as well as natural gas industry 
Associated Press 
LA PAZ -Bolivia's leftist government said Tuesday it would extend control over mining, forestry and other sectors of the econo­my after President Evo Morales nationalized the country's huge natural gas industry. Foreign govern­ments warned relations could be damaged. 
Soldiers were posted at 56 gas installations around the country a day after Morales issued a decree that analysts say could drive petroleum companies from South America's poorest nation and isolate Bolivia from important allies like Brazil and Spain. 
The move solidifies Morales' role alongside Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and Cuba's Fidel Castro in Latin America's new axis of socialist-inclined leaders united against "capitalist, imperialist" U.S. influence. 
Morales said Monday that the gas decree "was just the beginning, because tomorrow it will be the mines, the forest resources and the land." Morales' planning minister earlier this month spoke of plans for "drastic reforms" of mining laws. 
On Tuesday, Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera said mining compa­nies could face higher taxes and royalty payments and that the government will intensify enforcement of existing laws to break up big underdeveloped land holdings, apparently to turn them over to the poor. 
The government also will crack down on foreign tim­ber companies violating conservation laws, Garcia said, and would steer com­panies to export finished wood products rather than raw timber. 


While the gas national­ization decree was not unexpected, analysts called Morales' use of the army extreme, the images of sol­diers toting automatic weapons outside refineries and gas fields reminiscent of military dictatorships past. 
"With this move, he risks alienating natural and oth­erwise sympathetic part­ners like Brazil and Spain," said Michael Shifter, a Latin American analyst at the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington. "Ordering the military to seize the natu­ral gas fields is unneces­sarily confrontational and antagonistic." 
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil held an emergency Cabinet meeting to assess the impact on his nation-the biggest buyer of Bolivian gas and the owner of Petroleo Brasileiro SA, one of Bolivia's biggest gas pro­ducers. 
Petrobras President Sergio Gabrielli said offi­cials were seeking "to secure our rights" to Bolivian gas and the $1.6 billion that Petrobras has invested in Bolivia since the mid-1990s. 
Spain's Foreign Ministry summoned Bolivia's busi­ness attache to express "deep concern about the measure and the possible consequences for bilateral relations." 
The Spanish-Argentine Repsol YPF petroleum company is one of the largest foreign players in Bolivia and Argentina is the second-biggest market for Bolivian gas. 
Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega said Tuesday that the national­ization "is definitely nega­tive for Bolivia" and would likely deter foreign invest­ment. 
Besides Petrobras and Repsol, the biggest natural gas investors in Bolivia are Britain's BG Group PLC and BP PLC, France's Total SA and U.S.-based Exxon Mobil Corp. 

Lay finishes testifyillg at Emon trial 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON -After exchanging some parting shots with his prose­cutor, Kenneth Lay finished six days of testimony at his federal fraud and conspiracy trial Tuesday by professing love for Enron Corp., the company he founded, and the peo­ple who worked there. 
"I loved Enron very much," Lay said in a brief response to the final question from his lawyer, George Secrest. "And I loved Enron's employees very much. I spent half my professional life running Enron. I think we built a great company. We changed energy markets around the world." 
"I think the most painful thing in my life was watching Enron finally have to go into bankruptcy." 
The comment was similar to his statement at the opening of his tes­timony last week. And as he has during more than a wnek on the witness stand, Lay jousted with prosecutor John Hueston, this time over taking responsibility for the implosion of the once-giant energy trading company. 

An accounting professor from the University of Southern California hired by the defense testified that Enron's accounting was sound. 
Jerry Arnold spent much of Tuesday afternoon on the stand dis­cussing accounting regulations in minute detail and offering an analy­sis of Enron's financial reporting. He focused on the third quarter of 2001 when Enron reported $638 million in losses and a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity related to failed broadband and water-trading ventures as wP.Il as the unwinding of so-called Haptors. off-the-books financial structures backed by falling Enron stock. 
The government alleges Lay knew many Enron assets were overval­ued, that losses were coming and misrepresented this to the public. 
Arnold, who was to return to the stand Wednesday, said Enron accounting and financial reporting was proper. 
He acknowledged that he was paid more than $1 million for his work. 
''I'm here to provide my expertise on facts and circumstances," he said, defending the expenses. "''m not here, if you'll excuse the expression, to be a hired gun." 
Earlier, Lay continued to cite deceit by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow as being "at the heart" of Enron's collapse. 
"Your list of people to blame and events to blame did not include yourself. did it, sir?" Hueston asked him. 
"Did I make mistakns?" Lay replied. ''I'm sur!' I did. Mr. Hueston. I had to make rnal-time decisions based on the information I had at the time."

The pamphlets recom­mend carrying plenty of water, food and salt, and advise migrants to keep their clothing on to avoid dehydration and sunburn.

"We have too long been advo­cating changes," said Mark Hosenker, acting NTSB chair­man. "It's on our most-wanted list. This is a tragedy that should not have happened." 
The plane crashed shortly after taking off from the Montrose airport on Nov. 28, 2004. Other victims were pilot Luis Polaneo-Espaillat, 50, and flight attendant Warren Hichardson III, 36. At the time, the temperature was below freezing and there was snow on the ground and slush on the runway. 
NTSB investigators said Tuesday they had repeatedly warned pilots to cheek for iee on the wings, even if it wasn't visible, by running their hands along the surface. 
Before Polaneo-Espaillat took off, he and his eo-pilot looked out tlw window to cheek the condition of the wings of the twin-engine Canadair jet. According to the cockpit recorder, the pilot said "Looks dear to me."

Police find kidnapped teenager barely alive 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS -Ashley Heeves had boon lying in the woods for more than 30 hours by the time searchers spotted her through the driving rain. The 17 -year­old was covered with insect bites. her back was broken. and investigators were sure she was dead -until she took a breath. 
A day earlier, authorities now believe, a high school teacher tried to kill her. 
"It was almost disbelief that she was still alive," investigator Steve .Johnson of the St. Clair County, Ill., Sheriff's lkpartment. recalled Tuesday. 
They had to clear brush and trees to get a stretcher to the girl. then rushed her to Cardinal Glennon Children's llospital in St. Louis, where she was in serious condition Tuesday. 
.Johnson is now helping build a case against the 26-year-old teacher and wannabe pro­wrestler, Samson Shelton. who is jailed on $1 million bond and chargPd with kidnapping and attomptPd murder. 
Authorities have said Ashley and Shelton had a "relation­ship." though Johnson wouldn't elaborate or say how the girl, who attended a different school. knew the older man. 
The investigator would only describe Shelton as a known acquaintance of Ashley and say that Shelton was with investiga­tors early Saturday when they finally found her in a desolate area of Citizens Park in the St. Louis suburb of Belleville, Ill. She had been missing since leaving her home Thursday afternoon for a job interview; the Jeep she was driving was found eight hours later in another park in the area. 
Shelton was a driver's ed teacher by day in tiny Freeburg, Ill., and a pro wrestler and country line dancer by night, authorities said. 
No phone listing could be found for him in Smithton, Ill., listed as his home. He has declined a public defender and indicated he would hire his own attorney, though there was none of record as of Tuesday, a St. Clair County Circuit Court clerk said. His arraignment could come later this week, authorities said. 
Johnson suggested that it might be difficult to determine what led the man to strangle Ashley with a belt and, accord­ing to the criminal complaint, use "his forearm with such force as to break the neck." 
"With any human being, there's a lot to anyone. You can never predict human nature," Johnson said. When it comes to scouring Shelton's background, "we're definitely looking into it." 
Ashley's family has declined to comment. No further infor­mation about her injuries or chances for recovery has been released. 
Johnson said he hopes the details of what happened to the girl and why surface more quickly than the long and frus­trating search to find her. 
Teams with dogs and in heli­copters had searched for hours but couldn't locate the girl, and even before Johnson and other searchers entered Citizen's Park with Shelton in tow, Johnson said, "we all believed she was deceased." 
Politician accused of racism 
U.S. Justice Department alleged Ike Brown discriminated against whites 
Associated Press 

MACON, Miss.-Ike Brown is a legend in Mississippi poli­tics, a fast-talking operative both loved and hated for his ability to turn out black voters and get his candidates into office. 
That success has also landed him at the heart of a federal lawsuit that's about to turn the Voting Rights Act on its end. 
For the first time, the U.S. Justice Department is using the 1965 law to allege racial discrimination against whites. 
Brown, head of the Democratic Party in Mississippi's rural Noxubee County, is accused of waging a campaign to defeat white vot­ers and candidates with tactics including intimidation and coercion. Also named in the lawsuit is Circuit Clerk Carl Mickens, who has agreed to refrain from rejecting white voters' absentee ballots con­sidered defective while accept­ing similar ballots from black voters. 
Brown shakes off the allega­tions. 
"They've bee_n trying to tar­get me for years, the attorney general and all them, because we're so successful," the 52­year-old says. "Hey, if you're a failure, nobody will mess with you. But we're successful in east Mississippi." 
The Justice Department complaint says Brown and those working with him "par­ticipated in numerous racial appeals during primary and general campaigns and have criticized black citizens for supporting white candidates and for forming biracial politi­cal coalitions with white can­didates." 
Noxubee County -a rural area along the Alabama line named for a Choctaw word meaning "stinking water" ­has a population of 12,500, 69 percent black and 30 percent white. 
Whites once dominated county politics here, but now only one white person holds countywide office, and he says Brown tried to recruit an out­of-county black candidate to run against him three years ago. 

The federal case against Brown, scheduled for trial this fall, represents a change in direction in the use of the Voting Rights Act, says Jon Greenbaum, director of the voting rights project for the Washington-based Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. 
The law was written to pro­tect racial minorities in the 1960s when Mississippi and other Southern states strictly enforced segregation. 
"The main concern we have in the civil rights community isn't necessarily that that DOJ brought this case," Greenbaum says. "It's that the department is not bringing meritorious cases on behalf of African-American and Native American voters." 
Justice Department records show the department's last voting-rights case alleging dis­crimination against black vot­ers was filed in 2001. Since then, six cases have been brought on behalf of voters of Hispanic or Asian descent in five states -plus the case involving white voters in Mississippi. 
Justice Department spokesman Eric Holland would not comment on the 
case. but provided stacks of documents, including the con­sent decree signed by Mickens, Noxubee County's chief elections officer. 
Brown, a former tax prepar­er, served 21 months in prison in the 1990s on a felony con­viction of preparing fraudulent federal income-tax returns. He retained his right to vote. The same federal judge who han­dled his earlier trial is now overseeing the Justice Department case. 
"This case is real simple," Brown says, stretching back in a maroon chair during an interview in Mickens' office, where voter-registration records are kept. "Find me one white person that was dis­criminated against." 
The main white person who makes the claim is Ricky Walker, the county prosecuting attorney who believes Brown recruited an opponent for him simply because he's white, an action Walker called "racist." 
Walker says that when he qualified to run again in 2003, Brown brought in a black lawyer from another part of the state to run against him. A circuit judge found that the lawyer, Winston James Thompson III, had not estab­lished residency, and Thompson was not allowed on the ballot. 
"I think he just wanted to have a person in that office that he had some control over, a black person," Walker says. 
Brown, chairman of the Noxubee County Democratic Party since 2000, says Thompson recruited himself. 
Brown's defense attorney, prominent black Republican Wilbur Colom, disagrees with Brown's political views but defends his right to speak. 
"I think Ike does play race politics," Colom says. "He is a black political leader who fights the fight like we were still in the 1970s. He doesn't recognize the progress that we have made." 
But Colom criticizes the Justice Department for filing a complaint against a black political consultant while ignoring similar behavior by white political operatives in Mississippi. 
"It has overtones of politics and that's the wrong road for Civil Hights Division of tho Justice Department," the attorney says. "It's going to destroy their credibility the next time they ask black peo­ple to listen to them."

I am rather embarrassed to admit it, but there is almost nothing in the world that I love so much as words. In the art and sdcnee of' writing, when everything falls into place there ean be found ful­fillment, spirituality, self-actualization and truth. It is a light that comes and goes -because I am as adept at writing garbage as anyone. But when words willingly flow I won­der whether or not humans themselves are just living words, and I think I under­stand what Genesis means when it says that the universe was spoken into being. 
We are born to be creators -to shape the world and to call into being unimagined ideas. To be human is to be a creator, and vice-versa. It is l'or this reason that I, and many others, enshrine the freedom of expression above all other essential forms of good. After all, if you take away any other freedom it destroys a person's dignity or potential for fulfillment, but to take away the freedom to create is to crush a person's essential nature. 
If you can understand the way that I feel about words -though perhaps in your particular case you understand through art, musie or science-then you should have no trouble under­standing my attitudes toward copyright in general. It does not take more than a touch of classical libertarianism to smell something rotten about the cur­rent copyright regime. The truth is, international copyright law is so stag­geringly broken that I only have spaee here to address a single aspect that I find most troubling. 
For the duration of a copyright, typi­cally more than a eentury, it is forbid-

Lance Gallop 
Tidewater Blues 

den by law for anyone to create and 
disseminate any work which is in any 
way derived from existing copyrighted 
material, without regard to the social 
value of such a derivative work. Only 
parody -which is very narrowly 
defined-is exempt. Contrary to pop­
ular belief satire is not protected in 
any way. Some may remember "The 
Wind Done Gone," and the JibJab.eom 
political parody of "This Land is My 
Land," both of which nearly were con­
signed to oblivion by the estates of 
their creators. 
It is troubling to think that there may exist many more works, and potential works, of great merit that will never see the light of day because of this "right" to censor another's work that has been granted to authors in the name of protection. 
Copyright, as written in the Constitution, is a limited restriction with a specific purpose. It was created as a temporary protection to encour­age authors to contribute their works to society. Today copyright has mutat­ed into a form of intellectual entitle­ment. The term "intellectual proper­ty," a form of Orwellian doublespeak, is used to promote the notion that ideas can have owners and that thesn owners control both what they have made and anything similar created by anyone else. 
You are a criminal if you adapt an author's ideas in your own way and share them with your friends. You are a felon if you explon~ an author's plots in forms that she did not envision, or if you pen unauthorized satire or soda[ commentary in her words. Copyright has granted authors exclusive and unquestioned authority to determine what their works will mean for us, and to censor any form of reinterpretation that they do not approve of. We cannot make anything else of these ideas until copyright holders (and probably we as well) are long dead. 
This situation is patently unconstitu­tional, because it amounts to the fed­eral government granting a writ authorizing a person to censor anoth­er's ideas and the right to enforce a single interpretation of a creative work-"Gone with the Wind" versus the "Wind Done Gone"-as the only acceptable version. This has a long­term damaging impact on the natural spread and reinterprotation of ideas that is essential for the functioning of' a free society, and it depresses the expression of' the essential nature of humans as creators. 
Fortunately there are ways to fight this problem and to risn up as sup­porters of' the free exchange of' ideas. If' you visit my Web site, you will find a copy of' this article and many others that l have written. All of' these have been perpetually released under a Creative Commons Licnns1~. This means that you can copy them, you can distribute them, you can perform them and you can create new works based upon them. You may use them to mock me, to praise me. to promote things that I agree with or to promote things for which I have the deepest dis­gust. The freedom is yours. 
I strongly encourage other colum­nists for The Observer, other writers and indeed this entire newspaper to release their copyrights under similar terms. Freedom of' expression and of' adaptation is a human right, a civic virtue and thn mark of' a great univer­sity. We must commit oursnlves to the preservation of this virtue.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Yearbook oversight disappoints team 
I am writing a letter in light of the recent publication of the 2006 "Dome" yearbook. As a member of the men's cross country team, I feel I can speak for my teammates as well as the entire women's cross country team in say­ing how extremely disappointed I am that the yearbook staff forgot to include us in this year's publication. 
Now I know that most likely the only people who noticed this oversight are the members of each respective team. Some might even be thinking, "we have a cross country team?" Things like that I'm fine with. After all, those that run cross country have never been into the sport for the glitz and glamour nor fame and fortune. These perks are reserved for other sports. But what I'm not 11ne with is the lack of including the men's and women's cross country teams in the yearbook-especial­ly when the yearbook is supposed to recognize all the accomplishments and great moments that have happened in the past year at Our Lady's University. Both teams have been responsible for some great achievements for the University. Along with the Big East Championships on both ends, the men placed third and the women seventh at the NCAA Championships. Each team also had three All-Americans. On top of that, the men's team currently has the highest point total (S5) of' any other team at Notre Dame this year for the NACDA Oireetors' Cup (for­
merly the Sears Cup-an annual award that goes to the best all-around college sports program in each division). 
As a sport that rarely gets recognized, the "Dome" yearbook is one of the few things we can count on for being honored. But it's not even the recognition we are yearning for. What we really want is to have this year­book and be able to turn to our section in the future and appreciate the time we spent at Notre Dame. Unfortunately the "Dome" yearbook has forever deprived us of this ability. 
So I ask Editor-in-Chief Moira Madden and Sports Editor Mike Kim simply, how did this oversight occur? Every year in the past the yearbook has managed to include a section for both men's and women's cross coun­try. I hope as a staff you have learned from this mistake and will ensure that it never happens again to anyone.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
'Common Proposal' must be followed 
Catholic conscience and war 
In an April 26 Viewpoint article, Clare Feeney wrote on the decision of Notre Dame Catholic Peace Fellowship (NDPF) to refrain from protest­ing this year's ROTC Pass in Review. Instead, Feeney offered a forum for dialogue between with ROTC proposed for next year. Already, NDPF has worked with ROTC in past semesters to host several of the thought provoking dialogue sessions. 
However, I think many aspects of the article regarding ROTC need to be clarified, and many other questions need to be asked. 
First off, NDPF does not seek to "alienate" or "offend" any members of the ROTC program. In years past, the protests may have unfortunately caused offense, but this was never their intent. While wishing to question the appropriateness of ROTC on our campus, we never argue that the stu­dents enrolled in ROTC are bad people. That must be understood. 
Secondly, the Catholic view of warfare has two responses -either "just war" or total non-vio­lence. Participating in any war the U.S. government dictates does not coincide with the Catholic principles of either view. Indeed, the approach of "just war" (the most popular among Catholics in America) is actually illegal when in military service. If you do not declare yourself a pacifist, you are required to fight in any and all wars as a soldier. This is the current system in place -one endorsed by the HOTC program. 
Members of ROTC have little say in where they go upon graduation, as military contracts (bind­ing for most ROTC students after their freshman year) leave the deciding up to military command. But what if. like the majority of our military, they end up in Iraq? Will they participate, with the training given to them on our campus, in a con­flict condemned by the Catholic Church? Or will they refuse to be an instrument of an unjust 
------------------------------------------~---­
war? 

Many argue that it is far better to have soldiers trained at Notre Dame, where they will receive some type of philosophy and theology before graduation. But, with the ROTC curriculum stan­dardized by the Department of Defense, can the ideas of just war and Catholic thought be required in the ROTC curriculum? If not, are we truly giving soldiers every tool they will need to face the hard questions of conscience that they 
will inevitably face? Will a soldier trained at Notre Dame be any less likely to partake in unjust war because of the education we have provided them? 
Finally, it is no secret at many students in TC enlist in the pro-
to pay for their col­education. The schol­ps offered are 
pting and the govern­provides stipends health care coverage most ROTC members. 
ut, with an endowment 
vering around three ,,...uuvu dollars, can we not 1i!r.-.-..,irlo another option 
ese students? arships must be ere­to ensure all that to attend Notre 
have the funds nec­
essary. However, that is an issue -like many others dealing with ROTC on our campus-that the Notre Dame adminis­tration has yet to address. 
In writing this article, I hope that all members of the Notre Dame community begin to think about our identity as a Catholic university and the presence of ROTC. I hope that you will be part of the dialogues that will take place next semester. I challenge you to think about the hard issues of conscience posed by the Catholic teach­ing on war. Now, more than ever, we need to be thinking about the issues of war and peace.

Senior proud of Jenkins 
In regards to University President Father John Jenkins' closing statement, I would like to applaud our President's courage for tackling such a controversial issue in his first year. Certainly, such actions could be deemed as political suicide but great visionaries bur­den themselves with audacious goals. 
I am sill gripped by a state of ambivalence on the issue. I have read the opinions of both supporters and detractors in the viewpoints; likewise, I've dialogued with members of the administration, faculty, alumni and fellow students. Often, Notre Dame is considered "too Catholic" by academics in the intellectual com­munity -a bastion of community, courage and com­mitment. It is my impression that Jenkins' course of action will not change that impression. 
As one administration official explained to me, "Notre Dame's BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) is to be an elite academic institution while maintaining the core values of the Catholic Church." Initially, I thought that Jenkins was submitting to political pressure for fear of being perceived as unpopular. However, I now believe that Jenkins' statement was driven by a "bend but not break" mentality. In considering the life of President Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh, many did not always consider his progressive outlook to be exactly aligned with the Catholic Church. Nevertheless, history proved his detractors wrong, and Notre Dame was both empowered and blessed to have had such an extraordinary leader at the helm for over three decades. 
As Thomas Aquinas once said, "virtue lies in the middle." I am not implying that Jenkins compromised the integrity of the Catholic Church and sold out to the secular crowds. Being a devout child and, more importantly, leader of the Catholic Church does not always entail acquiescing to the status quo. Rather, it involves seeking and challenging the greater truths of the present, and consequently shaping a better path for the future. Those who advocate the position that Jenkins is playing a dangerous game on a slippery slope have their warranted concerns. As for me, I con­sider it an honor to graduate in the first class under the administration of Jenkins. 
Matt Somma

Off-Campus May 1 
I was very heartened by University President Father John Jenkins' Jan. 23 address to the faculty on academic freedom and the Catholic character of Notre Dame, and while disappointed by his "Closing Statement" in which I thought he took a large step back, I finally concluded that if presentations counter to Catholic belief on campus were balanced by explanations of Catholic tradition (see quote from the "Common Proposal" that accompanied the "Closing Statement"), then such events might indeed have some value. 
These explanations of Catholic truths would provide students and fac­ulty ignorant of them insights and information they might not otherwise receive given the large number of non-Catholic faculty, the deplorable state of Catholic religious preparation of so many entering students and the very limited and inadequate instruc­tion in theology and philosophy cur­rently provided to undergraduates at Notre Dame. (As to the preparation of the faculty in Catholic teachings, I leave that to the Administration, and some there have expressed concerns on this point.) Having now followed the reports and statements in The Observer and elsewhere for several months, I fear that my initial optimism was badly misplaced. 
Readers may recall that in his clos­ing statement Jenkins, wrote: "As long as the Gospel message and the Catholic intellectual tradition are appropriately represented, we can welcome any serious debate on any thoughtful position here at Notre Dame." 
He continued, "The only exception I can imagine would come in the case of expression that is overt and insistent in its contempt for the values and sen­sibilities of this University, or of any of the diverse groups that form part of our community. This sort of expression is not at issue in the current debate, nor do I expect it to be an issue in the future." 
Finally, he noted, "Thanks to the efforts of some faculty members, this year's performance of "The Vagina Monologues" was brought into dia­logue with Catholic tradition through panels which followed each perform­ance. Panelists presented the Catholic teaching on human sexuality, and stu­dents and faculty engaged one another and these issues in serious and informed discussion." 
I am troubled by these statements of Jenkins on two counts. First, I believe a fairly large segment of the "commu­nity," particularly if that includes graduates, indeed did find "The Vagina Monologues" to be "overt and insistent in its contempt for [their] values and sensibilities." Jenkins' assertion that the play was not at issue with the val­ues and sensibilities of a very large part of the community simply mystifies me. Rather than to simply assert this, it would have been useful had he explained how he arrived at this con­clusion, and I hereby invite him to do so publicly. 
Second, I have seen practically noth­ing in The Observer or elsewhere on how the panels that followed presenta­tion of "The Vagina Monologues" appropriately presented Catholic tradi­tion as called for in Jenkins' closing statement. Indeed, with the exception of Fr. Paulinus Odozor's comments at the panel on the evening of Feb. 14, the other panel participants were quite supportive of the presentation and dis­missive of Catholic tradition and teach­ing as set forth in the statements of Bishop D'Arcy, Frs. Bill Miscamble and John Coughlin, David Solomon and many others who have commented on the play. 
I have not changed my mind about the opportunities for education and enlightenment of students and faculty that presentation of materials counter to Catholicism might offer. However, Jenkins needs to step forward now and ensure that the tenants of the "Common Proposal" are adhered to fully and, if they are not, to take 
appropriate action. 
Given the statements of professors Robin Darling Young, Cathleen Kaveny, Jackie Smith, Carolyn Nordstrom, Mary Doak, Jean Porter and Mary Rose D'Angelo that followed the presenta­tions of the play (as reported in The Observer), I am not at all confident that some faculty members, perhaps even a good number, plan to follow the "Common Proposal" in good faith. Five of the panelists named above are members of the Theology department and all but Odozor defended the pres­entation. How could they defend in the context of Catholic teaching this vile piece of pornography that so debases women? And how could they justify its sexual violence as serving to defend women from sexual violence? These panelists pursued their own agendas, and to them I would suggest that there are a good number of secular universi­ties that would no doubt welcome their applications, having thus so clearly demonstrated their contempt for the Catholic Church. This would also offer an opportunity to repopulate the Theology department with theologians who believe in and defend the faith.

Scent Critics 

Paul Grnengrass' "United 93" is not a lot of things. It is not a film that tries to answnr tough, ever-lingering questions. It is not a film that tries to explain the seope of the events of Sept. 11, 2001. It is not a film that tries to examine the bigger picture. 
Yet these traits (or lack thereof) make it a stronger and better pieture, and makn its impact and conviction res­onatn that rnueh more. 
What "United 93" does accomplish is pulling thn audience in a front-row seat to watch the events unfold. Critics and detractors have asked why this is being donn now -everyone saw the events unfold in great detail on every televi­sion across the country (if not immedi­ematography (a particularly modern and stylish approach) certainly evokes the "you-are-there" feeling that the filmmakers obviously wanted, but it also makes some of the events confus­ing and sometimes difficult to follow. 


Greengrass' methodology and obvious respect for the material is a good lit ­his reverent, powerful "Bloody Sunday" was sharp and insightful, and "The Bourne Supremacy" was a slick, well made Hollywood blockbuster. "United 93" falls somewhere in between, cast­ing a professional Hollywood sheen over the serious and socially aware subject matter.

Associated Press 
GRAPEVINE, Texas ­Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't want one NFL team in Los Angeles. He wants two. 
The California governor will probably have to be satisfied with half of his wish -at least in the near future. 
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and a committee of 11 owners heard pre­sentations Tuesday from officials representing Los Angeles, Anaheim and Pasadena, three cities that want a club. The area has been without an NFL fran­chise for more than a decade. 

Schwarzenegger went first. After meeting with the owners, the actor­turned-politician emerged to say he was there to make sure "we're getting not only one NFL team to the Los Angeles area, Southern California, but to actually get two teams. That's why I came. Why limit it?" 
New York Giants chair­man Steve Tisch, a long­time Los Angeles resident who is on the committee, said that was highly unlikely. 
"I'd be shocked if the suggestion internally to recommend two teams 
IN BRIEF 
Damon takes Fenway boos 
lightly in Yankee uniform 
BOSTON -Johnny Damon still flashed his endearing smile. He still showed his sense of humor. And he stood patiently at his Yankees' locker reliving the boos from his former fans. 
One day after being jeered on every at-bat during his return to Fenway Park in the hated pinstripes, the happy-go-lucky Damon took it all in stride. 
"You kind of just sit back and smile and say, 'Whatever you want to do, you're not going to break me or my character,"' Damon said Tuesday night before the second and final game of the series was postponed by rain. 'Tm very happy with the person that I am, the way I play this game." 
Boston fans cheered his effort and passion the past four seasons when he played center field for the Red Sox but turned against him Monday. They were ready again on Tuesday before the game was called. 

ever comes up. I think the numbers are too big. I think it would be an over­whelming suggestion," Tisch said. 
Added Tagliabue: "One team is our immediate goal. Long term, I think two is a realistic goal." 
The 11 owners spent six hours listening to California politicians and deemed it a significant step in getting the NFL back to nation's second-largest tel­evision market. Tagliabue has made that a priority since both the Rams and Raiders left after the 1994 season. 
"The fact that we're here and doing what we're doing is better than any­thing I could say," Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said. "This is the strongest effort I've seen on the league's part." 
Los Angeles plans to con­struct a stadium within the shell of the existing Los Angeles Coliseum. Anaheim is offering a 53­acre tract of land for the stadium and economic development. Pasadena, considered a longshot, pro­vided an update on the Rose Bowl. 
"Everybody came away feeling it was some of the best time thefve spent on NFL business in recent months," Tagliabue said.

DURHAM, N.C. -The district attorney prosecuting the Duke University rape case faced two chal­lengers in the Democratic primary Tuesday as voters weighed his han­dling of the headline-grabbing case. 
The allegations against team mem­bers have turned what might have been a low-key election into a refer­endum on Mike Nifong's perform­ance. 
"I don't think he did his job," said Antonia Weeks, a writer who has lived in Durham for 29 years. "I don't know who did what, and I'm not pre­tending to know, but I've seen a lot of cases handled in this community, and I've never seen one handled this way before." 
The winner of Tuesday's Democratic primary vote among Nifong, Freda Black and Keith Bishop will likely be the next district attorney since no Republicans are running. 
Lakers forward Brown to be 
investigated on assault charges 
LOS ANGELES -Police Tuesday were investigating a report of a sexu­al assault involving Lakers center Kwame Brown. 
The alleged assault occurred early Saturday, hours after the Lakers beat the Phoenix Suns in Game 3 of their NBA playoff series, Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Jason Lee said. 
"The Los Angeles Cmmty district attorney's office has been made aware of the investigation," said Lee, who declined to provide further details. The case is under investiga­tion by the department's Robbery Homicide Division. 
The Lakers were in Phoenix to play the Suns in Game 5 of their Western Conference playoff series Tuesday night. Lakers spokesman John Black said the 24-year-old Brown was with the team but wouldn't comment fur­ther.

Third seeded Belles look for MIAA title 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's enters the MIA!\ Tournament as the No. 3 sned aftflf posting an 11-5 league record, and will face ofT against No. 2 seed Alma on Friday at 11 a.m. 
Alma ( 12-4) fell to the Belles, IJ-1 and 8-1, on April 
8. 
The Seots' only other two losses eame against No. 1 seed Hope College on April 15. llope swept Alma 5-0 and 12­1. 
The second game of the day takes place between Ilope and No. 4 send Olivet. 
Hope (12-1) suffered one conference loss the entire sea­son, falling 1-0 to Saint Mary's on April 5. 
Olivet enters the tournament with a 10-6 record. Olivet swept St. Mary's 2-1 and 6-4 on April 22. 
Even though the Belles fell to Olivet, senior pitcher and outfielder Bridget Grall does not feel that this should be a problem for the team. 
"We are going in starting all over," Grall said. "Starting back at the basics and per­fecting things." 
Grall said the team hopes to focus on improving their already successful season. In order for this to happen, Saint Mary's will have to continue to play loose and not be distract­ed. 

Grall also said the Belles' motivation all season has to been to have fun. If the team is not having fun, than they do not play well. 
Grall, along with fellow sen­iors Audrey Gajor and Meghan Marenkovic, play on Friday with the hope that their game against Alma will not be their last. 
"I think it is easier as a sen­ior to get fired up [for the tournament] than it is for the underclassmen," Grall said. "They have years ahead of them." 
Belles coach Erin Sullivan said the team wants to contin­ue far into the post-season, to ensure that Friday will not be last time the underclassmen walk onto the field with the senior class. 
"We really want to win that tournament [MI!\A tourna­ment[ and advance to Hegionals," Sullivan said. "That has been our goal all season long."

Team will face Vandy as NCAAs loom 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 
Notre Dame will look to earn its best record in team history Sunday in a 12 p.m. game at Moose Krause Stadium against Vanderbilt. 
The Irish (12-3, 4-1 Big East) are coming off an 11-10 victory against No. 13 Syracuse with a last second goal, and hope to continue winning in their last tune-up before the NCAA Tournament in May. 
"At this stage, we are play­ing mainly for seeding and home field advantage," Irish coach Tracy Coyne said. "We just need to bring our game." 
As always for the Irish, Coyne said the goal in the days leading up to a contest is to perfect various aspects of play in order to continue developing on the field on a game-by-game basis. 
This week is a little differ­ent for Notre Dame, as Coyne is preparing her team not only for the Vanderbilt game, but also for the NCAA Tournament. 
"We want to win it all," Coyne said. "We are just five games away from playing in the champi­onship game

games than last season -in no small part to the addition of freshman Jill Byers and especially the outstanding play of senior attack Crysti Foote. 
Byers has 41 goals and 20 assists going into Sunday's game. She has also provided 
Foote has 
a passing option for Foote, leaving her frontline partner more space and less attention from opposing defenses so either can be a

score.  
60  goals,  29  

assists, and 41 draw controls -all records for the Irish. 
"Crysti is leaving as the best player ever to wear a Notre Dame lacrosse jersey," Coyne said. "Her success is unparal­leled -she has earned the right to be that player." 

Her incredible statistical effort combined with her fearless play and strong lead­ership on and off the field earned her a Tewaaraton award nomination this year. Coyne said she believes Byers should be a finalist for the award due to not only her play in college, but the fact that she is one of the few international-level players at the college level. 
Byers played for Coyne as part of the Canadian World Cup team last year, leading Team Canada to a fourth place finish at the event. 
"Foote is probably the most underrated player named for the Tewaaraton trophy this year," Coyne said. "It will be very competitive, but I believe the number speak for themselves."

Irish take on beasts of the East 
Squads aims to take yet another title in Storrs, Connecticut 
By FRAN TOLAN Sports Writer 
Notre Dame feels well pre­pared as it heads to Storrs, Conn. this weekend for the Big East championships, after strong showings in its most recent events, 
"At this point, we're about as ready as we're going to get [for the Big East]," Irish sprinters coach John Millar said. 
Last weekend, at the Hillsdale "Gina" Relays and the Drake Relays, the Irish added seven more Big East qualifying marks to their already strong outdoor record. 
Notre Dame looks to reclaim their conference title after finishing in second place last year, and winning in 2003 and 2004. 
The men's team is excited as it prepares for tough con­ference foes, including Louisville and tournament host Connecticut. 
"We've been training really hard all season and we're definitely looking for a win," 

-
Notre Dame junior Geoff Bennett said. 
Bennett qualified for the 110-meter hurdles last week­end at the "Gina" Relays in Hillsdale, Mich. · 
Meanwhile, the women are in position to record an impressive Big East "triple crown" this year with titles already in cross-country and indoor track and field. 
The last conference school to do that on the women's side was Villanova in 1987­88, prior to Notre Dame's entry into the Big East. 
The woman's team will be up against stiff competition, including a tough Pittsburgh unit that won last year's Big East Championsliip in Piscataway, N.J. 
Coach Millar called this event the one that the Irish put the most emphasis on from a team perspective. 
"The NCAAs are more about individual goals, but we ask a lot out of the ath­letes at the Big East," Millar said. 
Millar pointed out that, in order to help the team, some athletes are asked to com­
. pete in more events than they are typ.ically used to. 
"We really just want to rack up as many points as we can and, hopefully, it's more than everyone else has," Millar said. 
The meet will be held this Friday through Sunday at the George J. Sherman Family Sports Complex in Storrs, Connecticut. 
"The last week has given [the athletes] an opportunity to fine-tune," Millar said. "I think we're well-prepared."

"I think we just didn't come out with an intense attitude," Irish third baseman Meagan Ruthrauff said. "We've been playing on our heels a lot and that's become a trend for us lately." 
With only four games left this season -a pair of doublehead­ers this weekend against Seton Hall and St. John's-Notre Dame will need to rebound quickly to get back to its win­ning ways before the Big East championships start May 11. 
The final four Big East games will be crucial for the Irish to build momentum heading into the postseason. 
"This weekend hugely affects us for the postseason," Gumpf said. "If you are set to play us in the postseason, you are looking at us and thinking we are tanking at the wrong time of the season." 
As for the postseason itself, the team cannot start to get ready for the Big East t<Jurna­ment because getting back on the right track is more impor­tant at this point. 
"We need to get four wins out of this weekend," Huthrauff said. "It is crucial for our morale to turn it up a notch."

The Professional Development Committee of the University Libraries would like to invite you to a lecture by Judith Krug, director of the American Library Association's Office oflntellectual Freedom, Thursday, May 4 at 4PM in the Hesburgh Library Auditorium: 
Intellectual Freedom, National Security, and the Academy: the threats offederal legislation and administrative actions to intellectual freedom at American colleges and universities 
Dr. Krug is probably the person most identified with libraries and 
intellectual freedom, having directed the ALA's Office ofIntellectual 
Freedom since its founding in 1968. She helped to found both the 
Freedom to Read Foundation and Banned Books Week in order to raise 
awareness about censorship. She is also the author of numerous books 
and articles on intellectual freedom, censorship, and patron privacy in 
libraries. 

Recent debates about academic freedom on campus and the amending of 
the USA PATRlOT Act make her presentation particularly relevant to 
the Notre Dame community. We hope that you will take this opportunity 
to come and debate these issues. 
Please join us Thursday, May 4 at 4PM in the Hesburgh Library Auditorium.

Jeremy Barnes drove in three of the runs with his second home run of the year. 
Long pitched 3 1-3 innings, allowed nine runs on eight hits and walked four. 
Notre Dame starting pitcher David Gruener threw just one inning, giving up two hits in a scoreless first. He was replaced by senior left-bander Tom Thornton, who threw two scoreless innings, allowing no hits and striking out one. 
Thornton, who usually starts for the Irish on Sundays, missed the final game of the Connecticut series with a leg injury. Mainieri said he hasn't decided if Thornton will start this coming Sunday against Louisville or if sophomore lefthander Wade Korpi, who pitched against the Huskies, will replace him. 
"The test is going to be tomor­row, if his knee swells up and how he feels," Mainieri said. 
Four other pitchers, sophomore Joey Williamson and freshmen Brett Graffy, David Phelps and Sam Elam, combined to pitch the last six innings for Notre Dame. The four combined to allow one run on one hit and struck out seven VIkings. 
Graffy (2-1) was credited with the win. 
Oeveland State scored its lone run in the fifth inning. Designated hitter Sam Clyde walked to start the inning, advanced to second on a walk by center fielder John Westra, took third on a wild pitch and scored on a groundout by shortstop Bobby Cash. 
Irish rallies in the first, second right fielder Danny Dressman was doubled up at second on a fly-out to center. In the second, first base­man Craig Cooper was thrown out trying to stretch a single into a double, and, in the third, second baseman Ross Brezovsky was dou­bled up on second after a line drive out. 
"I watch big-league games and the same things happen," Mainieri said of the baserunning errors. "Sometimes we want these kids to be perfect, but they make mistakes here and there. The important thing is they learned from it." 
Notes: 
+Mainieri was able to empty his bench late in the game, giving at bats to seniors Steve Andres and Eddie Smith, juniors Mike Dury and John Seabaugh, sophomore Orris Soriano and freshmen Eddie Mendiola and Evan Sharpley. In total, 23 Irish players saw playing time. 
"It's good to be able to get guys into the game that are practicing just as hard as the starters but don't always get a chance to play," Mainieri said. 
+Starting catcher Sean Gaston did not play Tuesday due to stom­ach discomfort. Mainieri said he did not expect the illness to keep the junior out of any more games. 
+The Irish will be in action again Friday, Saturday and Sunday at Frank Eck Stadium in a confer­ence series against Louisville. Friday's game will start at 6:05 p.m., Saturday's game will begin at 
1:05 p.m. and Sunday's first pitch will be thrown 12:05 p.m.

LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Travel, finances and home improvements are all in a high cycle but don't overspend on anything unnecessary. You can expect your household to be busy and someone is likely to call your bluff or oppose your opinions. 3 stars
