Jenkins steers course for University's future 

By MADDIE HANNA News Writer 
When University President Father John Jenkins in January questioned the pres­ence of "The Vagina Monologues" at Notre Dame, he opened the floodgates to 10 weeks of emotional accu­sations, cries of censorship and national media coverage reporting that freedom of speech could soon be cut short at the nation's most prominent Catholic universi­ty. 
But on Wednesday, Jenkins largely silenced the clamor when he released a closing statement on academic free­dom and Catholic character that surprised many faculty members -he found no rea­son to ban the "Monologues" and was determined "not to suppress speech on this cam­pus." 
"What I care about is that we understand our mission to be a truly great university, in scholarship, in teaching, 
in all aspects of our academ­ic work, that we are a Catholic university and we take that seriously, it gives us a broad moral framework, it gives us a sense of spiritu­ality in what we do," Jenkins told The Observer Wednesday. "Both of those are part of our identity at Notre Dame, and they allow us to move forward and make decisions. 
"I think if we can be true to that, and just explain that, I frankly don't worry too much about image or perceptions, as long as we're true to who we are and we state that clearly and act accordingly." 
In minimizing the impor­tance of image, Jenkins refutes what many critics have insinuated since the January addresses -that a decision to ban the "Monologues" and other con­troversial performances would be made to appease the Church and conservative alumni.

Five Saint Mary's seniors presented their senior com­prehensive projects at a soci­ological conference last week after receiving honors in a nationwide sociology paper com petition. 
Sociology majors Katie Dingeman, Stephanie Lutz, Sam Medina, Stephanie Roth and Jackie Savinon submitted their projects in the annual North Central Sociological 
Association (NCSA) student paper competition March 23 to March 25. All five papers were selected for presenta­tion in research sessions at the conference, sociology department chair Susan Alexander said. 
Presenting their papers and accompanying PowerPoint presentations alongside grad­uate students and sociology professionals, Alexander said, was a "great honor and experience."

Moms to visit SMC daughters 
Annual event brings juniors/ mothers closer. 
By EMMA DRISCOLL 
News Writer 

Memories will be made and tra­dition supported this weekend as junior students' mothers arrive in South Bend for Saint Mary's annu­al Junior Moms' Weekend. 
"[The weekend is a] really great opportunity to spend time with our moms and have some girl time," junior class president Heidi Goeppinger said. 
Activities will begin Friday with a wine and cheese reception accompanied by a silent auction. Juniors, families and businesses were asked to donate items for the silent auction, said Laura Corke, the Junior Moms Committee chair. The committee has been planning the event for about a year, she said. 
On Saturday, campus tours will be offered, as well as a free movie. Event coordinators have sched­uled appointments at Emerald Spa for many juniors and their moms. A Mass will be held later in the evening, followed by a semi-for­mal dinner downtown at the Century Center, where another silent auction will take place.

Institute president tells ho-w rich tnen can get to heaven 

By ADRIENNE RUFFNER 
News Writer 
A rich man can go to heav­en -but first, he must fol­low Christ and respect the dignity of other people, Father Robert A. Sirico said Wednesday in the Jordan Auditorium in the Mendoza College of Business.

In a lecture entitled "Can a Rich Man Go to Heaven?" Sirico spoke about economic responsibility and social jus­tice to approximately 100 students, faculty and commu­nity members. Sirico is the co-founder and president of the Acton Institute, an organ­ization whose mission is "to promote a free and virtuous society." 
The relationship between economics and society is a precarious balance, Sirico said. He emphasized that money is not "intrinsically evil" and can be used to pro­mote good. 
"The economy can be likened to a very powerful automobile," Sirico said. "It can be used as an ambulance to drive people to safety, or it can be used to drive drunk and to hurt people." 
The responsibility lies not only in the hands of the rich to lessen suffering in poverty but also in the hands of the poor to work to secure what they need, Sirico said. 
"Too often in these !eco­nomic] discussions, what we do too simplistically is to revere the poor and condemn the rich without considering personal characteristics," he said. 
Sirico said while economic justice is supremely impor­tant, there is not one particu­lar system that can unequiv­ocally provide both prosperi­ty and fairness. 
"The Church does not have its own economic model," Sirico said. "It has an insight into human dignity and into the human person.... We have to look at prudential economic proposals and see how they best respect the human person." 
He also advised current and future business leaders to be aware of how their businesses affect society.

talist [you] will be, but ask what kind of person you will be," Sirico said. 
The lecture's title comes from a passage in the Gospel in which Christ and his disci­ples discuss the rich man's ability to get into heaven. The rich man is often criti­cized in the Gospels, and in the story, Christ says a man who lives such a life of self­ish depravity may not enter heaven. 
"Everybody always remem­bers that story," Sirico said. "Jesus says the man won't get into heaven because he's rich or poor, but because he has grace." 
Before he became a priest, Sirico said he "spent several years being involved in leftist social change." Both political and spiritual conversions, he said, led him to become a 
priest  and  eventually  to

The Institute's goal is  to  

educate business leaders to form a more just society. Each year it sponsors pro­grams such as Acton University, a summer sympo­sium of classes and seminars. 
Sirico lectures at business­es and schools across the country. His writings have been published in many major newspapers and maga­zines, and he has provided commentary for television and radio programming.

Nothern Ireland receives ultimatum 
ARMAGH, Northern Ireland -The British and Irish prime ministers, Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, issued an ultimatum Thursday to Northern Ireland's divided politicians: Elect a power-sharing administration by November or your legislature will be disbanded. 
Their declaration followed 3 1/2 years of diplomacy that has failed to revive a Catholic­Protestant administration, the intended cen­terpiece of the Good Friday peace accord that both prime ministers oversaw eight years ago. A previous coalition collapsed in Oct.ober 2002 over an Irish Republican Army spying scandal. 
The end result. they said, must be a vote by members to form an administration led by the province's extremes of opinion: Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists, who represent most of the British Protestant majority, and Gerry Adams' Sinn Fein, the IRA-linked party that represents most Roman Catholics. 
Swan confirmed to have bird flu 
LONDON -Britain confirmed its first case of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird Jlu in a wild swan on Thursday, setting the stage for concerns the disease could spread across the Atlantic. 
The swan was found in the Scottish town of Cellardyke, more than 450 miles north of London. according to Scotland's chief veterinary officer, Charles Milne. Health officials said the case poses no serious risks to public health but the government began restricting poultry move­ment and implementing a 965-square-mile "wild bird risk area" around the site where the infected swan was found. 
The deadly virus has not been found in domes­tic British poultry, although an imported parrot from Suriname died in quarantine from the strain last year.

Court filing targets Bush in leak 
Authorities allege that the President authorized a breach ofintelligence infonnation 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Vice President Dick Cheney's former top aide told prose­cutors that President Bush authorized a leak of sensi­tive intelligence information about Iraq, according to court papers flled by prose­cutors in the CIA leak ease. 
The filing by Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald also describes Cheney involvement in I. Lewis Libby's communications with the press. 
There was no indication in the filing that either Bush or Cheney authorized Libby to disclose Valerie Plame's CIA identity. But it points to Cheney as one of the originators of the idea that Plame could be used to discredit her husband, Bush administration critic Joseph Wilson. 

Before his indictment, Libby testified to the grand jury investigating the CIA leak that Cheney told him to pass on prewar intelli­gence on Iraq and that it was Bush who authorized the disclosure, the court papers say. According to the documents, the authori­zation led to the July 8, 2003, conversation between Libby and New York Times reporter Judith Miller. In that meeting, Libby made reference to the fact that Wilson's wife At a congressional hearing, classified information for authorized leaks. Bush and worked for the CIA.

Two of the students received additional honors when Dingeman's paper was awarded first place in the c o rn p e ti t i o n a n d M e d i n a.'s placed third. 
Alexander said that while this is the third consecutive year Saint Mary's students have placed in the competi­tion, this year was particu­larly significant. 
"There was a national call to the United States and Canada, so the number of papers that carne in was much larger this year," she said. "Normally, the call has just gone out in this region." 
For her project, Dingeman performed an ethnomethod­ology, a sociological study that deals with the codes and conventions that under­lie everyday social interac­tions. She analyzed a group of recently resettled Liberian refugees in South Bend. 
"I specifically analyzed the strength of their community and potential integration 

patterns," she said. 
Dingernan was inspired to investigate the topic by her voluntenr and intern work at the Hefugee and Immigration Services of South Bend. She said she felt compelled to study the topic in depth because of the recent socio­logical attention to issues of immigration and the incor­poration of cul-

American socinty," she said. "However, in many ways they also taught me how to live my life as selflessly as possible, with lots of love and com passion." 
Medina approached her project by creating and dis­tributing a survey investigat­ing issues of minorities -­specifically racial, ethnic,

After she learned about the environment of other col­leges and universities and how they were approaching these issues, Medina said she thought it would be interesting to com pare those elimates to that at Saint Mary's. 
"I think that it is a very important topic because Saint Mary's is working on making the campus and community more diverse," Medina said. "Without doing studies similar to this proj­ect, there is no way the College will know how it can improve itself." 
Dingeman and Medina said they learned from their experiences and felt flat­tered by the success of their projects. 
"I think this project was a good starting point for me," Medina said. "I am so happy that I had the opportunity and the support from my professors and other stu­dents to follow through with it."

IN BRIEF 
Boston Scientific, Guidant shares rise 
BOSTON -Shares of Boston Scientific Corp. rose Thursday after the medical-device maker won antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission's staff for its $27 billion acquisition of former rival Guidant Corp., whose shares also rose. 
Shares of Boston Scientific, which announced its FTC agreement after markets closed Wednesday, rose 24 cents, or 1.1 percent, to close at $21.93 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Shares of Guidant rose $1.12, or 1.5 percent, to finish at $77.85 on the NYSE. The deal still needs final approval from the full commission and European regulators. 
Also on Wednesday, Guidant said its first­quarter sales dropped 6 percent from last year, and it expects to record more than $120 million in charges for the quarter. Guidant has suffered sliding sales because of product recalls and news that the company withheld information about the faulty devices. 
Boston Scientific said it continues to expect its acquisition of Guidant to close around the mid­dle of this month following regulatory clear­ances. 
Merck denies withheld information 
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -In his first appear­ance in a Vioxx trial, the former chief executive of Merck & Co. insisted Thursday that the com­pany was up front about the safety risks of its troubled arthritis drug during his tenure ­despite a jury verdict to the contrary. 
Raymond Gilmartin, 65, who retired last year after 11 years running the company, testified during a hearing aimed at determining whether Merck should pay punitive damages in addition to the $4.5 million it was ordered to pay a former Vioxx user stricken by a heart attack. 
Dueling over semantics and Merck's candor in the development of Vioxx, Gilmartin and plain­tiff's attorney Mark Lanier engaged in a series of contentious but civil exchanges Thursday. 
Gilmartin rejected Lanier's assertions that the company withheld safety data about Vioxx, which was taken by 20 million Americans before a 2004 study linked it to increased risks of heart attack and stroke.

Stocks suffer as oil hits $68 
Inflation concerns dominate Wall Street; jobless claims fall for third straight week 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Inflation concerns dominated Wall Street Thursday, with stocks mostly lower as crude prices marched toward $68 per barrel and jobless claims fell. Interest in small­cap and technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq compos­ite index narrowly higher, however, sending the index to its third straight five-year high. 
While the economy has so far absorbed high energy costs, fears remain that chronically high prices could spark inflation. A bar­rel of light crude settled at $67.94, up 87 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
Strength in the labor mar­ket also unnerved investors, as the Labor Department reported a third straight drop in weekly unemploy­ment claims. With the monthly jobs repor·t due Friday, Wall Street worried that more people on the nation's payrolls would mean increased demand, another potential catalyst for inflation.

However, Brannock said she eould not guarantee the compa­ny that detected the illegal file sharing would not press eharges. 
"We havn been receiving more and more violation notices from companies, as they are becoming increasingly vigilant of their copyright-protected material," Brannock said. 
This semester alone, the Ollice of Hesidence Life and Housing has met with more than 33 stu­dents who were specifically reported by external organiza­tions that witnessed them engag­ing in illegal file sharing, thus making this offense one of the most common ones among stu­denl'i. 
"Every time you download a song l'or l'ree, you're running the risk of blling watched by these companies and these musicians," Brannock said. "They really are looking out for violators of copy­right laws, and if you happen to download that one song at the wrong time, you might just get into trouble." 
The Office of Hesidence Life and Housing says it has received violation notices from outside eompanies against both students who may have downloaded more than 100 songs and movies and students who downloaded a mere handful. 
While students are aware of the practical risks of download­ing, not all consider it a serious offense. 
"My HA at the time who was basically the student of the year, head of HOTC, etcetera heard of my plight, and said something like, 'That's illegal?"' Bogacz said.

Detectives could get life in prison 
Former NYPD cops convicted of moonlighting as mob hitmen 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK-Two highly dec­orated former detectives were convicted Thursday of moonlight­ing as hitmen for the mob in one of the most sensational cases of police corruption in New York hi<>tory. 
Louis Eppolito, 57, and Steven Caracappa, 64, could get life in prison for their roles in eight murders committed between 1986 and 1990 while they were 
simultaneously on the payroll of both the NYPD and Luchese crime family underboss Anthony "Gaspipe" Casso. 
Federal prose­cutor Daniel Wenner described the case as "the bloodiest, most violent betrayal 
"There has never been, in the history of the NYPD, an officer convicted of being a hit man for the mob.'' 
Tom Reppetto author 
of the badge this city has ever seen." 
Prosecutors said the two men carried out two hits themselves ­after pulling the victims over in traffic stops -and delivered up some of the other victims to the Malia to be killed. 
Neither defendant showed any emotion during the 10 minutes it took the jury fi>rewoman to reply "proven" 70 times to the racket­eering acl<> they were accused of. The verdiet was reached after two days of deliberations. 

The defendants' $5 million bail was revoked and they were led oil' to jail to await sentencing May 
22. The men's lawyers said they will appeal. 
"It's an appearance of justice, but it's not justice," said Bruce Cutler, who once represented John Gotti and put on a thunder­ing defense for Eppolito, daiming the government's mob witnesses were lying to save their necks. 
Prosecutors said the two used 
their law enforce­ment positions to help the Mafia at a price of $4,000 per month -more if they personally handled a killing. They earned $65,000 for one of those slayings, pros­ecutors said. 
The two officers also supplied Casso with inside informa­tion on law enforce­
ment interest in the mob, prose­cutors said. Casso was said to have referred to the two men as his "crystal ball." 
They were convicted of' charges that included racketeering con­spiracy, witness tampering, wit­ness retaliation and obstruction of justice. 
"There has never been, in the history of' the NYPD, an officer convicted of being a hit man for the mob," said Tom Heppetto, co­author of "American Mafia" and "NYPD," a department history. "There's cases of police miseon­duct, but going to work for organ­ized crime? Wow." 
Caracappa, who retired in 1992, helped establish the city police department's unit fi>r Mafia murder investigations. Eppolito, the son of a Gambino 1:rime fami­ly member, was a much-praised street cop, although there were suggestions that some of his arrests resulted from tips from mobsters. 
In his autobiography, "Mafia Cop," he portrayed himsnlf as an honest cop !'rom a crooked family. 
Eppolito also played a bit part in the mob movie "GoodFellas." After retiring in 1990, he nnsue­cessfully tried his hand at Hollywood scriptwriting. 
The former detectives, who retired to homes on the same block in Las Vegas, insisted on their innocence from the time of their arrests in March 2005. But neither took the stand at their trial. 
The key prosecution witness was Burton Kaplan, a drug dna!Pr who spent lour days on the stand linking the pair to an assortment of murders. Kaplan testified that he served a'i middleman between Ca<>so and the detectives. 
Casso, known as one of the most brutal mobsters in the eity, is suspectnd of involvnmont in 36 murders himself. Both sides con­sidered calling him as a witness but ultimately decided Casso came with too much baggage.

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Perhaps it wasn't history's greatest betrayal after all, but a simple act of obedi­ence. 
Judas turned Jesus over to the high priests, not for money, but because Jesus asked him to do so, according to a newly translated ancient Coptic docunient 
The "Gospel of Judas" tells a far different tale from the four gospels in the New Testament. It portrays Judas as a favored disci­ple who was given special knowl­edge by Jesus -and turned him in at Jesus' request. 
"You will be cursed by the other generations -and you will come to rule over them," Jesus tells Judas in the document made pub­lic Thursday. 
The text, one of several ancient documents found in the Egyptian desert in 1970, was preserved and translated by a team of schol­ars. It was made public in an English translation by the National Society. 

Religious and lay readers alike will debate the meaning and truth of the manuscript. 
But it does show the diversity of beliefs in early Christianity, said Marvin Meyer, professor of Bible studies at Chapman University in Orange, Calif._ 
The text, in the Coptic lan­guage, was dated to about the year 300 and is a copy of an earli­er Greek version. 
A "Gospel of Judas" was first mentioned around A.D. 180 by Bishop Irenaeus of Lyon, in what is now France. The bishop denounced the manuscript as heresy because it differed from mainstream Christianity. The actual text had been thought lost until this discovery. 
Elaine Pagels, a professor of religion at Princeton University, said, "The people who loved, cir­culated and wrote down these gospels did not think they were heretics." 
Added Rev. Donald Senior, pres­ident of the Catholic Theological Union of Chicago: "Let a vigorous debate on the significance of this fascinating ancient text begin." 


Senior expressed doubt that the new gospel will rival the New Testament, but he allowed that opinions are likely to vary. 
Craig Evans, a professor at Acadia Divinity College in Nova Scotia, Canada, said New Testament explanations for Judas' betrayal range from money to the influence of Satan. 
"Perhaps more now can be said," he commented. The docu­ment "implies that Judas only did what Jesus wanted him to do." 
Christianity in the ancient world was much more diverse than it is now, with a number of gospels circulating in addition to the four that were finally collected into the New Testament, noted Bart Ehrman, chairman of religious studies at the University of North Carolina. 
Eventually, one point of view prevailed and the others were declared heresy, he said, includ­ing the Gnostics who believed that salvation depended on secret knowledge that Jesus imparted, particularly to Judas. 
In Cairo, the editor of the Coptic weekly "Watani," YoussefSidhom, did not want to make an immedi­ate judgment on the manuscript. 
"However," he said, "this will not greatly affect the central belief that considers Judas as a traitor, but there is an old school of thought that says one should not persecute Judas because his role was to complete the prophe­cies. It seems that the new manu­script will support this point of view -that Judas' role was piv­otal to completing the prophe­cies." 
The newly translated docu­ment's text begins: "The secret account of the revelation that Jesus spoke in conversation with Judas Iscariot." 
In a key passage Jesus tells Judas, "You will exceed all of them. For you will sacrifice the man that clothes me." 
This indicates that Judas would help liberate the spiritual self by helping Jesus get rid of his physi­cal flesh, the scholars said. 
"Step away from the others and I shall tell you the mysteries of the kingdom," Jesus says to Judas, singling him out for special status. "Look, you have been told every­thing. Lift up your eyes and look at the cloud and the light within it and the stars surrounding it. The star,that leads the way is your star. 
The text ends with Judas turn­ing Jesus over to the high priests and does not include any mention of the crucifixion or resurrection. National Geographic said the author believed that Judas Iscariot alone understood the true significance of Jesus' teachings. The author of the text is not named in the writings. 
Discovered in 1970, the papyrus was kept in a safety deposit box for several years and began to deteriorate before con­servators restored it. More than 1,000 pieces had to be reassem­bled. 
The material will be donated to the Coptic museum in Cairo, Egypt, so it can be available to all scholars said Ted Waitt of the Waitt Institute for Historical Discovery, which helped finance the restoration. 
In addition to radio carbon dat­
ing, the manuscript was also 
authenticated through ink analy­
sis, multispectral imaging, con­
tent and linguistic style and hand­
writing style, National Geographic 
reported.

This week marked a great and coura­geous day for Notre Dame's new presi­dent, Father John Jenkins. For the frrst time since the term of former Notre Dame president Theodore llesburgh, a University leader established a bal­aneed, inclusive and well-thought policy defining Notre Dame. It is a moment every friend and family member of Notre Dame should remem­ber. 
Nearly a quarter of American Christians consider themselves Catholic, but many seldom attend mass regularly. For them, the character of the Homan Catholie Chureh is laeking--per­haps not as mueh for its dogma as for the Chtireh's inability to effectively connect on an individual level. They are not eon­vineed that the message from the gospel matehes the aetions of Chureh leaders. A similar disconnect between University actions and rhetoric has certainly disen­franchised a significant portion of Notre Dame alumni for many years. 
Father Jenkins, in confronting a con­tentious issue now on campus, has set a fair policy for generations to eome. It was embarrassing to claim that Catholics, and Notre Dame specifically, adhered to the life and mission of Jesus' service to others while not even recognizing that gay students existed in the universe, let alone could meet on campus. Somehow the fear of bad publicity perpetuated a series of similarly negative impressions of Notre Dame. Jenkins is the first cam­pus leader who truly displays King Solomon's biblical sensibilities and wis­dom. 
In this era of hourly news cycles, reli­gion is ridiculed -but many times for good reason. When the spokesperson for a leading Ameriean Catholic organization appears on political cable programs to assert that a secular movement is remov­ing Christ out of Christmas, many won-

der if he is fairly representing Catholics who respect the fact that non-Christians do not recognize the holiday. The confu­sion for non-Christians is as baffiing as our lack of understanding for Muslim riots over a cartoon joke of Mohammed. Neither side attempts to bridge the divide with the other. 
Last week, a segrhent of so-called Christians met in Washington, D.C., to whine about our society's attack on Christianity. They claimed that gays are attacking marriage, secularists are attacking Christmas imd liberals are attacking values. Their cries defy the truth of the Word as they attempt to deceive goodhearted folks for personal politieal power and greed. 
The eonferenee attempted to connect how Jesus could have had a good word about war in certain circumstances, how torture should be included in CIA opera­tional manuals or how Jesus eould sup­port tax cuts for the wealthy because, after all, it is our money. Their vitriolic hate of foreigners forbids even their own followers from ministering to a wayward undocumented immigrants in this great and free {only for them) nation. While elaiming how everyone else is attacking all that is holy to them, they in turn attempt to attack their followers' wallets. 
Sadly, Catholics get swept up in this illogical reversal of the definitions of val­ues and morality. Heligion is a personal and private matter. Catholics are fortu­nate that their service is universal and is seeded in a long history dating back to Jesus. No other religion can claim to have been the frrst, although Martin Luther defied the Church with his inter­pretation of Christ's original teachings. Luther's break, and every succeeding religious element that claims to follow Jesus, regardless of how strange its pre­cepts may seem, are a matter of inter­pretation ... including the early Roman Catholic Church. 
Inasmuch as Jenkins has balanced lib­eral thought with conservative dogma at Notre Dame, he has freed everyone to officially respect others without con­frontation. No longer at Notre Dame does one need to claim to be "attacked" like the Christian conference did last week. Gone at Notre Dame is the self-righteous­ness of those who, rather than debate others, attempt to quiet and diseredit them. 

Nobody a'dvoeating equal proteetion through civil unions (marriage rights without the word "marriage") ever want­ed to force any religion to marry them. President John F. Kennedy set the stan­dard that no publidy elected American Catholic needs to answer to the Vatican, but to the constituent<> who plaeed their conlidenees in that oflidal. Nobody is foreing Christians to now celebrate Hanukkah or Kwanzaa in December. Notre Dame is saying, "Get over the us versus them mentality in favor of respect and understanding." 
Last night, a television commercial stopped me in mid sentence. People who appeared to be gay, interraeially mar­ried, old or of minority heritage sat in chureh pews but suddenly were ejected out of the screen as though in a lighter plane. The United Church of Christ (www.ucc.org) sponsored the advertise­ment that simply read, "Heligion does not exclude. Heligion includes everyone." 
President Jenkins' Closing Statement on Academic Freedom and Catholic Character proclaims that message for Notre Dame. It is a great day on campus. Seniors who arc our next generation of American Catholic leaders should take that message to heart, both in the politi­cal and spiritual aspects of their lives. While it takes effort from all of us to reach out to others, Jenkins has articu­lated a framework that is neither liberal or conservative, but one for which all of us can be proud.

LEITER TO THE EDITOR 

Jockular misleading and offensive 
We are disappointed in the Jockular comic strip run on April 6 and the fact that it was even published. We feel that the portray­al of Saint Mary's students is not only inaccurate, but insulting. Why would you approve a comic strip that indirectly destroys the relationship between the students of Saint Mary's and Notre Dame? For a newspaper that serves both schools, you present a rather slanted perspective of Saint Mary's students. 
In particular we are offended by the reference of Saint Mary's students as "parasites," as Jockular so eloquently dubbed us. The word parasite insinuates that the relationship between Saint Mary's and Notre Dame is unhealthy and harmful to Notre Dame. We do not feel this is the case because, although Saint Mary's students may make use of available opportunities, this does not prevent Notre Dame students from doing the same. In addition, Saint Mary's offers events and programs of which Notre Dame student<> may take advantage. 
It is not the actions of Saint Mary's students that hinder growth between the institutions, but the attitude articulated in this comic strip. The implication that Saint Mary's students care

more about their room size than their education is insensitive to our feelings as well as reality. Since being founded in 1844 and 1842, both Saint Mary's and Notre Dame have prided them­selves on their mutual support and collaboration as educational institutions. The students who come here expect a warm com­munity that both welcomes and supports. How can prospective students feel invited to share in this community if they are exposed only to this biased opinion? 
We propose that, instead of presenting these negative and false views of the relationship between the institutions, The Observer encourage greater community through its publica­tions. Rather than put into question the intef.,rrity of Saint Mary's students, why not question the integrity of the views portrayed 
by Jockular?

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Student Senate not ignoring MAC 
As one who served on the 2005-06 Student Senate for the University of Notre Dame, I would like to respond to statements issued in Karen Langley's Wednesday article concerning the amendment to make permanent the ad hoc Senate Committee on Minority Affairs. On Wednesday, March 29, sena­tors voted down an amendment to make permanent the Minority Affairs Committee (MAC), chaired by Rhea Boyd. 
 By no means was this a move to deny minorities on campus an avenue through which their voices can be heard more clearly. This has been a major focus throughout the course of the administra­tive year -hence the creation of the committee by former student body presi­dent Dave Baron. And many positive steps have been taken to improve upon issues at Notre Dame, thanks in part to the diligent work Rhea and her commit­tee have put in behind the scenes. 
However, at present the Senate Committee on Diversity Affairs is in exis­tence for a seemingly similar goal, as its name clearly states. Certainly it is not farfetched for the two committees to col­laborate on large-scale diversity issues, which they have on a semi-frequent basis. However, when push comes to shove, where do the two differ? The Student Union Constitution reads as fol­lows: "The Committee on Diversity Affairs shall address issues of multicul­turalism and diversity and make appro­priate recommendations to the Senate." My main concern is that these lines of text are far too vague to discern some level of distinction between Diversity Affairs and MAC, which in its current form perseveres for the same goals. 
Yes, something does need to be done. Yes, the two committees need to be dis­tinct. But, first and foremost, the line between the committees needs to be clearly drawn, and the amendment pre­sented on March 29 did not adequately do this. Diversity can be extended to many walks of life -social, economic, spiritual, sexual and of course racial, among others. MAC, naturally, should speak to racial and ethnic diversity issues, while Diversity Affairs should address issues of difference based on religion, sexual orientation, economic status and the like. Now, I do not know many of the members of the 2006-2007 
l111pact appreciated 
Concerning the Friday, March 3rd edition of The Observer, "Notre Dame bene­factors to be recognized"-I attended the weekend. It provided a wonderful opportunity for those invited to hear the experiences of several students and to hear of their appreciation of what Notre Dame and the benefactors have done for them. We all take a lasting happiness in our effort to pay back our great school in our own fashion -however small -and in the realization that we are helping to carry the image of our Lady's school out to the world th~ough the finest and brightest young people in our country. A week has gone by and the memories are vivid in my mind. 
I was able on Sunday morning to visit with two of the scholars from my endowment-both from my hometown area of Moline and Davenport. I hope to follow their progress as they go on in life. You students will also have this opportunity to pay back our school. Few things, if anything at all, can be as sat­isfying. 
Bob Eckland alumnus Class of 1957 March 10 

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Student Senate, but I do know Lizzi Shappell and Bill Andrichik. They will see to it that this issue is resolved in the proper fashion. Once this is done, MAC, I believe, will receive its permanent status in the Student Union Constitution. Until this point is reached, no other amend­ments should go through. The Constitution is not something that should be treated like a sheet of notebook paper. Amendments should be written in a fash­ion that will make them solid as a rock, thus not needing to be edited in the future. 
Lastly, I will speak to a comment made by Minority Affairs Committee member Jason Laws concerning the past senators. In Langley's article, Laws is quoted as saying, "At the meeting, I just don't know if people had their eyes open," and that "senators would have done well to con­sider the significance of MAC ... before rejecting it." Personally, I consider this a slap in the face to all who served the entire student body of Notre Dame as senators the past administrative year. Of course the experiences of the minorities on campus are important; no one is denying this. MAC has been an invalu­able asset to Student Senate, and its importance was duly noted. If its signifi­cance were not considered, do you hon­estly believe the senators would have spent over an hour discussing the amendment? This issue needs to be addressed in the clearest and best way possible to serve the needs of all minori­ties here at Notre Dame. And it certainly will be as soon as the distinction is made by those in office for the 2006-2007 administrative year. But I find these statements to be both offensive and insulting to those students who have worked tirelessly through Student Senate for the student body. 

I have the utmost confidence in the new administration to resolve this issue in a fashion that best serves all involved. It may take a week, it may take months, but it will happen. An issue this big will not go by the wayside unnoticed. And to think that student government will do otherwise is just outrageous.

The French: 111asters of protest

But as appealing as 
Michigan Daily 
"D'Aubigne, Chateaubriand, Malraux: trois repre­sentations literaires de !'insurrection" sounded, I opted to play hooky to attend the most massive, well-orchestrated and seamless expression of civil unrest I've ever seen with my own two eyes. As I watched the French in action, I got the dis­tinct impression that they had done this before. 
Unlike the few American protests I've seen, I barely detected any self-conscious forced enthusiasm. Instead, the manifesta­tion in Marseille was unreserved and unapologetic. This charivari of Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and President Jacques Chirac left many dum­mies noosed and caricatures guillotined amid a constant stream of Gallic epithets. A huge fountain was decorated with the bat­tered body of a cardboard-and-foam prime minister and dyed with his red blood. 
But it wasn't just punk kids having fun­the giant crowd included parents, grand­parents and employees of all sorts. The unions say attendance was 250,000; the police say 35,000. I estimate the crowd could've easily filled Michigan Stadium. 
But for what, exactly? Most obviously, the student movement takes aim at the CPE, or the "First Employment Contract," that was passed earlier this year. De Villepin and his right-wing allies sold it as a way to reduce unemployment among the under-26 crowd, but the Left criticized it as a signifi­cant erosion of workers' rights. De Villepin, who coincidentally is running for President next year, has taken a hard line. The CPE works, he says, and no modifications should be made. The socialists have taken an equally hard line: They will accept noth­ing less than the full retraction of the law. 

At the center of the argument is that the CPE allows employers to fire their young workers for no reason during a two-year "tryout period." From an American per­spective, it might be difficult to understand the outrage. We take for granted that we're not going to have job security. If you get fired, there's really not much you can do about it. C'est la vie. 
But in France, the protection of the worker against capitalistic exploitation has fared better than in the United States. The French have a working social democracy and are in the enviable position of having a 35-hour workweek, not to mention the generous vacation time. The CPE is seen as the first step in dismantling their beloved system . 
. The system may be on the verge of rup­ture anyway. Unemployment is high, and members of the next generation are going to be poorer than their parents. The big, happy, socialist pie is being stretched too thin, but instead of seeking reform, French students are clinging fearfully to their old ways. The turmoil in France that I'm wit­nessing right now is not just about one law hastily rushed through Parliament. The national dialogue is really about whether France is once again going be the excep­tion to the rule, or ifthe Fifth Republic will simply become another cog in the global­ized economy. 
Of course, this is also a partisan battle at heart. The left wants to undermine the power of de Villepin before the '07 elec­tions. As it stands, both sides are so obsti­nate that I seriously question whether I'll ever go back to the classes I enrolled in. In the meantime, I can only marvel at how French public transportation works better than ours even when it's on strike -and drink pastis.

Kurosawa's 'Samurai' masterpiece comes to DPAC 
By BRIAN DOXTADER Scene Editor 

Though it sounds like the stuff of hyperbole, in 1954 Akira Kurosawa made "Shichinin no samurai" ("The Snven Samurai") and cinema was 1:hanged forever. Almost unparalleled in its seope, brillianen and effectiveness, Kurosawa ehangAd the idea of what an aetion film could be while tying his epic to a solid and entertaining story. 
"Tiw Seven Samurai," as its name implies, follows s1wen Japanese warriors as tlwy defend a village from a group of bandits who have been terrorizing the pnople. Lnd by the wise Kambei (Takashi Shimural, the samur~i are comprised of Kikuehiyo (Toshiro Mifune), Gorobei (Yoshio lnaba), Kyuzo (Seiji Miyaguchi), lleihachi (Minoru Chiaki), Shichiroji (Daisuke Kato) and Katsushiro (Ko Kimura). 
Eaeh of the samurai has a distinct per­sonality, but the most notable are Kikuchiyo, whose youth and rebellious attitude drives the group, Kyuzo, the master swordsman and Katsushiro, a boy who longs to be a true samurai. 
Though set in a bygone era of samu­rais and villages, Kurosawa's acute abili­ty to weave social commentary is evident throughout "The Sevnn Samurai." What constitutes "good" versus "evil?" What makes the samurai better than the ban­dits? Kurosawa explores these issues and more over the course of the film ­there is an extraordinary scene about what it means to be a man that res­<mates despite the differences between Japanese and Western society because of Kurosawa's insight and directorial courage. 
The action scenes are justifiably famous, as Kurosawa set a new standard in how to film such sequences. The mov­ing camera, elliptical edits

Samurai" is quite long -over 200 minutes -it rarely drags thanks to its sure narrative footing and Kurosawa's filmic style. 
There is something inherently tragic about "The Seven Samurai" -despite its thrills and surprisingly fluid pace, there is something somber about the film. Its emotional impact is strong and the final scene is one of those reminders of just how great the cinema can be. Kurosawa was a visionary who saw that 
"The Hidden Fortress" (which served as the basis for George Lucas' seminal 1977 "Star Wars") and 1961's "Yojimbo" (which was remade by Sergio Leone as the Clint Eastwood spaghetti western "For a Fistful of Dollars"). 
Other classics the director has made include 1952's "Ikiru" and 1957's "Throne of Blood" -all of these films established Kurosawa as arguably Japan's finest director (although Yasujiro there was still magic in film and brought out the best in the medium, revitalizing it with power and grace. Modern film­makers have much to learn from Kurosawa's pictures -few filmmakers, before or since, have effectively tied action, social awareness and meditative introspection as well as Kurosawa.

The 2006 Opnra Notre Dame production of "Orpheus Goes to Ifell" is definitely not your grandmother's opera. Hilarious and irrnverent, this satiric romp by 19th centu­ry eomposer Jaeques Ollimbaeh pokes fun at Grnnk mythology, imperial French poli­ties and modern sodnty whiln entertaining the audienee with lively song and dance numbers. 
The opera, a yearly event sponsored by the Notre Dame Departmnnt of Music and Opera Notre Dame, will take place this weekend 7:30 p.m. both Friday and Saturday night in Washington Hall.

"Orpheus Goes to Itell" retells the classic Greek myth of the legendary singer Orpheus who pursues his wife Eurydice to Hades after she has been taken by Pluto, much to the dismay of Jupiter, king of the gods. Along the journey from Thebes to Mt. Olympus to Hades, many characters from Greek mythology show up to add their own lampoons and satiric comments during the riotous romp.

All of the performers are accompanied by the seventeen-piece Notre Dame Orchestra, which is composed of both Notre Dame students and professional musicians directed by John Apeitos, a visit­ing professor and conductor of Opera Notre Dame for the past 13 years. The group is downsized from a normal orchestra because of the size and acoustics of Washington Hall -a full orchestra would drown out the voices of the singers in the small space. In spite of its small size, the orchestra in "Orpheus" has a great influ­ence on the show, filling in as another character at times and playfully interacting with the lead singers. 
"Orpheus Goes to Hell" is a perfect opera for the college audience. Witty and fast moving, the catchy songs and lyrics com­bine with graceful choreography and fan­tastic set design to make the art form of opera enjoyable and exciting. The student players give excellent performances fitting for full-sized opera houses. Opera Notre Dame's production of "Orpheus Goes to Hell" is a wonder to see and hear.

DVD REVIEW 
'Narnia' DVDs offer choice 

NOTRE DAME'S BEST... 

BY OBSERVER PHOTO STAFF . 

By ERIN MCGINN Scene Critic 
As with all technology, DVDs have man­aged to both simplify and complicate buy­ing a movie. With the ease and flexibility of producing DVDs, there are numerous possibilities for just a single movie. Take "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," for example. Two versions -the single disc and the two-disc editions -currently exist, and a third "extended version" will be released later in the year. Which one, if any, should a fan -casual or otherwise -buy? 
"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" is about the four Pevensie children: Peter (William Moseley). Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skander Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley). After evacuat­ing London during WWII, they live with an eccentric professor in the country where Lucy discovers a wardrobe which leads to the fantastical world of Narnia. Eventually all four children enter Narnia and meet Asian (voiced by Liam Neeson), the benev­olent Lion who is the rightful ruler of Lewis' mythical land. Eventually, they engage in battle with the White Witch (Tilda Swenson), a tyrannical queen who keeps a dark pall over Narnia -it's always winter but never Christmas. 
The film is excellent, staying very true 
_ to C.S. Lewis' original work. The acting of the four children, especially Henley, is quite endearing and they are all believ­able in their roles. Neeson's Asian is a solid performance, and easily steals all of the scenes he's in. Andrew Adamson, best known for helming the two animated "Shrek" films, directed the movie very well, although he clearly suffers from "Lord of the Rings" envy. In an attempt to be npic, Adamson has inadvertently made the battle scenes too disjointed from the narrative. something that Peter Jackson achieyed far more fluidly in the "Lord of the Hings" trilogy. The single-disc version of the DVD con­tains the theatrical release -the "extra" and deleted scenes will be released only in the future extended version of the film. Its 
ture, however, is the "Discover Narnia Fun Facts," which functions much like VHl 's "Pop-Up Video" -while watching the movie, bubbles will appear with short anecdotes, production info, trivia, etc. 
The two-disc version has the same first disc as the single-disc release, plus a sec­ond disc of exclusive bonus features. There are nine features in total on the disc, ranging from 20 minutes to an hour in length. "Chronicles of a Director" is a look at Andrew Adamson and his making of the movie. "The Children's Magical Journey" contains interviews and back­ground information on the four children. "One Man's Mind" is a biography on C.S. Lewis -sadly, it is quite short and alto­gether not that informative. "Cinematic Storytellers" goes into the intense detail required to create an entire world. 
"Creating Creatures" is another fun fea­ture that further details different charac­ter designs. "Anatomy of a Scene: Melting River" breaks down the melting river scene from the middle of the movie. "Creatures of the World" is something of a sister feature to "Creating Creatures." This feature is a bit more character-ori­ented and provides background on how the creatures were detailed within the books. "Explore Narnia" and "Legends in Time" are both interactive features. This version also comes with two pieces of con­cept art and a foldout map detailing the features on the set. 
So which version of "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" should fans buy? The single-disc is recommended for casual fans who might not really care about the bonus features. The two-disc is recommended for big fans of the movie who are really interested in the making-of and background information. The truly die-hard might be best suited waiting for the extended edition, but probably can't wait that long, either. The easiest solution for Narnia addicts is to buy the two-disc now and re-gift/re-sell it later when the extended version is released.

By TIM KAISER and DAN MURPHY Sports Writers 
The Saltines used their suprmne height advantage and athleticism to knock oil' Team 501 21-11 in a hard limght game. 
At the oul'int, both teams played sloppy basketball, each going scornless in their ftrst two posses­sions. 
Needing a quick viet.ory in order to finish before a class, the Saltines dnddnd to step up their game. 
"We came out slow," said Dan Ott of the Saltin1~s. "but we had a test right al'tnr thLc;, so we wanted to finish them oil' fast." 
After falling behind 3-0, the Saltines made three straight before Team 501 was able to answer. Using il<; superior height and athleticism, the Saltines went on an 8-2 run to end the half. 
Although the score at half was lopsided in favor of the Saltines, the play rnmained competitive and heatnd on the court. \ 
There were a number of hard fouls, and a scuffle broke out at one point. The pushing and shov­ing was quickly broken up by other players and resulted in no ejections. 
In the second half, the Saltine players followed the same game plan of using their height to their advantage. They were able to force a number of turnovers, which led to six second-half fast­break poinl<; en route to the 21-11 final. 
"It was a tough draw for the first round," Team 501 guard Steve Howenstein said. "They have a lot of size and were very athletic. Those guys are going to go far." 
Charles Manson Strikes Back 
21, Jaredisjake 4 
Emerson Epartz and Ben Hoesch scon~d seven points each as Charles Manson Strikes Back slaughtered Jaredisjake in first round at Stepan Courts Thursday night. 
Jaredisjake struggled from the field, scoring only four points in the contest. The group of seniors ollicially ended their Bookstore careers with a record of 1-4. 
"We were just out here to have some fun today," said Jaredisjake guard Shane Duba, who scored one point. 
Duba said his teammates enjoyed themselves during the whole game, despite trailing throughout. 
"We aren't in very good condi­tion. We also didn't rebound, pass, or shoot well." Jaredisjake for­ward Mark Seiler said. 
With those ingredients· missing, Jaredisjake found it tough to hang with the fast-paced offense that the Manson team ran through out the game. 
Manson, made up of two fresh­man, two sophomores and a jun­ior, passed well throughout the game. All five players scored. 
Manson was able to pick up easy baskets by driving hard toward the hoop and dishing to open teammates as the Jaredisjake defense collapsed. The fancy passing worked well in sev­eral instances, but also led to many turnovers. 
Roesch said his team will have to improve its consistency before it plays No. 3 The Caged Badgers in the third round. 
"We're hoping for at least one more win until we have to play the third ranked team," Roesch said. "But who knows? We could be the next George Mason." 
Counter Ballerists Unit 21, 
MaCCCK Daddies 5 
The Counter Ballerists Unit 
advanced to the second round of 
bracket play after a big win over 
MaCCCK Daddies. The experi­
enced seniors exploited their 
advantage in both size and athleti­
cism to come away with the 21-5 
victory. 
CBU was led by Steve Colnitis, who sunk the first six baskets of the game. Colnitis finished with 11 points and four assists. 
Once it built up a sizable lead, CBU never looked back. It came up with several steals, which were easily converted to fast break buckets. 
"We just wanted to work out all the kinks in the first round. It was a good all around effort," CBU guard Dave Kuck said. 
Kuck's outside shooting proved to be a valuable weapon for CBU throughout the game. 
The slow start hurt the under­manned MaCCCK Daddies, who were gasping for air by the end of Coln.itis' hot streak. 
'They had five guys and stami­na," MaCCK Daddies guard Bill Bordogna said. After trailing 11-2 at the half, the Daddies looked for any advantage they could to try to stop the bleeding. 
"We thought the half-time ciga­rette would get us back on track, it normally calms me down a lit-

tion will present a challenge to Notre Dame. 
"The expectation is to pick up even more speed than the previous day," he said. "Each of these teams is going to be a great test for us." 
He also said the Irish have to be extremely prepared for each oppo­nent. 
"In college athletics, anything can happen on any given day," Stone said, pointing out his own team's performance last weekend in San Diego, where the Irish lin­ished fourth in the varsity eight, second in the open night and first in the second varsity eight and novice eight. 
"Some of the teams there took us lightly and we nmlly performed well. We definitely exceeded expectations," Stone said. "I know we can race rnally well if we just concentrate on doing our own thing."

Badgers beat Bears in Frozen Four, 5-2 
Associated Press 

Whether he's rolling on the ice or flying over it, Ross Carlson is dangerous as long as he's near the puck. 
Carlson scored an acrobatic goal and his diving attempt at a second earned him an assist in Wisconsin's 5-2 victory over Maine on Thursday night in the NCAA Frozen Four semifi­nals. 
Hobbie Earl had two goals and an assist, and Adam Burish and Ben Street also scored for the Badgers (29­10-3), who will play Boston College on Saturday night for the national championship. The Eagles beat North Dakota 6-5 in the first semifinal. 
After stealing the puck from Maine's Michel Leveille, Carlson skated down the left side and left his feet 'to avoid Bret Tyler, the last Maine defender. Carlson maintained control despite his momentum as he landed and fired the shot at Ben Bishop, the 6-foot­7 goalie for the Black Bears. 
"I knew I was going to cut to the middle, but I didn't know when or how," Carlson said. "The guy went flying, and I flipped the puck up, knocked it down and shot it." 
Said Bishop: "l didn't think he was going to shoot it because he had all the time in the world. When he shot it, it surprised me." 
Maine (28-12-2) had played a gritty game to that point, but the goal shook the Black Bears, who gave up a costly scoring chance minutes later. 
With 11 :44 left, Maine had an opportunity on a short­handed rush, but Wisconsin's ensuing 2-on-1 break left Earl with a sharp wrist shot he fired past Bishop for a 3-1 lead. 
"Being on that side, I know what they were going through," Burish said of the momentum swing. "It's frus­trating." 
Maine finally scored again with 8:39 remaining in the game when Josh Soares left a drop pass for Greg Moore, who found Mike Lundin across the ice for a slap shot past Brian Elliott that cut it to 3-2. 
But Wisconsin retook con­trol about a minute later. 
Bishop blocked Street's ini­tial shot from the left circle. Carlson was knocked over as he rushed the net and slid through the play, managing to push the puck toward Bishop in the process. 
"I was just spinning like a little top," Carlson said. "I accidentally hit the puck, hit the pipe." 
Undeterred, Street charged to the net and flipped the fol­low up over Bishop's out­stretched body to put Wisconsin up by two goals again. 
"I was coming in too fast, but then I kind of gathered myself and stopped, and then got some composure and buried the backhand," Street said. 
Earl made it 5-2 when he added an empty-net goal with 
1:44 to play.

Associated Press 
AUGUSTA, GA -Vijay Singh was at the top of the Masters leaderboard. No surprise there. 
Phil Mickelson was right in the mix. That's to be expected. 
Tiger Woods got off to a sluggish start at Augusta National. Sounds about right. 
Still, there were plenty of surprises on Day 1: Rocco Mediate and Arron Oberholser were Singh's closest challengers, and Ben Crenshaw -who was talking retirement a day earlier -put himself in contention with a stunning round. 
Showing no regard for the longer, tougher course, Singh put up a bogey-free, S-under 67 that gave him a one-shot lead over Mediate on Thursday. Oberholser, a Masters rookie, was anoth­er shot back. 
"I played pretty decent," Singh said. "I didn't make too many mistakes. I had a lot of chances early on and I putted very welL" 
Mickelson shot 70, part of a group three strokes off the lead that included two­time U.S. Open champion Retief Goosen. 
Lefty said it's much easier to play the Masters now that he's a past champion, having won in 2004 when he captured his flrst major title. He added the PGA Championship last year. 

"It's a different feel teeing off in this tournament knowing you've won it," Mickelson said. "I always wanted to win it so bad ... that it was harder to let my swings go, relax and enjoy the day. I feel I can do that now." 
Singh and Mediate had something in common. They wen~ the first two players to make birdies on the 11th hole, a tough test that became even harder when Augusta National decided to super-size its course to 7,445 yards -the second-longest 
IN BRIEF BC advances to Frozen Four 
title game 
MILWAUKEE -Chris Collins made North Dakota pay for its mistakes, and Boston College's unselflsh play helped the Eagles advance to the NCAA Frozen Four title game for the first time since 2001. 
Streaking in alone in the second period, Collins got a pass from team­mate Benn Ferriera and buried the puck in the back of the net to lead Boston College to a 6-5 victory over North Dakota on Thursday in the semifinals. 
"They weren't ready for that," Collins said. "To be skating out across the blue line and Benn Ferriera putting it right on my stick was pretty nice." 
Collins scored three goals and the Eagles didn't let North Dakota bully them out of the NCAA tournament like they did last season. 
Freshmen Anthony Aiello, and Brett Motherwell added goals and Cory Schneider made 36 saves. 
Mannings to face off in 
Sunday opener 
INDIANAPOLIS -The Indianapolis Colts will open the season on the road for the seventh straight year, this time against the New York Giants in what is expected to be the first NFL matchup between brothers Peyton and Eli Manning. 
"We thought that was coming, and the unfortunate thing is for the other 54 guys that are involved in the game, it'll almost be like they're not there," Colts coach Tony Dungy said Thursday. "That is unfortunate, because there are a lot of other good players on those two teams, but we pretty much know how that one is going to be promoted." 
The league released its 2006 sched­ule on Thursday, and the Sept. 10 opener at the Meadowlands is part of NBC's new Sunday night package. 
Indianapolis also is scheduled to play a Sunday night game at New England on Nov. 5 and a Monday night game at home against Cincinnati. 

in major championship his­tory behind Whistling Straits. That's where the similari· ties end. 
Singh is a three-time major champion who won the Masters in 2000. Mediate qualified for Augusta based on a sixth-place firrish at the 
U.S. Open last summer. Otherwise, he's been mired in one of the worst slumps of his career, firrishing 114th on the money list a year ago ­an improvement on his 176th-place showing in 2004. 
"I haven't been here in a while," Mediate quipped as he walked into the interview room. "Still the same, though." 
Blake ready to take on 
Gonzalez in Davis Cup 
RANCHO MIRAGE, CA-James Blake gets to go first for the United States and, if the Davis Cup quarterfi­nals against Chile go the limit, he'll also go last. 
Blake, No. 2 on the U.S. team behind Andy Roddick, will face Chile's No. 1 player, Fernando Gonzalez, on Friday in the opening singles match. Roddick will play Nicolas Massu in the second match of the day. 
The order of play was determined during Thursday's draw. 
"I think this is the flrst time I've been picked," Blake said of the open­ing assignment. "It should be fun, and hopefully I'll start us off on a good note." 
Blake said he doesn't worry much about anything but his own game, and will stick with that approach for his first match and -if the match is even and he faces Massu in the deciding match Sunday -the finale of the round.

Tea:rn to play four road contests 
Squad will travel to Syracuse, Pittsburgh for conference games 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 
The Irish will put their 
undefmtted conference reeord 
to the test this weekend as 
they travel to Syracuse and 
Pittsburgh for a pair of dou­
blehnaders. 
The Orange and the Panthers are tied for third in the Big East with an identical 7-1 record. 
Notre Dame and South Florida are the only two teams without a loss -both at 4-0 -and remain tied for first. Although it is early in the season, the match-ups may have a major impact on where each team 1mds up in the conferenee standings. 
"They are both on fire right now," Irish coach Deanna Gumpf said. "To have a good week we have to bn able to control their hitters." 
Both teams. she said, are "crushing the ball right now." 
The Orange are poised to continue their rise with two big games this Saturday. On Thursday, the team tied a program reeord by winning nine of its last I 0 games. The one loss was a 7-4 upset at the hands of St. John's in the second of two games on March 26. 
Syracuse pitcher Alexis Switenko eurrently leads the Big East with 11 home runs and has a .365 batting aver­age. She was also 2-0 on the mound last weekend, striking out 10 in an H-1 complete game win over Villanova. 
"ISwitenkol is hitting the snot out of' the ball," Gumpf said. "She can single-handed­ly change a game. and we n1wd to give her the respect that she has earned." 
The competition will not ease up on Sunday. Pittsburgh (24-13) is also rid­ing an impressive streak, with 10 wins in 11 contests. A victory over Kent State Wndnesday gave the Panthers the most wins in the school's history. 
Consistent and powerful hit­ting has lwlped the team find its way into the record books. Leading the way are leadoff' batter .Jessica Dignon (.350 BAJ and tlw powPr-hitter Lisa held at the Lakeview Golf Course in Harrisonburg. 

But the Irish will not face any teams from the NCAA Central Hegion this weekend and are therefore more focused on main­taining a low scoring average than on competing with the field at the James Madison. 
"We don't get to face any more [NCAA Central Region] teams so we can't improve our head-to­head ranking," King said after the Dr. Donnis Thompson Invitational in Hawaii March 21­22. 
Head-to-head record and 
overall team scoring average are the two criteria that are used to determine if a team is worthy of an NCAA tournament bid. 
Notre Dame will begin first round play Saturday without the benefit of a practice round. The team's flight will arrive in Harrisburg Friday evening, after the other teams have already finished their practice rounds and seen the course. 
King said that she has printed out pictures of each hole of the course and distributed them to her players, although she real­izes that her team will still be

"We just need to focus on each other and keep our­selves enthusiastic -that's all we can do," designated hitter Gessiea Hufnagle said. 
Notre Dame, currently 20­11, has also been tearing through its schedule recently. Wednesday's loss to Akron was the first since dropping a game to No. 7 Alabama on March 19. 
"We know we are a good team," Hufnagle said. "We

Gumpf said the team will get back to basics this week­end and concentrate both on getting good pitches to hit and driving runners home once they get on base. Notre Dame has left 181 runners on base so far this season, aver­aging just under six per game. 
The Syracuse games are scheduled for noon and 2

"The first round of play will essentially be our practice round," King stated. 
However, the coaeh remains confident that her players are well-prepared.

"This meet is not a  major

Among those competing is freshman Alyissa Hasan. Already a Big East qualifier in the long jump, she will be competing in that event, plus the shot-put and 100-meter hurdles. 
"Hopefully, I'll be able to set some good marks," Hasan said. ''I'm hoping for a Big East qualifying time in the 100-meter hurdles."

Sophomore Bob Kueney has already qualified for the Big East ·meet. He will compete in the 400 meters in Oxford. 
''I'm just trying to get a good seed going into the Big East championships," Kueny said. 
So far this season, Irish have 29 Big-East qualifying scores and f'ive Mideast Hegional qualifying marks. 
On the schedule next week is the four-day Mt. SAC relays starting Wednesday in Walnut, Calif. It is one of the biggest meets in the country, with dozens of high school and universities around the countries sending their top competitors. 
As of now, Irish coach Joe Piane said he has not decided who will represent the Irish. Possibilities inelude Postel for his individual events and the Irish 4 x 400-meter relay team comprised of Postel, Kueney, Jordan Powell and Austin Wechter.

Belles travel to Illinois Wesleyan 
Saint Mary's placed second at Normal, Ill. tournament last year 
By BECKI DORNER Sporrs Writer 
Fresh off a tournament and a repeat win at Capital University's Purple and White Invitational last Sunday, the Belles of the Saint Mary's golf team look for continued suc­cess at the Illinois Wesleyan University Spring Fling in Normal, Ill. this weekend. 
The Belles placed second out of 20 in last year's tourney at IWU, scoring 305 and 310 on the first and second days. respectively. They finished 14 strokes behind winner DePauw University. Sarah Gates of DePauw and Maggie Loney of Wisconsin Eau-Claire both recorded totals of 144 to share the individual title. 

This fall's MIAA League MVP Megan Mattia of Saint Mary's placed seventh individually last year, recording two five over par 77's on the 5842 yard par 72 Ironwood Golf Club course. The team will look to her for leadership as the highest plac­ing Belle returning to the tour­nament this year. The Belles wm compete this year without their number three finisher Stefanie Simmerman and sixth place finisher Julia Adams, both of whom graduated from the team last year. 
Nonetheless, many of the cur­rent Belles are very familiar with success at the Normal, Illinois course. At last year's Spring Fling, Captain Kirsten Fantom carded a final round 85 and earned fifty-second place overall, and Katie O'Brien had a top round of. 
"We have a positive outlook going into the upcoming tour­nament; we're familiar with the course and we've played well there in the past," Fantom said. 
Mattia agreed. 
"We have high expectations [for this tournament]." she said. 
The Belles will face a very talented field in Normal. DePauw will return to defend their title and is ranked No. 2 nationally in Division III by the National Golf Coaches 
. Association, and No. 3, just above Saint Mary's, in the Golfstat.com rankings. Wisconsin Eau-Claire is on the upswing as well, only recording five losses in their fall season that totaled over thirty con­tests, and Illinois Wesleyan will look to avenge their defeat by the Belles on their home course last year.

Team 265 21, We Got a Bad Draw 13 
Team 2h5 defeated We Got a

the paint and a height advan­

"I think that was our plan from the get-go -to use our !wight," Tnam 265 centor Phil Hosloniec said. "I was blessed with height and I had to usn it." 
Hosloniec dominated in the 

paint, scoring four second­
chance points in the SIH:ond 
half. 
"I know I couldn't get it done by shooting," he said. "In the paint is where I feel at home. It's my home away from horne." 
Undersized, Bad Draw kept the game close early. Joe "Mad Dogg" Schonhon· tied the game at throe on a layup thanks to his own offensive rebound. But Hosloniec continued to domi­nate the paint, and Team 265 took an 11-6 lead at the half. 
"They used thei~: height -we used our hearts," Bad Draw's Nick "Nicky Z." Zarazua said. "J:ven when we boxed out, they were able to reach over our !wads and get the rebound." 
Team 265 took a 12-6 lead after the squads switched ends and Joe "Jay Murph" Murphy hit a jumper to cut the lead to 12-7. But Hosloniec and his tnammates rattled on· a 6-3 run to take an 1 S-10 advantagn. 
Three minutes later, Bad Draw guard Jimmy "llnrbie" Bulli hit a runner and Murphy made a layup to cut the Bad Draw defieit to 1 H-13, but those were the final baskets the team would score. 
"We accept responsibility," Zarazua said. "We could have played better. We give them en~dit -tlwy were very athlet­ic." 
Hoslonine endml the game with a jumper from thn lnl't side. "We've got to play better to

post offense proved too much 
for them to handle. The 
Shootnrs took over the second 
half, showing impressive ball 
movement and securing the 
win. 
"It was a hard-fought battle," 
the Shootnrs' Peter Johnson

Bruce Flowers All-Stars 21, Moving Staircase 10 
This marathon match-up at 
McGlinn courts featured two 
teams with unique names. 
The All-Stars took their name 
from team member Thomas 
Flowers' father. Bruce, who 
played with Bill Lairnbeer on 
the 1978 Notre Dame varsity 
basketball team that reached 
the Final Four and is Notre 
Dame's career leader in person­
al fouls with 378. 
Moving Staircase took its name from an escalator mishap that caused guard Carrie Orr to spend part of her spring break in an emergency room getting stitches. 
The two teams battled back and forth in a defensive struggle that lasted for over an hour before the All-Stars came away with a victory. The All-Stars used their height advantage and post presence to pull away at the end. 
"We gave it a great effort," Orr said of her team's perform­ance. 
The All-Stars were happy to come away with a win after the grueling contest. 
"It was a tough battle, but sheer determination brought us to vie tory," All-Star guard Kevin .Johnson said. 
The All-Stars also had a mes­sage for their next opponent. 
"Insurance Waivers better watch their back," they said in a statement after the game. 
Globo Gym Purple Cobras 21, Drop It Like It's Hoff 0 
Drop it Like its Hoff arrived at the Bookstore courts confident Thursday night. Dressed in matching team jerseys, it taunt­ed Globo Gym from across the court during the Purple Cobras warm-up. 
Unfortunately for Hoff, Globo Gym let its playing do the talk­ing, en route to a 21-0 victory. 
The game started out with both teams missing their first four shots before the Purple 
Cobras were finally able to find their mark. Globo Gym used its height and athleticism to make an 11-0 run before half time. 
Hoff's defense, which consist­ed of yelling "Nooni:m!" at ran­dom intervals in addition to kieking and punehing the other team, could not slow down Globo Gym's offense. 
"We knew we were in for a battle when the abuse started," Purple Cobras forward Ben Kaplan said. 
Going into the game, that's what team llofl" wanted to do. 
"All I got is defense," Hoff guard Julie, who asked that her last name remain anonymous, said. "I (am not good] at offense, so I got to play tough defense." 
In the second half, it was more of the same, as Globo Gym could not be stopped. It used a series of breakaway lay-ups to increase its lead to 17-0 just minutes into the half. 
After a few more shots by Hoff missed their mark, Globo Gym went on a quiek 4-0 run to dose out the game. 
"It was a learning experi­ence," HolT forward Jim Riley said. "I just couldn't hit any­thing today. I think I spend too much time benching in Holfs. We'll be back next year though."

Although the Irish are ranked higher than the Mustangs, no one is looking past the match. 
"It looks like they're peaking at the right time," Bayliss said. "They're very well coached, they play great doubles -they always have." 
The singles players at SMU are also lirmidable. 
"They've been around the block." Bayliss said. "They have a couple of Swedish players that have big serves and really big forehands. We just got a littli~ bit overpowered last year so we'rn ready for that. We'll expect a very close match." 

Notre Dame last played in Texas March 25 and 26, losing a 6-1 match at Texas and a 5-1 decision at Texas A&M. 
Before the road trip, the Irish had played in the finals of the Blue-Gray National Classic, los­ing 4-2 to Virginia Commonwealth University to take first runner-up in the tour­nament and ending an 11-match winning streak. 
The two-week hiatus was unusual for the team, which has played multiple matches most weeks since the season started. 
However, the time off was good for resting up and regain­ing long-term focus.

"Doubles has really best one of our strengths [all season]," junior Catrina Thompson said. "We are hoping it'll take us far as we finish out the season at the Big East [Tournament) and the NCAA [Tournament]." 
In singles, the Irish found wins in the middle of their lineup to capture the victory early-on. 
The most impressive win came from Buck, who upset No. 24 Alexis Prousis 6-3, 6-3 at No. 3. Her win was followed by Tefft at No. 4 over Jamie Peisel 6-3, 6-1. Tefft now holds a 14-4 record in duals match­es. The final win came from Stastny at No. 5 who downed

"It was definitely a hard fought win," Tefft said. "We are hoping that we can take the momentum [from this win] to close out the season." 
Although Notre Dame has demonstrated their full poten­tial this season, the Irish will encounter a DePaul program that has made an impressive debut in the Big East Conference this season. The Blue Demons are coming off a 4-3 victory over Syracuse last Saturday.

and junior righty Jeff Manship pitching Sunday. 
"If we play our game ­pitch as well as we can and play good defense -do the things that we do, then I think we can compete with South Florida and have some good results this weekend," Mainieri said. 
South Florida head coach Eddie Cardieri said he expect· ed his pitchers to rise to the occasion against the Irish starters. 
"If our guys pitch as we can, I think we'm looking at three rnaI good pitching mateh ups," he said in a l!dephonn inter· view with The Observer Thursday. "I shudder when I look at the numbers 

South Florida right-hander Casey Hudspeth squares off against Samardzija in the opener at 7 p.m. Friday. Hudspeth is 3-3 in eight appearances with a 3.99 ERA this season. He has 57 strike­outs in 49.2 innings while holding opposing hitters to a .250 batting average. 
"lie's got a good arm and a good curve ball," Mainieri said. "We've got a great chal­lenge against him." 
Samardzija enters the week­end with a 3-1 record and a 
3.16 EHA in six starts. 
Notre Dame (19-8, S-1 Big East) topped Ball State 6-4 Wednesday to extend its win· ning streak to nine. Irish sec­ond baseman Russ Brezovsky hit a two-run homer in the seventh to give Notre Dame the lead for good. 
After winning just four of their first 13 games, the Bulls went 10-3 to climb to 14-12 on the season before facing Florida March 20. USF lost 6­5 in Gainesville, Fla., and then was swept by Cincinnati the next weekend. With an 11-0 loss to Central Florida Wednesday, the Bulls extend­ed their losing streak to five. 
"We just kind of hit the skids a little bit, ran into some tough luck," Cardieri said. "We just hope that we can turn it around." 
Despite South Florida's recent troubles, Mainieri said he is not taking the Bulls lightly. 
"We're not really -concerning ourselves that much with how South Florida is playing," he said. "We need to be clicking on all cylinders. This will be 
as challenging a  series as we  
have all year."  
Notre  Dame  outfielder  

Danny Dressman leads the Irish attack at the plate with a .483 batting average and .481 slugging percentage. Mainieri said Dressman began the sea· son as Notre Dame's No. 4 or No. 5 outfielder, but acknowl­edged that Dressman "keeps forcing me to play him with how well he's been playing." 
First baseman Craig Cooper will most likely bat first for Notre Dame in all three games. He has reached base to lead off the first in 14 of his 18 starts in the No. 1 hole. 
South Florida sophomore righty Daniel Thomas will start game two against Thornton. Thomas is only 1-3 on the season but owns a 3. 77 ERA. Thornton is 4-1 in six

3.83 ERA. 

Manship enters as Notre Dame's top starter on the sea­son with a 2.12 ERA. He has batting average.

"We just knew we eould push the ball," Tyler Martin of Hule No. 76 said. "Coming in

"We lost last year at SMU so we're just looking to take it one match at a time and win out the rest of the season," Irish senior captain Patrick Buchanan said. 
Southern Methodist has been a close match for Notre Dame in the past. 
"The tradition in this series ­we've lost at SMU and beaten them here," Notre Danie coach Bobby Bayliss said. "The matches have all been good. Two years ago we beat them here but we won every three­set match and I think that's what it's going to take this year."

The No. 8 Notre Dame men will take their highest ranking of the year to Indianapolis to face off against Butler in the Great Western Lacrosse League opener for both teams. 
The Bulldogs (3-6) have struggled, but they host the Irish earrying their strongest momentum of the season after two straight 8-7 wins against Robert Morris and Bellarmine. 
Butler's defense has improved after allowing 20 goals against No. 12 Duke Feb. 18 and 16 goals against No. 14 Towson March 15. The Bulldogs limited No. 6 Princeton to nine goals and No. 16 Delaware to seven goals in two closely contested losses, winning two straight for the first time this year. 
"When we watch film on them they look very good," Irish midfielder Drew Peters said. "Both offensively and defensively, they're a solid team. We want to get this win to get a jump start going into league play." 
The Irish are 12-1 all-time against Butler and 11-1 in GWLL openers. Overall, Notre Dame is 44-7 in 12 GWLL sea­sons, including nine league titles.
