Final seige on Saigon planned 
SAIGON I UPI l -Viet Cong and North Vietnamese officials have ordered their forces into position for a siege and final <~ttack on Saigon, although they would prefer a political victory. 
This was the conclusion of military and political analysts WPdnesday after two Commu­nist divisions moved toward Saigon from oppos1te directions, capturing a district capital, swt•Ppmg into one provincial capital and attacking another. 
Pro-Communist diplomats had warned only a week ago that if l'n•sident Nguyen Van Thieu wPre not pushed out of office. thP \'iet Cong and North \'il'tnamt•se would attack Sai­gon. 
WPdm•sday's battlefield deve­lopmt•nts ap'parently confirmed thP diplomatic predictions.

Israeli Foreign Minister Yigal Allon will go to Washington next wpek for talks with Sl'cretary of State Henry A. Kissinger on the deadlocked !\Iiddle East crisis at Kissin­gpr's request. the Israeli government announced Wednes­dav. 
i'he announcement in Jerusa­lem coincided with a report in thl' Bl'irut newspaper An :\nwar that Palestine Libera­tion Organization chairman Yasser Arafat will meet in Algiers later this week with !'resident Giscard d'Estaing of France. which has sided with thl' Arabs. 
Bl'irut reports also hinted the I'LO may change its mind and go to (;l'nl'va for the Middle East pPace conference despite rPpeatPd statements that it would not do so until it was grantPd more political conces­sions from the United Nations. 
:\o datP was announced for 
thP Allon trip. which comes in 
thP midst of a U.S. reassess­

following the collapse of the 
K1ssingt•r's efforts toward a 
spcond stage troop disengage­
mPnt agreement betwPen Israel 
and Egypt. 
An Israeli foreign ministry 
spokesman. in announcing the 
forthcoming visit. gave no 
indication of when Kissinger 
n•quested Allon's appearance. 
But Kissinger met in Washing· 
ton for !lO minutes Tuesday with 
IsraPli Ambassador Simha Di 
nitz. 
A government source said no demand was made during the mt•eting that Israel send alon~ with Allon new ideas for c-,n interim accord based on a second Israeli withdrawal m the Sinai desert. 
Kissinger's efforts broke down l\1arch 22 following 15 days of shuttling between Egypt and Israel. The failure resulted in strained relations lwtween the United States and Israel. including a brake on further wPapons shiprrents. 
"The Israelis look ·1pon this as !hP first signs of Jiplomatic movement since the breakdown of the Kissinger mission and l'Ven the beginning of the t>asing of < ll.S.-Israeli l ten­sion... a governmmt official said of Allon's trip.

Women face problem of violence 
Editor's note: Co-education has broughllo Nolre Dame for the 
first time the problem of securing the safely of women students. 
What began as a system of Detex cards in residence halls doort: 
m us I now expand to meet the problems of violent criminal assap.ll 
and even rape against women on campus. \ 
In 1his special feature The Observer investigates the problem posed by such criminal acts perpetrated against women students by persons in and out of the University community. 
This feature includes an examination of the six accounts of violent assaull reported to the office of the Dean of Students since last August, as well as the extent and impact of other sexual of­fenses. 
II explores the efforts made by students, in conjunction with administrators, to make women students aware of ways to prevent assault and rape. 
This series also deals with the procedure followed by the University in handling the rape victim. 
The purpose of this special feature is not to scare, but to inform. By being bel ter informed of the problems of women's safely on this campus, all students, men and women, can be beller prepared to solve 1hese problems. 
This special feature was prepared by Observer staff membe!'s Terry Keeney, Ann McCarry, Ken Girouard, Val Zurblis, Kathy Mills. Katie Kerwin, Zenon Bidzinski, Chris Smith and AI Hulherlord.

LaFortune Renovation 
lll'ar Editor: 
I have bet>n observing the 
progn•ss of the LaFortune Student 
t · .. ntt·r renovation for a couple of 
"<'l'b now. and I cannot believe 
thl' trPmt·ndous amount of money 
IH"Itlg w;tsted on unnecessary 
1t1•ms. and thrown away due to 
t•xtn·ml'ly poor planning. The 
rndirl't'l lighting that was installed 
prol'ides t•xtrt-mely poor light for 
n•ading. and gives the main floor a 
duskv look. Besides wasting 
monev due to the increased energy 
nt•t·ded to operate incandescent 
lighting. the alcoves serve as a big 
trashcan posing a fire hazard. All 
the• doors on the first floor were 
nin•ly painted and then shortly 
afterwards. :l of them were 
rc•moved because it was decided 
that they were not needed. This 
was. of course. after they had 
blown the money painting them. 
Pt'rhaps the biggest waste of 
money came when after labeling 
the door to the Tom Dooley room 
as tht• info center. the door was 
remon·d 1freshly painted l. and the 
space was filled in. It will now 
have to he repainted along with the 
ridiculous sign mferring that the 
v. all has the info. Another door was ~·utout of tht• wall 4 feet awav. I If l'OUrse this Sl'l'lion had be(>n In•shly paintt>d also. 
In thPir attempt to make rhangPs 1a common platform lhPmt· last yt>arJ. tht' organizers >l't'ml'd more 1ntPnt rn changing 
l.a Fortunl' whethl'r it was good or not ThP monPv wasted on the lighting and th<: ripping out of doors l'ould ha\'l' Pasily been spent on nl'w rarpets 1which an• sorely m·e•dt•d 1at a considerablt• savings. 
:\lavlw rn tht• futurl' the com­rnrttPt's organizing changes should ~11 hack for a ft•w sPeonds and ask th<'msPln•s what in tht• ht•ll is \\ rong 11 1th the way it is.

BPing Sm10rs and just having 'oted 111 thl' SPn10r Class Fellow Eh•<·tion. 1! has come to our at­tention that we have been taken to tht• dt•aners. \\'ith a whopping total of 12 pt•reent of the Senior t 'lass vote 1:lJ perl'ent of those ,·oting '· Ara Parseghian is making

Although we harbor no ill feelings for Ara. the svsll'm bv which he was elected siinks. If thl'rt' existed a run-off thl' majority would not be tlissatisfiPd. as they are now. How long will the tyranny of the minoritv bt' allowt•d to last? The St>nior ·Class Officers obviously don't know how to run an election. Since the purpose of every election 1s to attain a majority opinion. this ont' has clearly failed.

Graver's Satire 
llt·ar Editor: 
A tip of the conical hat is due Mr. Fred Graver for his recent superb satire on the English language. With little or no effort. he dt>monstrated that. when misused. the language is incapable of eommunicating any intelligible m(•ssage. Even the most am­hitious and well-intending writer is at limPs unequal to tht• language and often must resort I as was beautifully illustrated 1 to a seemingly inexhausitlbe format of diche and general tedium. My congratulalions. sir.

'Secret deals' non-existent: Ford 
lh HICII:\Hil E. LEHJ\;I<:H 
WASHINGTON !UPI> President Ford assured Con­grl'ssm<>n Wednesday that no ··private agreements" exist hetw<>en the United States and South Vietnam. Rep. John Anderson. H-Ill .. said after a conference with Ford. 
Anderson's sum mary ap­pt•ared to sharpen the White llousl' response to Sen. Henry 1\1 .Jackson's charge that the l'nited Stall's entered into "sPlTl'l agreements" with Sai­gon m an apparent effort to indun• it to sign the Paris pean• accords. 
In the first White House rPsponse to that charge. press s<>lTetarv Hon Nessen disclosed l'arlier 'wednesday that Presi­d!•nt Hichard l\1. Nixon had confidentially promised Saigon the l'nited States would "react 1igorously" to any major ('ommunist violations of the p!'<H'P accords. 
But \pssen stressed these confidl•ntial assurances merely rdlected public l'-S. polily. olkn stated by Nixon. 
On Capitol llill. Jackson l'alled the White House explana­t1on "obviously not satisfac­torv... liP demanded disclosure of ·..the specific language of the communications" between 
Shortly after Nessen's news conference. I<'ord conferred with a group of congressional leaders. including Anderson. 
"We were assured that there are no private, off-the-record assurances on the part of this government to the government of South Vietnam" regarding the 1973 Paris accords. Ander­~on told reporters. 
In response to questions, Anderson said Ford had as­sured the group "there are no private agreements" with Sai­gon, and "no hidden chapters n•t to be revealed." He said ~·ord assured the congressmen specifically that there was no commitment for l' S. military intervention under any circum­
st<~nces. 
"There an· no secret. as vet undisclosed agreements be­tween this government and the government of South Vietnam that would in any way require or obligate us to make a military n•sponse to the inva­~ion hv North Vietnam." ,\ndPrsori said. 
\essen said the "confidential exchanges" between Nixon and l'n•sident :'l<guyen Van Thieu ­who was balking at signing the accords merely reflected known l' .S. policy commit­nwnts. 
.. Assurances to the Republic 
inclination nor the authority'' to intervene militarily. 
Ht• said the National Security Council briefed Ford on all Nixon's private assurances to Thieu a day or so after Ford assumPd office in August. 
~l·ssen said he had read :\ixon·s confidential communi­l'ations on the matter and found that "the words are different hut the end result was the same as in public statements." 
In ~upport of this position. the White House released a series of :\ixon's statements dating from the time the Paris accord~ were signed in Janua­rv. 197:!. m 11·hich Nixon said v'iolations of the accords by the ('ommunists "would call for appropriate vigorous reac­tions .. 
In a !\lay. !973. foreign policv rl'port. ~ixon said: "We have told. Hanoi. privately and publicly. that we will not tolerate ,·iolations of the agreement." 
Controversy over the nature of the agreements stems in part from the fact that Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger has .-aid the Paris accords involved no secret agreements. Kissing­Pr also said Saturday the lnited States had a "moral obligation" but no "no legal commitment" to continue aid to South Vietnam.

assistance and U.S. enforce­ment of the Paris agreement were stately clearly and public­lv bv President Nixon." Nessen s"aid.· 
H<> said there were confiden­tial communications between !';ixon and Thieu at a time in late 1972 and earlv 1973 when Thieu was balking. But he maintained Nixon publicly stat­<>d many times the same assurances he gave Thieu. 
"The publicly stated policy and intention of the United States government to continue to provide adequate economic and miltary assistance and to react vigorously to major 1·iolations of the Paris agree­m<>nts reflected confidential l'Xchanges between the Nixon administration and President Thieu at the tim<'." Nessen said. 
liP declinPd to say whether :\ ixon 's original concept of 1igorous rt>aclion might have included renewed l".S. military intervention or bombing. 
lie said. however. the August. 197a. congressional ban on further l" S. militarv involve­ment in Indochina ···of course ruled out thl' possibility of Anwrican militarv reaction to \·iolations ol thl' agreement."
