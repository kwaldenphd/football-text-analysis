University President Fr. Theo­dore M. Hesburgh fielded ques­tions last night at a meeting of the Faculty Senate, two hours after his annual address to the facutly in Washington Hall. 
The bulk of Hesburgh's remarks 
on administration and faculty af­
fairs were "offthe record" he said, 
because of the "need to be frank" 
with the faculty representatives. 
Hesburgh said he would be willing 
to discuss the issues with the media 
at a future date. 
Among the topics discussed in the initial section of the meeting were the role and structure of the Budget Priorities Committee, fac­ulty retirement age and teaching loads. 
In response to questions on faculty salaries, Hesburgh stressed the University's commitment to bringing Notre Dame salaries up to the level of salaries at peer institutions. "We are determined to equal them,'' Hesburgh said. "The Trustees realize that we can't be one of the leading universities without paying the salaries they pay." 
Hesburgh also welcomed input from the Senate Committee on Administration on qualities and considerations required by the role of provost. The Committee will 'submit its suggestions to a Provost Search Committee that will be appointed by the Academic Council next week. 
'Faculty exemplify values' 
Hesburgh responded openly to questions from senators on the Values Seminar and the role of the faculty in "teaching" values. 
"No one has ever found out how to teach values," the University president noted. "We hope our faculty will exemplify the kinds of people we hope our young people 
will become." 
Hesburgh said that definite plans to require the currently-elec­tive Senior Values Seminar have not been made, but the proposal passed the Academic Council last year by one vote. "I don't believ; 
in one-vote margins," he said. 
Hesbur~h added, "We'll go back 

President Carter appointed Fr. Hesburgh to serve as ambas­sador to the 1979 United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development [UNCSTD] last Friday. 
Hesburgh speaks frankly at Faculty Senate meeting 
to the drawing board, start over 
and do it right. We have to find a 
viable way to get leadership." He 
said he hopes to get enough money 
for a five-year training program, 
under which 25 professors would 
volunteer each summer to work 
with professionals in developing 
case . histories and readings for 
semtnar discussions. 
The University would need $1 
million to cover the faculty mem­
bers' summer salaries, Hesburgh 
estimated, "but at the end of the 
five years we would have 125 
faculty members prepared to con­
duct these seminars." 
Hesburgh said the cases would fall into three categories for discus­sion: personal values, professional value, and global problems. The cases would be ''very good, prac­tical, obviously contemporaneous" situations, he explained. "We want our students to confront the kinds of problems the guys in Watergate said they were never confronted with." 
Hesburgh noted the increasing 
interest in higher education in the 
transmission of values as well as 
learning. "If we can learn how to 
do it here," he said, "it will catch 
on all over." The University 
president stated that there is 
nothing exclusively Catholic about 
the aims of the values seminars. 
"What we'll be dealing with are 
fundamental virtues," he ex­
plained, "and we'll b~ trying to 
elicit them from the youngsters 
themselves." 
Hesburgh's appearance before the Faculty Senate was partly in recognition of the tenth anniver­sary of the Senate's existence. "Iwas in favor of the Senate ten

The Right to Life Committee will receive student government funds this year for the first year as a result of the Student Government Board of Commissioner's decision "to finally take a stand." The board allocated $500 for the com­mittee at the student government 
budget hearings Oct. 2. 

According to Student Body Presi­dent Dave Bender, the decision made by the Board of Commis­sioners was "kind of like the one made for slavery in political terms. Someone finally had to make a decision." Noting that the vote from the board was unanimous, he said "We thought, being a Catholic school, we would stand up for 
Christian principle.'' 
Bender called the action a "question of principle to stand up for, not a political que.stion to answer. The right to dectde what these principles are, he. a~~~d, is included in the responstblltttes of 
the student body president. 
He explained that what is right may not always be what the students want. "The way I envision leadership is to transcentd some of the rhetoric to decide what is right,'' he said. 
J.P. Russell, chairman of the Hall President's Council and board member, pointed out that six of the eight board members were elected to represent the students. "We all received the mandate to use our best judgment in day-to-day sit­uations. It's part of what leader­ship is all about," he explained. 
"I'm pleased as punch that we have the guts to decide in favor of what might prove an unpopular decision," he added 
Russell explained that although Right to Life did not apply for funds last year they did in 1975 and were turned down. Russell attributes the change in attitude to the change of leaders in the past few years.

Chairman added that ''in the past the campaign was a real rush job. Each hall would find gimmicks to raise money, such as football lotteries, bake sales or ugly men contests. Sometimes, these gim­micks ran for weeks." Last year's contribution averaged $.33 per 
student. 
Russell said that the overall goal of the drive is "100 percent participation of all the campus students. "We are placing more emphasis on everyone contribution a dollar or more rather than trying to reach a fixed monetary amount." He added that this year the campaign wiii run in every hall for one week.

Mexican jail 

run by prisoners 
GUADALAJARA, Mexico [AP] ­Rioting among prisoners at the Jalisco state penitentiary kiiied at least 17 inmates yesterday and more than 2,000 convicts later took control of the institution. 
Deputy Warden Jose Luiz AI­manzor said the violence erupted at about 9 a.m. when two bands of convicts seeking to control drug traffic within the prison began fighting one another. Inmates told reporters the clash was sparked by terrorists who broke out of their i so Iat ion cellblock. 
At least eight persons were injured, including two guards, authorities said. The 17 dead inmates were reported stabbed or beaten to death. 
All guards were removed from the prison towers and interior by mid-afternoon, authorities said, and several thousand inmates roamed freely within the cellblocks and the central recreation plaza. Newsmen said the inmates were quiet but in control of the institu­tion. 
Almanzor had said earlier that state police managed to control the rioting within l 1/1 hours after it had begun. 
The prison in Guadalajara, 345 miles west of Mexico City, has 2,300 inmates including 17 Ameri­cans being held on smuggling or drug related charges. None of the Americans were reported injured. One American inmate who asked not to be identified told a reporter he spent the morning carrying dead and wounded from the prison yard to the administrative offices. He

Observer this week. "I'm looking forward to a good competitive spirit among the halls as we all work towards this charitable cause," Russell stated. Additionally, green shamrock pins wiii be given to those students who give at least a dollar. Russell said that the purpose of the graph and the pins is to make people aware of the drive and ''letting them make a personal statement that they care about the the city." "It is hard to believe that every student on this campus can't give at least a dollar to this organization considering where the funding goes," noted Brother Joe Mc­Taggart, of Campus Ministry. 


CDC sponsors career workshop 
St. Mary's Career Development 
Center (CDC) is sponsoring a 
program designed to aid students 
in decision-making. 
A series of eight workshops will 
cover the basic elements of deci­
sion-making as well as technical 
aspects of career search. 
The workshops are open to all St. 
Mary's and Notre Dame students, 
who can sign up by visiting a CDC 
session. The first meetings wiii be 
held today in the Student Affairs 
Conference Room. This week's list 
of workshops is listed below: 
--.Today, from 3 to 5 p.m. 
"Interview Skills," in the Student 
Affairs Conference Room. 
--Wednesday, from 3 to 5 p.m. 
"Assertive Training," in the Sta­
pleton Conference Room. 
--Thursday, from 3 to 5 p.m. 
"Work Values," in the Executive 
Board Room. 

"Every student who works at Volunteer Services or one of these other organizations wiii benefit from money from this drive." 
Among the 34 service agencies that benefit from the United Way are: Catholic Social Service, Alco­holism Council, cancer Society, American Red Cross, Urban League, Boy Scouts, YWCA and the YMCA. "We have to see ourselves as part os the city of Sout Bend," McTaggart commented. "And this is' for the city. We are not temporary residents at Notre Dame for four years: we are 
permanent residents of South Bend." 
Russell said that he and McTag­gart did not have enought time to organize a drive to encompass off-campus, law and graduate stu­dents. However, he said that they might set up a booth in either the LaFortune lobby or the Huddle in the next week where these students could contribute. "Although all of us are part of this area the off-campus people are even more part of it, and they benefit more because of the United Fund,'' Rus­
sell added. 
raises to non-academic employees as reasons. Faculty salaries will continue to increase, he added. , 
"This is a firm decision on our part," Hesburgh said. "Despite our budget deficit we will still be able to make jumps in faculty salaries as we have in the past two years." 
The Campaign for Notre Dame is "going very well," according to Hesburgh. He thanked James Frick, vice-presicient of Public Re­lations and Development say­ing,"This thing's been planned so well you'df think he had a crystal ball." 
Hesburgh said pledges to set up 
professorships ha~e been going 
especially well. He noted that 
pledges for athletic facilities have 
been the highest, even though this 
area bas been "downplayed" in 
the campaign. 
Fr. Charles Sheedy, professor of theology, is one member of an experimental Office of Academic Ombudsman, Hesburgh announ­ced. Hesburgh recently set up the Office to "introduce informality and flexibility'' into the relation­ship between the faculty and the administration. 
The Ombudsman, Hesburgh said, will act as sort of a "marriage counselor'' in settling differences between administration and faculty members. Hesburgh said be hopes to add two more members to be new office, an experiment which Hesburgh will review at the end of the year. 
Hesburgh also thanks former Provost Fr. James Burtchaell for his ''brilliant and marvelous lead­ership these last seven years." Hesburgh reviewed the procedure to select a new provost with the , faculty and staff members. He said he hoped to have a nomination for the position ready for the spring meeting of the Board of Trustees. 
Fr. Ferdinand Brown, acting 
Provost, introduced Hesburgh and 
led an opening prayer.

Irish women win nobel for peace movement 
OSLO, Norway [API -Two women who started a peace move­ment in Northern Ireland and a London-based organization that works for political prisoners won Nobel peace prizes yesterday. 
The Nobel committee of the Norwegian parliament awarded the 1977 prize to the London organiza­tion, Amnesty International, for 16 years of effort on behalf of "pri­soners of conscience" and against torture and the death penalty. 
It gave the 1976 prize to. Betty Williams, 33, and Mairead Corri­gan, 32, for organizing a broad­based "Peace People's" move­ment to end eight years of fighting in their homeland between Protes­tant and Catholic extremists. 
The women launched the cam­paign more than six months after the Feb. 1 deadline for peace prize nominations last year, when all SO candidates were rejected and nc awar<i was given. Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov won it in 1975. 
Mrs. Williams said in London: "We've only been going 14 months and other people have been going for years. But I know how hard we worked and perhaps after all we have earned it." 
Miss Corrigan, moved to tears by the news, said in Belfast: "I accept the prize on behalf of everyone throughout the world who works and longs for peace and the many people who have suffered and have been jailed in the interests of promoting peace." 
The prizes are worth $141,600 to Mrs. Williams and Miss Corrigan and $145,000 to Amnesty Interna­tional. 
Amnesty was the lOth organiza­tion to win the peace prize. In selecting it over 53 other candi­dates, the Nobel committee called 1977 "the year dedicated to prison­ers of conscience." 
The organization , it said, "has given practical, humanitarian and unpartial support to people im­prisoned because of theii racial, religious or political beliefs." 
~~nesty was founded in 1961 b~ Bnttsh attorney Peter Benenson. Sean MacBride of Ireland, a former peace prize winner, once served 85 its chairman. It claims to be the largest human rights organization in the world with about 100,000 members in 78 countries, a budget of $1.5 million and a file of 4,000 current cases. 
The organization attempts to win freedom for political prisoners through publicity and lobbying, sends them comforts and letters, cares for their families, and hires lawyers and keeps watch on their court cases. 
An Amnesty International spokesman said: "We are de­lighted to win the Nobel peace prize. We knew our name had been put forward but we had no inkling that we would win." 
The Nobel committee cited the Ulster women's "initiative to end the violence which has marked the unfortunate disintegration in 
Groundskeepers seek support 
[continued from pagell 
The groundskeepers work from 8 
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. with a half hour break in the morning as well as in the afternoon. 
Tomorrow's 10 a.m. public hear­ing at the County-City Building will provide the groundskeepers a chance to get the University's side of the issue. Notre Dame will be represented by "one of the best management law firms in the Midwest,'' according to Fred Towe, an Indianapolis lawyer re­presenting the groundskeepers. The Chicago law firm, Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather & Geraldson, will "attempt to present docu­ments," Towe said, "that will prove the University has had this process in the works for months." 
Towe will file an unfair labor practice charge against Notre Dame. He will then attempt to prove there was no economic justification in the University's decision to contract Cromwell Man­agement. Towe also will advance arguments showing that the deci­sion made was on the spur of the moment. 
Towe's goal will be to stop Notre Dame's attempt to finalize its decision concerning the Nov. 1 date. Indianapolis newspapers and televisions have been alerted by

So widespread was the sentiment in Norway for honoring them last year that Norwegian newspapers raised $325,000 and gave it to them as a "People's Peace Prize." They used the money for a trust fund to create jobs, care for orphans and repair the devastation in mster. 
In a recent interview, Mrs. Williams said the peace campaign had passed "out of the limelight" and became a "grass roots" effort by more then 100 peace groups. 
"Because of the Peace People, there are Protestant and Catholics who are talking to each other for the first time in 10 years, if not longer," she said. "The level of violence has· dropped sharply. I'm not saying it's all our doing, but I'm sure we were a big factor."

ND/SMC Theatre 
·TH·E COMEDY OF ERRORS 


Kate Smelser 

The ND-SMC speech and drama depart­ment has set for itself a difficult task in undertaking Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors. The task is difficult because the play, one of Shakespeare's earliest, served a.s a testing ground for the young playwright's immature skills and, under­standably, lacks the absolute control of language and profound character studies present in his great dramas. Instead of battling these flaws, however, the ND­SMC company chose to exploit them in a production which earned a standing ova­tion from Saturday night's audience. 
Shakespeare's plot is an elaboration on the already complicated Menaecbml by Plautus. In the opening scene, Aegeon, an ancient merchant from Syracuse, sum­marizes for the rest of the cast the story so far. A shipwreck many years before has separated him and his wife and two sets of twins: their twin sons, ilnd their sons' twin servants. Each parent 'has been rescued with one son and one servant, but have never reunited. Eighteen years after the wreck, the son and servant with whom Aegeon was saved, Antipholus and Dromio, set out to find their respective twins. Wandering alone ever since, Aegeon has now entered Ephesus, una­ware that any Syracusan found in Ephesus, an enemy of Syracuse, must pay a one-thousand mark fine or die. Solinus, the Duke of Ephesus, grants Aegeon a day in which to raise the impossible sum.· 
The two main complications in the plot arise from two unlikely coincidences. Antipholus and Dromio, still looking for their twins, land that same day in Ephesus, which for many years now has been the home of their lost brothers, also named Antipholus and Dromio. 
The resulting action, saturated with slapstick and clownish violence, involves the confusion of these two sets of identical twins by the Ephesian Antipholus' wife, sister-in-law, servants and creditors. Even the two Antipholi and Dromios confuse master and man, giving and receiving conflicting orders. The drama reaches a climax when all four twins meet on stage at once. 
Shakespeare's plot complications are the script's greatest asset, although he also experiments with some characterizations which will gain more depth in later works. Luciana serves as an early study of the prudent maiden: gentle, sympathetic, and in some ways like Portia in The Merchant of Venice. The Duke, Solinus, represents Shakespeare's first attempt to create the perfect Renaissance Prince, a personifica­tion of dignity and justice. Unfortunately, serious characters like these become absurd in a plot that makes fools of all the players. Such incongruities betray Shakes­peare's inexperie~;~ce. 
The ND-SMC Theatre group wisely ignores the serious elements in The 
Comedy of Errors. Whimsical make-up( de­signed by Lisa Colaluca) and outlandish costumes transform the cast into a troop of marionettes. They dangle about a set (designed by David Weber) which, despite the distracting, cheap appearance of corrugated cardboard, echos those symme­trical relationships responsible for so much confusion among the characters. 
Aegeon's deadly plight, with which Shakespeare intended to elicit the audience's sincerest pity, became a source of merriment as the cast, like puppets, acts out the shipwreck story and pretends to cry at its conclusion. Even the impending death of Aegeon (played by Jack Campbell) gives rise to hilarity with the introduction of a black-hooded executioner (Peter

Reiher) who is a lampoon of all hunch­backed, brute-like laboratory assistants employed· by the monster makers at Universal studios. 
Hardly the personification of dignity, Solinus (Mark S. Grimsich) wears bright orange make-up and a wig to match, creating the impression that Ephesus is 
governed by. Bozo. The presence of such a ruler makes Ephesus a land where impos­sibilities are highly probable. 
Lisa Jaquez' Luciana, Shakespeare's intentions aside, is a pretty but imbicilic maiden whose "prudence" consists of reciting platitudes praising men's super­iority over women. 
The time was once when thou 
unurged 
wouldst vow 
That never words were music to 
thine ear, 
That never object pleasing in thine 
eye, 
That never touch well welcome to 
thy hand, 
That never meat sweet-savored in 
thy taste, 
Unless I spake, or looked, or 
touched, or 
carved to thee. 
Luciana's whining voice and the childish way she plays with her fan during these lines of Elizabethan wisdom demonstrate their vacuity. Jacquez' decision to satirize the Luciana character results in one of the most entertaining, albeit uneven, perfor­mances of the evening. 
Patrick Marks and Matt McKenzie play the Antipholus twins, Syracusan .and 
Ephesian respectively. Appropriate to a character "highly beloved" by his fellow townspeople, McKenzie feels at home in all areas of the set, knowing how to structure the space around his body through gesture as befit his speeches. Patrick Marks, the brother from Syracuse, appears less at ease, although in his wooing of Luciana and his 1soliloquies. on love he executes an amusing satire of the frustrated lover. At other times he suffers fits of indecision as to where to put his arms. 
In keeping with the farcical tone, Michele Roberge portrays Antipholus of Ephesus' wife Adriana as a shrew, the comic-book stereotype of the nagging wife. Roberge encounters some difficulties, however, in effecting this two-dimensional interpretation, since Shakespeare has given Adriana some unmistakeably tender lines, and perhaps the most appealing speech in the play 
The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls, Are their males subjects, and at their controls. Men, more divine, the masters of all these, Lords of the wide world, and the watery seas, Indued with intellectual sense and souls, 
Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls Are masters to their females, and their lords: Then let your will attend on their accords. 
After three acts of Adriana's bitter complaining at the top of Roberge's brassy voice, her line, "Ah, but I think him better than I say ...My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse," fails to ring true . 
. Still such a bellicose wife is a good match for the swaggering Ephesian Antipholus, and Roberge maintains a congruity be­tween Adriana and the other characters. 
The two Dromios take responsibility for most of the evening's mirth. Sean Coleman plays Dromio of Syracuse to Dave Bllison's Ephesian Dromio, two look-alikes with distinctly different personalities. Cole­man's Syracusian delights in rude jokes about Luce, the fat kitchen wench, and scurries about the stage with a puppy's frantic enthusiasm. In contrast to Cole­man's light-hearted energy, Ellison's Dromio is a long-suffering Emmet Kelly. He endures countless unjust beatings and married life with Luce (Lisa Turco) with a martyr's patience. 
Diana Hawfield directed The Comedy of Errors. From the opening scene Hawfield demonstrates a talent for unusual interpre­tation of comedy, but a marked lack of ability in structuring the space on a stage. Apparently incapable of arranging players in groups of four or more, she begins the drama with actors scattered randomly in useless strings of two and three. Ne­glecting this aspect of direction leads to a graceless exit of no fewer than twenty actors at the same time through the same narrow doorway in the last act. 
The audience gladly overlooks these imperfections once they are won ~>Ver by the fantastic atmosphere and sense of fun which inspires the cast and crew. ND-SMC Theatre will present The Comedy of Errors three more times: October 13, 14, and 15.

Committee outlines emergency energy plan 
WASHINGTON [API-The new Department of Energy has ser­iously overestimated its abilitv_ to cope with another cold winter and resulting natural gas shortages, a congressional report says. 
Federal officials have said they will be able to make up 60 percent 
Of expected shortages like those 
that closed schools and factories last winter. 
But in a report released yes­terday, a Senate committee 5aid, "the federal government wilJI not be in a position to help very much," even though it credited officials with doing more than ever to deal with anticipated short,a~~-~ 
The subcommittee on inter-gov­ernmental relations based its con­clusions on three days of hearings in which official outlined a Winter Emergency Energy Plan for 1977-78. 
"Another cold winter is on its way and we are not ready for what it may bring," said Senator Edmund S. Muskie(D-Maine) the panel's chairman. 1 

The report's authors said they were impressed with both the detail and scope of the emergency energy plan, prepared by the Federal Energy Administration (FEA). The FEA's responsibilities have been taken over by the new Department of Energy, which went 
into existence on Oct. 1. 

The subcommittee report said that the mere existence of the plan represents a far higher level of concern than the federal government has shown previously. 
But at the same time -it said the plan "appears to seriously overestimate the government's ability to increase natural gas supplies and decrease demand should another cold winter bring about natural gas curtailments." 
Testifying at the subcommittee hearings, government and private long-term weather forecasters said the nation can expect the coming . winter to be significantly colder ithan normal, although not as cold

Other witnesses said substantial

natural gas curtailments can be, expected as early as November. 
Last winter, frigid temperatures swept across some two thirds of the country in January _and stayed locked in place until spring. 
A reduction of electric power occured in some Eastern States and 
cutoffs  began  in  natural  gas

commercial users.  

Th(; subcommittee noted 
that by January 31, 4,000 factories had been closed and 400,000 workers laid off. By the 
end of last winter, the report said, "1.2 million Americans would be out of work temporarily becuase of the cold." 
It said that while the federal plan is based on the assumption that government action can reduce the expected natural gas shortage by 60 percent, a 22 per cent reduction is the more realistic outcome. 
"If these figures were correct, we could clearly go a long way toward easing the impact of any shortfalls this year," Muskie said. '"unfortunately, the numbers in

The PBC is a non-profit, ed~ ucational organization established to increase public awareness of corporate power and policies. The PBC has access to the major corporations which are sponsoring research in recombinant DNA. 
Howard, along with Jeremy Rif­kin, director of PBC, are the main investigators of the subject and have gathered enough information on recombinant DNA and genetic engineering to testify before the subcommittee on Health and! the Environment in the House of Representatives. They have dis­covered that there are eight ways to create lives other than mating. · 
According to Ken Rotts, program consultant for New Line Presenta­tions, the corporation sponsoring Howard, "PBC is the peoples' lobbyist against recombination. Howard's speech will bring to light questions the public must face upon the application of genetic engineering, such as the effect the new thecnology have on the en­vironment, who will determine the difference between normal genes and defective, who will take con­trol. We hear that life is being created artifially but we don't know the ramifications. This is where Howard's program is effective." 
The PBC advocates a morator­ium on the new technology to allow mankind to decide a course of action. 
The controversy facing scientists is whether or not they should proceed with the discoveries of recombinant DNA and genetic engineering. One side. of the conflict holds that the possible new 
forriis of life would improve life, 
with the creation of new food crops 
or a new form of medicine, gene 
therapy, which would treat hered­
itary disease. 
On the other side of the argu­
ment scientists question whether or 
not the human species should be 
altered. Howard and the PBC 
address the social and ethical 
questions of the discovery and 
recommend a moratorium. 
Terry Joiner, Student Union Academic Comissioner, the spon­sor of Howard's speech, com­mented on the upcoming visit of 
,Howard. "In about a year, the 
subject and controversy of genetic 
engineering is really going to hit. 
The A!,:ademic Commission's policy 
is to get speakers in a variety of 
topics, which sometimes touch 
upon !controversy,'' he said.

Find out what all the excitement's about tonight at 7:30 as the 1977-78 Irish leers stage their 2nd annual hockey exposition at the ACC. 
Purdue wins Irish tourney­Notre Dame finishes fourth 
by Tom Desmond Sports Writer 
A talented and deep Purdue University golf team captured the annual Notre Dame Golf Invita­tiona! Sunday afternoon on the Burke Memorial Course. 
The Boilermakers tallied a 377 total, just four shots over the tournament record set last year by 
the Irish, in pacing a weather-
depleted field of seven teams. Cold 
temperatures and threatening skies reduced the originally slated field of 12 down to the seven quads that 
competed Sunday. 
Tri-State University captured second place with 384 while Illinois State took third at 389. The Notre Dame Gold team finished in the number-four position with a score of 393. The non-scoring Notre Dame Blues faired better than their counterparts of the G?ld squad as the five-man team fimsh:d at. 388. 
Dave Schultz of the Umverstty of Wisconsin-Milwaukee took the me­dalist trophy with a one-under par 

70. Schultz opened with a birdie and finished birdie-birdie to offset two bogies en route to establishing a new tournament record. Notre Dame's John Lundgren held the mark with a 71 last fall. 
Sophomore Dave Knee paced the Irish, tying for second with a 74. Tim Saurs and John Lundgren were 
the only other Gold team members 
to shoot sub-80 rounds as both
finished at 79. Jay Bryan (77) and 
Biv Wadden (76) lead the way for the Blues. 
In action on Saturday the Irish defeated Tri-State at Tri-State in a dual encounter,374-382. Saurs, Tom McCarthy and Rich Knee all scored one-over par 73's to tie for medalist honors. 
Sunday's Invitational closes out the fall season for Coach Noel O'Sullivan's golfers as they now look _to ~he. full sl~te of du~l meets and tnvttattonals tn the spnng.

Perhaps Kansas City Royal second baseman Frank White put itbest after his team was beaten 5-3 by the New York Yankees in the fifth and deciding game of the American League championship series. "What a joke. You play hard for six months and eight innings and it all goes up in smoke in one fatal inning." 
For many teams, however, the season is even shorter. Thanks to major league baseball's antiquat­ed playoff format, 22 of 26 teams hang up their spikes come October 1. Compare this ratio to the National Football League, where eight ofits 28 entries compete in the playoffs. In pro basketball and hockey, the playoffs are almost as drawn out as the regular seasons. 
Although baseball set an all-time attendance record in 1977, there still remains financial difficulty, due in a large part to rapidly-escalating player salaries. There is obviously something amiss when the Philadelphia Phillies draw a club record of 2, 700,000 fans and still barely even. 
While the George Steinbrenners, Gene Autrys, and Ray Kroes chase around the continent signing free agents, the remainder of baseball's owners have sat back and ignored an often-suggested, sure fire method of boosting fan interest and attendance. Simply, to inaugurate interleague play and expand the playoff field. 
Believe it or not, this idea is over half a century old, according to Chicago White Sox President Bill Veeck, who along with Vice-President Roland Hemond, was the architect of the "Miracle on 35th Street" this summer on Chicago's South Side. "In 1922,my daddy, who was then President of the Chicago Cubs, proposed to the major leagues that they have interleague play," says Veeck. "Now, its 55 years later, and interleague play is still a frightening new idea." 
Veeck, who is universally regarded as a maverick among baseball owners, is still pushing his father's idea, but lack of cooperation from his contemporaries is once again standing in the way of progress. T_he prospect of interleague play was brought up at maJor 
league owners' meetings in March and July, and was voted dov:;ii .:ach time. 
It is hard to fathom why major league baseball has been so reluctant to accept interleague play and to expand the playoff format. September is perennially the slowest month at the turnstiles, and more teams contending for playoff berths couldn't help but boost sagging attendance. 
Veeck also points out the fact that a team that comes on strong in the second half of the season only to fall short of first place is often the strongest team in the division by October. There is also the question of just how much of a difference there is between a .617 and a .602 percentage played out over 162 games. 
If Veeck had his druthers, the season would be shortened by a week at both the beginning and the end to accomodate the additional playoff games. "The season starts too early, ends too late, and there are too many games in between," says Veeck. The owners often claim that with the ever-rising operating costs, a 162 game season is imperative, but as Veeck rightly points out, "You don't make up your operating costs during the last part of the year." And a larger playoff field would certainly make those tail-end-of the-season games more attractive to potential customers. 
Ideally, Veeck would like to see interleague play and a realignment of the divisions before adding a wild card team, but as Veeck himself says, "The purists don't like to see things change." 
But lest we wait another 55 years for interleague play, the playoff format could be expanded now. Taking the divisional winners, and the two teams with the next-best records in each league, regardless of division, would increase interest and attendance in September. And who could argue that the addition of Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh would detract from the quality of play? 
Of course the owners could stand still for another 55 years and see more and more fans spending their Septembers and Octobers raking leaves.

Late in the third quarter the Rams pulled off a double reverse with Billy Waddy gaining 30 yards to the Chicago 5-yard line. The Rams pounded to the 1 on three running plays and instead of going for an easy field goal, tried for a touchrlown.

' 
There was Tom Lasorda, oblivous to the hurricane-like conditions, hugging each one of his "sons," better known to baseball fans as the Los
' 
I Angeles Dodgers. In this era of increasing unrest and decreasing enthusiasm in sports, it was a pleasure indeed to this witness a diminutive~ gray-haired Italian, with a career won-lost record of 0-4 as a pitcher, enjoying the moment of victory. 
r 
Before the start of the National League Championship Series, I doubt if 
t 
very many knowledgeable baseball fans gave the Dodgers much of a' chance of beating the Philadelphia Phillies. After all, this was the Phillie
I 
club that had an extraordinary home record, an awesome power duo of
I 
Greg Luzinski and Mike Schmidt, the National League's top winner in
I 
Steve Carlton. and. most importantly, the home field advantage. 
Well, you can throw all the theories out, because the Dodgers are the team preparing to open the World Series tomorrow night. And no one is happier about it than Tom Lasorda. 
Here is a man who waited for what seemed like an eternity for baseball's Methuselah, Walter Alston, to step down from the manager's post with the Dodgers. He brought a boyish enthusiasm to spring training this year, in sharp contrast to the quiet professionalism always preached by Alston. He instilled a feeling of togetherness and pride on a ballclub whose tradition speaks for itself. Moreover, he gave them confidence in their ability to overtake the two-time World Champion Cincinnati Reds. 
After the first month of the season, there wasn't a doubt in any Dodger player's mind that they were the team to beat. Not even the mid-season acquisition of Tom Seaver by the Reds could change that feeling of superiority. And, true to form, the Dodgers never had a serious challenge. 
. So, while many baseball observers had their money riding on the Phillies, the Dodgers had their own self-confidence working. After losing the first game in their own ball park, they bounced back with a decisive second-game victory to even the series. 
Returning to Philadelphia, they could have easily buckled under the pressure of the raucous Phillie crowd. And it appeared Friday as if they Davalillo with two outs in the ninth ignited the rally. From that point, the Dodgers seemed to have things under control. Manny Mota hit a ball farther than he has hit one for about 10 years, the Dodgers got the break on a close call at first and Bill Russell singled up the middle, and the Phillies were dead. 
The teams went out and played a ball game Saturday night that never should have started, but it didn't matter. Carlton wasn't the same, nor were the rest of the Phillies. They became baffled by the sinkerball deliveries of Tommy John. Despite the vocal support of 65,000 fans, the Phillies were beaten the previous afternoon by that drag bunt and drive to the wall (by Mota). 
Now, its a Dodger-Yankee World Series, the first since 1963. The Yankees will be carrying a great deal of momentum after their miraculous comeback win last night. Yet, its no different than what the Dodgers did Friday. When the count reached nine, both clubs reached for a little extra. Lasorda and Billy Martin must be believers in divine intervention, by now. 
For Lasorda, he couldn't have hoped for a better script in his first season (a chance to win it all by beating the hated Yankees). Will he have Frank Sinatra around to throw out the first ball in the third game at Dodger Stadium? If it isn't Sinatra, Lasorda will find a way to instill a special motivation in his players. 
Billy Martin doesn't have to find a special motivation---all he needs is a close call at first. Whether or not his tantrums lead to motivating the Yankees may never be known, but the fact remains that Martin is a winner. 
Its a refreshing sight to see a manager like Tom Lasorda in the majors. Its a lot better to see him win, especially the way the Dodgers won this week. But, its doubtful if his string can continue. If he had another lefty starter and one bullpen ace, the Dodgers would be heavy favorites. However, the Dodgers won't be able to throttle the Yankee bats the way the Royal pitching staff did. So, watch·for the Yankees in six with Catfish Hunter coming through with a win.
