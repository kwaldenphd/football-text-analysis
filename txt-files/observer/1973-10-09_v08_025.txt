The Israeli war machine on full of­
fensive drove most of the Syrian army off 
the Golan Heights on the northern front of 
the Middle East war Monday and began 
"the Destruction of the Egytpian army" in 
the Sinai Desert to the south , the Israeli 
high command announced. 
"We are now in the middle of the battle," 
said Lt. Gen David Elazar, Israeli armed 
forces chief of staff. "We continue our 
counter-attack, we shall continue it 
tomorrow and we shall break and destroy 
completely all the attacking forces." 
In the United Nations, Egypt reported 
the first Israeli aerial attack of the war 
against an Egyptian city-Port Said on the 
Mediterranean coast. 
Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohammed 
Hassan El-Zayyat took the floor in the 
U.N. General Assembly to announce the attack on the ancient seaport at the nor­thern end of the Suez Canal, breaking into the world body's annual policy debate. Arab military communiques also reported the shelling of · Port Said. 
A meeting of the U.N. Security Council , called into emergency session at the request of the United States to consider how to end the fighting in the Middle East was postponed from 3:30 p.m. EDT to 6 
p.m. EDT. Arab communiques continued to sound a 
victorious note despite tlie'srael offensive. 
Arnong other Arab claims was the capture 
of Qantara East on the East Bank of the 
Suez Canal. 
On the third day of the "War of the Day of Judgment," Elazar said Israel had

st. mary's community 
destoroyed "many hundreds of tanks" on both fronts in an all ;out drive against the two Arab armies which invaded across the Golan Heights and the Suez Canal on Saturday, the Jewish Yom Kippur Day of Judgment. 
Elazar said Israeli forces had "not yet" crossed the Suez Canal into Egypt. He would not say whether they intended to cross the canal, whether they had already crossed the Syrian border or if they in­tended to march on Cairo and Damascus. 
But he said pointedly that "cease-fire lines are not marked on the terrain" and Israel would attack "wherever it is necessary." 
"The troops are moving from our territories against the other side," he said. "We shall see in the next days the direc­tions and the results." 
In Cairo, a communique reported Egyptian armed forces has pushed their advance into the Sinai Desert east of the Suez Canal and recaptured· the Israeli­occupied city of Qantara East. 
The communiques said the Egyptian flag had been raised over Qantara East, which is the second largest city in Sinai. 
"It is planned that the (Arab) ad-. ministration of Sinai will move to the liberated city in the shortest possible time," the communique said. 
The communique said Egyptian forces had captured 30 Israelis in Qantara, "the only Israelis who survived in the city." "The egyptians stiiJ in the city were overjoyed and rushed to welcome brother Egyptians fighting for the honor of their country," the communique said. 
SU activities will continue 
Staff to remain until at least Mon. 
By Kurt Heinz Staff Reporter 
Despite the uncertain status of the Student Union Director, all Student Union activities scheduled for this week will go on as planned. 
All of the Union staff members who resigned are remaining on their jobs pending a final decision on the dismissal of student union Director Jim Rybarczyk, which is due next Monday, October 11. 
The film "Sex Madness" scheduled for tonight and this weekend's Midwest Blues Festival are still on the agenda. Student Union Associate Director Pete Bohlander also indicated that there is a good chance that beer and potato chips will be served on the shuttle bus Friday. 
The upcoming concerts with Paul Simon, Nov. 3, and Graham Nash, Nov. 10, will also remain unaffected, as contracts have already been signed. 
Acting Student Union Director Drew Costarino is making no plans for running the Union until a final decision is reached by Student Government and by those who resigned. Costarino had previously served on this year's Orientation Committee. 
Costarino said that many of the staff members are having second thoughts about leaving their posts and that business is going on as usual this week. 
"I think that there's a lot of rethinking going on," he said. "Everything happened in two days. What happened was an emotional and gut reaction. Right now we are in a position of rethinking and negotiation. The people up there <Student Union)wantto be there." 
"I don't think that it will be as dramatic as everyone thinks. I hope things work out well. I just don't want the students to be screwed," Costarino added. 
A$sociate Director Bohlander said that whether he resigns depends on the decision of the Board of Commissioners next Monday. 
"Nobody wants to resign," he said "We're working for the students, but if it comes down to not being able to function effectively I'll have to resign." 
Bohlander was hopeful that communication would improve this week. Cultural Arts Director Kip Anderson who is in charge of the Blues Festival this weekend, is also having second thoughts about resigning. 
"I have been a part of the . Cultural Arts Commission for three years," he said. 'It has been a valuable part of my life that I wouldn't want to lose." 
"I reacted to Student Government's actions and on prin­ciple," continued Anderson. "It seemed like the thing to do at the time. However, I must also consider my responsibility to the students." 
Anderson feels that right now everyone is trying to calm down and compromise. He commented that the Observer blew the issue "entirely out of proportion." That resulted in the emotional reaction of both sides, he said. 
Though the entire Student Union is now uncertain as to its status, business is going on as usual and so far Student Union Activities have not been affected.

Arab oil cut-off expected 
WASHINGTON (UPI) -The Mideast war is likely to lead to Arab attempts to shut down oil shipments to Europe, deepening an already serious heating oil crisis in the United States this winter, Sen. Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash., said Monday. 
Jackson said "I am sure the Arab countries will make some kind of move" to cut off oil supplies within the next few days, possibly on . the ·initiative ofo._ I,.ibyan . strongman ~.Col. 
Moammar Khadafy. 

"The reason I say that," he 
said, "is that I expect Israel 
will completely frustrate the 
military moves by Syria and 
Egypt. Out of this will come a 
countermove to punish the 
United States. 

"They will try to punish Western Europe, and this will have an adverse effect on U.S. heating oil supplies because we are counting on large imports 
of l:leating oil from Western Europe this winter."

Reporters charge investigation by Agnew is unconstitutional 
WASHINGTON (UPI) -The Reporters Committee for Free­dom of the Press said Monday that subpoenas issued to reporters by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew's lawyers were "clearly void on their face" and an example of unconstitu­tional harassment. 
The committee, a legal research and defense organiza­tion composed primarily of reporters, said they would move to intervene in the Agnew case and urged reporters to continue using confidential sources in covering the vice president. 
Agnew's attorneys have sub­poenaed reporters from eight major news organizations to give depositions based on their argument that federal prosecu­tors should drop an investiga­tion of the vice president because "news leaks" have hurt his defense. 
The committee said it be­lieves "that these subpoenas are clearly void on their face because they are unsupported by any existing statute or court case." 
"They are," the statement added, "but another example of the unconstitutional and illegal harrassments being imposed on the working news reporters and news editors for doing their jobs by utilizing confidential news sources." 
It suggested that reporters covering Agnew "continue to utilize their confidential govern­ment and non-government sources whenever necessary to inform the public about deve­lopments involving allegations

SLC debates procedures for rule violations 
by Fred Graver Staff Reporter 
Yesterday afternoon's Student Life Council meeting focused on present Student Manual Disciplinary Procedures and possible reforms. New procedures for handling cases involving University rule violations were presented and discussed. 
Dr. Philip Faccenda, vice president for student affairs, opened the meeting by explaining the background and history of the disciplinary policies as they now stand. . 
"In the last five years," ac­cording to Faccenda, "the University has attempted to set up an honor system for the students, in addition to fulfilling the basic processes of fair hearings and due process of law." Faccenda added that in a school of the size of Notre Dame, the present methods are the best possible way to handle disciplinary cases.

by Art Ferranti Executive Editor 

Four Sorin Hall residents were charged last week for party violations based on the September 23 directive from the dean of students for two parties in the basement of the dorm. Three of the students have already received a penalty from John Macheca, the dean of students, while the fourth has decided to bring his case before the University Judicial Board. 
The two parties both took place the Friday before the Nor­thwestern game <September 21.) Juniors Bill Oberhart, Terry Cavanaugh, and Chris Payne held their party in the basement northeast turret room. Their punishment from Macheca is a prohibition from attending any home football, basketball, or hockey game for the 1973-74 school year with their case to be reviewed in January. Cavanaugh, a member of the Irish Guard, will still be able to attend those func­tions that the Guard is delegated to serving but must perform 25 hours of work duty for the dean of students. 
The fourth charged student is 
Mike Bonifer, also a junior. 
Bonifer is alleged to be responsible. 
for the other party. However, he 
did not sign a waiver which would 
allow the dean of students to 
review and judge the case as the 
other three did. Consequently, his 
case will go before the University 
Judicial Board which has y~t to 
made up for this year. 
All four students had told the 

hall resident assistant, John DiPietro the weekend before the parties of their plans. DiPietro said that he in turn informed the rector, Fr. Richard Zang and the hall staff at the regular hall staff meeting the following Monday. Their parties were allowed as long as they followed the rules and guidelines as stipulated by the September 13 directive and the two-year-old guidelines of the Board of Trustees, said Zang. The students were also notified of these guidelines. A few days before the parties, DiPietro said he informed 
the students again. 
More people showed up at the parties than expected and a number of students were drinking in the halls from both parties alleged DiPietro and Zang. The students were warned by the hall staff throughout the night of the violations and to contain the parties. 
The following Monday, Zang and DiPietro reported that they went to Macheca to inform him of the violations. Macheca urged a

1Dirty trickster~ testifies 
By Clay Richardson 
Washington UPI--Michael McMinoway, otherwise known as "Sedan Chair II," told Senate investigatores he infiltrated the 1972 presidentiial campaigns of three Democratic senators for the purposes of spying and political sabotage. 
McMinoway, called to testify in public session before the Senate Watergate committee later today, said in a preliminary interview with the committee staff that he spied on Sens. George S. McGovern, EdmundS. Muskie and Hubert H. Humphrey. 
Using his code name, "Sedan Chair II,"he operated under the direction of Jeb Stuart .Magruder deputy director of President Nixon's re-election compaign, he said.

McMinoway told the committee staff he "walked in" to Humphrey headquarters in Philadelphia, announcing himself as a businessnan with spare time to donate. 
He was put to work on mailing and telephone projects, McMinoway said he switched telephone cards so that some potential Muskie supporters were never called and others were called twice. 
He said he switched mailing lists, so that campaign leterature aimed at black voters went to labor groups and vice versa. 
He infiltrated the Muskie campaign in Milwaukee and the Humphrey and McGovern cam­paigns in California, he said. 
At the Democratic convention in Miami Beach, he said, he spwnt three days as a security officer guarding the McGovern floor in the Doral Hotel and reported the comings and goings to the Nixon Campaign.

A discussion was then held on the concept of "due process' as it is presently interpreted, centering on the written motification of a student accused of violating a University rule. Dave Grimmer, sitting in on the meeting as an authority on student discipline, suggested that a student should be made aware of all the alternatives open to him in the case from the first time he is notifies.

Justice Not 
Principle 
To the Editor: 
It seems to be common now for public persons to be accused and faced with impeachment for acts they have performed in office. Even Notre Dame has such a situation as Student Union Director, Jim Rybarczyk has been impeached and now must face a trial before the Board of Com­missioners. 
There surely was a noble gesture on the Board of Commissioners part for asserting their respon­sibility for controlling the func­tions of student government. In the face of a possible collapse of the Student Union, they performed one of their constitutional duties without intimidation. However, I seriously have to question the commissioners' motives for voting impeachment. If their primary concern was to actually apply justice to Mr. Rybarczyk, I whole­heartedly agree with them for their action. If, however, their primary concern was to support a statement of principle, then they have raped any form of justice within the student framework of government. 
An impeachment process is a judicial process to determine whether a public official is in­nocent of a wrong doing. This process should not be used as a political convention to put forth principles. If we are to have any justice, The Board should now forget all thoughts concerning principle and seek the actual truth concerning Mr. Rybarcyzk's duty to restrict the number of tickets or was it the duty of the Board of Commissioners or the tStudent Union Board of Directors to set the policy for ticket distribution? These and many other questions must be answered apart from any political question of principle. 
Jim Rybarczak has a right to a fair and unprejudiced trial. A trial free of political questions. A trial based soley on facts. I only hope that the Board of Commissioners 



daanesbury 
have the maturity and sense of responsibility to allow a fair trial to take place.

The Boycott 

A recent event in the struggle between the United Farm Workers and the Teamsters has left a question mark in the minds of many who have been aware of, and concerned about this conflict. 
For those of you who may not know anything about this dispute let me explain briefly. The UFW, headed by Caesar Chavez, was formed several years ago to help alleviate the oppression of the Mexican-American farm worker. After mucl: effort, the union was recognized by most of the growers in the lettuce and grape rich California valleys. This spring, as the UFW contracts were about to expire, the Teamsters moved .in and negotiated new contracts w1th the growers (this is known as a sweetheart contract), not allowing the workers they are supposed to represent have a voice in choosing their own union. 
By means of a boycott of grapes, 
lettuce, and more recently Gallo 
wines, and peaceful demon­
strations, UFW supporters aro~nd 
the country have been attemptmg 
to pressure the Teamsters and 
growers into recognizing the rights 
of the farm workers. 
The development that I alluded 
to earlier is that the pressure 
seems to have had an effect. An as 
yet unofficial agreement was 
reached that would give back to 
the UFW some of the contracts 
taken by the Teamsters. Even 
though this could be the beginning 
of a settlement between the two 
unions, there are still the growers 
to contend with. Because they may 
still refuse to hire workers 
represented by the UFW, the 
boycott must continue. 
A group of students here have 
been attempting to spread the 
word about the boycott, and have 
been passim! out information to

A Valid Enemy 
Editor: 

The incredibly twisted viewpoints of those who have at­tacked Father Toohey in recent letters to the editor need rebuttal. 
David Matthewson wrote that Father Toohey's " ...remarks are highly disturbing to all those who believe in academic freedom. Doesn't he realize his vitriolic statements could very easily touch off an anti-communist witch hunt on this campus." 
Will Mathewson have us repress Father Toohey in the name of academic freedom? 
But why, aside from his right to voice an opinion, (despite Mathewson), should Father Toohey speak out against Com­munism? And why asidefrom the pulpit? 
The philosophy of Communism denies the existence of God and declares man to be a worthless creature whose highest task is to serve the state. This rule of godless power causes Communist rulers the world over to seek the extermination of the message of Christ. Therefore the loyal Communist commits the one un­forgivable sin laid down by Jesus-­blasphemy against the spirit. 
Without even examining the 
incredible atrocities committed by 
communism in its brief, bloody 
history, it is suffient to note that it 
is the sworn enemy of Christianity. 
That is reason enough to compel 
any representative of God on 
Earth to be its mortal foe.

Man-Hole Days 

ed ellis 
It came to pass, 0 my brothers and sisters, that on several hot and 

sunny days of the past August, I took dominion over the bottom of a 
t..yelve-foot man-hole with the design of excavating out of brick and 
concrete a sluice through which sewage might pass on its journey 
from a six-story apartment building to a great cesspool somewhere 
near the Schuylkill River. 
Now I did not enter this nether region with any well-formed design 

for communion with the spirits of the earth. Rather I was there out of 
pecuniary necessity, my recent graduation having toppled me from 
among the comfortable ranks of the campus clerical establishment. I 
was rather broke, as a matter of fact, and in need of funds, and con­
sequently I was working the un-priestly and un-scholarly job of a 
plumber. 
'The man-hole was, as I have noted, twelve feet deep. It was stuffy 

and damp, like an old cellar. It was cylindrical in shape and four feet 
in diameter, with a curved sluice eight inches in width extending from 
the point at which the main sewer entered to the point three feet 
distance at which it made its exit. My job was to connect a new eight 
inch sewer to the main drain by means of a new drain. Occasionally 
various articles of waste would tumble, as if intoxicated by the obvious 
odor, across the main sluice and out the exit-line, driven by a steady 
stream of water. 
Now I'm not writing this because, like Jonathan Swift, I have any 

sort of 'fascination with what goes on in a sewer line. I have, to the 
best of my knowledge, no "excremental vision." However, I did have 
and do recall several extraordinary events which occured while I was 
digging in the hole. The first of these was an outstanding "memorable 
fancy," a sort of three-dimensional technicolor daydream induced in 
this case by the steady "rap-rap-rap" of my electric jackhammer. 
Put simply, I fancied a very relevant campus cleric being forcibly 
deposited down this most relevant of meditational tabernacles, and 
once the lid had been set, I fancied him trying to distinguish between 
pieces of union and non-union lettuce floating down the main sluice 
from somebody's kitchen sink. 
Even in my daze, though, I saw that in the darkness he could not 

hope to succeed, and so I fancied further that he took students down 
into what was now a crowded, darkened man-hole and tried to teach 
them to distinguish between union and non-union, fantastic and 
merely average, relevant and un-relevant objects in the sluice. 
This reverie was destroyed, however, by a rustling in the main 

drain, a treacherous racket which caused me to aim a volley from the 
electrichammer at the first organism that should dare to appear. 
Fortunately the electric power died at this point, or I should have 
terminated my boone companion and former political ally, Mega-Rat 
whose fuzzy snout suddenly protruded from the sewer pipe. 
Now all the world knows that Mega-Rat is not a sewer rat, or any 

tyr~ of rat really, but rather a large possum (from the Latin "I am 
able") who carried Lyons Hall in last year's Student Body 
Presidential election. My first reaction was of course to ask Mega-Rat 
what the hell he was doing in my sewer if he wasn't even a rate. 
Mega-Rat, obviously in a playful mood, countered, "My God, aren't 

you the world-famous Saint Mary's Guardian of Collegiate Sanctity? 
Where's your beard, Father Ed? Won't you hear my confession?" 
Being thus diverted, I chatted in most relevant fashion with the wise 

old possum, reliving good old days at the Dome, until he finally told 
me of his business in the man-hole. 
"Up there," he began, with a nod at the aperture above us, "we see 

the work of which your race of mankind is most proud, the objects they 
hold up for all the world to admire. At Notre Dame, we saw the Golden 
Dome, the Library Mural, the quaint but pretty grotto. If we look in 
the right places, we find the United States Constitution, the Empire 
State Building, and great libraries filled with books on right, reason, 
and men's perceptions of the truth. All these things are the prized 
efforts of great men. 
"But down here," he continued after a pause, "we find what con­

stitutes the essence of mankind -waste!" 
I commented at this point that such waste was at least an indication 

that folks here were not suffering from constipation. 
"You missed the point," Mega-Rat interrupted before I could 

elaborate. "Some men have devoted their lives to quality, excellence, 
virtue, and love of their fellow men. Those men have benefited all 
your race. But for each such virtuous man, there are hundreds -hell, 
millions -who waste ther lives without ever possessing or even 
glimpsing in their mind's eye one single real idea. Not because they 
can't, but because they are lazy and afraid. They fear real mental or 
physical effort as if it were a threat to the consummate dullness of 
their miserable lives. Their god-given brains, bodies and lives are as 
sewage-wasted. Indeed, the most valuable part of their lives is right 
here in this murky river you see passing in front of you, for a least that 
may become fertilizer for something valuable. And since the greater 
part of mankind has wasted its talents, I believe we can find the truth 
about those people in this man-hole with its stinking sluice and its 
teeming rats. The sun-lit world is buthumanity's ~acade of greatness, 
which the majority praises yet fears because that very majority 
disdains the moral and intellectual commitment to truth that is man's 
only succor against living death. 
"In that sense," concluded Mega-Rat, "I am here to observe a 

portion of truth, the truth about mankind-wasted things." 
Before I was able to answer the argument of thepossum,the elec­

tricity resurrected itself and the pounding of the hammer woke me 
from this second memorable fancy, a man-hole induced daze which had 
endured nearly an hour. It was now quitting time, I packed my tools, 
pondering all the while the Mad Poet's pronouncement that "Mental 
Things are Alone Real."

midwest blues II    
"I hate to see that evenin' sun go down, Lord, I hate to see that evenin' sun go down, It makes me feel that I'm on my last go 
'round." 
-The Saint Louis Blues 

That would be the way Bessie Smith would say she felt the Blues. This Friday and Saturday we'll have a chance to hear the Blues and get our own response. It's very difficult to classify the Blues as a musical form, simply because it is more than that. Of course, one can speak of it in terms of a twelve bar form or certain chordic patterns, but the quintessence of the music has escaped description. The Blues is a cultural medium of expression. It is, therefore, not something that can be imitated by persons livil!g outside the spectrum of that culture. To borrow an analogy, just as one who collected Indian art would not buy imitation made by technically proficient workers in a souvenir factory, so one wl 2:! is truly interested in the Blues would ~·t listen to white imitators. These imitat·~·s produce technically perfect music, nut they do not play Blues. Indeed, most true admirers of Blues music who are also musicians will admit this. 
unblue blues 

Now, to another point, the Blues are not alway 'blue.' A large number of people still identify the Blues with a slow-paced, dirgelike souling; this is a kind of Blues. From Blues we have developed much of the music of the rock and jazz culture of today. The slide, or bottle-neck guitar technique is 
When one thinks of Blues music he thinks of Chicago, Memphis, the Delta, Texas, the Piedmont, Detroit, St. Louis, New Orleans, but Indianapolis? Many of the migratory routes for southern blacks seeking escape from poverty and a dream of wealth came from the black belts of the southern states to the great industrial centers of the midwest. Indeed because of its centrality the midwest was a focal point of Blues and Blues recording throughout the twenties and thirties. Richmond, Indiana, for example, was a recording site for the Gennet and Champion labels, while Vocalion recorded in Indy. And Kokomo, Indiana, was the sin city of this era inspiring a song, "Sweet Old Kokomo," the model for Robert Johnson's immortal "Sweet Home Chicago." So it should come as no surprise that there is a 
flourishing  tradition  of  Blues  in  In­ 
dianapolis.  
indy blues  

The most famous Blues artists to set up in Indy, or Naptown, as its black residents call it, was the duo of Leroy Carr and Scrapper Blackwell. These two fashioned a style of music that was new to the Blues scene; they personalized the previously impersonal songs, and made reference to Indianapolis scenes and happenings that their listeners could identify. Theirstrongcombination of guitar and piano created a sound that was matched only by that of Peetie Wheatstraw in St. Louis. This was the established style that Shirley Griffith was confronted with when 
a kind of Blues that was being played in the Delta region at least forty years ago. The music that could be heard in the juke joints along the Mississippi and the timber lines in the thirties set the trend for early 'Rock 'n Roll.' The jug bands of Memphis in the twenties were recording songs in the twenties that only in the sixties were redone, easure for measure, to become pop and rock hits--e.g.,"Walk Right In" by the Rooftop Singers in 1963 was a remake of a song t~e Cannon's Jug Stompers re.corded m Memphis in 1929;'Stealin', Stealm," by Arlo Guthrie in 1970, was a remake of that song done by the Memphis Jug Band in 1928! And thegreatestfemale rock singer, Janis Joplin 
was a professed admirer and imitator of the music of Bessie Smith. The Blues are a part of American culture as well as music. Finally, the resurgence of 'boogie' m1:1sic is a surfacing of another Blues style m the modern stream, as Hound Dog Taylor will gleefully show. 
on friday 
MIDWEST BLUES II will open Friday night with possibly one of the best Blue line­ups ever seen. Opening the show will be Joe Willie Wilkins and His King Biscuit Boys, featuring Houston Stackhouse. Stack was here last year and subtly overwhelmed an audience in Washington Hall for over three 
hours. Not bad for a man of 63! Joining Stack this year is the group of musicians he regularly plays with in Memphis. This group, which is a boogie band from the word go, will kick open the Festival and set a pace that will really keep people moving. 


 
he came to Indianapolis some forty years 
ago. Shirley, originally from Jackson, 
Mississippi, had learned to play and sing 
from the great Tommy Johnson, bothper­
sonally, and by listening to the latter's 
records. But through this dual influence 
Shirley possibly exceeded his master, by 
playing guitar pieces solo that were done on 
Tommy's records as a duet! Shirley left the 
Jackson scene without being exposed to 
some of the other great artists that then 
were playing in the region--ee.g. Little 
Brother Montgomery, Ishman Bracey, and 
Houston Stackhouse. Shirley gave up music 
as a profession and headed for Chicago. He 
was detained in Indianapolis with friends, 
however, and there he stayed. Shirley got a 
job as a maintenance man in a GM plant and 
had worked there until his retirement, some 
five years ago. But the musical climate of 
Indy kept Shirley's interest and abilities 
sharp; in time he met and came to be good 
friends with Leroy and Scrapper, as well as 
J.T. Adams and Yank Rachel, and Guitar Pete Franklin (who, incidentally, plays the piano). It is with Yank and J.T. that Shirley will be appearing at Midwest Blues II in a session they have allowed us to call an In­dianapolis Blues Jam. J.T. Adams hails from Morganfield, Kentucky, and left for Indiana for the same reasons as Shirley, He, too, ended up in Indy, and soon became the playing partner of Shirley. J.T. shows less of the influence of 'Scrapper and Leroy in his guitar picking while Shirley shows his debt in many ways to Tommy Johnson. Both of these men, however, are indebted to no one when it comes to virtuosity on their Without a doubt, this group was the best -act of Sunday Afternoon at the Ann Arbor Blues and Jazz Festival1973. And Stack, doing his interpretation of several Tommy Johnson numbers, gives us a living link between country and city blues traditions. Indeed, Stack is probably just as responsible as Elmore James for the development of the distinctive Chicago Blues style (seeing how Stack taught Robert Nighthawk who in turn taught Muddy Waters). 

Following the set by Stack and Joe Willie will be one by a true living legend in Blues music: the Honey-dripper, the Country Blues Piano Ace, Roosevelt Sykes. Sykes, who presently is lviing in New Orleans, still makes his money from playing, and is still going strong at the age of 67. There is also the possibility of a jam between Stack and Joe Willie and Sykes. It seems thwt they all used to fool around together in Memphis and

instruments. The intricate rhythms and counter-playing between their two guitars shows an intense understanding of the music and feelings of these two men for each other. Yank Rachel, the third member of the Blues Jam, really needs no in­troduction. He was a prolific performer and recorder for RCA's Bluebird label during the twenties and thirties, when Blues was the only thing keeping the infant recording industry on its feet. Yank has played with such Blues greats as Sleepy John Estes, Big Joe Williams, and John Lee "Sonny Boy" Williamson. Yank is also noted for his Blues mandolin playing, calling back memories of the early strinbans of both Blues and Blue­grass music (whose roots are so intertwined as to be inseparable, but that could be another article). 
coming over 
The second set on Saturday night will be the Son Seals Blues Band. Son is a relative youngster on the Blues scene and it is quite surprising that he is into Blues at all. Most young blacks are more involved in the soul and rock and jazz sounds; and this fact placed Son in a rather awkward position : 
"People used to ask me where I was playing and then go to another club, because they didn't want to hear blues. Now it's different. Some of these same fellas slap me on the back now. They've come over to the Blues." Seals comes from a musical family: his father, Jim, ran a club in Osceola, Arkansas, which was a kind of relief from his hectic tour of duty with the legendary Rabbit Foot Minstrels, playing guitar, piano, drums, and trombone. Son grew up listening to Sonny Boy Williamson 
<Rice Miller), Robert Nighthawk, and Joe Hill Louis in his dad's club. Son also has paid his dues with a stint in the band of the great Albert King-it is Son's drumming that can be heard on Albert's LB "Live Wire'Blues Power", In Chicago he began jamming with Hound Dog Taylor and Howlin' Wolf, Jr. Son likes the music of Albert and .B.B. King, but prefers to work up his own material; as his first album, on the Alligator label testifies. All of the arrangements on the LBP are Son's own, and his treatment of certain traditional Blues themes shows a surprising mastery of the medium for one so young. His biting, slicing guitar playing will set the tone for an exciting finish to Midwest Blues ii. Under the careful management and tutelage of Bruce Iglauer, Son has come and will go a long way. He's dynamite! 
A promotional release on Mighty Joe 
this will be a· kind of reunion for the guys. It could be great. 
The curtain closer on Friday is the irrepressible Hqund Dog Taylor and the House Rockers. Taylor, an old friend of the late Elmore James, is the slide guitar player in Chicago today. His Sunday morning jam sessions at Therese's are attended by all the Blues greats of the Chicago scene. Again, there are possibilities of jamming in the sense of a slide guitar duel between Stack and Taylor or a picking duel between Joe Willie and Brewer Phillips, Hound Dog's second guitarist. All in all these guys will by playing their hearts out and just won't want to quite. So if you want to get a dose of what the Blues really is, make it over to Stepan Center for Friday's segment of MIDWEST BLUES II. 
ung tells us that, "Joe Young was born September 23, 1927 in Louisiana, But was raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and claims that city as his home town. After coming to the Windy City in the mid-1950's, one of his earliest gigs was backing player Billy Boy Arnold at clubs like the Columbian, the 708 Club, and the Blues Flame on the South side. A tourwithex-Muddy Waters guitarist Jimmy Rogers followed by the two year stint with Billy Boy, but Joe didn't like to be away from his wife and family for long stretches, he started looking around for a steady local gig. The opportunity came with Otis Rush and his band at the Castle Rock Lounge on the West Side, with whom Joe worked for three years." So, Joe Young, too, has paid his dues. Joe is a Bluesman sincerely interested in expanding the Blues format in many experimental ways touching on jazz and soul. He is a fine in­strumentalist and has a booming voice that commands attention. Joe has fronted the 
'house' band at the Ann Arbor Blues and Jazz Festival for the past two years and at the Ann Arbor Blues Festival in 1970. The choice of Joe to set the tempo and mood for the 1 Chicago Blues segment of the Festival is in itself a tribute to the man's mastery of style and finesse. At Midwest Blues II, Joe will have a chance to do his own thing; and after he's primed everyone, Koko Taylor will join this set, that could possibly bring everyone up dancing. 
wang dang woman 
Koko Taylor is a true Lady of the Blues. 
Her voice and style tells us that she is 
singing from the heart and not from the 
pocketbook. Koko has been on the Chicago 
Blues scene for some time and is well known 
in the night spots on the West Side as a 
regular with Willie Dixon and sometimes 
teammate of Joe Young. Koko's theme song 
is the great Howlin' Wolf hit, "Wang Dang 
Doodle," and when she did it at Ann Arbor 
two years ago, fifteen thousand people came 
to their feet and stretched the number into a 
fifteen minute group sing. The excitement 
this Lady can generate is incredible! This 
duo of Joe Yound and Koko will leave people 
with a dose of the Blues for quite some time. 
We would, as a last work , like to dedicate 
Midwest Blues II to the late Mississippi 
Fred McDowell. It was Fred's performance 
at Notre Dame in 1970, and 1971 that game 
many of us a lot of happiness. His per­
formance at Midwest Blues was his last 
major concert appearance, he went home to ·Como, underwent surgery, and died in July of 1972. He's gone and we miss him.

Alleged teenage sex offenders plead not guilty in Houston 
By RONALD L. LITTLEPAGE 
HOUSTON CUP!) -Two gan­gling long-haired teen-agers, one carrying a Bible and a pack of cigarettes, Monday unemotionally pleaded innocent to charges they participated in the homosexual slayings of 27 young boys. 
Elmer Wayne Henley, 17, and David Owen Brooks, 18; re­mained silent throughout sepa­rate arraignment sessions until District Judge William Hatten asked for their pleas to murder charges. 
"Not guilty," they said tersely. 
Hatten ordered the youths to face separate trials, Henley on Jan. 14, 1974 and Brooks on March 4, 1974. 
According to police, the two youths promised young boys liquor, sex and marijuana to lure them to a house belonging to bachelor electrician Dean 

Cheerleaders to run senior trip progra1n 
by Paul Young 
The senior class trip is changing its image. This year's trip will not be run by the ND Travel Bureau but by Bob Cimino and cheerleader co-captains Charlie Morrison and Annie Ciscle, in order to let the seniors run their own trip and create the feeling that this is really a "senior " trip. 

t 
All the cheerleaders will be giving thanks to their "patrons" at the Senior Bar and avid moviegoers who saw the Love Machine. In the words of Charlie Morrison "the cheerleaders have merged with the senior class in order to have the best trip ever." Morrison also promises that "we will win" the Miami of Florida game, the site of this year's trip. The trip itself will begin on Thursday afternoon, November 29, and end early ·evening December 2. Chartered buses will ·take students from campus to O'H:.tre airport and make the return route Sunday. Once in 
 
Florida, students will stay in the Twelve Casesar's hotel and 
chartered buses will take them to and from the game. 
The senior trip is centered around the Miami of Florida game but is by no means bound by it .. The game is Saturday but on Friday morning there is an optional trip to Disneyworld at the cost of $25. There will be an afternnoon pep rally on the beach Saturday and a

Arnold Corll, 33, who engi­neered the attacks. 
Corll died Aug. 8 of gunshot wounds during one of those sex and murder orgies. Henley confessed to police he pulled the trigger in self-defense, then admitted that he and Brooks aided Corll in committing the worst mass slaying in the nation's recent history. 
During the next six days following Carll's death, the two teen-agers led police to three different sections of Texas where 27 victims were unear­thed. 
Henley was first in the packed courtroom Monday, wearing a white T-shirt and blue jeans, sporting a short, ungroomed beard and fidgeting with a pack of cigarettes. He pressed his hands flat atop the defense table near the Bible he carried and silently listened as Hatten read the six counts of murder against him. 
pre-game party. After the game, win or lose, Morrison promises "a big bash." 
The reasons for the changes in the · senior class trip are 1a result of the determination of Morrison, Cimino and Cisle to give it "a new face, twice as good as before." The quota for last year's senior trip was not filled but this year the quota of students (40) has already been reached. 
Morrison emphasized the participation of the Cheerleaders as hope for a highly successful trip. He also expressed much gratitude to Senior Bar manager Tony Zuaro, who as a sponson made it possible for the cheerleaders to go. 
Morrison and the cheerleaders urge the seniors to go on the trip because the "trip is designed with the seniors in mind and it's going to be one big bash in Miami."

Secretary General Kurt Wald­heim in a letter to Mcintyre, informed the Council that Egypt requested evacuation of 
U.N. military observers from the Suez Canal zone to Cairo. The observers reported they could not confirm reports that Israeli forces crossed the Gulf of Suez at the start of hostilities on Saturday. 
Scali said the United States 
believed there were a number 
of principles that should be 
applied to the Middle East 
conflict. 
"First, in a situation where fighting is raging unchecked, the most appropriate means must be found for bringing the hositilities to an end. Military operations must be halted ... 
"Second, conditions must be restored in the area that would be conducive to a settlement of long standing diffferences in the middle East. There be respect for the rights and positions of all the states in the region. 
"Third ... the foundations so laboriously achieved in the past for negotiations looking toward a Middle Eastern peace must not be destroyed under the stress of a military emergen­cy." 
Scali said reports based on 
U.N. sources . appeared to indicate that Syria started 
hostilities with air attacks in 
the Golan Heights and at the 
same time the first firing in the 
Suez front "was from west to 
east."

felt that we could not fail to 
exercise our responsibility as a 
member of the (Security) 
Council to request a meeting of

Transcedental 
meditation 
intro planned 
Transcendental Meditation may at first sound like something too complicated to bother with. It might also be misunderstood ~s some kind of tempered psychedehc experience, or some way out form of concentration. 
It's not. Actually, with proper instruction , Transcendental Meditation, or TM, is easy enough for any ten-year old to master in a week. Over the past two years, about 150 students from Notre Dame and St. Mary's have learned the technique here in South Bend. "Meditatots" report greater stamina and faster reaction time, increased alertness during classes and increased ability to con­centrate. 
Their rather remarkable claims are supported by a growing body of scientific research. One such study by Dr. Abrams at Berkeley revealed that the relation between the practice of Transcendental Meditation and recall ability in­dicates that TM improves memory 
and learning ability. 
One thing teachers of TM are quick to pont out is that the technique is not related to Zen, or 
religion. On the other hand, TM involves no yoga exercises or any special postures. It is a s!mple, natural, mental technique which gives the body a level of rest deeper than sleep and which in­creases the alertness and creativity of the mind, preparing the individual for fulfilling and dynamic activity. 
Courses in TM are being offered regularly here in South Bend. The entire process of TM can be learned in four two-hour sessions over four consecutive days. The training is provided by an organization called the Students' International Meditation Society. This is a non-profit educational organization with 205 centers in major U.S. cities. In South Bend 
S.I.M.S. is located near Leeper Park at 226 East Navarre. Two instructors, Susan Seifert and Carol Dixon, run the cneter. 
Posters frequently appear on campus announcing an "In­troductory Lecture on Tran­scendental Meditation as taught by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi." These lectures are free public presen­tation describing the effects of TM, the results of scientific research, and outlining the structure of a TM course. The first . Introductory Lecture at Notre Dame this semester will be this evening at 7:30p.m. in the Memorial Library Auditorium.

Although the instruction of math and reading is the major aim of this program, one of its co­ordinators said, "it won't be strict tutoring, but will be partially in­terest-building. The girls, along with their tutors, will take field trips related to what they are studying, to develop an interest in it. Gradually, we will get into strict tutoring." 
The organization is working with the YMCA in this tutoring project. 
In addition, the organization is loaking for musical instruments to borrow, or for donation, to use for musical instruction.
