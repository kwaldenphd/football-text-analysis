As Mickey's hand moves toward 7 o'clock, bankers shove stacks of $5 bills to card dealers; concession sellers pop corn and spin cotton candy ; the roulette wheel is greased, and the doors are unlocked to Mardi Gras 1972, at Stepan Center, Feb. 5th through 12th. 
"Jiminy Crickets," thinks the student, on entering Stepan Center. The interior is tran­sformed into a Mid-America Disneyland complete with dwarves, Peter Pan and Tinkerbell, Pinnochio and other Disney favorites. Black jack, poker, roulette, movies, picture taking booths, crap games and snack bars all tug at the attention and purse strings. 
Admittedly, an evening at Mardi Gras is not cheap -but it isn't intended to be. All profits go to charities such as Manasa, Neighborhood Student Help Program and Sr. Marita 's Day School. 
Raffling off a '72 Grand Prix should rake in the most cash, although this year's raffle is falling behind the expectations of Greg Stepic, General Chairman of Mardi Gras. To date, the raffle has collected $14,000. 
Finances 
Since 1963, financial records show Mardi Gras has made $127,000 for charity. Mardi Gras '66, '67, and '68 reaped fat profits of $22,000 apiece. 
Then came the financial disaster of 1969 when the carnival lost $3,500 and paid its debts by borrowing money from the Student Government. Mardi Gras tried again in 1970 and netted $11,000. 
The slump in profits was caused by students' growing apathy towards the purpose of Mardi Gras, which is to earn money for charity, according to Stepic. "Mardi Gras is wor­thwhile only if everyone gets involved in it," he said. 
Mardi -Gras has also faced dollar disaster at the hands of burglars last February and again this year. In 1971 a thief hid in Stepan Center at closing time, and stole $2,200 in bogus $5 bills. Serious loss was averted by refusing to honor the fake money for the remainder of the carnival. Officials estimated a $100 cash loss. 
Sunday night the carnival was burglarized, again for $5 bills worth $2,000 in real cash. A special stamp on all money is being used this year to prevent

Earliest records of Mardi Gras date to 1962, although one alumnus, reminiscing during a football game this fall, claimed there was a Mardi Gras back in 1951. And a police guard says he has patrolled Mardi Gras since he joined the force in 1958, when the carnival, then much smaller, was set up in the old fieldhouse.

Bill Dembinski, President of Holy Cross, said that his hall could possibly give up a group of rooms together for 6-10 students. He added that he thought other

halls might have some difficulty doing this. 
Agreeing with him was Ron Pogge of Alumni, who said that he was "favorable to the idea" of giving the displaced students groups of rooms. He also com­mented that everyone will have to sacrifice, not just the residents of Badin and Walsh. 
Phil Michaels of Dillon said that giving a block of rooms would be "very difficult" for his hall. He suggested that each hall be assigned a quota of displaced students and that these students be given full rights for room picks as if they had been in the hall since they were freshmen. 



say of dorm choices 
by Pete Fries and John Klose 
Walsh residents are split in their feelings regarding the recent decision to convert Walsh and Badin halls into female dormitories. All 10 residents interviewed were disappointed with the decision, but only 3 held any hope of a reversal. 
Sophomore Mark Thickpenny believes a reversal is feasible because " ... there are many valid reasons why Walsh is an illogical choice. Also, we think we can get the majority of the rectors on our side." 
Other students, however, think their chances are slim but still intend to write to the alumni to invoke a reversal. One of these students, Ed Gray, another sophomore, said "there isn't a whole lot you can say. It's a bad decision. The ideal situation would be a university-wide pick and let the girls pick into any hall they choose. Right now it's just a little St. Mary's ." 
Further opposition was expressed by Don Flake who felt that the women " ... should be treated just as Notre Dame students and not be given any preference." 
Another one of these students is Jerry Bushelman, a sophomore who worked on the committee which studied the location of female housing. He commented that "There would be ill-feeling if it (the decision) were changed." Bushelman also felt that the members of the committee were slighted and should have been con­sulted in the decision. 
The rest of the students interviewed are looking farther ahead to what can be done to help themselves find suitable housing. Many expressed the same feeling as that of Bob "Bruiser" Fanning a junior resident of Walsh who will "take it in stride and see about what the university does in relocating the students." All the residents felt that the university should have made suitable arrangements for displaced students.

Pat·is--The chief American delegate at the Vietnam peace talks refused to agree to a date for the next session and accused North Vietnam of organizing a rally near Paris to place "intolerable" pressure on the negotiators. 
Saigon--Military spokesmen in Saigon reported increased enemy attacks on South Vietnamese positions in the central highlands and the heaviest American air strikes in six months in retaliation for the at­tacks. The central highlands is where officials have predicted a major enemy offensive during the Tet holiday. 
Washington--The Price Commission ordered p~vately ~~ed utilities not to raise their rates for one month pendmg commtsston hearings on "more explicit" guidelines on utility rates. In. another action, the commission temporarily rescinded part of a rate mcrease granted the New york Telephone Co. 
Washington--President Nixon, at his news conference, said he had ordered a study on whether a constitutional amendment or congressional action would be needed to stop the extensive busing ordered by courts to achieve school integration. The President has long opposed busing. 
Washington--Sharpening his attack on the Democratic presidential candidates who disagree with his Vietnam peace plan, President Nixon said that his critics might have to share the blame for the failure of the Paris talks. He said criticism of his policies encourages the communists to wait until after the presidential election before seriously negotiating.

Riehle fed up 


Shoplifters to go 
Shoplifting in the Notre Dame bookstore will be a little more costly now that Dean of Students Rev. James Riehle plans to immediately suspend any student convicted of the crime. 
"My patience is at an end." commented Fr. Riehle. "I plan to threaten the heck out of the students now." 
Fr. Riehle recently announced that "any student apprehended and convicted of stealing ... will be suspended for the current semester." 
Since December I, 1971, the Dean has talked to 70 students who were apprehended at­tempting to steal articles in the bookstore ranging from 49 cent Bic _pens to $20 textbooks. One was suspended while the others were put on disciplinary probation. 
"Fromnow on, there won't be any more second offenders," remarked Fr. Riehle. 
The great increase in the number of shoplifters caught in the past two months is attributed to the stricter security measures being employed in the bookstore. 
Fr. Riehle said he has heard every conceivable rationalization for stealing from those already apprehended. Some told him, "it's a big joke to tell your friends you swiped something from the bookstore." Others say, "the 
Dance a dance for Mardi Gras 
by Marlene Zloza "Mardi Gras Super Soul," a dance in co-operation ·with the Mardi Gras Festivities, is scheduled for tonight, from 9:00 to 1:00, in Regina Hall. Billed as "a dance you can dance at" by its sponsors, the SMC Campus Ministry, the event will feature a local band, "The Impacts." All proceeds from the evening will benefit the Mardi Gras fund. Admission to the dance is 50 cents, which includes refresh­ments. The dance is open to all ND-SMC students. Co-ordinator Fr. Ned Reidy described the affair as "an effort to restore dancing to our culture. It will provide a chance to hear some good soul music." If this dance is a success, the Ministry plans to sponsor others throughout the semester, added Fr. Reidy. 

bookstore overcharges so much that I've got a right to take things." 
Almost every student ap­prehended for shoplifting had the money in his pocket, according to the Dean. 
"I can't understand why a student would now attempt to steal from the bookstore. It's ridiculous!" exclaimed Fr. Riehle. "If a student was suspended he probably could not get into another university. It would go on his permanent record, and he could forget about any Law School or Med School in the country." 
Prior to 1968 the penalty for stealing in the Notre Dame Book Store was immediate suspension upon conviction. However, Fr. Riehle considered it too severe and began a policy of disciplinary probation for first offenders with suspension upon the second of­fense. 
The Dean is now convinced his policy failed. "It's my hope and prayer that extreme measures such as these will resolve the problem," he said.

A Secrecy Blanket 
Ever hear of a secrecy blanket? It is pretty much the same as a security blanket. It is used to hide behind. 
Notre Dame and St. Mary's have thrown a secrecy blanket around the recently reconvened merger talks. They have thrown a blanket around them and opened the way for them to play their little games with no outside pressure, until the second coming, or perhaps even after then. 
If the people who were in these secret talks were trustworthy then there probably wouldn't be anything to worry about, but they aren't. 
These people are the same ones who produced last November's abortion. These people are the same ones who muttered pieties about honor to assembled students and swore at each other in private. These are the same people who said they were honor bound not to reveal the reasons behind the unmerger and then leaked their version to every student reporter they met. 
So, we have a group of essentially untrustworthy people gathered together in secrecy, making decisions that could wreck people's lives. The catch is that any decisions they make won't wreck anyone's lives but ours. 
The Notre Dame and St. Mary's administration and trustees have protected themselves by having ample representation on the negotiating teams. The St. Mary's faculty is also protected by having their people present. By all indications the Notre Dame faculty neither needs nor wants a part in the proceedings. 
So who do we have left. The students naturally, the people who are the first to get nailed to the wall around this place. 
The secrecy policy is aimed at us. It is aimed at us so we won't find out what's going on until it's too late to do anything about it. It's aimed at us so as to prevent or forestall the kind of pressure that was exerted last year from being exerted again. 
The St. Mary's administration and trustees backed down last year because the students put the pressure on them. They backed down because students kicked and screamed and threatened to take their money out of the school. They backed down because they were afraid St. Mary's would end up at a bankruptcy sale in ten years. 
But that same kind of fear and that same kind of pressure won't come into play again if another adverse decision is reached. They won't come into play because if an adverse decision is reached it will be reached in secret. It will be reached in secret and if the people running the show have any kinds of smarts at all, the secrecy won't be lifted until the summer. 
We're responsible for the secrecy. We're the ones who are letting them get away with it. And we'll be the ones to blame if and when another abortion is produced. And then it will be too late.

The Death of Notre Dame 
1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 
As an undergraduate at Notr arne, I always found letters from old graduates a joy to read; ge rally th,ey were pathetic pleas for a ;eturn to the past, and the 1ews expressed were so completely ar­chaic as to render them ridiculous. Alumni were strange creatures, to be enjoyed over lunch and laughed at, but never, ever to be taken seriously. Notre Dame does not belong to them, despite all their claims to the contrary. 
With this in mind, I write to you. Ex-student, one year removed. I write because I have been completely puzzled by my latest visit here. Let us leave aside any pronouncements of right or wrong, good or bad. The problem is simply this: it seems to me that between last year and this something strange has occured, that something is substantially different. I don't understand this place at all any more; a year ago I was one who was sure he knew where things stood. Some of this can be traced to changes in me--a lot of it, in fact. But much of it has taken place right here. 
Notre Dame is dead. 
There is a cloud hanging over this community, a cloud which has no name but which bears a pervasive, persistant sadness. Media labels this "disillusionment;" to break it down further, it seems to me that the Notre Dame community, which remains (face it!) one of the straightest places in the country, has simply decided that if change is. gonna come, so that actually working to change things faster than this "natural" schedule would allow is a waste of time. 
-~ 
Let me just say it. This entire merger thing, and your handling of it, is making asses out of all of you. I think by now that everybody realizes that, my God, men and women really can make it together. You know it's gonna happen. Machismo really is a thing of the past. But every time you sit down to "work out the details," machismo rears its head and shouts, "I ain't got much time left but I'm gonna fight it out to the end." In a community where there are so many enlightened people--and visits elsewhere, to other large universities, show that archaity is by no means a Notre Dame exclusive -in such a community, anyone who speaks with a positive view about the future, about the future we all know has got to come, is either studiously ignored or viciously put down. So in increasing numbers those students with a view of the future move off-campus, and good educators leave Notre Dame completely. 
Buck minster Fuller is dead right when he says that if you wish to speak of the future in terms of radical change, the only way to keep people off your back is to project ahead fifty years; nobody much cares about what things will be like in 2020. To deal with what must be done in the immediate future is to invite scorn and ostracism. 
Passivity has always been one of our strong points here. We have a new kind of alchohol now, and the ritual of stoned-out sitting between the stereo speakers has become a religious ritual as stale as an old watch-the-priest Latin mass. What once had real creative possibilities, this marijuana stuff, has for most become the 1972 version of going to Frankie's. Do~sn't the phrase "Man, we were so ripped <wasted, spaced out, fucked up) last night" have a familiar ring? 
If all this seems a bit directionless, it is supposed to; remember, I am trying to describe Notre Dame as it is today, February 1972. The symptoms are everywhere. Once there literally dozens of excellent music people here, and surely there must sUlll;>e; but now they play for themselves in their rooms. Walk down a campus sidewalk and notice that in this enlightened age of Aquarius it's still considered a little wierd to talk to strangers, or even smile at them. And only the bravest black man or woman would come here to study; I wouldn't. 
Logic says that in the future no non-coeducational institution will be able to survive; that if you get ripped and just sit "getting into the music" for long enough, the building will get old and fall down around you: that you can only drive away so many good people from your midst before there's nobody left. And then you die. Sorry about that, it is a bit of a downer, but it is the way of the world. One gets the feeling that Notre Dame, without the fire and strength and calm and beauty of the feminine influence, without the cultural contribution of as many "minorities" as possible (in quotes because in world terms we Caucasians are a small minority), without any prick of conscience, is dying, insanely, like a man whose legs catch on fire and say's, "Far out, I've never been through the 'burn trip' before." 
I began by emphasizing that Notre Dame does not belong to alumni. This ain't my place we're talking about, it's yours. And I believe I can truthfully say that I don't care what you do with it, 'cause I've got things to do. But as long as you as a community would simply rather not deal with the future in realistic terms, you are dying. And if you would rather not deal with it at all, then you, as an institution, are dead.

Junior Don White had his underwear "ripped off" by the laundry service and he wants it back. 
While many students claim that the laundry has lost their wares, this time the laundry admits it goofed. But the only compensation offered White was a pair of someone else's briefs. 
"Regardless of the ernbarassrnent," White claimed, "If the laundry doesn't respond properly, I am going to sue." 
When White returned from Christmas vacation, he placed the shorts in his laundry bag along with another pair. He noticed that only one pair was returned when he picked the package up. 
The laundry told White to wait a week because the missing goods would be returned in his next bundle, but they didn't appear. 
Within the next three weeks, White claims to have visited the laundry office no less than three times. Each time he was told that he would be given a pair of someone else's un­claimed underwear. 
"The idea doesn't really appeal to me," White said. White has contacted the Ombudsman, student govern­ment's problem solver, and SBP John Barkett with no suc­cess. He concluded his brief remarks with the claim that he is "only a poor college student." 
Dead Sea Scrolls revived in lecture 
The second lecture in the University of Notre Dame's series on the Dead Sea Scrolls with be delivered Monday <February 14) at 8 p.m. in the Memorial Library Auditorium by 
Dr.  William  H. Brownlee  of  
Claremont  Graduate  School  in  
California.  

The title of his talk, which is open to the public, is "The People of God: the Qumran Community And the Early Christian Chur­ch." 
Brownlee has been involved with the scrolls since 1947-48 when he was a visiting scholar at the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem and was one of the few scholars on hand when the ancient Jewish writings first carne to light. Besides translating two of the most im­portant of the scrolls, the "Manual of Discipline" and the "Commentary on Habakkuk," he has written "The Meaning of the Qumran Scrolls for the Bible," published by the Oxford University Press in 1964. 
In addition to the public lec­ture, Brownlee will lead three seminars on more specialized aspects of the Qumran com­munity. 

Notre Dame's series, inaugurated last month under sponsorship of the theology department, consists of five lectures by Christian and Jewish scholars during the spring term to commemorate the 25th an­niversary of the discovery of the scrolls near the Dead Sea.

Fr. Ted says aye to drinking bill 
by Ann McCarry 
Notre Dame's president Father Theodore Hesburgh expressed support last night for a bill passed Wednesday by the In­diana legislature that will lower the drinking age to 18. 
"Ifa guy's old enough to go out and get shot at, he's old enough to drink a beer,'' laughed Hesburgh, when asked what he thought of the bill. 
Father Hesburgh did not see any big change in student life at Notre Dame because of the change in the drinking age. He noted the University "kind of jumped the gun" on the decision. 
The bill will also lower the minimum age for entering into contracts and business agreements to 18. · 
After passing the legislature, the bill now rests with Indiana's Governor Whitcomb, awaiting signature into law or guber­natorial veto. 
Although he has "mixed emotions" on the new law, Whitcomb is expected to sign the bill. The Indiana legislators are believed ready to pass the bill over any veto. 

last night, we were still trying." 
In conclusion, the president of 20 years spoke briefly on the future of Notre Dame, and the quality ofeducation here. 
"I'm under the impression that you learn almost as much outside the classroom as you do in the classroom," said Fr. Hesburgh. He went on to define the quality of a Notre .Dame education as a combination of "high com­petence" and compassion, a good basis for a philosophy of life. "Around here we should try to develop a society of people that care." ... "Whatever we do, we should try to be special," he remarked.

The National Players of Washington, D.C., one of the nation's oldest theatrical repertory companies, will present "The Trial," an adaptation of the Frank Kafka novel, in a single performance at 8 p.m. Sunday, February 20, in O'Laughlin Auditorium of Saint Mary's College, Notre Dame, Ind. 
Arousing controversy from its first appearance, "The Trial" is the story of a man, Joseph K., accused and tried for an unnamed crime. Scholars who have analyzed it have seen nit a parable of guilt-ridden man, a clairvoyant vision of totalitarian society, or have transposed it into dramatic form, as Orson Welles did in his film by the same name. 
Appearing in the lead at S THE Saint Mary's performance will be Alan Wade, a graduate of Northwestern University who appeared in 17 roles while a member of the school's prestigious dramatic department. He received his master's degree at Catholic University of America and was awarded the Gilbert award for best performance by an actor in "Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead." 
Tickets for the Saint Mary's performance, part of the Performing Arts Series, are on sale at the O'Laughlin box office and may be reserved by calling 284-5424.

Mike Fanning will be looking to boost his pin total to 17 this weekend as the Irish wrestlers meet Findlay and Akron U. 

Fanning 
by "Lefty" Ruscbmann 

Down in the "pits" of the Convo Center's auxiliary gym, Terry Mather's wrestlers go through their calisthenics, accompanied by rock music from the gym's record player. By the corner sits a big man, quietly going through his exercises. Mike Fanning, Notre Dame's ace heavyweight wrestler, prefers to let his record, and his coach, do the talking for him. · 
The record for the imposing 6'6", 265-pound freshman shows an impressive total of 17 wins without a defeat this season, with 15 of those triumphs coming by pins. Earlier this year, Mike eclipsed Phil Gustafson's school record for consecutive pins enroute to compiling a string of twelve straight. 
Already he is ranked by Mather as being on a par with Dick Arrington, the finest wrestler in Notre Dame history. In 1965, Arrington placed third in the national tournament and Mather holds great promise for greater things from his young star. 
Fanning, like Gustafson and 
~ Arrington before him, plays football for the Irish. Mather encourages this practice, claiming that "wrestling develops the same qualities needed to play football." As for the drain on time caused by playing two sports, Mike shrugs off the problem. "Sure, it takes a lot of time, but I like it." 
Mike's int~oduction to the mat scene came during his sophomore year at Edison High School in Tulsa, Okla. In three

Notre Dame's swimming and fencing teams will display out­standing records in front of the home fans this weekend. 
The unbeaten Irish fencing team, 8-0 following four victories last weekend, faces highly regarded Detroit and the University of Chicago at 1:30 
p.m. in the Athletic and Con­vocation Center on Saturday. Mike DeCicco's team has won 18 straight dual matches over the past two years but the last Irish setback was at Detroit, 15-12, exactly a year ago during a 21-3 campaign. 
Notre Dame's 6-2 swimming team, fresh from two victories over Oakland University and Wayne State on the road, meets St. Bonaventure Saturday at 2 
p.m. in Rockne Memorial Pool. 
Jim Kane and Ed Graham established new varsity records in the 67-46win over Wayne State. 
Kane won the 100 freestyle with a record time of 49.36 while Graham lowered his mark in the 200 individual medley with a 
2:11.29 effort.

years of varsity competition, he placed second and fourth in statewide competition, which earned him an offer from NCAA mat champion Oklahoma State. But Mike really wanted to play college football, so it came down to competing offers from Notre Dame and Oklahoma. "I decided to come to Notre Dame because I liked the campus. And the football team here is the finest in the nation," Fanning explains. 
For a freshman, Mike has displayed a great deal of poise, both in dual meets and in tour­nament competition (he took first place in both the Rochester In­vitational and National Catholic tourneys.) His greatest strength is his talent for recovering after he is down, though he is shar­pening his all-around play. During meets, he nonchalantly occupies the end of the Irish bench, waiting his turn to wrestle. "I'd really rather be first to wrestle every meet," he confesses, "but I can't do anything about it." Even the transition from high school to college competition hasn't caused him much worry, although the longer college matches have been demanding. "The roughest problem is getting in condition for these matches," he says. 
In addition to wrestling, Mike hopes to land a starting assignment on the Irish defensive line, where he saw a lot of action in last fall's freshman campaign. He also hopes for a shot at the NCAA title next month against what is regarded as the toughest field of competitors in the tourney's history.

The Badgers were caught napping last weekend in the Twin Cities, dropping 4-2 and 7-5 decisions to the last place Min­nesota Gophers and, if a couple of key performers are healthy, 

against the Gophers. The Irish will be at full strength this weekend if high scoring wing Paul Regan's sprained ankle, suffered against UMD last week, is completely healed. Goalie Dick Tomasoni, who did not dress for the UMD series because of a concussion sustained against Wisconsin the previous weekend, appears ready to reassume the 
Leading the Notre Dame attack are Regan (24 goals, 14 assists) and John Noble, 41 points on 10 goals and 31 assists. Wingers Eddie Bumbacco and Ian Williams have both contributed 18 goals to the Irish point totals. 
The Badgers and the Irish have met 11 times in hockey, with Wisconsin winning nine of the games and one ending in a tie. 
Bob Bornkessel of Kansas and Godfrey Murray of Michigan in the hurdles. 
Southeastern Conference champion Tennessee, Kansas, Missouri, Air Force and Drake head the 24 team field on the new Tartan track. The Irish (2-1) defeated Ohio State (56-51) but lost to the Air Force (66-56) last Saturday in Columbus.

The India Association of Notre Dame is sponsoring a Variety show of authentic Indian acts this Saturday night. Funds raised will be used for emergency relief of Bengali refugees now stranded in India. 
Three months of intensive preparation by thirty members of the association will be culminated on Saturday at 7:00 in O'Laughlin auditorium. The admission charge is $2.00. 
"We intend to collect funds for Bengali refugees who wish to return to Bangladesh. They need food and provisions to re­establish themselves in their homelands and to rebuild their villages," Cajetan Cordeiro, president of the organization said. 
The chemical engineering graduate student added that the Indian community has already raised $3,000 in relief funds. 
"We feel we are obligated to do our part," he added. "The people back home are paying taxes and other obligations that we don't face. This is our contribution and 
... 

we would like the rest of the ~--mmunity to share with us."
