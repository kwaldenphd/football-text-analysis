Anthrax scares call for education 
By HELENA PAYNE Assistant News Editor 
Tlw threat of domestic terrorism in the U.S. has become a morn imposing n~ality since the attacks of Sept. 11. The suspect use of biological warfare against Americans through anthrax has only h,,ightened the sense offear. 
Although, this acute infortious disease can be deadly, medical and political experts caution people not to panic, but to be atten­tive to and educated about the issue. 
Dr. Nancy Cole. a microbiologist for the South Bend Medical Center, said people should know that anthrax is caused by the bacteria Bacillus anthracis which, in many cases, can be treated with variants of penicillin. 
"It's important first of all for lprn)pleJ to understand the facts," said Cole. "[Anthrax! is v1~ry unliknly to be passed from one indi­vidual to another. There is an aspect in which people may be fearful that thev don't have to worrv about." 
Anthrax gro~s in human tissue through the means of spores. As the bacteria grows and replicates the life cycle, it also releas­es toxins.. These toxins can cause the two major effects seen in patients who have come in contact with anthrax: edema, or a build-up of fluid in the tissue, and hemorrhage, or internal bleeding. 
People can come in contact with the bacteria through cuta­neous anthrax which enters the skin through inhalation or through gastrointestinal means. The way to recognize the m.ore common form of cutaneous anthrax is by lesions that resemble dark pits on the skin's surface. 
In cases of anthrax inhalation, fluid fills up in the lungs caus­ing symptoms similar to pneumonia accompanied with severe

Air Force band makes tribute to heroes 
By SARAH NESTOR 
News Writer 
The opening notes of John J>hilip Sousa's "The Stars and Stripes Forever". by the United States Air Force Band of Flight ensured the evening's emphasis on patriotism and national heritage. 
The concert which was. attflnded by local firefighters and police officers was a tribute to true American heroes. 
"Once we were told our heroes were sport athletes, or silver screen stars, or that they had to be on stage. In the last few weeks, we have realized who the true American hero is. They are the firefighters, policemen and rescue workers," conductor Major Alan Sierichis said. 
Next, the band played "The Star Spangled Banner" which roused the crowd to stand and sing together. 
The concert also featured the soloist, Staff Sgt. Lawrence Wiley, on the trum­pet during the contemplative tune "Prayer ofSaint Gregory". 
The first set ended ,vith the Russian composer Tschaikovsky's, "Overture of 1812," which is in honor of our nation's \\inning battle. 

\Vhilc the Air Force Band of Flight's programs usually include many American songs it ordinarily also includes a varied repertoire of classical symphonies, Broadway show tunes or popular contemporary music. The pro­gram was changed in light of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
The concert ended with "God Bless America" and a medley of the different military anthems, from the Coast Guard 
'J to the Marines, and ending with the Air Force melody. Th,~ UnitPd Statf~s Air Force Band of Flight is stationed in Dayton. Ohio and is on active duty as full-time performing musicians. The concert was sponsored by the

Master Plan takes form, financing 
By NOREEN GILLESPIE 
News Writer 
The Saint Mary's Board of 
Trustees Friday voted to seek tem­
porary financing for the Master Plan 
student center and dining hall con­
struction, as well as bid the project 
to potential contractors. 
The weekend was critical for 
determining whether or not to move 
ahead with the next steps in the 
multi-year campus development 
project, according to Keith Dennis, 
vice president for finance and 
administration. 
The Master Plan, proposed in 
1999, is a decade-long, $76 million 
building initiative that includes 
plans to expand parking, add the 
student center and dining hall 
building, add a new classroom 
building and apartment-style hcms­
ing. The Collegn built thn Welconrn 
Center in 2000 and renovated 
Hegina Hall under the plan. 
"This weekend would have bmm a 
time if the Board was really nervous 
about moving ahead with the plan. 
they vvotild have said [stop]," Dennis 
said. 
The finance committee met 
Thursday afternoon to discuss 
financial options for the construc­
tion of the student center and dining 
hall building, which is projectod to 
cost $18.5 million. The building will 
include dining facilities, studtrnt 
government offices, yearbook and 
newspaper offices, the camp us 
bookstore and a post office. Officials 
hope to set a groundbreaking date 
for ApriL 
The College has confirmed $13 million in pledges for the project, and the Board encouraged fundrais­ing to continue, Dennis said. 
The board gave its permission for the College to apply for temporary financing through the Indiana Education Facility Authority. a gov­ernmental association that issues bond anticipation notes for non­profit institutions. The College could apply for up to $18.5 million in notes from the organization, Dennis said, since the College will receive fundraising money in annual incre­ments. 
The Board will vote at its February meflting on whetht1r or nol to issue College bonds for the pro­ject. Ttw College would pay back the notes from tlw IEFA when tlw bond market improves, Dennis said. 
Kim Jensen, Board of Governance executive treasurer who sits on the finance committee, said the trustees were optimistic about the project. 
"They seemed very confidnnt about Saint Mary's abilities to go forth with this project," Jensen said.

The war outside the 
Stadium 
The conflict I am speakng of does not involve cruise missles landing on foreign soil in order to eradicate a cowardly an elusive terrorist enemy. No, the battleground is much more familiar. The setting is a soccer field with a radio tower that is trans­formed into tailgaters central for every home football game here in Notre Dame, Ind.

Editor

is commonly referred, for a morning of revelry and drink­ing oriented activities. This is tailgating; a practice that has characterized not only Notre Dame football games, but sporting events around the country. 
Saturday was a miserabley wet day. Even more recognizable than the weather was the military presence up and down the rows of cars. The securi­ty/police were there not so much as a deterant to anyone who might have terrorist tendencies toward the university and its fans. But rather to crack down on underage drinking and public intoxication. Officers on foot, riding horses, undercover and in cars patrolled the rows of students in an effort to curtail the controlled bedlam that has characterized this area. 
Notre Dame football games are a chance for every­one to let their hair down and relax. The students and the thousands of fans who travel to Notre Dame and South Bend for an afternoon of athletic prowess and good hearted merriment come because it's Saturday, and most everyone has had a difficult week and the day of letting off steam has finally come. 
Drinking is part of tailgating; a big part and while I do not condone fighting or the brash disresprct that women endure when their male counterparts do not know when to say when, the majority of the stu­dent body conducts themselves in a somewhat calm and respectuful manner. Without tailgating there would be no elaborate stories of perfuse yaking or unbeleivable craziness on Monday. 
If handing out tickets and arresting tailgaters would prevent just one person from driving under the influence than I am all for it. But most students live on campus and would rather have root canal than endure the traffic horrors that follow a football game. Even those who live off campus know that it is faster and safer to walk home. 
The real threat to our way of tailgating is the limi­tations that have been placed on it in recent games. Students need to relax, especially Domers. We work diligently during the school week. We go to church on Sunday, and we give of oursleves unconditional­ly. Home football games are an opportunity to harass opposing fans, smash beer cans, engage in mass shotgunnings and raise a subdued hell across the street from our school. 
ND security and other law enforcement agencies have declared war on tailgating. The decision for this crackdown comes directly from the Notre Dame administration. The question I pose to this group is, "What, as students, have we done wrong to warrant this type of attack on our day of rest?" The Dean's List has been raised for freshmen and parietals have been strigently increased through tireless efforts, but we still fear the reprocutions of throw­ing a few back in a safe atmosphere close to home. 
In essence, tailgating is a necessary evil that Domers have indulged since the beginning of Notre Dame's football prominence. Take that away from us and students will no doubt let their steam off in a much more violent and destructive manner.

Members of Antioch Community Church in Waco, Texas, are hopeful that two church members detained in Afghanistan will be released this week, Antioch Senior Pastor Jimmy Seibert said Monday. Baylor University graduates Dayna Curry, 29, and Heather Mercer, 24, were arrested on Aug. 3 by Afghanistan's ruling Taliban government on charges that they were preaching Christianity. Seibert said the renewed hope comes after two weekend appearances by the wom­en's lawyer before the Taliban supreme court. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Eliza Koch said the lawyer, Atif Ali-Kahn, formally presented a response to the Taliban's indictment of the women on Saturday. The lawyer also met with court oflicials Sunday, Koch said. "Mr. Ali-Kahn does not expect any decision before the beginning of this week at the earliest," Koch said. "Mr. Ali-Khan also met with all the detainees twice, Saturday and Sunday, before depart­ing Kabul.

Speakers dedicate Malloy Hall 
By SCOTT BRODFUEHRER 
Assist~nt News Editor 
This wPek an acadPmic sympo­sium fnaturing four nationally known speakers will celebrate not only the 1ww of'fic,~ building for the Philosophy and Theology depart­ments. Malloy Hall. but also the excellence of tlw departnrnnts. 
"It is important to see [Malloy I !all I not just as a building, but as a celebration of tlw philosophy and tlwology departments. Th<~ building is a symbol of the dc~part­ments' academic presence," said associate provost and vice prnsi­dent Father John Jenkins. 
The symposium will begin at 
4:15 p.m. today with a talk titled "The Prophetic Hole of Theology in the Catholic University" by Father Gustavo Gutierrez. the University's John Cardinal O'Hara professor of theology. At 7 p.m. Father Ernan McMullin, who has been a Notre Dame professor since l 954, will speak about "Searching for Consonance." 
On Thursday at 10 a.m., Bas van Fraassen, Princeton University's Mc:Cosh professor of philosophy will give a talk tiW~d "Questions I Would Like to Ask." Philosophy department chair Paul Wfiithman said van Fraassen is "one of the most distinguished English speak­ing philosophPrs" and a practicing Homan Catholic. 
The Symposium will conclude on Thursday at 2 p.m. with a talk. 
"University  Theology  in  the  
Catholic  Context"  given  by  
Cardinal  Avery  Dulles,  the  

Laurence J. McGinlcy Professor of Heligion and Society at Fordham Univcrsitv. All events will be held in the a·uditorium of McKenna I I all. 
Speakers will receive an hon­orary Notre Dame degree at 4 p.m. Thursday. According to Jenkins, the practice of giving symposium speakers honorary diplomas is not unusual; it was done at sympo­siums celebrating the dedication of Notre Dame's academic buildings in the study-abroad programs fc>r London and Dublin. 
Wcithman hopes many students, faculty and community members will take advantage of the oppor­tunity to hear the distinguished speakers. 
"The talks will, I expect, be scholarly talks, but there should be something in the talks for everyone," said Weithman. 
University President Father Edward Malloy will celebrate a dedication mass for the building at 4 p.m. friday in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart and will dedicate the building at 5:45 p.m. The building was named Malloy Hall at the request of Donald Keough. whose $13.9-million dollar donation fu ndcd the construction of the building.

Holy Cross appoints new hall director 
By NATALIE BAILEY 
News Writer 
After nearly a month of classes, Holy Cross 
llall now has a permanent hall director. 
Jaillenc Erickson started her duties Sept. 24 after being hired to replace Dana North in early September. 
North. director of Resident's Life, acted as the temporary hall director. 
"So far Jaillene is doing a good job. She is picking up stuff quickly and asking good questions," North said. 
Erickson is a native of Atlanta, Ga and graduated from Taylor University in May of 2001 with a degree in communication studies. 
She looks forward to meeting all of the stu­dents and fulfilling her new position.

The job description includes upkeep and maintenance of the hall, advising the resident advisors and hall councils and acting as a mem­ber of the Judicial Board and Resident Life staff. Erickson is confident about her abilities to succeed as the hall director.

me the value of giving and serv­
ing others," she said. 
Besides her normal duties, 
Erickson is looking to imple­
ment some new things. 
Although everything is still in 
the planning stage. she has a 

main goal. 
"I hope to incorporate leader­ship development into the activi­ties that we will do," Erickson said. 
Erickson invites students to come into her office and get to know her.

"It's not a different disease to treat, except that if the spores are in the lungs by the time [the anthrax is diagnosed]. you basically already have so much damage to the tissue, you still are going to have a very high mortality rate," said Cole. 
Cole said that while anthrax poses a great threat to people who come in contact with it, there are other related organ­isms that can do equally as harmful damage to the body. It is not likely, however, that anyone has enough resources to develop biological warfare that could kill mass popula­tions, Cole said. 
"It's going to be very difficult for someone to grow sufficient quantities," said Cole. "At some point we just have to pray that no one will develop the means or intent to do what is potentially possible with the organism. After a certain point t h e · r e wouldn't be a

worst thing tional rules people in the government professor that every­
U.S. can do is panic in reac­tion to the potential biological warfare threat posed by the recent anthrax cases.. 
"This will have serious impli­cations for how fast and how wide the current war will go," said Lindley who specializes in international relations, foreign policy and security studies. "However, there is a lot that we do not know." 
Referring to the threats of biological warfare that abor­tion clinics, Catholic schools, nightclubs and other institu­tions have received in the past, Lindley said that the anthrax case is more of a danger because of the real cases in New York, Florida and Washington, D.C. The events related to the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon have put many Americans on edge. 
"There've been recent peri­ods where there have been daily anthrax threats," said Lindley. "The bad news is after years of threats, the anthrax is real." 
Like Cole, Lindley stressed that anthrax would not likely kill mass amounts of people because of the lack of sophisti­cated resources to store large quantities of the bacteria. 





WSJ editorial writer to speak on campus 
Special to the Observer 

William McGurn, chief editorial writer of The Wall Street Journal an? a graduate of Notre Dame, will make presentations Thursday and Friday [Oct. 18 and 19] at the Mendoza College of Business on cam­
pus. 

As a part of the O'Hara Lecture Series in Business Ethics, McGurn \\ill~deliver a talk titled "The Economist and the Preacher: The Gospel of Freedom Meets the Dismal Science" at 4:30 p.m. Thursday in the 
college's Jordan Auditorium. The series is sponsored by Notre Dame's Center for Ethics and Religious Values in Business. 
McGurn also will make a presentation titled "The Relevance of Just­War Principles after Sept. 11" at 12:30 p.m. Friday in 339 Mendoza. 
"People often think chemical and biological weapons are absolutely deadly. In fact, far more often, they turn out not to kill, but to injure or have no effect," said Lindley. 
He proposed that the public becomes more aware at the local level where, according to Lindley, there has been less of a focus on the problem. 
"As citizens we have to make sure that money gets thrown at this problem," Lindley said. "The facts warrant concern but not panic by any means." 
Incorporating a broader sense of responsibility, govern­ment professor Robert Johansen said that security against potential threats to society should be a collabora­tive duty of all nations. 
"The U.S. cannot provide security for the people of the 
U.S. by itself. It requires a worldwide effort," Johansen said. 
A specialist in United Nations peacekeeping, Johansen said the nation has taken for grant­ed its domestic safety, but the recent attacks and anthrax threats show that the U.S. can only protect itself if it works 
with other nations to 
body on 
e a r t h obeys," said Johansen. "We have not been working multi­laterally until Sept. 11. We've assumed that we could solve the problems by ourselves." 
Johansen's recommenda­tions involve watching out for domestic problems, but also exercising international inspections. 
"In the short run, we need to exert every precaution about receiving mail that might have suspicious [materials], but that will not address the problem in the long run," said Johansen. 
"The collaboration is neces­sary even though its different because there is no way to protect against this war with­out having intrusive forms of international inspection." 
However, even with interna­tional involvement, Johansen did say that individuals should be on guard about the serious implications ofanthrax. 
"I think we should exercise every reasonable precaution because something very unusual is happening because cases of anthrax have not hap­pened like this in recent histo­ry," said Johansen.

KABUL 
U.S. strikes set Red Cross warehouses afire near Afghanistan's capital Tuesday, sending workers scrambling to salvage des­perately needed relief goods during a bombard­ment that could be heard 30 miles away. 
To the south, two U.S. special forces gunships entered the air war for the first time, raking the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar with cannon and heavy machine gun lire in a pre-dawn raid. 
Heavy, round-the-clock attacks and the first use of the lumbering, low-flying AC-130 gunships signaled 
U.S. confidence that 10 days of attacks by cruise missiles and high-flying jets have crippled the air defenses of the Taliban, the Muslim militia that rules most of Afghanistan. 
U.S.-led forces have used more than 2,000 bombs and missiles since opening the attacks Oct. 7, Lt. Gen. Gregory Newbold, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Pentagon news con­ference. The past two days' attacks have been especially intense, putting more than 100 warplanes and five cruise missiles into the air, he said. 
Tuesday's strikes were mostly against military installations and airports around Kabul. Kandahar and the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, on which the Afghan opposition claims its forces are clos­ing in. 
Afternoon raids in the Kabul area were so strong that the detonations could be heard 30 miles north of the city, where Taliban forces are battling Afghan fighters for the opposition northern alliance. 
During the afternoon raids, at least one bomb exploded in the compound of the International 
Committee of the Hed Cross at Khair Khana near Kabul, injuring one security guard and setting two of the seven buildings on fire. 
A fgha n s taffers ran through thick smoke and flames to try to salvage blankets, tents and plastic tarps meant to help Afghans through the win­t.er. The other warehouse, which was also damaged by fire, contained wheat, Red Cross workers said. 
The Pentagon acknowl­edged that U.S. bombs accidentally hit warehous­es in Kabul used by the International Committee of the Red Cross.

WASHINGTON 
The Bush administration is pushing the Senate to con­firm its pick for the State Department's top Latin Amer-ican position somone denounced by a key Democrat as unqualified for the job. 
Otto Reich topped the list of 18 nominees Secretary of State Colin Powell said he would like to see confirmed before the Senate adjourns for the year. Congress' recess may begin in November. 
Powell submitted the list in a letter dated Monday to Sen. Jesse Helms, H-N.C., the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
A hearing on Reich's nomi­nation as a<,sistant secretarv for Western Hemisphere Affairs has been held up while Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., looks into Reich's work as a State Department official, an ambassador to Venezuela in the 1980s and a lobbyist. 

At State, Reich headed an office accused of running ille­gal domestic propaganda efforts against Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista govern­ment. In recent years, Reich has lobbied for companies with interests in Latin America, notably Bacardi Inc. 
Dodd, who chairs Foreign Relations' Western Hemisphere subcommittee, said in a letter to the Wall Street Journal last week that Reich "is not qualified for the post."

President praises youth for donations

Bush made no mention of the raids, in which at least one bomb exploded in the com­pound of the International Committee of the Red Cross at Kabul. injuring one security guard and setting two of the seven buildings on fire. 
The Pentagon acknowledged later that U.S. bombs acciden­
tally hit the Red Cross warehouses. A Navy F/A­18 Hornet dropped 1,000-pound bombs on the warehouses, the state­ment said. 
The ware­house com­plex con­tained wheat, blankets, led military campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan. 
Bush said that since his call for donations, the White House has received 90,000 letters. He said the American Hed Cross and the U.S. Agency for International Development are channeling the money to needy Afghan youths. The adminis­tration said it was impossible to say how much money had been sent. 
"Winter arrives early in Afghanistan. It's cold, really cold, and the children need warm clothing and they need medicines," Bush said. "And thanks to the American chil­dren, fewer children in Afghanistan will suffer this win­ter." 
Nearly 100 children stood behind Bush as he spoke, as did a placard advertising the fund. It depicted two smiling Afghan children. Bush singled out for special praise Kristen Strickland of Philomont, Va., who raised $45 by feeding 
chickens.

As Bush waded into the crowd of children for a group photo, many of them held up one-dollar bills. Children pressed bills into the presi­dent's hand, and he promptly passed them to Bernadine Healy. president of the American Red Cross.

House works on laundering bill 
Associated Press 
\NASHINGTON 
The I louse is working on a mea­sure expanding the government's power to cut money flows to ter­rorist networks amid protests by key senators over the legislation being stripped from President Bush's anti-terrorism package. 
The bill, supported by the White Ilouse, is intended to fight money laundering around the world, thwart the financing of terrorism and protect the U.S. banking sys-tern from illicit money. It would give the treasury secretary authority to requirn special record keeping and reporting rules for American banks and other finan­cial institutions and would make it a crime to smuggle more than $10,000 over U.S. borders. 



In the Senate, the anti-mont1y­laundering measure is attached to the countfwterrorism legislation sparklld by the Sept. 11 attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 
The House and Senate both have passed versions of the popu­lar anti-tnrrorism legislation. But the House version does not con­tain tho money laundering provi­sions, a separation which "could be the death warrant for strong anti-money-laundering legisla­tion," Sen. Carl Levin. D-Mich .. told reporters Tuesday. 
There is potentially "a lot of mischief to be played" with stand­alone money laundering legisla­tion in negotiations for a compro­mise between Ilouse and Senate lawmakers, said Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.

AUSTRALIA 
Premier: Austrcllia to deploy troops 
Associated Press 
CANBERRA 

Australia will begin deploy­ing troops and military hard­ware to the Persian Gulf over the next two weeks to join the U.S.-led coalition against ter­rorism, Prime Minister John Howard said Wednesday. 
Howard said the deployment was order after a telephone request by overnight from President Bush. 
"This marks of course a sig­nificant further stage in the involvement of Australian mil­itary personnel and the Australian people in this war against terrorism." Howard told reporters. 
"Our forces will be overseas fighting in our name within a very short period of time," he said. 
Howard said and exact deployment date had not been set, but the first troops and equipment could begin leaving within the next two weeks. He said the full Australian contri­bution would be in position by mid-November. 
Howard has pledged a detachment of 150 Special Air Services troops, two B707 tanker refueling aircraft, two P3 long-range maritime planes, two navy frigates, one amphibious command ship and four F/A-18A fighter jets. 
The SAS troops are Australia's elite commandos, trained to operate in small 
· groups behind enemy lines. The total number of person­nel committed is 1,550.

Terrorist attacks affect Americans abroad 
Everybody knows where they saw or heard about the events of Sept.11 . 
I was walking back to my village after watching girls play basketball. The Peace Corps car intercepted me and the American in the car straightforwardly Maite Uranga said, 'Tm sure you heard what hap­pened in the United States today." Many Life in Africa possil;>le scenarios raced through my head and sadly my imagination did not even come close to the horror of the reality. 
The American gave me a piece of paper Peace Corps wanted every volun­teer to have as confirmation that every­one knew. A brief summary said, "Earlier today the United States experi­enced apparent terrorist attacks. Other attacks are possible. Peace Corps wants all volunteers to stay where they are." 
In retrospect, my reaction was noncha­lant and I think that is largely due to the calmness of the Peace Corps representa­tive. 
After this five minute encounter, I con­tinued to walk back to my village, mak­ing small talk with people and in no real hurry to find out further details. I went to my neighbor's house and played with her children for a while. Eventually I asked the boys next door if I could bor­row their radio. I found the BBC fre­quency. 
My life changed. The world as I knew disappeared. 
In utter disbelief I listened to "Bush is in Nebraska ... Cheney is in the \,Vhite House bunkers ... the military is patrolling the East Coast ... Washington is empty ... the World Trade Center is gone ... the Pentagon is on fire ... all air­planes are grounded ... the Mexican and 
LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Canadian borders are closed." 
Bin Laden emerged very early as the main suspect. Radicals started calling the BBC and Voice of America declaring, "a war on Islam ... the beginning of' the 
next Crusades ... a demand for swift and 
deliberate action against the Muslim 
countries harboring bin Laden." 
The sun was setting outside my room 
and I heard the call to the mosque and 
saw all my neighbors stop to face Mecca 
and pray. An unease overcame me and 
I asked myself how well I really knew 
these people. I arrived in my village only 15 days before Sept. 11. It was pitch 
black outside and there were no Americans. I closed my door and contin­
ued to listen for any piece of information that would tell me the answers. I desper­ately wanted to talk to my family and friends or any American. I wrote in my journal. I went to sleep that night not knowing what state America and the world would be in when I woke up. More importantly I did not know how my vil­lage would react to me, an American who just came into their lives. 
The next morning the nightmare on the radio continued and eventually I left the safety of my room. People immedi­ately started asking me if my family and friends lived in New York or Washington. They told me to call my parents and friends and tell them that Toulde was hurt by events in the United States. 
The university students and I com­pared and contrasted the Voice of America and the BBC with French and Senegalese radio. The elders of the com­munity, who most likely could not identi­fy the location of the United States on a world map, expressed their sympathies and gave their prayers. I tried to relay the depressed and heartbroken state of America to my work counterpart's hus­band and he corrected me and said, "It is the whole world, not just UnitPd States." 
After my initial fears the first night, I have never felt the slightest bit threat­ened or unsafe. In some ways I feel more safe in my Muslim village in an Islamic republic than I would in some places in the United States. 
On th(} other hand, I wish I could talk to my family and friends on a more regu­lar basis. I still have yet to read any American magazines or newspapers concerning the attacks. I have only watched television once. Some days I seek out Americans and even if we do not talk about it much there is an under­standing b{~tween us the Mauritanians cannot understand. 
My Mauritanian friends' and neigh­bors' lives carry on as normal and are really not at all affected by this world changing event. 
For me much changed. I realize that my life is in continual flux and may br for the remaining two years I am here. For the first time my daily life is depen­dent on American diplomacy and international relations. Some days I mentally prepare to stay here for two years and other days I prepare to go back to the United States. 

I only know about the United States from the radio, but I have no idea what it is like to live there now. I can never return to the home I left only four and a half months ago.

Rallying for life after tragedy 
I am writing in response to Natalie Hock's letter pub­lished Monday, entitled "Hight to life not about abortion." 
She· asks why "no one ever speaks about the issue of Hight to Lifers who bomb abortion clinics. killing people in the name of life, in the name of God." The people who kill others while claiming that they are "Right-to-Lifers" are not pro-life. 
"Muslim" terrorists blaspheme their God, Allah, by claiming that killing those of other religions and cultures is following Allah's plan. Similarly, "Hight-to-Lifers" who kill those who work at abortion clinics pervert the pro-life movement. These people should not call themselves pro­life just as terrorists should not call themselves Muslim. 
Hock proceeded to criticize her parish priest for bringing up the issue of abortion on Respect Life Sunday. She "found it interesting, that in this time of inner compassion and strength, we could talk about issues that further

divide people and manage to act as if the world isn't changing around us." 
flock missed the bigger picture that Sunday morning. The American people are devastated by the over 6,000 lives lost on Sept. 11. Sadly, many Americans ignore the fact that 4,400 people lose their lives every day through abortion. This tragedy should be a wake-up call; the dev­astation of abortion is depleting our generation. 
At this time, our nation is rallying for life. This move­ment should unite us as we show the world that we respect life -all life, from conception until natural death.

OK, glad to have goW-m that out of' the way. Now, why would a person writing for tlw Viewpoint portion of The Observer 
, shamelessly call attention to an occasion as frivolous as his birthday like this? To prove a point, of course. (After all, this is not Seem~. this is Viewpoint. Someone might read it.) 
This year's birthday is different from years past. It is the end-all. be-all, party until you throw up, act like a cretin, be a rock star bash of all bashes. It is the illus­trious 21st birthday we are talking about. 
Twenty-one years have passed me by in this life. 21 years of good times, bad times, baby food, being dressPd by my parents, ridicule, embarrassment, tri­umph. peanut butter and jelly. wearing a uniform. driving a gold '86 Ford Tempo, trying to survive college and wondering what I am going to do ,vith the rest of my allotted time here on the planet. 
And finally, after a 21-year old stress ball the size of a cantaloup(~ has formed on the back of my neck, I can have my first beer. I can enter my first bar. I can go into a liquor store and supply alcohol for minors. 
After watching older friends 
and relatives do this for years, my time has finally come. I won­der what it will be like tast­ing alcohol for the first time? Oh, I hope I don't throw up. I wonder what it will be like to walk into a bar and look

The point of this 
rather long introduction to this column is that I'm starting to think that my 21st birthday is going to be a bit of a bust. Sure, I'll be legal now, but so what? All that stuff from before was a lie. For the past three years, I've used a fake ID. 
I know, I'm sorry. 
The thing is, though, it's just not that big of a deal. I would almost welcome an analogy about snacking and spoiling my dinner here, but it just wouldn't fit. The truth is a lot of underage college students use false identification and even more drink alcohol illegally. Everybody does it and no one, except Bill Kirk, cares. (And he only drn~s if you're at a studPnt-nm tailgate.) 
The 21st birthday is almost as a big of a scare as much as anything else. It is kind of fun using false identification. It's like 
you're a secret agent or something. You give the bouncer the ID that says you're 26. three inches shorter and 20 pounds heavier and look at him as if to say. "Haven't I really pulled myself together since my 16th birthday? Now, reward me by

1/ _Yes, Mr. Bouncer, sir, , I'm just escorting these younger chaps out to the 
bar. I won't be out Jong, I have to get home to see the missus before the late news comes on." 
Remember when everyone was under­age and when one person got rejected the whole team, even members who were already in, had to retreat and go else­where, basically admitting to the bouncer that, yes, we had used fake IDs, and, yes, you didn't catch us? 
Those were the days. 
I'll admit it will be nice to be guaran­te(~d entrance to the bar and access to th,~ cocktails. It'll be nice tn not have to be the only one of my friends who isn't 21 and has to worry about being denied from the bar. These things are all very good. 
But I can't help but feel like something's going to be different now. I feel like it's the end of an era or something. My youth is over. I'm legal now. 
There are no legal binds that can stop me from the almighty cocktail. Pretty soon it will stop being socially acceptable (and encouraged) for me to even have more than a few cocktails and act silly with friends. 
So, tonight, I'm going to go out and do something I've done for three years. 
Only, this time and all times to come, I'll be completely and utterly allowed to do so. Adulthood looms ahead on the horizon for me and for all of us. 
Tonight will be just another stride towards that looming beast. \Von't you join me at the bar for a cocktail so we can hopefully forget all about it?

This traitorous act, executed last Thursday night. was ironically titled the "Strengthening and Uniting America Act," and its 99 conspirators are all members of the United States Senate. Ninety-six of them voted in favor of this decidedly anti-American bill, and three abstained from voting against it. Only Wisconsin senator Russ FPingold, perhaps learning from the mistakes of his state's most infamous former senator, found the wisdom to vote against it. 
The bill is not trnasonous in giving away secrets to the enemy or putting \merican lives in danger; it is actually designed to dot he opposite. But. in this way, the treach­ery of the bill is much worse. It does not directly attack American citizens but rather the founding principles under which they live. It is a betrayal of Madison, Jefferson and I lamilton. the Constitution and the Bill of High ts. It is a bPtrayal of the very ideals that define our nation. and thus it b()comes an attack far more danger­ous to the existence of America as we know it than any terrorist action. 
The "Uniting and Strengtlrnning America Act" includes provisions that allow the government to conduct search­es of hornes and oflices, computers files and desk draw­ers for any investigation without notification.

Reality television from the Dome 
There are a lot of reality TV shows out there. Too many, say some people.

I'm going to throw out some ideas for the networks, and maybe I'll sell a script and get paid. 
"Survivor -Bob Davie Edition" 
This show consists of a single episode. Bob Davie tries to outlast, outwit, and outplay himself to keep his job. But then Bob loses the immunity challenge, failing to cor­rectly diagram a pass to the tight end. Bob protests, saying that the tight end isn't an actual position. Kevin White reaches into the box and pulls out a piece of paper that says "Bob." Rob leaves the tribal council. You could do it in like 30 seconds between a SuperDoppler commercial and a Wonder Y(~ars rerun. 
"Fear Factor -Tailgating Special" 
This show would feature Joe Rogan out at radio tower field, cheering on six contestants as they try to drink beer and eat brats without catching the eye of the authorities. Contestants struggle to keep track of Bill Kirk between SUVs and try to discover who's the under­cover cop. Then they act like they don't go to Notre Dame by saying "du Lac? What's that, Spanish or some­thing?" and "What's a tailgater?" and "Bob Davie still coaches here?" 
"Big Brother -Dining Hall Lady Edition" 
Nothing escapes the watchful eye of Big Brother, and nobody's going to be taking a second piece of fruit from the dining hall with these highly-trained security opera­tives around. Watch as the Dining Hall ladies kick butt and take names, all in the name of Food Services.

NHL 
Peterson hat trick hands Kehoe debut win 
Associated Press 
PITI'SBURGH 

Mario Lemieux's newest line­mate had a big night, and it got Lemieux's very first linemate his initial NHL coaching victory. 
Pitl'-iburgh rookie Toby Petersen had three goals in his first game on Lemieux's line and the previ­ously winless Penguins won coach Rick Kehoe's debut. beating the Ottawa Senators 5-2. 
"We wanted to win this for the new coach-and for each other," Petersen said. "The guys definitely were pretty excited with the new coach. It was pretty sweet for me. too, because never in a million years did I expect this. I just want­ed to make sure I didn't embar­rass myself." 
Robert Lang had two goals. one short-handed and the other on a power play. as the Penguins scored four goals on nine shot.i:; in the second period -three set up by Lemieux for his first points of the season. 
Lemieux was held without a goal for the ninth consecutive game dating to last season. but his three assists followed two score­less games. He missed two others with a hip injury. 
"When I saw him take off on a breakaway, I said to myself, 'That's a real good sign,' " l\ehoe said of Lemieux. who was clearly off his game previously because of the hip injury. 
Johan Hedberg had his first strong game in goal since la.c;t sea­son's playoffs, turning aside Marian Hossa on a penalty shot in the first period and stopping 17 of 18 shots in the second period alone while making 37 saves. Ottawa was O-for-7 on the power play. 
The Penguins' 0-4 start tied their 1983-84 team for the worst in franchise history. Coach Ivan Hlinka was fired following a 4-1 loss Sunday in Buffalo in which the Penguins looked disorganized and disinterested. 
Kehoe, a Penguins assistant coach or player for 27 of their 35 seasons, emphasized a return to the team's familiar uptempo offense during his first practice Monday, and the Penguins responded. 
"I didn't know what to expect. really," said Kehoe. the third-lead­ing scorer in Penguins history behind Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr. "I was a little nervous. for sure. because the players needed to win badly. It's a good start, but we still have a lot of work to do." 
And how's this for coincidence: Kehoe, who played briefly on Lemieux's line at the start of Lcmieux·s rookie season in 1984­85 until getting hurt, wore No. 17 -the same number Petersen now wears. 
The Penguins didn't take long to follow Kehoe's advice as Petersen scored 30 seconds into the game. He got his stick on the puck as it scooted under goalie Patrick Lalime's pads during a scramble in front of the net. 
Detroit 4, Columbus 3 
Once the Columbus Blue Jackets got out of their own end of the ice, they nearly stole a victory from the Detroit Red Wings. 
Trailing by three goals with a little more than eight minutes remaining, Columbus (()-2-4) got third-period goals from Tyler \Nright and Deron Quint on just four shots -but fell short in a loss. 
"I think. the last eight or nine minutes. we came out and made the game a game," Columbus coach Dave King said. "The first 10 minutes of the third period, I thought we were in a half-court basketball game." 
Wright came in off the left side and put a shot over Dominik Hasek at 11 :38. while Quint sent a screened shot through Hasek's pads from along the left boards with 6:27 left. 
"We're not happy with our hockey game, obviously," Detroit's Mathieu Dandenault said. "You get two goals like that in the third period, that's a no-no." 
Luc Robitaille (5-1) gave Detroit a 2-0 lead at 6:53 of the second period when he put the rebound of a Jiri Fischer shot in from the bottom of the left circle. 
But Columbus closed within 2-1 while on a 5-on-3 power play at 
11 :06 when rookie Rostislav Klesla beat Hasek high on the stick side with a slap shot from the top of the left circle. 
But [)andenault restored Detroit's two-goal lead with 3:48 left in the period when his wrist shot from the right circle beat Marc DenLi:; high. 
"You can't play 50 minutes against Detroit and expect to win," Wright said. 
It was the 100th point of Dandenault's NHL career and his first goal of the season. 
Sergei Fedorov scored at 6:1:1 of the third period to give Detroit a 4-1 lead. 
"That's not the way we like to play," Fedorov said. "We weren't very good at .the end with the game on the line." 
The Red Wings took a 1-0 lead with 4:01 left in the first period when Brendan Shanahan drilled a one-timer from the slot past Denis. 
Shanahan has eight goals and leads the NHL with 11 point.c;. Ile is also tied with the New York Islanders' Mark Parrish for the league lead in goals. 
Minnesota 3, San Jose 3 
The Minnesota Wild are no longer satisfied with a tie at home. 
Minnesota. off to the best start for a second-year team, saw its fourth win of the season slip away when Mike Ricci's power-play goal with 2:32 left in regulation lifted the San Jose Sharks into a tie. 
The Sharks trailed 3-1, but Hicci and Mark Smith scored to help San Jose avoid il'-i first regulation loss this season. 
"It's important for us to get a lead like we did, but we're disap­pointed that we didn't win this game," said left wing Marian Gaborik, whose three-point night was a career best. "\Ve 've got to be stronger when we have a lead." 
Gaborik had a goal and two assists for the Wild, who remain the only unbeaten team in the Western Conference at 3-0-3. 
Minnesota, which opened the season vVith a scoreless tie in San Jose. got second-period goals from Jim Dowd and Antti Laaksonen. 
The tying goal came with under three minutes to play when Gary Suter's shot from the blue line went off of Hied and sailed past goalie Dwayne Holoson. 
"The guys on the out."iidc made a great play to get it back to the point. and (Suter) got it through," Ricci said. "It's easy for the guys in front of the net. We've just got to try to touch it." 
Gaborik. the \Vild's first draft pick, got Minnesota on the board early -redin~cting a Jim Dowd shot between the pads of Rvgeni Nabokov for his second goal. 
San Jose tied it 1-1 late in the 
first when Niklas Sundstrom beat 
Roloson for his first goal. 

"We had a lot of spark early. then we sat back a bit and they took over," Sharks captain Owen Nolan said. "They got a couple of goals to deflate us. and then we got our ~~~t together and got back on track. 
The Wild reverted to their nor­mal defensive ways in the second period, limiting San Jose to just three shot.<, on goal while building a two-goal lead. 
Dowd capped off a passing play by tapping in a shot from the top of the crease to put Minnesota back in front. Later. Antti Laaksoncn scored his first goal of the season after taking a pass from Gaborik. 
The Sharks wBrc forced to kill 
two penalties early in the third 
period. but pulled within a goal

NATIONAL LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES 
Johnson ends slump, wins battle of aces 
Associated Press 
PIIOENIX 
With icy ('aim and magnific1~nt heat. 
Handy Johnson burird his reputation 
as a postscason flop. 
In a matchup of pitchers who together have seven Cy Young Awards and 457 victories, Johnson threw a thrc(!-hit mastcrph~cc as the Arizona Diamondbacks beat Greg Maddux and the Atlanta Braves 2-0 in Game 1 of the National League championship series. 
Johnson struck out 11 and walked one to snap his major league-record sevPn-gamt) losing streak in the post­season. 
"Assuming sonwo1w might say here 'Is this a monkf~Y off your back?' This is mon' lik<' a gorilla," Johnson said with his young son beside him in the interview room. "King Kong." 
Chipprr Jones, a longtime nemesis of Johnson, had two of Atlanta's hits to improvl' to 11-for-25 with six homers in his career of the Big Unit. Jones barely beat out a sharp line drive off the glove of a. leaping Matt Williams at third base with t\-vo outs in thf~ first inning. 
Aftnr that. Johnson retired 20 in a row before walking B1~rnard Gilkey on four pitches with one out in thn eighth. 
"We all know what Handy is capable of on a given day. and this was one of those given days." Arizona manager Bob Brcnly said. "Ht1 went out there and pitched like the Big Unit we've all come to know and love." 
Johnson was one out away from pitching the eighth one-hitter in post­season historv when Julio Franco and Jonns singled to put runners at first and third -Atlanta's tirst runner to get into scoring position all game. 
The stage was set for morn postsca­
son heroics by Brian Jordan, but 
Johnson struck him out swinging. 
"\Ve had the right guy up. We could 
smell it coming again," Braves manag­
er Bobby Cox said, "but Handy threv.l 
him three really outstanding sliders. 
They were low, but if you're hitting, 
you're going to swing at them. It's just 
about impossible to lay off of them.· 
Craig Counsel!. one or the surprise heroes of Arizona's nail-biting division series triumph over St. Louis, had two hits and scored twice -on HBI sin­gles by Luis Gonzalez and Reggie Sanders. 
Maddux was no slouch. He allowed just two runs and six hits in seven innings, but his effort was lost in the 6-foot-10 Johnson's shadow. 
Johnson hadn't won in the playoffs since brating the Yankees tvdce in the 1995 AL division series for Seattle. He had lost his last seven decisions, induding a 4-1 defeat in Game 2 of' the first round against the Cardinals. 
Teammate Curt Schilling had been the big-game ace against St. Louis, winning 1-0 and 2-1 in two complete games. 
Usually a grimacing, shouting por­trait of intensity, Johnson was a pic­ture of gum-chewing calm except for a few bursts of emotions. 
Sanders said he knew Johnson would pitch well when he walked into the clubhouse Tuesday and found the big left-hander practicing his putting and talking with teammates. · 
"When I see a relaxed Randy like that, I know he's on top of it," Sanders said. "He's focused. There's no stress." 
Johnson had two eight-pitch innings and one seven-pitch innings, far out of character f'or a hurler whose pitch count normally soars above 100 long before the ninth inning. 
"This kind of game is more mentally draining than it is. physically drain­
ing," Johnson said, "because you real­ize if you make one mistake that could be the ball game. They had the go­ahead run up in that las-t inning. It's just nice to walk off the field and cele­brate." 
Atlanta's closest calls in the first 
eight innings were a pair of long outs 
to right field by leadoff hitter Marcus 
Giles. Sanders caught the first just in 
front of the fence to lead off the game 
and the second in front of the yellow 
home run line atop the fence to end 
the sixth. 
Johnson yelled ''No more!" at catch­
er Damian Miller. He meant that pitch 
would never be thrown to Giles again. 
A crowd of just 37,729 -12.000 short of a sellout -watched the first postseason matchup of 200-game career winners in 23 years. 
According to the Elias Sports Bureau, it happened twice in 1978 ­Steve Carlton of Philadelphia against Don Sutton of Los Angeles in Game 3 of the NLCS, and Sutton against Catfish Hunter of the Yankees in Ne\\-' York's clinching Game 6 of the \Norld Series. 
The Diamondbacks scratched out a run in the first and another in the fifth against Maddux. who is 0-3 against Arizona this season and had lost his only other showdown with Johnson back in 1998. 
Arizona gave Johnson a rare early lead. Counsell singled with one out in the first inning, then Gonzalez reached safely when his grounder scooted under the· glove of the second baseman Giles for an error. 
Sanders, 7-for-17 in the postseason, lined a single up the middle to score Counsell and make it 1-0. The score­keeper ruled it was an earned run. 
With two outs in the fifth, Counsel! doubled just past the outstretched glove of a diving Andruw Jones in cen­ter.

Braves outfielder Brian Jordan misses strike three to end the game as Arizona topped Atlanta 2-0 Tuesday. 
"You can't explain how valuable he's been," Johnson said of Counsell. "If my son's not going to be a left­handed pitcher, I'd want him to be a Craig Counsel!. He plays the game hard and plays the game right." 
The Diamondbacks got four hits off Maddux in the first two innings. but two double plays. both started by the Atlanta pitcher. minimized the dam­age. 
"Randy pitched great," Maddux said. "That was probably the best I've ever seen him change speeds. As a comple­ment, he was Jamie Moyer with a real good fastball."

ALCS 
Guillen returns to Seattle infield 
Associated Press 
SEATTLE 

Carlos Guillen's weight is nearly normal again, he's feel­ing better than he has in four months, and there's a smile on his face. 
And with Seattle's starting shortstop expected back on the roster after a fight with tuber­culosis, the Mariners feel like their true team has returned. 
Manager Lou Piniella indicat­ed he would add Guillen for the AL championship series against the New York Yankees. He was finalizing the roster Tuesday night. . 
"He seems to be smiling a lot," second baseman Bret Boone said of Guillen. 
Guillen. who is undergoing treatment for pulmonary tuber­culosis and sat out the division series against Cleveland, poten­tially could start Game 1 on Wednesday at Safeco Field. Piniella said he could use Guillen in the No. 2 spot in the batting order against left-hand­ed pitchers. and the Yankees will start lefty Andy Pettitte.

Vanderbilt opens season ranked 5th 
By ALEX KWAK Vanderbilt Hustler (U-Wire} 
NASHVILLE. Tenn. 

The Vanderbilt women's ba'iket ball team were not the only ones running drills in Memorial Gym Saturday morning. when the sea­son oflicially opened. Construction crews were working on renova tions throughout the gym during the team's first practice. 
"We play in front of 15,000 peo­ple. so a couple of guys with ham­mers better not distract us," said head coach Jim Foster. "We had a lot of intensity and a lot of enthusi­asm." 
There are a lot of expectations on this team, both from outside and within. 
The Dores are ranked fifth in the Street & Smith College Basketball Preseason poll. which has SEC rival Tennessee at sec­ond. The team was also ranked second in four polls. the Women's Basketball News Journal. Athlon Sport<;, Women's Basketball News Service and SLAM Magazine. Vandy even received a first-place. ranking in tlw Basketball News poll. Basketball News also has Vandy junior center Chantelle Anderson ,L"i the presea"ion Player of the Year.

Dan Wilson said. 
If Guillen plays. utility man Mark Mclemore could start in left field. Mclemore played shortstop in Guillen's absence. while both Stan Javier and Jay Buhner have played left in the postseason. 
Guillen, 26, did not make the road trip to Cleveland for the third and fourth games of the division series. but instead took batting practice and worked on fielding grounders over the weekend. 
"I don't worry about any­thing." Guillen said of playing again. "I have confidence in myself." 
He was diagnosed with tuber­culosis Sept. 28 and was hospi­talized. He lost 10 pounds but has gained eight back. As Alex Rodriguez's replacement, Guillen made only 10 errors in 140 games and was batting .259 with five homers and 53 HBls.

rebounding. 

"I just want to get better and help my team win a National Championship," Anderson said. 
The team is returning every player from last year's team, which finished with a 24-10 record and advanced to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament before losing to the eventual champion, Notre Dame. · 
"We have high expectations." said senior forward Zuzi Klimesova. "We just have to work our way up to the top." ­
She said that having the team playing together for much of the summer was a tremendous help toward being prepared for the season. 
"We're way ahead of last year." Anderson said. "Practicing went well and there's a sense of famil­iarity." 
Anderson said that along with the traditional preseason running and weightlifting, the team played a lot of pickup games throughout the summer and fall. 
"\Ve played on the court a lot more," Anderson said. "We're more ready than maybe we were la'it year. Wffre just so far ahead." 
Anderson said that having the frnshmen around to play in those pickup games helped teach them how to play with each other and prepared them for the first prac­tice. 
"It was exciting,'' Klimesova said. "The freshmen did really well." 
Foster said he was imprcssf'd by the play of both the transfer and freshman players.

Holmoe remains at Cal 
By MATT DUFFY 
Daily C1liforni.111 (U-Wire) 
BERKELEY, Calif. 

Cal athletic director Steve Gladstone said Mondav that Tom Holmoe will remain head coach of the Cal football team 
for the rest of the sea­son even though the Bears are off to the worst start in school history. 


Cal was Holmoe blown out 48-7 by No. 5 Oregon Saturday, drop­ping the team to 0-5 for the first time ever. Holmoe said before the season he will resign if the Bears do not advance to a bowl game. A loss against No. 4 
UCLA this Saturday -the Bears are already 28-point underdogs -would be Cal's 
sixth. and make the team ofli­cially ineligible for a bowl. 
Holmoe said Saturday that he will not resign in the middle of the season. 
With sloppy, uninspired play characterizing four of the Bears' five losses. many alumni, fans and students have called for Holmoe's immediate firing. Nobody knows that more than Gladstone, who was cautious about making specific com­ments on the current state of the program. 
"We don't want to add to the ditliculties lthat the tea.m is cur­rently going through]." Gladstone said. "We don't want to contribute to anything nega­tive. This is supporting the team, the team that Tom is the

coach of." 
Gladstone, who is also the men's crew coach, said he is looking at the situation from both the perspective of a coach and an athletic director. 
"Specifically, a<; athletic direc­tor, I don't want to be delivering messages that make the job harder for the coach,'' he said. "Let's play all the games." 
Gladstone would not make any statements on Holmoe's long-term future, saying only, "If finding a replacement comes about, we would have a plan in place and we could expeditious­ly carry out that plan." 
Sources close to the football program said that athletic department officials have draft­ed a preliminary list of head coaching candidates and are already receiving resumes for the job. 
In his fifth year as head coach. Holmoe has compiled a career record of 15-34 (.3061. The Bears have not had a win­ning season under IIolmoe and have not won the Big Game since he has been with the pro­gram. 
Holmoe briefly addressed his current situation a<; head coach after Saturday's game. 
"My responsibility as long as I am the head coach is to the team," Holmoe said. "And there's a lot of things going on with the team that's my respon­sibility. I don't see it any other way. 
"I have to do what I have to do to keep the team together, to keep them going. To try and fin­ish strong and keep their heads_ up. To finish with character. That's what my responsibility is now. To do something else would be negative for the team." 

Part of the reason for Cal's poor start is that the team ha-; played one of the toughest schedules in the nation. 
Including UCIA. every team the Bears have played is ranked in the top-25 of the latest Associated Press poll except IJlinois. which is the ftrst unranked team in this week's voting. 
'This is a very strong league," Gladstone said of the Pac-10. "Clearly we've played a very strong schedule. That said. our expectations were to play with these teams." 
Gladstone would not say Cal's poor performances this season were a result of poor coaching or a lack of effort on the part of the team. 
"Unless you walk in the shoes of the people ih that program, you can't make an intelligent statement," he said. "The ath· letic director should not be in the business ofspeculating." 
Gladstone attended a weekly meeting Monday with Cal alum­ni. Ile said one alumnus pointed out the lack of student support for llolmoe and the program. \Vhich wa'i illustrated when the Cal student section virtually left en masse at halftime of Saturday's game. 
"It would be nice if the stu­dents stayed the course with this group," Gladstone said. "I'd hope they would continuP to support the team." 
The Bears only have two home games left, Nov. 3 against Arizona and the following week against USC. 
Both teams are in the bottom half of the confernnce stand­ings, and are winnable games if the same Cal team shows up that played No. 15 \Vashington tough two wePks ago.

LSU reaches 
.... 
settle01ent 
By HEIDI CENAC The Reveille (U-Wire) 
BATON HOUGE, La. 

Five former Louisiana State University athletes will receive $37.500 each from Wednesday's settlement of a 7-year-old sexual discrimination lawsuit against the University. 
The five students sued the University. claiming the LSU Athletic Department procrastinat­ed starting women's varsity soc­cer and softball teams and did not provide equal treatment to female athletes. 
According to court documents, former Athletic Director Joe Dean allegedly referred to one of the women as "honey," "sweetie" and "cutie" in a meeting about start­ing a soccer team and said the University should consider their request because the players "would look cute running around in their soccer shorl<;." 
Dean retired after the spring 2000 semester. 
In February 2000, a court of appeals ruled the {Jniversity vio­lated Title IX. a federal law that states that no person should be excluded from any federally fund­ed program or activity on the basis of gender. 
As part of the settlement, the University also will pay more than $1 million to the two law firms representing the students. The attorney for the plaintiffs, Nancy Rafuse. could not be reached before press time. 
The payment is a compromise based on a mandate by the feder­al court after a trial case in 1996. The University's insurance, administered th~ough the Office of Hisk Management. will pay the settlement, according to LSU attorneys. 
The settlement is not an admis­sion of liability on the part of the University. but is a compromise to avoid further litigation, said David Bienvenu. an attorney for the University. 
"Litigation is expensive, uncer­tain," he said. "Enough litigation had taken place, and the parties wanted to move forward." 
The settlement requires the plaintiffs dismiss the lawsuit and any future claims against the University related to the case. 
However, the plaintiffs can seek judicial enforcement if LSU's commitment to women's athletics and the University can contest attempts if they are deemed unwarranted. 
"We are pleased the University and the plaintiffs were able to find some common ground in this case and settle the suit in an ami­cable fashion." said Chancellor Mark Emmert in a statement Wednesday. "The University has made some significant strides in supporting women's athletics during the past decade. and everyone connected to LSU is proud of the successes of all the University's sports, both men's and women's." 
Chancellor Emmert was out of town Monday and could not pro­vide further comment. 
However, Provost Daniel Fogel said the University's main con­cern is moving forward. 
"It appears to be a reasonable settlement, and we arc focused on moving forward," he said. 
One of the changes since the lawsuit was the formation of a senior women's administrator position to oversee the progress and direction of women's athlet­ics. 
Judy Southard, who serves as associate athletic director and senior women's administrator, said the position also is a liaison between LSU women's athletics and the NCAA. 
"I think over time the University posture has changed dramatically and the provisions necessary to run a top notch women's athletic program," she said. 
Southard said recent successes of the women's teams show the University's commitment to women's sports. 
For example, since its creation in 1997. the LSU softball team won five SEC division titles, three SEC championships, two SEC tournament titles and third place at the NCM College World Series. 
Athletic Director Skip Bertman, said he is glad to see the lawsuit close. 
'Tm glad it's behind us," he said. "Oflate, we've been of pretty good compliance ofTitle IX." 
The University hires govern-­ment consultants to come to t~1e campus for two to three weeks and interview coaches and administrators to give them advice on what they can do to improve the school's compliance eff orl-;, Bertman said. 
Bertman said LSU has changed since the lawsuit was filed in 1994, and he would not expect a lawsuit of this type at the University now. 
"Naturally, nobody should be discriminated against in any sense," he said. "From what I can see, all the ladies are satisfied." 
The plaintiffs of the lawsuit were unable to be reached.

Sooners switch to sophomore White 
Associated Press 
NORMAN, Okla. 

Sophomore quarterback Jason White will start Saturday when No. 2 Oklahoma plays host to Baylor, coach Bob Stoops said Monday. 
Junior Nate Hybl had started all six games for the Sooners (6-0, 3-0 Big 12), but has failed to finish the past two. He was knocked out of the Texas game Oct. 6 with an injury to his left shoulder. then was removed from the Kansas game Saturday after a lackluster performance. 
In both cases, White played well in Hybl's place. 
"Jason has earned the oppor­tunity to be the starter," Stoops said. "lie'II be the starter in this game (Baylor) and then we'll take it from there. \Ve have proven we can win with both of these quarterbacks and we feel we can be a good team with either ofthem playing." 

Stoops said the decision was made because Hybl hasn't played well, not because of any lingering effects from the injury. 
"Nate wasn't as sharp as he had been," Stoops said. "He had a sore shoulder. I think every­body saw that. Pain is difficult to gauge. I just admire the way he fought through that and tried to play." 
Hybl and White came out of spring practice and two-a-days in a virtual dead heat for the job. Stoops tabbed Hybl the starter in August saying he had outperformed White and made fewer bad plays. 
White said he never give up hope of winning the job from Hybl. 
"I wanted to push Nate to make him a better player," he said. "It just so happened that he had an injury and now I'm getting an opportunity.

NBA 
Hornets sting Celtics 
Associated Press 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. 
The short-handed Charlotte Hornets were too much for the Boston Celtics. 
The Hornets, down three key players because of injury, got 22 points from David Wesley in a 99-88 pre­season victory Tuesday night. 
Derrick Coleman continued his push for a starting spot with 13 points and 15 rebounds. Coleman, coming off the worst season of his career, has been in shape and productive throughout the preseason. 
"He was very, very active and very proficient in his rebounding," coach Paul Silas said. "He looked good." 
Baron Davis added 13 points and eight assists and 
P.J. Brown and Lee Nailon each scored l 2 points as all five Charlotte starters reached double figures. Jamaal Magloire had 12 points and nine rebounds in a reserve role. 
With Jamal Mashburn, Elden Campbell and reserve Matt Bullard all in street clothes, the Hornets used a dominating second quarter to put the Celtics away. 
Coleman subbed for Campbell at center, getting five points and five rebounds in the quarter. Afterward, he said he was more comfort­
., abJe--at power forward, but was willing to fill-in wherev­er necessary. 
"Guys go down and you 
just have to step up," Coleman said. "That's what I did, I went in there and tried to be active more than any­thing." 
Boston shot just 2-for-15 in the decisive second quarter, falling behind by as many as 19 before halftime. 
The Hornets pushed their lead to 71-47 on Davis' dri­ving layup in the third quar­ter. 
But the Celtics were able to ·cut into the lead late in the fourth quarter, when Wesley was the only Charlotte starter still on the floor. 
Tony Battie's layup with 
3:56 to play pulled the Celtics to 89-80, but Charlotte answered with two free throws from Wesley and a three-point play by Magloire to make it 94-82. 
Antoine Walker scored 27 points and Milt Palacio added 13 for the Celtics, who finished 29-for-79 from the field. 
"I think this was a very valuable evening for us," Boston coach Jim O'Brien said. "It showed us what can happen if you don't play physically." 
Mashburn, who has missed all four of Charlotte's pre­season games because of a sore left hamstring, is expected to practice for the first time Thursday. Campbell was out with an eye injury and Bullard, one of the Hornets' offseason acquisitions, missed the game with a sore calf. 
The game was the first of the year in the Charlotte 
Coliseum, where several players tore tickets and greeted fans at the turnstiles to promote local interest. Even Coleman participated, stopping to sign autographs before and after his shootaround. 
But it did little to entice a crowd about 6,000 showed up at the 19,925­seat Coliseum to support what is likely a lame-duck franchise. 
"It's the preseason and I guess people are just busy with other things," Coleman said. "Hopefully they'll get their regular-season sched­ules out and be here to sup­port us then." 
It's a long shot, though. 
Hornets co-owner Ray Wooldridge met with the mayor of Louisville, Ky., on Monday to begin exploratory negotiations to move the team there next season. The governor of Kentucky has already pledged money to build the team a new arena, something Charlotte officials have refused to do. 
Without a promise of a new arena with luxury seat­ing, Wooldridge has said there is no way the team can remain in Charlotte. The threats have created an overwhelming disinterest for the team in the community in what is expected to be the best season in franchise his­tory. 
"We've got a good product on the floor and hope people 
will realize that and  come  
out  to  support us,"  Silas  
said.

After two weeks on the road, the Saint Mary's soccer team returns home on Wednesday to face Olivet College at 3 p.m. Wednesday's match will be the team·s first home game since Sept. 30. 
"I don't think playing away has affected us," said head coach Bobby Johnston. "But we're definitely excited to come back." 
The last two weeks have been difficult for the Belles. They faced two of the top three teams in the leagtw in their last four games. The Belles came away ,vith two wins in those four games. 
\Vhile they do not attribute their defeats to the lack of home. field advantage, they admit the weather has played 
a large role in their season. The Belles have battled wind and rain in a number of their games and practices. 
"The weather today [Tuesday) has sort of thrown off practice plans," said Johnston. "The things that I wanted to work on in prac­tice we're not being able to do." 
Despite the disruption in the Belles practice, Saint Mary's is optimistic for Wednesday's match against Olivet. 
"We have a strong rivalry with Olivet," said senior Katie Robinson. "This will definitely be an attainable game if we play like we know how." 
This game could be a turn­ing point in the Bellf~s · sea­son. The MIAA league ranks teams according to the points they acquire for wins and ties. Currently, the Belles are ranked sixth in the league with a record of 3-5. A victo­ry on Wednesday afternoon. however. could push the team past fifth place Hope and fourth place Olivet.

Belles display 'good energy' in loss to Adrian 
By KATIE McVOY 
Associate Spom Editor 
It wasn't a win on Tuesday night, but for a team that has been struggling just to stay focused on the game, the Belles four-game loss (30-21, 24-30. 22­30, 20-30) to Bulldogs of Adrian was almost as good.

"We were just really here," head coach Julie Schroeder-Bick said. "We came to play, we came to win. No, we did not pull out the win but we had really good ener­gy, good communication going." 
The Belles have lost their six games due, in the most part, to poor communication skills that were allowing the ball to fall. 
"Before, no one was calling the ball," Schroeder-Biek said. 
But Tuesday the Belles were able to take a solid victory in game one. even after falling behind 5-0. After allowing the Bulldogs to take the early lead. the Belles came back taking seven straight points and a lead that they didn't give up the rest of the game. 
"The first game they couldn't catch us," Schroeder-Biek said. "We came out so strong and we stayed strong." 
The last several matches, the Belles have had one solid player who has led the team. On Tuesday. they played as a whole.

ND VOLLEYBALL 
Set down in Iowa 
 No. 19 Notre Dame hits .037 in 4-game loss to No. 16 Northern Iowa. Goralski leads Irish with 11 kills, 8 blocks 
By NOAH AMSTADTER 
Sports Editor 
Facing a ranked opponent for the fourth time this season, the No. 19 Notre Dame volleyball team fell to No. 16 Northern Iowa in four games Tuesday night (30-26, 14-30. 16-30, 23-30). The game was played in front of 1.182 fans at Bettendorf High School in the Quad Cities. 
The loss drops Notre Dame's season record to 12-4 overall. 0-4 against ranked opponents including Notre Dame's three losses to Nebraska. UCL.\ and Pepperdine in early September. 
The match was a defensive battle, with neither team posting a hit­ting percentage higher than .233 in any game. The Panthers hit .208 for the match to Notre Dame's .037 mark. Notre Dame was also done in by hitting errors, committing 35 in the four games, including nine each by Kristy Kreher and Kim Fletcher, usually tv.·o of Notre Dame's main offensive weapons. 
Notre Dame also r.ommitted 10 service errors while serving eight aces. 
The one positive for the Irish was the play of senior Malinda Goralski. Goralski totaled 11 kills for the Irish to only two hitting errors in 21 attempts for a .429 perc.entage. She also assisted on eight blocks. Sophomore setter Kristen Kin-der added five kills and 30 assists. 
Notre Dame started off strong in the match's first game. winning 30-26 while holding Northern Iowa to .135 hitting. But as the match went on. thP home state team regrouped. while the Irish self­destructed. 
In game two. tlrn Irish totaled only six kills while committing 12 hitting f'rrors ror a -.194 percentage \.vhile scoring only 14 points. The WOPS continurd in the third game. as the Irish fpJl 30-16. At match's end. Notn' Dame returrn'd to positive hitting. pulling within SfWPn by thP end of the fourth ganw. 
But thP nation's No. 16 team was too much for the Irish. Kim McCaffn,y led the Panthers \.Vith l 8 kills while Kim Kester added 16 kills.

We Are Called 

Acting Locally and Thinking Globally 
When asked to write a reflection on "thinking globally and acting locally," it would be hard not to focus on the events ofthe Tuesday in Septetnber, and the response since then. An overwhelming support of everything American has swept this country. My hope for this nation, though, is that this renewed sense ofpatriotism will take the form of global patriotism, standing up against violence, racism, oppression and terrorism worldwide. We must work for global justice and fight oppression wherever it occurs, indiscriminate of boundaries of race, religion, nationality, and/or ethnicity. We must stand together with all victims ofterrorism, bring­ing those responsible to justice within the standards ofintemational law. 
In my eyes, patriotism means standing up for all humanity, not only those· defined by borders. We are able to practice this patriotism within our local South Bend com1nunity. Local patriotism first calls us to awareness of our immediate neighbors. My hope for our local con1munity is that we move beyond this recognition to action, patriotism's second step. This local, patri­otic action places us deeper within the community, working with and listening to others to meet together our shared needs and concerns. 
Throughout my four years at Notre Dan1e, I have lived with an 
Ecuadorian for two years and a Panamanian for a year. I am truly 
amazed at the amount of knowledge they possess on the United 
States of America, o_ur government, our policies, our culture, our 
people. I, on the other hand, knew upon coming to Notre Dame 
that the capital ofEcuador was Quito, and that Panama had a canal. 
It is possible that I ain the only ignorant American out there, but I 
don't think that is the case. The acts on American soil have taught 
us to be aware of global issues. I was one of many unaw6lre 
citizens in regards to the Taliban and U.S. relations with the Middle 
East. Over the next couple of months, in this time of war, I invite 
all to read up on global issues and become more educated on U.S. 
involvements and policies in foreign lands. 
So now that we are thinking globally, how do we use this to act locally? Is it possible to integrate the two? Of course it is. Quite simply, as Catholics, as Christians, as human beings alike, our duty is to love and care for one another. The Center for Social Concen1s · (CSC), as stated so simply in its mission statement, is '"...calling us all to action for a more just and humane world." I encountered this calling freshman year, but to tell you the truth, I didn't know what I was supposed to do with it. Who needs me? What should I be doing? Where should I be doing it? Am I ready for the struggles I may find? I am sure most, if not all, have questioned similarly. So, sophomore year rolled around, and I finally made my first en­trance into the CSC. I decided to go to Appalachia for spring break and didn't get enough ofthe action. I spent a summer at an orphan­age for physically and n1entally challenged children in central Mexico through the International Su1nn1er Service Leaming Pro­gram, and still felt the calling. I tried my luck with a domestic Sun1mer Service Project Internship and was still left searching for 1nore. I have been involved with a handful of organizations in the South Be.nd area also, yet Jesus still wants more. No matter the deed, big or small, Jesus is present. It is important to reiterate the passage "What you do unto the least of 1ny brothers and sisters, you do unto me." We have all heard it one thousand tin1es, but in serving others, you are serving God and God's creation. It is through my faith in Jesus Christ that I am called to be present in the lives ofothers.

As a theology professor here told me, "to do good has an attraction to it, and after you do good once, you want more and more." Trust me, you will get hooked! It wiJI never fill you up! On the one hand, it is frustrating to never be fully satisfied in serving others. However, on the other, as Archbishop Oscar Romero in his inspiring '"Prophets of a Future Not Our Own" states, 
"We cannot do everything, and there is a sense 
ofliberation in realizing that. This enables us 
to do something, and to do it very well. It may 

1ots1:;;nni gt1j
be incomplete, but it is a beginning, a step 
along the way, an opportunity for the Lord's 
grace to enter and do the rest." It does not require something huge. Although less vis­ible, the little things are so important; they add up into something beautiful. It is singing at the nursing home, translating at the hospital, and playing ball with under­privileged kids. It is serving food at the food kitchen, opening a door for an elder, and talking to the struggling friend down the hall. Al) serve to better humanity! How beautiful is that! 
In conclusion, in the midst of fear and violence world­wide, we as human beings are called to act locally and think globally to best love, respect, and serve others. We must work to create understanding and peace, not ven­geance and hatred, in our calling for a more just and hu­mane world. We 1nust stand in solidarity with all of hu­n1anity -to demand the end of all forms of oppression and violence, and a beginning to true justice and peace.
