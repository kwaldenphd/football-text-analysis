Viewers take note: MTV is the one to watch 
I want my MTV. 
I watched it every day for three months this summer. Now I am going through withdrawal. I've tried putting on my W alkman and watching television, but it just isn't the same. 
I don't know exactly what happened this sum­mer, but I feel as though I've regressed about six years, to the age and mentality of the high school sophomore I was when MTV first went on the air and I was completely mesmerized for months by it. 
To wake up for work each day this summer, I made a cup of coffee and sat in front of the TV for a few videos, until I was ready to face the day. 
During my lunch break, I just about made it home in time to watch "Remote Control," the MTV game show for college intellectuals who were once (are still?) couch potatoes. 
When my sense of humor was feeling warped, I flipped the channels to MTV to catch an episode of "Monty Python's Flying Circus." 
I gave up watching the regular station news because the news is always so depressing. But, luckily, MTV has its own Music News, so at least I could keep updated on the world of music, if not the world of reality.

just tuned in to MTV to watcMisten to the 10 or 11 videos that are played continuously every hour. 
I want my MTV. 
I may be the only non-junior high school per­son who is so addicted to MTV, but I can't un­derstand why. MTV has something for every­one, programming to appeal to almost every taste. 
For the masses of people who appear to like Top 40, MTV is a pop heaven. Once on the "cut­ting edge" of the music scene, MTV is now a televised version of the American Top 40. It even has a Top 20 Video Countdown. 
For the heavy metal types, there's the "Headbanger Ball" on Friday nights from mid­night until 3 a.m.--three hours of pure, unadul­terated heavy metal. 
For those into progressive music, "120 Minutes" (my personal favorite) plays altern­ative music videos every Sunday from midnight to 2 a.m. This show also plays alot of the old, original MTV videos, which were progressive at the time. 
For the true rock 'n roll afficionados, "Closet Classics" plays some of the best of the classic rock videos, usually clips from old concerts, every day at 12 a.m. 
And MTV is oh-so-much more than just music. "Remote Control" is a game show tar­geted directly to college-aged contestants, like a "Jeopardy" with questions that non-geniuses can answer if they watched 12 hours of TV per day when they were young. And Ken Ober, the host, is so much more entertaining than Alex Trebek (One of my goals is to be a contestant on "Remote Control" before I graduate). 

Siskel and Ebert have some competition now, too. "The Big Picture" host Chris Connelly reviews the latest movies each week and inter­views whoever happens to be the most popular actor/actress of the week. 
For anyone into strange but hilarious British humor, "Monty Python's Flying Circus" is on every night at 7:30 Eastern time (right after "Remote Control" --what a double feature!). 
And just like ABC News Briefs, MTV's Music News has flashes throughout the day, as well as a half-hour newscast on Saturdays, to keep viewers informed about what's going on in music. The journalism isn't quite as hard­hitting as that of the three major networks, but the news is definitely more upbeat. 
Perhaps the best thing about MTV is that if you leave the television for any period of time, within an hour the videos will be repeated so you won't miss anything substantial. 
I know the same videos are played over and over again, but it's so exciting to wait for that one video that hasn't been played in a few years, since Martha Quinn and Alan Hunter left. Or for the video that has just been released and hasn't been overplayed yet. 
OK. So MTV is completely mindless. But there are some times when there is no need to think and mindlessness feels pretty good. 
I want my MTV.

Freshmen urged to avoid alcohol 
By REGIS COCCIA News Editor 

The problem of alcohol abuse came across loud and clear to about 1,100 freshmen during an Alcohol Awareness Program on Monday, said Emil Hofman, dean of Freshman Year of Studies. 
Co-sponsored by Freshman Year and the Office of Student Affairs, the 55-minute program held in Washington Hall was shown three times to accom­modate attending freshmen. 
"Most behavioral problems among college students are those that stem from alcohol abuse," said Hofman, the pro­gram's master of ceremonies. 
"Our first attempt to address the problem was to talk to the freshmen," he said, adding that a similar, but less effective program was held last year. 
"Unfortunately, many of the people who would have benefit­ted did not show up," Hofman said. "Hopefully it deters people from getting involved (in abusing alcohol)." 
Speakers included Student Body Vice President Mike Paese, senior Kristen Williams and Kevin Hurley, who was in­jured in a drunk-driving acci­dent in 1985 and currently en­rolled as a freshman. 
Grace Hall Rector Father Gerald Lardner, Ann Firth,

Beware the eternal struggle. Hope no one shrouds or dispatches you this year. Have a great senior year! 
Love, Mom and Dad, Andy, Ned and Anne 
director of residence life, and Sally Coleman of the Univer­sity Counseling Center, also spoke during the program. 
In his speech, Paese chal­lenged the freshmen to avoid 
abusing alcohol. "He was very 
good. Dr. Firth stated the exact 
alcohol policy. She really gave 
it to them straight," Hofman 
said. 
Coleman told freshmen of 
services offered by the Univer­
sity Counseling Center for stu­
dents with alcohol problems, 
Hofman said. 
Hurley related his own 
struggle as a victim of drunk 
driving. "He pleaded with class 
not to abuse alcohol and not to 
drive drunk," Hofman said. 
"It was a good program and I think the freshmen were im­pressed by it," he said. "Not many walked out (Monday) and those that did did so be­cause they had particular ap­pointments. I think the stu­dents were spellbound." 
The Alcohol Awareness Pro­gram was planned as part of Freshman Orientation and will very likely be continued in the future, Hofman said. "The im­mediate thing is to get all of the freshmen to go," he said. 
"I think the point was made by everbody that alcohol has a place in social life," said Hof­man, "but we must consider what place that is." 
"I think it will take a year to go through the cycle," he added. "Because the Univer­sity is such an attractive place, every year there's something new going on." 
Hurley also said he has had contact with Notre Dame stu­dents in the past. "I worked in my early days in the northeast area of South Bend and I had contact with Notre Dame stu­dents then," said Hurley. 
"Notre Dame really attracts good people, and I'm looking forward to all that that brings." 
Think of your best friend. Now, think of your best friend dead.

Quayle starts solo campaign, meets Bentsen 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS--Republican vice 
presidential nominee Dan 
Quayle, on his first solo na­
tional campaign trip, delivered 
an impassioned defense Wed­
nesday of his National Guard 

service, saying "I'm not 
looking for any medals" but "I 
served loyally." 
"Nearly 20 years ago, I had 
no reason to be ashamed of my 

service. And you know what, 
I'm sure as hell not ashamed 

of it now!" Quayle said in 
prepared remarks to a confer­

ence of present and former en­
listed National Guardsmen. 
Quayle said he "wasn't looking for favors" when he en­tered the Guard in 1969 and reiterated that "no rules were broken" and no effort had been made to "influence the process" of his admission during the height of the Viet­nam War. 
"I'm not looking for any medals. And I'm not asking for a pat on the back. But let me say this: I served. I served loyally, and I served to the best of my ability," Quayle said. 
The Indiana senator began his first solo campaign swing seeking to shift attention from the controversy that has stalked his candidacy and focus instead on his message of peace, freedom and jobs. 
Almost at the very start, he had a good-natured airport encounter with his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, who had just warned Southern state legisla­tors not to "risk youthful in­discretion" in someone like Quayle who might someday as­cend to the presidency. 
Quayle's evening speech to the conference of National Guardsmen in St. Louis was evidently intended as the Senator's answers to his crit-

Sen. Dan Quayle 

ics. He has tended to view ques­tions about his military record as a slur on his patriotism. 
In the speech, he criticized Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis for an "anti-defense attitude." 
"One of the worst false im­pressions Michael Dukakis has put forward is the idea that he stands for a strong national defense," Quayle said. "Maybe he sincerely believes that. But he stands for the opposite, and that position has been clouded over by the distractions of the last few days." 
During the day, Quayle kept out of range of reporters and sought to concentrate on cam­paign issues and the prospec­tive virtues of a George Bush presidency. An aide said Quayle wanted to focus on "things we want to talk about." 
Quayle ignored reporters' shouted questions seeking a response to Bentsen's remarks. Bentsen had tried to exploit Quayle's earlier com­ment that his "youthful in­discretion" was to blame for his vote against elevating the Veterans Administration to a Cabinet-level department.

Liberalism taints election coverage 
Another election year is upon us. We've watched the Democrats whistle "Dixie" in Atlanta and the Republicans be-bop on Bourbon Street; and, despite the inevitable complaints sure to come concerning the excessive length of the campaign and!or the avoidance of is­sues by the candidates, we're all going to be interested in whether Mr. Dukakis or Mr. Bush emerges as the winner come November 8. But herein lies the problem: following the campaign be­tween now and Election Day. For how do most of us do that? By reading and watching the major media of this country--ABC, CBS, NBC, the New York Times, Washington Post, Time, or Newsweek, to name a few. And what is the trouble with that? It is, simply, that a clear majority of those writing and reporting the news are a bunch of ideologically committed liberals who, knowingly or not, incorporate a liberal bias into their news coverage. 
Kevin Smant 
on politics 
Does that last statement scare you off? It shouldn't, for the evidence to support it exists in abundance. Estab­lishing that major media elites are in fact mainly liberals is easy. The best (though not the only) study was done by S. Robert Lichter of George Wash­ington University and Stanley Rothman of Smith College. They interviewed 240 
individuals, mostly from the major 
media outlets mentioned above. Fifty­
four percent described themselves as 
left of center, and 19 percent right of 
center. And how have they voted, say 
for President from 1964 to 1976? Never 
less than 80 percent voted Democratic: 94 percent for Johnson in 1964, 87 per­cent for Humphrey in 1968, 81 percent for McGovern in 1972, and 81 percent for Carter in 1976. 
Few people now dispute the glaring liberalism of most members of the media. What media defenders argue, however, is that it does not matter; that the news is still presented objectively, and that if anything newsmen portray all political figures in a somewhat nega­tive light (owing to the press's acquired cynicism). On the surface, this seems plausible. But certainly facts suggest otherwise. One of the earliest investiga­tions was by Edith Efron, who ex­amined network news coverage of the 1968 presidential campaign. She analyzed actual numbers of words the networks presented both "for" and "against" certain key issues during the campaign (such as U.S. policy on the Vietnam War) and she translated this into the number of words for and against the presidential candidates. The results? Let us take one network as an example. CBS gave Humphrey (the Democrat) 2388 positive words, against 2083 negative. It gave Richard Nixon 320 positive words, and 5300 

Doonesbury 
negative (perhaps this is why Efron titled her book "The News Twisters"). How can this be interpreted, except as an example of media bias against the perceived "conservative" candidate? 
Wait, it gets better. In 1984 George Washington University media analysts Michael Robinson and Maura Clancey undertook another comprehensive study of network news reportage of the 1984 campaign. Most significant in their findings was their analysis of the press "spin" or ideological tilt put on a story. How can one determine spin? Well, in October 1984 President Reagan took a train trip through western Ohio. This is "hard" news. But when Dan Rather labeled the ride "a photo opportunity train trip, chock full of symbolism and trading on Harry Truman's old turf," this is spin. 
So, Robinson and Clancey established specific rules and came up with a good pres&bad press total for all four 1984 presidential candidates. The results should not be surprising. President Reagan got 730 seconds of good press, 7230 of bad; Walter Mondale, by con­trast, received 1330 seconds of positive spin versus 1050 of negative; Geraldine Ferraro got 640 good, 400 bad; and George Bush? He got 0 seconds positive--nothing--and 1510 seconds of negative press. So President Reagan received ten times more negative coverage than positive, and George Bush no positive press at all. Can this be an accident? Come on.

So what should be done? Press freedom in this country is sacred, and it should be. As much as I dislike what Sam Donaldson or Bruce Morton say, I would defend their right to say it. No, the initiative has to come from us, the· viewers. Just as we must examine po­litical candidates critically, so we must also watch the evening news critically. Something is not true just because Dan Rather says it is: one need not accept that a "crisis" exists just because ABC does a piece on the "farm crisis," the "AIDS crisis," the "drug crisis," etc. It is a wonder we can sleep at night with all these crises swirling around us. We must sample a wide variety of media outlets, not just television. To 
put it simply,  we  must make up  our  
own minds.  
The distinctions  are subtle. No  one  

argues that the heads of ABC, CBS, and NBC News meet every morning and discuss how to "get" Republicans. Nor, thankfully, is the media so persuasive as many of its liberal members millht like: Ronald Reagan, demonstrably no media darling, has still won 44 and 49 states in the last two presidential elec­tions. But the liberal bias exists. The real question is why, and for how much longer, will members of the media deny it.

After the police comb his apartment for drugs and find nothing, he is requested not to leave the area, just in case the girl never wakes up. Despite this, Daryl runs to the nearest airport where his credit cards are rejected and he has to stay in town anyway. 
In desperation, he tries one last place for money since his supplier has cut him off. He calls his parents and asks them to give him $30,000 by either taking out a second mortgage on their home, or giving him an advance from their wills. They hang up on him. We learn that he has lost all of the $92,000 in the stock market. 
Between swigs of gin, snorts of cocaine and a never­ending chain of cigarettes, Daryl hears a commercial on the radio describing a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center that is completely con­fidential. He checks in to the drug rehab center denying that he has any problem with drugs, but views it as a safe place to hide from the police and his boss, who now suspects that Daryl has em­bezzled the $92,000.

hen painful memories are repressed they often emerge later to haunt the present. Tom Wingo realizes this truth in Pat Conroy's compelling novel, "The Prince of Tides." 
The story begins when Tom Wingo learns that his twin sister Savannah has just at­tempted suicide. Tom imme­diately flies to New York where he works closely with her psychiatrist. Together they attempt to understand why Savannah, a talented young poet, wants to slit her wrists. 
Tom unravels the history of his violent, complicated fam­ily relationships in a series of flashbacks. The novel alter­nates between chapters about the present and the past. The reader gains more and more insight into Savannah's pres­ent problems as the fascinat­ing web of deceit and denial surrounding their childhood unwinds. 
Savannah is not the only one who needs to face the events of the past. Tom finds discovers that he must face up to his responsibilities and he cannot continue to treat people in his abusive and ob­noxious manner. 

In this process we see him gain respect for himself and begin to find love and respect in others. He also finally recognizes the gravity of a life based on cocaine and free-basing: it destroys the -­

unlike the perfect suburbanite he played in "Mr. Mom," Keaton's character is harsh and abrupt, clashing with almost everyone he comes in contact with. Keaton's acting talents come alive in "Clean and Sober," and after this we will hopefully see him in many more dramatic roles. 
This film is a close look at the life of someone who "does not" have a drug problem. It is at times a shocking film and a graphic one, but this is also a moving film of the life of someone who gets swept away by addiction. This is an excellent insight into a prob­lem that plagues so much of the upper crust of American society. It is a film not to be laughed at or ignored and definitely not a film to be missed. 
'Prince of Tides' royally rewarding 
that he cannot know himself until he analyzes his small town values, childhood fears and triumphs, and his brutal parents. 
Tom explains his unhappi­ness before he confronts his painful past when he says, "I was running away from that history, I thought -that bit­ter, outrageous slice of Americana that was my own failed life -or toward a new phase of that history." 
The backdrop to this family drama is the South Carolina low country near Kiawah Is­land. Conroy often uses vivid sensory imagery that allows the reader to smell the salt marshes, breathe the sea air, and hear the horns of the shrimper boats. 
Tom Wingo has a dry sense of humor that gives his dialogue an ironic tone. For ­example, Tom refers to his childhood as Hiroshima or the Titantic. He also claims, "It is an art form to hate New York City properly." 
"The Prince of Tides" is a beautifully written, carefully crafted novel that weaves the past and the present together to create a believable portrait of a pained family.

Four indicted in Bloom-Walters agent scandal 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Three agents and Cris Carter of the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles were in­dicted Wednesday on charges ranging from racketeering to perjury following an investiga­tion of illegal payments and threats used to sign dozens of athletes. 
New York-based agents Norby Walters and Lloyd Bloom are accused of offering athletes cash, cars, clothing and trips in exchange for signed -in some cases post­dated -agreements allowing Walters and Bloom to repre­sent them in professional contract negotiations. 
Also indicted was agent Dave Lueddeke of Sherman Oaks, Calif. 
U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said 43 college athletes who signed with Walters and Bloom, many of whom subse­quently became pros, avoided prosecution with pretrial agreements to perform com­munity service and to reim­burse a portion of their scholarships. 
The group also agreed to tes­tify if the case goes to trial and includes NFL players Ron Mor­ris of Chicago, Ronnie Harmon of Buffalo and Paul Palmer of Kansas City plus Brad Sellers of the NBA's Chicago Bulls. 
"We considered things like their age... their back­grounds, the amount of money involved and anv nrior record," Valukas said. 
Valukas said when induce­ments of cash or goods failed, Walters and Bloom resorted to threats. 
In one 1987 phone conversa­tion, the indictment charged, Walters told Seattle Seahawks linebacker Tony Woods -while Woods was still a student at Pitt: "This is my life on the line... Now it's your life on the line... your reputation, your business... your family, your brother, your school, every­thing is going to be tainted and tainted bad.

you." 
Walters and Bloom, the original targets of the 18-month investigation, were indicted on charges of racketeering, mail fraud, wire fraud and extor­tion. 
The telephone at Walters' World Sports & entertainment Inc. office in New York went unanswered Wednesday. 
Attorney M.L. Trope, who is representing Bloom, said Wed­nesday, "Lloyd Bloom is a kid who... did not commit any crime. He'll vigorously fight to vindicate himself." 
Carter, who left Ohio State with a year of eligibility left and ended up with the Eagles in a supplemental draft, was charged with obstruction of justice for concealing a $5,000 payment delivered by Lued­deke from the federal grand jury investigating the case. 
Carter, who also had dealings with Walters and Rlnnm ::~lso was chare:ed with 

mail fraud. 
"I am cooperating ful­ly... and could only say that I regret my past mistakes," Carter said in a statement released by the Eagles. 
NFL spokesman Jim Heffer­nan said the league would have no comment on Carter. 
Lueddeke was charged with perjury and obstruction of jus­tice stemming from the $5,000 payment. Lueddeke did not im­mediately return a telephone call to his ficm, Pro-Line Sports. 
Walters, 58, and Bloom, 29, both face 70 years in jail and $2 million in fines. Lueddeke, 37, faces 15 years in jail and $750,000 in fines. Carter, who has agreed to cooperate with authorities, faces 10 years and a $500,000 fine.

is working with the first team at the other guard spot. Mike Heldt and Tim Ryan, both sop­homores who played a com­bined total of just over 30 minutes last year, are compet­ing for the starting slot at cen­ter. 
"I think we're getting better fundamentally," said Holtz. "We're startling to become a unit. (Sandri) has had a good fall. We have two good centers, and even though they're young, they're having a good battle.'' 
The young offensive line will be up against a vastly more ex­perienced Michigan defensive front. Led by Outland Trophy candidate Mark Messner, the Wolverines' defensive line is rated as the third best in the country by The Sporting News. 
In picking Michigan to win the national championship, The Sporting News also rates the Wolverines' offensive linemen as the nation's finest. That certainly should test an Irish defensive line that cur­rently has Bob Dahl, Ted FitzGerald and Tom Gorman nursing injuries, though all should be healthy by the Sept. 10 contest. 
"Michigan has the best offen­sive line in the country accor­ding to the stats and prognos­ticators," said Holtz. "It's going to be a real challenge to our defensive line, and it's going to be a challenge for our offensive line." 
Even though The Sporting News tabs Michigan as its fa­vorite to win the national title, most of the other preseason magazines on the newsstands seem to agree with the Associ­ated Press' and United Press International's selections of Florida State. 
The Seminoles are the top choice of Athlon, College & Pro Football Weekly, Inside Sports, Lindy's and Street & Smith's. Dissenting opinions come from Game Plan, which likes Clem­son, and Sport, which bets the farm on Iowa. 
The magazines can't seem to come to a decision a'to where Notre Dame will finish. The Irish are ranked as high as fifth by College & Pro Football Weekly and Inside Sports, but are nowhere to be found in Ath­lon's Top 20 forecast.
