A.llsoclated Press 
WASHINGTON Congress, unable to agree on a multi-billion dollar funding measure for the full fiscal year, whisked through a stop­gap bill yesterday needed to tide many federal agencies over for the weekend and prevent disruption of government services. 
At the same time, administration officials reported progress in their efforts to cajole Republican law­makers into reviving proposals for major overhaul of the tax laws -the top item on President Reagan's second-term domestic agenda. Even so, Representative Richard Gep­hardt, D-Mo., told reporters, "The bill's not dead yet, but the patient is on the table and dying." 
The stopgap spending· measure replaced an existing bill due to expire at midnight, and was ap­proved first by a voice vote in the House. The Senate quickly followed suit, with Senator Mark Hatfield, R­Ore., chairman of the Appropria­tions Committee, saying that the alternative could be the "furloughing of federal employees" ifthe federal till ran dry. 
With the end ofthe congressional session clearly in sight, House and Senate negotiators also made head­way on a compromise long-term farm bill, and labored on a measure to cut federal deficits by as much as $80 billion over the next three years. 
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole said it would be an "abdication ofeverything we've done all year" if Congress left town without finishing 
258 soldiers on trip home perish during plane tragedy 
GANDER, Newfoundland-A DC-8 charter full ofU.S. soldiers returning from the Middle East crashed and exploded yesterday near Gander In­ternational Airport, killing all 258 aboard and scattering gifts and weapons across snow-covered woods. 
Families and friends learned ofthe disaster as they assembled for a brass-band welcome at the headquarters of the to1st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Ky., but carried on with plans for a Christmas music concert as a tribute to the dead. 
Airport employees recalled hearing the exuberant Americans singing carols as they crowded into the duty-free shop. 
"Just about every one of them bought some little thing to take back home," said cashier Cynthia Goodyear. "They were just so happy to be going home." 
Cause of the 6:45 a.m. ( 5:15 a.m. EST) crash remained under inves­tigation, but the White House said preliminary reports showed no in­dication of sabotage or an in-flight explosion in history's eighth-worst aviation disaster. 
The charred cockpit voice and flight recorders were recovered and will be taken to Ottawa for analysis,

Six million dollars presented by Kroc for peace studies 

Spedal to The Obeerver 
The University ofNotre Dame has received a $6 million gift from Joan Kroc, widow of Ray Kroc, the founder of the McDonald's res­taurant chain, to establish an In­stitute for Peace Studies. The benefaction Is one ofthe largest per­sonal gifts ever received by the Uni­versity. 
The announcement of the award was made this morning. 
Father Theodore Hesburgh, University president, said, "In her bold efforts for the cause of global peace, Joan Kroc displays an en­thusiasm harmonious with Notre Dame's deepest institutional aspira­tions. Her generosity will invigorate and dramatically expand several in­itiatives already underway here to promote peace in both the academic and policy-making worlds." 
The institute endowed by Kroc's gift will be directed byJohn Gilligan, former governor of Ohio and now Francis J. O'Malley University Professor at Notre Dame. Gilligan, who has been a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and at theJohn F.

work on the spending cuts. But ot­hers said agreement would be dif­ficult, since many of the proposed cuts involve domestic programs. 
A compromise bailout for the Farm Credit System also was on a short list ofyear-end legislation. 
Weary lawmakers looked forward to the end of the session as Reagan, acting without ceremony, signed landmark legislation designed to force a balanced budget by 1991. That bill was cleared by Congress on Wednesday after months of wran­gling. 
But the controversy lingered as O'Neill blistered the plan as a "fake and a fraud" that would harm the poor, and Representative Mike Synar, D-Okla., filed suit in U.S. Dis­trict Court challenging a provision that could lead to automatic spend­ing cuts. 
The bill signed by the president also raised the debt limit above $2 trillion in time to avoid serious dis­

In Brief 

Liberal but apathetic is how the students of Prin­ceton University appear in a recent survey by the school's student newspaper. Of those students who voted in the 1984 election, 62 percent voted for Mondale and 36.7 percent for Reagan. The catch, however, is that only 28.6 percent of those eligible to vote par­ticipated. Overall, 40 percent call themselves Democrats and 24.8 percent Republicans. -The Observer 
A drug to cure baldness has been developed by Upjohn Co., and now awaits approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for prescription sales of the drug, the company said yesterday. The drug has been tested as a remedy for both male pat­tern baldness, which is the hair loss many men experience with ad­vancing age, and patchy baldness, which is an unusual massive loss of hair all over the body, an Upjohn spokesman said. Upjohn hopes to market the drug as a prescription medicine under the trade name Regalne. -AP

ship roles in the church produced a major influence at the synod, with 280 black bishops in attendance. Gremillion said he condoned the in­troduction of African and Asian culturesand tribes into the ministry. 
He stated that this "evangelization of cultures" made the church "no longer a Western church, but a truly universal church." 
Showing its importance in world issues, this synod attracted 600 ac­credited journalists to cover the proceedings in Rome, with 100 from the United States. 
In regard to the synod's effects on the Notre Dame community, Gremillion reiterated the deep feeling that Notre Dame is part of a world-wide movement which must maintain its leading role towards the goals of justice, peace and human' rights. 
Continuing these movements through the Institution ofSocial and Pastoral Ministry remains Gremil­lion's goal. Established 10 years ago, thiS organization provides a channel 
through which Notre Dame's resources may be used for the con­tinuing education of the ministry and lay people, carrying out the principles of Vatican II. By stretch­ing far beyond the Notre Dame campus, the institute reaches the clergy of 180 dioceses and 19,000 parishes nationwide. 
This ministry consists of seven majpr programs, serving not only the clergy, but the elderly and mem­bers ofcommunity parishes as well. 


·_Hesburgh: Union leads arms fight 
Special to The Ob8erver 
A united effort by scientists and religious leaders has led the fight against nuclear weapons which has 
 ,surfaced dramatically in the 1980s,
new year, too. 

Father Theodore Hesburgh, Univer­sity president, said yesterday.
From Frank, Dan and Tess 

In remarks prepared for delivery at the 40th anniversary dinner of 3IIK1~P.t~C"..:B2iic'G:P.;~ofl:e~-f.!9!!~re!D!~rGD!~r-f.ID~rfli!I.I.!The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists at 
the University ofChicago, Hesburgh noted that "the nuclear arsenal grew in numbers and megatonnage, with new and more accurate systems of delivery on land, sea and sky -and now in outer space. Somehow in the early 1980s, our moral conscious­ness at last began to stir." 
Hesburgh, whose term on the Na­tional Science Board from 1954 to 1966 coincided with the beginnings of the atomic age, said the United States has, more often than not, led the arms buildup. He pointed out that the United , States first in­troduced the atom bomb, the inter­continental bomber, the jet bomber, the H-bomb, submarine-launched missiles, and multiple re-entry vehicles, with the USSR quickly fol­lowing. 
The Soviets were first with the in­tercontinental ballistic missile and the anti-ballistic missile, with the United States not far behind

many religious appeals to nuclear 
morality and sanity... but they went 
unheeded," Hesburgh observed. 
"About a quarter of our scientists 
and engineers were engaged in the 
macabre arms race. What caught the 
headlines were the war games 
spokesmen." 
In the past few years, according to Hesburgh, a growing number of scientific groups -including the In­ternational Council ofScientific Uni­ons, the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize recipient, the International Physicians for Prevention ofNuclear War-have warned sharply about our new capability to virtually destroy the Earth.

13lind date wins Gipp another tr.y with Nicki Summers 


Tbis is tbe 12tb episode in Tbe Observer's serial publication oftbe Notre Damefootball story, "Tbe Gtpper's Gbost." In last week's episode, Nicki Summers surprised an "overwhelmed" Dutch Reagan (the ghost ofGeorge Gipp) witb herpassing 
prowess, and Father Rock (tbe ghost of Knute Rockne)forecast/be brlgbtfuture of tb1? new bunch ofIrish starters. 
The quest 

I 
t was Friday night. Hart Collins had arranged a blind date for Dutch Reagan with his girlfriend's roommate. 1 dun l know about thts, Hart. I ve nevt:r been on a blind date before." 
"What's the matter, Dutch, you're not 
scared, are you? You didn't seem to be 
afi:aid ofPurdue's tackles last week." 
"Tackles are one thing. Brunettes are 
something else." 
"Trust me. You'lllike her. She's Lauren's 
roommate so she can't be all bad." Collins 
h~1d met Lauren Kennedy at last year's 
fr:shman mixer. It had been love at first 
si~t. She was a lovely, tanned blonde from 
Connecticut. Many considered her the 
most attractive girl on campus. 
Collins had arranged to meet the girls at 
the entrance to the Engineering 
Allditorium, which did double-duty as a 
lecture hall in the daytime and a movie 
theater at night. This week, the Student. 
Union Movie Commission was staging a 
George Lucas revival, showing some ofhis 
old classics. Tonight's feature was "The 
Empire Strikes Back". 
Ryan O'Connor was joining them. He 
didn't have a date, but that wasn't unusual. 
H: was forever faithful to his H.T.H., or 
"home-town honey," in Erie, a dark-eyed 
Italian girl named linda. 
Collins had been suppressing a smile all 
afi:ernoon. Reagan was sure of it, but 
couldn't guess the reason. He knew the 
moment Kennedy arrived-with her 
roommate. 
"Nicki," Lauren said, "I'd like you to meet Dutch Reaga.n. Dutch, this is Nicki Sum­
mers." 
Summers said, "This is a wonderful surprise. Dutch and I are practically old friends. We've met twice before." 
Collins burst out laughing. "And Nicki won both rounds!" 
The group entered the auditorium and chose seats in the middle rows. For the next two hours, they were transported to anot­her galaxy as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and the other Star Wars heroes battled the forces ofthe evil Empire. 
Reagan seemed to enjoy the film most. He told Summers he had never seen it before, which she thought was odd. Im­agine someone who had never seen a Star Warsfilm! · 
After the movie, the party offive squeezed into Summers' Camaro and drove to Denny's on U.S. 33, about 10 minutes north ofcampus. Many Notre Dame stu­dents chose to supplement their dining hall menu with an occasional meal off campus ... just to be safe about good nutrition, vitamin requirements, and so forth. 
Collins loved the movie. Ever thoughtful, he tried to put it in a broader perspective. "You !mow, my favorite character in the Star Wars series has always been Han Solo, the pilot of the Millennium Falcon. No matter what happens, he always fights his way through. No matter what the odds .... 
" 
"Great or small?" 

"Cut it out, Dutch, I'm trying to be serious. No matter what the odds, he always keeps trying, facing every challenge. Remember the scene when Solo and his friends are being chased by enemy spaces­hips and he decides to fiy his ship, the Milennium Falcon, directly into an asteroid belt to avoid the lasefblasts? The rest of them thought he was crazy. Remember hew C3PO, the gold robot, told him the odds of successfully naviga.ting a spaceship through an asteroid field were something like 3, 720 toone?" 
His friends nodded. 
Collins said, "What did he say?" 
They knew. 

They all said together, "Never tell me the odds!" 
Collins paused. 
"I know it's only a moW.e, but I wish we could instill a little ofSolo's attitude into 
the team." 
Summers agreed. "You're right. I think the old Notre Dame teams had that kind of spirit, if you want to call it that. There always seemed to be a common thread through the great game stories. No matter how much time was left, the greatest Notre Dame teams played their hearts out until the final gun sounded." 
"Especially when joe Montana was quarterback!" Collins said. "Remember the Cotton Bowl ga.me when Notre Dame trailed 34 to 12 with seven minutes and 37 

seconds to play, and still won 35 to 34?" 
For the next halfhour, the group debated what had led to the downfall of the Notre Dam1e football program. There was general agreement that many factors had con­tributed to the decline: academic pressures, higher admission standards for student­athletes, and ofcourse, the routine scapegoat, co-education. They all dismissed the "Samson and Delilah" theory advanced by some ofthe more cynical alumni who remained convinced that the downfall was inevitable as soon as the school became co-ed in the fall of 1972. The argument generally stated the players would be unable to concentrate on football with all those pretty girls on campus to distract them. Male students from those early days ofco-education generally disputed that theory, and often supported their claim by producing visual evidence from their old Freshman Photo Directory, or "dog book" as it was more commonly known. 
Finally, Collins said, "sometime before we graduate, I want to win the national championship for Notre Dame. I don't really have any interest in pursuing profes­sional football, ·but I sure would enjoy winning the the national title for Notre Dame. I think that's a quest worth pursu­ing." 
There was silence for a few moments 
while the others pondered his proposal. 
Reagan broke the silence. "like you said 
Hart. Never tell me the odds. It's agreed. 
We win the national championship." 
Summers ga.ve him an affectionate elbow. 
"Here, have another French fry, dreamer." 
Around midnight, back on campus, Reagan walked Summers back to Breen­Phillips. At the door, he said, "I really enjoyed this evening, Nicki." 
"Me, too." 
"Well, I guess I should be going now." He moved closer. 
"I guess so. I'd invite you in, but it's almost pumpkin time. You know how strict our hall rector, Sister Sarah, is about parietal violations." 
"Yeah. Well, Nicki ... " He moved closer. 
Summers tilted her head slightly back. 
Extending his arm, Reagan shook her 
hand vigorously. "Well, goodnight, Nicki. Thanks aga.in. Be seeing you." Then he rushed away. 
Summers folded her arms and sighed. She thought to herself, typical Notre Dame male! 
But he is cute. For a football player.

Lack of faith apparent from parietals decision 
Two hours may not seem like a long time. 
This Friday and Saturday nights, parietals will end at midnight, two hours 
before their usual time. The Notre Dame administration has decided to cut short 
hall visitation hours because it wants students to utilize their weekend study 
days before final exams. 

This is not a major decision by the University and it will not have a great effect 
on student life. It is, however, yet another example ofhow administrators regard 
students as something other than mature adults capable of making their own 
decisions. 

Shortening parietals this weekend will not make anyone study longer or har­
der for exams. What it will do is show students that administrators lack faith in 
them. Administrators are making decisions students should be allowed to make 
for themselves. 

Saint Mary's parietals policy during exam week used to bt: even worse than 
Notre Dame's is now. Before a parietals revision last year, there was no visitation 
at all during exam week. This year, parietals will maintain their usual hours 
during the week. 

It is time the Notre Dame administration stopped treatingstudents as childre'n 
and began treating them as mature, responsible citizens ofthis community. 
-The Observer 
Do not let love dwindle during your busy times 
"I love you." 

Three words mean so much and are easy to say. Yet, we still find difficulty in saying them. As the holidays approach and we look forward to being with family and close friends, these words must not be forgotten. 
Mary Berger makes you think 
It may be trite, but it is true: Love does make the world go 'round. There may be war, hunger, loss ofhuman rights and multitudes of other pains In the world which must be dealt with, but when It comes down to the line, the most important things in our lives are those 

people near and dear to our hearts. 
Friends and family do so much for us. They 
aid in our growth, always there to catch us if 
we fall or pat us on the backs. They share our 
tears and joys of laughter. They hope to shel­
ter us from harm, but let us learn fom our 
mistakes. 

One may think success in life depends on 
the dean's list, a high-paying job or other 
material things gained through hard work. 
Without the love and support of someone, 
though, what do those rewards mean? Very 
little. 

We must nurture the love we share with 
those close to us at all times. We must show 
our love and give it freely to those we care 
about. We must never let any priority top our 
need to love and be loved. 
Signs of affection need not be big or gran­
diose. A smile shows you care, and "How are 
you doing?" does the same. These may be 
commonplace, but do not tell me you don't 
feel some warmth and desire to smile yourself 
when encountering a smiling face. 
Short notes, cards and letters are always great because the receiver can return to them over and over whenever he or she needs to be reminded that they are loved. 
Telling someone you love him is also won­derful. At times, we find it difficult to voice that feeling. Find the right time, though, and let that person know how you feel. 
What I am trying to say is, don't get so caught up in finals now and whatever happens in the future that you let the blossoms oflove surrounding you wither and die. 
Let your friends here know what what they mean to you and share with your family all of the love you feel for them. Ifyou do not take the time to show your love now, after you finish what is keeping you so preoccupied at the moment, you'll find it is too late. 
Mary Berger is enrolled in the Freshman Year ofStudies at Notre Dame.

College is a great step for parents and children 
I never really thought it would happen when I was growing up; some things alway!> seem unattainable, just a little too crazy to be true. This certainly was one of those things. Sometime near third grade we heard about this college thing. Some children had even seen older brothers and sisters go to this mys­terimls place. I never thought I would make it. Think about it, you get to go live by yourself with 10,000 other kids in a place where no one can tell you what to do. When you are a child, that seems a little bit hard to believe. Come to think of it, it is hard for parents to believe too. 
Daniel De Carlo guest column 
As the youngest of three boys I saw what happenned to my parents and my brothers as one by ohe the children began to depart and hc~ad for the world of opportunity. College is one of those experiences in life that has the word "step" written all over it. College is a big step for the child and I think an even bigger step for the parents. 
College is one of those special times in life that has the power to dictate your fate. For 
 parents, sending a child to school is on par with bringing a child into the world. Most mothers and fathers will tell you the happiest times of their lives were when their children were born. The first born is always the biggest thrill, but the children that follow are not far behind. There is something about a birth that can cheer up just about anybody. Mom and Dad walk around with the bundle In their arms smiling from ear to ear as If to say, "Hey you, look what we made." The years that fullow are not always as smooth. It does not take long for most parents to discover that the kids take a little bit of work and an exhausting amount of love. So much love that an outsider might not be able to tell that what is going on in a certain house is indeed love. No matter what it sounds like, it is love. It just so happens that love takes on different faces. 
I can't say for sure, but I have been told that raising a child takes a lot of work. So much work that most parents look forward to the 
day when they can kick off their shoes, sit at 
home in peace and wait for that phone call 
from the university ofwherever. They "claim" 
that will be their day of peace. I have come to 
the conclusion that that is not always the case. 
It has been my experience that when all the 
children leave, parents become just a little bit 
deranged. 

For 18 years the parents have been a part 
each and every day of their child's life. 
the time comes they find it just a little hard . give that""'"iJp without a fight. When the 
child goes, the thought of being left 
does nor yet enter their minds; there are 
several more left to guide. But as each 
goes, a sense offright enters their hearts, 
finally it is time to send "the baby" to 
wolves. No one is left; there is no one left 
guide. It is at this point that many 
become irrational in their behavior. 
have spent the better part oftheir lives 
for orher human beings, and now they are 
with the sight ofan empty house for the 
part ofthe year. 

After all the children have left, parents to relate past family events in a warped hion. Stories that never really happened told to friends about their children. remember how their children were so always willing to lend a helping hand. say things to people like, "Our children cried when they were babies." Parents thrown into stages of blind reminiscence. of a sudden they have forgotten how their kids can be. When mom and dad through department stores, they are peaking into strollers saying absurd like, "Honey, should we have another 
College is indeed a big step for parents children alike. Pretty soon we will be home for a couple of weeks to spend much needed times with our families. look forward to our vacations because treasure the time without the pressure school. Our parents look forward to this ti because it allows them to spend time with projects into which they put so much and love. These three weeks are a chance them to pat themselves on the back for a well done.

D 
on't look now, but the 
Christmas shopping season has 
once again arrived. This brief 
period after the snowball civil war 
and before students leave the land ofparietals and alcohol policies is a pressure-packed time for everyone. So, as a service to students busy with finals, here are some time­saving Christmas gift ideas for the whole family. 
For those who can't stand losing sight ofthe Golden Dome, the Notre Dame Bookstore comes to the rescue. This is a unique store where one can buy clothes, gifts and everyday items-each ofwhich has "Notre Dame" written all over it. The bookstore is the perfect stop for younger brothers and sisters who love anything associated with Notre Dame, especially sweatshirts. On-campus shopping not only saves time but usually makes everyone happy. 
For those who wish to ventul"e away from campus, there are all ldnds ofwonderful new toys just begging to be bought. 
To be like everyone else, one can get the toddler in the family a Cabbage Patch doll, which comes complete with its own birth certif­icate. A more original gift is a n.-w.-rl'!f\~'\":ltl doll, an updated version ofa popular candy. That's right, direct from the local vending machine come the Gummi Bears -Gruffi Gummi, Zummi Gummi, Cubbi Gummi and Tummi Gummi. For slightly older people there is the

Calvin Klein designer sleepwear, guin cocktail shaker for a mere S400, a definite contrast to Earl the Dead Cat. Still stuck for a nice gift? Here's one that will look great in big brother's apartment -a bean bag chair shaped to look like him, sol­ving any lack ofseating he might have. 
something no fashion-conscious Kids ofall ages, especially those prep student should be without. Or, who enjoy the popular holiday there's always the latest spin-off television show, "The Grinch That from Dynasty, Forever Krystal eau Stole Christmas," will always be de toilette spray. For only 20 bucks grateful for an electro-Whomordial an ounce, women can smell just like schnook or maybe a Hoober­
magnetical frunck, so keep those in mind. 
What to get Mom has always been a difficulty, but it's a pr_oblem no more. Every mother needs the new Girmi espresso/cappuccino maker, which sells for a mere $300. It even fits right underneath the cupboud, so she can get rid ofthat old, bulky espresso/cappuccino maker which has caused such a space problem for so many years. 
As if that's not enough, another gift-giving possibility is a year's membership in the Coffee ofthe Month club. Just think, exotic cof­fee beans from all over the world delivered right to the family's door 
every month; Mom will be over­
whelmed. 
IfMom doesn't like coffee but is inclinced more toward fashion, maybe she would enjoy decorator potato chips. Imagine, the tradi­tional potato chip in four beautiful colors, perfect for all occasions. 
Now what is there to get for Dad? Never fear, plenty ofgifts remain. From Presto comes the electric shoe polisher, which polishes and shines in one easy step. But he probably already has one ofthose. Is he a car buff? For only S21,000 an authentic London taxi can be his. If Dad's not interested in cars, there's always the old stand-by gifts of ties or underwear -what he probably receives every year anyway. 

Also, one might want to keep in mind the new video game/breath analyzer for those out-of-hand parties. For S3,000 this toy will tell a partier when he's had too much to drink and then laugh in his face. 


What about the family pets? Made especially for the lovable kitten or cat, personalized kitty dishes com­plete with personalized placemats are popular this year. And for Spot, Niemann-Marcus stores offer a S23,000 fur coat to keep him warm

Saint's charity proof enough of Santa 
J. CHRISTOPHER MURPHY 
feotuNJs writer 
" I knew in a moment it must be 
St. Nick." This line from the 
famous poem '"Twas the Night 
&fore Christmas" invokes images 
ofcelebration around the world as 
children laugh and play. St. Nicolas 
has arrived and everyone is happy. 
But who is this St. Nicolas? Why is 
he better known as Santa Claus? Is 
he really a saint -even a real person 
for that matter-or is he simply a 
toy-toting gentle old man? 
St. Nicolas was born ofand raised by noble Christian parents, and he lived their example all his life. He entered the monastery at a very young age and thus is closely as­sociated with children; he is known as the patron saint ofchildren and students. At a relatively young age, Nicolas became bishop ofMyra in Asia Minor in the early part ofthe 4th century. Stories ofhis kindness spread throughout Europe: during the 1300s, with his popularity be­coming greater after his death. 
While still a young priest in the monastery, Nicolas heard ofthe misery of three daughters ofa local and once very wealthy man. The girls were not accustomed to work and thus were helpless in their new-found poverty. 
As the girls had no dowry with wbich to catch a husband, Nicolas secretly threw a bag ofgold, equiv­alent to the sum ofa sizable dowry, through the window of the daughters' room on each of three

'Rocky' perpetuates anti-Russian hysteria

argive me, Father, for I have never seen a "Rocky" movie. Oh, sure, I saw parts of the original film on nr, but all I remember is that some stupid and greasy -albeit very big-Italian gets a

woman named Adrian and fight "The Champ" to a draw. 
That makes me the perfect person to review "Rocky lV," Sylvester Stallone's latest sequel. I'm objective. I haven't seen "Rambo," even. 
So I asked my roommate to tell me the "Rocky" story from start to finish. It's a good thing he did. "Rocky IV" has a hard time standing on its own. 
J:n "IV," Rocky Balboa (Stallone) is living luxuriously in semi-retirement with his wife Adrian (Talia Shire), who is now magically beautiful, his son Rocky Jr. (Rocky Krakoff) and his brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young). Hi!i best friend is Apollo Creed (Carl W eat· hers), who he once destroyed in the ring. 
ll.ike the "commie hotbed" that it is, the So·viet Union spoils Rocky's happiness. The Russians announce that they are entering the world ofprofessional boxing and come to the United States with Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), world heavyweight amateur champion. He's 6'6", weighs 240 pounds and has been trained using the most modern fit11ess equipment available. Though his body's been tuned like a fine piano, it reacts with the brute force ofa Soviet tank. 
Theater 

 The Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Theatre presents Noel Coward's comedy "Hay Fever" tonight and tomorrow night in O'Laughlin Auqitorium. Directed by Roberta Rude, a new member of the Saint Mary's faculty, the play recounts a weekend at the English country estate of the Bliss family. Each ofthe four family members has invited a guest for the weekend without informing the others of the additional occupants. The collection ofguests includes an innocent young boxer, a Gothic novelist, an actress, a flapper and a diplomat. The author demonstrates his mastery of English wit as he guides the play from comedy to farce. Tickets for the 8:10p.m. shows are S5 and 
S6.

The exhibit"Africa and the Americas: A Curator's Choice," con­tinues this weekend in The Snite's O'Shaughnessy West Gallery. Examples of the museum's finest paintings and sculptures with ceremonial and ritual functions will be on display. A pictograp­hic painting ofthe Battle ofthe Uttle Big Horn by a Crow Indian named White Swan, a Dagon wooden figure from the year 1620 and a 17th century pre­Colombian bone bloodletter from Xoc· 
hicalco, Mexico, are among the featured works. The show is open to the public. Museum hours are 10 am. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Friday, I to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday and Thursday evenings from 4 to 8 p.m. 
People in the United States start saying: "Hey, wouldn't it be great ifour American­stud champion would beat up this guy and prove we are superior to those pagan Mar­xists?" But Rocky, with considerable pressure from Adrian, isn't about to get his face bloodied again. 
Cre,ed isn't as intelligent. Deciding he's the one to defend America, he agrees to fight the Russian. After considerable hype, the two meet in the glittering Ziegfeld room ofthe MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas. 
As the preveiws show, Creed is defeated· badly. And Rocky feels that he must defend the honor ofhis defeated friend. 
But the Russians, lead by Drago's wife Ludmilla (Brigitte Nielsen), demand that the fight be held in the Soviet Union · on Christmas. 
The rest is predictable. Rocky trains in an isolated spot in Siberia which could double for South Bend, except that it has mountains And the Soviets are evil, godless peasants who hang pictures ofLenin on everything. Eventually, he fights. 
I use the word "fight" ioosely. These guys don't fight. They pummel each other with force that, if realistic, no one could survive. This isn't boxing; this is science fiction. 
The story is adequate, though one really needs to know the "Rocky" story to under­stand it. Fortunately for United Ani.sts, everyone has either seen the movie or has a friend, neighbor or roommate who can tell them about it. 
The movie epitomizes the Rocky-Rambo­Reagan brand ofpatriotism which seems to be popular now. In the end, however, the message of the movie is surprisingly good­natured. 
For those who think Stallone's a cool dude or just hate Russians, "Rocky IV'' will prove enjoyable. But for people who are tired of watching Stailone movies and realize that Russians are humans, too, it might be better to save S4 and read a book.

Mexican-style restaurant makes thick margaritas

Y 
es, Virginia, there is a classy place to eat and drink In South Bend. It's called Senor Kelly's, a stylish combination lounge, res­taurant and disco in the heart of the city's business district. 
IfSouth Bend has yuppies, this is where you'll find them. Across the street from the Marriott Hotel, Senor Kelly's offers a bit of 
11,~ The Bar Beat ~ /: -·.~ Senor Kelly's ~:~Ll!"' {***(out ottour) 
Mexican flavor in a smart, rather degant 
atmosphere that seems to cater directly to 
-
the young urban business professional. 
The front portion of the establishment is the lounge, a spacious and attractive area distinquished by its brass-and-wood decor. Seating is available at the bar, at tables or at a long, high counter in the center ofthe room. 
The popular drink at Senor Kelly's is the Margarita, served by the glass, the mug or the liter. One will find the Margaritas here thicker and richer than the comparable drink for which the rival Chi Chi's Mexican res­taurant is famous. 
A good selection ofbottled Imports and draft beer is also available. 
In addition to the standard nachos-and-dip routine found at most Mexican-style bars, Senor Kelly's features a complimentary hot hors d'oeuvres table from 4 to 7 p.m. every day. Here one'll find a great variety ofbite-sized delights, including Mexican bean treats 
and the not-so-Mexican cocktail franks and 
chicken wings. 

The main rear portion ofSenor Kelly's is the cafe, a simple but elegant restaurant that serves a great variety ofMexican and American food. The menu features everyth­ing from chicken enchiladas to taco salad to New York strip steak. The quality of the food as well as the price range: clearly indicate that this place is no Taco Bell. 
Senor Kelly's also has an adjoining side room which houses the discoteque. Open Wednesday through Saturday nights, this long, narrow room is stylishly furnished and features a rather modem dance floor, com­plete with a laser lighting package and live DJ. It's not Rush Street, but the singles scene here does hop on weekend nights. 
The crowds at Senor Kelly's are just what one might expect: business people and assorted singles in the 23-to 35-year-old age group. The clientele is well-dressed and well-mannered. 
For those who feel like dressing up a bit and enjoying a nice drink or Mexican dinner, Senor Kelly's is a good idea. One should bring his own group offriends, though, -the slightly older local crowd does not seem to be overly anxious to socialize with Domers. It might cost a bit more than the average dive, but customers are paying for atmo­sphere as well as drinks. 
Located at 119 N. Michigan, Senor Kelly's is open from 10 a.m to 10 p.m. on Sunday, 10 
a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and 10 a.m. to midnight on Friday and Satur­day.

Professor Clancy on 'designer genes' 

Mary Clancy, who teaches the under­graduate course in genetics, Joined the Notre Dame faculty in 1982. 
Mary became interested in molecular genetics while an undergraduate at Cornell University, and went on to graduate study at Princeton University. While there, she ac­quired a Ph.D., a husband (Bob Tax)and two cats. The Clancy-Tax family now lives near downtown South Bend, in a large Victorian bouse which they hope to fix up sometime before they retire. 
Let her tell you why her research, the ul­timate in "designer genes," bas conspired to delay the renovations. 
John Kozak something different 
I teach a big class, so I often have student 
visitors in the afternoon. IfI'm having a lucky 
day (not so often at this point in the 
semester), they find me in my lab, standing in 
front of a lab bench strewn with Erlenmeyer 
flasks, test tubes, beakers and other parapher­
nalia. It's mostly familiar stuff to anybody who 
has struggled through high school chem and 
Emil. 
Nonetheless, first time visitors stand uncer­tainly in the hallway, eyeing the big yellow sign on the door. It says, "Caution, Radioactive Material, Authorized Personnel Only," and deters all but the most intrepid, at least for a minute. Once they make it past the sign, though, most students seem curious about what actually goes on in the lab. They want to know about molecular biology research, but they also want a glimpse of the other, alien university that coexists with their own. Here, the major concerns are research, publica­tions, grants and other forms of mature scholarly activity. Many students don't believe it, but most faculty are more than eager to share this part of their lives with them. 
So what actually goes on in my lab? To ex­plain this requires a little bit of digression. Most people are familiar with the notion ofthe "genetic code" the set of n&les by which a series of nucleotides or bases, on DNA molecule (A,G,C,T) is read in words of three such that the cellular machinery. for con­structing proteins translates a particular se­quence of three nucleotides to mean a 
particular amino acid. For example, the se­quence A TG corresponds to a methionine in the final protein molecule (an RNA which is a replica ·of the DNA sequence) and an "adaptor" molecule called a tRNA. The adap­tor recognizes the code word on the mes­senger and allows it to be physically matched up with the proper amino acid. Thus, con­struction ofa protein involves a nucleotide se­quence as well as a recognition-adaptor molecule, which tells the other non-specific 
enzymes in the cell where and how to act. 
That's the genetic code that most people know about. But, ifyou think a little bit about nucleic acids, you'll realize that there must be much more coded information in the DNA se­quence than just this. The enzymes in the cell must have some way to recognize where in­dividual genes begin and end, and whera to start making RNA molecules. The DNA must be replicated every generaion, starting at a specific place. It turns out, also, that RNA molecules are modified before they actually · 
are translated, by addition of a series of A nucleotides to one end, and by removal and 
rejoining of particular pieces within the 
molecule. There must be a kind of second 
genetic code, to allow the cell to do all these 
things properly. This information must be em­
bedded within the DNA sequence, perhaps, in 
a way analogous to that ofthe genetic code for 
protein sequences. 

The simple-minded solution to this actually 
turns out to be true, for a change. Particular 
DNA sequences "mean" certain things to the 
cellular machinery, apart from the traditional 
meanings of the genetic code. For example, 
the sequence TATA means "start an RNA 
molecule 30 bases down from here," while 
the sequence AUAAA means "cut this 
molecule 50 bases down and add some A 
residues to the end." Similar types of code 
words exist for the beginning and end of DNA 
replication, and for various types of RNA 
modifications. Thus, this second genetic code 
shares many propenies with the first, since 
particular sequences of DNA are recognized 
and acted upon, although not literally 
translated, by specific effector molecules wit­
hin the cell. 

The second genetic code is less universal and less rigid than the first, since variations are possible for some ofthe sequences. TheTATA sequence, for example, is not exactly the same for all genes; it may be TATAA, TATATA, TATAAA, etc. Almost all genes have some ver­sion of this sequence, though, in ap­proximately the same place, so that people are pretty confident that TAT A is imponant. It does seem rather strange that this son of sloppiness is allowed to occur in biological systems, where precision should be the rule. 
Perhaps the protein molecules which 
recognize these sequences are not simple 
adaptors lik~ tRNA, and take a more active 
role in assuring specificity. 

The third type of genetic code is not yet understood, and is the basis for work in my lab. We know, at least in outline, what signals are needed to make proper RNAs and protein. These include TATA and other sequences mentioned above. The next question is, how 
does the cell know when to express a par­ticular gene? All genes have all ofthe right sig­nals all of the time, because their sequences are identical in every cell ofan organism. How is it, then, that many genes are most quiet most of the time? All of the inforamtion must be present, but not acted upon. Thus, another layer of"code" must be needed, to modulate the extent and timing of expression of genes in different cells. This question is a tough one and is going to keep a lot oflabs busy for quite a longtime. 
It is already clear that the third layer ofcode is going to be much more complicated than the first two. Unlike the proteincode, which is interpreted by adaptor molecules which are identical for every gene in every cell, the third <:ode will have to involve modulations in the adaptors themselves. Thus, to truly under­stand how any particular gene is regulated, it will be necessary to identify both of the im­fiOttant components: the DNA sequence which is being read, and the protein molecules which interact with this sequence. 
In my lab, we are studying a set ofregulated genes in a simple yeast. These genes are not expressed at all under normal conditions, and are very dramatically "turned on" during meiosis. All six of the genes we are looking at act exactly the same way, and we think that they may share a regulatory signal with each other that most other genes in the cell would lack. We have cloned these genes and are now

veteran Sooner squad that features a run-and-gun offense. Oklahoma just missed qualifying for the NCAA tournament last year. Other teams in Notre Dame's division include Dayton, Fairfield, LaSalle, Miami and South_west Texas. 
"We will play three games in four 
days, which is not as taxing as the 
older two-games-in-one-day format 
used in the Regional tournament 
just a few years ago," said DiStanis­
lao. "It is tough, but these are condi­
tioned athletes. 
Injuries to Heidi Bunek, Beth 
Morrison and Willis have cut down 
the depth on the front line, a situa­
tion which has forced pressure on 
the rest of the team. Trena Keys, a 
6-1 senior forward, has been the catalyst for the Irish all season. "She has to be a leader since she gets the most playing time, and has 
the experience and the most tools," Distanislao said. "But she isn't the whole team, she has a very good cast around her." 
The accomplishmants so far ofthe Irish freshmen must not be over­looked. 
"Diondra Toney, (a 5-9 guard), 
has contributed many imponant 
minutes, said Distanislao. "She is a 
multi-faceted player, and she plays 
bigger that she is when getting 
rebounds. She will replace the 
graduating Lynn Ebben, who has 
been our utility player. Lisa Kuhns, 
(a 5-1 0 forward), has good instincts 
and is a fine shooter." 
The team will finish its action during break at Rutgers, who has a long tradition of winning, and is especially tough t.o play at home. The Knights possess depth and a top­n·otch forward in Sue Wicks.

SMC swimming wins 1st 
ByANDREA LaFRENIERE 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's swim team defeated Nonh Central College, 76­24, last night in the Belles' first home dual meet of the season at the Rockne Memorial Swimming Pool. Head Coach Nancy Jo Kemnitz was pleased with the Belles' performance. 
"This was an excellent meet for us. We had some really good per­formances, and we had some surprises, too," said Kemnitz. 
Among the standouts was freshman Peggy Halloran, who finished first in two events. Halloran won the 1000-meter freestyle with a time of 12:19.7 and the 500-meter freestyle with a time of6:01.4. 
Other first-place winners for the Belles were sophomore Meghan Raffeny, who won both the 100-meter backstroke and the 100­meter freestyle event. Junior Margaret Mannion finished first in the 200-meter freestyle. and the 100-meter breaststroke. Sophomore Heidi Traxler finished third in the latter event. 
Juniors PattyJuckniess and Mary Fisher gave the Belles a one-two finish in the 50-meter freestyle. 
Sara Maurer, a freshman, finished second in the 200-meter in­dividual medley, and senior Anne Cushing took third in the 500­meter freestyle. 
Saint Mary's placed first in two relay events. In the 200-meter medley relay, the team of Mannion, Raffeny, Jennifer Burke and Tanya Reeves had a winning time of 2:07.1. The 200-meter freestyle relay team of Fisher, Juckniess, Maurer, and Raffeny finished first with a time of 1:51.

mediately after the Valpo game and 
won't be required to return until the 
night of the 26th, when an evening 
workout will be held. 
Titree more days of practice will 

follow before the Irish play host to 
Creighton on Dec. 30. Notre Dame 
has a debt lO repay in that game. Last 
year the Bluejays upset the visiting 
Irish, 60-<;8. 
"We played very poorly in Omaha 

last year," Phelps recalls, "and I 
would hope our players would 
remember that. We were coming off 
a three-week layoff and it showed. 
The situation is similar this year, so 1 
would hope we would be better 
prepared. We've just got to come 
out and play our game and get back 
In the swing of things after the time 
0.II." 
The Bluejays lost their lOp gun, 

7-0 center Benoit Benjamin, to the 
NBA and are looking to regroup un­
der this year under new coach Toii.y 
Barone. At this point in the season, 
Creighton is 2-2 with five more 
games on its schedule before the 
date with the lri~h. 
The first of four road games is 

next, when Notre Dame travels to 
the Palestra in Philadelphia for a jan. 
4 contest with LaSalle. The game wiU 
be a homecoming for Irish freshman 
guard Mark Stevenson, a native of 
the city ofbrotherly love. 
"LaSalle is always a tough game for 

us," Phdps says. "They lost some 
good players off the team we beat 
here last year. The key for us wiU be 
how well we stop their outside 
shooting." 
The Explorers lost their top two 

scorers of last season, Steve Black 
and Ralph Lewis, to graduation. That 
pair combined for over 38 points a 
game for LaSalle and will be heavily 
missed. 
Titrce days later, the Notre Dame 

travelling party will be in 
Providence, R.I., for a game with the 
friars of Providence College. The 
Irish came out on top by a 70-63 
margin in the last year's meeting at 
thcACC. 
"Providence has got a new coach, 

a good coach, In Rick Pitino," says 
Phdps. "They will play multiple 
defenses, which is going to force us 
to read some things." 
Traditional rival DePaul shows up next on Notre Dame's agenda, with the Irish visiting Chicago's Rosemont Horizon on jan. 11. Despite finishing as the nation's top Independent last season, Notre Dame lost both of its games to the Blue Demons. 
As usuaJ, DePaul will rely on 
speed, rebounding and the transi­
tion game to get the job done and 
should be better adjusted to Head 
Coach joey Meyer now that Meyer is 
in his second year at the helm. 
"We haven't played well in the Horizon yet against DePaul," says Phelps. "This will be an important game for us in terms of getting an NCAA Tournament bid. Rodney Strickland (DePaul's freshman guard) and David Rivers will be the key matchup here." 
The finaJ road stop for Notre Dame will be Provo, Utah, where the Irish play Brigham Young onJan. 13. The Cougars suffered heavy losses to graduation and church missions. BYU's top three scorers in Timo Saarclaincn, Scott Sinek and Andy Toulson all have departed from the squad which dropped a 67-58 deci­sion to the Irish last season at the ACC. 
Notre Dame lost two years ago at the 22,700-scat Marriott Center and will have an equally-tough time this season. 
Of the six games over break, it really is the four road contests which will spell success· or failure for the Irish. 
"These arc four games that we've got to win," Phelps says, "because we've got so many tough games on the road coming up later in the season. We can't go below .500 on the road schcdulc.lfwc play.500 on the road and win all our home games, we'll be in good shape."

l Yanks, Sox trade pitchers 
Associated Press 

SAN DIEGO -The New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox sdtled for second-best. swapping pitchc:rs when they really wanted to trade hitters, as the official portion ofbaseball's annual winter meetings came to a close yesterday. 
The trade that the two clubs made 

sent left-bander Britt Burns and two 
minor leaguers to the Yankees for 
right-hander Joe Cowley and 
catcher Ron Hassey. 
The trade the Yankees and White 

Sox might yet make would send free­
lagent catcher Carlton Fisk to the Yankees for designated hitter Don Baylor. 
The deal was the 11th at these 

meetings, involving 25 major league 
players. 
Before making the second deal with New York, The White Sox must first sign Fisk, and both players are demanding bonuses for waiving no­trade rights. Agent Jerry Kapstein, who represents each, said Thursday that neither has yet given assurances these rights will be waived. 
Though neither club would con­firm that the Fisk-Baylor deal would be made, White Sox General Manager Ken Harrelson said, "it's Kapstein's party now.

Bengals, Skins meet; decide fat.es 
WASHINGTON· The Washington 
Redskins and Cincinnati Bengals will 
be looking to keep their National 
Football League playoff hopes alive 
Sunday · and looking at the 
scoreboard. 

The Redskins, 8-6, are one game 
behind the Dallas Cowboys and New 
York Giants in the National Football 
Conference East, with the co-leaders 
meeting Sunday at Irving, Texas. 

"IfI don't see it first, I know there 
will be 56,000 fans who will be 
watching the scoreboard letting the 
players know what's happening," said Washington Coach joe Gibbs. 
Victories in their final two games, coupled with a Giants' victory over Dallas Sunday, virtually would give the Redskins a wild-card berth in the playoffs. 
Cincinnati Coach Sam Wyche, meanwhile, said he would tell his players to ignore the scoreboard, specifically the game involving American Conference Central co­leader Cleveland and the Houston Oilers. 
ACincinnati victory coupled with 
a Cleveland loss would give the Ben­
gals their first division title since 
1981. 

"What happens with Cleveland doesn't make a difference ifwe don't win," said Wyche. "If we don't beat the Redskins, we're not going anywhere." 
Neither the scoreboard nor their opponents on the field have made much difference of late to the Ben­gals, who have moved into conten­tion with five victories in their last seven games, raising their record to 7-7. 
Their offense in high gear, the 
Bengals are coming off one of the 
most convincing victories in their 
history, having whipped the Cow­
boys S0-24 last Sunday, setting a 
dub rushing record of274 yards and 
rolling up 570 yards in total offense. 

The Bengals, who have gained more than 500 yards two straight weeks, have scored 394 points this season, including at least 3S points In five games. 
"It will take a little trickery, a lot of luck and at least 31 points to beat them," said Redskins assistant coach Richie Petitbon. 
"The Dallas game Is a potential

problem," said Wyche. "There is al­ways a chance ofa subconscious let­down after a big win. That's all people In Cincinnati have been talking about for a week." 
Bengals fans have had a lot to talk 
about this season beginning with 
quarterback Boomer Esiason. 
Esiason has thrown for 2,816 yards 
and 23 touchdowns. 

"He is throwing as well as anyone 
we have seen this year," said Gibbs. 
Esiason will have to be on his 
game against a Redskins' secondary 
that has allowed fewer than 166 
yards passing and is ranked No. 2 in 
the league. 

Cris Collinswonh, with 59 catches for 1,016 yards and four TDs, and rookie Eddie Brown, with 46 receptions for 789 yards and 6 TDs, lead the receiving corps. 
The Bengals' running game is powered by james Brooks ( 865 yards, 7 TDs) and Larry Kinnebrew ( 662 yards, 9 TDs ). 
The Redskins will counter with 
the league's second-best rushing 
game and the league's top 1·2 
receiving punch. 
An Monk (74 catches) and Gary 
Clark ( 62) have combined for more 
receptions than any pair of wide 
receivers in the league. 
On the ground, the Redskins have averaged better than 155 yards per game. George Rogers, who has replaced john Riggins in the team's single-back attack, rushed 36 times for 150 yards in last week's 17-12 victory ov1er Philadelphia. 
At quarterback, the Redskins feature Jay Schroeder. Since replac­ing injured Joe Thelsmann, Schroeder has led the Redskins to victories in three offour games. 
Schroeder suffered a cracked rib last Sunday, and as insurance the Redskins signed \'eteran Steve Bankowski, who was released by At­lanta.

Men's and women's basketball fac·e b 
Men have tough road trip ahead 
ByJEFF BLUMB 
Sports Editor 

Notre: Dame: basketball coach Digger Phc:lps has 
called a timeout. 1be 4-1 Irish now will cease: practicing 
for sc:vc:ral days to take: their final exams along with the 
rest of the: student body. lbere are no practices today 
through Sunday to prepare for finals, and attendance at 
next week's workouts, save Friday's, will be optional. 
Following the: conclusion of final exams, the 17th­
ranked Irish will face six games over the: sc:mestc:r 
brc:ak, including four tough road contests. Success in 
these: six games could play a big part In how Notre 
Dame: fares the: rest ofthe: sc:ason. 

But first all players must contend with their final ex­
ams, a key Ingredient for staying eligible: to play during 
the: sc:cond sc:mc:stc:r. wt year the Irish managed to 
come through first sc:mester with everyone eligible, but 
recent years prior to that hadn't been quite: as kind. 
"I always sweat the final exam period," says Phelps. "We just have to be patient with our players in terms of practicing. though, because of the: commitment to academics we have at Notre Dame." 
From all indications, it doesn't appear that any players are in sc:rious academic trouble at the presc:nt time. 
ValparaJso wiU visit the ACC on Dec. 21, the day after finals are over. Not many people are giving the Crusaders a chance to win this game as Notre Dame has won the last 26 contests between the two teams. 
"We're: going to be coming off final exams, so it's going to be difficult for us to be sharp," says Phelps.  "Valpo had a tremdously young team a year ago, and I'm sure that's going to begin to pay off this year for them. Thc:y'U have a whole: week to prepare for us, and our preparation time will be very limited." 
The players are free to go home for Christmas im­

holiday schedules Women to meet Marquette today 
By MIKE SZYMANSKI 
Sports Writer 
While most Notre Dame students study for finals and then relax over break, the Notre Dame women's basket· 
· ball team will be facing tough rivals and a prestigious tournament over the next month and it is aiming to es­tablish a higher national ranking. 
The Irish travel to Marquette today, where they will have to pressure: the Warriors' fine perimeter shooting game, according to head coach Mary DiStanislao. 
"With finals ahead, the players have to keep a balance between academics and basketball," DiStanislao. "We try to indulge their requests and make adjustments. We will be travelling without Lavetta Willis and Denise: Bas­ford, who will stay back to study." 
· The team returns to the ACC Sunday to take on a

 usc: our offense: to force them to play defense:." -~ Right after finals, the team has little chance to catch 
their breath as they face rival UCLA, a team that soundly , 
beat the Irish last year after Christmas break, 78-51. "UCLA is not as strong on the front line as previous ~ years, but they will have: experience and solid outside shooting," said DiStanislao. Next, Notre Dame will go to Florida for the Miami Tournament to play in a two-part affair. 
"The Super Eight tourney will Include top 1 0 teams, while our tournament will have teams who want to be in the top 10. It will be very intense," predicted DiS­tanislao.

The Notre: Dame wrestling team took another step toward reassuring Its status as a quality squad Wednes­day at the: Valparaiso Tournament where they scored a ~8-0 triumph over Valparaiso and. more impor­tantly in Head Coach Fran McCann's view, a first-ever victory over a solid Drake team, 27-14. 
"Valparaiso will most likely be dropped next year in order to upgrade our schedule," McCann ex· plained. "The victory over Drake, however, is a stepping-stone for the future. They are a good team, the type of team that we have to beat consistently in order to ·begin to defeat the great teams." 

In the Drake contest, the Irish received key pins from 134-pound Jerry Durso, 150-pound Greg Goad and heavyweight Mark Antonetti to carry them to victory. 
"The three pins by Durso, Goad, and Antonetti were areal factor in winning the match," said McCann. "Those points are hard for the other team to make up." 
Other victories against Drake were scored by Dave Carlin at 126 pounds, Pat Boyd at 14 2 pounds and· Chris Geneser at 167 pounds. 

In the Valparaiso rout, the Irish had six pins, including five by fresh­men. The pins were recorded by senior Eric Crown at 118 pounds, Matt Primich at 177 pounds, Carlin, Durso, Goad and Antonetti. 
Other victories were recorded by sophomores Ron Wisniewski and Dan Corrigan and freshmen Spero Karas and Geneser. 
The Irish will take a break for finals before trying to continue their impressive performance so far this year. They will travel to Evanstone. Ill., to compete in the 4o-team Mid­lands Tournament. 
"Aside from the NCAA tourna­ment, the Midlands is probably the most prestigious tournament," McCann said. "All the top schools wiU be there because it is a special­invite-only tournament." 
McCann hopes the tough com· petition will help his wrestlers in the longrun. 
"I'm approaching this tournament just like the Las Vegas Invitational (in which the Irish placed 13th out of 44 teams)," noted McCann." The Midlands will provide the best of both worlds as far as competition is concerned." 
"There wiU be a few Olympians at the meet, as well as the best post­graduate wrestlers in the country." 
This may seem like a tall order for a young team, but McCann said he feels it will be beneficial to the team. 
"I just want to give our young kids exposure against the best competi­tion, which will prepare them for tough matches in the future, and will simply improve their overall perfor­mance." 
The time has come to tie up a few loose ends 
These days it seems that everyone is trying to get ready for final exams by tying up any loose ends they might have. Not to be left out, there are a lot of sports-related things everyone should be aware of before they head home for Christmas. 
Be that as it may, today is the day to tie up a lot ofloose ends in the Observer sports department. 
The University of Virginia recently was given the Col­lege Football Association's award for best graduation rate of football players. Notre Dame and Penn State both received honorable mention by the CFA for their gradua­tion rates. 
Since the award's inception in 1981, Notre Dame has won It twice, In 1982 and '83, and was a co-winner with Duke last year. Duke also won the award its first year. 
1be award is given basc:d on each school's graduation rate: ofits football players over a five-year period. Computa­tion of the rate: Includes players who transfer or drop out for whatever reason. 
Notre Dame was judged this year on Gerry Faust's first­ever crop ofrecruits, those: which arrived in South Bend in the: fall of 1981. 
 

Irish tailback Allen Pinkett finished eighth in the balloting for this year's Heisman Trophy behind such presc:ason favorites as Do Jackson ofAuburn and Chuck Long oflowa, as well as a non-entity in September, Lorenzo White ofMic­higan State:. 
Pinkett also failed to receive recognition as either a first­or sc:cond-tc:am AU-American. 

Jeff Blumb 
Sports Editor 
Unfortunately, Pinkett's accomplishments in the past 
season were often lost in the controversy surrounding 
Gerry Faust. The holder of more Notre Dame career 
records than one can keep track of, Pinkett wasn't helped 
by the 5-6 record ofthe Irish, either. 
A total team player and a classy individual as well, the well-spoken senior deserved much more in the way ofac­colades. In fact, he probably was the most well-rounded Heisman candidate in the country this year. 
Pinkett was the model of grace even in the toughest of times during the sc:ason. The losses hurt him probably worse: than any other player on the team because of his undying dedication to the success of the team. 
I ':an honestly say that I have never encountered a finer individual than Allen Pinkett in alll my dealings with Notre Dame athletes and coaches. I feel fortunate to have had the chance to work with him. 
Best ofluck next year in the NFL. 
 

l11e decision of Lou Holtz to return Joe Yonto to an active coaching role cannot be praised enough. Yonto is one of the best defensive line co:lches in the country and, 
perhaps more importantly, is an excellent teacher of col­
lege football players. 
Gerry Faust made a big mistake five years ago in choos­
ing not to utilize Yonto's talents. You don't just throw away 
1 7 years of experience under Ara Parseghian and Dan 
Devine, no siree. 
Yonto has a good rapport with the players, and despite his age, 60, should be highly beneficial to the 1986 team. It's really good to see some of the old guard back In the fold again. 
 

The Irish basketball team will be facing perhaps its most important test ofthe season next week with final exams. It is imperative that everyone stay eligible if the team hopes to reach all ofits goals the rest ofthe sc:ason. 
After Christmas, the Irish start a big four-game road trip which should give a better indication ofjust how good this team is. The 82-67loss to Indiana earlier this month was a sore spot, indeed, and showed ·that the Irish have a long way to before the NCAA Tournament in March. 
 

A recently published book, Hooping It Up, details the complete history of Notre Dame basketball. It features over 400 pages of facts on Irish basketball and includes information on the evolution of the Notre Dame women's 
program. Written by former Observer staffer and 1983 University graduate Tim Neely, it is on sale: at the bookstore.
