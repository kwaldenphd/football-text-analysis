Hesburgh wants amnesty study done at ND center 
by Terry Keeney Editor-in-Chief Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh, University president, Friday called for a year-long study of American policy toward amnesty for war resisters and suggested the study be conducted at the Notre Dame Center for Civil Rights. Hesburgh, a member of President Ford's Clemency Board, defended the work of the Board against charges by four other members in a minority report released Friday that the board was stacked by anti-
B-P forms alcohol guide 
by Phil Cac~ley Staff Reporter 
The Breen-Phillips Hall staff has developed their own way of dealing with the alcohol situation in the dorms. 
Faced with the problem of enforcing University ~egulati~ns uniformly t~ro~ghout the hall. the staff drafted a policy on alcohol at the beginmng of this year. The policy Is1used as a guide when dealing with matters involving alcohol. 
"We had no real problems, just a need for consistency," said Kathy Grace, hall president. Last year, different resident assistants applied the University rules on drinking to varying degrees, according to Grace. In an effort to remedy the in­consistencies, the staff met at the beginning of this year and held a workship. 
At the workshop, the rectress Ms. Jeanne Thomas, the assistant rectress, the r.a.'s and the hall president engaged in role playing and discussion of the matter. 
"Afterwards, we all sat down and wrote our own pol'icies. The incredible thing was that we all wrote the same thing," related Thomas. "What's fantastic about our policy is that it came from the staff, and not the Dean's Office." 
Grace said the policy is working well. She also stated that it was the only policy written by an individual dorm that she knew of on campus. 
The policy states briefly that it is illegal to drink when under the age of 21 in Indiana. It further states that public drinking or openly displaying alcohol will not be allowed. One section of the policy reads "Although the hall staff will de-emphasize the necessity of alcohol at parties, it will not act in a parental role and tell the students how to live with the law ... ". The policy also asserted that it is "each individual's responsibility to respect and protect the pe and order of the dorm community)' 
The most recent directive on alcohol 
issued by the Dean's Office bears a strong 
resemblance to the Breen-Phillips policy. 
The dlrective issued by Dean of Students war liberals who violated the mandate of the Board. 
In advocating a study of amnesty, Hesburgh explained that the experience of the Clemency Board leaves unanswered national policy questions on amnesty, selective service, and methods of discharge from the service. The Civil Rights Center, which now has over 120,000 pages of the Clemency Board reports and Fr. Hesburgh 's personal notes, would in­vestigate these areas. 
(continued on page 6) 
ND drinking rules 
The rules and regulations of the University do not allow any consumption of alcoholic beverages In any rooms other than residence rooms. This means th~t students may not drink alcoholic beverages in corridors, study rooms, or other -non­residence rooms in the residence halls. 
If students drink in their own rooms In violation of the alcoholic beverage laws of the State of Indiana, such students face the consequences of such state violations if the state law enforcement agencies become aware of and concerned with such violations. 
Kegs and ponies are not consistent with the above pol icy. The Security personnel at the gates have been instructed not to permit entrance of vehicles which contain either kegs or ponies. 
James A. Roemer Dean of Students 
James Roemer on September 15 states in particular "The rules and regulations of the University ... allow the consumption of alcoholic beverages in .. . t.tllilidence rooms... If students drink in their own rooms in violation of the alcoholic beverage laws of the state of Indiana such studentf face the consequences of such state violations ... " 
Thomas said the Breen-Phillips policy was shown to Roemer earlier this month. "He said he liked it," she remarked. 
Preliminary elections for the Student Life Council representatives will be held tomorrow in the residence halls from 11:30 
a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 5 p.m. to 6:30p.m. Voting places for off-campus students will be set up in the Huddle, in the library con­course, and at the Notre Dame apartments and Campus View. 
A forum for the four North Quad can­didates is scheduled tonight in the Keenan­Stanford chapel, stariting at 8 p.m. 
The finalists from both North and South Quads will meet in a forum Wednesday night in Grace Hall. Time and place will be announced later. The run-off elections will be next Thursday. 
One of the major issues of this year's campaign is that of the Student Life Council itself-is it an effective body? Is it worth it? 
The Obst>rver asked each of the ten student candidates to answer the following~ questions: "How effective can-will the SLC be? How can it be made more ef­fective?" 
The candidates' answers follow. The order in which the candidates are men­tioned was determined by lottery. 
Mike Richter <South Quad): I feel the SLC can have a great effect in university policy. Hesburgh can veto its proposals, but the SLC can then take them to the Board of Trustees. The Board probably won't override Hesburgh 's veto, but the SLC is the only direct link the students have ·to the Board. It's the only official meeting place for the students, faculty, and administrators to come together to communicate and present their views of the issues. 
The student representatives will have a definite say in how effective the SLC will be. The students must elect representatives who will demand the respect of both faculty and administrators. 
I think the roll-call of SLC meetings should be published, to help make sure people are there and to apply pressure to the representatives to do a better job. Stacy Weaver <North Quad>: The SLC can

Notre Dame students are apparently studying more this year than last year. 
In a poll conducted by the Observer, 60 percent of the students, randomly in­terviewed by telephone, stated that they are spending more time studying this year than last year. Thiry-six percent said they were studying less and three percent said they were studying the same amount of time. 
Of those noting an increase in study time, most said they wanted to do better academically this year, while some said their courses are more difficult than before. For many, the increase in study time was a considerable one. 
One student commented, "I'm studying more so I can pass." Another student lamented, "I know better now-that's why I'm studying more." 
Arthur G. Weigand, administrative assistant in charge of library security, 
only be as effective as its members make it. 
I'm sure we all feel the same way about the 
future of the SLC: more concrete action is 
needed and less empty words. 
But this has all been said before and a lot 
of action is inevitably stopped by the ad­
ministration. What we really need is more 
workable ideas that ca~1 become a reality at 
N.D. 
The members of the SLC must be 
dedicated to working out solutions to 
campus issues and realizing the needs of the 
student population. 
I do feel there is not enough interest in the 
SLC-an effective council needs student 
support. I am more concerned with working 
for the students-making a concerted effort 
to bring their ideas to light. 
The SLC will be a much more effective 
organization if a greater effort is made to 
find out the real student opinion on campus 
issues. 
Phil Mancini <Off-campus>: I think the SLC 
can be very effective if the representatives 
a void arguments over semantics and get 
down to talking about the real issues. 
It has to stop stalling over matters of little 
importance that are really just on the 
periphery. The smaller membership will 
allow the council to get more said and done. 
I have a great deal of respect for Ed Byrne. He's familiar with the faculty and administrators on the council and he knows the issues well. I think that will make things easier for us. 
The issues the SLC hf.s dealt with have 
remained pretty much the same these past 
three years. I hope this year we can get 
them resolved or at least on the path instead 

of having them floating in some kind of 
limbo. 

Tom Hogan <South Quad): The SLC can be as effective as the people on it want it to be and as effective as Hesburgh, with his veto power, will let it be. A great deal depends on how the administration views the SLC and reacts to its proposals.
(continued on page 2) 
commented that he did not notice more students studying at the library and that the number of students studying there fluc­tuates daily. 
Most of the students studying less men­tioned that they just haven't started studying seriously or haven't had much work yet. Increased dating and partying were also cited as reasons for decreased study time. "I want to have a good time while I can; I know how hard it's going to get,"said one student. 
Several students said the increase in study time did not interfere with extra­curricular activities due to more efficient use'of time. However, most students did note such interference. A junior English major stated, "If I had more time, I'd love to engage in many activities, but study~ takes up a large portion of my time, and the remainder goes toward my social life." 
Total weekly study time averages be­tween fifteen and thirty hours.

BRISBANE, Australia <AP) -Workers sealed the entrance to the Kianga coal mine Monday, entombing the bodies of 13 men killed Saturday when an explosion collapsed a mile of the un­derground shaft. 
The decision to seal the mine was made after air samples showed a deadly poisonous level of carbon monoxide. 
MIAMI <AP)-Tropical Storm Eloise regained some of the fury it had as a killer hurricane and began moving its gales and heavy rains Sunday toward the U.S. Gulf Coast, forecasters said. 
"Eloise could become a hurricane within 24 hours, and if it does 
strengthen much we might have a problem," said Neil Frank, 
director of the National Hurricane Center. 
Eloise killed at least 42 persons when it hit Puerto Rico and the 
Dominican Republic as a hurricane but lost its deadly punch before 
it crossed Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Sunday. 
BOSTON <AP)-Boston teachers voted overwhelmingly Sunday to defy a court injunction and go on strike against public schools Monday.

ND Hunger Coalition ca~npaigns 



byJohn Shaughnessy Staff Reporter 
Coinciding with National Week of Concern, Sept. 21-28, the Notre Dame World Hunger Coalition will officially open its 1975-76 campaign next Wednesday by sponsoring a fast and a mass. 
Coalition President Chris Brinegar stated, "We're taking this opportunity to shed light on certain facts about the hunger problem." Starvation accounts for an estimated 2300 deaths every hour, he explained. "The events will also give people a chance to show their concern with social inequality in a visible fashion." 
Fr. Frank Quinlaven, from the Holy Cross Justice of Peace Center, will celebrate the mass at 6

Church. The coalition also urges students

The Committee on Un­dergraduate Life (COUL) met last night to discuss committee recommendations made last year. 
Although no issues were discussed, the meeting em­phasized presenting campus issues to administrative officials by COUL members. 
At this stage of the follow-up reports, each member delivers his recommendations to the depart­ment of the University concerned. Once the department gives a response, the recommendation returns to the COUL for evaluation and then goes to the Board of Trustees.

to skip that day's evening meal. "Both actions will help lead the pledge for dining hall fasting throughout the semester," said Ceyl Prinster of the coaliton's communications committee. 
On Thursday during dinner coalition members will hand out pledge forms for those who wish to fast from meals every Wednesday night. Students who sign the form will have their meal ticket marked off from the dining hall list that evening. A 50 to 75 cent con­tribution is donated to the coalition for each person who fasts . The exact amount contributed depends upon the number of pledges . The more people involved, the more money the coalition will receive per meal. 
"Many people ask why the dining halls only contribute 50 or 75 cents per meal." Prinster said. 
finished in the top 20 per cent of their class and more than half finished in the top five per cent. 
The survey conducted by 
Daniel J. Saracino, associate director of admissions, shows 42 per cent of the new students were active in high school athletics, 45 per cent in student government, 52 per cent in National Honor Society activities, 28 per cent in debate or drama groups, and 25 per cent in choir or band. They come from 31 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Spain. 
Of the 105 enrollees, '1:l were designated as Notre Dame Scholars and will receive scholarship funds to assist in tuition payments. Another 11 received National Achievement scholarships, five received ROTC scholarships, eight received athletic grants-in-aid, and one student has become a seminarian in the Holy Cross order. 
45 of the students are in Arts and Letters, 28 in science and 16 each in the Colleges of Engineering and Business Administration.

"They think the program is getting ripped off. Actually they've been giving us the best deal possible considering their overhead. Although some students fast," she continued, " the dining halls still have electrical, service and per­sonnel expenses. We've been very pleased with their cooperation." Prinster said.

"Even though we could raise more money with greater par­ticipation, the actual fund-raising isn't the sole concern," Brinegar commented. "We just want people to feel in a small way what two­thirds of the world is feeling in a large way every day." 
Both Brinegar and Prinster cited an increase in the business of McDonald's, the Huddle and the halls' food sales on nights when the fast was in effect. Prinster stated, "We hope the people will really fast, not just go somewhere else to eat. Experiencing hunger is an important part of the plan," she said. 
The coalition plans three major programs involving South Bend community residents. The initial project, to be implemented during the first semester . will attempt to educate the · local area in the concepts needed to confront social inequality worldwide. 

Heading second smeester plans is the proposal of a congressional bill calling for an increase in non­military foreign assistance. A third program iintends to help any local businesses begin a payroll deduction plan. These funds will support the international development movement. All three projects will be conducted through the community's religious services and mass media. 
"Our goal is to try to educate people to the problems that exist in the world and provide some possible solutions: Brinegar said. 
The hunger coalition will have a meeting for anyone interested in helping the program on Monday night at 7 p.m. in LaFortune Ballroom.

Well, let us strive to get beyond, or rather back down to, things of more substance than the absolutely ridiculous discussions about 'redefining' our roles as men and women, not men-women or mothers-fathers or uni-uni, and give some time and energy to things that really do need time and energy. Couldn't it be that the current crises in the areas of abortion and contraception are of greater urgency than the present social (as in 'ice cream social') "crisis" here at Notre Dame'? Or couldn't we of somewhat more importance to spend our energies learning to develop personal virtues rather than clamoring for the imaginary Skinnerian box <or dormitory) panacea'? Or making the effort to live the Gospel rather than rewriting it'? 
In other words, now is the time to get our heads out of the self-centered clouds we have so placidly and sheepishly allowed to engulf us. Now is the time to consider things of greater depth than all this useless self-analysis. Now is the time to dedicate ourselves to the challenge of solving the real problems that are begging for our generosity.

Hesburgh asks review of amnesty program 
(continued from page 1) "I am concerned now to do an in­depth study for one year in which we would look at this mass of data from the -Clemency Board and determine the public policy that should emerge," Hesburgh said. "I think it could be done in a University context," he continued. "If we can take up this kind of study, it would be at the Center for Civil Rights." Hesburgh could not comment on
'i 
the feasibility or funding of such a study.
) 
Hesburgh dismissed charges made in the minority report issued last Friday by fellow bG.ard members retired Marine Corps Gen. Lewis Walt; Ralph Adams, president of Troy State University; James Dougovito, instructor at Michigan Technical University; and retired Army Col. Harry Riggs. 
The four charged that the Board was stacked with anti-war liberals who may have "misinterpreted, circumvented and violated at least the spirit" of President Ford's order to establish the Board. 
Hesburgh, an advocate of total, unconditional amnesty for war resisters, said, "My only response 
r 
to General Walt would be, 'The war is over'." 
Hesburgh called the Ford am­nesty program ''the most generous since President Washington, with the exception of the Civil War." 
He explained that of the 15,500 cases reviewed by the Board, 95 per cent received some kind of clemency, and over half of the applicants were granted un­conditional amnesty. The cases the Board reviewed were in­dividuals convicted in Federal or military court of crimes related to the Vietnam war. 
The second part, conducted by 
the U.S. Attorney General, dealt 
with the over 200,000 draft evaders, 
who had not been brought to trial. 
According to Hesburgh, less than 
ten per cent of those individuals 
were indicted and only 8600 were 
tried. 
Hesburgh pointed out that many 
draft evaders may be able to 
return to the U.S. since the At­
torney has declared only 4,000 of 
the 200,000 evaders as indictable. 
The third part of the amnesty 
program, dealing with military 
personnel who deserted, was 
conducted by the military. Nearly 
half of the deserters from Vietnam turned themselves in, according to Hesburgh. 
Military courts granted half the deserters a clemency discharge from the service on the condition that they perform alternate ser­vice. 
Hesburgh pointed out that the Clemency Board left some un­finished work to be completed by the Attorney General. 
"We have several hundred cases remaining where we did not have enough information," Hesburgh said. 
From the completed cases, Hesburgh could generalize about the average applicant for amnesty. 
"Your picture of the college kid going to Canada is a small part of the total number --two or three per cent I would say," Hesburgh said. 
He characterized many of the civilian applicants as "civilians

with a conscience problem" concerning the war and military amnesty applicants as "11Jilitary with family problems". 
Although an advocate of un­conditional amnesty, Hesburgh was pleased with the outcome of the pro~am.

Increased influence for SLC emphasized 

(continued from page 2) 
tation. 
The SLC will have to work closely with Student Government and Student Affairs. If they back us up we will be more convincing by making a united effort. 
John Lynch <Off-campus>: The reduction of the SLC membership to 15 from 24 should improve its effectiveness. It will be easier to determine the direction of the 
council and achieve a consensus of opinion. 
It will also reduce the anonymity of the members and should induce better attendan·ce and per­formance. 
Student confidence in the council must have hit a record low 
when Fr. Hesburgh vetoed the sex resolution the council put so much 
time into. What disappointed me especially 
was that Hesburgh took so long to 
render his decision due to !'other 
commitments." I think Fr. Hesburgh will have to take the council more seriously before 
students will. 
Faculty input is essential. Last year the faculty representatives
had the worst attendance record. 
The wisdom and weight the faculty can contribute to the council is necessary for the SLC to be ef­
fective. St'an McLinden <North Quad>: One problem with the SLC is that 
the faculty and administration regard the selection of their 
members as a real chore. They
have no real stake in the SLC and their representative may or may not be interested. 
The attendance from last year indicates that the faculty and 
administration didn't take the SLC seriously. If they don't take the council seriously, you can't expect the President of the University and the Board of Trustees to take it

Bradley sets record, saves Irish 
by Bill Brink Sports Editor 
It was a classic example of the 
'big play', the 'game-breaker', the 
'turnaround'. 

Whatever you want to call it, Luther Bradley's fourth quarter interception and subsequent 99 ,·ard return for a touchdown was he play of the day in the lrishs' 17­
o victory over Purdue Saturday afternoon in Ross-Ade Stadium. 
It may turn out to be the play of the season, for it certainly saved the game for ND. Going into the fourth quarter the Irish held a slim 3-0 lead, and the Boilermakers had advanced to the ND 4 yard line. Quarterback Craig Nagel, who replaced starter Mark Vitali early in the first quarter, moved the Boilers from their own 30 on three long passes, the last one a fantastic 31 yard completion to wing Paul Beery. It was first and goal at the 4, and a Purdue s.core seemed immanent. 
But the Irish defense, which had come through so often in the game, did the job again. After halfback Scott Dierking carried the ball twir.e for no gain, Purdue coach Al~x Agase reached into his bag of tricks in an effort to capture the lead and a second straight upset over the Irish. 
On third down and goal to go from the four, Nagel handed off to Dierking again. But this time Dierking pulled up and lofted a pass to the left side of the end zone, intended for none other than Nagel, who had raced out of the backfield. Bradley, howeveo;aw the play coming. He ran in front of

Nagel and picked off the wobbly
I pass at the 1, and with nothing ahea·d of him but daylight, he darted 99 yards down the sideline for the touchdown, giving the Irish 
point made it 17-0 with 7:59 left in the game. Bradley nearly had another 
interception a minute later, but fellow cornerback Tom Lopienski raced in front of him to pick off a third Nagel pass at the ND 45. Joe Montana came in at quarterback

to Doug Buth was intercepted in the end zone with 15 seconds left in the game. 
As in last weeks game against Boston College, it was again a case Of the Irl. sh defense rna king up for 

the lack of offensive execution. Hampered by youth and inex­perience, the Irish '0' suffered from little mistakes which stalled their drives in the first half. Quarterback Rick Slager had two good passes dropped in the first quarter, and one time the offense stood still after a snap thinking that the play was dead. They lost nine yards. 
·"You think about things like that," said Slager. "You think 'what if. . -~·. But if you let it bother you you get tight. The dropped passes didn't bother me because I knew I could depend on those guys next time. But I do 
think we got a little more con­servative after that." 

The Irish did manage to drive down to the Purude 12 yard line in the first quarter on the running of Browner and AI Hunter and a 24 
yard completion to Hunter· But they could not get in the end zone and settled for a 29 yard Dave Reeve field goal with 7:37 gone in the game.
·Luckily the offense didn't have to 

be explosive because the defense was spectacular. Ross Browner led the Irish, notching up 11 tackles, sometimes 10 or 15 yards downfield. Steve Niehaus and 
Bradley had eight. They gave a little but held when they had to, and came up with the breaks that bailed the offense out. "Thanks to our defense we were
able to make some mistakes on offense," said halfback AI Hunter· 
"They can cover up for us." That just about told the story of the game.
Slager was 4of 12 for the day for 53 yards. Jim Browner was the 
73

game's leading rusher with yards. Hunter added 57, while
Mark McLane and Jerome 
Heavens had 42 each. Nagel was 12 of 20 for Purdue, gaining 130 yards in the air. But the Boilermakers ground game totaled only 66 yards in 35 carries. 
"The boys certainly played their hearts out," said Purdue caoch Alex Agase, "but Notre Dame deserved the win. They had it all today, a powerful offense and 
defense. 

The Irish suffered only one in­jury, a sprained ankle by Randy Harrison in the first quarter. Tim 
Simon replaced him at free safety, full week to prepare. but Harrison is expected to be "This has been a tough week," ready next Saturday when ND Devine said. "I'm so anxious to hosts Northwestern. get home I can taste it." After playing two games in six After winning his first two days, Devine and his brui~ed games as Notre Dame coach on the players are glad to be headmg road, the taste will be a little bit home, and even ilappier to have a sweeter.

For the second week in a row, the Irish offense failed to get on track in the first half. Last week against Boston College the score was 3-3 at the end of the first 30 minutes of play, and Saturday it was 3-o in favor of Notre Dame. Both weeks, the defensive performance allowed for the offense to make mistakes and get away with them. 
Against Boston College a week ago, the Irish ground attack led by Jim Browner, picked up 131 yards in the first half. But against the Boiler­makers, the offense could muster just 112 yards, 35 coming in the air. With statistics like that, the likely culprit to look to could be the quar­terback, Rick Slager. But that isn't the case this week. Slager completed 2 of 7 attempts; however, two good passes were dropped by usually steady receivers, Dan Kelleher and Ted Burgmeier. 
After the game, in the spacious confines of the visiting team locker room at Ross-Ade Stadiu, various people offered different explanations of the first half blues. Irish coach Dan Devine pointed out that there is a lot of improvement to be made, "but now it is merely a matter of discipline and playing hard until we do well together." 
Mistakes, this week and last seem to be plaguing the offense. Against Boston College in the first half Mark McLane's 41 yard run set up a fine scoring opportunity of first and goal on the Eagle nine. But Slager was thrown for a six-yard loss trying to pass, and a delay of game penalty put the Irish at the 16 with goal to go after a three yard screen pass. At this point, the offense had to settle for a field goal. 
At Purdue, the first half mistakes featured dropped passes and a line screw up which netted Slager a 9-yard loss. Slager explained the play as a "mixup on the count. It was supposed to go on two, but the ball came back early, and half of the line didn't realize the ball was snapped. I was waiting for a whistle on the play, and one didn't come, and I learned a 
lesson on that play to just fall down and cover up the ball if something like 
that happens." The personable quarterback then expounded on the team's first half problems. "I think our slow start in the half was due to the youth of the team, plus some bad breaks. We were just inches away, I know it, just inches away from breaking the game open. Now we are going to start 
coming together." He also gave credit to the defense who stopped Boston College for 130 yards in the first half last week and gave Purdue just 111 yards. "The defense and the super job they have been doing gives us a chance to grow up. It takes some time for an offense to come around, but I can feel it 
. now_, AI Hunter echoed those sentiments. "Our first half problems seem to come from our inexperience. We're young and making too many mental mistakes, but it's still early." The offense seemed to close itself up, throwing its two completed passes early in the half, and then relying almost exclusively on the ground game. Hunter explained that "the height on the defensive line made it difficult to pass over, so we tried to establish our running game. But again, we were making too many mistakes and that's what cost us." 
The season, however, is just two games old and the team is young. Next week against Northwestern will be a good chance to evaluate the offense. It will have a full week to prepare for the Wildcats, and as Slager noted "some of the people were still stiff from the Boston College game and now we will have a week to get ready." 
After Northwestern, the season does get tougher, with Michigan State and Southern Cal coming to Notre Dame in the month of October. But for the moment, Dan Devine's squad will concern itself with Northwestern. Asked about the Wildcats, Sl~ger's mouth turned into a big grin, "that's right, no~ we get a chance to play at home, in front of our crowd." 
The first half blues -I think we've seen the last of them. The team has gone through two tough games in five days, both coming on the road. :Now it's time to join the mania of the Notre Dame crowd and watch the offense start to e:ell.

a 10-o lead. 
The play set a Notre Dame record for an interception return for a touchdown, surpassing Jack Elder's 96 yarder in 1929. And it quite obviously turned the game around. 
"We needed a big play," said Notre Dame coach Dan Devine. "We hadn't had one, and I'd have to say it was a good time to get one." 
"I was thinking he was going all 
the way," he continued, "and of 
course the first thing I looked for 
were flags. After being in the 
business this long it's the first 
thing I look for." 
"One play, just one play," said Purdue coach Alex Agase. "That did us in." 
Bradley himself admitted he didn't expect the play _but that he saw it develop. 

"I saw the halfback turn and I knew what it was going to be,'' he explained. "I was supposed to guard the tight end, but he must have blocked. I was really sur­prised by the play, but it was a badly thrown pass and once I got it I was just thinking goal line." 
Ironically, it was Bradley who was beaten fairly consistently during the first three quarters, usually on short sideline patterns, which Luther admits he is still learning to cover. But his dramatic runback proved to be just the beginning of what was to be a spectacular fourth quarter. 

When the Boilermakers regained possession after Bradley's return, the sophomore cornerback in­tercepted another Nagel pass at the Purdue 23 on the first play from scrimmage. This time he returned it only two yards, but the Irish offense took it the rest of the way. Staying on the ground, ND used 7 plays with AI Hunter taking it in from the two. Dave Reeve's extra
