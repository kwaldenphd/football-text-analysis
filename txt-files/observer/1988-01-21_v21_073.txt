Become a Couch Potato and live to a ripe old age 
"Top doc says exercise may be bad for your health. Take it easy --and live longer!" 
Never has there been more reason to be lazy. 
Newsweek has declared fitness "out" and laziness "in." Stuffed Couch Potatoes are on the market. VCRs are cheaper and TV dinners are better

''A leading researcher says that exercise may not help you live longer --in fact it may hasten your death," the Jan. 19 issue of Weekly World News reports. 
"Dr. Roger McCarter of the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio theorizes that humans are equipped to burn just so many calories in a lifetime. He says when that number of calories is burned the person dies. 
"The idea is that since exercise burns up calories it may actually speed up the aging process --depenoing upon the person.

Trubac said she recom­mends blood drives on high school and college campuses because of the reluctancy of students to go to blood banks and give. 
"Hopefully, if they have a good experience they'll give on their own later," she said. 
Fear of Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) prevents many people from donating, Gehl said. Trubac stressed that a person cannot contract AIDS from donating blood. 
She said the blood bank tech­nicians who staff the drives use disposable needles and give each donor candidate a blood test before he may donate. 
The blood test encompasses eight areas including hepatitis, 
Gehl said students often feel more relaxed about giving blood when they are sur­rounded by their friends, who may have already experienced donating. 
Gehl said she used the per­sonal "one on one" approach when recruiting students for the drive. "I talked to people in my dorm and classes and I asked them to bring their friends." Gehl said she as­sured the potential donors that "there's really nothing to be lost by giving blood." She said that she herself has been a donor since high school. 
Many of the donors were donating for the first time, she said. "First-timer" Veronica Stasa said she was already con­sidering donating when Gehl approached her. 
"It's beneficial for other people. Since I'm healthy I thought I could help other people. I know they can use the blood because it's always in demand," Stasa said. 
The freshman said she did have some apprehension at first. "I didn't know how I was going to react."

said. 
Donley said many women un­fairly compare their bodies to those of magazine models. Be­cause women are more evaluated by their appearance than men, this puts excessive pressure on women to be thin, she said. 
"The most important part of appearance is weight for wo­men in college," Donley said. 
Jokes about Notre Dame and Saint Mary's women's weight in the dining hall, Observer classified ads and the Keenan Revue put extra pressure on female students to be thin, she said. 
At Notre Dame's Psycholog­ical Services, Donley said she uses relaxation strategies and assertiveness training tech­niques to stop the starving and hinging behaviors. 
Although Miller's HOPE pro­gram does not work in conjunc­tion with Notre Dame Psycho­logical Services, Miller said, HOPE treats five or six Notre Dame or Saint Mary's students a year. 
Although most patients are treated on an out-patient basis, the HOPE program also offers a three-week in-patient treat­ment. This year, Miller said, anorexic students treated in the hospital are being let out to attend classes. 
After leaving the hospital, patients remain in support groups so they won't revert to their old ways, he said. 
Recovery depends on how long the patient has had the eating disorder and how much she wants to recover, Donley said. "People do recover but it is a long process and different for each person," she added. 

form would frighten her. 
I'd say, 'I can stop when I want,' " she said, "but it's like a drug or alcohol. Sometimes you can't stop." 
In order to hide her anorexia, Annie began lying to her friends and relatives. "You feel you have to keep it all a se­cret," she said, "but nobody is fooled." 
Her roommate finally told the dorm's rectress about Annie, who denied everything. 
Annie saw a staff psychia­trist at the University Counsel­ing Service, but she lied to him. Recognizing her dishonesty, he explained that he couldn't give Annie help until she wanted it. 
When Annie went home for vacation, her parents checked her into the hospital where she was fed intravenously. The doctors told her she couldn't return to Notre Dame unless she gained weight. 
"It was my father who turned me around," Annie said. "He began crying and asked, 'What have I done?' He told me I was hurting more people than just myself." 
Annie returned to Notre Dame where she received counseling from the University Counseling Services. "The counseling was one of the best things that ever happened to me. I learned that you shouldn't care how much you weigh; you should just feel good about yourself." 
"I wish guys would have more of an idea about all this when they make jokes about 'fat Notre Dame girls,' " said Annie. "I'm not saying they are the main cause of (eating dis­orders), but those jokes do have an effect." 
Annie is a senior now, and she admits to feeling pressured about job interviews and plan­ning for the future. At one point this semester Annie lost 15 pounds. "You know (anorexia) can come back. But the better I feel about myself, the less I feel it will return," she said. 
Jennifer (not her real name) also recognizes that her bulimia was triggered by a va­riety of pressures. Her parents were going through a divorce, and her father was an al­coholic. Like Annie, Jennifer describes herself as an overac­hiever and a perfectionist. 
"I felt I had to do extra, extra good," she said. "Perfec­tionists don't get down to what's really wrong. 
Jennifer first showed signs of bulimia when she was 13. Her weight dropped 15-20 pounds below normal. She developed poor circulation, and her peri­ods became irregular. 
Like Annie, Jennifer avoided her friends and relatives. "My sister finally confronted me," she said, "but you want to deny (the problem), because you feel ashamed of it.'' 
Jennifer finally confided in a neighbor when she was 18. "She was very helpful and under­standing," Jennifer said. 
She advises anyone with eating disorders to get help im­mediately. "It's worth it to be healthy. Bulimia is a problem and you have to solve it." 
"If it gets bad enough, you can die from it," said Annie. "And you're too young to worry about things that can kill you." 
vigorous exercise --"anything to drastically reduce weight." 
Many bulimics, who usually develop the disorder between the ages of 15 and 18, "fit the stereotypical image of the col­lege cheerleader," Donley said. 
They are outgoing and fairly attractive, she added. 
Obsessed with their weight, how they look, and how much they eat, many bulimics con­stantly ask their friends whe­ther they look fat, Donley said. 
Bulimia has the potential to affect every major organ in the body, she said. It could affect

many anorexics and bulimics diet excessively to cope with academic pressures, peer pre­ssures or feelings of inada­quacy, Donley said. 
Often, a stressful situation, such as the break-up of a rela­tionship, or parents' divorce, will push a diet over the edge into bulimia, said Donley.

Everyone benefits from Big Brothers 
The most important gift you can give to anyone is yotrself. 
We students all need the Notre Dame Alumni. Among other things, they donate money to build our classrooms, and they write job recommendations when we graduate. However, the per­son who will come to mind to us 25 years later when the words "Notre Dame" are mentioned is that special adminis­trator, rector, teacher, or friend who took time out to get to know us. 
Mark Laughlin 
guest column 
I came to Notre Dame with the inten­tion of joining a service organization but was overwhelmed at the numerous choices available. Freshman year at Activities Night, it seemed that at every table there was yet another acronym waiting to sign me up and send me a newsletter. Later that year, I made a decision to join one of those organizations and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I've made here. That organization was Big Brot­hersBig Sisters <BOOS). 
Big BrothersBig Sisters is an organi­zation which matches an adult, college age or older, with a child usually age 6 to 10. Most of the "Iittles" are from economically disadvantaged and bro­ken homes. Their environment, values and goals are many times quite differ­ent from those of most Notre Dame stu­dents. Once a big and little are matched, they spend time together at least once a week in a variety of activ­ities which include roller skating, putt­putt golfing, visiting a museum, or doing something on campus. Approxi­mately once a month the organization sponsors an activity, but what you do with your little is entirely up to you. 
Let me give you a few reasons why I have stayed with BOOS and also a little about my own match. 
First, BBBS offers the opportunity for a special one-on-one relationship. Unlike many other service groups on campus, BBBS offers a unique oppor­tunity to develop an important relation­ship with one person, a relationship which could not be established, much less maintained, by monetary dona­tions, frequent letters, or even oc­casional visits. This is especially meaningful to the Iittles, many of whom have never had an adult take time out for them and only them. Another bonus: after spending my entire week with students age 18 to 20, it was 
Doonesbury 
refreshing to talk to someone with a fresh perspective. 
Second, BOOS has flexible meeting times. Practically speaking, this is one of the best aspects of the program. With work, basketball games, other campus groups, law school applications, social life, and an occasional study session vying for my time, it is very convenient to schedule activities with my little bro­ther around other commitments. It would be difficult for me to make it to any group's regularly scheduled weekly meetings, but it becomes much easier when you can meet on a Satur­day afternoon, a Monday evening, or any other time during the week accor­ding to your own schedule. 
Third, and the most satisfying aspect of BOOS is the feeling that you have made a difference in someone's life. In November of 1985, I was matched with Glen, a 10-year-old fifth grader. Glen's family was poor, his grades were poorer, and his activities and experi­ences had been, up to that point, lim­ited. I was very nervous as the caseworker and I drove to Glen's house for the first time. Our first couple of meetings were tough, and conversation was minimal. But as we did more things and spent more time together, I be­came quite at ease poking fun at his big belly and he at my propensity for getting Notre Dame parking tickets. Our activities together have included a roadtrip to my home in Omaha over Easter break, a day trip to Chicago, a costly trip to the video arcade, as well as many weeks of just hanging out at my dorm or throwing the football on the quad. I used to want to have some planned activity each week, but now I believe it's not what you do when you get together, but just the fact that you get together that's important. 
Last year, Glen failed sixth grade. His failing, though, was not due to a lack of intelligence but to a lack of ef­fort, and I told him so. Together, we decided that he needed to spend more time on his homework, and, also to­gether, we studied about once a week in the Notre Dame library last semes­ter. The result: Glen's lowest grade on his last progress report was an 80 and most were around 90. Now, I'm not trying to say that I've made an Einstein out of a dropout -most of the credit for his turnaround goes to Glen. I'm saying that after investing so much time in him, both of us have grown in many ways from our relationship. 
Big BrotherS'Big Sisters is not for everyone, though. While two hours a week doesn't sound like a lot of time,

Lunch fast: a worthy sacrifice 
Dear Editor: 
"No way, I need my lunch." I wish I had a dollar for every time I heard that type of response during the past three years when I've been signing people up for the Wednesday Lunch Fast. The fast is a program in which students agree to give up their dining hall lunch on Wednesday. The University Food Ser­vice then donates one dollar for every lunch that is skipped. It's sad that people who have always had more than enough to eat can really think that mis­sing one turkey sandwich and some jello is such a big deal. "Miss lunch?" people say, "I'll get hungry." Maybe they will. And maybe it's time for those of us who have always enjoyed, not only enough food, but thousands of the other good things in life, to find out what it's like to go hungry for a few hours. Maybe it will help us to appreciate our in­numerable blessings. 
The ugly problem called hunger seems very far removed from us, and as students, we don't have time to worry about it. But the fast doesn't ask for our time; it only asks that we give a little of ourselves -always knowing that at 5 p.m. there will be plenty of spaghetti in the dining hall to fill up on again. This knowledge that food will be available in a few hours is a luxury that millions of people don't have. These are the type of less fortunate people who benefit from fasters' generosity. The money collected from the fast at the end of the semester goes toward gras­sroots development agencies in India,

Bangladesh, Chile and Africa that are helping people to feed themselves and to better their existences. 
The question is always asked, "Why does the dining hall donate only one dol­lar per lunch when they'd charge me four dollars if I forgot my ID?" Here are the answers. By charging a lot, the University is trying to discourage "for­gotten IDs" and trying to stop people without meal plans from sneaking into the dining hall. Moreover, the food it­self costs the dining hall about a dollar per lunch. The four dollar charge goes toward overhead, like employees' wages and upkeep. Mr. Hickey is not making any money on this deal; in­stead, the Food Service is going through extra bookwork to help a very good cause. So please don't use this as an excuse for not helping out. 
On Jan. 27, the Wednesday Lunch Fast will begin. It will last throughout the semester until finals week. I would like to ask those of you who have been faithful fasters in the past to continue your generosity this semester. And to those of you who've never fasted, I'd like to ask you to try it. Skip one lunch, and see if you can keep going. It's not necessarily going to be easy, but it's a sacrifice well worth making. If you're willing to give of yourself, please sign up at the dining halls today or call 283­2461 and leave your name and ID num­

St. Ed's Players to perform 'The Odd Couple' 
than just plain entertainment. slapstick. no-art." Furthermore, he added, "We don't want the Players to stagnate, get in a rut early on, or have the reputation for doing the same type of 
show." 
The play is concerned with a subject some students are facing now and which most of us will face in the future. The relationship of these two male roommates is symbolic of a marital relationship. We see what marriage will entail through their eyes of Ungar and Madison. 
This full-scale production is a big endeavor for a student-run organization like the Players. Sophomore Mark Wiltberger, a cast member, commented, "It's amazing students got it all to­gether, and it's coming off so well. We are doing it all--the acting, the publicity, the set, everything--and are still having a good time." 
Most of the group are resi­
dents of St. Edward's Hall. 
There are two female actors, 
however, and many of the 
"ever-necessary" crew members 
are also women. Another cast 
member, Freshman Brad Perry, 
attends Holy Cross Junior Col­
lege. 
For Perry, as well as for 
Lowell Francis, a freshman 
from St. Edward's Hall. the play 
has been an "integrating expe­
rience." Francis said, "It has 
helped me feel more a part of 
the dorm. The guys ask me 
how the play is going, and it 
really helps to get to know 
people." 
The Players exists for two groups of people according to 
DiFranco. First, it is for those 
involved in the show. "It's a 
chance to get together and to 
get to know each other," he 
said. Some of the cast mem­
bers affirmed the accomplish­
ment of this goal: "We enjoy 
doing it. We know we don't 
have to be here, and we know 
we are doing something that 
will be decent." 
Secondly, the Players exists for the community. The group wants to put on shows people will enjoy. DiFranco and the Players are confident that they will accomplish this once again next weekend. Although the Keenan Revue is scheduled for the same weekend, there doesn't seem to be a problem for either group. 
Regarding the scheduling conflict, Difranco said, "We booked Washington Hall almost a year ago and did not find out it was the same weekend as the Revue until it was too late to change. The play is charging ahead and despite the large draw of the Revue, we felt it is going to do very well. The cast, crew, and I feel very confident that our production this year is going to be first rate in every respect." 
The Keenan Revue crew has collaborated with the St. Ed's Players and has agreed to have ticket sales for "The Odd Couple" right alongside their own ticket distribution tomor­row at the ACC. (Tickets will also be sold for $2 in the dining halls this weekend--Jan. 22 and 23--or at the door next weekend.)

MARY BERGER accent writer hether thrown together by chancfW or by choice, when two people live together, the ensuing scenario can be har­monious or disastrous. For Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, best friends but not the best of friends in Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple," life together was odd. 
The St. Edward's Hall Players, a completely student-run or-dent director Duane DiFranco. During his ten years as rector ('75-'86), Pedi directed a play during all but two seasons. 
After Pedi left St. Edward's Hall, the hall president and now a cast member of "The Odd Couple," Andy Barlow, decided to keep the tradition of the play by forming the Players with DiFranco at the healm. According to DiFranco, "Since Andy's initial conception, the idea has grown and the plays more artistic." "The Odd Couple," in Difranco's opinion is "tried and true." He said. "It's not a play that will leave the audience rolling in the aisles like last year's show did, but it makes you warm inside. You see the characters up there and one in the eight you'll really identify with. Seeing what they do, you'll have to laugh at yourself on stage." 
At the beginning of last se­mester, the Players began 

ganization, will be performing this "play about people" next weekend in Washington Hall. 
The Players are now in their second year of existence, and "The Odd Couple" is their second big production. The inspiration for the group can be traced to the influence of a former rector, Father Mario Pedi. Pedi, who trained in New York under Lee Strasberg, was "quite Into theater" according to Players' president and resi­we are putting on are even big­ger productions than Mario's were." 
Last year's production of "Love, Sex. and the IRS" was quite a success. Despite the fact that the group put on the production with no money to start with, they had over one hundred pleased people in at­tendance every night. 
This year the Players wanted to do something "more chal­lenging, more traditional. and searching through catalogs at plays for the right spring pro­duction. Difranco read at least one hundred blurbs of different plays, concentrating on com­edies. Then the club officers read ten or fifteen sel.ected ones, narrowed the options to five, discussed them, and decided upon "The Odd Couple." 
According to Difranco, the comedy was chosen because it is, unlike a lot of others, "more

serious side of Yuppyhood 
JOE BUCOLO accent writer 

I 
t's something old, someth­ing new, and something borrowed. It's "thirtysometh­ing," ABC's new dramedy about Yuppies. They're everywhere else so why not on television, too? Actually "thirtysomething" is one of the season's most intelligent and innovative shows. 
"thirtysomething" airs on ABC Tuesdays at 10 p.m. Dealing primarily with the lives of Yuppies, the show features two main characters, Michael (Ken Olin) and Hope (Mel Har­ris) who recently welcomed a baby into their lives. Michael. a once-aspiring writer, owns an advertising agency with his friend Elliot (Timothy Busfield). 
Hope, on the other hand, is not as lucky and has to put her publishing career on "hold" to take care of the baby. The show features Michael and Hope's friends as well. Ellyn (Polly Draper) is Hope's best friend and has everything but a man, the one thing she wants most. Michael's photographer cousin Melissa (Melanie Mayron) is always around to complain about her love life: "How am I ever going to have a baby? I'm dating babies." Michael's friend and best man Gary (Peter Horton) seems to maintain a level of sanity among the group. 
So what's "old" about "thir­tysomething?" As one would guess, these characters get into some sticky, but somewhat ordinary situations. Michael whines that he won't be able to create an ad portfolio for his client by the deadline. Hope wonders if her four years at Princeton were wasted since she has to be home with the baby. Ellyn feels as if Hope's baby is infringing upon their friendship. And Michael stares at his barren, ugly dining room and wonders if he will ever have the cash to redecorate. Sound realistic? It is. In fact, some argue that the plots are "borrowed" directly from real life. But people don't want to sit down at night only to "relive" their whole day on tele­vision. 
Enter the "new." This show presents the situations in a new and exciting way. One episode, for example, features outstanding dream sequences in which Michael speaks to his deceased grandfather for help and advice. In another episode, little furry creatures such as "anxiety'' haunt Michael at his office. Hope's anecdotes are quite witty also. She once tells her daughter how the Romans persecuted Daddy's ancestors until Mommy's ancestors 
rescued them. When Michael is running about looking for his argyle socks, Hope tells how 
she set fire to them on an in­
verted cross and "danced around them naked until they lost all their power." 
Of course there's also those unmistakable Yuppie trademarks that permeate every aspect of the show: the Volvos, the argyle socks, the suspenders, and the terminol­ogy. Edward Zwick and Mar­shall Herskovitz, the show's creators, leave no bottle of Per­rier unturned while depicting this lively breed of Americans. The character's play squash, spend "quality time" with their children, and plan to send the kids to Harvard. What, Prince­ton isn't good enough? 
The show's actors are out­standing. Olin portrays his character perfectly, right down to the whining in his voice when he declares, "I am NOT a Yuppie." Ya, right. Harris plays the concerned, somewhat flir­tatious wife with an efferves­cence of which Dom Perignon would be proud. Finally, Hor­ton's performance as Gary, the only character who comes somewhat close to being care­free, is flawless. 

These marvelous qualities 
combined with soap opera pacing and serious plotlines make "thirtysomething" a forerunner in a recent epidemic of TV dramatic comedies. A recent Grammy nomination is 
the first of a sure list of awards for the show. With "Moonlight­ing" as its strong lead-in show, "thirtysomething" is sure to be around for years to come. Who knows? It may even outlive the 
Yuppies themselves.

Flores leaves Raiders post 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES Tom Flores, saying he was worn out after nine years in the pressure cooker, retired as coach of the Los Angeles Raiders Wednes­day. 
"I've won. I think it's time to smell the roses. It's time for me to step aside," Flores said. "I have no regrets. I've expe­rienced just about everything you can." 
Flores, 50, guided the Raiders to a 5-10 record in 1987, their worst showing in 25 years. 
Overall, his teams had a 83-53 regular-season record. They won three AFC west champion­ships in his nine years as head coach. In the postseason, his teams were 8-3. 
But the Raiders, who managed the only two Super Bowl wins by AFC teams in the 1980s, lost 14 of their last 19 games. They were 8-4 in 1986 before losing their last four games to fall out of playoff con­tention. 

"I'm not burned out, I'm just tired,'' Flores said at a packed news conference. "It's time to go on to another challenge. Ob­viously the nine years of the pressure cooker have worn me out a little bit, so I'm going to take a little rest. 
Team owner AI Davis said it was Flores' decision to step down and indicated it would be a while before he would name a replacement, although it has been speculated that he might hire a black. 
"No one asked Tom Flores to retire," Davis said. "This is what he wanted to do. Tom will continue to serve the Raiders as an advisor, special projects, and will always be a part of our organization. 
"I would hope that the Raiders would have a new head coach by the league meetings in March. I haven't thought about it and I won't discuss it. The last time it took about a month. It's a very big, a very tough decision." 
Davis was asked about the possibility of hiring a black coach. 
"I would say that with all our great records, one characteris­tic of the Raiders is that race, color, creed, and even sex has never interfered," he replied. "I'm going to choose the best person who can lead the Raiders.'' 
If Davis does hire a black, he would be the first of his race to be a head coach in the modern­day NFL. 
Among those rumored as possible successors to Flores are San Francisco assistant Dennis Green, Raiders assis­tants Charlie Sumner, Art Shell and Willie Brown, and Pit­tsburgh assistant Tony Dungy. Only Sumner is white. 

Evert tops Navratilova in Open 
Associated Press 

MELBOURNE, Australia ­Chris Evert downed long-time rival Martina Navratilova and top-seeded Steffi Graf routed fellow West German Claudia Kohde-Kilsch Thursday to ad­vance to the women's finals of the $1.9 million Australian Open. 
Graf lost the first two games at love but rallied to beat Kohde-Kilsch, the eighth seed, 6-2, 6-3, in 45 minutes. 
Evert, playing from the baseline with pinpoint ac­curacy, downed Navratilova 6­2, 7-5 to earn her first berth in a Grand Slam final since the 1986 French Open. 

It will be Evert's sixth ap­pearance in the Australian Open final. She has won twice, in 1982 and 1984. 
Graf's victory earned her the fourth Grand Slam final berth of her career. She is 4-6lifetime against Evert, but has won their last four meetings. 
Graf's only previous Grand Slam victory came in last year's French Open. She lost to Navratilova in the U:S. open and Wimbledon finals her only losses of 1987. 
Graf's victory extended her winning streak to 20 matches. Her last loss was to Nav­ratilova in the U.S. open final. 
Graf extended her record against Kohde-Kilsch to 5-2. 
Mter losing the first two games, Graf found her stroke and was able to concentrate on exploiting Kohde-Kilsch's lack of mobility and poor volleying while scoring with a succession of deadly-accurate punched forehands.

Associated Press 

LEXINGTON, Ky.-Vernon Maxwell scored 19 points and Dwayne Schintzius added 18 as Florida, despite going score­less over the final 3 : 24, defeated No. 4 Kentucky 58-56 in Southeastern Conference basketball Wednesday night. 
Florida used a 2-1-2 zone that allowed Kentucky to make only 16 of 57 shots for 28.1 percent. 
Schintzius' wide-open slam dunk with 3: 24 to go gave Florida a 58-51 lead before Ken­tucky's futile rally. 
Florida ran its record to 13-4 overall and 4-1 in the confer­ence while Kentucky, losing for the second time in Rupp Arena this season, fell to 12-2 and 5-2. 
Winston Bennett topped Ken­tucky with 19 points and Rex Chapman added 14.

Notre Dame led by as many as 14 points in the first half, as Irish guard Karen Robinson scored 12 of her 16 total points. The Blue Demons closed the gap to 43­40 at halftime. 
The Irish had a 66-62 lead with six and a half minutes to play when Veronica Ross drove, scored and drew a foul from Notre Dame cen­ter Sandy Botham. Ross con­verted the three-point play, Botham fouled out and the Demons pulled to within one. 
Robinson answered with a score to give the Irish a 68-65 lead, but DePaul followed with seven consecutive points and never trailed again. 
Diana Vines led DePaul with 27 points and 12 rebounds. Mary Gavin had 10 assists for Notre Dame, and Botham had 14 points with Irish forward Diondra Toney adding 10 more.
