Soviets to free all political prisoners, says Kohl 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW--The Soviet Union will release all people regarded in the West as political prisoners by the end of the year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said Wednes­day after talks with President Mikhail Gorbachev. 
Such a dramatic move would be one of the boldest signs yet from Gorbachev that he seeks a clear break with past Krem­lin human rights practices that have included imprisonment of dissenters from Communist Party policy. 
However, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov refused to confirm or deny that a release of poli­tical prisoners is imminent. 
He told reporters there are about two dozen such prisoners. Estimates from human rights groups abroad vary from 150 to more than 500. 
Gerasimov said the fate of the prisoners was not on the agenda of the Soviet-West Ger­man negotiations that brought Kohl to Moscow. 
Kohl's announcement was welcomed by Soviet human rights activist Andrei Sak­harov, the Reagan administra­tion and Amnesty Interna­tional. 
"Certainly we await the release of all of them (prisoners) and their rehabilitation,'' said Sakharov, the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize laureate. 
Arts and Letters enrollment continues increasing trend 
By MICHAEL WELLS Staff Reporter 
The recently released Registrar's enrollment report shows a continued increase in the number of students in the College of Arts and Letters, and in the department of govern­ment in particular, leaving un­derstaffed administrators won­dering if the trend will continue. 
The report indicates that Arts and Letters is the most popular college among Notre Dame students, with an enroll­ment of 2,585, and shows the College of Business as coming in second with 1,493 students. The Colleges of Engineering and Science come in as third and fourth, respectively. 
The high number of students declaring Arts and Letters majors marks an upswing which has taken place over the last ten years, according to Robert Waddick, assistant dean of the College of Arts and Letters. "What has happened is that the size of this college has increased by almost a thousand," Waddick said. "We're a thousand students over what we were, without an increase iri faculty."

Hall trespasser pleads guilty 
By REGIS COCCIA Senior Staff Reporter 
A South Bend man pleaded guilty Tuesday to a charge of Criminal Trespass committed last Jan. 21 in Cavanaugh Hall, said Phil Johnson, assistant director of Security. 
James Walker, 19, pleaded guilty before the St. Joseph County Misdemeanors Court and was given a $125 fine. A 30-day jail sentence was suspended, Johnson said. 
A juvenile who was arrested with Walker in the Jan. 21 inci­dent was also charged, he said. The juvenile, whose name was not released, pleaded guilty to three counts: Trespass, a Class A Misdemeanor; Theft, a Class D Felony; Minor Consumption of Alcohol, a Misdemeanor, Johnson said. 
The juvenile had served two days in jail and was sentenced

In the past three days, Kohl held 10 hours of talks with Gor­bachev and also met with other top Kremlin officials. 
At a news conference called to sum up his visit, Kohl said: "The Soviets confirmed that they will release before the end of the year all political prisoners as we understand it in the West." 
Kohl would not say whether the promise came from Gor­bachev, only that it was made during the talks.

The presidential debates be­tween George Bush and Mi­chael Dukakis may no longer be on television, but they are still going on at Notre Dame. 
Wednesday night a mock debate was held in Grace Hall's pit between representatives of campus student campaigns for 
i Bush and Dukakis. The forum 
/1 was composed of two represen­tatives for each candidate and approximately 20 mock reporters. 
The debate was organized by junior Nancy Snyder, who said she thought it would provide a perfect opportunity for the stu­dents to ask questions that were not brought up in the real debate. She set up the event

Asked how many people may be freed, Kohl's foreign mini­ster, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, said: "We are not in a position to give final figures." 
Neither Kohl nor Genscher identified prisoners who might be released. It was not clear how many Soviets classified in the West as political prisoners might be freed, since some have been sentenced on cri­minal charges, including espionage.

INSIDE COLUMN 




Notre Dame elections could rival national ones 
Democracy in action. It's wonderful. We get to see candidates aspiring for higher office wal­low in controversy for months. If we want a real mock election, we should have one for the office of the president of the University of Notre Dame. 
Move over Monk, Beauchamp wants a rematch. Only this time we should have a true democratic election. Not only the board of trus­tees, but also the faculty, staff and students should get a vote. It should be run just like the present presidential election with months of campaigning. The candidates could hold debates to have their words scrutinized by campus political experts, and could have cer­tain local campus newspapers misconstrue and misquote their ideas, just like the real thing. 
Our candidates could form political parties and affiliations. Of course, the two dominating organizations would probably be the Demo­cratic Administration for a Dry Campus and the Republican Party Against Student Rights. 
Unfortunately, all sort of cult factions may sprout up that could spoil the election, such as the Students For an Open Administration. This radical cult wishes for the administration to actually explain its actions, and open a dialogue with the students. These far left liberals just do not understand the American democratic process. Once our leader is elected, he no longer needs to explain his actions to his constituency. 
Monk, as the incumbent, would give weekly radio addresses on WVFI to the student body and deny allegations that Notre Dame is invest­ing in South African companies that are sup­porting apartheid. Say it ain't so, Monk. 
A popular issue on the campaign trail would undoubtedly be the student furlough program. Under this program, the vice-president of stu­dent affairs was allowed to give weekend passes to felons such as alcohol policy abusers, quiet hours offenders and campus parking violators. 
In an attempt to capture the endorsement of the Notre Dame Police and Security, candidate Father Tyson could oppose the release of these thugs in a public display of his tough guy stance 
on crime. 

The problem with this election is that it will 
be full of ugly mudslinging. The debates are 
bound to be dominated by quips like, "I knew 
Father Hesburgh, I worked with Father Hes­
burgh, Father Hesburgh was a friend of mine, 
and let me tell you, you're no Father Hes­
burgh." 

Issues such as the growing University endow­
ment are likely to be hot items. Should tuition 
be raised? Some candidates will say emphati­
cally, "I will not raise your tuition!" others 


UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS? CLINSIOeR THE l'oS:SIBIL.IiiE.S  
candidates will not rule out the possibility, but claim the endowment problem may be solved by getting previously thought uncollectable stu­dent fees, or by raising student football ticket prices, again. 
Mudslinging issue number two should be campaign contibutions. Should student organi­zations be allowed to contribute to candidates that favor their positions, or only students act­ing as individuals? 
The incumbent party surely will sidestep hotspots like the football ticket scandal, while emphasizing their accomplishments that have caused Notre Dame to break into the top 20 universities in a recent poll. 
The most heated issue that the candidates will handle with extreme care is the proposed Food-Choice amendment. Currently, the "Food-Choice" campaign has been gaining sup­port for their on-campus student alternative meal plan. Leader of the "Pro-Leftovers" cam­paign, Mr. Hickey, claims that students are not entitled to those rights of choice until they move across the campus border. 
I am not sure who would win such a bloody election, but I do know that if a candidate wanted the endorsement of this publication he would have to support the freedom of the press to print alcohol advertisements.

NO law prof named Asst. Attorney General 
By JEFF SWANSON News Staff Douglas Kmiec, a Notre Dame Professor of Law, was unanimously confirmed by the 
U.S. Senate on October 14 as Assistant Attorney General. 
Nominated by President Reagan, Kmiec has worked for the Office of Legal Counsel and was a White House Fellow. A member of the Notre Dame faculty since 1980, Kmiec spe­cializes in property law and land use planning. 
Kmiec said that he sees his new position as "an important responsibility" which entails "the presentation of legal ad­vice to the President and Attor­ney General." He is currently on leave from Notre Dame and is scheduled to return in the fall of 1989. 

Kmiec is a former director of the Thomas White Center on Law and Government at Notre Dame and has taught at Val­parasio University and Indiana University. He is a graduate from the law school at the Uni­versity of Southern California.

Final Four, predicts Phelps 
By JOHN O'BRIEN News Staff 
Notre Dame Head Basket­ball Coach Digger Phelps predicted great results for Notre Dame basketball at the St. Edward's Hall Forum last night. 
"We will go to theFinal Four, whether it's this year or next year," said Phelps, citing the fact that his two main objec­tives for this year were at­tained: a good recruiting class and a good schedule. 
Phelps called this year's schedule "the best we've ever played" and is not afraid of the challenge it will be for the team. "By March, with time and patience, these guys will able to handle anything." 
Phelps called freshman Lap­honso Ellis "one of the premier 
players in the country," adding 
that Ellis and fellow freshmen 
Damon Sweet and Elmer Ben­
nett are "Final Four players." 
In addition to the tough schedule and the promising recruits, Phelps stressed the importance of student support and fan participation to a win­ning seas~. He emphasizedthe inspir g effect of crowd participati n and made a plea to the student body, "Get this place electrified and you'll get these kids to Seattle."

In addition, the lack of senior players means that all 12 players will return for the 1989­90 season. "They won't just be

Phelps' lecture included more than the standard season preview. An outspoken adv­ocate of integrity in intercol­legiate sports, he commented on a recent Sports Illustrated article regarding steroid use at 
the University of South Carolina. 
"I couldn't believe that still goes on in intercollegiate sports. That wouldn't happen here-we wouldn't tolerate it," he said.

Icebreakers finally free iced whales 
Associated Press 
BARROW, Alaska-Two whales trapped for nearly three weeks in the arctic ice pack were freed Wednesday by Soviet and American icebreakers, superpower saviors who hacked a path to the open sea. 
"The whales are loose and in the channel and headed out," said Lt. Mike Haller, a spokes­

man for the Alaska National , ~ Guard. "They looked good all afternoon. To look at them, you'd have thought they had their bags packed and were ready to head south." 
l 
"They're in the main lead, and I can't help but think they'll ~eep on truckin'. I don't know how much more we can do," said rescue coordinator 
Ron Morris of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad­ministration. 
The work to free the migrat­ing California gray whales progressed rapidly Tuesday when two Soviet ice-breaking vessels began smashing the ice that kept the pair imprisoned. A third trapped whale is ..,elieved to have died last week. 
Morris, who followed the whales by helicopter, landed a little after 4 p.m. (9 p.m. EDT) to report that the whales had moved from the final man­made breathing hole to the slushy path the Soviet icebreaker Vladimir Arseniev cut Tuesday night.

Walker and the juvenile were arrested last Jan. 21 in connec­tion with a robbery in Cavanaugh Hall. The two al­legedly stole $92 in cash from a pair of Cavanaugh residents.

didate, it made up in manners. Unlike the actual debates, both sides in the Grace event were polite to each other and an­swered rationally. 
The format was also much less restricted than the actual debates and resulted in more open dialogue between both sides. 
Each side was given time at the end to discuss topics it felt was left out. The Bush team used the opportunity to defend Quayle, while the Dukakis side countered by claiming Bentsen has a better record. 
After the debate ended, Lapsley thanked the several dozen students who attended and congratulated both teams for handling the event with professionalism. 
Future Hall Fellow events in­clude a discussion of what Notre Dame students are like and a lecture on the role of wo­men in the Catholic Church. 

In fact, the trend is relatively new for the University, Wad­dick said. "If you go back to 1978, we were dropping and the others were going up," he said, referring to the enrollment in the College of Arts and Letters. 
Within the college, govern­ment is the most popular major. Perry Arnold, chair­man of the department of gov­ernment and international studies, said he saw the popularity as "a long-term growth of the major". 
"This has always been a more popular major, although it does seem to be getting in­creasingly popular," said Ar­nold. "I wonder if government isn't seen by Notre Dame stu­dents as a more practical major," said Arnold, indica­ting that parental pressure and 
ea. 
(51<' SS) 
job concerns may influence students to choose more "hard­headed" majors. 
Monique Headly, a senior government major, said she chose the department mainly out of interest. "I've just al­ways been interested in politics, comparitively speak­ing, between Europe, South America, Africa. I like to know what's going on." As to the fu­ture, she says, "My career goal when I chose government ini­tially was law, but at this point it's constantly changing." 
Another senior in the depar­
tment, Dave Reider, also said I he has always been interested in politics, but is looking
towards a career. "People gen­erally think a government major isn't very practical, job-wise," Reider said. "Butlcan't think of a major that's better for someone looking for a job in foreign service or public ser­vice. It prepares them best." 
In terms of career possibili­ties for Arts and Letters majors on the whole, Waddick said many businesses these days are also looking for liberal arts graduates--especially in jobs

There is no easy solution to the dilemmas posed by poverty and ter­ribly unequal distribution and use of world resources. That seems to be a fact of life in our modern world. 
David Schlaver 
guest column 
One hundred thirty-five years ago the first Holy Cross fathers, brothers and sisters landed near Chittagong on the Bay of Bengal to assist in the Christian missions of the distant Indian province of East Bengal. In this past half-cen­tury that land has undergone major changes in government (from India to East Pakistan to Bangladesh) and ex­perienced great growth in population. But true progress on the human front has been hard to find. 
Bangladesh was born as a nation in December 1971. Even now, well into its adolescence, this small Wisconsin­sized country seems to have nothing to offer the world, except people. We only received fleeting reports about its fre­quent disasters, like the worst flooding in history last month which has left 30 million of its 110 million people home­less. Of those people, over 90 million are Muslims, 15 million are Hindus, and the rest Buddhists, various tribal religions, and a mere handful of Christians--about 270,000 covering many denominations. 
In the same half-century of political changes, the local church has taken shape and now flourishes. The number 
of Catholic Christians is still small: less that two-tenths of one percent. But the roots of Christianity are deep (400 years), the faith is firmly planted, and Holy Cross has been an integral part of the growth of that local church for 135 years. 
Father Sorin himself was asked to go to Bengal in 1852, merely ten years after founding the University of Notre Dame. He politely refused, saying that 

Bangladesh mission strives for progress 
there was enough missionary work to be done right here. Another took his place and the Holy Cross presence on the opposite side of the globe was as­sured. 
Education has been a priority from the first days in Bengal, pioneered by the sisters at the elementary level and the brothers at the secondary level. Five excellent high schools and two major technical schools are sponsored by the brothers and one by the sisters. In addition, the fathers administer Notre Dame College and the sisters Holy Cross College, both tops in their field. 
Holy Cross has also founded and maintained hospitals, dispensaries and medical programs and worked in areas of development and justice, technical training and basic literacy. These proj­ects have always benefited people of all religions. Generous support for them has come from friends of Holy Cross all over the North American con­tinent. 
Among the small Catholic population, Holy Cross religious have labored to foster local communities of religious, to build up the diocesan clergy, and to train church leaders in seminaries and catechetical centers. Holy Cross priests have also assisted the bishops of three dioceses in maintaining extensive parishes serving many Catholics. The only actual "conversion" work was

done among the tribal peoples who have become the "new" Christians during the last century. 
Scores of Holy Cross religious have spent their entire lives in service of the people of Bangladesh. They have been sent to bring the gospel to them, to teach and heal them, and to give them hope.

In December, two new Holy Cross vice-provinces will be launched. The Vice-Province of Priests will have over 50 professed members and the Vice­Province of Brothers over 40. In both groups the majority of members are now Bangladeshis. In addition, the Sisters of the Holy Cross have about 25 members of whom more than half are Bangladeshi women, and the Canadian Sisters number about ten. 
Sunday, Oct. 23, was "Mission Sun­day" around the world. At Notre Dame we celebrated this significant part of the history of Holy Cross which links us here at Notre Dame with a church and people in far away Bengal. We wel­comed Fr. Frank Quinlivan to Sacred Heart Church that weekend. He spent six years in Bangladesh (1979-85) and now serves as novice director for Holy Cross in Colorado. 
Holy Cross is proud of Fr. Frank's work in Bangladesh as pastor and fel­low traveler with a people struggling to improve their lot and deepen their faith. He learned their language and listened to their problems; he gave them his full attention and love and in the process found that they gave him much more in return. 
The work of one individual or even a whole community in such a radically different environment seems like a mere drop in the ocean. Yet, as Mother Theresa says so simply and directly: "If we don't do it, then the ocean would have one less drop." And that could be a worse tragedy for us than the misfor­tunes we see others suffering all over our world. 
Pray for our distant brothers and sisters and for those who serve in their midst. And help them materially if you can. We are linked to them forever in God's provident plan.

Viewpoint Grad students must assimilate at ND 
page 8 Thursday, October 27, 1988 
Most people are unaware that Notre Dame has not just one campus, but two campuses....The second camJ?US is made up of three dorms: Brownson Hall, St. Joseph's, and O'Hara-Grace. 
Victor J. Krebs 
metanoia 
Brownson Hall is right behind the Dome, in the very heart of the Notre Dame campus. O'Hara-Grace is just across the street from Knott and Siegfried. And St. Joseph is right next to St. Joseph's Lake, not any farther than Holy Cross or Carroll Hall are from some parts of the campus. These three dorms are graduate student dorms; yet the fact is, graduate dorms are not considered on-campus. 

Nobody seems to know where these dorms are. Campus announcements never get there. When student campus mailings are sent out, graudate dorms r are hardly ever included; football ,r ticket applications, for example, were mailed at the beginning of the semester 
, 
to all on-campus students, except graduate dorms. For all practical pur­poses, it is as if graduate dorms make up a separate campus. 
But why are graduate dorms not con­sidered part of the Notre Dame campus? The problem here is clearly not physical distance. No, the reason is rather rooted in a general "graduate student" mindset that prevails at Notre Dame. The dorm example is merely one of the many symptoms of this mindset. This mindset is responsible for the peculiarly neglected situation of graduate students at Notre Dame: it creates a spiritual and psychological distance between graduate students and the rest of the community. 

"Graduate students exist, yes," you will be told, "we see them around (or at least we think we do, every now and then), but for all practical purposes, they are not really there. And that is natural of course since they are differ­ent. They are older, they spend all their time doing research and reading books, and they are not interested in what goes on on campus." 
That is the stereotype, and it defines the general "graduate student" mindset in our community. At the sug­gestion that graduate students are not after all that different, or that they may be interested in what goes on in the community, eyebrows are usually raised in incredulity, dumbfounded ex- pressions at the apparent contradiction (graduate students have a life apart from their research and away from their labs? ! ) , and a general skepticism about the suggestion. "No," people will reply, ''they are not interested, and be­sides they have no time...." 
The "graduate student" mindset is soprevalent that only within a couple of months many graduate students begin to contract it. They too start to share the view that they have nothing in common with the rest of the commu­nity, or don't have the time or the in­terest to get involved. In that way they help perpetuate the mindset and, as a consequence, they live in this community--many even longer than undergraduates do-leaving little behind 
The "graduate student" mindset is so prevalent that only within a couple of months many gradu­ate students begin to contract it. 
them and taking with them tortuous memories of how tough those years of graduate research had to be, and how little they grew personally. 
The saying goes that whereas Notre Dame is the mother of all undergradu­ates, it is the stepmother of graduate students. How sadly true it is! 
But Father Malloy has a vision of Notre Dame becoming a prominent graduate institution. We all want to see that happen, perhaps graduate stu­dents more than anyone else. But before that can happen that mindset must be changed. Instead of being fixed on the differences which separate graduate students from the rest (an ob­sessive assumption that has been the cause of the critical segregation suf­fered by graduate students at Notre Dame), we must look for the similarities, goals and purposes shared by them and the rest of the University so that they can start finding their place in this community. 
There is no denying that graduate students are in many respects differ­ent, and as such they have different needs that must be attended to. Some radical changes will need to be made, no doubt. And these changes cannot be limited to the improvement of our aca­demic programs. The living conditions of graduate students must improve at every level. 
The change that is needed will be painful, as any change in the status quo tends to be. But if Notre Dame wants to become an important graduate insti­tution, a rich and vital intellectual cen­ter, we need to begin thinking about graduate students' needs, academic and personal, and about how to meet them. 
If we are committed to the growth of the graduate school, we must begin to think differently. The "graduate stu­dent" mindset must be shed by all, graduate students, undergraduates, and the University administration alike. In the end we will all benefit from that. 
Victor J. Krebs is a graduate student in philosophy and is president of the Graduate Student Union.

National health plan makes sense 
Socialized medicine. For Americans, these words wreak havoc upon our in­tellectual, moral and institutional poli­tical responses. Anything ''socialized'' must certainly connote communism, and as every red-blooded, flag-waving American understands, this must be a bad thing. Socialized medicine, there­fore, must be shunned and avoided at all cost. At least that is what the Amer­ican Medical Association would have us believe. 
Michael Schadek

After all, socialized services neces­sarily relegate competition--hence efficiency--to a lesser priority, and theoretically the patients lose quality health care. Remember, however, that

this falsehood is propagated by the AMA, one of the largest and most pow­erful special interests in Washington. In essence, it is the AMA's job to main­tain the huge profits secured by scrupulous and unscrupulous doctors, all in the name of good medicine. 
While I cannot claim complete knowl­edge of the U.S. health care profession, I have experienced a remarkable event 
which brought my perception of our system into question. During my first travel break here in London, my mom came to visit. To her dismay as well as mine, the night before we were sched­uled to leave for Paris, she suddenly developed a minor eye infection. As the condition worsened, we decided it necessitated a visit to the nearby hospi­tal emergency room. 
Upon arrival, we were surprised by the prompt attention she received. A small sign on the wall indicated

My mom and I were shocked, and to our further surprise, a doctor examined her thoroughly, explained the condition and gave her the neces­sary eye medication. We then proceeded to walk out of the hospital without having paid a dime, all thanks to the British National Health Service. 
One could not help but feel that here was a system truly dedicated to the health and well-being of the patient. Gone was the cold, callous, profit­dominated mentality of so many Amer­ican hospitals, and instead the idyllic stature of medicine as a healing agent seemed to rule. The fact that my mom was not a citizen did not matter in the least. The point remained that she re­quired health care and the National Health Service responded with quality, efficient service as it does for every British man, woman and child regard­less of status.

impressed, and at the same time, one cannot help but begin to question our system, which stands in stark contrast to that of the NHS. 
Is it asking too much of the richest, most technologically advanced nation on earth to provide all its citizens with a national health plan? It not only makes sense from a moral standpoint-­after all, should health care, a basic human necessity, really be contingent upon an individual's ability to pay?-­but it makes economic sense as well. Because Great Britain can draw upon 
the national resources and everyone pays into the system, costs are much lower as a whole. Thus, the percentage of GNP spent on health care in Great Britain is 5.9 percent, and everyone is covered. By contrast, the United States pays 10.5 percent of its GNP for health care, yet millions upon millions aren't lucky enough to partake in the service. 
Obviously something is wrong with our system, and it is time to take a new look at real reform, even though the AMA will undoubtedly protest it all the way. In the meantime, one can only hope to find oneself in London during any serious health problems because the care and treatment will be superb as well as free of charge.

Mud-slinging Mom breaks sit-com mold 
R
emember when TV moms were perfect? Mrs. Brady never flew off the handle when her kids swore (you know, "Bobby's a stinker."), and only Maggie Seaver would ground herself for lying to prove a point; however, those days of life in Xanadu are over. This year one TV mom dares to call her children "three little mooches who suck ourselves dry." That woman could only be Roseanne Barr. 
Joe Bucolo 
To Be Continued 

On Tuesdays at 7:30p.m. after "Who's the Boss?" ABC airs TV's most realistic sit­com and surest hit, "Roseanne." The show stars Barr as Roseanne Parker, a loving, caring, and sarcastic mother of three. Dan (John Goodman) is Roseanne's hus­band who has a hard time finding a job and an even harder time holding on to one. The three "mooches" are Becky (Lecy Goranson), Darlene (Sarah Gilbert), and 
D.J. (Michael Fishman). The series also features Roseanne's sister Jackie (Laurie Metcalf> and friend Crystal <Natalie West>, who work with Roseanne at the factory. 
What makes the show so appealing is its sarcastically­tainted sense of realism. Gone are the traditional sit­com plots like brothers be­
coming each other's slaves 
for life or mothers and daughters spending the day at the hair salon. This show has the unique ability to find the humor in common, everyday situations. 
One plot in which the children are misbehaving provokes Roseanne to declare, "This is why some species eat their young." The kids on this show talk back. When Darlene asks Roseanne 

why she's so mean, the mot­her replies, "Because I hate kids and I'm not your real mom." Darlene does not mind: "Then at least there's hope." While Dan tries to pay off some of the Parkers' many bills, Roseanne tells him about her own personal method: "You pay the ones marked 'final notice' and throw the rest away." The children are soon fighting again and, after D.J. says that Becky hates him, Roseanne responds, "You go right ahead and hate her back." 
Just as Roseanne's relation­ship with her children is far from harmonious, her rela­tionship with Dan is subject to her own moods. When Dan decides to apply for a job, she says, "You're not going to get it." Dan replies, "Well,

there's a lot of guys bid­ding ... and they're all a lot better than you, I bet." 
Beneath this surface of derogatory mud-slinging which reminds one of the up­coming presidential election, the Parkers are a loving fam­ily. Viewers watch as Roseanne helps her children with homework, encourages them to participate in house­hold chores, and helps them to believe in themselves. In one scene during which Dan and Roseanne are fighting, 
D.J. cuts himself and the fight takes a back seat as Roseanne and Dan comfort their son only as parents can. 
The performances are won­derful. While Barr still tends to act from time to time as if she were doing stand-up com­edy, she is a natural in this role. (She should be; it was made for her.) She is a mot­her to whom viewers can relate. Goodman is also quite good as Dan. He is able to play off Barr and portray a caring, individualistic hus­band. A final word must be said about the show's sets. The Parker residence is messy and always upset; things aren't always in their places--in fact, they seldom are. This is a refreshing switch form the glamorous, unrealistic homes depicted on other shows. 
"Roseanne" is a witty, won­derful comedy that makes even the most routine of inci­dents seem funny. When a

Smith this week if Smith's nag­ging hamstring injury is healed. 
Despite the Broncos' poor play in last week's 39-21loss at Pittsburgh, Coach Dan Reeves planned no shakeups in the starting lineup, except for those necessitated by injury, for Monday night's game at In­dianapolis. 
Pro Bowl linebacker Karl Mecklenburg will be sidelined six weeks after re-fracturing his right thumb and undergoing surgery. To replace him, the Broncos will shift strong inside linebacker Rick Dennison to Mecklenburg's spot at weak in­side linebacker, and Bruce Klostermann will move up to fill Dennison's spot. 
Quarterback John Elway, who sat out the loss to Pit­tsburgh, should return to action Monday night.

ready," Reeves said Wednes­day. "We'll practice him today, and by Monday he should be close to 100 percent. Other than accommodations for injuries, I don't foresee any changes in the starting lineup." 
The Broncos created two roster spots when they put Mecklenburg on injured reserve and released Thomas, but Reeves was vague about how, or when, those two spots would be filled. 
Smith, a starter who has been plagued by injury the past few seasons, seemed the likeliest prospect to be activated. 
"We feel like Dennis should be 100 percent, but we won't know for sure until he prac­tices," Reeves said. "We felt like he was ready to go two weeks ago, too, and he had some problems with his leg then." 
Wide receiver Steve Watson, out with a neck injury, is an­other candidate, as are linebackers Steve Bryan and Randy Thornton. 
Reeves seemed in no partic­ular hurry to replace Mecklen­burg with another linebacker. 
"We could go with six lineback­ers for a while," he said. "Marc Munford could come back in two weeks." 
When the Broncos acquired Thomas three weeks ago from the Chicago Bears, the fullback was expected to finally provide Denver with the big back they had been lacking. It didn't work out that way. Thomas' inability on Sunday to make a first down on a fourth-and-one play--when he ran to the wrong hole-­apparently hastened his depar­ture. 
Asked his reasons for cutting Thomas, Reeves said, "We felt like we had to make room for people coming back (from in­jury). We felt it was a luxury to keep six running backs. We felt we could get the job done without him." 
Reeves branded the AFC West "the worst division in the league right now. Just look at the records. Nobody has played well. But nobody is really out of it, either." 
Denver and Seattle lead the division, both with 4-4 records. 
SMC volleyball defeats Bethel and Manchester 
By ELIZABETH VANDER SARL Sports Writer 
In a season plagued by injur­ies, the Saint Mary's Belles have had difficulties playing to their full capacity, but through determination and leadership they recently posted two big victories. 
On Oct. 13 the Belles clinched 
victory over Bethel College in 
a tedious and exhausting four­
game match. Saint Mary's took 
an early lead, winning the first 
game 15-2. The team struggled 
in the second game, losing 9-15, 
but they came back strong win­
ning the final two straight 
games and the match 15-10 and 
15-13. 
Tuesday night at Angela Ath­letic Center the Belles played host to Manchester in a match that stretched to five games. 
SMC started strong with great blocking and spiking by Katy Killilea and Michelle Sibilsky, which allowed for a first game victory of 15-9. For much of the second game there was a tied score, but Manchester held on and rallied back, winning both the second and third games 9-15 and 6-15. 
Saint Mary's showed deter­mination and strong serving in winning the fourth game 15-11 and tying the game score. Senior captain Tami Suth's powerful serving, despite a broken finger, assisted the Belles in gaining a 7-0 lead in the fifth game. 
"Tami Suth really made a difference," said Head Coach Sue Medley. 
Mary Macdiermid displayed superb execution at the net and played a significant role in the Belles fifth game victory 15-9. 
"Lately, we have not played up to our potential, but we have been able to pull out of bad sit­uations," Medley said. 
The Belles are hoping for a crowd and lots of support in their tourney on Friday and Saturday, Oct. 29 and 30 at 5:00 in Angela.

this season. Nonetheless, he 
continues to receive work in practice at both quarterbackand tailback. 
"Right now, we're just gonna work him at those two posi­tions," said Strong. "He'll spend a little more time at the tailback position, but he's also getting ample work at quarter­back. Wherever Coach Holtz feels like Steve can help the 
said Belles. "I decided to come here and so I just decided to stick it out. I'm getting enough (playing) time where I'm hel­ping the team and I think that's all that matters now." 
Strong believes this willing­ness to "stick it out" is one of Belles' greatest attributes. He likens the senior's role on the team to that of a baseball utility player, truly a valuable asset for a Division I football program such as Notre Dame. 
"Steve Belles is a true Notre Dame football player,"asserted the second-year coa­ch, "because he's accepted his role and he's continued to work 
unselfish from the standpoint of wherever we want to play him, he's been willing to play there. He's given of himself to help this football team be a bet­ter team. That's what Notre Dame's all about." 
Considering the rash of injur­ies the Irish backfield has been subjected to this season and the abundance of quarterbacks on the roster, Belles is expected to see more action at halfback

Dodgers' Lasorda voted best in N L 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK--Tommy Lasorda, who led Los Angeles to the World Series champion­ship and their sixth National League West title in 12 years, was named NL Manager of the Year Wednesday by the Baseball Writers Association of America. 
Lasorda received 101 points in balloting by a committee of two writers from each NL city. He had 19 first-place votes and was named on 23 of 24 ballots. It was the second time Lasorda was voted manager of the year. He won the award in 1983, its initial year. 
Jim Leyland of Pittsburgh was second with 50 points after leading the Pirates to an 85-75 record and second place in the East behind the New York Mets. 
Davey Johnson, who led the Mets to a league-leading 100-60 record and their second East title in three years, was third with 38 points. 
Jack McKeon, who took over the Padres from Larry Bowa on May 28, was fourth with 27 points. San Diego was 67-48 un­der McKeon and had the second-best record in the league over the final four months of the season. 
Lasorda learned that he had won while flying to Los Angeles after the Dodgers had been honored VVednesday at the White House. 
"This completes my day--one of the greatest days of my life,'' the Dodger manager told Jack Lang, secretary-treasurer of the writers' group.

Women's soccer takes two of three 
By COLLEEN HENNESSEY Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's soccer team improved its record to 13-3-1 over fall break, but there are some that would argue that it should rightfully read 14-3. 
The 1-0 win over St. Benedict's and a 2-0 defeat of Bowling Green pose no difficul­ties, but a touchy 1-1 tie with Saint Mary's leaves Irish Head coach Dennis Grace fuming. 
"It was a horrible call, a cru­cial call to determine the game," he said. 
"It was a free goal, an unjus­tified penalty kick that at best should have been an indirect from outside the box," he said of the controversial foul that led to the tie. 
One thing Grace cannot be upset over is the team defense the Irish have played recently. 
"For all practical purposes, we've shut out our last three opponents," he insists. "And those shutouts are very impor­tant to us because if we go into the game with a shutout atti­tude, we can't lose, and it loosens things up defensively." 
The team will take to the road on Friday, heading for Dayton to play in a four-team tournament with Dayton, Xavier and Wright State. 
"Right now we're not sure of our ranking in the tourna­ment," said Grace. "It's going to be a tremendous challenge." 
The Irish have been prepar­ing for the weekend by working on one of Grace's pet peeves-­poor offensive and defensive transitions, specifically getting the attacking players to move back to effectively block the counter attack. 
"Our transitions were definitely a big problem on Sun­day (against St. Benedict)," said junior K.T. Sullivan. "Coach has had us working on it all week and I think we'll do well this weekend." 
"We have to think in terms of team defense and team of­fense," Grace said. "We think of our defense as 11 bodies. I'm comfortable with how the team is responding." 
The Irish are hoping to see the return of stopper Michelle Richards this weekend, who is out with an ankle injury sus­tained in the Saint Mary's game. 
"She still isn't practicing," said Sullivan. "But we hope to have her back because she is an important factor." 
Because of scheduling prob­lems Grace will not be accom­panying the team to Dayton, heading to Miami with the men's team instead. Assistant coach Neil Schmidt will take over. 
All in all, the Irish are opti­mistic. They have reason to be as they have outscored their op­ponents this season by at least 50-12. 
"I really think we could surprise some people," said Grace.

For 0-7 Rice, the worst has yet to come 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON -The Rice Owls, burdened with 13 straight defeats and the nation's longest losing streak, are staring into the face of impending disaster. 
Saturday, they play at 11th ranked Arkansas, and the fol­lowing week, it's No. 2 ranked Notre Dame at South Bend, Ind. 
The Owls haven't won a game since a 38-28 victory over Southwest Texas State in the fourth game last season. Rice hasn't had a winning season since 1963. 
The Owls inherited the longest streak when Columbia ended its 44-game skid Oct. 8 with a 16-13 victory over Princeton. 
"The streak is bad," fullback Lorenzo Cyphers said. "We want to break it as quickly as possible. You try not to think about it. If you think about it all the time it would be a dis­traction." 
Arkansas will be even thoug­her than usual because the Razorbacks are in line for a long-awaited Cotton Bowl berth after a crucial 26-21 vic­tory over Houston last week. Arkansas needs two victories .. in its final three games for that bowl ticket.

"We played well as a whole and I could not single one per­son out," said coach Michele Gelfman. "We won as a team." 
"The tournament was espe­cially difficult because we were forced to switch our lineup at the last minute," Gelfman con­tinued. "I was really proud of how everyone came through." 
The Irish were without their number one singles player, CeCe Cahill, who was ilL In ad­dition, Ann Bradshaw was out with a sprained ankle and Natalie Illig could not compete for personal reasons. Junior captain Alice Lohrer, still sidelined with a back injury, was also missing from the lineup. 
Katie Clark took Cahill's 
place in the top position, fol­
lowed by Tracy Barton, Kristy 
Doran, Kim Pacella, Tyler 
Musleh, and Cathy Bradshaw. 
Gelfman was especially pleased with the performance of the doubles teams of Barton­Clark, Doran-Pacella, and Musleh with Anne Marie Dega. 
"The doubles were difficult because the girls had to play with new partners, people they had never played with before," Gelfman said. 
"Our number five doubles team (Musleh and Dega) had to move up and play the num­ber three teams from all the other schools. They played ex­ceptionally well," Gelfman added. 
The Irish travel to Houston Nov. 4-6 to compete in the Rice Tennis Classic where they will face teams ranked among the top twenty in the nation. 
"The caliber of competition will be much higher," remarked Gelfman. "Hope­fully the girls will be fully recovered in time."

ND lacrosse to face powerful Johns Hopkins 
By PETE LaFLEUR Sports Writer 
An article in the Literary Digest describes lacrosse as "a game for those who enjoy speed, thrills, power, keen competition, solid impact, courage and precision, en­durance and fair play." 
And the team that in many people's minds best ex­emplifies these qualities, Johns Hopkins University, will take on Notre Dame here Friday night in what is easily the big­gest game in Irish lacrosse his­tory. 
Hopkins has turned their 
mastering of the fundamentals 
into 42 national titles (three of 
the last five) and countless All­
Americans. 
No class has ever graduated 
from Hopkins without a na­
tional title, thus laying the foundation for a tradition that is seemingly unmatched in col­legiate sports. 

"They (Hopkins) have a little bit of the mysticism that Notre Dame does in football. In fact, many even refer to them as the Notre Dame of college lacrosse," said Irish first year coach Kevin Corrigan. 
While Johns Hopkins has perennially participated in the NCAA Final Four, Notre Dame has only been a varsity sport for nine years and has come close the last two years to cap­turing the NCAA Tournament's Western bid. 
Although the fall season for lacrosse is only for exhibition, Corrigan says the Irish should be ready to play to the capacity necessary against such an op­ponent as Hopkins. 
"We are committed to playing this game to show that this is the direction we want to go," he said. "This is a great opportunity for our kids and I expect they'll have great inten­sity. I worry about our execu­tion but not our intensity." 
Hopkins' visit takes on even further significance when ap­plied to the Midwest and to fu­ture Irish recruiting. After playing the Irish, the Bluejays will travel to East Lansing for a game with Michigan State. The Spartans are expected to attend the game in South Bend as are several high school groups from the Chicago area. 
"It's great for Hopkins to come out. They're doing this to help the lacrosse in the Mid­west and it's going to be a great help to us," Corrigan said. "The game will help legitimize our program and we will use it as a selling point to high school kids by showing them we can 

The Notre Dame lacrosse team faces a stiff test previews what could be the biggest game In 
do something like this." 
Rich O'Leary, who coached the Irish for 18 years before recently leaving to concentrate on his position at non-varsity athletics, said the Johns Hop­kins game is a tribute to all those who have participated in the program during its 25 years. 
"This game puts Notre Dame in a different perspective na­tionally and that is a credit to all those who participated in Notre Dame lacrosse at all levels. This one game isn't going to make Notre Dame's future, but you have to be con­fident with this kind of effort." 
Senior tri-captain John Olmstead said that the team is well aware of the game's sig­nificance. He said that a new coach and a game of this mag­nitude combine to suggest the dawning of a "new era" in Irish lacrosse. 
"Everyone associated with lacrosse knows what Johns Hopkins is all about and it will just be an incredible experi­ence to be on the same field as them," Olmstead said. "But at the same time we have hope. We've worked very hard this fall and overall it's not whether we win or lose but how this propels us into the spring.''

As Notre Dame continues to strive for the national championship, the kicking game has become a prime target for scrutiny and criticism by watchers of the Irish football team. 
"We have a very good kicking ga:me," Head Co­ach Lou Holtz said in defense of his team. "Our kicking hasn't been good, but our kicking game has impressed me." 
Fullback Anthony Johnson, who first saw action on kickoffs against Air Force last Saturday, may have more opportunities Saturday against Navy in Baltimore, but, contrary to rumors that say other­wise, Holtz says he will still go with the combination of Reggie Ho and Billy Hackett that has gotten the Irish through the first seven games of the season. 
"I think it's a little premature to be making any radical changes on our team," Holtz said. "We might have Anthony Johnson trying a point after, a short field goal, maybe some kickoffs, but we're still going to see Reggie Ho and Billy Hackett kick­ing." 
Ho has handled the PATs and short field goals for the Irish, hitting 25 of 27 points after and eight of 10 field goals to lead the team in scoring with 49 points. Hackett was successful on his one point after try and is one for two on field goals. 

Johnson also practiced punting during Wednes­day's practice, but Jim Sexton still holds down the job for Notre Dame. 
"Jim Sexton has been doing a nice job," Holtz said. "He's averaging about 40 yards a punt, and we haven't had one blocked this season, so I can't really complain there. 
"We're third in the nation in punt returns, I think we're seventh in kickoff returns, no blocked punts, no really long runbacks," Holtz continued. "So you can't say we're having too much trouble with the kicking game. Maybe the kickers, but not the kick­ing game." 
Although Holtz says his prime concern is Navy, and everyone is talking about the bowl games, the schedulers are looking ahead to the 1989 Kickoff

The Saint Mary's soccer completed their home season play· by defeating Indiana Uni­versity at South Bend Wednes­day by a score of 3-0, bringing their record to 8-6. 
Greer Gilliland scored the first goal near the end of the first half. The Belles controlled most of the game and kept the ball near their opponents' goal. 
"Our team played intel­ligently,"said Head Coach Tom Van Meter. "Many players played in positions dif­ferent from their usual ones." 
Senior Anne Szweda scored the second goal early in the half. The intensity lessened during the second half and as it continued, Saint Mary's took control of the game. 
Anne Hartzel scored the final goal halfway throughout the second half. The Belles' play demonstrated their ability to connect with one another. 
"Indiana has improved since last year," said Van Meter, "Our quality of play has im­proved during the two years I've been here." 
Coming off a win should help the Belles in their games this weekend against the College of Wooster and Oberlin College. Both are NCAA Division III teams. 
"This should be a good mea­suring point for us to play against Division III schools," said Van Meter. 
The Belles' final games will be away on Saturday and Sun­day.

Former defensive lineman Tom Gorman has made the switch to offense to bolster the Irish of­fensive line. Gorman joins Irish tri-captain Andy Heck as former tight ends now playing on the line. 
"Gorman's doing very well after just a very short time," Holtz said. "We needed some help and he's doing a job. He's a natural offensive player. I'm amazed at how far he's come in just two weeks, he played against Air Force, and you'll see him playing more."
