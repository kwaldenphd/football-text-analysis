Gorbachev, Castro meet 

Associated Press 
HAVANA-Presidents Mik­hail Gorbachev and Fidel Castro went behind closed doors Monday for marathon talks expected to air their ideological differences and highlight the problems of Third World nations. 
A Soviet spokesman1 asked whether Gorbachev would of­fer to forgive Cuba's massive debt to the Soviet Union, said that subject was not discussed specifically, although the leaders did talk about the "enormous debt plundering the economies" of Latin American countries. 
The spokesman, Gennady Gerasimov, said Gorbachev's initial discussions with Castro and the Cuban Communist Party's Central Committee were held in a ''friendly atmo­sphere." 
He also said Gorbachev re­ported on the Soviet Union's recent multicandidate par­liamentary elections, which were seen as a popular victory for the party's reformers. Castro, who has never allowed competitive elections in his 30­year rule, has openly criticized Gorbachev's reforms for bor­rowing too much from the capitalist world. 
After the ceremonial laying of a wreath at the monument to Jose Marti, the father of Cuban independence, Castro escorted his guest to the Palace of the Revolution to begin their discussions, which were sched­

CHANGING OF THE GUARD 
Breslin and Kinkopf work for improved student govt. 
By FLORENTINE HOELKER Senior Staff Reporter 
Editor's note: This is the second of a two-part series. 
The new student government administration under Student Body President Matt Breslin and Vice President Dave Kinkopf will make an effort to "continue and improve upon the accomplishments of the previous adminstration'' in the coming year, according to Breslin. 
"In areas such as intellectual life and student service, the target areas of Doyle and Paese, we shall make an effort to continue and expand on the ideas they presented," said Breslin. 
"Things like the Iceberg Debates and·the Board of Trus­tee Reports were excellent ac­complishments under the last administration," Breslin said. "and indicate the positive trend that student government has been following for the past few years. We want to continue that trend." 
Breslin and Kinkopf plan to keep up the good relationship that Doyle and Paese main­tained with the University ad­ministration. They have spoken with Universiy Presi­dent Father Edward Malloy a number of times in regard to the coming year. 
"As we (Malloy and Bres­liwKinkopf) each represent dif­ferent interests, we naturally will have disagreements, but a positive working relationship is the only way to get things done for the students," said Kinkopf. 
Concerning student service, "'?"concerns of the students," said 
Breslin and Kinkopf plan to focus on this issue and have a variety of new ideas to aid in their plans. 
"First of all," said Breslin, "we've got the groundwork for things like the 24-hour lounge. Because Doyle and Paese started that, we've got a cus­hion to fall back on. 
"The idea is started, and we can hopefully make it more of a reality." 
Breslin and Kinkopf also have plans to construct a 'legal department' in student govern­ment which will research is­sues before they are presented to the administration. 
"With the establishment of this department of student gov­ernment, we will have more ra­tional, intelligent responses to

Kinkopf. 
"A main focus of the depar­tment will be Board of Trustee Reports. Information from the reports will be brought to the attention of those in the admin­istration who most need to see it," Kinkopf said. 
"Hopefully with the research done and the information in the Trustee Reports, we can have more implementation of the changes outlined in the reports themselves and an alteration of other policies that need chang­ing," said Kinkopf. 
Smaller services also are of concern to Breslin and Kinkoff. "You hear people complain about little things not provided, like phones in academic build­ings, and we want to make those things more available for the students," said Breslin. 
"Along with our long term projects, we hope to provide little things for the convenience of the students. We want to be more in touch with the students to provide their needs," said Kinkopf. · 
Although still assembling their cabinet, Bresling and Kinkopf hope to make that cabinet and the rest of student government more visible and accessible to students. 
This visibility includes an open-door policy for students with complaints or ideas for student government, and an ef­fort for increased publicity. "We're going to try to inform students of events, and try to let them know that we're here for them," said Breslin. 
1988-89 activity fee budget reported 
By CHRISTINE WALSH Staff Reporter 
The $55 student activities fee is the sole source of funds for the Student Activity Fee Budget, according to 1988-89 Student Body Treasurer Mic­helle Zinser. 
The Student Activities Fees Budget, which is prepared each April by the Student Senate Finance Committee, allocates money to student government, the Student Union Board, and over 80 clubs and organiza­tions. 
''Any club or organization has to be registered for a year before they .can appeal for money," said Zinser. 
Clubs and organizations in­clude the senior, junior, sopho­more and freshman classes, WVFI Radio, Hall President's Council, Judicial Council, Stu­dent Senate, and Off-Campus Council. Funds also go to groups such as academic clubs, special interest clubs such as BACCHUS and the Keenan Revue, athletic clubs, social

WORLD BRIEFS 

Syrian and Christian gunners shelled residential areas of Beirut Monday, and politicians failed once again to stop the most violent chapter in Lebanon's long civil war since 1985. A police spokesman said 20 people were killed and 42 wounded since the non-stop bombardment of the city and surrounding hills began at dusk Saturday. That brought the casualty toll to 147 killed and 481 wounded, nearly all civilians, since the battle began March 8 between the Christian army units of Gen. Michel Aoun and Druse militiamen backed by Syrian troops. 
NATIONAL BRIEFS 

President Bush met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Monday in Washington, opening a week of intensive talks on the Middle East. Bush said "a new atmosphere" must be created between Israel and Arab nations. After more than an hour of discussion, Bush urged an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza, endorsed the "achievement of Palestinian political rights" and said a "properly structured" international peace conference could play a useful role. The tone of Bush's remarks suggested the United States may attempt to exert pres­sure for compromise on Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who arrives in the United States on Wednesday and confers with Bush on Thursday. 
The Animal Liberation Front claimed responsibility Monday for two early-morning arson fires at the University of Arizona. The fires caused an estimated $100,000 damage and may have unleased a potentially deadly disease. The group claimed in a letter sent to news organizations that it freed more than 1,000 animals from three research facilities and set fire to a diagnostic lab and a converted house near the medical college campus. Charles Sterling, a professor of veterinary science, said 30 young mice infected with what he described as a Third World disease were among those taken.

The Indiana House overwhelmingly rejected a proposal Monday to remove the death sentence against Paula Cooper, convicted of a murder committed when she was 15 years old. The House voted 73-26 against the proposal which would have retroactively applied to Cooper's case a 1987 law raising from 10 to 16 the state's minimum age for a convicted murderer who can receive a death sentence. That law's standard applies to the,. age of the defendant at the time of the crime. Cooper was a 15-year-old Gary schoolgirl at the time of the 1985 stabbing death of Ruth Pelke, a 78-year-old Bible teacher. 
Two toddlers were killed and their parents were injured Monday when fire roared through their Perry County farmhouse near Cannelton, Ind., authorities said. Vanessa Fuchs, 3, and her 16-month-old brother, Quentin, died in the fire, which was re­ported shortly before 1 a.m. The children's father, Jeffrey Fuchs, 25, was in stable condition later in the day at Wishard Memorial Hospital in Indianapolis with burns over 50 percent of his body. Their mother, Jennifer, was treated at an area hospital for minor injuries and was released. When firefighters arrived at the home almost half of the frame structure was engulfed in flames. The children were found in a bedroom, where the fire is believed to have started. No cause of the fire was immediately determined. 
An explosion at Essex Wire Corp. in Vincennes, Ind., injured a laboratory technician. Phyllis Miciska, 41, of Vincennes, was in critical condition Monday. She was mixing chemicals when the explosion occurred about 10:15 a.m. Sunday, fire officials said. Miciska suffered burns over 80 percent of her body and was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in Vincennes. She later was transferred to the burn unit at Wishard Memorial Hospital in Indianapolis. Authorities said they had not determined the type of chemicals Miciska was mixing.

Frosh year reflections reveal shortcomings 
I was sitting in my Calculus class today when I decided to start working on my Inside Column. I was writing in my Calc class because my Calc class is BORING. As a matter of fact my math class is not my only boring class. The high school-ish requirements of the Freshman Year of Studies undoubtedly come to mind as I reflect on my first year ;:tt Notre Dame. 
My first year at Notre Dame has been fabulous and I know that I am very lucky to attend this institution. There are some situa­tions that exist that bother me and I am writing about them because I believe that with student inititive the University can be a place that all students can feel proud of. 
If I'm going to complain about the math re­quirement, I might as well complain about the science requirement, too. Lucky for me and many others, we have the advisors at the Fresh­man Year office. Without the free tutoring in· the Freshman Learning Resource Center I would have never survived. 
Another disturbing aspect of my first year is the chauvinism that is present at this once all­male institution. In my opinion, this chauvinism is present in the way that my dorm is run. Female dorms have a security monitor and a detex system. It is always nice to feel secure, but in my dorm our security guard extends her duties further than that. Our security guard makes rounds at parietals, breaks up parties and checks students for drunkeness at night. 
I feel that when the security guard assumes all this power the power of the hall staff is les­sened. Why is it that in the male dorms the staff handles the situations within the dorm, not a security guard? Are we saying that a female staff cannot handle breaking up social gather­ings and insuring that the students are in con­trol? 
One of the best parts of my freshman year has been the activities in the dorm and campus­wide that I have participated in. Working at

'The University can be a place that all students can be proud of.' 
Kelley Tuthill Assistant News Editor 
The Observer, I have met many new friends and learned a lot. However, I was both surprised and shocked at the harassment of several writers this year. I believe that when someone writes a column it is obvious that they are expressing their own opinions. Response is expected and desired-written response that is. Calling people at home and harassing them is uncalled for and immature. It also detracts from the exchange of ideas that is supposed to take place in a newspaper. 
The final situation that has been on my mind since my arrival here is the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's situation. It constantly bothers me that relations between Notre Dame women and Saint Mary's women are not what they could be. There are many negative stereotypes that both women 'express. 
In my opinion, the administration and student government could do their part in fostering bet­ter understanding between the two groups. Per­haps dorms and student government can spon­sor more activities with both groups of women. The relations could be improved if women from Saint Mary's were permitted to participate in more non-varsity athletic activities. 
I know that I sound like all I'm doing is com­plaining. Believe it or not I am very happy at Notre Dame.. However, throughout the year some situtions have bothered me. I write about them because I honestly hope and believe that in some ways certain problems can and will be alleviated in the next three years that I am a Domer.

'89-90 Senate gives plans for next year 
By Cathy Flynn Staff Reporter 

Gene Siskel will not appear as scheduled on April 4 due the death of his father said Raja Singh, Student Union Board Manager at the Student Senate meeting on Monday. 
Money will be refunded for tickets already purchased, Singh said. Siskel was sup­posed to be a part of a panel discussion on "American Values/American Film." 
Budget planning is one of the next things on the agenda for newly elected Senate. If a club needs money for next year, ap­plications are due on April 19 and can be picked up in room 315 in LaFortune. All club money from this year should be spent by April 21. 
Future expectations of the new Student Senate were also discussed. This was the first meeting of the 1988-'89 Senate, which is led by Student Body President, Matt Breslin. 
"I'd really like the Senate to be positive in the eyes of the students next year," Breslin said. "I'd like to explore new issues at the University and try to make the Senate as effective as possible," he added. 
Another role of the Senate is to safeguard the rights of stu­dents, Kinkopf said. Students are encouraged to utilize the senators whenever they have an issue they think should be presented,he added. 
Meetings are open to all stu­dents. They will be held every Monday night at 6 p.m. in the Notre Dame room at LaFor­tune. 
Exxon issues public apology as Ala:skan oil spill worsens 

Associated Press 
VALDEZ, Alaska-Exxon apologized Monday for causing the nation's biggest oil spill and promised to clean up every fouled beach in Prince William Sound, but workers on those greasy-smelling beaches said their efforts are futile. 
Police continued searching for the captain of the tanker Exxon Valdez, which crashed into Bligh Reef on March 24, spilling 10.1 million gallons of North Slope crude. 
The oil slick has now grown larger than Rhode Island. Scientists reported more wildlife deaths and said a vital herring fishery was threatened. The Prince William Sound fishery is worth more than $150 million annual­ly. 
"I want to tell you how sorry I am that this accident took place," said Exxon Chairman 
L.G. rawl in full-page adver­tisements placed in newspapers Monday. 
"We cannot, of course, undo what has been done. But I can assure you that since March 24, the accident has been receiving our full attention and will con­tinue to do so." 
More than 1,000 seabirds and at least 20 sea otters caught in the oil have died, some found covered with asphalt-hard oil. Officials said the death toll is probably much higher, but they have had time to survey only a slice of the sound's 2,500 miles of coastline.

Department of Fish and Game spokesman Jon Lyman said Monday a deer found dead on Naked Island about 25 miles southwest of the tanker had aJP­parently eaten contaminated food, an indication of how rapidly the spill was spreading. 
"That's bad news. That's the top of the food chain,'' Lyman said. 
On nearby Green Island, hundreds of birds lay along the beach, as black and lifeless as the oil-smeared rocks around them. Sheltered coves and rocky points, usually clamor­ing with the sound of gulls and other shorebirds, were silent. 
"Every day, it's getting a little worse," otter rescue spe­cialist Chris Donohoe said as he squatted by a dead sea duck. "You clean a beach up, the tide changes, and the oil come~s right back.'' 
Oil is so thick that walking on once postcard-perfect beaches is treacherous, and workers wear hardhats to protect against injuries from frequent tumbles on rocks. Oil sprayed by waves splatters rocks and driftwood logs high above the tideline. Beaches smell like gas station garages. 

More than half the spawning habitat used by Prince William Sound herring has been fouled, said Dennis Haanpaa, a fis­heries biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. 
Exxon officials have conceded that beach cleanup efforts so far have been futile. But the company said it began a new assault with more effecc tive gear, more workers and a floating command post. 
Exxon Shipping Co. Presi­dent Frank Iarossi said Exxon planned to flush beaches by pumping seawater over them, then collect oil from the water with skimmers. 
"We intend not to leave until the job is done," Iarossi said. "We intend to leave Prince William Sound close to what it was before the tragedy."

State officials have blasted Exxon's effort to scrub beaches as dismal and ineffective. Less than 4 percent of the thick crude has been recovered. 
The spill has fouled more than 800 miles of shoreline in Prince William Sound, and the amount grows each day. 
Exxon fired Capt. Joseph Hazelwood last week. The 42­year-old skipper admitted drinking before boarding the Exxon Valdez, according to court documents. Blood and urine samples taken nine hours after the accident indicated he was drunk. 
An arrest warrant has been issued in Alaska for him, but his whereabouts were un­known. Hazelwood is presumed to have gone home to Hunting­ton, N.Y., and Sgt. Clifton Smith of the New York State Police said there were indica­tions that he had contacted a lawyer and might surrender soon.

uled to continue on and off through the day and evening. 
Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, visited a day care center, a Cuban-Soviet friendship center and planned to tour the home of the late American author Ernest Hemingway, who lived for many years on an estate outside Havana that is now a museum. Both Mrs. Gorbachev and her husband have men­tioned reading Hemingway, a writer whose works have been tranlated into Russian and are popular in the Soviet Union. 
Gerasimov said Gorbachev and Castro, in their opening talks, exchanged views on the March 26 Soviet elections and discussed problems in Latin America, particularly those of 
indebtedness  and  the  drug  
trade.  
The  spokesman  observed  

that Latin American countries are increasingly becoming drug suppliers to North America while at the same time increasingly becoming drug consumers. 
The debt is only one aspect of the economic ties between the Soviet Union and Cuba. So­viet economic aid to Cuba is es­timated by Western sources at between $4 billion and $7 billion annually.

The total allocations for clubs and organizations in the 1988-89 budget were $164,850, and represented the largest part of the budget. 
The next largest portion of the budget went to SUB, receiv­ing $155,545, and student gov­ernment was alotted $74,605. 
The total budget for the 1988­89 year amounted to approxi­mately $395,000. 
"Last year, it took about 30 hours, total, in meetings, to get this all (the budget) down," Zinser said. 
"Each year we oversee the allocations that we make, and hear appeals," said Zinser. Ap­peals can occur every week, and are made by the organiza­tions to which the Finance Committee makes the alloca­tions. Those who appeal are usually "people who weren't satisfied with what they got in the beginning, or they had a special event coming up that they needed extra money for," said Zinser. Sometimes ap­peals are made just in order to 
keep an organization running, she added.

WASHINGTON-The United States announced new measures to combat sky ter­rorism Monday as relatives of passengers killed in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing mounted a campaign to com­plain about aviation security and the government's "lack of compassion'' following the dis­aster. 
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, who along with President Bush met with several relatives of those killed in the explosion over Scotland, told a news conference that air­lines will be required to install devices to detect plastic ex­plosives in major U.S. and foreign airports.

Dec. 21 explosion, which has been blamed on a plastic device hidden in a radio-cassette player, praised Bush for con­cern shown in the meeting and said Skinner's announcement was a good first step. 
But spokesman Bert Ammer­man of Demarest, N.J., told a rally across the street from the White House that measures an­nounced by Skinner were "not enough." 
Ammerman, whose brother Tom was one of 270 victims of the crash, asked for a unified congressional investigation of the disaster, hand-searching of all luggage put aboard air­liners, and an end to a system that allows notification only of airline, airport and govern­ment security personnel when there's a terrorist threat.

The constitution for student government prevents govern­ment from using the money gotten from the student activ­ity fee for non-student oriented affairs, including donations to charity, and provides the guidelines for the operation of the budget commitee. The Uni­versity administration may also oversee the financial proceedings of the committee.

Doyle & Paese: a successful year 
The mantles of student body president and vice pres­ident have now offically been passed from Tom Doyle and Mike Paese to Matt Breslin and Dave Kinkopf respectively. 
Doyle and Paese have done an admirable job representing the needs of the students this past year. It is important that student government work with the administration and Doyle and Paese were able to continue to improve the relationship that Pat Cooke and Laurie Bink began two years ago. 
Doyle and Paese did an outstanding job increasing the political awareness of Notre Dame students. The students became more vocal in national and local politics as a result of their extensive voter registration drive and their efforts to educate students. The John Hiler/ Tom Ward debate on campus is testimony not only to their efforts to educate but also their registra­tion drive's success. 
For years students have been promised a 24-hour space by those running for office. Doyle and Paese were successful in obtaining the Oak Room as such a space, and although the Night Oak eventually closed, this was a direct result of student apathy and the profit-oriented motives the of Night Oak and not the lack of effort from student government. 
Breslin and Kinkopf have a tough act to follow. Doyle and Paese accomplished a lot, but the climate is right and there is still a lot to be done. 
The new student government administration must continue a healthy relationship with the University. They must work with each other, not against one an­other. 
It is necessary that Breslin and Kinkopf not only concentrate on fulfilling their campaign promises but also on improving on the few failed but solid plans of the Doyle! Paese administration. They must fulfill their campaign promise to create a legal department to examine student rights and needs. However, Doyle and Paese's plans for a 24-hour space and teacher evaluation forms should be explored and re-examined to see if these ideas are still practical. 
The Observer congratulates Tom Doyle and Mike Paese and wishes good luck to Matt Breslin and Dave 
Kinkopf.

A different spring brea' 

Dear Editor: 
For the past several years Notre Dame and Saint Mary's student have responded to the cries of powerlessness from the Appalachian region (an area delineated by the Appalacian mountain range in the eastern U.S.) by engaging in a one week worlv-Service project during either fall or spring break. This past spring break was no different as 67 students from this community traveled to given spots in Kentucky to take part in the Appalacian ex­perience. 
As I left the region to return home, I reflected on the week's activities and was content with the work that my group accom­plished. After further con­templation, however, I realized that we made no lasting mark on the region. We left Appalac­hia exactly as we found it: an impoverished area rich in nat­ural resources. What had been changed, though, was us: We were not. the same, selfish, microcosmic people after the experience. The mountain fold afforded us the opportunity to explore issues beyond our own narrow scope (how many job offers were received or what percentage of the girls on campus are dieting, for exam­ple), which is the special part of the experience. The beauty of the program is not what we did for the Appalachian people, but rather, what they did for us. 
So next year, when the temptations of exotic vacations 
abound,  consider  the  Ap­ 
palacian  experience  a  
preferred alternative.

Release due to publications 
Dear Editor: 
Why does Notre Dame fear academic freedom? Why does the administration of the most prestigious Catholic University in this hemisphere--an admin­istration which prides itself on being both tolerant and pro­gressive, fear something for truth on both sides of the liberal!conservative fence? 
Dr. Janet Smith of the Pro­gram of Liberal Studies was notified last May that she would no longer be teaching at the University after this aca­demic year. She is a victim of Notre Dame's academic "freedom." 
The facts: Dr. Smith is an ex­emplary professor in and out of the classroom, and she has proven herself to be an out­standing scholar, not only on the national level, but even on the international level. 
If the main criterion for hiring and firing teachers is whether or not they can teach, the Dr. Smith must stay. She has be consistently praised by her peers, but especially those who are most qualified to judge her ability: us, her students. Her annual student evaluations have been among the highest of all University professors, and I maintain with all sin­cerity that Dr. Smith was the finest teacher I had in four years at Notre Dame. 
Neither should Dr. Smith "perish" after eight years of service to the University be­cause of her record of publica­tions. With her numerous arti­cles and book reviews published in internationally ac­claimed philosophical magazines, she has surpassed the University tenure require­ments. In fact, she has built an international reputation for being a first-rate moral theolo­gian and philosopher. Dr. Smith lectures at universities and even at bishops' confer­ences throughout the United States and was recently honored to be one of the few American theologians invited to a symposium of moral theologians in Rome. 
The justification given by the University for denying Smith's tenure is that she has not pub­lished enough. Why are the publications rules being made more stringent in her case? 
Her book defending the Church's teaching on artificial birth control will be published soon by Catholic University press. Was that the deciding factor in the decision on her tenure? Could it be that there is academic freedom at Notre Dame--but only for those in conformity with the "Notre Dame magisterium?"

Breslin & Kinkopf ready 
Dear Editor: 
Well, it is now official. You can remove the "elect" from our titles because as of Aprill, we are the new student body president and vice-president. Scary thought, huh? Well, we hope you don't think it is too scary. Anyway, in all serious­ness, we would like to thank all of you who supported us in the election. The overwhelming support from the student body gives us a feeling of confidence as we enter the upcoming year. 
We have already been 
working intensely trying to get ourselves prepared for what lies ahead. We have spoken with Mayor Joe Kernan and Chief of Police Marsiniak on the problems facing students off-campus, and have inves­tigated the rezoning ordinance. We plan on meeting with Neigh­borhood Housing Services to clarify their future plans so we can determine what we need to do to ensure that students have off-campus housing available in future years. We have also met with Father Malloy to dis­cuss our plans for the future while establishing strong rela­tions with the administration. · One of the biggest problems that we are told about student government is the lack of com­munication between student government and the student body. We plan to rectify this by providing first-class publicity that will catch the eye of stu­dents and make our organiza­tion more visible. Posters and newsletters are one avenue of communication, but we will also communicate through The Observer. We believe it is a valuable tool for communicat­
ing what is available to you. 
All of our plans sound great 
on paper, but two people cannot 
do it alone. That is why we are 
encouraging you to share any 
new ideas that you may have. 
Furthermore, we encourage 
you to become a part of student 
government. Our cabinet is 
structured to deal with a vari­
ety of issues, so we are sure 
that you can find the right po­
sition for yourself. 
So if you have the enthusiasm 
to become a part of student 
government, stop by the secre­
tary's desk on the second floor 
of LaFortune, pick up an appli­
cation and set up an interview. 
Applications are due Wednes­
day, April 5. 
We look forward to serving 
you. You can plan on hearing 
from us real soon.

Novelist Percy awarded Laetare Medal 
Considered most 
*1 
prestigious given to ~ an American Catholic 
SARAH VOIGT accent writer 
N
ovelist Walker Percy, the recipient of the University of Notre Dame's 1989 Laetare Medal, acts like a doctor in many ways. 
Although Percy received his medical degree in 1941, he soon rejected his plans of becoming a psychiatrist so that he could devote all of his time to reading and writing. He may have rejected the biological aspects of healing, but his novels reflect a continued concern for the health of Man's mind and soul. 
Percy explains, "Having been trained as a doctor, my writing is naturally diagnostic. I approach Western society as a doctor who must prepare a case history. He must describe the patient, determine what is wrong and suggest a cure." 
Is there a cure for unhappiness and pain in our troubled society today? Percy responds, "In the end all issues come to religion. The cures are spiritual. Man must find out who he is, where he came from, and where he is going. For me, the answer is in religion." 
Percy won the Laetare Medal largely for the way his novels sensitively relate the Catholic 
'He does not write traditional religious novels . . . he deals with grace, redemption, and how the world is capable of reform' 
experience to his view of reality. The Laetare Medal has been awarded annually to a person "whose genius has ennobled the arts and sciences, illustrated the ideals of the Church and enriched the heritage of humanity." 

Annual artists' forum features 
'Heartbreak Poetry' 
COLLEEN GANNON accent writer 
T 
onight, Writers and other Troubadours, a South Bend community group, will provide an answer to Whitney Houston's musical question, 'Where do broken hearts go?' At 7:30, the group will hold their Third Annual Poetry Shootout at Senor Kel­ly's. 
The oral poetry contest will be an open mike format for anyone interested in par­ticipating. This year's theme, Heartbreak Poetry, leads Board Member Susan Brower to recommend the event to "anyone who has ever had heartbreak and put it down on paper." 

Mike Barga, a Notre Dame Graduate School alumnus, founded Writers and other Troubadours eight years ago. Brower feels the group con­sists of "people interested in bringing art to the South Bend community." 
From October to May, the group meets regularly every Tuesday night at Senor Kel­ly's. Every meeting begins with a feature performance given by various artists from poets to musicians, and is fol­lowed by an open forum. The feature performances are fifty percent literary and fifty percent musical. 
Responding to these impressive criteria, Percy said, "It was a big surprise to receive this honor. I don't feel like a genius. I write both fiction and nonfiction about themes that run counter to the usual mind set of the West­ern world." 
Percy's first novel, "The Moviegoer," won the 1961 National Book Award. His other widely read works include "The Last Gentleman," "Love in the Ruins," and "The Second Coming." He has also written two non-fictional books of philosophical essays entitled "The Message in the Bottle" and "Lost in the Cosmos." 
University President Father Edward Malloy is a member of the committee which selects the Laetare medal winner from an updated list of influential American Catholics. Malloy said, "Percy is one of the better known and most widely read contemporary authors. He is a person whose own faith and convictions make the difference. It becomes evident to those who read his books that he is concerned about the great issues of the Ca,tholic experience." 
Malloy continues, "He does not write tradi­tional religious novels with 'churchy' subject matter. Instead, he deals with grace, redemp­tion, and how the world is capable of reform." 
For the first part of his diagnosis of the human condition, Percy examines contempo­rary society and tries to discern its problems. 
The poetry contest will be judged by the audience, and a cash prize will be awarded to the first place winner. Also, the winning poem will gain recognition through publica­tion in the Writers and other Troubadours' Newsletter. Currently, the newsletter has a local mailing list consisting of 200 members. 
"The event should be very enjoyable because everyone will be participating in it." said Brower. There will be a $1.50 entrance fee for all con­test participants and audience members. The group wel­comes everyone "to share past or present sorrow with us and be a winner." 
"I use my characters to illustrate a curious phenomenon in our civilization today. Although most of our needs and desires have been met, we still don't seem any happier." 
"My novels are about the adventures of characters who have been overtaken by a curious feeling of dislocation. They don't know who they are or where they're going." 
The restless, dissatisfied characters in many of his novels help create what Percy refers to as "the very old Christian theme of Man as a pilgrim. These characters can be understood as wayfarers according to the old Christian view of Man that has been revised in this century." 
Percy elaborates, "Christian aiJ,thropology shows that Man is searching for-himself. He does not search for a scientific understanding but for a secret mystery of life or a deep truth. Life is a mystery that cannot be solved by science. Man is a wayfarer who looks to the Gospel for the Good News." 
Despite his previous study of medicme, Percy rejects science as a solution to his characters' "curious feeling of dislocation." He explains, "There seems to be more anxiety and alienation in spite of our advanced tech­nology and sciences. Our science, as advanced as it is, does not seem to be helping." 
'Life is a mystery that cannot be solved by science. Man is a wayfarer who looks to the Gospel for the Good News.' 
According to Percy, his latest novel, "The 
Thanatos Syndrome," is a satire that shows what goes wrong when you rely purely on scientific means to solve the fundamental problems of human society. 
Through the characterizations in his writings, Dr. Walker Percy suggests the Christian faith as a way to help cure the restlessness of the human spirit. 
Past winners of the Laetare Medal include President John Kennedy, Catholic Worker Founder Dorothy Day, Businessman J. Peter Grace, and Actress Helen Hayes. Percy be­comes only the seventh novelist to receive the Laetare Medal since it was established at Notre Dame in 1883.

Watson attempts a rebound 
Associated Press 
AUGUSTA, Ga.--Beneath the name on Tom Watson's busi­ness card, the line reads: "Golf Professional." 
"That's what I am," Watson said. 
"There are other responsi­bilities, other commitments," Watson said, mentioning a couple of golf courses he's building in Japan, "but I'm still a golf pro. Not anything else. That's what I do." 
And Watson, a five-time British Open champioll';' is bringing a renewed enthusi­asm and optimism to a com­eback attempt aimed at regaining the lofty position he once held in world golf. 
"It's getting a little better every week," he said before a practice round for the 53rd Masters that begins Thursday at the Augusta National Golf Club. "My attitude is good and my golf game reflects it." 
Watson, 39, won the Masters in 1977 and 1981 and has been second three other times. But he has been virtually over­looked in pre-tournament evaluations of potential win­ners. 
It's a situation that's becom­ing familiar to Watson, who once dominated the game, once was the center of attention at any tournament he entered. 
Watson is enduring an unex­plained slump that has lasted five years--with one joyous in­terruption at the 1987 Nabisco Championship. He hasn't been in title contention in eight starts this year. 
Five times the leading money winner arid six times Player of the Year, he is 64th on the season's money-winning list. 
While he is less than enchanted, Watson is far from dismayed. 
"My enthusiasm and pa­tience are better than at any time in the last two years," Watson said. 
He then analyzed some of his playing problems. 
"I got too mechanical," he said. "I was thinking too much about the swing.

Golf team finishes seventh 
Scott signs 1for $3.9 million 
By DAVE McMAHON Sports Writer 
Men's golf coach George Thomas returned from his alma mater with a seventh place finish in the season opener for the Irish at Purdue University's South Course. 
Notre Dame finished with a team total of 639 for the 36-hole event, which included Big 10 representatives Iowa and Wis­
consin, along with the Boiler­

beating the Hawkeyes by one stroke. Eastern Michigan took 
third with 611, followed by Southern Illinois (620), Wiscon­sin (624), Ball State (632) and 

Sophomore Paul Nolta led the Irish with a 77 on the first day before ending with a second day score of 80. 
"I'm hitting the ball better than I have in a while," said Nolta. "It's taken a while to get used to coach's new technique, but I'm starting to get used to it." 
That new technique installed by Thomas has forced the team to abandon all other strategies 
and concentrate solely on the

cancellation after Purdue co­ach Joe Campbell found "casual water" on the fifth 
green, which hurt the chances of an Irish comeback.

continued from page 12 back for Michigan with a 3­
pointer with 1:03 to play. 
After Morton threw up an air-ball with 53 seconds left, Mic­higan ran the clock down to 34 seconds before Sean Higgins made two free throws for the three-point lead that was erased by Morton's 3-pointer. 
Michigan had a chance for victory in regulation, but Rice missed a long jumper with two seconds to play. 
Higgins added 10 points and nine rebounds for Michigan, 30­
7. Rice added 11 rebounds. 
Walker and Greene each finished with 13 points for Seton Hall, 31-7, which was making its first Final Four appearance in just its second NCAA tourn-

Seton Hall stayed outside in the first half with 14 of its 32 field goal attempts coming from 3-point range, while Mic­
higan decided to test things in­side. 
The problem for the Pirates, who averaged 14 3-pointers per game in the regular season, was that they only managed to make four of the long jumpers. The last two by Greene and Morton capped a 12-0 run that turned a six-point deficit into a 26-20 lead with 6:48 left in the first half. 
Michigan answered with an 8-2 run of its own to even things at 28-28 with 4: 12 to play as Rice surrounded two driving hoops by Robinson with two free throws and a jumper.

Rose leaves controversybehind in seasonopener 

Associated Press 
CINCINNATI--Pete Rose basked in adulation instead of accusation, still a hero in his hometown. 
Gambling allegations against the Cincinnati manager were pushed aside for a minute Monday when a sel­lout crowd of 55,385 stood and cheered and chanted "Pete! pete!" and Reds owner Marge Schott planted a kiss on his cheek. 
"I guess my favorite thing is just the fact that baseball's started again," Rose said. 
There had been some ques­tion whether Rose would be there this year when the Reds opened against the World Se­
ries  champion  Los  Angeles  
Dodgers.  
But  with  major  league  

baseball's investigation of Rose still incomplete, he was sitting in the dugout on a sunny afternoon doing one of the things he enjoys most--talking baseball. 
"You always know it's going to be a good crowd when it's 10 minutes after 12 o'clock and you look and there's people already in the Bob Uecker seats," Rose said, glancing at the upper deck.

Officers 1989-90 
Reds 6, Dodgers 4 
Paul O'Neill played the hero's role in Monday's opening-day game against the Dodgers with a three-run homer Monday that carried the Cincinnati Reds over the World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers 6-4 in the first game of the major league season. 
The 103rd opening day in Cin­cinnati gave Rose some respite from two weeks of gambling al­legations that have clouded his future. 
The Reds made three errors in the first inning to help the Dodgers score a pair of un­earned runs off Danny Jackson. 
Jackson gave up four runs, two of them earned, on four hits in five innings and got the vic­tory. John Franco, who led the National League with 39 saves, pitched two hitless innings for a save. 
O'Neill went 4-for-4 to lead the Reds' comeback. He doubled to start a three-run rally in the second and hit a three-run homer in the third for a 6-2 lead against Tim Belcher, who lasted just 2 1-3 innings. 
The Dodgers never got closer than two runs despite more heroics by Kirk Gibson, their star in Game 1 of the World Se­ries last fall. Gibson got the first hit of the season, an RBI single in the first inning, and hit a solo home run in the fifth. 

Mets 8, Cardinals 4 
Howard Johnson homered and drove in three runs that led New York past the St. Louis Cardinals 8-4 Monday as the Mets won their 11th straight home opener. 
Overall, the Mets have won five consecutive season openers and 18 of their last 20 and have not lost an opening­day game at Shea Stadium since dropping an 11-10 deci­sion to Montreal on April 8, 1969. 
The Mets, who joined the Na­tional League in 1962, lost their first eight season openers before winning in Pittsburgh in 1970. 
The Cardinals played with­out All-Star shortstop Ozzie Smith, who has a strained muscle in his left side. 
Johnson, a part of many trade rumors during the winter, hit a two-run single during a four­run third inning that made it 6-3 against Joe Magrane. He hit a solo homer in the eighth off Todd Worrell.

Darryl Strawberry had three hits and two runs batted in for the Mets and Dwight Gooden pitched seven-plus innings for the victory to improve his opening-day record to 3-0. He allowed five hits and struck out eight. 
Orioles 5, Red Sox 4 
The Baltimore Orioles, losers of their first 21 games last year, won their season opener Mon­day, beating the American League East champion Boston Red Sox 5-4 on Craig Wor­thington's 11th-inning single. 
Boston's Roger Clemens was chased in the eighth inning. 
In the ninth, Baltimore put runners on first and third for Worthington, who grounded out. But the rookie came through in the 11th after Mickey Tettleton walked and took third on Randy Milligan's hit-and-run single. 
After Mike Smithson replaced Bob Stanley, Wor­thington flared a 1-0 pitch into left-center field past Ellis Burks' dive, foiling a Boston formation of five infielders. 
Brian Holton, acquired in an off-season trade that sent Eddie Murray to Los Angeles, pitched 4 1-3 scoreless innings for the victory. 
Indians 2, Brewers 1 
Oddibe McDowell doubled in two runs in his first game for Cleveland and Greg Swindell allowed five hits in 8 1-3 innings Monday as the Indians beat the Milwaukee Brewers 2-1. 
Swindell retired the first 12 batters he faced until Rob Deer and Glenn Braggs hit consecu­tive singles starting the fifth. Deer scored from third on Terry Francona's forceout. 
Swindell struck out six and walked none. Mike Felder reached on a bunt single to open the ninth and Gary Shef­field sacrificed. Doug Jones came in and got Robin Yount on a groundout and struck out Deer for the save. 
Blue Jays 4, Royals 3 
Jimmy Key won on opening 
day for the third straight year 
and Fred McGriff and Lloyd

ND track wins big at G'town 
Irish Outdoors will have a meeting today at 7:30p.m. 
in the Notre Dame Room of LaFortune. Plans for the April 
Irish take 11 of 16 events in unscored outdoor meet 
By KEN TYSIAC Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's track team enjoyed a strong showing Saturday, winning 11 out of 16 events in its unscored meet at Georgetown. The Irish over­came poor weather and a surprise decision by their hosts to outrun their Big East foes. 
Georgetown surprised Irish coach Joe Piane by deciding not to score the meet, which was held at Episcopal High School in Arlington, Virginia. Piane took the decision in stride. 
"They're the home team," said Piane. "If they don't want to score the meet, that's their prerogative." 
The meet was also run in very unfavorable weather con­ditions. 
"None of the times were very good--it was a pretty poor day for running," said Piane, "but that did not detract from our atheletes' ability to compete against our opponents." 
Indeed, the Irish competed very well against the highly re­garded Hoyas. The 4x100 meter relay team and the Mile relay team each nosed out their op­ponents by one tenth of a second, posting times of 0:43.8 and 3:19.6, respectively. 

The field athletes also out­scored their Georgetown foes. John Cole won the high jump with a leap of 6 feet, 6 inches while Greg Matteo cleared the 12-6 mark to win the pole vault. 
Freshman John Stewart threw the javelin 181 feet, four inches, over 26 feet further than his nearest competitor, team­mate Ron Regnery. The Irish also took first and second place in the shot put and the discus throw. 
Notre Dame added addi­tional first place finishes in the 110-and 400-meter hurdles. Glenn Watson, coming off knee surgery, won the 110 meters with a time of 15.0 seconds, while Pete Demeo captured the 400 meters in 55.6 seconds. 
"The hurdles are tough to run on a day like that because the wind throws you off balance as you jump over them," said Irish co-captain Ron Markezich. "Pete's running very well for us, and likewise we're pleased with what Glenn has been doing coming back from his operation." 
Markezich ran in the 5,000­meters event, in which Irish teammates Mike Drake and Rob Fern took first and second place, while he came in third. "For Ron it was just a workout," said coach Piane, "Whenever one of the other guys (Drake or Fern) fell back, Ron would move over into the second lane, shield the wind, and pick his teammate up again." 
Ron's team play paid off as the Irish swept the first three spots in the 5,000. "I tried to help those guys by blocking the wind," said Markezich, "It really helps the team to go one­two-three in a race like that." 
Coach Piane was pleased with his team's performance as they now look ahead to the Stanford Invitational, sched­uled for April 15. 
"It turned out to be a really good trip for us. We accom­plished a lot of things," said the 14th-year coach. 
SO club refuses to give up America's Cup 
Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO--The San Diego Yacht Club on Monday refused to surrender the America's Cup while contesting the court­ordered forfeiture of the trophy to defeated New Zealand chal­lenger Michael Fay. 
"We believe that we are so right and the decision was so wrong, not only for us but for the future of the Cup," said Patrick Goddard, San Diego Yacht Club commodore. 
"Our decision to appeal was not an easy one and was reached with care and deliber­ation," Goddard said. "Going to court is not our preference. For over 100 years we have been sailors and competitors, and we believe that yacht races should be decided on the water." 

The appeals process could take about a year, leaving adrift the fate of the next Cup race. 
The filing with the appellate division of the New York Su­preme Court will ask that it overturn last week's decision by New York State Supreme Court Justice Carmen Ciparick that disqualified the club's use of a catamaran against New Zealand's monohull. 
Goddard said more was at issue than the potential loss of a $1.2 billion economic windfall the San Diego region expecte~ to realize from staging a full­fledged regatta in 1991.

He said "the pride and dig­nity" of the yacht club also was on the line. 
Fay's challenge, which upset San Diego's plan for a 1991 mul­tinational race and spawned
the continuing series of legal skirmishes, was launched un­der the banner of the Mercury 
Bay Boating Club. Dennis Conner skippered the SDYC's 60-foot catamaran, Stars & Stripes, to an easy sweep of Fay's 133-foot, single-
hulled sloop.
