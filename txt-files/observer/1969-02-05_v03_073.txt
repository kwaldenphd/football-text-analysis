SLC hears Ellerby Report 
The Student Ufe Counl-il met Monday, February 3 to discuss a preliminary summary of the forthcoming Ellerbe Report on student housing. Father Jerome Wilson, CSC, Vice-President for Business Affairs, presented the summary which deals with alleviating present overcrowding and inadequate facilities in the dormitories. 
Only thirteen dorms were cited in the summary. Stanford, Keenan, lloly Cross, Carroll, Fisher, and Pangborn were omitted because the problems of overcrowding and renovation of these dorms did not warrant 
-' •MAN SV IT£ 
action, although Father Wilson described Carroll Hall as "substandard". 
According to the summary, there will he four quads, 223 four-man suites, 128 three-man suites, 59 triples, 399 doubles, and 491 singles for a total of 2757 beds. The homeless caused by this expansion plus a number of off-campus students will be housed in the two new high-rise dorms. (One hundred sixty-nine students, however, will be forced back into the thirteen dorms, breaking up some of the suites and reinstating some forced triples and doubles, since the new dorms will not absorb all of the present overcrowding. 
Some parlors, lounges, study rooms, women's toilets, and maintenance rooms will also be added at a loss of about 50 beds. 
The net gain from all this renovation will he about 317 beds. 
Criteria for the number of 
people in a room will depend on floor footage. 88 sq. ft. per person has been set as an average. (The same size as the singles in Fisher.) This would make a double room 176 sq. ft., a triple would be 264 sq. ft., a quad would be 352 sq. ft. a three-man suite would be 264 sq. ft., and a four-man suite would be 352 sq. ft. 
Four-man suites would be made from either three small doubles in a row or from two doubles and a single in a row. The two outside rooms would be bedrooms, leaving the middle room as a lounge with doors entering on it from the bedrooms. 
Three-man suites would be made from two rooms side by side (provided there be a floor area of at least 250 sq. ft.) with a connecting door. One room would be used as both lounge and bedroom. The bed provided for this room will be a special day bed. 
All suites would be provided with new furniture for the lounges. 
All this, however, is still in its preliminary stage. Father Wilson hopes that plans will be formalized so that construction can be started by 1une and finished by September. 
The rest of the scheduled agenda, a report on Hall Life including consideration of alcoholic beverages and parietal hours, wasn't covered. In addition, the type of door to be utilized came under close scrutiny. The members were split betw"en hinged, sliding, swinging, and accordian-style doors. 
A I most all the discussion folliwing Father Wilson's presentation concerned whether or not to put doors between the rooms in the suites. 
On this note, the meeting was adjourned. The next meeting, due to the immediacy of the Hall Life Report, will be Tuesday, February II.

Theology reform 
Rev. James Burtchaell, C.S.C., chairman of Notre Dame's Theology department, announced yesterday "an entirely new undergraduate service curriculum" slated to begin next September. It will replace the current curriculum offered to undergraduates who must fulfill the University Theology requirements, but who are not theology majors. 
In a written outline of the revision, Burtchaell says that the present sequence is arranged in a series of four survey courses "which extend schematically over the total range of theology," and that there are three major drawbacks to such a system: 
1) Because very little new material is covered, students quickly become bored. "It would seem better that the courses offer a progressive penetration and intensification, rather than a prolonged and superficial survey," says the outline. 
2) The curriculum has often been accused of being "keep-your-faith" theology. The new sequence will not be aimed at indoctrination in the Catholic faith, but will "criticize and speculate within the faith traomon" in order to be of greater value to all students, regardless of whether or not they are Catholic. 
3) "The survey course arrangement does not tend to draw into it those highly valued teachers whose main contribution is in graduate courses," says the outline. "Yet the Department is really committed to service of the undergraduates; it is wrong to with hold some of its best professors from them." 
The first year of the curriculum will consist of a "content-centered course" examining the development of belief through a period in the history of the Church. 
"The innovation here," commented Burtchaell, "is that most freshman theology courses are a continuation of the ones the student had in high school: they are either a force-feeng of materials which students consider to be 'irrelevant' or they are a seminar in the they are either a force-feeding of materials which students consider to be 'irrelevant' or they are a seminar in the let's-talk-about-what-we­care-about vein, both of which reinforce the concept of religion

Rigney fired from cabinet post 
Student Body President Richard Rossie last week fired his Judicial Coordinator, Robert Rigney, after Rigney refused to resign. 
In discussing his action, Rossie said: "A cabinet should be composed of people who can be trusted to do a certain job. I did not trust Mr. Rigney. His handling of the job had not been up to par." 
According to Rigney, he was fired because he opposed the llunter-Davis bill. This bill gives the Student Body President the power to appoint the Student Union President. According to Rigney, Rossie told him beforehand that if he opposed t he biII, this would be considered a sign that he no longer wanted to be part of the Rossie Administration; his vote against the bill would be considered his resignation. Rigney said that he did not consider it his resignation. 
"I voted on my conviction that the students got a raw deal from the bill," said Rigney. "I'd do it again. I don't think it was a tactic of disloyalty." 

Rossie acknowledged that he told Rigney that his vote would mean his resignation. But he denies that this was a major reason for removing Rigney. Rossie said: "The vote was the culmination of a long line of events. Mr. Rigney would like to believe it's the issue because he wants to be a martyr." 
In citing other reasons for firing Rigney, Rossie said that Rigney had taken certain actions behind his back. He said that these were of a personal nature and he declined to discuss them. 
Rossie also said that Rigney was to have had a seminar training people to defend accused students. According to Rigney, he had contacted Mr. Philip Facenda, special assistant to Fr. Hesburgh, and several law students in preparation for this. According to Rossie, Mr. Facenda told him that the seminar was waiting on Rigney. 
As Judicial Coordinator, Rigney was on the Legal Aid Committee which was to have educated the students on the workings of the school judicial system. Rigney, noting articles in TIIH OBSHR VHR and a flyer sent to the students, contended that this was done. Rossie countered, "Ask the average student how much he knows about the Judicial Board." 

Rossie also noted that Rigney is in charge of the Senate Constitutional Committee which has not met once. Rigney said that the "committee has never met purposely." He said that he spent time before Christmas researching other constitutions. 
and that he has found one on 
which  he  would  like  to  base  
revision  of  the  Notre  Dame  
constitution.

The steering committee of the rebel students participating in the sit-in at the University of Chicago's Administration Building revealed yesterday that it was "actively" seeking formal negotiations with the university administration on all the protest­ing students' demands. 
The demonstrating students arc presenting four of those "non-negotiable" demands. The first demand concerns the re­hiring of Mrs. Marlene Dixon, a con t r ovcrsial sociological professor. The second demand would give the students an equal voice in the hiring of faculty members. The third demand would grant amnesty for all the students who participate in the sit-in or any phase of the pro­test. The fourth demand con­cerns recompensing all Univer­sity employees for wages lost during the duration of the strike. 
The striking students arc presenting ttirec "negotiable" demands. The first demand is the result of the Womens Rad­
demands that 51% of the faculty the administration hires and 51% of the students the administra­tion accepts are women. The second demand asks that a pres­sing study be made of discrim­ination against women, blacks, and the working class by the ad ministration. T h c t h ird demand concerns the opening of university files to the public. 
A spokesman for the sit-in group said negotiations imply compromise but insisted the pro­testers' four basic demancl,s rem a in "non-negotiable." Former Notre Dame radical Lenny Joyce is participating peacefully in the demonstration. (See picture page I). 
The Committee of 85 claimed that Mrs. Dixon was not re-hired for these reasons. First, she is a woman. Second, she has not published the required amount of scholarly work and she is a victim of the "publish or perish" philosophy prevalent on many college campuses. Third, she is a radical, a member of the New 
wide group of young radical 
faculty members. 
Mrs. Dixon defended herself 
on the point about not having 
published the required amount 
by saying, "I have several papers 
in progress which an:. about to 

be published in magazines. I have also written a book, Pro­fessions in Crises, which will be published shortly." Mrs. Dixon has not made any public state­ment of her feelings about the sit-in except to say that the students should have more of a voice in their education. 
The Sociology department issued a statement which read in part, "The function of the university teacher is to make accessible to students the problems and limitations of inquiry in the discipline. These issues are known only to those who actively and ably engage in scholarship....There are a variety of ways for the teacher to demonstrate intellectual qual­ities, but the best is in writing." 
The university administration

testors. A university spokesman said officials were aware of the students' bid for talks and had "no comment at this time." Meanwhile, the students reiter­ated their vow to continue to occupt the administration build­ing until the administration grants concessions to their demands. 
The University of Chicago's student newspaper, The Maroon, printed an unacknowledged editorial asking students to vacate the building. The editorial approved of the administration's threat of and use of suspension to stop the escalation of the students' demands and power base. It stated that the sit-in can end peacefully only if Mrs. Dixon is rehired and the protest­ors are granted amnesty ("very 
quietly," if need be). It was made clear that this was not the official position of all the editors nor necessarily the over-all view of the editorial board.

Ginsberg and pornography arr1ve today 

Tonight at 8:00pm with Poet Allan Ginsberg's appearance in Washington Hall, SUAC's much heralded Pornography and Censorship Conference will begin its five-day spree of lectures, art exhibits and film and stage productions. The Conference will attract close to 1500 delegates and will be highlighted by such personages as poet Gerard Malansa, Citizens for Decent Literature Executive Secretary Raymond Gauer and the anti-Establishment rock group, The Fugs. 
Although Ginsberg is still hobbled by injuries received in a Thanksgiving car crash, this is not expected to cramp his flamboyant, tell-it-like-it-is style of lecture. 
Also beginning today and continuing for the remainder of the conference in the Main Ballroom, Second Floor LaFortune Student Center is the Erotic Art Exhibit featuring original pieces by a number of contemporary artists including Claes Oldenberg, Bob Stanley and Ed Ruscha. 

In store for later on in the conference is Sunday's symposium on the legality of pornography, a lecture by Elmer Gertz, the defense attorney for Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer, poetry readings by Gerard Malanga Sunday evening and a variety of controversial films, both underground and commercial productions. 
Paul Krassner, the founder of the underground newspaper The Realist, will be on hand, as well as Richard McGuiness, the film critic for The Village Voice, to present and comment on these films. Films scheduled for viewing include two by Andy Warhol: Couch and Mairo Banana and films by Jack Smith, Andrew Noren and the Kuchar Brothers. The Citizens for Decent Literature will also show a film. Their cinematic offering, however, is a documentary analyzing Supreme Court decisions regarding obscenity. 
Of particular interest should be the special performances by New York's Theater of the Ridiculous Thursday and Friday evening in Washington Hall. This troupe, with its cast of 18, will present the controversial play,_ Lady Godiva, which finished a year-long run Off-Broadway. In

as condemnatory." "What students consider to be 'relevant' is very often a narrow band of morality dealing with the Bomb, or the Pill, or perhaps racial prejudice," he continued. "Discussions like this are good, but they should not occupy an entire semester." Sophomore year will be a 
seminar  with  all  sections  
concentrating  on  a  single  
pro b I em,  such  as  evil,  the  

consciousness of Christ, or the Eucharist. Fr. Burtchaell said that the success of the first year will determine the success of this course. If the student has learned to stop brooding on his own problems, he will be able to deal with discussions at this higher level. 
The last two years will consist of "speciality courses" by individual professors offering courses of their choosing. Courses here will deal with theology and morality as seen from other disciplines. Burtchaell said that courses here might be team-taught by two professors, such as one from Theology and one from English. 
Completing the reorganized undergraduate theology program is a revitalized major sequence. Beginning in September, there will be only two strictly required courses for the major. These will be on Holy Scripture and 
Development of Christian 
History. 
Dr. William Storey, who will 
be teaching the Christian History 
course, said that it will consist of 
three one-hour lectures and a 
two-hour seminar. 
"The idea of this is to attempt 
to combine lecture with a 
directed discussion of the 
reading material," said Dr. 
Storey. "In this manner we hope 
to bypass the perennial problems 
of a survey like this." 
Seniors will be required to 
take three electives in the 
department, and three outside. 
Storey said that it was the hope 
of the faculty that the outside 
courses would be in literature or 
history, "although this is 
completely up to the students." 
"We are trying to make theology a major that is not only for those who wish to be priests or who may wish to teach it. It should be a liberal arts major rather than a pre-professional training course." 
"We expect, and we hope for a lot of reaction to our new approach,'' said Fr. Burtchaell. "This will enable us to remain sensitive to new ideas, since once something is around for a few years without this type of sensitivity, it assumes the strength of the status quo; it's the way things are and rather hard to change."

Nixon and the draft 
During the campaign Richard Nixon proposed the creation of a volunteer armed force as the alternative to the current draft system. There can be no doubt that the present draft system is full of both fundamental and derivative inequities. These have been the source of great tension which, if it persists, could undermine America as much as the war in Vietnam. 
The problems of volunteer army are great. It would radically resturcture the psychology behind the army, and it would require enormous amounts of time and money to establish. And, finally, could it supply America's manpower needs? Over the past seven years, the number of men in arms has reached a new post-WWII high of 
3.5 million. It is pointless to talk about paying the volunteers enough; there is no way 3.5 million men would volunteer, even in time of peace. (Remember that this is technically time of peace.) 
Clearly the question to be faced is how 

SLC muddles 
The Student Life Council during its first semester of existence has uncovered a problem which must be decided immediately to insure the success of the board. The dining hall committee report recommended that the Council establish a commission comprised of students and administration officials who are not members of the SLC to determine policy for the dining halls. 
The problem, for some of the board 

members, is whether the Council can 
assume the power to establish bodies 
outside of itself. Originally the Council was 
created with full jurisdiction over all 
student affairs, subject to a veto by 
University President Father Hesburgh. 
Taking the board's creators at their word, 
we suggest that the Council does indeed 
have power to establish such a dining hall 
commission, and that if it hopes to be more 
than a mere advisory board it had better 
assume those powers. 
The Council has now been in operation for one semester and the only truly concrete result of the board's efforts has been the granting or permission to 
can the num her of men in the army be reduced. If the Presidential Commission can, through a review of our military commitments systematically tighten them then a volunteer army would becom~ feasible. What must most certainly be changed is the attitude of the administra­tion. The Army must not be viewed (as it now is) as a limitless pool of young men that can be drawn upon at will. The notion of military service as doing one's time for his nation won't work. Army service is service to the goals of men of distinctly limited vision. 
If Richard Nixon can somehow achieve a more equitable national service system, then he will have made a genuine step toward his avowed goal of bringing all of America closer to his administration. Nixon has said he is interested in the forgotten man in all parb of society. There is no more forgotten man than the draftee. 
on-campus first semester seniors to have cars. We suggest that while ,hall life and dining hall problems cannot be solved overnight, the Council should show the students concrete action as quickly as possible to reaffirm the students' faith in the Council. 
It has been our observation that the Council spends valuable time in sometimes pointless discussion, last Tuesday's meeting furnishing a good example. The discussion centered around whether the students would approve the idea of knocking doors in walls in all residence halls to form three­and four-room suites. The renovation involves the expenditure of some $200,000. The Council was fearful of spending the money when the students may not be satisfied with the result. A suggestion that a survey of the students be taken on the problem was somehow lost in the shuffle. 
We finally urge that the Student Life Council assume the power available to it by right, use that power to the utmost, not waste time on trivialities, and finally to demonstrate that it is an active and workable commission through action.

Win over all

It's been said that Notre Dame admissions officials fear national 
championship football seasons because the number of applications 
swells in direct proportion to the number of victories on the gridiron 
the previous season. Not very funny when you think about it. 
It's undeniably true that Notre Dame became famous through its 
football teams and even now give a word association test to most 
people and they respond "football" when posed with the words 
"Notre Dame." And now with the completion of the Athletic and 
Convocation Center there was an immediate need for a basketball 
•team worthy of its home court. So we got one. For the first time Notre Dame put its heart into basketball recruiting. 
The question naturally arises: Why collegiate athletics? The 
answer is simple enough-profit. Football, specifically, and sports, in 
general, are extremely popular and young men 18 to 22 are nearing 
the peak athletic years of their lives-bingo! Instant green. 
Take football. The better your team, the more people want to 
watch you, and the more money you make. So you recruit. You pass 
unlimited substitution so your boys can become more proficient at 
one position. You raise the number of scholarships. Your boys spend 
more time on the field and in front of the chalkboard so they 
understand what they are doing. Finally it becomes a question of 
whether you want to have student-athletes or whether you want to 
win. To win means to profit. Is there any question? 
The point is, only in rare cases can a young man be a serious student and a serious athlete. When a college hires an athlete his schedule is specially arranged, his tests specially scheduled, and his grades specially given. The old argument is always that athletics enables a boy who would not ordinarily receive a college education to have one. Baby, he still doesn't get one! A football player spends the entire first semester practicing, watching films, attending meet­ings and travelling. Then there's spring practice. Basketball players lose two semesters, practice begins in October and tournaments conclude in March. An athlete in a major sport barely has enough time to make class. 
You need money to run a university so you hire 50 or 100 men to play football under the pretense of attending school. But you make money for the university-the greater good. Multiply 60,000 people times six games times $7.00 a crack. The catch is, the Alabamas, the UCLAs, but especially the lesser powers, the Tulanes, the Pittsburghs, the Northwesterns are looking at smaller profit margins each year. Expenses begin to eat away your profits. Tear-away jersies, tartan turfs, recruiting, travelling, 12-man coaching staffs. 
Hopefully the disease will cure itself, choke itself to death. Then perha~s athletics will slide back into its proper perspective, like wrestlmg or golf. But you can bet that it'll be a clear day in South Bend before Notre Dame is in any kind of that danger. 
So better stock up on those season tickets because the chalk is on the astroturf. Then maybe universities will be for education and athletics for the ~ke of sport. Maybe Dan Jenkins was right, maybe Notre Dame wont win over all.

It was at this time that the decision was made to publish TilE OESER VER on a daily basis starting in the Fall. Many were skeptical. They said it couldn't be done. But with the addition of a 24 hour UPI wire service and with an heroic effort by a handful of students THE OBSERVER has today published its 73rd issue of the year. In the short space of two and a half years this newspaper has risen to a position of influence and responsibility in this com­munity. 
But we're far from ready to pat ourselves on the back. No one is more aware of the shortcomings of TilE OBSERVER than those of us who publish it. We've come a long way and we've got a much longer way to go before we will be satisfied with our efforts. And here is where you might just be able to help THE OBSERVER. 
On March 3, 1963, the VOICE of Notre Dame made its initial appearance. It wasn't much to look at -a one page mimeo­graphed sheet often smudged and never free of errors -but raw as it was it was the Notre Dame student's first attempt at free journalism. It published for a bit more than three years, coming out once a week. But inevitably the burdens of old news and debt crept up on the VOICE, slowly strang­ling it. Finally, on Thursday, October 27, 1966 the VOICE of Notre Dame fell silent. 
One week later, a new paper appeared on campus with a flashy masthead which read quite simply THE OBSERVER. While only eleven issues were published during the remainder of that year, THE OBSERVER flourished. It was controversial, it was rele­vant, and more importantly -it was read. Last year THE OESER VER published over 70 issues. When Bill Luking took over the controls last spring it had become apparent to everyone at Notre Dame that THE OESER VER was here to stay.

Pears admitted that aside from the eyewitness and the other people who were on the

Noting that so far only one of these ten people who were present at the scene of the crime have volunteered to help the campus police, Pears said, "It is quite evident that some students are protecting this type of person. Sometimes they are doing him more harm than good." 

According to Pears, if the rectors and the damages an individual suffers are often settled by his insurance company without going through the Security office. He said if complete figures were available, a modus operandi of the vandals would probably emerge.

Notre Dame Multi-phasic Evaluation Inventory: 
by BILL THIEMAN 

In the wake of reaction to some of my recent columns, particularly the musical review of 1968 (Observer, Jan. I 0, 1969), I have contracted a complex that my tastes in music do not conform with those of many of my fellow students. Therefore, I have devised the following Notre Dame Multiphasic ­Music Evaluation Inventory (NDMMEI), which I hope will help crystallize the musical opinion at Notre Dame, so that I will be able to judge the standards to which my future columns will not be conforming. 
The following question evaluates the testee's interests in music; please consider each answer carefully (use only pen, pencil, or if you must, number two (2) lead pencil): 
My favorite type of music is .. , ... , . , , , .. , , ........ , •...•...................... (please choose only one}.

The following questions are intended to make the test "interesting" and will be evaluated by our staff in order to determine the personality struct­ure of the tcstees: 

Who recorded "Does Your Chewing Gum lose Its Flavor?

What is Archie Bell and the Drell's home town? ....•.. What label does Chuck Berry record on?, .. , .••.••... Who is the vocalist with Canned Heat? ......•..••...

Please complete all the questions in the NDMMEI (the results of which will be analyzed in a forthcoming Observer) and them pursue either of the following courses:

N D semester break sports round-up 
By MIKE PAVLIN 
Observer Sports Writer 
Basketball 

Illinois 91, ND 57 
It was supposed to be a gala doubleheader at Chicago on Saturday night, Jan. 25, with UCLA un the bill, but Notre Dame spoiled everything by showing up. The Irish shot 21-68-31% from the floor, 15-27-56% from the line, were out-rebounded 69-41, committed 28 turnovers, and generally disappointed rooters among the 18,000 people at Chicago Stadium. Captain Bob Arnzen was a lamp in the darkness, scoring 20 points. 
ND 71, Georgia Tech 52 
Things were different Thursday night, Jan. 30, as the Irish rebounded against the cold-shooting Yellowjackets. Tom Sinnott sparked NO to a quick lead with three buckets and Bob Arnzen pumped in 13 first-half points. The Irish led 33-20 at intermission. Arnzen finished with 25 markers, while Bob Whitmore added 18. NO also got a fine defensive performance from Sid Catlett. 
Houston 89, ND 82 The University of Houston remained unbeaten in the Astrodome by drubbing the Irish on Feb. I in front of 15,038 fans. Forward Ollie Taylor did the damage for the Cougars. Taylor is only 6'-2", but when he jumps, he threatens to beat the U.S. to the moon. He scored 29 points, 17 in the first half when Houston ran up a 42-34 lead. Superb performances by unheralded guards Tom Gribben 
( 17) and Billy Bane ( 12) helped the Cougars, who shot 51% from the field. Notre Dame tried to beat Houston with a man-on-man defense that simply didn't work against a Cougar offense which used simple "give-and-go" plays with devastating efficiency. Bob Whitmore led the Irish with 21 points, while Bob Arnzen and Dwight Murphy contributed 15 apiece. Notre Dame's record dropped to 13-4, but Austin Carr may play next Saturday against Detroit. 
Riflery 
Notre Dame's Army ROTC riflery quintet placed second in the fifth United States Army Meet. Twenty-five midwest ROTC units competed. Scores were registered on respective campuses and mailed to headquarters. 
Notre Dame's team score was 1,657, well off the first-place pace set by Missouri-1,780. Irish scores: Frank Liebncr 334, Jim Pratt 332, Vince Ronay 331, Tom Kearns 330, Jim Ersfeld 330. 
Football 

Notre Dame supplied eleven players, the most of any college, in the combined NFL-AFL football draft. Tackle George K unz was the second man picked, after USC's O.J. Simpson, going to the Atlanta Falcons. Jim Seymour also went on the first round, selected by the Los Angeles Rams. Terry Hanratty was by-passed on the first round (two other quarterbacks, Greg Cook and Marty Domres, were picked) before being nabbed by the Pittsburg Steelers on the ~econd. Other Irishmen to go were: Bob Keuchenburg-4th round-Philadelphia; Jim Winegardner-5th-Chicago; Ed Tuch-6th-Miami; Bob G!adieux-8th-Boston; Eric Norri-llth-Washington; John Lavin--l2th-Kansas City; Tom Quinn-12th-Chicago; and Bob 
Belden-12th-Dallas. 
Ara Parseghian has named his new freshman football coach to replace the promoted Wally Moore. He's Mike Stock, an assistant coach at Navy who played under Ara at Northwestern. Parseghiar: also named Dennis Murphy, 1 grad student-part time assistant for

the Irish last year as the assistant coach. 
At Northwestern in 1959-60, Stock was co-captain, all-Big Ten fullback, and academic All-America. In 1960, he was NU's athlete of the year. Murphy won three letters at Notre Dame as an end in 1960-62. He returns to his home town of South Bend after a four year-plus hitch in the Navy. 
Swimming 

NO beat Wayne State and Cleveland State in a triangular meet on Friday, Jan. 17. Freshman Frank Fahey, Jr. broke the Irish record in ~i1c 200-yard butterfly with a time of2:11.4. 
Friday night Jan. 31, Fahey broke that record with a 2:09.3 clocking as the Irish whipped Western Ontario 70-34. :-.JD captured eight of the individual events. 
John Cox won the one-and three-meter diving events to lead Notre Dame over St. Bonaventure 65-47 on Feb. I. Five other Irishmen won individual events as NO hiked its season mark to 4-0. 
The swimmers finished up their eastern swing with a 77-28 squashing of the University of Buffalo last Monday. The Irish won all but one of the events. 
Fencing 

Heavy scoring in the epee and foil enabled the Irish fencers to dump Wayne St. 16-11 on Friday, Jan. 17. Joe DePietro (epee) and Bob Babineau (foil) swept all three of their matches. 
The following day, Notre Dame routed Oberlin 20-7 and Cleveland State 22-5 in a triangular meet. Bob Babineau upped his season record in the foil to 9-0, while sophomores Hugh DePaolo (5-l), Glenn Kalin (5-0), a1.d John Lyons (5-0) provided crucial support. 
Saturday, Feb. I, Notre Dame hosted a quadrangular meet in the Convo Center. The Irish defeated Tri-State 21-6, Iowa 18-9, and the University of Illinois Chicago Circle 19-8, for their fifth, sixth, and seventh, victories of the season. Doug Daher was 6-0 in the sabre. Other individual stars were: in the sabre Rogar Holzgrefe 5-l, Mike Feeny 4-0; in the foil Bob Babineau 4-1, Charles Ferrall 4-1, Glenn Kalin 3-0; in the epee Joe DePietro 4-0. 
Wrestling 
Pat Mudron, who works for Ara Parseghian during the fall, helped out the ND grapplers with a pin in the heavyweight division as the Irish defeated John Carroll of Cleveland I 9-12. Strong work by JC in the middle divisions put the match in jeopardy before Bill Hasbrook's 
( 177) decision and Mudron's pin decided the score. Other Irish winners were Tom Ciaccio (I 23), Keith Giron ( 130), and Ken Ryan (145). 
Hockey 
ND 5, St. John's 4 
The Irish icers opened a four-game weekend Friday night, Jan. 17, by edging the visitors from Collegeville, Minnesota. Notre Dame jumped to a 4-1 lead in the first period on two goals by Phil Wittliff, but St. John's twice fought back to within one marker. Mike Gearcn 


Illinois' center Dave Scholz wrecked the Irish cagers with 26 points and 15 rebounds. 
provided the winner at 0:39 of the third period. Dick Tomasoni kicked away 21 shots. 
ND 6, St. John's I 
Paul O'Neil notched two goals and an assist while Mike Collins added three assists to pace Notre Dame. O'Neil's seventh and eighth goals of the year boosted the Irish into a 4-l second period lead. Dick Tomasoni was near perfect in the nets, stopping 25-26 shots. 
ND 7, St. Thomas I 
Sunday night another Minnesota school, St. Thomas, moved in for a two-game set. Joe Bonk, Phil Wittliff and John Womack scored two goals apiece as the Irish peppered the Tommies with 51 shots. Dick Tomasoni barely missed a shut-out for the second night in a row. He made 27 saves, allowing only a second period goal by Tony Ryan. 
ND 3, St. Thomas 2 
Bruce Britton forced a goal past Tommie goalie Bill St. Marie to give the Irish a tough overtime victory. The goal came after only 30 seconds of the ten-minute overtime period. Kevin Hoene and Phil Wittliff gave Notre Dame a 2-0 lead in the first period, but J oc Ernster knotted the score at 10:07 of the second. 
Wisconsin 10, ND 2 The classy Badgers stopped the Irish unbeaten string at thirteen with a tremendous display of stickhandling, passing 
and shooting. Notre Dame scored first on a goal by Eric Norri and left the ice at the end of the first period tied at l-1. But Wisconsin scored five times in the nightmare second period. Uick Tomasoni was brilliant in spots but couldn't hold off the swarming Badger offense. He fielded 56-66 shots. Bert DeHate and Jim Boyd "hat-tricked" for the winners. 
Wisconsin 12, ND 0 The following night, Jan. 31, was even worse for Dick Tomasoni and the Irish. The Badgers pasted Tomasoni with 70 shots, 33 in the opening twenty minutes, and 27 in the second.
