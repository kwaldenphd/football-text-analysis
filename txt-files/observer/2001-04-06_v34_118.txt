recreates great American authors" h i g h e r page 6 learning in the 1940s and 1950s, and many scholars were skeptical of them. But they were the pillars on which the Program of Liberal Studies 
[PLS] were built. 
Fifty years later, as PLS cel­ebrates is silver anniversary. the Program is still strong, and much of academia has come to share its emphasis on reading and discussion, at least at some level. 
But PLS is still unique. 
"It was. and still is, differ­ent." said F. Clark Power, chair of the Program. It is dif­ferent in that its students learn philosophy and psychol­ogy, mathematics and litera­ture, all by reading, and dis­cussing, original texts about the subjects in a rigorous series of courses stretching over three years. 
From the beginning. PLS 
has been focused on reading 
and discussion, and, today, 
that style of teaching may not 
seem unusual. But in 1950, 
when Father John 
Cavanaugh, who was then 
University president, and pro­
fessor Otto Bird collaborated 
to found the Program, it was 
unusual indeed. 
It was a time when lectures reigned supreme in the acad­emy. Professors stood before a podium and unloaded on a captive audience their accu­mulated knowledge on their subject of mastery. Undergraduates supplement­ed these lectures with read­ings from a textbook written by their professor. or some­one like him, who had read and understood the great texts at the heart of his sub­ject, and who was passing that understanding along in digestible form. There was little exposure to the great texts themselves, and even less discussion of them. 
This began to change, on a small scale, in the 1930s. That was when a handful of humanities professors at pro­gressive schools like Columbia University and the University of Chicago, started having their students read some of the classic texts and discuss them in seminar classes. Their classes focused on the Great Books, timeless works of unparalleled wis­dom and significance. like Plato's "Republic" and James Joyce's "Ulysses." An educa­tion built around the reading and discussion of Great 



The Great Books move­ment came to Notre Dame in 1949, when then-president Cavanaugh invited Bird, a Great Books scholar, to the University to start a General Program of Liberal Studies. When it opened in 1950, the Program demanded four years and required the study of several languages and a host of academic fields. It also demanded a high facul­ty-to-student ratio and the

Right to Life conference returns to ND, SMC campuses 
By ANDREW THAGARD 
News Writer 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's Right to Life clubs are gearing up for their second annual Pro-Life Collegiate Conference, "Our Duty to Serve, Our Call to Lead," to take place this weekend. 
The theme of this year's conference, identical to last year's, explores the dual­concept of being opposed to abortion. 
"Being pro-life is actually a type of ser­vice. You're serving people who are unable to serve themselves ... who have no voice," said Mario Suarez, the co-president of Notre Dame Right to Life and one of the conference coordinators. "In service, there has to be people who point others in the right direction." 
The coordinators hope to "point others in the right direction" over the weekend through a series of workshops. lectures and opportunities for members of different pro-life organizations to share ideas. Suarez characterized the weekend as a big brainstorming session between pro-life clubs. 

"This conference is actually a lot differ­ent from last year's. We had seven keynote speakers and a few workshops [then]." Suarez said. "The students really wanted to come and share their ideas and learn. We've restructured the whole thing." 
This year's conference promises to be more "hands on," featuring six workshop sessions. The sessions, meant to educate other organizations on how to run a suc­cessful club. focus on issues like motiva­tion, management skills and first amend­ment rights. The workshops and moderat­ed discussions are run by members of the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's clubs, as well as prominent members from the national pro-life community. 
The conference, however. is not limited to thc..,e wanting to become leaders within the pro-life movement. 
"Even if you have no interest in assum­ing leadership, you'll learn a lot and have some fun," Suarez said. "I think that abor­tion is an issue that everyone has an opin­ion on." 
In addition to workshops, the conference features two keynote speakers. Steve Mosher. president of the Population Research Institute, will deliver a speech on "Life Issues Around the World." His lecture will focus on human rights abuses in third world nations with a pro-life prospective. 
Cathy Cleaver, the director of Information and Planning for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops Secretariat, will speak on "How to Communicate the Pro-Life message." Her speech will deal with outsiders' perceptions of the pro-life movement and offer suggestions on how to discuss abortions issues with minimal con­llict. 
Initially. the conference was to feature a speech by Alan Keyes. a politician who ran in the Hepublican primaries. Keyes' office, 
however, cancelled his appearance last Friday because ofa schedule conflict. 
"I know [Keyes' absence] will disappoint many, and we apologize for this.... Alan Keyes is a phenomenal speaker and will be missed, but now we can have more dia­logue among students, and better focus on developing leadership skills and learning how to use our gifts to make a difference," Suarez announced in an e-mail to students registered for the conference. 
The club plans to fill his speaking time with two student speeches. 
The club expects attendance similar to last year's event, which drew 150 people from 15 colleges and universities -some from as far as California and Texas. Organizers began planning this year's con­ference a month before winter break, mainly under the direction of Suarez and Kaitlyn Dudley. Although ofTicial registra­tion ended on March 30. Suarez said they will admit students until seating capacity has been reached.

Celebrate our champions 
Well, Irish fans, we have a lot to learn about sup­porting our teams. We need to take lessons from schools like Purdue, Maryland, Arizona, Penn State -and the school with the most spirit in the country -Michigan State. 
We are certainly amateurs when it comes to supporting our teams in victory and defeat. Just think about last Sunday, our women's basket­ball team wins the national championship and what do we do? We assemble at Main Circle at 2:30 a.m. and cheer when the victorious Irish get 

off the bus. You actually think Mike Connolly that thousands ofpeople cheering is the proper way to support a champion? 
Hardly. Just ask Purdue Editor in Chief freshman Jim Bartela. Even though the Boilermakers lost the title game, Purdue stu­dents welcomed their team back with broken win­dows, fires and overturned cars. 
"Even though there's destruction of the town, it's a great way to get people together, to help celebrate the basketball team," Bartela told the Purdue Exponent. 
Iwould like to personally apologize to Ruth Riley, Niele Ivey and the rest ofthe team for not properly celebrating their championship. I thought attending nearly all of their home games for the last three years and meeting them at Main Circle was enough. I was wrong. I really should have done something to get myself arrested. 
Because nothing says National Champs like a bunch ofdrunken idiots trashing the campus and getting tear gassed by police. 
Just ask Michigan State. The Spartans know how to celebrate a champion. Last year after their men's team won the title, the fans caused thousands ofdol­lars in damage and more than 100 were arrested. 
Some might question ifriots are the proper way to celebrate a championship. Some might say it's class­less and shameful to burn cars, attack police and destroy property. But how can you doubt that Penn State students weren't making their school proud when they smashed windows, tore down signs and light posts after the Nittany Lions' loss to the Temple Owls in the NCAA tournament? 
In fact, I believe Irish fans were disgraceful when they refused to destroy anything after Ole Miss knocked Notre Dame men's team out of March Madness. 
But fear not Irish fans. We can redeem ourselves. Our spring teams are playing really well. The men's lacrosse, women's tennis and baseball teams are all ranked in the top 10. This weekend, every time Tom Glatzel scores a goal against Denver, smash a win­dow in DeBartolo. For every Michelle Dasso ace, flip a car in D6. And when Aaron Heilman throws another fireball past a bewildered batter, burn downadonn. 
We need to celebrate our athletes accomplish­ments. 
Troy Murphy may jump to the NBA draft. Do you think that ifa couple hundred rioting Irish fans had gotten tear gassed by ND security/police, Murphy would even be considering the NBA? Of course not 
Purdue students like Eric Forbes are making sac­rifices for their teams, we should too. 'The tear gas burns your eyes and your throat. It really sucks," the Boilermaker said. 
The tear gas may be painful but thanks to fans like Forbes, no one will ever question the class of Purdue fans.

Seniors invite Doonesbury cartoonist April 5, 1977 
The graduating class picked Pulitzer Prize-winning car­toonist, Garry B. Trudeau for the Senior Class Fellow invitation and he gladly accepted. Especially important was the cartoonist's appeal to college students and the emphasis that he gave to social and controversial prob­lems in Doonesbury. That year, he addressed the entire class during Senior Week celebrations.

Uof Maffirmative action ruling could see high court 
LOS ANGELES 

On March 29, a federal judge halted the use of affirmative action at the University ofMichigan's law school. 
The university plans to take the case to the Supreme Court. and if it suc­ceeds, the decision could determine the fate of afl1rmative action in admissions nationwide. 
"I think it's unfortunate that the University of Michigan will have to deal with the constraints that we're all too familiar with here in California," said Leo Trujillo-Cox, executive director of the Outreach Resource Center at the UCIA School of Law. 
"If the Supreme Court makes a deci­sion, it's binding law nationally -it would change the face of public educa­tion," he added. 
What makes the case unique is that the University of Michigan's under­graduate affirmative action program was recently determined to be constitu­tional by another federal courtjudge. 

The conflicting cases may likely force the U.S. Supreme Court to decide the matter once and for all. 
"It's quite likely that the Supreme Court will take a look at this case espe­cially with the conflicting opinions whether or not this type of affirmative action is permissible," Trujillo-Cox said. 
The University of Michigan expects to win the case if it goes to the Supreme Court. 
"We will appeal this decision and arc confident that we will prevail in a high­er court," said University of Michigan president Lee Bollinger in a statement. 
The Supreme Court affirmed the use of affirmative action in the case Bakke 
v. Regents of the University of California, which barred the use of quotas in the admissions process but said that race could be used as a factor. 
Last week's decision concerning the University of Michigan was made after a non-profit organization, the Center for Individual Rights, helped launch the court case.

Horowitz debates reparation issue 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 
David Horowitz continued his crusade against slav­ery reparations for African-Americans in a debate at MIT Wednesday night against Dorothy Lewis, co-chair of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America. Horowitz has attracted significant media attention in recent weeks because of an advertisement he submitted to college newspapers across the country listing 10 points against reparations for descendants of African slaves in America. Many papers -including The Crimson -said the advertisement was unneces­sarily inflammatory and chose to reject it. Falling on the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassina­tion 33 years ago, last night's debate aimed to discuss the validity of such reparations. The bearded and bespectacled Horowitz said he did not support repara­tions because they would not go to the victims of slav­ery themselves. "These slaves are dead. Their children are dead. There's no one to pay the reparations to," he said.

Basketball may boost applicants 
COLLEGE PARK. Md. 

During visits to Chicago high schools last week, University of Maryland interim admissions director Jim Christensen talked to prospective students who all wanted to talk about one subject: the Maryland men's basketball team. It seemed to Christensen the team's Final Four run was every student's link to the campus. It was common knowledge. The students knew little about campus life and academic pro­grams, but their interest was piqued and their ears opened. Thanks to the media spotlight focused on the University of Maryland during the NCAA tournament, the campus could potentially see an increase in stu­dents applying for admission next year. Boston College experienced it with its 1984 football team. After a win over national powerhouse Miami. Boston College saw its applicant pool increase nearly 40 per­cent. More recently, the University of Florida, Northwestern, Oregon State, Seton Hall and Syracuse have seen it.

This interdisciplinary approach, so revolutionary in 1950, meets greater appeal today.

Thus Cavanaugh and Bird's experiment grew and matured at Notre Dame into an unusual and challenging major which is certainly no longer in dan­ger of being dissolved. Instead, after 50 years of exposing undergraduates to the Great Books, the PLS program will continue to show those books. And it will continue to prepare its students for life beyond col­lege in a unique, unparalleled way. 
"The preparation is not seen so much as preparation for a career," Power said, "As it is preparation, you might say, for life."

ND honors Wooden for sportsmanship 
Special to The Observer 
John Wooden, the most suc­cessful coach in collegiate bas­ketball history, will be honored tonight for his longtime commit­ment to integrity in athletics by Notre Dame's Mendelson Center for Sport, Character & Culture. 

The recognition will come dur­ing the 25th annual presentation of the Wooden Award to theI nation's outstanding men's bas­
I 
ketball player at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. Father Theodore Hesburgh, president emeritus of Notre Dame, will 
make videotaped remarks on behalf of the University, and Mendelson Center co-director David Shields will present Wooden with a plaque that reads in part: 
"The consistent modeling and promotion of teamwork, sportspersonship. respect, hard work, and integrity -timeless values nurtured by Coach Wooden and honored in perpetu­ity by the John R. Wooden Award -remains the most important goal for student-ath­letes, coaches, and all who are concerned with the quality of sport. The Mendelson Center unites with the legions of friends, colleagues, and admir­ers in congratulating John Wooden and the Wooden Award Committee for keeping this goal foremost in mind and action." 
Tommy Hawkins, a 1959 Notre Dame graduate and All­American forward for the Irish, will serve as master of ceremonies for the Wooden Award. He is the vice president of communications for the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
Notre Dame also will be rep­resented at Friday's black-tie event by junior Troy Murphy, a finalist for the Wooden Award, and Irish men's basketball head coach Mike Brey. 
A native of central Indiana, Wooden led his Martinsville High School team to the state championship in 1927. He went on to become a star at Purdue University, earning recognition as the college play­er of the year and leading the Boilermakers to the national title in 1932. 
After coaching for two years at Dayton High School in Kentucky, Wooden spent the next nine years just a couple of miles from Notre Dame, coach­ing at South Bend Central High School. His overall high school coaching record was 218-42. 
Following service in the Navy during World War II, Wooden coached at lndiana State University from 1946-48, compil­ing a record of4 7 -14 and leading the Sycamores to the finals of the NAIA Invitational in his final year. 
In 1948, Wooden accepted the head coaching job at UCLA, where for the next 27 years he established one of the greatest dynasties in sports history: 620 wins against just 147 losses, four perfect 30-0 seasons, 88 consec­utive victories (a streak broken by Notre Dame in 1974). 38 straight wins in NCAA Tournament games. 20 confer­ence championships, and 10 national titles, including seven in a row. 
For all of his accomplishments as a coach, however, Wooden is equally admired for his personal integrity, commitment to acade­mic excellence, faith, and self­control, all with the intent of helping his players develop to their fullest both on and off the court. "Ability may get you to the top," he said, "but it takes char­acter to keep you there." . 
Wooden, now 90, resides in the Los Angeles suburb of Encino. 


Crosson recreates great authors 
By C. SPENCER BEGGS 
News Writer 
Frederick Crosson, former 
John J. Cavanaugh Professor of 
Humanities in the Program of 
Liberal Studies, sees the Program 
of Liberal Studies (PlS) as a "con­
versation with the authors of the 
core texts." 
Consequently, his lecture ­
given Thursday afternoon at 
McKenna Hall-took the form of 
a dialectic with his favorite Great 
Books authors (played by him­
self), each interjecting their com­
ments to spur the conversation. 
Crosson and his imagined inter­
locutors discussed, specifically, 
the role of faith in liberal educa­
tion. 
"The title [of my lecture] is 'Seeing and Believing,' not 'Seeing is Believing,"' Crosson said to begin defining his argu­ment. Crosson's lecture was part of Notre Dame's PLS conference "Liberal Learning and the Great Books," which commemorates 
the department's 50th anniver­sary. "A good deal of what we learn in college comes about through believing," Crosson said. The difference between believing and knowing, for Crosson, is that to know is to have experi­

' 
ence. On the other hand, to believe one must either have faith in other's experiences of mortally perceiv­able things or faith in things that are beyond human experience. 
Crosson said that 
most of our "knowl­edge" is actually belief. We all "know" that the earth revolves around the sun, but rather than observe those facts for ourselves, we under­stand the process of how others observed them and have faith in their experience. It is in this way that what we "know," Crosson said. we actually "believe." Although he admitted that, "It would be better to know than to 
believe." 
Crosson described the classic Greek thinkers as seeking under­standing through what was evi­dent in the natural world, "what showed itself to be true." In antiquity, he said intellectuals sought to replace opinions with 
knowledge. In the more modern intellectu­al (Christian} tradition, according 

to Crosson. knowledge is intrinsi­cally intertwined with belief. "Flesh and blood, that is humans, cannot discover the whole truth," said Crosson. Rather, they may only believe in knowledge. 
Crosson established two "grounds for belief." First, like Aristotle, one may have to believe before one can understand some­thing. Secondly, one may believe when the thing is, in principal, beyond human capacity for 
understanding. 
Past individual beliefs, Crosson examined religions, or systems of belief, based on three questions: whether the their doctrine was illuminating, whether it was con­sistent with things one already knows to be the case and what are its benefits to the individual and society.

quality professors. The apart­
ments are especially accommo­
dating to visiting professors with 
children because the residences 
are all two-bedroom complexes. Often it is difficult for visiting professors, especially professors on sabbatical from other coun­tries, to find housing in the local South Bend community because their stay is so brief, said 
Schellinger. The new apart­ments will provide a place for these faculty members to live. 
"The whole program is designed for a short term stay," said Schellinger. 
Although the University has the funds to begin building, Schellinger said Notre Dame is still looking for donors to sub­sidize the apartments. 
The University has been aware of the increased need for housing and is committed to the project. said Schellinger. 
The Office of the Provost is in the process of deciding which colleges and institutions at Notre Dame will receive the badly needed apartments, said Schellinger. Distribution of the apartments is based on the budget, size and need of the colleges and institutions requesting space. Each college must have a five-year commit­ment to rent in their budget. 
Although the assignments have not been announced yet, there is a long waiting list from different colleges and institutions at Notre Dame, said Schellinger. The apart­ments are expected to be ready for spring of 2002.

research race issues 
By ALLIE JAY 
News Writer 
Professor James Sterba will leave Notre Dame at the end of the semester to pursue his research interests at the 
National Humanities Center in N o r t h Carolina. Sterba, a philosophy professor, was award­

ed one of 
Sterba
35 residen­
tial fellow­ships. 
"I was honored and surprised especially to find out that only four philosophers were award­ed fellowships," said Sterba, "The time off is the most impor­tant thing. With a year off I can get to these projects." 
The fellowship, which Sterba received in March, will allow him to complete two books for Oxford University Press without teaching obligations. One of the books he hopes to complete during his fellowship year is a defense of affirmative action. 
"I feel things are going badly on the affirmative action issue right now, and I wanted to have input and sway things in a posi­tive direction," Sterba said. "Today the Supreme Court is turning the 14th amendment on its head and making sure whites don't have to make any concessions to blacks." 
The 14th amendment. or the 
equal rights and protection 
amendment, was passed after 
the Civil War as a means to 
defend the government's dis­
persal of land and aid that was 
offered to blacks. However. 
according to Sterba, the 
Supreme Court is not allowing 
race to be taken into account 
when designing aid programs 
under its current interpretation 
of the amendment. 
Sterba also expressed con­
cern that the present Court's 
interpretation of the 14th 
amendment prevents programs 
that help African Americans catch up. He said programs need to be implemented to aid African Americans that suffer injustices in today's society which is still not color blind. 
"To get beyond racism you have to take race into account. ... If you look at the lives of blacks today, there's plenty of evidence. You don't have to look to the past. but just look at our white lives and the benefits and privileges we have," he said. 

On April 27 Sterba will debate his position on affirma­tive action with Carl Cohen from the University of Michigan who strongly opposes affirma­tive action. The second project Sterba will work on will draw on the history of ethics to argue for the importance of practical arguments such as the distribu­tion of goods in society and the morality of homosexual rela­tionships. 
"These are all important practical issues that we usually don't look to the ancient philosophers to answer" said Sterba. 
Sterba has written more than 150 articles and published 21 books. 
His book. "Justice for Here and Now" was awarded the 1998 Book of the Year award by the North American Society for Social Philosophy.

A demand for disclosure of wages, materials and condi­tions would not be unprece­dented. In the Anti-Sweatshop Task Force's final proposal last year, Saint Mary's requires companies making Saint Mary's apparel to dis­close its wages and work con­ditions. 
"Subcontractors recognize that wages are essential to workers basic needs. Therefore, Subcontractors shall pay employees, as a floor, wages and benefits which comply with all applica­ble laws and regulations, and which provide for essential needs and establish a dignified living wage for workers and their families. Saint Mary's reserves the right to terminate relations with a Subcontractor that violates natioual, local. or regional laws of the region of manufacture." 
If Saint Mary's holds international contractors to these disclosure standards, it should hold its local contrac­tors to the same standards. This disclosure by local con­tractors would not be public. Only Saint Mary's administra­tors would see the breakdown of the bid. 
This solution would not only protect local workers from unfair wages as compared to other contractors but also would protect Saint Mary's. By seeing the exact breakdown of money budgeted for materials and workers in each bid, Saint Mary's could avoid contract­ing with a company which would spend money on cheap­er materials and lesser skilled workers. 
In the long run, this plan will assure that construction on Saint Mary's campus is high quality and that local workers are paid fairly.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Supporting the unknown athletes 

You may know them. They are in your dorms, your class­es, or they may be one of your friends. They are athletes, but you may not know that at all or may not know what they do. 
You may have mistaken them for offensive linemen on the football team because of their size or their letter jackets. If you work in the issue room, it may have been you who mis­took them for male cheerleaders. To the average person eating in the dining hall. they might look like guys who pile up a little too much on their trays at every meal. 
They study science, business and engineering in the library at night and attend classes during the day in prepa­ration for their various futures: flight school, medical school. banking, entrepreneurship or being the technical master­mind behind a project. 
In addition, they spend the majority of the afternoon in the weight room or in the field. They push their bodies to the limits to achieve some personal realization of success. They are rarely recognized and hardly publicized, further proving they are not in this sport for the glory. 
They are athletes of caliber meeting or exceeding all other Notre Dame athletes but are never asked about their accomplishments nor complimented for their performance. They'll never see a colorized Irish Insider highlighting their team's upcoming competition. Even so. this tight knit group works unceasingly to do their best and derives strength from camaraderie {and cookouts). 
Who are these mystery athletes? What do they do? They are the hardest working, most dedicated, genuine and humorous men that I have met in my time at Notre Dame. 
They throw the hammer, the javelin, the shot put and the discus for the men's track and field team at Notre Dame. Come support and cheer on John Scolaro, Matt O'Brien, Derek Dyer, Brian Thornburg, Mike Madigan, Jason Davis and Juan Alba in their only home outdoor meet of the sea­son. 
This group, affectionately known as "the throwers," will compete this Saturday beginning at 10 a.m. at Meyo Field. They're your friends, boyfriends, housemates. classmates or fellow dorm members. Don't let their hard work go unno­ticed again. Go Irish!

Challenging the established sexual order 
When is bigotry not bigotry? Apparently, when it is declared natural law by a patriarchal institution to support its value of heterosexual supremacy. 
Well, at least that's what Charles Rice wants us to believe. And, it helps. of course, if we conveniently forget that religious institutions have invoked (and still do) the specter of natural law to support big­otry in many forms -slavery of African Americans, dominance of women -among other things. 
Rice's diatribe could easily have been reduced to one sentence reflecting his oft-touted opinion: "A society in which it makes no difference whether boys marry girls or other boys is on a dead-end road to extinction." 
It may surprise you that I actually agree with Rice on the content of this sentence. First though, I need to reword it just a bit so that I can be comfortable agreeing with it: "A society in which it makes no difference whether men marry women or other men, or women marry women is on a dead-end road to extinction." 
Maybe I'm being fastidious, but referring to men and women as boys and girls seems a bit paternal­istic -almost like I am being shown my place in the hierarchy compared to Rice's perception of his. It would kind of be like me calling him Chuck. 
Oh yeah, then there's that women marrying women phrase I've added. In my experience, les­bians tend to be a little sensitive about being left out, rendered invisible, acted toward as if they don't exist. Rice probably assumes that lesbians for­get that they are women and that being women their relationships with each other aren't really that threatening to a male-centered structure. 
Perhaps that's why Rice left them out. He proba­bly wanted to go after the real traitors of the patri­archy -men who love men or men who love men and women {another group he left out). He knew that women who love women weren't even worth the mention. 
Now that I've got semantics out of the way, I think I might be able to agree with Rice. However, anoth­er problem arises. I realize I probably don't agree with his unstated major premise, his underlying assumptions and worldview. 
Howard Becker, a well-respected sociologist, encourages us new social scientists to "extract the hidden major premise" when we are looking at any social interaction. So I look closer. Does Rice have a hidden major premise, one that he is not stating forthrightly? 
Of course he does. Society, just like it is currently, is good -at least in regard to how it treats gay and lesbian people. And he doesn't want that goodness to be taken away by some concept like equality or dignity. 
Bringing forth his hidden major premise, I can now wholeheartedly agree with him. A society that grants privileges to certain groups of people solely because of their sexual orientation (or their skin color or sex or lack of disabilities) will become extinct when it dismantles those privileges. 
Built on heterosexual privilege, this "good" soci­ety will fall if gay and lesbian people are treated with equality. We have found common ground ­we believe the same thing. 
Heterosexual privileges -what are those you ask? Those would be things like not being beaten or killed by complete strangers because of your sexual orientation. Heterosexual privilege is having a full array of legal rights that acknowledge and support your relationship -even after a three-day courtship with a stranger and a Las Vegas Elvis Chapel wedding. It is seeing accurate reflections of your life and your relationships represented in his­tory, in literature, in art, in science -throughout popular culture. Gosh, its even having your roman­tic relationship considered legitimate. 
If I were Charles Rice -a white, educated, Christian male who is (presumably) economically comfortable and heterosexual -I'd be very con­cerned about any changes that threatened the privi­

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
University responds inconsistently to banners 
During the last three weeks, many people have in some way seen or heard about the DCBFA Project. You may have read or heard about the mock newspaper The Observed (which was in no way pro­duced or endorsed by The Observer, I should note). You may have also seen banners in various locations on campus which address topics of gender relations at Notre Dame. 1 Some have seen them and some may have heard about them but I thought it worth­while to share information about those banners that people wouldn't otherwise find out about.

When I requested permission to ~ hang the banners on various buildings , ­on campus, the University (individuals need ZC: not be named) said no. 
The reasoning behind the decision as I understood, was that the University wanted to avoid the possibility of a precedent being set about hanging banners on 
campus buildings, academic or otherwise. While my banners are in some ways controversial. I found it strange that the University had declined my request based on the reasoning being offered. In meetings, the sentiment was expressed that it was not the content of the banners that were in ques­tion (if it were, issues of censor­ship and freedom of speech could have become an issue). 
The University declined my banners because they were afraid that if they allowed 
these banners, people would want to begin hang­

___ Dame. These spirit banners are a tradition 
at Notre Dame and a great one at that. 
Aside from banners that support our athletics there have been banners that promote student government nominees as well. Dorms aren't the only buildings that communicate with banners though. 
Just a few weeks ago, the Engineering department displayed large banners on Fitzpatrick and Cushing halls promoting Engineering Week, In addition, the newly opened Coleman-Morse building currently advertises the Writing Workshop on its facade. 
It seems the precedent has already been set. Banners are used often at Notre Dame, and they have become a tradition as well as an effective means of communication. So why then were my banners declined permission to hang? 
After going ahead and hanging the banners. some of them have been taken down. After one of the banners was taken down from a dorm, I was told that banners aren't supposed to be hung from dorm windows. I'm not sure I've seen banners hung any other way, and I'm not sure I accept that as a reason for the banner to be taken down. 
With varied reasons for why the banners aren't per­missible, none of which seem to hold water, I have to wonder why the banners are receiving resistance. Is it because the University wants to avoid banners being hung or is it because the University doesn't like what my banners have to say? I'll let others be the judge of that. 
From now on the banners will hang safely in the gallery window of the Snite Museum of Art while the DCBFA Project is on exhibit there.

Catholics don't even have a choice of whether or not to observe this practice, as no meat is served in the dining halls on Lenten Fridays. The tradition is a long-standing one, however, and before Vatican II, every Friday of the year was a day of abstinence from meat. Today. only Ash Wednesday, Good Friday and all other Fridays in Lent are days of abstinence from meat. This rule of absti­nence applies to all Catholics above the age of 14. 

In addition, Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are days of fasting, defined as avoid­ing snacking and eating only one full meal and two smaller meals that together do not equal the third. The idea is obviously not, however, to weigh plates of food so as to eat as much as possible, but instead to think of the sacrifice as commemorating Jesus's death on Good Friday. The rule of fasting applies to Catholics between the ages of 18 and 59. 
Passing up the juicy Whopper can bring some grown men to tears, but consider how much more of a sacrifice it could be. Fasting rules in the early days of the Church allowed only one meal a day in the evening and pro­hibited meat, fish, eggs and dairy products. Even today in the Orthodox and Eastern churches, fasting encompasses no meat, no dairy products and no condiments made from animal fat. So while giving up chicken, ham and the meatballs on your spaghetti may be a true sacrifice each Friday, consider what it is meant to represent -and how much more it could be. 
Penance 
The season of Lent is known as a time of penance, a time to recognize the faults and short-comings that come ~ith being human and to come to God in sincere prayer for for­giveness. During this season, Catholics are 
tions, giving reasons for all facets of the season 
encouraged to take part in the sacrament of penance, also known as confession or recon­ciliation. At Notre Dame there are many opportunities to go to a priest for confession, especially during Lent. Priests are available to hear confessions at the Basilica on Monday through Thursday at 11:15 a.m., 5 and 7 p.m., and on Friday at 11: 15 a.m. and 5 p.m. Reconciliation is offered at the Sacred Heart Parish Crypt on Saturday from 4 to 5 
p.m. Opportunities for the individual sacra­ment of penance will also be available in the Basilica after the campus-wide Stations of the Cross on April 10. 
Sacrifice 

Finally, the defining characteristic of the season. Around Catholic schools like Saint Mary's and Notre Dame, the question "What are you giving up for Lent?" is not uncom­mon in the early days after Ash vVednesday. Sacrificing desserts, candy, soft drinks or alcohol is one common Lenten resolution. People often take this opportunity to reform themselves of bad habits or try to improve their relationships with others. While giving something up for Lent is not mandatory, it has become a traditional practice of self­denial and sacrifice for Catholics. 
Technicalities 

The attentive observer has noticed by now that the "40 days of Lent" concept doesn't hold up when checked on a calendar -if the Church wants to be accurate about this, shouldn't they call it the 46 days of Lent? This is where a slight technicality comes in: the Sundays that fall during the Lenten sea­son are not actually a part of Lent. As Sundays are set aside for celebrating the res­urrection of Christ, they are not part of the penitential and somber season of Lent. 
Now the wheels are turning as they have in many a Catholic schoolchild's head: if Sundays aren't a part of Lent, then Lenten promises don't apply to those days either, right? 
Well, technically, no. You are allowed to have whatever you gave up for Lent on Sundays and feast days as well, like the Feast of St. Joseph. But while you can indulge yourself, the Church encourages you not to, in the spirit of maintaining an honest (albeit difficult or irritating) sacrifice during Lent. Basically, if you go for the dessert on Sundays and all your roommates know you've given it up, their dirty looks may be justified. 
Via Dolorosa/ Way of the Cross 
The Stations of the Cross are another tradi­tional form of prayer that is held year round, but receives special attention during Lent. This reflection on 14 moments or stages in Jesus's sentencing and crucifixion originated during the early days of the Church when pilgrims would retrace the last steps of Jesus in Jerusalem along the "Via Dolorosa," or the "Sorrowful Way." As more Christians longed to follow in Jesus's footsteps but were unable to make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem, churches set up stations commemorating the journey of Christ to Calvary. 
Today at Notre Dame there are Stations of the Cross in the Basilica, around the lake and in many residence halls. On April 10 at 7 p.m., Campus Ministry is hosting the annual Campus-Wide Stations of the Cross, a candle­lit reflection on the Stations that moves to different stations on campus and ends up in the Basilica. 
From A to Z, there is much more depth to the season of Lent than giving up swearing or hitting up the local fish fry on Friday nights. With ancient and rich traditions, the 40 days of preparation for Easter offer a valuable time of reflection for Christians and non-Christians alike.

"Obviously, things didn't turn out as I thought they were going to,·· he said. 
"I felt that moving to receiver was the right decision" 
Now Battle had a much more difficult decision in front of him. Should he stay at quarterback, or should he try to become a wide receiver? If he stayed at quarterback, he would have to compete against Lovecchio for the starting job. But if he made the switch, he would have to get used to playing an unfamiliar position. 
Through conversations with Davie and the rest of the coach­ing staff, Battle eventually settled on becoming a receiver.. 

"I felt my best option was for me and as well as the team was for me to move to receiver to eliminate the quarterback con­troversy," he said. "For me to just try to make it to the next level, I thought it would be best if I changed positions." 
"I had made the decision after we had won seven football games that the first day of spring practice Matt LoVecchio was going to be that starting quarter­back," Davie said. "I also real­ized Arnaz Battle is one of our 11 best players on offense." 
"It was a culmination of a lot of things, but in my gut I knew it was the right thing," he contin­ued. "It was one of those situa­tions that I felt, looking at it from the distance a little bit and see­ing all those things, that this was the right thing to do and the right time to do it." 
But when the team heard the news, Battle got some mixed reactions. 
"Some guys were for it, and some guys were against it," he said. "It's just one of those deals where you have to look out for what's best for the team and for myself, and I felt that moving to receiver was the right decision." 
"It was very difficult" 
It's definitely been a struggle for Battle to make the switch. 
The last time Battle played wide receiver was his freshman year of high school. He got some exposure to flanker while the Irish were preparing for the Fiesta Bowl, and as he quickly found out, it was much easier to burn high school defenses than play receiver in college. 
"It was different," he said. "I

interceptions and only passed for 94 yards, causing many to ques­tion whether or not he could pass the ball effectively. 
But when the season finally started, Battle quieted most of his critics. In the opener against Texas A&M, Battle completed 10-of-16 passes and threw for 133 yards and two touchdowns. He also rushed for 50 yards and was named NBC Player of the Game. 
"Coming out and playing a good Texas A&M defense, one of the best defenses we were going to face that season, and having a pretty good game, I was very comfortable about the season," he said. "I was very jacked up about it." 
But the excitement only lasted one week. 
"After the game, I knew something was wrong" 
It happened on his first play from scrimmage -on national television against the No. 1 team in the nation. 
"It was the first play," he said. "I rolled out and avoided a guy as I stepped up. As he hit me, I was falling back and I thought I was going to fall on my tailbone, but I didn't. I landed 
coaches had spent all summer tailoring the offense to Battle's strengths. When a reporter asked Davie what the coaches did after hearing the extent of Battle's injury, he responded, "After we stopped crying?" 
Eventually, Davie named Gary Godsey the starter and an unknown freshman named Matt Lovecchio backup. But after a loss to Michigan State, when Godsey showed that he was unable to run the option, Davie named Lovecchio the starter. 
Meanwhile, Battle watched from the sidelines with a cast on his left wrist. 
"I thought I had a chance to come back and play" 
Although the doctors said he might be out for the rest of the season, Battle didn't give up. 
"I thought I had a chance to come back and play and get the spot back and contribute to the team," he said. 
Davie clearly wanted Battle on the field. Before the Oct. 28 game against Air Force, he said, "If Arnaz was healthy, he'd be the starting quarterback." 
But Battle wasn't healthy, and he wasn't the starting quarter­back. And as Lovecchio won game after game, Battle began to re-think his options. He didn't 
even have his felt very uncomfortable going out there and not knowing how to run the routes. The rest of the team was going full speed, and you 're going three-quarters because you're not really sure what you're supposed to be doing." 

"It was very difficult." 
But the quarterback-turned­receiver is slowly getting adjust­ed to his new role. And he feels much more comfortable lining up on the outside rather than under center. 
"It's not as much thinking as quarterback," he said. "It's just going out there ?. nd making plays, and 
he is able to read defensive schemes better than most receivers. 
"Playing quarterback brings more knowledge of the game," he said. "I know all the f orma­tions. I know where the different positions are aligned, and how to read defenses differently. know­ing where the safeties and the cornerbacks are." 
But learning the offense from a quarterback's perspective is also causing Battle some trouble. While his wrist has healed, he's plagued by a sore hamstring that slows him down. He also is hav­ing trouble learning the routes

the indoor season. She will run the 200-meters Saturday, an event in which she posted an impressive mark of 23.86 sec­onds last weekend at the Arizona State Invite. 
"I'm going to open her up where she can run in a race where she can get the competi­tion to run a fast time," Millar said. Last week she [set a per­sonal record] in the 200, so I want to keep building that for her. Once she starts running 400s she'll be doing it every weekend." 
Junior Dore DeBartolo has a busy day ahead of her. After 

\ \ missing the indoor season with a knee injury, she will compete in the hammer throw, shot put, dis­cus and javelin Saturday. "There's nothing wrong with fatigue, you've got to put it on the line sooner or later," Winsor said of DeBartolo, who rarely throws the javelin. "She can throw. the javelin. You just have to do what you have to do to win. Depending on how well she

Another athlete competing in an odd event is sophomore Jaime Volkmer, who will participate in the long jump as well as her spe­cialty. the pole vault. 
"She long jumped in high school. She's a pretty good ath­lete," Winsor said. 
Winsor expects Volkmer to win the pole vault, but has been impressed with the perfor­mances of junior Natalie Hallett. senior Bethany Wilson and fresh­man Jill Van Weelden in the event. 
"Natalie got off to an outstand­ing start last week, vaulting 11­3," Winsor said. "Beth is looking pretty good. That's the biggest pole she's ever been on." 
In the distance races, senior Chrissy Kuenster and freshman Julia Schmidt qualified for the Big East championships in the 10,000 last weekend while Jennifer Handley posted an impressive time of 17:10.77 in the 5,000 meters. All three ath­letes will run the 3,000-meters on Saturday

Gilbert isn't the only sprinter out of action for the Irish this weekend. Freshman James Bracken and senior Terry Wray, Notre Dame's top two 400-meter runners during the indoor season, are also out. Wray has a sprained ankle while Bracken. like Gilbert, has a sore hamstring. 
"We've got aches and pains and some guys are sort of struggling with injuries right now," Millar said. "We're just going to have to do without them and hopefully get them back in the next week or two." 
\Vith Davey in the mix, though, the Irish tank is far from empty. The senior ran a career-best time of 21.71 sec­onds in the 200-meters at Stanford last weekend and will compete in both the 100-and 200-meter sprints in addition to the relay on Saturday.

Associated Press 
TAMPA, Fla. . The first Notre Dame player from the Paul Mainieri era to play in the majors earned a spot on one of the major leagues' top rotations. Parker played at ND in 1994 and '95, when he was a fourth-round pick of Expos. 
Rookie Christian Parker earned more than a roster spot on the New York Yankees. He carved out a slot in the rotation. 
Manager Joe Torre told the 25-year-old right-hander the good news after the Yank~es' exhibition game against Pittsburgh was rained out last Thursday night. 
"The first thing I said to him: 'When you came to camp, I didn't know your name. You made us, in essence, know who you are. And not by doing any­thing crazy other than going out there and pitching,"' Torre said. 

I 
Parker entered the fifth starter race as a longshot, well behind front-runners Randy t 
Keisler and Adrian Hernandez. In five outings, including three starts, Parker went 1-1 with a 
3.60 ERA. 
"There was a big smile on his face when I told him," Torre said. "That's the fun part of this job when it comes to this time of year." 
Parker is scheduled to make trts major league debut on April 6 against the Toronto Blue Jays at Yankee Stadium. 
"I didn't say a whole lot in there, I listened for the most part," said Parker, whose voice occasionalry cracked while talk­ing with reporters. "I told him I would be ready to go when it's my turn." 
"It's a huge relief, along with the obvious excitement. Unavoidable excitement. I'm ready to get the season going, that's the bottom line." 
Parker went 14-6 at Double-A Norwich last season. He was one of three pitchers New York pitching staff as far as the four acquired from Montreal for guys go in the league. I don't Hideki Irabu in December, have to be the ace. We have 1999. four aces. It's an honor to be

than 100 percent. 
Quillian Redwine. who underwent surgery for a torn meniscus in his right knee less than two months ago, returned last weekend to clear 6-feet, 9 3/4 inches at the Purdue open. Redwine, though, is limited to the high jump and cannot compete in the triple jump, his other spe­cialty. 
"Put it this way, he. will be triple-jumping at the Big East meet," said Irish jumps coach Scott Winsor. "We just don't want to hurt him before it." 
In the triple jump, Mbagwu -who jumped over 50 feet during the indoor season ­also will compete at less than 100 percent. 
"He's working on some patellar tendentious," Winsor said. "It's pretty sore." 
In the other field events, Winsor expects solid perfor­mances out of both Derek Dyer and Juan Alba in the dis­cus, as well as from Josh Heck in the pole vault. 
"Derek Dyer got off to a good start in the discus out­doors," Winsor said. "The other guy who got off to a phe­nomenal start is our fresh man, Juan Alba. To throw 150 feet his first time out, that's great. Josh Heck got off to a great start. He's going to do fine." 
In the distance races, Ryan Shay will compete in both the 5,000-meters and 1500­meters. Shay automatically qualified for the NCAA Championships in the 10,000 last weekend, posting a time of 
28:40.03 at Stanford. 

In the hurdles, freshmen Napolean Suarez and Mark Barber showed promise last weekend. Suarez posted a time of 53.68 seconds in the 400-meter intermediate hur­dles, while Barber clocked 
15.12 seconds in the 110­meter highs. 
"He's more suited to the 110 hurdles rather than the 60 because he doesn't have that short burst of speed." Millar said of Barber, who struggled with the 60-meter hurdles during the indoor season. 
The meet provides an oppor­tunity for every player on the Irish roster to perform in front of a home crowd. 
"The great thing is that a lot of kids can compete," Piane said.

The 22-5-1 Notre Dame men's baseball team will head to Piscataway, N. J. this week­end to take on Rutgers in a three-game showdown with league title implications. 
At 8-2, Rutgers currently holds the lead in the Big East standings, but Notre Dame is not far behind at 5-2. Both teams have played extremely solidly of late. Not counting a surprising 4-3 upset by Ball State, Notre Dame has 
riding a 10 game winning streak into what looks to be their toughest test of the sea­son. 
Head coach Paul Mainieri is excited about the game, but doesn't want to place too much significance on this mid-season matchup. 
"We have 26 games left on our schedule," Mainieri said. "You're always excited to play a tough team like Rutgers, but I expect our players to come out with the same fire and intensity they've shown all season." 
Nonetheless, Notre Dame will literally be throwing their best effort at Rutgers, starting staff aces Aaron Heilman (7-0, 1.17)

This weekend the Irish women's softball team travels to Storrs, Conn. to take on the Connecticut Huskies in a Saturday doubleheader. On Sunday, the Irish face the Syracuse Orangewomen in another double­

In the Big East Preseason Coaches Poll, UConn was picked to finish second behind Notre Dame. However, the Huskies have struggled with a 9-16 overall record and an 0-2 start in the Big East. Nonetheless Notre

against Virginia Tech. The Orangewomen are in their inaugural season as a varsity sport. 
"It's their first year but we're going in with the same mentality [as the UConn game]. We'll look over the scouting report and get ready to play," said Sharron. 
"We need to make sure our offense plays consistently." said Sharron, "and that we beat the teams we should." 
Dame captain Jen Sharron said her team is expecting a tough match up. 
"Being Notre Dame it's like we have a target on our backs and being No. 11, we have an even bigger target," said Sharron. "We prepare for each Big East game like we're going into a big game. We wouldn't take them [the

In order to ensure victory against Rutgers, Mainieri knows that his team will have to put forth a solid all-around effort. 
"We need to play solidly in every aspect of the game," he said. 
Fortunately for the Irish. it appears that this goal is slowly becoming a reality quickly.

weeks of lack­

be carrying a 10 game hitting streak into the weekend. while second base­man Steve Sollman boasts a nine-game streak and a .432 batting average. 
These numbers have comple­mented nicely with Notre Dame pitching staff, whose combined 
2.45 staff ERA is currently sec­ond in the nation. 
This weekend's game looks to pit two of the top college base­b a 11 teams in the country against each other, and Mainieri expects a battle. 
"Any time you match up two teams who are vying for a Big East title, it's always going to be a great game," he said.

WOMEN'S TENNIS 
No. 8 Irish take two from Big 10 teams 
By STEVE KEPPEL 
Sports Writer 
The winning ways continue for the Irish, as the eighth-ranked Notre Dame women's tennis team beat Indiana for the sixth straight time on Wednesday. After a difficult start the Irish bounced back and trounced the Hoosiers 6-1. The Irish came back and won three singles matches despite suffering losses in the first set. 
The Hoosiers came out strong and won the doubles point with victories at No. 2 and No. 3 sin­gles both 8-3. Michelle Dasso and Becky Varnum gained the only doubles win for the Irish with an 8-1 victory over Indiana's Kelly Blanch and Levin. The fifth­ranked Dasso and Varnum improve their record to a team high 17-2 this spring. 
Being down 1-0 the Irish start­ed off strong in singles. Varnum won the first match in straight sets followed by another straight set victory from Lindsay Green 6­4, 6-4 at No. 5 singles. 
Freshman Caylan Leslie won a tough match over the Hoosier's 
J.J. Levin 6-3. 3-6. 6-3 at No. 4 singles to put the Irish up 3-1. but it didn't get any easier from there. 
Third-ranked Michelle Dasso had a scare but pulled it out in the end as she came back from a first set loss to beat Kelly Blanch 4-6, 6-2, 6-4. With the win Dasso improves to 12-0 against Midwest opponents this season. At the No. 3 spot Nina Vaughan clinched the win for the Irish with a three set victory against Linda Tran 3-6, 6­3, 6-3. Kimberly Guy closed the match with a 5-7. 6-2. 6-4 victory against Martina Grimm at No. 6 singles. 
On Thursday the Irish traveled once again -to Champaign to take on the Fighting Illini of Illinois. The 36th-ranked Illini gave the Irish a little more than they bargained for as Notre Dame squeaked by with a 4-3 win. The Illini were down all match but stayed strong to keep the score close.

"I am extremely proud of the way that we fought back today ­it was a tremendous rally," said Illinois head coach Sujay Lama in a press release. "We are a very fit team and I thought we would get the job done. We are right there with the top teams. we need to learn to capitalize and break through in a situation like today. We are playing good tennis, but we have to learn to finish off matches. and then we will be among the elite." 
Unlike against Indiana. the Irish came out on Thursday and swept the doubles point. The Irish won with ease at the No. 2 and 3 spots but the fifth-ranked team of Dasso and Varnum struggled against senior Simone Kung and freshman Michelle Web, who pushed the Irish team to a tie­breaker before falling, 9-8 (7-4). 
In singles the Irish looked as if they were going to make quick work of the Illini as they went up 3-0 with wins from Varnum and Vaughan at Nos. 2 and 3 singles. 
Instead of succumbing to the strength and talent of the Irish the Illini fought back as Kung defeated the Caylan Leslie. 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 at the No. 4 spot and fellow· senior Carla Rosenberg played a tough match and beat Green at No. 5. At No. 6, the Illini's Webb overcame a 6-2 first­set loss to fight back and defeat Guy in three sets 2-6, 7 -5, 6-3. 
With the match tied 3-3 it came 
down to No. 1 with all-American

After the tough match against the third ranked Dasso, McGaffigan said in a press release, "We have similar games and there were some really long points. I tried to stay out there as long as I could after the first set, I picked it up in the second set and played smarter."

A new Battle plan 

ERNESTO LACAYO/The Observer 
This spring, Arnaz Battle is making the transition from quarterback to wide receiver. At left, Battle throws a pass during a Sept. 9 game against Nebraska. Battle broke his wrist on Notre Dame's first offensive play that game. At right, Battle catches a pass during the first day of spring practice.

By ANDREW SOUKUP 
Associace Sporrs Ediror 
To say it's been a long year for Arnaz Battle is quite an understatement. 
The rising senior was supposed to have led the Irish back to national prominence. He was supposed to have been the focal point of the Irish offense. He was supposed to be entering this season as the undis­puted starting quarterback of the Notre Dame foot­ball team. 
But it took just one play to change his entire career. 
And now Arnaz Battle has found himself adjusting to a completely different role on Notre Dame's foot­ball team. 
"I knew that I was the guy" 
It's hard to imagine that one year ago Battle was preparing for the Blue and Gold game as Notre Dame's starting quarterback. And he knew he had the entire Notre Dame community watching him, wondering if he was going to be good enough to fill Jackson's shoes, wondering if he was going to be good enough to lead Notre Dame. 
"I knew that I was the guy," he said. "There's a lot of pressure on you being a Notre Dame quarter­back." 
But Battle was clearly comfortable in his role. In fact, during the summer, he even went so far as to predict a national championship for the Irish in 2000. 
Most people didn't agree with him. In fact, they didn't even think Battle could ever be a successful quarterback. When Notre Dame lost to USC his fresh­man year, Battle -in three quarters -threw two
