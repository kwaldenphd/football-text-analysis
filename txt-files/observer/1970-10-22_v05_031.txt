The most common problem encountered involves that of a failme of one student's relations with his fellow students. A per­son who is unable to socialize and communicate with others undergoes serious integration difficulties. The feelings and e­motions arising from this social vacuum can he very intense, and critical to one's mental state. The great American feeling of loneliness is shared by all_, but it is only when one is no longer a­ble to handle the anxieties which accompany it, that serious prob­lems can arise. 
The reaction to loneliness of­ten appears in the form of de­pression or lack of confidence and these emotions can intensify to a point where a person be­comes incapable of functioning normally. Persons might then at­tempt escape by various means: one which often results in ser­ious problems is the escape into drugs. Other means of escape, such as burying yourself in your books, drinking, or the lack of initiative and thus inability to concentrate and accomplish any­thing, can alL result in serious problems for the student. 
The main object of the 
Psychological Services Center is to help persons function nor­mally again. When someone first stops at the center, a member of the staff will conduct an inte­rview. The staff consists of three psychologists, Drs. Ralph Dunn, Charles Arens , and James Brogle, and one psychiatrist, Dr. Sara Charles. In the interview it will be determined whether or not the person is in need of as­sistance. Both individual and group therapy are offered at the center and a person can state

One of the difficulties en­countered by the Center is that the people who are mostin need of its services are often those who won't seek its assistance. This necessitates that a friend or room-mate, aware that another is facing problems he doesn't seem able to handle, either sug­gest the friend stop at the cen­ter, or call or visit himself and discuss the person's difficulties with one of the staff. 
The psychological services center, and the people who run it, are here for one reason: to be of assistance to the Notre Dame 
and St. Mary's community. The staff consists of intelligent, sensi­tive, and concerned human beings trying their best to assist others in seeing life a little more clearly, a little more understand­ably; while coming to terms with its meaning themselves.

Hartke, Roudebush clash 
INDIANAPOLIS (UPI) -The cafllJs of Sen. Vance Hartke (D-Ind.) and Rep. Richard L. Roudebush (R-Ind.), clashed yesterday over the "refusal" or "inability" of Republicans to set another date for a cancelled second statewide debate be­tween the two candidates. 
First Democratic State Chair­man Gordon St. Angelo, repre­senting Hartke in planning the statewide television and radio debates, accused the Republi­cans of reneging on an agree­ment to hold two debates, "I hesitate to call Mr. Roudebush a WNDU could be expanded state­wide. "I informed the IBA today that Congressman Roudebush was willing to expand the South Bend program to one hour and let it be broadcast statewide," Durnil said. 
But Harry Kevorkian, news director of WNDU, said that after conversations with St. Angelo, Durnil, and Eldon Campbell, general manager of Indianapolis WFBM-TV and IBA spokesman in negotiations on the Hartke-Roudebush statewide debates, no agreement was reached on a statewide expan­

Crime concerns Newman 
by Ann Therese Darin 
Donald Newman, Republican hopeful for the seat of Demo­.cratic incumbent John Brademas 
(2nd CD), addressed St. Mary's political science classes yester­day. 
In his prepared remarks, New­man advocated a return to law and order. He claimed that crime usurps foreign and economic is­sues as the number one concern of the American people. 
Propagating crimes, he said, is the free speech policy of many 
on debate 
was  that  this expansion is  not  
likely.  
Have Debated Once  
Hartke  and  Roudebush  ap­ 

peared on a statewide televised debate Oct: 12, originating from 
WFBM. A panel of three re­porters questioned the two can­didates, who also questioned each other. Ever since, the two 
political parties and a sizeable 
portion of the viewing public
have debated the merits and demerits of this first debate. Durnil said "It should be clearly stated that CongressmanRoudebush was the 'winner' of 
of the colleges and universities in 
the nation. 
"A known revolutionary who 

advocated a destruction of our 
form of government should be 
prevented from speaking," he 
stated. To support his assertion, 
Newman cited the two members 
of the Chicago Seven who spoke 
at Kent State University a few 
days before that campus's dis­. ruptions last spring. 
"We wouldn.t bring in the 

Mafia to Notre Dame's Business 
School to lecture on business en­
terprises. We wouldn't bring in 
Billie Sol Estes to talk about in­
vestments. Why would we bring 
in the SDS?" he questioned. 
Besides differing with his op­

ponent Brademas on free speech, 
Newman also disagrees with the 
incumbent on fiscal and foreign 
policy. 
United States and other coun­tries endorsed Israel's exis­tence;' he disclosed. "So, we are morally bound to give them economic aid, and military hard­ware. Because of the sophistica­tion of the military hardware it is evident that we would have to send military advisers, but never combat troops.  
Commenting on the Vietnam war, Newman said, "It is sacrili­gious to be involved in a war halfway around the world, with business as usual at home. 
Newman, a forty-year South Bend resident, owns and manages a pharmacy in suburban Mishawaka. A graduate of Pur­due University, the congressional contender lists membership on a government medical committee as his previous political experi­ence.

As an example of fiscal waste, ;: Newman cited a program ini­
tiated by Brademas to educate 
twelve people. Total cost for the program was several hundred thousand dollars, he alleged. 
Unlike Brademas, Newman 

believes that the voters of this

situation. "We have a moral responsi­
