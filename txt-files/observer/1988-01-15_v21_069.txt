Japan pledges to work for 'dialogue and cooperation' 
Associated Press WASHINGTON -Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takes­hita pledged on Thursday to work for an era of "dialogue and cooperation" with the United States to improve the world economy, but U.S. calls continued for more specific steps by Japan to reduce its trade surplus.  Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., said Japanese leaders have made promises before, yet the trade gap grows. On one of the current major sore points, U.S. inability to penetrate Japan's construction market, U.S. Trade Represen­tative Clayton Yeutter said a proposal brought by Takeshita falls short of expectations and that the Reagan administra­ tion would consider retaliatory action. Takeshita, on his first visit to the United States since taking office in November, vowed after a three-hour meeting with President Reagan on Wednes­day to work to improve rela­tions between the two nations, stabilize financial markets and play a larger role in helping the world's debtor countries.  He expanded on those themes Thursday in a speech and question-answer session at the National Press Club, the only speaking engagement on his three-day trip to Washington. "The Japanese-American al­liance is now entering a new age in which it must not only serve the interests of our two countries but must also con-' tribute to a better future for the  entire world," he said. The world must be tran~ formed from "a place of con­frontation and conflict into a place of dialogue and coopera­tion," he said. "Let us create a global partnership of Japan and the United States dedi­cated to peace and prosperity on our planet earth by combin­ing our efforts to get things done."

In Brief 
Judge Bork resigned as a federal appeals court judge, saying he wants to correct "a public campaign of miseducation" that thwarted his nomination to the Su­preme Court, the White House announced yesterday. Pres­ident Reagan reluctantly accepted Judge Robert Bork's request to step down from the U.S. court of Appeals for the District of Columbia after six years, effective Feb. 5. He called the conservative judge's defeat in the Senate "a tragedy for our country." "All Americans are the poorer today for not having your extraordinary talents and legal skills on the high court," Reagan told Bork in a letter. -Associated Press

Censorship ruling too restrictive for the press 
"High court backs schools on censorship," read the front page headline in yesterday's Chicago Tribune. Justice Byron White, in the majority opinion, stated that educators may ex­ercise "editorial control over the style and con­tent of student speech in school-sponsored ex­pressive activities so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns." 
The decision was the result of a case involving the censorship of two articles dealing with teenage pregnancy and divorce slated to appear in a high school newspaper. 
Censorship occurs frequently in school publications, though this is the first time a case has reached the Supreme Court. In fact, we have had a similar example recently on campus, with the controversy surrounding Scholastic's publication of a sexually explicit painting in conjunction with an article on cen­sorship. 
The decision itself seems fair. If the newspa­per is school-sponsored, then the school is act­ing as publisher. If the school is putting up th~ cash, it can print whatever it wants. Or not print whatever it doesn't want. 
What scares me, though, is the precedent that 
the Supreme Court has set. 
Apparently some of the justices are worried too. " ... The court today teaches youth to dis­count important principles of our government as mere platitudes," wrote Justice William Brennan in the minority opinion. 
Freedom of the press is seen by many, I think, as mere self-righteousness n the part of jour­nalists and pompous television broadcasters. But. there is a reason for journalists to uphold the First Amendment with an almost religious fervor. 
Abridging freedom of the press can be much like a snowball, as many precedents set by courts are. The current decision sounds in­nocuous enough. It only applies to high schools 
-this was stressed in the decision -and only applies to articles that violate "the shared values of a civilized social order." 
But who decides what those values are? And should any newspaper, school-sponsored or not, be limited to publishing only the correct values? The Soviet Union has been under such restric­Hnn~ fnr many years, and we certainly point

enough fingers at Pravda. 
The restriction of the decision to only high schools will slowly fade away. Sooner or later, some beleaguered college in the midst of a con­troversy will sue its student paper for printing incorrect values that are supposedly contrary to the school's 'educational mission.' Notre Dame, to its credit, has not contemplated such a move. But sometime soon, it will happen somewhere, thanks to the Supreme Court's en­couragement. 
The Supreme Court decision, at least the parts of it that were reprinted in an admittedly biased Chicago newspaper, smacks of a "Papa knows best" attitude. The court seems to be saying that we can't expose young adults and teenagers to material that might be "poten­tially sensitive." God forbid, they might even be exposed to the real world, or even (dare I say it in a college newspaper) S-E -X? 
Maybe we should lock everone under the age of 18 in small white rooms with no television sets. Then they definitely won't be exposed to the dangers of a free press.

Journal commends ND food 
By ANGELA MCDONALD News Staff 
A recent article in the Wall Street Journal commended Notre Dame on the improve­ment of its modernized food service. 
Notre Dame as well as ap­proximately eight hundred uni­versities around the country are saying good-bye to the monotonous cafeteria style food service and welcoming a modern and personal atmo­sphere, the article said. Wil­liam Hickey, director of Notre Dame's food service said in the artical, "No longer can we work with traditional food ser­vices because students are re­questing foods that can be found in any restaurant." Notre Dame is complying with these requests. The renovation of the Huddle created a diverse style of food service as well as a warm and friendly environ­ment. 
The success of the Leprec­haun Pizza Company; which is located in the Huddle, has also drawn the attention of the Wall Street Journal. 
"The effort is to restauran­tize the campus," said William Hickey in the Wall Street Jour­nal. Hickey feels that adding these improvements will help o cater to the students' need for a more personable atmo­sphere. 
"We believe in treating stu­dents as customers instead of institutionalized individuals," he added. This is one of the main reasons for the renova­tion of the North Dining Hall, he said, which should be com­pleted by December of 1988.. 
Hickey was said everyone at last March's National Food Servioe meeting was spel­lbound at the design of the Huddle. "They called it state of the art, " Hickey added. 
"It's  the  attitude.  That's  
what makes  us  different and  
that's  what  makes  us  the  

leaders,"he said.

Woman says she bombed plane to stop Olympics 
Associated Press 
SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA -a woman linked to the destruc­tion of a South Korean airliner with 115 people aboard confessed on television Friday that she was a Communist North Korean agent and said she planted a bomb on '\~e plane. 
She identified herself as Kim Hyong-hee and said she and a' male companion blew up the plane to disrupt the 1988 Olym­pic Games in Seoul and create unrest in the south. 
The woman said the two of 
them planted a bomb made 
from liquid explosive disguised 
in a liquor bottle and a 
detonator hidden in a radio and 
left it on the plane. 
"It is natural that I ~ould be 
punished and killed a hundred 
times for my sin," the 25-year­
old woman told a nationally 
televised press conference. 
Her male companion killed 
himself last month. He was 
identified as Kim Sung Il, 69, a 
North Korean intelligence 
agent and a member of the 
ruling North Korean Commu­
nist Party. 
South Korean intelligence 
agents said Ms. Kim was acting 
on the personal orders of Kim 
Jong Il, son and political heir 
of top North Korean leader Kim 
Il Sung. 
Ms. Kim, who said she was 
from the North Korean capital 
of Pyongyang, said she initially 
refused to answer questions 
about the plane to shield Kim 
Jong Il. She used his formal title 
of "dear leader." 
"I had denteq, ~ing involved

Success and failure are closely related ideas. Each depends on the other for its meaning. Each as well has a very strong grip on American society, particularly in business and sports. 

Donald Gutierrez 
guest column 
College and professional sports are of course not just for the purpose of having fun; they comprise a massive commercial activity in our society. Cer­tainly, enjoyment still exists in sports, both amateur and professionally. Gen­erally, though, the attitude conveyed by many people involved in sports is that they are a very serious matter indeed--victory at times is almost a matter of life or death. 
One reason for this desperate outlook is that big money is involved today in sports success even on the collegiate level. A successful sports program means more publicity for the school which leads to enlarged or stable en­rollments and alumni support. Moreover, thanks partly to the mass media, the audience for sports in un­precedentedly large, which thus offers a vast audience for commercial adver­tising. When a college or university receives a post-season bowl or NCAA­playoff invitation, it can lead to a school receiving money running into seven­digit sums. 
Television-sports programming can also result in the successful advertising of products. This has led to an identifi­cation of sports and commercial values: the "X" Corporation's automo­bile battery is a winner; the "Y" Radial Tire Compnay has a strong offensive line to defend you and your family in bad winter driving. Success in these business terms raises serious ethical questions about the role of sports in our society. Should sports be manipulated by business interests for commercial "success"? And if victory in sports is seen as similar to victory over a busi­ness competitor, sports itself becomes commercialized, and loses many of the virues that some hold it instills in the young. A win by, say, the San Francisco 49ers translates into a record-breaking year for Exxon. 
Success in modern mass-media sports has thus come more and more to suggest, not just defeating the other team, but a blatant celebration of com­mercial victory, mostly through ap­plauding one's own product and 

Doonesbury 


Our infatuation with sports needs limits 
downgrading the other "team's," a practice not traditionally regarded as good sportsmanship. Considering, however, what part successful col­legiate athletic performance plays in providing careers in professional sports, the strong pressure in sports towards commercialized success be­comes evident. 

No one who enjoys modern sports (including myself) can deny their spec­tacular skill, excitement, and glamor. Athletes exhibit feats of agility, timing, coordination, and team-play that would have been considered impossible in the Forties or Fifties. This increased sports skill offers great pleasure and excite­ment to the spectator. Who can forget Kareem Jabbar's "sky-hook" shot at the climax of a key game, Joe Mon­tana's or Joe Theisman's successful scramblings and pin-point passing, the feisty and furious counter-service game of a Jimmy Connors? 
Associated with such skills and ex­citement is the glamor of big sports. Part of this glamor is the money. People who make very large salaries often seem to possess akind of magic, and one suspects in the increasingly frequent use of terms like "superstar" that the implied greatness and obvious glamor derives in part from the in­credibly large salaries and the opulent "lifestyles" which such money allows. 
Yet what people are questioning today is whether any athlete is worth over $2,000,000 a year (a question one should also ask about Pop Rock artists, movie stars, and corporation heads). Does Magic Johnson, marvellous bas­ketball player that he is, deserve a $25,000,000-25 year contract? One is told that if free enterprise makes such salaries possible, then an athlete is "worth" whatever money his skills) or those of his agent) can acquire for him. Isn't that part of the American Dream, of the Horatio Alger myth of rags to riches? In this country, supposedly anyone can become a millionaire. 
Whether true or not, is this really a worthy or civilized ideal? The desire to make as much money as posible, to make far more than we need even to live comfortably, is a form of greed, and the "ideal" of greed usually does more harm than good to both an indi­vidual and to a society, because it stifles self-denial, kindness, mag­nanimity, a sense of limits, or that for­gotten but still valuable phrase and idea, "social consciousness." Never­theless, one must question whether it is ethical for a professional athlete or

Pop-music-star or lawyer or doctor to make, say $100,000 to $2,000,000 a year, while many high school teachers are still making $18,000, garbage collectors less, and full-time typists as little as $9,000 a year. 
Athletes have understandably tried to justify their big salaries (and one should add that not all professional ath­letes make huge salaries) . Both Julius Erving and Steve Garvey have claimed in interviews that a player has only a relatively small number of years in which to make money; injuries can in­trude anytime to cut a career short, and the period of one's peak perfor-. mance could be just a few years. Ath­letes have to make what money than can during their relatively short playing career. 
"We dangerous I y corrupt our sense of 
proportion  in  making  
demigods  of  our  
celebrities."  

At least as ·regards the salaries of stars, this argument is not persuasive. Some of these athletes are making mil­lions of dollars in just a few years, and if they handle their money sensibly or· shrewdly, end up dometimes with im­pressive capital, investing in stock, buying restaurants and real estate and sportsgear businessess, not to mention making very lucrative advertisements. In the process, some athletes are be­coming well off indeed, compared to the average clerical worker or teacher, artist or janitor, who usually struggles to make a living. 
Athletes are our culture heroes. If they make the professional ranks and do well, ·we reward them generously, too generously, in view of the fact that they are not genuinely significant heroes. The endless inflation of sports feats and athletes by the media is a fraud that the public and particularly young people should be more critical of, so that they can reduce the corrup­tion of values in our society already induced by our national obsession with making a lot of money as the path to success. It is disturbing to watch sportscasters build up some athletic strategy or comeback or modesty in victory as if it were an achievement in character equal to the tactical miliatry genius of a Julius Caesar, the fortitude of a deafened Beethoven, the humility of a St. Francis. 
Garry Trudeau 
We dangerously corrupt our sense of 
proportion in making demigods of our 
celebrities. Human beings who receive, 
far more money or fame or power than 
anyone deserves sometimes have great 
trouble realizing that they are human 
like the rest of us, and indeed in some 
ways might lack skills, virtues, or 
values that the "average" person 
might possess. 
One of the high costs of the "crises"­of-victory psychology in sports is the deep sense of failure that it adds to a society already obsessed with winning in business, law, and other areas of en­terprise, and thus pervaded with "los~rs" and the "agony of defeat." Yet, life itself is not necessarily or primarily comprised of victory or defeat. Both "sides" can win in some basic activities or relationships. A mar­riage can tQlerate no losers it it is to survive meaningfully. In opera, ballet, jazz, public readings, everyone, includ­ing the audience, must pull together for these public arts to achieve success. 
These standards of success and fail­ure have been heavily and cruelly im­posed upon vital areas of our society, and thus have become dangerous to our personal and national well-being. If these standards were more flexible and humane, the "failures" in our society could feel more esteemed, enjoy life more, add to the joy and contentment around them, and thus help to make a happier society that we now behold. 


"Human beings .who receive far m o r e money or fame o r power than anyone deserves sometimes have great ·trouble realizing that they are human like the rest of us." 

Nor would some highly successful people feel that they are walking a tightrope. We need to put sports back in the proper perspective, so that they do not dominate our sense of significant values with falsely charged standards of success and failure.

So how is the Church doing? Not so well as it might do if its ministers and members were more open to the power of Christ and the Holy Spirit. The Church needs the prayers of its human element. to help it grow in grace, as a peace-maker and as the suffering servant of jus­tice and mercy, from one cen­tury to another. 
None of us can hang on to old truth as though it were manna bread that will stay fresh for more than a day at a time; the biblical manna came every day. It was always the same kind of food; but you could tell it was fresh if it had the morning's dew on it. Truth is true in a way that matters, not because Tradition guaran­tees it; but because today's children have tasted old­fashioned truth, and seen that it is good for them. Old truth, when it's relevant is as young and fresh as the morning.

Cheer Up! We are moving 
towards Spring. when we can rejoice in the sun, though some are closer to the sun­set and evening star than we are to the dawn. "Ripeness is all," wrote Shakespeare; but perhaps for us, "freshness" should be the watchword: fresh truth, fresh love, fresh forms of service; and all things fresh, through us, in touch with God, willing to refresh this tired old earth because of us. Off with the old! On with the new! We have songs to sing that can be sung because we were born listening. "If a man does not keep pace with his com­panions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music

which he hears, however mea­sured or far away .... " 
In an age when Christianity has a shabby look. the Church itself could be born again if young believers could lift the globe of the world to their ears, and hear the Oversoul roaring its music, like the in­coming tide of a private sea. 
A university shouldn't be a graveyard where you come to disinterr embalmed truths. It Shculd be a workshop of the mind where you are visited by revelations. It seems so to me, fresh off the plane. Perhaps instead of the winter doldrums, I'm suffering from jet-lag. and that's why Henry David Thoreau sounds good.

Swimmers hot in Ariz. 
Welsh pleased with break 
By GREG GUFFEY 
Sports Writer 
The switch from the cold and snow of South Bend to sunny Arizona was a pleasant one for the Irish swim teams during break. 
The workouts, however, were anything but easy. 
Both the mens' and womens' teams trained for two weeks in the Arizona sun over break. They also competed in a non­scoring relay meet at Arizona State with the Sun Devils and SMU. 
The swimmers worked out twice daily for a total of four hours, and the results of those sessions left coach Tim Welsh optimistic about the near fu­ture. 
"One of the keys of the season is intense training in a sustained period of time," Welsh said. "The results have been excellent, and they have also been encouraging in the perspective of how hard we have been working." 
While they did· not capture any first places in the non­scoring meet against the tough competition, the Irish did turn in several good performances. 
The womens' squad picked up four second-place finishes. The team of Christine Moston, Mary Acampora, Kathleen Quirk and Barbara Byrne was the runner-up in the 4x100 back­stroke, while Acampora, Mos­ton, Callie Bolattino and Tracy Johnson were second in the 4x100 medley relay. 
Quirk, Annette Quill, Amy Vogel, Jeanmarie Browne and Johnson were second in the 5x50 relay, as was the team of Johnson, Kelly Quinn, Quill, Vogel and Amy Darlington in the 5x100 relay. 
The top finish for the mens' squad was a fourth-place showing in the 5x100 relay event. 
"This trip has increased our confidence," Welsh said. "We were able to swim fast even though we were sore and tired. We know that when we are less sore and less tired and take the time to prepare ourselves, we can be faster. 
"This kind of meet was per­fect for our stage of develop­ment. It was good for us to be in the water with the nation's elite swimmers and to compare them to ourselves. We were able to trust ourselves and our training."

DALLAS-Forrest Gregg left his head coaching job with the Green Bay Packers and returned to his alma mater Thursday to start anew the scandal-rocked football pro­gram at Southern Methodist. 
"It's a distinct honor for us at SMU today to announce the selection and appointment of our new head football coach ­Forrest Gregg," SMU athletic Director Doug Single said at news conference. 
-

Gregg, who was the SMU football team's captain in 1955, now has the job of restoring SMU's program tainted in a play-for-pay scandal that blotted out the school's 1987 and 1988 seasons. 
"I am really pleased to be home," said Gregg, who has never coached college football, but took the Cincinnati Bengals to the Super Bowl. "I've been doing a lot of things -the Na­tional Football League for a long time -and I always thought that somewhere along

Horner signs with Cards 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS-Free-agent Bob Horner, rejecting a much more lucrative offer to play again in Japan, joined the St. Louis Car­dinals on Thursday and promised to help fill the power gap left by Jack Clark's depar­ture. 
"I know he's a great player," Horner said at a news confer­ence. "But I've had a lot ex­pected of me in the past and I've met those challenges .. . I know I can help this ballclub." 
Cardinals General Manager Dal Maxvill said Horner signed a one-year contract. Terms call for a base salary of $950,000 with various incentives en­abling him to make up to an­other $500,000. 
"There would have been no trouble signing back with Japan," Horner said. "It would have taken just one phone call. Financially, I turned down a lot of money to play in the states. But I'm satisified and happy to be back in the states playing ball. That's what I wanted to do." 
Horner made $1.8 million with the Atlanta Braves for the 1986 season, the last covered under a four-year $5.1 million contract. Mter turning down a three-year $4.5 million offer from Atlanta, and failing to find a job with another big league team in a tight free­agent markert, he signed with Yakult, of the Japanese Central League, for $2 million, includ­ing benefits and incentives. 
Yakult had offered Horner $3 million for 1988 and $10 million total in a multi-year pact. Last season, he batted .327 with 31 homers and 73 runs batted in.

Horner's agent, Bucky Woy, 
indicated that it wasn't easy to 
reject the Japanese offer. 
"I've been in this business 23 
years and I never thought I'd 
turn down $10 million," Woy 
said. "He needs one season (in 
the majors) plus a few odd days 
and then his pension is fully 
vested. He really wanted to get 
back." 
And tHe 30-year-old first baseman said he couldn't pass up an opportunity to play for St. Louis. He said he grew up following the team. 
Horner is the first major free-agent acquired by the Car­dinals since the team signed catcher Darrell Porter in December 1980. Maxvill was forced to shop the free-agent market after Clark, the first baseman who carried the team to the NL east title last season, bolted unexpectedly to the New York Yankees as a free agent. 
A veteran of nine seasons in the major leagues, Horner has a career batting average of .278 with 215 homers. In 1986, his last with Atlanta, he hit .273 with 27 home runs and 87 RBI. 
Maxvill said Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog sup­ported the decision to sign Horner. 
"Whitey has been consulted all along, is in complete agree­ment and is enthusiastic about Bob being with us, especially after a long conversation they had (Wednesday) night," Max­vill said.

Edwards boosts GPA at IU, gets reinstated to Hoosiers 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON -Fresh­man guard Jay Edwards gained reinstatement to the In­diana University basketball team Thursday after submit­ting art projects to boost his grade-point average. 
Edwards dressed Wednes­day night for the 15th-ranked Hoosiers in their victory over Wisconsin at Bloomington. 
The heralded 6-foot-4, 178­pound guard was suspended Dec. 18, the last day of semes­ter finals at IU, and has not played since the Dec. 15 win over Eastern Kentucky. 
"Jay did the work thaf was necessaary to be eligible," said Eric Ruden, assistant sports in­formation director.

Thursday night after sitting out because of academics. Edwards boosted his grade-point average by doing some extra art assign­ments over Christmas break.

continued from page 12 
Though! they all will play Sat­urday, the three will most likely not be at full strength. 
"I'm not worried about get­ting this team ready for DePaul," said Phelps. "All I have to do is have them look at the last minute-and-a-half of last month's game when we were up by six." 
In that game, played at the Rosemont Horizon on Dec. 12, Notre Dame blew a six-point lead with 1: 22 remaining in the game and eventually lost in overtime, 73-69. 
Similarly last January, th~ Irish held a 53-52 advantage with 56 seconds to go before losing the lead and the game, 59-54. Sweet revenge followed a month later when Notre Dame upset the fourth-ranked Blue Demons at the ACC, 73-62. 
The Irish would like nothing more than to repeat that scenario and split its annual se­ries with DePaul with a win on Saturday. 
"When you talk about the 
best independents in the 
country," said Phelps. "Notre 
Dame and DePaul are usually 
at the top of the list. So this 
game is played for pride -for 
the right to say you are the best 
of the independents. They come 
in here knowing they beat us 
last month at the Horizon. We 
come in knowing we did a lot 
of good things for 36 or 37 
minutes in a game, but we still 
didn't win the game." 
On Saturday, as in the 
DePaul win last month, two of 
the nation's premier guards go 
head-to-head. David Rivers 
poured in 26 points in last 
month's contest, while Strick­
land scored 22 for the Blue 
Demons. 
Strickland has had more 
trouble off the court than on it, 
however. After sitting out 
DePaul's first three games be­
cause of academic troubles, the 
6-3 junior dipped into more hot 
water after a New Year's Eve 
dormitory scuffle and an unex­
cused absence from Monday's 
practice. Strickland will ap­
pear in court next week on bat­
tery charges. He will play Sat­
urday against the Irish.

Edwards' mother, Rosemary Edwards of Marion, said she had been confident her son would regain his eligibility. 
"He's been practicing a lot by himself and I think every­thing will be OK," she said. 
Edwards, who took an art class offered to all IU students during the holiday break, had to earn a B in the course to im­prove his grade average to an acceptable 1.8. Mrs. Edwards said her son submitted eight projects for the class. 
"Talking to Jay, I know he felt certain everything went fine in the class," Mrs. Ed­wards said Wednesday night. 
Monday is the first day of the second semester at IU. 
The addition of Edwards boosted the Indiana roster back up to 12 players, and the Hoosiers probably can use the help. They began their Big Ten season 0-2 after dropping road losses to Iowa and Northwes­tern. 
Edwards was averaging 5.7 points and 14 minutes per game after playing in six of Indiana's outings, including a start against Vanderbilt and a high of 12 points. ctgainst Notre Dame. 

The freshman came off the bench to score 12 points against Notre Dame in the Hoosiers' 76­59 victory over the Irish in early December. Ten of those 12 points came in the last five minutes of the contest, and Ed­wards also came up with some fine defense to stop David Rivers and the Irish from get­ting back into the contest.

Women pound NIU, face SU tomorrow 

By THERESA KELLY Sports Writer 
Like a well-oiled machine, the Notre Dame women's bas­ketball team efficiently dis­posed of the Northern Illinois Huskies Thursday night, 89-66. 
The Irish offense, which before the contest was ranked first in the nation in field-goal percentage, did nothing to hurt that distinction. The team shot .537 from the field, including an 11-of-15 performance by for­ward Heidi Bunek. 
On the defensive end, the Irish were equally impressive, holding the Huskies to .256 in the first half and .351 for the game. 
The Irish and the Huskies played an intense, physical first half, with Northern Illinois slowing the Irish running game but unable to stop the inside at­tack as the Irish &teadily pulled away to lead 46-43 at the half. 
"We expected it to be physi­cal," said Irish head coach

Phelps gears Irish for DePaul rematch 
By BRIAN O'GARA Assistant Sports Editor 
Digger Phelps appeared relaxed, even satisfied. 
His team had just appeared sharp in a tuneup win over Yale, and his starting center and backup guard would be in practice the next day after being sidelined by injuries. 
His post-game meeting with the press was friendly, more like a fireside chat than a press conference as he discussed his team's easy 85-59 win over the Elis. Then suddenly his voice seemed stronger, and his pos­ture straightened. While Notre Dame's win over Yale was the immediate topic, its matchup with DePaul on Saturday was in the back of everyone's mind in the room. 
Phelps knew it. It was on his mind too. But he would try not to let it show. 
"We're really looking for­ward to the rematch with DePaul," said Phelps. "That's aU I have to say about Satur­day's game." 
But it wasn't. A Chicago writer brought up the play where Keith Robinson need­lessly bounced the ball in heavy lane traffic, baiting swarming guards to steal it. 
"And (DePaul) will do that," warned Phelps. "That's one of the things they do very well. (Rod) Strickland will come in and take it away." 
Moments later Phelps returned to the forbidden topic of DePaul. Gary Voce and Joe Fredrick, recuperating from a sprained ankle and tendenitis, respectively, only returned to practice Thursday and forward Mark Stevenson sustained a 14­
stitch cut in the Yale game.

be like that. It was a real dog­fight." 
As has been the case all season, Bunek and center Sandy Botham led the Irish in scoring and rebounding. Bunek tossed in 23 points and grabbed 10 rebounds while Botham to­taled 22 points and 13 boards. The Irish outrebounded the Huskies, 51-36. 
"For such a tough game, I thougi:tt we showed a lot of poise inside," said McGraw. "Sandy and Heidi were getting pushed a lot, but they didn't lose their cool. They just stayed with it and they played very well." 
The Irish were also able to connect from the outside, hel­ping to open up Botham and Bunek. Lisa Kuhns scored 14 points coming off the bench. She shot five-of-six from long range, including two-of-three three-point baskets. McGraw has brought a quicker tempo to the Notre Dame program, but the Irish are still always looking for the best shot. 
"We try to run the break off the rebound," she said. "Then if we don't get the layup, we

ND wrestlers on roll as home schedule begins 
By CHRIS KILEY Sports Writer 
Remember the Alamosa. 
That is what the Notre Dame wres­tling team will be thinking as it enters its first home dual meet of the season against Illinois State on Saturday. 
What is the Alamosa? It is the sight of Adams State University and the team's stunning 19-16 loss on its swing out west over Christmas break. The In­dians took advantage of the high Colorado altitude and a large crowd to totally surprise the Irish. 
"We ran into a hornets' nest," said Irish head coach Fran McCann. "They had 2,800 fans show up and they were the loudest, most rabid fans I've ever seen in my life. It was discouraging be­cause we had better talent than them." 
Winners for the Irish were Jerry Durso at, 134 pounds, Mark Gerardi at 158 pounds, Todd Tomazic at 167 pounds and Chris Geneser at 177 pounds. 
"They really got the crowd behind them," McCann said. "They were on their feet, .gtomping and screaming. It was incredible." 
Having received the wake-up call from Adams State, Notre Dame promptly avenged last season's loss to the Air Force Academy by crushing the Falcons, 31-9. · 
"I was really pleased how we came back after the loss to Adams State," McCann noted. 
Notre Dame clung to the emotional wave and came out of the Wyoming In­vitational with an impressive third­place finish, behind Oklahoma State and North Dakota State. Geneser won Outstanding Wrestler honors by cruis­ing through the 177-pound class. 
But perhaps the most impressive per­formance of the tournament was turned in by Gerardi''at 158 pounds. Only a freshman, Gerardi placed second, fal­ling to Oklahoma State's Vince Silva 5-3 in the finals. Silva is currently ranked second in his division national­ly. 

"Mark showed a tremendous amount of composure for a freshman," said McCann. 
Durso also placed second at 134 pounds, behind Oklahoma State's John Smith. Durso lost to the defending NCAA, Pan American, and World Champion by an 8-4 score. 
"John is probably the premier wrestler in the country right now and Jerry is the only one who has come close to beating him,'' McCann said. ''He just needs one little break. That would be a tremendous win." 
The Irish enter Saturday's contest against Illinois State with an impres­sive string of victories, yet they are leery of another Alamosa. 
"Illinois State always has some good individual wrestlers and this year won't be any different," said McCann. "They're good at the upper weights, but they can really get things off to a good start with John Chapman wrestling at 118 pounds. This is an important match because it's in our region and will have an impact on seedings." 
As with all home matches, McCann would like to see a strong show of sup­port for the Irish. 
"We'd like to have a good turnout be­cause it is an important match for us," 
McCann said. "And I'll tell you right now, the way the crowd was at Adams State had an impact. It sure affected us." 
fhe nratch is Saturday night at 7 in the Auxiliary Gym of the Joyce ACC.
