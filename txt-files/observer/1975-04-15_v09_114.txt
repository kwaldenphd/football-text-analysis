The SLC Planning and Policy Committee released a report yesterday recommending that present visitation hours be con­tinued next year. The report also recommended that provisions be made which would allow visitation hours to be extended by hall rectors on certain occasions. 
The 18-page report was distributed to SLC members Tuesday and will be discussed at the April 21 meeting. 
The report traces the history and rationah• behind the adoption of visitation hours at Notre Dame. 
~lrPssing the needs for freedom and privacy. the report states there is no persuasive argument for changing the times which are currently in effect. The visitation hours will continue to be from noon to midnight on Sunday through Thursday and from noon to 2 a.m. on Friday and Saturday. On homP football Saturdays, visitation hours will begin at 10:30 a.m. 
ThP eommittee also recom­nwnds that hall rectors be allowed to "••stablish a mPehanism for making spPcific and infrequent 
•·xh'nsions of \'isitation hours." In addition. thP rt>port supports 24­hour an•as within thf' halls to ease lh•· "unnaturalness of an abrupt, dock-dPtPrminPd Pnd to study. discussion and relaxation among nwn and womPn._" 
Th•· n·comnwndation providing lor oeeasional I'Xtt'nsions of 'isitation hours suggests a one­\ Par trial pPriod for tht> idea. 
A third recommendation of the committee would give jurisdiction in enforcing visitation hours to the hall judicial systems. The rl'port notes, "The value of the program will only be realized if students actively support its observance." 
To implement this hall control of parietals hours, the committee listed four guidelines: 
I l That each hall select a hall judicial board; 
2) That the Student Government Judicial Coordinator and the Dean of Students meet with each hall board to discuss the duties and responsibilities; 
3) That the hall president, rector and chairman of the hall judicial board be empowered to suspend visitation hours within a specified section, floor or entire hall should student enforcement prove inef­fective; and 
4 l That the SLC publicly question administrators of this system once each semester. 
Fnl"tn·,·,.m,·nt a 'ma.ior stt>p' 
Sr. John Miriam Jones, assistant provost and chairperson of the committee, stated yesterday that putting enforcement of parietals on a hall level was a "major step" in reconciling the controversy over the visitation issue. 
Jones noted another major 
achievement in the report is the 
"separation of the parietals issue 
from the sexuality issue." The

report states that the two issues 
tend to overlap at times but should 
not be considered the same issue. 
"A violation of visitation hours is 
obvious simply by a student's 
presence in the hall. His or her 
untimely presence is not 
presumptive evidence for sexual 
misconduct," the report says. 
"Violations of sexual proscriptions 
are indicated by other kinds of 
evidence which, when present, 
give sufficient cause for serious 
action on the part of the Univer­
sity." 
The report also details the 
inadequacies of two extreme views on parietals. The first view equates visitation hour violations with second misconduct. The second view states that students shouldnot be limited in conducting 
their private social lives. 
In compiling the report, the SLC committee contacted student leaders, faculty members and University administrators who served on the SLC during the late 1960's and into 1970 as well as in­terviewing current hall n'l'lors. Over forty persons were in­terviewed. 
I'a l'it•ta I sm·,·t·~· takt•ll 
The committee also conducted a 
survey of students last spring in co­
operation with the Sociology 
Dt>partment. Over one thousand 
students were questioned in the 
survey and 649 responded. The 
respondents were from 17 of the 
University's 20 residence halls. 
According to the student survey, 
only 8 percent of the students 
approve of the present parietals 
system. Fifty-two percent \lantPd 
no visitation hour limits, 28 percent 
wanted weekend restrictions 
Pliminated and 8 percent favored 
an t>xtension of the present hours. 
Four percent expressed a desire 
for a reduction of hours. 
Of the students surveyed, 95 
percent stated that the University 
should be willing to experiment 
with visitation hours. 
The report notes a split between 
the rectors as to whether or not they agreed with the general principle of limiting visitation. 
The rectors opposed to limiting visitation hours saw enforcement of the regulations as a major P.roblem. According to the report, 
Rectors made the point that students on their own do not take responsibility for actively en­forcing parietals among fellow students. Parietals are either self­enforced or enforced by staff members who may have to assumt> enforcement responsibilities for a rule they do not themselves sup­
port." This group of rectors also saw a preoccupation with the rules in­stead of a desire to develop t>ducational programs of human interaction between the sexes which would benefit all students, the report states. Rectors who favor limitation of visitation hours noted that unrestricted parietals could possibly present freshmen and other underclassmen with freedoms they may be unable to handle, the report says. This group of rectors also saw parietal hours as an aid to con­trolling the tempo of hall life. "Hall activities, particualrly social events, usually do not begin until parietals begin and ordinarily such programs end when visitation ends," the report notes. Former SLC members told the committee that the visitation hours help in the so(·ial and intellectual growth of the residents. "Hall life and communtiy spirit were seen as benefiting from visitation ... It was noted that lhl'rt' was no place on campus other than the halls where students could come together inordinary life situations," the report states. According to the report, the SLC mt>mbers also noted the reluctance of students to enforce parietals hours. "Students never clearly accepted responsibility for supervising or enforcing the

Irish Wake planned for Stepan Center 
by Chris Meehan Starr Reporter 
Since Michigan authorities have denied the liquor license request for this year's Irish Wake which was scheduled to be held in Niles, the An Tostal party will now be held at Stepan Center on Saturday, April19, according to An Tostal Co­chairman Bob Quakenbush. 
Plans for the event were initiated in January, but the organizers have met obstacle after obstacle. First, original plans for an outdoor party undera tmtwere hampered by the lack of an ac­ceptable location. Then attempts to set up a 21-bar in Stepan also proYed a failure, because of the legal problems. A site was finally located for an annual event in Michigan, but since it was im­possible to obtain a liquor license, the Irish Wake has found its home in Stepan Center. 
A display of fireworks behind Stepan will mark the beginning of the Wake at 8:30p.m. Admission is $1 at the uoor and attmdane(' is not restricted to couples, as was last year's celebration. The at­mosphere will also be more in­formal than last year's, somewhat along the lines of the North Quad Party with non-alcoholic refresh­ments, according to Irish Wake committeeperson Betsy Kall. 
Last year's event differed from prPvious Irish Wakes in that it was first not to be held at the Armory in South Bend and did not serve beer. This was because of the recent legal liability placed on the con­sumption of alcohol.

The Social Commission has worked in conjunction with Om­budsman to establish the Quickie Bus Sl·n·icl'. Fuchs said that the Commission plans to continue working with Notre Dame but also to retain its autonomy. 
Commenting on the Com­mission's work during the past year Fuchs said, " I think this year has gone extremely well. I set out to give the Social Commission a firm hold on the campus and I think we did achieve what we set out for. People have told us that !hi'.\' think we have made the campus a little better, they think the social life has improved quite a bit. At !east people know that there is a Social Commission; last year they didn't," she said. 
The appointments for next year's officers will be announced on Monday, April 21. "I hope the new ol'l'it·Prs will help the Com­mission to grow, to become better, and to receive greater support," Fuchs noted. 

Another break with the past is the addition of a t·om·t·rt band
from Chicago -Pezband. Playing all original music, Pezband is often on tour and has served as a back­up band for t.he well-known group 
"('hicago." 'fhe group has a stage

h~· l\lllurt>t>ll Flynn

t'ongn•ssman Mike McCormack, l'hairman of the House sub­t'ommitlt>P which is drafting I 'ongn·ss · l'nt>rgy policy and one of only two scil•ntists in Congress, last night called upon the ,\nwrican govPrnmPnt "lo develop now a systems approach to an inh•gratPd national energy policy to provide lhP Pnt>rgy that we will m•pd in thP future." 
Spl•aking before a crowd of approximately 150 in the auditorium of the Center for l'ontinuing Education. McCor­mack statl•d. "If WP do create such an mPrgy policy. and if WP im­ph•mpnt lht> programs which will t'arry it into pffect. lhe pl•oplP of this country can have adequate PnPrgy. PnvironmPntal. protPc­t ional. and Pconomic stability." 
ThP lll•mocratic rPpresentative from W<lshington StatP credited thP ,\rah oil Pmbargo with ac­t'omplishing "what many years of "arnings by sciPntists could not do. It bas madP AmPricans aware that the •·m•rg~· rPsourcPs of this nation an• not unlimited." :\ld 'oramck obserwd.

l\ld'ormack ctPscribed lhe n<·PdPd na I ional mPrgypolicy as "a sPI of d~·namic guidelinPs and l'ritPria which can change and t·\·o]n• as m•w knowlPdge becomes arailabll'. and n('W situations 
":\ny l'n(•rgy policy must be hasPct upon lhP lwst scientific and <'ngint•Pring facts availablP." the ('(mgrPssman continuPd. noting thai such a policy "must rt>quire lhP optimum conservation prac­1icPs Ihrough every step of P\'Prything W<' do, but especially in thP conversion. transmission. and\ consumption of l'nergy." 
1\kCormack also stated that a national mergy policy must allow a largP sPgmPnt of our people to continue to aspire to and strive for a highPr standard of living," and dtPd a three-way balance to be m;lintainPd among the conversion, transmission. and consumption of Pn<'rgy. PnvironmPntal concerns, and "a stable and responsive I'COnomic system." 
In addition. McCormack called for a policy that would provide "pm•rgy splf -sufficiency for this nation ... by the vear 2000," and "providl' ·for an i.tltimate reliance upon inPxhaustible supplies of 
•·ssPntially non-polluting sources of <'nt-rgy." 
Fntnn• solar SOIII'l't•s l'itt>d 
Thn•p possible sourres of future mPrgy for which Congress has organized research development, and demonstration programs, said 1\lel'ormack. are solar energy, geothermal <'nergy, and nuclear fusion. 
"Solar Pnergy will clearly play an important role in our future." 1\ll'Cormack stalled. "We are rPquesting $143.7 million for solar Pnergy research .. .for fiscal year 1976." 
"In the (ieothermal Research. llPvelopmPnt. and DPmonstration :\l'l of 1974. our goal is to have from six to tPn geothermal plants on the lim• bv 1980," he added. 
"W(: haw almost doubled our fusion H and D funding this year m·pr last." 1\kCormack continued, "and I Pxpect WP will almost doublP it again--to about $200 million--for fiscal 1976." 
"Om• gl'nPral misconception plaguing policy makers," 1\ll·t 'ormack warnPd, "is the idea that n•sparch and development.

Predicting that the current recession will deepen before the economy recovers, Robert Diet­sch, former business-economic editor for the Scripps-Howard News Service and 1975 Woodrow Wilson Fellow at St. Mary's, noted that the recent tax rebate would provide stimulant lo lh(• ailing American economy. 
"I believe the recession will get somewhat worse, hut that there will be an economic upturn later this year," Dietsch commented. Dietsch further believes that the upturn. however, will not be ,·igorous. but will be stimulated by the congressional $23 billion tax cut as well as an increase in consumer optimism. Dietsch views Ford's ongmal cut proposal as inadequate and rather ad­vocates, in regard to government spending, a smaller defense budget and an increase in areas of domestic spending. 
Confronting the energy issue, Dietsch offered, "I don't think we will be seeing much energy legislation on Capitol Hill this year. In the past, Nixon and Ford wt>re ahead of Congress with alternatives to the energy situation. but the average politician in Washington these days does not view it as a 'crisis' any longer. \\"(• are reaching a period of greater negotiation with the Arab oil-producing countries."

ternoon, the 'C' game, provided 
somP surprisingly good fun­
damental rugby displayed by the 
Irish 'greenies". Tht> ND'C' side 
scored well and held the JC unit to 
but three points, showing their 
quick adaptation to the sometimes 
confusing and m ~·sterious game of 
rugby. Scoring for ND were: John 
Norris, Greg Zipf, and Erik Snyder 
who handled the kicking duties.
