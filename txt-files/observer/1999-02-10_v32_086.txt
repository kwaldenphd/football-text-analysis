Cushwa-Leighton lounge closes for renovations 
By ANGELA WOGATZKE 
l\iews Writer 

Hrnovation ol' the after-hours study lounge in the basenHrnt of Saint Mary's Cushwa-Leighton Library lrngan l\londay. 
The lounge may reopen by sei,rns­tnr's encl and will !'nature new rom­pnLers and a host ol' other improvP­ments. 
Sinr,e tho project. received a Board of Governance nndorsenrnnt last year, the library staff, Information Tnchnology of'f'icn and Building Scrvic1:s coordinators have bnen work­ing to provide students with a high­quality work space that is cornf<Jrt­able, inviting and meets study needs. 
"Studen ts will be exlrr.mely pleased with Lim results of this rnnovation." said Sister Bernice llollenhorst, librarv din\ctor. 
The" foc_ilitics changes include tho acldilion or 36 computer workstations. 
"We designed thu lab with an rye on supporting both traditional and cur­rrmt methods of scholarship. Wn think this onvironmont will provido a more apµealing atmospherr. fur scholarship than tlrn morfl traditiorrnl rows and rows of compulr.rs sort of computer lab,"' said Joel Cooper, dirr.ct.or of Information Technology. 
"Also. from a practical point of' view, the air handling equipnrnnl in th1\ library has been upgraded so the view lab will UH comfortahl(1 year-round, unlike llw currnn1 compntf1r lahs in Le r-.tans Ila.II," he continued. 
The north and west wall of tlrn loungo will !w lirrntl with new work­spaces and will be dcsigne<l for those wanting to study, access thn Internet 
or complPlr; printing jobs. Two sys­tnms-f'urniturn islands will !'ill 11111 rnn­t,•r spacn. 
"WI' d<•sig1wd SJHll:t•s wlwrP onn pPr­son could work 011 a co111p11lPr and othnr spacns wlwrP sPvnral studPnts might spr<•ad out and !work! r.ollaho­rativnly. In addition.

Additionally, prinlnrs will hn 1·011­nenn<l to 1·om1H1tP.rs in tlw loungn. eliminating the 1wnd to wait f'or a printnr in Ln Mans. 
Nnw f'urniturn, Pnd tablPs and lamps will create a mon\ romfortabln at.mos­phnn; !'or lhosn in Urn loungn. Tim vending arna will lw loc:aLnd in tlw sarn,; placn and will hn updated l.o rnmain up-to-daf.n with tlw rnst of' lhn changc~s. Arna carpnting will also bn adcfod. 
"l think it. repr<\s1mts a rnal commit­nrnnt to the st11dm1ts of' Saint Mary·s," Cooper said. 
Thn loungn renovation will continue throughout Lhis scmostcr, and altlwugh 110 claw ol' complntion has b1w11 announc:nd, projnct lnadnrs hopP to opcrn thn facilit.y hy finals W(1ck.

Gipper Be Gone 
I have two bones to pick with the Gipper, that is, tho anonymous author of' Scholastic's Campus \Vatch. For om~. lw's not funny; and 
two, he's tastnless. 

The Gipp appanmtly lwlinYns 1hat he is provid­ing an opportunity for us "to have a good laugh at oursC'lvns from timr to time." But in reading the last rendition nf this cam­pus tradition I found little to laugh at. 
Perhaps, if prescntr.d in the right light, a story of' a girl passing ou1 at 


Eddie Llull 
Vicwpoim Editor 

Mass could be funny. I tried my best to find Uw humor in tht' Gipp's storyt<-iling, I really di<l, but my pfforts were in vain. If you haven't read this Campus Watch yet, pick up a copy or the most recent Scholastic and you'll ser what I nwan. 
First of all, passing out docs not spice up much or anything -for the girl or the people that are around (unless a number of friends are waiting in the wings, markers in hand ... but this is Mass, so lot's move on). She just passPs out, and that's it. Whoopec. 
Secondly, and I understand if it was simply a mathematical error made in haste, but I'm pretty sure the Mass has been around a whole 2000 years and not 1500 years as the Gipp would havr, us believe. No, the Mass wasn't a sixth-century invention dreamed up by some innovative Christian go-getters. 
Lastly, for most of the Catholics out there, the Mass is more than "a pretty boring cere­mony." It is, in fact, the core of our faith. 
Enough with that issue. The Gippcr then moved on to make a personal attack on Viewpoint columnist Cappy Gagnon who had previously criticized the Gipp in one of his columns. Defonding himself would have been one thing, but making a ptffsonal attack on Cappy's profession and what he has done with his life is an entirely different matter. Especially with Cappy. who has been a bright spot in the Viewpoint pages for almost a year now. and who is well-respected at his job where he is hardly "the head of thr. Gr.stapo" -just ask any of his studr.nt r.mploynes. 
Nevnrthdess, in the end it appears that Cappy's whole point about the Gipper was proven by the Cipprr himself'. Instead of pok­ing fun at Notre Dame, and getting us to laugh at oursPlves, the Gipp has resorted to clwap attempts at humor and wrongful per­sonal attacks showing that he has become, as Cappy wrott\, "an anonymous ncgativist who blatlrnrs in Tim Scholastic." 
It saddens me wlrnn I think back to tlrn laughs the Gippcr has supplind us with in the past. Campus Watch has brought us tales of 
smoking shC'ep in Zahm, Wake-breaking golf cart drivers and the olT-the-lield exploits of' many a football playrr. 
At least thPre aren't manv more issues of Scholastic until our "anonyrnous negativist" will step down in favo.r of a new Gipper who 
will hopef'ully refrain from pnrsonal attacks and won't trample all over sacred religious rituals. 
The uiews expressed in the Inside Column are those o.f lhe aulhnr and nol necessarily those of'J'he Obsen1er.

Students force negotiations regarding sweatshop conditions 
W ASI-IINGTON 
Student activists signed an agree-. rnent with Student Affairs administra­tors shortly bPforP 1 a.m. Tur,sday, ending an 85-hour sit-in by approxi­mately 25 students in the ufficn of' Georgetown University Prcshfont Leo O'Donovan, S.J. The details ol' the compromise will be announced at a rally scheduled for 4 p.m. Tuesday in Healy Circle. 
The students had occupif)cl ()'Donovan's office since 11 :50 a.m. Friday in an effort to l'orce tlrn univer­sity to negotiate with tlrnm about issu<'S rf'iatnd to working condilions in the factories that make collegiate apparfll. 
()'Donovan was out of town for the entire sit-in an<l is expected to rnturn to campus Ttrnsclay. 
SevHr.il members of the Georgetown Solidarity Committee organized the sit-in and represented the students in 


The solidarity (:ommitto<) had been attempting tn porsuade tho university to rejoct a conirovr.rsial codn of con­duct released in Novembnr for appar­el manufacturers. 
The committee maintained that thn code, the product of a task force made up of represnntativrs from 14 member schools ·of the Collegiate Licensing Company, did not do 
enough to counteract swnatshop labor practices. The licnnsing company acts as a go-lrntwcnn for clothing manu­facturnrs andapproximately 170 col­leges and universities. 
The Georgetown activists· major concnrn this wePknnd was that tlw code did not requirn licnnsnd compa­nies to publicly disclose tlw locations of tlrnir f'actorios. While thr solidarity committ<rn outlinod otlrnr criticisms in a pamphlet distributed two Wf'.cks ago, disclosurn hncame the studnnts' primary dnmand because, they said, it was essential for achinving their oth<)r goals, which includ11 improving wages and strictly onforcing compli­ance with tlrn cod<i. 
"Anyone who has studied this issw· will toll you disclosurn is tlrn most importa11t thing that allows otlwr things to happPn," Andrnw Milmore (SFS ·en). prnsiden1 or tlw solidarity committno said. 
¦ DARTMOUTH COLU:GE Students rescue avalanche victims 
IIANOVER,N.11. 
Seven Dartmouth alumni helped rnscue college students after they were trapped under a snow-covered northern California mountain by an avalanche on Saturday. The four students from the University of California at Berkeley were sledding on a small hill at Donner Summit in northern California when they were hit by an avalance and buried under six feet of heavy snow. After a four-hour struggle, one of the students, llarry Eichelberger, was able to free himself and seek help. He ran to a Dartmouth Outing Club cabin less than a quarter mile from the scene. Eddie Gilmartin, '91, one of tho alumni staying at the cabin, said the student "pounded on the window and screamed for help." The group gathered all available tools and ran to the scene. Using rakes, brooms, and mops as probes, they were able to free the other three victims. Derek Lerch, Marisa Nelson, and Malcolm Russell I I art, after nearly two hours. 
¦ UNIVERSITY OF fUJR!DA Move to earn bachelors degree debated 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. 
Community college students will bP able to earn bachelor's 
degrees without moving to a f'our-ycar university campus if 
a proposed bill makes it through the legislature this year. 
Wlrnn the session begins March 2, legislators are scheduled 
to consider the bill ofSen. Donald Sullivan, H-St. Petersburg, 
who is proposing students bn able to earn four-year degrees 
on community college campuses. The bill, which passed 
through the Senate Education Committct! last week, should 
have little trouble passing in the I louse, said Pnter Dyga, leg­
islative aid to Hep. Bob Casey, R-Gainesville. For the past 
several years, legislators and educational lnaders have 
expressed concern that four-year dngrees are not accessible 
enough and that four-year institutions arc becoming too 
crowded. Casey, who heads the House Colleges and 
Univnrsities Committco, has br.en studying the effectiveness 
and financial feasibility ol"joint-usc facilities.

¦ IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY Newspaper lawsuit reaches settlement 
IOWA CITY, Iowa 

The Ames Tribune and Iowa State University student-run newspaper, The Iowa Stat!\ Daily, settled a thre<\-and-a-half' year court battle on Feb. !i. Tlw original lawsuit was filed in 1995 by the Tribune, which bdiev11d that the Daily's non­profit status and university funding gave it an unfair com­petitive advantage. Tlw Tribune also attacked the Daily's refusal to release the salaries of its non-student general managers or disclose somo financial information. "W<1 had two goals in this lawsuit, to get access to basic business records and to determine if the Iowa State Daily is part of the university," said Gary Gerlach, publislwr and co-owrwr of the Tribum1. The Iowa State Daily agreed to contribut<! $50,000 to a scholarship established by the Tribunt! in tlw name or the late David Bdin. an owner of the Tribune. Tlw Daily also will pay approximatdy $54,000 in kgal fpes and agre<1d to abide by the state's opcm-mcPtings.

any prospective students arrived on Saint Mary's campus this year forMtours. Last fall introduced !he l~rgest freshman class 1n the_ history of the 
school. This overwhelming increase supports thE: claim th~t more women in America are interested in gaining a college education, especially at a liberal arts institution. 





Enrollment on the rise 
Notre Dame, Saint Mary's female enrollment increases in recent years 
By JESSICA DELGADO News Writer 

Women have become the dominant sex on collegfl campuses during the last threfl years. comprising 
55.5 percnnt ul' undergrad­uate students in 1995, acr.ording to nationwide statistics, 
It's a far cry from the late 1800s, when women accounted for 21 percent of undergraduates. Back then, preparing for th!~ir expected societal role took precedence over receiving a strong education. 
"Republican education prepared girls for roles as wives and mothers," according to the Women's College Coalition. "Seminaries educated unmarried women for the only socially accepted occupation, teaching." 
This time in history gave rise to all-women collegt)s, which wenci unique because they finally offered women an equal opportu­nity to higher education, which had previously been reserved for mnn. 
"They were trained in many of the traditionally male disciplines, but an all-women college became the only place that a women could studv sci­ence, mathematic;, law and philosophy," according to the Women's College Coalition. 
During times of national fiscal depression, the per­centage of women in undergraduate programs reached an astounding 47 percent. 

"You have to understand what was happening at this time," explained Susan Alexander, professor of sociology at Saint Mary's. "The f'irst wavo of the women's movement was in cffoct with a push for suf­frage and a conscier1C:n

Whiln men worn away at war this increased thr~ opportunities for women in the classroom setting. But by the 1950s, the amount of women undergraduates had decreased to 31 per­cent. African-American women, however, made up an amazing 62.4 percnnt of' undergraduates in black colleges. 
At this time men were 
returning from the war and 
the women's place was 
consequently moved from 
the classroom back to the 
honrn. 
Hy t.lrn 1970s, the second phase of' the women's movement reached full morrrnntum and issLws likP co-education becamn a reality. Not only were women pursuing collegn degreP-s, but many wont further in their conquest and comphited tlrnir mas­ter's degree or obt.ainml a Ph.D.

WASIIINGTON 

President-Clinton moVf)d ahead with plans to nominate Richard Holbrooke to be ambassador to the United Nations after 
Holbrooke agreed Tuesday to pay $5,000 to sett!P civi I charges that he violated fedAral ethics laws. 


"I will soon  Clinton  
send  to  the  
Senate  my  nomination  of  

Richard Holbrooke," Clinton said in a statement issued from I.he White House shortly after the federal lawsuit and settle­ment were filod simultanoously in U.S. District Court here. 
The veteran 57-year-olrl diplo­mat denied in the settlement the Justice Department's allegations that he improperly contacted a lJ.S. diplomat on behalJ of his cmploynr. Instead, Holbrookc saicl hP was acting as a special government employee asked to explain U.S. policy to Asian om­cials. 
The Justice Department said Bolbrooke did not willfully vio­late the law barring former gov­ernment officials from contact­ing ex-colleagues about business for one year after leaving gov­ernment. The department also said the contact produced no direct financial gain for Holbrookc or his employer. the invt>stmfrnt banking firm of Credit Suisse First Boston. 
"Frum building lasting pAace in Bosnia to sParching for a political settlement in Kosovo, to finding a workable solution in Cyprus, Richard Holbrooke's intellect. vigor and diplomatic skills have significantly ndvanced the values and the interests of' t11e American peo­ple," Clinton said. 
It has been eight months since 
Clinton first picked Iiolbrooke, 
the chief architect of' the 1995 
Bosnia peacn accord and last 
fall's ceaselirc in Kosovo, for tlw 
U.N. post formerly hell] by Energy Sccretnry Bill tlichardson. 
Holhrookn said in a stai<'m<'nl Tuesday tlrnt ho settled Uw ethics suit ''in ord<lr to allow my 
nomination to proceed." 
"I now look forwnrd to appear­ing before the Senate Foreign Helations Committee for the con­firmation hearings," he said. 
But Senate Foreign llelations Committee Chairman Jesse llelms, R-N.C.. who has taken no position on the nomination, appeared in no hurry to sched­ule hearings. Before lwarings, "we're going to very closely examino tho Justice Departmcmt report, ... to walk through tlrnir investigation stop by step," said

Ile and his follovvers demand absolute sub­mission. a stifling uniformity, cvrn though they masquerade under a thin veil of variety. They stand against humanity and humanity's progress.

Against IIPll's Gates stands tlw Catholic Church. The Clrnrch holds, in sacred dPposit, tlw truth about the mys­tery of man, aboul tlw mystery of nature, and about the mystery of God. Yet she lacks a full undnrstanding of tlw trea­sures tn which she holds tlrn kPy. In con­seqwmce, she encouragos every human pursuit that will lead lo sud1 full under­standing. Tlwrrl'orn, if sonwtimcs slrn has had to tak!1 extrenw measures against intellPctual pridn and intPllectual dishonesty, it has always bePn with the good or humanity at h<;,wt. Tirnh~ssly she warns her children, and humanity in gfm<)ral. against lhe activities of the ovil organization, whkh takes advantagn of human l1ubris to shackle, with chains of sin, tlrn grnatness that is the. human mind. 
Those who havn bem1 bless£id by God with the gift of a mind and with u;e opportunity to usn it haw alyYays bnen tempted by tlrn Devil to us·P· these talents for ignohl£\ or unworthy purposes.

That His Will Be Done 
A small group gathered outside or Washington l!all to pray before the sp,1akers on the non-discrimination clause spoke. As I joined them for a quick decade of thP rosary, I noticed 01w ol' my old roommates sitting on the steps. It seemed impossible that sho had not noticPd mCT as well, and I wondernd what slrn thought. Did she f'nel I had dcsert.nd, gone over to the "enemy'"? Joined tlrn forcns or those who would opposn justice, the champions of' oppression? I won­d!'rnd what slw saw when she looked at our clustnr, if slw assumed animosity in our llail Marys. /\nd I trembled. 
I trembled bncausCT this issue, and many moral-political issuus like it, should not bn about sidns. /\l the corn, they are not about sides at all. hut about souls. Morality is not a cudgel with which to bash others; it is a guide to "be holy as your llnavenly Father is holy" (Matt. S:48). And our business is not Urn businnss nl' winning argurnr.nts but of winning souls. People are quick to attempt to demolish each othnr in paper arguments; to stand behind a-statement and firn argu­ments across no man's land is, however. thn easy approach and it leads to wreckagn. Applying pnt phrases lo "tlrn opposition" from thn comfort or onn's own circle is a coward's gamn. What takes tnw courage is to lovn all, oppon(mt and companion alikn, and to work for the holirrnss and salvation of all souls. 
And so I stood, lwad howPd, wondnring if' my presence was woumling my roommalP, and r prayPcl that c;od's will be do1w at this, Our Lady's univnrsity. Such a pPtition. whnn praynd l'rom the heart, is not, I think, objec­tionable to any good person, to a11yo1rn who is trying to work out what our Faith dnmands in this day and agn. 
And anyo1rn with a soul -that i11cl11clns every human pnrson -has lwnn r.rna!Pd good and is calh•d lo "work oul your salva­tion in fnar and trnmbling" (l'hii. 2: 1 :11. With this in mind. I ask that all or us. all thosP connnctnd in any way to Our l.ady's University, ardently lwg Our 1.orcl that llis will bn done in this and 1!vnrv matlf'r. Ask llim when you fast. Ask llim.in llis Eucharistic l'rns1\ncn in your cha pPI. Ask llim with llis mother in Lim Bosary. And ask llim in the way you liv11 your lives and low all your neighbors. /\skin all humility, as Our Lord Ilimsnlf prayed to I lis Fath;\r and ours: "Not my will, but Yours hn do1w."

Knockin' on the JACC's Door 
Bob Dylan arrives on campus this Sunday to play his first show ever at ND 
Wlrnn ltobert Zimmerman left his hometown ol' llibbing, Minnesota to become Bob Dylan to tl111 world, it marked a grnat transitory moment in tlrn history ol' mod­nm music. As lw vied f'or sucrnss in Nnw York, Dylan rPvolutinniziid ro('k'n'rnll by bringing its roots out in his musi!'. Dylan was inspired by th<' l'olk heroes of his vouth -Woodii' (;uthriP and company. By combining thPir sty!<• with his own poetic lyri!'.al g<'11i11s, Dylan brought mnaning and passion to a gnnrP which, until tlwn, had lwnn rharactnrizod largely by tlw hip-wig­gling ol' rlean-rut Elvis Presley. Dylan !wcamt> a poster boy for the protest move­111cn t: his first completely original album, The f.'reewhepfin · !Job JJylan, is charged with political nrns­sages and tlw classic: l'olk hits ''Blowin' in tlrn Wind" and "I lard Rain's a Gonna Fall." lfoyond prot<1st and politil'.s, llylan's ballads and love songs were so incred­ibly passionate that listr.ncrs wished they were the subjnct of his adoration or rnjoiced that they W("re not Llw targPt of his biting insults. As Dylan's earner went on and his ramn grew, h11 nvcntually til'(~d of his status as "supor-hippin," the embodim<'nt of' tho entirn prot1-1st movement ol' the era. llis popularity ('pl) as his music became more like that of ot.lrnr singers. Critics saw a lack of originality in his bland, unoffonsive lyrics. It se. emed that his career was on the rocks. 


Dylan's artistic lull did not last long, however. llpon rplnasing Hlood on the Trarks, it seemed that Dylan wafi back on top. Tlw album f'ollowed his separation l'rom his wifn Sara, and oxplorr.d love and loss as 1HJ othnr album has, before or sinc11. Dylan's touring with Tlw Band was by this point l1-1gendary, and his popularity was possi­bly at an all time high. 
J\ft11r his divorce, though, Dylan's music began a tailspin. The eighties were not kind to him, although he man­aged to write a few great ballads. Dylan tournd for long stretches with Tom Petty and the !l(rnrtbr<'ak<'rs, not to mention tho Grateful Dead. 
In I988. he embarked on the Ncvu Ending Tour, and has been on the road virtually non­stop sincn th(-m. 'J'his is the tour that brings him to South Bend this ,\'Pek,mcL 
In tlw past 10 ynars, Dylan's rnun·elous song stylings havP lrn(m less prolific and pointed than tlrny were in his oarly days wlrnn his emotional 
be matched. Beyond mern musicianship, Dylan Pmhod­ies a poetic genius and nloquPnn· that cuts to tlw !wart 


but leaves c111n wanting morP. SlwPr brillian1·p is his legacy to the world.

Swinging into town to open is former Stray Cats frontman Brian Setzer 


Hey Ifopcats, grab your kitten ·cause sw1-·ng's_ the thing! Tlrn new swing craze has caused new bands to spring up everywhere. The Brian Setzer Orchestra, however, is no newcomer when it comes to swing. Their third, and most recent release, is entitled The Dirty Boogie. The album revolves around former Stray Cat Brian Setzer. The pompadour sporting, Gretsch guitar slinging, hypertattooed guitarist. is backed up by a 17-piece band of bass, drums, blaring trumpets, mellow saxophones, and big bad bones. Rolling Stone magazine points out that it would be easy to dismiss Setzer as an (1pportunist jumping on the swing bandwagon, but he has Benn playing his unique combo of swing and rockabilly for years, Previous Brian Setzer orchestra re!Pases include 1996's Guitar Slinger, and 1 <J<J4's self-titled debut, Brian Setzer Orchestra. The Dirty !Joogie contains a fine mix of original new tunos and covers of old songs. Most notably, Setzer has covered "Jump Jive An' Wail," originally performed by Louis Prima back in the day. Many may recognize this song from the GAP commercial entitled "Khakis Swing." The l'ast pulsing rhythm ol' this song will surely blnw your wig. The B.S.O. has also rncord­ed the old Stray Cats hit "Hock This Town." llorns have been added to this famous rockabilly tune making it even more danceable. If the CD does one thing for you, it will make you want to clancn. Its blaring horns, fast guitar solos, and linger snapping beats will get any Lindy Hopper off of his stool and ont11 his groundpads. 
In onB of' the CD's slownr songs, S<itzPr rovPrs "Since I Don't llav(l You," originally pnrf'ormml by the Skyli1rnrs. Il<)pcats, mak!i sure to grab your kitten and dance close with her for this song. Original songs arrangnd by Sntz<'r include "This Cat's On A llot Tin Roof," and tho brassy goodness of' "As Long t\s I'm Singin·." 
A number of' guest musicians urn l'catured on the new album, adding even morn depth to llw danceable mix of guitar and horns. No Doubt lead singP-r Gwnn Stel'ani is foaturnd on "You're The Boss," wlwrn slrn sings to Setzer, "Maybe tonight, I'll be thn boss/tlwn tomorrow night, I'Li. be thn boss." The Hoyal Crown llnvun's Eddie Nichols, and Meghan Ivey of' tlrn Eddin llPPd Big Band sing back-up vocals on ".Jump .livfi i\n' Wail." 
This CD is a rockin' good timn. It will mak<' you dance, mak11 you sing, makl' you jump nn · jivP, and most importantly, mak1\ you smiln with a d(~sirn to get on that dance floor and show off your movns. For those of you Just g1\tting into swing, this CD is a must-havn. For those of' you just getting into swing, this CD is a must-have. For thosn of' you 11ttnnding tlrn 13ob Dylan con­cert, I'll sno you tlwrn! And for thos11 of' you not attending this Sunday I'll son you on the danrn floor. Until next time Cats and Kittl'ns.

The tN1m has playf'd with recklrss abandon and stuck Duke with its OJJly loss this year. I see them struggling uown the road Lo the Final Four in the Midwest bracket. Stanford is the most experiencr-,d team in the nation. with startPrs who remmnbf'r losing last year's serni['iuals 86-8:i in ovr,rtime to Kentucky, the evrntual national champion. With Arthur Lee at point guard and three other all-Pac 10 starters in the mix, the Cardinal will rebound from a dismal loss to UConn and be a contender in the tournament. But in the South bracket. they will have the toughest road of any top seed in the Final Four. 
L'Conn has the lrnst 1-2 punch in college IJas­kctball with Richie llamilton and Khalid El­Amin. Until losing llamilton to injury. they
• 
were undefeated. and always pulling out a win 
despite several close games. Seeded in the 
West, UConn will have a relatively easy road to 
the Final Four. 
Of the rnmaining teams, Michigan State sticks out. Mateen Cleaves. the most talented player in college basketball this side of Hamilton. can take over any game at any time. The Spartans playrid an extremely difficult schedule and are just now beginning to shine. They will not get a top seed, but they will advance to the Final Four. 
Maryland has talent at every position but is not a stellar club. It vvill advance far in the tournament. but does not have a star player to take it to the Final Four. 
Kentucky. fresh off its national champi­onship, has turned in another fine regular-sea­son performance. but the team does not have the same talent it had last vear. Without Cameron Mills to toss in a three-pointer at crunch-time, the team will not advance past the Elite Eight.

Half of Connecticut's one-two punch, Richie Hamilton was able to guide the Huskies undefeated before his injury . 
Auburn is college basketball's most unexpect­ed succeess story. Still, I'd be surprised if they made it to the Sweet 16. 
Notre Dame? Yeah, we're not in the tourna­ment, but this season has been a success and should merit a relatively high seed in the National Invitational Tournament. After losing Pat Garrity, Notre Dame succeeded in the face of adversity and is sure to win a spot in the NCAA tournament next year: 
So ... My Elite Eight: Duke, Cincinnati, Stanford, UConn, Michigan State, Maryland, Washington and Xavier. My Final Four: Duke, Cincinnati, Stanford, :Vl.ichigan State. 
Duke has the most talent. Cincinnati the most intensity and Michigan State the sched­ule. Stanford was just beaten by UConn, but it is a tournament team and is simply the best. 
Color the champion cardinal.

They went on to shoot 54 percent· in the first half and led 50-20 at the break. 
Ole Miss could never find a rhythm against Auburn's sti­.fling man-to-man defense 
and always seemed at least one step behind. After shooting only 21 percent in the first half, the Rebels were out of it early. They shot 34 percent for the game. and were 4-of-24 from 3 point range. 
The .Tigers were too quick for the Rebels, making 10 steals and forcing 20 turnovers.

NatimHil Hockey League Players Association voiced opposition. 
Among those intl'rnsted in arquiring all or part of the team is Lemieux, who is owed $26.2 million in deferred sulary by tho curront ownorship -thn most of anv of' tlrn team's numerous unse~ured creditors. 
LPmimrx. a six-timP NHL scor­ing champion who retired in 1 lJ97, heads the creditors com­mitti>o and was pleasantly sur­prised with Marino's change of' heart. 
"We'rn trying to rind some investors who would not only buy tho team but keep them in Pittsburgh," Lemieux said. "It's a great hockey town aud the fans deserve something better than a u~am in bankruptcy. We've brl'n working very hard, and it's looking pretty good." 

Lemieux did not <'iaborat11 on the masons for his optimism and did not identil'y any possible investors. But ho said. "This is something that has goltfm to happen soon."

Brown is first 49er to get axed 
Associated P,ess 
SANTA CIARA. Calif. 

Offensive tackle Jamie Brown, an expensive ar.quisi­tion \Vho flopped with the San Francisco 49ers, was released Tuesday as part of the toam 's effort to cut the payroll and comply with the salary cap. 
Brown's release provided $2 .3 million in relief for the 49ers. who began the week about $13 million over next season's projected $57.5 mil­lion cap. Teams must be at or under the cap by Friday. 
Other players in danger of being released because of the 49ers' cap crunch include safe­ty Merton Hanks and guard Kevin Gogan, both former Pro Bowlers. 
Declining to provide specifics. general manager Bill Walsh also said the 49ers have restructured the contracts of wide receiver Jerry Rice and 
linebacker Leo Woodall. The team also is reworking the deals of safety Tim McDonald, linebacker WinfrP<l Tubhs aud Stove Young. 
The 49crs realized an addi­tional$3 millionJn ~ap~a:vil)~ when cornerback Atit<JiHo Langham, a free-agent i:lii.ap~ pointment with ${(n Ft!J,llBi!3¢.o; was selecttid by th~ Clev11~nd Browns in th? expitnsl.on dtaft. 
General manager lnll Walsh wa..:; in the middle ·of a confer­ence caU with reporters dis­cussing the 49ers' cap·status when he learned the Bl·owns had used their 37th pick on Langham. ·. 
Brown was acquired from Dirnver last April in exchange for the 49ers' 1999 second­round pick. Walsh said for all of the cap savings achieved by his release, knowing the team wasted a second-round pick on him was tough. 
Projected as a starting left tackle, Brown fell behind almost from the moment he joined San Francisco. missing most of training camp duo to a persistont woin strain. 

Brown and team manage­Lnflnf foudod over how hard he · worked on his re.habilitation and hewound up being sus­pended three weeks for con­dud detrimental to the team 
· after he skipped a preseason game and showed up late for another. Coach Steve Mariucci wanted to cut Brown immediately after he came off suspension. but former general manager Dwight Clark, who pulled the trigger on the trade, persuaded Mariucci to give Brown another chance. Because of injury problems. the 49ers W(fffl forced to give Brown five starts, but he played poorly, including one outing in which he was repeatedly boat­en by Buffalo's Bruce Smith.

¦ IRISH IRON CLASSIC 
Irish 'get pumped' for charity 

By KERRY SMITH 
Spores Writer 
Notre Danrn studt,nts had tho chancn to test their strength while contributing to the South Rnnd community Sunday at th(\ Irish Iron Classic: 
The third-annual bench press competition, sponsored by Dillon llall. drPw a record 140 participants. Coordinators Jamns Genuario and Burt Binenfeld were 
pleased  with  the  event's  
turnout.  
"I was  especially pleased  

with the women ·s competition this vear. Wn had nine teams entn"r which is great," said Genuario. "We were hoping for a biggP-r lurnout in the men's competition -it was a little below what we expect­ed, but overall we were happy with tho event." 
All of the profits gained from the Classic will be donated to the South Bend Center for the Homeless. Genuario estimated that becamrn of' this year's increased participation. Dillon Hall will donate about $500 to the charity. 
The Classic awarded more than $1,000 in donated prizes to winners in the men's and women's compPtitions. Senior John Bergman won the title "most outstanding lifter" in tlrn men's individual competi­tion with a 320-pound lift ­202 percent of his body weight. Bergman's lift also earned him first place in his 151-160 weight class. 
"I've been involved in weightlifting competitions before," said Bergman, who placed second overall in the Classic last year. "I try LO get involved in these sorts of things whenever I can." 
Senior Judy Amorosa rarnod tho title ·or "most out­s tan ding lifter" in the women's individual competi­
tion with a lift of 160 pounds. In the team contests, a 
Dillon Hall team of' Mike Yang, Joe Lomangino, Joe Parke. Steve Mehl and Jason Visner out-benched the com­pfltition with lifts flxcceding tho team's combined body weight by 454 pounds. 
The Lyons Hall team, which indudcd Amorosa, Carmen Hernandez, Lisa Thomas, Llz Kerblesk and H,rnther Shannon, captured lirst plaw in the women's team compe­tition with a combined lift of' 590 pounds. edging out trams from Farley and Lewis. 
Winners in each of the eight weight elasses also rnceived prizes. Kevin Huie captured the under-140 title with a lift of 260 pounds. while the 141­150 wright class title went to Mike Yang, who lifted 270 pounds. 
Timmy O'Neill earned first place in the 161-170 weight class, boasting a lift of 285 pounds and Donald Doan snagged first place in the 186-200 weight class with a 320-pound lift. John Taggart, benching 325 pounds, earned the top spot in the 186-200 weight class, narrowly edging out his competitors. . 
Jacob McGuigan was awarded first place in the 201-21 !i weight class with a lift of 340 pounds, while "Mad Oawg" Jackson, bench­ing 345 pounds, dominated in the 216 and above weight class. 
In addition to proving their strength, most entrants in the Classic participated in order to help the South Bend Center for the Homeless. 
"It was for a good cause and I had fun, " said O'Neill. "Dillon Hall did a nioi job or putting it together." 
Genuario, who has orga­nizNl the Classic every year, deemed the (Wflnt a succr,ss, 
"We had a great turnout and the crowd was enthusias­tic," he said. "Everyone had a lot of fun and we managed to raise some money for a good rause.''
