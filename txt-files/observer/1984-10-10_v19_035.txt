Doonesbury evolves from college to real world 
Doonesbury is back. You've been hearing about it for 
weeks, and now you can a~tually open up your 
Obseroer (or Chicago Tribune orSouth Bend Tribune) 
and actually read the often controversial comic strip. 
Since its inception, Doonesbury has been a semi­
accurate barometer ofpolitical attitudes across college 
campuses. It usually has a prominent place in college 
newspapers since students can read the strip to find out 
what the mood of the nation's college students is like. 
The new and improved Doonesbury, judging from 
what has run so far, seems to have departed from the 
realm ofcollege liberalism and has entered the world of 
the young urban professional -the Yuppie who seems 
so dominant in business these days and who seems to be 
the role model for some Notre Dame business students. 
This change in intended audience may have taken place for a number of reasons. One is logistics. The original characters of the strip, Mike Doonesbury, Zonker Harris and the rest, lived at Walden, a house on the outskirts of a college 
which the characters atten­ded. Football games, student radio stations and post-game mixers played a central role in the strip as Doonesbury used these topics to com­ment on the attitude of 
campuses across the nation. survive in a world that

up, it seemed, and Zonker and the rest were seemingly frozen in time. 
But now, with the per­meating conservative atti­tude present here and on campuses all over the country, a strip about stu­dents who actually cared about issues rather than getting good grades and high­paying jobs would be out ofplace and irrelevant. 
The strip's creator, Garry Trudeau, realized this and in the last few years before his hiatus the strip dealt mainly with issues outside the college campus, such as Duke's dealings with undercover FBI agents posing as cocaine dealers and a documentry about the workings of Ronald Reagan's brain. The material for Trudeau's earlier strip was simply no longer applicable. 
During the two year break, the characters ofDoones­bury have graduated from college (though some still live in Walden) and are now attempting to enter the real world -getting jobs and being directly affected by the policies of the current presidential administration. This seems somehow natural, in that most college stu­dents are now looking at what their job opportunities will be after graduation and what career choices gaurantee the most room for quick advancement. Most students no longer seem to be concerned with using

their time in ~.:ollcgc for moral growth and correcting social injustice. 
The college newspapers that carried the strip in its earlier years did so because the picture it drew of the liberal attitude of college students was accurate and consistent with what students really felt. Now that the strip is back, college newspapers are once again picking it up, but for a different reason. 
The strip is still accurate in depicting the attitudes of 
college students simply because the strip is no longer set in college. And for most students, this is not what they want to read about anyway. They want to see these characters who like them were once struggling through academia, but are now on the outside world, meeting the challenges of career pursuits and trying to 
The change in the format of the Doonesbury comic strip is definitive of the change in attitudes of col­lege students. Most are no longer as concerned with the time spent in school as they are with the what they will be doing once they get 
out. 
If the strip still were set in college today and featured the message of the liberal university student as it once did it would be doubtful if it would be as popular on campuses as it is. Most students today really don't pos­sess the same ideas about social justice and morality that the characters of Doonesbury have. A new version of the old Doonesbury would be a dismal failure. Trudeau knows this and has made the necessary adjust­ment. 
The characters still have the liberal outlook, as is evidenced by the amount ofsatire the current presiden­tial administration suffers. But in the strip so far, the message ofthe young urban professional has been dom­inant. The characters are entering job markets, they are coping with reality. 
It would be nice if Doonesbury still reflected the liberal attitude of college students in a humorous and topical manner. But unfortunately this attitude is ex­tinct as the Dino the dinasour.

Each September twenty-five stu­dents from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's travel to County Kildare, Ireland. For a year they study at Saint Patrick's College in Maynooth, fif­teen miles west of Dublin. 
The Saint Mary's foreign studies 
program in Ireland is an excellent 
opportunity for students with strong 
academic ability and motivation to 
"immerse themselves in another 
culture," said Ellen Pugh, director of 
the program. 
Sophomores, and occasionally 
juniors participate in the Ireland 
program. The program is geared 
toward the liberal arts, but Pugh said 
she strives for a balanced program. A 
group that's "not predominantly 
anything" provides a better cultural 
year for all, Pugh said. 
The primary criterion for partici­
pation is strong self-motivation, oe­
cause the program is very 
independent. Students live in their 
Corrigan

Corrigan attributed the decision to have ND play in last year's Uberty Bowl in part to the fact that the Uberty Bowl Chairman was a Notre Dame Alumnus. He said that going into the Penn State game at 6-3 they expected Notre Dame to beat the Nittany lions and face Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl. When ND lost they assumed that the Irish would not at­tend a bowl game. 
However, the chairman of the Uberty Bowl, an alumnus o{ Notre Dame, said that the loss to Penn State was a dream come true for him be­casuse the Irish would then be available for the Uberty Bowl, Cor­rigan said. 
The decision to go was put before 
the faculty committee and it was 
decided that ND would beat Air 
Force and finish 7-4 and therefore 
should play in the Liberty Bowl. 
When Air Force upset Notre Dame 
Corrigan said,"lt became a real 
mess." 
Corrigan said that many of the 
players felt the bowl was a good ex­
perience because it gave them a 
chance to regain lost confidence and 
end the season on an up note.

to throw the economy into a reces­sion while simultaneously cutting back the aid for those who would be aliected by it." 
Rakowski concluded by em­phasizing the technical side of Reaganomics. He stressed that the figures must be evaluated rather than relying on a generalized im­pression and blanket statements. 
The debate, which consisted of a 
fifteen minute opening address, a 
rebuttal, a question and answer per­
iod, and a closing statement, was ex­
tremely informal. 
The audience consisted of 
approximately 75 students and a few 
faculty members. 
Mike Lochhead, co-coordinator of 
the debate, said "I was pleased with 
the turnout and I think the debate 
itselfwent very well." 
The next debates in the series sponsored by the Election Task Force will be held Monday, Oct. 15 and Monday, Oct. 29. The first will focus on life issues and the Oct. 29 debate will deal with the nuclear arms issue. 
own houses and manage their finances. There is no strict cut-oJJ GPA, but applicants must have two academic recommendations and a personal recommendation. 
Meetings for the program are mandatory, and applications are due Dec. I. The applicants go through an interviewing process, and 25 are se­lected. The cost is approximately the same as a year's tuition at Saint Mary's, but students must pay their rent and travel expenses. 
Nancy Brennan, a senior who studied in Ireland two years ago, said the best thing about the program is the "opportunity to see America from another viewpoint." Irish cul­ture is very different than in the United States-"people are more laid back," she said. The appreciation of time was stressed over three-hour teas. 
Brennan lived with three other girls in a house where the only heat was from a peat-burning fireplace. "It's really a simple lifestyle," she said. They went to school with Irish students and spent time at The Roost, one of four pubs in the one­street village of Maynooth. 
Students also had the chance to travel to continental Europe over breaks. There was time to hitchhike around Ireland, a beautiful country described as apicture frame because of its stunning coastline. In the beginning of the year, students hiked to high-security Belfast at a time when there was a bomb scare. 
The next meeting for the Ireland program is tonight at 6:30 in Room 232 Moreau Hall at Saint Mary's. More information will be available, as well as applications, and new ap· plicants are welcome.

Sure, they said it would be tough. It would take a lot oftime and require organization. But they didn't tell us that being a social commis­sioner would be alomost impossible. Now, thanks to the latest "Special Bulletin," the pos­sibility of off-campus social events is fading fast. 
On Sept. 14, our dorm, Walsh Hall, held a Luau at Erskine Country Club. The two of us, besides having the event approved of by the administration in advance, even scheduled a special meeting with Dr. Goldrick the week of 
Fox and Boland 
guest column 

the event. We told him all of our plans, even about the open bar included in the ticket price. We confidently tQld our Rectress, Sr.Jo, that everything had been okayed. But that was then, and this is now. 
After the event, a Rector from a boys' dorm on campus made a phone call to Dr. Goldrick on our "behalf." We'd really like to express our appreciation, but we have yet to discover his identity. In this phone call, this Rector des­cribed our Luau as out-of-control. Since we realize that second-hand information is AL­WAYS the complete truth, we again commend this Rector for his quick action. Dr. Goldrick followed this phone call with one of his own to our Rectress. We were accused oftrying to get around the rules. Sr. )o, because she was aware of the situation, was able to defend us. We heard this story later through the hall grapevine. To check its validity, instead offol­lowing the example previously set by the Rec­tor, we set up an appointment to meet with Dr. Goldrick. 
But wait; there's more. Before the date of our appointment, a "Special Bulletin" was 




Off -campus events are 
tougher than thought 
issued to every dorm on campus. This "Bulletin" ruled expost facto that our Luau at Erskine broke the rules. It set up a policy that requires the manager of the establishment holding the social to sign a contract including every item on the "Bulletin." At our appoint­ment with Dr. Goldrick, he assured us that nothing had fundamentally changed, and that there would be no difficulty in getting the contract signed. We thought differently, but kept silent. Instead, we listened for almost an hour as Dr. Goldrick discussed liability, in full force, with newspaper clippings documenting lawsuits. He painted a grisly picture, one of automobile wrecks and bodies at a morgue. The emotion was high, but a nine-letter word was higher. LIABIUTY! It is now the name of the game at Notre Dame. 
And last night, when we phoned Erskine to receive a reply to the photocopy of the "Special Bulletin" we dropped off last Thursday, we received an answer that didn't faze us a bit. We thought we'd better let every­one know, because we're betting it's a definite pattern of things to come. Yes, although Erskine will comply to every rule on the "Bulletin," they have been advised by security not to sign anything. We, in turn, advised Erskine to cancel our dances. 
We realize we are not mincing words, and we'd be more than happy to discuss our situa­tion and listen to suggestions. We're not giving up on a dorm social life off-campus, es­pecially since off-campus is where the admin­istration's alcohol policy is encouraging us to go. We have every intention ofCONTINUING to follow the written rules. But, for a dorm our size with students on budgets, the prospects look bleak. 
So for now, it's Welcome to Notre Dame, Kids! Where the Big Brother policy knows ab­solutely NO bounds. 
Pamela Fox and Nell Boland are Walsh Hall Social commissioners. 
Notre Dame will always 

remain a special place 
In thinking abol!t reactions to the recent football game, the disappointment, the dis­gust, and especially the diminished spirit among my fellow Domers, I pondered the question-What is Notre Dame all about? Does Notre Dame stand for "Our Football Team?" I think not. Notre Dame means "Our Lady." This simple meaning is easily forgotten in the midst of a "dreaded" football loss, the much­criticized alcohol policy, and the tremendous

academic pressures faced by all; yet, this meaning is the very essence of the University. The core and character of Notre Dame, the specialness of Notre Dame, is found in those two simple words-"Our Lady." 
I am writing this article in tribute to Notre Dame. She is where the spirit ofthe lJniversity stemsfrom, not from a "sack" or a touchdown. Although I have only claimed the title of "Domer" for a few short weeks, Her presence has already found a speeial place in my life. Just to catch a glimpse of the glorious Golden Dome is emough to make me realize how very lucky I am to be here -we are to be here. The 
word "inspirational" ~omes to mind. 
One dreary Monday afternoon this usually 
quite cheerful freshman was struck by the 
pangs of homesickness and emptiness. It 
seemed the only possible way to pull myself 
out of this pool of gloom was to somehow 
clear my mind -to take time out to put my life 
into perspective. So thanks to the suggestion 
ofa thoughtful friend I ventured to the Grotto.

If the presence of Our Lady is to be felt anywhere, it is here. 
The feeling of peace is overwhelming. Al­though I left that night still tear-drenched, I also left with a feeling of relief and warmth. I left knowing that things were not that bad. I realized that finishing (or for that matter start· ing) that "important" paper or reading those infinite number ofpages meant nothing in the scheme of life. What mattered was that I was here -at Notre Dame -and I was being guided by a gentle, loving, and strong hand. Our Lady had alleviated my uncertainties and I could now see my life more clearly; I was able to unboggle my boggled up mind. This sort of specialness is what sets Notre Dame apart from other universities and colleges. Regard­
less of how bad the football team plays, how 
restricting the alcohol policy is, or how de· 
manding classes can be · the aura of Notre 
Dame shadows over these minor difficulties 
and makes them trivial. 
Granted, it is O.K. to experience feelings of disappointment after the loss of a football game or the failure of an exam, but those feelings must be put aside so that the higher meaning of Notre Dame must always prevail. She is among us always, guiding us, protecting us, and directing our sometimes confusing lives down a path ofenrichment, growth, and true happiness. We are N.D.-and the outcome ofa football game cannot change this. 
In closing, I will say that this article was written in the spirit of gratitude to Our Lady. Thank you, Notre Dame. You have helped this student "survive" her first encounters with Notre Dame, You have made her feel priveleged to be a part of Your greatness, and You have made her want to stay here for the next four years.

Juniper Press to publish Observer classified ads 
SpKialto the Observer 
-orse Died/ Need Ride to Bos­
ton, a collection ofObseroer 
Personal ads, has been selected 
from among several manuscripts for 
publication during the fall semester 
by the members ofJuniper Press, a 
student owned and operated 
publishing house founded at Notre 
Dame. 
lbe co-authors of the work are 
two Notre Dame students and 
members of the juniper Press staff: 
Margaret Fosmoe, a senior English 
and American Studies major from 
Kalamazoo, Mi., and Julianne jones, 
a fourth year English, French, and 
H 
ALPA major from St. Louis, Mo. Fosmoe serves as Fulfillment Manager for Juniper Press, while Jones acts as Copy Editor. 
The book publishing course was established at Notre Dame by Asso­
 elate Professor Elizabeth Christman, a novelist and former literary agent, to allow students to gain experi­ence in the publishing industry as they form and operateJuniper Press each year. 
In its nine year history, the com­pany has published such popular works as Michael Molinelli's 
Molarity: On the Road to Selltng Out, and Ralph Maclnerny's Quick 
as a Dodo, Abecedary, and The 
Frozen Maiden ofCalpurnla. The company's most recently published 
work was Michael Varga's play 
Payable Upon Return. 
This year's project,Horse Died! NeedRide to Boston, is a unique and challenging one for Juniper Press. The staffselected this work for the appeal it should have for Notre Dame students and alumni, as well as for those who are not associ­ated with the University. As a col­lection ofthe more humorous and creative Obseroer Personals from the past four years, HorseDied/ NeedRide to Boston should offer fun, light reading, and provide a lighthearted view ofstudent life at Notre Dame.

Shy person's 
guide to life 
by Cat Francis 
features columnist 

I 
n every crowd, every group, every angry mob, there ,are three 
distinct character types. The first group, ofwhich there are only 
a few, are the brash, afraid-of-nothing extroverts. The second 
group, which has the largest number of members, are the normals. 
The third group is one that is rarely noticed · the shy. 
I'm not talking about the people who would hesitate before walking across campus nude. I'm talking about the people who would have a hard time just walking across campus. 
They are the unnoticed, the ignored, the people who lose their places in the lunchline. They know the correct answer to questions in class, but they keep it to themselves, because they're not sure you'd be interested. 
They do not dress flamboyantly; they do not stand out in a crowd. But they exist, nonetheless. 
Often they are trampled by other people around them. But now it's time they stood up for themselves. And to help them get started I have compiled a few situations in which the shy may begin to assert themselve&, which may not prove essential to their survival. 
Returning overdue books to the library is a matter which haunts 
the nightmares of many shy people. They know that any librarian 
worth his or her salt will pick up the book, see the overdue date, 
and begin to glare menacingly. They may even go so far as to give a 
short lecture on the value ofresponsibility. They might go so far as 
to call out your name, and how late the book is, when you scuffle 
back to pay the fine. . 
There must be a better way. First, check out a few books. Stroll 
nonchalantly up to the counter, looking as though an overdue book 
is the last thing on your mind. Place the overdue book beneath the 
non-overdue books, and slip the whole pile into the return slot. 
With any luck, they'll check the non-overdue books first, giving you a chance to make a break for the Pit and comfortable anonymity. 
Wear nondescript clothing so you won't be recognized when you 
emerge. 
Cashiers often seem to go out of their way to annoy shy people. For a shy person, pointing out an incorrect charge or an insuf­ficiency ofchange to a store clerk is painfully embarassing. Many cashiers are pleasant when an error is pointed out. Others are down right humiliating. 
There are several tactics one can use to deal with these obnoxious salesclerks. Extroverted friends can be of invaluable assistance, since they won't think twice about going up and embarassing the clerk as much as he embarrassed you. 
Another method is popular In a number ofcultures. It involves making a voodoo doll ofthe cashier and sticking pins in it. Although this will probably have little or no effect on the person, it will make you feel considerably better. 
People who cut in line are annoying. Mention in an undertone to a nearby friend (or a wall or ketchup dispenser, should you prove too shy to have any friends) the highly contagious social disease you recently acquired. Watch the crowds melt away before your very eyes. 
The juke-box syndrome is when you don't want to play music on the juke-box because you're not sure everyone else likes "She-Bop" as much ru; you do. At the very least, those within earshot and eyeshot will know it was you who played the tune and will look at you witheringly. They might decide to throw food. 
To avoid either ofthese uncomfortable situations, you should wait until another student has just put some quarters in. When he Is finished meking his selections punch in the songs you like. No one will know which one ofyou picked which song. And ifthe other person looks accusingly at you when "Hungry Like the Wolf' starts playing, stare back. It's your glare against his. 
The greatest fear of a shy person when answering in class, even if he knows the answer, is that he may be wrong. People will laugh at you. They may tell their friends about the jerk in their class. lbe teacher may laugh at you. He may tell a funny story at the cocktail meeting he is invited to, and it will be about you, and the entire faculty will be laughing at you. Perhaps it's better not to risk It ... then again, perhaps it's better not to think about these things and 
just to go ahead and answer the question. 
Meeting members of the opposite sex. This Is a very tricky thing. 
Obviously, being shy, you can't come up with any clever come-ons 
or witty sayings. You can hope your shyness Is appealing and cute 
and wait for them to come on to you, or you can try something 
else. 
Stick close the person. Sooner or later, an extrovert will come and say something. Walt for the extrovert to go away. Catch the person's eye, shake your head, and say "What a jerk, huh?" 
With any luck, they'll be a fellow shy person. And they'll know exactly what you mean.

Detroit wins Game One 
Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO -The Detroit Tigers won a battle of baseball's old and new last night, using a two-run homer from Larry Herndon and clutch pitching from jack Morris to beat the San Diego Padres, 3-2, in the first game of the 1984 World Series. 
The tense game that went beyond three hours was marked by ques­tionable base running and managerial decisions by the Padres, who were playing in the World Se­ries for the first time in their 16-year history. 
The Tigers, who appeared in their first World Series in 1907, trailed 2-1 when Herndon hit a two-run homer in the fifth inning off Mark Thur­mond. The Padres' left-bander had struggled all night, while relievers Dave Dravecky and Andy Hawkins looked on, ready to work. 
Thurmond threw 117 pitches in five innings before being relieved by Hawkins, who pitched two and two thirds innings of one-hit, shutout relief. and Dravecky, who went the rest of the way without giving up a hit.

bouncing back from that loss to capture a Liberty Bowl win, but the Irish had one month to recuperate. This team only has until Saturday to find out about itself. Ifthis Irish team has character, it will bounce back against Air Force much like its predecessor did against Boston Col­lege. Ifnot, Irish fans may have tout­ter a line familiar to Cub fans: "Wait 'til next year." 
Pick ofthe Week. .. The regular­season volleyball championship of the North Star Conference could be on the line tonight In the south dome of the ACC when Art Lam­bert's Irish players entertain the Loyola Ramblers at 7 p.m. 
Both teams are undefeated in con­ference play, and Loyola has an im­pressive 1I -game winning streak against conference foes. Many a win­ning streak has been stopped in the arena by Irish basketball teams, but now the volleyball team ha.-; a chance to play "Streakbusters." Come out and see if it happens tonight!

Irish drop out 

oil
Texas stays on top of football 
Assoclated Press 
Texas and Oklahoma missed by just II points having a rare squareoff of the nation's two top-ranked col­lege football teams. 
Texas held onto its No. I ranking yesterday in The Associated Press poll, while Oklahoma, the Lon­ghorns' opponent next Saturday, climbed from fifth place to third. 
Washington took advantage of Ohio State's 28-23 loss to Purdue and replaced the Buckeyes as No. 2, while Purdue, South Carolina and Kentucky made the Top Twenty after absences of several years. 
Texas, a 38-I3 winner over Rice, 
received 55 of 59 first-place votes 
and I,I70 of a possible 1,180 points 
from a nationwide panel of sports 
writers and sportscasters. 
While Ohio State dropped from 
second to eighth, Washington, No. 3 
a week ago, moved up one spot with 
one first-place ballot and 1,049 
points after a 19-7 triumph over 
Oregon State. 
Oklahoma was idle last weekend but jumped from fifth to third with one first-place vote and 1,038 points. The other two first-place bal­lots went to Boston College, which was idle for the second week in a row and received 1,026 points to remain No. 4. The Eagles return to action this weekend against Temple. 
Asked if the Texas-Oklahoma 
game would match the nation's two 
best teams, Texas coach Fred Akers 
replied: "I don't know. I'd say we're 
two of the best. This game is consid­
ered by most to be the No. 1 college 
football game in the country today." 
Brigham Young moved up from 
seventh to fifth with 932 points with a 52-6 rout ofColorado State and Ne­braska, a 17-3 winner over Okla­homa State, rose from eighth to sixth with 869 points while the Cowboys fell from ninth to 13th. 
Southern Methodist also was off last weekend and the Mustangs received 807 points to advance from lOth place to seventh. Eighth-place Ohio State received 690 points, while Florida State dropped from sixth to ninth with 646 points after a 17-17 tie with Memphis State. Miami rounded out the Top Ten, vaulting from 14th to lOth with 605 points by defeating Notre Dame 31-13 and knocking the Irish out of the rankings. 
The Second Ten consists of Penn State, LSU, oklahoma State, Purdue, Georgia, Auburn, South Carolina, Florida, Kentucky and Georgia Tech. 
Last week, it was Penn State, Geor­gia Tech, Michigan, Miami, LSU, Notre Dame, UCLA, Auburn, Vander­bilt and Georgia. 
Purdue, 4-1, last appeared in the Top Twenty in I980. South Carolina, which trounced Kansas State, 49-I7, to go 4-0, also made the rankings for the first time since 
1980. 
Kentucky, also 4-0 after a 27-I4 victory over Rutgers, had not been in the Top Twenty since 1978. And Florida, No. 17 in the. I984 preseason poll, returned for the first time since then by blanking Syracuse, 16-0. 
Michigan dropped out by losing to Michigan State I9-7, UCLA disap­peared after a 23-2IIoss to Stanford and Vanderbilt, which made the rankings last week for the first time since 1958, fell out after bowing to Tulane, 27-23.

The golfseason will resume in the spring, and ifthe Notre Dame golfers can mantain their winning ways they could be looking at a possible berth in the NCAA Tournament.

Keeilan hands Dillon Hall its first loss in last four years 

By BRIAN McCARTHY 
Sports Writer 
A noteworthy event took place this weekend in interhall football competition as Keenan Hall, which had not won a game this year, pulled off a monumental upset of previ­ously unbeaten Dillon, 7-6. 
Few people, besides the players and the refs, ventured outside in the driving rainstorm to see Keenan become the first team to beat Dillon in four years. Keenan, in fact, is the first team even to score a point on the Dillon defense in three years. 
Although the field conditions were not as bad as might have been expected, the ball was wet, and the offenses for both teams had trouble starting up. However, in the second quarter Keenan managed to pene­trate deep. into Dillon territory, and 
Jamie Burke dove over from two yards for a touchdown. He then l'>ooted the point-after for what proved to be the winning margin. 
Dillon refused to go down with­out a fight as they began the second half by marching for a score of their own. Tight end Dan McMahon caught a touchdown pass from Bren­dan Coughlin to bring Dillon within one.

good field position. Dillon's final 
By MARK STADTMUELLER 
Sports Writer 
On a wet and dreary Monday af­ternoon the Notre Dame golf team won its own 12th Annual Fall Invita­tional Golf Tournament at the Burke Memorial Golf Cour~e. 
This concluded a 33-4 fall season which Coach Noel O'Sullivan des­cribed as the best in his twelve years as Notre Dame coach. 
The Notre Dame victory was char­acterized by a total team effort as two Irish teams were fielded. Notre Dame's gold team finished first, and the blue team finished in second place. 

The victorious Irish team was led by Captain John O'Donovan, who showed great character by posting a 78 after overcoming a bad front nine and a torrential rain during his back nine. 
The rest of the team also faired well as Chris Bona and Lon Huffman each shot 75, John Anthony shot a

threat died when a twenty-yard pass completion late in the game was nul­lified by a holding call. 
The loss brings Dillon's record to 2-I, and the Big Red now is in a three-way tie with Flanner and Mor­rissey for the Parseghian division lead. 
In other games, Flanner's offense continued to roll as they ripped Off­Campus 20-0. Quarterback Tim Ar­nold scored two touchdowns and running backs Joe Arnold and Larry Diedrick consistently gained big yardage running behind the Flanner offensive line. 
Morrissey rebounded from last week's defeat as it beat Grace 13-0. Quarterback Geoff Henry scored a third quarter touchdown and tight end Steve Beerman caught a fifteen­yard scoring toss in the fourth quar­ter to sew up the game. 
Stanford jumped to the front of the Leahy division with a 14-0 vic­tory over Holy Cross. Quarterback Brent Basham sneaked over for a second-quarter touchdown, and Chris Fox dashed five yards for the final score. Stanford's record goes to 2-0-I, while Holy Cross falls to 1-1. 
Zahm also nailed down its second win of the year by edging Alumni 7­
6. Steve Dombrowski lifted Zahm to victory with a fifteen y.ard touch­down reception with less than two minutes to play in the game. Zahm, which earlier had blocked Alu~JJni's extra-point attempt, was able to con­vert on its own PAT and raise its record to 2-1. Alumni now owns a 
1-1-1 slate. 
In the Rockne division, Howard came back to defeat Carroll, 14-6, and move into second place. Trail­ing 6-0 in the first half, Howard took the lead on an Andy Jolin five-yard reception and later added an insur­ance touchdown with a three-yard run by Pat Clark. Howard is now 1-0­1; and Carroll sliped to I-2. 
St. Ed's remained in the playoff picture with a I 0-0 win over Pangborn. St. Ed's took advantage of a blocked punt near the end of the first half for its first score, a twenty· two yard field goal by Rob Kill. Pangborn had St. Ed's stopped, but a face mask penalty on the last play of the half gave St. Ed's its final chance before the intermission. In the second half, St. Ed's defense prevented Pangborn from mounting a serious threat while its offense added a late score on a ten-yard pass to Matt Kairis. St. Ed's record is now 
I -1, while Pangborn remains winless at 0-2-I: 
Next Sunday's games include Flanner vs Morrissey at I p.m. in a crucial battle for a playoff spot in the Parseghian division. Also, Grace challenges Keenan at 4 p.m. and Dil­lon tries to rebound against Off­Campus at 3 p.m. 
In the Leahy division, Cavanaugh takes on first place Stanford at 2 p.m. while Alumni battles Holy Cross at I p.m. 
At 3 p.m., undefeated Sorin goes against Pangborn and Howard at­tempts to upend St. Ed's at 2 p.m. in the Rockne division. 

Irish looking for upset 
ByERICSCHEUE~ 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame volleyball team, conting off a strong week of play, will try to stay undefeated in the North Star Conference tonight when it meets much-heralded Loyola at 7 
p.m. in the ACC Arena. 
Both the Irish and the Ramblers have perfect records in the confer­ence, so the game tonight is an im­portant one in the fight for tile conference championship. 
The Irish stand at 7-7, and they posted a 3-1 record in games last week. However, they will be tested tonight when they face a very strong Loyola team. 
"Loyola is the best team in the conference," says Irish coach Art Lambert. "They won the conference last year, and are looking to repeat." 
Stong, consistent volleyball will be needed to beat the experienced Ramblers. The Irish have been playing well lately, and Lambert seems pleased with the way things are going. 
"We sure could do with some more wins," he adntits, "but there's no question I've seen a lot of im­provement. I've seen improvement in all the girls." 
Even though their record stand<> at only .500, the Irish can take a big step toward a successful season with a win tonight. The team's main goal this season has been to win the con­ference championship. An upset tonight against the Ramblers can put the Irish ahead in the race for first place. 

Notre Dame must bounce· back from loss to Miami 
Hello again, everybody! 

Ifyou are either a Cub fan or an Irish fan or by some awful coincidence a fan of both teams, you have first­hand knowledge ofwhat disappointment feels like. You have had your expectations raised, only to get your heart broken. You have raised your fork to your mouth expecting T-bone steak and you wound up with a mouthful of tofu vegetables. · 
Yes, losing hurts, and don't believe anybody who says it doesn't. It hurts the fans, it hurts the players, and it hurts the coaches. Looking at Gerry Faust after the game, one saw a man who put a smile on his face that resembled a grimace. He faced the reporters and gra­ciously answered all their questions, but it wasn't easy. It never is after a loss. 
Call it "Lost Weekend," call it a disaster, call it anyth­ing you want. Don't call it fun, though, because It cer­tainly was not that. It was not any fun for fans standing in the rain who could only look on helplessly. It was not any fun for the players and coaches who had to suffer another defeat to a "low-class" Hurrican e team. It was not fun at all. 
The true test for Notre Dame, however, did not come last week against Miami, but comes this week against Air Force. Miami has knocked Notre Dame to the canvas. Now the question is can the Irish get up in time for Air Force? It is a test ofcharacter for Faust and his players. 
Notre Dame has every reason to stay on the canvas, take the count and leave the ring. It is a squad decimated by Injuries to key people. No less than seven starters will be on the bench for Saturday's game with

an assortment of ailments, with Steve Beuerlein being the latest addition to that group with a bruised right · shoulder. The injuries are tough, and they certainly hurt the team. However, it would be a cop-out to use them as 
an excuse. 

Instead, the Irish have to respond to the challenge. Scott Grooms will assume the controls of a sputtering Irish offense, hoping to find a way to move the football effectively for 60 minutes. It is not an easy task, consid­ering Beuerlein had been doing a fine job at quarter­back and still had problems putting the ball into the end zone. Now Grooms must try to solve the problem. It is not a promising task ahead ofthe vetera!l backup, but it is not an impossible one, either. 
Hopefully, Grooms will get help from the Irish run­ning game, which has been rather stagnant lately. Notre Dame's average of 119 rushing yards per game is the lowest mark by an Irish team since the NCAA began keeping stats in 1946. The running backs have been unable to get on track, partially because Notre Dame has been throwing so much and partially because there haven't been holes to run through. Now the Irish must get the running game in gear to help Grooms combat a solid Falcon defense. 
Defensively, the Irish have their work cut out for them. For the last two years, the Irish have had their problems stopping the Falcons in their wishbone op­tion attack. This year, the task doesn't look any easier, as Air Force ranks second in the nation in rushing, averag­ing 333 yards per game. The Falcons' two top rushers, fullback Pat Evans and halfbackJody Simmons, are both averaging nearly seven yards per carry, so the Irish can't key on just one player. 
The Falcons have thrown effectively this ye.ar, but an injury to quarterback Brian Knorr has hampered that aspect of their game in recent weeks. Backup signal­caller Bart Weiss will put the ball up occassionally, but he is much more effective as a running quarterback. Still, the Irish secondary must be alert for split end Ken Carpenter and backs coming out of the backfield or Weiss will burn them. 
Burning is something the Irish have been doing ever since last year's Air Force game, when )'lotre Dame lost a 12-point fourth-quarter lead. Air Force tied the game with I :35 left on a Mike Brown touchdown, but kicker Sean Pavlich missed the extra-point. However, Notre Dame was called for otfsides, and Pavlich converted on the second try to make it 23-22. The Irish drove back down the field, but Mike Johnston had a 31-yard field goal attempt biocked, and the game was history.
