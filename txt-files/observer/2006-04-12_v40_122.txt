Students take leave to go abroad 

By KAITLYNN RIELY 
News Writer 
With more than two dozen study abroad programs in coun­tries throughout the world, Notre Dame offers an off-campus learning experience for nearly every major and academic pur­suit. 
But for junior Brian Ching, his course of study led him away from University-sponsored sites to a unique program for semi­narians in Belgium. Ching took a !nave of absence from the College of Arts and Letters dur­ing the spring semester to study at Katholike Universiteit Leuven -the Catholic University of Leuven. 
Joan Clark, departmental administrator for the Office of International Studies, said from fall 2004 through summer 2005, a total of 1,284 students studied abroad. The majority-1,063 students -studied through Notre Dame or Saint Mary's pro­grams, but 221 students used outside programs. 
But the process isn't always easy. Notre Dame encourages its students to study through University-run programs rather than those of other schools, said Dennis Jacobs, Vice President and Associate Provost. 
Leave of absence for study purposes, he said, should be a very rare occurrence.

Once the system is imple­mented in fall of 2006, Hausman said, students will be given a print quota. Once they exceed this allotment of pages they will be charged money to print, she said. 
While the College has taken student perspectives into con­sideration, the decision to implement the "pay to print" system is final, said Kathy Hausman of Information Technology. Students may see test models appear as early as this spring.

Saint Mary's students used to free printing in campus com­puter clusters will be confront­ed with a "pay-to-print" system to be implemented by Information Technology this fall. 
The transition from a free printing system to a payment program has been underway for a long time, chief informa­tion officer Keith Fowlkes said. Fowlkes assisted in making the decision to adopt such a pro­gram.

Service-seekers turn to Holy Cross Associates 
H CA sends grads to non-profit agencies

News Writer 
For 2005 Notre Dame gradu­ates Matt Kuczora and Petula Fernandes, entering the real world meant confronting and working to solve real problems. 
Both alums are working for Holy Cross Associates (HCA), a post-graduate service program that gives graduates the oppor­tunity to both serve the commu­nity and to grow in faith. 
"HCA allows you the freedom and space to decide how you will live your life as individual and as a community during your year of service," Fernandes said. 
Each year, about two-thirds of the 30 to 35 associates come from Notre Dame, with the remaining third drawn from col­leges around the country. 
HCA sends its associates to six sites across the United States, including one in South Bend and one international site in Chile. At each site, four to seven associ­ates live together in communi­ties and work for non-profit agencies. 
"I believe [HCA] is important to the Holy Cross Congregation because it gets young people involved in work that previously priests would only do," said Mark Druyos, assistant director of Holy Cross Associates. "The purpose is to get lay people involved in Holy Cross min­istries."

As the academic year comes to a close for students, the end marks a new beginning for Kim Villere, Saint Mary's new security investigator and program coordinator. 
Villere, who took over on March 23, said she plans to continue some of the programs implemented by predecessor Patty Rolens as well as initiate some of her own. 
Rolens left her job at Saint Mary's to fulfill her previous position in the Mishawaka Police Department as a dispatcher, she said Tuesday. 
Villere has a strong background in security and law enforcement. As a South Bend police officer in the early 1990s, she worked her way from road patrol officer to under-

Maturity, personalized 
I'm 22 years old, and even though I 
don't ad like it 90 percent of the time 
I've always managed to see things for 
what they are. I tend to be laid baek, 
level headnd, and unafl'ccted by 
stress.

Now what does maturity have to do with anything? It's college right? Yeah, college, the place where we can pretty much do whatever we want (before 2 a.m.) while developing into responsible, young adults who will get jobs, raise families and contribute at least $50 a year to stay eligible for football tickets. 
I digress. My point is we're all sup­
posed to be mindful of our surround­
ings as wn tumble around in the lot­
tnry barrel of life waiting for our time 
to be plucked out or our drunken stu­
por and placed into the real world. 
Today, I'm asking you all to think 
about where you are as we approach 
that moment. 

I've read eountless Vinwpoints and entertained hundreds of conversa­tions full of complaints about other people's actions and thoughts. I've evnn writtl~n some and done somn 1:omplaining myself. 
What bothers me the most is the 
eontinual disregard for originality and 
creativity. By today's standards of 
political correctness, we can't even go 
into a bathroom without ofl'ending 
someone. 

Think about it for a second. No one 1:an really do anything without ofl'end­ing someone. Polities. university lifn, sports, love, eating, dating, sleeping, having sex, driving a ear, making a joke or drawing a comic-it doesn't matter what you do in life, someone, somewhere is going to be ofl'ended by it to the point that they demand that you stop. 
IIere's the crazy part. All of these things that we do, that may ofl'end someone, are what makes life real. Theso are the things that we'ro pas­sionate about doing, and at the end of the day you have to be confident enough to tune out objection and do what you love doing. You have to be yourself. 
Don't eonl'use my stance with hedo­nism, there are always !inns that shouldn't be crossed and things that will always be wrong. My point is, let things greater than people and sod­nties dntnrmine what you will or won't do. Everyone has a difl'erent reason for getting up every morning -be it faith, love, humor, work­and no one can tell you that it's a bad reason. 
There may be a trick to this kind of maturity after all. It's some weird combination of confidence and fear reinforced by people and things that you value. So do whatever you want, but when you have to grow up remember that it's quite possible the person next to you got up today for an entirely difl'erent reason and it isn't your role to judge.

Burglar steals cameras, forgets tape 
ELKO, Nev. -A man accused of burglarizing a laundromat in Elko figured he made a clean escape over the weekend when he took off with the store's six video surveillance cameras. 
But it turns out he left some rather compelling evidence behind -the video machine and video­tape that recorded his face each time he stood in front of the cameras at the Southside Laundry. 
Elko police said they came away with several close-ups of the suspect, Hobert Lynn White, 52,

Ball players share memories of league 

Women's teams drew large crowds during World War II years 
By NICOLE ZOOK 
Senior Staff Writer 
They may have looked unas­suming with their glasses and walkers, but the three older women in the Saint Mary's Vander Vennet Theater were once known as superstars in the world of professional sports. 
Janet "Pee Wee" Sears. Betsy "Sockum" Jochum and Fran "Big Red" Janssen are former members of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL), but they did­n't have to come from cities near and far to talk about their experiences play­ing ball during skirts as part of their ladylike uniforms and faced a fair amount of discrimination from men who thought women shouldn't be playing baseball. 
"I liked [the uniforms] ­except for sliding," Jochum said. "It was especially bad in South Bend because there were cinders at home plate." 
"It was interesting to go to each town and read the articles in the newspapers," Janssen said. "Usually, men's sportswrit­ers would write about these ladies coming to town to play baseball ... usually they had some smart headlines, but a lot of fans came to see the games." 
Women's baseball-and the AAGPBL -has been experienc­ing a resurgence in popularity since "A League of Their Own" was released in 1992. The three women credited its director Penny Marshall, an avid AAGPBL

"I just liked to play ball. I lived on a farm, and my brother and I would play," Janssen said. "I didn't even play organized ball until I got to Fort Wayne and joined a softball team." 
The women in the league were often traded "to keep the league even," Janssen said, and they lived with families in their team's towns. 
Jochum said the players prac­ticed every single day at 5 a.m., and practices and games were radically different than how the game is played today. 
"We didn't have the warm-up like they do now, we ran laps," she said. "There were no team warm-ups. Pitchers were sort of on their own." 
There was also no bullpen, Sears said, and coaches would let any player from the bench or outfield with a good arm try pitching during games. 
The AAGPBL players wore inaccuracies the 

movie depicted, like players living in fan's homes and chaperones never entering the dressing rooms, Sears said it was an accurate portrayal of the AAGPBL expe­rience. 
"The movie was quite good, I thought," she said. "I thought it captured the basic essence of the whole league." 
One audience member asked Sears if the players actually sang the AAGPBL song at the league's 1988 induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame "like at the end of the movie." 
"Oh yeah, that's our song!" Sears said. "I tell you what, when you see your name up on that list at Cooperstown ... I got tears." 
The women said the players still remain in contact, and 438 attended the league's 50th reunion a few years back to reminisce about their days in the AAGPBL and how much playing baseball has affected their lives. 
"It was the experience of a lifetime, really, especially for 1943," Sears said.

Professors awared fellowship 
Cobb, Douthwaite among 187 recipients of prestigious Guggenheim 
Special to The Observer 

Two University of Notre Dame faculty members are among the 187 artists, schol­ars, and scientists receiving prestigious Guggenheim fel­lowships this year, according to an announcement last week from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. 
Paul M. Cobb, associate professor history and fellow of the Medieval Institute, and Julia V. Douthwaite, professor of French and assistant provost for international studies, were elected Guggenheim fellows from a field of some 3,000 appli­cants. 
Cobb, a specialist in Islamic social and cultural history, is the author of a recently pub­lished biography of a 12th century Syrian hero entitled "Usama ibn Munqidh: Warrior Poet of the Age of Crusade." Douthwaite, a spe­cialist in 18th and early 19th century French literature. is at work on a literary history of the French Revolution. She is the author of two books and the co-editor of three volumes of essays in her field. 
Guggenheim fellowships have been given annually since 1925 to writers, play­wrights, painters, sculptors, photographers, film makers, choreographers, physical and biological scientists, social scientists and scholars in the humanities "on the basis of distinguished achievement in the past and exceptional promise for future accom­plishment." Past fellows include photographer Ansel Adams, composer Aaron Copland. poet Langston Hughes, scientist Linus Pauling and novelist Eudora Welty. 
Study looks at fetnale role tnodels 
Special to The Observer 

A study by two University of Notre Dame political scientists shows that the more women politicians are made visible in national news coverage, the more likely young women are to become politically active. 
David Campbell and Christina Wolbrecht, authors of "See Jane Run: Women Politicians as Role Models for Adolescents," found that female adolescents' interest in politics is heightened by female candidates -in par­ticular, those campaigning for high-profile offices. 
"A highly visible woman in the future -perhaps even as the top of a major party presi­dential ticket -has the potential to generate signifi­cant interest in political activ­ity," the authors report. 
Campbell and Wolbrecht found that girls' increased interest in politic-s can be ini­tiated by women running for office and, then. further heightened by discussions with a parent or another adult family member. 
"Visible female candidates trigger conversations about politics between parents and their adolescent daughters, familiarizing girls with the political world and leading them to envision themselves as participants in politics," according to the authors. 
The study was published in the March edition of "The Journal of Politics." 
A member of the Notre Dame faculty since 2002, Campbell is an assistant pro­fessor of political science and faculty fellow in the Institute for Educational Initiatives. In 2002, he received a national award for the best disserta­tion in American government from the American Political Science Association for his dissertation titled "How Communities and Schools Shape Civic Engagement." His areas of specialty include American politics, political participation. religion and politics, and educational poli­cy. 

The Packey J. Dee Associate Professor of Political Science, Wolbrecht has been a member of the Notre Dame faculty since 1997. She is the author of the award-winning book "The Politics of Women's Rights: Parties, Positions, and Change." Her areas of special­ty include American politics, political parties, interest groups, mass behavior, and gender politics.

"These kinds of leaves of absence should be extraordi­nary and the cases should be compelling or strong," Jacobs said. "The reasons for study abroad are not just 'I want to be in a country that's interesting, warm or fun,' but involves a set of courses that they couldn't find in South Bend or in any of. the other programs." 
To study abroad in an outside program during the academic year, a student takes a leave of absence from his college. The dean of the college must approve the leave of absence, and 
then the request "The program has s t u d y is sent to the reg-enabled me to get an leaves of istrar's office. absence

leaves of absence, said Jennie Bracket, Grading and Academic Records Specialist for the Office of the Registrar. 
Ching, a political science major enrolled in the Old College Undergraduate Seminary Program, became interested in Leuven after the director of the Old College pro­gram described it as "a place to send a seminarian to study abroad without taking him out of a seminary." 
"The program has enabled me to get an abroad experience while retaining seminary life, the Liturgy of the Hours, daily Eucharist, spiritual direction, etc.," Ching said in an e-mail. 
In the College of Science, 
Assoeiate Dean Sister Cathleen ........ Cannon oversees applications for study leaves of absence. Cannon regulates the number of leaves by verifying the absence is for academic reasons and not just so the student can go abroad. 
"I ask the student to write a statement of how this is going to advance their academic pro­gram,'' Cannon said. "Decisions are made based on academic priorities." 
To ensure the prospective 

curriculum is equivalent to courses given at Notre Dame, Cannon researches the stu­dent's desired sehool and pro­gram and evaluates whether Notre Dame will accept transfer grades from the school. In some cases, Cannon knows from past experiences that certain schools and programs are unreliable at sending transcripts back. 
"I want them to be sure that they are getting good informa­tion and that they know before they go whether classes will count or how they will count," Cannon said. 
Samuel Gaglio, assistant dean of the Mendoza College of Business, said the most fre­quent reason he has had stu­d e n t s apply for 
p r o ­
grams. 

"When a student asks me about it, there has to be a sig­nificant academic component...that could be an exception," Gaglio said. 
In the architecture and engi­neering colleges, the instance of study leaves of absence is much less frequent. John Uhran, sen­ior associate dean in the College of Engineering, said during the past three years only one stu­dent has taken a study leave of absence. 
"It is not an issue in the College of Engineering," Uhran said. 
In the rare case that a student does study abroad. Uhran researehes the prospective school's reputation, the cours1~s olfernd and the eoursn syllabi to ensure "quality eontrol." 
Uhran said it is the College's goal to graduate its student<> in four years, pointing out that many of the approximately 40 pereent of each class of engi­neering students who go abroad do so in the summer. 
The School of Architecture is unique in that a study abroad program is built into the cur­riculum -third year students spend two semesters studying in Rome. A<>sistant Dean Father Richard Bullene said he has never been approached by an architecture student asking for a study leave of absence. 
"Theoretically, we would entertain the thought of if someone has a grand idea," Bullene said. "I suppose I could imagine it, but it has never hap­pened." 
Assistant Dean Jennifer Nemecek in the College of Arts and Letters said leaves of absence are a great option for students who fail to find a pro­gram that suits their needs in the regular study abroad offer­ings. 
"It's a wonderful program to complement a student's aca­demic portfolio," Nemecek said. This year, Arts and Letters stu­dents took leaves of absence to countries including Argentina, Madagascar and Switzerland. 
For Ching, a leave of absence has given him a ehance to study abroad while continuing his academic course and seminary training. 
'There is a much broader and greater variety of views and it gives me a chance to meet other seminarians who are studying for a diocese and rmables me to grow in my understanding of the Priesthood, both in the diocesan and consecrated reli­gious context,'' Ching said.

Suicide bomber kills 41 in public park 
KARACHI, Pakistan -A suicide attacker deto­nated a bomb during an outdoor Sunni Muslim prayer service Tuesday, killing at least 41 people and wounding dozens. In the mayhem that fol­lowed, angry mobs torched cars and hurled rocks at police, who fired warning shots in the air. 
The attacker blew himself up near leaders of the Sunni Tehrik religious group, which helped organize the prayer service at a downtown Karachi park. police chiefNiaz Siddiqui said. 
The religious leaders were sitting near a stage erected in front of the thousands of Sunni Muslims marking the birth of Islam's Prophet Muhammad. Several leaders were killed. 
"The bomber used about 5 kilograms [11 pounds] of explosives obtained locally, and we have collected his body parts," Siddiqui told The A'lsoeiated Press.

WA')HINGTON -Systems to track supplies, aid victims and deliver quick information to all levels of government during a disaster will be ready by the June 1 start of the hurricane sea­son, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said Tuesday. 
The changes are among 11 top emergency response priorities identified by the White House after last year's plodding federal response to Hurricane Katrina. 
Chertoff said all 11 reforms will be in place by the hurricane season's start. But he noted that much of the success or failure in responding to di'lasters will depend on how well state and local officials work with Washington and have their own emergency plans in place.

Leader reveals nuclear abilities 
White House presses for U.N. to impose restrictions on uranium enrichment 
Associated Press 

TEl-IRAN -Iran's hard­line president said Tuesday that the country "has joined the club of nuclear coun­tries" by successfully enriching uranium for the first time -a key process in what Iran maintains is a peaceful energy program. 
The announcement from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was certain to heighten international ten­sions surrounding Iran's nuclear program. The U.N. Security Council has demanded that Iran stop all enrichment by April 28 because of suspicions the program is designed to make nuclear weapons. 
Ahmadinejad warned the West that trying to force it to abandon uranium enrich­ment would "cause an ever­lasting hatred in the hearts of Iranians." 
The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, was heading to Iran on Wednesday for talks aimed at resolving the standoff. The timing of the announce­ment suggested Iran want­ed to present him with a fait accompli and argue that it cannot be expected to entirely give up a program showing progress.

The IT department has not yet determined the exact quota or cost of printing but they are looking at different systems as models, Fowlkes said,. 
"Hight now I we] are looking at Notre Dame's system, which allows students to print 1.000 pages per year. Any sheet over that would cost about ten cents," he said. 
But whether or not Saint Mary's uses the same printing service as Notre Dame has yet to be determined. Fowlkes said it is one of many operating units the school is considering and a deci­sion has not been reached. 
Freshman Jessica Porter said she is not opposed to the adop­tion of a model like Notre Dame's. 
"I'm glad they are setting a quota instead of just including an additional fee into tuition, because some of us won't use all of our allotted 1,000 pages," she said. "This is a fair way to do it." 
Like Porter, sophomore Kelly Maus said she thinks that setting a quota is a feasible way to manage student printing.

I've used and how much I have left," Maus said. 
Hausman said tracking the quota will be easy for students. When a student logs into a clus­ter computer, a small window will appear to notify the student how much of her print quota is remaining. When a documented is printed, a window will reveal each paper's name, amount of pages and specific printer. 
The student will then be prompted to enter her Saint Mary's username and password to confirm the print job. 
"This extra layer of security will prevent students from using up someone else's print quota if they forget to log out of a duster computer," Hausman said. The number of pages printed will then be subtracted from the student's remaining print quota. 
Students who exceed their print quota will be able to pur­chase print cards that will give them a pin numbnr to enter into a Web page and increas1~ their quota. 
This method allows students to increase their quota as need­ed, llausman said, without hav­ing to wait for others to manual­ly increase their quota.

John Sandner, the retired chair of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the chair of the new futures group of E*trade noticed an increase in waste over the past two years. And Fowlkes said many students have disregarded the College's spoken printing quota. 
"We begged and pleaded with students to be mindful of their printing habits," he said. "We even restricted printing multiple copies of a document and we posted signs with instructions on how to print on both sides to encourage students to be less wasteful." 
However, these educational initiatives have had minimal effect. llausman said, and Saint Mary's still pays for excessive paper waste. 
Fowlkes said he wants stu­dent<; to see the positive aspects of' implanting such a system, as the money that would bn spent on wasted printing supplies will go toward exeiting new todmol­ogy for the College.

Boston Sci.-Guidant obtains clearance 
NATICK, Mass. -Boston Scientific Corp. said Tuesday it has won antitrust clearance from the European Commission for its $27 billion acquisi­tion of medical devices rival Guidant Corp., but is still awaiting final approval from the Federal Trade Commission. 
Boston Scientific said it continues to expect the acquisition to close around the middle of this month. 
Tuesday's European clearance came six days after Boston Scientific won approval from the FTC's staff by entering into consent agreements to resolve antitrust issues. The company didn't pro­vide details on the agreements, but said they don't require major changes to the transaction. 
FTC spokesman Mitch Katz declined to com­ment Tuesday on when the commission would complete its review. 
To satisfy concerns that the combined company could command too great a share of the market for heart stents, Boston Scientific agreed before the regulatory reviews to sell a piece of Guidant's business, including its drug-coated stents, to a third company. Abbott Laboratories Inc., based near Chicago, will pay $4.1 billion in cash, provide a $900 million loan to Boston Scientific and acquire $1.4 billion in Boston Scientific stock. 

Pfizer attempts to spark Viagra sales 
NEW YORK-In a sign of how Pfizer Inc. hopes to boost the market for erectile dysfunction drugs, the maker of impotency pill Viagra plans to launch a second non-branded, educational ad campaign about the condition on Wednesday to complement one running since late last year. 
The double-dose of education comes as Pfizer tries to lift Viagra's sagging sales, which have droppnd in each of the la..<>t two years. 
The new campaign is designed to help men oven~ome embarrassment about discussing erec­tile dysfunction with their doctor while the ads whieh began l~L'it November were created to deliv­er more basic information about the condition, said Tim Pigot, direetor of the company's U.S. Viagra team.

Skilling testifies in Enron trial 
Former CEO proclaims 'absolute' innocence on stand during questioning 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON -Former Enron Corp. Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling told jurors in his fraud and conspiracy trial Monday that he abruptly resigned from the energy trading company a few months before it collapsed because he was worn out and trou­bled by its falling share price -not because he knew disaster loomed. 
"I am absolutely inno­cent," Skilling said right after he swore to tell the truth while testifying in his own defense Monday. 
Then he let jurors know what's at stake for him: 
"I guess in some ways my life is on the line, so I'm a little nervous." 
As he testified, he became more relaxed and conver­sational, with no hint of the swaggering bravado for which he was known when he ran what was once the nation's seventh-largest company. Known for his plainspoken manner as he led Enron's transformation from a staid pipeline com­pany into an energy giant, Skilling addressed jurors directly, his eyebrows raised slightly, looking earnest and alert. 

At times he appeared self-deprecating, even telling jurors that he was admitted to Harvard would flame out in scandal trial.

Hundreds of protesters also turnml out in Bordeaux in the southwest, Hennes in western France and Grenoble in the southeast -places where thousands had marched a week earlier.

The rejected measure was part of a broad equal-opportu­nity law aimed at youths from tho suburbs, whero nearly one youth in two is jobless in some areas. The law would have allowed employers to fire workors under age 26 at any time during a two-year trial period with no r11ason.

ITALY 
Police capture n1ajor n1afia boss Bernando Provenzano 
The arrest of Italy's number one fugitive comes after 40 years of spurning authorities and hiding in secret locals 
Associated Press 
PALERMO, Sicily -Italy's No. 1 fugitive and reputed Mafia "boss of bosses" practically thumbed his nose at authorities for more than 40 years. 
He counted on Sicilians' cen­turies-old mistrust of the state to help him on the run, sleeping in islanders' homes, having his children born at local hospitals, even sending the public health care system a bill for prostate treatment abroad under a false name. 
But police finally caught up with Bernardo "The Tractor" Provenzano on Tuesday in a farmhouse outside his power base, Corleone -the town that inspired the family name in "The Godfather." 
In the end, Provenzano was done in not by an informer or a rival gangster, but by a delivery of clean laundry. Police tracked the package to his hideout and closed in when they saw his hand peek out of the door to lake it. 
Provenzano had escaped cap­ture so often since going into hiding in 1963 that he earned a place in the Italian imagination as "The Phantom of Corleone." He got his nickname "The Tractor" for the determination he displayed in a mob career that began as a hitman. 
He is believed to have taken over leadership of the Sicilian Malia following the 1993 arrest of former boss Salvatore 'Toto" Riina. During his years on the run, Provenzano was convicted in absentia and given life sen­tences for more than a dozen murders of mobsters and inves­tigators. 
"Bastard! Murderer!" a crowd shouted at the 73-year-old Provenzano as black-hooded policemen took him out of a sedan and rushed him into the courtyard of a police building in Palermo after driving him from the countryside. 
Wearing tinted glasses and a wind-breaker, the gray-haired Provenzano held up his hand­cuffed hands as he was hustled away but made no audible com­ment. 
Investigators described an extensive operation to track down the mobster. They said cameras that can see up to a mile were trained on suspected accomplices as well as the Corleone home where Provenzano's wife and children live. 
A few days ago, police noticed a package leave the wife's house, then get delivered by car to a series of other homes. On Tuesday morning, the package left Corleone and was driven to the farmhouse where Provenzano was found staying with a shepherd who doubled as a housekeeper. 
"This morning he reached out with a hand to grab the package and that's when we decided to move in," said Nicola Cavaliere, a top police oflicial in Rome. 
Italy's national anti-Mafia prosecutor, Piero Grasso, told reporters in Rome that Provenzano was "impassive" and "didn't say a word" when arrested, but later acknowl­edged his identity. 
The last photos that investiga­tors had of the mobster showed him as a young man, but police gave the fugitive a "new face" last year -issuing a composite picture drawn with help from a Mafia turncoat in 2001 that depicted him with white hair and hollow cheeks. 
That effort also was helped by descriptions from personnel at a clinic in Marseilles, France, where investigators say Provenzano sought treatment for a prostate tumor two years ago. 
Turncoats had told investiga­tors that Provenzano slept in different farmhouses every few nights across Sicily, an island where organized crime has held sway for decades. 
He allegedly gave orders with written notes -not trusting cell phone conversations for fear of being monitored by police. Grasso said investigators were studying notes found at the farmhouse, along with a type­writer Provenzano apparently used for writing them. 
After taking over the top lead­ership, Provenzano helped the Mafia spread its tentacles into the lucrative world of public works contracts in Sicily, turn­ing the mob-into more of a white-collar industry of illegal activity -with less dependance on traditional operations like drug trafficking and extortion, investigators have said. 

During the years when Riina was the Mafia chieftain, mur­ders bloodied Sicily. Mob rivals, police, prosecutors and their bodyguards, and sometimes bystanders, were cut down by bombings and drive-by shoot­ings. 
Then the bomb assassinations in Sicily of Italy's two top anti­Mafia fighters, magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, two months apart in 1992 galvanized many Sicilians against the mob, helping chip away at the centuries-old "omerta" -the island's code of silence and mistrust of authori­ties.

In whose image? 
Whnn I investigated the follo~g topic, I felt an 800-word piece would not do itjus­tiee. In this week's pieee, I will be drawing from researeh on eating and other related health and psycholo~-,rical disorders in women and men. In two weeks, through interviews and com­menl'i from you, I want to try to give a picture of how these issues manifest them­selves here, what treatment is available and where we all can do better to address people struggling with eating disorders and body image issues. 
Around last Easter season, the media was aflame with cover­age of Terri Schiavo. The conversation sur­rounded whether her feeding tube should be mmoved in her comatose state. The sit­uation was immediately swept in tl1e dia­logue of the "sanctity oflife." whieh it should have been -however not solely about euthanasia. The media and political fi1cus on the deeision of Schiavo's passing, after being on life assistance since 1990, left out the reason she was in the coma. Schiavo had bulimia nen,osa and collapsed and passed out during a purging of a meal. 
Eating disorders and negative body image issues should be thought of as a life issue. We are taught we are all made in thn image of God, yet people who suffer from eating disorders see themselves a'i distorted, unworthy and imperfect people. In the mirror they see negative -too fat or too thin. Their actions-eating, exer­cise, etc. -are taken in response to fear of being overweight, not muscular, not attraetive and not the ideal weight. The images of others, media, toys, fashion and conceptions of the perfect body become internalized to drive destructive decisions. 
The National Association ofAnorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders esti-

mate the number affiicted at seven million women and one million men. People of all difl'erent backgrounds are affected. Anorexia nervosa involves, according to ANAD, a refusal by the patient to maintain a body weight proportional to height and age. Usually 15 percent below what physi­cians would consider appropriate, people suffering from anorexia nervosa employ dillerent tactics to slim down out of "an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat." The tactics, which ANAD list from forced starvation to becoming vegetarian, do not seem as crucial as the psychological motivation bP-hind it -a desire to look dif­n~rent, fear of getting fat and distorted vip,w of one's weight. The death rate for anorexia is the highest out of all psychi­atric illnesses. 
Bulimia nervosa involves a cycle of uncontrolled bingn eating, depressed fenl­ings motivatnd by over-fixation on weight and purging f()od through a variety of methods. Bulimics may bn under-or ovnr­weight, yet to them their bodies are not good enough. Both diseases result in seri­ous hP-alth and psychological problems that can seep through all areas of one's life. 
Binge eating disorder IBEDl involves eat­ing more than would or should in a short period of time. The patient feels out of con­trol when they eat. Usually done in secret, BED sufferers may not delight in the taste of the food. The eating pattern and emo­tional stress in hinging mirrors bulimia, yet BED sufferers do not purge. 
An often forgotten disorder, mainly expe­rienced by males, is muscular dysmorphia. Instead of shedding pounds, males with this illness over-exercise, lift weights, con­trol diet and may use steroids to build muscle. 'like in anorexia, muscular dys­morphia involves a distorted body image and desire to look a certain way. Men with this illness are obsessed with their body image, however they may not want them­selves to be seen in public and hide their bodies in bulky clothes. Going to drastic measures of steroids, their goal is to build unrealistic musdes. Men also can sufler from the other conditions discussed. Men olton go unnoticed or underrepresented in eating disorder conversations because these illnesses have been culturally tied to women. We a'isume men are not con­cerned with body image, or as a society things like building musdes arc interpret­ed a'i a good thing. We hold up bulky aetion stars and consider strength as a neutral good. Yet, people with muscular dysmorphia often see themselves in a mir­ror as scrawny and weak-not ma<;culine and unattractive. 
The eauses of thnsn diseases are many -from upbringing to media. Particularly the media -from billboards, magazines, toys, movies and tnlcvision -shapes how we see the idnal weight li1r men and women. Slim female celebrities are hnld a'i standards of beauty, while chiseled under­wear models dnfine how mnn should look. All these images come down to us and become intnrnalized in the way we sen eaeh other and ourselves. 
Concerning eating disordnrs and body image issuns, the notion of our bodies a'i mani!i~stations of the divine is absent in this mirror. We forget ourselves bnyond shape, size and weight. Yet, the solution is beyond aflirming human dignity. People sull'er from thesn disea'ins need sit,'llifkant time and support to reeover. Studies show even awarennss may be unadvisable. Learning the taeties to changing body weight can fuel these disorders. So, I am hoping to hnar from you on how we ean better attaek these issues here at Notre Dame. Your fi~edbaek will be the content for my next and final eolumn.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
'Joke' reveals ignorance 

A stereotype is a common thought circu­lated to a large amount of people that is often untrue. Many stereotypes have spread through the intelligent minds of the students in the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's communities that are idiotic and completely false. The women of Saint Mary's are intelligent, confident and funny, with as good of a sense of humor as the men and women of Notre Dame. They can take a joke. 
Yet. a joke is defined as something that is funny and makes others laugh. Sometimes, stereotypes can often be mis­understood as jokes and make the teller of the joke seem ignorant and foolish. Therefore, the Board of Governance at Saint Mary's is sending out this plea to all those who disperse rumors and stereo­types of both institutions to only tell funny jokes and refrain from making yourself look idiotic by spreading false statements as hilarity. You undermine your intelli­gence by telling lies and scattering gossip to others who recognize your statements as untrue. Therefore. we are merely sav­ing you from the sheer humiliation of being caught within a web of lies. 
We would like the two institutions to base their relationship on a healthy foun­dation. which will promote a greater rela­tionship in the future. This is why we would like to describe how amazing the women of Saint Mary's are, and how phe­nomenal the Notre Dame community is. 
The women of Saint Mary's pride them­selves on their empowering attitudes, which are reflected in their volunteer work in the community and through their leadership capabilities that are shown in both campuses. They work hard to display their academic abilities in the classroom that have been recognized nationally through awards that sometimes go unseen because of the small campus atmosphere. When they graduate from Saint Mary's, they enter the world as fabulous women who use their Saint Mary's education to soar in a male-dominated world. 
Notre Dame is recognized as one of the top universities in the nation and boasts an academic field which is rivaled by few institutions. The Catholic mission that the University prides itself with accepts con­troversial topics head on without flinching. The pride that oozes from the University's campus spreads throughout the world where people recognize a student of Notre Dame with utter respect for their inte,lli­gence and wonderful attitudes. 
Why would a student of either of these institutions demean himself or herself bv spreading statements that are untrue? The people that attend these schools are much too brilliant to want to appear ignorant in the eyes of others, whether on these cam­puses or throughout the world. Hopefully the students of both campuses will under­stand that a joke is meant for people to laugh at and a person who spreads a stereotype or gossip is also to be laughed at.

Comic too tame 
Having noticed the barrage of Viewpoint letters addressing the offensive nature of a recent "Jockular" comic strip, I feel the need to voice my opinion. Many readers have become genuinely upset with the cartoon because it portrayed Saint Mary's students as the parasites to Notre Dame's host cell. Although these people may be justified in their discon­tent, they are all missing the big­ger issue which should be obvi­ous when they read The Observer's comics section. Plain and simple, Adam Fairholm's "CroissantWorld" is not offensive enough. Let's analyze the strip that appeared in the March 30 edition of the paper to see where he's going wrong. 
The first frame shows two char­acters alone in complete silence. This is a typical Fairholm mistake -no dialogue. He could have easily had one of them make a racist remark. There was enough space above their heads, and all he needed to do was draw in a bubble and put in some words. Opportunity: missed. 
In the next frame, the guy on the left wonders aloud about the activities that occur within the mysterious Knights of Columbus building on campus. Instead, he could have said that Holy Cross students are stalked ciliated pro­tozoa. Opportunity: missed again. 
The third frame has a man in a top hat from inside the building giving a response to the previ­ously-made query. He says, "It involves fun, spinach dip and bows and arrows." Fairholm probably should have had the man say, "It involves lep­rechauns, who accurately repre­sent the drunken Irish ancestry of the student body." Opportunity: thrice missed. 
In the final frame, one charac­ter points out that the man with the top hat was wearing sus­penders without a shirt, to which the other character responds, "Yeah." This reply does not cut it. Instead, they should have rec­ognized him as a homosexual and then immediately started praying the gay away like good Catholics. Opportunity: I've lost count. 
Now that I've brought this to everyone's attention, I hope we can forget about the recent "Jockular" controversy and start focusing on more important issues, like the problems with "BagelTown," or whatever it's called.

Dangerous love games 

Don't hate the player, hate the game. 
In 2005, U.S. computer and video game software sales grew to seven billion dollars, doubling the industry sales since 1996, according to the Entertainment Software Association. 
It's been a long, strange trip for society as more people -a figure Andrew that has reached 50 percent -Hanelly view reality through a 20-inch monitor than ever before. Daily Collegian 
We're used to tales of violence, Penn State war and "Grand Theft Auto" writ­University ten into the scripts online garners rehearse with, but this summer online game manufacturers are taking one step clos­er to simulated sin -They're turning the keyboard into a sex toy. 
And millions of people will be playing with it. The ironically named "Safe Escape Studios" will release the headliner in the concert of online sexploitation, dubbed "Naughty America: The Game," which will be asking potential players, "Why don't we do it in the Information Superhighway?" 
"Naughty America" touts itself as the "evolution of online dating," where players can log in to a simu­lated computer world as a voluptuous cartoon char­acter with the mission of flirting and finding friends with benefits. The players have the eventual goal of spending the virtual night together at their own online apartment, or in a "public sex zone" built into the cyber scene. 
If this is the evolution of online dating, then it's time to turn off the computers. At least with online dating there is the notion that eventually the two parties will meet in "real life." But online games offer a sex life acted out vicariously through animat­ed cartoon characters, so you never have to do it the real way. 
For years, video games have allowed us to take on the role of Major League Baseball players, celebri­ties like 50 Cent and James Bond and superhuman characters with the world in the palms of their hands. Now we're putting flirtation at the fingertips of garners, where sexual exploration is the new Super Mario world but with a different kind of scor­ing. 
This combines Internet dating with the motel off the interstate -a seedy little place where sneaky little people can tiptoe out of public view and plant the virtual seed. 
Sex is now sold to us in our movies, music, sports and even our fast food. The litmus test of our society turns red because we've packaged promiscuity into everything we do, including recreation. 
But the "gamification" of romance sends the wrong message to kids raised by video games. Facilitating our basic instinct with computers is another shower of depravity on our already sex-drenched society. Sonic the Hedgehog wouldn't have endorsed this. 
Sex as a game? Sex as the exchange of coded bits of information transmitted through broadband con­nections? Sure does sound sexy. 
But maybe we should be thanking technology for its take on "safe sex." If people are going to fantasy worlds to act out their primal urges then maybe they won't be practicing promiscuity in the proverbial real world. And those still in the real world may have a hard time practicing anything with cyber­sexaholics because their hands are more accus­tomed to typing than to ... fill in your own blank. 
So maybe the computer prevents the negative ram­ifications of real sex better than the condom. But we've now made it so that people don't even need to leave their desk chairs anymore to pick up people. 
Getting lucky now depends on the stability of your Internet connection. Video games by nature offer an escape from reality, a chance to be someone or something else and do things only imaginable before. But these role-playing games toy with our notion of interpersonal relationships. Games are for playing, and love is for making in real life. 
We're supposed to type love letters to loved ones, not type sexual innuendos in glorified visual chat rooms. Or maybe this is the modern version of "Love Story," where the virtue of love is shared virtually. 
If so, count me out. I have a real game to play. Pong anyone?

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 



Reasoning opinions 
In response to Professor Miscamble's lengthy and vicious open letter to University President Father John Jenkins in yester­day's paper, I would just like to make one point, shortly and sweetly: 
Setting the merits of "The Vagina Monologues" aside, I take issue with your attempt at lambasting Jenkins for changing his mind on this topic. You tear into him for, as you say, "backing down" and assert that it is, "hard to understand it in any other terms." This comes as a surprise to me. On a daily basis, you teach hundreds of stu­dents in an attempt to help them round out their general knowledge and various topics. I'm guessing that on numerous occasions, you have influenced a student to change their opinion on one of these topics. 
As a student, I can say from personal experience that I have done this countless times over the past 17 years of my life. (Kindergarten was particularly grueling.) I have never once thought that the reason that I did this was because I lacked a strong will, or that I was seeking to gain popularity with those attempting to educate me. 
It is a bit troublesome that a professor such as yourself would be unable, as you say, to see why someone would change his or her mind based on the influx of new information. Personally, this is a trait I like to see and respect in my leaders, and I quite favor it over the apparent tyrant you would prefer. Perhaps you could take a page from some of your colleagues' books and stop vil­ifying Jenkins for changing his mind. He may have had a legitimate reason for doing so.

library is an old school Disney classic. Even the prissiest of girly girls has a well-worn and bnloved copy of "Pitch Black" hidden beneath her mattross. In tlH\ end. it's the old adage that holds true -o1w man's trash is another man's guilty pleasure. 
Dirty Dancing (1987) 
Argued by its devotens to be thn greatest danl~­ing film in all of cinema, "Dirty Dancing" is a coming-of-age tale with one of the decade's best soundtracks. Frances (Baby) Houseman 
(Jennifer Grey) is a Jewish teenag­er whose family vacations annual­ly at a ho-hum Catskills resort. This particular summer, however. at the cusp of the 1960s, will change Baby's life forever, after she meets Johnny Castle (a pre­"Hoadhouse" Patrick Swayzn}. the handsome dance instructor with a shady past. 
Cinema dogma insists these two be together, and thn audienen has no objection, especially with mul­tiple dance sequences and the cheesiest (thereby the best) d ia­logue in the business. Through their synchronized mambo skill and chemistry. they flnd "the time of their lives." 
"Dirty Dancing" has it all -a great male lead for the women, irresistible dancing and drama, and Disney's Lumiere himself, Jerry Orbach, as Baby's father. In the end, however, one undeniable truth remains -nobody puts Baby in a corner. 
Legally Blonde (2001) 
Like, ever wanted to go to Harvard Law? In this popular legal farce, Californian Elle Woods

Elle, determined to win him back, follows him to Cambridge and becomes a successful lawyer in her own right. 
What makes "Legally Blonde" the guilty pleas­ure that it has become for so many is the film's semblance of just enough realism to feel plausi­ble in the kind of world where the material of choice for a toilet seat cover is faux fur. Elle wins a major murder case using her intuition and a unique brand of smarts, uncovering the true murderer with the chemical equation for a successful perm. If Elle Woods can succeed at Harvard, and land cute lawyer Luke Wilson in the process, then so can the scrubby-sweat­pants-clad Notre Dame or Saint Mary's girl watching her on screen.

3 Ninjas (1992) 
Some of the most unbelievable, yet entertain­ing movies made are the type where young chil­dren outwit and defeat menacing enemies. The original "3 Ninjas" film fits this description per­fectly and stands as a quintessential guilty pleasure movie. 
The premise is simple. Three brothers learn martial arts from their elderly grandfather to prepare them for the real world. Through some tenuous plot maneuvers, the boys are kidnapped by their grandfather's enemy and must use their martial arts techniques to defeat the enemy.

It follows in the tradition of movies such as "Home Alone," where humor and entertainment come from a young child outsmarting and taking advantage of dim witted bad guys. A belief in the underdog makes for good cinema. 
Labyrinth (1986) 
This fantasy film about a young girl who ven­tures into a mythical labyrinth to save her brother from goblins is often dismissed as a crazy 80s children's movie that is scarier than it is funny. While this description may be true, "Labyrinth" is a film that is easy to love in pri­vate but disown in public. 
A young Jennifer Connelly ventures into a bizarre labyrinth inhabited by creatures dreamed up by Muppet creator Jim Henson. llenson 's ereative genius is on full display here in a world more grown up than that of the Muppets. The puppets in this film seem like real actors thanks to the life given to them by Henson and his team. 
Another endearing quality of the movie is the presence of David Bowie the actor -as the evil Goblin King -and Bowie the singer -as musi­cal director for the film. Bowie often randomly bursts into song throughout "Labyrinth," belting out cheesy 80s tunes that add a touch of nostal­gia to the movie. 
"Labyrinth" is not really meant for kids. The mature writing and plot appeal to the inner child in anyone who watches the film. Its unique 
style and charm give the film a

Drago. In a movie series that should have ended after the second movie, film quality is most certainly lacking here. Audiences know what they are in for as soon as the open­ing credits inform them that the film is both written and directed by Sylvester Stallone. 
The not-so-subtle allusions to the struggle between capitalism and communism in the film provide much of the entertainment, especially when Russian crowd members begin to cheer for Rocky in the final fight, as if to symbolize the inevitable conversion from communism to capi­talism in Russia. 
The plot and fights of the film are hardly believable and it is this impossibility that makes 
SWEANY 
the movie so appealing. The "David vs.Goliath" message is a strong one that resonates with all viewers. An appearance from James Brown and the music of 80s bands like Survivor help make the movie inspirational and energetic. 
Thanks to all these qualities, "Rocky IV" is a movie worth watching all the way through whenever it is on television. While it did not win any major awards or receive acclaim for being a good film, it stands out as part of one of the most beloved An1erican action series of all time. Top Gun (1986) 
The high-testosterone, dangerous world of Navy fighter pilots comes to life in the 1980s thriller "Top Gun." A 24-year-old Tom Cruise launched his career in this somewhat political, 
high-action movie. 
In spitP. of these issues, "Top 
Gun" is still a guilty pleasure due to the entertainment value that comes with watching it. The intense action of the aerial dog fights is exciting and set a standard for future movies involving fighter jets. 
Director Tony Scott ("Days of Thunder", "Man on Fire,") brother of more respected Ridley, keeps the movie together and adds quality cine­matography and editing. "Top Gun" seems to be one of the first modern-era movies in that it tries to combine action, romance, comedy, and even tragedy into a two-hour summer block­buster. This enjoyable combination has since come to be the standard in blockbuster-oriented Hollywood, but the blend is perhaps most origi­nal and memorable in "Top Gun." Batman Forever (1995) 
The third installment in the adaptation of the Batman comic stands right in the middle of the decline of the franchise. Val Kilmer donned the Bat suit after Joel "Phone Booth" Schumacher took over the reins from previous director Tim Burton. Chris O'Donnell joined the cast as Robin and eventual Oscar winner Nicole Kidman plays the female lead. 
In spite of the A-list talent in the leading roles, this movie suffers from poor writing and worse acting from the protagonists. The supposed "Batman for a new generation" loses its way thanks to a mediocre story, which involves Bruce Wayne undergoing therapy to deal with his inner demons. Cheesy action scenes provide the icing on the cake in helping make this a meager excuse to rake in money. 
What saves the film is the maniacal acting of the two villains, Two-Face and the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones is a strong villain, but Jim Carrey steals the show as the Riddler. Carrey's comical one-liners and exaggerated actions gen­erate laughs and keep the story from becoming monotonous. Watching the bad acting of the heroes against the strong performances from the villains helps this movie achieve the status of a guilty pleasure and maintain a presence in the world of comic book movies. 
All of the above movies are well loved by fans across the world -despite their lack of critical acclaim. They are guilty pleasures, films that will be special no matter the quality of acting, writing or the film as a whole. 
Whether films like these are blemishes on the name of Hollywood or signs of the power of film to gain sentimentality, they will continue to be cherished by movie fans for a long time.

11ce Age: The Meltdown' a subpar letdown

Watehing movie sequels is like play­ing the lottery. Chances are slim that you will ar.tually win big, and, more orton than not. it is just a waste of tinw and rnonoy. "lee Age: The Meltdown" is like winning $25 on a scratr,h-ofT card -it's more than HXpPcted, but less than hoped for.

Overall, the vocal performances are good. While Queen l.atifah, Romano and Leguizamo all seem to be enjoying themselves, Leary appears to be less involved in the movie -but Diego was given less of the zinging one-liners, so it's not entirely his fault.

When the nearby glacier begins melting-thanks to Serat, the erazy squirrel -the ani­mals are forced to flee, encountering peril and adventure. Along the way film. 
"The Meltdown" is not all bad or questionable, however -it does have many enjoyable moments. In one scene, the vultures, excited about the impend­ing doom (and thus lots of food for them), perform the song "Food, Glorious Food" from the musical "Oliver!" in a truly entertaining num­ber. 
There's also Scrat. The highlight of 

the first film, he continues to be the most exciting element of the sequel. liP not only "causes" the meltdown but he also "fixes" it at the end. He was employed a great deal more in this film than he was in the first one. If a third film is made, Scrat can be expected to dominate the movie, as he is by far the most memorable and truly enjoyable character. He is also proof that film­makers do not need raunchy play­ground humor in order to win laughs ­something the writers should take note of, since that lower form of humor was all-too-present in "Thn Meltdown." 
Unless you really enjoyed the original "Ice Age" or are a fan of any animated movie regardless of quality, then you should not see this movie. But if you are forced to take a younger sibling over Easter break, don't worry ­because Scrat is your $25 win in the lottery.

Telfair is reminiscent of another famous Sebastian -namely, Johannes Sebastian Bach, only Bassy is a virtuoso with a bas­ketball instead of a conductor's wand. A child prodigy (Telfair first showed his unusual talent when he was six years old), he has a certain creative basketball genius that combines quickness with an active imagination. Telfair is frequently shown slicing his way through traflic for all man­ner of improbable Jayups and flashy no­look passes.

During one game, Telfair defeats fellow NBA prospect Dwight Howard's high school team with a last-second buzzer-beater, proving Bassy's "Telfair" for the dramatic. However, as his Abraham Lincoln High School team battles the other New York City teams on the way to the championship, Telfair suffers a scary experience with a turned ankle that demonstrates just how fragile his dream of NBA status is.

Mets spoil Nationals home opener with 7-1 win 
Rookie Bannister records first major league victory with three hits and one earned run in seven innings of work 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -No brawls, beanballs or even brushbacks Tuesday between the Nationals and Mets. 
No sellout and no bouncing stands, either, at Washington's home opener, which was much more low key in just about every way than last season, when big league baseball returned after a 34-year absence to plenty of fanfare. 
The announced crowd of 40,530 -more than 5,000 shy of capacity-didn't have much reason to root, root, root for the home team. Rookie Brian Bannister shut down Washington's struggling offense again for his first major league victory, and Carlos Beltran homered off the facing of the upper deck, leading the Mets past the Nationals. 
"This is a team that is built to win," said Bannister, whose father, Floyd, pitched in the majors. "I knew my role was to come in here and to lay low, to just eat up innings, to pitch any game they needed me to pitch, and to just give this team a chance to win every time. It wasn't to come in here and take over the show." 
But he did precisely that Tuesday, giving up three hits 
without  a  walk  over  seven  
innings.  The  lone  run  he  
allowed  was  on  Alfonso  

Soriano's homer in the seventh; last week in New York, the right-hander held the Nationals hitless for 5 1-3 innings in his big league debut. 
During that series at Shea 
Stadium, seven batters were hit -six by Mets pitchers -and a near-fight ensued. Nationals right-hander Felix Rodriguez and manager Frank Robinson were suspended by Major League Baseball; before Tuesday's game, Robinson said, both managers were told umpires would watch all season for any sign of trouble when the NL East rivals meet. 
"It was basically a warning: They have control of the game. It's up to them. It's what they feel about a certain pitch, and they don't have to wait to put in a warning," Robinson said. "Word is, there's bad blood between the two ballclubs, and every time we play they're going to put out a warning to the umpires." 
Players played down the possi­ble tension before the game, though Bannister (1-0) acknowl­edged afterward it was on his mind. 
"At the beginning of the game, I was a little timid throwing inside," he said. "Especially with Soriano, we did pitch away. As I got more comfortable, we start­ed going back in." 
No batter had to dive out of the way of an up-and-in heater. The only person who appeared to get nicked by a ball was plate umpire Brian O'Nora, when a foul tip bounced up and hit him below his mask. 
Padres 9, Marlins 3 
Khalil Greene says he tends to be a streaky home run hitter, and the Florida Marlins can vouch for that. 
Greene drove in four runs 
with two homers to help the San Diego Padres shake a slump, and they spoiled Florida's home opener by winning Tuesday. 
The Padres, who scored a major league-low 19 runs in the first week of the season, snapped a four-game losing streak. 
Greene hit a two-out solo homer in the second and a three-run shot in the sixth, giv­ing him four homers this season and a share of the NL lead with four others, including St. Louis slugger Albert Pujols. 
"I don't expect to be at the top at the end of the year," Greene said. "When I hit home runs, they tend to come in bunches. I've gone a long time without hitting any homers." 
Greene, who grew up in Key West, Fla., has four of the Padres' six home runs after hit­ting 15 each of the past two sea­sons. 
"He's got some pop," Padres manager Bruce Bochy said. "Khalil is going to be an offen­sive shortstop. He's going to sup­ply some power." 
Woody Williams (1-0) won in his first start as a replacement for Shawn Estes, sidelined by a strained elbow. Williams allowed three runs in five-plus innings. 
"I knew they had to dig deep in the well to throw me out there," Williams joked. 
Reds 9, Cubs 2 
Here's what Bronson Arroyo has shown the Cincinnati Reds since joining them less than a month ago: He can beat the Chicago Cubs and he can hit home runs off Glendon Rusch. 


Arroyo, with no homers in his first six major league seasons, hit his second off Rusch in six days Tuesday, one of six long balls by the Reds as they routed the Cubs on a windy day at Wrigley Field. 
"I got lucky again. Just kaep hacking," Arroyo said after throwing seven shutout innings and hitting a ball over the left­field bleachers that landed on in the first four innings. Edwin Encarnacion hit his first career grand slam and Austin Kearns followed with another homer, both off Will Ohman in the sixth. 
"He's got more homers than Wily Mo already," Dunn said of Arroyo, who was traded from the Red Sox on March 20 for Wily Mo Pena. 
"He's got a good swing. That's. impressive. He's shown me two tools so far."

Flyers fight for hon1e ice, beat Penguins 4-3 
Carter's power-play tally late in the third breaks 3-3 deadlock 
Associated Press 
J>IIII.AD EJ.J>II!A -Though thny play bnttnr on thn road, the Philadelphia Flyers are desperatldy trying to earn homn-il:n advantage in the first round of the playofl's. 
With four games remaining, it's simple for Philadelphia: Win out and sneurn thn No. 3 send in thn Eastern 
C«mfnrorH~(~. 
.Jell' Carl«~r·s power-play goal with h:32 lnft in the third peri­od lifted tlw Flyers to a 4-3 vietory ovnr the Pittsburgh l'onguins on Tunsday night. 
The Flyers wasted a 3-0 load, but oarrwd the victory to move within threo points of tho Atlantic Division-leading New York Hangers. The Hangers have just thren games loft, ineluding one meeting betwoon the teams. Philadelphia is fifth in the East. two points ahead of New .Jersey with two road games left against the Devils. 
''I've seen our fans just will us in playoff games," coach Ken llitchcock said. "I think homo-ieo is something you nnnd. It's very important. It's real difficult when you con­stantly havn to win road games in the playo!Ts." 
The Flynrs are 21-13-6 at the Waehovia Center, with only Saturday's game against the Hangers left at home. They are 22-11-5 on the road. 
Simon Gagne scored his 45th goal and .loni Pitkanen and Brian Savage also scored for the Flyers, who were without star center Peter Forsberg for the third straight game because of a groin injury. 
"It's a big win for us because we have a chance to win the division," Pitkanen said. "We've had a tough time at home. Maybe we feel a little more pressure. If you're going to win in the playoffs, you havn to win both [home and awayl." 
Michel Ouellet, Hyan Whitnny and Sidney Crosby scored for Pittsburgh, which already secured the worst record in the conference. 
After giving up three straight goals, the Flyers went ahead when their dismal special teams came through. 
Freddy Meyer took a slap shot from tho point that deflected ofT Niko Dimitrakos. 

Carter, standing at the side of the net, tucked the puck in for his 22nd goal to give the flyers a one-goal lead. 
"It was just kind of bouncing around out there," Carter said. 
Hobert Esche preserved it with several outstanding saves in a frantie final minute. Esche made 23 saves in his fourth start in five games for the Flyers, though Hitchcock has­n't announced whether Esche or Antero Niittymaki will be the playoll' starter. 
"Goaltending is the least of our problmns," llitchcock said. "Hight now, we have to have a killer instinct." 
.Just 1:23 after falling behind 3-0, Ouellet's power-play goal eut it to 3-1 in the second peri­od. 
The Penguins closed to 3-2 when Whitney seored just 92 sneonds into the third period. Whitney took a behind-the-net pass from Crosby and lilted it just under the crossbar. 
Five seeonds after failing to seore on a power play, the Penguins tied it at 3 on Crosby's 37th goal 8:16 into the third. 
"We've been there a lot this year. We've fallen behind and elimbed our way back, but it seems likn one mistake we make and sometimes it costs us," Crosby said. 
The Flyers seored their first two goals during 4-on-4 situa­tions after penalties wiped out two of their four power-play opportunities in the second period. 
Petr Nedved, back after missing four games with a groin injury, skated down the right side, turned and fed a pass to Gagne, who scored on a wristor before crashing into the right post and knocking the net off its moorings. 
Savage's ninth goal midway through the second put the Flyers ahead 2-0. Pitkanen sent a perfect centering pass from near the left boards to a streaking Savage, who redi­rected the puck past goalie Sebastien Caron. 
Pitkanen ripped a slap shot from the slot just inside the left post for his 13th goal, giv­ing the Flyers a 3-0 lead. 
Flyers enforcer Donald Brashear and Pittsburgh's Eric Cairns squared off in the third period immediately after both players left the penalty box, with Brashear landing a few solid shots early in the fight. Brashear got a rousing ovation as he returned to the penalty box and exchanged high-fives with some fans. 
Note to Self: Dress yourself BEFORE you start drinking this time. 
Happy 21st Carol!

U.S., Jamaica battle to 1-1 tie 
American Tony Meola earns his 100th cap in exhibition match up 
Associated Press 
CAHY, N.C.-Tony Meola got his 1OOth eap. Now he and the rest of the U.S. hopefuls ean only wait for coach Bruce Arena to choose the World Cup roster. 
"For me, it was just a great night, and I did it with a great group of guys that really appre­ciated the first 99 as much as they appreciated tonight," the 37-year-old goalkeeper said. "They let me know about it all week." 
Ben Olsen scored the tying goal in the 25th minute off a record-setting assist from Landon Donovan, Meola became the ninth U.S. player to reach 100 international appear­ances and the United States sal­vaged a 1-1 tie against .Jamaica on Tuesday night. 
It was the final exhibition 

game before Arena settles on the 23 players he will take to Germany this summer. A day earlier, he told the team not to worry about making the final cut. lie wanted them simply to have fun. 
"It's getting down to the nitty gritty," defender Chris Albright said. "I mean, obviously you enjoy playing the game, but everybody's thinking about making the team. I just tried to give it everything I had." 
Before the kickoff, Meola was honored as the ninth U.S. play­er to reach I 00 caps -soccer's term for international appear­ances. IIe was the starting goal­keeper at the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, and the No. 3 goal­keeper four years ago. 
Meola hadn't played for the national team since May 1(>, 2002, and his addition to the roster was seen largely as a symbolic gesture by Arena. Barely four minutes into the game, it appeared Meola might be in for a long night when .Jamaiea took a 1-0 lead. 
"We started slow. Give them credit, they eame at us," Meola said. "After about 15 or 20 min­utes, I thought we pkknd up the pace and played fairly well. All in a.ll. I thou~ht it was a good performance. 
Donovan got his 23rd career assist, moving him ahead of Los Angeles Galaxy teammate Cobi Jones for the most in national team history as the Americans avoided losing for tho first time in 17 games against .Jamaica (9-0-8). 
"Oh, that's right, I forgot about that," Donovan said when told of his reeord. "It was Cobi before, right? l got it in less caps, and I'll tell him this week. That's enol, man."

Associated Press 
NORMAN, Okla. -Jeff Capel was hired as Oklahoma's basketball coach Tuesday, resigning at Virginia Commonwealth to replace Kelvin Sampson and take over a program under NCAA investigation. 
VCU confirmed Capel's move in a statement from president Eugene Trani and athletic director Richard Sander. The Sooners scheduled an afternoon news conference on campus to introduce Capel. 
"We are both sad and happy with Jeff's announcement that he is 
going to Oklahoma," Sander said. "He did a great job here, and we know he will do a great job there." 
The 31-year-old Capel is a former Duke player who was 79-41 in four seasons as coach at VCU. 
He signed a two-year contract extension last month to keep him at the Richmond school through 2012. 
Instead, he will replace Sampson, hired as Indiana's coach March 29. The Sooners are awaiting a decision from the NCAA in a case involving more than 550 improper recruit­ing phone calls by Sampson and his staff. The accusations against Oklahoma include "lack of institutional control," one of the NCAA's most serious findings. 

Oklahoma has argued for a lesser "failure in monitoring" finding and instituted self-imposed sanctions including proba­tion and recruiting cut­backs. A hearing is sched­uled April 21 in Utah. 
Capel, whose father is an assistant coach for the Charlotte Bobcats, led VCU to the Colonial Athletic Association title and an NCAA tournament berth in 2004 and then to the NIT in 2005, the school's first 
consecutive postseason berths since 1985. 
His Rams finished this season 19-10 and did not make the postseason after losing to Hofstra in the conference tournament quarterfinals. 
The signature of his VCU teams was defense. This season, the Rams allowed 
62.4 points a game. On offense, they averaged only 12.5 turnovers and made nearly eight 3-point­ers a game. 
Sampson inherits an Oklahoma team that loses three of its top four scor­ers in seniors Taj Gray, Terrell Everett and Kevin Bookout. 
IN BRIEF 
District Attorney vows to 
pursue Duke rape case 
DURHAM, N.C.-Standing before a mostly black audience, the district attorney in charge of the Duke University rape investigation said Tuesday he does not need DNA to bring charges and vowed, "This case is not going away." 
District Attorney Mike Nifong spoke one day after defense attor­neys said DNA testing failed to con­nect any of Duke's lacrosse players to the alleged attack on a black stripper who said she was raped by members of the nearly all-white 4 7 -man team. 
Nifong stopped short of confirming the defense assessment of the DNA results, but said the case would not be hampered by a lack of DNA evi­dence. 
"It doesn't mean nothing hap­pened," Nifong said at North Carolina Central University, where the 27-year-old alleged victim is a student. "It just means nothing was left behind." 

University of Alabama 
booster killed in home 
MEMPHIS, Tenn. -An Alabama booster convicted of bribing a high school coach to get a top recruit for the Crimson Tide was killed in his home, police said Tuesday. 
Police and his defense attorney confirmed the death of Logan Young, 65, not saying how he was killed. 
Investigators found "a lot of blood," police Sgt. Vince Higgins said. "The nature of the attack was brutal." 
Higgins said there were signs of a struggle in the house, a two-story home in one of Memphis' most exclu­sive country club neighborhoods. 
Investigators don't know a motive or if the attack was related to Young's federal conviction, Higgins said. Police haven't determined how his home was entered or how many attackers there might have been. 
While police waited for fingerprints to identify the body, Nashville defense attorney Jim Neal confirmed the victim was Young. 
Adidas inks 11-year deal 
with the NBA 
FRANKFURT, Germany -Adidas signed an 11-year deal with the NBA on Tuesday, making the German ath­letic shoe company the official uni­form and apparel provider for the league. 
The company said the deal includes providing uniforms and other products for the WNBA and the NBA's development league starting with the 2006-07 season. 
Adidas, a marketing partner with the NBA since 2002, said the deal came as a result of last year's acqui­sition of Reebok International Ltd. The value of the deal wasn't immedi­ately disclosed by Adidas or the NBA, but shares of Adidas were up more than 2.9 percent to over $208 in Frankfurt trading after it was announced. 
Reebok will continue to be a global marketing partner of the NBA and will keep its ability to create NBA branded footwear.

Four Girls Who Have Never Touched a Basketball and One Guy Who Probably Shouldn't def. Team 50, forfeit 
Four Girls Who Have Never Touched a Basketball and One Guy Who Probably Shouldn't and Team 50 bat­tled Tuesday in a hotly-con­tested game, with Team 50 seemingly coming away with a 21-17 win. 
But Four Girls was awarded the victory by forfeit after Bookstore officials discovered that a Team 50 member has competed for multiple teams in the tournament, 40 min­utes into the game 
Even though the final score had Team 50 on top, the team was punished with a loss and an early Bookstore exit. 
Four Girls had no pity on them. 
"That was absolutely fool­ish," Four Girls guard Matt Bara said of the illegal roster move. 
Four Girls guard "Birthday Boy" Jimmy Wilson added that he was not impressed with Team SO's style of play. 
"They played like a bunch of nancies," he said. 
Spectators were confused that Four Girls was an all­male squad.

Both teams watched numer­ous shots sail off-target in the breeze. Unable to hit jump shots with any regularity, the ·squads adjusted their game plans and utilized their post players ­which gave a significant advan­tage to the taller Europeans. 
The Bookstore team also suf­fered an injury to one of their players midway through the second half. 
"They played a lot more phys­ical than we did, they controlled the boards," the Bookstore team said in a joint statement after the game. "They played at a tempo that they were comfort­able with." 
The European team said they planned to stay true to their roots and party like they do at home. 
"This was a good win," they said. "We're going to go out for some gyros, maybe some crepes, to celebrate in real European style."

ance by the team's designated sharpshooter "The Reverend" Kevin Stanley. Justice League closed the gap, but Picked Last 11-8 at half­time. 
"Our 2-3 zone was giving them fits for a while," Picked Last guard Eric Gast said at the half. 
Justice League went on a 3-0 run after the half and evened the score at 11-11. 
The score stayed close throughout a physical second half, which saw plenty of rebounds and steals by both 

teams. But tough post defense on both sides prevented both teams from capitalizing on their scoring opportunities. 
After running the score to 23­22, Justice League was in con­trol of the game despite missing a potential game-winning lay­up that prolonged the action for a few more possessions. But their height advantage eventu­ally proved too much for Picked Last to overcome. 
"It was a tough second half," Gast said after the game. "They made some defensive switches that we had trouble adjusting to, and fatigue set in on both sides at the end. It was one of the best games I've ever seen." 
Justice League's players agreed. 
"Both teams played their hearts out the whole game. The lead switched so many times, it was never a sure thing," Justice League forward Dan Leszkowicz said. "We thought we were going to be out here all week."
