Proud to be Irish 
Notre Dame students are used to seeing the incredible every day. 
My first home game was no exception. and for the rest of my life I will never forget what I saw this Saturday. 
Brian
I saw 100,000 devoted Irish DeSplinter fans pack this campus. 
Wzre Editor
I saw the living legends of this school cheer alongside mere freshmen like myself. 
I saw our team fight hard and fight well. But what impressed me the most was what I saw after the game. 
When the odds turned against the Irish in overtime and Michigan State charged our field, I saw a peculiar thing happen. 
Instead of filing quietly off the field as their fans hurried out of the stadium, the Fightin' Irish walked over to their student sec­tion to stand in union with their friends. 
State had no time to gloat, because their opponents already had their gold helmets in the air and were receiving a thunderous volley of applause from the student section. 
And though the Spartans had a large band and cheering section, the Irish were louder in defeat than State was in victory. 
I saw all of this, and I have never been more proud to be Irish. 
Not that I enjoyed losing. In fact, exactly the opposite; and this brings me to my point. 
During those few minutes after the game we showed that spirit that distinguishes us from every other student body. No one in that stadium left unimpressed, especial­ly the freshmen. 
So come next Saturday, it will be that same spirit that inspires us to cheer even harder for the Irish who play hard for us. 
I can only imagine how petrified Tyrone Willingham is of the Irish team he knows is ready for blood next week. Saturday was a tough beat, but it is only going to make us play harder and nastier each and every time out. 
This is an incredible time to be a freshman at Notre Dame, even for students who are used to seeing the incredible every day. 
I was told a thousand times before coming here that Notre Dame was a very different kind of place. 
On Saturday night, the freshman graduating class of 2009 got our first taste of exactly what that means. Now we know what it means to be NO. 
And when the Trojans come to town, we are going to make them know too.

Man breaks 'couch pota­to' world record for watching TV 
NEW YORK -Couch potato, thy name is Suresh. Suresh Joachim broke the Guinness world record for the longest time spent watching TV. He finished Friday with 69 hours and 48 minutes. 
After passing the previ­ous record of 50 hours and 7 minutes Thursday, Joachim continued until shortly after 7 a.m. Friday morning (EDT). 
Joachim did his TV viewing in the lobby of WABC-TV as part of the "Guinness World Record 
Breaker Week" on the syndicated "Live With Regis and Kelly." 
Sitting on a brown leather couch, he watched nothing but ABC shows. 
''I'm going to be a little tired of watching TV after this," Joachim told The Associated Press by phone during a brief break. 
Rules for the couch potato honor, as stipulat­ed by Guinness, allow for a 5-minute break every hour and a 15-minute break every 8 hours. The viewer must otherwise be constantly looking at the screen.

Transpo released a fleet of about 20 buses to run throughout the city during the game. The shuttle compa­ny began delivering busloads of fans to Library Circle three hours before kickoff and did not stop until 45 minutes before the Irish took the field. 
As Dave Holkien of Elkhart walked along Juniper Road after being dropped off by a bus at Library Circle, he rolled his eyes and pointed at the new Jordan Hall of Science.

Outbound traffic did not run as smoothly as the inbound pattern, Johnson said. 
"The outbound pattern was crowded," he said. "Michigan State is our largest drive-in game of the season ... and everyone left at the same time. Unfortunately that had some impact on the traffic."

City's health system facing crisis 
Associated Press 

NEW ORLEANS-This eity's health care faeilities have been shattered to an extent unmatched in U.S. history, and its hospital sys­tmn faces grave challnnges as resi­dents begin rnturning, the vice president of the national hospital accreditation organization said Sunday. 
The official, Joe Cappiello, said several hospitals were probably damaged beyond repair by Hurricane Katrina, while some may try to rush back into business before conditions are safe. Others, while rebuilding, may lose doctors and nurses to communities else­where. 
He also recounted harrowing details of how doctors and nurses felt compelled -against the fun­damnntals of their training -to make triage-style choiees during the flood. They Wfire forced to aid some patients at the expense of others with less ehance of survival. 
"Essentially the health care infrastructure of New Orleans is gone -it no longer exists," said Cappiello, who just completed a three-day mission to the city along with a colleague from the Illinois­based Joint Commission on Accreditation of I-Iealthcare Organizations. 
Although the city has more than a dozen hospitals, no11n have resumed normal opnralions. Officials at Childrnn's llospital. which Mayor Hay Nagin had IHilWd would be ready when residents are allownd to return to the Uptown neighborhood this week, said they may need 10 morn days to pre­pare. 
Nagin's plan is to start repopu­lating the city neighborhood by neighborhood, starting Monday with the Algiers seetion, across the Mississippi Hiver from downtown NHw Orleans. Over the next week and a half. the Garden District and the French Quarter, the city's his­toric heart, are due to open to res­idents and businesses.

ASMA founder l111am added to ND Forum 
Special to The Observer 

Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, founder and chief executive officer of the American Society for Muslim Advancement (ASMA) and 
imam of New York City's largest mosque, has been added as a panelist for the Notre Dame Forum Thursday. 


A previous-Imam ly announced panelist, Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, is unable to attend due to government obli­gations in Jordan. 
The inaugural Notre Dame Forum will begin at 2 p.m. in the Joyce Center arena and is the academic centerpiece of the inauguration of University President Father John Jenkins. 
Titled "Why God? Understanding Religion and Enacting Faith in a Plural World," the forum will feature three other world leaders in addition to Imam Feisal ­Cardinal Oscar Andres Hogrfguez Maradiaga, S.D.B., of Honduras; Naomi Chazan, professor of political science 
Israeli-Palestine peace process; and John C. Danforth, former U.S. senator and for­mer U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Retired NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw will serve as the mod­erator. 
Imam Feisalleads Masjid Al­Farah, a mosque in Manhattan. He has dedicated his life to building bridges between Muslims and the West and is a leader in the effort to build religious pluralism and integrate Islam into modern American society. He founded ASMA in 1997 as the first American organization com­mitted to bringing Muslims and non-Muslims together through programs in culture, art, aca­demia and current affairs. 
Imam Feisal has been a tire­less advocate for an ecumeni­cal solution to the Israeli­Palestinian conflict and is the architect of the Cordoba Initiative, an interreligious blueprint for improving rela­tions between America and the Muslim world and pursuing Middle East peace. 
Initiated by Jenkins, the Notre Dame Forum will be an annual event in which the University will bring world leaders to campus to share

also be deemed a success in

Jean Ann Linney, vice pres­ident and associate provost, has taken the task of coordi­nating the University's many initiatives for aiding the affected region. She is espe­cially involved in the University's efforts to accom­modate students who were displaced by the hurricane. 
"[Notre Dame has) offered 'visit­ing student status' to law school stu­dents and graduate stu­dents, and on a more limit­ed scale to undergradu­ate students who already had a pre­existing rela­tionship with t h e 
University," Linney said. 
But because of the school's residential structure and enrollment levels, Notre Dame has said it has no 
spare housing for undergraduates on campus. However, the University has been exploring the possibility of stu­dents staying in dorms at Saint Mary's.

tributions towards relief efforts will be dived among Catholic Charities USA (50 percent), Alliance for Catholic Education (25 per­cent) and Holy Cross Missions in the affected areas (25 percent). the University is currently exam­ining how to best establish effective involvement on a personal level. 
Many students and mem­bers of the Notre Dame fami­ly have expressed a desire to travel to the Gulf region to actively help in rehabilitation efforts. 
Bill Purcell -who with Director of the Center for Social Concern Father William Lies is spearheading relief efforts at the Center for Social Concerns -speaks daily with the social action director for the Archdiocese of New Orleans. Purcell said "there is no way students can be accepted as early as October break," as the resources to house volun­teers are currently nonexist­ent. However, the possibility

History tnajors discover nevv jobs 
Students find that degree does not limit them to a teaching career 
Associated Press 
MUNCIE, Ind. -Forget classrooms and chalkboards. Think historical re-enact­ments and rock 'n' roll cos­tumes. 
College students majoring in public history are discov­ering career options avail­able to them that few would 

associate with  a  traditional  
history degree.  
This summer,  Ball State  

University senior Alex Lindamen spent 15 w-eeks guiding international visitors through Alaska's Denali National Park, home of the country's highest mountain, Mount McKinley. 
His favorite part of the experience? Helping German visitors navigate trails by dog sled. 

"I loved the sled dog demonstrations, too," said Lindamen, 21, a public his­tory major. "For someone who's never been west of Chicago, it was quite an experience." 
The goal of a university's public history program is to acquaint history majors with jobs that are history-related but non-teaching. Examples include work in archives and records management, muse­ums and the interpretation of national parks and his­toric sites. 
Students enrolled in .public history programs at Ball State and Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis have taken many of the dep·artmental courses required of tradi­tional history majors. IUPUJ's program is graduate level; Ball State's is one of only a few undergraduate programs in the country. 
Public history majors also must take courses in public history, research methods and historiography, in which they learn to write about history. They must then complete a required intern­ship that can open the door to jobs in the field. 
The workload is intense and is one reason so few stu­dents enroll, said Michael Orleans to Baton Houge.

Elizabeth Brand Monroe has directed IUPUI's graduate program in public history for 11 years. 
About six years ago, the program doubled in size and now maintains about 30 active public history graduate students. 
The National Council on Public History, the nation's professional public history association, also is headquar­tered on the campus of IUPUI. 
While many public history majors land internships at museums and libraries close to home, some score the kind of dream gigs that often sound made up. 
Five years ago, orw of Doyle's students interned for the costume archive of Cleveland's Hoek and Hoek Hall of Fame. Othors have interned for documentary filmmakers or the foundations of notable figures such as Frank Lloyd Wright.

Doyle said he is proud of what Janovyak wa.c; able to accomplish while at Mount Vernon.

Train derailn1ent kills tvvo, injures n1ore than 80 in Chicago 
National Transportation Safety Board claims train was traveling 60 mph above the speed limit before the accident 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -A commuter train was going almost 60 mph above the speed limit just before it derailed, killing two people and injuring dozens, the acting chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said Sunday. 
Mark Hoscnker said the Metra train was traveling at 69 mph and should not h!lVC been going faster than 10 mph when it switched tracks at a erossover just before jumping the traeks Saturday. 
"Sixty-nine miles an hour is very, very fast when you're dealing with a 10-mile-an­hour restriction," Rosenker said. 
The speed information came from a preliminary reading of one of the train's three electronic data recorders, popularly known as "black boxes," Rosenker said. 
Part of the investigation included an interview Sunday with the train's engineer, Rosenker said. The 41-year­old man had been on the job for 45 days after completing Metra's six-month training program, which included at least some training along the route where the derailment occurred. He also had worked for more than five years as a CSX Corp. freight train engi­neer. 
The NTSB will also examine records of the train signals and radio transmissions from a control tower, Rosenker said. 
Investigators have deter­mined that nothing was abnormal with the tracks, which had just been inspect­ed on Friday, he said. 
The double-decked com­muter train was headed into Chicago from Joliet on Saturday morning with 185 passengers and four crew members when its locomotive and five rail cars jumped the tracks about 5 miles south of downtown. 
The train began to derail as it switched tracks, striking a steel bridge just beyond the crossover. Rosenker said that collision damaged at least one rail car and likely con­tributed to at least one of the fatalities. 
The train and the track had just been inspected Friday, said Judy Pardonnet, a spokeswoman for Metra, the commuter rail system that services the Chicago area. 
The train engineer, three crew members and dispatch­ers were all tested for drugs and alcohol, which is stan­dard procedure, Pardonnet said. 
The train's engineer is tak­ing three days of paid leave for "trauma debriefing." She said no decisions have been made about his future employment, although find­ings from the NTSB investiga­tion could determine whether he keeps his job. 
A similar derailment occurred on the same stretch of track in 2003, injuring about 45 people. A prelimi­nary NTSB report found that the train was going almost 70 mph at the location where it was supposed to switch from one track to the other. 
Pardonnet said the two 

derailments may have been just a coincidence. "I don't think it's anything specific to· this area, but it's still under investigation," she said. 
Jane Cuthbert, 22, of Bourbonnais, died on the train, Pardonnet said. A 30­year-old woman died at a hospital. 
They were the first people killed in a Metra derailment since it took over commuter rail services in the region in 1984. 
The injured passengers were taken to 15 hospitals and 15 of them remained hospitalized Sunday, Pardonnet said. She did not have information on their conditions. 
Train service on the Rock Island District Line resumed about four hours after the derailment, and the cleanup from the accident could cause short delays during Monday's commute, Pardonnet said.

Everybody done? Good. I'm assuming that most of you could successfully answer two, if not all three of those ques­tions. Now here's one more question: When has that information ever proved beneficial to you? That one is a little tougher to answer. 
Here at Notre Dame, we pride our­selves on the top-notch education avail­able to students. However, how much of that information is getting into our heads? They say that the human brain only uses 10 percent of its ability, but as far as I'm concerned, upwards of nine percent of that is taken up by useless trivia factoids. 
We've all been in this situation: You're sitting in Stepan Center with 250 of your closest friends, taking a big departmental exam in Calculus, Biology, Accounting, whatever. You've signed the Honor Code and filled out your Scantron, and now it's time to get to work on the exam that kept you up all night. As you work through the test

some of those questions are ones that you could have sworn you knew, but cannot remember no matter how hard you try. You recall seeing it in the text­book last night while piping Starbucks in via IV, but the information is nowhere to be found. However, while crammed in your little desk in the Stepan Center, you could rattle off all the Ben Folds Five albums in chrono­logical order or name who has won the Heisman Trophy the last 5 years. I highly doubt any of that information is required on the exam, unless you hap­pen to be taking "Piano Rock & College Football Stars 101," but I've heard that's impossible to DAHT into. 
These little tidbits of information that serve no applicable purpose latch onto chunks of your brain and never let go, whereas things like Organic Chemistry mechanisms or proper Accounting pro­cedures can't wait to leak out y.our ears. 
It's almost as if quotes from "The Simpsons" are brain bullies, taking up all the space for themselves and merci­lessly giving noogies and swirlies to Calculus derivatives until they can't take it anymore and flee right before your exam. 
However, trivia's stranglehold on our cerebellum doesn't end with things we should learn in the classroom, they also push out all sorts of useful life lessons. For example, I don't know how to change the oil in a car. I've been taught how to do it several times. But appar­ently my brain is the Bermuda Triangle of Useful Information, and as soon as I learn it, the information disappears never to be seen again. 
Conversely, I can state for you right now the top speed of the peregrine fal­con, the Earth's fastest creature. For those of you wondering, it's 120 miles

per hour. Now tlw question is: What sit­uation will come up first, needing to know how to change the oil, or some­one demanding the maximum speed of the Earth's fastest animal? Unless I'm kidnapped by a crazed ornithologist and I have to prove my worth lest he sic his trained squad of attack flamingos on me, my money's on needing to change the oil first. 
What can be done to light this trivial menaee? I believe that the most effec­tive way of ensuring that useful infor­mation stays in our heads would be to disguise it as trivia in the media. During Sportscenter, the "Did You Know?" sec­tion would be less about obscure bat­ting average anomalies, and.more along the lines of, "Did you know, pouring a Coke down a clogged drain is an effee­tive remedy, as the carbonic acid cats away at the clog? Booyah!" We'd watch shows on Vlll like "I Love Properly Filling Out Tax Rf~turns!" or shows on Comedy Central like "Chapelle Shows You How to Cook a Quiche." 
Of course, this oecurrence is highly unlikely. As such, we must be proactive in taking a stand against the mental monarchy of factoids. After serious eon­sideration, I believe I've put together a strategy that could work for everybody. You would just have to ... uh ... hold on ... Leonardo was blue and had a sword, Donatello was purple and had a bo staff, Michaelangelo was orange and had nunchaku and Raphael was red and had sais. Crap.

They wnrn an avenun in which the public could nxpress their opinion and voiee thnir concerns. Now the golden years of t.lw 1111wspaper industry are quickly evaporating. People -ospecially college students-see newspapers as techno­
logical dinosaurs in a digital age. Research by Leo W. Jeffries and David 
J. Atkin, both communication professors at Cleveland State University, indicates 89 percent or college students do not read the newspaper at all. 
As young adults, we hold the future in our hands. Ifwe continue ignoring the newspaper as a viable media outlet, what will become of it? What will beeome of us? 
Well, the first question is simple. 
The newspaper industry is a business -it needs money to function. If nobody reads newspapers, nobody will read the advertisements in them. Therefore, if advertisers pull out, newspapers will not have sul'ficient funding and cease to exist. 
What happens to readers' intellects is a much more complex question. 
In order to understand it, we must look at a world without newspapers. Where would we get our news? Television? 
Four months of experience as a news intern at a local television station taught 
. me that television news provides only a glimpse of reality. Thirty-second voice­overs and sound-bites cannot completely educate people about world, national, or even local events. Pretty -or gruesome -shots ("if it bleeds, it leads") do not provide in-depth coverage or important events. 
Plus, everyone's definition of television news varies. I'm sure many people in the world think they're keeping up with international affairs with their nightly dose of "Inside Edition." 
I feel if newspapers cannot survive, people will become ignorant about the 
world beeausn they will not be exposnd to in-depth coverage of outside informa­
tion. 

How do we prevent the world from such stupidity? 
Pick up copies of The Kansas City Star, The New York Times or the Wall Street Journal. Give your copy of this finn stu­dent newspaper to a friend when you're finished. Promote the written word on its endless sheets or recycled paper. 
Otherwise, your intelligonen could bo history as well.

Comeback cut short 
Irish erase 21-point deficit, but Spartans triumph on overtime option 

Jeff Samardzlja (83) and Maurice Stovall (21), above, elevated their games Saturday. Samardzija caught three touchdown passes, and Stovall had 176 yards receiving on a career, 487-yard day for Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn.

TIM SULLIVAN/The Observer Michigan State quarterback Drew Stanton, left, evades the grasp of Notre Dame linebacker Corey Mays. Stanton was only sacked once and his mobility caused problems for the Irish as he rushed for 28 yards and a score.

Never mind which team you were pulling for during Michigan State's 44-41 win over Notre Dame Saturday, 


the performance  Mike Gilloon  
by these two  
quarterbacks and their teams  Sports Editor  
was worthy of  
applause.  

Don't worry about Michigan State coming in and spoiling the Irish vic­tory party for a record fifth consecu­tive time. Don't focus on Jason Teague's 19-yard scamper that offi­cially ended the marathon game. 
The ushers should have charged extra money from fans as they shuf­fled out of the Stadium. Whatever they paid for their ticket, it wasn't enough to deserve this type of enter­tainment. 
This was a game during which you couldn't use the bathroom without hearing another record shatter on the torn-up turf of Notre Dame Stadium. 
It was a spectacular offensive dis­play, with enough yards collected to fill the Goodyear blimp hovering overhead. 
For Notre Dame, this was much more than another frustrating loss to a rival. In recent years, the Irish deserved their defeats to Michigan, Purdue, Michigan State, etc. When they got down, they had no chance of coming back. 
But Saturday was different. The Irish bared their teeth, showed a lit­tle fight and scraped together a comeback created for Saturday afternoons in the fall. 
The game, as cliche as it may sound, could have gone either way. Neither team deserved to win, but neither deserved to lose. 
Notre Dame, however, is disap­pointed in its loss. Twelve penalties for 92 yards-almost as much as the Irish rushing total -take some of the optimism out of the team's performance. Not many people were surprised at Weis' ability to immedi­ately upgrade the Irish offensive production so soon. But the lack

him. 

Michigan State had its own issues. At times, Quinn made the Spartan secondary look as soft as cheese­cake. If the defense can somehow become even half as good as the offense, the Spartans will be the sur­prise of the Big Ten. 
But save the criticism and finger­pointing for the film session. Appreciate one of the best college football games that will be played all season. Remember the players who stole the show. 
Exhibit A: Drew Stanton. 
Stanton is a taller Doug Flutie ­mobile, accurately-armed and blessed with a knack for winning. The Spartans could have cleared their dishes and left the table after the Irish rallied back from a three­touchdown deficit. In the fourth quarter, as well as Quinn and the Notre Dame offense performed, it seemed all but certain the Irish would scrape together the win. 
But here came Stanton, scram­bling to the Spartans' rescue. He calmly handled the final few snaps with his team's back to the wall to run out the clock on regulation. 
After the Irish field goal in over­time, Stanton smelled victory. His pitch to Jason Teague, right under the eye of the Notre Dame student body, was the final slug in a game of punches. 
But which team threw that final punch seems unimportant. There will be a Jumbotron in 
record, Quinn 
finally has some­

thing at Notre Dame that's all his. 
At a position of names ­Montana, Theismann, Iluarte, Bertelli, Clements, Lujack, Mirer, Rice -Quinn now stands out. He lacks a Ileisman Trophy and a national title, but at the very least his performance Saturday gives him his own little place in Irish history. 
It was just another bronze per­formance in a game the 80,795 fans in attendance were lucky to witness. 
Just hope you saved your ticket stub.

Quinn, however, was not li1cusnd on his individual accom­plishnwnt'i. 
"Tiw final statistics may ... look good on paper," he said, "but especially the way we play11d in tho first hall', it was rnally not what WP wanted mm­ing into this gamo." 
llis 487 passing yards were thn most by anyone in the histo­ry of Notre Dame Stadium, and his 60 pass attmnpts and :n completions were individual c:arner highs. 
Notre Dame receiver Jeff Smnardzija eaught thren touch­down passes Saturday, tying a sehool remrd. 
lie is the first to accomplish the leat sinee Tom Gatnwood in 1970. It was also the lirst time sincn 1998 that an Irish receiver caught touchdowns in three consecutive games. 
Penalties punishing 

The Irish eornmittnd 12 penal­ties for 92 yards in the game, all during rngulation. llnad coach Charlie Weis addressed the penalties with visible frustration. 
"Wfl had too many mistakes oll'ensively, defensively, special teams -all across thP board," Weissaid. 
"And I'm never going to be eontnnt with a comeback when you end up losing ... You can't just accept being in a game that's dose and end up losing it. It's just not okay." 
1,000 yard man 

Darius Walker broke 1,000 yards for his career in regular­season play and set an individ­ual earner high in single-game rushing yards with 116. lie has rushed for 100 yards in each game this season. 
I lis prnvious high was in last year's home opener against Michigan, when he rushed for 115 yards on 31 carries. 
Fasano nabs 60th 
Anthony Fasano passed Mark Bavaro and Tony Hunter for limrth plaee on the school's all­time receptions list for tight ends. His seven eatehes against Michigan State Ul'ted his career total to 60, five more than Bavaro and Hunter and two fewer than Derek Brown and Dean Masztak. 
Big boot 
Irish kicker ILl. Fitzpatrick connected on field goals of' 48 and 44 yards. The 48-yard kick was the second longest field goal of' his career and the longest since hitting from 50 yards at Syracuse in 2003. 
One home game, one loss 
Weis and Lou Holtz are the only eoaehes sinee World War II to lose their first home game as head coach for Notre Dame. 
Weis said in his post game comments that he was not dis­tracted about the long-term ramifieations of the contest prior to playing. 
"When I walked out [of the tunnel! to get ready for that game, the only thing I was wor­rying about was that game," Weis said. "I would have liked to have been able to walk off the field victorious, but we didn't. And I'm part of' the reason we didn't." 
Thriving on fourth down 
Notre Dame converted three offour fourth downs, including a 4th-and-15 from the Michigan State 37-yard line. Quinn hit Maurice Stovall for a 17-yard gain on the play. The only failed limrth down was a carry for no gain by freshman fullback Asaph Schwapp on 4th-and-1 with seven minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. 
Weis said the failed conversion was the result of' a mi<>communi­cation. 
"We had a mental error on the play which I'll take responsi­bility for," he said. "If you would have seen what I saw. you would have thought it would it was going to be a touchdown before the ball was snapped. But it's my fault because I didn't get it communicated." 
Captains 

The Irish captains for the game were Quinn on oll'ense, Brandon Boyte on defense and Tom Zbikowski on special teams.

Mkhigan State put Notre Dame away in overtime, and the Spartans 
managed to win in Notre Dame Stadium for the fil'th straight time. Brady Quinn's school-record five touchdown passes were almost enough to lead the Irish back from a 21-point deficit. But, without a consistent rushing game, Notre Dame could not control the contest. Ninety-two yards of penalties and Spartans quarterback Drew Stanton prevented the 
comeback attempt in Charlie Weis' first horne game as head coach. D.J. Fitzpatrick's field goal wasn't enough in overtime as Michigan State running back Ja<>on Teague took the option pitch and ran down the right sideline and into the end zone to spoil the day for Notre Dame .

FTT department stages first reunion 
Alumni share experiences in entertainment industry 


Students gather Friday to watch an event In the Browning Cinema. The activities were a chance for alumni to reconnect with other grads and for current students to make contacts. 
Bill Carter, author of "The Late Shift," a book about late-night talk shows, speaks at an FTT reunion panel Thursday. 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
A"i't:nlt Scene Editor 
Notrn Danw alumni who work in the tntprtainmnnt industry had a homecom­ing this wnnknnd, returning from llollywood and otlwr world media cen­tl'rs to 1~ampus for tlw Film, Tolnvision and Theat.m Alumni Hmmion. 
Tlu~ nvnnt was organiznd largPiy by Ted MandPII, a professor in the FTT dnpartnwn t. Thn dneision to host tho rmmion this ynar was basnd on timing and thP ovPrwlwlming int.nrnst of past graduatl's, lw said. 
"Thorn arn so many pnopln in the industry from Not.rn Damn, but they rwvnr eonw togntlwr," Mandnll said. "Hnunions are usually based on what yl'ar you graduatnd." 
Among tlw tWPnts hosted during the Wtwknnd was the Alumni Film Fnst, whirh f'eaturt\d fivn short films ernatcd hy Notrn Damn graduates, and a screen­ing of "Tlw Late Shift," a film by 1971 alumnus Bill Cartor, who is now thn tel­twision writer for Thn New York Times. 
Thn Alumni Hmmion was not just held for thn rnturning graduatns but also for students, who got a ehanee to meet and talk to thn men and women in the busi­nnss. It allowed students an opportunity to lnarn firsthand the manner in which tlw industry opnrates. 
Mandell was espocially impressed wil.h thn enthusiasm of the returning graduatos. 
"In the entnrtainment industry, it's all about eomwctions," Mandell said. "The alums havn rnally reached out to the studnnts with that, networking and get­ting to know eaeh other." 
Thn dnpartmnnt hosted a series of tlwmed pannls and workshops on Friday. These pannls and workshops touehnd on a wide variety of topics, including Urn development of program­ming in thn industry, nthies in broadcast journalism, writing, prod udng and edit­ing. Tlwatnr workshops inducted panels about acting, producing and the sodetal roln of theater. 
Perhaps most surprising was the low numlw.r of alums who were majors in FTT while nnroliNI at the University. lnstnad. they camn from a wide variety of disciplirws, including business and J·:nglish. 
The Fil111, Television and Theatre 
major has not always been in existence in its current form, but the Alumni Heunion aptly demonstrated that back­ground and major do not dictate success in the entertainment industry, as many of the alums combined the skills learned at Notre Dame in their careers. 
"If' you can think, talk and write, then there's a job for you," said John Walker, a 1978 graduate from the English dnpartment. 
Walker began a career in theater before switching to film and is currently a producer for Pixar, where he pro­duced "The Incredibles." He stressed thn importance of the arts and was nspeeially impressed with the school's d!~dication to film, television and the­ater. 
"Notre Dame has certainly demon­strated its support of the arts," he said. "It's always been a big commitment here, but they didn't have the where­withal that they do now." 
The alumni all came from a wide vari­ety of careers and backgrounds. Many of them work right in the hnart of the industry, such as Nate Haekiewicz, a 1998 graduate from the Mendoza College of Businnss. Hackiewicz is now a Manager in Technology for IIBO and works with the Sales Marketing Group and the Finance Group there. 
There were also many alumni present who work in fields that are not directly involved in f'ilm, television or theater but still utilize the skills learned in the department. Jeffrey Spoonhower, a 1999 graduate, worked for EA Sports doing video game character animation before moving to Volition Studios. 
"Film is what I was really interested in," Spoonhower said. 
lie now animates cut-scenes for video games, which allows him to explore more einematic territory. 
"It's like writing and directing your own mini-movie," he said. 
One major difference for returning alumni is the Debartolo Center for the Performing Arts, which opened formally last fall. The advent of the DPAC was one of the inspirations for the reunion, said Mandell, who noted that it gave the department the space and resources to host such a large-scale gathnring. 
The alumni wern uniformly impressed with the building, and all agreed it would help emphasize Notre Dame's support of thn. arts. Beforn thn !>PAC opened, th!~ FTT department had no for­mal housing and was thus scattered throughout the campus. 
Classes were held in DeBartolo or O'Shaughnes·sny, profnssors' ol'f'icns were in Deeio, and St~rt~enings wen~ hosted at the Jlnsburgh I.ibrary. Nearly all FTT classes, scrnenings and oflkns are now in the I>PAC, which provides a singln location for thn departnwnt. 
"This building is inerndible,"Hackiewiez said. "lt. should rnally enhance thn FTT dnpartment here at Notrn Damn." 
Chris Vierig, a junior FTT major, agreed. 
"I think lthn DPACI brings, not only some uniqueness to tho FTT major, hut also cnntrality and unity," hn said. "We're all in one pl1u:o now, as opposnd to being spread around." 
Tho FTT Alumni Hnunion was deonwd a grnat succnss by many involvnd. It reachnd across gmwrations and disei­plinns and brought all togothnr undnr onn roof. 
"It's just been incredible," Mandtdt· said. "You'll never have the opportunity to havn so many peopln working in tho industry at one place at onn time. It may be a once in a lifetime opportunity." 
The entertainment industry is one of the most notoriously dif'licult fields to succeed in, but the alumni reunion demonstrated that perseverance and hard work pay ofl'. 
Anne Maxfield, a 1979 graduate from the English department, recounted her diflicult road to success. She worked f'or minimum wage at several different radio stations, worknd in retail and was fired twice before finally getting her own sports radio show at WSCH in Chicago. 
When asked if shn had any advice for aspiring FTT majors _ or anyone inter­ested in working in the entertainment industry -she had appropriate words for the Notre Dame undergraduate body. 
"Keep the faith," shn said. 
Through their tales of' hard work, fail­ure and success, the FTT alumni demonstrated thn wide variety of' possi­bilities open to graduatns in the entnr­tainmnnt industry. The reunion also gave them an opportunity to cnlnbratn thn achiovements of' graduat1~s from thn department's past.

Wandy Rodriguez keeps Astros hot against Brewers 
Bonds hits homer No. 705 in Giants' win; Glavine beats Atlanta 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON -Astros manager Phil Garner has his own magic number, and Houston moved toward it Sunday. 
Wandy Hodriguez pitched a career-high 7 1/3 innings, and Lance Berkman put Houston ahead to stay with a two-run, first-inning double in a 6-1 vic­tory over the Milwaukee Brewers that extended the Astros' winning streak to five. 
Houston, which had just six hits, began the day with a half­game lead over Philadelphia in the NL wild-card race. The Phillies played Sunday night at the Florida Marlins, who start­ed Sunday 2 1/2 games back of the Astros (81-68). 
"This was a big win for us," Garner said. "But our goal is to get 15 games over .500 and then assess where we are." 
Garner wouldn't say what was magical about 15 games over. 
"I just feel if we go to 15 over we'll be in pretty good posi­tion," Garner said. "We're play­ing confidently now. At least we're pitching confidently. I don't know if we're hitting as confidently as I'd like." 
Houston started Sunday sec­ond in the league in pitching with a team ERA of 3.52 but was next to last in team batting at .256. 
"We knew our pitching staff was the backbone of the team," catcher Brad Ausmus said. "The question mark is our hit­ting. It isn't over yet. We've still got two weeks to go, and the offense has to come around. We're day to day with our offense." 

The pitching has been espe­cially good the last six games allowing nine runs. 
"Wandy did a super job today and that was huge for us," Garner said. "Our pitching has done a marvelous job the last six games. You have to feel good any time they pitch, but I'd like to see our offense come around a little. The guys are grinding and by me saying this, it'll probably put more pressure on them." 
Giants 5, Dodgers 3 
Barry Bonds carefully marked almost every piece of his equip­ment with No. 705 and the date, boxed it up and sealed the top with athletic tape. 
Ilis bat and hat, his gloves, his shoes, even his black-and­orange wristbands -all of it got authenticated and put away for safekeeping in one of the slugger's many storage units. 
Bonds splashed a home run into McCovey Cove for the first time this season on Sunday. His 705th career homer led off the eighth inning, causing a com­motion as soon as it reached the water and kayakers raced to retrieve the ball. 
Bonds' homer followed a tiebreaking solo drive by Mike Matheny in the sixth and Randy Wino's third homer in as many days, leading the San Francisco 
CLASSIFIEDS 

Giants past the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
Matheny's homer off Franquelis Osoria (0-1) helped the Giants win their third straight after losing the opener and take the season series from Los Angelos 10-9. San Francisco trails the first-place Padres by 5 1/2 games in the NL West, and the Dodgers dropped 7 1/2 games back. 
. "It's nice to win," Bonds said. "I still feel like I'm in the spring training mode. Sometimes I feel really good. Sometimes I feel off balance. Those are things you go through in spring training. I'm trying to put it together in such a short window of time." 
Mets 4, Braves 1 
Tom Glavine really wanted to finish his start -and not because of who he was facing. 
Glavine pitched a six-hitter to beat his former team and Cliff Floyd hit his career-high 32nd homer, leading the New York Mets over the Atlanta Braves Sunday. 
Glavine (11-13) got Jeff Francoeur to bounce back to the mound to finish his 54th career complete game and his first since a 4-0 victory over Colorado on May 23, 2004. He was pleased with being able to go the distance in his 273rd career win. 
"Not because of my personal relationship with them, but Cubs 7, Cardinals 4 York Mets Aug. 7. He left that because they're a good team," Carlos Zambrano won his sixth game after three innings because Glavine said.

Chavez homered twice and Oakland's first live battnrs got hits as the Athletics broke out ol' their slump with a win over thn Boston Hod Sox on Sunday.

The Nnw York Yankees lost their starting pitcher in the third inning and a chancn to makn up ground in the stand­ings. 
Jarnt Wright left after being hit on tho right elbow by a bro­ken bat, and the Toronto Blue Jays ended New York's six­gamn winning streak with a vie­tory Sunday. 
Wright isn't sure if he'll be able to make his next scheduled start, which would be next weekend at home against Toronto. 
"It's sore and tight. It's kind of throbbing," he said. "It hit right on the bone on the back of the elbow." 
Alex Hodriguez hit his AL­Ieading 44th home run and Derek Jeter also connected for the Yankees, who fell 1 1/2 games behind Cleveland in thn wild-eard race but rernainnd 1 1/2 back of lirst-placn Boston in the AL East. 

White Sox 2, Twins 1 
Pitching is what put thn Chieago White Sox in first placn, and Joso Contreras is trying his best to keep them there. 
Contreras gave the struggling Whitn Sox eight strong innings in a victory over the Minnesota Twins on Sunday, helping Chicago maintain a 3 1/2-gamn lead in the AL Central )wading into a critical series with sec­ond-place Cleveland. 
"This kid, the last two wonks, every time we need it he goes out and does a tremendous job," manager Ozzie Guillen said, latnr declaring Contreras his bnst current starter in a rotation that ineludes Jon Garland and Mark Buehrle. 
The White Sox scored four runs in this three-game series at the Metrodome and somehow won twice, raising their record in one-run games this year to 32-17. The Twins are 27-29 in one-run decisions. 
"We know we have 11 guys on our staff that can go out and make outs," catcher A.J. Pierzynski said. "They continue to keep us in games, and we continue to score enough runs to find a way to win." 
Rangers 8, Mariners 6 
Coors Field has some compe­tition. 
Mark Teixeira homered twice and three teammates also con­nected as the Texas Rangers set a major league record for home runs at home, beating the Seattle Mariners Sunday to fin­ish a four-game sweep. 

Rod Barajas' drive in the fourth inning gave the Hangers 150 homers at Ameriquest Field this season, breaking the mark of 149 set by the 1996 Colorado Rockies at Coors Field -long considered the best ballpark in the majors for hitters. 
Texas' 12-year-old stadium isn't too shabby, either. 
"In this park, you get the ball up and they'll make you pay for it," Mariners manager Mike Hargrove said. "The Rangers take advantage of this park and when you add that we didn't pitch well, this is what hap­pens." 
Teixeira broke a tin with a three-run shot and pushed his season total to 41 homers. David Dellueei and Alfonso Soriano also homernd on a windy afternoon ror the Hangers, who have won live in a row to reaeh .500 (75-75) l"or the first time since Aug. lJ. 
Teixeira joined Juan Gonzalez, Hafanl Palrneiro and Alex Hodriguez as the only Texas players with at lnast 40 homers in a season. 
"Those are three gmat play­ers," said Teixeira, who had four HBis to incrnase his total to 132, tied for the AL lead with Boston's David Ortiz. "You ean feel good about your accom­plishment when you're men­tioned with thosn players. Hitting 40 homers is a great number that not many people get to." 
The switch-hitting Teixeira added a solo homer in the sev­enth while batting right-handnd against George ~herrill to extend Texas' lead to H-6. lin had his seventh rnultihonwr game this season and the I I t.h or his carnnr.

PGA 


Associated Press 

FARMINGTON, Pa. ­Jason Gore stood up to an excellent late-season field, and to the very pressure that wilted him three months ago at the 
U.S. Open. Most of all, he stood up to Sunday. 
Gore, whose last-day unraveling already is part of Open lore, held off the 84 Lumber Classic field with big drives and steely nerves to win on the PGA Tour barely a month after being_ stuck in golf's minor leagues. 
Gore's four-stroke lead with five holes to play was down to one over runner-up Carlos Franco by No. 18, but Gore land­ed his approach shot on the 468-yard par-4 on the lower fringe of the green. With a playoff looming if he didn't get up and down, Gore deftly lagged his putt from 91 1/2 feet to within 22 inches and tapped in for a final­round 2-under 70 and the Tour victory he once thought might never come. 
"I hit the best putt of my life," he said. "What made it easier is the putt was so hard -I had to go up and down two ele­phants and over the windmill. It worked out, 
IN BRIEF 

Former baseball MVP Donn Clendenon dies of Leukemia 
SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -Donn Clendenon, the power-hitting first baseman who was the most valu­able player in the New York Mets' 1969 World Series victory, died Saturday after a long fight with leukemia. He was 70. 
A spokesman from the George Boom Funeral Home confirmed the death.  
Clendenon hit three home runs and had four RBis in the Mets' five­game victory over the Baltimore Orioles. He hit .274 with 159 home runs and 682 RBis in 12 seasons in the major leagues with Pittsburgh, Montreal, the Mets and St. Louis. 
Clendenon spent his first eight seasons in the majors with Pittsburgh, began the 1969 season with Montreal and joined the Mets in a midseason deal. 
In the 1969 World Series, the Orioles were ahead 3-0 in Game 5 when Mets manager Gil Hodges luckily." 
His 14-under 274 was 
three shots better than 
third-place finisher Ben 
Crane (67). 

"It's pretty incredible," said Gore, who played with a sponsor's exemp­tion. "Around May-ish I was wondering if I could get formula for my child, if I was going to make a house payment, and now look. They just handed me a check for $792,000. It's amazing where a little perseverance and grit and maybe a little igno­
rance can take you." 
Gore never finished 
higher than 18th during 
two previous stays on the 
PGA Tour, in 2001 and 2003, and had won only $40,399 on that tour this year. Now, he joins Paul Stankowski (1996) as the only winners on the developmental Nationwide and PGA tours in the same year. 
The portly, big-swinging Gore is the first to do so after earning the auto­matic in-season promo­tion that goes to any three-time Nationwide winner. 
Now, all those public course duffers who think they could make the leap to golf's big leagues have a new hero to go with John Daly.

Rhodes recovers from stroke 
SEATTLE -Team physicians said Sunday that Seattle Seahawks defen­sive coordinator Ray Rhodes had suf­fered a mild stroke after he was hos­pitalized with dizziness earlier this month. 
"He's recovering well and appears not to have any type of deficits after the stroke," team physician Brad Shoup said in a statement. 
Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren said Rhodes, 54, should resume full-time coaching this week. He was hospitalized Sept. 4. 
Rhodes did not accompany the team to Jacksonville last week. He was in the coaches booth on Sunday as a consultant, but linebackers coach John Marshall handled the play calling. 
He was presented with a game ball

FRISCO, Texas -Roberto Mina scored twice, helping FC Dallas clinch a playoff berth with a 2-1 win over Real Salt Lake on Sunday. 
FC Dallas (11-9-6) also snapped a 10-game winless streak and won for the first time at Pizza Hut Park. 

Mina's second goal in the 52nd minute turned out to be the deciding goal, handing Real Salt Lake (5-17­
4) its sixth straight loss. 
Ramon Nunez started the sequence when he dribbled around Real Salt Lake defenders and passed to Bobby Rhine. Rhine tapped a pass from the front of the Real Salt Lake net to Mina, who fired a shot from the top of the goalie box for his fifth goal of the season and a 2-0 FC Dallas lead. 
Real Salt Lake responded minutes later when Jamie Watson headed the ball into the FC Dallas net from about 5 yards away.

Irish fare vvell in vveekend regatta 
Team is happy with performance in race early in the season 
By TOM DORWART

Sunday. tlw rownrs gaugnd t.hPir progress. 
And tlw assessnwnt is'? 
Tluy'vp madP gnat strides this fall. 
Whiln tlw Irish have only pradie1~d for about two wonks, thny managed to linish the S1:athaeh boat fourth out of 11 crews in IIIli' race at the wnnk<'nd regatta. 
They raced three boats in thrnn diiTnrnnt raens. Eastnrn Mkhigan. Michigan and Michigan State naeh had boats participate. Stroke limits worn 25 pnr minute, while each raen lasted 3.000 mntnrs. 
Usually Notre Dame takes its top rowers and puts them in the A boat. The rest of the crew is separated by ability and cooperation. But this weekend, coach Martin Stone chose tho boats and the row­ers randomly. The three boats worn the Joyce, the llesburgh and the Scathach. 
Th n Scath ach l'i nislwd in I 0:01. In that piece, tho crew included Shannan Lettieri, Melissa Felker, Alyss1i Close, Lindsay McQuaid, Betsy Madison. Laura Pearson, Andr·ca Doud, Erica Castro­Larson and Shannon Cassell. The. Joyce crew finished eighth in 10:08, while the Ilnsburgh crew came in 1Oth in 10:11. 
In the second piece, the Scathach remained consistent. It finished fifth in 9:42 with Eileen Froehlkn, Felker, Close, McQuaid, Madison, Pearson, Doud, Erica Castro-Larson and Kate Sylvia aboard. The Joyce took seventh, and the Hesburgh finished eighth. 
Though the rowers were pleased with their start to the day, they finished even stronger. 
The Scathach stormed in at third in 10:03. The Joyce also Jinished third in its piece, and tho I lesburgh fell to ninth. 
For tho first regatta, the Irish rowed well. They now know what they must do this fall to condition themselves for an NCAA run in the spring. 
"l was very pleased with how we rowed today," Stone said. "We've only been prac­ticing for two weeks, and we used this eomp.etition to sen where we are at this early in the season. 
"Today showed us what we need to do to get better."

Trojans stay No. 1 in both polls 
Associated Press 
Southern California's run at No. 1 in Tho Assodatod Press Top 25 roached a roeord­hreaking level and Oklahoma, the toam USC rnplaced in the top spot almost two years ago, was unranked for the first time sinen 1999. 
Wilh the Trojans top-ranked in t.hn AP media poll released Sunday, USC has now bonn No.

USC received 57 of 65 lirst­plaee votes. No. 2 Texas received the other eight first­place votes. LSU is No. 3 fol­lowed by Virginia Tech and Florida, rounding out the top live. 
Tho Trojans took over the top spot Dee. 7, 2003, after then-No. 1 Oklahoma lost the Big 12 title game to Kansas State. 
USC won the Hose Bowl to finish the season No. 1 in the AP poll, then began last season in the same spot.

Belles blank Albion in conference match 
Freshman Hinton tallies two goals in consecutive games 
By KYLE CASSJLY 
Sports Writer 
The Saint. Mary's soccer tnam continued to roll this weekend with its second-straight MIA/\ win in a 3-1 victory at Alma College on Saturday. 
The Belles used the momen­tum they had gained earlier in the week during a 2-0 win over Albion College to move to 2-1 in MIAA play and 3-3 overall. 
For the second straight game, freshman Lauren I linton made a giant impaet, tallying two goals in each game. I linton hns been an ofl'ensive powerhouse so far this season, scoring four out of' the Belles' nine goals on the sea­son and consistnntly pressuring the opponent's defense with an exhausting attack. 
"She's a pure striker; she's got a nose for the goal," senior leader Carrie Orr said of Hinton. "If she gets a breakaway one-on­one with the defender or just the keeper, she's going to put it away. It's good to have someone dependable lat attacker]." 
The Belles' Carolyn Logan pro­vided the eventual game-win­ning goal with little time left in the first half. In a 1-1 tie, Logan scored the Belles' second goal with under a minute to play. The Scots could not garner any offense after Logan's winning drive, sealing the deal for the Belles. 
!linton got tlw Belles on the board first af'tnr ripping a shot into the not in tho :nrd minutn of play. Th<~ Belles forward sprinted on a fast break and boat Alma goaltender Pam McCarthy. tlw MIA/\ dnfensivn player of tho week, with a well­placed shot. 
·Then in the 7Xth minute. !linton struck again and sealed thP deal with lwr se<~ond of tlw game and the Belles' third. 'flw insurance goal sent the Bolles homn with anot.hM key MIA/\ win over a challenging opponnnt. 
"Kind of like against Albion, we took control of the game," Orr said. "We know what we had to do. We outmatched Alma in nvery way." 
After a tough stretrh early in thn season on whkh tho Belles strugglnd to put away goals. they are now lighting up the show behind a rejuvenated midfield and attack. I linton is not the only freshman who has been a vital part of the Saint Mary's attack, as Whitney Fron has playnd con­sistently well with a game-win­ning double overtime goal in the first game of the season. Hinton's sister Ac;;hlny has been a force at midfield after kitking otr several goal-produdng drives. 
"We put goals in the baek of the net, which is something wn have really needed to do," Orr said, regarding her team's new­found offensive confidence. "Overall, we played really well." 
The Belles will play at 4 p.m. on Tuesday at home against. Olivet College.

the Irish were going to need to lay up tee shots, and hit lower irons for their second shots. 
"You were constantly laying back to a distance where you didn't have to deal with that narrow part of the fairway," senior Mark Baldwin said. "It was more about who was play­ing the most intelligent off of the tee, and I think the teams that decided to play aggressive­ly were actually penalized for that significantly." 
The Irish also had a little dif­ficulty with the greens, as the green speed proved to be a challenge all weekend. 
"Around the greens, they were different than the greens we're used to because they are really fast," Baldwin said. "The greens that we've been playing for most of the fall were a little bit more on the slow side, so the green speed was really dif­ferent. Its quite an adjustment to have to make." 
Despite the No. 5 finish, the Irish were not happy with their performance as the team felt it could have done much more in the tournament. 
"I think coach was pretty dis­appointed," Baldwin said. "We are a really talented team and we had great expectations com­ing into the tournament. We're taking this as a poor tourna­ment actually, a poor fmish for us. because we thought we could have come in here and won." 
Minnesota and Washington tied for first, shooting 883 ­301-284-298 for Minnesota and 


DUSTIN MANNELLA/The Observer Cole lsban hits a tee shot last Sept. 19. lsban had a tough first round, shooting an 80 Saturday, which hurt Irish chances. 
302-294-287 for Washington ­but Minnesota won the tourna­ment on a tie breaker, as their fifth golfer posted a better round than Washington's. 
The Huskies' fifth golfer was disqualified after the second round when he did not sign his scorecard after completing Saturday's round. 
Georgia State and Purdue tied for third with scores of 890. 
Senior Scott Gustafson led the way for the Irish, firing a 218 (7 3-7 3-72) over the three-day tournament, a score that was good for a No. 6 individual fin­ish. 
Mark Baldwin was also in the top 10, fmishing No. 10 overall, shooting a 219 (76-72-71). 
With Gustafson and Baldwin finishing in the top 10, it was the first time the Irish had done that since the 2004 Rice Invitational when Cole lsban and Tommy Balderston accom­plished that same feat. 
lsban finished tied for No. 22, shooting a 224 after a first­round 80. He responded by shooting even par in his next two rounds combined (80-74­70). 
The 70 Isban shot on Saturday was the best individ­ual round by an Irish player all weekend, but the with a more consistent round on Friday, the Irish would have been right in the thick of things. 
"[lsban] had a very uncharac­teristic round," Baldwin said. 
Eric Deutsch and Mike King finished tied for No. 42 and No. 58 respectively, firing a 233 and a 242. 
Despite the disappointing tournament, Baldwin felt that the team's feeling might speak to what it is capable of accom­plishing. 
"If this is as poor of an event as you can have, if you feel like you've played poorly, what does that say that's gonna happen when you play well," Baldwin said. "What kind of results will you be getting when you live up to those expectations? I feel like this is just gonna lead us to bigger and better things."

but his shot sailed left of the goal. 
Notre Dame finally got on the board with 7:30 left in the game when St. John's scored on its own goal. Irish striker Joe Lapira fired a pass across the box, but St. John's defender Sam Matthews inadvertently headed the ball in to make the score 2-1. 
The Irish were unable to even the score in the final seven min­utes, however. St. John's con­trolled the play all game. 
"To be honest, I thought we didn't find our game at all," Notre Dame head coach Bobby Cl(!,rk said. "It was a very difficult night for us." 
Clark thought that a lot of his team's struggles came from St. John's' tremendous home field advantage. The Red Storm have a large fan base and a unique stadium that makes it difficult for opposing teams. 
St. John's has only lost six games at home in the last 10 years. 
"They're a very good team to take nothing away from them, but they know how to play the tough field very well," Clark said. "It was a tough environment and, to be fair, we didn\ get a hold of it." 
The Irish regretted their per­formance Friday because they knew they missed out an oppor­tunity for a marquee win over the lOth-ranked Red Storm. 
"Obviously you are disappoint­ed because we thought maybe we could've done something, but we didn't," Clark said. 
Clark was thrilled, though. with the way the Irish responded Sunday against Syracuse. The Orange entered the game with an undefeated 4-0-1 record, but Notre Dame took control from the start of the game. 
"They were coming out a very confident team, but we just took over the game," Clark said. "We controlled the game pretty well start to finish." 
Junior forward Justin McGeeney tallied the game's only goal in the 52nd minute off of an assist from Stephens. McGeeney totaled five shots in the game. Midfielder Ian Etherington added five shots of his own, while for­ward Tony Megna barely missed a goal early in the game when his header sailed over the cross­bar. 
Syracuse made the game inter­esting late. The Orange added a third forward and threatened to score on several occasions late in the game, but could not find the back of the net. 
The Irish defense put forth another superb effort against Syracuse. Coming into the year, defense was the major question mark surrounding the team. Cahill and the backs have proved up to task, however. Cahill recorded his third shutout in the last four games Sunday. 
Clark was proud of how well the Irish played Sunday after Friday's setback. 
"Although we only scored one goal, I felt we possibly put in our best performance of the year so far," Clark said. "Today is the happiest I've felt with the way people are starting to fmd their role. 
"We are starting to get a good feeling about what the team is going to look like."

Big Ben's left knee is doing fine. So are all the winning streaks tied to him and the Pittsburgh Steelers heading into

Pittsburgh (2-0) won its 16th straight regular-season game, matching the Miami teams of 1971-73 and 1983-84 for the second best run in league histo­ry. The record is 18, set by the Patriots and ended by the Steelers when they met last October in Pittsburgh. 
New England got revenge by winning at lleinz Field in January to get to the Super Bowl. Now the Steelers am the ones talking about payback with the two-time Super Bowl -champs returning to Pittsburgh on Sunday. 
"f think that will be on a lot of people's minds this week." said running back Willie Parker, who cemented his hold on the start­ing job with 111 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries. 
"We try to takn it one game at a time, but the New England game is not really the same," added safety Troy Polamalu, who had throe of Pittsburgh's eight sacks. 
While the Patriots took some of' the luster oil' the rnrnatch by los­ing at Carolina. the Stnelers k(~pt up their end with Honthlisborgor improving to 15-0 as a startor and Pittsburgh winning an eighth straight road game, one shy of the team rneord sPl in 1974-75.

Stewart, who started from the pole, dominated through much of the race, leading 173 of the 300 laps at New Hampshire International Speedway. But Newman won a late battle with Stewart, passing him on lap 299 and holding the top spot by two car-lengths. 
Both men are Indiana natives, Newman from South Bend, Stewart from Columbus. 
"Tony wasn't happy with the balance of his car at the end," said Newman. who led 66 laps. "llis car was going away at the right time for me. It was going away faster than mine. But that's the best racing I've seen at this track." 
Following the !1naf pit stops by the leade'rs, Newman found himself just ahead of Stewart when the green flag waved with 16 lap to go after the last of 10 caution nags. 
The streaking Stewart, on the way to his 13th consecutive fin­ish of eighth or better, was relentless in trying to retake the lead, pulling up to the rear quarterpanel of Newman's Penske Racing South Dodge time after time before finally slipping below him on the back­stretch on lap 292. 

But Newman, whose last win came a year ago in Dover, wouldn't give up. He stayed with Stewart, got beneath the Joe Gibbs Racing Chevrolet on lap 299 and pulled ahead, stay­ing out front to win by 0.292­seconds. 
Chase contenders Matt Kenseth and Greg Biflle finished third and fourth, followed by Dale Earnhardt Jr., who is out of the Chase but running his first race with Tony Eury Jr. back as his crew chief. 
"Tony and I are a good combi­nation," said fan favorite Earnhardt, who has struggled through a disappointing season. "And we're going to try to work toward next year. These next nine races are real important and we're going to try to build on that." 
Newman was ecstatic after his first win in 35 races, finally breaking through for a win after season-long struggles ­and doing it in the biggest race so far this season. 
"That was a long time without a Cup win," said Newman, who drove part-time in the Busch Series this season and got a big boost by winning three straight races at one point. 
"It felt so good to be able to win in the Busch Series and win three races over there. That builds confidence in a driver," he said. 
As for his battle with Stewart, Newman said, "Getting back by him was a lot easier than him getting by me because I was giving him everything I could. I just did exactly the same thing to him that he did to me." 
Stewart was philosophic about losing the race in such a great battle. 
"I got used up a little bit on running on the high side, but that was a good race," he said. "But that was some kind of short track racing right there. That's the way the Chase should start just like that. 
"Ryan did an awesome job. We just couldn't hold him off at the end." . 

It was Newman's 12th career win and, more important, moved him from 1Oth in the standings -a position he bare­ly grabbed with a 12th place finish last week in Hichmond ­to a tie for third with teammate Rusty Wallace, both of them trailing Stewart by 40 points and Greg Biffle by 20. 
Wallace finished sixth, with Chase contenders Mark Martin sixth, Jeremy Mayfield 16th, Carl Edwards 19th and defend­ing champion Kurt Busch, involved in a crash on the sec­ond lap of the race, 35th. 
Busch, who startPd his charge toward his title with a victory here last year in the opener of the inaugural Chase, was sent spinning into the wall in a colli­sion with Scott Higgs on the sec­ond lap. 
The furious champion drove his battered, smoking car to the garage, then strode to Riggs' pits, where he climbed up the pit box and spoke for a few moments to Riggs' crew chief Rodney Childers. 

Asked what Busch said to him, Childers said, "They've had some past experiences with stuff. He took us out at Indy and we forgave them. This was an accident and he'll have to for­give us." 
Busch then stalked back to the garage, where his team 
worked furiously to get the car repaired. Busch, who began the day in fifth place, just 20 points behind Stewart, finally returned to the race on lap 68, 66 laps behind the leaders. With the help of attrition, Busch worked his way up from 43rd to 35th, a difference of 24 points. 
WNBA 

Monarchs are on the brink of championship after win 
Yolanda Griffith leads Sacramento with 19 points and 11 boards 
Associated Press 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. -When the Sacramento Monarchs seemed ready to lose their lead and their heads in Game 3 of the WNBA Finals, Yolanda Griffith slid into her coach's chair during a timeout. 
Whatever instructions or encouragement she barked at her teammates, they worked ­mostly because Griffith motivat­ed herself to another big game. 
Griflith had 19 points and 11 rebounds with relentless inside play, and the Monarchs moved to 
"We,re waiting for 

the brink of their as much to the first championship everybody to step crowd afterward, Sunday with a 66-screaming: "We

Connecticut Sun. Griffith's team­After being Yolanda Griffith mates largely strug­named to the All­Monarchs center gled on offense with 
and Nicole Powell tied a WNBA Finals record with four 3-point­ers. But Griffith was the differ­ence -and even after putting the Monarchs up 2-1 in the best-of-five series, she was still smoldering. 
"Even though we're home, land) I know their backs are against the wall right now, even though we're up [2-1], I should be happy. Am I? I don't know," Griffith said. ''I mean, I'm just not satisfied, because I know we can play better ball. Tuesday, I hope it's the game. We'r.e wait­ing for everybody to step up and bring it." · 
Game 4 is Tuesday night at Arco Arena, where the Monarchs hope to wrap up the best season in franchise history with a title. DeMya Walker proelaimed 
WNBA team earlier in the day, Griffith played with the relentless ener­gy that's driven her through seven seasons. She dominated the paint with five offensive rebounds and nonstop defensive energy, and her f'inal basket with 3:24 left stalled the Sun's last-gasp rally. 
Kara Lawson scored 16 points and hit six free throws in the final minute for the Monarchs, 17-of-52 shooting, 

but the Monarchs made just seven turnovers and survived the Sun's final rally with their signature defense, which frustrated Connecticut into 16 turnovers and an after­noon of terrible shooting. 
The Sun might be running out of energy and healthy players, but they still believe they're capable of winning a series that's been close in the final 
· 
minutes of all three games. 

"I guess I'm not much of a prognosticator, because I thought we would play our best game of the series today, and we played our worst," said Connecticut coach Mike Thibault, who wrote a series of unflattering statisties on the locker room chalkboard after the game. "They're disruptjve [defensively!, but by this point in the series, we should be able to better handle it." , 
The Monarchs opened thei second half with a 15-5 run ' including eight points from Griffith, and they led 50-36 with 11 1/2 minutes to play. Connecticut rallied with 12 con­secutive points in four minutes, capped by Ashja Jones' jumper to cut the Monan~hs' lead to 55­53 with 4:18 left. 
But Griffith snapped her dub's five-minute scoreless skid with a layup, and Sacramento finished on a 9-0 run while Connecticut couldn't score in the final 3 minutes, 16 seconds. 
"Mistakes, turnovers, that's part of what our defensive intention is," Sacramento coach John Whisenant said. "We make their shots harder, eliminate their assists. That's all part of being alert and intense. Our goal in everything we do is built around our defense, our whole game from start to finish." 
Taj McWilliams-Franklin had 16 points and 13 rebounds for the Sun, but went scoreless in the final 7:18. Nykesha Sales scored 1 7 points after a slow start, but the Connecticut stars' teammates managed just eight field goals. 
Lindsay Whalen, who sat out Game 2 for Connecticut with a sprained ankle and a leg injury, seored two points and made five turnovers in 22 ineffective min­utes. She sat out down the stretch, and her absence hurt when backup Jamie Carey missed an open fast-break layup with 1:49 to play.

Formnr head coach of nine ynars and current assistant coach Dave Barstis said the Bolles looknd at tho moot as preparation for their upcom­ing conferen.ee schedule. 
"Traditionally, we view this meet as a warm-up to our eonference meet, which is next weekend," he said. "It's more of a workout for us than it is a true raee."

full advantage of it. 
Two Saint Mary's students donned. the school's Belle­head costumes and cheered on the Belles along the course route. 
Saint Mary's head coach Jackie Bauters was thrilled to have tho support. 
"It was great to have them out there," she said. 
Barstis said the crowd was part of the advantage for the eross-county tnam to partid­patn in a racn so dose to their campus. 
"The Belle-heads, they're typically more at the [homoI basketball games and soccer games," he said. "They've come out for us tho last cou­ple years, which is really great. It's that whole home­meet sprit." 
Barstis said the main thing the Belles worried about in the race was avoiding injuries, which they did. 
"This course is a little rough around the edges," he said. "The rough is really rough, and we worry about ankles turning." 
Barstis said the times might have been somewhat slower than the team could have run, but the coach viewed the event as successful. 
"We had a hard week," he said. "We were on the track, we ran hills this week, so they're running on tired legs. 
"For us, traditionally the times are slow, but it's because of that -because they're tired. You'll see much more favorable times next week when we taper."

Megan Mattia leads teatn in N ortnal, Ill. 
By JORDAN BELTZ 
Spons Writer 

The Bolles went into the weekend riding a huge emotion­al high after their conference opening vietory on Wodnesday, and parlayed that confidence into a solid performance at the Illinois Wesleyan Fall Classic in Normal, Ill. 
The Belles came out of the Fall Classic with an 11 th-plaee finish, besting 13 other schools. In two rounds, the Belles shot a 644 composite score, just two 
 strokes back of a top-1 0 finish. Depauw, a bitter rival of the Belles, took home the title after shooting a 601 composite score. Other notable finishes indud­ed the host school Illinois Wesleyan Titans squad finishing second, while the University of Indianapolis came into the dub­house fourth. 
As has been the norm all sea­son long, senior Megan Mattia set the pace for the Belles. She fired a 77 -stroke first round and a 78 second round for 155 total, good enough for a No. 17 over­all finish. Kirsten Fantom shot a 158, which put her in a tie for No. 29. Hounding out the top five for the Belles were Katie O'Brien (No. 53), Nicole Bellino (No. 66) and Erin McQuoni1 (No. 
IB!. 
"We wern a little disappointnd with the way wn finishnd." Mattia said. "We got bnat by a few teams that we should hn beating. We are del'initely steadily improving as tlw snason moves on, so we should bn abln to finish strong." 
The Belles arn currently ranked No. 4 in the latnst Division-Ill wonwn's golf poll. They have put together strong middle-of-the-pack f'inishns in the larger invitationals that they have playnd in thus far, and nmt~rgnd victorious from thnir only conference match of the season to date. 
"We're ready to go out lli1Xt week and dominate," Mattia said. "Wo're going to show that we can play as wnll as we know that we can." 
The Belles arn looking to wrap up the rnmainder of their regu­lar season on a high notn with their nnal two confnrnnce matches this wenk. They travel to Olivnt College Wodnesday, and then they bring the regular season to a eonelusion on Saturday at Adrian Collegn.

At 22:1 0, Thorlakson booted a corner kiek towards the net, and Jen Buczkowski took a setup from Christie Shaner and head­ed it into the net.

The game was put out of reach at 71:38 when Susan Pinnick put the ball in the back of the net for her third goal or the season. 
Much like two weekends ago against Maryland, Notre Dame missed on several scoring opportunities, but Waldrum was not concerned with that aspect of the game.

"We're gonna face that all year," Thorlakson said. "Teams are gonna look for a way to !beat usl. and that's a strategy that some teams are gonna take." 
Notre Dame started off slow, missing an early seoring oppor­tunity when Thorlakson missed left al'tnr beating a defender, but Notrn Dame responded quickly thnrnal'tnr. 
on the outside many people look at it and say that they should worry that they didn't finish enough of their chances. If you look at our team we're aetually I think leading the nation in goals scored per game. 
"I would worry more if we weren't creating the opportuni­ties that I am about not finish­ing." 
After Sunday's game, Waldrum spoke about the way the Irish season has gone thus far, and is comfortable with the current direction that the team is heading in. 
"We're on traek of where we need to be," Waldrum said. "''d be worried if we were peaking right now, it's a little early for that but I think we're playing really well." 
It was also important for the Irish to respond with a strong performance this weekend, proving the loss last weekend is a distant memory. 
"That was unlucky last week­end," Thorlakson said. "This weekend we were just building on our confidence that we had all season. Sometimes it just 
doesn't go our way." 
After the dominanee the Irish displayed against DePaul and Miehigan, it was dear that this weekend, it did. 
Notes: 
+ Waldrum spoke after the Michigan game about the Notre Dame-Michigan rivalry and the type of attitude that it brings to the game's atmosphere. 
"Its kinda like football," he said. "I guess it's the same rival­ry just being so close and the two institutions having such tra­dition. I think that translates into all of our sports here." 
The Wolverines spoiled the Irish 2003 season, ending Notre Dame's undefeated run and then knoeking them out of the NCM tournament in the span or roughly two weeks. 
"I think that was a motivation last year for the kids, and then this year espedally gotting thnm back home," he said. "I think thn motivation is always tlwrn with Michigan."

Smyth won the men's race 
with a time of 24:36, a full 14 seconds ahead of Horvat. The ·two ran neck-and-neck for the first four miles, but Smyth pulled away during the fifth

Smyth said his experience 
running in similar one-on-one 
situations in high school 
helped during his battle with 
Horvat. 
"You can kind of feel [your 
opponent] out," he said. "By 
the last mile you know if 
they're tiring or not. I knew he 
was hurting, so I took off with 
a mile to go." 
Smyth also credited his late 
race success to working out at 
Burke during the week. 
Dame ahead by one point after four runners had come in for each team, but a hard charge by Irish freshman Mark Moore came up four seconds and two places behind Duquesne sen­ior Zach Dorman. 
For the second straight meet, Piane sent out a young lineup made up of freshmen and sophomores in an effort to rest his more experienced runners for later competition and get his inexperienced run­ners more race time. 
Sophomore Mike Popejoy and freshman Kevin Vaselik ran along with Smyth, Adams, Bradley, Rodriguez and Moore for the Irish men. 
It is important for freshmen to learn how to run an 8K race instead of the shorter 5K. 
"You can't go out too hard or your going to tire at the end of the race more than you would with a 5K," Smyth said. 
Smyth also commented on the transition in training from high school cross-country to college. 
"The whole team has been pushing me to limits I've never been pushed to before in my running career," he said. 
The Irish women had a much easier time, cruising to a victory with a more experi­enced lineup. 
Olding, a former All­American, won the race. Senior Elizabeth Webster was the next Irish runner across the line in sixth place with a time of 18:08. Next for Notre Dame was junior Ann Mazur, who finished 11th with a time of 18:24. 
Then the Irish pack came in, with six runners -senior Jean Marinangeli, sophomore Julie Opet, freshman Becca Bauman, junior Katie DeRusso, senior Loryn King and junior Amy Kohlmeyer ­finishing within 20 seconds and nine places of each other. 
This huge group of Irish pushed back the fourth and fifth runners for both Duquesne and third place Xavier and helped Notre Dame win going away. 
Loyola finished fourth, fol­lowed by Dayton, Bellarmine and the College of St. Benedict. 
On the men's side, Xavier finished a distant third, fol­lowed by Lewis, Dayton and Loyola.

"I thought we did a really good job of coming back," Brown said. "It was a battle. We came up on the short end unfortunately." 
On Friday, Notre Dame eased past Tulane {1-2) 30­23, 30-26, 30-26 in what Brown called another "sloppi­ly" played match. 
"We were really not pleased at all with the way we played on Friday even though we won," she said. "That sloppi­ness sometimes carries over." 
It carried over well into Sunday morning. 
The Tigers outplayed the Irish in most facets of the game. The Irish, who are the only Division-! team ranked in the top 10 in both digs and blocks, faltered on defense for much of the day. 
LSU beat Notre Dame in those categories. One stand­out on defense, though, was sophomore libero Adrianna Stasiuk, who had 25 digs ­the third time this season she has accomplished the feat. 
The Tigers also had 25 more kills than the normally domi­nant Irish. 
Notre Dame freshman Mallorie Croal had a career­high day. She smashed 19 kills and hustled for 16 digs. She added four blocks to her strong outing. Senior Lauren Brewster got her fair share of kills, as well, with 14. Fellow senior Lauren Kelbley had 10 kills, while Meg. Henican and Carolyn Cooper combined for 14 more. 
While the defense sputtered at times, the offense was effective, besides being out­blocked. Notre Dame had more service aces than errors,· and it served at an incredibly accurate 94.6 per­cent efficiency rate in the match. 
On Friday, the Irish played an emotional Green Wave squad. Tulane had not played a match in a little under three weeks. Still, Notre Dame swept the Wave to improve to 7-0. Kelbley pounded 15 kills. She led the team with 21 points, hit at a season-high mark [.4121 and smacked her kills without a single error. 
Stasiuk played at outside hitter instead of playing at libero and had 19 digs. 
Just as they were in Sunday's match, the Irish were at the top of their serv­ice game against the Wave. They registered 12 aces. 
With the win and a nail biter of a loss, the Irish aren't moping around. They're still off to one of the best starts in school history. 
"We win as a team, and we lose as a team," Brown said. "[After the weekend matches] I think we just talked about maximizing the opportunities we have out on the court. Whether it's at practice or whether it's playing [in a match!. Every time we get on the court we have to be get­ting better; we have to be get­ting smarter."

Taming the Wolverines 
Notre Dame sends message to the country; wins twice this weekend 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN Associate Sports Editor 
After losing to Santa Clara last weekend in California, the Irish sent a very clear message to every team in the country this weekend -one loss will not slow them down. 
The Irish dominated DePaul Friday night and beat Michigan Sunday, outscoring their oppo­nents 9-0 combined. 
"I think it sends a message· around the country that the loss doesn't affect us and that we're still there," Irish coach Randy Waldrum said. 
On Friday night, the Irish came out lirnd up in their first Big East conference game of the season and defeated the Blue Demons 6-0 in a game that Notre Dame controlled from the beginning. Familiar faces led

Notre Dame had a chance to tie the game with 11:20 left in the first half. John Stephens took a shot ofT of a rebound of a Greg Dalby free kick, but Red Storm goalie Jason Landers was there for the save. The play would prove to bn Notre Dame's only shot on goal in the game.
