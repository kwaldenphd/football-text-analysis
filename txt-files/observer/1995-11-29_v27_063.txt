TilE INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER SERVING NOTRE DAME AND SAINT MARY'S 
ND chapter of SADD kicks off Inonth of awareness 
By DEREK BETCIIER Nt-w.• Wrircr 
For the Notre Dame chapter of Students Against Drunk Driving, Thursday kicks on· National Drunk and Drugged Driving Awareness Month. The mmnhllrs of SADD and the Office of Alcohol and Drug Education invite the student body to wear red throughout the day and participate in a candlelight vigil starting at 8 p.m. at Stonehenge. 
At the war memorial. SADD will dis­tribute candles to participants, who will tlwn sihmtly walk to the Grotto. In addi­tion to providing an opportunity to remember those who died as a result of drunk driving, event organizers hope tlwir procession will serve as a silent reminder to the entire campus before the holidays not to climb behind the wheel after drinking. Upon reaching the Crotto. participants will light more candles from their initial candles. 
SAI>D eo-presidents Michelle McGarry and Christine Duffy have high hopes for thn event. With the event deliberately planned near the start of the festive holiday season, both sec raising atten­tion to the problem of drunk driving as a key to future prevention of accidents. 
"Thll whole purpose of SADD is that we feel very strongly that drinking and driving is something that can be pre­vented," McGarry said. 
"People here are smart enough and have so much going for them that they should really be able to avoid acci­dents," she added. 
Duffy said, "This is a college campus, so drunk driving is a big problem here. It's unfortunate that some people don't want to admit this, but this is why we're trying to increase awareness. Just one person lost is one person too many." 
Both SADD presidents acknowledged the Office of Alcohol and Drug Awareness for co-sponsoring the event. 
"They're great to work with. We're separate organizations, but we plan schedules around each other, and they're a huge help with flyers and funding," Duffy said. 
Future S.\DD events include Contracts For Life next semester, where students sign contracts with friends to help remind and motivate them not to drink and drive. Later in the spring, SADD plans to work with local high schools in establishing a drunk driving education program to raise awareness. 
The presidents note that their SADD

Federal Court grants stay for Bttrris 
By NANCY ARMOUR A"•ociared Press 
MICHIGAN CITY, Ind. 
Less than 12 hours before he was to be executed, Gary Burris had just ordered his last meal when he heard his attorney scream. 
A federal appeals court had granted a stay. 
"Within a phone call he went from steak and lobster to a sack lunch, that was OK with him," said Lorinda Youngcourt, one of Burris' attorney. "Needless to say we're all ecstatic. llow close can you come to getting hit by a truck?" 
The stay was issued around noon CST, 12 hours from Bur­ris' scheduled midnight execu­tion at the Indiana State Prison. He would have been the first inmate executed under Indiana's new lethal injection law. 

Burris is appealing on the grounds he did not get a fair sentence, an issue the federal appellate court has yet to con­sider. Earlier this year, though the Indiana Supreme Court still was considering the fair­ness of his sentence, Burris chose to appeal to the federal court on the grounds he had ineffective counsel at trial. 
That appeal was rejected. When Burris came before the federal court last week to ap· peal the fairness of his sen· tence. a three-judge panel ruled 2·1 that while Burris might have a valid claim, he had exhausted his appellate rights earlier this spring. 
Burris was convicted in 1980 of murdering cab driver Ken­neth Chambers. The 31-year­old father of two had been robbed of $40 and shot in the head. His nude, frozen body was ~ound in an alley. 

Debate to ask 'What is a Belle?' 
By KARA PAVLIK News Writer 
What is a Belle? Who are the Belles of Saint Mary's? 
Saint Mary's wants to know. 

Spurred by controversy over the appropriateness of Saint Mary's mascot, the "Belles," the college's Women's Center is holding a debate between stu­dents who strongly believe the college should retain the mas­cot and those who support a change. The debate takes place tonight at 7:30 p.m. in Haggar Parlor. 
Recently, the mascot was deemed unsuitable by students who claim the "Belles" repre­sent the wrong image for the school. 

"A belle uses her looks to ac­complish the things she wants. This doesn't embody the rea­sons we've chosen to come to Saint Mary's. Here our self value comes from our soul. our mind," said senior Kelly McDe­vitt. 
But not all students agree. "A belle, meaning a beautiful woman, is all encompassing of the qualities of a woman. rep­resenting both physical beauty and intellectual beauty," said junior Janet Kelley. 
Rhetoric from both sides will help decide the future of the mascot. The Women's Center is encouraging students to come and assess whether the "Belles" should continue to symbolize the school and its athletics. 
Although the debate is spon­sored by the center, six mem­bers of the student body -not involved in the organization ­have been chosen to participate in the debate. They've been asked to take sides both for and against a mascot change. 
" We're not trying to conjure up hate for the school. We just want to understand how the students feel about the issue," said Tina Lemker, a senior member of the Women's Cen­ter. 
One survey indicated that stu­dents are equally divided over the issue, with a slight majority opposed to change. Raising questions about the survey's validity. the Women's Center is currently conducting another. 
Still, a survey will not deter­mine whether a change in the mascot will occur. "We just want to discuss what the 'Belles' means. We're not nec­essarily endorsing the mascot to be changed," said Tiffany Matula, a senior member of the Women's Center. 
Even though students balk about a possible mascot change, the debate is also in­tended to raise consciousness on campus, including an awareness of the history of the "Belles." 
"Any sort of political activism is good. We need to raise the women consciousness of women on this campus," said junior Maria Isabel Rivas. 
Lemker agreed saying the debate over the mascot is "breathing new life" on a cam­pus not traditionally known for taking stands on controversial issues.

Giving 
the gift 


of life 

Twenty-seven days. This is the countdown until Christmas. 
In this giving season I am reminded of an article I read in the Chicago Tribune several months ago. The article was on organ donation. Allow me to briefly summarize the article. 
A young girl from the projects in south Chicago had been shot accidentally by a friend of the family. She died, but her organs were still functional. In a Chicago suburb a teenag­er was in need of a heart. Needless to say the young girl's heart now beats inside this subur­ban teen. 
What struck me most about this article was some of the feeling expressed in the words. The young girl's mother did not really think twice. Despite her situation, despite her anguish, she saw a chance to make a differ­ence. The young girl's sister probably helped to express it best, when she said that her sis­ter was living on, in the body of this suburban youth. 
I could go on to point out that the suburban youth was white and the young girl was black, but race was not an issue for the parties involved, it should not be an issue here. 
But what is the issue? Why am I talking about organ donation in the Inside Column? It is the season of giving which warrants this space. 
As the holidays approach, the theme of giv­ing comes to the fore. Despite the commer­cialization of the holidays there is still the underlying element of faith and giving behind the spirit of the season. 
Would anyone be strong enough to make this decision? I have already indicated on my driver's license that I am a willing organ donor. I know if I am somehow taken untime­ly in an accident, I would want my organs to be put to good use. If some part of me could help another person live, then perhaps I have served a purpose; my life mattered, my death mattered to someone because it meant that person could live. 
I am also reminded of another story of self­less giving. This story involves a daughter and her ultimate act of love for her father. 
A young woman who was tragically killed in a car accident had indicated that she wanted her organs donated. As it turned out her father was in need of a heart. In her death, her father was able to live. Surely they were saddened by the young woman's death, but her life found a purpose beyond death. 
But again I am brought back to the first example of organ donation. This example strikes a different chord because of the cir­cumstances around it. In this case the giving transcended race, it transcended class; what mattered was a young girl with a usable heart and a teenager in need. 
This selfless act, an act of passion and com­passion that the mother of the young girl did not have to agree to but did. She knew what it was like to lose a child. She knew the pain, she was experiencing it. She reached down deep inside and found the strength and courage to rise above her tragedy. She found a way to let her daughter live on, even in death. She gave the gift of life. 
The views expressed in the Inside Column are those of the author and not necessarily those ofThe Observer.

Two People Dead and 15 Missing in Ganges River 
PATNA, India 
Two people are dead and 15 are missing after the 
overcrowded ferry they were riding sank in the Ganges 
River in northern India on Monday, police said. 
The boat was carrying 75 people, 15 more than its 
maximum capacity, when it overturned about 100 yards 
from shore. 
It was crossing the Ganges River at Munger, 110 miles 
northwest of Patna, the capital of Bihar state, officials 
said. Bihar is 700 miles southeast of New Delhi, the 
Indian capital. 
It was the sixth boat to capsize in the state this year 
alone, in accidents that have killed at least 400 people. 
Despite safety regulations, boats in Bihar are often 
crowded and rarely carry life jackets or other safety 
equipment. 
Officials declinedto speculate on what may have caused 
the accident. It was not immediately clear to what extent 
the overcrowding may have contributed the sinking of 
the ferry. 
The efforts of the two-day search have proved futile. As of Tuesday night, none of the fifteen missing bodies . bave been discovered. Drowning is suspected. 
Officials are currently looking into the safety of the fer­
ries, and questioning the lack of safety equipment, 
according to police. 
Nader represents Green Party 
Consumer advocate Ralph Nader gave the Green Party permission to put his name on its presidential primary ballot in California, but he is not actu­ally campaigning for the White House. Nader said he was urged to run by Green Party state leaders and mem­bers, as well as activists. "I will not seek nor accept any campaign contri­

butions -but I welcome civic energy to build democracy so as to strengthen and make more usable our democrat­ic processes for a just, productive and substantial soci­ety," he said. The Green Party cites "ecological wis­dom," social justice and nonviolence among its key val­ues. Organizers said Nader's appearance on the ballot is part of a "People's Campaign" to challenge the tradition­al party system. 

Evidence destroyed in Snoop case 
LOS ANGELES 
Rap star Snoop Doggy Dogg and his former bodyguard hunted down a rival and shot him to death in a case of street justice, a prosecutor said in his opening statement. "This shooting was the result of a ... street mentality that when someone does something to you, that you have to go and take care of business," Deputy District Attorney Ed Nison said Monday. He said Philip Woldemariam, 20, was shot in retaliation for a dispute at the rapper's house. But jurors rolled their eyes and shook their heads when told that police accidentally destroyed evidence in the murder case. Nison said previously that officers destroyed the clothing, along with a bullet and empty shell casing, during a mixup. But he insisted that jurors still would see enough evidence to find the rapper, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, and bodyguard McKinley Lee guilty of the 1993 shooting. "It was the bullet holes in Philip that caused his death and not the bullet holes in his clothing," Nison told jurors. Defense lawyers have said they plan to attack the credibility of the Los Angeles 
Police Department.

Photos contribute to murder case 
TORRANCE, Calif. 

Photos found in the home of a photographer charged with killing model Linda Sobek raise the possibility the man was involved in other deaths, the Daily Breeze reported today. Charles Rathbun was charged with mur­der yesterday, said Sandi Gibbons. spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. He faced arraignment later in the day and prosecutors recom­mended bail be set at $1 million. Among the dozens of photos of women found in the professional photograph­er's home, some appeared to portray death, the newspa­per said. "We may be looking at a serial killer," the source told the paper. In Ohio, where Rathbun lived for a time, The Columbus Dispatch quoted his father, H. Robert Rathbun, as saying his son was charged with rape in June 1979 but was acquitted eight months later. Sobek, a former Los Angeles Raiders cheerleader, was killed Nov. 16. 

Shrine to the 'pulpy, maligned fruit' 
ALTADENA, Calif. 

If it peels, bruises and comes in a bunch, Ken Bannister has something that looks, smells or tastes like it. These are a few of 15,500 items you can find in his Banana Museum: A banana phone. Banana pajamas. Banana-flavored toothpaste. Banana warmers from Germany. A banana nose. Banana Christmas lights. Banana popcorn. "I think it's crazy. I love this. I get so wound up talking about it. I'm just an old-fashioned guy who believes in the need to keep people's spirits up, to exercise one's sense of humor daily." His museum, he says, is sorely needed "in a world gone bananas." Bannister has become a sought-after character. He extols the virtues of bananas at grocery store lectures and has appeared on several national talk shows. Bannister reminds his audiences that the "pulpy, elongated, curva­ceous, maligned fruit" is also the world's most perfect snack. "Yeah, it's made fun of and kicked around," he deadpans. "But it comes in its own wrapper, and it doesn't squirt, squeak or leak."

Hundreds of American GI's headed for Bosnia 
By ROBERT BURNS 
Associated Press 
BHUSSELS, Belgium 

As many as 700 U.S. soldiers will enter Bosnia in a few days as part of a spearhead NATO force to begin clearing the way for the main body of allied peacekeepers, Defense Secretary William Perry said today. 
Speaking to reporters en route from Washington to NATO headquarters in the Belgian capital, Perry provided new details about the U.S. part of the Bosnia mission to be car­ried out by a NATO force called the Implementation Force, or !FOR. 
President Clinton said Monday he will ask Congress for an expression of support for the mission as soon as he approves a final version of the IFOH plan. Clinton is expected to give the go-ahead after see­ing U.S. commanders on Saturday. 
Perry flew to Brussels to work out final arrangements for the peace mission. One of his main goals was to settle a dispute with Russia over how much say Moscow will have in political decisions about the Bosnia peace operation. 
Perry met with Hussian Defense Minister Gen. Pavel Grachev today at NATO head­quarters to find a formula to satisfy Moscow's demand that it be given a substantial voice in political deliberations. while preserving the role of NATO's political arm, the North Atlantic Council, as the sole authority for lFOH. 
Russia is not a NATO member and therefore has no seat on the North Atlantic Council. 
After his meeting with Pnrry, Grachev told reporters in a brief encounter that he was pleased and confident the polit­ical issue would be settled. It was not immediately clear from his remarks whether he and Perry had reached an agree­ment. 
A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Grachev provided Perry with a previously confidential plan with details on Hussian peace­keeper deployments, including the number that would join the U.S.-led force. 
Perry said an advance group of NATO troops, including between 500 and 700 American Gls, would head for Bosnia exactly two weeks ahead of a Paris conference at whieh the leaders of Serbia, Croatia and the Bosnian Muslims are to sign the peace treaty that the war­ring factions initialed in Dayton, Ohio, on Nov. 21. 
The date for the Paris session is not firm, but Perry said it would be in mid-December. That means the first NATO troops would enter Bosnia as early as this weekend to set up communications, headquarters, supply bases and other basic infrastructure to enable the full 60,000-soldier NATO peace force to move in. 
The main NATO force, to include about 20,000 American troops, would begin deploying to Bosnia "within a few days at most" after the Paris signing ceremony, Perry said. 
About one-half of the 20,000­soldier U.S. contingent will be in place in Bosnia about three or four weeks after the Paris conference, and it will take anothnr month or so to get the full American force there, Perry said. They will be under the command of U.S. Army Maj. Gen. William Nash, commandnr of the 1st Armored Division. 
Perry, who visited twice in recent weeks with the U.S. troops training for Bosnia, said he was confident they are pre­pared for the difficult Bosnia task. 
"I think our troops aro going to bo as ready for a military operation as they've ever been," he said. 
Serving as part of Nash's divi­sion in Bosnia will be troops from several other countries, Perry said, inducting a Turkish battalion of about 1,200 men and a 4,000-soldier Nordic brigade from Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Many of thos1~ troops have experienen in Bosnia bneausn they have bnnn serving there as part of a U.N. peacekeeping force that is about to Jose its mandate. 
The American unit also may have troops from Poland and the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, Perry said. A Hussian contingent of roughly 2,000 soldiers also will be part of the American divi­sion, if Perry and Graehev work out the dispute over political control. 
On Nov. 8, Perry and Grachev agreed on military command arrangements for the Hussian soldiers. But they left unre­solved the issue of political con­trol. 
The problem is that Moscow wants what would amount to veto power over aspncts of the peacekeeping operation. Washington and its NATO allies insist that whiln Hussian diplo­mats could be consulted on key decisions. the final say would rest with NATO. 
Unless the politieal issue is settled, the Hussians would not join the Bosnia peace force. That would not stop NATO from going ahead with its Bosnia plan for implementing thn Dayton peace agreement, but it would harm U.S.-Hussian n~Ja­tions and undermine efforts to make NATO more acceptable to Moscow.

British, Irish striving for summit as Clinton arrives 
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK 
Associared Press 
BELFAST, Northern Ireland 
Hoping to nudge the Northern Ireland peace process forward before President Clinton arrives, British and Irish lead­ers tried again today to resolve their differences over disarming the IRA. 
British Prime Minister John Major and Irish Prime Minister John Bruton had a 50-minute telephone conversation this morning, but still hadn't reached agreement, their of­fices said. 
Washington sources indicated late Monday that prospects were improving for an Anglo­Irish summit to agree on the conditions for multi-party ne­gotiations in Northern Ireland.

Five members of CARE will be per­forming "When a Kiss is Not Just a Kiss" on Monday, De­cember 4 at 7:30 p.m. in the Library Auditorium. The pro­gram will feature five charac­ters involved in a rape. 

After the characters finish performing their scene, the au­dience will have the opportuni­ty to question the characters regarding their actions in the scene. The actors will then slip out of character and ask the audience different ques­tions.

HPC also heard a report reviewing the Campus Life Council's last meeting. The CLC announced that a campus calendar will be on the Internet by next semester. Information on how to access the calendar will be forthcom­ing. 

On Monday, the CLC will vote on whether or not to bring the issue of co-residentiality to the Board of Trustees. However, a vote to bring the matter to the Board will not mean that the CLC advocates co-residentiali­ty, but rather that they believe the Board should consider the issue.

cornerstone of the Northern Ireland peace process. Their joint offer in December 1993 to inc!'ud·e IRA supporters and pro-British "loyalist" groups in negotiations if they laid down their arms led to cease-fires from both camps the following fall, ending a quarter-century of bombings and gun attacks. 
Britain and Ireland initially maintained a united front in urging the loyalists and IRA to start disarming. But in September, after tense discus­sions with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, the Irish decided the IRA wouldn't deliver even a token disposal of weapons and since have pressed Britain to compromise. 
That split between the two governments scuttled a planned Sept. 6 Anglo-Irish summit, and a meeting between Bruton and Major has been on hold ever since. 
John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, Sinn Fein's moderate ri­val for Catholic-nationalist votes, said Tuesday's contacts offered "some hope there will be a breakthrough."

Gene 01ay play early role in breast cancer 
By MALCOLM RITTER 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

Scientists have identified a gene that might play an early role in producing breast can­cer, a finding that might lead to ways to prevent such cancers. 
Scientists found that the gene was frequently overactive in early breast canrers but only rarely so in noncancerous breast abnormalities. 
If further research shows that the overactivity promotes breast cancer, drugs aimed at slowing it down may prevent some breast cancers in women at high risk, said researcher Dr. David Page. 
The finding may also even­tually lead to a test to tell whether certain microscopic breast abnormalities signal a particularly high risk of breast cancer later on. Page said. That could allow preventive treat­ment, he said. 
The work is presented in the December issue of the journal Nature Medicine by Patricia Steeg of the National Cancer Institute, Page of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tenn., and others. 
The gene tells cells how to 

produce a protein called cyclin 
D. The protein is one of several that tell cells to produce an ex­tra set of genetic material to be passed along when the cell di­vides into two. It may also have other jobs, Steeg said. 
The researchers looked at an indicator of the gene's activity in 94 breast abnormalities that had been removed in biopsies. 
They found that the gene had been overactive in only 18 per­cent of noncancerous lesions. 
In contrast, overactivity ap­peared in 76 percent of one kind of early breast cancer and 87 percent of a different early kind, and 83 percent of sam­ples from full-blown, life­threatening breast cancer. 
Steeg cautioned that scien­tists have not yet shown whether the overactivity actu­ally encourages breast cancer. Nor have women been followed over time to see if overactivity in certain lesions signals an el­evated risk of breast cancer later, she said. 
Dr. Larry Norton, chief of breast cancer medicine at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Can­cer Center in New York, said the work is among several studies that are giving clues about the origins of early breast cancer. 

Rail strike passes day five 
By EDUARDO CUE 
Associated Press 

PARIS 
Traffic jams stretched to 20 miles today as French transport workers remained off the job for a fifth straight day, joined by other government employees in a showdown over austerity policies. 
Rail, subway and bus service was crippled in and around Paris, forcing commuters to drive to work. Postal and other public services were curtailed. 
Regional train service was sporadic in many parts of the country, and few long-distance trains between major cities were operating today. 
Those running risked being stopped by pickets blocking lines. 
Thousands of rail workers, accompanied by students and doctors, marched in Paris to protest plans to increase the number of years government workers must pay social securi-

ty taxes before they can retire with,fuli benefits. 
The strike was called by two of three major unions. Both remained adamant even after the conservative government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe of­fered Monday night to exempt employees of the state-owned SNCF railway company. 
The unions were considering organizing another strike next month, the newspaper Le Monde reported today. 
But Labor Minister Alain Lamassoure said the govern­ment's resolve "is not going to break." The government is struggling to slash a $64 billion budget deficit to comply with tough European Union rules for a single currency by 1999. 
The government wants to re­duce the national railroad com­pany's $35 billion debt by in­creasing layoffs and turning over unprofitable local lines to regional governments. 
Blonde) said the rail workers were not responsible for the problems the strike is causing commuters.

Woman sells son for drugs Airman's mother buries 
By BRIAN AKRE 
Associated Press 
DETROIT 

A mother sold her 15-year­old son to a drug dealer to pay a $1,000 crack cocaine debt, and the boy was found today arter being missing for about six months, police said. 
Police were investigating ac­counts that Uw hoy was forced to usn drugs and became an addkt, was used as a sex slave and was beatnn, Inspector Miehafll Hall said. lie said polkn Wflrtl awaiting conlirrna­tion through u nwdieal exami­nation. 
"lie's dnlinitcly a victim, re­gardltlss of what the circum­stances wenl," llall told re­portnrs. 
The boy was very thin when he was found, police Sgt. Shel­ley Foy said earlier. "He's a very old 15-year-old," Hall said. 
The boy has been "semi-co­operative," Hall said, but while he admits stealing narcotics he denies he was sold into the world of drugs. 
Hall said police "have an indication that at some point, he became a willing partner in drug dealing." 
The boy's 33-year-old mother was being held on an unrelated burglary charge. Hall said po­lice also were seeking addi­tional charges related to the hoy's case, with specific charges up to the prosecutor's office.

left willingly with the dope man," Foy said. "But that story didn't check out. Our informa­tion is this woman owed the dealer between $600 and $2,000. To help satisfy that debt, she literally sold her boy." 
News reports said witnesses told police the boy was forced to sell drugs, told to smoke crack when hungry, beaten for coming up $10 short on drug sales and offered sexually to male customers. 
Hall and Foy declined to detail the conditions in which the boy was found. 
They said he called his grand­mother Monday night after tele­vision stations aired accounts of the case. 
She later gave police the tele­phone number from which he called, but police did not find the boy at that address. An­other tip, from an unidentified man, led to the house where the boy was found early today, 
Hall said.

son 26 years after war 
By BEN DOBBIN 
Associated Press 
ROCHESTER, N.Y. 
In the 26 years and four days since her son's plane was shot down in Laos during the Vietnam War, Florence DeWis­pelaere says she never cried for her missing son. 
She said she believed that someday, somehow, he would come out alive. She even trav­eled to Southeast Asia in 1971, hoping to find him. 
Now, Mrs. DeWispelaere's tears might flow after all. 
An armed forces review board concluded a month ago that remains excavated in Laos in 1993 were those of DeWis­pelaere and seven fellow air­men who had been listed as missing in action. 
Their remains will be buried today with full military honors

"It'll be sad, of course, but 
it'll be a relief, too," Mrs. 
DeWispelaere said. "I never 
have cried but this will be very 
emotional, I'm afraid so." 
An AC-130 gunship carrying 
the eight airmen was hit by an­
tiaircraft artillery lire and ex­
ploded in names in a forested, 
mountainous region in Laos on 
Nov. 24, 1969. 
Two pilots located the wreck­age the next day but detected no signs of life, no parachutes and no emergency signals. 
DeWispelaere's parents were told about the crash just before Christmas 1969 at their horne in Penn Yan, 50 miles south­east of Rochester. 
"A man came to the door," Mrs. DeWispelaere recalled Monday. "I couldn't under­stand anything, I was so shocked. I went to bed for a few days and then I never talked about it after that. My husband wouldn't let us talk about it. He was more upset than I was." 
ller husband, Peter, who was stricken with Alzheimer's dis­ease for 10 years, died in 1993 never having accepted that his son had been killed. 
The couple and their three other children clung to the hope that DeWispelaere, an Air Force chief master sergeant, might have survived and found refuge with a Vietnamese fam­ily he had befriended. 
"He had sent pictures home of a family and a girl," his mother said. 
DeWispelaere joined the Air Force in 1964 at age 20.

• IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD 
Feelings ofanger and hate shoudn't be confused 
With all the mail and the phone calls I've gotten in the past week or so , two questions keep reaccurring, sometimes subtly but most of the time bluntly. They stand equally on their own, but in pages of my history they have a distinct bond together that is so strong that it can't be ignored, bypassed or forgotten. 
Am I angry? That's the one question and at the same time, an accusation that people keep throwing at me since I first start writing for this heralded newspaper. The answer, it turns out is not an easy one. Easy for me to answer, but, no doubt, not easy for the masses to understand. Am I angry? My first reaction to this ques­tion is, no, I'm not angry, I'm cool. I won't say I'm overjoyed or elated but I'm not 
you have a problem. I'm angry at the devilry of some white people. and that has a lot to do with my history, the history of my people, and the history of the United States which leads to the second question. Why can't you leave the past alone? 
I hear that one a lot. Why can't you leave slavery in the past? No one who enslaved your ancestors is alive. Why do you keep bringing it up?" At this point I have to restrain myself from going off yet again, as anger comes into play. There is one single simple unarguable fact that remains true today as ever did. And I truly believe that if some people would just get this through their thick skulls this country might actually be worth 
something.

I'll say The fact is that although slav­this I'm happy to be alive, I'm ery ended some hundred and happy to have a good family and thirty years ago, the descen­great friends, and I'm happy that I dants of those slaves still feel have a sense of purpose which my the effects of that institution fellow peers probably don't. today.

Cristiane Likely
Anger is a strange thing to us bad enough the resentment of humans, as sometimes it can be the whites toward blacks from self-inflicted but mostly is brought that time til now is almost over­about by outside influences and whelming. An exslave had the 
actions. We get angry when we lock our keys in our cars or when our favorite sports team squanders a commanding lead which brings about a loss. We get angry when it rains or when someone intentionally aggravates us. We get angry at the least important of things, but yet a lot of times we neglect to get angry when we should. Following the Trial of the Century and it's the verdict, we got angry over domes­tic violence, but we didn't get angry about it before we heard the name of Nicole Brown Simpson. I guess that's human nature, faulty at best. 
Am I angry? When it comes to black people, yes, unequivocally I am angry. I'm angry that black people are so duped and misguided. I'm angry that black peo­ple are content with being the menaces of society. I'm angry that we are killing ourselves instead of loving and respecting ourselves. I'm angry that black babies will have to struggle harder in life than we ever had to. I'm angry that the media will never forget to mention that one out of every four black males is either incar­cerated or on his way there, but will never mention the three that aren't the three that are doing the right things. 
I'm angry that it's such a struggle to be young and black in America, yet there isn't anything else I would want to be. But don't be mistaken. Don't confuse anger with hate. There are only two things that I hate, one is dead and the other is green peas. For the record, I don't hate white people. If you cannot accept that, then 
option of either working for his former master, becoming a sharecropper, moving up north, or the far-fetched option of going back to Africa. People foolishly want to praise Lincoln for making the slaves free men and women, but how can free can you be when you couldn't even vote til thirty years ago. 
When regardless of how nonviolent you were, you'd get your butt kicked for looking at a police officer the wrong way. 
Sure, I know I wasn't alive then, but my parents were and it affected me more than most people would like. My parents went to segregated schools had to go to black only restuarants. They had to sit at the back of the bus and be subjected to the superiority complex of the racist white society. My parents followed the law, did the right things, were good citizens, heck, my father even went to Vietnam only to return to the same America that didn't give a crap about his black skin, yet he was willing to die for it. 
This country, and yes even this school has the "me" complex. "If it doesn't affect me, then I don't care" or "As long as they don't offend me then I don't have a problem" or "Don't bother me with your concerns, I have nothing to do with it" or "Keep me out of it." Yeah, and soon as it was directed at you, all hell broke lose. One letter in particular I got from a group of stu­dents who wrote me this very long letter which con­demned me to the likes of Hitler (which is grossly inac­curate because one, I'm down for self-defense, not tyranny, and second, I would never kill my own people) because I called white people devils and I hold white people accountable for their actions, yet, they support the murals on the second floor of the Administration Building. 
This I cannot understand and it is this hypocrisy that makes me question their motives and their beliefs. Like I said, "as long as the murals don't depict me in a slanted, degrading manner then I don't have a prob­lem." C'mon now, don't try to play me. I've heard these same people say multiculturalism is essentially good and serves to inform and better society, but multicul­turalism when it takes on the elist regime it becomes destructive to society. "Multiculturalism is good, just so long as it doesn't make me less important. Just as long as it doesn't make my culture second place." 
This is the overwhelming attitude of the dominant culture toward multiculturalism. "Let the colored peo­ple have their day in the sun just as long as they keep it to themselves." But l shouldn't be surprised, like I said, history has shown us that one can't expect devils to do the right thing, and I've never, ever met a devil I could trust. I've learned my-lesson. Martin Luther King Jr. (before he saw the light) used to say that when the white man slaps you in the face, turn your other cheek, be nonviolent, but Brother Malcolm taught me that it only takes one time for you to learn, and if you've been really fooled then it will take you awhile longer, and then you'll be damned if you'll if you let it happen again. Black people have been punked far too long for me to trust any devil. 
Multiculturalism is not a bad thing, nor is it some kind of stepchild of society. It's about realizing that there are other cultures out there worthy of celebrat­ing and recognizing. It's not about informing white people and making them more comfortable with people of color. It's about people of color exerting their free­dom to celebrate their cultures freely so that everyone can take part, but people get scared and feel threat­ened and act like babies and whine about how multi­culturalism is good, just so long as it stays in it's place. So I ask you, why do we have to do the work? Why should we have to be the better person? Why do we have to shoulder the burden of the fears and preju­dices of white people? Why should we be the objects of white peoples frustrations and insecurities, and then then then the objects of your condenscation? How about we be the selfish self-centered ones. Even better, let's take it back in time, how about we have white people go through what we had to go through? Like Sistah Souljah said, it may not be right, but it sure makes it even.

• LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Columnist urged to change tone and help solve racial problems 
I
Dear Editor: n every one of Likely's articles, she has expressed a hatred which she feels for Caucasians, while trying to disguise it and pretend that she is not racist. True to form, she has come through again with a deliberately racist attack, which was supposedly intended to be a criticism of Kelly's viewpoint. but in reality was a vehi­cle for her blatant stereotyping of white people. 
In this particular instance, she arrives at this con­elusion; "It is perfectly obvious, it is common sense, it is self-evident that a race of recessive homozygous mutants [or white people) are nothing more than dev­ils!" 
In allempting to prove this argument, that each white person is "an extremely and malignantly wicked person; the supreme spirit of evil," Likely relies on bla­tantly racist quotes and the same kind of sweeping gmwralizations of which she accuses Kelly, and the result is that she presents no real rational basis for this wild aeeusation. 
One such quote is as follows: 
M
'"White Americans are our natural enemies. By treating us so cruel we see them acting more like dev­ils than aeeountable men. Whites have always been an unjust. jealous. unmerciful, avaricious, and blood­thirsty set of beings. always seeking out power and authority' -David Walker." s. Likely treats this radically extremist hatred as undeniable truth, which makes her eventual dis­elaimer, "I know there are good white people" ring ex­tremely hollow. 
Clearly. she does m)t believe that this is true, for, aecording to this philosophy that she supports, they arr, allr,vil, always unjust, avaricious. and bloodthirsty, a harsh judgment millions of people of whom she knows nothing. 
It should be obvious that there is a great deal of misunderstanding and strong emotions involved in these claims. However, instead of replying in kind and erpetuating the eyele of hate, which characterizes much of the race relations today, I believe that we should seek some sort of understanding and resolution. 
Political eorrectness demands adherence to a double 
standard which dictates that, because Likely is in the 
racial minority in the United States. she is allowed to 
vent whatever hate-filled sentiments she likes, but if I 
were to prnaeh the same prejudice which Likely cham­
pions, I would be labeled racist. 
This is corn!ct in forbidding me to be racist, but the standard should apply equally to both of us. Experiencing prejudice is not something unique to the black person's experience. White male (or devil) that I am. I have also been labeled and persecuted because of the color of my skin. 
Many times I have been accosted, mocked, and 
threatmwd for innoermtly glancing at people of another 
ractL I have often bmm afraid to walk down the streets 
by my home for fear I would be ridiculed and even physically harmed because my skin is white. 
This fear is not mere delusion or prejudice on my part, but t e result of actual experience. To add insult to injury, I have also been stereotyped by people I do not know. In fact, recently I was called a "devil" by someone whom I have never wronged. 
Obviously, there is no justice in that; however, it gives me no right to hate those who have wronged me. 
We have all experienced racism, but it will never be justified for any of us to strike out blindly for revenge, especially when that vengeance involves judging those of whom we know nothing. 
T
It saddens me that Likely desires to be segregated so that she does not have to meet me. It saddens me that in her articles, she refers to O.J. Simpson, a known wife-beater, as her brother, while she calls me, a sim­ple college student, a devil out to harm her. It saddens me that many people of all races feel the way she does, and that many people are motivated to strike out against people because of their skin color. hese are not expressions of the brotherhood and 
love that Christ envisioned. 
We are all human, and humans make mistakes. I know that some people have generalized all black peo­ple, and other races have been stereotyped as well. for example, the stereotype of all Native Americans as sav­ages. 
Likely is right in criticizing Kelly for grouping many people into a single category; however, in the words of Jesus, "Why look at the speck in your brother's eye when you miss the plank in your own?" (Matthew 7:03) 
This implies two things. First and most importantly, it says Kelly is her brother, as am I, for we are all of one race. the human race. Secondly, it calls her method into question; how can she possibly be justified in convicting Kelly of making sweeping generalizations by making sweeping generalizations of her own? If it is wrong for Kelly to do so, then it is wrong for Likely. 
"Truth is truth, and facts are facts ... ," she says, "It is not hard for me to understand that the last thing I need to do is to criticize someone for doing something I openly practice"-then she proceeds to do just that. 
She criticizes people who judge others by the color of their skin, while she judges others by the color of their skin. Where is the rationality in that? "Pot. Kettle. Black." Likely's own words apply. 
I do not think that she believes that her sentiments are racist; however, they truly are offensive and demeaning. and are therefore wrong. Setting two quotes of hers against each other shows the confusion in her mind that she does not recognize: "It is the white man...who stands accountable for the perils of the world" and "black people need to stand ac­countable for themselves." 
Which of these diametrically opposed sentences does she believe? This sort of contradiction prevails throughout; she attacks millions of people, olaiming that, in their very nature, white people are evil, while at the same time claiming that she doesn't believe that they are all evil. She spends the majority of the space in her articles supporting the first statement. therefore the rational conclusion is that the first statement is what she truly believes. 

C
With her apparent confusion, I havJl difficulty believ­ing her disclaimer, "please try to understand that I don't hate white people." oncerning this "lack of hate" for white people, she says, "I have the right to [hate]. but I don't." Morally, we never have the right to do wrong, and ha­tred is blatantly wrong. Jesus said, "Love your ene­mies, do good to those who hate you; bless those who curse you and pray for those who maltreat you." (Luke 6:27-28) 
Surely this is a difficult challenge, but if we all would do our best to practice it, less hatred would exist. 
Racism does exist,-and it is wrong. So how do we go about changing this? The solution flows from the above quote. The change must start with individuals, on a personal basis. Each person must stop talking about the ambiguous "they," pointing fingers at faceless groups; he or she must focus first on his or herself and then primarily on the people and situations with whom he or she comes into contact. 
In this way, each person works at a realistic level to eliminate racism; instead of trying to find places to put blame. It takes a positive effort; someone who is unable to think of his or herself as anything other than a victim will never be anything but a victim. 
When we get rid of this stereotyping, the name-call­ing, and the generalizing, and when each and every person considers that he or she has the opportunity to better the individual situations which he or she touch­es, we stop looking for others to blame and accept responsibility for our actions. We open our minds, we educate others, and most importantly we forgive. 
T
I realize that Likely is trying to open minds and try­ing to educate, but until she can forgive and until she can eliminate prejudice from herself, she will only make the problem worse. herefore, I ask Likely, as well as all others, to search herself, as she says, "take a good look in the mirror," and deal with the negative emotions that are clouding her judgment, so that she and I and every person can go about actually fixing this problem. deal­ing with it case by case as it affects each one of us per­sonally. 
I ask that she not write articles about the problem of race relations until she is ready to stop adding to the problem and ready to become a part of the solution. 
JEFF NICHOLS Freshman St. Edward's Hall 

No one possesses 
the right to hate 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing this letter to address Christiane Likely's infernal and hate-ridden column that appeared November 15. 
Let us stop this racial comparison of violence and hate. I cannot and will not argue with history. All I can do as a white individual born in the late 20th cen­tury is know that I have never willingly committed an act of "white savagery" and hope that I nevor will, not for Likely's sake but for the sake of my own humanity. 
Likely's column commits nothing less than the worst kind of savagery when she paints the world-wide Caucasian population as "homozygous mutants noth­ing more than devils" and "best described as destruc­tive, evil, deadly, greedy". 
More than this. however, is the outrageous and con­temptible claim by Likely that sh(~ has th(~ right to hate. Hate is not a thing to be claimed, it is an emo­tional response triggered by abnormal, maddening. and evil events. Likely has certainly negated pnrt of her claim to her own humanity by suggesting other­
wise. 
By Likely's own logic, I can now "claim my right to hate" her because of the vonomous and unjustified things she has indicted me of because of my racial 
identity. 
Christiane, I do not claim to understand what living as an American minority is like. but I do understand that divisive and crazed rhetoric like yours does not help move us to a more ideal situation. In my mind, your cause would be much better served if you devot­ed your column inches to education rather than con­
demnation.

L
ooking for a good laugh? Irish Accent shall serve as your waiter tonight in providing you with a hearty dose of hilarious comedy and entertainment all developed under a simple con­cept: "Take time to laugh-it is the music of the soul." 
Irish Accent is a comedy and improvisational group 01;1 campus which has been charming audi­ences for the past ten years. By playing on subject matter gathered from the audience and developing original skits based on the sketch comedy of Saturday Night Live and The Kids In The Hall, Irish Accent truly serves as one of Notre Dame's finest providers of wholesome pleasure. 
The group is very theatre-oriented in its produc­tion, but welcomes students of all backgrounds and experiences to join in the fun. 
Each semester the group peforms two shows in the LaFortune Ballroom. Often, the improvisational portion of the program depends strictly on the audi­ence. The emotions and pet peeves of the audience members are just two of the many examples these talented individuals use as material for their shows. 
The ability to perform enjoyable on-the-spot com­edy is not an easy task, but with the talent of each individual, the show progresses with the greatest of ease. The audience receives a healthy measure of unique fun at their own expense, but the jokes are always certain to make even the subject of the com­ical expedition laugh with the best of them. 
In addition to the improv segment of the show, the group performs several skits devised and writ­ten by the Irish Accent members. Ranging from the reunion of the entire cast of Scooby Doo (and Scrappy too!) on the Ricki Lake Show to the ever­dreaded war between the men of Reservoir Dogs and the dining hall staff (a messy battle ending in a compelling knife scene minus the knives, but plus the salad dressing ladles), the ingenuity and origi­nality of this inventive group shine through. Sketch comedy of such popular shows as Saturday Night Live receives a fresh twist through the innovative enthusiasm of the Irish Accent members. 

Perhaps the entire attitude of each person in the group can be summarized by co-president Willie Lajoie, "It's a lot of fun. I wouldn't miss it for the world. "The comedy of Irish Accent, in addition to the elements of originality it promotes, also pro­vides the audience with elements of diversity. Each person in the audience is sure to find something amusing during the show accounting for the wide­spread appeal Irish Accent creates. With the improv segment, the audience and actors alike are both greeted with the element of surprise, while the skit comedy provides three distinct types of enjoyment, performing for the actors, laughter for the audi­ence, and, of course, just a great time had by all. 
Although the group currently has its share of 
comedians and clowns alike, open auditions are 
held each year. Anyone interested is strongly 
encouraged and urged to try out as new talent and 
ideas are always welcomed by the group. No the­
atre background nor experience is necessary, just 
those enthusiastic about comedy and desiring the 
need to provide his/her fellow students with cre­
ative, boisterously entertaining humor. 
Irish Accent is clearly a student organization that 
will continue to thrive on the Notre Dame campus, 
after all, "A smile costs nothing but gives much. It 
enriches those who receive, without making poorer 
those who give. It takes but a moment, but the 
memory of it sometimes lasts forever."

If you think there is nothing fun to do on campus this week, you haven't discovered HA. HA, or Humor Artists, is a campus sketch comedy group that performs at least two to three times a semester. 
They write and perform all of the material which they present, so the comedy can parody current national and campus events. 
The group was founded last year by several ND students and is sponsored by the Creative Writing Department. Headed by one of the founders, Mark Marino, HA currently consists of 14 people, ranging from ND graduate students to undergrads at both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. 
The number of members continually fluctuates in HA because they are constantly open to accepting new mem­bers. · 
Wednesday, November 29, 1995 

The group performed their welcome back show in early October of this year in Cushing Auditorium. They featured sev­eral shorter sketches between episodes of a longer piece fol­lowing the trials and tribulations of the first male to enter SMC. Finally, HA capped ofT the perfo­mance with a screening of Rudy in which they redubbed new dialogue over the original script. 
They have two performances this week. One will be Washington Hall tonight at 9:30, and the other will be the Library Auditorium on Friday, December 1 at 8:00. Both will contain new and original pieces written by the members themselves. 
The performances promise to be entertaining. While the shows will be similar, the second show on Friday is sup­posed to contain more stand-up comedy, so you can attend Wednesday, November 29, 1995

both shows and see new materi­al each night. 
One of the sketches to be per­formed is called Holy Oil and is a parody of Grease. In the new and improved version, the stars are nuns and priests and the story runs along religious 

themes. 1 to be sung include "Go Priest Lightning" and a Loving" based on Thomas of Aquinas' Summa 
~ca. 
1er sketeh will feature a continuation of last year's tape worm series. In the new story, Tapey von 1arrios Bob Boborberg, and they spawn a new gen­
ol' tape worm singers: the family von Tape. e is also a skit ealled "Power Hectors" in which the of Notre Dame such as Hector O'Hare and Rector 
' light hard to preserve the morals put forth in du Lac. In their battles with violators, the new "Power Hectors" mimick the "Power Rangers" with their brilliant Kung Fu moves and weapons of chastity. 
At the performances this week, HA will be accepting donations and members to the club. The group is continu­ally working to boost their membership as well as trying to raise money in order to attend a national comedy festival in Arizona in April. 
If you have any questions regarding the group, inquiries can be made to Mark Marino. 
The performances tonight at 9:30 in Washington Hall and Friday at 8:00 in the Library Auditorium promise to be fun, entertaining, and full of great music. 
They feature sketches, stand up, confessionals, and much more. The members of HA have worked hard to bring the Notre Dame audience a brand of humor which is in touch with the NO community. There is no doubt that, when you leave, you'll be laughing, you'll be crying, and you'll be singing.

T
he Notre Dame Student Players have set them­selves apart from other theatrical troupes by not only bringing a number of unconventional productions to campus, but by providing services to other organizations at Notre Dame. 
The Notre Dame Student Players, composed of approximately seventy-five members, are surpris­ingly diverse in their interests and pursuits. Not all of its members are Communication and Theatre majors, or even Arts and Letters students. Rather, the organization boasts representatives from a vari­ety of majors and disciplines. 
According to senior co-president Kay Zolkowski, the Notre Dame Student Players help to raise funds for other groups' activities. 
The Halloween production earlier this semester was integral to the Players' fundraising efforts. "We needed the funds to help out with other pro­jects," ZaJkowski said. But the group offers more than just financial assistance to other campus or­ganizations. . 
Anyone wishing to stage a musical or a dramatic play can approach the Student Players to ask for assistance in securing a location and hosting audi­tions. The Student Players can then assist with not only funding, but publicity and acting as well. 
The Notre Dame Student Players are rebuilding now after a short respite. Despite some difficulties in the beginning of the year, ZaJkowski says that they are ready to expand. They are currently look­ing for new members to increase their numbers and visibility. 
Last year then-president Steve Susco directed a David Mamet play which was quite successful. He has since gone on to film school at U.S.C. 
The group has plans for several upcoming pro­ductions, including a play directed by sophomore Scott Paradine to be shown at Washington Hall sometime next semester. 
Zolkowski also said the Players are hoping to organize a production to coincide with AnTostal fes­tivities. 
Since the theatre department sponsors and pro­duces the larger plays, the Players are able to con­centrate on smaller productions which require less of a time commitment. 
Even an engineering major with an interest in theater could probably make the time to join in the action. 
Eventually Zolkowski says that they would like to be able to perform twice a year on the mainstage, but Washington Hall is very difficult to rent beeause of the numerous events that are held there. But it still remains the ideal site for Notre Dame Student Players productions. As ZaJkowski puts it, "The theater is magical." 
The Student Players have groups for publicity, costumes, props, backstage, and the most popular, acting. 
While everyone is certainly welcome and encour­aged to join and participate, the Student Players are especially looking for anyone who can direct and manage the productions. 
If anyone is interested in joining the Notre Dame Student Players or has an inclination to put on a play of their own the people to contact are the co­presidents, Kay Zolkowski (634-3690) and Michael O'Hara (273-6183). 
The Notre Dame Student Players occupy an inte­gral role in campus theatrical performances. As long as the Players is around drama will be alive and well at Notre Dame.

Accosting Phanatic: verdict stunk 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA 
The Phillie Phanatic, the wild, cartoon-like mascot who entertains Philadelphia base­ball fans, has cost the Phillies $128,000. 
The big green character knocked down a 68-year-old man at a 1991 church car­nival, and a Common Pleas Court jury awarded Carl G. Seidel $100,000 in compen­satory damages Monday. The jury awarded Seidel's wife $28,000 for the loss of his companionship. 
The Philadelphia Phillies baseball team, which owns the rights to the Phanatic, was ordered to pay the settle­
ment. 
Seidel, now 72, a retired bus driver, called the award "peanuts." He had asked for at least $525,000 and claimed that the Phanatic committed assault and battery. 
"I think the verdict stunk," Seidel said. "I think the whole thing stunk. I don't think the jury took into consideration the pain and suffering I have been going through. I have pain all the time. I can't sleep at night. My bills are more than they alloted me." 
Seidel's lawyers said their client was talking with a group of men at the carnival when the tall, bulbous mascot hugged him aggressively, then hit him with either his belly or his nose, knocking him over. 

Seidel said the fall ag­gravated a previous back in­jury, leaving him barely able to walk. 
William Keffer, who was portraying the Phanatic at the event, said he could not remember bumping into Sei­del. 
The jury rejected Seidel's allegation of assault and bat­tery, but found Keffer had been negligent. 
Martin J. King Jr., Seidel's lawyer, waived the part of the trial that could have led to punitive damages. In ex­
change, the Phillies agreed not to appeal the verdict. 
The settlement was recom­mended by Judge Albert W. Sheppard Jr., who presided at the trial. 
King said the verdict was unusual. 
"I don't know of any profes­sional sports team that has been found liable for negli­gence for the conduct of one of their mascots," he said. 
Seidel remained unim­pressed. 
"I just expected more out of it than I got," he said. "Everybody says I won the case. No, I lost it." 
Bowl bid on line in SWC final 
By CHIP BROWN 
Associated Press Writer 

AUSTIN, Texas Texas and Texas A&M actual­ly agree on something. 
The two rivals concur that Saturday's showdown in College Station for the 81st and final Southwest Conference title is an appropriate conclusion to the league. 
"I just think it's fitting for these two schools that are tied so closely to each other -so different, but so similar," Texas A&M coach R.C. Slocum said Monday at his weekly news conference. ''I'm delighted that both teams have good records." 
The 16th-ranked Aggies are 8-2 overall, 5-1 in conference play. To gain a share of the final SWC title, they'll have to 
get through the best Texas (9­1-1, 6-0) team since 1990. The Longhorns are ranked No.9. 
"It wouldn't be as meaningful if one or the other didn't have a good team," Slocum said. "It just wouldn't be fair to the legacy of the conference. I anticipate a great game and I think that's fitting with the games that this conference has seen over the years." 
The winner of Saturday's game will go to either the Orange or Sugar bowl. The loser will go to the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio Dec. 28 against Michigan. 
"This is how it's supposed to be," said Texas senior defen­sive tackle Shane Rink. "If the forefathers of the conference would have drawn it up, they would have drawn it up this way." 
But the rivalry -still one of the fiercest in the nation and one that will be preserved when the schools join the Big 12 next year -has become pretty one-sided. Color it crim­son as A&M has won 10 of the last 11 meetings, including four straight. 
"Those games have been hard fought and could have gone either way," Slocum said. ''I'd say we've been fortunate as much as anything else." 
For generations, the SWC race has been decided by the winner of this game, which for many years was played on 
Thanksgiving. 
It didn't determine the conferenc.e race last year because the Aggies were on probation. They still won 34­10. 
The Aggies have the nation's longest home winning streak at 31. 
"When you go to Kyle Field, they pretty much have a 7-0 lead before you start because their fans never sit down and they never shut up," Texas linebacker Tyson King said. "That's what makes their fans so good. To think they haven't lost there in 31 games is great motivation for us to stop that streak." 
Texas coach John Mackovic said sophomore quarterback James Brown will be back at practice on Tuesday and likely will start on Saturday. 
"He's feeling better," Mackovic said. "We will just have to take it on a day-to-day basis with an eye on his being able to play. If James can go out and move around on Tuesday, we will build our offensive scheme for him." 
Brown, a sophomore who is 12-1-1 as a starter, sprained his left ankle on Nov. 18 in a 27-19 victory against Texas Christian. 
Although he missed the Longhorns' Thanksgiving night triumph over Baylor, he still leads the SWC in passing effi­ciency and total offense.

more relaxed and prepared." 
North Carolina has been there before, winning 13 national titles in 16 years. Their latest title was captured during the Tar Heel's 5-0 rout of the Irish in the champi­onship game. 
North Carolina's renowned experience has often translat­ed into intimidation. 
"I honestly think that a lot of people see the blue jerseys with Carolina on the front and say we can't beat them because of who they are," Scharff noted. 
This mentality is not affecting 
page 15 
the Irish this year, however. 
"I don't think that way because I've played against them four times in my career now," Scharff continued. "I know what they can do, I know what they have, and I know that a lot of' what's intimidat­ing is just the fact that they're Carolina." 
"Last year they had better players," Guerrero said. "They graduated most of their midfield. This year, I know they're definitely heatable. I mean we're going to do it." 
''I'm not terrified, I'm excit­ed," Scharff added. "We have really nothing to be scared of because we have nothing to lose."

last year's championship game. Until that point, the .,. Irish had not lost, only tying North Carolina in the regular season. 
For this feat, Notre Dame was awarded the top spot in the polls heading into the tourna­ment. 
"We're completely the under­dog going into this thing which logistically we weren't last year because we were ranked above them," Scharff said. "That's a positive thing we got going for us." 
"One of the big differences last year was we were unde­feated and were suppose to be the team that won," head coach Chris Petrucelli recalled. "They have all the pressure on them now. Playing at home may be more of a negative for them. Everyone expects them to win. They're dealing with the high expectations this year. 
"We don't have the pressure we had on us last year. We're going into this thing as the only team that is not undefeat­ed. We're No. 4. We're no good, you know. That's kind of the attitude that's out there." 
In addition to lack of pres­sure, defense constitutes yet another difference. 
"We're a lot better defensive­ly as a team right now than we were last year at this time," Petrucelli added. 
Combining these differences adds up to a different fate against North Carolina in the national semifinal. This time around confidence is abound­ing on the team. 
"We believe we can win this year," McCarthy said. "I don't know what the feeling was last year." 
"I think that since I've been here, each year has been a stepping stone," co-captain Cindy Daws said. "Last year we were just happy to make it to the finals. Now, the next step is to win a national cham­pionship and I think that it's 
• 
obvious on our team that everyone has that go get 'em attitude." 
Prime time: Notre Dame's na­tional semifinal game with North Carolina will be tele­vised live at 5:00 p.m., November 30 by Sportschannel Chicago. Should the Irish advance to the national championship game, Sportschannel Chicago is also slated to broadcast that game live at 1:30 p.m.

keep working on it." 
The second half did not start any better. The Scarlet Knights opened up with a 10-5 run before the Irish called a timeout with 14:50 left in the game. As Gaither began to take charge. Notre Dame rebuilt the lead back to 50-38 and Rutgers was now forced to call a timeout at the 7:38 mark. 
Rutgers came out of the time­out. apparently with some sort of revelation. Their use of a full­court press produced easy shots at the other end, especially for freshman post Kylie Martin who finished with a team-high 19 points. This sparked them to a 16-6 run. making the score 56­54. 

As they will need to do consis-r.================================il 
tently throughout the year, vet­

erans Gaither and Morgan stepped up their performances in the clutch. Gaither pounded the inexperienced Scarlet Knight frontcourt, and finished with game-highs of 24 points and 14 rebounds. Morgan displayed her feathery touch down the stretch by hitting seven free throws and a short jumper in the last three minutes. She ended up with 19 points and grabbed 10 rebounds. 
Just as big as the clutch play of the veterans was the ag­gressive defense of the young guards. Peirick and McMillen hawked star Rutgers guard Liz Hanson all night. Being the cat­alyst of the offense. Hanson could not get on track. She fouled out with only five points. 
As a result. the Scarlet Knight offense sputtered during crunch time. 
"Our first Big East win feels real good," said Peirick. "Now we start concentrating on Penn State. We know Rutgers beat them, and we feel confident we can too. We really, really want Penn State."

be an early season benchmark for Notre Dame's prowess before the conference games began. The Irish can only hope that wasn't the case. 
The Big East is known for its tight defense and aggressive inside play. That's exactly what the Irish got from the Hoosiers, and their response was inadequate. 
"We were competitive, we were just not ready for this tonight," said MacLeod. "Their defense took our offense right 
out of sync, and we  weren't  
able  to  keep  them  off the  
glass."  

The difference in the defenses was the most notable indicator that this was destined to be a long night for the Irish. 
MacLeod and Knight are two coaches who eat, sleep, and breathe man-to-man. The chances that either will play zone are about as remote as that of the two switching wardrobes. 
Knight's defense is unparal­leled in college basketball, and the Irish never responded. 
"They played a switching de­fense, and we never adjusted," explained junior forward Pat Garrity, last year's leading scorer who was limited to four points by the Hoosier. "They just shut us down. We weren't

running our stuff when they were putting pressure on us." 
The Indiana players switch, but they switch with tenacity. Notre Dame's guards were run­ning the show from near the halfcourt line, while Indiana's backcourt could set the offense around the three point arc. 
The results were a pre­dictable 48-24 Hoosier advan­tage in frontline scoring. Those deficits will not translate into very many Big East wins for the Irish. 
To compensate, the Irish tried to slow the Hoosiers inside by double-teaming the ball when­ever it went to the post, a tactic that Indiana's jump shooters came to relish, as they knocked down crucial perimeter jump­shots in the first half. 
Shooting guard Sherron Wilkerson led the way, finding

his shooting touch to the tune of 14 points. 
Notre Dame's backcourt could not answer, as the Irish endured a five minute scoring draught in the first half. 
The inside play was not much better, as Notre Dame was out­rebounded 47-40. 
"We just got manhandled," stated forward Gary Bell, who managed six boards for the Irish. "They were bigger and stronger than us." 
"We have a great deal of room for improvement," admit­ted MacLeod. "We were pushed around out there." 
The upside of being in a conference is that debacles such as this can be overcome without too much permanent damage. The downside is that in the Big East, they can't be repeated.

Irish 
continued from page 24 
A combination of Indiana enthusiasm and youthful inexperience Jed to a nightmarish first half for Notre Dame, as the Irish shot a woeful 21% from the noor, and only Keith Kurowski's two thme-pointers prevented the Irish from muling the half in single digits. 
The second half shooting improved slightly. but was only cosmetic surgery to repair the carnage of the first. Against a swarming man-to-man defense, the Irish committed 17 turnovers and were unable to convert what few open looks they did have. 
"We got good shots, but we have to knock them down, execute, and run our offense," said senior guard Ryan Hoover. a catalyst in last season's Irish upset who was held to two points by the 1995 Hoosiers. "When you shoot twenty-some percent, you're not going to win many games. it's as simple as that." 
Instead it was Indiana which took advantage of its intricate offense to find good looks at the basket. Four Hoosiers finished in double-figures, including senior Brian Evans, who overcame a slow start to register 13 points and 14 boards. 
"Our two freshman (Wyche and for­ward Gary Bell) who guarded Brian Evans will remember this night for a long time," said MacLeod. "lie taught them how to move without the ball." 
Indeed, as the Hoosiers began to pile on points in the second half, MacLeod went with his 'Glimpse of the Future' lineup, putting all four scholarship freshman on the floor. 
The result was one of the few bright spots for the Irish. 
After Antoni Wyche's strong perfor­mance against Akron, two fellow fresh­men stepped up with strong games. 
Point guard Doug Gottlieb, who logged the most minutes of any Irish player. showcased his passing skills, and exhibited pre-mature court leader­ship for only his second collegiate game. 
"Me and Admore (fellow point guard White) need to be leaders out there," commented Gottlieb. "It doesn't matter what year you are." 
Particularly effective was the tandem of Gottlieb and Bell. One of the few players able to break down the lloosier defense off the dribble, Gottlieb found Bell on sharp cuts to the basket for six of his team-high 10 points. 
"It was a learning experience for me," noted Bell. "I'm just trying to build up a foundation for bigger and better things." 
Those bigger and better things need to come soon for the Irish, who will experience the rigors of the Big East this weekend when they travel to Rutgers.

Massachusetts improved to 3­0 against top-ranked teams. It beat North Carolina 91-86 in overtime in the semifinals of the Preseason NIT. 
Massachusetts used one of Kentucky's favorite tactics. the full-court press, to open an 18­point lead midway through the first half. But the Wildcats, get­ting two 3-pointers by Tony Delk and one each from Allen Edwards and Walter McCarty, battled back for a 45-45 half­time tie. 
The Minutemen opened the second half with an 11-1 run and led the rest of the way. Two of the points in that open­ing burst came on free throws by Edgar Padilla after Kentucky coach Rick Pitino was hit with a technical foul.

Barnett hopes to implement rosy outlook for 'Cats 
ByRICKGANO 
Associated Press 
EVANSTON, Ill. 

Gary Barnett plans to impart the wisdom he gathered as an assistant coach at Colorado to a Northwestern team that is going to the Rose Bowl. 
The trip will be yet another new experience for the Wildcats in this remarkable season of firsts. 
"It's extraordinary for our guys. What a lot of college guys don't realize going to their first bowl game is that there is a lot of work involved as well," Barnett said. 
Barnett was with one Colorado team that went to Mi­ami for the Orange Bowl and had a great time, hitting the night life and the beaches with­out a curfew. The Buffaloes lost the game. 
The next season with virtually the same team, Colorado won the Orange Bowl and claimed the national championship. 
The difference? 
"They didn't go out, and the game meant more to them at that point than being at the Orange Bowl," Barnett said. "That's what we have to guard against here, winning the game has to be more important than

being somewhere warm and having a new atmosphere and different things to do." 
Senior offensive tackle Justin Chabot already knows what the priorities are, especially after a season in which Northwestern surprised everyone with its tough approach, both physically and mentally. 
"I think everybody realizes the importance of the game and that it doesn't mean anything really if you don't win," Chabot said. 
Not that the Wildcats can't have some fun in the weeks leading up to the New Year's 
The school's switchboard was so swamped with calls it was nearly impossible to get through as fans searched for tickets. Barnett was still trying to shore up practice facilities for the Wildcats once they arrived in California, and tapes of Southern California arrived and were awaiting a meticulous breakdown. Players were be­ginning to prepare for final ex­ams. 
"There are so many things you have to keep doing," Barnett said. "There's always another task when you finish one." 
The Wildcats won't be a secret when they arrive for the game, says one Wildcats player who hails from the area. Defensive end Casey Dailey went home to Covina, Calif., for Thanksgiving and even watched the Ohio State-Michi­gan game with some friends who play for Southern Cal. 
Dailey said a couple of Southern California players he talked with were glad North­western got the nod.

Following opening victory, Belles fall flat after break 
By NICOLE BORDA Sports Writer 
With last year's 6-16 record still lingering, the Saint Mary's basketball team looked to erase that memory by winning their first regular season game against Anderson College last week. The Belles dominated the game, giving them an impressive 62-37 win. 
The Belles shot 41 percent on the night. Strong defense caused some problems for An­derson as they committed sev­eral turnovers, while the Belles turned the ball over only 10 times. At the end of the first half the Belles were already up 30-15 and it didn't stop there. Saint Mary's continued to domi­nate picking up 32 second half points while Anderson was held to 17 points. 
Freshman Sheila Sandine led the team in scoring with 16 points. She was followed by sophomore Julie McGill with 12 points who also led the team in steals tallying 5 on the night. Junior Marianne Banko also succeeded in scoring in double digits with 10 points. 
Another outstanding fresh­man, Nicole Giffin, added four assists and senior Barbara Howells pulled down 8 re­bounds. 
"Anderson was a big win for 
us," said Banko. "It was a 
great boost for our morale." 
"I was greatly impressed with 
how they played," coach 
Marvin Wood added. "This was

year. Our defense was so strong." 
Saint Mary's second regular season game took place on Sunday as the Belles suffered their first loss at home to Beloit. 

"We didn't practice for four days over Thanksgiving. It was hard for us to get back into it since we only had a short prac­tice on Saturday," said senior Jennie Taubenheim. "We seemed really out of shape." 
The Belles held their own in the first half by keeping them­selves in it with a 47-32 half­time score. However, Saint Mary's could only find 10 points in the second half and Beloit pulled away to give them an 89-42 win. 
"I think we were still on vaca­tion," said Wood. "They really showed us what we needed to work on. Their team was big and good. We simply didn't show up to play. Having those four days of practice would have helped." 
This weekend the Belles are playing in the Round Ball Classic which consists of four teams.

Irish romp over Rutgers in Big East opener 
By TIM MCCONN Sports Writer 

Last night was a historic mo­ment. The Notre Dame wom­en's basketball team played its first ever Big East conference game. Even more historic was the fact that they defeated the Scarlet Knights of Rutgers by the score of 66-54 in front of the home crowd at the JACC. 
By joining this historically powerful conference, Notre Dame knew that the level of their competition could only rise by several notches. The Irish professed to be up for the chal­lenge, but the opening minutes seemed ridiculous. 
Junior Beth Morgan and freshman sensation Sheila McMillen each hit a three point­er to start off the game 6-0. This long-range deftnAss, cou­pled with a scrambling defense, keyed a Notre Dame run that enabled them to jump out to a 22-7 lead at the 7:52 mark.
