Draft comes under fire 
·THE WORLD TODAY 
Last night, in the Law Audi­torium, Margory Cavils, Rod Skeist, and Mike Presser, three members of the Chicago Area Draft Resistance, gave their views concerning draft resistance and the benefits of draft coun­seling. Brian Mcinerny, a Draft Counselor on campus presented the speakers. 
Mcinerny initiated the dis­cussion by passing out a state­ment which is to appear in the Scholastic in early May. This statement will make public the fact that students on campus feel that as long as the Vietnam War is in progress, that they would not serve in the U.S. Army. 
After receving signatures for the statement, the discussion be­gan. Skeist related the reasons why he decided to help the draft resistance movement. "The draft prevented me from venturing into the world and forced me to stay in 1College. The draft forces persons to m~ke lifetime de­cisions before they should have to. 
"The dratt laws are unfair to those who cannot afford to go to College, so by having the rich show their disapproval by giving up these privileges, the draft is being challenged effectively. 
"I then decided to actively participate in this resistance be­cause I felt that the action I took would have a direct effect on the draft itself, and this gave me the opportunity to get poli­tically involved." 
Skeist also discussed the alter­natives that lie open to a person who is faced with induction.

Northern Ireland's premier resigns 
BELFAST, (UPI)-Premier Terrence O'Neill resigned yesterday as leader of the governing Unionist party, bowing to opponents of his civil rights concessions to Northern Ireland's Roman Catholic minority. 
O'Neill, 54, said he also would resign as premier when a new party chief is chosen. 
Militant leaders of Irish Protestants, who outnumber Catholics 2 to 1 in this nation of 1.5 million, accused O'Neill of being soft on Catholics in acceding to their demands for equal voting rights and other civil rights. 
O'Neill last week won Unionist party approval in principle for his plan to extend the vote equally to all citizens. Only property owners currently have the right to vote in Northern Ireland, their number of votes determined by the property valuation. Since Catholics consti­tute most of the poor, their numerical minority is even more sharply 
reflected at the polls. 

Problems followdeGaulle's resignation 
PARIS (UPI) -Charles de Gaulle's resignation yesterday brought hints of the dire consequences he had predicted. The franc tumbled in value and the interim president appealed for "scrupulous respect for the law" in the coming political power struggle. 
Alain Poher, who automatically became acting president by virtue of his office as French Seante president, addressed a generally somber and quiet France on television. Beginning exactly as De Gaulle always did with the salutation, Frenchwomen, Frenchmen!," he implored them: 
"Over and above the divergencies brought out by Sunday's vote, you will feel deeply, as I do, I am sure, that we must first of all, all of us, presserve the unity of the nation. 
"We will achieve this by scrupulous respect for the law, which is incumbent upon the interim president, the government which remains in office, the elected assemblies and all Frenchmen ... 
Japanese students stage anti-US riots 
TOKYO (UPI) Radical students demanding the immediate end to U.S. control over Okinawa attacked Prime Minister Eisaku Sato's home, invaded an American military compound and turned Tokyo's glittering Ginza district into a battleground yesterday. 
Hundreds of students, police and bystanders were injured during 
the anti-American and antigovernment riots in the world's largest 
city. Police reported 5 68 students were arrested. 
The students, members of the extreme leftist Zengakuren, battled 12,000 riot police with stones, steel pipes, baseball bats and Molotov cocktails. Police fought back with clubs, tear gas and high pressure water cannon. 
There was sporadic fighting during the afternoon, including the attack on the residence of Sato, who escaped injury although rioters broke windows, and on the American compound where rioters hung an anti-American banner. 
Prosecution of Pueblo crew unlikely 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Although the skipper and crew of the Pueblo "appeared" to break the prohibitions in the armed forces' code of conduct, prsecution of them is unlikely, two top Navy officers indicated yesterday. 
After hearing testimony from Vice Adm. Charles K. Duncan, chief 
of naval personnel, and Rear Adm. Joseph B. McDevitt, Navy judge 
advocate general, Rep. Otis G. Pike concluded that prosecution of 
the sailors for the confessions they signed and broadcast would be 
ruled out. 

"The Navy has made the decision not to prosecute them for 
technical violations of the code," Pike told newsmen at the 
conclusion of Monday's session of his House armed forces 
subcommittee's hearing into the Pueblo episode. 
Duncan was not that specific in his testimony.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
"We arc human beings too!!" 
hlitor: 
In reference to the letter en­titlell "Imaginary vs Real" in your April 17 issue, I would just like to offer a word of en­couragement to its author: Yes, I I too am a "homosexual" (whatever that "shocking" term might adually mean). I think I understand what you mean by your feelings of "fear"-· -"fear of the attitude of hate and scorn which has been so assiduously trained into your typical lonely, helpless Notre Dame man." I know what that fear is. I know what hell it is sometimes to live that so called "double life." I have known this "double life" here and in high school for over four years now from the age of 16. I know how it feels to need someone to talk to; some­one who would understand and maybe care. I have found none of that here at Notre Dame. 

know many homosexuals hack home and, quite frankly, all the "straight" people I've met here over the past two years (with few exceptions) fall down in t:om parison. The famed "Notre l>a1ne Man" is a myth. To he truly a man, one must have son1e fcl'lings of concern or at least son1e genuine understan­ding for others and the problems of others. The alleged N D "men" I've met on this campus catainly possess little (if any) concern. let alone understanding of homostxuals. Believe it or not. ll'e arc human heings too!! We will not rap~ you in your beds or swoop down upon you in the johns. It's trite, lknl know, hut we just want to be accl·pted and allowed to live our own lives without any of the fear we've felt in the past. 
A kiter to the editor of New York's Village Voice a few weeks ago asktd for "homo­sexual militantis111." As this let­ter pointed out, do we not have as much right as the blacks to live our own lives with a sense of dest:enL'Y and perhaps a hit of pride'/ pride tlwt maybe in this age of questioning and seart:h we have found some­
thing a niche in society (sometimes a Iundy one) yet an identity. It is this crut:ial sense of identity that all of us today seck, hut which fc actually achieve. 
I'm not asking for sympa­thy far from it. In a way I'm demanding what is my c;od given right the ability to live out my life in the manner I think best. 1:ach of us man and woman; homosexual or not has a lot to ad ivdy con­tribute to this campus communi­ty.

It 1as come to my attention that due to the recent Black Arts Festival, While Racist Confer­ence, and improved Black-White relations within the Notre Dame community a pressing social problem pertinent to all may now be aired. This is the prob­

It is a viscious circle of milk co1npanies, dining hall supervis­ion, and ill-founded dietetic principles.

sport~ parade 
By Milt Richman, UPI sports columnist 
On growing old 
NEW YORK (UPI) -Pancho Gonzalez, the boy wonder of tennis once upon a time, is in a terrible fix. He's growing old, which is bad enough in itself, but he doesn't know how to and that's worse. 
There was a time when precocious Pancho was undeniably the foremost tennis player in the world and the most colorful performer in the entire sport. Any time you went out to watch him play you automatically were guaranteed more than ~n excellent tennis exhibition, you also were treated to a dynamtc, exciting personality for the same admission. All that must seem like only yesterday to Pancho Gonzalez. But it wasn't yesterday. Not quite. 
In 10 more days Gonzalez marks his 41st birthday and he'll probably do it the same way most 41 year olds ~o. Rath~r quitely. He concedes he has to make some compensatiOns for his age playing professional tennis, and there must be nights when he feels more like 51 than 41 out there on the court, but last Saturday night in Anaheim, California, he acted more like 8 or 10 than 41 or 51. 
Gonzalex hauled off and threw his racquet into the crowd while playing against Ron Holmberg in the $10,000 Anaheim Invitational. He simply walked off the court and defaulted the match which was being played under an experimental 25 point scoring system. 
The crowd booed and in the dressing room, Gonzalez sulked. He said he wouldn't play under these conditions, and that if he had known they were gointg to use the new scoring system beforehand he never would have entered the tournament in the first place. 
Gonzalez never bothered to explain how come he wasn't so annoyed after winning the first set from Holmberg, 25-16. He didn't stalk off until he dropped the second one, 25-21. 
If Gonzalez is completely honest with himself, bone honest, he'll probably admit the new scoring system, good or bad, had little to do with his outburst. The fact he no longer can get to or make those shots on the court he once did is dist,urbing him far more. And the reason he can't get to those shots, of course, is because he's not as young as he was say, when he won his first national singles crown. The year was 1948 and Pancho Gonzalez was only 20 then. 
Age has always given Gonzalez a hard time although there's 
really no reason it should because he was still the world's ninth 
ranking player in 1968 and won $38,987 on tour, a total topped 
only by four others. 
Yet Gonzalez is far from happy and usually blames his game 
for that unhappiness, the same way Arnold Palmer docs and 
Mickey Mantle used to, although none of them ever fool 
anybody. What they're really complaining about is their age. 
As far back as 1960, Gonzalez announced he was quitting 
professional tennis. That announcement made big headlines. A 
similar announcement by him a year later made smaller ones and 
the next time Gonzalez claims he's quitting, nobody outside 
his immediate family will bother listening. 
Few athletes have the capacity for growing old gracefully. 
Maybe that's because they have so much little boy in them, as 
Roy Campanella says. 

There are exceptions. Satchel Paige has to be at the head of the 
line in that regard and guys like George Blanda, Gordie Howe, 
Hoyt Wilhelm and Jim Ferrier haven't done badly either. 
Athletes aren't the only ones to fight age, though. Many big 
time executives do and occasionally you'll still see a baseball 
owner or some other official shagging flies in the outfield during 
spring training. The fellow always looks foolish. 
"At least don't do it when there are people watching in the 
stands," a major league owner once was counseled by one of his 
aides. "You're too big a man for that and it demeans you." 
The owner quit chasing fly balls. 
As for Pancho Gonzalez, he should bear iin mind he's a big boy 
now. If he finds growing old so difficult he should also remember 
he has a lot of company. 

And a~ George Bernard Shaw would've reminded him, it sure 
beats the next best alternative.

ND netmensplitshut -outs 
Coach Tom Fallon's tennis squad split two matches over the weekend, each by 9-0 scores. The Irish whitewashed Northeast Missouri State on Saturday, but were on the tail end of the same score against an impressive Iowa squad on Sunday. 
Against Northeast Missouri the Irish took all nine matches, but Fallon's three top singles men were forced to go the dis­tance in three-set matches. Number one and two men Bernie. LeSage and Mike Reilly each dropped their middle set. LeSage came back 6-4 for his match while Reilly took his rub­ber set with a 6-3 showing. 
The best set and match of the day belonged to number three man Bob O'Malley. The Bouncer dropped his first set 2-6, took the second 6-2, and then turned· in some excellent volleying for an exciting l 0-8 win in the final set. 
The defeat was the first for Northeast Missouri's Kurt Martin and paved the way for the shut­out performance. The Notre Dame doubles combinations had little trouble in taking all three matches in consecutive sets. A­gainst Iowa on Sunday the Irish got a good taste of the "agony of defeat." Only two singles men forced three set matches. Jim Faught went 6-4, 7-9 but lost it all 6-0 in the final. Tim Whiting had the closest match dropping his final set 7-5. 
The doubles competition was much closer. A LeSage-Murray combo dropped their third set 6-2, while Bob O'Malley and Tim Whiting lost a heartbreaking third set l l-9. 
Rugby 

Georgetown University provi­ded only token opposition for the ND Rugby Club last Satur­day. The Irish romped to a 30-5 victory as Charley Blum scored three times and Bill Berry twice. 
Golf 

Notre Dame took advantage of the fine Saturday weather to score a 16-stroke victory in a golf tournament held on the Burke Memorial Golf Course. Bob Wilson led the Irish with a 140, 2 under par for 36 holes. 
Bill Cvengros (145), Bob Battaglia ( 146), Mike Brands (148), Charley Martinez (152), and Charley Musick (155) total­Jed 731 for NO's victory. Ball State was second at 747 with Southern Illinois (7 61), North­western (770), and Indiana State 
(782) trailing. 
Track 

One school record in the Long Jump and a ncar miss in the Sprint Medley Relay highlighted Notre Dame's performance in the 60th Drake Relays, held last Friday and Saturday. 
Freshman Mike McMannon 
leaped 25'-2" for fourth place 
and a new ND mark. McMannon 
now holds all four of the jump­
ing records: Long and Triple 
Jumps, both indoors and out­
doors. 

Yesterday the Irish took off on a road trip that will include away matches with Purdue and Indiana. The Irish will be seeking to improve on their 3-3 record.

Stickmen crush Ohio 
Last Saturday at Athens, Ohio, the Notre Dame La­crosse Club tangled with a red­hot Ohio University team. The Bobcats had compiled a 4-1 record and amassed an average of II goals per game. Ohio was, however, no match for the pow­erful Irish squad as the men from du Lac snapped a four­game Bobcat winning-streak with a 5-2 win. 
Contact was the name of this game, as the Irish employed a "Boston Bruin"-type offense, repeatedly intimidating the Ohi­oans with viscious body and stick checks. While the Bobcat midfielders were picking them­selves off the ground, the Irish atta(.,-1\ wasted no time making headway. Paced by attackman Pete Metzger, who had two goals and an assist in the opening five minutes, the Irish stormed to a 1uick 3-0 first period lead. This was all the stickmen needed, as the defense, plagued with mis­takes in previous games, held true in stifling a sometimes mythical Ohio attack. Their tight play forced the Bobcats into many mistakes, causing them to com mit many of the 18 costly penalties called against Ohio. The Irish defense, Jed by hard-hitting Jimmy Wachtel, enabled the offense to control most of the play. By the end of 
the first half, the Irish held a 4-1 lead on goals by Metzger, Ed Hoban and Bobby Morin. The third period was all Irish, as the offense, particularly the second line of Jim Falley, Frank Pielsticker, and Tommy Kress, stormed the Ohio goal with a total of 20 shots. But many of tht·se shots were wide of the mark and the count remained 4-1 at the end of three. An anti-climactic fourth period closed out the game, with the Irish dominating most of the play. Captain Tim McHugh's last-period goal ended the Irish scoring as the stickmen walked away with a 5-2 victory. NO's record now stands at 2-3. Statistics released this week 
by the Mid-West Lacrosse Asso­ciation show Irish attackman Bobby Morin leading in goals­per-game (3.3). Goalie Jerry Kammer, who turned in an ex­cellent game on Saturday, has the 3rd best percentage (saves vs. shots) in the Club Division with 
77%. 
Next Saturday the Irish face an awesom opponent in Ohio State. The Buckeyes, a fully-out­fitted varsity squad, meet the Irish at 2:00 at the field behind Stepan Center. Sunday, the "B" squad will lay its undefeated string on the line against Defi­ance College. 

According to judges, the Irish ..iiiiiiii_______________________62 21 .339..

violated their lane during the relay, wiping out a fine 3:16 clocking. At last report, the films of the race were still being studies. The time would have broken the N D record of 3:20.2 set last year.
