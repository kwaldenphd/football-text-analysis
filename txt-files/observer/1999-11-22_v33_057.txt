THE 

. Student exhibit gives practical gallery experience 
By ERIN LaRUFFA 
News Writer 
An exhibition of Native American art opened at the Snite Museum on Sunday. 
Notre Dame students in a Native American art history course created the exhibit. Joanne Mack, an anthropology professor and museum curator, teaches the class. 
"Students dealt in different ways with Native American art," Mack said. 
The students each picked a specific area to study. After the students had completed researching their topics, they were able to select pieces from the museum's storage to display. 
Students also wrote the labels explaining and describing each piece. 
"It's like a paper without as much writing as you would nor­mally have for a paper," Mack said. 
The class had to consider a wide variety of factors when creating their displays. 
"There were certain restric­tions on what you could and couldn't display," said Laura

INSIDE COLUMN 

Open your minds, people 
I love this school, but I can't stand some of the holier-than-thou little snobs that go here. Patrick Makeover, in his letter to the editor last Wednesday, "Cowboy Mouth is washPd up," offi­cially announced Lhat he is just way too cool for 
this campus. He decided  
that he is so cool, in. fact,  Sam Derheimer  
that  he  can  trash  the  
Student  Union  Board,  wire editor  
Cowboy Mouth and any­ 
-one with musical tastes  
other than his.  

Well, sorry, buddy. This time you were wrong. This time your elitist attitude failed you. This time your fear of accepting anything other than what pop society happens to be embracing at i.he moment caused you to miss an unbelievable con­cert. Cowboy Mouth rocked. The band's energy was incredible, and their music had the entire audience moving. I guarantee not a single person left that concert regretting either the many valu­able hours of television they missed or the killer $10 they had to part with to see a live rock show. 
But in Patrick's defense, he had never heard of Cowboy Mouth before; obviously, th.is implies that they couldn't possibly be any good. Cowboy Mouth doesn't even have a track on the latest Abercrombie & Fitch promotional CD. Damn, they must suck. U-93 doesn't play them every hour on the hour; let's trash 'em. And unlike our friend Patrick, Cowboy Mouth has refused to sell out. They must not have any talent at all. 
Honestly, people like Patrick confuse me. I don't know whether I want to laugh at them or feel sorry for them. It's really just kind of pathet­ic that people can't think for themselves any­more. I mean, what ,Nill you all do ifMTV's Total Request Live ever gets cancelled? How will you know what's cool? 
Come on. Pat. You weren't really serious when you said you'd rather have Right Said Fred or some '80s hair metal band come than Cowboy Mouth? Is there something wrong with you? You'd rather see a worthless, talentless joke than a great live rock band simply because you're too shallow to open yourself up to something new? 
Open your minds, people! Break free! I know it's hard to believe, but there is a whole world of thought outside the stifling trends at Notre Dame. There is music other than what the Dave Matthews Band plays. If you live your entire life too scared to accept anything not already pre­approved by pop culture, you are going to miss out. (You know, at one time, no one knew who the Dave Mathews Band was, either.) 
To SUB. I say thank you. You brought in a great band, and the concert was amazing. For those of us capable of looking beyond the flavor of the hour and enjoying a concert for no other reason than because the band rocks, the concert was a great experience. 
So Patrick, I guess it all comes down to this: While you were sitting in your dorm room watch­ing "Dawson's Creek" on TV, Twas at one of the best 1.ive rock shows I've been to in a while. And because none of the closed-minded clones like you showed up, I got great seats, too. Thanks, buddy.

Clemson debates Old South icon 
CLEMSON, S.C. 
The effects of the controversy over the Confederate flag atop the state's capital building has affected all parts of the state, and Clemson University is no exception. After 37 years of debate over the issue, the NAACP has recently initiated economic sanctions in an attempt to force South Carolina's legislative branch to remove the flag from its current location at the state capital building. Bryant Smith, associate director of student media and an instructor of speech and communications for the Universitv, said the University is not immune to the effects that will be felt due to the new motions-being brought up to remove the flag. "Students need to be aware of the issue over the flag because they are 'the people the boycott is going to affect," said Smith. "It is going to affect conferences, tourism for students involved in related majors and a lot of students' summer employment opportunities." The NAACP's boycott of the state is an attempt to increase pressure on Gov. Jim Hodges and politicians to take down the flag, an attempt that has received both approval and opposi­tion. 

Unions protest UC-Stanford merger 
LOS ANGELPOS 

Students and representatives of UC unions metThursday to protest the UC Board of Regents, urg­ing members to support the end of the UC San Francisco-Stanford merger. The merger, they said, has resulted in the "privatization" of UCSF. Protesters also said they dislike the high turnover rate of medical employees. During Friday's meeting, the entire Board of Regents is scheduled to vote on the dissolution of the merger of the UCSF and Stanfordmedical centers, which the Committee on Health Services already voted unanimously to do. In 1997, a merger between the universities' hospitals was initiated to strengthen edu­cation and availability of health care at UCSF and Stanford. The merger was also supposed to help both institutions financially, but the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and unforeseen problems created monetary loss­es. The merger created new policies for past UC employees who are now under the control of the UCSF-Stanford health care organization. Some union members said they are worried that if the merger ends, former UC workers will be out of jobs and will experience a decrease in salaries and benefits.

ISRAEL 
Russian military aid builds Iran's strength 
. Israel fears Iran may soon develop nuclear capabilities 
Associated Pre!:iS 
TEL AVIV 
Unless the United States pressures Russia to end its military assistance to Iran, lhc Islamic republic will pos­sess a nuclear capability with­in live years, a senior Israeli military oflicial said Sunday. 
Israel has intelligence that Iran plans to upgrade its Shahab-3 ballistic missile, currently still in the testing phase, to make it capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and to extend its range to 1,300 miles, the official said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The official said that the Iranians were working on advanced versions of the mis­sile, named Shahab-4 and Shahab-5. 
Iran has confirmed testing the Shahab-3, a ballistic mis­sile capable of reaching 800 miles, but says it is purely for defensive purposes. 
The official said that in light of the new intelligence, Israel and the United States were 

I. 
discussing ways to increase pressure on Russia to stop military assistance Israel accuses Moscow of providing Iran. 
Hussia has repeatedly denied reports that it is help­ing Iran develop ballistic mis­siles and nuclear weapons, and has rejected past U.S. pressure. Moscow is helping Tehran build a nuclear power plant that both insist is only for pAaceful purposes. 
The official said Israel regards the com'binalion of surface-to-surface missiles and nonconvcntional weapons in Iranian hands as "a threat to the world." . Israel regards Iran as the chief backer of the Hezbollah, a guerrilla army fighting Israel's occupation of south Lebanon. !'rime Minister Ehud Barak has promised a negoti­ated withdrawal from Lebanon by July. 
The official said that the rnil­itarv would have a withdrawal plan ready for l3arak's approval by next month, Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon, and Barak regards relaunching negotiations with Syria as crucial to ensuring a smooth withdrawal. 
However, he has not dis­counted a unilateral with­drawal, should talks with the Syrians fail to materialize. 
Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli army's chief-of-staff, told Israel TV on Sunday that the army was prepared to examine the feasibility of a unilateral withdrawal should the government consider the option. 
The army established its "security zone" in: south Lebanon in 1985 to protect Israel's northern towns from attack. 
Wary of the impending with­drawal, residents of the north­ern towns protested the army's failnre to include them in any post-withdrawal plai1­ning by blacking out street lights Sunday evening and calling for a strike of schools and municipal services on Monday.

Oswald's voice not on JFK tape 
. Assassin may not have made embassy call 
Associated Pre.s 
WASHINGTON 
Hours after President Kennedy was assassinated, FBI agents reportedly lis­tened to a tape of a phone call that a man identifying himself as "Lee Oswald" had placed to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. 
They made a startling dis­covery: The voice on the tape was not Oswald's, govern­ment records say. 
This controversial tape has been a question mark in the. assassination investigation since Kennerly was killed. The assassination occurred 36 years ago Monday and only now have new d1>tails about the tape come to light 
The CIA said years ago that tho tapes on which it record­ed lhe call were erased. Documents released in recent years said otherwise. The latest and newest of declassified documents offer more evidence that the tapes survived. 
The discovery that the voice on the tape was some­one other than Oswald was a 

"disquieting discovery because the man who imper­sonated Oswald was still at large," said John Newman, an ex-military intelligence analyst, author and professor at the University of Maryland. 
Oswald was in Mexico City in September and October 1963. During his one-week stay, he contacted the Soviet Embassy and the Cuban con­sulate, inquiring about visas needed to go to the Soviet Union via Cuba. 
It is widely known that the CIA bugged telephones and . took surveH!ance photos at both the embassy and con­sulate. But the agency main­tained that it had routinc>Jy erased and reused tapes of the phone intercepts, A mes­sage from the CIA's Mexico City station to headquarters on Nov. 24, 196:~. said: "HQ has full transcripts all perti­nent calls. Regret complete recheck shows tapes for this period already erased." 
lt was also known that while he was in Mexico City, Oswald had contact with Valcriv Kost.ikov -a man that on·o CIA memo described as a "case officer in an oper-· ation which is evidently sponsored by the KGB's 13th Department responsible for sabotage and assassination."

It was the caller who is thought to have impersonat­ed Oswald who links him to lhis Soviet spy unit known as Department 13. 
Newly dcclassif'ied docu­ments -some released in the past six months -say that after the president was shot, a Navy plane carried a top-secret package from Mexico City to Dallas and landed there about. 4 a.m. EST the day after the mur­der.

"There wore no tapes to my knowledge," Rudd said in a telephone interview. "I brought th1i pictures up lf'rom Mexico I and it was my understanding that it was just pictures." 
Documents contradict Hudd 's understanding. A newly released memo dated Nov. 27, 1963, f'rnm FBI headquarters to its office in Mexico City, stated:

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has given $26 million to UNICEF to pay for pro­grams fighting maternal and neonatal tetanus, which caused more than 215,000 deaths in d1vnloping nations last year, the foundation annotmcnd Sunday. The disease, which killed just <Ille U.S. newborn in 1998, is one of the world's most serious ailments affiicting infants and their mothers. It can be prevented by immtmizing women with tetanus toxoid vac­cinn.

Officials turn over heroin dealer 
Associated Press 
BOGOTA 
Police put an accused heroin trafficker on a U.S. government plane to Florida on Sunday, the first time in nearly a decade Colombia has turned over one of its nationals to stand trial in the United States. 
The handover of 30­year-old Jaime Orlando Lara to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration comes ten days after a deadly terror­ist bomb exploded in Bogota in what many suspected was a warning against extraditions. 
President Andres Pastrana defiantly signed Lara's extradition papers 

South Africa accepts homosexuality 
just hours after the Nov. 11 explosion, which killed eight bystanders in an upscale shopping district. 
"In compliance with that executive decision, this cit­izen was transferred today to the United States," judi­cial police director Gen. Ismael Trujillo told reporters at a Bogota air base from which Lara left Sunday morning on a DEA plane for Fort Lauderdale. 
Dressed in jeans and sneakers, the handcuffed and heavily guarded sus­pect walked the 60 feet to the twin-engine Cessna without uttering a word, police said. 
Lara was indicted in New York in October 1998. Prosecutors say he headed a smuggling ring that shipped as many as 30 pounds of heroin to the United States on commer­cial flights and distributed it through New York, Houston and Miami. 

Colombia exports 80 percent of the world's cocaine and is a rising heroin supplier to the 
U.S. market. 

Acting on a U.S. request, police captured Lara in Bogota last December. He was among 42 drug sus­pects awaiting possible extradition to the United States. At least 30 of those are Colombians captured Oct. 13 in a sweep authori­ties dubbed Operation Millennium. 
Colombian banned extradition in 1991, capit­ulating to a wave of bomb­ing and assassinations by the now-defunct Medellin 
September. 

Homosexuality remains deeply taboo in central and west Africa, where incidents of harassment occur periodically. African bishops at the Anglican Church's once­a-decade conference in England last year helped push through a denuncia­tion of homosexuality a "incompatible with scrip­ture." Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, famous for saying that homosexuals are "lower than pigs and dogs," was accosted by gay activists in London in October. He said government-backed drug cartel and its notori­ous leader, Pablo Escobar. The Nov. 11 bombing revived painful memories of that era, although inves­tigators have yet to blame it on drug traffickers. 
Under heavy pressure from Washington, Colombia reinstated extra­dition in December 1997. Lara is the first Colombian sent abroad since the rein­statement. 
White House drug policy chief Barry McCaffrey on Sunday praised Pastrana "for his courage and dedi­cation" in "making a sin­cere effort to confront drug trafficking." 
In the past three years, the cultivation of coca ­the· raw material of cocaine -has doubled in Colombia, McCaff'rey said. 
"gangster gays" were behind the attack, and demanded an apology ­in vain at the Commonwealth summit this month. The climate could not be more differ ent in South Africa, where former president Nelson Mandela and other freedom fighters cultivated an atmosphere of tolerance after the end of white minority rule.

Bernalee Rabeira, a 26-year-old makeup artist with a dazzling smile, was crowned the second Miss Gay South Africa in a drag queen contest that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. The pageant, held Saturday night in a conservative farming hub near Kruger National Park, caused hardly a ripple other than a few irate statements from a local minister ­testament to how far South Africa has come since the rigid morality of apartheid, when homo­sexuality was illegal and gay people were often harassed. Even more so, it illustrated how South Africa has become a bea­con for gay rights in a region where govern­ments are showing them­selves increasingly homo­phobic. 
In southern Africa, leaders of Namibia. Zambia and Zimbabwe have denounced homo­sexuality in recent years. Condemnation came from the presidents of Kenya and Uganda in

Bush skips

Front-runner George W. Bush was the only major absentee as four Republican presidential 
hopefuls debated Sunday in Ariz;ona, but he was the center of atLenlion from the partici­

From tho outset. debate participants sought to distinguish themselves from the Texas governor, who said dur­ing an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" he would con­sider raising the eligibility age for Social Security. 
Arizona Sen. John McCain told a home-state crowd he would protect Social Security by separating it from the overall federal budget and allowing workers to invest some of their payments into personal invest­ment accounts. 
"You've got to keep Congress' hands off of it," he said. Magazine publisher Steve Forbes made a similar pitch to 
create private accounts. 
"Bush's plan is typical Washington," Forbes said. "Where they

diplomat Alan Keyes also supported personal control o~er the investment of Social Security funds. He then went on to argue for an end to income taxes. "In that way we will restore control of our money," he said. 
Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch offered no specifics, but said no idea would be rejected. "We're going to have to look at everything." 
The debate at Arizona State University was sponsored by the Arizona Hepublican Party and broadcast live on C-SPAN. More than 2,000 people bought tickets for the event. · 
The Texas governor already has missed two debates in New Hampshire, because of what he said were scheduling conflicts. Asked Sunday on CNN's "Late Edition" about Bush's absence, Forbes said: "He probably has a 
fund-raiser tonight." 
Another Arizona debate was 
added Dec. 6 to accommodate 
the front-runner. McCain 
doesn't plan to be there.

himself as the leading alterna­

success to "retail politics." 
"People want to meet you and

Thousands protest at Fort Benning 
Associated Press 
FORT BENNING, Ga. 
Thousands of protesters, many wearing black robes and white death masks, marched onto Port Benning on Sunday to protest human rights abuses they say are_ committed by graduates ol the Army's School of the Americas. 
Several of the 4,800 demonstrators were detained by military and civilian police, including actor Martm Sheen. . 
The protesters carried coffins and crosses bearing the names of victims of vio­lence in Latin America. Once on the base, several lay down on a street pretending to be dead and splattered them­selves with red paint.

Hindus protest Baptist church

BOSTON 
Nearly four dozen Hindus picketed outside a churr,h Sunday to protest a Southern Baptist Convention prayer booklet that said Hindus have "darkness in their hearts that no lamp can dispel." 
The booklet, released during the Hindu festival of Divali, contains a numb1ff of other phrases considered offensive by Hindus. It has ignited similar protests in Houston and Atlanta. 

"At any sign of religious intol­erance, we have to spnak up," said Chandra Kany Panse of New England Hindus Against H.eligious Intolerance, which organized the protest at Beacon Iiill Baptist Church. "We would like the convention to drop this attack and apologize." 
Similar guides have been dis­tributed by the Southern Baptist Convention's International Mission Board asking Baptists to pray for the conversion of Jnws and Muslims. 
-David Draper, pastor or Urn Boston church, concnded the booklet was "poorly ti1mid," ·and "arrogant," although he planned to distribute it.

Every once in awhile, to really get some blood moving, the First Aid Services Team here on campus holds disaster drills. Last April we ran a drill in the Stadium, setting the scenario that a section of the stands had col­lapsed. We prac­ticed radioing the . disaster in and tak­ing control, triag­ing and treating the victims, all the while laughing at the ridiculousness of pretending our advisor had been beheaded by falling debris. After the victims were triaged, tagged and dispatched to the hospital, the club had a little party, sort of a social gath­ering, a thank-you-for-coming-out-and­saving-lives. Recently, when the First Aid Team filed an appeal for more funding, I noted on the appeal. that one of our expenditures from last year had been. "Pizza following the disaster." The Club Coordination Council, though amused, thought I was making that expenditure up. 
I've done other disaster drills since then. In September, the county held a big one at the Michiana Regional Airport, with the premise that a plane had skidded off the end of the runway, killing four and injuring 60. This time, though, instead of being a rescuer, I was working for the American Red Cross Disaster Services Team. We never got near the blood and gore; our job was family support. 
I worked this disaster with a different perspective. We weren't in the action, we were stuffed away in a too-small, airless boardroom in the back hallway of the airport. The mock family mem­bers quickly grew as restless as any real family members would have. We sat there for two hours, waiting. After an hour of hearing constant sirens. we were all tense. The door would open to admit someone returning from the bathroom, and every head in the room would snap up in anticipation of infor­mation. The mock families bonded, inventing stories about their mock loved ones, guessing who would have been sitting next to whom on the plane. In our role as grief support counselors, the other Red Cross volunteers and I wandered around the room, consoling as best we could and mostly being help­less. We had no information for them, and information was all they wanted. People prayed under the guidance of the airport chaplains, tempers flared as families lashed out at anyone they could, and hysteria was beginning to take over when the airline representa­tive came in to announce that lunch was in a half-hour. 


That served to remind us it was all fake. No one was actually injured, no one was actually on the plane that didn't actually go off the runway. The mock family members settled down to while away the next 30 minutes chat­ting, and the grief counselors all chuck­led at how quickly we start to believe that the disaster was real. 
I remember that sudden fiash of real­ization: it could have all been real. I could have been consoling real family members, waiting for word on their loved ones. I work in an emergency room, doing much the same thing, keeping families updated on their patients and keeping patients updated on their treatments. Sometimes I do forget how real their pain is, that the families aren't just acting out a part they volunteered to play and that the patients are truly in agony over the test results. 
Outside of the ER, I tend to take a very American approach to disasters. When I read that 17,000 people died in earthquakes in Turkey, I sometimes forget that those are real people. And certainly the number 17,000 is mean­ingless to me. 
Seventeen thousand is a lot of people. Imagine if, at Saturday's football game, tho entire student section. from section 28 to section 36, were empty. Then imagine that sections one and two and three were all empty, too. That's about 17,000 people. 
Now imagine the entire stadium being empty, and the JACC being empty at a pep rally, and the dining halls at the peak rush of dinnertime. Add them all together in your head. That's about how many people would have gone to funerals or buried the dead from that earthquake. 
Twelve students were killed at Texas A&M last week. Imagine the emotional impact here if 12 Domers were killed in one freak accident. It's not just 12 dead people; it's the hundreds of family members who are grieving, grieving for real. 
Think about the problems, logistical and emotional, of burying or otherwise laying to rest the 10,000 killed in the cyclone in India three weeks ago. That could be you, trying to make arrange­ments for the funeral of your entire family. 
So next time you read that 217 people were killed in a plane crash, remember that that disaster is not a media-creat-. ed happening enacted for your horri­fied, fascinated entertainment. Those are 217 real people, with 217 families who care about them and miss them. 
And if you want to do more than think and take another step towards becom­ing aware of the impact of natural or other disasters on humanity, call the Hed Cross. They'd be happy to get more volunteers, and you will have the chance to understand the reality of dis­asters.

Unfortunately. the

tragic facts -at 
University

lnast 11 dead. downs inj1m1d ­am only too real. and thn wnight of sadntiss on campus is 
almost tangible. 
Such II heavy burden cannot be lifted by nwrn words. and litlle can be said about this 90-vear-old tradition that will bn rnmem.bered in another 90 years. 
But to say nothing would do a disser­vic1~ to the memories of our friends. 
To those who k1ww them, we know you an hurting, but we can never know how much. Tlrn families and frinnds of all thosP affoctnd deserve and have our sohN thoughts and prayers. 
To thosl' who did not know them, we know you ari' hurting too. Long after Wfl know how il happened, we will still lm wond11ring why. In lhn meanlim11, il is important to rnnrnmbcr that this is a time for condolences, not quarrels. 
Much will be said in the coming wmiks that would be better left unsaid. hir this is not thP lime to point lingers of blame or speculate about lhe future of Bonfire. 
Whal is appropriate instnad is silence. 
It would b11 wrong lo turn this tragedy inlo an opportunity for loud debate. The lives lost arn worth much morn than angry arguments, and rnspectful re0ec­tion should not give place to wrangling ov11r traditions. 
II' thern is a lesson ln be learned from this horrih!li accidnnt, it will strike at the vury lmart of who we are as human lll'ings. 
It will remind us or the inevitable fragility of life and the enduring stabili­ty of f'rinndship. J\nd it will teach us morn than we cvnr knew about the indomitable stnmgth of the Aggie spirit. 
What remains, then, is not to despair, hut instead to discover (IUr lrue worth -to do b11ttcr with the lives we have befrn given in honor of the lives that have been taken. There is nothing else to do. 
Already, the A&M community has exemplified the truism that the worst of tinrns bring out Lim bnst in people. 
Concerned students, staff and com­munity rnsidents have generously pro­vided rnsourccs of' hopt1 and shoulders ()f help. 
But Aggitis expocl no less, and we know we will recover from this blow with Uw dignity and dctcrminalion that make this University great. Flags nying at hall'-masl are not indicative of half­lmarted Aggies. Our hearts are full and howiful. 
It will take timn lo come to tnrms with what seems so surreal. But in the end. we will have learned that in life, the rnal stu!T is the rough stuff. And the rough stuff makes us stronger.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Can't we use food waste for farms? 
l just got back from South Dining hall tonight, and after a few students asked me to dump my wasted food into a trash bin, I got to thinking. I thought to myself, "Finally, they're going to do something with all of the food we waste here." I was then told by one of the students that they weren't really doing anything with the food waste; they were just simply collecting it to see how much food was wasted. My mind was boggled. 
I had read a few of the letters in last weeks Observers about the "Students for Clean Plates" and their mission to reduce food waste in the dining halls. I must admit how glad I was to see that someone was raising issue with our wasteful tendencies. However, it seemed to me that this was not an issue that warranted an all out hunger strike or anything of' the sort. The fact is that the students here pay very well (about $8 a meal} to eat a wide selec­
. tion of as much food as we desire. We should be able to take what we want and not feel tremendous guilt for doing so. At the same time, hopefully most parents have Instilled the concept of "take what you want, eat what you take" to their children, and hopefully we practice this as often as possible. Beyond all of this, there seems to be a very simple, common-sense solution to the wasted food problem at Notre Dame. 
Most people are aware that food that goes unused from the kitchens in the dining halls is donated to local home­less shelters and other charitable causes. My question is; why can't the waste food also be put to use. I always thought it obvious, but I guess not. Here in Indiana there ought to be plen­ty of farmers who would be able to use the slop food to feed their livestock. 

Why don't the "Students for Clean Plates" contact local farmers who might be interested in receiving donat­ed slop for their pigs and other ani­mals? Maybe this has been considered before and there is some catch that I'm not considering, but since this is a system that other environmentally aware institutions have already adopt­ed, 1don't see why Notre Dame Food Services couldn"t do the same 
So, next time you're at the dining hall, don't feel bad about eating what­ever you want. but please, do your best lo reduce your food waste. Furthermore, let's hope the food we do waste might be put to a better use than to just occupy landfill space.

Students respond to Cowboy Mouth 

Concert worth every penny 
In response to Mr.McKeever's letter in Wednesday's Viewpoint section, I would like to defend Cowboy Mouth to all the people who may have read his Jetter but didn't get a chance to come see the show tonight. Far from being a "struggling, washed-up, one-hit wonder," Cowboy Mouth is a wonderful col­lection of musicians and people who love what they do and love making other people feel great. True, I was in the majority of people who weren't terribly familiar with their music and could sing along to maybe two or thrne songs, but that didn't stop me from having a great time. Mr. McKecver's letter is indicative of a trend I have noticed in my short time here at Notre Dame. People need to realize that just because something is not wildly popular or well-known, doesn't mean that it can't be pretty cool. IT'S OKAY TO THY SOMETHING DIFFERENT EVERY NOW ANO THEN. I did, and l think I'm a better person for it. I would even go so far as to say that the money I spent on my ticket is the best $10 I have spent here. I'd like to share some wisdom with the people who weren't there last night -I know many people were studying and doing what you normally do on Wedncsduy nights -so here are the secrets to happiness, according to Fred, Cowboy Mouth's frontman: 
1) Life is too short to spond with someone who doesn't realize 
how special you are. 21 Life is too short to spend it doing something that isn't fun. 
3) No matter what anybody tells you, if you believe in your­
self, NOTHING is impossible! God bless you all. He certainly has blessed me.

SUB announces open forum 
At first, l was tempted to answer Patrick McKeever's letter with anger. Ilowever, I realized that this would not help him or the situation that Student Union Board faces. I will grant Patrick thn fact that Cowboy Mouth is nol the most widely known band, but we were willing to take a risk on a band that has won numerous rock awards and continuously sells out shows at other campuses across the country. The question of what are Notre Dame students willing to attend is one that we !'ace in SUB all of the time. We constantly try to provide entertainment that will take students out­side of the Notre Dame bubble. We pour hours (more than most would realize) into providing entertainment and events for the Notre Dame community. I can't begin to tell you the amount or times that l have been asked how much I get paid to spend over 40 hours a week in 201 LaFortune. Well, everyone in SUB gets paid the same -not one cent. What benefit do we get? Well, we do it for the pure enjoyment of seeing our fellow stu­dents happy. 
That is exactly what distresses me so much about Patrick McKeever's article regarding Cowboy Mouth. It is very easy for him (and others) to sit in his dorm room and criticize the months of work that have gone into this concert when he is completely unaware of what really takes place with Concerts and SUB. As a result of letter, and as Board Manager of the Student Union Board, I decided that I want to know exactly what the stu­dent body would like to sec brought here to cam­pus. Therefore, the Student Union Board is announcing an open forum meeting on Tuesday, December 7 at 7:30pm in the Montgomery Theater in LaFortune. Anyone with any ideas or concerns is welcome to att,md and share their thoughts. I hope to see Patrick and many more of you there. In addition, anyone on campus is wel­come to join SUB at any time. 
Finally, for thos0 of you who did not altond the concert, I am sorry that you didn't tako the oppor­tunity to witness a tremendous live show. It would have been worth it, 1promise. Just read what the South Bend Tribune had to say about the energy and excitement that Cowboy Mouth provided. Over tho past few years SUB has brought bands in that perhaps weren't huge name bands at the time, but have proven themselves pretty soon after visiting the infamous Stepan Center (i.e., Beck, Ben Fold's Five, Ani Difranco, Wilco). In the futurn, trust those who put hours of hard work into the events that are brought lo this campus. We believe in what we are doing. Your interest and support will only help us to bring bigger and bettPr events in the future. I hope lo sec you all on December 7th.

director for all she was able to do. 
"The Water Engine" tells the complex story of Lang, a young inventor who cre­ated an engine that uses distilled water as its only fuel. Due to such an impor­tant and potentially lucrative invention, Lang is left to fight for her engine and her life against the most motley of adversaries. 
In order to tell this story, Bonifield structured the tale as a radio show, one in which the studio acts as a metaphor and a source of commentary for what is going on around it. This structure was highly inventive and effective, most notably when the actors straddled the two realms. The actors were constantly in motion; for even when they were not in the scene occurring elsewhere, they were reading their radio scripts and changing costumes. 
In one highly affecting scene, Laqg begins to realize her predicament while at a science exhibit, and a God-like themes of the produc­tion, the interconnect­
~ edness of man. As played by Katie Sise, the Chain Letter was an omnipresent observer whose smooth voice and swinging hips constantly reminded the audience of what we were to focus on. She was of the Greek Chorus, embodied here in a sexy black dress. While the larger importance of the Chain Letter charac·ter and her message was not discovered by many in the audi­ence, her presence as she moved around the theater was highly effective, and she added a sense of ironic mystery to the story. Joining Katie Sise onstage were nine other actors who could not have been better cast. They all seemed to embody the characters they were playing, even when shifting effortlessly between per­sonas. While this technique of one actor play­ing several roles was intriguing to the 
audience, it some­times led to mis­taken identities by the audience, not realizing that one actor is not play­ing a prior charac­ter in disguise, but rather playing a whole new char­acter. 
Despite this small problem, the actors were defi­nitely up lo the challenge that a Mamet play pre­sents. 
Playing the IP.ad character, Lang, Erin Lutterbach showed a complex combination of strength and fragility, as if she knew the whole time that her engine would never be fully hers. In a show that hinges so much on the central character, Lutterbach defi­nitely helmed the cast with the ablest of skill. 
While the acting ensemble was equal­ly effective and skilled, the most enjoy­ably energetic performance of the evening was given by Victoria Eleanor Bradford in her portrayal of Bernie, a young girl with curly locks and a Shirley Temple voice. 
It was refreshing to watch someone· play a child onstage with a sparkling wit and a fascinated eye -as a child really is -rather than a foolish caricature, as if every child in a play must be a combi­nation of Annie and Oliver. 
-Yet, despite the mastery of the work by both actors and director. the singular problem in the production seemed to be the convoluted and unengaging story. Despite a clever concept, Mamet writes in such a fragmentary way that his audience is never able ~o really relate to the characters or their outcome. 


When the heroine ultimately met her tragic death, there was surprise from the audience, but very little sympathy. The characters may have been written to create distance from the audience, but at times, they seemed to be lost withfo the plot, thus causing the superb direction and concept to be even more remarkable. 
Yet, despite this small problem, "The Water Engine" proved to be an enjoy­able and successful evening that was not so highbrow that it could not be enjoyed. Perhaps this could be a hint for later seasons.

moments of Saturday's game 
IRISH INSIGHT 


Time had expired, the squirrel had crossed the end line and the score­board above Notre Dame Stadium read Boston College 31, Notre Dame 29. 
And as the victorious Boston College players walked off the field, through the tun­nel leading to their locker room, one by one they paid tribute to Mike Poidomani. Standing at the end of the tun­nel, with Touchdown Jesus in full view and Eagle fans outside the gate celebrating, Poidomani embraced each player. The Boston College strength coach has been an integral part of the Eagles' turnaround from a 4-7 team a year ago to their current 8·2 record and a place in the top 25. 
"We got 'cm," the elated Poidomani told his players as they headed to the locker room. 
That scene is becoming all too com­mon. 
Six times this season, the opponent has knocked off the mighty Irish. A year removed from a perfect record at home, the Irish ended their 1999 home campaign with a 5-2 mark at Notre Dame Stadium. 
Bob ·oavie likes to say that every time an opponent plays Notre Dame, they always regard it as their biggest game of the season. 
Why don't the Irish treat it the same? 
Because emotion, motivation and playing hard for 60 minutes has noth­ing at all to do with the strength of your opponent. Or how many players you have injured. Or how talented you are. 
It comes from within. And that's what been so frustrating for Irish fans this year. 
Boston College had plenty of rea­sons to be excited for Saturday's game. For starters, they were denied a victory in last year's game when running back Mike Cloud was stopped four times within the 5-yard line. 

They used that defeat as a source of inspiration. In the offseason, a photo of Deke Cooper stopping Cloud on fourth-and-1 to seal the 31-26 victory was posted in the Eagles locker room. The caption was entitled, "How hard are you going to work this summer." 
This week the slogan was changed to "How hard are you going to work this week." 
On Saturday, the quote of note read "Who wants it more." 
The Eagles also felt slighted for being 10-point underdogs to a .500 team when thAy were 7-2 and in the top 25. 
Then came Friday night, at the pep rally, in a full to capacity Joyce Center, when Davie added fuel to the already flaming BC fire. 
Addressing the attendees, in the middle of his usual monologue on how big a game this is and how we have the best band, cheerleaders and student body in the country, Davie turned to a group of Boston College students who were situated in the bleachers. Looking over his right shoulder, Davie said "that's another reason right there to kick Boston College's ass." 
When word of Davie's comments got back to the Boston College play­ers, they took it to heart. 
"Sure, I said it in front of 12,000 people," Davie said referring to the pep rally. "I think that's what a pep rally is for, but I wouldn't take things so seriously." 
The BC players obviously did. As too, they did with an unconfirmed report that Davie had guaranteed a victory for the Irish. 
Davie denied ever making such a claim. 
"That's totally false, totally ridicu­lous," Davie said referring to the alleged guarantee. "I never made a statement like that in 20 years of coaching and I detlnitely didn't make a statement like that this week. I'm not overreacting to it because I think it's all kind of silly." 
Nevertheless the Eagles used it as a motivating force. Corny, overused catch phrases caught the BC player's attention. 
Something the Irish were missing. For no apparent reason. Notre Dame could have found moti­

vation in several areas. It was the last home game ever for a group of seniors who had been through the resignation of a coach and no bowl victories.' A victory over Boston College would have kept the Irish in the bowl picture. They were playing the only other Catholic-affiliated school in Division 1-A football, a rivalry that stands right behind the annual clashes with USC and Michigan. 
With representatives from the Insight.com bowl game present, the Irish came. out like they were ready to head to Arizona for the Christmas vacation. They scored two quick touchdowns on runs by Tony Pisher and Julius Jones within the !irst eight minutes of the game. The players were pumped, the coaches were emotional and the 80,012 fans had visions of winning by a large margin for the first time since the Arizona State game. 
They proved that they have the tal­ent to beat Boston College. 
But then came an interception of a Jarious Jackson pass by the Eagles' RaMon Johnson. Suddenly the momentum turned to Boston College, as they scored on the ensuing possns­sion. 
It stayed that way until midway through the fourth quarter when Julius Jones's 67-yard punt return narrowed the margin to 31-29, giving the Irish hope. Notre Dame had another chance, with the ball on their 27-yard line. But a Pedro Cirino interception sealed the victory for the Eagles. 
"When you're down by fourteen points [the Irish were down 31-17 in the fourth quarter], it's hard to rally and come back to win the game," Davie said. 
Weren't the Eagles down by 14 and didn't they r.ome back to win'? 
"We're a team that goes out there and grinds out every play," said Bryan Arndt, Boston College's leading receiver on the day with five catches for 80 yards. "We're a 60 minute ball team." 
It would be nice if a Notre Dame player or coach could say that ... and mean it.

HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS 
The Notre Dame football team will spend the holiday season at home this year. Last Saturday's 31-29 loss to Boston College eliminated Notre Dame from the bowl picture and ensured the Irish a non-winning record for the first time since 1986. Notre Dame takes on Stanford Saturday with hopes of averting its first seven loss season since -1963.

NCAA BASKETBALL 
Ranked opponents wary of early upsets 
Associated Press 
LAHAINA, Hawaii 
The list is impressive ­Connecticut, Ohio State, Duke. Utah and St. John's. All were in the preseason top 25 and all have lost a game this season. 
Since No. 5 North Carolina, No. 7 Florida and No. 24 Purdue are all in the field for the Maui Invitational, which begins Monday, at least two more teams will be added to that list. 
Whatever happened to "Cupcake City," as a well­known TV analyst referred to playing early season mismatch es? 
"These games don't count against your 27-game schedule and they are a chance to see where you stack up in your league and it's an opportunity to travel whether it's Maui, Puerto Rico or New York City for the Preseason NIT," Purdue coach Gene Keady said Sunday. 
"There's lot of good things about it. It all changed when people realized they had to win so it was a good way to recruit. You don't get credit for win­ning games or even a league anymore. It's about getting to the Final Four. It's a different world." 
The Boilermakers open against the host team, Division II Chaminade, then things get tough with possible consecutive games against top ten teams. 
Florida and Utah State also are in Purdue's bracket, and Monday's other games have North Carolina against Southern California and Georgetown meeting Memphis. 
This is North Carolina's third 
appearance in the Maui 
Invitational and the Tar Heels 
have left as runners-up twice. 
"We've always tried to play a good schedule and it helps to find out -and certainly all eight teams here are here to find out -your strengths and weaknesses and that can only help you down the line," Tar Heels coach Bill Guthridge said Sunday. 
Both Purdue and North Carolina are veteran teams, but Florida has 11 sophomores and freshmen on the roster and even with a 96-61 victory over Florida State, it would seem the Gators need time to play together. 
''Ideally, from a preparation standpoint, we would have liked to have had more than one day of practice from a game Friday night to three con­secutive games like we'll have here," Florida coach Billy Donovan said Sunday. "I try to look at it a little differently in that we'll find out in a three­day period where we're at. This will hopefully force our team to grow up and mature. With the caliber of field in this tournament, there could be some bumps in the road but hopefully we'll leave here a better team." 
Donovan was a member of the first Maui Invitational champion, Providence in 1984. 
"I was on the team but didn't play," he said. "I did have a great seat and watched a lot. It was a free trip to Maui." 
The setting and the level of competition makes this tourna­ment attractive. 
Former Big Ten and Big Eight commissioner Wayne Duke has been the chairman of the Maui Invitational for 10 years. 
"The change in getting teams happened gradually," he said Sunday. "The first thing the coaches used to ask was, 'Who do 1 have to play?' Now they don't worry about who they play, they just want to play." · 
To honor Duke's decade of service, the tournament has named the championship tro­phy in his honor. Guthridge immediately turned that into more motivation for his team. 
"We would certainly like to win the Duke invitational," he said.

St. Clair had 17 points and Flores had 19 points and nine assists for the unranked Cardinal (2-0) -who no longer dominate as in the mid-1990s, but remain a dangerous oppo­nent, especially at home.

But by halftime, Purdue (2-0) had cut the Commodores' lead to37-31. 
Boilermakers Katie Douglas, who was 10-of-10 from the free throw line, ignited a 12-0 Purdue run during that allowed the Boilermakers to take a 46-41 lead with 10:33 mark. 
Douglas scored the first six points in the run, hitting a 3­pointer and converting on a three-point play with 14:11 left. 
Kelly Komara added 11 points for the Boilermakers, while reserve Shinika Parks had 10 points and seven rebounds. 
Chavonne Hammond gave the Commodores their biggest lead of the second half at 41-34 with 16:50 left, but after her basket, Vanderbilt didn't score again until Cion Washington's jumper with 9:56 remaining. 

Chanteelle Anderson scored with 9:03 remaining to trim Purdue's lead to 47-45, but Douglas scored the next four points to give Purdue a 51-45 lead. 
Zuzana Klimesova led the Commodores with 13 points. 
No. 15 5. Barbara 71, 
No. 13 Illinois 61 

Erin Buescher scored 21 points and Kristi Rohr had 16 points and 10 rebounds for Santa Barbara, which held Illinois to 31 percent shooting.

Allison Curtin had 16 points and 10 rebounds for the Illini and Catchings scored 15 points while grabbing 11 rebounds. 
No. 9 NC St. 75, 
LINC-Greensboro 58

Tynesha Lewis had 12 points and 10 rebounds as the Wolfpack improved to 3-0. Summer· Erb and Monica Bates each scored 12 points. 
The Spartans (1-2), the pre­season pick to win the Southern Conference, were led by ChoRhonda Gwaltney's 15 points. Brianne Dodgen added 13 points and Katie Delcampo chipped in with 11. 
UNCG, which faced a size dis­
advantage, was hampered 
even more when 6-foot-2 cen­
ter Sandi Reid was unable to 
play after injuring her right 
shoulder in Saturday's win 
over Washington. 
No. 12 Auburn 93, 
Jacksonville St 54 
Tasha Hamilton and LaRita Spencer scored 15 points each, leading Auburn to a win over Jacksonville State. 
The Tigers led 16-1 after the first six minutes. The Jaguars committed four fouls that helped Auburn take a 9-0 lead and didn't make their first bas­ket until Heather Mayes' jumper at 6:46. 
Kris Bernath then scored four points to start a 8-1 run, ending with Spencer's 3-point­er, that put Auburn up 29-8 with 7:12 to play in. the half. The Tigers led by as many as 28 in the first half and were up 46-20 at the break. 
Jacksonville State committed 16 of' its 26 turnovers in the first half and never got closer than 22 points in the second half, at 53-31 with 16:48 to play. 
Mayes scored 16 points for the Jaguars, but also had a team-high eight turnovers. Lisa Baswell added 13 points. 
LeCoe Willingham scored 12 points and had a team-high 10 rebounds for Auburn. 
No. 1 Connecticut 73, 
Iowa 45 
Tamika Williams scored 18 points and Shea Ralph had 15 as top-ranked Connecticut, opening a season filled with huge expectations, pulled away in the second half to beat Iowa. 
The Connecticut men were 
ranked No. 1 when they Jost to 
Iowa 70-68 in their opener. 
The women, while not always 
sharp, never trailed in beating 
an Iowa team that made a 
game of it for a while despite 
missing its first 20 shots. 
Iowa did not make a field 
goal until Cara Consuegra hit a 
3-pointer from the top of the 
key with 8:37 left in the first 
half. But Connecticut, sloppy in 
its half-court offense, couldn't 
put the Hawkeyes away and 
led only 15-5 before Consuegra 
connected.

Eagles stand in path of Hokies' Sugar run 
Associated Press 

PHILADELPHIA Michael Vick has got New Orleans on his mind. 
No. 2 Virginia Tech's fresh­man quarterbar,k gave the most impressive performance yet of his young career in the 1-Jokies' 62-7° rout of Temple on Saturday. 
The victory moved them one step closer towards securing a berth for the national championship game at the Sugar Bowl. 
All Vick and the Hokies (10-0, 6-0 Big East) nAed to do now is defeat No. 22 Boston College on Friday and they're virtually assured a spot in the title game. Top­ranked florida State proba­bly locked up the other spot with a 30-23 win Saturday over No. 3 Florida. 
"It's something I've always dreamed of, one game away from playing for the national championship," Vick said. 
That wish will come true if Vick plays against BC the same way he dismantled the poor-tackling Owls (2-6, 2-3). He had 134 of Tech's 314 rushing yards (both season highs), ran for two scores and completed 7-of-10 pass­es for 171 yards and two more long touchdowns to Andre Davis. 
Plus, Vick got out of some tough jams in the pocket with his mobility to buy more time for big plays -like his 53­and 75-yard touchdown runs. 
Coming into the Temple game, Vick led the Big East in total offense with 218.6 yards per game. 
"Vick doesn't get tackled too much. It's jusl Michael Vick being Michael Vick. He does it anywhere at any­time," said running back /\ndre Kendrick, who ran for two SCOrllS. 
But the llokies didn't dw1i!I long on their hig win, which clinched at least a share of the Big East championship. 
"I'm not sure we can con­trol our own destiny. You check thosA computers late­ly?" Tech coach Frank Beamer said, referring to the Bowl Championship Series standings that are partly derived by computer rank­ings. 
"We can't worry about the BCS. We just got out and play," he said. 
Still, Tech's dominating performance probably helped them in the BCS, where they are ranked second. The top two teams in the BCS will play in the Sugar Bowl. 
Almost lost in the shadows of Vick's big game was the Hokies' swarming defense, which avenged a come-from­behind 28-24 loss to Temple last year when the Owls were a 35-point underdog.

Whirlwinds extinguish Pyros in triple-overtime epic 
By RACHEL BIBER 
Sports Wrirer 
All of the emotion, tension and highlights that are expected to unfold on the hallowed grounds of Notre Dame Stadium were witnessed on Sunday as the Whirlwinds of Welsh swept away the championship title from the Pyros of Pasquerilla East 18-12 in a sensational triple-overtime drama. 
After a shaky start by Welsh and a quick PE touchdown, the Pyros looked to continue their winning ways. On PE's first pos­session. Elizabeth Plummer con­nected with Melissa Gorman for a quick six points. But the Whirlwinds took the blow in stride, and Welsh quarterback Katie Rak unleashed an incrt>di­ble pass to wide receiver Vanessa LiChon to even the score. 
PE came out tiring in the sec­ond half but was halted bv the solid Welsh defense that· per­formed tremendously through­out the whole game. The Whirlwinds effectively halted the Pyro offense that had run over their opponents all season. 
"The defense played tremen­dous," Welsh coach Dave DePoister said. "Pushing Plummer back was huge -they played phenomenal." 
As the end of the second half wound down, the Whirlwinds threatened to score. but could not capitalize on their field posi­tion, forcing overtime. After a bomb from Welsh quarterback Rak to LiChon put the Whirlwinds within five yards of the goal line, the team could not overcome the barrier to the end zone. 
Rak attempted a quarterback sneak, but instead of ending up with six points, she was forced to the sideline with an ankle injury. Rak could only watch as quar­terback Stephanie Eden took over, and the Whirlwinds lost possession after a failed attempt for a touchdown on fourth down.

The Pyro defense remained strong, keeping its team in the run for the championship. 
"Our defense played really well," PE coach Dong Min said. "They kept us in the game." 
In the first overtime, Welsh forced PE to match its offensive spark. after Eden connected with LiChon for a touchdown. The Pyros were quick to answer when Plummer hit center Kristin Carey in the end zone to even the score at 12. Both teams failed to convert the extra point, sending the game into double overtime. 
The Pyros and Whirlwinds traded interceptions in the sec­ond overtime, forcing yet anoth­er overtime where the outcome would ultimately be decided. 
Welsh obtained the ball first in the third overtime, and success­fully pushed ahead of PE wheh Welsh wide receiver Alex Callan caught a touchdown pass from Eden. making the score 18-12. The potent Welsh defense denied PE any chance of scoring when two consecutive sacks pushed the Pyro offense back nearly to midfield. On fourth down. the Pyros hoped for a mir­acle, but were rejected when Plummer's attempted pass was batted down outside the end zone. 
Plummer's deflected pass sig­naled a wild celebration on the Whirlwind sideline as the team began to celebrate their first interhali championshlp title. The Pyros stood stunned, and watched as their bid for a third straight title was stripped from their grasp, by a team they had dominated earlier in the season. 
"Our team played pretty well," Pyro assistant coach Doug Kraft said. "It was a tough game. We knew that their team had come a long way." 
The Whirlwind coaches could not say enough about the effort and heart that their players put forth in the title game. 
"We are just really proud of our girls," DePoister said. "They 110 percent."

Defensive stand gives Knott first interhall chan1pionship 

By KEVIN BERCHOU 
Sports Writer 
Add the Knott Juggernauts to the litany of great intcrhall football champions. 
The Juggs staked their claim to being the best men's inter­hall team of 1999. as they blasted thl' Sorin Otters 24-6 in game played ln Notrn Damn Stadium under lhc walchful eyes of Touchdown Jesus. 
Knott's swarming defense proved to be the difference. After allowing the Otters to move the ball on the game's first possession, the Juggs' defense stiffened up and pres­sured them into committing five turnovors. 
It appeared as though as might be· time for Sorin to finally win a title after drop­ping two straight champi­onship duels, as the Ottnrs put together a spectacular opening drive. Quarterback Luke Beuerlein hit wideout Greg Carney on two huge fourth down plays. Bcuerlein capped the drive, which consumed a full 10 minutes, by calling his own number and scoring on a quarterback keeper from four yards out. A failed extra point attempt left the score at 6-0. 
Much to the dismay of the Otters, the Juggernauts con­trolled the tempo of the game form that point onward. Knott quickly moved to knot the score, scoring on their first possession. Running back Pat Virtue scored on a one-yard scamper to tie the score, before a successful kick gave the Juggs a lead they would never relinquish." 
"It was a sweep to the right," said Virtue of his score. "A hole opened up on the inside and I just cut it to the endzone." 
Having watched the offense gain the advantage, the Juggs vaunted defense sought to make a contribution of it's own. Dan Zach intercepted a tipped Beuerlein pass and wove his way 42 yards for the touchdown that proved the game's most crucial play. A converted extra point stretched the Knolt lead to 14­6. 
"The interception return was definitely the game's turning point," noted Knott captain and quarterback Mario Suarez. "We thought the game was pretty much ov11r from th<'re." 

Sorin never sncmecl to rncov­er. After getting the ball hack. the Otters were largely ind­f'ective in moving tlrn ball us tho Juggs' pass rush was rn l11 n t I 11 s s iII its p u rs II l t of Bouerlein.

The Otters' passing attack took a sevorn hit when l'r1)sh­rn an star Greg Carney sus­tained an injury to his lid'l hand. Carney was nol his dom­inant self throughout much of tho game, but showBcl grit in hanging in the game). 
Knott's play in the second half mirrored its efforts in the first. Once again tho defense moved to suffocate the highly touted Otter attack. The Juggs' defense picked off one morn Beuerlein toss and recovered two Otter fumbles to negate any chance Sorin had of get­ting back into the game. 
The Juggs added a field goal to cap the scoring, leaving the scoreboard at the north end of the stadium reading Knott 24, Sorin 6. 
"We're the better team," said Suarez. "We have bntter players that made plays and that's why we wern able to vvin. 11 
"Our defense played very well," he added. "We pres­sured Beuerlein the whole game. We just didn't givn him any lime. We know they couldn't win ii' we didn't giw them any time."

W.Soccer 
continued from page 20 
"It has always seemed like the halls have gone off posts against us," Beene said. "But this game it was our luck with the posts." 
Irish head coach Randy Waldrum was surprised that a penalty kick was called so late 
in the game. A Stanford cross took a funny bounce and struck an Irish player in the hand in the box. When a simi­lar situation happened a minute later against the Cardinal, the referee did not call a penalty shot for the Irish. 
"I was really surprised he called the PK [penalty kick]," Waldrum said. "Usually in a tight game like that he lets the players decide it on the field. I was surprised by that espe­cially when he didn't call the handball in the box on the other end. That's part of the game. You've got to deal with it and we caught a break on it. Maybe it was just our night." 
The night belonged to the

 Irish defense, who limited the Cardinal to nine shots in the shutout. While in the past few weeks the Irish defense seemed unorganized, Friday's game saw a much more solid Irish defense. "Defensively it was very good tonight," Waldrum said. "I thought we were pretty
·­
good defensively in the mid­field especially in the second half and that was the part l have been the most disap­pointed with in the past few games." 
Defender Kelly Lindsey gave credit for the better defensive effort to the mictlield. 
"It felt a lot more coordinat­ed in the second half mostly because of our center mid­l'ielders," the junior captain said. "They started picking up their marks and their runs more so we didn't have as many to deal with up top." 
The shutout pitched by the Irish defense was nearly matched by Cardinal defense. Thanks to six saves by Cardinal goalkeeper Carly Smolak, Stanford held Notre Dame scoreless for 81 min­utes. 
"Carly is one of the best in the country," Swanson said. "I thought she controlled things pretty well for us back there." 
Sarkesian broke the score­less tie with a hard shot to the upper right corner that Smolak had no chance on. Jen Grubb began the scoring play when she shot a free kick from the left side of the goal across the front of the net. Senior for­ward Jenny Heft deflected the pass toward the net but the shot was cleared by a Stanford player. Sarkesian collected the failed clear and blasted it back toward the net for the game winner. 
"The ball rebounded out to me," Sarkesian said. "I took a touch and saw the right side of the goal open to me. I just shot it there and I put it in." 
Sarkesian's late goal kicked off a desperate attack by the Cardinal. With less than 10 minutes remaining in the game, the Cardinal went for broke and pressed the Irish defense hard to try and get a tying goal. 
"It got a little tense," Lindsey said. "Right after we scored they put three forwards up and they ran at us with their midfielders. So we were just trying to get out mifield back and reorganize." 
Thanks to intelligent clock management by Waldrum, who substituted frequently in the last few minutes to keep his team fresh and run a few extra seconds off the clock. Finally, the last seconds ticked off the clock and the Irish sur­vived with a 1-0 victory. 
The win advances Notre Dame to the NCAA quarterfi­nals Friday, where they will face Nebraska for the right to move on to the final four in San Jose, Calif. 
W. B-ball

started in the second half', but incurred her fourth foul less than fivp minutes in and fin­ished the game scoreless. 
Riley's absence on the court altered Notre Dame's game plan. Even without the power­ful post play of the prcseason first team All-American, the Irish were able to compensate with an effective outside game. 
''Other players stepped it up on the court," said Hatay. "Danielle played really well off 
the  bench  and  Niole  was  
shooting  well  the  whole  
game."  .  

Saturday's game marked the second time this season that the Irish stepped on the court without Riley at thP helm. Sidelined with a slight injury to her right ankle last week, Riley sat on the bench dming the team's final exhibition game of the preseason. 
Notre Dame broke open a close game 10 minutes into the first half when back-to­back three pointers by Ratay gave the Irish a 21-13 lead over TolPdo. 
Center Julie Henderson tapped in a layup with less than six minutes left in the half to put the Irish out in front by 10 with a score of 31­
21. A patient offense and scrappy defense helped keep the Irish in control throughout the rest of the game as the Rockets were unable to bring their point deficit into single digits after Henderson's score. 
"It was our first game and we came out strong," said Ratay. "They were a good team. They had some good players, but we just focused on doing our best." 
Green and Ivey kept the Rockets' defense scrambling, as the two guards combined for 29 points. 
Ericka Haney, coming off the bench at the guard position, rounded out the Irish back­court, registering 11 points from the field. 


After coming off a strong '98-'99 campaign, Toledo lost three key starters to gradua­tion, which took its toll on their offense in their first out­ing of the season. Ce.nter Jennifer Markwood led the team with 14 points, followed closely by forward Karin

Stanford coach Steve Swanson said Irish lore may have played a factor in the final shot. 
"Maybe it was the luck of the Irish," he said. "Ronnie scored so many goals from free kicks, I don't faull her at all. It was just one of those things that happened. It was maybe a millimeter off." 

Beene was glad the bounces finally went Notre Dame's way and the Irish found a bit of luck. JOHN DAILYrThe Observer

Freshman Ratay leads ND past Toledo 
By KERRY SMITH Assistant Sports Editor 

The Irish backcourt lit the spark that blasted the Rockets Saturday night, when Notre Dame opened its season against Toledo with a 68-52 win on the road. 
While a base of four return­ing starters to the Irish squad were key in providing experi­ence and continuity on the court in the prescason, a fresh face on the team has already begun to make her 
mark. 

Freshman guard Alicia Ratay, who led the Irish in her. first regular-season colle­giate start with 18 points, is already proving that experi­ence is not the only strength or the seventh-ranked Irish. Ratay·s developing deadly three-pointer, should add to an already-talented set of Irish guards anchored by vet­erans Niele Ivey and Danielle Green.
