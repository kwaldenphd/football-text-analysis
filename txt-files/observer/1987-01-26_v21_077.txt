Gipper, elusive quarterback key to Super Scandal Sunday 



The Iran-Contra arms scandal has been 
brewing for nearly two months and already the 
spectators are getting restless and bored. Pol­
lsters now estimate that only twenty percent of 
the American public is following the issue with 
daily interest, and this of course could lead to 
second rate commercials between newscasts. 
Some say that the scandal has become noth­ing more than a feeding frenzy for democratic media sharks, while others argue that a ple­thora of legal investigations threaten to prevent a timely and just resolution of the controversy. What is certain is that the fans want quick ac­tion and a big play. To see the Reagan admin­istration stalled over an objectionable call seems to many fans a waste of precious sports­spectating time. 
On the contrary, what we have seen until now has only been the first quarter of a very exciting Super Scandal Sunday. 
There seems to be some confusion as to the extent of the field and the number of players involved. This is because such multi-syllabic names as Khashoggi, Rafsangani, and Ghor­banifar do not quite fit across the back of a football jersey. Filthy accusations and a muddy field also make it difficult to see who's on which side. 
Not withstanding the dirty shortcomings of the remarkable tear-away jerseys which every­one deliberately wears, we must also notice that none of the players wears a proper helmet. Indeed, too many bear the classic symptoms of serious head injury. Even the unflappable Gip­per himself seems dazed and out of breath. 
By traditional standards the quarterback is the key man on the field. In this match-up such honor arguably falls to Oliver North, home­town boy and All-American hero. Even though Ollie's name was not quite so prominent early in the season it now seems that he was indeed responsible for many of the big plays. Long time fans must attribute to North's credit bold moves not only in Iran but also in Israel, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, and Honduras. His swift moves fooled not only the opponents but even his own teammates in Washington. Ollie carried the ball so fast and so well that no one claims even to have seen him. 
The embarrassing fumble of late November not only made the Reagan team forfeit the ball but now might mean serious peanlties as well. For reasons unknown, other than Ollie's sudden rashness, tl'le coach immediately removed his star quarterback from the game. What long­time fans now need to know is whether North has been this one-man miracle-machine or whe­ther others have also held the ball. Specifically, has North followed Reagan's commands or made up his own plays on the line?

board to graphically illustrate the past few plays. Such mistakes are certainly embarrass­ing for the head coach. After all, how could the head coach not know what his team was doing? Or even worse, could the coach have actually ordered his team to deliberately violate the rules? In either event, the Super Scandal weekend is shaping up to be a major defeat for the Reagan team. 
In a game of football such mistakes are em­barrassing, but none-the-less understandable. Stupidity, cheating, and even deliberate un­sportsmanlike conduct will sooner or later be forgiven as merely part of the game. But foreign policy is obviously a wholly different and far more complicated matter. 
The football metaphor serves only to further the interest of those who would rather flip to a sports channel than watch the Washington ac­tion. And after all, the analogy is one much in 
. line with the Gipper's line of thought. The evil empire is clearly the opponent in the Reagan game, and one for whom the etiquette of sports­manship need not apply. 
In the past the President has worked his magic by convincing the audience that they were really watching a game. He has played the mythical Gipper role quite well. But now that his team has blundered he knows nothing of their shortcomings. Reagan fires the quar­terback and then passes the problem and blame on to others. Meanwhile he and his prostate are injured, sidelined, and silent. The remaining time will certainly not be boring.

Students join in Washington march 
By BUD LUEPKE 
Copy Editor 
A band of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's pro-lifers arrived home this weekend after braving snowstorms and police opposition to participate in the fourteenth annual march on Washington protesting the 1973 Supreme Court decision to legalize abortion. 
Theresa Harrington, vice president of the Right to Life Club at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, said four Saint Mary's students and six students from Notre Dame chartered a bus to Washington D.C. with pro-life activists from Valparaiso. Har­rington said the bus arrived in the nation's capital at 10:30 
a.m. last Thursday, Jan. 22, the fourteenth anniversary of the Supreme Court's controversial Roe vs. Wade decision. 
According to Harrington, the fifteen inches of snow that fell the night before they arrived closed the entire city and prompted organizers to "offi­cially cancel" the march. 
However, the Notre Dame­Saint Mary's group and an es­timated 5000 other protestors were not deterred by the wea­ther. "We said we came all this way and we're going to do it," said Harrington. 
Harrington said the protes­tors assembled in a park be­hind the White House to listen to a message from President Reagan and law-makers and then marched to the steps of the Supreme Court. 
There, Harrington said "police with billy clubs" were used to prevent a demonstra­tion by the marchers. Cathy Flynn, a protestor from Saint Mary's, said, "The cops were giving us a hard time, telling us it was illegal. No one left; we just laughed at the cops." 
However, H~rrington said she thought "at least 40 people did get arrested." 
According to Harrington, five fetuses were brought to the demonstration by "extreme factions." She also said every abortion clinic in Washington was shut down by sit-in protests. 
But Harrington said she does not approve of such tactics. "Personally I don't like those kinds of points. Generally, the demonstration was peaceful." 
Harrington described the pro-life cause as a "war on apathy.'' She said 5000 abor­tions are performed every day without mention from the media. "We're on the offensive and we will be there every year until the law is changed," she said. 
The Right to Life Club met with Rep. John Hiler, R-Ind., for 45 minutes before the march. Harrington said that Hiler said he was "99 percent behind us. I didn't ask what the other one percent was." Flynn said Hiler "was great, really supportive." 
Harrington said fewer Notre Dame and Saint Mary's stu­dents participated in the march this year than in previous years. Noting her club sent 35 students on its own bus last year, Harrington said the smaller number of students this year could be attributed to ''a young club that is rebuild­ing" from the loss of its senior officers who graduated last year. 
Harrington said snow prolonged the trip home to 20 hours. But Harrington and Flynn agreed the effort was worthwhile. "It was really worth it. I know everyone who went will want to go again next year," Harrington said. 

Anti-abortion demonstrators from around the country participate in a pro-life march on Washington last Thursday marking the 14th anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision to legalize abor­tion. See related story at left.

Awareness week hosted by minority concerns group 
By ANGELLE GOUDEAU 
News staff 
The Minority Concerns Committee has slated Janu­ary 26-30 as "Minorities Awareness Week." 
Instead of hosting a num­ber of events, the committee will sponsor a series of arti­cles in the Viewpoint section of the Observer, a lecture, and a meeting on the Black Women's coalition. 
"There are fewer events this year," said Lisa Boykin, Minority Concerns commis­sioner, "primarily because minority-related functions are usually not well­attended by either the white students or the minority stu­dents." The committee said it believes that utilizing the Observer Viewpoint section will be more conducive to its objectives than a number of expensive and ill-attended events. 
Boykin said the committee would also like to call atten­tion to the divestment issue. "We feel it is a moral out­rage that the premiere Cath­olic institution of the world would condone such an in­humane system as apar­theid by continuing to invest in South Africa," Boy kin said. 
On Wednesday, Jan. 28 at 7:00p.m. in the Memorial Li­brary, guest lecturer Jacob Carruthers, director of the Kemetic Institute in Chicago, will speak on "The Relationship between An­cient Egyptian Civilization and Greek Philosophy." In his research, Carruthers has attempted to prove that what has been recognized as Greek philosophy was in fact stolen and adapted from the Egyptians of black origin. 
On Friday at 7:00p.m. in the Black Cultural Arts council office, the recently organized Network of United Sisters (N.O.U.S) will ad­dress issues confronting black women at Notre Dame. The meeting is to be conducted by Rosemary Phelps of the University Counseling Center. 
The Minorities Concerns Committee said it equated student involvement with change. "Understanding is certainly the first step in remedying this current crisis," Boy kin.

Theologians discuss integrity, unity 
Special to The Observer 
Some fifty Catholic bishops, prominent theologians and academic administrators held a colloquium last week at Notre Dame to discuss their relation­ships and respective roles in the Church. 
Much of their discussion con­cerned the responsibilities of the three offices for the main­tenance of doctrinal integrity and Church unity, especially as these were affected by the teaching of theology at Catholic colleges and universities. 
According to Father David Burrell, professor of philoso­phy and of theology at Notre Dame and convenor of the group, "the entire meeting of­fered an opportunity for us to learn from one another about our diverse roles. 
"In that spirit, we were able to explore further ways of col­laborating as well as procedures for unscrambling situations of potential con­flict," he said. "The ability of a group like this to address such delicate issues candidly 
offers fresh hope for the Amer­
ican Church." 
Participants in the meeting 
included Father Theodore Res­
burgh, president of the Univer­
sity of Notre Dame; Father Ed­
ward Malloy, president-elect of 
Notre Dame; Father James 
Burtchaell, professor of theol­
ogy and former provost of 
Notre Dame; Father Richard 
McBrien, chairman of the de­
partment of theology at Notre 
Dame; and Father Richard 
McCormick, professor of theol­
ogy at Notre Dame. 
Also attending were Father 
Thomas Oddo, president of the 
University of Portland; Bishop 
William McManus, former bis­
hop of Fort Wayne-South Bend. Others who attended the meeting were Father John Alesandro, chancellor of the diocese of Rockville Center, New York; Father Raymond Baumhart, president of Loyola University of Chicago; Father Michael Buckley, professor of theology at Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley; Father Donald Buggert, professor of 
theology at Washington 
Theological Union; Father William Byron, president of Catholic University of America; Father John Cole­man, protessor of social ethics at Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley; Monsignor John Egan, director of the Office of Human Relations and Ecumenism for the Archdiocese of Chicago; Car­dinal John Dearden, retired archbishop of Detroit; Raymond Fitz, president of the University of Dayton; Sally Furay, provost of the Univer­sity of San Diego; Alice Gallin, executive director of the Asso­ciation of Catholic Colleges and Universities; Ann Gannon, pro­fessor of philosophy and former president of Mundelein College; Father Timothy Hea­ly, president of Georgetown University; and Father Bryan Hehir, general secretary for justice and peace at the United States Catholic Conference.

Cultural diversity enhances all-white campus 
In 1987 it is no secret that the white college environment is one of enormous stress for many minority students. They worry that assimilating into the mainstream might mean surrendering their cultural identity. In the class­room, minority students lack role models because of the lack of minority faculty, and they are closed out of in­formal networks of communication that speed academic progress. Most of all they must constantly deal with suspicion by peers and faculty that they are somehow unworthy of being in the academic community. Too many col­leges do not provide programs for emo­tional and social support systems for healthy self-development. This lack of support has caused many minority stu­dents to perform below their abilities. 
Kenneth B. Durgans 
guest column 

Despite the many problems associr ated with being a minority student on a predominantly white campus, the numbers attending these institutions continues to increase. In light of the many recent studies showing that black colleges are probably more conducive to total intellectual and social growth, many questions have to be addressed. First, should black students be urged to consider predominantly black insti­tutions as an option; I say yes. The second, since the reality is more black students are choosing to attend predominantly white institutions, how do we create an environment more con­ducive to success? 
First let us examine the problem by looking at the word "minority." It means a racial religious, political or other group regarded as different from the larger group of which it is a part (American Heritage Dictionary). Many times this word is used to sepa­rate people rather than unify. In other words to be a minority implies the exis­tence of a dominant group. This group usually overlooks or excludes the minority, while the minority desperately tries to assert recognition. This usually causes conflict. The majority group often takes the position of cultural superiority. They insist that the minority people's diverse cultures be divested so that those people can be assimilated into one big Euro­American culture. Such thesis is clearly prejudice or racism. Racists view cultural diversity as a threat, thus, something that cannot be tolerated. 
Our college and environment can only be improved when the majority/ dominant culture accepts the thesis that cultural diversity is alright. When students whether :Black, Chinese, Mexican or whatever choose to hang together it may be cultural. That these and other statements are not necessar­ily anti-white or anti-anything. If cul­tural differences are accepted and recognized as indispensable to a community, then the campus can expe­rience cultural harmony. This may sound idealistic but, like another fa­mous American whose birthday we just celebrated, I chose to be a Dreamer. 


The role of a counselor is difficult to duplicate 
This article is the first in a series to be written by staff members of the Uni­versity Counseling Center (UCC). The topics we'll be addressing will be Sexual Choices, Careers, Alcohol, and Constructive Caring. This first article is really an introduction to counseling in general and the U.C.C. in particular. 
Patrick Utz 
guest column 

As much as we hate to admit it to ourselves, there are times when all of us get overwhelmed by the stresses we encounter in life. This can be especially true during the colle"ge years when we begin to confront so many new issues of adulthood. Most of us are hesitant to reach out for help unless things get to a crisis stage because we feel we "should" be strong enough to handle our own problems. This attitude contri­butes to a kind of stigma that has 
Doonesbury 
developed around going to the U.C.C. 
Taking the first step in making an appointment to see a counselor is not easy and people think of lots of reasons not to do it. Sometimes we may turn to a friend for help in sorting out our ques­tions or problems, but that may not al­ways be appropriate. The relationship a client develops with a counselor is a very special one that is hard to dupli­cate with a friend. Whether you see a counselor only one time or once a week for several weeks, he or she is inter­ested in only you during that time to­gether. In addition to helping you focus your energies in resolving your issues, a counselor is objective and your ses­sions are strictly confidential, which may not always be true with a friend. 
The staff at the U.C.C. are profes­sionals trained to work with university students. We deal with a wide range of concerns from time management, or career counseling, or overcoming shy­ness, or improving one's self-concept and ability to make friends, to more serious issues such as the loss of a sig­nificant person in one's life, eating problems, or depression. We see clients either in a one-to-one session or in a group session depending on the nature of the student's concerns. While stu­dents often feel they want individual counseling, there are many times when a group is much more beneficial to them. Some people come to the U.C.C. just for the groups we offer and we're expanding those offerings all the time. This semester we have the following groups available: Alcohol & Drug Abuse Prevention Training (ADAPT) ; Coed Weight Group; Adult Children of Alcoholic Parents (CAP); Relationship Group; Eating Disorders Group; Per­sonal Growth Group. 
Another word needs to be said about confidentiality. Even though the U.C.C. is part of the University of Notre Dame, we adhere to Indiana state law and the American Psychological Association's

ethics guidelines in keeping students' files stri~tly confidential. This means that you don't need to worry about your visit to the U.C.C. going on your school record. Except in rare instances where there is a danger of personal harm to oneself or others, no one ever knows you have even come in, unless you tell them. 
Chances are that when you're looking back on your college years, a few years from now, you won't even remember some of the intense concerns and crises you've lived through. Memory has a unique way of coloring our past in bright or neutral shades rather than in the more somber colors which would reflect some of our pain. For a growing number of students those positive memories will include the rewarding experience of working with a skilled and helpful counselor. 
Dr. Patrick Utz is the director of the University Counseling Center.

ound mind, sound body. This goal of most Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students is also the motto of a prominent South Bend athletic club. Lo­cated on 53666 N.

By the end of this week, the club will com­plete Its half-million dollar facility -the rlrst Indoor soccer rleld in the state.

Individuals wishing to join can register at the above times with we'd like to see more students get involved. The Notre Dame in­tramural program is strong. but with little emphasis on soccer. Maybe we could help change all that." Grauel said. 
American South Bend Turner's began I 25 years ago as a predominantly German social club and gradually evolved into an athletic club as well, with a broad membership. The club was originally located in down­town South Bend and moved to Ironwood in 1974. 
The club's facilities cover 13 acres, 35,000 feet of which are enclosed under roof. The many sports facilities include a full gymnasium and gymnastics in­struction, basketball, volleyball, racquetball, handball and tennis courts, aerobics areas, two softball diamonds, saunas and 
12 bowling lanes as well as the new Indoor soccer rleld.

The club's hours are Monday­Saturday from 8 a.m. to mid­night and Sunday from 12:30 to

"We are not the Y which is strictly athletic or the Elks which is mainly social, but an agreeable cross between the two. We com­bine physical and social aspects. and cater to all ages and all sexes. We think student involve­ment will be an asset to the club. A number of Notre Dame teams have shown an interest in the new indoor soccer rleld as well as our other facilities. Student participation is always wel­come," said Grauel. 
And so American South Bend Turner's upholds its more than century old traditions and con­tinues to innovate for the future. It Is their motto that remains forever unchanged: "Sound mind, sound body." There is no substitute.

Giants

yard line the first three times 
we touched the ball. We felt 
going in we couldn't get in a 
scoring contest with them." 
Most of Simms' handiwork 
came after a first half in which 
Denver outplayed the Giants, 
who were favored by 10 points, 
going off with a 10-9 lead that 
easily could have been 20-7 or 
20-9. Early in the second quar­
ter, New York held Denver 
without a point after the 
Broncos had a first-and-goal 
from their 1 and Rich Karlis 
missed field goals from 23 and 
34 yards for Denver, one after 
that goal-line stand. 

So dominant was Elway in 
the second period that he ac­
counted for 200 yards on his 
own -187 passing and 13 rush­
ing. That was 13 yards more 
than Denver's total offense 
when sacks are figured in. 
Then came the third quarter, 
in which the Giants outgained 
the Broncos by 163 yards to 2, 
scoring 17 points. From the 
time the Broncos led 10-9 until 
the Giants led 33-10, Denver 
was held without a first down, 
going out 1-2-3-punt on two oc­
casions and Elway throwing an 
interception on the other. 
After Simms' third-quarter 
TD pass to Bavaro, Denver, 
which went the entire third 
quarter without calling a run­
ning play, went 1-2-3-punt. The 
punt was returned 25 yards by 
Phil McConkey to the Denver 36. Eight plays later, Raul Al­legre's 21-yard field goal made it 19-10. 
Again Denver went 1-2-3­punt, and again New York scored, going 68 yards in four plays with Joe Morris running over from 1 yard out following a 44-yard flea-flicker pass from Simms to McConkey. 
Elvis Patterson intercepted an Elway pass the next time, setting up a 6-yard scoring pass from Simms to McConkey. The ball bounced off tight end Mark Bavaro's hands and helmet, right into the hands of McConkey, who did a victory dance and ran off the field with the ball. 
This was the fifth time in six years that an NFC team has won the Super Bowl. The last AFC team was the Los Angeles Raiders in 1984. The Giants won their three postseason games by a total score of 105-23, beating San Francisco 49-3 and Washington 17-0 en route to their first NFL title since 1956. 
From then on it was garbage time. Ottis Anderson had a 1­yard TD run for New York. Karlis had a 29-yard field goal for Denver, and Elway threw 46-yards to Vance Johnson for a consolation TD late in the game. 
Denver took a 3-0 lead on the 
first possession of the game on 
Karlis' 48-yard field goal. 
Elway was the prime mover on the drive, scrambling 10 yards for a first down on the first play, then hitting Mark Jackson for 24 yards on a third­and-7 from his own 39. 
But the Giants came right back, with a 78-yard, 9-play drive on which Simms went 6­for-6 for 69 yards. It culminated with his 6-yard toss to Zeke Mowatt with 5:27 left in the quarter. 
Then it was Denver's turn. 
The Broncos moved 58 yards in six plays to set up Elway's 4-yard TD run on a quarterback draw with 2:06 left in the quar­ter. It was the first touchdown allowed by the Giants in the postseason and followed a double penalty on New York­a late hit by Harry Carson and an unsportsmanlike conduct call on Lawrence Taylor that put the ball at the 6. 
The first quarter ended with the two quarterbacks a com­bined 13 for 13. Elway was 6­for-6 for 68 yards and Simms 7-for-7 for 76 yards. 
The game may have turned on the next series. 
Denver, sparked by Elway's 54-yard completion to Johnson, drove 79 yards on its next pos­session to the Giants 1. But Taylor dumped Elway for a 1­yard loss on first down. Gerald Willhite was stopped for no gain, and Carson and Carl Banks dumped Winder for a 3­yard loss on third down. 
Then Karlis' 24-yard field goal attempt went wide right. 
The New York defense 
asserted itself again on the next 
series, when Martin, who had 
returned an Elway pass for a 
touchdown in their first 
meeting, dumped the Denver 
quarterback in the end zone for 
a safety.

game. Rivers scored 15 of his team-high 20 points in the second half and came up with some key steals and loose balls early in the half to help the Irish to their lead. And until the last four minutes, his ballhan­dling keyed the Irish against the continual UCLA press. But in the end, Rivers finished with 10 turnovers. 
"I thought for 36 minutes, we played very, very well," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps. "In the last four minutes, we didn't execute the press. I thought we were in great shape when we were up by 11, but when I started to see the calls going their way, I got worried. It was a tough loss, but we'll be back. 

" "This is one of the best UCLA team:> I've seen in a while as far as the way they go after it. They're the best I've seen in five or six years." 
The Irish had led since the 

16: 37 mark of the opening half. They had built the lead by resorting to a tactic that has worked for them before -a deliberate tempo to slow down a faster team like the Bruins. Irish shooting, which had been ice cold of late, was warmed by the Southern California sun. The Irish shot 53.7 percent (22­of-41 shooting) for the game, with many of their buckets coming with time running down on the shot clock. 
"Their offense didn't really frustrate us-it put us to sleep," said Miller. "We like to run like the Lakers, but it just seemed like Rivers would come across half -court, pass the ball around for 30 or 40 seconds and then hit a shot. But the press helped change the tempo and got us into our game." 
And it was the Bruin press which keyed the comeback, as they changed from a 2-2-1 to 1­2-1-1 to create more turnovers which came in bundles. Over the final3:08, UCLA outscored Notre Dame 17-2 as the Irish had problems getting the ball upcourt, commiting six turn­overs with the game on the line which led to easy UCLA scores. 
In the end, the Irish could only look on, stunned, as the
.. 
Pauley Pavilion crowd cele­brated The Shot, which Miller knew he had all the way. 
IRISH ITEMS -Following the victory, Hazzard said that the UCLA-Notre Dame series is very good for college basket­ball and a series that would go on for years and years. Last year after Notre DarnEr defeated UCLA, 74-64, Hazzard said he didn't know if he wanted to play Notre Dame again .

Karlis' missed field goals typical of missed opportunities for Denver 
Associated Press 
PASADENA, Calif.-John El­way did everything but kick for the Denver Broncos in yester­day's Super Bowl. 
They might wish he had done that, too. 
Elway's running and passing had staked the Broncos to a 10-7 first-quarter lead, but two missed field goal attempts by Rich Karlis in the second quar­ter wrecked Denver's momen­tum. The New York Giants pushed across 30 points in the last half to rout the Broncos 39­20. 
Karlis kicked a 48-yard field goal on the opening series of the game, tying a Super Bowl record for the longest three­pointer. It also was Karlis' lOth straight field goal, including one in overtime in the AFC championship game against Cleveland that sent the Broncos into the Super Bowl. 
But on subsequent attempts of 23 and 34 yards against the Giants, he was wide right, leaving Denver with a slim 10-9 halftime edge and opening the door for New York's second­half outburst. 
Karlis, with his head in his hands and choking back tears in the locker room, said, "I just pushed them. I blocked them off to the right. I didn't get my hips through. It's like when you play golf and you don't get through the ball and you put it into the woods on the right." 
Karlis said the snap and hold were good on both aborted at­tempts. 
"I just feel like I let everyone down," he said. "I think I really hurt us. I pride myself on making big kicks, and those were big kicks. 
"I hit the 48-yarder as good as I've hit a ball. We didn't want to waste many opportuni­ties today, but I did. I don't think it was pressure but maybe I was a little anxious." 
The Broncos actually blew a prime touchdown opportunity preceding Karlis' first miss. Elway's 54-yard pass to Vance Johnson helped move the Broncos to the Giants' one. But three running plays lost five yards, and Karlis' 23-yarder sailed wide. 
Denver got to the Giants' 16 on a subsequent march before the half, but after two incom­plete passes, Karlis missed again just outside the upright. 
"I thought we should have scored about 10 more points in the first half," Denver Coach Reeves said. "We knew going into the game that if we didn't take advantage of every oppor­tunity we had, we would be in tough shape. We missed a couple of field goals and got first and goal at the 1 and didn't score." 
Denver linebacker Tom Jack­son, playing in his second Super Bowl for the Broncos, said Karlis "didn't lose the game for 
us. If not for Rich, we wouldn't 
even be here." 
Karlis converted a field goal 
in overtime to lift the Broncos 
past Cleveland 23-20 in the AFC 
championship game two weeks 
ago. 
"I'm sure Rich feels bad " 
Jackson said. "The syndro~e . when you lose in the Super Bowl is usually to blame your­self. I feel I lost the game be­
cause I didn't play much." 
Jackson suffered a knee in­
jury midway through the 
second quarter and didn't 
return. 
"I don't know the extent of it 
yet," he said. 
Elway completed 22 of 37 
passes for 304 yards, throwing 
a 47-yard TD pass to Johnson 
late in the game and running 4 
yards on a quarterback draw 
in the first quarter.

Phelps voices displeasure with refs, but Richardson thinks differently 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
LOS ANGELES -If Notre Dame head coach Digger Phelps had a song on his mind following Saturday's 63-59 loss at UCLA, it may have been Three Blind Mice dedicated to Charles Range, Willis McJunkin and Mark Reischling -the three Pac-10 officials who refereed the game. 
"I felt that in the last four minutes, I don't think we got one call from the officials,'' said Phelps. "It was the worst Pac-10 officiating I've had here in Pauley in 16 years. There was a lot of bumping and shoving going on. If you're going to call it, call it both ways. I just think it went their way." 
Particularly galling to Phelps was a charging call on David Rivers with three seconds left in the game. After Reggie Miller bottomed out a three-pointer from 28 (or more) feet, Rivers drove the length of the court and headed down the lane. What happened next was either a solid defen­sive play or a lousy call depend­ing on whose bench you sat on. 
UCLA's Dave Immel slid over to seal the lane and Rivers moved off to his left, making contact. The officials whistled Rivers for the offensive foul. 
"The last play was not a charge," said Phelps. 
"(Rivers) should have been going to the foul line for one­and-one, but instead they just let the calls go." 
Two other rulings also proved costly to the Irish in the final few minutes. With 48 seconds left and the Irish up four, Donald Royal drove to the hole and slammed it over Kevin Walker. Royal was called for charging and as Phelps protested in vain, the officials waved off the basket. 
The second call, or no call as it was, was the costliest to Phelps' squad. As Mark Stevenson brought the ball up against UCLA pressure, he fell to floor and lost the ball to Mil­ler, who hit the game-winner seconds later. 
"I thought Mark got tripped 
on that play and lost the ball," 
Phelps argued. "(Miller) goes 
down and shoots the three-point 
play because we can't get 
people back there to stop him 
and Stevenson's on the floor. 
"(The officiating) was really 
different. I've had some situa­
tions here that have been nega­
tive, but this is by far the worst 
I've ever seen it in Pauley 
Pavilion. That's a shame be­
cause it was a great game and 
it shouldn't have ended that 
way." 
Phelps declined to comment 
if he believed that it was the 
referees who had cost his team, 
but he did have advice for the 
assembled reporters. 
"You take a look at the replay of the last four minutes and tell me if I'm wrong," said Phelps. "I think you people saw what I saw." 
But when reporters told TJCLA point guard Pooh Rich­ardson about Phelps' com­ments, Richardson sang a dif­ferent tune. 
"I think that with his point guard turning over the ball 10 times -and I think five times in the last four minutes -how could you blame the referees?" asked Richardson. "On top of that, I remember when we went down there last year there was a replay and (former Irish forward Tim) Kempton was out-of-bounds saving a ball be­hind his back, which led to a five-point swing. Nobody com­plained about that, and were getting ready to pull out that game out. 
"I thought I was fouled on 
one three-point play. They 
counted the basket, but then 
they said it was an offensive 
foul. I didn't feel that was the 
right play, but I didn't argue 
with the refs." 
"I didn't hear him," contin­ued Richardson. "It sounds like he's pretty bitter. I think people can lose better than that just like people can win. I didn't hear anything mentioned about the refs last year, and I was pretty mad. I think people can lose better than that."

Associated Press 

Reggie Williams' 3-point field goal with 28 seconds remammg yesterday high­lighted a 13-1 run that gave Georgetown a 74-71 victory over previously unbeaten and sixth-ranked DePaul. 
No.15 Georgetown trailed 70­61 with 2:44 remaining, but guard Mark Tillmon connected on a pair of 3-point baskets to cut the deficit to 70-67. A free throw by the Blue Demons' Dallas Comegys made it 71-67, but Tillmon hit a running one­bander to put Georgetown within two. After DePaul's Rod Strickland missed the front end of a one-and-one, Williams hit his game-winning shot from the right corner. 

After a DePaul turnover on a botched inbounds play, Wil­liams made two free throws with 16 seconds remaining. Comegys tried a three-point field goal with five seconds remaining, but the shot bounced off the rim and the Blue Demons were losers after 16 straight victories. 
Williams led Georgetown, 14­2, with 23 points and Tillmon added 19. 
Comegys scored 19 for DePaul, and Strickland added 18. Kentucky 80, Navy 69 
Rex Chapman scored 22 points and Kentucky defeated Navy in a nonconference game despite the 45-point perfor­mance of the Middies' David 
Robinson.  The  45  points  
equalled  Robinson's  career  
high  and  set  a  Rupp  Arena  

scoring mark, topping the 37 points by Freeman Williams of Portland State on Dec. 16, 1977. 
Navy fell to 13-5, while Ken­tucky, which has won four of its last five games, is 11-5.

Danny Manning's 30 points lifted Kansas over North Carolina State in a noncon­ference game in Kansas City. Kansas opened a 10-point lead late in the first half behind Manning's 16 points, and State fell behind 53-42 with 9:52 left after missing six of its first seven shots in the second half.

Track team turns back Spartans in meet that tough on the records 

By PETE GEGEN Assistant Sports Editor 
In a meet filled with record­breaking performances, the Notre Dame indoor track team downed Michigan State, 78-53, Friday night. 
In all, six meet records, two Notre Dame records, and one ACC record were established by the two schools. 
Irish shot putter Tom Krause set the tone early in the evening by setting a meet record and qualifying for the IC4A's with a toss of 54 feet, 2-3-'8 inches. Robert Fitzgerald took second. 
The Spartan's Mark Ingram continued the record-breaking by winning the 60-yard high hurdles in 7.3 seconds, a new meet record. Notre Dame's Glenn Watson, who was slow getting out of the blocks, took second. 
Perhaps the most exciting race of the evening was the 60­yard dash. Michigan State's Derrick Leonard won the race, set an ACC record and qualified for the NCAA championships with a time of 6.18. He edged Notre Dame's Tim Brown and Tony Ragunas, who both set school records and qualified for the IC4A's with identical hand­held times of 6.23. Once again the start hurt the Irish as Brown's start was termed by Head Coach Joe Piane as "sin­ful." Notre Dame's Mike Rogan then set a meet record in the mile with 9 time of 4: 15.7. He edged teammate and fellow New Yorker Mike O'Conner by two-tenths of a second. 
Three more meet records were set by the two teams. Mic­higan State's Chuck Cullen won the high jump with a mark of six feet, nine inches, while Chris Camponovo and Chris Matteo of Notre Dame tied for the pole vault record at 14 feet, six inches. Finally, Dan Gar­rett won the two-mile run with a time of 9:12.2. 
In other races, co-captains Jeff Van Wie and Robert Nobles both finished second in the 880 and 600-yard runs respectively. 
"I wasn't surprised by it," said Piane. "All they have done is distance workouts. They haven't done any speed at all." · Brown gained revenge over Leonard in the 300-yard dash, dusting him by a two-second margin. 
The Irish held the lead the entire meet, the closest score being 32-31 after the 440-yard dash. But an Irish sweep in the pole vault gave the Irish a ten­point cushion. 
Notre Dame took the only relay of the evening, as Nobles, Yan Searcy, Peter Demeo, and Chris McGuire won the mile relay. Nobles got the team to a large early lead, and McGuire held off Michigan State's Rod­ney Benson to win the race. 

Irish fall to St. Joe 
Special to The Observer 
The St. Joseph Hawks out­scored Notre Dame 27-16 over the final 10 minutes to secure a 71-57 victory. 
The Irish stayed with St. Joe in the first half, which ended in a 29-29 tie. Mary Gavin led the Irish attack with 12 first-half points, and the Irish enjoyed a 16-10 rebounding edge. They also shot 60.9 percent from the floor. 
In the second half, Teresa Carmichael scored 11 of her 15 points to help the Hawks distance themselves from the Irish. Debbie Black led the Hawks with 16 points. 

Sandy Botham and Diondra Toney each scored 16 to lead the Irish, and Gavin finished with 14 points and six assists. 
Notre Dame's record falls to 4-11, while St. Joe im­proved its mark to 12-4. 
Self-inflicted wound kills Purdue assistant 
Associated Press 
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.­Willard G. Wells, an assistant football coach and recruiting coordinator at Purdue Univer­sity, died at his home from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the Tippecanoe County coroner has ruled. 
Coroner Martin D. A volt said Wells, 43, died about 7:30p.m. Friday. A volt said no note was found and no autopsy would be performed. 
Wells came to Purdue in Jan­uary 1983 to work for Leon Burtnett, who was forced to resign as head coach after this past season. 
"Willard was a very close friend of the family, very close to my kids and very close to a lot of our footbal players," Burtnett said Saturday. "I am very, very sad at tltis point. We are all surprised and shocked." 
Wells, a native of Chilliwack, British Columbia, Canada, played football at Boise Junior College and attended Franklin
 College before earning degrees from San Jose State in 1970 and 1971. 
He began his college coach­ing career as an assistant with Burtnett at San Jose State from 1971 to 1975. He moved on to Tulane in 1976 to coach outside linebackers and then took over special teams in 1978. He was in private business in New Or­leans when Burtnett hired him at Purdue. 
"Willard and I go way back to San Jose State where we recruited together," Burtnett said. "He was a tremendous man and he recruited many, many fine athletes to San Jose State. That situation and our relationship continued here at Purdue.
