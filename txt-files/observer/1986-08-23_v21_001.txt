Study lounges to be temporary home for 84 ND freshmen 
By MARK PANKOWSKI 
News Editor 
While some students like to get a head start on their schoolwork, that's not the reason why more than 80 Notre Dame freshmen are expected to be in study lounges this week. 
They'll be living in them -but only for awhile. 
Because of overfilled dorms, about 84 freshmen will temporari­ly reside in study lounges in Flan­ner, Grace and Sorin halls, according to Evelyn Reinebold, director of student residences. 
In addition, six other freshmen will be squeezed into dorm rooms in Alumni, Cavanaugh, Morrissey and Zahm halls. For example, a room designed for three students may temporarily have four. 
Reinebold, who has been at the University for 15 years, said that this is the largest number of freshmen in makeshift quarters that she can remember. She added that Student Residences has been forc­ed to put freshmen in temporary quarters for a number of years. 
"We've always had an overflow," she said. 
As other students move off cam­pus or leave the University, freshmen will be relocated into other dorms, she said. 
Reinebold said that she didn't know how long it would take to find permanent rooms for all the freshmen. "I wish I had a crystal ball," she said. 
Last year, study lounges were home to 41 freshmen. Reinebold said she believed all had permanent rooms by the beginning of Oc­tober, possibly earlier. 
Freshmen will be moved out ac­cording to when they sent in their enrollment confirmations, she said. The earlier a student sent in his con­firmation, the quicker he'll be mov­ed out. 

Currently, freshmen who sent in their confirmations after May 1 are in study lounges or squeezed Jnto dorm rooms, Reinebold said. Although in the past both male and female freshmen were placed in temporary quarters, this year all are male students, she said. 
Reinebold said freshmen must be placed in makeshift quarters because the Admissions Office ac­cepts more students than there is space for, knowing that some will not come. Admissions must estimate the number that will decline the invitations, cancel their confirmations or not show up. 
Because the number of cancella­tions was low this year, Student Residences was forced to place freshmen in temporary rooms, Reinebold said. 
Assistant Director of Admissions Pat Leonardo disagreed, however. Leonardo said that although the number of cancellations was very low this year, Admissions expects between 1,820 and 1,825 freshmen to enroll. That's approximately the same number as Admissions was told to bring, he said. 
With that in mind, Leonardo said he could only explain why about 20 students are without permanent rooms. According to Leonardo, on Wednesday Student Residences was given a list of approximately 1,840 freshmen that would need rooms. About 20 freshmen do not show up each year, he said. 
Because Student Residences doesn't know which freshmen won't show up, some must be plac­ed in temporary rooms, Leonardo said. Later, as the names of freshmen that didn't enroll become available, Student Residences can then assign those students in tem­porary quarters to the rooms of the ''no-shows.'' 
Because this only accounts for about 20 students living in tem­porary quarters this year, rather than 90, Leonardo suggested that Student Residences might be par­tially responsible for the overflow. "If in fact 90 'people are in study lounges ... why is there not 20 or 30?" 
After Leonardo asked this ques­tion, an attempt was made to call back Reinebold. However, her assistant said Reinebold had become ill and had left the office for the day. An early deadline for

Three residence halls at Saint Mary's will have new directors. Holly Taylor, who served in a variety of ad­ministrative positions at Bethel College, will be Regina Hall's residence hall director. Mary Jo Palmieri, who received her Masters Degree in counselor education from the University of Pittsburgh, will serve as McCandless Hall's director. Margaret "Mugs" Caven has moved to serve as director at LeMans Hall. -The Observer 
Construction of the additions to the Notre 
Dame Law School has been delayed and won't be completed un­til October, according to Don Dedrick, director of the physical plant. Rain in November and delays in the delivery of materials slowed construction, Dedrick said. The remodeling of portions of the old building has been completed, as well as the north end of the addition, he said. Workers are now finishing the exterior masonry and working on the windows. Once they're done, they'll work on the offices in the south end of the addition. -The Observer 
Notre Dame's War Memorial will be com­
pleted in about two weeks, according to Don Dedrick, director of the physical plant. Construction was delayed by the late ship­ment of black granite that surrounds the fountain, Dedrick said. "We had a heck of a time getting the black granite from Italy," he said. On Tuesday, the fountain was turned on. However, workers still must repair the sprinkler system and put in new sod before the memorial is completely done, Dedrick said. -The Observer 
Ernan McMullin, O'Hara professor of philosophy at Notre Dame, has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, an international honorary society based in Cam­bridge, Mass. McMullin, who joined the Notre Dame faculty in 1954, was chairman of the department of philosophy for s;even years. Currently director of the program in the history and philosophy of science, he specializes in theories of scientific method, the scientific revolution of the 17th century and the in­teractions of science and theology. Academy members research and publish material on national and international issues such as human rights, weapons in space and corporate responsibility. ­

LaFortune renovation complete by October 
By MARK PANKOWSKI 
News Editor 
Once hoped to be finished by now, the renovation of the LaFor­tune Student Center is currently slated for completion by the third week of October, said Don Dedrick, director of the physical plant. 
However, Dedrick said, parts of the building are essentially com­plete, and some businesses and organizations have already moved in. 
Dedrick attributed the late com­

pletion  date  to  delays  in  the  
delivery  of  materials  and  bad  
weather  in  November  and  
December.  

''The delivery of materials really held us up," Dedrick said. "When one material is not here, it really holds everything up." 
"Construction delays were also caused by the weather," he said. "We had quite a bit of rain last November. We were doing out­door work and we just couldn't get the work done." 
Once completed, the student center will feature an elevator and a ramp, making it accessible to the handicapped, he said. 
Dedrick described the renova­tion, begun last year, as being done from the top on down. "As parts are completed, they'll be turned over to the students," he said. 
Currently, workers are putting the finishing touches on the third floor, which will house Student Ac­tivities, The Observer, the Dome, Scholastic, Adworks, a lounge area and conference rooms. 
The offices of Student Activities, The Observer and the Dome are nearly complete, while Scholastic's should be done in about two weeks, Dedrick said. Student Ac­tivities and The Observer already have begun moving in. 
On the second floor, workers are painting and doing the wood trim, Dedrick said. Student government, the International Student Affairs/Minority Student Affairs Office, Student Activities Board, Shenanigans, the class offices, WVFI-AM student radio station, the International Student Office lounge, the Black Cultural Arts Council. lounge, Theodore's and club offices will all be located on the second floor. 
Although Dedrick said the offices of student government should be completed in about two weeks, it wasn't clear when the others would be finished. 
The Ballroom, also located on the second floor, is essentially com­plete, Dedrick said. However, the stairway leading to the Ballroom still needs painting and plastering. 
On the first floor, construction is being done on the walls and ceil­ing of the Huddle, he said. The fast­food eatery should be completed by the third week of October. 
Much work still needs to be done on the basement area, although the University Barbershop, which mov­ed from Badin Hall, is already open there, Dedrick said. He added that he expects 1st Source Travel, which also moved from Badin Hall, and the Irish Gardens florist to be open by the time school starts. 
"The other businesses, it's a lit­tle premature for me to know (when they'll be open)," Dedrick said. "The sweet shop, University Hair Stylist and game room will be awhile." 
University Hair Stylist will remain in Badin Hall until it moves to the basement. 
Other businesses to be housed in 

LaFortune's basement include the 
Ticket Stub, The Cellar (a record 
store) and a 24-hour laundromat. A 
television lounge will also be 
located there. 
Dedrick said he expects the 24-hour laundromat to be the last part ofthe building completed, pro­bably by the third week of October. 
"I think when we finish everybody will be pleased,'' Dedrick said. "It's worth the wait."

to Barille. "I think it (the program) is fantastic for the freshmen and is an instant way for the girls to make friends." 
The survival-leader program con­sists of approximately 85 up­perclassmen volunteering their time to the freshmen. Each up­perclassman has five or six freshmen in her group, said Kathy Bryant, assistant chairperson. 
All members of the group live in the same dorm, which allows the women easy accessibility to their leader, Bryant said. 
Survival-group meetings will continue throughout the orienta­tion period and possibly throughout the entire semester, said Barille. 
Socializing will continue tom-morrow night at the Pre-Dance par­ty on the Haggar College Center Terrace for both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's freshmen. During the party, Saint Mary's freshmen will be able to obtain tickets for the Stepan Center dance, which will follow at 9. 
In addition to the socializing, educational meetings will be scheduled for incoming students today and tomorrow. Meetings for parents and discusssions about col­lege majors are among the events planned. 
After the initial transition to col­lege life, Saint Mary's will be spon­soring a freshman trip to the Warren Dunes in Michigan. Buses are scheduled to depart from the McCandless Hall parking lot at 9 
a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 30. 
Barille said she is "pleased with the attitude and enthusiasm" of about 200 volunteers who have made the orientation possible. "We are really anticipating the arrival of the freshmen and feel we are organized and confident that it will go well." 
Before it's all work and no play for Notre Dame freshmen, they will be treated to Playfair, a set program of comedy skits and audience par­

Freshmen can get involved in SMC student government 
By MARGIE KERSTEN 
Saint Mary's Editor 
Freshmen at Saint Mary's will have plenty of opportunities to become involved in student government, according to Student Body President Jeanne Heller. 
Freshmen will have the oppor­tunity to apply for several different commissioner positions in their respective dorms, Heller said. They can also run for one of the four class offices in September. 

Student government at Saint Mary's takes the form of three main bodies: the Board of Governance, the Student Academic Council and the Programming Board. 
The Board of Governance, chaired by the Student Body Presi­dent, has jurisdiction over propos­ed changes in policy. Residence hall

Betsy Burke, vice president for academic affairs and college rela­tions, chairs the Student Academic Council. It consists of student representatives from each academic department of the College and various College committees. The Council provides a forum for stu­dent discussion of different academic policies and proposed changes.

About 62 blacks, 58 hispanics, 32 Asian-Americans and nine American Indians are expected to enroll, as are 43 foreign students, he said.

"Some really want to stay in Plan­ner or Grace, but we can't do that,"she said .

The question right now might be: How do I become best friends with my roommate? 
Three months from now that question could be: Is it really im­portant that I become best friends with my roommate? 
Many of the most fruitful roomming situations result from roommates who "broaden their horizons and develop new in­terests," according to Christine Conway, a psychologist with the University Counseling Center. Conway said stress often results when roommates "have the ex­pectation they're going to be best friends." 
It may seem like heresy to suggest that successful room­mates can be none other than best friends. That notion can become even more stupefying for freshman when they look around them and see their new classmates in the dorms going to parties with their roommates already, talking and laughing together as if their relationships date back to kindergarten. 
Don't let it fool you. Most every other freshman out there is experiencing the same tight knot in the stomach when it comes to smiling at all these new acquaintances and trying to make interesting conversation without asking too many times where someone is from or what his major is. 
And-the person who deludes himself the most could very well be the freshman across the hall who spends every moment of his time with his roommate, go­ing from one orientation session to another together, laughing, talking, calling his roommate his best friend after only a week on campus.

I couldn't go to smoker who was afraid to face the dining hall because my men, or perhaps she chatter·ed roommate was always away, off with her parents or other friends, attending different func­tions from mine. And no freshman ventures out anywhere, much less the dining hall, alone. 
Thus I was too shy to hang around with some of the other freshmen in my dorm until I was asked to go to dinner with them because they all seemed so chummy. Already. The women in the quad next to my room were already wearing each other's clothes and french­braiding each other's hair. The roommates in the singles across from mine were already a solid pair in the minds of other residents, who never saw one without the other. And then there I was, all alone, tired of tagging along with other room­mates and afraid that I might already appear to be a real loser because even my own roommate wouldn't associate with me. 


"You arrive at the University and haven't met anyone yet but your roommate. It's kind of out of fear you want to be with this person," Conway said. 
But that was only the first week of my career at Notre Dame. Of all the roommates around me in my dorm, I was one of the few who ended up pairing with my freshman room­mate again. We shared the same living space for three years. 
During freshman orientation it would have been hard to believe that we could milk three years together out of that unsure beginning. After all, we didn't seem to take to one another right away as others around us did. But that's just the point: we gave each other time to become adjusted to our new situations and recognize that we were not old friends, that we were not ready to share our all our moments and activities together. 
But now after having shared many memorable times, I'd say we would qualify as old friends. Living successfully with another person in a 12-by-18-foot room fosters a special kind of bond in­to which no one else can ever quite enter. That first week of doubt and insecurity really paid off. 


Exploring strange frontiers 
ERIC M. BERGAMO 
assistant features editor 

Being a freshman at Notre Dame in South Bend is like be­ing a stranger in a strange land. 
Gone are all the familiar places of your hometown, replaced by the new surroundings of South Bend. Here are some hints to help make the transition to this new home easier. 
Places to shop 

Three major shopping malls in the South Bend area offer a variety of stores. 
University Park Mall is two miles north of the campus on State Route 23. The mall features more than 90 stores and restaurants along with two movie theaters that show the latest releases. A shuttle bus runs from the campus to the mall every Friday and Saturday even­ing at a cost of 50 cents. During the week Transpo, the South Bend area public transportation service, runs buses to the mall. 
Scottsdale Mall is on the south side of the city on Ireland Road. Scottsdale offers many of the same stores as University Park and has two movie theaters. Transpo runs bus service to this mall as well. 
The 100 Center in nearby Mishawaka is different from University Park and Scottsdale in that it is located in a renovated brewery. A number of unique 
Other smaller shopping centers are close to the Notre Dame campus. North Village Mall on 
U.S. 31 and the Town and Coun­try Plaza on McKinley A venue are nearest. 
The Goodwill Store offers us­ed merchandise at very inexpen­sive prices. Such items as easy chairs, couches, tables and lamps for dorm rooms can be bought there. Goodwill is a half mile south of the campus at the Five Corners. 


Lodging 
A number of hotels and motels 
in South Bend provide lodging at 
comparable prices, either inex­
pensive or expensive. 
The Morris Inn, operated by the University, is the closest hotel to Notre Dame. The hotel is just south of the campus across from the Center for Conti­
nuing Education. 
Many inexpensive hotels can be found on U.S. 31: The Budgeteer Motor Inn, Day~: Inn, Motel 6, Howard Johnson's and the Ramada lnn. The more upscale hotels can be found in downtown South Bend at the Americana Inn on West Washington Avenue and the Mar­riott on St. Joseph's Avenue. 


Places to eat 
Fast food restaurants are on 
U.S. 31 near the campus: Azar's Big Boy; Denny's; Bonnie IDoon; Godfather Pizza; the Golden 

Ponderosa; Steak and Ale; Taco Bell and Naugles. One of the more popular restaurants is not located on US 
31. Barnaby's, where many Notre Dame students go for piz­za, is on Grape Road and East Jefferson in Mishawaka. 
For more formal dining, South Bend offers its share of restaurants with good food and good atmosphere: Barclay's on 
U.S. 31; Captain Alexander's Wharf on East Colfax A venue near downtown; the Carriage House on Adams Road; Doc Pierce's on North Main Street in Mishawaka; the East Bank Em­porium on South Niles Avenue; the Ice House and the Rathskellar, both located in the 100 Center in Mishawaka; Jeremiah Sweeney's on Grape Road; and Tippecanoe Place . 

Transportation 
Transpo offers bus service to all of South Bend and Mishawaka at a cost of 50 cents one way. Transpo buses stop at the Main Circle and the Library Circle on the campus. 
If Chicago is the destination, the South Shore Railroad Station, located ·at 722 W. Washington Ave., provides service to the Windy City. The South Shore provides service to Chicago three times daily at a cost of $14. Amtrak also provides train

Pressures, parents and promises for ND family 
The following column originally ap­peared in the Aug. 25, 1984 edition ofThe Observer. It was read to the students and parents of the Notre Dame Class of 1988 at Freshman Orientation. Although its con­tent bas been revised for the Class of1990, its message remains unchanged. 
Joe Murphy 
welcome home 
Other "Veteran Darners" no doubt will tell you, the Class of 1990, about Emil and about the alcohol policy. I will not. Instead, this column is about pressure, parents and promises. 
Last year at this time, I received a phone call from a man who had hoped his son would be a member of the Class of 1989. The man asked that I tell his son how one becomes a "Domer" and what exactly "Darners" do. So, being the man for others that I am, I met with the man's son. 

Young Bill reminded me of myself. Here he was, not even officially a senior in high school, already worried about college life. He obviously had been placing a great deal of pressure on himself to succeed and become a "Domer." I told him that you do not have to be a "Domer" to be a success. 
The pressure Bill was facing was com­pounded by the fact that his parents, like many Catholic parents, wanted him to attend Notre Dame. Bill wanted to know whether he could get accepted and whether he could survive at Notre Dame. I told him he would answer those two questions himself in the near future. 
Unfortunately, Bill was not accepted. Dur­ing your four years here, remember Bill and the thousands of other young students who would love to be where you are. I ask only that you make a simple promise to yourself because you are here and they are not: Pro­mise yourself that you will leave Notre Dame a better person and that Notre Dame will be a better place for your having been here. 
For the Class of 1990, the question of ac­ceptance has been answered. I am sure though, the question of academic and social 
survival remains a nagging doubt hidden in 
the back of your mind. 
To the Class of 1990, some simple advice 
is offered. Do not let the pressure get the best 
of you. Your parents will be just as proud 
of you whether you make the Dean's Honor 
List or not. Second, keep in close touch with 
yqur parents and relatives for they are a 
source of inspiration on many lonely nights. 
Third, stay particularly close to your grand­
parents for you are their golden dome which 
keeps them young. 
Fourth, remember it is a privilege to attend 
Notre Dame, but it is a privilege for which 
you are paying. Do not accept second-best 
from yourself or your school. Go beyond 
your potential and expect Notre Dame to go 
beyond its. That is all anyone can ask of you, 
and all you can ask of Notre Dame. Simply 
be the best. 
Fifth, and above all, remember that not 
everyone's life revolves around Notre Dame. 
Be proud, but always be humble. The pur­
pose of your education is not to place you 
above the masses, but enable you to lead the 
masses. 
Today marks not only an arrival, but a departure. You are leaving your family and joining ours. You are doing the one thing which your parents have feared from the day 

-of your birth -you are growing up. 
So to the parents of this class, I merely say 
that it is OK to cry when you say goodbye. 
If you cry though, cry for the right reasons. 
Cry because you have given your children 
the opportunity you probably never receiv­
ed. Cry because your children are no longer 
under your roof, and you will miss them. Cry 
because you love them. 
Parents remember that for every parting 
there is a homecoming. Your children have 
left only your house, not you. Rejoice in this 
triumph. You have raised your children well. 
Call often, send surprises through the mail 
and one day four years from now your 
children will return having become the type 
of people you are. That is a promise.

Predictions and expectations for freshman year 
Cliches tend to be so troublesome. They rear their predictable heads at births, wed­dings and deaths and other occasions where tearflow reaches optimum production. En­trance into college could well fall into this classification, meaning that the following in­ches of newsprint will be filled with archaic and bronzed bromides. I will attempt to diversify. 
Pete Pranica 
guest column 
Once upon a time, a somewhat famous person was heard to say, "Gentlemen" (although some other word would be more appropriate here today), "never in your lives will you do anything so important." This is not a line from a general or a college dean. In point of fact, it was uttered prior to the start of a Yale-Harvard football game. Before a football game, the coach's theatrics were a bit much, although upon entrance into col­lege, it is more relevant. 
True, I said I would not deal in cliches, so rather than pick apart that coach's charge to his troops, I will tell you that what you are about to undertake is the most important thing in your lives -both to you and your families. Certainly, anything costing $10,000 per year would mean a lot to anybody. 
Like it or not, at Notre Dame you will be carrying a banner for your family, town and school. In a sense you become a symbol ­a symbol of academic and social success. You achieved in high school and now it is on to a bigger challenge. How you handle that challenge will be watched by all. 
Your parents will be most concerned ­about everything from academics to your diet to your roommate. Understand and comfort them. Believe it or not, they are pro­bably just as worked up over this as you are, perhaps more so. You are the product of their toil and tears; they want only the best for you. 
While you must be understanding of your parents, it is you who must strap on the bookbag and do the reading. For some of you, this will be the first time that you have been so independent, so alone. Intimidating? 

It would certainly seem so, but only for the first few months or so. That's why Dean Emil Hofman is there. Listen to him; he has seen countless freshmen enter the Universi­ty and he knows, even better than you do, what will run through your mind during your freshman year. You will be alternately happy and not so happy, unsure of what lurks around the next corner when the only thing to fear is your own uncertainty. Notre Dame is not a monster which spits out young men and women. Instead it nurtures and educates. 
But you will do other things on your own once you've: found yourself in the Notre Dame community. You will study and read and compute and write and re-write. You will be tested, graded and evaluated. Some will excel, others will flounder, but most will do ''all right.·' You will look at career choices and choose a major as a first toddler's steps into the Gre:at Big World Out There. Under­stand though, that academia is but one part of your experience. 
You will cheer and shake down the thunder at football and basketball games, but complain if the Irish lose. You will learn that plaid pants are verboten, especially when they come with batteries. 
You will criticize the administration for its doctrine of ;in loco parentis. You will roast Father Hesburgh as a sometimes-absentee president who is out of touch with student concerns. You will toast him for turning Notre Dame into an intellectual, as well as athletic, giant. You will celebrate with him at Mass. 
You will complain loud and long about the opposite sex. You will fall in love; you will fall out of love. You may even marry so­meone in your class. But be forewarned ... any insights into the social situation you might have were already discovered years ago. Plagiarism is grounds for dismissal from the University. 
You will laugh and you will cry; you will love and (unfortunately) you will hate. You will break up and make up and sit up all night trying to make sense of it all. Welcome to college, a laboratory where you can learn in a controlled environment about yourself and others. 
You will pray at the Grotto at three in the morning in the rain or snow. You will thank God for your successes and question your failures and plead for more of the former and not the latter. 
Before long, the high-school hotshot turn­ed scared frosh will round into shape ­spiritually, academically and socially. The trip will be filled with rough seas and treacherous winds and cold nights. But you are not alone; there are 1,800 others mak­ing the same voyage and shared adversity will make you strong and mature. 
You will enter the port of adulthood in May of 1990. You will look back at the romances and road trips, the dances and the drinks, the formals and the football games, the complaints and the camaraderie and you will cry quiet, happy tears, just as your parents cried when they left you behind. 
Welcome to Notre Dame.

Quote of the Day 
"You know your gifts better than anyone else. You are free to use them as you will. I cannot tell you that you should use them to make the world better, although I think you should. Whatever I think, you must make the decision, and only you can. I can only say that your gifts are a precious heritage, and that mankind today needs such gifts if human equality, human development, and the promise of science and technology are to become a reality and not a frustrated hope.

staff. Nester also is credited with upgrading the College's soccer team from club status to the varsi­ty level, in addition to arranging for the Saint Mary's swim team's use of Rockne Memorial pool. With Il years of high school and college coaching and teaching behind her, Nester headed the Saint Mary's ten­nis team, which finished I Oth in the nation in NAIA competition last spring. Nester holds bachelor and masters degrees from West Chester State in Pennsylvania, and she received her doctor of education degree with a minor in sports ad­ministration from Temple University. 
Col. John Stephens -This is Jack Stephens' 19th year in the Irish administration and his fourth year as director of special projects for Corrigan. He assumed the role after having spent seven years as associate athletic director and another eight as an assistant direc­tor. Despite holding his present job for only a short time, though, he already has made an impact, play­ing a major role in the formation of the North Star Conference -a con­ference in which several women's sports competed until last spring. 
Roger Valdiserri-Valdiserri is 

athletic director after having serv­ed seven years as an assistant. However, he is best known for his work as director of the sports infor­-mation department. A 1954 Notre Dame graduate, he served briefly as an administrative assistant to former football coach Terry Bren­nan. In 1966, after public relations stints with Mercedes-Benz and the Kansas City Chiefs, he returned to his alma mater to become sports in­formation director and, 10 years later, added assistant athletic direc­tor to his duties. Regarded as one of the best in his field, Valdiserri has earned 43 awards since I976 from the College Sports Information Directors of America for his sports publications, many honored as the best in the nation. Valdiserri is also the current president of CoSIDA. 
Joe O'Brien-A 1949 graduate of Notre Dame, O'Brien is in his fourth year as associate athletic director after a seven-year stint as an assistant director. He also con­tinues to manage the department's finances as athletic business manager. In I955, O'Brien was named director of personnel func­tions at South Bend's second-largest employer -Notre Dame. He has been here ever since, joining the athletic staff in 1976. He served as president of the College Athletic Business Managers Association in 1983 and was named business manager of the year in 1983 by CABMA. 
Dr. Tom Kelly-As director of non-varsity athletics, Kelly oversees 12 club sports and 63 different in­tramural events. Kelly, who was named an assistant athletic director in 1983, received his masters degree in physical education from Penn ·State and his masters and Ph.D in Educational Administration from Notre Dame. He previously was NVA's assistant director for II years (until 1979) and varsity baseball coach from 1976 through the 1980 season. 
Brian Boulac -A former Notre Dame tight end, this I963 Univer­sity graduate was named assistant athletic director in 1983 following I3 seasons on the Irish football coaching staff. During that time, Boulac was recruiting coordinator for seven years, an administrative assistant to Dan Devine for two years, and a coach of the offensive and defensive lines, receivers and specialty teams over that span. Presently Boulac's job is to offer 
~~~~t~;;:~:~~~~~~~~;i~a~~~~~t~~ 
Mike Bobinski -Bobinski is something of a newcomer to the athletic department's administrative ranks, although certainly no stranger to Notre Dame sports. He was named ticket manager and assistant business manager in the spring of I984. The 28-year-old Bobinski is a 1979 Notre Dame graduate and a former Irish baseball pitcher who returned to South Bend after two years in manage­ment audit and participant accoun­ting with Disney World in Orlando, Fla. He earned two letters as a right­handed pitcher and was a four-year member of the Irish starting rotation. 
Mike DeCicco -Better known as coach of the highly-successful Notre Dame fencing team, DeCic­co doubles as academic advisor for all Notre Dame athletes. Respon­sibility for the Univetsity's high graduation rate among its athletes lies mostly with DeCicco, whose task is to advise more than 500 athletes at Notre Dame. A 1949 graduate of Notre Dame, DeCicco taught for a number of years in the University's mechanical engineer­ing department before giving up teaching to concentrate full-time on his job as academic advisor. His fen­cing teams have brought home an overall record of 480-'10 and won the national championship last spring as well as back-to-back titles in I977 and 1978. 

John Heisler -Now in his fifth year as associate director of sports information at Notre Dame after fo\lr years as assistant director, the 32-year-old Heisler has had a large hand in the editing of a number of award-winning publications. Ten have been judged "Best in the Na­tion" by College Sports Informa­tion Directors of America panels, including two of the last four foot­ball guides. Before coming to Notre Dame, the South Bend native had been an assistant director at Missouri for one year, after serving as a student assistant at that school for four years and then graduating from Missouri's School of Jour­nalism in I976. 
Jim Daves returns to Notre Dame to begin his first year as assistant sports information director. Daves, who was a graduate assistant in the Sports Information Department two years ago, will edit both foot­ball and basketball game programs as well as supervise press relations and publications for Notre Dame's non-revenue sports. The 25-year­old native of Greensboro, N.C., graduated from North Carolina­Charlotte in I984 and spent last year as the the director of com­munications for the Midwest Col­legiate Conference.

Scrimmages such as that above signal the beginning noting that improvement is still necessary, Coach of the 1986 Notre Dame football season. Although Holtz says he is pleased with the team's progress. 
Holtz pleased with fall scrimmage 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN 
Sports Editor 
One of the comments heard most often along the sidelines at practice this week has been "I can't believe it's football season already." But with the season opener with Michigan less than a month away, the 1986 edition of the Notre Dame football team has gotten into full swing. 
Upperclassmen reported Fri­day, August 15, to receive physicals .and equipment and after Picture Day last Saturday, began three days of practice without pads the following Monday. Thursday, the Irish began two-a-day practices in full pads. 
As is usual in the first days of practice, the defense appeared to be a Iitle ahead of the offense in the first scrimmages. Timings on pass patterns and the center exchange were off. Yet despite the miscues, Irish head coach Lou Holtz was pleased with his squad's early showing. 
"We can't do any more as far as effort and intensity," Holtz commented after Thursday's drills. "You can't tell that we're getting there -and we've got a way to go -but we're getting there. 
"No matter how much filtn you look at in the summer, you've still got more to work on in the fall. " 
One thing that was im­mediately evident was the discipline that has be instilled on the field. There were more "yes sirs" and "no sirs" heard on the field than one hears at a boot camp. 

So far in this early season, in­juries haven't been much of a factor with the exceptions of senior offensive tackle Pete Rokich and senior tailback Hiawatha Fransisco. Rokich suf­fered a herniated disc while lif­ting weights and was scheduled to undergo back surgery yester­day morning. As of then, it was too early to tell how long Rokich would be unable to play. Fran­sisco has yet to take part in any action because of continuing problems with his arthritic knees. 
Defensive backs George Streeter, Mike Haywood and Steve Lawrence all sat out Thurs­day's action because of various minor muscle pulls.

Frosh football players prepare for college ball during fall practices 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN 
Sports Editor 

Life at Notre Dame began early for a select group of the class of 1990, the freshman football players. For this group, they faced more of an adjustment than just being away from home. On August 10, the newest members of the Irish squad reported to Notre Dame and when they did, they were no longer the high schools stars that they had once been. 
Instead of being the biggest, fastest or strongest players on their respective teams, now they were just one of many players of equal ability. They now had to start over to prove themselves to their coaches and teammates. 
"On your high school team, you're the man. Here, everybody's an all-American," said Kevin McShane, a 6-3, 218 lb. outside linebacker from Joliet, Ill. "Now you have to rely on technique and what the coaches are telling you rather than God-given talent." 
After the first meal on the 1Oth, the players underwent physicals and then began a series of daily meetings that left them little time to themselves. 
"The schedule was kind of crowded," said Braxston Banks, a 6-2, 205lb. fullback from Hayward, Calif. "There wasn't much time bet­ween meetings, and we're used to relaxing and doing what we want to do. There just wasn't much time. But it's something you have to overcome and get through -no pain, no gain." 
After the veterans reported last Sunday, the freshmen and the rest of the team began working out without equipment for three days, which left the freshmen wondering about what it was going to be like when they started mixing it up with players the size of 6-9, 274lb. Wal­ly Kleine or 6-7, 243 lb. Tom Rehder when contact drills began Thursday. 
''There was a big question mark in every freshman's mind," said An­thony johnson, a 6-1, 220 lb. run­ning back from South Bend. "After a while I really wanted to hit. Once we started banging, it was kind of a relief.'' 
"The night before pads, everybody was a little uptight," echoed McShane. "The next mor­ning, no one was talking. They were all thinking about what it was going to be like. The coaches do a really good job. They start out easy and let everybody progress through

A guide to the people behind ND athletics
