Hall presidents react to letter 
by Jim Ferry Observer Staff Reporter 

Hall presidents contacted this weekend reacted both favorably and with confusion to Butch Ward's letter which was presented to the Hall President's Council Tuesday night. 
Ward's letter was written at­tacking the "easily aroused cynicism" that he felt prevalent on campus. Ward, the President of Alumni Hall and the chairman of the Hall President's Council, wernt on to state that "We are a student body without a leader". 
While he , did not mention any specific course of action that would remedy this situation, he said that "We are left with only our hall governments to provide direction, and only in complete support of those governments can we hope to recapture self-respect and a glimpse of what true Christian community at Notre Dame could be". 
He ended his letter by asserting 

that "every hall president would 
attest to a real concern for this 
student body" and that "we have 
nothing more important than you". 
Several Hall Presidents were contacted in regards to this letter, and opinions expressed were ba­:sically in agreement with each ,other . Ronald Raja, Hall President of Fisher, felt that Ward was "sincere and honest in the letter", but he himself didn't know if everyone on campus felt that same way. Payja wernt on to say that the HPC wasn't really a "political body, so it couldn't do much about the situation men­tioned". 
The President of St. Edward's, Greg Thomas, felt that he couldn't comment on the letter because he had only heard it read to him once at the 1meeting He complained, as did several other Presidents, that he was supposed to have received a dittoed copy of the letter, but that it had not arrived yet. He said that he had "a lot of questions about the letter".$ 
Pat McLaughlin, Pangborn H.P., said that he couldn't go into specifices <no copy of the let­ter), but that he agreed with the whole tone of the letter. McLaughlin thought that "the 
H.P.C. should become more active in the affairs of the Student Body" and that most of the other H.P.s would agree with him. 


HPC chairman seeks re-evaluatio 

Butch Ward, Chairman of the Hall President's Council, petitions students to work through their Hall Government in the absence of a student body leader. 
September is traditionally a month filled with exuberence and en­thusiasm when viewed within the entire scope of a school year, but that vigorous spirit depends integrally upon a fleeting force so ob­viously missing from the Notre Dame campus this fall.That force ­direction. 
Such an orphaned state has been experienced by many groups in recent years. The Democratic party experienced the confusion that results from a lack of direction following the assassination of Robert Kennedy; the Kent State student body felt that same directionless despair following the murder of their compatriots. But the Democrats could blame their despair on the demented mind of an assasin, and the students at Kent State could hold an excitable police force in contempt for their confusion. Notre Dame students will undoubtedly search for some pitiful soul whom they will choose to martyr as the reason for their despair. 
We need look no farther than our own easily aroused cynicism. 
The cynic is the person who abandons positive action in favor of a 
destructive criticism that leaves all previous action fatally deserted, 
while camoflaging his destruction under a shallow wit. Frustrated by 
an incredibly "long" period of striving to achieve self-government 
within the halls without result, we have chosen now to laugh ourselves 
into this directionless abyss. 
It's not funny anymore. 
The fact is that we have spent precious few years in our endeavor to 
achieve recognition from the administration, and now, instead of 
continuing our efforts to achieve that recognition, we have laughed 
ourselves out of any chance of attaining that much needed respect. 
We are a student body without a leader.' 
The freshmen have already been advised by our esteemed king to 
approach some other more interested soul for assistence, for he is too 
busy. Per haps the remainder of the student body should realize that 
we, too, hold the same respected position in our leader's eyes. 
We are a student body without a leader; the pitiful fact is that we 
chose our own fate. 
The root of our present state lies in the destructive cynicism that has 
cultivated in the minds of so many. But where has that cynicism led 
us? Have we achieved self-government? Are we any more respected 
by the administration that holds the keys to that attainment of self­
government? Not only are we unrecognized, we are heckled. 
If we are to achieve·that realization of Christian community that 
must accompany our claims to self-government, we had better begin 
to take ourselves seriously, for if we do not, none of us can expect 
anyone else to afford us that same respect. I intend no animosity 
towards anyone in this epistle, for I wish to gain a real respect for 
every member of this Notre Dame Community. But I happen to be a 
person who has accepted a position that becomes progressively dif­
ficult as the present wave of cynicism increases. We are left with only 
our haU 'governments to provide direction, and only in complete 
support of those governments can we hope to recapture self-respect 
and a glimpse of what true Christian community at Notre Dame could 
be. I speak as a hall president, and I am confident that every hall 
president would attest to a real concern for this student body. Use us ­
we have nothing more important than you. 
Peace

At the meeting, emphasis was placed on Welsh's recorct. Matt Welsh, elected governor in 1960 under the Democratic banner, strengthened the Civil Rights Commission by putting priorities on creating empoloyment, housing, and equal opportunities for minorities in government and proivate business. It was noted that Indiana gained jobs at almost 11 times the previous rate, In­diana's total labor force increased as the unemployment rate dropped to 3.7 per cent, and highway construction and r~urfacing progressed at a recor<Fbreaking pace. 

Welsh's new programs include a realistic review of problems confronting Indiana, involving passage of the 18year old drinking age, reduction of the penalties concerning proivate use of marijuanha, and an improvement of roads which gave Indiana the seventh worst traffic fatality record in the nation last year.

Faculty assesses future of SLC 

by Don Ruane 

Student Life Council elections for the six student representztives will be held this Wednesday. This is the second part of a three part series presenting the outlook for the 1972­73 SLC from the point of view of student, faculty and ad­ministrative representatives who are new members, or are retur­ning as members from last year's council. Today, the faculty outlook. 
The SLC has been floundering about like a cramped swimmer since 1968 and this could be the. year it goes down for the third trime, unless cettain rescue ap­paratus is brought to the scene. 
Professor John Borkowski, chairman of psychology dept. may resign SLC seat.

Generally, members will be unwilling to spend much time researching the issues. 

4. 
If the council doesn't prove itself by digging into some issues with authority, it will no longer be viable. 


Prof. William Chapin, an ex­officio member as vice chairman of the Faculty Senate, places the success of the council upon the students,, for whom the council is intended. He described Wed­nesday's election as vefy im­portant, adding that "the only issues of importance will be raised by the students." 
The faculty and administration should respond, more than initiate, , according to Chapin's view, and they will alow the SLC to become active or inactive depending upon the students.

Monday, September 18, 1972 


Last chance 
The Student Life Council is on its last leg. Students are justifiably reluctant to take the election of new student representatives seriously. In fact, given the current mess in student gover­nement, students are justifiably reluc­tant to take anything the king and his court does seriously. 
Still there are two very good reasons that the SLC should resume meeting this year First, Philip Faccenda, the ac­ting vice president of student affairs, is a very busy man. It is extremely possible that the recommendations of the body will be treated with the respect and concern they have always deserved because the new office of student affairs literally has nowhere else to go for legitimate student opinion. It is im­possible to demand constructive student input into university governance if the one council with the most visible op­portunity to provide that input renigs. 
Secondly, even though most students consider the major hall life questions (i.e. drinking and visitations) settled or at least not worth fighting over any more, student input into two important issues concerning the further conversion of Notre Dame into a fully coeducational institution is now critical. The questions are: When will the university establish its first ccrresidential dormitory and which hall will be converted next to a female residence. 
Refresher course 
It's been so long since the SLC did anything of note that many students may have forgotten how the body actually operates. The 24 seats are filled by eight students, faculty members and ad­ministrators, respectively. Two seats from each group are ex officio. The elective faculty and administrative seats are filled on two year terms so that three new members of each group are seated each year. All Rtudents seats are changed each year:-two via the SBP 
election and the remaining six via the election on Wednesday.

Editor, 
I hesitate to dignify this paper by further appearing in it, but the damage done by it in last Friday's, 
S.L.C. article forces me to speak. The remark in question was of­fered to a member of the staff who had agreed not to print it and who then proceeded to put it in print. This was an unforgivable breach of promise and resulted in making me appear as if I were boldly being crude in print in order to gain attention-a grevious misrepresentation of such a refined individual as myself. 
The fact that no explanation has been given me as to why this happened indicates that it was the result of a conscious attempt to besmirch my flawless character. It once again shows1 the Observer 
Politically speaking, the vice president of student affairs, the university president and the Board of Trustees all have be-to power over any SLC decision. 
Recommendations 
In spite of the fact that the deck has been stacked against the SLC since its inception, The Observer believes that the council deserves one more chance to prove its worth. Towards that end we will endorse candidates for the Wednesday election. The format for the en­dorsements will be cha-nged from past years. Three categories will be used: recommended, acceptable and not ac­ceptable. , 
Candidates will be asked the same set of questions concerning the role of the SLC and their opinions on the issues mentioned above. The reasons for giving any candidate an endorsement will be noted in the context of the answers given to these questions. 
In addition, a one-hundred word statement from all candidates will be printed on the facing page. 
None of this will do much of anything unless the turnout on Wednesday is good. Otherwise the student body is defaulting by giving the administration permission to calling anything it pleases legitimate student input. It's not worth the risk. 
The Editorial Board 

Announcement 
Candidates for the SLC who wish to be interviewed by the Observer please contact the office by 5: 00 this afternoon. Any candidate who wishes to submit a 100 word statement for publication must bring the copy to the editorial board interview. All statements which exceed the limit will be cut at the last per­missible sentence.

·--;rl Ed Ellis 
In a letter to Student Life Council members dated Aprilll, 1972, then chairman Dr. William Eagan stated, "All must be going well at Notre Dame. The Steering Committee has received nothing to place on the agenda since the February 24 meeting." 
With this as a footnote, the 1971-7iterm of the Student Life Council ended, not with a bang, or with a whimper or even with a good-sized squeak. It just clunked to a close. Nothing" very graceful or very poetic about it at all. 
And this week the SLC tools up for another grinding, clanking, groaning year. Some old faces, most notably Dr. Eagan's, will be missing. University Vice-President and General Counsel Philip J. Faccenda holds two seats now and will be looking for someplace to put one of them. And it's always good, clean fun to sit around and wonder what Bob Kersten's next grandstand play will be. 
All this given its proper weight , we will still probably see the corpse of the SLC by the end of this year. The fatality could come oy suicide; it may result from hardening of the arteries. Hopefully it will be the result of some sort of transtion from the over-sized, over-politicized, and underworked SLC to some other group that can hold the attention of top administrators at Notre Dame. 
It would be nice, though, for the SLC-or somebody, at least-to tell the boss-men who shuffle papers under the Golden Lady what students think about certain problems that come up this year. In short, it's quite possible that all will not ''be going well at Notre Dame.'' 
First, we have the question of a bar on. campus; something that will undoubtedly become a reality as soon as Indiana passes an eighteen­year drinking law. Acting Vice-President Faccenda has spoken to the Hall Presidents about this, and shows an awareness of the problems, as well as the benefits of such an establishment. It would be good, however , for an official, Universtiy body to reinforce the feelin of the HPC. 
Second, we have the question of the next women's dorm on campus. Students in Farley become noticeably upset when this subject is raised. Last year, even Rev. Thomas Blantz, C.S.C., the man who allegedly made the decision, could never justify to Badin Hall members the selection of their hall. The SLC is empowered in its bylaws to investigate and recommend halls for conversion to female usage. 
Third, we have the emotional questionof a co-residential hall. This, too, is subject to investigation by the SLC or its successor. 
Another seldom -noted process is the Search Committee for a new Vice-President for Student Affairs. With the Graduation of John Barkett, there is no student sitting on the committee. The SLC, or at least the student membership of the SLC, would be in a position to request student participation, especially since the student government appears entirely ignorant of the process. 
If the new constitution passes, there will be added responsibility for the students elected Wednesday. They will, in effect, be the student government, especially if Kersten quits, as he has been threatening to do for so long. 
And thus there are a few things which require some attention this year. Not many things, of course, except maybe for the pool started by one group of guys to guess the date of the first panty raid on Walsh. 
It would, however, be fortuitious were somebody --anybody-to tell Mr. Faccenda, Fr. Burtchaell, and the rest of the men in the gold­tipped ivory tower, that all is not well at the Dome. The Acting Vice­President seems to be a man of judgement, a man who will listen to other men of judgement. Let them come forth.

Weber and Chapin would like to experiment with a smaller body. While Weber did not suggest any particular size, Chapin felt that only two or three representatives from each faction might be better. 
Chapin, a student solon as an undergraduate, has adopted "a wait and see" outlook saying he "has never been very strong towards bodies that just exist per se." 
He cites two reasons that could account for the SLC's existence. 
·=_a= 
First, it could be just a place for groups to have a voice and speak to each other, or secondly, it could be someplace to discuss important issues and where there is "enough position and authority to do something about them." 
Weber seems to agree with the last point. He said one "very noticeable" problem last year was that members felt that "important issues were being decided elsewhere," and that the SLC was not participating on a significant level. 
, "The SLC has to prove its viability or go out of business," Weber concludes. 
Borkowski states that his

***********'"*Wildcats aren't viciousl.!.l.i. column every Thursday l_::i.l:!·· 
The newspaper accounts of Michigan's 7-{) victory over Northwestern 
Saturday described the Big Ten opener for both clubs as a defensive battle. Which just goes to show you that you can't believe everything you read in the newspapers. 
Virtually all of the excitement in Michigan Stadium took place in the U. of M. student section where the undergrads, b4)red by Ute display of of­fensive ineptitude on the field, amused themselves by "passing up" numerous quantities of girls, boys and wine bottles. 
There was a great deal more passing in the stands than there was on the gridiron, where the Wildcats and Wolverines fought as two such beasts should, on the ground. In a throv. back, or, more properly, runback, to football of 1950s vintage, the two teams combined to throw just20passes in the game. 
Michigan's soph quarterback Dennis Franklin, the first black quarterback ever to start for the Wolverines, threw nine times, com­pleting four passes for 60 yards, including the game's only touchdown. Northwestern's Todd Somer, who ran the 'Cats offense in the first half, and Mitch Anderson, who directed the attack in the final two quarters, attempted llpasses, connecting on six for the grand total of 49yards. Two of Somers' aerials were intercepted, with one of the thefts setting up Michigan's touchdown. 
With both teams running almost all of the time, the game was played in only two hours and five minutes. A good thing, because, despite the close score, most of the 71,757 in attendance were beginning to doze in the warm afternoon sun. 
What excitement there was came late in the second quarter when linebacker Craig Mutch of Michigan picked off a Somers pass near midfield and returned it to the 'Cat 31. Five plays later, Franklin passed 21 yards to wide receiver Bo Rather for a touchdown. 
Notre Dame will open its 1972 season ne weekendnd against No ­rthwestern at Dyche Stadium in Evanston, Ill., and, while the Wildcats don't figure to be a pushover, it would be an upset if they could defeat the Irish. especially in view of their performance Saturday. 
With Michigan's secondary at less than full strength because of in­juries, Northwestern, boasting two fine pass catchers in tight end Steve Craig and wide receiver Jim Lash, figured to throw much more often than they did. 
Before the game, Wildcat· coach Alex Agase said, "In order to make your offense go, you need both running and passing. We won't come out 



firing because we've got to establish our running game. We'll have to ::::~'~:.:.:: _::::~··:::~.:~ probe to find out what wi11 work." U.'E'J
