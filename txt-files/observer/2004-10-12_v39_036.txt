Closet demonstration cancelled 
AllianceND told South Quad display could result in disciplinary measures 
By ANGELA SAOUD Saint Mary's News Editor 

Members of the unrecognized student group AllianceND, who had planned to display a super­sized Coming Out Closet on South Quad Tuesday, were told Monday that disciplinary actions could result if the closet appeared. 
The University saw it as a demonstration of an unrecog­nized student group," said proj­ect coordinator Anna Gomberg. "Student Affairs did not give us the approval to put the display up, and I was told through one of our co-sponsors, the Sociology department, that dis­ciplinary action would most likely be taken." 
Project co-coordinator Anna Gomberg said the closet, sched­uled to appear from 4:30 to 
8:30 p.m., was meant to serve as a "coming together of the community" and to highlight National Coming Out Day. 
The Graduate Student Union was also one of the event's co­sponsors. 
University spokesperson Matt Storin said Student Affairs debated the event throughout the afternoon. 
"All I know is Student Affairs followed the policy of DuLac and other University policies," Storin said. "The decisions made were consistent with these policies." 
Attempts to contact the Office of Student Affairs were unsuc­cessful. 
According to statement from AllianceND, the three purposes of the event were to recognize National Coming Out Day, emphasize the term "coming out of the closet" and celebrate "the processes of growth and discovery critical to develop-

After six months of fundraising, Notre Dame's Habitat for Humanity chapter officially broke ground Monday on its 11th home. The house, located at 2350 Linden Street, will be 1000 square feet in size and will feature three bedrooms and one bathroom. 
At least 15 volunteers are signed up to build on Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday, but the first Monday of fall break kicks off Blitz Build -a five-day event in the construction process that combines the efforts of students and alumni.

Chocola speaks to students at Saint Mary's 
Indiana House member discusses· campaign politics 
By MEGAN O'NEIL News Writer 

Congressman Chris Chocola, Congressional rep­resentative for the 2nd dis­trict of Indiana, spoke to the Saint Mary's community Monday about his experience in federal government and his re-election campaign. 
The event, sponsored by the Political Science Club, followed a visit to campus by Chocola's Democratic oppo­nent Joe Donnelly last week. 
After losing to Democrat Tim Roemer in 2000, Chocola said he did not intend to run again. But when Roemer announced his retirement two years later, Chocola chose to hit the campaign trail again, in one 2002's closest House races, and defeated Jill Long Thompson. 
Chocola said Washington 
D.C. was full of individuals talking about job creation but lacking people who had ever actually created one themselves. 
"I thought we need more people with a business per­spective and not just a lot of lawyers," Chocola said. 
Chocola, who sits on the transportation, agriculture and small business commit­tees in the House of Representatives, said eco­nomic concerns are most pressing for Americans. 
"When people wake up in the morning the first thing they ask themselves is 'Do I have a job?'" said Chocola. "For most people economic issues really drive the day." 
According to Chocola, small businesses are particu­larly important in Indiana

Student body vice president Karla Bell speaks at Monday's COR meeting. 

Meinbers talk about BOT report 
By MARY KATE MALONE 
News Writer 
The Council of Representatives met Monday night to discuss the Board of Trustees' response to their pro­posal about off-campus safety for Notre Dame students. 
Student body vice president Karla Bell and chief executive assistant Dave Baron summa­rized their presentation for the council members, noting that the trustees were very receptive to the idea, in their opinion. 
"The presentation went very well. Contrary to what was said in the campus media, it was very well received. They said it was the best presentation they'd seen in a few years," Bell said. 
Bell explained to representa­tives that the proposal consisted of four main points, all relating to off-campus safety. The four points included a required sem­inar for off-campus students, the participation of off-campus council representatives in South Bend council meetings, the par­ticipation of NDSP to help pro­mote community relations and the creation of the Notre Dame Safe Bus. 
Representatives raised sever­al questions about the purpose of off-campus seminars. 
Bell said the seminars would likely take place at the end of this school year or the begin­ning of next and would teach those students planning to live off-campus how to be a good neighbor and follow the rules and regulations of the South Bend area. 
Baron also said he was pleased by the positive feedback they received from the Board of Trustees. 
"The trustees were impressed with the proposal to use a semi­nar to promote neighborhood involvement. The Board said it

INSIDE COLUMN 

You can quote this 
In my hallway, 22 dry erase 

boards proudly display the thoughts 
and witticisms of those who live 
within. From the short but prophet­
ic "at lunch. be back later," to my 
most recent 
favorite. "I Tim Luebbert 
Purdon't want to 
talk about it," 
everyone (in Photographer 
Dillon. at least) 
seems to have 
something to say. 
If you don't have a white board, 
you are missing out on the very 
definition of self-expression at 
Notre Dame. 
Having examined white-board 

communication for two months 
now. I realize there are four major 
groups of expression: Pragmatics 
("strictly business" notes, like "tak­
ing a shower, help yourself to Little 
Debbies"). Profundities (expres­
sions of higher truth. like "Studying 
is our destiny"). Pranks (ransom 
notes for office supplies) and The 
Void (that is, a nothing on the 
board whatsoever). Let's examine 
each one individually. 
Pragmatic messages often reflect 

the practical nature of those who 
write them. Especially this, the last 
week of midterms in ordinary time. 
onlookers will find an excess of 
such demanding and emotionless 
statements as. "David. help me with 
my calculus," and "Parents coming, 
sweep your side of the floor, [exple­
tive)." Pragmatics are known to 
rationalize their way out of using 
verbs, prepositions. and articles as 
in. "Gone. CoMo. Dinner 6:00." 
Engineers. this should sound famil­
iar. 
Profundities, by definition, tell us something that was not as apparent before. Sometimes, this means a realization about one's personal identity, like this one from my hall­way: ''I'm not a nerd anymore! I do mathematical Biology!" Profundities may also take the form of syllogisms: "If Chuck Lennon raises the roof, and the roof, the roof, the roof is on fire, and we did­n't start the fire (but we tried to fight it). then Chuck Lennon is in grave danger." Essentially, white­board profundities track the progress of human wisdom. 
Pranks: The best indicator a mes­sage is a prank comes through the little discrepancies: "Why does the cute girl from Philo who left me this message have my roommate's handwriting and a 1-900 phone number?" Pranks hold the most potential to provoke a laugh or a slap in the face, but it is up to the designer to weigh the risks. 
As for the blank white boards, I can't say I approve. Some justify it as a "sacred silence," or "bold blankness." but this idea goes stale quickly. If nothing else, do it because everyone else is. Also, to whoever keeps quoting "The Teletubbies" on my white board ­it's no longer funny.

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 
Mendoza rises 
SMC to discuss its itnage during forutn 
in rank to 24th 
By KELLY MEEHAN News Writer 
Board of Governance members discussed plans for a campus-wide forum to discuss the image of Saint Mary's at Monday's m~eting. 
The forum, which was originally scheduled for today, has been post­poned until after fall break. 
The event's purpose will be to address student interests and look at the identity of a Saint Mary's woman, said student body presi­dent Sarah Catherine White. 
"The senior board is very inter­ested in participating in this forum. We want to define what a Saint Mary's woman is without offending anyone," said senior class president Jacqueline Cuisiner. 
The exact date of the forum will be decided after fall break. 
Speech Language Pathology club members Kara Flynn and Lynn Cooper asked the board to co­sponsor their trip to Purdue for a Crossroad Conference on speech language pathology. 
"Speech Language Pathology is a very fast growing career. By going to this conference we cannot bring anything back but a positive expe­rience," said Flynn. 
BOG voted to approve its co­sponsorship for $800 or the initial $1,000 they originally asked for, on the condition that they hold a forum to discuss what they learned at the conference upon their return. 

"Dessert with Dr. Mooney," a pro­gram where students can discuss topics with College President Carol Ann Mooney, was held Sunday night in McCandless Hall. 
"I strongly encourage everyone to attend this event in their Residence Hall. Dr. Mooney is so candid and great to talk with," said White. 
Sophomore class president Claudia Toth said the class board is presenting artist Jesse Young at 
Dalloway's on Oct. 28 from 6 to 8 
p.m. The class also successfully participated in career planning evaluations last week, said Toth. 
BOG members said they would meet after break to discuss meth­ods of saving energy on campus and to plan the upcoming forum on defining the identity of a Saint Mary's woman.

Special to the Observer 
The Mendoza College of Business MBA Program rose five spots to 24th in BusinessWeek maga­zine's biennial survey of the top 30 business schools in the nation. The rankings are in the current issue of the magazine, avail­able on newsstands Monday. 
Notre Dame's five­place jump in the rankings tied with Purdue and Geor­getown Universities for the greatest improvement. Notre Dame was rated sixth in addressing ethical issues in business and ninth in its rapport with corporate rec­ruiters. 
"As we celebrate this ranking result, it is important to step back and note our general attitude toward rankings," said Carolyn Woo, Martin J. Gillen Dean of Business. "It isn't rankings that we strive for, but rather, our energies and actions are focused on the quality of our stu­dents, curriculum, teaching, research and services. Rankings are a reality, and they do provide valuable feedback. But our position is that if we aim for excellence, seek feed­back, go through hon­est evaluation. and take actions to improve, rankings will follow." 
Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management was ranked first by BusinessWeek. In addition to Notre Dame and No. 21 Purdue, the state of Indiana also was rep­resented by Indiana University's Kelley School of Business at 18th. 
The BusinessWeek survey consisted of 45 questions sent to 18,052 Class of 2004 MBA graduates from 94 schools worldwide. In addition, the maga­zine surveyed 223 companies that regu­larly hire MBA gradu­ates and calculated each school's intellec­tual capital by evalu­ating the public reach of faculty members.

Gomberg said the event was largely intended to be just a dis­play. 
"We had really planned to do it in good spirits and good fun and also in support of gay and les­bian students," Gomberg said. "We had a good handout pre­pared with a lot of information on it, but we refrained from dis­tributing it until we knew whether or not we were going to get approval."

Saint Mary's also sponsored events Monday for National Coming Out Day. 
College psychology professor Catherine Pittman said opinions on the events were mixed. 
"Several students e-mailed us negatively after a mass e-mail we sent last week announcing the Coming Out week events were received," Pittman said. "That concerns us. If it were stu­dents responding to a racially­diverse week e-mail, most every­one would say that was wrong, but people seem to get away with it when it's a sexually­diverse topic." 
Pittman said the events, including a guest speaker, con­cert and an ongoing display on sexuality in the Cushwa-Leighton library were organized to try to embrace acceptance and aware­ness at the College. 
"One of the important parts of our campus is to be accepting of all people. It's in our mission statement," Pittman said. "We are supposed to be supportive and loving but for some people, it's challenging dealing with peo­ple who are different. Part of campus diversity is dealing with those who are different than ourselves and it's important to recognize that these students, while in the minority, are always here. It's important to make them feel like they are part of a community too."

was the first time they had seen the idea," Baron said .. 
He said that though the off­campus safety plan was not formally approved. the discus­sion with the Board was suc­cessful and useful. 
"I was disappointed in the coverage. We didn't go into the meeting expecting to get rub­ber stamp approval. We left the meeting feeling positive. We knew we had a solid dis­cussion and we are very satis­fied with that," Baron said. 
Senior class president Darrell Scott raised questions about how the Notre Dame Security/Police was involved with the proposal that was presented. 
"We did not propose having NDSP patrolling the area. We want them to recognize what we are looking for and help us put our plan into action to bet­ter the relationships between Notre Dame students and their neighbors," Baron said. 

Bell said the Board liked the proposal of NDSP involvement, and a meeting with them is being planned. 
The representatives also asked how trustees responded to the SafeBus proposal. 
"The trustees spoke of two main concerns. First, was that they did not want employees of the University condoning underage drinking," said Bell. "The second regarded finding a bus company to provide the buses and take on the liability of transporting students on and off campus." 
Off-campus representative Dave McGowan expressed the need for COR to respond to the Board's concerns. 
"We need to tell them that we not supporting or facilitat­ing underage drinking. It is important to stress to them that that's not what we're doing," he said. 
Baron agreed and empha­sized that when the bus starts running at 1 a.m. most stu­dents would be heading home. 
"We responded to their doubts by stating that after 1 
a.m. most students are going home anyway. Also, we emphasized that the bus stops that are at bars are pick-up only," Baron said. 
Baron concluded the meet­ing by noting the success of their presentation to the Board. 
"We think we helped to raise awareness of a significant problem," Baron said. 
Bell also told members that plans regarding the SafeBus will proceed. 
"We are going to continue working on it. The next step will be to take it to the Senate, then the Campus Life Council and finally the Office of Student Affairs. We're not stopping," she said.

Union changes Kroger contract 
Associated Press 
CINCINNATI -The union representing 8,500 workers at 70 Kroger Co. stores in three states including Indiana has revoked a contract exten­sion with the company, a union spokesman said late Monday. 
Leaders of Local 1099 of the United Food & Commercial Workers will rec­ommend that members reject Kroger's latest contract offer and authorize the union to strike, if necessary, said union spokesman John Marrone. 
The union's move to revoke the contract Monday night means its current contract will expire about 10 p.m. 
Friday, Marrone said. 

The union and Cincinnati­based Kroger had agreed to indefinitely extend the cur­rent contract, which was set to expire this past Saturday, at the urging of a federal mediator. 
The union revoked the con­tract extension because the two sides remain far apart on issues including wages, health care and pensions, Marrone said. 
Kroger wants workers to start paying some of their health-insurance premiums. It also wants to eliminate some situations where it pays overtime, cap the number of full-time workers and liberal­ize work rules. 
"We have provided the 
union with what we think is a balanced contract that gives our employees the good wages and health care that's important to them at a cost that's fair to everyone, includ­ing our customers," Kroger spokesman Gary Rhodes said. "We're hoping we can get this worked out because no one wins in a strike." 
Cashiers, grocery baggers and clerks in meat, produce and delicatessen departments at 70 stores in the Cincinnati area, northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana are cov­ered by the contract. 
The union will vote on Kroger's latest proposal on Wednesday. A two-thirds majority of members voting is needed to authorize a strike.

Saudi women limited in elections 
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -Women may nei­ther vote nor run in Saudi Arabia's first nationwide elections, the government announced Monday, dashing hopes of pro­gressive Saudis and easing fears among con­servatives that the kingdom is moving too fast on reforms. 
Some women considered the move yet another indignity in a country where they need their husbands' permission to study, travel or work. But others said they wouldn't trust themselves to judge whether a candi­date is more than just a handsome face. 
The religious establishment had been lob­bying against women's participation in the elections, diplomats said.

IRAQ 
Shiite militia turns in weapons 
Exchange seen as an important step to end fighting in militant stronghold 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD-Followers of radical cleric Muqtada al­Sadr trickled in to police stations in Baghdad's Sadr City district to hand in weapons Monday under a deal seen as a key step toward ending weeks of fighting with U.S. and Iraqi forces in the Shiite militant stronghold. 
The arms transfer came after U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, mak­ing an unannounced visit to Iraq, said that Iraqis must take "the seeds of security" that the U.S. military has planted and grow their political and economic sys­tem. 
"We can help, but we can't do it. You have to do it," Rumsfeld told senior Iraqi commanders on Sunday. 
In preparation from the turn over of weapons, checkpoints were set up along the roads to three Sadr City police stations, and Iraqi National Guard members took up position on the surrounding rooftops. 
At al-Nasr station, Police Maj. Kadhim Salman said fighters had turned in machine guns, TNT paste, land mines and other explo­sives.

College students fail to apply for federal aid 
Associated Press 

A new study says hundreds of thousands of college students who may be eligible for federal financial aid don't get it for a simple reason -they don't apply. 
The study released Monday by the American Council on Education, which represents colleges and universities, says that half of the 8 million under­graduates enrolled in 1999­2000 at institutions participat­ing in federal student aid pro­grams did not complete the main federal aid application form. 
Many were well off. and cor­rectly assumed they wouldn't get aid. But the study found 1.7 million low-and moderate­income students also failed to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Two-thirds of community col­lege students did not apply for aid, compared to 42 percent at public four-year colleges and 13 percent at private colleges. 
The study concludes 850,000 of those students would have been eligible for a Pell Grant, the principal federal grant for low-income students. 
The findings underscore a point often made by educators: Even as college costs rise, stu­dents often miss financial aid opportunities because they aren't aware of how the system works. 
"It's frustrating when you know someone could be eligible and they just don't do it for vari­ous reasons," said Tammy Capps, financial aid director at Shawnee Community College in Ullin, Ill., where about YOO of the 2,500 students receive l'ell Grants. She said complexity of the form is often a reason stu­dents don't apply. 
"We'll even help them fill it out," she said. "But we have to talk to them face to face to give that information and that does­n't always happen. They don't think to call and ask." 
Few students with more than $40,000 in family income get Pell grants, said Jacqueline King, director of ACE's Center for Policy Analysis. But they can get other federal aid like subsi­dized student loans. And FAFSA forms arc often the first step in applying for other types of aid, such as support from states or their schools. 
The study acknowledges some poorer students might skip FAFSA forms because they line up adequate funding elsewhere. But King said many would have ended up with more aid if they had filled out the form. 
"Everybody assumes the money is for someone else," King said, adding focus groups her organization has conducted reveal wide misconceptions about financial aid.

IN BRIEF 
High number ofworking poor in U.S. 
WASHINGTON -One in every five U.S. jobs pays less than a poverty-level wage for a family of four, according to a study by the nonpartisan Working Poor Families Project. 
The result of so many low-paying jobs is that nearly 39 million Americans, including 20 mil­lion children, are members of "low-income working families" -those barely have enough money to cover basic needs like housing, gro­ceries and child care, the study found. 
The study classified a "working family" as one in which there was one or more children and at least one family member had a job or was actively seeking work. 
Besides staying current on bills, many of these folks also struggled to save up for a bigger home or for a child's college education, said Brandon Roberts. one of the report's authors. 
"These 20 million children are the future of our workforce," Roberts said. 'Their future eco­nomic abilities are at risk growing up in families that don't have the resources to support them." 
Chrysler recall due to air bag failure 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -Chrysler is recalling 955,000 minivans because an electrical prob­lem could cause the driver's side air bag to fail. 
The vehicles affected are the Dodge Caravan and Grand Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Grand Voyager, and Chrysler Town and Country from the 1998-2000 model years. 
Four people have been injured in crashes because of the defect, according to records sub­mitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. There also have been 782 com­plaints about the defect to Chrysler and NHTSA. 
The defect involves a clockspring that sup­plies current to the driver's side air bag, the horn and the cruise control. If the clockspring is working properly, the air bag warning light will illuminate for a few seconds when the vehi­cle is started. If the air bag warning light isn't working properly, the clockspring may have failed. 
Chrysler said dealers will replace the clock­spring for free on vehicles with less than 70,000 miles. The company will extend the warranty on the clockspring for vehicles with more than 70,000 miles. 

Nigeria unites against oil prices 
Commercial capital shut down due to nationwide strike by labor federation 
Associated Press 
LAGOS, Nigeria -As world oil prices hit new highs, Nigeria's biggest labor federation launched a four-day nationwide strike Monday to protest the rising cost of fuel at home, shutting down huge swathes of Lagos, the country's largest city and its commercial center. 
There was no immediate impact on the flow of oil from this volatile West African nation, which is Africa's largest oil produc­er and the fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports. 
Union militants smashed car windows to keep peo­ple home in Lagos, and the streets were nearly empty of traffic except for soldiers and anti-riot police in armored vehi­cles. Banks, stores and schools remained shut­tered. 
"The strike is on. Nigerians are united over this," said Owei Lakemfa, a spokesman for Nigeria Labor Congress, an umbrella group of 29 unions.

T-wo professors -win Nobel in economics 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -An American and a Norwegian won the 2004 Nobel Memorial Prize in eco­nomic sciences Monday for research on how government policies affect economies around the world and why sup­ply-side shocks like high oil prices can dampen business cycles. 
The work by Norwegian Finn 
E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott. a professor at Arizona State University at Tempe, has led to reforms at many of the world's central banks, the citation said. Their research also has given aca­demics better tools for under­standing what causes economies to boom or go into recession, it added. 
The two professors, who both earned their doctorates at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pa., have collabo­rated on work since the 1970s. They will share an award worth 1 0 million Swedish kro­nor, or about $1.3 million. 
Kydland. who is 60, teaches at Carnegie Mellon and at the University of California at Santa Barbara. Prescott, 63, has taught at a number of uni­versities, including the University of Minnesota, the University of Chicago and Northwestern University. Besides teaching at Arizona State, he also serves as an adviser to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. 
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. which oversees the prize, said that the professors' research showed that governments and central banks could be more effective if they adopted con­sistent, long-term rules and followed them. It was pub­lished in the late 1970s when many Western economies were shifting from one policy to another as they grappled with both slow growth and high inflation, or "stagflation." 
"The research shifted the practical discussion of econom­ic policy away from isolated policy measures [and] towards the institutions of policymak­ing, a shift that has largely influenced the reforms of cen­tral banks and the design of monetary policy in many coun­tries over the last decade," the academy said. 
The academy also praised the pair for "transforming the theory of business cycles by integrating it with the theory of economic growth." 
While most economists at the time looked at how changes in demand like consumer spend­ing affect the economy, Kydland and Prescott looked at supply-side changes, such as advances in technology or changes in oil prices as driving forces in business cycles. 
Prescott's 2000 book, "Barriers to Riches," made the argument that a key reason for the disparity in the standard of Jiving among countries world­wide is impediments to adopt­ing technology. 
Washington volcano releases Inore steaiTI 
Associated Press 
MOUNT ST. HELENS, Wash. -Mount St. Helens vented more steam Monday as new thermal images revealed that parts of the lava dome in its crater are piping hot, a sign that magma continues to rise within the volcano. 
Scientists said an area on the south side of the old dome, where a large uplift of rock has been growing, now appears perforated as if magma has been hammering at the surface. 
"The magma is not just pushing up but pushing out." John Pallister, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist, said at a news conference Monday. lie said scientists believe the magma is less than a half-mile below the surface. 
Fast-moving magma would cause greater concern because explosive gases would not have time to dissipate. A team in Denver is evaluating photos taken from the air to gauge how quickly the magma is ris­ing. 
The alert level remains at "volcano advisory," but scien­tists have said an eruption could occur with very little warning. 
Pallister said the most likely scenario remains an explosion with a few inches of ash spreading within a 10-mile radius of the crater. Such an event could happen in days, weeks or months -or not at all, he said. 
Scientists believe the chances are slim of a larger eruption like the one on May 18, 1980, which killed 57 peo­ple. But Pallister was cautious nonetheless. 
''I'm a fairly conservative guy, and I don't like a one in 10 chance," he said. 
Any eruption would likely be vertical instead of the devas­tating horizontal blast that lev­eled old-growth trees for miles in 1980. 
Willie Scott, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist, said earlier Monday that tem­peratures in some spots could be as high as 400 to 570 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Scientists could not get pre­cise temperatures for the hottest parts of the lava dome -on the south side ~ because the instruments weren't calibrated high enough, said Jeff Wynn, chief scientist for volcano hazards at the USGS's Cascades Volcano Observatory. 
"They didn't expect it to get that hot," Wynn told The Associated Press. 
For more than a week, the restless mountain has sent steam, sometimes mixed with ash, venting from bulge of rock on the south side of the lava dome that's risen to at least 330 feet since scientists first spotted it Sept. 30.

CAMPAIGN NEWS 
Objections rise over anti-Kerry film 
WASHINGTON-The Democratic Party and 18 sena­tors are objecting to a broadcasting company's plan to air on 62 TV stations a critical documentary about John Kerry's anti-war activities after he returned home from Vietnam three decades ago. 
Sinclair Broadcast Group has asked its television sta­tions -many of them in competitive states in the pres­idential election -to pre-empt regular programming to run the documentary as part of an hourlong pro­gram two weeks before the Nov. 2 election. 
Based near Baltimore, the company owns or man­ages affiliates of major broadcast networks in several states, including Ohio. Florida and Pennsylvania. 
Mark Hyman, a vice president of corporate relations for Sinclair who also is a conservative commentator for the company, said Monday the show would contain some or all of the 42-minute film as well as a panel discussion of some sort. He said final details had not been worked out. 
The documentary, "Stolen Honor: Wounds That Never Heal," chronicles Kerry's 1971 testimony before Congress and links him to activist and actress Jane Fonda. 
Edwards calls for greater efforts to 
combat methamphetamine epidemic 
WASHINGTON -Democratic vice presidential nomi­nee John Edwards called Monday for tighter restric­tions on the sale of nonprescription cold medicines that could be used to make methamphetamine. 
"It's part of our plan to deal with what we sec as a cancer on rural America. which are these metham­phetamine labs and the impact that methamphetamine has had on so many families in rural America," Edwards told reporters in a telephone conference as he campaigned in Newton, Iowa. 
The North Carolina senator eited a 79 percent increase in the number of illegal meth labs that have been discovered since President Bush took office in January 2001. He also criticized the Bush administra­tion for trying to cut law enforcement programs that fight trafficking in the Midwest of the addictive, illegal stimulant. 
Authorities say meth addiction is a growing problem because it is easy to make with household chemicals and over-the-counter cold medicines. The epidemic is spreading quickly, particularly in rural areas like southern Missouri, which shut down nearly 3,000 meth labs last year, more than any other state. 
Cheney argues Kerry's view of terrorism 
MEDFORD. N.J.-Vice President Dick Cheney, pur­suing Republican votes in a reliably Democratic state, said Monday that Sen. John Kerry's view of terrorism reflects a naivete and an inability to recognize the seri­ousness of the threat. 
Echoing President Bush's criticism, Cheney focused on a comment Kerry made in an interview with The New York Times Magazine on Sunday that the nation has "to get back to the place we were, where terrorists are not the focus of our lives but they're a nuisance." 
Kerry suggested that terrorism, like prostitution, ille­gal gambling and organized crime, will never be eradi­cated but can be reduced so "it's not threatening the fabric of your life." 
Cheney told a few thousand Republican supporters that Kerry's interpretation was "naive and dangerous, as was Senator Kerry's reluctance earlier this year to call the war on terror an actual war." 
The vice president said that if the United States fails to prosecute aggressively the war on terror, "the ter­rorists will escalate their attacks, both at home and overseas, and the likelihood will increase that they will acquire weapons of mass destruction to use against us." 
Candidates' flaws shown in d~~bates 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -After two debates, voters have seen President Bush look peevish and heard him pass the buck. They've watched Sen. John Kerry deny he's a Oip-flopper and then argue that Saddam Hussein was a threat -and wasn't. 
It's no wonder so few minds have changed. 
Three weeks and one debate from Election Day, the vulnerable incumbent and his flawed chal­lenger are struggling for the upper hand. Private and public polls show Bush and Kerry neck-and­neck for the popular vote, and the all-important race to 270 Electoral College votes is just as close. 
Bush has all the advantages of incumbency, an electoral map that favors Republicans and a chal­lenger whose voting record is arguably one of the most liberal in the Senate. Sounds good on paper. 
But so does Kerry's case for a new course. More than 800,000 jobs have been lost during Bush's term, and his main justification for invading Iraq -the assertion that there were weapons of mass destruction -has been discredit­ed after the loss of 1,000 Americans lives. 
While most voters picked sides long ago, those in the wavering middle are trying to decide between a challenger who promis­es change and an incumbent who warns of its risks. 
"At times you wonder whether either one of these guys is up to the task," Charles Franklin, politi­cal science professor at the University of Wisconsin, said after the second of three presidential debates. 
Bush turned in a disastrous per­formance in the first faceoff, gri­macing and fidgeting while Kerry criticized his Iraq policies. To some voters, and even his own supporters, Bush looked like a man spoiled by success. He entered politics late in life, sped to the top and has rarely had to pub­licly defend his policies. 
In the second debate, Bush struggled to name three wrong decisions. His initial response was to talk about unidentified person­Hussein "was trying to get rid of Early in the second debate, the nel appointments. sanctions so he could reconstitute Democrat summed up Bush's

Kerry hits Bush on energy, Bush strikes back on terror war 
Associated Press 
SANTA FE. N.M. -Bracing for their final debate, John Kerry accused President Bush of favor­ing "friends in the oil industry" over consumers strapped with rising fuel bills on Monday while Bush said his challenger so mis­understood the war on terror that he thought it could be reduced to "a nuisance" akin to prostitution or illegal gambling. 
Both candidates campaigned in the West ahead of their third presidential debate, which will take place Wednesday night at the University of Arizona in Tempe. Kerry focused on domes­tic issues -the subject of that debate -and criticized Bush and the Republican-led Congress for not doing more to reduce U.S. dependance on imported oil. 
Bush mixed domestic policy with national security, criticizing Kerry as a tax-and-spend liberal while questioning anew the Democrat's fitness to lead the war against terror. 
At a rally in Hobbs, N.M., the Republican incumbent ridiculed Kerry for saying in an interview in The New York Times Magazine, "We have to get back to the place we were, where ter­rorists are not the focus of our lives but they're a nuisance." 
In the interview published Sunday, Kerry compared the anti-terror battle to efforts by law enforcement to root out prostitution or illegal gambling, knowing such an activity could never be ended but could be reduced to where "it isn't threat­ening people's lives every day." He cited his experience as a for­mer prosecutor in Massachusetts. 
"I couldn't disagree more,".­Bush said. "Our goal is not to reduce terror to some acceptable level of nuisance. Our goal is to defeat terror by staying on the offensive." 
The Bush campaign also takes on the "nuisance" comment in a new television ad. And Vice President Dick Cheney, cam­paigning in Medford, N.J., called Kerry's remarks "naive and dan­gerous." 
Phil Singer, a Kerry-Edwards spokesman, said the Republicans took Kerry's single sentence out of context. "Considering that George Bush doesn't think we can win the war on terror, let Osama bin Laden escape and rushed into Ir.aq with no plan to win the peace, it's no surprise that his campaign is distorting every word John Kerry has ever said," he said.

Kerry and Bush on health care: inadequate responses to the nation's problem 

health care, and, to 

Katie Boyle
my great dismay, 
I've discovered that I 

am far too stubborn For What It :., 
to either cral't or put Worth 
my name on an col­

umn with which I don't entirely 
agree. 

To be completely honest. I don't like all aspects of Kerry's plans for health care. I don't particularly agree with all of President George W. Bush's ideas either. Refusing to toe a prover­bial party line on this issue is having an extraordinarily negative effect on my midterm week workload. So if anyone has extra time to work on my thesis, let me know. 
I admit that my idea of integrity isn't the only concern I have in writ­ing this column. Additionally, fall break is approaching, and my room­mates, along with many others in the senior class, are road tripping it out to New Jersey for the Navy game. I, on the other hand, am going home to that land of milk and honey-other­wise known as beer and cheese ­Milwaukee, Wis. 
My dad works in health care, and if I pretend for an instant that I don't recognize inherent problems in the Kerry-Edwards platform on this issue, I may as well prepare myself for a lonely stay at College Park next week, watching obscure foreign films and reading novels. As entertaining as this idea sounds (no, I'm not jok­ing). I'd also like to enjoy my mom's cooking and see a few high school friends. 
The topic of health care has been somewhat lost during this election cycle, taking second place to a flurry of speeches about the war in Iraq. While foreign policy is of great importance, the well-being of our nation's citizens is just as critical. Kerry and Bush outline highly differ­ent plans to cope with the system's rampant problems. 
Health care today is in dire straits. According to USA Today on Sept. 28, over Bush's past four years in office "average individual earnings" have risen 12.4 percent, while the costs of "private health insurance coverage" has escalated 35.9 percent. As a result, health care has become increasingly unal'fordable. 
Five million, two-hundred thousand Americans have also lost health insurance since the year 2000. 
Surely these statistics demonstrate a failure on the part of the Bush administration. Ilow can the presi­dent be trusted to improve health care when one considers his blem­ished record? 
Despite this rather abysmal history, some of Bush's health care proposals are both valid and necessary. In par­ticular, he advocates medical liability reform, which will limit awards in medical malpractice cases. This change will not only benefit doctors, ensuring that their insurance premi­ums remain somewhat reasonable; it will also benefit the American public in general. 
As the situation stands, prohibitive­ly high health care liability awards threaten the American health care system. Neither Kerry nor Edwards have supported federal legislation limiting such awards. Without this limit, docto"rs will no longer be able to perform high-risk procedures such as caesareans. In addition, the already high costs of health care for average Americans will skyrocket, as they will also be forced to bear some of the cost of excessive awards. 
While ·Bush may be correct on this issue, his overall plan for health care is sadly insufficient. He appears well able to take into account the needs of companies. but, in contrast to Kerry. neglects the consumer. 
Showcasing this phenomenon, Kerry and Edwards' plan for health care brings up many valid points that are not present in Bush's proposals. Unlike Bush, they have supported Americans' right to buy their pre­scription drugs from Canada, which can often save patients a significant amount of money. For example, in my home state of' Wisconsin. senior citi­zens currently must take the 'HX Express' over the border in order to fill their prescriptions. thus avoiding the higher prices in the United States. Edwards has also colla~orat­ed on legislation to allow gnnnric (and generally cheaper) drugs to come to market in a shorter time period. 
Essentially the Kerry plan !'or health care will provide many more Americans with insurance than Bush's outline. The American Enterprise Institute estimates that Kerry's plan will ensure 27.3 million new people over the next ten years, costing approximately $1.5 trillion. Bush's ideas are, on the other hand, much less expensive, insuring 6.7 million new people with about $128.6 billion in costs. 
Kerry focuses on using government to make sure the poorest Americans have access to health care, while Bush believes that reducing govern­ment intervention will improve the situation. Kerry will obtain money for his ideas by repealing a portion of' Bush's tax cuts. while Bush advocates tax cuts as a means of' lowering the cost of health care. 
Both of these men's proposals have some merit. Your opinion on the situ­ation will probably depend upon your view or the importance of govern­ment intervention versus providing the greatest number of people with health care. 
The significant problems discussed, however, should not be ignored. 
In short, on the issue of health care Americans deserve better. Neither candidate has the record nor the pro­posals, which indicate he will be able to adequately mend the current prob­lems in the system.

We must be the vanguards of liberty 
While the media focuses on their critiques of President George W. Bush through the lens of hind­sight, little attention is devoted to looking into the real reasons the United Nations and its friends opposed this war. As confirmed in the Duelfer report, Saddam bought support. particular­ly among French. Russian and Tom Rlppinger Chinese officials to whom he would donate oil "vouchers" that could be

ent was Benon Sevan, former U.N. 
Conservative 

official in charge of humanitarian relief and the Oil for Food program itself. The scandal has gone all the way to the top, to 
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's son. His son, Kojo, was a consultant for a company that later won a questionable $4.8 million U.N. contract. It's quite the coincidence that Kofi Annan suddenly came out with a press release calling the U.S.-led invasion "illegal" just as the press began to leak about the involvement of his son in the kickbacks under Oil for food. Needless to say, the countries and organiza­tions that benefited most from these vouchers were also the countries that were most adamantly opposed to the Iraq invasion. 
Britain, the United States, and other nations within the coalition were not involved with Saddam's kick­backs through the U.N. Oil for Food program. Instead, our "kickback" was Saddam shooting at our fighters almost daily in a de facto war over the no-fly zones. As is usually the case in U.N. action, British and American lives were put on the line before French. German or-God forbid -the Chinese. That is why we supported the enforcement language in H.esolution 1441. while France vigorously lobbied to change the language to "harsh consequences". For those that don't understand French that is synony­mous with "do nothing and continue to receive kick­backs from the Oil for Food arrangement." Then of course. Phase II is a halfhearted inspections process that finds nothing and lifts the sanctions so French oil com panics can benefit from pre-existing contracts with the existing regime. 
However, Sen . .John Kerry believes the problem is with the United States. He has stated that the corner­stone of his foreign policy is to extend our alliances to other states in Europe. The truth is that this cur­rent president has effectively used multilateral means when the world community has been willing to cooperate. Saying that his "respectable demeanor" will suddenly convince nations to suddenly support us in these endeavors is lunacy. Of course, Jacques Chirac said he would help if Kerry were elected, adding him to other prominent international support­ers of Kerry that have spoken out against Bush including Kim Jong II, Fidel Castro and Hezbollah. Kerry has finally decided on an Iraqi policy that seems to look back in hindsight and declare how, "He would have done things differently, and been more prepared." Yes, John. if we could go back in time we would do a lot of things differently, but unfortunately that is not an option in winning the war now. In reality, Bush had the same intelligence in front of him that you and Edwards did when you both voted to authorize action. Saying you would not in hindsight only displays weakness to our ene­mies. 
Kerry's second pil­
lar of foreign policy is his assertion that Bush isn't fighting the real War on Terror. He seems to ignore the accom­plishments of Afghani elections, Iraqi elections and Libya completely giv­ing up its nuclear weapons program. Kerry dismisses six party talks with North Korea as ineffective, and believes we have turned a blind eye to Iran. Departing from his policy of multilateral international rela­tions, he wants to engage in bilateral talks with North Korea, giving Kim Jong II just the opportunity to blackmail the United States into an aid package he has been looking for to keep his miserable tyranny alive. Contrary to his asser­tion that we "forgot about Bin Laden," the U.S. gov­ernment is using its close working relationship with the Pakistanis and others to track down Bin Laden. The IAEA is making a stand in preventing Iran from developing a nuclear program, and the country's young and moderate student base gives hope for future reform without intervention 
Kerry would have my vote if he could deliver on his promises. Of course we would love to see our Special Forces double in size, add three new combat divi­sions, have Europe behind our efforts and see the terrorists suddenly refrain from their "glorious" efforts in decapitating or blowing apart those that have come to rebuild their country. If Kerry could do all this with his magic wand and a rollback of the tax cuts, then he would have my vote in a heartbeat. I 
don't know if I'll ever make $200,000 a year, and I'd love cheap health care, more Social Security and a clean environment with no economic 
consequences. The fact is this is planet Earth, and we are under 
siege by an enemy of rad­ical Islam willing to decapitate people with hacksaws, murder 
children and send 14­year-old suicide bombers with back­
p.!lcks of high explo­sives and flesh-pierc­ing shrapnel into busses of civilians in Israel. While some 

Europeans sit on the sidelines debating the war, our soldiers are dying for the noble cause of freedom in the Arab world. I support the Democratic Party of old that believed in the idealistic dream of a world that embraces liberty. "Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall 
pay any price, bear any burden. meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liber­ty," President John F. Kennedy said.

As a pro-choice professor who respects the pro-life position, I too condemn whoev­er attacked and vandalized the "abortion cemetery." American debates over abor­tion are already far too polarized and acri­monious. Vandalism leads only to anger, never to understanding or reconciliation. 
Students at any great research universi­ty, including Notre Dame, ought to have complete academic freedom. That includes the freedom to express their views on any subject, including abortion, no matter what position they hold. Currently, pro­choice students do not have the right to organize or hold evems, as pro-lifers do. Yet pro-choice students' lack of freedom does not make the pro-life students' state­ments any less deserving of respect. 
The vandals may have been attempting to make a political statement about abor­tion. or they may simply have been drunk­en louts. Either way, what they did was reprehensible. In short, I agree with the sentiments of the students interviewed in Monday's edition of The Observer: Nobody has the right to curtail freedom of speech on a university campus, and we desperate­ly need more open, free, and respectful dialogue about the complex and divisive issue of abortion.

DVD REVIEWS 
'Chappelle's Show' ushers in new era of cotnedy 
By MOLLY GRIFFIN Assistant Scene Editor 
It is not often that a season of sketch comndy is great. In fact, it is rare if it even elicits laughs at all, as the current seasons of "Saturday Night Live" can attnst to. The paucity of laughter is why SNL choosP.s to release "The Best of..." series and why late night talk shows have celebrity interviews and pnrformances from bands interspersed between sketches. "Chappelle's Show." though, has changed the landscape with its bold and hilarious take on comedy, and has proven that we should nxp(~Ct more from sketch comedy. Dave Chappell(~ takns more risks and gets more laughs than any other comedian currently on teJp,vision, and "Chap pe II(~ 's Show: Season 0 ne Uncensored" reveals why. 
Not for the easily offended, Chappelle is a risky comedian who isn't afraid to deal with issues of race. gender or sex­uality in unusual ways. Comedy Central, a channel known for its edgier shows like "South Park" and socially aware shows like "The Daily Show," has allowed Chappelle to keep his comedic bite. 



Season One includes a host of now infamous skits, including: "The Mad Real World," which turns MTV's "The Real World" on its head by having one white guy living with six black people instead of the other way around; "The Black White Supremacist," which cen­ters on a blind member of the Ku Klux Klan who is unaware that he is black; and Tyrone Biggums, a "recovered" crack addict who gives anti-drug talks at schools that seem more commercials than condemnations. 
The show typically opens with a monologue from Chappelle, and often features musical guests like Talib Kweli, but most of the musical acts have been cut from the DVD release. 
Chappelle was a stand-up comedy prodigy at the age or 14, and because he was underage, his mother, an ordained Unitarian minister, would take him to performances. lie got his start in film with Mel Brooks' "Men in Tights" and has gone on to appear in movies such as "The Nutty Professor," "Undercover Brother," "You've Got Mail" and "Half Baked," which he also 
co-wrote. 

Season One of "Chappelle's Show" only contains 12 episodes, but it comes with enough bonus material to make up for the short season. Chappelle and co-creator Neal Brennan provide commentary tracks for five of their favorite episodes, there is a half an hour of deleted mate-
Fourth season of 'Futurama' remains original 
geek. This episode is a wonderful defamation of "Trekkies" everywhere. Or "Less Than Hero," in which a topical cream gives Fry super powers. The show even makes an adventure of each char­acter spending a $300 government refund check. These goofy episodes are totally unpredictable and contain a lot of laughs. 
The cast of characters makes this pro­gram. Fry's boss is a senile and bitter 100-year-old man with no regard for the wellness of his employees. His best friend is a binge-drinking, womanizing robot with kleptomania. Then there is Fry, who is a borderline degenerate. Although this may sound like a bit too much to handle in one show, "Futurama" elegantly weaves hilarious relationships between all of its charac­ters. In season four these relationships have become more developed and more intense, which makes them more inter­esting to watch. 
Character interaction is the heart of this program. The futuristic setting is fun but it is often pushed to the back­ground to focus on the characters. 
"Futurama Volume Four" may not be as strong as other DVD col­lections of this program but it is exceptional regardless. The show derives its comedy through satirical means; much like "The Simpsons" but it also plays with the viewers' concept of comedy. What this means is "Futurama" 
By RYAN ROGERS Scene Critic 
Matt Groening ("The Simpsons") demonstrates another stroke of genius with "Futurama Volume Four," the fourth and final season of the program. 
"Futurama" is an animated television Sf'ries about a modern day loser, Philip J. Fry (voiced by Billy West). who is acci­dentally frozen cryogenically while deliv­nring a pizza. Fry wakes up a thousand years latnr to find just how much or, in many cases. just how little things have changed in the year 3000. Settling into tlw fourth snason. Jory works at Plant l~xpt·nss (an intnrpla1wtary FedEx. only more inept} and copes with all of the hilarious unpleasantries that come with his dead end job. The concept of this program allows Fry to go on all kinds of quirky adventures on all kinds of quirky planets. 
"Futurama Volunw Four" features a number of memorable adventures. In "Wiwrn No Fan lias Gone Before" Fry goes to a planet run by a "Star Trek" rial and bloopers and there is unaired footage from one of the recurring sketches, "Ask a Black Dude with Paul Mooney," which is essentially a ques­tion and answer session between Mooney and people on the street. The blooper reel isn't as funny as it poten­tially could be, but the unaired footage from "Ask a Black Dude" is very enter­taining. 

The audio and video for "Chappelle's Show" are satisfactory. "Chappelle's Show" is redefining 
comedy by doing something that is rare on television today -making people laugh. 
If you've never seen Chappelle, Season One just might make a fan out of you, and if you're already a fan, it just might tide you over until the new season of his show comes to Comedy Central.

sets up a joke with an extremely obvious punch line. However, just when the viewer thinks they know the joke "Futurama" takes the gag in a complete­ly unexpected, yet hilarious, direction. 
The biggest problem with "Futurama" is that it requires very careful viewing. Due to its intelligent nature and the way that it builds jokes "Futurama" cannot be watched casually. For these reasons a good deal of viewers are turned off to the series. Fans of traditional sitcoms may find "Futurama" tough to swallow, after all the show did not have the mass appeal to stay on air for more than four seasons. 
This DVD looks sharp and sounds crisp. The special features are a "Futurama" fan's dream. Each episode comes with a full length commentary and most episodes have a deleted scenes library. There are a sic\\ of storyboards, character art and other features to satis­fy all of your "Futurama." needs. Not to mention the collection's running time is 414 minutes 
Fans of quirky, intelligent comedy should look no further. "Futurama Volume Four" is brilliant.

Grieving Rivera comforts family members in Panama 
Closer expected to return for Game 1 of the American League Championship series, which begins Tuesday 
Associatod Pross in Panama on Tuesday in time

NEW YORK -Yankees closer onship series against Boston. Mariano Rivera said he plans Rivera flew home to comfort to return from a family funeral relatives after two members of his wife's family were electro­cuted in his pool. The ALCS begins Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium. 

"I am going back to New York tomorrow. after the funeral. and rejoin the team." Rivera said Monday outside his home in Puerto Caimito. the fishing village where the accident occurred. 
"At this moment. my family is my priority." he said. "I stopped thinking about base­ball the moment I got on the plane." 
Early Tuesday. Rivera will attend the funeral of Victor Dario Avila. a cousin of Rivera's wife. Clara. and Avila's 14­year-old son. The father was electrocuted when he tried to save his son. also named Victor. while cleaning the pool at the pitcher's home. officials said. 
The Yankees have arranged for a private plane to bring Rivera back to New York. 
"I don't want to say he's going to be back tomorrow." Yankees manager Joe Torre said earlier Monday. "If he's here tomorrow. wonderful. If he's not. then we understand that." 
Rivera's agent. Fernando Cuza. told The Associated Press in an e-mail that the pitcher "should be back in time" for Game 1. 
The local police log on the accident said that a suspended electrical cable fell into the pool while the younger Ayala was in the water and the father jumped in to try to rescue him. 
The chief of the local fire department. Luis Felipe Caceres. said the only witness was Denis Ballestero. brother­in-law of Rivera's wife. Ballestero suffered shocks and was released from a hospital. 
On Monday, a tarp had been raised in front of the Avila fam­ily's small zinc-roofed. con­crete-walled house next door to Rivera's mansion. 
Eight children. some bare­foot. played baseball on a bas­ketball court nearby, using the basket stands as bases. A heavy downpour soon drove them away. Many of the men from the town of 3,500 were at sea. fishing for shrimp. 
Rivera's father was a fisher­men, as was Avila, who also cleaned and maintained Rivera's home. 
"There's great pain in Puerto Caimito because Victor was a very well-liked person in town." said a neighbor. Arnulfo Vega, 52. also a fisherman. 
If Rivera doesn't return. it will be the first time since 1997 that Torre won't be able to call on the player who is widely regarded as the best closer in postseason history.

"We get too late in a game and Mariano is not here. obvi­ously we know what we're going to do," Torre said. "If he's not here tomorrow, and we're in position to save the game. it will be Tom Gordon." 
Gordon has be,gn Rivera's pri­mary setup man this season. going 9-4 with a 2.21 ERA and four saves in 80 appearances. With Gordon and Paul Quantrill in the bullpen. Torre was able to limit Rivera's eighth-inning appearances and helped the closer save a career-high 53 games.

AP Atlanta Braves first baseman Adam LaRoche hangs his head as a home run by the Houston Astros' Jeff Bagwell sails over the fence. The Astros won the game 12-3 to clinch the first postseason series win in team history. 
Astros rout Atlanta to n1ove on to NLCS 
Associated Press 

ATLANTA -It took 43 years, but the Houston Astros are finally postsea­son winners. 
Carlos Beltran hit two more homers and drove in five runs, while original Killer B's Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell chipped in during a five-run seventh inning that carried the Astros to a 12-3 rout of the Atlanta Braves on Monday night in the deciding Game 5 of their first-round NL playoff series. 
The Astros snapped an 0· for· 7 record of futility in the playoffs against their longtime nemesis. The Braves eliminated Houston in 1997. '99 and '01, but they couldn't escape their own postseason demons this time. 
Atlanta has lost Game 5 of the division series three years in a row -all at Turner Field. The second­largest crowd in franchise history. 54,068, saw anoth­er familiar ending. 
The team that proudly displays 13 straight divi­sion titles still has only one World Series to show for it. This marked the fifth straight year that the Braves' season ended at the Ted. 
This one was especially dismal. equaling the worst postseason loss in fran­chise history . 
Next up for the wild-card Astros is a matchup against Central Division rival St. Louis in the NL championship series start­ing Wednesday night at Busch Stadium. 
Houston jumped ahead 3-0 on Braves starter Jaret Wright, scoring two in the second and adding to their lead when Beltran home­red into the Atlanta bullpen in the third. 
The Braves had the big crowd roaring in the fifth. Rafael Furcal led off with a homer against Roy Oswalt, and Johnny Estrada hit another into the seats with two outs, pulling Atlanta to 3-2. 
But Beltran, acquired from Kansas City in .June, quickly turned the tide back in Houston's favor. 
He started the sixth with a towering drive off Wright that just cleared the right­field wall. 
The Astros were back in control. The Braves were done. 
Unlike Los Angeles a night earlier, Atlanta play· ers didn't come out when it was over to shake the vic­tors' hands. 
Oswalt, pitching on three days' rest for only the sec­ond time this season, made it through five innings. 
IN BRIEF 

No end in siJ;!ht for 
Dolphins' QB problems 
DAVIE, Fla. -Injuries to Jay Fiedler and A.J. Feeley left Miami's unsettled quarterback situation more muddled than ever. 
Fiedler was sore after aggravating a rib injury in Sunday's 24-10 Joss at New England, and he's unsure whether he'll to play when Miami visits Buffalo in a matchup of the NFL's only winless teams. Feeley suf­fered a concussion on Miami's final offensive play against the Patriots, but he said he felt fine Monday and would be ready against the Bills. 
Coach Dave Wannstedt said that both would be re-evaluated Wednesday, and that Fiedler would start if healthy. 
If neither Fiedler nor Feeley is available, Sage Rosenfels will make his first NFL start. 
"The ribs are tender right now," Fiedler said Monday. 'Til take it day by day and see how it goes." 
Fiedler's agent, Bnan Levy, said the quarterback cracked a rib. 
Feeley was in the game for only two plays and walked off the field in a daze after being hit by Roosevelt Colvin after throwing a fourth-down pass that fell incomplete. Feeley said he didn't remember the play after the game, but remembered every· thing_ MondayEnd to Uodgers' season ends Ventura's career 
LOS ANGELES-Robin Ventura retired in a fashion befitting his 16· year career -timely and with little fanfare. 
Ventura told teammates of his deci­sion last week, but waited until the Dodgers' postseason run ended Sunday night to make his announce­ment public. ''I'm absolutely positive. I've realized that it's time to go, and that's it," Ventura said after the Los Angeles Dodgers lost to St. Louis 6-2. eliminating them from the NL play­offs. 
Ventura, 37, played nine years with the Chicago White Sox, two with the New York Mets and 2 1/2 with the Yankees before finishing up with 1 1/2 seasons in Los Angeles -less than 200 miles from where he grew up.American swimmer breaks

It had been a quiet game. 
There had been a combined 39 yards of total offense mid­way through the second. But now St. Edward's was rolling on a 69-yard drive. A questionable spot made what looked to be a first down into fourth-and-one on the 22. The momentum. was stopped and St. Ed's offense was unable to recover for the rest of the game as they lost 20­0 to Siegfried. 
No longer hampered by penalties (25 yards on the first possession), Siegfried's offense came alive. They capitalized on the turnover and marched 78 yards down the field in a drive that lasted just under five min­utes. With 30 seconds Siegfried completed a 35-yard pass for 6 points. 
St. Ed's looked to hit a deep one just before half, but Si(~gfried was not done. On the first play from scrimmage. the Ramblers forced and recovered a fumble. But with only seconds left, the Hamblers were not able to hit the more than a 40-yard field goal. 
At half. St. Ed's coaching staff recognized that Siegfried would have to go the air as their ground game had been stag­nant, saying, "They are going to keep it in the air." 
This is exactly what Siegfried did scoring twice more through the air and racking up 192 passing yards on 11-15 passing for the game. 
St. Ed's did have some bright spots, especially on defense. The team allowed Siegfried only to ramble for 8 yards on 12 car­ries aftnr sacks. It was also able to pick off Siegfried's backup quarterback and block an extra point. 
Siegfried's defense also had good showing. The Hamblers gave up only 77 yards (28 in the S(~cond half). Carroll 17, Fisher 10

the oll'ense of Carroll Hall in the final minutes of this contest as they charged 80 yards down­field with time running out to complete a comeback win. 
A 15-yard touchdown pass completed by Carroll quarter­back Kory Wilmot to wide receiver Kyle Kownacki com­pleted the drive with a touch­down and almost guaranteed victory for the Vermin. 
The drive that led to a Vermin victory began with under three minutes remaining in the game and Carroll backed up on its own 20-yard line. Wilmot went 6-for-7 on the drive, amassing 65 yards in the air, and 15 yards on the ground. He hit three different receivers to carry the Vermin down the field. Mike Versagli caught two passes for 25 yards and Kownacki caught the final pass to win the game. Also in on the drive was freshman wide receiver Mike Valuzzo, who caught three passes for a little over 30 yards. 
Carroll was down by 10 near the end of the first half, but a 24-yard field goal by kicker Preston Carter put the score at 10-3 at the end of the half. Then late in the third quarter, Carroll drove down the field sparked by a 31-yard pass to Versagli. The drive ended with a 1-yard run by Wilmot for a touchdown. 
The extra point that followed did not find the uprights howev­er, and Fisher remained in the lead at 10-9. Several three-and­out drives followed for both teams, until the 80-yard drive that ended the game. 
"! knew there was a long way to go, but it was just a matter of time and finding the open guys," Wilmot said. 
Carroll tries to complete its season undefeated on Wednesday against Sorin, although it also is guaranteed an appearance in the postsea­son. Knott 7, Sorin 6 
Knott saves face this season, improving to 2-2; and Sorin missed another close one and slips to 0-3. 
The outcome of the game was decided during the first half where both teams made their scores. Knott struck first with a 58-yard rush from .John Lyons. Lyons finished as the game's leading rusher. 
Sorin made countered with a drive of its own during the last minutes of the first half. Quarterback and captain Collin O'Keefe hooked up with Chris Paley for a 30-yard touchdown pass to close out the half. However, the Otters missed the extra point. 
The second half was lacklus­ter in scoring and the missed extra point came back to haunt Sarin. 
Despite this, there appeared to be hope during the last drive of the game by the Otters. In the last minutes of play Sorin nailed two first downs and was in striking distance of the end zone. However, an interception by Knott's Trey Patrick ensured a Knott victory. 
In what appeared to be a sloppy game, there were some bright spots. Sarin's quarter­back, Collin O'Keefe passed for 148 yards, completing 10-of-21 pass attempts. However, the final interception may have cost the Otters the game. 
"There were a couple balls I missed," O'Keefe said. "I proba­bly made the wrong call there at the end." 
Knott's defensive line played a great game. They racked up four sacks and caused Sorin to incur negative rushing for the game. 
Sunday's victory makes the Juggs eligible for the playoffs. It depends on how other teams finish off their seasons. Even though this could have been the last game of the season for Knott, captain Joe McCarthy is looking ahead. 
"Our offense struggled," he said. "We really need to get our offense back in sync. Our goal all season has been dorm champs, that hasn't changed."

Water polo wins with short bettch 


Special to The Observer 
A short-handed Notre Dame men's water polo club won three of four Great Lakes Conference games this weekend at Toledo. The Irish only had one player on the bench when they opened play against the host Rockets. Led by Matt McNicholas and Mike Grow, the Irish rolled to a 17-6 victory. Greg Szewczyk, Zhan-Wei Khaw, Colin Dunn, and Steve Shepard all scored as 
well in the rout, while Jay Nunez filled in at goal for Scott Tagwerker. 
In Saturday's second game, the No. 17 Irish squared off against nemeses No. 4 Grand Valley State. As usual, the game came down to the closing sec­onds. Goals from McNicholas, Shepard, Khaw, Szewczyk, and Grow kept the Irish close throughout the entire game, but with time running out. McNicholas narrowly missed a shot from two meters as the Irish fell 14-13. 
The Irish rebounded on Sunday, cruising to victories over Western Michigan, 22-8, and Ball State, 24-5. Mike Grow moved to goal and Nunez returned to field play where he was among the scoring leaders. 
This weekend, the Irish will head to Northwestern to chal­lenge a field featuring many of the nationally ranked top-25 teams. Men's Rowing 
Sixty club teams descended upon Rockford, Ill., this weekend for the Head of the Rock Regatta, where the Notre Dame men's rowing club had a day of great performances. The varsity squad competed in open dou­bles, open eight, open four and lightweight four events on the 
2.75 mile river course. 
The highlight of the day was the stellar performance of the lightweight four wltlich came in fourth out of eight teams and medaled with a time of 17:58. The open fours also had a strong showing against intense competition from the University of Michigan, Purdue and Northwestern. Michigan won the event with a time of 15:42.28 and the three Notre Dame boats took 16th, 22nd, and 27th with times of17:16.19,l8:10.91, and 19:17.91, respectively. 
The Irish also pulled competi­tive times in the men's double event with Evan Donoghue and Dave Mercante taking fourth place with a time of 17:42. The other men's doubles had great rows as well putting up scores of 18:37, 18:52, and 18:56 taking sixth, seventh and eighth place. The open eight was a hotly con­tested race with the University of Michigan claiming the victory with a time of 14:05. The top NO varsity boat was not far behind with a time of 15:02 taking tenth place and the other two boats rowing a 15:40 and 16:31 to take 13th and 20th place. 
The Novice Crew had a stellar showing for their first race of the fall season. In the Novice fours the rowers came in with a time of 19:36.12 to take tenth place in a field oil strong com­petitors including the winner. the University of Minnesota. In the eights the men proved to be tough competition with times of 
17:29.64 and 18:09.24 to take 12th and 16th places in a field of 23 strong novice boats. 
The team had a strong show­ing and expects to build on their successes at the Head of the Elk race in Elkhart on Oct. 31st. 
Field Hockey 
Notre Dame's field hockey club played host to Buffalo and Ohio State this Sunday at Riehle Field. The Irish split their two games, beating Buffalo 3-0 before dropping a 1-0 defensive struggle against a Buckeyes squad that included seven men on the field in their coed lineup. 
In the opener, Flebecca Mosca and Eleanor Bradley fired_home first half goals and Kaitlin Moran registered an insurance goal in the second half to secure the victory. Coalie Leigh Madeira stopped all three shots on goal. 
Madiera anchored a rock solid defense that w.:ts pressured throughout the game by a physi­cal Buckeye attack, and had eight saves. only giving up a goal at the close of thf: first half. The Irish made some adjustments at the half and forced several scor­ing chances of their own after intermission, but could not get a shot past a strong Ohio State goalie. The Irish will next travel to Kent and Ashland for a pair of games in three weeks.

WOMEN'S INTERHALL GOLD WRAPS 
Defense carries Lyons to victory 
Howard gets first win; Lewis and Welsh Family battle to scoreless tie 
By TOM DORWART, RAMA 
OOJTUMUKKALA and KATE 
SERYAK 
Sports \~'mus 
Defense wins championships. 
Lyons' defense, at least. boost­ed them into the playoffs. The steady unit. for the third game in a row, gave up fewer than seven points. 
Lyons beat Badin 6-0 Sunday at the West Quad fields in the final game of the regular season for both teams. 
"Our defense has been strong all year." freshman linebacker Judith Kaczmarek said. "We were motivated." 
When the clock hit zero. the celebration began. 
"When we won. everyone just rushed onto the field and was screaming and cheering," Kaczmarek said. 
Deadlocked in a 0-0 defensive battle with Badin. Lyons punched in the game's only score with minutes remaining in the first half. Quarterback Traci Kazrnerski connected on a 15­yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Meghan Regan. 
Six points was enough to hold off the defending champs of Badin as both defenses contin­ued to dominate. Minutes into the second half. Badin drove to the Lyons 2-yard line. Lyons' unwavering defense made a goal line stand to keep the lead. 
"Their defense played well." Badin captain Stephanie Heath said. "Our offense didn't play to its potential. We've played much better than that." 
Now, Badin must play the waiting game to find out if its 3­3 record earns them the final playoff spot. 
"We're just waiting to hear. [The season) is a little disap­pointing," Heath said. "We weren't really consistent. Corning off of last year. we lost a lot of starters. Hopefully we'll still make the playoffs." 
Lyons (3-1-2) secured a playoff berth with the win. They pre­pare for the postseason with great confidence. 
''Welsh Family was ranked No. 1 in our league, and we only lost to them by six, so we know we're going to be really competi­tive in the playoffs." junior line­backer Mosey Nuccio said. 
With a two week lay-off before the frrst playoff game. the Lyons players are eager to get back on the fteld. 
"It's weird not to have prac­tice," freshman Joanna Collins said. "At least our season can keep going." 
Howard 12, Off..Campus 0 
AndJhen there was one. 
With their 12-0 victory over Off-Campus on Sunday, Howard (1-3-1) got their frrst win of the season and left Off-Campus (0-5) as the sole winless team in the women's Gold League. 
Putting together an impressive defensive stand. the Ducks recorded their first shutout in three years. Howard's defensive unit remained sharp throughout the game. 
"Defensively. we really came together." Howard captain Callie Whelan said. "We were on the ball all the time and shut them down as a team." 
The Ducks did most of their damage in the frrst half. scoring on a touchdown pass from quar­terback Laura Plis and taking command when Catherine Krug intercepted an Off-Campus pass and took it back more than 20 yards for a back-breaking touchdown. 
Although Howard's offense cooled off in the second half. their defense remained alert. Giving up only a few first downs from quarterback scrambles. the Ducks kept Off-Campus out of the end zone. 
Playing a conservative game that slowly wound down the game clock. the Ducks closed their season with three consecu­tive quarterback kneels on their last possession. 
Although the Ducks didn't get their first win until the last game of the season. they played pro­gressively better throughout the course of the season. A late sea­son tie with Welsh Family. the No. 1 team. was just one memo­ry that the lloward players will be able to cherish from thL<> sea­son. 
"It was great seeing the improvement of the entire team." Whelan said. "Girls who had never touched a football before. in the end carne togeth­er, and it really gives us a lot of hope for next season." 
With a yotmg team consisting of only three juniors and one senior, the Ducks will look to reload next season and improve on a season where the team continued to gel with each game. 
"Probably the most exciting thing is that we're only losing one senior," Whelan said. "We're going to recruit girls right off the bat during Frosh-0 next year and then play with what we have already. And that should be really good." 
lewis 0, Welsh Family 0 
Four years ago, Lewis and Welsh met for the championship game in the stadium. Welsh Family won by a point that day and Lewis players have vowed that this will never happen again. 
On Sunday, they played true to their word. Sunday's showdown between 

the league-leader Welsh Family and No. 10 Lewis was a draw. l11is is the second 0-0 game for Lewis this year. who also tied with Lyons last week. Welsh also had a tie previous to this game. but it could lose the No. 1 rank­ing to Cavanaugh. who won this weekend. 
The tie, however, can be attributed to both teams' defens­es. 
Lewis had three interceptions. while Welsh had four. Welsh came the closest to scoring a touchdown right before half­time. The Whirlwinds success­fully completed a long pass to position themselves right in front of the goal line. but time ran out before they could score. 
Lewis played a solid defensive game, shutting out the No. 1 team when they were clearly the underdogs. 
"For defense, we came in knowing that we were going to have to play tight on the quarter back and receivers if we wanted to win or tie," Le·wis captain Julia Burke said. "We followed through with our plan and played a really clean game in general. Both teams played well." 
The only reason Lewis was unable to score any touchdowns is because this is a rebuilding year for their offense. according to Burke. 
"After last season, we lost our quarterback, several receivers and our coaches." Burke said. "So we were prepared to consid­er this a rebuilding year and in that light. I think we've done a wonderful job." 
Last year. Lewis was the run­ner-up in the stadium and surely this years· team will grow into a stadium-worthy. championship winning within the next four years. 
"It was a tough season for us. but we're really happy with how it turned out," Burke said.

Never underestimate your opponent. 
The Belles must keep this in the back of their heads today as they prepare to take on Tri­State University. lliC Thunder is still in search of its first MIAA win of the year having now gone 10 straight games without a victory. Meanwhile. the Belles cannot afford to drop another conference match if they hope to improve their current standing in the league. 
Saint Mary's comes into the contest with a record of 4-7 in conference play and 4-1 0 over­all. The Belles thumped Tri­State earlier this year when they dorrtinated the Thunder in the Saint Mary's Triangular. The victory marked their first win of the season after losing five straight to begin the 2004 campaign. 
In the contest. the Belles controlled the tempo through­out and swept the Thunder in three straight games. However. the team realizes that they

"We expect to see the same team as in our previous meet­ing," middle hitter Elise Rupright said. "We expect to win and nothing else. but we cannot come into the game and lie down." 
In their first meeting with the Thunder, Saint Mary's was led by the play of Shelly Bender and Elise Hupright on the offensive side of the ball. Bender put on a show against Tri-State University as she col­lected 18 kills in the match. Elizabeth Stohl and Anne Cusack supplied most of the damage on defense for Saint Mary's and helped the team cruise to an easy victory. . 
·i1le Belles are coming off of two straight losses against the number two and three teams in the MIAA. Before their recent skid, Saint Mary's was on a three-game winning 
streak and looking like a team ready to make a strong nm as they sat as high as fifth place in the conference.

Cavanaugh dominates Breen-Phillips 21-0 
PW edges McGlinn, Walsh dominates PE 
By BRAD WALLACE, ABBY 
RICHARDSON AND BRlAN CARDILE Sports Writers 
Like an army heading into battle. Cavanaugh marched to the West Quad with intensity and the will to win. and for 40 minutes showed a crowd of classmatr~s and families the way football is supposed to be played. 
From the first whistle. the game belonged to the Chaos (4-0-1 ), who dominated the highly-anticipated contest, boating Brcen-l'hillips (3-2), 21-0. 
Cavanaugh got started early. scoring on their first drive when quarterback Lisa Huffer hit Hache! Byrne for a quick touchdown. 
"Hight off the bat. we moved the ball all the way down the field." Huffer said. "Hache! was playing line, and I saw that she got open, so I hit her with the pass." 
The Chaos completed the two-point conversion, taking an 8-0 lead. The scoring con­tinued with a 3-yard touch­down pass from Huffer to Nancy l'owaga at thn end of the first half, and a 17-yard completion to Janice Flynn for the game's final score. 
"Tiw receivers did a great job getting open all game," Huffer said. "They adjusted to the defense well and ran pcr­fnct routes. This was a great game. Everyone played really well."

MLB 
Schilling set to take on Yanl<ees 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Curt Schilling signed with Boston for this very reason -to silence the hated Yankees and pitch the Red Sox to that elusive World Series title. 
''I'm not sure I can think of any scenario more enjoyable than making 55,000 people from New York shut up," he said Monday, a day before starting the opener at Yankee Stadium against Mike Mussina. 
Before the first pitch was even thrown, the AL championship series had players buzzing. They thought back to the 45 intense meetings between the rivals dur­ing the past two years, to the on­field fights and the clubhouse boasts. 
But in a series that seemed predestined since Aaron Boone's Game 7 homer off Tim Wakefield won last October's playoff in the 11th inning, there was an ele­ment of uncertainty for the Yankees this time. It centered on the status of closer Mariano Rivera. who returned to Panama on Sunday after two of his wife's relatives -a cousin and his son -were electrocuted in his swimming pool. 
Though Hivera said he'd be on hand for Tuesday night's game -"l am going back to New York tomorrow, after the funeral. and rejoin the team"-manager Joe Torre wasn't ta~ing anything for granted. 

"If he's here tomorrow, obvi­ously, it would be wonderful." Torre said. "Li not, we under­stand that." 
Tom Gordon, his left eye still a little blurry after it was hit by a champagne cork in Saturday's clubhouse celebration at Minnesota, would take over as the· closer if Ii:ivera is absent. Tanyon Sturtze and Paul Quantrill would replace Gordon as the setup man. 
While Gordon's good, he's not Hivera. No one else is. 
"I never had a problem with it. I enjoyed closing," Gordon said. "Whatever it takes for this team to get a win." 
Following Boston's first-round sweep of Anaheim and New York's 3-1 win over the Twins, Schilling and Mussina are rested heading into the opener. The Red Sox rotation has Pedro Martinez pitching Game 2 on Wednesday, followed by Bronson Arroyo on Friday at Fenway Park and Wakefield the following day in Game 4.

Even if Pasquerilla West loses, the Weasels may be able to sneak in if the chips fall in their favor. 
Although the team will know whether it needs a win to make the playoffs by the beginning of the game, the Weasels want to stay in control their own des­tiny. 
"We'd like to get that No. 3 seed on our own." Spring said. 
That will be a tall task for the WeaS<~Is. as they face a Breen­l'hillips team whose only two losses have come against unbeaten opponents. 
While Sunday's 21-point defeat stings, Feltault credits the point differential to an excellent Cavanaugh team, not to a poor performance. 
"We played a great game," she said. "but they are an excellent team." 
The Babes expect to balance the running and passing games to keep the Weasels off-balance.

Cavanaugh vs. 
Pasquerllla East 
Only one game remains on the schedule for the women of Cavanaugh and Pasquerilla East: only one more opportunity to show something before the regular season ends. With the playoffs looming, this rivalry game is all about who has shown the most improvement over the course of the regular season. 
"In previous years !Cavanaugh! has peaked at the wrong point in the season, but right now is a really good time for us to be hitting our stride," Chaos captain Sara Gilloon said. 
Coming into Tuesday's game against Pasquerilla East. a con­fident Cavanaugh boasts an undefeated 4-0-1 record, with a shutout in last Sunday's game against Breen Phillips. Helying on a team mentality, the Cavanaugh defensive squad has been strong all year, and is looking for another shutout 
.,.._­
against the rival Pyros . 
On the opposite end of the spectrum are the Pyros, who have struggled all season. Already having been shutout multiple times this season, the Pyros offense is looking to turn up the intensity, and put some points on the board, for this final game of the season. 
Even though they have already secured a spot in the playoffs. Cavanaugh refuses to look past Pasq uerilla East. Vowing to play the game like any other, the Chaos will hold nothing back in their quest to reach the stadium. 
On the offensive side of the ball, junior quarterback Lisa Huffer has been the key to Cavanaugh's success all year. 
"She is not only very accu­rate, but also one of the fastest players in the league," Gilloon said of Huffer. 
It will be up to the Pasquerilla East defense to try and shut down Huffer, but this may prove to be too tough of a task for the Pyros. Double-digit loses have plagued the Pyros all season, but they are still looking to fin­ish the season on a high note.

MEN'S INTERHALL GOLD LEAGUE WRAPS 
Stanford escapes with 0-0 tie against Morrissey on Sunday 

Knights take down Dawgs, Big Red shuts out Kangaroos 
By MIKE TENNANT, CHRIS 
KHOREY AND MIKE LASKEY 
Sports Writers 
Football is a game of inches, and Morrissey was just a few inches short Sunday. 
In what was a must-win game for both teams, Stanford and Morrissey battled to a 0-0 tic in a game full of strong defense and missed opportuni­ties. 
"It was the hardest we played all season," Morrissey captain Aaron Honsheim said. "Both teams couldn't put it in the end zone." 
The Manorites came within less than a yard of breaking the deadlock on the final play of the game. 
With 10 seconds to play, Morrissey quarterback Pete Spreitzer lined up at the Griffin 35-yard line and took one last shot at the end zone to receiver Tim Kenney. 
"We just had everyone go deep and make something hap­pen," Kenney said. "Pete just threw it up." 
Spreitzer connected with Kenney on the goal line, but the receiver was forced to lean forward to catch the throw, leaving the ball and the victory only inches away as time expired. 
The Manorites had a number of other opportunities to score, thanks to a defense that forced two fumbles and blocked a field goal. Ronsheim also had an interception. 
INFORMATION .fEfnON 
"Our secondary really stepped it up this week," Ronsheim said. "I think we held their passing attack in check." 
Leading the way for the Morrissey defense along with Ronsheim was Kenney at safety and Tony LoGuidice. 
"We just couldn't get our run­ning or passing game going," Griffin captain Vin Monaco said. 
The Stanford defense was equally impressive, forcing two Morrissey turnovers and stop­ping the Manorites twice inside the 10-yard line, including a goal line stand at the end of the first half. 
Instrumental in the stand was lineman Eric Medrick, who pulled double duty as both a defensive lineman and fullback for the Griffins. Monaco and fellow linebacker Brandon Bludau both had strong games as well. 
The Stanford offense just could not get going. 
"We have to start scoring touchdowns," Monaco said. "If our offense doesn't improve. we're toast in the playoffs." 
The Griffins still have post­season hope, and have one last game with O'Neill Thursday night. The Manorites, mean­while, ended their season against Stanford. and most likely will not make the play­offs. Keenan 13, Alumni 3 
Both Keenan and Alumni came into Sunday's contest highly regarded among inter­hall football teams. However, after the Dawgs limped off the field with a 13-3 defeat, there was no question that Keenan had the better team. 
Keenan held Alumni's power­ful running game to only 17 yards and allowed the Dawgs to move the chains just three times. The Knights' defense also forced five fumbles and recovered four of them. 
"It makes me really comfort­able to get a lead and let our defense do its job," Keenan captain Pat Downey said. 
Downey said his team doesn't work on forcing fumbles in practice, but he instead credits the turnovers to hard work. 
"We just play hard and try to make things happen," he said. 
Keenan was equally impres­sive on offense, rushing for 115 yards led by Alex Staffieri's 72 yards on 15 carries. 
Quarterback Eric Laumann completed 5-of-8 passes for only 68 yards, but did complete a 41-yard pass to set up the Knight's first touchdown. 
"We've been an aerial show the last couple weeks," Downey said. "We showed our balance this game." 
Keenan started the game with the ball and moved it quickly upfield with running by Staffieri, but a fumble gave the Dawgs possession. 
Alumni, however, returned the favor and coughed up the ball on their first play from scrimmage. The very next play, Laumann completed the pass for a 41-yard gain to the Alumni 15-yard line. 
Four plays later, Laumann carried the ball over the goal line on a naked bootleg. 
The teams exchanged punts until halftime, with Alumni fail­ing to make a first down until the last play of the half. 
In the second half. Alumni used at 39-yard pass to set up their only points of the game, a 44-yard field goal. 

After stopping the Knights on fourth-and-inches the next drive, the Dawgs fumbled again and Keenan ran out most of the rest of the game with a 14 play, 55-yard touchdown drive. 
"In the fourth quarter, we had a lead and we put it on the offensive line," Downey said. "We just said 'We're going to run the ball right at them' and we took up most of the fourth quarter with that drive." 
Fullback Reid Langdon, who finished the game with 38 yards rushing, had two impor­tant third down conversions on counter plays. 
"He broke a lot of tackles," Downey said. "Those two first down runs were key." 
Dillon 20, Keough 0 
Defensive dominance and efficient offensive production led the Dillon Big Red to a 20-0 pounding of the Keough Kangaroos on Sunday. 
The victory improved Dillon's record to 2-0-1, while the set­back for Keough marked its fourth in a row, ending the Kangaroos' season without a victory. 
Dillon was most impressive on the defensive side of the ball, not allowing a first down all afternoon and forcing four Keough turnovers. 
"Every game, our goal is to go crazy," linebacker Dan Avants said, who contributed a forced fumble and an intercep­tion to Dillon's defensive effort. "We want to come out defen­sively prepared." 
After losing its two running backs early in the season, Keough has been forced to rely on its passing game, which Dillon effectively subdued the entire game. 
"This was the third team that believed that they could pass on us," Avants said. "And this was the third team that we shut down." 
The Big Red's defensive line harassed Keough's quarterback all afternoon, forcing despera­tion passes toward receivers who constantly found them­selves shadowed by Dillon's secondary. 
The Dillon squad took advan­tage of good field position, gar­nered by Keough turnovers, to reach the end zone three times. Running their trademark t­wing offense, the Big Red kept the ball on the ground, capped off by John Leyhane's 35-yard touchdown run in the third 
quarter. 
"[That hole) was open all day," Leyhane said. "I just fol­lowed my block5." 
Keough's struggles against Dillon could be attributed in part its severely limited roster. which included just 14 players on Sunday. 
"It's hard to keep up the intensity when your front eight guys have to play both ways," Keough captain Brian Kusper said. 
With the victory Sunday, Dillon all but wrapped up a spot in the playoffs, set to begin after fall break. However, the Big Red has one regular season game remaining that has been circled on its sched­ule since the first week of the season. 
Thursday night, Dillon will take on the Alumni Dawgs, the Big Red's archrival. Yearlong bragging rights will be up for grabs when the two teams square off in this annual match-up. which kicks off "Rivalry Week" between the halls. 
Avants, a freshman, is excit­ed to become a part of the longstanding ri,valry. 
"I came onto this team for two reasons from Day 1." Avants said. "One was to make the playoffs. and the other was to beat Alumni. We have the first one taken care of, but I won't be satisfied unless we take care of the second one too."

out of .Jordan Cornette's hands during a team picture. Players took jump shots one minute and sat down with reporters tlw next. But the playfulness shifted more towards business when anyone -player, coach or reporter -mentioned the NIT. 
"Those three letters are out of our vocabulary. that's for sure," forward Jordan Cornette said. "But I'm break­ing it down. Look. there are a couple goals we want for this team. First. we're starting with the early non-conference stuff. The llarvards [and I the IPFWs. We've got to take those u~ams like they're any team. We've got to take care of them. Tlwn we look into the confer­Pnce sclwdule. 
"Then we want to get a con­f'l~n~nce tith~." he said. "We want to hang a banner in here. Then we want to move on in tlw tournanwnt and sec how far we go there. But nobody's sitting here saying Final Four right now. I mean that's in our heads, but there's a couple steps you've got to take bnfore you get thnrc." 
Those steps include road vis­its to Michigan (Dec. 4) and Indiana (Dec. 8) on the 2004­05 Irish schedule. Notre Dame is sr.t to play Connecticut, Gtwrgetown, Pittsburgh, Syracuse and Villanova all twice on its Big East confer­ence schcd ule. 
The formidable schedule provides the Irish with quality oppmwnts to boost their HPI (Hatings P1~rcentage Index). 
"That's what we want to do," Brey said. "We want to get an automatic bid or an at-large bid. Let's boil it down to brass facts here." 
Notre Dame finished the 2003-04 season with a 19-13 record and worked through injuries to key players in sum­mer practice. Chris Thomas had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee and Francis had surgery to repair a herniated disk, among other ailments to forwards Rick Cornett and Rob Kurz. 
Notre Dame begins practice Saturday on the first day the NCM allows teams to practice with coaches. Brey said not all injured players are 100 per­cent but the team has recov­ered well enough. 
"I think when we practice Saturday morning, we have 10 scholarship guys. everybody but Kurz will be on the floor," the coach said. 
Brey has his first chance Saturday to see the cntirn team. including the additions of forward Omari Isreal ­who rcd-shirted as a freshman -and Arizona transfer Dennis Latimore. 
The practice begins a cam­paign Brcy and the players said they look forward to. Some players called the team thny saw in the summer "spe­cial." 
On Saturday, the anticipation ends. 
"With Thomas. Cornette and Francis, Quinn, especially, I've kind of Jet them dictate the goals a little bit," Brey said. "And if they say [the team is ready) now. we're going to make them back it up."

Irish hope streak doesn't end 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 

Forty years, forty wins. And the Irish would like to keep it that way. 
Notre Dame faces Navy Saturday in East Rutherford, 
N.J. in a matchup that has been won by the Irish since 1964. 
The Midshipmen certainly appear capable of ending that streak this season, however. Navy has started the year 5-0 and currently has the nation's sixth-best running attack at an average of 267.4 yards per game. 
"They have the talent and they are a good team," Irish guard Dan Stevenson said. "The thing that they do is that they never quit playing. They'll play you until the very end. You can't really look at

WOMEN'S INTERHALL BLUE LEAGUE 
PW and BP battle for playoff position 
By KEN FOWLER, NATHAN DYER AND TOM STILES Sports Writers 
When Pasquerilla West meets Breen-Phillips tonight, Weasel receiver Maureen Spring expects emotions to run high for both teams. 
"Both teams have three wins and are battling for a playoff spot," she said. "We're coming off a good win, and hopefully we'll cap­ture another one." 
Babes captain Jajmie Feltault agrees on the analy­sis, but hopes for a different outcome. 
"It's a crucial game," she said. "We're looking to rebound from our loss [on Sunday to Cavanaugh] and take home a strong win to end the regular season." 
As for post-season possibil­ities, Feltault knows that there is slim chance of Breen-Phillips making the round of' eight without a vic­tory tonight. 
"It would be helpful to just win tomorrow so we don't have to worry about that pos­sibility," Feltault said. 
At 3-2. Breen-Phillips is currently fourth in the league. closely trailing Pasquerilla West's 3-1-1 record for third place. . 
Coming off a 7-0 win Sunday against McGlinn, Pasquerilla West hopes to capitalize on its momentum and secure the third seed in the Women's Blue League.
