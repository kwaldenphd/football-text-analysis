ND eyes 2008 presidential election 
Students, professors scrutinize Clinton, Obama, Brownback, Edwards, other hopefuls 
By EILEEN DUFFY Assistant News Editor 
With election 2008's Iowa pri­maries less than a year away, as presidential hopefuls hustle to announce their candidacies, the politically minded on Notre Dame's campus are analyzing the field and, in some cases, itching to back their personal favorite. 
The 2008 presidential election marks the first time in 80 years that neither the sitting president nor sitting vice president is run­ning for the job, leaving the door wide open for potential candi­dates. 
One by one, they're walking through. On the Democratic side, Sen. Hillary Clinton (N.Y), former 
Sen. John Edwards (N.C.) and Gov. Bill Richardson (N.M.) have proclaimed their intentions to run for pres­ident, and Sen. Barack Obama 


(Ill.) said he will Clinton make an offi­cia! announcement on Feb. 10. 
Sen. Sam Brownback (Kan.) is one of a few Republicans officially in the running, but potential Republican candidates include Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), former mayor of New York City Rudy 
Giuliani and former Speaker of the U.S. House Newt Gingrich. 
The open­ness of the race, coupled with front­


loadjng in the t Brownback nomination procedure -that is, slating cau­cuses and primaries for early in 2008 -is prompting hopefuls to 
announce their candidacies so 
early, said American Studies pro­
fessor Robert Schmuhl. The can­
didates are likely to be set by 
February of 
that year, he 
said. When it

"I am not surprised by the results at all," Hodges said. "I am just surprised how close it was." 
Ferreira found no security in holding the lead during the pre­liminary vote. 
"It is an election. It could go either way at any time," she said. 
Hodges and Payne ran a dedi­cated campaign and attributed their success to their persist­ence. The pair said the main difference between winning and losing was meeting new people.

Kim Hodges and Kelly Payne came away with a narrow vic­tory over opponents Colleen Ferreira and Jenny Antonell(in the Saint Mary's student body presidential and vice presiden­tial elections Thursday. 
The pair received 300 total votes over Ferreira and Antonelli's 263 votes. The two tickets met in a runoff when the results from Tuesday's prelimi­nary knocked out third ticket Annie Davis and Courtney Kennedy. 
Hodges-Payne clinched the victory by less than 10 percent in the runoff with 52.2 percent versus Perreira-Antonelli's 45.7 percent.

Keenan Revue tickets sell out in 13 Ininutes

News Writer 
Tickets for the Keenan Revue, a traditionally irrev­erent annual production, sold out at a rate of more than 100 per minute Thursday. 
"It was a great and rousing success," said sophomore ticket seller Peter Vignali, 
Vignali and fellow ticket seller senior Johnny McDermott experienced a busy afternoon distributing tickets to one of the most­anticipated campus shows of the year. 
The Revue is a sketch come­dy production run by Keenan Hall that pokes fun at various aspects -and people -of the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's communities. 
Tickets were distributed Thursday at Saint Mary's from 1 p.m. to 3 and at Notre Dame from 4 p.m. to 6 at the Joyce Center. 
Showing up early was a good strategy for getting tick­ets, which were gone in 13 minutes. 
"The first people showed up at the JACC at 1:15 and [tick­et distribution] didn't start until 4," McDermott said. "We were cleaned up and out of there by 4:20." 
Tickets for the Thursday and Saturday night perform­ances went fastest.

Suspension provokes debate 
Students divided over McAlarney decision 
By JOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
The University decided Monday how to deal with Notre Dame basketball player Kyle McAlarney's marijuana posses­sion charges -suspension from Notre Dame -but stu­dents are still grappling with the case and its outcome. 
Many students said they sup­port the decision to suspend the sophomore guard -who was pulled over and arrested near campus early on Dec. 29 -and hailed it as consistent with du Lac, while others expressed frustration with what they saw as unfair aspects of University policy. 
"This was a big punishment, but it was dese.rved," freshman Jill Schroeder said. "It sends the message there's no special treatment for athletes and the policy is fair." 
But students like junior Jake Watson said the University over­reacted to the arrest since mari­juana was involved -an issue not just for McAlarney, he said, but any student caught for pos­session. 
"They'll just fine someone $15 for getting caught with a beer in the hallway underage, but I know people who got kicked out of the school for having pot," he said. "Really, this should be a less severe offense than under-

Fantasy 
filtns on 
the rise 
The fantasy film is the hot thing in Hollywood right now and no one is the worse off for it. 
Since the "Lord of the Rings" phe­nomenon, films have been released that have taken 
Marty Schroeder
the fantasy genre to new places and audi­Assistant ences to worlds 
Scene Editor 
they never thought existed. 
Well, what do I mean when I say fantasy? Some would say it means only those stories that are similar to "Lord of the Rings" in which valiant humans and elves too snob­by for their own good fight evil orcs or some other devil that is threat­ening to take over the world, Middle Earth or whatever the bat­tlefield of the film might be called. 
I would like to take a more gener­al approach. This year, the third installment in the "Shrek" series will be released with rumors of a few more. Those few could include a "Puss in Boots" film similar to the way the "X-Men" film series is branching off into films about exclusive characters, such as Wolverine. 
These films have captured the hearts of children and adults alike, and while many will say the origi­nal was the best, the creative team at DreamWorks is still motivated enough by the competition from Pixar to release what I think will be an extremely delightful film. 
Perhaps the film that has gotten to most press concerning the fanta­sy genre is last year's Academy Award nominated "Pan's Labyrinth." From the wild imagina­tion of Mexican director Guillermo del Toro, this film brought adults to the fantasy realm and pulled it away from the nerds who know every elven king to have ever exist­ed and the kids who only want to see the donkey make fun of Shrek more. "The Lord of the Rings" trilo­gy and "Shrek" series are great films, but the way del Toro paral­lels the human world and fantasy world is amazing. This is where fantasy films are going and where I hope they continue to go. 
This may all be a flash in the pan, you say. However, there are more fantasy films on the horizon. "The Hobbit" details are still being worked out but an adaptation of the children's book, "Bridge to Terabithia" is due out this year along with the film adaptation of the wonderful Neil Gaiman story, "Stardust." Fantasy films are here to stay and the cinema, it seems, has found something that lets audi­ences find worlds they never could have imagined. · 
And if anyone is wondering how many elven kings there were in the history of Middle Earth, just come find me.

NJ  warns:  Don't  eat  
squirrels near dump  
TRENTON, N.J.  - New  

Jersey has warned squirrel hunters near a toxic waste dump about consuming the critters because they could be contaminated with lead. 
It is the first time the state has cautioned Ringwood residents ­many who are members of the Ramapough Mountain Indian tribe who hunt and fish in the area -about their squirrel intake, said Tom Slater, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Senior Services. 
A lead-contaminated squirrel was found in the 
area two months ago, prompting the agency, along with the state Department of Environmental Protection, to send out letters advising that adults eat squirrel no more than twice a week and even less for children and pregnant women. 
Lead, which is harmful in small amounts, can damage the nervous system, red blood cell production and the kidneys. 
Drug dog sniffs on despite death threats 
LETICIA, Colombia ­She's had a price on her head since 2004 and a 24­hour guard monitors her food for poisoning. For a 5-year-old, she has made a lot of enemies. 


But none of this keeps Agata, a golden Labrador who is one Colombia's best drug-sniffing dogs, from doing her job. 
Stationed in the southern Amazon River border town of Leticia, Agata works at the local airport. She is the only Colombian police dog to have a contract put out on her by drug smugglers tired of having their goods confiscated.

Faculty tnetnber wins tninority poetry a-ward 
Aragon chosen out of 115 nominated artists 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 
The Rhode Island Alliance of Artist Communities select­ed Francisco Aragon, director of "Latinas Letras" of the Institute of Latino Studies at Notre Dame, as one of the 
seven  recipients  of  the  
Midwestern  Visions  and  
Voices Award.  

Funded by the Joyce Foundation, the award aims to increase the number of emerging minority artists who attend artist residencies. There were 115 total nomi­nated artists and writers. 
"My responsibility as a Latino writer is to be the best writer that I can be," Aragon said. "I am of the opinion that any writer, regardless of eth­nicity, should be able to write whatever they want in what­ever style they want. It is important to try to get a bet­ter variety of voices in the mainstream. Latino writers sometimes have it more diffi­cult because they are expect­ed to write in a certain way." 
Aragon, who has never attended an artist residency before, will have the opportu­nity to dedicate an entire month to writing. The resi­
dency will be an opportunity to complete his second book of poetry, he said. 
Aragon will spend the entire month of September at the Anderson Center for Interdisciplinary Studies located in Red Wing, Minn. 
"The job I have at Notre Dame is a nine to five job, so having this free time is very welcome," Aragon said. "I've never been to Minnesota and I understand that the area I am going to is quite beauti­ful." 
Aside from his second book of poetry, Aragon is currently working on translating a col­lection of poems from Spanish to English by the Nicaraguan poet, Ruben Darfo. 
Aragon recently edited a book of poetry entitled "The Wind Shifts: New Latino Poetry," which will be pub­lished this year. 
As assistant resident spe­cialist of the Institute of Latino Studies, Aragon teach­es in the English department and also holds creative writ­ing workshops. 
"I believe it is important to help out other writers to try to form bridges and form a sort of community," Aragon said. 
Aragon plans to return to Notre Dame after he com­pletes his residency.

Students head to Iraq -war protest 
D.C. trip part of national peace rally 
BySONIARAO News Writer 
Thirty Notre Dame students will join herds of protesters Saturday in Washington D.C. to speak out against the war in Iraq, three days following U.S. President George W Bush's State of the Union address. 
The protest is sponsored by the United for Peace and Justice coalition, and will be comple­mented by musical performanc­es, workshops and guest speak­ers. 
Sophomore Michael Angulo, vice president of the Progressive Student Alliance, attended a war protest September of his fresh­man year and decided to organ­ize a trip for Notre Dame stu­dents. 
"At the end of last semester I found that the United for Peace and Justice [coalition] was organizing a national protest in D.C. ... I talked to some friends and there was some interest in getting vans and Notre Dame students to go," he said. 
Vans will be leaving from Notre Dame starting at 9:30 a.m. Friday to make the nine and a half hour trip to Washington. The march will begin at 11 a.m. Saturday, weaving around vari­ous governmental buildings and stopping in front of the White House, Angulo said. 
In addition to the march, keynote speakers will include the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins and Jane Fonda, according to the United for Peace and Justice Web site. ' 
Angulo said he was excited to see Notre Dame students inter­ested in activism. 
''I'm really glad to see that more people, especially moder­ate middle-class America, are really showing their opposition. ... [The protest] is going to bring a lot of different groups together whether it's the people who were against the war from the begin­ning or the people who thought the war wasn't handled well and based on faulty information." 
For freshman Laura Lauck, the tipping point was learning that President Bush believed "the war will be over by the time he's done with his presidency, which is two years from now," and realized two years was too long to wait. 
"The United States needs to get done what they have to get done, but they need to relinquish some of their power to the United Nations or some other international organization," she said. 
Freshman Dan Savage has a more personal reason for travel­ing to Washington, as a family friend recently died in Iraq. He also has other motives, however. 
''I'm doing it because I think it's important to remind the President that ... he didn't have the majority of the population to win his presidency and that to act with such disregard to oppo­sition without consideration of bipartisanship at all was wrong," he said.

Gurule uncovers terror finances 
Special to The Observer 
As Jimmy Gurule faces stu­dents in his spring semester class "The Law of Terrorism," he knows his audience is will­ing to delve into the complexi­ties that al-Qaeda, and global terrorism in general, present. 
Too often, says the professor of law, other groups -the pub­lic, media and politicians, in particular -have been willing to settle for more simple, black-and-white perspectives, that take a hard line of cer­tainty. 
"But the issues are extreme­ly complex, defying simple res­olution," he said. 
Gurule is among a number of international legal experts who have gained firsthand insight on how the terrorist attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001, have dra­matically changed the law, both domestically and interna­tionally. 
His perspective on the recent conviction and hanging-execu­tion of former Iraq leader Saddam Hussein is informed by his participation, in spring 2004, in a Judicial Conference on Rule of Law in Iraq. The meetings, in The Hague, assembled the Iraqi judges who would later try Hussein. Some had been incarcerated under the dictator; all had lived under his iron fist.

Ferreira and Antonelli did not return Observer phone calls Thursday night. 
The· election itself was "typical," elections commissioner Christin Molnar said. 
"The turnout was pretty average, but there were more people who voted in the runoff than the prelimi­nary, which was different," she said. 
While Hodges-Payne were victori­ous, Molnar saw potential in each of the three original tickets. 
"All three [tickets] had strong points," she said. "Some had less feasible ideas, but they all wanted it and probably would have done a good job." 
Ferreira echoed Molnar's confi­dence in the candidates.

is likely to earn the candidacy. McCain is too centrist on most issues, she said, and while Giuliani will get mcognition for the post-Sept. 11 work he did in New York, Way said "he's pretty liberal on a lot of domes­tic issues." 
In any case, Way pointed out, there's a lot of time before Nov. 2008 -time fbr journalists to dig deep. 
"As soon as the media starts to really scrutinize these peo­ple," she said, "a lot of things could change." 
Hight now, though, standing out from the crowd are Obama and Clinton, who recently shared the cover of Time mag­azine and prompted a New York Times article to ask who America would be more likely to elect as president: a woman, or a person of color? 
Clinton's tough road 
A woman, the Times con­cluded. Still, political science associate professor Christina Wolbrecht thinks Clinton has a tough road ahead of her. 


"Any woman running for office, especially for the presi­dency, will have a hard time getting past our predetermined notions of what we think an executive leader looks like," she said. 
Schmuhl cited "strength, intelligence, command and· empathy" as essential charac­teristics for a leader -but can a female display that com­mand, wonders Wolbrecht, "without acting against her own gender?" . 
"She certainly is doing every­thing she can to counter a per­ception of potential weakness," Schmuhl said, citing Clinton's involvement in the Services Committee, her trips to military bases domestically and abroad, and her original vote to support the war in Iraq -a vote she ha..<; not called a mistake, unlike other presidential candidates. 
Clinton also has a powerful force in her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who can act as either an asset or a lia­bility for her. While many have fond memories of the Clinton years, Wolbrecht said, and Bill Clinton is incredibly charismat­ic, that itself can pose a chal­

"How do you use him? Bring him to an event and have him give a speech?" Wolbrecht said. "You have to remind yourself that not very many people are as good of a speaker as Bill ... including her." 
While Hillary Clinton has cer­tainly had success in her own right as a senator, her last name remains what it is. Her victory would translate to 14 straight years of either a Bush or a Clinton residing in the White House, Scfunuhl noted. 
'Rock-star magnetism' 
A breath of fresh air may come in the form of Barack Obama, the junior senator from Illinois who leapt into the spot­light following his 2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention. 
In a piece he wrote for the Chicago Tribune comparing Obama to former President Ronald Reagan, Schmuhl couldn't help but mention the two politicians' "ready smiles, rhetorical eloquence and rock­star magnetism." Charisma not only attracts voters to a candi­date, but makes them more likely to listen to what he is say­ing, Schmuhl said. 

But the Times, Wolbrecht and political science professor Alvin Tillery all think strains of racism pervade in America. 
"I am of the view that race is still too great a barrier for most black politicians to overcome in even statewide elections, let alone the presidency," Tillery said, noting that Obama is the third black senator in history. 
"I also think," Tillery said, "that Obama will have a partic­ularly hard time because he is a black candidate running from the political Left. I think that white voters may be more like­ly to vote for black candidates that they deem to be 'conserva­tive.'" 
Complicating matters is Obama's resume, worryingly short for a presidential candi­date. Yet one major item it lacks -a vote in the Iraq war -could benefit him tremen­dously: he's not "tainted" by that record, Tillery said. Plus, senior Matt Ploszek believes Obama's instincts in foreign affairs are dead-on, despite his lack of experience. 

Ploszek, who interned with Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) this summer, cited a speech Obama gave in October of 2002 as "a really prescient critique" of what has gone on in Iraq. 
"I know that even a success­ful war against Iraq will require a U.S. occupation of undetermined length, at under­mined cost, with undetermined consequence," Obama told the crowd. 
Should Obama indeed announce his intention to run for president on Feb. 10, Ploszek hopes to become involved in his campaign in some capacity. 
"Looking at his 2004 Democratic Convention speech, he came out and he said, there's no reason we need to buy into this idea that America is divided along political lines, along cultural lines, along lines of education ... that's the type of thing that's been used to get people elected," Ploszek said. 
"[But Obama has] a n~w. unconventional approach to politics," he said. " ... Given this environment of pretty harsh partisanship that we've seen over the last several years, I think [Obama] would be a good antidote for that."

Pope calls for Christian unity talks 
VATICAN CITY -Pope Benedict XVI on Thursday called for honest dialogue among Christians as he expressed sadness over ten­sions between churches following centuries of divisions. 
Benedict presided at a prayer service in St. Paul Outside the Walls Basilica in Rome to mark the erid of a week of prayer dedicated in churches around the world to efforts aimed at uniting Christians. 
"Honest and loyal dialogue constitutes the typical and indispensable instrument in the search for unity," Benedict said. . 
Christians were praying "so that all the dis­ciples of Christ be one, and so ... they can give harmonious testimony to the men and women of our times," said Benedict, who is devoting much of his papacy to achieving Christian unity. 
In his homily, Benedict said through such encounters as Thursday's service it has been possible to perceive the joy of brotherhood, together with sadness for the tensions that remain. 
Sunni lawmaker accuses Iraqi PM 
BAGHDAD, Iraq -A Sunni lawmaker accused the Shiite prime minister of persecut­ing his sect and said his government's efforts at national reconciliation .were nothing more than a sham. The premier accused the Sunni of supporting the kidnapping of Shiites and refused to shake his hand. 
This televised display from the floor of the Iraqi parliament on Thursday mirrored the sectarian divide on the streets of Baghdad, where a suicide car bombing killed at least 26 people in the Shiite neighborhood of Karradah and two rockets slammed into the heavy forti­fied Green Zone not far from the U.S. Embassy.

SAN FRANCISCO -A fingerprint on a ciga­rette lighter, shotgun shells and an informant helped lead to the arrests this week of eight men accused of killing a police officer in the 1970s, according to court papers released Thursday. 
Some of the evidence was recovered using forensic techniques that didn't exist 30 years ago, according to the document, which was used to obtain an arrest warrant in the case. 
Prosecutors say members of the Black Liberation Army, a violent offshoot of the Black Panthers, stormed the lobby of a San Francisco police station the night of Aug. 29, 1971, killing Sgt. John V. Young with a shot­gun and injuring a civilian clerk with gun­fire.

Some eight hours and a deadly melee later, Beirut was under curfew for the first time in a decade. 
The violence Thursday underlined what Lebanese have feared for months: that the confrontation between Hezbollah and Sunni backers of the U.S.­supported government could rage out of control. 
At least three people were killed and 169 were injured before army troops backed by tanks and firing bar­rages of warning shots into the air dispersed most riot­ers. 
But the fallout reached far beyond the casualty count. The clashes rein­forced fears that Lebanon's sectarian divisions are erupting into violence as they did during the 197 5­1990 civil war.

age alcohol consumption, but that's not how they're treating it. . . . Because not very many peo­ple smoke pot here, it becomes a bigger deal." 
The University's drug policy divided students like Watson, who see problems with how Notre Dame weighs marijuana and alcohol offenses, and other students, who say there are defi­nite distinctions to be made. 
"The University policy is fair because marijuana is illegal," freshman Erin Jelm said. 
Freshman Isaac Song also said marijuana use should be pun­ished severely because of its ille­gality. 
"Who cares when this hap­pened or where it happened, because marijuana's illegal," he said. 
Others, like freshman Gina Camarata, said they were unaware of the specifics of the University's drug policy -a reaction that may support Watson's statement about rela­tively low levels of marijuana use at Notre Dame. 
"I've never looked up how much trouble I can get in for something I wouldn't do," she said. 
In a climate in which universi­ties across the country have been accused of giving their stu­dent-athletes special treatment in incidents similar to the one involving McAlarney, most stu­dents interviewed believe the point guard was treated the same as any student would have been. 
Lennon

"There's no one who better reflects what Notre Dame is about," said Executive Assistant to the President Frances Shavers, who spoke at the dinner. "Its values, its spir­it, the desire to embrace everyone -he genuinely loves the students and the University." 
Of the 150 people in atten­dance, there were 12 former presidents of the Alumni Board of Directors, the current board members, their families, and University officials, among them University President Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh. 
Vice President for University Relations Lou Nanni announced the creation of the Charles and Joan Lennon Endowment for Excellence ­a fund with $275,000 con­tributed by Lennon's Alumni Board colleagues to better allow the Alumni Association to provide services to its mem­bers. 
When Lennon addressed the crowd, he told attendees they "weren't here to honor Chuck Lennon," but to honor "you who have given me this oppor­tunity to take what God has given me to a new level." 
The dinner also honored Lennon with a tribute video and a tribute book, containing letters written by past and present Notre Dame and U.S. government officials as well as friends and family, lauding Lennon's love of Notre Dame and dedication to the University. 
The video highlighted Lennon's history with the University and contained com­ments from faculty and 

Freshman Mike Sayles, who 
-said he knew students involved in a similar situation last semes­ter, believed the punishment was at least on par with expec­tations. "There should be a consistent punishment for anyone caught with marijuana, and that's what this is. If you suspend non-ath­letes for a semester and don't suspend McAlarney, that would be inconsistent," he said. Regardless of their stance on the University's decision, stu­dents said they were disappoint­ed. ''I'm disappointed in the school. Getting caught with a half of a joint shouldn't get you suspended for two semesters," junior Jake O'Neil said. Jelm said she was "disappoint­ed in the whole situation, real­1y." "It mars the reputation of the basketball team and of the University," she said. "Kids look up to these athletes and then they find out stuff like this and it's just sad." ­For Schroeder, the decision is something to think about the rest of the season. "It's just sad that this is going to take away from the team's success," she said. McAlarney may not have received special treatment in his punishment, sophomore Colin Fath said, but the guard has received special treatment dur­ing his tenure at the University and took it for granted. "They set everything up to his advantage and he did something stupid and blew it," Fath said.

Hesburgh, who called him "a great Notre Dame man." 
Lennon received a letter from President George W. Bush, which congratulated Lennon on his 25 years of service to Notre Dame, and said that his efforts to better the University and the commu­nity "reflect the character of America." ­
Lennon thanked all "people who care to live their lives as men and women of Notr'e _Dame -graduates, spouses, students, and subway alumni." 
Lennon also paused to thank Hesburgh, who hired him 25 years ago. 
"Thank you, Father Ted, for your belief in me," he said. 
After Hesburgh delivered a final prayer, the Glee Club sang Notre Dame Our Mother and the Victory March, while a teary"eyed Lennon joined them in song. 
Lennon also credited his wife, Joan, and his family with his success, as well as the stu­dent body. 
"You students are what make this place great," he said. 
Lennon graduated from Notre Dame in 1961, earning two monograms in baseball and serving as president of his class. He also completed a Master's degree in guidance and counseling at Notre Dame in 1962, and served as assis­tant basketball and baseball coach until1967. 
Lennon worked in several community agencies in South Bend until Hesburgh offered him the position of executive director of the Alumni Association in 1981, and University President Emeritus Father Edward Malloy named him assoc'iate vice president of University Relations in 1999.

IN BRIEF 
California bans harmful chemical 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. -California regula­tors on Thursday enacted the nation's first statewide ban on the most common chemi­cal used by dry cleaners, pleasing environ­mentalists but worrying some small busi­nesses. 
By 2023, no more dry-cleaning machines that use the toxic solvent perchloroethyl­ene, a potential carcinogen, will be permit­ted in the state. 
The regulation by the California Air Resources Board will phase out the fluid next year, banning dry cleaners from buy­ing machines that rely on the solvent. The state's 3,400 dry cleaners who now use it must get rid of machines that are 15 years or older by July 2010. 
"Dry cleaners have known this is a prob­lem for quite some time," board member Dorene D"Adamo said. "There is a cost to society, and believe me taxpayers are pay­ing for it." 
The rule was approved unanimously by the seven-member board and was embraced by environmental and health advocates. They urged the board to accel­erate the ban because of the chemical's health effects. The solvent has contaminat­ed one in 10 wells in California. 
ConAgra closes plants, cuts 200 jobs 
OMAHA, Neb. -Packaged-food maker ConAgra Foods Inc. announced plans Thursday to close two manufacturing plants and expand another while cutting about 200 jobs. 
The changes are part of a reorganization plan the Omaha-based company announced in March last year. ConAgra said it would close 10-12 plants as part of an effort to streamline opera­tions, cut operating costs and raise gross mar­gins. 
On Thursday, acompany spokeswoman said ConAgra would start closing its microwave pop­corn plant in Edina, Minn., by late April and transfer production to plants in Rensselaer, Ind., and Irapuato, Mexico. 
The ConAgra Foods South popcorn-ball plant in St. Paul, Minn., will be closed and its produc­tion moved to the ConAgra plant in Lakeville, Minn.

Ford: 2006 loss largest in history 
North American sales decreases, extra costs lead to $12.7 billion decline 
Associated Press 

DEARBORN, Mich. ­With big red numbers on its balance sheet that amount to $1,925 for every car and truck it sold last year, one has to wonder if Ford Motor Co. has the money to keep the doors open long enough for its restructuring plan to take hold. 
On Thursday, the 103­year-old industrial icon reported a staggering $12.7 billion loss for 2006, and it warned that losses would continue this year and next. The loss was the largest in Ford history, driven by slumping North American sales and $9.9 billion in spe­cial items, including restructuring costs tied to the planned closure of 16 plants.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Keenan Revue m.ust take care 
Last week, two friends told me that they were recent­ly raped. The previous spring, I listened to similar sto­ries from two other dear friends. The experienee of hearing these four devastating stories is impossible to deseribe. I felt helpless and sick. 
The psyehology of rape is subtle and devastating. The mental and spiritual ehaos that my friends poured out to me that sprung from their victimization is staggering. Chaos is the right word. But perhaps, the most impor­tant bit of this to foeus on is that, eaeh time, the man did not conceive this forced sex as violenee. Three of the four rapes were subtle; the women were disoriented in the moment of the rape, enough for the men to brush off their "no's" as just being coy. The violenee of this subtle rape is no less real. 
I planned on going to the Keenan Hevue this year. I lived in Keenan for four years and know of the cama­raderie and fun that can come of Revue week. But with the pain of these women's stories and the memory of the jokes I saw and laughed at in past Hevues, this year, I cannot go. 
I do not fear feeling bad or offended. My uneasiness stems from questions about the kind of culture that the show creates and expresses. Even if there are no jokes about rape, this does not mean the material does not toueh issues of sexual violence. The cultural formation of someone who would take advantage of a woman is complex. I consider this eultural formation to be tied to women's self-image issues (espeeially eating disorders), irrational homophobia, objeetifieation of women, domestic abuse, insane drinking. In the past, the show laughs at all of these more subtle issues. I havP, a hunch that the roots of this are deeper than I know, much deeper than a two-hour show. 
I hear that this year's staff has taken special care to dean up the show, and for this efl'ort they should be thanked and commended. But still I fear that we do not ask deep enough questions about a culture that is slow to eonfront sexual violence.

With Notre Dame being a Catholic institution of intellectual exchange, I would like to take this opportunity to partake in the ongoing dialogue regarding the use of contraeeptives and condoms. Many of those who have contributed disagree with Eleanore Strong ("Contraeeptive soeiety morally harmful," Letter to the Editor, Jan. 22). Although I missed read­ing the letter, after reading the disagreeing responses I feel the need to address some of the assertions put forth by others. 
Let me start by attending to the definition and purpose of sex, as set forth in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Sex is to be the selfless act of love that conswnmates the loving relationship between a man and a woman, and is best appropriate in the context of marriage. In this sense, sex is said to be unitive,that is, uniting the two persons in a physi­eal aet of love. The seeond purpose of sex is procreative, an openness to possibility of the creation of a new life. Contraceptives and condoms prohibit these purposes of sex beeause, in using contraceptive or 'pro­tective' measures, not only are the persons obliterating the procreative purpose, but they are also preventing sex from being a selfless, unifYing acf 
One might ask: How is this possible, contraceptives and condoms allow people to engage is sex without the "fear of death, disease or an unwanted pregnaney?"(Letter to the Editor, "Condoms are not the cause," Jan. 23). Such a question exhibits a misunderstanding of and laek ofrespeet for the sexual act. Sex, when practieed under the eir­cwnstanees for whieh it was intended, is meant to be a complete and selfless gift of onesell'to one's partner. This entails an uneonditional sur­render of any personal reservations (such as fear) of eaeh and an acceptance of the vulnerabilities of the love that sex professes. 
Contraeeptives, condoms and the like allow people an avenue to aceess sex in a more selfish context by allowing partners (long-and short-term) to experience the physical pleasures of sex without neces­sarily being concerned with the other person. This is where we get the term "contraceptive mentality," which refers to the devaluing of sex to the extent that it is seen in a casual and even commereiallight. Although called the "eontraeeptive" mentality, this concept refers to the general deprecating attitude toward the true purposes of s_ex, whether or not aetual eontraeeptive measures are used. While many faetors have contributed to this present mentality, it can be reasonably stated that the advent of eontraception was a big push down the slippery slope on which we now frnd ourselves.

The eccentricity of the saints 
In the Martins' parking lot the other day, I passed a poorly but enthusiastically maintained Mazda whose rear-end was overloaded with absurd bumper stickers, most of them along the lines of this: "Conscientious Non-Jam Conformist." Th_e Matt~:w cheap shot one ts. Wilson tempted to make ts 
that no person answer-The Treasonous ing to that description Clerk could possibly have found so many bumper stickers to "express" his heart-felt opin­ions. It is a cheap.shot, because most of us cannot make anything on our own -not even descriptions of ourselves -but must buy or steal everything. 
Sometimes the cheap shot is correct, however, as it is in this case. When the mass of men and women subscribe to barbaric opinions or listen to savage, banal and unsublimated music, they gen­erally do so for some arguably good rea­son that has nothing to do with their iden­tity as "consumers" or "individuals," as "conformists" or otherwise. The owner of this ideologically-loaded jalopy, on the other hand, could have put up that mass­produced, block-lettered, sticky declara­tion of individuality only for one end -a purpose it singularly could not achieve. 
In one respect, I cannot help sympathiz­ing with its trite, failed message. Reading the major intellectuals of the nineteenth century and after, from Alexis de Tocqueville to G.K. Chesterton and W.H. Auden, one encounters the constant fear­ful apprehension that men are all growing alike. The person under the reign of mod­ern society had become a black-coated, straight-faced bore, and had so become because of the pressures of modern industry, the workplace and especially through the offices of that "hygienic" arm of the modern state, mass education. 
Auden, a product of the elite schools of England, argued strongly that parents should be left as much control of their children's educatidn as possible, and that children should be let to run around with as many neuroses as they could without seriously hurting themselves. If conformi­ty cast an increasing pall on former times, and if the commodification and "sanitiza­tion" of persons has continued unabated, what basis have we to believe the situa­tion has gotten better rather than worse? 
None. In ages past, occasional eccentrics sprung up in the hamlets of England or in the Villages of the Italian peninsula, and their exceptional attributes were but some of the signs by which they called one to greater devotion to God. They sealed themselves up in side-cham­bers of churches, fasted and prayed; they sat on pillars, moaned and prayed; or they flagellated themselves at the edges of town; or they performed works of mercy among the poor, sick and outcast. They shouted with joy the beauty of cats and the sublimity of shook foil. They were called saints, and it was on account of their unusual behavior that the great masses of people flocked in fascination to bathe within the light of their eccentric haloes. 
The death of saints, I think we can say, was always the plot of some jealous few. In other words, the notion of popular saints -of persons being declared "saints" by popular demand -suggests the way in which most people once wel­comed those different from themselves, so long as that difference was a signifier for a higher mode of life. Difference, when it reflected elevation, was a privilege not a derangement. And the makers of martyrs were those who did not so much perse­cute the difference in the saint, but rather, sought to exterminate the deep but exposed humanity in him: that self-reveal­ing quality whereby the saint threatened to bring to light the frailty and thirst for mercy and justice in every run-of-the-mill person. The sorrow of martyrdom comes in part from our basest common charac­ter falling under the control of this jealous few, betraying and spurning that noble common need. 
We, at present and as a rule, can no longer understand sainthood. When someone proposes the virtue of a celibate life, we look on in confusion and con­tempt. We whisper in corridors and rear back our heads like furious pack horses. When someone proposes the good of the life of contemplation, we sneer at her use­lessness. "She'll learn when she's starv­ing," we say, though we have managed to avoid ever seeing anyone starve. We pre­sume the celibate must suffer some secret sexual disorder -or what used to be called a "disorder" before it became just another consumer choice. And we simply accuse the contemplative of being "impractical" or "unrealistic," although no one I have heard use those terms has ever bothered to think what they might mean. 

This transformation from past to pres­ent is especially glaring at a Catholic uni­versity, where light of the saints in stained glass falls upon us all the time as we cross campus on our way to a marketing or economics lecture, where we learn the only truth worth countenancing is that of "supply and demand." Or coming home from yet another "mock interview," as we train to describe ourselves the way that will least expose our self and play up those fungible attributes that show we have the promise of being docile good wor:kers. 
St. Francis wore a tonsure; other saints wore hair-shirts. Chesterton wore a cape and saber. I do not write to recommend this. But rather than celebrating the "diversity" of what we listen to, wear, or copulate with, all the while we continue living lives thoughtless, identical and effi­cient, we might do better to seek after those higher goods that inevitably make the human wheel spin a little wobbly.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
For University policy, approval and doubts 
Enforcing standards important 
Whether all the members of the Notre Dame community want to accept it or not, the standard at Notre Dame is zero tolerance with respect to possession or use of drugs including marijuana. This is basis for the statements in du Lac con­cerning "shall be subject to discipli­nary suspension ...". 
In the case of Kyle McAlarney, he chose to separate himself from the Notre Dame community by his actions on Dec. 29. He may not have realized it, but that is what he did. Sometimes these cases do not rise to the level of a disciplinary hearing. For example, dorm rectors I am sure may choose to exercise some discretion in dealing with discipli­nary matters "internally" at the dorm level. 
Unfortunately in Kyle's case, there was no opportunity for an interme­diary to take action, and the matter had to go to the disciplinary hearing stage. The decision by the discipli­nary board simply confirms Kyle's own decision. As an alum, I am proud that Notre Dame has chosen to take action consistent with its published standards. 
Jack Fremeau alumnus Class of 1971 Jan. 25 
Consistency needed 
Many of the people in the Notre Dame community are deeply dis­turbed by the University's decision to suspend Kyle McAlarney from school. This is the first time in my 25 years that even the most devout Notre Dame supporters are truly distressed. My father has almost come to tears over this matter despite having no affiliation with the McAlarney's. 
Friends I haven't spoken to in months have communicated with me in the last few days to express their concerns. Premarital sex, according to du Lac, is subject to the same pun­ishment as possession (and a joint is hardly possession in the grand scheme of things). But, no one in their right mind would ever suspend an individual for one sexual encounter with a significant other. That is because we do not live by the letter of the law ... judicial bodies are given discretion because laws are not absolute. 
Kyle should be punished and what he did was terrible. However, the appropriate disciplinary action was not taken. The message that is received is one of arrogance, not suit­ability. Furthermore, I find a lack of consistency when examining past University rulings. Whether it be drunk driving or physical acts of vio­lence, punishments less severe seemed to be a common recourse. 
Kyle seems like a Notre Dame kid. It was his dream school. He was a good kid that made a bad mistake. Where was the Notre Dame community when he needed it most? I sincerely hope that the University learns from their mistake. We know Kyle has. 
Paul Benedict alumnus Class of2003 Jan. 25 
Policy not in community interest 
While I don't know the details of Kyle McAlarney's situation, through my experience with the Judicial Council (a resource I highly recommended to any student in trouble) I do have experience assisting students who have been in situations very similar to his. Based on these experiences, I have two observations. 
1. The University is consistent in its applica­tion of the rules. Any other student caught with marijuana would have been suspended as well. du Lac is unequivocal as to what the pun­ishment should be, and in my experience the University is consistent in administering it. 
2.1t is difficult to balance the needs of the individual with the needs of the community­a concept addressed thoroughly on pages 90­91 of du Lac. However, I feel the University's policy of mandating suspension for students who possess marijuana (p. 189) does not ade­quately balance these needs when applied to those have never been in trouble before and only possessed a small amount. 
The students I assisted were in this exact sit­uation, and I doubt anyone would consider them threats to the community. They weren't possessing large amounts of marijuana and selling it, which definitely calls for severe pun­ishment. They weren't using so-called "hard drugs." They weren't even using drugs and then getting in fights, disrupting the dorm, or vandalizing campus (as sometimes happens with drinking alcohol). While there is no excuse for such illegal activity, it hardly seems to warrant the punishment given out. 
Consider especially that driving while intoxi­cated, an activity which is also illegal but arguably far more dangerous than possessing small amounts of marijuana, carries a mini­mum punishment of probation, not suspension, according to duLac. "The punishment doesn't fit the crime" arguments aside, at the heart of this matter is how the community treats its members who have behaved in a manner inconsistent with its values. Though the theory behind du Lac's policies emphasizes the impor­tance of positive individual growth as well as the need to foster a good community, the poli­cies themselves fall short of these goals. I would think all members of the community would support a policy in favor of helping and educating those who are troubled but do not pose a threat to the community's safety as opposed a policy which removes them from the very community that can help them the most. 

I assisted several students who told me they were moving from a very supportive environ­ment at Notre Dame to a far less supportive environment at home because of their suspen­sion. Is this what we really want for our stu­dents? If Notre Dame truly wants to live up to its reputation of being a family-a reputation repeatedly emphasized on campus from orien­tation to graduation and on television commer­cials throughout the country -then it should treat its members as family. 
If Notre Dame truly wants to live up to the Catholic traditions of justice, forgiveness and helping others, then in addition to punishing students it should support these students with its various resources, such as its counseling services. It should especially do so for those students who have done nothing to affect the community other than possess small amounts of marijuana. I can't help but think the needs of these individuals and the community would be better met by placing the students on pro­bation and mandating participation in a drug program -thereby allowing them to receive the benefits and resources of Notre Dame, just as those with alcohol problems do. I hope the University will take time to reflect on its policy, and I hope student government and the Campus Life Council will engage in a conversa­tion aimed at striking a better balance between the needs of the community's individ­ual members and the needs of the community as a whole-a balance that will help our indi­viduals and the community grow together in a positive manner.

Acadetny A-wards race proves tight from start to finish 

Classic American tale spun with a French twist 
"An American in Paris," directed by Vincente Minnelli and staring Gene Kelly, is an intense story of love set in the romantic city of Paris, France. 
By ERIN McGINN Assisranr Scene Editor 
A bohemian painter falls in love with the fiancee of another man, leading to an incredible song-and-dance routine. "An American in Paris" stars Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron in a sumptuous rendering of one of the world's most beautiful cities. 
The plot is little less than dazzling. Kelly stars as the inspiration-starved painter Jerry Mulligan, who meets the gloriously rich Milo Roberts (Nina Foch) as he sets up his work for curb­side exhibition. She chooses Kelly to be her latest boy toy. Milo does her best to convince him she loves him as an artist, but even to the somewhat naive Mulligan, the transparency is evident. Still, he likes being recog­nized as a painter and permits himself to be swept off his feet despite his ini­tial objections. 
Roberts' amorous plans are over­turned upon the arrival of the beauti­ful dancer Lise Bouvier (Caron). She also pursues a relationship with Mulligan and they begin a romantic love affair that is inconvenienced only by their secret relationship. Bouvier is promised to Henri Baurel (Georges

Guetary), a friend of Adam Cook (Oscar Levant) who rooms in the same hostel and is friends with Mulligan. The rivalry between Baurel and Mulligan remains veiled for a large part of the film. Baurel even tries to convince Mulligan that he can capture the woman's heart. Cook catches on early but refrains from interfering, though it obviously pains him to do so. 
As musicals of the era often did, director Vincente Minnelli spends long, laborious takes filming the danc­ing and singing of its stars. People expected to see Kelly dance and they got their wish in abundance. At least half of the film is spent with Kelly dancing to a musical number. 
The difference between this and other similar productions is that the plot is at least admirably interesting, thanks in part to the terrific perform­ances of Caron, Foch and especially Kelly. 
The biggest spectacle in the film is probably the most worthwhile. Despite running for a lengthy 20 minutes, Kelly dances through a dreamlike reality of Paris rendered beautifully by art directors Preston Ames and Cedric Gibbons. Using famed artist renderings of Parisian locations (such as those by Manet), Ames and Gibbons 
George C. Scott once refused an Oscar, calling the Academy Awards "a rat race." If so, it's the most prestigious, exciting and controversial rat race in the world. The nominations were released on Tuesday, prompting the usual award season contro­
versy and hype. This year's Oscar race is being touted for its unpredictable nature -a true front-runner hasn't emerged, and the top-nominated film ("Dreamgirls," with eight) is not even up for Best Picture. 

As with any race 
dependent on voters, Brian Doxtader early buzz is good, but late momentum is bet­ter. "Babel," which won the Golden Globe for Scene Editor Best Picture (Drama), seems to be the early favorite, but it's not yet clear whether the thematic comparisons to 
previous high-profile pictures like "Crash" (last year's winner) and "Traffic" will help or hinder the socially conscious film. The momentum gained from the Golden Globe will no doubt be a benefit, especially since the Best Picture (Comedy or Musical) Golden Globe winner, "Dreamgirls," was not nomi­nated for the Oscar. 
The good word-of-mouth surrounding "Letters to Iwo Jima" may lead to an upset come Oscar time, especially since it wouldn't be the first time that a Clint Eastwood­directed film made a late push to win the award. His last picture, "Million Dollar 

Baby," beat the Miramax behemoth 'The Aviator" for the top prizes (Best Pieture and 
Best Director for Eastwood) in 2004. 
Speaking of "The Aviator," the biggest question i<> whether or not this is the year that Martin Scorsese gets it done. "The Departed" is one of those lilms that didn't seem hyped for Oscar prestige, but has picked up steam for one key reason: it's really good. 
The film is far more deserving than Scorsese's other high-prestige pictures of recent years ("The Aviator" and "Gangs of New York"), it might gamer the venerated filmmaker the Best Director statuette that has eluded him -unless he loses to Eastwood again. "The Departed" is also probably the best ftlm in the race, but its vio­lent cynicism might be problematic with some voters, especially since it lacks the social consciousness or historical rooting of films like "The Queen" or "Babel." 
"Little Miss Sunshine" is thi<> year's dark horse. Every year, there's an "odd man out," a film whose nomination is a little pu7.zling -"Seabiscuit" in 2003 or "Finding Neverland" in 2004. The buzz surrounding "little Miss Sunshine" i<> growing, however, thanks to several hundred thousand DVDs that have been sent to Academy voters. 
Some surprise acting nominations indude Ryan Gosling in the little-seen "Half Nelson," Mark Wahlberg for "The Departed" and Abigail Breslin in "little Miss Sunshine." There are a pair of sure bets this year in the Best Actor and Best Actress awards, which already have Forest Whitaker ("Last King of Scotland") and Helen Mirren's ("The Queen) names inscribed on them. 
A<> with other years, the 2006 omissions are just as notable as the nominations. Among the films that failed to gamer Best Picture noms are Alfonso Cuaron's "Children of Men," Guillermo DelToro's "Pan's Labyrinth," Paul Greengrass' "United 93" and the aforementioned "Dreamgirls." Both "Children of Men" and "Dreamgirls" were expected to be front-runners in the race, and their complete elimination is puzzling, especially in the face of nominated films like "Little Miss Sunshine" and "The Queen." Neither of the two major 9/11 films ("United 93" and Oliver Stone's "World Trade Center") received Best Picture nominations, though their early releases may have hin­dered their chances. "The Departed" i<> under-represented in the acting department, as Jack Nicholson failed to gamer a nomina­tion, and DiCaprio got the nod for "Blood Diamond" instead. 
The award ceremony is still over a month away, but the build-up is already beginning. "The Departed" is being re-released and several high-profile films are finally reaching wide-release. The momentum and vibes over the next several weeks will determine who walks away with statuettes and who won't. Let the race begin.

"An American in Paris" is the weaker of the two, it still stands as a remark­able musical from an era that pro­duced some of the world's most fondly remembered films. 
"An American in Paris" received an impressive six Academy Awards, com­peting directly with two other popular films of the time ("A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun"). There were no acting nominations, but the film swept up technical prizes 
left and right, as well as being the surprise winner for the Best Picture award. 
"An American in Paris" is a triumph of filmmaking. It is entertaining as well as cinematically remarkable, with its dream-sequence closing ballet acting as a showcase for what the movie-musical is able to achieve.

"Taking Back Sunday," the Amityville, N.Y. based emo-punk band, recently released "Louder Now" -the group's first album under the Warner Bros. label. 
By MARTY SCHRODER Assistant Scene Editor 

Taking Back Sunday's formula on their third album "Louder Now" does not seem to have strayed much from the emo-pop­rock recipe that the band is so very good at. While still a solid album that many teenage girls and boys will be listening to and lamenting their loss of love and romance, it fails to do much in the way of new material that the truly creative bands are capable of. 
This band used to be spot on. With its 2002 release of "Tell All Your Friends," Taking Back Sunday was on the forefront of the emo-rock that was just hitting the scene. Although bands had sung about girls before and Chris Carrabba's one man Dashboard Confessional had been pouring his heart out to ready teenagers for a cou­ple of years, 'Tell All Your Friends" was emo with an edge. When Taking Back Sunday front man Adam Lazzara plead­ingly moans "And if you slit my throat I with my one last gasping breath I I'd apol­ogize for bleeding on your shirt," one knows it's teenage emo off its hinges but there was something real in that first album. "Louder Now" is still good music and the lyrics are more intelligent than your average emo-rock fare four years down the line, but this album is still doing the same old thing and suffers for it. 
"Louder Now" opens with a frenzy in the form of "What's it Feel Like to be a Ghost?" Bassist Matt Rubano sets the tone with a frantic bass line that clears the way for Lazzara's singing. Following this is "Uar (It Takes One to Know One)" which is just as edgy and emo-punk as. the previous track. The middle of the album shines with "Twenty-Twenty Surgery" and mourns with the string accented "My Blue Heaven." 
This album was the first for Taking Back Sunday to be released on the Warner Bros. label. They had previously been with emo­punk mainstay Victory records and here Warner displays the cleaner production it can offer. However, the band does not lose its rough edge. While the production is clean thanks to producer Eric Valentine, the music is classic emo-punk sound is not lost. While the album is not the most groundbreaking album ever to be released it is surely good enough to warrant a lis­ten. 
The biggest problem with the album is the cookie-cutter feel. Where "Tell All Your Friends" may have been overly melodra­matic, it was, at very least, fresh. However, "Louder Now" will keep the band's fans happy. They rock hard and sing about doomed relationships and, of course, the girl that got away. However, ifTaking Back Sunday wishes to be truly recognized as a band that is serious about music, they must begin to move in a new direction. The emo-punk will keep the kids happy but the critics will begin to tear them apart. While some might say Taking Back Sunday is doing the same thing that My Chemical Romance did to make it big, My Chemical Romance isn't changing its music; they are changing their image. Perhaps it's not necessary that Taking Back Sunday go out and buy black eyelin­er. It would, however, be nice to hear fresh music from this talented band. This music may sell some records, but it seems Taking Back Sunday is going to be long forgotten as one of the ubiquitous emo-punk bands that are dominating the airwaves.

Associated Press 

IRVING, Texas -The Dallas Cowboys added Jason Garrett to their coaching staff Thursday night, and said he would remain a candidate to replace retired head coach Bill Parcells. 
Garrett, the backup to Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman for two Super Bowl titles in Dallas from 1993-99, was quarterbacks coach in Miami the last two seasons -his only coach­ing experience. Garrett also had been. in line to become the Dolphins' offensive coordinator for new head coach Cam Cameron. 
The Cowboys said Garrett's responsibilities and title won't be deter­mined until the head coaching search is com­plete. The most likely sce­nario, however, is that Garrett will become the offensive coordinator if he's not the head coach. 
"The nature and timing of this hire is unique in that we were dealing with a lim­ited window of time in which to talk to Jason about returning to Dallas," Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said in a statement. 
The Dolphins gave Dallas permission to talk to the 40-year-old Garrett, but also told the former quar­terback that he had to decide by Thursday if he was going to sign a con­tract extension. That dead­line passed with Garrett still in Texas. 

"Jason is someone who is held in high regard as a bright offensive mind throughout the NFL," Jones said. "We are grateful to the Dolphins for granting the Cowboys permission to explore this opportunity. Jason will now proceed fur­ther in our head coaching search as an in-house can­didate." 
San Diego defensive coor­dinator Wade Phillips, the former head coach at Denver and Buffalo who also had interim stints in New Orleans and Atlanta, is scheduled to interview Friday about the head coaching vacancy. 
The Cowboys also plan to talk to San Francisco offen­sive coordinator Norv Turner, a former head coach for Washington and Oakland, and New Orleans defensive coordinator Gary Gibbs. Both are former Dallas assistants. It wasn't clear when those inter­views would take place, but Turner is coaching the Senior Bowl on Saturday. 
Parcells retired Monday after going 34-32 with two playoff losses in four sea­sons with the Cowboys, ending a 19-season career that included two Super Bowl titles with the New York Giants. 
IN BRIEF 

Blue Devils top Tigers with 
buzzer-beatinglayup 
DURHAM, N.C. -David McClure hit a layup as time expired Thursday night to lead No. 10 Duke to a 68-66 win over No. 19 Clemson. 
McClure's basket capped a wild final 13 seconds for the Blue Devils (17-3, 4-2 Atlantic Coast Conference), who blew a five-point lead before answering with the sophomore's stunning basket. 
With the score tied at 66 after Vernon Hamilton erased the deficit with a layup and a 3-pointer, Josh McRoberts inbounded the ball with 
4.4 seconds left to freshman Jon Scheyer. Scheyer pushed the ball near midcourt, then sent a pass ahead to McClure. 
McClure, who had a step on Hamilton, laid it up over the out­stretched arms of K.C. Rivers for the win as the horn sounded. 
Duke's players immediately spilled onto the floor in celebration and mobbed McClure. 
Federer slams Roddick in 
Australian Open 

MELBOURNE, Australia -If he could pick any player from any era to test himself against, Roger Federer would like a shot at Rod Laver or Bjorn Borg. 
Laver, the last man to win all four majors in one season, was at the stadium that carries his name Thursday to witness Federer dis­mantle Andy Roddick in the Australian Open semifinals. 
After what he saw, Laver would just as soon stick to meeting 
Federer in the locker room ­ after  
the matches.  
Federer likes to put on a  show  

when Laver is at Rod Laver Arena, and called his 6-4, 6-0, 6-2 victory over Roddick his best match in Melbourne. 
"I had one of these days when everything worked," the Swiss star said. "I was unbeatable. I was play­ing out of my mind. I am shocked myself." 
N.C. State coach returns 
after bout with cancer SAN DIEGO -Brandt Snedeker knew the score. He just couldn't believe where he was. 
The only time Snedeker had ever been 9-under through nine holes was sitting in front of a monitor playing a Tiger Woods video game. He knew that wasn't the case Thursday in the Buick Invitational because Woods was two groups ahead of him on the North Course at Torrey Pines and well behind him on the scoreboard. 
And when the 26-year-old rookie added yet another birdie, he even started taking away some of Woods' fans. 
"I don't know if they know who I am or what was going .on," Snedeker said. "But they were sure rooting me on like they were my best friend. It was great." 
So was his opening round of the year.

Belles enter hon1e n1eet with lovv expectations, high hopes 
By BILL BRINK 
Sports Writer 
It's not often a team heads into a competition expecting to lose, but .when Saint Mary's swims against Calvin tonight, the Belles will emphasize other aspects of the meet against the top-10 opponent. 
"Calvin is a national chal­lenger, and, well, Saint Mary's isn't quite there yet," freshman Jen Lebiedz said. 
But neither the coaches nor the swimmers are the least bit concerned about it. The Belles, who have two wins this season, shun the inevitability of the out­come and focus instead on their individual goals and achieve­ments. When a meet victory is most likely out of reach, a sea­son-best time or fine-tuning of technique become the new goal. 
"Most coaches have a pretty good idea of how meets will play out before they happen," Belles coach Ryan Dombkowski said. 
Dombkowski strives toward small personal improvements 

that will enhance future suc­cess. He tries to refine portions of the race, such as the start or turn, and also pushes the swim­mers toward new low times. 
Lebiedz sees the meet as a chance to measure her abilities before the MIAA championships in two weeks. 
"This meet is pretty impor­tant in regards to conference; it's really our jumping point," she said. "From here on out, it's all about conference, so a great meet against Calvin would help to put everyone in the right mindset." 
That mindset can make or break a swimmer -a swim race is a delicate balance of emotions that must be kept in check. Dombkowski related the idea of peak anxiety versus performance to a bell curve ­too little will make the swim­mer lackadaisical, too much will cause over-worrying and either way performance suf­fers. 
The Belles swim at 6 p.m. at Washington High School.

Belles look to shake the Thunder 
Team wants to pick up fourth win in five games against Tri-State 
By BILL BRINK 
Sports Writer 
The Belles had already turned their season around when they won three of four games between Dec. 6 and Jan. 2. Now they've turned it up a notch. 
Saint Mary's is 7-10 overall but 6-4 in the MIAA and tied for third in the league with Olivet. The Belles are on the heels of another 3-of-4 streak. Before the run started, the Belles came within a missed free throw of forcing overtime against national No. 12 Calvin on Jan. 6. And Saturday, they visit last-place Tri-State (4-14 overall, 2-8 in MIAA). 
Saint Mary's can take sole possession of third place in the MIAA with a win this weekend. If the Belles go on to beat Olivet next Wednesday, they could take a two-game lead for the third spot in the conference. 
Sophomore guard Katie Rashid said she understands the magnitude of the upcom­ing games. 
"It is very important to capi­talize on teams during the sec­ond round of conference play in order to secure one of the top four seeds," she said. 
The top four seeds receive home court advantage in the first round of the league play­offs. 
The Belles are averaging 
73.5 points per game over their last four games. Junior guard Alison Kessler has kept up her solid play, but she now has help. Other players, some­what quiet in the first half of the season, have stepped up. 
Freshmen center Anna Kammrath, in particular, has steadily improved all season. Over the past four games, she's averaged 11 rebounds per game. Sophomore forward Erin Newsom is shooting 51 percent from field goal range and has also been a presence on the glass. . 
Rebounding, a weakness of Saint Mary's during the earlier part of the season, has improved as well. Belles coach Jennifer Henley continues to stress that aspect of the game in practice. The Belles will try to capitalize on Tri-state's poor offensive rebounding. 
"We will attack the same way, trying to gain good posi­tion and secure every defen­sive rebound," Rashid said. 
In Saint Mary's 83-79 win 
over  Tri-State Jan.  2,  the  
Belles  out-rebounded  the  
Thunder 52-41.  

Tri-State has no player shooting over 40 percent from the field. They are led by freshmen guard Sarah Howe, who leads the team with 13.2 points and 7.1 boards per game. 
"It is important to play great help-side defense on Sarah Howe and be in position for the rebound," Rashid said." 
In the teams' previous meet­ing, Newsom had a double­double, dropping 20 points and grabbing 16 rebounds. Kessler scored 22 points, and senior guard Bridget Lipke had 19. 
Tri-State fell victim to Saint Mary's 24 second-chance points. The Thunder netted just 13 on second efforts. The Belles hope to have similar success Saturday. 
"We will attack the gaps and crash the boards," Rashid said.

Irish encounter squad w-ith a fatniliar face 
By CHRIS HINE 
Sports Writer 

No. 4 Notre Dame begins its dual match season in familiar company today as it squares off against Illinois in Champaign, Ill. 
The Fighting Illini are coached by 2001 Notre Dame graduate and former assistant coach Michelle Dasso. 
Dasso, who was the ITA (Intercollegiate Tennis Association) Senior of the Year in 2001, was a four-time All­American at Notre Dame and won the Francis Patrick O'Connor Award in 2001. The award is given to one male and one female student-athlete annually for "best exemplifying the spirit of Notre Dame." 
Dasso joined the Illini this season. 
"Obviously playing Notre Dame is very special for me," Dasso said. "I have so much respect for [Irish coach] Jay Louderback as a coach and person. He has been my men­tor after having played for him and coaching with him for so many years. . .. I look forward to seeing some competitive tennis with a ton of hustle this weekend." 
Last season, the Irish fmished 27-2, reaching the NCAA quarter­finals. The ITA named Louderback coach of the year and Dasso assistant coach of the year for their success with Notre Dame in 2005-06. 
"The players will be psyched for it; Michelle was such always such a tough player and she'll have them ready to play," Louderback 
Sunday, January 28. 2:30 p.m. 
said. "Our kids will be excited to because they always had a lost of respect for Michelle and what she's done." 
Notre Dame will have three freshmen -Colleen Rielley, Cosmina Ciobanu and Kali Krisik -making their dual match debuts. Rielley and Ciobanu faced each other in the ITA Midwest Regional Finals in October, with Rielley claiming the title 7-5, 6-4. This was the first time two fresh­man teammates faced each other in the singles final of that event. 
"For them it's a chance to break the ice and get their first match under their belt," Louderback said. 
The Irish also feature the ITA nationally ranked doubles teams of No. 5 junior Brook Buck and sophomore Kelcy Tefft and No. 11 seniors Catrina and Christian Thompson. Rielley and Catrina l;hompson are No. 31 and No. 41, respectively, in the singles' poll. 
After taking Qn Illinois, Notre Dame will come back to campus to host No. 12 Vanderbilt Sunday at noon at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. The Commodores are one of six teams the Irish will face this season that are in the top 20 of the current ITA poll. 
Louderback is confident that his group is ready for the challenging weekend. 
"Over Christmas they were on their own and they were good about hitting on their own," he said. "They all came back and looked good."

Bednarski said the Irish would use Saturday to rest after the long bus trip. The competition begins at 7:30 
a.m. Sunday. 
He said the fencers would meet with members of the Notre Dame Club of New York City, some of whom will be cheering on the Irish the next day at the Cole Sports Center in Manhattan. 
"I have really high expecta­tions," Irish assistant coach Gia Kviuatskhelia said. "Everybody's pumped up and ready to go." 
After the Notre Dame Duals, Kvaratskhelia said, the Irish had Monday off. Some fencers worked out individually, but the best team practices of the week were Tuesday and Wednesday, he said. 
Kvaratskhelia said the Irish hope to face Columbia and St. John's in a short time span Sunday to keep Notre Dame's adrenaline high with­out having a let-down between duals.

from start to finish," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said after the loss. 
The Huskies (17-2, 7-0 Big East), the current conference leaders, are coming off a 88­76 win over DePaul Wednesday. Sophomore guard Kalana Greene recorded her third double-double of the season as she dropped a career-high 25 points and grabbed 12 boards. Greene leads the Huskies with 13.4 points per game, and is sec­ond on the team with 7.3 rebounds a game. 
Greene, however, is only one of five Huskies to average in double figures, as each starter on the team averages at least 11.6 points per con­test. 
Despite Connecticut's potent offense, McGraw does not anticipate changing Notre Dame's game -plan. 
"We're not going to do any­thing different than we've been doing all year," she said. "We're just trying to continue the reigning Big East player of the week, scored 31 and 25 points last week in games against St. John's and Syracuse, respectively. Allen scored 17 points Tuesday at Marquette. 
Allen's recent offensive surge has not surprised her coach. 
"I thought she could get 18 to 20 points if she shot the ball enough," McGraw said. "I thought what she did last week [against St. John's and Syracuse] was a little over my expectations, but I think she's capable of doing that. She's like a completely different player now." 
For the Irish to have a chance to win, McGraw said, they must be a presence on the boards. The Golden Eagles pulled down six more rebounds than the Irish did Tuesday, snapping Notre Dame's three-game streak of positive rebound differentials. 
However, for the Irish to succeed, McGraw said, they must limit Connecticut's fast break points. 
"We gotta stop the transi­tion," she said. "We can do that by taking care of the ball and just being patient with the ball." 
Notre Dame has averaged just 11 turnovers in its past three games, a dramatic improvement over its 17.6 

mark for the season. 
The Irish are currently 2-2 against teams currently ranked in the top 25, boast­ing wins over No. 13 Purdue and No. 16 Bowling Green with losses to No. 4 Tennessee and No. 17 Marquette. The Huskies are currently 1-2 against ranked teams, with a win over Purdue and a pair of six­point losses to Top-5 teams in Tennessee and No. 2 North Carolina.

days of eligibility if he doesn't enroll somewhere this spring. 
· A student athlete generally needs to earn 24 credit hours in the past calendar year to remain eligible at all times, and only six credits can come during a sum­mer session, Karwoski said. 
Even if McAlarney took 15 credit hours this past fall, he would need to enroll at another school for the regular spring semester to meet the 18-hour minimum for the academic year before taking six credits at a school over the summer. 
Even if he plans to return to Notre Dame, McAlarney would still have to enroll at another school for the spring and possibly the summer 2007 semesters in order to obtain enough credits to be academically eligible to play basketball in the fall of 2007, Heisler said. 
"I believe you need 24 credits within the last year to be eligible on an ongoing basis," Heisler said. "For him to return, you'd have to take whatever credits in the fall semester and add them with X number of credits he would get elsewhere." 
Moreover, NCAA bylaw 

14.8.1.4 mandates "satisfactory completion of six semester or six quarter hours of academic credit the preceding regular academic term (e.g., fall semester, winter quarter) in which the student­athlete has been enrolled full­time at any collegiate institution," 
Wildcats 
continued from page 20 
Brey silid. "I don't know if there's anybody hotter. They put it on us last time." 
The Irish are also staring at a trip to Syracuse Tuesday. Because of the loss to the Red Storm and the tough game next week, Saturday's contest is crucial for Notre Dame's position in the Big East stand­ings, where the team is cur­rently sixth. Before the game against the Red Storm, Notre Dame was second in the Big East. 
"One minute we're second, next we're six, but at that the end, we might be first," senior guard Russell Carter said. 
For Carter, just the fact that the Wildcats beat the Irish two weeks ago is enough motiva­tion for Saturday. 
"They just beat us," he said. "A lot of things happened in that game that we wish we could have back. So now we need to get our redemption." 
That redemption will have to come without former starting point guard Kyle McAlarney, who was suspended from the University Monday stemming from his arrest on a marijuana possession charge Dec. 29. 
Freshman Tory Jackson, who was thrust into the role when McAlarney was first suspended from the team in December, said he does not feel any added pressure despite knowing he'll hold that position for the rest of the season. 
''I'm going to take it the same way that I have been," Jackson said. "Nothing's changed." 
Jackson will continue to con­sult the point guard, however. 
''I'm going to keep in touch with Kyle," Jackson said. "He taught me a lot and I want to keep getting advice from him." 
Brey said the fact that the 
meaning that McAlarney must complete at least six credit hours at another school this semester in order to remain eligible for next fall. 
In the event that McAlarney decides not to return to Notre Dame, he could begin playing for his new school as early as next January-provided he makes a decision fast. According to NCAA by-laws, a student-athlete can establish residency in an institu­tion by the 12th day of classes in a semester. If McAlarney trans­fers to another school within days and meets that require­ment, he could feasibly lose only less than 15 games of eligibility by transferring as opposed to staying at Notre Dame. 
According to NCAA bylaw 14.1.8.1.4, "A student-athlete who withdraws or is dismissed from an institution is considered to be a prospective student-ath­lete eligible for recruitment by other NCAA member institutions and may not continue to practice with the original institution's team." 
CBSportsline.com reported Wednesday that Michigan State, Virginia and Xavier were all interested in McAlarney as a transfer. McAlarney is not enrolled or under scholarship from Notre Dame, but Michigan State senior associate athletic director for external relations Mark Hollis said the Spartans are focused on their current season. 
"I just met with [Michigan State head] coach [Tom] Izzo and I'm not aware of anything [regarding McAlarney]," Hollis said. 
Xavier sports information 
Irish are in serious contention for an NCAA Tournament berth and still have a shot at the Big East championship should keep the team focused after a distracting week. 
"We have a pretty good resume," Brey said. "We've got a pretty good thing going and we hav~ to continue that." 
The Irish allowed 102 points to Villanova in their last matchup, including 27 by guard Scottie Reynolds and 21 by forward Curtis Sumpter. Brey said improved hustle and rebounding will keep the Wildcats' score down to a more manageable level. 
"Loose balls and second chance shots early put us in a big hole," Brey said. 
Villanova forward Dante Cunningham and guard Mike Nardi also hurt the Irish last time, scoring 19 and 18 points, respectively. 
"They've got a lot of bodies that come at you and they come at you with a bunch of quick, bouncy guys who can run the floor and get into the paint," Brey said. "We have to do a better job of protecting the paint." 
Brey said the Irish may change defenses frequently Saturday to confuse the Wildcats. 
Notre Dame is 4-0 in confer­ence home games this year, but has dropped all three of its games on the road. Carter attributed the road struggles to the team's youth. 
The Irish have three fresh­men who see significant play­ing time -Jackson, forward Luke Harangody and guard Jonathan Peoples. 
"Our guys are still learning the ropes of playing on the road in the Big East," Carter said. 
Fortunately for Notre Dame, it will have the home Joyce Center crowd behind it and ­for the first time since a win over Alabama Dec. 7 -Brey director Tom Eiser said he was not aware of any discussions about McAlarney, but he would­n't rule out the possibility because Musketeers head coach Sean Miller "won't comment on transfers." . 
"They usually don't tell me anything until after they've got a kid signed," Eiser said. 
At Virginia, assistant athletics media relations director Bill Hurd said he could not comment. 
After playing during his fresh­man season and the first 12 games of this one, McAlarney has used two years of eligibility at Notre Dame. Whether he comes back to Notre Dame or goes else­where, McAlarney will complete liis four years of NCAA eligibility in the spring of 2009, barring a future injury or other hardship. 
Karwoski said that if McAlarney takes classes at another university in the spring in the hopes of returning to Notre Dame, it would not be considered a transfer for the purpose of the NCAA eligibility rules because he would not be playing basketball. 
Furthermore, McAlarney would not need Notre Dame's permission to take such a step and would be able to re-apply for fall 2007 without NCAA compli­cations. 
"There is no permission required for a student to enroll in an institution," Karwoski said. "What triggers the [NCAA] trans­fer and the eligibility is a year in residence at the new institution."
