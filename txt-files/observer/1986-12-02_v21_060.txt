Low student interest cancels 


Sikh terrorists kill total of32 Hindus 
Reagan told by senators to get facts, take initiative 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON From 
friend and foe alike, President 
Reagan is getting the same ad­
vice: take the initiative and get 
all the facts out about the 
tangled dealings by members 
of his administration that sent 
arms to Iran and money to Con­
tras. 
"He needs to get on top of it," Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said on Sunday. "It's not going to go away." 
What steps Reagan takes could determine whether he comes out of this crisis able to govern effectively or whether the nation will watch another president struggling to survive a controversy he allowed to get out of control. 
Reagan was back at the White House after a Thanksgiv­ing holiday at his California ranch. He returned vowing to "do whatever we have to to get to the bottom of this." 
The Sunday interview shows on the television networks reflected the high degree of skepticism and concern among Republicans and Democrats about what has been disclosed so far. 
And while most members of Congress were reluctant to speculate on who might have known more than they now are admitting, two Republicans suggested that Vice President George Bush should have known. 
"I don't know," said Richard Lugar when asked if he thought Bush knew. "I presume he should have known," the Re­publican senator from Indiana added on "Meet the Press." Lugar is chairman of the Sen­ate Foreign Relations Commit­tee. 

spring semester in Jerusalem 
Associated Press 
By JOE MARKE Staff Reporter 

Lack of student interest is responsible for suspended operation of the 1987 Spring semester of Notre Dame's foreign study program in Jerusalem, according to Isabel Charles, director of foreign study programs. 
"Only three students signed up. We need at least ten or more students to par­ticipate in order to run the program," she said. 
Charles said the program will be reopened next Fall if the minimum enrollment of ten students can be met. 
Charles blames the low en­rollment on a variety of fac­tors. The main reason, she says, is that students aren't aware of the program, which began only last Fall. 
"I think what it takes with every program is students coming back to say what a good experience it was," said Charles. 
Another factor contribu­ting to the low enrollment may be fear of terrorism in the area, Charles said. "There may be some con­cerned with terrorism, al­though there has actually

Reagan reiterates he knew nothing of 
Contra connection 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Reagan ordered his National Security Council staff Monday not to conduct diplomatic, mil­itary or intelligence operations while a review board inves­tigates the agency's role in the secret sale of arms to Iran and 

:'CJ the diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels. 
";:; Asserting that "I want all the facts to come out," the presi­dent also said he would wel­come appointment of a special prosecutor if recommended by the Justice Department to in­vestigate possible wrongdoing. 
And he reiterated that he had known nothing about the secret transfer of up to $30 million to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras. In a statement to his press spokesman in response to questions from reporters, Reagan said: "You can tell them flat out that I had no knowledge whatsoever of it until (Attorney General) Ed Meese briefed me on it Monday afternoon" -Nov. 24. 
Gripped in the gravest crisis of his administration, Reagan met with a three-member review board headed by former Republican Sen. John Tower of Texas he charged with the task of investigating NSC staff operations. 
Meanwhile, the Senate Intel­ligence Committee went be­hind closed doors to begin its own investigation of the Iran­Contra affair.

NEW DELHI, India -Hindus rioted and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi pledged "tough and strong action" against Sikh terrorists Monday, the day after four gunmen pulled Hindus off a bus in Punjab and killed 24 of them. 
Police said Sikh militants killed eight more people in Pun­jab state Monday. 
Sikh extremists, who want in­dependence for Punjab, killed 14 Hindus in a similar bus hijacking July 25. 
Paramilitary troops were or­dered to patrol New Delhi during a general strike called for Tuesday by an opposition Hindu political party. Strikes also were scheduled in the Hindu-dominated states of Haryana and Kashmir next to Punjab, which has a Sikh majority. 
Shops were closed Monday by general strikes in towns and cities throughout Punjab. Clashes between Sikh and Hindu youths were reported in J allundhar, but police said no serious injuries resulted. 
About 3,000 Hindus rioted and threw stones on the edge of New Delhi. Police fired shots into the air and lobbed tear gas to scatter the crowds. 
Officers said they arrested 100 people for trying to block traffic on the main ring road around the capital. 
"There is a lot of tension in the city, but we are keeping a watch on things," said Police Commissioner Ved Marwah, who prohibited public gather­ings for four days. 
Near Parliament, police hauled away 300 supporters of the opposition Janata Party who held a non-violent protest in violation of the ban. They were released later. 
The lower house of Parlia­ment was adjourned briefly he-cause members shouted "We want action!" and demanded dismissal of Home Minister Buta Singh, the chief law en­forcement official. 
Gandhi appealed in Parlia­ment for all Indians to "be careful and hold tempers down." He said "a concrete plan" of strong action had been devised to combat Sikh ex­tremism, but did not elaborate. 
Larry Speakes said the admin­istration "has raised no objec­tion" to key figures in the case testifying before Congress. However, he said information that constitutes advice to the president "could come under the claim of executive privilege" and might be with­held. 
White House and congres­sional leaders debated a pro­posal from Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas for the president to call Congress back to town to form a Watergate-style investigative committee. 

Reagan said the idea was "under discussion and there's been no decision yet. But we want to work with the Congress." 
At the White House, Reagan gave marching orders to the review board composed of Tower, former Democratic senator and onetime Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, and Brent Scowcroft, who was na­tional security adviser in the Ford administration. 
Promising full cooperation irom the White House and all agencies of the executive branch, Reagan told the com­mission: 
"I want to assure you and the American people that I want all the facts to come out -about learning of a possible transfer of funds from the sale of arms to Iran, to those fighting the Sandinista government. . .. And we'll continue to share the actions we take and the infor­

mation  we  obtain  with  the  
American  people  and  the  
Congress."

Technicolor in old movies makes some people see red 
I can't understand why so many people are upset about this business of coloring black and white films. 
This new process will enable us to see classic oldies like "It's A Wonderful Life" in vibrant technicolor. It's a miracle of modern technolo­gy. 
I'm all for technology and progress. After all, technology and progress brought us color movies in the first place. Imagine the initial impression on the 1930's audience of "Gone With the Wind." Color movies became the rage, black and whites became a sad remnant of the distant past. 
Why watch Jimmy Stewart wander through drab, black and white Bedford Falls when you could see Atlanta collapse in a fury of red and orange flames? Why see Humphrey Bogart say "Here's lookin' at you, kid" in the gray, un­colored setting of Casablanca? 

Those who protest the idea of colorization should be thankful for its implementation. God willing, we'll get all those embarassing oldies switched over to glorious color before our grandchildren have the chance to laugh at the primitive form of black and white cinema. 
Recently I read that the same computer process involved in colorization can add much­needed features to those outdated actors of the archaic black and whites. 
Now computer wizardry can put facial hair here and remove a ba~d spot there. Santa might look interesting with a red toupee in "A Miracle on Thirty-Fourth Street." We could remove Clark Gable's mustache and give it to Gary Cooper. I always thought Claudette Colbert would look good with a beard. Why not? 
Why indeed? Now that we're coloring old films, why don't we change them completely? We could modernize the set of "High Noon" by stashing a few microchip skyscrapers behind the dusty Western buildings. We could let King Kong ravage Paris instead of New York by replacing the Empire State Building with the Eiffel Tower. I just can't comprehend why some people can't see the marvelous thing computer technology has brought us. 
I guess there's some flimsy sentimental rea­son. Something like the importance of preserv­ing the original whose greatness elevated the movie industry to the position it holds in popular culture. Or the thin rationale that black and white oldies are the sole representatives of the early era of American film. Such small benefits can be sacrificed in the face of inevitable prog­ress. 
I am not, however, unsympathethic to old­fashioned types who remain stubbornly devoted to black and white movies. I'm willing to sell an old machine I haven't needed ever since I became an avid proponent of the wonders of technology. 
This ancient device will enable misguided film sentamentalists to view their beloved oldies in their original, lifeless form. 
How someone could enjoy the boring, gray versions of the early classics is confusing to me. This machine will deprive its users of the new phantasmagoric wonder colorization makes possible. 
As it will defy the inevitability of technology, it will be laughed at as the only object that still makes the old movies look the way they were. As holiday movies are being changed over to color, I'm making my machine available for a low price during the Christmas season. 
Ever heard of a black and white television?

$1 investment could return $100 in ND's Mock Stock Market game 
By CAROLYN GILLESPIE Staff Reporter 
Invest $1 with the hopes of winning $100 in a low-risk, low­cost chance to learn about Wall Street investments. 
Play the Notre Dame Finance Club's Mock Stock Market, which began on No­vember 17 and will run until March 13. An executive com­mittee headed by senior finance majors Jim Vizzini and Erin Jilek is in charge of this year's game, which is open to all Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students and faculty. 
"The main objective of the game is to gain hands-on expe­rience and a knowledge of how the stock market works at no risk," said Vizzini. "It is a great opportunity to learn about various types of invest­ments, especially for those without any type of business background," he said. 
For a $1 entry fee, which will be collected at a later date, each entrant is given a Cash Management Account with $100,000. This money is auto­matically invested into a tax­able money market fund ear­ning a fixed yield of 8%. 
Stocks, bonds, mutual funds and options may be bought and sold during the market hours of 8:30 a.m to 4:30 p.m., with the purchase or sale price for any security trade being the last closing price reported by the Wall Street Journal for the previous day. 
Enrollment and trade forms are located on the second floor of Hayes-Healy in front of the Finance Office. Trade forms will be collected on a daily basis, and enrollment is allow­able any time during the game's running. A maximum of 250 portfolios may enter, with one portfolio per person or team.

"The difference between this year's game and those in the past is a software package that was donated by a well-known and well-respected brokerage firm," said Vizzini. "This software will be used on the IBM PC and takes into account commtsstons, taxes, accrued interest and dividends," he said. 
The information from the trade orders are input by the committee at the end of each week. 
According to Jilek, the Mock Stock Market "is more com­prehensive this yP-ar than in the past because it is running for a longer span of time. The idea is to hold various investments over a longer period of time rather than just practicing pure market speculation." 
academic quality of the courses and the excellent op­portunity for growth in their understanding of Middle East problems, according to Charles. 
"It is an ideal experience to go there," she said. 
While open to all undergradu­ates, the program has offered special appeal to students majoring in theology, govern­ment, history, and the classics, she said. 
Students interested in par­ticipating in the program during the 1987-88 acedemic year should inquire at the Foreign Study Program Office, 420 Administration Building.

North building air resupply wing for Nicaraguan rebels, officials say 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Senior Reagan administration offi­cials knew that a now-fired White House aide was building an American-manned air resupply wing this year for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, ac­cording to government sources. 

Lt. Col. Oliver North, dis­I missed last week for what the administration says was hisI role in diverting to the Coritras

as much as $30 million in Iranian arms sale proceeds, ar­ranged the purchase of a five­plane air force and delivery of military supplies to the Con­tras, said the sources, who in­~ 
sisted on anonymity. An administration official said an internal White House
t 
review of the Contra resupply operation has found that ther Iranian payments were used to pay for the air wing. 
North's role in both the Con­tra resupply operation and the Iranian arms deal raises ques­tions about what President Reagan and other top advisers knew about the Iran-Contra connection. 
U.S. government officials, familiar with the North opera­tion, said that although the Iranian-Contra link was a closely held secret inside the White House, North's manage­ment of the air operation was known to officials in the State Department, Pentagon, CIA and the National Security Council. 

"Everyone knew something was going on down there and that Ollie (North) was doing it," one official said. 
In explaining North's firing from the National Security Council staff last Tuesday, At­torney General Edwin Meese said only North "knew precise­ly" about the Iran-Contra con­nection and his boss, national security adviser John Poindex­ter, who resigned, "did know that something of this nature was occurring." 
But congressional inves­tigators have begun examining how an operation as large as the Contra air resupply mis­sion, based at El Salvador's Ilopango military airport in clear view of U.S. military ad­visers, could have been funded from Iranian arm sales without 
Workers continue to build concrete wall around Soweto 
Associated Press 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -A concrete wall is being built around parts of Soweto. The government said Sunday the barrier would not enclose the entire black township, but workers building the wall contradicted this. 
Construction began last week, but there was no official announcement. 
Andriana Andersen, a spokesman for the government Bureau for Information, said the wall was designed to block children and animals from run­ning onto a major highway which curves around an area of Soweto called Diepkloof. 
She said the wall would not enclose the entire township, which covers 38 square miles near Johannesburg and is home to about 1.7 million blacks. She said the wall so far extends several hundred yards and is about 7 feet high. 

The Sunday Star, an indepen­dent English-language newspa­per, quoted workmen at the site as saying they were told the wall was meant to enclose the entire township. 
Three black townships around the Indian Ocean city of Port Elizabeth have been fenced off by barbed wire for months, with access to the townships possible only through checkpoints manned by the security forces.

Reagan and other top officials knowing. 
When Congress, in October 1984, banned U.S. officials from "directly or indirectly" aiding the Contras militarily, North turned to outside inter­mediaries to handle many of the tasks for the supply opera­tion. They included retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, retired Army Maj. Gen. John Singlaub and conser­vative activist Robert Owen. 
The air resupply operation came to light Oct. 5 when an American-manned C-123K cargo plane was shot down over southern Nicaragua while flying guns to the Contras. Two Americans were killed and one crewman, Eugene Hasenfus, is now a prisoner of the leftist Nicaraguan government. 
Documents recovered from the plane and interviews with principals show that the llopango operation was a major resupply effort, involv­ing more than 100 flights dating back to early 1986. Reagan secretly authorized U.S. arms 

sales to Iran in January.

Preservation of human life is our duty 
Dear Editor: 
On Dec. 6, the first annual Respect for Life Mass and Dinner will be held on the Notre Dame campus. I encour­age all of you to attend and ·to support these significant events at the Univer­sity. 
The respect for human life from the moment of conception to the time of death is the responsibility of all of us. It is important that we take the occa­sion of this Mass and dinner to reflect upon this issue and to re-commit our­selves to the protection and preserva­tion of this gift from God. We can do no less than to preserve what is most sacred and most human. 
Let us join together as the Notre Dame family on Dec. 6 to celebrate human life and our commitment to it. Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C. President, University of Notre Dame 
Everyone must respect holiness of life 
Dear Editor: 
I wish it were possible for me to be present for your celebration at Euc­harist and dinner of the sacredness of all life on Dec. 6. Although a long­standing commitment will have me in Atlanta, Georgia on that day, I shall be with all of you in spirit as you celebrate. 
At Saint Mary's College, we are profoundly aware of the Catholic and the Holy Cross traditions about the holi­ness of life. These traditions are founded on the life and teaching of Jesus about life, best summarized, I think, in the words of Jesus: "I have come so that they may have life and have it to the full." John 10:10. 
Know that the efforts of your group to focus the attention of our commun­ities on the sacred character of all life, unborn and born, is a welcome reminder to us to continue our search for ways to affirm the commitment of Saint Mary's to a deep and lasting respect for life. 
Dr. Mary Feeley, the director of Campus Ministry at Saint Mary's, will bring to you and your group my per­sonal greetings on the Dec. 6, the feast of Saint Nicholas, a saint who has long symbolized the tradition's love for life, especially the life of the young. At Saint Mary's, we shall be remembering also that the weekend honors our patron­ness, Mary, the Mother of Jesus. 
William H. Hickey Saint Mary's President 
Everyone encouraged to attend celebration 
Dear Editor: 
The Right to Life is sponsoring a mass and dinner Dec. 6. 

We have worked very hard in prepar­ing for this Mass and dinner. I can't imagine that the Notre DameSaint Mary's community isn't ready to show their support for life. We urge everyone to attend the mass and offer prayers for life with us. And we hope many will come to the dinner and meet faculty and townspeople who have actively worked to fight the great evil of abor­tion. 
Bishop D'Arcy is coming to say the Mass, and our speaker for the dinner is the United States Assistant Deputy Attorney General. Prof. Douglas Kmiec is another great speaker that has been lined up, too. 
It will be embarrassing if the turnout is small for this will suggest that this community is apathetic in its commit­ment to defending the lives of innocent babies in the womb. We really need stu­dents to turn out in large numbers and buy tickets today in the dining hall ­their last chance to· obtain tickets. 
The Mass will be at 5 p.m. in Sacred Heart Church, and the dinner will be in the North Dining Hall at 6:30 p.m. on Dec. 6. Student tickets are $8, faculty tickets are $10 (call 5825 for reserva­tions).

I am the Nicaragua student who was told to "sit down and shut up" during Sandinista Vice-President Ramirez' visit to Notre Dame. Luckily for me he did not bring along the "turbas divinas" or "divine mobs," as Presi­dent Ortega calls them, to beat me up for disagreeing with the government. It should be said that I was congrat­ulated and helped on by some of those present. As expected, Ramirez dis­missed all questions about policy as ex­aggerations or lies. I will not take on his warped version of events in Nicaragua because it was obvious that every question posed to him by the stu­
. dents was inquiring about the veracity of his statements. Suffice to say that the Sandinistas have not delivered any of the promises made to the OAS in 1979. The elections held were no better than the frauds of the Somozas; political pluralism is paid lip service but the reality is a one party system. The free press began to be destroyed with the shutdown of the newspaper "Pueblo" in 1980, long

before Contra time. The Church in Nicaragua is divided and the higher number of priests today is made up of those who subscribe to liberation the­ology, which has no conflict with man being made subservient to the state. These are specifically imported priests to train others in their views and ul­timately engulf the hierarchical Church, led by Cardinal Obando y Bravo who is still the most popular man in Nicaragua. 
It is not surprising that Ramirez would call those who oppose his gov­ernment Somocistas; under the San­dinismo banner you are either friend or foe. Ironically, it is Ramirez who has the best Somocista credentials, which cannot be said of any of the Contra leaders Calero, Cruz and Robelo. His apologetics to the Somozas in the news­paper "Poliedro" are still well remem­bered in his hometown of Masatepe as an old Masatepeno lawyer told me just recently. 
Ramirez did not deny what I said about his parents and himself, he said that he had not come to discuss his fam­ily, but this may have been too subtle for the reporter present there that day. My conscience is at ease for I know I have told the truth; I have no fear.

ROBIN SQUYRES features writer 

Tucked away in the basememt of the Administration Building, the tiny Office of Financial Aid quietly processes thousands of forms and appropriates millions of dollars each year. Two-thirds of the Notre Dame student body make use of some kind of finan­cial aid, and a great majority of these students are processed through this office. 
Amazingly enough, for the amount of money that is han­dled, the Office of Financial Aid is essentially a system of manual filing; there is only limited com­puter assistance. Regardless, this office can provide the most up-to-date financial information needed to set up a financial plan for any student demonstrating monetary need. 
The staff must serve as coun­selors, public relations officers and finance experts and must stay on top of all new legislation that may change the funds they receive and the qualifications necessary to distribute them. 
They try very hard to keep a "personal touch" in the often confusing sphere of financial aid. 
"I see tlnancial aid as both an art and a science," says Joe Rus­so, director of the Office of Fin­ancial Ald. "We try to use com­passion and understanding...rather than just formulas and boxes." 
Russo put forth a little-known fact, "The University's top fundraising priority is under­graduate scholarships." Finan­cial Aid has not always enjoyed this status. In fact, it has taken years ofbitter struggle by faculty, trustees, student government and alumni to achieve this posi­tion. 
As Russo explains it, tlnancial aid is essential to the unique di­versity that Notre Dame's student body demonstrates. "Our ability to offer tlnancial aid is one ofour best means to attract the top stu­dents." 
Notre Dame's relatively high cost can frighten away excellent potential students. Notre Dame's student body then suffers, be­cause its diversity is narrowed by monetary qualitlcations. A bit of its unique flavor is dulled with every student who rejects Notre Dame as a choice because they think they cannot afford it. 
The Office of Financial Aid has "a very simple goal. Get people into the system," says Russo. To get Into the system, Russo en­courages people to come in with questions, for part of this goal is to explain the confusing tlnanclal aid process. 
The staff will explain exactly what tlnancial aid is, determine qualitlcation and explain the dif­ferent kinds of aid that are avail­able and the pitfalls involved, "rather than just what goes in box 23A."

tary scholarships are available to  
those participating in the  
Reserve Officers Training Corps.  
Many Notre Dame Alumni Clubs  
offer scholarships to students  
from their area. These scholar­ 
ships awards are based on,

Loans  
The second type of aid, a loan,  
is money borrowed for the stu­

is a loan provided by the federal  
government. Interest does not  
begin to accrue until six months  
after the conclusion of the edu­ 
cation, at a rate of five percent  
per year.

Freshman Kevin Markovitz paced the Irish scoring Friday night with four assists. Fellow freshmen Bruce Guay and Tim Kuehl each added a goal. Matt Hanzel and Bob Bilton had the other Irish scores. 
Saturday night, the Irish got a strong performance in the nets from junior Jeff Hender­son as they completed the sweep, 4-1. Henderson withstood a 45-shot barrage by the Foresters and got some good defensive help in the third period to preserve the win. 
Notre Dame jumped out on top at the 8:39 mark of the opening stanza on a McNeill power-play goal. The Foresters answered a minute later with a Luis Hondros goal. McNeill continued to break out of his scoring slump with another power-play tally at the 14­minute mark to put the Irish ahead for keeps. 
Rich Sobilo, one of the few seniors on the Notre Dame squad, and sophomore Tom Fitzgerald each scored in the second period to round out the scoring. 

"It was really nice to get the wins to get back to the .500 mark," said Smith. "We still have to work on coming out of our own end and our defensive coverage. 
"Remember, we're young, but we've improved since the first series with Kent State. If we continue to gain confidence, we'll be competitive."

Women's basketball drops season opener to Rutgers, 71-50 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
Notre Dame women's bas­ketball coach Mary DiStanis­lao tried an old Notre Dame psyche tactic Saturday after­noon against Rutgers. But to her dismay, DiStanislao found that an older cliche still applies as her Irish lost to the No. 6 Lady Knights, 71-50 
The Irish warmed up in their regular home white uniforms, but came out of the locker room wearing new gold uniforms they had received for winning the North Star Conference last season. Unfortunately, that old Notre Dame ploy wasn't enough to offset the 29 turn­overs the Irish committed, proving once again the old adage that turnovers'll kill you. 
"There you have it," said DiStanislao when informed of the number of turnovers her squad had. "The two things we worked on before the game were the transition game and protecting the ball. We didn't do either." 
Behind the strong inside game of all-American Sue Wicks, the Lady Knights were able to convert numerous Irish miscues into easy buckets. Wicks finished with 24 points, a career-high 20 rebounds (nine on the offensive glass) and four blocked shots. As a team, Rut­gers outrebounded Notre Dame, 50-40 
The Irish started off in good shape, jumping out to a 4-2lead in the first minute of the bal­lgame. Mter a Rutgers time out, however, it would be over eight minutes before Notre Dame scored again. The Lady Knights went to a full-court press which resulted in three straight layups for Telicher Austin. 

The Irish battled back to cut the deficit to 26-18 at the half. But from there, it was the Sue Wicks Show. The Irish had held the 6-2 forward to just four points in the opening half, but behind an assortment Of Wicks shots and rebound outlets in the second half, the Lady Knights bolted to a 41-22 lead with just under 12 minutes left to play. With both Sandy Botham and Beth Morrison (who started in place of Heidi Bunek, who is recovering from pneumonia) in foul trouble, The Irish could not offset the strong inside play of Wick and teammate Regina 
Howard. Howard finished with a game-high 25 points and 12 rebounds. IRISH ITEMS -Irish guard Mary Gavin had three assists against Rutgers, moving her just two behind Laura Doug­herty's career mark of 326.

consecutive points over the last 12 minutes of the contest, after USC had scrapped and clawed its way to a 37-20 lead. 
The furious Irish assault began at this point, with Beuer­lein (18 completions, 27 at­tempts, 285 yards) linking up with Jackson on two long passes, the second going 42 yards for the touchdown. Jack-· son even caught a subsequent two-point conversion attempt, although it was nullified by an illegal motion penalty. Despite this setback Carney managed to get one point to put the Irish back in the game at 37-27 with 11 minutes left to play. 
"We kept believing," said Beuerlein. "The offense had so much confidence today, and we knew if the defense could hold, we'd keep fighting until we won it." 
It took a little while, but even­tually the Irish defense did hold, stopping the Trojans in dramatic fashion on a fourth­and-inches from the Notre Dame five-yard line. On the play, which concluded a 65­yard march built on a relent­less ground attack, USC quar­terback Rodney Peete (10-of-23, 171 yards) was met on the sneak by Kleine, Kovaleski, and a wall of white jerseys. Although a heated argument came from Peete and Trojan head coach Ted Tollner as to the placement of the ball, there was no measure­ment and Notre Dame once again had possession of the ball. 
"It was the worst call I've ever seen," said Peete, who was hit with a 15-yard penalty for complaining to the officials. "I thought I had made about a yard and a half." 
"He didn't get it," argued Kovaleski. "We anticipated the sneak when we saw him looking with his eyes to the side he was going to go over, and we stopped his momentum. He

twisted, but it was over once we stopped his momentum." 
The Irish defense certainly stopped Southern Cal's mo­mentum with that play. Up to that point, USC had had good success running the ball behind backs Ryan Knight (22 carries for 90 yards) and Todd Steele (12-for-48), and had scored on all but one possession in the second half. 
This was in sharp contrast to the first half, which saw Notre Dame play well only to give up 17 points on big plays. Southern Cal cornerback Lou Brock (son of the ex-baseball star by the same name) made the biggest play, racing 58 yards for the touchdown after stepping in front of an unwisely-thrown Beuerlein pass, while Trojan kicker Don Shafer made the most outstanding, booting a school-record 60-yard field goal before the half to forge the 20-9 halftime margin. 
Still, these feats just weren't going to be enough on a day when Notre Dame was not to be denied. With the ball on their own 20-yard line and down by 10 points late in the game, Beuerlein and crew went back to work, this time marching 80 yards in eight plays for the score. By far the back-breaker for the USC defense came on the second play of the drive, when Beuerlein set up behind good protection and lofted a 49­yard bomb to the unstoppable Brown. That pass carried the ball to the Southern Cal25-yard line, where six plays later, Beuerlein hit a streaking Braxston Banks for a five-yard touchdown. 
Irish tight end Andy Heck then took a Beuerlein pass at the one-yard line and fought his way into the end zone for the all-important two-point conver­sion that made it 37-35 in favor of the Trojans.

"I thought USC played an outstanding game," said Holtz. "They were well-coached and well-prepared.
