Present pleasures pound past ponderings 
Wouldn't it be great to have those "old days" of childhood back again? the column in this space asked on Tuesday. 
It's hard to answer no. Mter all, I, too, loved watching "Speed Racer," "Ultra Man," "Scooby Doo" and the "Banana Splits." I loved collecting Wacky Packages and playing with my G.I. Joe, Mr. Potatohead and Etch-A­Sketch. 
But wait a second. Let's not forget about the present. It's pretty darn good, too. 
Granted, we do have more worries and re­sponsibilities now. But look at what else we have. These, after all, are the days of ... 
Getting a Grand Slam breakfast at Denny's, a breakfast bar at Azar's or a plate of grease at Fat Shirley's ... closing Senior Bar and then heading to Bridgett's to watch the pool-table dancers ... going to the Grotto at 2 a.m. and praying that you don't flunk a test ... having that prayer answered the next day .. . 
Seeing the dome while lying down on the bank of St. Joseph's Lake ... hearing your professor open the first day of class by saying, "You'll have two tests this semester, no term papers and the final will not be cumulative." ...spend­ing a day getting sunburned at the dunes ... 
Riding United Limo to Chicago's O'Hare air­port, where you'll catch a plane for home . ; . getting home for Christmas break, where your parents treat you like a king because they haven't seen you in three months ... 
Roadtripping to an away football game just to watch it in a bar ... hearing the Notre Dame Fight Song on a Saturday morning ... sweating at a Stepan Center pep rally when it's 40 degrees outside ... reading a note on a classroom door that says, "Professor Jones' 9:05 class has been cancelled today" ... 
' Traveling to Margaritaville at Chi Chi's ... looking through the slit in your mailbox and seeing a letter ... humming the Alma Mater, except for the last few words which you sing . . . finishing your last final ... convincing your professor to extend the due date on your 10-page paper ... 
Beating the lunchtime crowd at the dining hall ... going next door to a friend's room and bullsh---ing until 3 a.m.... looking up at the clock and seeing you only have five minutes left in your last class on Friday. . . 
Getting a convincing fake I.D.... seeing your first Keenan Revue ... being down to your last pair of underwear and getting your laundry back ... seeing $10 bills spit out of the credit union's money machine ... 
Watching a punted ball float toward Tim Brown ... tapping a keg at 3 a.m.... finishing a test after an all-nighter, then heading for bed 

Mark Pankowski 
Managing Editor 

knowing you don't have another for at least a week . . . browsing through Goodwill looking for a reclining chair ... "studying" on the li­brary's second floor .. . 
Sleeping in on a Sunday morning ... and af­ternoon... tailgating all morning ... and af­ternoon . . . going to class wearing the same clothes you wore the night before, and a baseball cap ... 
Smelling the Knights of Columbus' steak sandwiches on home game Saturdays ... "directing" the band as it plays the 1812 Over­ture ... JPW ... watching "The Grinch Who Stole Christmas" and "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" when you should be studying for finals . . . lying to the Security guard to get your car on campus, even if it is just for an hour ... 
The list could go on, but you get the idea. Despite the added responsibilities and worries, these days are as good as, if not better than, those of childhood. 
So enjoy the present instead of longing for the "old days." After all, like your childhood days, these days will soon be gone, too. 
And then they'll become the "good old days."

Watergate investigators give anti-Bork testimony
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Robert Bork was accused Tuesday of rewriting history to make him­self "the hero of Watergate," while former Attorney General Elliot Richardson vigorously defended the Supreme Court nominee's conduct in the firing of the Watergate special pros­ecutor 14 years ago. 
Richardson told the Senate Judiciary Committee, "I think the nation owes Robert Bork a substantial debt." 
But members of the special prosecution team that inves­tigated the Watergate scandal made it clear they felt other­wise. 
Meanwhile, Sen. Alan Cranston, the Senate's second­ranking Democrat, said sup­port for Bork's confirmation has slipped so much that "I think he's licked." 
At the White House, Presidential Spokesman Mar­lin Fitzwater said Bork himself has been meeting with senators individually as part of the con­tinuing effort to win confirma­tion. 
Fitzwater also said Presi­dent Reagan intends to lobby senators, personally as well as on the telephone. 
"We have four or five weeks before the vote; there is plenty of time," he said. 
The spokesman said Reagan is not considering whom he might nominate if Bork is rejected and "gets angry at the very thought of even mention­ing a replacement." 
At the hearings, which are nearing an end in the same Sen­ate room where the Watergate hearings were conducted, the Judiciary Committee heard once again differing versions of what occurred on Oct. 20, 1973, and in the following days. 
On that Saturday night, in rapid succession, Richardson resigned rather than obey President Nixon's order to fire Watergate prosecutor Ar­chibald Cox, Richardson's top deputy was fired, and finally, Bork, the third-ranking Justice Department official at the time, carried out Nixon's com­mand.

HPC, Hickey discuss food fights, plan appreciation night 
By SUSAN MARHEFKA News staff 
Calling the Sept. 12 food fight an "unfortunate circum­stance," William Hickey, director of food services, spoke to the HPC meeting last night at Lyons Hall. 
Hickey addressed the issue of food fights, stating that his staff "works very hard to elim­inate food fights" and has tried to do so for the past six years that he has been director. He also told the council that the cancelling of special food events for the semester is a "protest, not a punishment" and that he is "not indicting the entire campus." 
However, his main message to the council was that there are "real people" working in the halls who "need more consideration" because their job is to prepare food the students "can enjoy and are en­titled to." 
"The food service industry is not an easy business," Hickey said, adding that his staff often has to work hard and for long hours. 
As an apology to Hickey and those who work in the food ser­vices industry, the HPC and the Student Senate have joined forces and tenatively sched­uled Oct. 8 as food services ap­preciation night. From 4: 15 to 
7: 15 p.m. volunteers from the HPC and the senate will work in the dining halls to show the services staff that the student leaders are _supportive of them and appreciate their efforts, according to Pat Cooke, stu­dent 
"We want people to know that we're working on behalf of food services," he said. 
The HPC also discussed measures to prevent food fights from happening again. In­cluded among the ideas: having monitors in the dining halls after football games, ser­ving dinner later in the evening and serving food on paper plates and cups. Another sug­gestion was to increase the awareness among students of the penalties of throwing food, which can be up to $100 in fines, confiscation of a student's ID and 25 hours of service in the dining halls. 
"We want the students to realize how good the workers and the system are," one HPC member said. 
In other news, the annual multi-cultural fall festival is 
approaching. Some special 
events this year include: an In­
dian pow-wow Oct. 6 at 8 p.m. 
on White field, a concert lec­
ture on the history of jazz at 
Theodore's Oct. 7 at 7:30p.m., 
and "A Taste of Nations," Oct. 
10 from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the 
Stepan Center. 

Sign-ups for the Oct. 11 10-K Crop Walk to benefit the poor people of the world will be held the week of Oct. 5 in the dining and residence halls.

there is no place at Notre Dame for this activity.' " Hickey said. 
In most cases, those who par­ticipated in the food fight were not showing their displeasure with Food Services, Hickey said. 
"In some cases the students are very belligerent regarding the staff and have been ex­tremely insulting. But I think there are others ... you're in the dining halls, you get hit by something and what's you're reaction? You strike back. And I think a lot of those students were innocent," he said. 
"There's a couple that I have talked to ... who said 'I was only reacting to a situation where I got hit and I was either shaking stuff off or was throw­ing something back in retalia­tion,' " Hickey added. 
Hickey was told by three members of the Hall Presi­dent's Council Friday that most of the students respect Food service workers.

Vale officials slam article depicting school as 'gay' 
Associated Press 
NEW HAVEN, Conn. -Yale University President Benno Schmidt has labeled as "drivel" a newspaper article that depicts Yale as a "gay school," and a school officer said Tuesday that homosexuals make up only "a minute frac­tion" of its population. 

Mines

Iran-Iraq war. Kuwait insists it is neutral. 
On Sept. 21, the Navy at­tacked and captured the lan­ding craft Iran Ajr and said it was caught in the act of laying mines. Iran said the vessel was not carrying any military cargo and vowed revenge. 
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, back in Washing­ton after a trip to the gulf, said Tuesday that the United States would not hesitate to attack any other Iranian vessel caught sowing mines. 
Iran's Foreign Ministry said similar statements by Weinberger on Friday in Bah­
rain  were  "hostile  and  
provocative."

Hoffman said the lOth convoy left Kuwait on Monday and was steaming "uneventfully" south through the central gulf. He said the guided-missile frigate USS Hawes was escorting the 46,723-ton tanker Gas Prince. 
"Three possible mines were sighted Sunday by the Navy destroyer Kidd and its anti­submarine helicopter about 15 
Schmidt harshly criticized both The Wall Street Journal and the free-lance author of the article in a letter written to about 40 alumni and then dis­tributed to about 2,000 fund­raisers. 
University Secretary Sheila Wellington said Schmidt wrote his letter in response to letters from alumni who were upset by 
miles north of Dubai," Hof­fman said. "But ... we have no concrete evidence that there are any mines there. So based on present information, reports of extensive new mine fields in the southern Persian Gulf are ... overdrawn."

the Journal piece. But she said she did not believe the publicity would cause a drop in dona­tions. 
The Journal's Aug. 4 article was a first-person essay in the Leisure & Arts page by Julie Iovine, a 1977 Yale graduate who lives part-time in New Haven. 
In the article, Iovine quotes one Yale student who said she received a notice calling one in four Yale students a gay. 
The article goes on to con­clude that "suddenly, Yale has a reputation as a gay school." 
Schmidt and Wellington chal­lenged the assertion that 25 per­cent of Yale student were gay. 
"The attribution . . . has no basis in fact,'' Wellington said.

Kris Franklin, a junior and the co-coordinator of a group called Yalesbians, agreed with Schmidt, saying she didn't think Yale had more gays than anyplace else. 
"Possibly people here are more open about coming out," she said, referring to the liberal nature of student life. 
Another student, Anna Louisa Tittmann, a junior from Concord, Mass., echoed Franklin's point: "I think Yale is a place where people stand up for their rights and are more obvious about it, but I don't think Yale is a gay school." 
In 1986, the student Yale Gay and Lesbian Cooperative esti­mated that about 10 percent of Yale's students, faculty and staff were homosexual. The fig­ure was based on a 1948 study by the Kinsey Institute that es­timated that 10 percent of the general population had primarily homosexual ten­dencies. 

In a telephone interview from New York, Iovine said Schmidt was "taking some low blows" in criticizing her. 
"I think the reaction has been really extreme," she said. 
She said she had talked to 25 people and extensively read the Yale student newspaper, the Yale Daily News, as research for the article. 
"I'm not saying that Yale is overrun by gays, which, by the way, what's wrong with that," she said.

"The big spenders in Congress will have a fight on their hands," he said, adding that those who expect him to agree to tax hikes or defense cuts were "nuts." 
Reagan's harsh words at the 
ceremony contrasted sharply 
with his statements earlier 
Tuesday before an audience of 
international financiers criti­• 
cal of the huge U.S. deficit. 
There, he praised the bill as "a signal that America is not backing down from its respon­sibilities." 
In a speech to a joint meeting of the World Bank and the In­ternational Monetary Fund, the president called for a cooperative effort among the world's financial powers to help Third World nations solve their debt crisis. But he said he cannot lecture others without dealing first with America's own problems. 
"It is imperative that the United States consistently reduce its federal deficit spend­ing," Reagan said, taking note of the Gramm-Rudman bill.

Ethics replacing 1ssues 1n campa1gn 
No one ever said that the road to the
• White House would be paved with gold. This was certainly the bitter lesson that Senator Joseph Eiden (D-DE) learned last week when he announced his withdrawal from the 1988 presidential elections. Eiden now joins the ranks of Senator Gary Hart (D-CO) whose poli-, tical campaign was devastated last May when the press leaked details of his "monkey-business" adventures in Bimini. The historians are hailing this as the post-Watergate era of morality, while the American people and future presidential hopefuls have been ren­dered skeptical, at best, about the en­vironment of presidential politics. During a year that has been hal­lmarked by publicized scandals, the voters are sensitive to issues of per­sonal trust and integrity and politicians are faced with the awkward task of having to defend their character. 
Lisa Boykin 
in thru the out door 
Syracuse University Law School, 1965, was the setting for what would eventually serve to haunt Eiden's presidential campaign. As a first year student, Eiden was reprimanded for "lifting," without citation, five pages of a published law review which he in­cluded in a 15 page legal methods report. The senator-to-be was allowed to take the course again and earned an 80 as final grade. More recently, Senator Eiden's speeches in Iowa and California used word-for-word, and again without attribution, passages from British Labor Leader Neil Kin-· nock and the late Senator Robert Ken­nedy. Eiden's speeches evoked the idealism of the 1960's, but was this more than hollow rhetoric and borrowed ideas? Amidst accusations of plagarism and exaggerated academic credentials, political spectators won­dered whether Eiden's campaign could survive the turbulent storm. One thing was for sure--he would need more than a new speechwriter to salvage his sinking ship. Nevertheless, Eiden at­tempted to restore the public's trust by releasing his law school transcripts and dismissing the charges of plagarism as "much ado about nothing." His credibility, though, had been ir­reparably damaged. Even Johnny Car­son joked in his monologue that Eiden had gathered his staff together and

\ 

reassured them, "you have nothing to fear but fear itself." Eiden's campaign, which never generated more than 5% at the Gallop Polls, was destroyed. And then there were six. 
The timing of these media incidents was no coincidence as Eiden even stated himself. As chairman of the Sen­ate Judiciary Committee, this was his golden opportunity to introduce himself to the public during the Judge Bork con­firmation hearings. At a time when he was questioning Bork's morality, the American people questioned Eiden's credibility. But sabotaging Eiden's campaign meant more than ruining his chances to become president; after all, he wasn't exactly the front runner. The controversy surrounding Eiden un­equivocally served to impede the Amer­ican public's ability to examine, with­out distraction, Bork's qualifications. The media coverage given to the Eiden scandal shifted the limelight away from Bork and his controversial judicial phi­losophy while projecting a dark cloud of doubt over Eiden, who . has lead the troops to battle Bork's confirmation. Now, the rumors are circulating as to the source of the media leaks since the juxtaposed speech clips of Eiden, Kin­nock and Kennedy were disclosed to the media by an unknown source. My money was on the Republicans, but Time magazine has alleged that Dem­ocratic rival, Governor Michael Dukakis, is the guilty culprit. Who knows, perhaps this will eliminate him from the presidential race as the details unravel. 
If all of this seems confusing and ridiculous--it should. The environment of presidential politics has turned into a three-ring circus. It resembles the plot of some network soap opera more than it does a campaign election for the nation's most coveted office. There is, however, one resounding message in all this madness: If you have any skeletons in the closet, politics is not a wise career choice. (This holds true only if you don't have a campaign staff capable of hiding "the dirt" until after election.) Ironi­cally enough, if the level of public scrutiny had been this intense in years past, an overwhelming majority of this nation's most powerful leaders would never have been elected. If it's any con­solation to Senator Eiden, President Reagan has been known to "borrow" his fair share of Hollywood movie an­tedotes in his political speeches, and wife Nancy was three months pregnant when she married Ronnie. And what about the rumors of JFK and Marilyn

Monroe? Even one of the celebrated founding fathers and framers of the Constitution, Thomas Jefferson, was scandalous. He had an elicit love affair with his slave mistress for 20 years. (I give Jefferson credit, though, because at least he had the decency to make provisions in his will for his offspring's freedom.) 
Although I do find most of this amusing, it is rather disheartening to consider the future legacy of America. The public and the media are more in­terested in uncovering the moral tur­pitude of its presidential candidates than evaluating their merit, qualifica­tions and platform. Granted, the recent scandals which have erupted are un­doubtedly the result of bad judgement and indiscretion on the part of Hart and Eiden. However, the standard of public scrutiny is so intense that even the bravest and most qualified candidates are skeptical about their chances for survival. I certainly hope that Richard Goodwin, former speechwriter for JF'K and LBJ, wasn't correct when he said "we're going to end up with a person of perfect virtue and no vision."

P.O. Box Q l 
Counseline gives clarification 
Dear Editor: 

A letter of September 24 entitled "Lack of counseling greatly disturbing'' seems to require both explanation and clarification. "Counseline," our tele­phone service which provides tapes on selected topics, began operation on Sep­tember 28, at 4:00p.m. This service, which is handled by students, began as soon as we had enough volunteers. As the ad which appeared in the newspa­
15 IT R£~L... 
Trudeau 

per last week noted, we had been short of volunteers but are now ready to begin. 
Counseline has nothing to do with the availability of Counseling. During hours when the University Counseling Center (previously Counseling and Psy­chological Services) is not open, emer­gency services are available through our regular number, 239-7336. Coun­seline is an information service and not 
intended  to  provide  emergency  ser­ 
vices.

Irish defensive tackle 
Gorman switches to defense 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
Tom Gorman did almost everything at Brother Rice High School in Chicago, as the president of the National Honor Society, captain of the basket­ball team, and tight end, punter, and linebacker on the football team. 
But after one year without seeing any playing time in col­lege, he found out that Notre Dame was going to ask him to add yet another skill to his repertoire -defensive tackle. 
"I was recruited as a tight end out of high school, but when I got here I gained about 45 pounds and lost about 1 V2 seconds on my time, so they moved me to defense," said the 6'6", 260-pound senior. "I was kind of glad because I was fifth­string tight end, and I knew I had a chance at the defensive line because not many people were coming back." 
While Gorman no longer had to worry about beating out the likes of Joel Williams and Andy Heck, he did have the problem of trying to learn a position he had never played before. 
"My freshman and sopho­more years in high school I played defense at linebacker, but my junior and senior years I was strictly tight end," said Gorman. "It was sort of start­ing from scratch. He (defensive line coach Joe Yonto) had a free mold to play with because I was virtually an infant." 
But Yonto saw a definite ad­vantage in Gorman's experi­ence at tight end that would help on the defensive line. 
"By playing on offense, he learned what the various blocks were, and the thing on defense he has to do is learn how to counter those blocks," Yonto said. "By knowing what those blocks were, it kind of gives him an advantage. It's like your studies -you have a better chance of doing well if you know what the test's on." 
Gorman progressed enough to earn a starting position on the defensive line, but not until he made another switch. Gor­man had planned on sharing time with nose tackle Mike Griffin, but a pre-season knee injury to Ted FitzGerald, the projected starter at left tackle, put Gorman in that spot, where he has started ever since. 
"They moved me there two weeks before the Michigan

game," said Gorman. "It's not like a different position com­pletely, but the footwork and technique are what I need to get used to. As the season progresses, it's getting easier, but at first it was difficult." 
Gorman has impressed Yonto with his work habits in switching positions. 
"He's a hard worker, a will­ing person, and he always gives his best," said Yonto. "He's come a long way, and he keeps improving. He's improved on initial takeoff more than anyth­ing else. He needs to work on double-team work, pass rush, and finding the football, but he keeps hustling and working at it." 
His improvement has helped a defense that features only four returning starters to allow less than ten points per game so far this season. 
"Coach Yonto and (fellow de­fensive tackle) Jeff Kunz helped me out with technique and gave points on how to play tackle," said the Evergreen Park, Ill., native. "Like they say, we're 'No Names'. It's vir­tually a clean slate, and nobody was expecting us to do what we have. That's what inspired to do as well as we have, and it's also primarily due to the coach­ing staff. The fact that we're a tight group is another definite benefit." 
Having switched positions after one player's injury, Gor­man now is hoping he can con­tinue to improve in his new role and not suffer the same misfor­tune. 
SMC,ND play to tie 
By MOLLY MCNEILL Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's soccer team clashed with the Fighting Irish Tuesday on Center Field at Saint Mary's. In a physical battle the two teams played to a 0-0 tie. 
The Belles and the Irish played late last week and Coach Tom Van Meter knew it would be difficult to beat the Irish twice in such a short span. 
"It's hard to play a team twice in one week and come out on top both times, especially when it is an emotional game,'' said Van Meter. 
The Belles' goalie, Patty Hat­field, kept the ball out of the net, making 15 saves to earn the shutout. 
Early in the first half, Irish forward Kate Titterton chal­lenged the Saint Mary's defense, but her shot deflected off Hatfield's hands and hit the crossbar, falling behind the goal. 
The Irish kept coming on strong but it was Hatfield who beat the Irish forwards to the ball time and time again. 
Early in the second half an Irish defender tripped Meehan, 

giving the Belles  an  indirect  
free kick.  
Mollie  Meehan  placed  the  

shot behind the Irish wall, but the pass was met by the Irish goalie, Helen Gilboy. 
When time ran out, both teams were physically ex­hausted, but no one emerged with a victory. 
"it was mce to have a shutout for Patty. She has played ex­ceptionally all season," said Van Meter. 

Volleyball team hits crunch week 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
It's crunch time for the Notre Dame volleyball team and the Irish hope to be doing the crunching, starting tonight at Northwestern. 
Notre Dame plays four matches in four days this week, against formidable opponents who will be attempting to end an eight-match winning streak for the Irish. 
The Wildcats come into the contest ranked No. 16 in the na­tion and sporting an 11-1 record. Their only loss came at the hands of eighth-ranked Colorado State. 


Irish jump to fifth in AP Poll 
Associated Press 
The Fighting Irish football team made another strong move in the Associated Press College Poll this week, jumping from eighth to fifth following Saturday's 44-20 victory over Purdue. 
Oklahoma remained No.1 for the fifth straight week, but No. 2 Nebraska moved closer to its Big Eight Conference rival. 
The Sooners, who routed Tulsa 65-0 Saturday, received 44 of 60 first-place votes and 1,181 of a possible 1,200 points Tuesday from a nationwide panel of sports writers and sportscasters. Nebraska, which beat Arizona State 35-28, received 12 first-place votes and 1,136 points. 
Miami of Florida became the first team in three weeks other than Oklahoma and Nebraska to get a vote for No. 1. The Hur­ricanes received the other four first-place ballots and 1,088

The National League East battle is pretty much a Cardinals-Mets confrontation, but Montreal is still mathema­tically in it and can pick up ground this week with their se­ries at St. Louis. In all proba­bility, though, it's a two-team battle between the last two Na­tional League champions. 
Detroit-Toronto is not the only head-on collision for the title this weekend. Down three games to St. Louis at this writing, the Mets will come to Busch Stadium on Friday and will probably need to sweep, or at least take two-of-three. Darn. 
Call them chokers after blowing the 1985 World Series to Kansas City, but after Sun­day we'll be calling the Car­dinals the Eastern Division champs. 
Will the Fall Classic go international? Will the Mets repeat (an injustice if there ever was one)? 
Probably not, but the action on the diamond this weekend will be the deciding factor for both questions. So, if you need to blow off some study time, and you too aren't excited about a league in which In­dianapolis now has just as good a chance as everyone else, the baseball pennant showdowns may be the answer. You won't be disappointed. 
Notre Dame defeated Northwestern last fall at home in a long 3-2 game victory, one of the most impressive of the 33-7 campaign. 
The Irish then play at DePaul on Thursday. The Blue Demons are 6-10 on the season. Friday's action takes the team to Butler before returning home on Sat­urday night to meet Iowa. 
The Iowa contest on Satur­day night will begin at 7: 30 
p.m. in the Joyce ACC. This matchup will be an important clash for both teams, since the Hawkeyes are ranked eighth in the latest Midwest Regional Poll, just above ninth-ranked Notre Dame. Both teams are looking for recognition in hopes

The 11-2 Irish are on a roll these days, winning eight straight and going 28-3 since last October. Though Satur­day's contest is only the third of the season, Notre Dame has not lost in the Joyce ACC since September 16 of last year, 13 matches ago. 
Still, Head Coach Art Lam­bert says the Irish have not yet played their best volleyball of the season.

Irish beat Bowling Green 

By PETE GEGEN  
Assistant Sports Editor  
Off to its best start ever, the  
Irish soccer team improved its  
record to 10-0-1 Tuesday night  
by edging Bowling Green 2-1 in  
overtime.  
Not since the 1978 squad went  
10-0 before suffering its first  
loss has an Irish soccer team  
done so well. But to reach that  
milestone the team had to ward  
off a tough Bowling Green  
squad.  
Midfielder Joe Sternberg  
scored the game winner at the  
99:23 mark when he volleyed a  
Randy Morris crossing pass  
through the hands of the Fal­ 
cons' keeper.  
Notre Dame continued to  
pressure Bowling Green all but  
the final two minutes of over­ 
time. Then the Falcons mus­ 
tered one last surge, and it took

Stanford crushes Cavanaugh 
By TIM SULLIVAN Sports Writer 
Stanford football coach AI 
Martin wasn't happy with the 
way his team played on Satur­
day. His powerful Stanford 
squad only ' defeated 
Cavanaugh by a score of 20-0. 

Martin may have had cause to be disappointed, considering his team's 41-point perfor­mance last week against Holy Cross. 
"We really didn't play well," sighed Martin. "We made far too many mental mental mis­takes." 
Had Martin, at quarterback, not had the services of his flanker, John Sheehan, then Cavanaugh may have had a chance. Sheehan, in his first season of organized football, made three touchdown catches in the game, bringing his two­game total to five. 
Cavanaugh coach Rick Boneau tried to confuse Stan­ford by running a gadget defense. Boneau sent' his cor­nerback on a blitz, and Martin immiediately found Sheehan on a fly pattern for a 65-yard touchdown, the first score of the game. 
Three plays later, Stanford had the. ball again, and the Sheehan-Martin connection poised to strike. From the Cavanaugh 15-yard line, Sheehan faded up the sideline for his second touchdown in less than five minutes. 
"With our run-oriented of­fense," noted Boneau, "we didn't want to have to come from behind." 
But behind is exactly where Boneau found his team. Cavanaugh was forced to con­centrate on the passing game, and the Caveman offense sput­tered. 
Stanford ended Cavanaugh's hopes for a comeback late in the second half, as Martin guided his team on an long drive which ate up the game clock and sealed the victory. 
In the Rockne small dorm league, The Screamin' Otters of Sorin used a combination of offensive stars to defeat Car­roll 22-0. 
Sorin quarterback Tom Zidar was the first star. The sophomore tossed one touch­down pass and ran for another. out the first half. 
Freshman • Tim O'Shaugnessy, though, was the big star. The halfback ran for one touchdown, caught a 50­yard pass from Zidar, and returned a punt for thirty yards. 
As opposed to Sorin's turn­around, Fisher kept right on rolling, dismantling St. Ed's 30­0. 
Alumni opened their season with its first victory in two years, as the Dogs shutout Zahm 8-0 in a Medium Dorm League game. 
In the Parseghian Large Dorm League, the traditional upper crust seems to be falter­ing. After battling to a score­less tie last week, both Morris­sey and Flanner expected to have an easier time this week. However, both teams were sent to the bottom of the standings with losses, Dillon defeating Morrissey 7-0, and Keenan downing Flanner 7-6. In the third and final game in the League, the Crime of Off­Campus tied Grace 0-0.

Lyons takes lead 1n IH action 
By JEFF HEILERT Sports Writer 
What's the difference be­tween the letters I and T? 
Ask Lyons Hall. That differ­ence gave them sole possession of first place in the women's interhall football standings after Sunday's action. 

Both Farley and Lyons en­tered the contest undefeated, but an hour later Lyons walked away with a 6-0 victory. 
Using a T-formation back­field throughout the game, Lyons' running backs ap­peared to be a step away from busting a big run. With under two minutes remaining to play, Lyons' offensive coach, Matt Roy, switched to an !­formation backfield. Tailback Robin McHugh responded by scrambling 83 yards down the left sideline for the winning score. 
"All night long, it seemed that Robin was only a step away from the big play," said Roy. "Switching to the !­formation gave her an extra two steps, and that's all she needed." 
Although McHugh scored the winning points, her teammates on defense secured the victory. 
"I have to thank defensive coach· Mario Pelicano," said Roy. "The defense hasn't al­lowed a single point this year, and qas five interceptions. Most of our defense has two or three years of experience. Now they not only know where to be, but have started to read quar­terbacks. The experience really helps." 
A key defensive figure in Sun­day night's win was Cari Mar­tinez, who collected her third and fourth interceptions of the year to contribute to Lyons' shutout. 
The defense was also helped 
by the Farley offense, which 
hurt itself with penalties. Four 
Farley first downs were called 
back by illegal block calls, the 
last one nullifying a pass com­
pletion to Lyons' nine-yard 
line. 
Lyons will have a tough bat­
tle Thursday to keep sole pos­
session of first place. It faces 
Breen-Phillips, which is com­
ing off a big win last Sunday 
over Pasquerilla East. 
The Irish have not lost an overtime game in over two seasons, and in 35 overtime matches in its history, Notre Dame has lost just four. 
Notre Dame needed a victory over Bowling Green to hold on to its No. 3 ranking in the Great Lakes region. The Falcons en­tered the game with a 7-1-0 record and a No. 4 ranking in the region. 
Mter a scoreless first half of a kick-and-run game, the Fal­cons struck first at the 62: 13 mark when Steve Alveric stole an outlet pass by Irish keeper Danny Lyons. Alveric sent a bouncing shot over Lyons' shoulder into the net. 
Notre Dame answered six minutes later when forward Bruce "Tiger" McCourt knocked a perfect crossing pass by Morris just under the crossbar. McCourt's goal was his sixth goal in the last six games, and Morris, with two assists on the night, increased his team-leading total to 11. 
With 13 minutes left in regulation time Bowling Green had an excellent chance when Ron Haines blasted a shot off Lyons' chest. Lyons then saved the shot off the rebound to relieve the pressure. 
In the final eight minutes the Irish had several excellent chances as McCourt sent an­other perfect feed from Morris over the crossbar, and Sternberg was stopped by Fal­con keeper Mickey Loescher. 
Mter only managing one shot the entire first half, Notre Dame recorded 10 shots on goal the second half. 
Sternberg's game-winner midway through the 20-minute overtime came after several other missed opportunities by the Irish. Despite the letdown 
at the end, Notre Dame held on to continue its winning ways. 
The overtime, coupled with several other delays, caused the game to last almost three hours. · 
Baseball only excitement left 
I was going to write about the NFL strike and how ridiculous the whole situation is. 
But my feelings on the matter are quite simple -the owners are trying to play bully while the players are over­reacting, thus creating the soon-to-arrive Scab Sunday. I usually reserve Sunday afternoons for blowing off homework and watching the pros play football. But this Sunday the real action will be in St. Louis and Detroit, as the major league baseball season winds down and the pennant races are settled. 
The division titles of the AL West and NL West are already decided. The Minnesota Twins ended a seventeen-

year drought Monday night by clinching their first division title since the days of Tony Oliva and Harmon Killebrew, who could crush the ball a true country mile. 
I've never seen so much Minnesota Twins paraphernalia on campus as I have in the past few days. A little dusty and smelling like mothballs, mind you, but its out there. 
So what if they won the division with a lowly .541 winning percentage, and every other AL West team has a sub-.500 record. 
Then we have the San Francisco Giants out there in the National League West. They clinched late Monday night in a 5-4 victory over the mighty San Diego Padres, who will wind up losing over 95 games this year and were mathematically eliminated around the All-Star Game I think. 
Just a fun fact that also contributed to the Giants' title -no NL West team had a winning record for the three months of June, July and August. I guess they put too much time into following the Iran-Contra affair. So three cheers for the Twins and Giants, who had both better celebrate now because the winners of the East will prob­ably be in the World Series come mid-October. 
In the AL and NL East divisions, the next five days are what the whole term pennant race is all about. The top contenders battling head-to-head on the last weekend of the season to determine the divisional champion. 
The American League East race is simple -Detroit vs. Toronto for the title, the U.S. vs. Canada for bragging rights, Alan Trammell vs. George Bell for the A.L. Most Valuable Player. The days -October 2, 3, 4. The site -Tiger Stadium. Winner takes all. 
With the Blue Jays up one-and-a-half games after last night's action, they still hold the edge, especially after taking three of four games last weekend from the Tigers in Toronto. Detroit will have an easier time in the days leading up to the battle, facing Baltimore at home while the Jays host third-place Milwaukee. So they could come in fairly even, in which case Detroit will have the advan­
