Fritz Hoefer, Executive Coordinator of the Hall Presidents Coqncil, announced at last night's HPC meeting a tentative itinerary for the up­coming An Tostal weekend. 
Hoefer, the chairman of An Tostal, told the Presidents that the weekend will be run in a similiar fashion to last year's extremely successful one. As in the past, the weekend will begin with a balloon launch on Thur­sday afternoon April 29; and will continue through an outdoor blues concert sponsored by the Contemporary Arts Festival behind· Stepan Center on Saturday night. Highlighting the weekend will be such popular events as the kissing marathon, the pig chase, and tug of war, and basketball and football games between NOtre Dame celebrities and teams composed of Saint Mary's students. 
Hoefer informed the Council that there will be an unforseen conflict on the Saturday of An Tostal weekend. Originally Hoefer had been told by the Athletic Department that the annual Blue-Gold intrasquad football game would be held on Saturday, April 24. However, the Executive coordinator stated that he had only recently been

Tostal weekend 

Fritz Hoefer notified of the Athletic Depart­ment's decision to change the date of the game to May I, the Saturday of An Tostal weekend. Hoefer explained that the conflict could not be avoided at this late date, because he had already entered into numerous con­tractual obligations. Hall Life Board Session In other business, Student Body President-elect John Barkett repeated his written an­nouncement to the presidents in which he plans to suggest to the Student Life Council that they reduce their size by one half. He asked the Presidents for suggestions. and received no objections. After the · meeting, a short session of the Hall Life Board was held, to explain its purpose to the Hall Presidents. Bob Galgan, PResident of Dillon Hall, and member of the Hall Life Board, 

·-·--Bob Giilga·n outlined the three point program 
for the board:  
--Approval of  all  Hall  Con­ 
stitutions  
--Assurance  of  effective  Hall  

Governments and Judicial Systems in every Hall. 
--Ov0rseeing the en­vironmental aspects of the hall, with the 'general prupose of improving living conditions, both physical and emotional. 
Galgan, who said he was "unsure of the place of the Hall Life Board in the power structure of the University," views the role of the board optimistically. He hopes to meet with the govern­ments of each hall and discuss the general problems that exist on the hall level. 
The president of Dillon stated that he "does not want the board to be a· board of authority that runs around slapping hands, but rather a board of usefullness and helpfulness."

Bayh 'looking it 
PORTLAND, Ore. (UPI) ­Sen. Birch Bayh, D.-Ind., said here Saturday that he felt Sen. George McGovern, D.-8.D., was right in announcing his can­didacy for president so early. 
But Bayh, who is considered as one of the likely Democratic presidential candidates, added that he and other potential nominees are still feeling the effects of a divided party. 
Bayh said he doesn't "think a grass roots ground swell for me 
or  for  anyone  else  in  the ·  
Democratic  party  for  the  
presidency."  

However, he said that "if I choose to run, I want to be sure 
Calley verdict 
Continued from page 1 
Another car driven by an MP followed the Calley vehicle. 
Across the street from the courthouse, a crowd of about 100 persons had gathered. 
As Calley's car sped away, one woman yelled out, "We are with you all the way, Calley." 
Calley is confined at the post stockade. He will be held there until the sentencing procedure is concluded, emerging only for the court's sessions. He will be treated as an officer, quartered and fed separately from enlisted men. 
No Witnesses 

Latimer said he would call no witnesses in mitigation of sen­tence when court reconvenes for the sentencing phase of the trial at 1 p.m. Tuesday. 
The prosecutor in the Calley case, Aubrey M. Daniel III, refused comment on the verdict, as did the trial judge, Col. Reid 
W. Kennedy. 
The defendant's attractive red haired girl friend, Ann Moore, dabbed at her eyes with a han­dkerchief after the verdict was read. 
Calley did not break down, and his attorneys later agreed that he had "prepared himself for the worst" while hoping for the best.

Bayh met here with Democratic precinct workers over the weekend and also ad­dressed a Democratic workshop at the Oregon state fairgrounds in Salem. 
At Salem, Bayh criticized alleged spying by the federal government on U.S. citizens. He said the "snoopery" threatens freedom "so dearly bought and preserved." 
Bayh said he feared that rapidly accumulating data banks could be used "to stifle legitimate political dissent." He said that just the existence of such data banks threatens individual liberty. 
The Hoosier Democrat also said wage and profit control measures should be used to halt inflation if voluntary programs fail to do the job. 
He told the Oregon Democrats he expects inflation to continue throughout the coming year. 
Bayh also urged full voting rights for the nation's young people

Tlte SLC: What A ~~ess, 
Dig this: 

The SLC ·the distinguished Student Life Council, thz highest and most important board of decisionmakers yet inhabited by students, spent fourty-five minutes attempting to decide whether or not they had voted on Chris Ottenweller's motion two weeks ago or whether they had voted on a motion to vote on Chris Ottenweller's motion. Fourty-five minutes! They finally -through deliberations far too complex to relate here -determined that they had indeed voted last meeting to vote on Chris Ottenweller's motion. This meeting, then, they voted on Chris Ottenweller's motion. Let history note that the vote on Ottenweller's motion was not substantively different from the vote to vote on Ottenweller's motion. 
This was one of the SLC's more productive meetings. The SLC finally did resolve the Sophomore Car hassle. It only took them a year to hash out the rules to park a hundred-odd extra cars, and yesterday was the culminating day of glory. Unfortunately, the former incident was more typical of the SLC this political season than the latter. The SLC this past year has been loaded with bizzarre parlimentary dodges, self-defeating debates, and general illucidity, cupidity, and stupidity. 
It was tragic that the SLC behaved in such a manner this year, because such behavior abrogated the dignity of an important body. It will be more than tragic if next year's SLC behaves similarly. For next year this University must make its most important moves towards coeducation; it is more than imperitive that the SLC assure that student opinion is represented in these moves. 
What ean be done? Of course, the old promises of researehilng bills, and researching them thoroughly have to all be renewed. But more than that, the curious and pervasive chord of hate and disharmony has to be ter­minated.. This year, representatives of the student body, the faculty, and the administration, thought of themselves as members of the organizations they represent. Next year, they must think of themselves as members of the SLC, committed to deal for the school as a whole. For next year, it won't be the student body, the faculty, or the administration that's on the line. It'll be the SLC as a whole. 

The following is a letter written by Prof. Michael Hinkemeyer to SMC Education Chairman Eugene Campanale. 

Dear Mr. Campanale, 
Now that I have received from the college a major satisfaction that I have sought in my case, I feel that it is time to turn to perhaps more important issues. 
As you know, recent revelations of racial prejudice here at the college cannot but trouble those of us who are of good will toward all elements of the community and society. I remind you, in this regard, that it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated to me that my non­renewal was not for religious 
reasons. Education ought to hire at least one black, and one non-Catholic,

All's Fair ... 
Don looked at his Girl Friend cautiously. His head moved around, analyzing the situation carefully. He must be clever, for his new Girl Friend had a prudish reputation, and a great body. Musn't make the ''move'' to hastily. One might miss the big opportunity. 
The setting was great. They were alone at her house, no parents or annoying siblings. He knew she felt something for him; she had said so the last time they met. He concentrated on making himself look sin­cerely in love. He paused to think of the right tactic to use. He decided to try the "I'm Not Glib, But Here's How I Feel" Approach. A brief introduction was followed by the key phrase, "I love you." That, thought Don, is the crux of the matter...if she believes that, the hardest 
part is over. 
Major Siegen looked at his radar screen in a storm of mixed emotions. An Enemy Transport had materialized on his radar screen. It was a beautiful target --except for one fact, it was flying over the territory of a supposedly neutral country. Major Siegen cursed the orders that prevented him from crossing the border to shoot it down. 
The radio crackled just as he was about to give up the useless temptation and fly away. The voice was in the Enemy's language. "This is Transport 645, our navigation equipment is malfunctioning, request guidance instructions, please". · 
Major Siegen's mouth watered. If he remembered correctly there weren't any Enemy bases within range ofthe Transport. A daring idea flashed into his skull. He adjusted his radio transmitter to the tran­sport's frequency. "This is ground control, we have you on our screen. Change your course sixty degrees to your right and you will be headed straight for our base," said the Major fluently in the Enemy language. 
Don continued his lines. After an initial scepticism he finally jubilantly saw that she had believed him. How stupid must she be to believe his silly lies. Yet, he congratulated himself on his shrewd 
acting ability. 
Major Siegen rejoiced. The Transport was finally turning. What fools they were to accept his charade. "Deception," he thought, "is one of the prime principles of warfare. One must expect lies as well as bullets from one's Enemy. Sure deception is lousy, but then war is a lousy business. If the Enemy is going to kill you, you must take ad­vantage of everything to stop him. We're at war, not playing with friends." 
Don locked his arms around his Girl Friend. Sensing her tem­perament with a veteran skill, he waited for the proper moment to ask the Big Question. She evaded and hedged but he pursued the attack. At last she relented, saying, "After all we're in love, aren't we?" 
The Transport had crossed the border. Major Siegen maneuvered quickly behind her. Too late, the transport tried .to escape. But the ace Major easily matched her little tricks with an expert pursuit. 
Close as he could get with his girl friend, Don enjoyed the fruits of his labor. 
Major Siegen savored in the delight of the kill. From beneath his fighter, a Sidewinder missile flew, speading towards the Transport. Its long pointed form homed in on her. With a final quick motion, it slid ttp her tailpipe. A second later it exploded deep inside its victim. 
Afterwards, as his roomate admiringly commented on the skill of Don's seduction, Don thought of searching out a new Girl Firend. Suddenly a pang of conscience struck him. It was soon dismissed as he said to himself "All's fair in love and war."

on America, the war, 

As of three o'clock yesterday afternoon, this page was blank, with no prospects of being immediately filled with truth, beauty, knowledge, or anything at all, for that matter. Mter a moment's con­templation, it was decided that to do the big picture at the bottom with a caption on top thing wouldn't work, too soon since the last one. So the only other alternative which presented itself was the interview with some neat person. Which led me to the sacred portals of the noted rector of Keenan Hall.
0 of patriotism,great men and tragic errors 
Reverend Robert Griffin, C.S.C. had just returned from a six thousand mile trip with the Fighting Irish Glee Club across the western parts of this country. So the first part of the conversation was sort of centered around that experience, with other various topics being related to it. 
Such as patriotism. "One of the things that kind of bothered me was when someone asked that we sing 'God Bless America'. Certainly no one had any qualms about asking God to bless America. The thing that struck me was that too often today this kind of thing is used as a kind of touchstone, almost as though you are exacting a loyalty oath from someone. There seems to be some forgetfulness among some American Catholics. It's very sad. There are loyalties above the loyalties to one's country. 
"One is very much struck by the beauty of the country. All kinds of religious sentiments come oozing up from the soul. You get the feeling that it must have taken some very great men to cross the desert and the mountains. It's one thing to drive along the road knowing that there is a Stuckey's a mile away, where they have hot and cold running water and milk shakes available. So to see America is certainly something which calls forth sentiments of patriotism. At the same time you realize that there have been some tragic errors, such as the war that continues to go on and on. Saturday I learned of the death of a friend of mine who died of cancer. There was also the mother of a boy here who died of cancer over the break. When people are dying of something as horrendous as cancer at such early ages while billions and billions are being spent in armaments and defense without logical reason ..." 
0 of th~ berrigans, crucifixion & loud sounding barrels 
I asked Griff about possible actions which could 
be taken by those who found themselves opposed to 
the war. 
"This, of course, is the great question. I find more and more fellows seeking C.O. classifications. This is something you can do when you are young. When you become older it is difficult to know what to do. This, I suppose is the reason that the Berrigans are such a reproach to the conscience of the country. When you see the things they do, you think to yourself, maybe there is some great inner logic in what they are doing and a great inconsistency in that you too should be doing the same thing. I suppose what all of us want to do is to have the appearance of doing courageous things without ever really become involved in risking oneself. It's a very easy thing to do, for example, to go into the chapel and preach a sermon against the war. Some people resist you and other people who are already convinced of the foolishness of war-I guess everybody is convinced of it. I hope they are. You may not have persuaded anyone, or maybe a few. 
The fact is that you can become hyper-excited 

being Christian, et a/. 
over this and make impassioned speeches, write impassioned letters to editors. It's not really going to be any great skin off your nose to do it. I think this is what must have happened with the Berrigans. They would see kids taking courageous stances and they felt the need to somehow show witness to the foolishness to what is happening. It's been said many times that the best way to found a new religion is to get yourself crucified and to rise again in three days. I'm not sure about the resurrection, but the crucifixion is the thing that gave credence to the teachings of our Lord and indicates the intensity of his convictions--an idea for which a man will die. These are the principles by which he will live. If you are deeply enough into something, you are going to have to be willing to take a risk. This is the kind of feeling, the kind of fear that I have--that maybe I encourage people to do something which will cause 
them to risk themselves, with me nothing more than a loud sounding barrel . . . 
0 of tim mccarry, guilt & apathy 
"This is why I was so touched by Tim McCarry. Here was I at this University and here was this kid at this University. You may say many things about Notre Dame, but a lot of people--pacifists, people who have a rather enlightened view of things--they have spent four years here. They sometimes come to an insight about the place that it is sad and that it is lacking. But none of them came here with this awareness. It is through the books they read, the people who taught them that provided a situation whereby they could come to a judgment about Notre Dame. So here was this boy who had been here for four years and whose conscience had been formed · in such a way that he was very much opposed to the war and he felt he had to do something. So he went over to the Administration Building and placed himself in the way of the Dow Chemical recruiters. As a result of it, he gets arrested. It's a case of a house being divided against itself. I think this is very true of Notre Dame. A boy's conscience is so exquisitely formed and he has taken the Christian religion as people here have taught him and he tries to follow it out. Things seem very bad and as a consequence of this witness and of the things he does. he is arrested. There must be a bett~r way. 
"I wonder. I have no idea what his thinking or mentality was. But when somebody kills himself, and he has been in a place like this, I think that there must be questions in everyone's mind. I haven't heard it asked. But the question must occur about the guilt we share in this. I don't want to sentimentalize or idealize. But he must have been a very sensitive oerson." 
Continuing in the same vein, I talked about how people here and everywhere seem so apathetic, to use a by now trite term, and how no one seems willing to become involved, to be trite again. Why? 
"This is certainly not an easy question to answer. I don't know. This isn't to answer your question directly, but I don't get frightened by kids who have fierce convictions and fierce ideals and who are militant and demanding. Maybe I would if ·they kidnapped me. It is a fact that this kind of fierceness and committment is lost too soon. Too early begins the compromise with the world. This has charac­terized the Church. It has characterized many who want to share in the so-called good life of America. One might be involved in the student strike or inner city activities or something like that for a while. But as you grow older, you realize that you want to become a junior member of the firm and to own a. house in the country. They conform. That's the period I worry about. They cool. In the name of a job or the family, I can understand that a man wants to provide for the family. But I am saddened that it so often involves the death of the most beautiful ideals. It is the same way in the priesthood. When you are ordained, you are going to change the world. 
0 of 'in causes', losing one's humanity & weariness 
"I think that many kids come from comfortable homes and are used to the comforts of home. The difficult thing is that many kids will be anti-war. But once they have found that they have the draft behind them, that theywon't be drafted, they stop caring about it. 
"One of the things I have noted over the years is the 'in cause' of the moment. One point is civil rights. Then it is war. Right now it seems to be ecology. It seems that the 'in cause' leaves too many unfinished causes, the war is one of them .... people should return their hands to the 
unfinished task." We then went on to discuss the 'death' of the peace movement and the relationship between that and the fact that many people felt that if anything _at all was accomplished, it was not enough. "I know that there reaches a point where you seem to be in utter weariness of saying anything against the war. It's all been said, the documen­tation has all been presented, one has called at­tention to every atrocity that was possible. At the same time, when you allow yourself to be worn out. the other side wins. Maybe we have reached the time for decent people to make an appeal to other decent people who might be at the point of being discouraged, of being thereby open. I don't think the answer is to give up. I think you have to keep hammering and hammering. Otherwise the other guys think they have won, or something." The discussion then proceeded into what could be called a more social realm. I made mention of my own fears of becoming something less than human through too great a devotion to a cause -reaching the point where the ideology or the cause I support becomes more important than the people whom I pretend to be liberating. Something along the lines of that old adage 'to liberate you I must burn your village or even kill you.' How, then, to retain one's humanity and concern for one's brothers and sisters while fighting the oppressor. "It requires a tremendous sensitivity to really realize that other people are human beings. It's something we all say, a kind of concept. It involves the ability to put ourselves into the other person's boots. The ability to imagine to some degree what he is suffering. The larger the group involved, the harder it becomes. What is it like to be a Viet­namese peasant. Or to be Richard Nixon. Certainly Richard Nixon is not a bad man. A dull man, but not a bad man. We all realize that we are human in unattractive ways. It is difficult to maintain a commonsensitivity at a mass level. It is true that wars are carried on in the name of justice. Another nation must be punished. It seems that some people are willing to carry the inflicting of · justice to doomsday. The national pride is wounded and therefore we must go rushing in. It seems thwt when a country goes to war it feels that for the sake of winning, a great many values can be pushed aside. 
0of inflicting justice, 
embarrassment,& Christ 
It's no one's personal sin, it's no one's personal shame, it's no one's personal responsibility. Looking at the goals and not the means ... 
"I think I should burn that tape. 
Not wi~hi~g to dwell overly long on the subject, I asked Gnff If he could expand on certain comments he made at a Mass just prior to break. The comment ~ rem~mbered most clearly went something like, 
Jesus IS what you make him,' which probably casts an inaccurate light on the homily, but that's about all I could remember. 
"There's nothing more difficult to recall than a sermon once given. 
"We are Christ. We are Christ in the World. Christ has come, He is in us and He is with us. It's very simple. The Christian believes in Christ. his life. his message, the primacy of love in human conduct. He 
believes that Jesus did so love the world that he died for it. So that what one does is to live one's life as a witness to Christ, and to, in a sense be another Christ in the world, being the same Christ. Christ ?oes n_ot belong to a moment of history. He simply IS, He IS present. One can belong to Him. It is with a belief in Christ, in His grace, in His message, in His love that one is His witness and one tries to become His hands, His feet, His person. I think this is what ~hristiall:ity is about. It is sentimental as hell to say It. S~eakmg of religion is an embarrassing thing to do, .m_ casual conversation. As a priest, as a Chnst~an, ~s a human being, I find myself in­teractmg with people on two levels. The first is on the personal level. I hope I would like people even if I were not a priest or Christian even if I had no beliefs whatsoever. I find people'are left cold when they feel ~o~ are concerned about them because you are prachcmg some kind of Christian ethic. People need more of a sense of being cared about, not being ca~e~ about-only because you are practicing your rehgwn. When one is a Christian one is a child of God, one has the office of maintaining the attitude toward life which is like that of Christ in which there is this concern, that His love, His c'oncern for 
the downtrodden for the little guy was very genuihe. If one feels one is a Christian one has a similar concern. That is what moves us in Scripture. This is wha~ Christ left us to do. This may not be very tangible. One has a particular commitment to Christ."

Tenure; or Old Teachers Never Die 
Today let us discuss tenure, an academic custom which stipulates that if a college doesn't fire a teacher fast enough, they are stuck with him forever. 
The rules of tenure vary from campus to campus, but in general, a teacher gets tenure when he reaches the rank of associate professor or, failing that, when he completes eight years on the faculty. There­after, he cannot be fired except for two rigidly defined causes: a) if he is habitually nude during lectures; or b) if the college can prove he has been dead for more than one semester. 
Small wondler, then, that colleges are so careful about granting tenure. Who wants to be saddled with a dull teacher for the rest of his lumpish life? For-let us speak frankly-e'l(en among a group as glit­tering as teachers, you will find an occasional deadhead. Take, for ex­ample, Ralph J. Stagnant. 
Mr. Stagna111t was not only dull, he was stupefying. Believe me, I would never say such a mean thing, true though it is, if he were a sensi­tive man, but he is riot. In fact, if you want an example of how insensi­tive he is, he wrote his entire Ph. D. thesis on a chair that had a nail 
sticking through the seat. And if you want further evidence of his dullness, the thesis was called "The Dynamics of Luggage." 
But even so, the academic job market was booming at the time Mr. Stagnant got his doctorate, and he soon found employment. What's more, by blending with the ivy and always walking on tiptoe, he managed never to attract the Dean's attention and thus got rehired 
every year. 

But finally came Year No.8, and Mr. Stagnant knew his luck had run out. This time rehiring would mean tenure and naturally the Dean would first take a good hard look. How, thought Mr. Stagnant with a sinking heart, could he persuade the Dean he was worth keeping? 
Well sir, as everyone knows, the way to impress Deans is to pub­lish books. So Mr. Stagnant, who thus far had been too sluggish even to attempt a book, now began turning them out at a frantic rate­The Foot Locker Through History . ..Valise and the Single Girl . .. My Satchel, Right or Wrong. Alas, the publisher rejected them all. 
Finally, in desperation, Mr. Stagnant tried a novel, but this fared no better. "We are herewith returning your cornball novel," wrote the publisher. "Are you kidding with this stuff? Can you seriously believe that in this modern day and age anybody would want to read a tear­jerker about a rich Harvard boy who marries a poor Radcliffe girl who dies of leukemia?" 
And so, alas, Mr. Stagnant was fired. Today, a broken man, he lives in a New Orleans slum, working part-time as a praline. 
There is a powerful lesson here for all of us: if you want tenure, don't be dull. 

Take, for instance, Miller High Lif.e Beer. Do you think that if Miller had been dull, it would have enjoyed a tenure of 115 years so far? Of course not. Miller abides because it is the very opposite of dull; it is lively, sparkling, vivacious, animated, sprightly, buoyant, spry, ardent, sportive and waggish. Just pour a Miller and the hills are alive with the sound of music, and there's a bright golden haze on the mead­ow, and every cloud has a silver lining, and zing! go the strings of your heart. 
Perhaps you think I'm being a bit effusive about Miller High Life. If you do, I ask you to remember one thing: to me Miller is more than just a beer; it is also an employer. 
* * 
It's true. We, the brewers of Miller High Life, bring you this column every week, sometimes nervously. And every day, always confidently, we bring you Miller High Life. I! you've got the time, we've got the beer, in cans, bottles and kegs-and all ways delicious.

Who are you? You are John Hessler quietly reading poetry. You are Charley Blum drunk after a rugby game. You are one of my room­mates laughing at my Hoosier accent. You are Rich Hunter running wildly through the Interhall Office. You are all my pre-med friends who made it with me through Hofman, Thorson, Freeman, and Bretthauer. You are Austin Carr shaking my hand and saying thanks for some "good ink" on the sports page. You are a hometown honey who found someone else or a St. Mary's girl who did the same. You are Notre Dame. I must say it--corny or not-I consider myself lucky to be here and I love the place. 
I want to especially thank Terry Shields for giving me the chance to write for this paper. My mother always said I was a frustrated sportswriter. Surely this whole campus should be thankful to Terry Shields. In his four years on the Observer, Terry has written more words read by NO students than any other man in this school's history. He has worked very hard in providing this sports-minded school with a first-class sports page. He has done a tremendous job. 
From my experience as a fan and reporter of Notre Dame sports, I have learned one lesson. Refuting Vince Lombardi and others, I would like to propose that winning is not everything. It is important as a means but not as an end. The only thing that can be expected of an atlete is that he does his best to win. Losing is not to be considered as failure but only as an inspiration to do better the next time. Every Notre Dame team I have ever watched in any sport thought about only one thing during a game--that is, winning. Of course, the Irish didn't always win, but they did their best to. And as long as Notre Dame men stand for that, I'll stand behind Notre Dame. 
There have been many thrilling moments. My greatest thrill came in Dallas on the first day of 1970. The Irish had just lost the most ex­citing football game I have ever seen. My friends and I were walking into the Aldophus Hotel in downtown Dallas following the game. I was the last one through the door. In the corner of the hotel lobby was a cute ·American Airlines stewardess. 
"Are y'all from Notre Dame?" she asked. 
"Yes," I said proudly. 
"That's a very good school," she replied with a smile. 
All I could say was, "Thank you." 

DeCicco explains tourney 
by Joe Passiatore Observer Sportswriter 
' 
With the International Fencing Tournament only ten days away, Notre Dame fencing coach and 
, tournament host, Mike DeCicco, has his hands full. Coach DeCicco has gone to great lengths. to insure that contestants from . the 22 participating countries will be well received. 
An "En Garde " luncheon will be held at the Athletic and Convocation Center in the monogram room. Tickets may be purchased through the South Bend-Mishawaka Chamber of Commerce. In addition to par­ticipants and officials being present, Coach DeCicco is hoping to have such notables as Representative John Brademas, and Frs. Hesburgh and Burt­chaell in attendance. 
Coach DeCicco expressed the hope that Notre Dame students would be hospitable and extend the courtesies of the campus to the foreign visitors. "We have several families in South Bend who are going to greet teams of their nationality and have a get­together to make them feel welcome. If we could get some students involved in this tour­nament it would really be tremendous. We need students for scorers, time keepers, tourist guides, and people who speak foreign languages." Anyone interested should contact coach DeCicco at 283-8356. 
All contestants are under 21 and there will be three divisions (epee, foil, and sabre) for the men and competition in the foil weapon for the women. Action is scheduled between Friday, April 9, and Monday, April 12, in the a documentary of the meet with
