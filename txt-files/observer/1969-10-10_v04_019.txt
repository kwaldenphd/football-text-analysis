Student Government Investigating 
Senate elections held: two disputed
by Tim Trainer 
and John DiCola The Student Senate survived an allegation of fraud in Cavanaugh Hall, and Keenan hall's refusal to submit its ballot box to Student Senate inspection to elect forty-five members to this year's edition of the Senate. Included among those elected were Free University head Rick Libowitz, along with Mark Zimmerman and James De Sapio, the brothers of two prominant campus political figures. Libowitz headed a list of seven off-campus candidates contending for the five senate seats. Lihowitz collected 85 votes or about 17% of the total vote. Runner-up Carl Rak received 68 out of the total 395 votes. In an upset, write-in candidate Dave Loring received 56 votes to join James De Sapio as Keenan's hall senators. Loring received fifty-six votes, seventy-five less than De Sapio but sixteen more than write-in John Kahl and eighteen more than the next candidate on the ballot, Dick O'Connor. Keenan hall president Tim Mahoney refused, however, to submit the results of the election to the Senate election committee. In striking a blow for what he termed "hall autonomy," Mahoney replaced the student government lock with one of the hall's. He refused to allow the ballot box to be op,.ned, but he did return it with the Keenan Hall lock still on it to the election committee. 
Committee head John 

Zimmerman broke the lock with 
a hammer, then counted and 
validated the result. Mahoney 
was unavailable for comment on 
the election committee's action. 
Zimmerman's brother Mark 
handily won a seat from Dillon 

Hall. Zimmerman collected 85 
to Sam Rumore's 84 and 
write-in candidate Ed Gather's 
14. Two are elected from Dillon. 

Write-in Phil White nearly pulled off a similar upset in Alumni Hall. He came within three votes of topping vote leader Richard Tarrier and within two votes of edging Don Mooney and winning a post on the Senate. The vote in an extremely close race was Tarrier 78, Mooney 77, and White 76. 
The winning candidates blameu White's high vote on the nature of their campaign. Alumni hall, which ~s two senators, had only two candidates on the ballot. Tarrier and Mooney characterized their campaigns as "low-key," and explained that low-key campaign in terms of lack of visible opposition. 
According to Tarrier, White did not actively court votes until Wednesday. Mooney called White's candidacy a "joke," and said that his apparent success was a result of voters "not taking the elections seriously." White was unavailable for comment. 
One of the most controversial elections was held in Cavanaugh Hall, where write-in Ed Crawford soundly defeated balloted opponents John L.

THE SENIOR CLASS PRESENTS MEMBERS OF THE INDIANA STATE DRAFT BOARD AND THE COLLEGE ADVISORY BOARD IN A DISCUSSION • QUESTION SESSION ON THE SELECTIVE SERVICE SYSTEM ''COME AND VOICE YOUR OPINION'' 4:00 PM OCT 10 LIBRARY AUDITORIUM  Statement urges against neutrality The undersigned members of the Theology Faculty and the Graduate Theological Union welcome the statement of University policy on the observance of the Vietnam Moratorium Day, October 15, released by the Vice-President of Academic Affairs. We wish, however, to express our disappointment that the University, in its first official statement with regard to this matter, did not take a positive stand condemning the Vietnam War and fully supporting the intentions of the Moratorium. As the President of this University has often emphasized in the past, there are issues of basic human concern on which the University in general, and a Catholic University in particular, is not permitted to take a merely neutral stand. The time has definitely come, with regard to the Vietnam War when a Christian conscience, informed by the teachings of the Church, e.g. the Pastoral Constitution on "The Church in the Modern World" and the encyclical "Peace on Earth," should have gained clarity concerning the immorality of any continuance of this war. A positive statement of Christian morality is not, in fact, "tantamount to forcing participation in a protest on some who, in conscience, hold other views." We further wish to express our full approval of the statement of the Theology Majors concerning the apathy and complacency of the University community towards the War in Vietnam (cf.

Moratorium exams 
The Observer has been approached by a number of students who want LIS to confirm or deny reports that certain professors are scheduling tests for next Wednesday, the day of the Vietnam Moratorium. 
It would take an endless amount of time to check out each of the rumors. We hope that there is no substance to them, for if they are true it would be a sorry indictment of the state of the freedom of academic pursuit and dissent at Notre Dame. 
Any professor who because of his opposition to the Moratorium deliberately schedules a test for next Wednesday would be surcoming to an insanity which is characteristic of both the far left and the far right. 
The attitude which sets out to stifle differences of opinion, free discussion of an issue, or legitimate protest through the use of pressure tactics is a vestige of a mentality which has its roots in the Middle Ages. The first Universities pointed out the tactic's futility as well as its unreasonableness. Unfortunately its practice has carried over to today's society. It exists not because of its merits but because it is a manifestation of a basic human fault-the egotism which blinds a man to the fact that he is not always right. 
We feel that there is no room for the use of pressure tactics at a great university. Free discussion, unrestricted inquiry, and the freedom to manifest the beliefs of one's conscience through legitimate means, should be characteristic of everything that happens at Notre Dame. 
It is with this in mind that we called for the application of the true academic spirit in all events that transpire next Wednesday. We call for participants in the Moratorium to govern their actions with respect for the rights of individuals who will attend classes that day. We call for professors to respect the moral convictions of students who wish to participate in the moratorium by not scheduling tests or quizzes for that day. 
The argument will always be made that to not schedule tests on Wednesday would be to allow outside influences (the Moratorium) to affect the normal pursuits of the University. We believe not. One of the characters of a truly admirable curriculum is that is is flexible enough to provide for the examination of pressing topics which students are concerned with at the time of their concern. 
A lot of students are restless about the war. It makes no sense to add to 
that  restlessness  by stifling students' opportunities  to  participate in  the  
Moratorium.  
Employee's rights  

A group of University employees have issued an anonymous statement through WSND expressing their dissatisfaction with Father Walsh's statement about the Moratorium. 
The fact that the University failed to say anything about their being able to participate in the day's activities has annoyed them. Spohsmen for the group claim that the lack of any statement about their perogatives on Wednesday suggests that they do not have a moral right to follow the dictates of their consciences. Or rather, that the consciences of the faculty, students and administrators are more important than theirs. 
We feel that Father Walsh's statement fails to mention employees for the simple fact that he felt that a ruling about them was out of his jurisdiction. He had no right to issue a statement about whether they could take the day off. 
The decision to grant leaves of absence without penalty (namely a cut in pay) to University employees lies with the Vice-President for Business Affairs Father Jerome Wilson. SBP Phil McKenna approached Father Wilson yesterday to see whether he would issue a statement for the employees. 
According to McKenna, Father Wilson stated that obviously there would be no loss in pay for employees who are on monthly or other types of salaries. The problem is with employees who work on an hourly wage. He said that he felt he should consult with Father Hesburgh before making a decision. 
The Vietnam Moratorium is basically a protest. People who participate in it have to assume responsibilities for their actions. In tlte case of students and professors who are going to administer exams, we believe that giving an exam on the 15th is not really necessary. However, if a professor found that there is no other day available he would have no choice to administer it and the student would have to take the consequences if he decided to skip it. 
The case of employees is different in the sense that the University can not afford to grant them the day off with pay, without seriously inhibiting its ability to continue the educational process. We can sympathise with the employees feelings but understand the University's present position; but protest is never an easy thing.

'People's Boat' 
Item: Dispute still rages over who discovered America. 

We are rapidly nearing the Silly Stuff season. Not Hallowee1; (although the month is right), nor Election Day; not even Homecoming weekend. We are nearing Columbus Day, the time when white-thatched scholars come down from their ivy-encrusted towers and try to strangle each other arguing about who really discovered America. 
Of course, the Italians have long claimed Christopher Columbus, a Marrano sailing under the flag of Spain, to be the true "Admiral of the Ocean Sea." At the same time, the Danes look to Leif Ericson's Vinland discovery in the year 1000 as ample proof that their Viking forbears deserve the credit. 
In recent yeats however, new claimants have sprung up as researchers unearth more and more data about some of the intrepid heroes of the past. 
Study at Hong Kong's Queen's College has found that in the year 835 B.C.E., the Chinese philosopher Foo Ahn Yu claimed to have had the vision of a new world, a land where the most humble village streets were lined with jade and the happy, child-like natives harvested plants of unusual medicinal value (when dried, burnt and the smoke inhaled). So excited was the wise man, he raced to the Imperial Palace and told the vision to the entire amazed court. Under direct orders from Emperor Wat Yu Sa, Foo soon arranged an expeditionary party of two ships. Setting sail from present-day Shanghai, Foo headed east, never to be seen or heard from again-conclusive proof that he reached the New World. Recent archeological excavations near the site of the ancient palace have unearthed portions of Foo's cargo list (including three packets of beads and 180 cases of saki) and a map, setting a course which, if followed, would have brought Foo to Tahiti. In honor of this intrepid Oriental, some scholars have called for an annual "Foo-Day", to be observed in the nation's schools and laundries. 
Needless to say, there have been other critics who have arisen to discount the Foo Expedition and stress another, about which they have been studying. Perhaps the most persistant of these counter-claims has been that of several Russian historians. 
The Russians claim that in the year 836 B.C.E. (or 12 months before the Chinese), a burly young comrade named R.U. Foreelsky, having organized all his fellow peasants (this was before the Revolution) into a union protesting the Mongol hordes, felt the call to travel. R.U. knew his work was needed in other places, that other people deserved his aid. Leaving Vladivostok in early May, he dared to cross the great water in his humble bark, named the "Democratic Republican People's Boat". He landed in Alaska, where the Eskimo natives were quick to greet him. The simple people had not even known they were bad off, until Foreelsky arrived to show them how miserable they really were. All went smoothly, until the native chief, Walrus Bottom, caught Foreelsky with his wife Seal Eyes (whom, the report tells us, was " ... built like a brick igloo.") The moralistic Eskimos rebelled and chased the gallant comrade away with rocks. Thus, as well as being the first to the New World, R.U. Forcelsky was. the first Russian to be turned on and stoned. To this very day, he IS remembered by the native people, as his very name has been adopted by the Eskimo language to title certain people who otherwise might have no name at all. ' 
Of course, neither of these claims is accepted hy all. Personally, I 
believe the report that America was discovered by the so-called "Ten 
Lost Tribes". The hearty Israelites left the Near East in the year 
2419 B.C.E. and headed west, until they reached the great water. 
Their leader, one David, then " ...stretched out his rod and parted the 
seas." fie led the Children of Israel across the entire ocean, finally 
coming to a land where their descendants l~e, to th~ day, an area 
known as the Catskills. 

Until such time as the rest of the world accepts this to be fact, 1 
suppose we'll have to go along with celebrating the discovery by 
honoring a man who never saw North America in his life. But, since 
, b we ve een discovered, Happy Columbus Day,.. October 12th...Oh, 1 almost forgot; since the twelfth falls on a Sunday, Columbus Day is 
Lr=-=e=e~ne~y~·~P~ru~d~e~~~w~~-r~~~~-C~o~~~S~t~~~:~~~i~l~~~a~t~z~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'on the 13th this year. Anyone for a party?

But I had observed Ivan, secretly for a long while and did not believe him capable of viole~ce. Nor did I have the means to ward off his attacks if I wanted to. 
Ivan, ignoring all previously-agreed­on-procedures, as well as the Law of the Blips, frantically tried to plug in both lightbulbs at the same lime. But even with both arms fully outstretched he could not, could not quite accomplish the task. Infinite fraction short. II was all so agonizing. I watched.

Within a matter of hours Ivan was sprawled out on the floor of the cave, whimpering in total exhaustion.

But all in all, I think, but I do not know, the relationship among the three of us, I van and I and Chen, is a workable one; if not the best of all possible rela­tionships.

Sen. Goodell speaks today 
U.S. Sen<.ttor Charles c;oodell, the controversial New York Re­publican appointed to the va­cancy left by the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, will speak at the closing session of the Student Union Academic Commission's News Media Conference on Fri­d<.ty, October lOth <.tt3:00 p.m. in Stepan Center. !lis address entitl­ed "Presidential M<.tnagement of the News; Vietnam: A Case in Point," will be held in wnj:mc­tion with the National Student W<.tr Moratorium movement and is open to the public. A question 
Senator (;oodell, considered a t:onserv<.ttive <.tt the time of his <.tppointment by c;overnor Nt:lson Rockefeller, was thl' first Repub­lit:an member of the U.S. Senate to openly and formally oppose the Vietnam policy of the Nixon <.tdministration. Speaking in sup­port of his Vietnam Diseng<.~ge­ment Act, (;oodcll recently told the Senate: "This slaughter must cease. The prosecution of the war with American troops must be ended, not merely reduced." Pro­posing December I, 1970 as <.t mandatory withdrawal date for all U.S. troops in Vietna1n, the Sen<.~ tor went on to point out that his hill "Would end Congress' role as a passive bystander in a war effort directed by thP~e Presi­dents," and "C;ive clear ,.otit:e to the Thieu Covernment of South Vietnam th<.tt at the end of one year, they must assume the full burden of fighting." 
Placing his personal committment to peace above par­tisanship, c;oodell faces possible opposition from Rockefeller, the man who <.tppointed him, in his 
1970 bid for re-election.
