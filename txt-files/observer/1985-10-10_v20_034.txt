Students must utilize every forutn to make their opinions known 
In the past few months I have spent as the assistant Viewpoint editor here at The Observer, it has been my job to read virtually every letter and column that has appeared on the Viewpoint pages. Although these opinions have been written by a large cross section of individuals on campus, many ofthe letters and columns reftec;t the same theme: frustration with the way the administration forces us to live at this University. 
In just the past few weeks, letters ffiled with com­plaints and observations about how the administration treat:> us like children and how that affects our lives have poured into the office. The main issue now is the Dillon tailgater; a few weeks earlier it was the memorial fountain; and, I am sure, a few weeks from now another pressing event will take precedence. 
The letters and columns have been fantastic. They have shown that a greater number of students now, more than ever, care about what is happening around them. General consensus has it that most have been well-written, forceful and have stated a valid point. But what ever comes ofthis? 
It is so frustrating day after day to see a myriad of well­intentioned people take the time to show concern for themselves and their com­munity by expressing an opinion publicly only to have nothing come of their action. Students are making their opinions known, but no one ever listens. 
It's time for someone to begin to listen to the stu­dents of this University. 

It is sad to say that stu­dent~ cannot point to anyone who can takt: their opinions directly to the ad­ministration. We, as students, have no one to represent us. Student government seems to have lost focus of the reason why they were elected. I do not knowwhether it is by choice or by some pressure from the administra­tion they choose to spend their time squabbling over petty issues that conc·ern only student government it­self, such as their budget and elections. Frankly, I don't care. In my mind, they now hold the status of a social events planning commission. 
Until student government is comprised ofa majority ofstudents who want to represent this student body not because it will look good on a resume or because it gives them a feeling of power, we will go on being un­heard. The job is ours. We, as the entire student body, can make a difference. If we cry out as a group to be heard and keep demanding some control over our lives, instead of getting tired and frustrated after a couple of weeks, someone will have to listen. 
Students are rightfully angry when they hear of stu-

dents at other universities who have input into the policy that controls their lives. It is ludicrous to even hope to dictate·policy at this University, but we should at least demand to know why policy is implemented and be able to offer our point ofview. We should not be treated capriciously. 
Maybe we are partly at fault because we do not listen when the administration tries to explain itself. We must compromise. They have to cooperate also, however. There can be no more ivory-tower decisions. It is atro­
cious that the administra­tion virtually ignores the input ofits students. 
More than enough times I have heard people telling ot­hers that if they do not lfk:e Notre Dame, they can "go somewhere else." That statement serves no con­structive purpose. Most of the people here never would leave simply because the students make this place fantastic. But we have an al· ready weak social life fur­ther limited by a plethora of rules and regulations, and the administration is almost tyrannical in disciplining us no matter where we go. Is it so wrong to feel frustrated 
about these situations? 

Ofcourse it isn't. It is wrong, however, ifwe live with the frustration and do nothing about it. We can do something by writing letters not only to The Observer, but to administrators, faculty members and, if the situa­tions calls for it, to alumni and parents. 
We can be heard. 

We can inftuence the image of this school, and the Dillon incident proves that the administration knows that. Let's use that inftuence so that the next time we say we love Notre Dame, we don't have to mean just the people.

Plans for SMC florist continue to take root 

By HELENE GOUDEAU 
News Staff 
Things may be coming up roses at Saint Mary's if plans by faculty and students to re-open a florist on campus are successful. 
The florist shop was closed this year when the shop's owner and College officials decided the shop was not in the best interest of Saint Mary's, according to Saint Mary's Controller and Business Manager jason Lindower.

ness re-opened. They are planning a project to determine the College's needs in this area but have not dis­closed a tentative date for the re­opening yet. 
In order for a florist to operate successfully at Saint Mary's, "There must be significant volume from the formal dances," Lindower said. Be­cause the students' desire to buy flowers varied with the number of dances, the business became un­stable, forcing its termination, Lin­dower said. 
He added that the boutonnieres purchased by Saint Mary's students for dances were less expensive than the corsages purchased at Notre Dame's Irish Garden and did not generate enough revenue to justify the shop's continuation. 
During the SYR and formal season, Lindower said, the shop's owner of­ten lacked the stock necessary to meet the students' needs. Llndower said the College thought the only al­ternative was to close the flower shop. 





Center for Spirituality at SMC will represent the roles of women 
By MARY FRIEL 
News Staff 
The Center for Spirituality at Saint Mary's College hopes some day to become synonymous with the words "women's leadership in the Church," according to Doris Don­nelly, co-director ofthe center. 
Women's leadership has become a hot topic in Church circles, Don­nelly said, citing the American bis­hops promise to attend to this issue and the Pope's claims that he wants women to be active and involved church members in ways fitting the 80s and beyond. 
The Center for Spirituality is taking steps to create a place where women can discuss topics of con­cern for women and men in the con­temporary church, Donnelly said. 
"What's missing from the scene," she said, "is a place where profes­sional Catholic women can get together and brainstorm, listen, plan. Because Saint Mary's never lost its identity as a Catholic women's in­stitution, it's the ideal place for such an ongoing forum." 
During the spring semester, the center is offering a "Booic of the Week Symposium" to be held on Wednesdays in Stapleton Lounge. The symposium will revolve around the theme of "Spiritual Roots." Twelve presenters have been invited to choose acurrent orclassic book written on or about a woman who influenced their spiritual jour­neys and to lead a discussion on their selection. 
Bishop john D'Arcy of the Fort Wayne-South Bend diocese is the guest on April 9. Delores Leckey, Ex­ecutive Secretary of the USCC Bis­hop's Committee on the Laity, will be present on March 19. 
On April 17, Sister Sandra Schneiders, professor of theology at the jesuit theologate in Berkeley, Calif., will deliver the second Madeleva lecture. Her topic will be "Women and the Word: Gender in the New Testament and the Spirituality ofWomen." 
Donnelly received her degrees from Manhattanville College, the University of Southern California and Claremont Graduate School. She taught at Princeton Theological Seminary and St. John's University before coming to Saint Mary's. 


Senate pushes for balanced budget 
WASHINGTON · The Senate, voicing bipartisan anxiety over an accumulated federal debt nearing 12 trillion, voted 75-24 yesterday to force the government to balance its annual budget in six years. 
The Senate then approved and sent to the House a measure to tem­porarily extend the government's borrowing power by $5 billion, a stopgap measure designed to keep the government's checks from bouncing for another week. 
House action on the stopgap measure was expected by day's end. The balanced-budget debate had stalled action in the Republican-led chamber for days on a debt limit ex­tension, exhausting the Treasury's supply ofcash. 
Encouraged by the developments, the Treasury Department an­nounced it would go ahead with an emergency auction to borrow $5 billion to keep the government afloat. 
The auction will provide the government with just enough money to get by for the next few days. 
Approval of the amendment, at the end of a six-day deadlock, cleared the way for action on a separate, short-term hike in the na­tional debt. The interim hike, which also must be approved by the House, would allow Congress to leave for its Columbus Day recess this weekend without threat of the government defaulting on its obligations. 
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said, "We are of course pleased with the margin; we applaud the vote as a step in the right direc­tion." 
"We look forward to final Senate action . . . including a permanent debt extension," Speakes said, ad­ding that the administration hoped for House action "as early as pos­sible" to get the measure to a House­Senate conference committee. 
Government spending would have to match receipts beginning in fiscal year 1991 and remain balanced from then on. The deficit for fiscal 1985, which ended Sept. 30, was about 1210 billion. 


Massachusetts raps public smoking 
Associated Press 
BOSTON-After a lengthy debate over public health and personal liberty, the Massachusetts House gave initial approval Tuesday to a far-reaching series of bans and restrictions on smoking in public. 
As the mingled smoke from cigarettes, pipes and cigars floated up to the domed ceiling of the House chamber, members endorsed the proposal on a roll call of 109-49, including many smokers in the majority. It requires another House vote before going to the Senate. 
"What we are trying to do in this bill is create a presumption of non­smoking in public places," Rep. Cile Hicks, one of the lead sponsors, said during debate. 
If enacted, the bill would create an outright, statewide ban on all tobacco smoking, including cigarettes, cigars and pipes, in elevators, food stores, mass transit, courtrooms and all government meetings. 
It would also ban smoking, except in designated areas, in courthouses, schools and colleges, museums, libraries, trains, airport terminals, hospital lobbies, bingo parlors and all public buildings, including the Statehouse but not the House cham­ber. 
In addition, the proposal would require special sections for smokers in restaurants with 75 or more seats; smaller restaurants would not be af. fected. 
Other provisions would require the state's colleges and universities to provide no-smoking rooms in dormitories and would create no­smoking sections in all nursing homes. 
Owners and managers of build­ings would be responsible for pos­ting appropriate signs, and victims of unauthorized smoking could com­plain in writing to local health of­ficers. An earlier version of the bill included civil fines for violations, but the redraft contained no penalties. 
Rep. Roger Goyette put down his cigar and led the opposition to the bans and restrictions. 
"A lot of people that smoke, smoke because it's a relaxation and, of course, it's a pleasure to them," Goyette said.

Blizzard dumps disaster on West 
Auoclated Preu 
A storm hurled as much as two 
feet of snow across nine states with 
peak winds of 81 mph, closing 
schools and making highways treac­

Dakota grain farmers itwas just anot­
her bad day in a miserable month. 
"It's the same rainy, wet story that .has been told for the last six weeks," 
said Dan Dhuyvetter, Burke County 
agent in Bowbells, N.D. "There is a 
good 50 percent of the grain crop 
left unharvested. 
"We have a lot of standing grain 
and the weight of the snow is start­

Even if we do get some good weat­

leaving quite a bit of crop in the 
fields." 
Travelers' advisories were posted 
in parts of Montana, Wyoming, 
Colorado and Minnesota as well as in North Dakota, where winds up to 35 mph were blowing the snow into drifts Tuesday afternoon. 
The storm, which dropped 25 inches of snow at Shonkin, Mont., and two feet at Mosquito Spring, Idaho, drifted south. Travelers' ad­visories were posted for northeast Nevada and the Lake Tahoe area. Gale warnings were in effect for the western Great Lakes and snow was falling Tuesday afternoon from the northern plains to the central Rockies. 
In northern Utah, where ac­cumulations reached ' 18 inches, roads were clearing Tuesday. The storm, which had peak wind gusts of 81 mph Monday at Rawlins, Wyo., also dusted parts of South Dakota, Oregon and Idaho with snow. 
In Colorado's mountains, skiers were out early at the Berthoud Pass resort to enjoy the fresh snow. 
Record low temperatures were reported in 16 cities from Eugene, Ore., to Montana, with Great Falls, Mont., posting a low of 12 degrees. That knocked 6 degrees off the record for the date set in 1966. 

Cut Bank, Mont., was the nation's ice box Tuesday at 8 degrees. 
In North Dakota, the harvest of spring wheat and durum wheat, al­ready 25 days behind schedule in some areas, was put off again as the storm dumped up to 14 inches of snow in North Dakota. 
"If we had a solid week of good weather we could go out and get it finished," said Robert Carver, direc­tor of the North Dakota Crop and livestock Reporting Service in Fargo. "It's hard to believe we can't do that." 
Snow accumulations ranged up to 14 inches in Sawyer, N.D., a town of 417 just south of Minot. Rain feU in southeastern North Dakota Tuesday morning. 

Hostage's relatives react to killing 
Auoclated Preu 
NEW YORK-A family celebrating the release yesterday of Americans held hostage aboard a hijacked cruise ship was stunned to hear a report that a relative had died during the ordeal. 
Reached at the Manhattan apart­ment of Leon and Marilyn Klinghof­fer, Jerry Arbittier, the couple's son-in-law, said he had not been told his father-in-law had been killed, as Italian Premier Bettino Craxi an­nounced. 
"Has this been confirmed? has it been confirmed?" he asked. He declined other comment, saying he

refused entry, "they told me to head towards libya." 
De Rosa had said by radio Tuesday evening that no one on the ship was injured. About a dozen Americans were aboard, and earlier uncon­firmed reports had said two were killed. 
Asked why the Palestinians sur­rendered, Craxi replied: "We aimed declined to be identified said the Reagan administration had not con­firmed the report but was in touch with the Italian and Egyptian, governments.

A  white  House  official  who  

Only a half-hour earlier, Arbit­tier's wife, Lisa, told a news con­ference how relieved she was the hijacking was over. 
"When I first heard the news, it was an incredible feeling. I just held my breath and then I screamed, 'Let the party begin," said Mrs. Arbittier. 
"It feels like a giant anvil has been lifted offour chests," she added. Klinghoffer had suffered two

The Weltmans' names had not been on an earlier list of Americans believed aboard. But Revzin said the State Department contacted one of the Weltmans' sons today to advise that the couple were on the ship and called again later to say they had been freed.

Congress approves further Afghan aid 

As!lociated Press 
WASHINGTON Congress secretly has approved about $250 million in further covert military aid to rebels fighting the Soviet-backed regime in Afghanistan, Senate sources said yesterday. 
One source, who with the others asked not to be identified by name, said the money will be spent to buy large quantities of ammunition, small arms, grenade launchers, and anti-helicopter air defense weapons. 
"It will enable them to replenish their stocks," he said. "It's a one-time replenishment. There is nothing being introduced that is brand new or especially esoteric. It's the kind of thing easily available anywhere in the world." 
He said he could not confirm reports that the weapons may in­clude the British-made Blowpipe 
portable missile system, used by 
Britain during the 1982 Falklands 
War with Argentina. 
The issues of the long Soviet oc­cupation of Mghanistan, and covert aid by several nations to the Afghan resistance, are virtually certain to be raised in the summit meeting in Geneva next month between Presi­dent Reagan and Soviet leader Mik­hail Gorbachev. 
There was some annoyance in Congress over the latest aid request because the Reagan administration asked for the funds late last month, immediately before the end of the 1985 fiscal year, the source said. 
And he said there was some con­cern over the size ofthe request. 
"We're reaching a position where a lot of us think there should be more debate on this program," the source said. "There is a lot ofmoney Involved." 

Reagan answers USSR on weapon reductions 
As!lociated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Reagan ad­ministration, in a detailed response to Mikhail Gorbachev's arms control proposal, said Tuesday the Soviets have to drop their insistence on scuttling the U.S. "Star Wars" program for negotiations to succeed. 
"It's a precondition that must be dropped," a senior official said ofthe Soviet effort to stop research, testing and development ofanti-missile sys­tems to protect the United States and its allies. 
In a White House briefing for reporters, the official said the Soviet proposal was faulty on at least a half­dozen grounds, including a halt to new U.S. trident nuclear submarines, Midgetman intercontinental ballis­tic missiles and Stealth bombers. 
But, he said, "It is a proposal. It is a place to start." 
Specifically, he singled out two elements ofthe proposal the Soviets put on the negotiating table last week in Geneva, Switzerland. 
One would establish a ceiling of 1,250 nuclear delivery vehicles ­bombers and missiles that carry nuclear warheads. "That would be worthwhile," the official said, since the Soviets' current total is above 2,000. But he said that some details were still incomplete. 
The second promising overture, the official said, was the Soviets' "willingness" to set a ceiling of 6,000 nuclear "charges," or war­heads and other atomic explosives. "That would be positive," he said. 
The official, who demanded anonymity before . talking to reporters, said Reagan was setting no time limits on negotiations in or­der to try to produce an agreement that would make deep cuts in the ar· senals of the two powers. 
Basically, the Soviets have called for a '50 percent cut In nuclear missiles and warheads, but in ways the Reagan administration says would increase' Moscow's ability to launch a "first strike" against the United States. 
The White House distributed charts designed to show an over­whelming Soviet advantage In various aspects of the arms race and to support the U.S. argument that In some respects the proposal was un­fair. 
The U.S. missiles deployed in W es­tern Europe would be counted against the allowable American total of strategic weapons. To get under the celling, the administration would have to choose between scaling down U.S.-based Intercon­tinental ballistic missiles or strip­ping the NATO allies of their American nuclear umbrella, the offi­cial said 

Teen-age Soviet defector assumes U.S. citizenship 
As!lociated Press 
WASHINGTON-Soviet-born Wal­

ter Polovchak, who at age 12 refused 
to return to his homeland, severed 
all legal ties with Moscow Tuesday 
as he took the oath ofU.S. citizenship 
at a Capitol Hill ceremony. 
"I know a lot of people take their 

freedom for granted," Polovchak, 
now 18, told an audience of about 
200 well-wishers. 
"I don't and I never will," he con­tinued. "God bless America." 
His swearing-in culminated an un­usual five-year-long battle to stay in the United States despite his parents' decision to return to the Ukraine in 1980 after a brief taste of American life in Chicago. 
At the ceremony, Polovchak directed this message to his parents: "I wish you well and hope someday we can be together again. But It will have to be in the West because as long as I live, I'll never set foot in the Soviet Union." 
The ceremony and birthday reception for Polovchak, who turned 18 last week, were sponsored by Liberty Institute, a politically conservative group, along with several other organizations, in­cluding the Freedom Federation, a coalition of ethnic groups whose members have fled communist­dominated countries. 
Julian Kulas, the young man's at­torney, said that while Polovchak still resides in Chicago, he decided to hold oath-taking in Washington for several reasons. 
"And we thought it would be very apropos to do it here ... this being the nation's capital and Washington having been very helpful to us in these five years ofWalter's struggle," Kulas remarked. 
Kulas also said the groups organiz­ing the celebration had supported Polovchak's refusal to accompany his parents back to the Soviet Uk­raine and his subsequent legal wrangle. 
"We have had considerable moral support ... from these organizations during the past few years and they have shared Walter's concern about being able to remain In this country," Kulas said.

Transfers now call Notre Dame campus home 
There is a minority on campus with whom I am proud to be associated. It is not related by race, creed, sex, or ethnic group. No, I am 
.speaking ofnone ofthese groups; I am talking about the transfers here at Notre Dame. 
JoanWrappe Talking loud and clear 
There are various reasons why transfers feel the need to go here, but the most frequently uttered response I have heard is that Notre Dame is their first and only choice, and they would settle for no less. I know ofone transfer who had applied two or three times before he was accepted. He certainly was determined and dedicated to get his goal. 
Being a transfer myself, I know how determined you must be. The years spent before entering into the school arl: much like the ones in high school. Aca1demics are top priority. Next, one must utiliize his available time to get involved. This is el[tremely impor­tant because those clubs and activities will help decide whether or not an :tpplicant is worthy of admission. It is tempting, however, to lose sight of the transfer goal if one becomes too involved. 
Having obtained my goal, I now perceive certain qualities transfers possess. The deter­mination they had as applicants turns to pride when they become students. I do not think they have more pride than the rest ofthe com­munity; however, I feel they express it more easily. I know offour transfer girls who sewed "Go Irish!" on their plaid pants ~or the Mic­higan game. It was their way of announcing their presence and expressing their joy of being here. 

After discussing the topic of transfers here at Notre Dame with some friends, aconcensus was reached that transfers on the whole are well-rounded individuals. They do not live in dorms. Rather, they are forced to live off­campus until housing is available. Because of this fact, transfers must take on respon­sibilities which are usually options. Besides the phone bill, they must be conscious of utility bills, food, and transportation to and from school daily. Transfers do not have the luxury of maid service or laundry service, eit­her. These added responsibilities make the tranfers more conscious of their being at Notre Dame and oftheir purpose in attending the school. 
Transfers appear to be a little more open-minded. Most Notre Dame students attended Catholic high schools. Notre Dame is one of the most reputable Catholic universities. It, too, teaches similiar morals and beliefs. Trans­fers have been exposed to different attitudes and beliefs than those stressed here. For in­stance, . many colleges and universities that transfers attended had co-ed dormatories. Be­cause they were exposed to both sexes in a different atmosphere, they are better able to communicate. All ofthese aspects allow trans­fers to be more individualized on the campus. 
I do not want to mislead the Notre Dame community to believe that I think transfers are better than any other student. I just view them as individuals who offer much to the Univer­sity, and I am thankful they are widely ac­cepted and appreciated.

The University has become institutionally false 
The whole race is a poet that writes down The eccentric propositions ofItsfate -Wallace Stevens 
These reflections are an attempt to come to terms with the deep separation existing bet­ween what I have learned to expect from this University and what it is, between what it preaches and what it actually stands for. Un­doubtedly, the religious parochialism of 
Edgardo Tenreiro guest column 
Notre Dame exalts its contradictions; hence, issues such as discrimination against women, obscure investment policies, rampant anti­trade-unionism, lack of internal democracy, failure to take students as serious mature sub­jects and subtle faculty extortion, become especially touchy. I would argue, though, that some ofthese traits are not particular to Notre Dame but are present in most institutions of higher education throughout the world. 
I believe that the cause of faculty and stu­dent resentment against the university (in the most general sense of the word, a body of in­stitutions} lies not at being consdous of the above contradictions. After all, some Americans resented military involvement in Vietnam, but they nevertheless ac:tively chal­lenged this foreign policy. Such il;; the nature of the democratic discourse. Morc:over, some members of this community are sincerely committed to find out and improv4: when pos­sible Notre Dame's record of labor mistreat­ment and investment policic:s. This kind of resentment is positive.becauS<e it springs from a great conflict between different ethical con­ceptions which ultimately result iin a change of the status quo. The resentment I am refer­ring to is a deeper one. It evolves into a cynicism that borders on complete apathy, destructive criticism or even total solipsism. Its root is the feeling that intellectual effort in the University has become· institutionally false. 
What do I mean by institutionally false? The realization that I am part ofan impersonal and amoral machinery whose main ObJiective is to 

produce ideas to be sold in the commodity market. The University is a factory ofresearch, seminars, publications and intellectual debates that aims at minimizing costs and maximizing output to assure survival. We are all caught in a vicious circle: to produce alumni that will eventually finance the Univer­sity or to produce research that will increase its reputation. The winner survives and gets the chance to produce more. And then, I feel that the University is actively concerned with power and honor and not with knowledge and truth. That is why my intellectual effort is a fallacy: what am I promoting? What is more virtuous: power and honor, or knowledge and truth? I understand that it is the latter, but I realize that I am in a situation I cannot escape. 
And I resent it. 
If this is so, why do I keep studying? The experience, though institutionally false, is deeply rewarding. In interacting with faculty and other students who share the same con­cerns and doubts, in this fraternal dialogue, an answer that saves me from utter despair is un­veiled. Beyond market considerations, I realize the University's intellectual parapher­nalia is also a rigorously aesthetic urge to generate bodies of cathartic language, texts, fictions and propositional flora -be it religious, philosophical, artistic, or business and engineering like. I long for that secure feeling that results from creating my own proposition about life: the imagination labors, and I become the local hero ofmy philosophic system, my novel or poem, my computer program, my life. 
In this painful and (why not?) joyful space ­as when the tide is low and the sand is wet -in which truth plays hide-and-seek with me, I embrace with love my only alternative: to ges­ticulate with passion, idleness and beauty, the precarious objects of my contemplation. Then I feel euphoric to know that the vague terrain of language leaves me so much virgin space between myself and others, that I am able to freely exist within the tensions, am­biguities, boundaries and fallacies of the Uni­versity: the collective and eccentric proposition of our fate.

Legalize euthanasia so those dying have a choice 
-
Mercy killing. These two words placed together automatically imply the controversy which is aroused when the issue ofeuthanasia comes up. Can the premeditated ending of human life ever be justified or considered merciful? So many stands exist on this ques­tion that it appears unanswerable, and yet it must be addressed. Should the law be allowed to limit a person's right to die with dignity? 
Lisa Perez 
in perspective 
The courts and doctors are consistently dis­cussing the right of critically ill patients to refuse medical treatment, but as of right now the law is against euthanasia. And why is that? People have the right to live life in any way 



Doonesbury 
they choose. According to the Constitution, people have the right to life, libe1rty and the pursuit of happiness. Do people not have the right to death when they can no longer live in bodies that are trapped and riddled with pain and disease? It is not a decision that can be made rashly, and euthanasia should not be considered unless there exists no realistic chance for recovery. Only afiter so:rious con­templation with a doctor about the future ef­fects of the illness should a patient conSider euthanasia. Life is precious and the taking ofit should not be haphazard or without serious contemplation. 
There often arises the comparison of eut­hanasia to the condo[)ing of suidde, but the two are incomparable. Suicide is usually an emotional outcry for help, and once that help is offered, the individual's mental health and attitude can improve. Mercy kiUing is dif­ferent. When a person has a totally degenerative disease such as Alzheimers or in­operable cancer where no cure is forthcom­ing, they, perhaps, might choose death over their painful lives. And it should be their choice to die with dignity -not the courts and not the doctors. The choice between life and death is too intensely personal to ever be decided by someone else. 

That also differentiates the reasoning bet­ween abortion and mercy killing. While both are taking a life, they cannot accurately be compared. A doctor cannot ask the unborn child to make the decision between its life and death; with euthanasia, the person making the final decision is the person who will be dying. The final choice with euthanasia remains (or ought to) with the person whose life is directly involved. 
Garry Trudeau 


There then might lie a solution to the eut­hanasia issue -it should legally be a choice made by the patient. Mercy killing should never be advocated as the sole solution to ill­ness but it should be permitted if the patient chooses it. A close and careful watch should be kept by the law and the doctors so that eut­hanasia does not become rampant or hap­hazard. But these people must not be the deciding force. The lawmakers have no com­prehension of the enormous pain and suffer­ing of the critically ill and should not force them to live their lives trapped in a cage of pain. Instead, euthanasia should be legalized so that it can be the choice of those who are critically ill. Dying with dignity should not be a crime.

Notre Dame should divest to help the oppressed 

For some time I have watched, with a sense of unease, the growth of a culture of boos­terism on the Notre Dame campus. In recent years It has takf"n on a more visceral quality. At 

Peter Walshe 
guest column 
football games boosterism has a place -the stadium Is Its natural ambience. When it Is In­stitutionalized in other areas ofthe University, however, Its dangers become apparent. It would be worrisome, for example, If we adopted this style to discuss the investment Issues at Notre Dame, specifically our hol­dings in corporations that do business in South Africa. 
Boosterism inhibits critical reflection. It is fun in an atmosphere of gamesmanship, but carried into academic or moral discourse it generates delusion, fantasy and a sense of un­reality. I cannot count the times I have heard top administrators refer to Notre Dame as the greatest Catholic university in the world ­indeed in all of history. Surely, If this is the case, it does not need proclaiming -least ofall by Notre Dame officials -and If this is not the case we sound plain silly to ourselves and to outsiders. 


The problem, in all likelihood, is a by­product ofRoman triumphalism. Having been raised in an atmosphere of Irish-Catholic tri­umphalism, I pick up the scent very quickly. I am sure that my father, a third order Dominican, had a hard time accepting the idea of salvation for those not of our faith. Then Vatican II came along and proceeded to dis­mantle the theological underpinnings of tri­umphalism. Sadly, poor old Vatican II has become unfashionable among many success­ful North American Catholics. What was a burst ofcreative, ecumenical energy has given way to reaction and fear of change. With the reassertion of hierarchy over collegiality, tri­umphalism has made its reappearance. 
One totally inappropriate place for this chest-beating celebration of ourselves, is the liturgical setting. On a number of occasions during past weeks we have been told what a fine, caring, super bunch ofpeople we all are, especially when we get together to pray at Mass. It appears that the scriptural passage about the pharisee and the publican (Luke 18: 9-14) has gone missing from Notre Dame Bibles! Then there are those court clerics in our midst who have Invented what my wife calls the sacrament ofextreme unctuousness. 
It is time to take stock and to begin to apply the brakes to this rampant blarney. Other dis­tinguished universities and colleges do not engage in such solipsistic nonsense. I have

16,433 die a silent death and inhumane burial 
Dear Editor: 
As I was reading Monday's Chicago Tribune, I came across an article which brought a sickening feeling throughout my body. The article reported the mass burial of 16,433 human beings in six coffin-like boxes during a funeral service in East Los Angeles. 
This was not a headline article with big, bold letters proclaiming the disaster, nor did It appear at all on the front page. Rather, it received only a one paragraph blurb tucked away on page 12. 
I wondered how the editor could justify such disproportionallty. The reason, it ap­pears, is that these dead human beings were aborted fetuses. Does a fetus rate any less respect than that endowed in all human beings? 
It is very disheartening to live In a country which proclaims the inalienable rights of In­dividuals to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and which then passes a Supreme Court decision allowing for the murder ofmil­lions of defenseless lives. Somehow, and at some time, this Insanity must stop. Reporting this tragedy as a mere item ofnews trivia Is not the answer.

ND moves in the right 


direction on apartheid 
Dear Editor: 
We were pleased with the recent decision of the University Trustees to appoint an Ad Hoc Committee on South African Invest­ments. Now that the Committee is about to repon to the full Board of Trustees, we look forward to a revised Notre Dame policy on South African investments, one that will be ethically defensible and effective in contribut­ing to the growing anti-apartheid movement across the country. 
There is much at stake in this issue for our Notre Dame community and we applaud the efforts that are being made to educate the campus, particularly during the observance of Anti-Apartheid Week, Oct. 7-11. We ask our colleagues and students to take "time out" to examine the ethical and political issues that the continued existence of apartheid raises, not least because the University has substan­tial funds Invested in corporations that con­tinue to operate within that system.

Dillon got kicked in the tailgater by Goldrick 
Dear Editor: 
Once again, I am chafed. Someone had to take fun two, maybe three steps too far. Having a tailgater at Ann Arbor, with kegs yet? Where is our decency, our decorum, our memory of the game? Everyone knows that kegs are forbidden on campus, and Michigan is a campus, mind you. Du Lac applies everywhere. 
You may have guessed by now that I am a Dillonite, a "scum of the earth" as that wretched little ditty goes. Admittedly I was in attendance at the we-got-kicked-in-the­tailgater. And unfortunately, I must confess I did partake in some of the pleasantries which went on in Ann Arbor. Where was my head? What was I thinking? What is the capital of North Dakota? It is with outrage how I look back upon my actions, those which I recall. My conscience has been all over me, worse than when I pulled that Tylenol thing awhile back. I thought lighting candles at the Grotto would help relieve the pressure of my guilt, and then look what happens. 
Fortunately, I attend Notre Dame, where justice is swift and sure. The administration recognized Dillon's hand in this out-of­control, fun event and moved quickly. "Let's take away Dillon's SYR and make them do qommunity service." The instrument has not Yilt been invented that can measure the hurt I felt when I heard the news about the canceled dance. I had already picked out my outfit for the evening, a nifty little ensemble, if I do say so myself. 
Alas, I guess it was not to be. It is probably all for the better anyway. I probably would have loaded up on warm beer and stale crack­ers and ended up treating my date like a piece ofmeat on a hook or worse, as an unequal. And that is regardless ofwhether she is a conniving little Saint Mary's husband hound or an am­bitious, worldly Notre Dame woman. There really is some good in everything, Toto. 
As for the community service, well, that is how offenders are punished in the real world, and we are just one step away from there. Or is that from reality? No matter. I thought Dillon's blatant disregard for the rules would end with the reign of Bernie "Czardo" Pelligrino but I see that I w~ mistaken. Current President John "Am I on TV's Practical Jokes, Bleeps, and Blunders, Mr. Goldrick?" Husmann has con· tinued this trend. It is disgusting. It is degrad' ing. It is the greatest. I just want the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's community to know that there is one Dlllonite who is sorry for these uncalled for actions. And when I find him, I will tell you.

Pettifer's 'negativism' is backed as justified 
Dear Editor: 
In a recent letter to the editor, Ann Pettlfer was criticized for being too negativistic and was challenged to find something good to write about in future letters. This letter was in response to a series ofletters Pettifer has writ­ten to The Observer, on a variety of Issues. Perhaps I misread Pettifer's most recent letter. I did not interpret it as a personal attack on Janet Smith or Smith's work at the Women's Care Center. Rather, Pettifer seemed to be citing sexism, as the root cause of the problems that the center deals with. It is be­cause of sexism in our society, that such services are needed. As for having something good to say about sexism .... 
However, this particular letter appears to be criticizing criticism in general, which is a much more serious matter. It implies condonement of censorship in a subtle form: "If you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything." While this attitude may seem appropriate for certain social settings, it is cer­tainly not appropriate for the editorial page of a universty newspaper. 
Furthermore, this particular student (and I suspect a good many others) seems to find Pettlfer's "negativism" distasteful, even of­fensive. This should come as no surprise. Indeed, negative criticism itself seems old­fadhloned today. The prophets of today's "feel-good" philosophy are attempting to 
children who have attended places like 
Swarthmore, Oberlin and Earlham, so I have 
had opportunities to read their alumni 
magazines. The ethos on those campuses Is 
very different. Swarthmore, a small, Quaker 
school with a formidable reputation, Is 
modest in a way that the confidently distin­
guished Institution can afford to be. 
I said at the outset that I have an agenda for raising this matter ofboosterism. Notre Dame is wrestling with the South African investment issue once more. While our track record to date has been timid, our rhetoric has been thunderous. We have condemned apartheid yet at the same time we have refused a moral leadership role on divestment. Oberlin Col­lege in Ohio did not indulge in pantomimes of moral self-congratulation -it just divested its stock. 
At our last Commencement, Notre Dame gave the Rev. Beyers Naude, the courageous South African clergyman, an honorary degree. Naude was calling for divestment as far back as 1976. The presence ofthis prophetic Christian graced our campus last spring, it would be good for us If we would now heed his call to do our bit to end apartheid. Moral blarney and boosterism will not bring the white govern­ment in Pretoria to the negotiating table with legitimate black leaders. A threat to divest, coming from an influential university In the Christian tradition like Notre Dame, would help.

their talents in a particular sport have an opportunity to go on to col­lege, to get an education, on a full scholarship," Davis said. "They receive the highest level of coach­ing. health care and training. and at the same time receive the highest level of education available at that institution. 
"I don't think either the institu­tion or the student-athlete is exploit­ing the other. There are instances, though, where the student-athlete has been exploited by an institution, but I think that's in a vast minority of cases." 
Raymond Baumhart, S.J., Presi­dent of Loyola University in Chicago, added another perspective on the subject, taking a position somewhere between that of Phelps and Davis. 
"Most college athletes are not being exploited," he said. "At most schools, there are none being ex­ploited. Few women athletes are being exploited. In some sports, such as lacrosse or field hockey, none are being exploited. The only cases we ha.ve of exploitation are a few male athletes in the revenue­producing or image-enhancing sports." 
The evil demon in all this, the al­mighty dollar, comes largely from one source, network television money. Peter Lund, President ofCBS Sports, also was on hand last night to defend the networks' position. 
"We are only a buyer ofrights sold to us by various colleges and univer­sities," said Lund. "We do not con­trol how that money is spent. We do feel, in a somewhat strange sort of way, responsible for what is going on, but, again, we can't control the individual schools."

Reilly, Assistant Vice President at Loyola, made his own observation on network television's relation to college athletics. Reilly surmised that when a network carries a game, it makes money, and that when a scandal hits, it also makes money. Ei~her way, scandal or no scandal, the networks do well, he concluded. 
It also was brought out that a student-athlete on full scholarship is entitled to room and board, tuition and fees, and up to $900 in a Pell Grant if financial need is shown. Phelps, meanwhile, suggested that student-athletes be paid a stipend in addition to that which they now receive. 
"Last year's NCAA tournament for basketball grossed 132 million," Phelps stated. "All we would need to do is take $4 million off the top of that and divide it up among the 270 member schools-n,ooo a month per player times l 0 months -and we could afford it." 
Phelps claimed that such a practice would eliminate such il­legal "nickel and dime" offenses as ticket scalping and gifts to athletes from booster dubto and alumni. 
Davis and Baumhart both opposed the suggestion ofthe Notre Dame basketball coach, though, with Baumhart pointing out a poten­
tial  problem  with  any  proposal  
giving money only  to  scholarship  
basketball players.  

"Within a week, a member of the track team will file suit charging dis­crimination," countered the Loyola president. "It would cost us a whole lot more money than what you've suggested." 
The topic of pressure within col­lege athletic circles later arose in the panel discussion. Phelps was first to say that perhaps society overem­phasizes the importance of college athletics. 
"It bothers me when people say their school is going to fold if the

N.L. playoffs 

Valenzuela lifts L.A. to 4-1 win 
AAoclatedPre811 
LOS ANGELES -Los Angeles stole an offensive ploy from St. Louis last night, and Fernando Valenzuela pitched the Dodgers to a 4-1 victory over John Tudor and the Cardinals in the first game of the I985 Na­tional League playoffs. 
Bill Madlock, acquired by the Dodgers five weeks ago in a trade with Pittsburgh, was the offensive catalyst in both innings in which the Dodgers scored. 
Valenzuela worked 6 1/3 innings for his first victory in nearly a month, and the Dodgers scored their runs with the help of an error, a stolen base and a two-out squeeze bunt, of­fensive tactics more commonly thought of as belonging to the Car­dinals. 
The opportunistic Cardinals, meanwhile, wasted one opportunity after another against Valenzuela. 
The best-of-seven series, which opened before a Dodger Stadium crowd of 55,270, continues tonight with a match of right-banders Orel Hershiser, 19-3, of the Dodgers against Joaquin Andujar, 21-12. 
The Dodgers scored one run In the fourth on an error, a stolen base and a bloop single by Pedro Guer­rero, then scored three more in the sixth and chased Tudor with the 

No. 6 singles player 
help of the bunt. Tudor, who had won 20 of his last 21 decisions, had taken a three-hitter Into the Dodgers' big inning. 
A loss to Valenzuela on July 20 was the only blemish on Tudor's record after a I-7 start. Valenzuela was rebounding from a poor finish that saw him go -I-2 with five no­decisions In his final eight starts. His last win of the regular season came on Sept. II against Atlanta. 


American League page 14 
In each ofthe first two innings, the Cardinals had runners on second with two out, but each time fililed to get the key hit to bring in a run against Valenzuela. 
Tommy Herr doubled to left field with two out in the first, and Valen­zuela then walkedJack Clark on a 3­2 pitch. But Cesar Cedeno blooped out weakly to Sax at second and the inning was over. 
With two out in the second, Smith singled for the Cardinals, then stole second base. But Tudor grounded out to second and another threat had evaporated against the clever Dodger left-hander. 
Tudor, meanwhile, retired the first seven batters before giving up a single to Sax, who drove a 1·0 pitch up the middle. Sax was sacrificed to second by Valenzuela for the second out of the inning, and Mariano Dun­can grounded out to third for the final out. 
Again in the fourth inning, the Cardinals had a two-out runner after Pendleton reached on a bunt single to third. His bunt was fielded by Madlock, whose throw looked to be in time but pulled first baseman Enos Cabell's foot off the bag. Pendleton, however, was quickly dispatched when Valenzuela picked him off first and the Cardinal baserunner was put out in a run­down. 
The Cards got the leadoff runner on in the following Inning, but again failed to score. Porter led off with a single to right, but Smith followed with a routine fly ball to left. Valen­zuela then struck out the next two batters, Tudor, on an anempted two­strike bunt, and Coleman. 


Szajko asset to SM C tennis team 
By CHRISTINE FORTIN 
Sports Writer 
Contributing team spirit and talent to the Saint Mary's tennis team, freshman Charlene Szajko has proven herself to be quite an asset. 
She currently plays in the No. 6 position and holds a 9-4 record, which is the best win-loss record on the team. 
Szajko added two wins to her record last Saturday when the Belles played In the Notre Dame Invita­tional. She was the only team mem­ber to pick up a win for Saint Mary's in the matches against Cincinnati and Marquette. 
Saint Mary's had met Marquette earlier in the season, but Szajko lost to her opponent that time. 
Saturday, Szajko lost the first set to Marquette, but she did not give up and won the match in a tiebreaker In the third set. 
"Charlene is good enough to move up to a higher position," said Belles coach Debbie Laverie, but Laverie said she Is reluctant to make the transition because Szajko is doing so well in the No. 6 position. 
Szajko, a Mishawaka resident, has been playing tennis for eight years and teaches tennis to students and adults during the summer. In high

school, she played No. 2 and No. 4 singles. She was awarded most lm· proved player her sophomore year and recc:ived the mental attitude award her junior year. 
Szajko, a nursing major, said she was attracted to Saint Mary's be­cause of its small size. She likes the benefits that Saint Mary's has to of· fer, especially the individual atten­tion In the classroom. 
Although tennis was not a factor In her decision to attend Saint Mary's, she said she enjoys playing with the team and Intends to play all four years. 
"Playing with the team is a good experience and I feel that I am im­proving with every match," she said. 
"Charlene is the kind of player every coach wants to have," Laverle said. "She has a lot of potential and works hard to execute instructions." 
Szajko. said she feels her role on the team is no different from anyone else's. She prefers college tennis over high school tennis because of the higher degree of competition and the Belle's spirit of team unity. 
Laveric: said that Szajko has risen to the high level of play and con­tributed to the team as a whole. 
"Charlene Is a good team player," Laverie said. "She always cheers on the other players and promotes team comraderie." 
The Belle's next match is Saturday

ball past the diving Breslin into the lower left corner at 74:33 to give the Warriors a commanding 5-2 lead. 
Martin Mangialardi scored for Notre Dame at 75:'52 to make the final score close. 
Grace, meanwhile, said he can only speculate as to why his squad has not played with Intensity In the first half. 
"I can't put my finger on It," he said. "It could be the fact that we've only won three ballgames out of 14. 
"I hope It's not the f.act that they don't believe in themselves. This weekend will tell the tale." 
The Irish will play Vanderbilt and the host team in the Illinois State Tournament Saturday and Sunday.

Golfers get 2nd in MCC tourney 
SpecW to The Observer 
The Notre Dame golf team finished in second place in the Midwestern City Conference Championship at the GolfClub of Indianapolis Tuesday. 
The Irish finished the 54-hole tournament behind national power Oral Roberts in blustery weather. 
Senior captain john O'Donovan was named to the all· conference team with a three· round total of 240. O'Donovan's rounds of 76, 80 and 84 gave him fifth place overall. 
Rich Connelly missed the all­conference squad with rounds of 76, 80 and 86. john Anthony hit 248 for the Irish, and Chris Bona finished at 251. 
Senior Steve Fuhrer, who hoped to repeat on the all­conference team, was forced from the competition with an eye injury after the second round. His 76-80 pace put him with the leaders after that round. 
Buder finished the tournament in third place, and Evansville was fourth. Medalist for the tourna­ment was Nick Classen of Oral 
Roberts,  who  hit  225,  with  
rounds of 72, 7 4  and 79.

3-0 after escaping a strong threat by 
Fisher by the score of 1-0. 
"We got off to a sluggish start, and 
we underestimated them," said Holy 
Cross captain Frank Loughlin. "It 
was our toughest game so far." The 
game's only goal, occuring midway 
throught the first half, was scored by 
Kahlil Shalabi. The Hogs have yet to 
be scored upon after three games. 
Cavanaugh improved to 3-1 with a 
victory over Carroll on Monday 
night, as Mark Burdell scored on a 
breakaway with two minutes left in 
the game, breaking a 1-1 tie. 
Cavanaugh survived a late first-half 
defensive lapse which saw them at a 
1-0 disadvantage at halftime. Matt 
Zyniewicz scored the equalizer mid­
way through the second half for 
Cavanaugh. 
Grace "B" won its first game ofthe 
season last Saturday in exciting fas­
hion against the same Carroll team. 
Tied 2-2 after regulation on goals by 
Jim Grace and Phil Castilano, Grace 
"B" used a sudden-death shootout 
goal by captain Tom Mall to get 
Grace on the winning track with a 
3-2 victory. 
The West European League saw 
perhaps the fiercest battle of the 
week, as Zahm "A" defeated a luck­
less Sorin team by a score of 3-2. 
Zahm "A" got on the board early on 
captain Bill Lane's goal, but Sorin

was to even the score on a penalty kick later in the first half. Tom Keating put Zahm "A" back on top with a goal right before halftime. 
Second-half action quickly heated up, as Sorin once again tied the game at two. However, Sorin's hopes for a victory were once again dashed when Matt Tfohl ofZahm "A" scored with three minutes left in regulation. Zahm "A" evened its record at 2-2; Sorin fell to 0-3. 
Traditional West European powerhouse Flanner "A" rumbled through the week with victories over Keenan and Zahm "A", improv­ing its record to 3-1. In last Sunday's game against Keenan, Flanner "A" used second-half goals by captain Bill johnson and Ed Sparinchak to roll to a 2-0 victory. 
"Keenan was our best game so far," said captain Bill Johnson. "We really got it together in the second half." 
Flanner "A" came back on Tues­day against Zahm "A," rebounding from a 1-0 deficit to win, 2-1. "We didn't go after them too hard," remarked johnson. However, Flan­ner "A" recovered with goals from Doug Feeney and Nat Vories to go on and win the match. 
Over in the East European League, the "Mud Cup" was played on Satur­day morning between Dillon I and Pangborn. After the mud was slung and the cold rain had fallen, Dillon I prevailed by a 2-0 score. The Dillon 
attack was fueled by a two-goal per­
formance by Mike Carney. 
Pangborn rebounded from its loss 
in the quagmire yesterday with a 5-0 
tarring of Holy Cross "B", on two­
goal performances by John Drew 
and Mike Jakob, and an added goal 
byJeff Laurenson. 
In other East European games, 
Stanford remained undefeated as It 
showed up to beat an apathetic Flan­
ner "B" squad, 5-0. The talented 
Studs were no match for the ten 
Flanner "B" players who showed up 
to play. Goals were provided by Dan 
O'Donnell, Rob Zelinski, Jim Byrne, 
"Boo-Boo" EL-Farhan and John 
Quinn. 
This weekend will prove crucial to many teams still hoping for playoff berths. Howard will try to prove that it is for real as it goes up against an extremely tough Morris­sey "A" squad (Saturday, 11 a.m., North Stepan). If Howard passes that test, all eyes will be on its game against St. Ed's. Keenan may be the last team to be able to beat O.C. Crime this season in the West European League, and in fact Keenan must win to preserve any playoff hopes it might have (Saturday, 11 a.m., North Stepan). 
One final game of interest over in the East European League is the match between Dillon I and Stan­ford, where the undefeated Studs go up against an unknown, and possibly quite talented, adversary (Sunday, 2 p.m., North Stepan).

The Notre Dame football team will not play a game this Saturday, and the way things have been going lately, it may be just as well. The players and coaches can use the time off to rest, regroup, and most importantly to get things toget­her. 
But when the 1985 season resumes in Notre Dame Stadium on Saturday, Oct. 19, the moment of reckoning will be at hand. The opponent will be Army, another un­defeated service academy team that employs a wishbone offense. (Sound familiar?) 
For Notre Dame, there is a great deal riding on the Army game. It may, in fact, be Notre Dame's last chance to salvage its season. The Irish have reached the point where they can either find themselves as a team and start playing with some consistency, or just keep on making the same sortofmistakes that have become all too familiar this year. 
The talent is there for this team to put on a strong finish. But it's up to the coaches and the players themselves to get on the right track. 
Quarterback Steve Beuerlein had some thoughts to that effect after Notre Dame's 35-17 loss to Purdue, the low point ofthe season so far. 
"We can play with anybody," said Beuerlein. "That's why this season has been so frustrating. Jf· .. .; can just go out on the field and execute and gainsorre consistency, then we'll be all right. But we can't wait any longer." 
No, they can't. While it may alr !ady be too late to salvage the '85 season, there's no doub. that if the Irish don't es-


Larry Burke 
Football Notebook 

tablish some consistency now, things are going to get even worse. All it takes is a look at the schedule to establish that fact. 
After Army comes Southern Cal, a team that was in the Top Twenty two weeks ago before suffering a 24-0 defeat at the hands ofArizona St. on Sept. 28. The Trojans are just 2-2, but appear to be getting things together again, as evidenced by their 63-0 pasting ofOregonSt. last Saturday. 
Notre Dame concludes its four-game homestand with Navy ( 1-3) and and Mississipi ( 2-2-1 ), two teams that aren't particularly strong. But things get tougher after that, when the Irish face Penn State and LSU in the next two weeks. Both teams are currently undefeated and ranked in the Top Twenty. The Nittany Lions are eighth, and will take a 4-0 record into Saturday's nationally-televised contest with I Oth-ranked Alabama. The 2-I Tigers held the No. 8 spot last week, but slippc:d to 20th after Saturday's loss to Florida. 
The Irish wrap up their season in Miami, where they have not won since 1977. The Hurricanes dropped their '85 opener to Florida, but have since come back to win three straight, including a 45-10 victory at Boston College. 
Can this year's Notre Dame team hope to win against that sort of competition? Not if it keeps making the same crucial mistakes, keeps committing the same mental er· rors, and keeps taking the same innoportune penalties. 
What has made all these mistakes even more critical is the times at which they've occurred. The Air Force game is a good example. It seemed that whenever the Irish moved the ball deep into Falcon territory, the offense self­destructed. If the Air Force game had been played on a 70-yard field, the Irish would have scored 40 points. 
Notre Dame's first four games have brought to light plenty of problems, the biggest of which could be the team's attitude. Are the players willing to do what it takes to turn things around? 
"I think it's all up to us now," said senior defensive back Pat Ballage. "It gets to be frustrating, because it's been four years and things haven't changed. The danger is that the team could get into a losing attitude. You worry about get­ting used to losing. But I don't think that will happen to this team. 
"The guys that are pumped up are the guys that want to win. But it's hard to pinpoint exactly what it takes to get up to win." 
Whatever it takes, the Irish had better put their finger on it soon.
