Facebook use extends beyond college 
Worries linger about security ofpersonal info, but networking capabilities provide advantages 
Each day, more than 3billion minutes spent on Facebook worldwide More than 850 million photos updated to the site each month More than 5million videos uploaded each month 
More than 2 million events created each month More than 70 percent of Facebook users outside the United States 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Associate News Editor 
This is the third installment of a three-part series that will explore the recent terms of use controversy involving Facebook and delve into the way interac­tion with and opinion of the site has changed since 2004, when Notre Dame students were first able to become users. 
Senior Michael Massengale has a love/hate relationship with Facebook. 
He joined the site before he was a freshman, as soon as he received his Notre Dame e-mail address. 
"Basically everyone I knew was getting it and everyone who had it recommended it, so I decided to give it a try," he said. 
Initially, he used the site fair­ly often, logging on every day and sending notes back and forth with friends, especially those from home who had gone to other schools for college. 
But the more Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg updated the site, the less Massengale liked it. The one thing that has prevent­ed him from quitting the site, he said, is the ability to upload and share photos. 
"If it wasn't for the photos, I wouldn't have a Facebook," he said. 
He said he's taken personal

New film profiles self-image 
ByJENN METZ News Writer 
The film "America the Beautiful" was shown to a sold­out audience Sunday afternoon at the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center. Last week, its organizers were afraid no one would show up. 
The movie is not about patriotic songs, as its title suggests, but rather about issues of female body image in a society where "celebutantes" like Paris Hilton and stick-thin models dominate the media. 
Valerie Staples, an eating disor­ders specialist at the University, said "America the Beautiful" is "a fihn that will bring a lot of aware­ness of how much influence the media and advertising have on eating disorders." 
On Wednesday, she checked with the ticket office at the Center to see how many seal<> had been reserved, just to make sure people were coming. 
Advertisenw.nts for the fihn fea­tured an image of the Statue of Liberty with notes like "Widen mouth." "Enlarge eyes," and "Two words: Nose job!" with arrows pointing at the body parts they described. 
Images of "perfection and ideal standards" that bombard men and women through the media have led to a decrease in self­esteem, she said. 
"We need to step back, and look at these things objectively," Staples said. "Who said this is beautiful?"

located in LaFortune Student  
Center because it does not offer  
the "$5 footlong" deal, Notre

Students caught f~r m.usic piracy 
ORLH issues 100 copyright infringement notices per semester 
By ROBERT SINGER News Writer 
While it is common knowl­edge that breaking parietals and underage drinking will result in punishment, many students are unaware the Office of Residence Life and Housing (ORLI-1) can deliver punishments for illegal music downloads. 
Students who illegally download copyrighted mate­rial, such as TV shows, music, games or movies, could expect to receive a dis­ciplinary letter from the University if an outside organization spots their activity. 
About 100 students per semester receive "copyright infringement notic;es," said Robert Casarez, assistant director at the Office of Residence Life and Housing (ORLH). 
Since file sharing traffic can be publicly monitored, organizations bent on limit­ing piracy like the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), The Entertainment Software Association, NBC Universal, IIBO and Columbia Pictures can identify users who ha've pirated copyrighted materi­al, Casarez said. 
"Since this information is public, outside organizations log the information and send the notices to the Internet Service Provider where the material is originating," he said. "It is up to the Internet Service Provider, in the case of our students, Notre Dame, to identify the person and notify them of the violation." 
The University does not actively make an effort to enforce copyright laws, but only responds to the requests of agencies hired by recording industries or movie studios. 
"Our office does not seek out students who are down­loading copyrighted materi­al," Casarez said. "We only respond to the notices sent by outside organizations." 
If a student receives a let­ter from ORLH for copyright infringement, he or she will be warned if it is his or her first offense. But repeated

Assault a reality at University, panel says 
By MADELINE BUCKLEY Assistant News Editor 

Heather Rakoczy Russell, director of the Gender Relations Center (GRC). said Friday she was recently asked if sexual assault really happens at a place like Notre Dame. Unfortunately, she said, it does. 
As a culmination of Sexual Ass.ault Awareness Week, the GRC, along with the student government and several other campus groups, hosted a panel of speakers at the "A Time to Heal" dinner Friday at Legends to address the problem of sexual assault. 
Rakoczy Russell said The Clery Act --a statute that requires colleges and univer­sities to disclose information about campus crime -­requires the University to keep and report records about reported rapes on cam­pus. She said it is not uncom­mon for the number of reported rapes at Notre Dame to be one or zero per year. 
"We know that's not repre­sentative of what happens here," she said. "Hape is the most dramatically underre­ported crime." 
Rakoczy Russell said the most common form of rape on campus is date rape. Students are not assaulted by strangers, but rather

INSIDE COLUMN 
Dear 



readers 
Dear readers, 
I am thrilled to begin my year as Editor­in-ChiefofThe Observer today. 
I have dedicated countless hours to The Observer, slaving away at the old comput­
ers in the darkest  
place on this  Jenn Metz  
campus-the  
basement of  
So~!=~~­ Editor-in-Chief  
column from my  
room in  

Cavanaugh, where there is a window to the outside world. However, there are at least 10 staffers at work as my fingers type, put­ting aside homework and social obligations to operate a finicky software program and actually make the newspaper. 
The students on the production staffare the unsung heroes ofthis campus, in my opinion. Getting paid less than one dollar an hour for their work, which can last late into the night, and still coming back week after week is a real testament to The Observer as both a publication and mini-community on this campus. 
Some things I have learned while putting in my time at a production computer: Save your documents. Keep your cell phone on. Don't panic. Pray. And most importantly: Save your documents. 
Some things I wish I would have learned sooner: Procrastination does not always work. There are really only 24 hours in a day and it is possible to over-schedule your­self. (To the professors whose classes I've missed this past week and to the friends whom I've missed lunches, breakfasts and dinners with, I apologize.) 
Though putting in time at The Observer has caused me to miss out on certain parts ofbeing a student here at Notre Dame and sacrifice any hope ofa regular sleep sched­ule, it has granted me other opportunities that have made joining the paper the best decision ofmy adult life. 
I was able to travel to Washington, D.C. to witness the inauguration ofPresident Barack Obama. I've had the pleasure of interviewing congressmen and movie stars. I've sat down with University President Emeritus Fr. Theodore Hesburgh to talk about civil rights and his remarkable career. 
Most importantly, however, I've had the honor ofinterviewing hundreds ofyou: my classmates. The things you accomplish everyday, whether it be passing a resolution in student government, starting a club, serving the community and still making time to study, learn and live here in South Bend are inspiring. 
We've sought to help you-by reporting on national news with a Notre Dame angle to assist in your post-graduationjob search­es, by keeping you up-to-date on politics, by continuing to make The Observer an indis­pensable link between the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's campuses. 
Fr. Hesburgh sent me a letter shortly after I was announced the next editor-in-chief. He wrote he was sure I would carry on the tradition ofThe Observer "with great style and panache." I hope I can fulfill his and all ofyour expectations during my tenure. 
I pride myself on The Observer's contin­ued reputation as a responsible news media. Thank you for your continued sup­port ofour publication. It is our goal to serve you in the best way possible. Ifwe're not, I'll want to hear about it and sugges­tions for change. You know how to contact me. 
The views expressed in the Inside Column are those of the author and not necessarily those ofThe Observer.

Ind. legislation offers financial assistance 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY 
News Writer 
Two Saint Mary's students traveled to the Indiana State House in Indianapolis last week to thank legislators for granti­ng state money to students and ask that they continue to give their support. 
As the dismal economy con­tinues to make it more difficult for students to afford tuition, there are still options for finan­cial aid avaifable through the state, and many Saint Mary's students take advantage of it. 
Saint Mary's freshmen Sarah Kletka and Alma Bravo joined 250 students from 20 other pri­vate and independent colleges on the Feb. 24 trip. 
Kletka is a nursing major who is working two jobs to cover the cost of books and tuition at Saint Mary's. 
"I decided to go because this money is an integral part of my attendance at Saint Mary's," Kletka said. "I feel that it is my responsibility to represent those of us at Saint Mary's who struggle to afford it and need every penny we are offered." 
Students receive the funds from the State Student Assistance Commission of Indiana (SSACI). Kletka said they were given the opportuni­ty to meet with hometown leg­islators on the trip. 
"Alma and I were very lucky that our representatives and senators actually came out of their sessions to speak with us," she said. "We spoke with them on the issues of student financial aid grants, and stu­dent need for more financial aid." 
Students discussed the possi­ble changes in funding over the coming years. Kletka said the legislators discussed a change in the quantity of funding for individual students, but not for the program as a whole. 
"They explained that even though the amount of grant money may not decrease from year to year, the amount the student receives could possible decrease depending on how many students apply and need aid," Kletka said. 
Kletka and Bravo are not the only students who are given aid money from the state. 
"Many of our students receive this important grant, and with­out it [they] might have not been able to attend a small pri­vate college," Karen Johnson, Saint Mary's vice president of student affairs said in a press release early last week. "The liberal arts education these women are getting at Saint Mary's will allow them, as graduates, to be flexible and change with the times." 
Kletka is appreciative of the grant money she has received and the opportunity it gave her. 
"I could never have afforded Saint Mary's on my own, but with the generosity of Saint Mary's, financial aid, state funding and numerous scholar­ships, I am here," shesaid.

Monologues perform 
stories at St. Mary's 
By Alicia Smith 
News Writer 
Stories about passion, injustice, pain, romance and heartbreak filled Vender Vennet auditorium during the SMC Monologues per­formed this past weekend. 
The Monologues used stories submitted by Saint Mary's stu­dents. 
"It means a lot to me being able to act in the Monologues because you make people aware of the things that for some hit really close to home -especially since these are stories submitted by our own," freshman Anabel Castaneda said. 
Saint Mary's junior Britt Hall said she believed the SMC Monologues needed to be told. 
"The Monologues are important for Saint Mary's students to hear," Hall said. "They are our stories from our students, so I feel it is my responsibility to get these stories out there." 
The students who participated in this year's Monologues said they were touched by the sto,ries. 
"I am moved by all the stories in a new way each time I hear them and see other people react to them," SMC Monologues director Becki Faunce said. 
"When I am choosing one to perform myself, I always try to choose a funny one because I love making the audience laugh. 
Sometimes, we need to cry togeth­er over a painful story, express our rage about injustice, but one of the most powerful ways to change the world and ourselves ·is to laugh," she said. 
The piece Castaneda portrayed was about heartbreak. 
"The hard part is knowing when it's okay to laugh," she said. "Many of these pieces are serious, but crying and feeling sorry for each one of them doesn't help anyone." 
Participating students faced many challenges while preparing their pieces for the performance. 
"The most difficult part is defi­nitely making sure that we do not change the stories in any way," Hall said. "We need to portray these stories the way the writer would like it to be portrayed." 
Despite some struggles, Faunce, Hall and Castaneda said they all felt the experience was worth­while. 
"My favorite part of working on the Monologues is being a part of this great women's movement on campus to share our experiences and combat inequality together," Faunce said. 
"I am continually amazed by how we are all part of this com­munity of strong, powerful women who are all united by the drive to work toward a just future for everyone."

Subway in LaFortune as a fran­chise. 
"Subway restaurant in LaFortune is an independent fran­chise owned and operated by Notre Dame," Prenktowski said. "Notre Dame ... has at times par­ticipated and at other times has chosen not to participate in pro­motions. This is not unusual ­franchise restaurants everywhere choose to participate or not based on the value assessment of the promotion." 
Prentkowski explained that pricing decisions are the responsi­bility of the franchisee, and this law also applies to promotions. 
"There are other Subway fran­chise restaurants that have cho­sen not to participate in this pro­motion," Prentkowski said. 
Notre Dame Food Services believes that offering the $5 foot­long at Notre Dame's Subway would prevent the francliisee from meeting its financial obligations, Prentkowski said. 
"A financial analysis and projec­tion for this promotion concludes that it would have a negative financial impact on the LaFortune Subway, risking the restaurant's ability to reach its financial obliga­tion," he said. 
Prentkowski said the Notre Dame Subway restaurant "is one of the busiest in the United States serving approximately 6,000 peo­ple per week." It is so busy, in fact, that capacity limits "prohibit our ability to add new business," he said. 
Since the $5 footlong promotion is meant to attract new business, this would ultimately have a detri­mental effect to the LaFortune Subway "resulting instead in a negative margin and risk of not meeting financial obligations" since the restaurant is at full capacity, he said. 
Because Subway's business is much slower when classes are not tion costs all year long. 
"It is important to understand that while it appears restaurants such as Subway are very busy, this is not the case all year around. When classes are not in session, business is substantially less. As a result, revenues gener­ated during the academic year are required to support ongoing costs during the down times," he said. 
Prentkowski said the University "compensates its staff at a sub­stantially higher pay rate than a typical quick service restaurant." Not only is compensation higher, but regular Huddle staff members participate in the University health insurance program which also adds "substantial costs" to the operation. 
Operating costs include things such as food, labor, supplies, facili-· ty costs, renewal costs used for equipment replacement and reno­vations. Also included in operation costs are the franchise's responsi­bility to assist with funding gener­al University support functions such as payroll, human resourcfls, accounting and fmancial services, Prentkowski said. 
The question remains whether the Subway boycott initiated by Traub will atrect Subway's busi­ness. 
Prentkowski said he has "heard from a few students" about their dissatisfaction with Notre Dame's Subway for not offering the $5 footlong promotion, but said that Notre Dame Food Services is more worried about students getting the wrong perception of the depart­ment, than they are about the boycott taking effect. 
"We are concerned that not par­ticipating in this promotion has created the wrong perception of our department as we are com­mitted to enhancing the student experience at Notre Dame," he said.

Suspected U.S. missiles kill seven 
ISLAMABAD -Suspected U.S. missiles killed seven people in a Pakistani Taliban stronghold Sunday, officials said, while an attaGk on a military convoy and a cleric's two-week deadline for the creation of Islamic courts rattled peace talks with militants else­where in the country's northwest. 
The missile strike underscored the Obama administration's unwillingness to abandon a Bush-era tactic said to have killed several key al-Qaida figures, despite persistent Pakistani protests. The Muslim nation has used both peace pacts and military offensives to deal with insurgents along its border with Afghanistan, and it warns that the missile attacks dent civilian support for its actions. 
Israel threatens painful response 
JERUSALEM -Prime Minister Ehud Olmert threatened a painful response to Palestinian rock­et fire menacing southern Israel, suggesting Sunday that the blistering offensive against Gaza Strip militants fell short of its goals. 
The prospect of heightened hostilities in Hamas-ruled Gaza cast a pall over a week of cru­cial diplomatic activity, including an international conference designed to drum up billions of dollars to rebuild the heavily damaged territory. With a new Israeli government to take office within weeks, however, it wasn't clear how sweeping the country's response to the rockets would be. 
More than 110 rockets and mortar shells have exploded in Israel in the six weeks since it ended it<; air and ground onslaught against Gaza, which was meant to end the rocket threat and stanch the flow of arms into Gaza. So far, Israel has responded to the rocket fire mainly with airstrikes targeting underground tunnels used to smuggle weapons and other goods into Gaza from Egypt.

BASTROP, Texas -A wildfire fueled by griJ.ss, brush and trees has destroyed at least 23 homes and three businesses in central Texas. 
Officials say two National Guard helicop­ters joined other aircraft Sunday in dropping water on the blaze near the towns of Bastrop and Smithville. 
Gov. Rick Perry has activated state resources, including four Blackhawk helicop­ters equipped to drop water and fire retar­dant, firefighters and equipment. 
The wildfire has charred just over a square mile since it was started Saturday by a fallen power line. 


Washington state allows lethal meds 
OLYMPIA, Wash. -Terminally ill patients with less than six months to live will soon be able to ask their doctors to prescribe them lethal medication in Washington state. 
But even though the "Death with Dignity" law takes effect Thursday, people who might seek the life-ending prescriptions could find their doctors conflicted or not willing to write them. 
Many doctors are hesitant to talk publicly about where they stand on the issue, said Dr. Tom Preston, a retired cardiologist and board member of Compassion & Choices, the group that campaigned for and sup­ports the law.

Facebook and post-graduation plans

In mid-February, Facebook worried users anew when the site changed its terms of use, deleting language which said Facebook's right to content 

Facebook members to fear that the site retained a permanent license to their content. Alarm throughout the Facebook com­munity prompted Zuckerberg to return the terms of use to the language in place before the Feb. 4 change. 
In a blog post on the site Feb. 18, Zuckerberg said the site developers will be working with the Facebook community to create an updated terms of use that is more amenable to users. 
Lee Svete, the director of the Notre Dame Career Center, has watched the evolution of the site from a social networking site to one that has the oppor­tunity to be used for profession­al networking. 
Svete, who has worked in his position for eight years, said he first heard about the site in the summer of 2005. It wasn't until the following year that he start­ed to hear about it from mem­bers of Notre Dame's Employee Advisory Board, which includes companies like Accenture, Boeing, Johnson & Johnson and General Mills. 
dent information was out there," he said. "Our particular group did not go out to sP.ek students to see if they were doing anything not profession­al. They stumbled on that par­ticular fact." 
At the May 2007 National Association of College Employers conference, Facebook was discussed at the director level. 
"We were advising students at that particular point, not to put up social related comments and pictures on their Facebook account, because it could be viewed by prospective employ­ers," he said. 
The Career Center included a slide about social networking sites in some of its workshops, like ones on interviewing, job searching and networking, Svete said. 
Notre Dame has not had an incidP.nt where a job or intern­ship offer was rescinded because of a Facebook prob­lem, Svete said, but he knows that Michigan State's and Ohio State's career centers have had College Employers' 2008 con­ference, they discussed advis­ing students on using "common sense" on Facebook, so not posting inappropriate pictures or text about drugs, explicit sexual encounters, alcohol use or drinking tickets, Svete said. 
But at the same time career centers have been urging stu­dents to exercise common sense when putting information on Facebook, some employers were realizing they could attract potential employees to their companies through Facebook 
"There is a portion of Facebook evolving into that professional, career network," Svete said. He belongs to a Facebook group composed of more than 1,000 recruiters, and he said he used it the other day to find a potential job lead for a Notre Dame engineering student. Svete said the job lead is a positive start, and one that came about because of Faeebook. 
"I wouldn't have done that two years ago," he said. "No

Gordon Wishon, Notre Dame's Chief Information Officer, Associate Vice President and Associate Provost, has Facebook but said he does not use it often. He said he recog­nized the benefits and draw­backs of the networking tech­nology. 
"Facebook has proven to be a wonderful thing for students especially, but really for every­one, in many ways, to bring communities closer together, as a way for people to stay in touch with each other," he said. "While it provides many bene­fits, all of these services also represent some risk, and I would just urge all of your readers to be aware of, educate yourselves about he risks and take appropriate steps to pro­teet themselves against these risks."

More television ads project images of racial harmony 
Associated Press 
Ever see an inner-city school­yard filled with white, Asian and black teens shooting hoops? Or middle-aged white and Latino men swigging beer and watching the Super Bowl on their black neighbor's couch? Or Asians and Latinos dancing the night away in a hip-hop club? 
All it takes is a television. 
Yes, that mesmerizing mass purveyor of aspiration, desire and self-awareness regularly airs commercials these days that show Americans of different races and ethnicities interacting in integrated schools, country clubs, workplaces and homes, bonded by their love of the prod­ucts they consume. 
Think about one of Pepsi's newest spots, "Refresh Anthem," which debuted during the Super Bowl. The ad, which features Bob Dylan and hip-hop producer will.i.am, is a collage of images from the '60s and today that cel­ebrate generations past and present. 
Whites and blacks are shown returning from war, surfing, skateboarding, dancing and wav­ing American flags at political rallies, while a boyish Dylan and a present-day will.i.am take turns singing the Dylan classic, "Forever Young," each in his sig­nature style. 
Or, take the latest hit spot from E ... TRADE, which stars the E ... TRADE Baby, a 9-month-old white boy, and his newest buddy -a black infant who, from his own highchair, agrees with the wisdom of online investing even in a down economy.

Ads like these are part of a subtle, yet increasingly visible strategy that marketers refer to as "visual diversity" -commer­cials that enable advertisers to connect with wider audiences while conveying a message -that corporate America is not just "in touch," racially speaking, but inclusive. 
It wasn't always like this. For much of the past century, "minorities were either invisible in mainstream media, or handed negative roles that generally had them in a subservient position," says Jerome Williams, a profes­sor of advertising and African­American studies at the University of Texas at Austin. 
"Today, you're starting to see a juxtaposition of blacks and whites together, doing the things people do ... Now, advertisers are not in a position of pushing social justice. But to the extent that they can put whites and blacks together in situations, I think that's a good thing." 
These "multiculti" ads may be evidence of the vitality of assimi­lation, America's distinctive, master trend. To advertisers, though, they're simply smart business -a recognition of a new cultural mainstream that prizes diversity, a recognition that we are fast approaching a day when the predominant hue in America will no longer be white. · 
"Going forward, all advertising is going to be multicultural by definition, because in most states, majority ethnic popula­tions will no longer exist," says Danny Allen, managing director at SENSIS, an ad agency in Los Angeles that specializes in reach­ing multicultural audiences through digital and online media.

Capitol Power Plant dims energy hopes 
WASHINGTON --As Congress tries to clean up the nation's energy sources and cut gases blamed for global warming, it is struggling to do so in its own backyard. 
The Capitol Power Plant, a 99-year-old facility that heats and cools the hallowed halls of Congress, still burns coal and accounts for one-third of the legislative branch's greenhouse gas emissions. For a decade, lawmakers have attempted to clean it up. 
In recent years, Congress has reduced its energy consumption. The steam and chilled-water power plant has become more efficient. It now burns more natural gas and only 35 percent coal, compared with 49 percent in 2007. 

Health care plan confuses employees 
WASHINGTON -The Obama administration rushed to include a health care safety net for laid-off workers in the recently signed stimulus bill, but has not told employers exactly how to make it work. 
A<; a result, tens of thousands of jobless people could wait months before getting help paying for health insurance that their employers previously had covered. 
"Too many people are still trying to figure this out," said Heath Weems, director of human. resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers. "There is a lot of confusion." 
At issue is the program called COBRA, the acronym for the law that allows workers to keep their company's health insurance plan for 18 months after they leave their job, if they pay the premiums. 
The policies are so expensive that only a minority of eligible workers sign up, often those with medical conditions that demand attention. Costs for a family of four can top $1,000 per month. 
A $25 billion provision in the stimulus bill aimed to cut COBRA's price tag, reducing its cost by 65 percent for workers laid off as far back as Sept. 1. 
The bill gives eligible workers 60 days to apply. Then they get the reduced-cost premium for nine months. 


AIG to get up to $30B more in Fed aid 
Company announces $60B in quarterly losses, to receive fourth gov't rescue 
Associated Press 

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -­Struggling insurer American International Group Inc. will receive up to $30 billion in additional federal assistance in the fourth government rescue of the company, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Sunday. 
The new infusion is intended to prop up AIG -­once the world's largest insurer --as it is expected to announce $60 billion in quarterly losses early Monday, the source said on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are still ongoing. 
The company, which is considered too large to fail, previously received about $150 billion in loans from the government, which now bas an 80 percent stake in the company. 
Under the new deal, the 
U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve would pro­vide about $30 billion in fresh capital to AIG from the government's Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP. The money would be provided as a standby line of equity that AIG could tap as its losses mount, the source said. 
AIG has already received $40 billion from TARP.

"It is members of our com­munity assaulting other mem­bers of our community," Rakoczy Russell said. 
Two Notre Dame students shared their experiences of sexual assault at the dinner. 
A survivor of sexual assault who wishes to remain anony­mous said she was raped at Notre Dame during her soph­omore year. 
"I was asked out on a real date off campus," she said. "We went bowling with his friends and had a late dinner at Steak n Shake." 
After dinner, she said he asked her to come hang out at his off-campus apartment. She decided to go, but made it clear there would be no sex. 
When they got to the apart­ment, she said they kissed, but eventually, she became uncomfortable. 
"He kept going and passed the point of no return," she said. "I attempted to push him off, but he was too heavy. It was the scariest thing I ever experienced." 
After that night, she said she convinced herself that he just lost control. She did not know if she was actually raped until she talked to a counselor on a sexual assault hotline and was told she had been date raped. 
She said she felt sick to her stomach and could barely eat. "I hated being alone in my head," she said. 
She said she sought help from the University Counseling Center, but did not share her experience with her friends. Because of this, her relationships with her friends suffered. 
"Some of my friends noticed how angry, disconnected and cynical I was," she said. "Each academic stress seemed to be magnified expo­nentially. I couldn't get a han­dle of my wildly swinging emotions." 

After se.veral months of counseling, she decided she was ready to tell her friends what she had been going through. She said sharing her experience was one of the most healing parts of the counseling process. 
"The week I told my friends was one of the happiest I have ever had," she said. 
She said she is still trying to come to terms with what hap­pened, but will continue heal­ing. 
"One day I will look back and see a very old scar, just a mark. It will always be there but it will not always hurt," she said. 
Senior. Kyle Rocca said she was raped when she was 14 years old. 
Rocca said she was assault­ed by her boyfriend, who was a year older than her. He had a bad reputation, but she believed she could set a good example for him. 
"He was sweet and charm­ing," she s~id. "But I always knew he wanted to have a more physical relationship. I wasn't ready for sex." 
She said they were hanging out in his bedroom, when all of a sudden, he was on top of

pounds," she said. "I was barely old enough to be get­ting my period." 
Rocca said she did not talk about the rape for a year, but eventually started mentioning it. 
"I did not want forever to be known as the girl who was raped," she said. 
She spent years hating her rapist, but eventually, she said he worked his way back into her life. She learned he had been exposed to pornog­raphy at a very young age, which scarred his perception of sexuality. 
"I don't excuse my attack­er," she said. "But what hap­pened to him got me thinking about this issue as a man's issue. I think we need to think about educating the males to

make this a human issue." 
Tim Latham, president of Men Against Violence, agreed that rape is an issue that should be dealt with by men as well as women. 
"Rape is not just a women's issue. For too long, it has been filed under that catego­ry, left to women to deal with," he said. 
Unfortunately, the majority of rapes are committed by men, Latham said. But men have the power to stop the violence. He advised men to step in when they see situa­
tions that look like they  are  
out of control.  
"As  men  we  are  in  a  far  

better position to speak to other men," he said. "Don't fall for garbage about 'cock­blocking.'" 
Anthropology professor Carolyn Nordstrom said she has worked in war zones and encountered rape and rape camps there. She said she encountered the healthiest attitude toward the violence of rape when working in Mozambique. 
"Mozambiquans do not see violence, especially sexual v·iolence, as natural, inescapable or in any way a given part of the human con­dition," she said. "From war to violence at home, they make no distinction." 
Nordstrom said the people of Mozambique see violence as an abuse of power, and they involve the whole com­munity in the healing process when an individual is a victim of violence. 
"Why are Mozambiquans so healthy?" she asked. "They talk, they share, they care for one another." 
This is a model any society should look to in order to cre­ate a world without rape, Nordstrom said.

She said she hoped the film would challenge the origins of beauty standards in American society. 
The film, recommended by the Academy for Eating Disorders, a professional organization to which Staples belongs, has been shown internationally and at other uni­versities across the nation, like Princeton. 
"Notre Dame students have a lot of passion and energy they can generate for change when stand­ing behind a social movement," Staples said. "We want to ignite that passion behind this issue." 
Staples, who came to the University as an eating disorders specialist in 2001, said treatment for eating disorders has been avail­able to students on campus before that time through a collaboration with offices like Health Services and the Athletic Department. 
Though there are many different varieties of eating disorders, they are defined at the most basic level as having one thing in common, according to literature released by the Counseling Center: "the normal pattern of eating when you are hungry and no longer eating when you are full is disrupted." 
They are more than just a prob­lem with food, and can lead to seri­ous problems in major areas of a person's life, due to the person's focus on weight, food and body image, according to the literature.

Anorexia nervosa, on the other hand, is not less prevalent, but fewer people who suffer from the eating disorder seek treatment because they may have lost a lot of weight and received positive rein­forcement about their body changes, Staples said. 
When treating these cases, Staples said "the most important thing is helping each student feel you are about them ... and creat­ing a relationship where they do not feel judged." 
Those suffering from eating dis­orders should know they are not defined by their behaviors, Staples said. 
"That's all they see about them­selves ... [in treatment] their world gets a little bit bigger and they see there are a.Spects to them besides their behaviors," she said. 
Most importantly, treatment offers a sense of hopefulness "that things can get better," she said. 
Anecdotally Staples said the number of cases of eating disor­ders reported at Notre Dame are probably comparable with the fig­ures at other institutions, but there are some contributing factors for eating disorders at the University for both men and women. 
Staples said she has noted an increase in the number of men and women coming to the University having had eating disorders in the past, which creates "unique chal­lenges." 
"They have been in treatment before, and Notre Dame is an envi­ronment of high achievers. It may be difficult for them to reach out and ask for help and acknowledge · that it's a problem," Staples said. 
The fact children develop eating disorders at younger and younger ages marks a cultural shift, Staples said. When she first started in the field, she said her clients were mostly in their rnid-20s and older, but while working in a private practice before coming to Notre Dame, she said she treated a client as young as eight years old. 
"When I grew up, " she said, "the messages in the media were not as strong. The· pressures to succeed begin at so much younger of an age, children's time is sched­uled." 
The showing of "America the Beautiful," a free but ticketed event, had the purpose of starting a dialogue, Staples said. 
The director of the film, Darryl Roberts, was present for a ques­tion and answer session. 
Staples said she hoped students in the audience would "question their own beliefs but start recog­nizing how we've internalized that it's easy to communicate about los­ing weight." 
The language we use on a day­to-day basis, she said, like callillg ourselves or others "fat," con­tributes to the problem. 
"On an individual basis, there are ways we can make a differ­ence. There is a way to talk about our bodies and food to engage in that discussion," she said.

GRC 
continued from page 1 
of violence, raising funds for local non-profit agencies invested in violence prevention and serving as a flagship for violence preven­tion at other Catholic colleges and universities as its main goals. 
The most prominent component of the VPI is Sexual Assault Awareness Week, which was held from Feb. 22 to March 1 and included events such as Notre Dame Take Back the Night and the Committee on Sexual Assault Prevention student forum. 
The establishment of the VPI has been a long time in the making, Heather Rakoczy Russell, the founding and current director of the GRC said. 
When the GRC first opened its doors, Rakoczy Russell, the then­rector of Pangborn Hall, said there was a situation on campus "where there were a lot of pockets of peo­ple doing work on these issues," she said, "but no one organized place where this was happening." 
During its first few years, those working at the GRC spent time try­ing to identify the players doing work on campus in relation to vio­lence prevention, identifying groups like student government, Men Against Violence, idND, Feminist Voice, the Progressive Student Alliance and CORE Council. 
The GRC, which falls under the Office of Student Affairs, works with other campus offices, like the Counseling Center, the Office of Alcohol and Drug Education, Health Services, Notre Dame Security Police and Campus Ministry, addressing violence issues in one way or another. 
"There came a point where we decided we probably could be doing more and certainly in a more cohesive fashion," Rakoczy Russell said. "If there's one rape on cam­pus, there's one rape too many." 
The aspect Rakoczy Russell said she is most proud of is that a stu­dent, one of her former residents, created the GRC. Many of the ini­tiatives taken on in the GRC today are brought about by students. 
The Firestarters, a group of undergraduate students who vol­unteer at the GRC, "help to really keep a pulse on what's going on in the student body," she said. 
In 2003, Kaitlyn Redfield, then a senator from Pangborn, was inter­ested about whether or not the University had an office to address relationships, gender and sexuality. 
After completing a study of top­20 national universities, she found that all of the formerly all-male institutions established women's centers or rape crisis centers when women first matriculated into the universities in the 1970s. 
"We were 30 years behind the curve," Elizabeth Moriarty, assis­tant director of the GRC said. "They thought of what would be the next wave -not just a women's center, but a gender rela­tions center." 
Her resolution to instigate the opening of such a center on cam­pus passed unanimously through the Campus llie Council; the GRC opened officially in the fall of 2004, with Rakoczy Russell serving as both Pangborn rector and director of the GRC. 
In September, Rakoczy Russell and Moriarty sat down with five students and asked them two questions: were current efforts enough, and were they efficacious? 
"We had forthright, honest and helpful conversations and estab­lished what the GRC and the University as a whole could be doing differently," Rakoczy Russell said. 
Of the five major goals of the VPI, the one that hadn't been touched by previous efforts was turning Notre Dame into a flagship for other Catholic institutions, she said. 
"If we really did this right, its something that could and should be replicated at other Catholic schools," Rakoczy Russell said. 
"We wanted to do things that were organic to Notre Dame, building on what's already happen­ing," she said, naming the produc­tion of "Loyal Daughters and Sons" as an example of something unique to the University that the GRC could share with other schools. 
The GRC hopes to create a fuller proposal for the VPI in the future, including "a curriculum that would run the entire gambit of the aca­demic year, featuring something every month," Rakoczy Russell said. 
The monthly curriculum would exclude December, she said, due to the final exam and winter break schedule. 
The VPI has three remaining ini­tiatives this spring: a writing work­shop Mar. 21, an experiential learning retreat Mar. 28 and a fes­tival on South Quad in April. The GRC also plans to participate in South Bend Take Back the Night, scheduled Apr. 23 during National Sexual Assault Awareness Month. 
The events, which mamly focus on story sharing, are organized on "the assumption that everyone has a story in their lives that needs to be heard by other people." 
"It's important for building a healthier community," Moriarty said. 
The theme ofVPI is based on the Scripture passage Ecclesiastes 3:1­8, which includes the verse "a time to heal." Rakoczy Russell said organizers didn't want the VPI to be seen as a series of ad hoc events, so they chose to utilize the Scripture as a unifying theme. 
The names of most events either derive directly from the passage or are titled in the spirit of the pas­sage, like "A Time to Write," the name for the writing workshop, she said. 
Sunday's residence hall and Basilica of the Sacred Heart Masses included a distribution of literature on the VPI and the· GRC to help raise awareness, bringing Sexual Assault Awareness Week to a close. 
In the past, Notre Dame has held a Sexual Assault Awareness Week during the month of April, but moving it to February has its bene­fits, Rakoczy Russell said. 
"Students can process and be a part of a community of support before the go their separate ways for summer vacation," she said. "Sometimes, the most poignant part ... it ends up being the first time survivors tell their stories out loud. They need that community."

So picture this: 
You walk into a house. The court­yard is heavily treed, and yet tiled. Grass sprouting from every crack. The tiles are often broken, never the same size. On the right, a makeshift wall composed of con­crete and old wine bottles supports a lopsided arch above, from which yet more unidenti­fied weeds grow. 
Next, walk through the round­ed wooden door, only to misjudge your first step, your right foot landing heavily in an ovular impres­sion. Did someone lie on the floor while the mortar was still wet? Did the construction crew have a habit of dropping the occasion­al anvil or cannon ball? Were the foundations built on sinkholes? Or was the construction crew just blind? 
But that's not even it. You walk past the indoor rocky fountain (sanitary?) up the aged spiral staircase and on to the second floor, where you are there to greet yourself in three different­sized and asymmetrical mirrors. The middle of these is smashed, reflecting to you a Picasso-esque version of your face. Trees grow out of the walls, dirt nearly spilling over the floor. 
The catch? You paid to get in here.

Why? 
Because it's beautiful. 

They say (whoever "they" are, which 
is probably more "we" anyways, so 

rather, "we say ..."),that beauty is in 
the eye of the beholder. And yet, I 

would venture to say that the aesthetic 
qualities of this house extend beyond 
personal preference to an almost uni­
versal inner sense of harmony. 

The house you virtually -or literar­
ily? -walked through was the 
1-Iundertwasser House in Vienna. 

Friedrich Hundertwasser (freed-rick 
hoon-dehrt-vass-her) was a twentieth­
century artist who transferred his 

ideas of artistic expression and natu­
ral balance to the realm of architec­
ture. 

He based his theories of art, archi­
tecture and life on the human need for 
the "natural," for the unmanufac­

tured. His a'ppeallies in his advocacy 
of manufacturing the unmanufac­

tured, making something as civilized 
and potentially cold as a city into a 

piece of nature and universal harmo­
ny. 

Living by the idea that "the straight 
line is Godless," a mere creation of 

man, Hundertwasser's lopsided build­
ings contain irregularly shaped tiles of 
brown, blue and green on uneven 

floors whose wall houses enough dirt 
to grow a tree that then escapes from 
the house into the open air. 

It's beautiful. I can't even describe 
the happiness of walking into a house 
that feels like Dr. Seuss drew it. 

What's truly amazing, though, is that 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Who needs m.eat? 
I write in response to Mr. Lionetti's Feb. 27letter "Where's the Meat?"' While you raise an excellent point concerning the University's decision not to serve meat in the dining halls on Ash Wednesday and Fridays during Lent, I must respectfully disagree. 
It may be fair to criticize Notre Dame for seemingly making the decision for us. However, it would completely go against our Catholic faith tor her to do otherwise and thereby tempt us with meat. Furthermore, rather than portraying us students as not being "responsible enough to take notice of the day of the week and remember to abstain from consuming meat," doesn't this deeision demonstrate the University's faith that her students (the majority of which are practicing Catholics) would natural­ly want to observe days of fasting? 
Notre Dame is not trying to enforce Catholic tradition upon her students, but is rather helping us along our Lenten journey. We are only young students and are still in need of spiritual maturation. After all, did not Blessed Basil Moreau believe it important to educate the mind and the heart? 
That being said, if denying dining hall meat on A.c;h Wednesday and Lenten Fridays is imposing "a belief-based decision on all studentc;," then couldn't we say the same for a lot of other Notre Dame traditions? What about the Crucifixes in every class­room or the theology requirements? From how I see it, we should applaud the University of Notre Dame for being strong in her Catholic faith and helping us stu­dents grow in ours as well.

this "beautification" of our gray indus­
trial worlds is not only possible, but 
also happening all over the world. 
Also in Vienna, Hundertwasser 
designed an industrial plant whose 

gold and blue tower actually functions 
to power the city. Grass roofs in 

Chicago and other cities all over the 
world are springing up (pun intended), 
helping to mitigate the urban heat 

island effect while providing natural 
sanctuaries for the city dweller. 

The ecologically friendly, the beauti­
ful, the fun. It doesn't always have to 
be expensive -things as simple as 

decorating your own house with self­
made crafts, knitting a hat or blanket 
instead of buying one, planting a gar­
den in your front yard or having an 
herb garden in your kitchen, can add 
character to where you live and per­
sonalize it. Such projects take time, 
yes, but so does watching TV, and art 
is probably even more therapeutic. 

Who are we as a people, as a culture, "when all that we know is the mass­
produced and uniform? Bring a little 
personality into your life, a little 

nature. Let it make you happy just by 
looking at it.

Racism. at Notre Da111e 
Thank you to Associate Dean Stuart Greene ("Let's talk honestly about race," Feb. 24) for his challenge to the student body to talk about race. America's past does indeed have many things that we aren't proud of, but what about here on Notre Dame's campus? As some of the brightest stu­dents in the nation (or so we like to think), are we above racism? 
I would like to offer a greater chal­lenge: to move beyond academic analysis of racism, classism and sex­ism on an impersonal and national level and begin talking about it the context of how it affects us -here and now. You can join the conversa­tion and help inspire real change with Sustained Dialogue.

A return to big government? 
"From everything I've seen, it looks like the era of big government spending is back," stammered an evidently shocked and horrified Rep. John Boehner after wit­nessing Barack Obama's first address to a joint session of Congress. Arkansas Ben Linskey Governor Mike Huckabee went further, Guest proclaiming that "a Columnist Union of American Socialist Republics is being born." 
One would be forgiven for wondering whether these gentlemen have been living in some sort of alternate universe for the past eight years. As most of us residing in the real world know, the "era of big gov­ernment spending" isn't back-it never went anywhere to begin with. And ifMike Huckabee is correct in his comparison of the United States to the USSR, then one might say that George W. Bush is our nation's very own Vladimir Lenin. 
Perhaps conservatives could use a quick reminder of the Bush administration's actions over the past eight years. George 
W. Bush oversaw an unprecedented growth in federal spending, culminating in a record $438 billion deficit during his last year in office. He "spent more taxpayer money on issuing and enforcing regula­tions than any previous administration in 
U.S. history," concluded George Mason economist Veronique de Rugy in an analy­sis published in the Jan. 2009 issue of Reason magazine. Bush embroiled the U.S. in two wars in the Middle East, neither of which has yet reached a conclusion. The Iraq War, in particular, was premised on lies and has cost more than 4,000 U.S. lives and one trillion dollars. Bush consistently displayed contempt for the Constitution's guarantees of civil liberties, asserting his administration's authority to indefinitely detain U.S. citizens without trial. He over­saw a new prescription drug benefit, signed into law the disastrous No Child Left Behind Act and gave his stamp of approval to an unconstitutional expansion of cam­paign finance regulations which stifled Americans' right to free political speech. And in the final months of his administra­tion, Bush conspired with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to bail out failing Wall Street firms and put America's banks on the road to nationalization. Does that look like small government to you? 
Let's compare this record to the Obama administration's actions to date. Mr. Obamajust signed a $787 billion stimulus bill that will further increase the spiraling national debt. He's made it clear that his administration intends to further expand costly regulations. Thankfully, Obama has announced a plan to withdraw all U.S. forces from Iraq by the end of 2011, but he has decided to send 17,000 additional troops to Afghanistan. Meanwhile, his administration has already stepped up U.S. military activity in Pakistan. 
Obama doesn't seem to think much more highly of the Constitution than his prede­cessor, either. Though he has ordered the closure of the prison at Guantanamo Bay, his administration does not plan to signifi­cantly alter Bush's policy of indefinitely holding prisoners deemed part of the "war on terror." Nor has the Obama administra­tion indicated that it will end the practice of"rendition," the procedure by which individuals are kidnapped by the CIA, taken to secret overseas prisons and tor­tured. Furthermore, the administration's lawyers recently mirrored the Bush admin­istration by invoking the unconstitutional state secrets privilege in a terrorism case, much to the surprise of the presiding judge. All the while, the government's stake in major U.S. banks is growing and President Obama is just beginning to reveal his plans for a host of new domestic programs. This all seems awfully familiar, no? 
What are we to make of these striking similarities? Neither Republicans nor Democrats want you to know this, but the truth is that the two major parties funda­mentally agree on most basic issues. Both are more than willing to accept an ever­expanding state ifit means reelection in November. Think back to the last few cam­paign seasons. When was the last time you heard candidates debate the fundamental questions of the proper size and role of government? You probably never did. 
Instead, politicians routinely focus on the divisive and ultimately meaningless "cul­ture wars" and accuse each other of being communists or reflexive free market ideo­logues. (If only the latter were true!) 
Next year, we will once again go to the polls for Congressional elections. When that time comes, ignore the candidates' words and look at their records. With the exception of a select few individuals, nei­ther Democratic nor Republican politicians have any interest in shrinking the size of government. Americans deserve better than the cyclical dishonesty of the two­party system. But we can only escape ifwe stop casting our votes for the big-govern­ment demagogues of the left and right. So in the future, don't waste your time hoping for "change" from the Democrats or the GOP. If you want an end to unrestrained spending, endless regulation, destructive foreign policy, tyrannical abuse of civil lib­erties and incessant government meddling in the economy, vote for the only party that supports shrinking the size and scope of government across the board. Vote Libertarian.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Dedication and sacrifice 
Anyone who has known Chris Hine during the last four years has learned at least two things about him: 1. He is a huge fan of Carole King and will tell you more about this woman-a person I surmise many of you never knew existed-than you would care to know; 2. He has sacrificed more time, energy and sleep for The Observer than any person on this campus. 
Although I have no way of verifYing this state­ment, in all likelihood Chris shouldered an even greater load than most former Editors-In-Chief, as he continued to cover and write articles on both the basketball and football teams, despite taking over the newspaper's top position. Ifmeasured in time alone, Chris' commitment to The Observer far exceeded even what was expected of him. Even still, evaluating his commitment solely on the hours he logged still falls short of doing justice to how much of himself Chris invested in The Observer. 
I wrote that last sentence because of just how much Chris cared. He cared about putting out a respectable newspaper each day; he cared about writing articles that objectively evaluated athletes, coaches and students while bearing in mind that they were still members of the Notre Dame com­munity; he cared about treating the rest of the staff fairly. Simply stated, Chris Hine cared ... a lot. 
Maybe some of you, because of either experi­ence in high school or through having friends who work at The Observer, can appreciate all that goes in to producing a paper each weekday. This letter is for those of you who might not. Up until this past year, I realized I, too, had no idea. So next time you see a typo or a mix-up with a story's "jump line" (what I learned as the term for the directions when a story continues on to another page), maybe remember that the mistake was very likely made while we were sleeping. And ifyou happen to see Chris around, maybe say a brief thanks for his hard work. He deserves it.

Personal responsibility, ladies 
I'm writing today to express my frustration with my sex on this campus. We've learned a lot lately about sexual assault, healthy relationships, etc.; it's time to apply what we've learned, folks. To my ladies on campus: Stop complaining about your so­called "Notre Dating." I was once told by a great movie that "every woman has the exact love life she wants." I understand that sometimes inno­cent<; are taken advantage of, and that does hap­pen ... but seriously, ladies, it's time to take some personal responsibility. You complain about those guys you can't get to commit and that you can't date people and you can't get your ring by spring. Maybe you're looking in the wrong place. Stop blaming every relationship problem you've ever had on guys. That is idiotic. 
Let's take the plunge and say you're not getting the attention from your guy that you want. Fine, find someone else. There are plenty of fish in the sea, ladies. As they say, ifyou can't love the one you want, love the one you're with. I'm sure that there is that really sweet guy in Philosophy that has been giving you puppy dog eyes that you ignore constantly. Maybe give him a chance. Maybe he wants to be dating, too. 
I write this to you all because I'm proud of the men and women this University educates and I think maybe you should get out of your usual social circles to find the people you can really con­nect with. I say this with almost four years behind me at this University. I've had the random hookups (they are a part of life ... just get used to it), I've had the casual dating relationships, I've had more serious relationships and I've had broken hearts. It's a part of finding the person you're supposed to be with. So he hurt your feelings. It sucks. Get over it ... play some Taylor Swift really loud and move on. Stop blaming someone else, take it as a part of life and a lesson and try again. 
Also, ifyou're going to complain about watching them play Halo, think of all the times that you have stolen the remote in his room (much to the chagrin of his roommates) and made him watch "Ace of Cakes" or "What Not to Wear." Heck, learn how to play Halo. It's not such a bad game. Now please ... stop complaining about your love life in The Observer and take some personal responsibility.

Don't bla111e the boys 
As I guy, I'd like to speak for the gentlemen of the Notre Dame campus in response to Katherine McKackin's Feb. 27letter, "He's just not that into you: Notre Dating" and every letter addressing the same issue. First of all, guys are not villains looking to screw up girls' lives, as has been recently suggested in letters concerning the hook-up culture at Notre Dame. Just as girls are able to complain about guys being hard to get, I can speak for myself and many other men that we can claim the exact same thing about girls. So, ladies, you must ask yourself ifwhat I say is true and guys aren't really all that much worse than girls, what are we, boys and girls, doing wrong? 
Well, we're looking in all the wrong places. If guys and girls believe that they can find possibility for a substantial relationship at a modern day party, I'm sad to say they'll be sorely mistaken. As most people know, our culture here in the U.S. is obsessed with instant gratification. We want pleasure and sensation right now and we want a lot of it (Did I mention we want it now? And a lot of it?). This culture of immediate satisfaction is most obviously noticeable at college parties. Girls dress as loosely as they want, guys act like macho sex-addicts and you have a recipe for disaster. 
So what does this have to do with Notre Dame's relationship ailments? This is where we all look for a guy/girl. Occasionally, there will be the exception of a guy"and a girl meeting at a party and having a substantial relationship, but just about everybody there is after the free-flowing booze and hook-ups, hook-ups, hook-ups. This is because we want that instant gratification and we know just where to get it. But do we know where to go for a meaningful relationship? 
If you consider yourself close to your faith, I suggest daily Mass at the Basilica. Ifyou don't care too much for religion (which is fine), get involved with a club, nights at Legends, AcoustiCafe, sporting events ... this list con­tinues. Bottom line: It is ridiculous to complain, guys and girls alike, about not being able to find anyone when the only place you're willing to look is your local off-campus s*** show. So ifyou're looking for a hook-up, go to an off-campus party. If you're looking for a meaningful relationship, look else­where. ·

CENE 
Monday, March 2, 2009 


Dear Observer: 

After almost !'our years of writing, editing, planning and stressing, I think we're going our separate ways. I hate to say it, but it's not you Analise Lipari-it's me. 
So whywould I do Scene Editor such a thing? 
Well, this is my last week as your Scene Editor, and I'm afraid that our time together is up. 
I mean, hey-I'll still write, I'll still call, and I'll probably still work a few shifts to pick up a paycheck, but our rela­tionship is just going to have to change. 
You can't expect me to write quite as much as I used to write, especially on those Sunday nights when I hadn't planned any articles and your center pages were left blank and lonely, waiting for content. 
You also can't keep me from going to mass in my dorm any­more, courtesy of that pesky Sunday night shiftthat I'll do my darnedest not to work. (Hurrah!) 
Try not to cry. I know it'll be tough on you, because we've been together for a long time now. I've seen the ups and downs of arts and entertain­ment, both in and around Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and beyond. (Heck, I even wrote a column once from London. 
That's, like, a lot of' miles.) I've 
written reviews, columns, and 
everything in between. I've 
seen artists ranging from the 
Soweto Gospel Choir to the stu­
dents of PEMCo, and it's been a 
privilege to share it all on 

these two center pages. · But you know, I'd be lying if I 
said our parting wasn't a little 
weird. I think it's safe to say 
that you took up a significant 
chunk of my time here as an 
undergrad, and you don't just 
walk away from that kind of 
commitment. 
Also, even though I know my 
humble section takes up way 
less space than your other 
departments, you always gave 
us color pages, 3 days a week. 
Score . 
Plus, I know you'll haunt me 
for years, encouraging me to 
look up your Web site long 
after I've graduated. 
And I know as soon as I visit 
campus again, I'll head 
straight to one of your news 
boxes and pick up a spare 
copy, feeling reminiscent. 
One day, my grandchildren 
may ask me about my crazy 
life as a college student, and 
I'll tell them about all the fun 
times we had back in the 
office, slaving over Quark or 
using unlicensed photos in my 
spreads. 
But in all seriousness, we've 
had a really good run. When I 
look back on my time at The

Observer, I'll remember the people I've met and the work I've done. You gave me some amazing opportunities, and invaluable experience. You made me a better, more suc­cinct writer, and you gave me something pretty darn cool to do with my time. 
Still, it's time to move up and move out. I'm graduating in May, and my time as an editor with you is officially over by Saturday. Even if I'm neither completely happy nor totally ready to leave, sometimes you've got to move on. 
You know, Cole Porter once wrote a song called "Every Time We Say Goodbye." Artists from Nina Simone to Robby Williams have crooned the same lines, regretting that they'll be parted from their sig­nificant other of choiee. 
"Every time we say goodbye, I die a little I Every time we say goodbye, I wonder why a lit­tle." 
Well, Observer, thankfully our goodbye won't be any­where near that intense. But to tell you the truth, I'm really starting to feel it. 
Thanks for the memories, Observer. I'll see you around.

Shaq, Suns triun1ph 118-111 in meeting of All-Star MVPs 
Pistons hand Celtics first home Eastern Conference loss; Hornets win in final minute of 99-96 thriller against Jets 
Associated Press 
PHOENIX -Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant were domi­nant forces on the same court where they were All-Star Game co-MVPs three weeks ago. 
Give this one to Shaq and the Suns. 
O'Neal scored 33 points and Phoenix overcame Bryant's 49­point performance to beat the Los Angeles Lakers 118-111 on Sunday. 
Matt Barnes added 26 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists as the Suns, without Steve Nash for the third straight game because of a sprained right ankle, defeated the Lakers for the first time in four tries this season. 
Pau Gasol added 30 for Los Angeles, loser of two in a row for just the third time this sea­son. 
"We're going through a peri­od right now where everybody's just kind of tired a little bit," Bryant said. "It happens.... Everybody kind of goes through it a little bit. And this two games, we've been playing lethargic. It's that point in the season where we kind of hit it. The key for us is to snap out of it." 
After his 45-point game against Toronto on Friday night, O'Neal has consecutive 30-point games for the first time since March 5-7, 2004, when he and Bryant were teammates in Los Angeles. 
"It's what I do," O'Neal said. "I've been doing it since 1992. If you don't believe it, Google 
me." 
O'Neal, who turns 37 on Friday, is the fourth player over 35 in NBA history to score at least 33 points in consecutive games. The others are Michael Jordan, Karl Malone and Alex English. 
"A lot of people thought I lost it," O'Neal said. "It's kind of funny to me, when I say 'I'm injured,' no one believes me. Last year I was injured and this year I'm feeling pretty good." 
Bryant was asked if O'Neal reminded him of the Shaq of old. 
"No, not quite," Bryant said. "But he's playing extremely well, obviously. The thing is they're looking for him, they're going inside to him. Tonight, I mean, Pau is giving up 250 pounds (a bit of an exaggera­tion). There's really not much he can do in that situation and Shaq took advantage of it." 

Bryant made 18 of a season­high 38 attempts in the 96th 40-point game of his career. He scored 17 points in a span of less than four minutes early in the second half. 
Leandro Barbosa added 22 points and Grant Hill 17 for the Suns, who improved to 6-2 since Alvin Gentry replaced the fired Terry Porter and returned the team to Mike D'Antoni's fast-paced style. It was the Gentry-led Suns' first win, though, over a team with a winning record. 
"Obviously a great win for us," Gentry said, "against what I think is still the best team in the le.ague." 
Entering Sunday night's com­petition, Phoenix was 1 1/2 games behind Dallas for the eighth and final playoff berth in the West, but only three behind Houston for the No. 4 spot. 
Coach Phil Jackson, whose team was coming off a 90-79 loss at Denver, said the Lakers' loss came at the free throw line, where Phoenix was 26-for­42 and Los Angeles 19-of-20. 
"It's tough to win when you gave up that many free throws," Jackson said. "We gave up 37 on Friday and 42 tonight. You know, that's tough." 
Detroit 105, Boston 95 
The Detroit Pistons are back to their old mainstays and back to their old, winning ways. 
Richard Hamilton had 25 points, Tayshaun Prince scored 15 and each hit a 3-pointer in the final 80 seconds to help the Pistons beat the Celtics on Sunday. Hamilton also had nine assists in his second straight start since Allen Iverson returned to Detroit because of a stiff back. 
"You can tell they're playing the system they played before Iverson got there," said Celtics forward Paul Pierce, who scored 26. "When Iverson is out there they're still trying to fig­ure out how to use each other, how to all be successful. But that group that's out there is definitely comfortable because they've _played together for years." 
Detroit had lost five straight regular season games to the Celtics -9-of-11 including a six-game Eastern Conference final that sent Boston on its way to a record 17th NBA title. The Pistons had lost eight in a row before snapping the skid on Friday night, when Hamilton scored 31 against Orlando. 

"We played our type of bas­ketball," he said. "That's the thing for me with Tayshaun, Rasheed (Wallace) and (Antonio) McDyess, I always know they're going to be at all times." 
The Pistons acquired Iverson from Denver two games into the season for former point guard Chauncey Billups, who led the Pistons to the confer­ence finals last year and won the finals MVP when they won the NBA title in 2004. But they began a freefall on Feb. 8 that didn't stop until Iverson was injured. 
Pistons coach Michael Curry said he didn't think Iverson was the problem. 
"It was nothing against the way Allen played," Curry said. "We just have to play the same way, and he has to play that way." 
Glen "Big Baby" Davis, start­ing in place of the injured Kevin Garnett, scored 18 and Pierce played all but 18 sec­onds as Boston lost to an Eastern Conference opponent at home for the first time this season. 
Detroit made a season-high 34 free throws, in 40 attempts. 
"This is the old Pistons we're playing now," Celtics coach Doc Rivers said. "The ball is hop­ping. They're playing together." 
New Orleans 99, New Jersey 96 
The quick hands of Chris Paul helped the New Orleans Hornets steal a victory from the New Jersey Nets. 
David West scored 32 points and Paul made two key steals in the final minute in the Hornets' 99-96 win Sunday night. 
"We made some extra-effort plays," West said. "We knew this was going to be a tough game for us, the way New Jersey had been playing. We wanted to come in here and try to steal one. Guys stepped up and made some big plays for us down the stretch defensively." 
Especially Paul. 
With the Nets leading by one with a minute remaining, Harris turned the ball over to Paul, who hit a 19-foot jumper to give the Hornets a 95-94 lead. 

On the Nets' following posses­sion, Brook Lopez tried to force a pass to Harris that Paul picked off for his seeond steal in the closing seconds. 
"It's an inbounds play we run too," Paul said. "Devin is under the goal and you know he's coming up to the top to get the ball. I tried to deny him and they hit Brook Lopez. Of course, Devin is going to get the ball back, so I reached a hand in there and tried to smack it away." 
The Nets turnover turned into a pair of free throws by Rasual Butler with 9.6 seconds left that clinched the win for the Hornets. 
"It's frustrating," Harris said. "We had two turnovers late, didn't get good shots at the bas­ket and they got great shots. We played fabulous all game long, the energy was there. The point-guard play has to be bet­ter late in the game." 
Butler had 22 points for the Hornets, who extended their winning streak to four. Offensively, Paul finished with 14 points and nine assists.

Associated Press 

CLEARWATER, Fla. ­
The Coast Guard searched 
off Florida's Gulf Coast on 
Sunday for a fishing boat 
carrying NFL players Corey 
Smith and Marquis Cooper 
and two other men missing 
more than a day in choppy 
seas. 

Smith, a defensive end 
for the Detroit Lions, and 
Cooper, an Oakland 
Raiders linebacker, were 
on a 21-foot vessel that left 
Clearwater Pass for a fish­
ing trip Saturday morning 
and did not return as · expected, the Coast Guard said Sunday. Crews used a 
helicopter and an 87 -foot 
ship to search a 750­
square mile area west of Clearwater Pass, but poor weather made the search difficult. Officials did not receive a distress signal from the missing craft. 
Cooper owns the boat and he and Smith have been on fishing trips before, said Ron Del Duca, Smith's agent. The pair had been teammates on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2004. Two others were aboard: Will Bleakley and Nick Schuyler, both former University of South Florida players. 
Coast Guard Capt. Timothy M. Close said the weather early Saturday had been fair, but wors­ened toward the evening as a front moved in. The National Weather Service said seas were about 2 to 4 feet Saturday morning and increased to 3 to 5 feet in the afternoon. Late Saturday night, a small craft advisory was issued, when winds were around 20 knots and seas were up to 7 feet or more. There were no thunderstorms in the area. 
Close said the men were traveling in a boat manu­factured by Everglades. At least one of the men was an experienced boater. and relatives provided the Coast Guard with GPS coordinates from previous fishing expeditions. 
Close said there was no communication with the men even before the weather started to pick up. They were expected home by early evening. No sign of them or the boat had been spotted by Sunday evening. Relatives told the Coast Guard the men had lifejackets and flares onboard. 

Po·or weather conditions could be dangerous for a boat the size of Cooper's. 
"A 21-foot boat is a rela­tively small vessel to be 50 miles off shore in bad weather conditions, cer­tainly the current weather conditions," Close said. 
Close said there was no sign yet that the men sent a distress signal.

NCAA BASKETBALL 
Michigan State takes share of Big 10 title with win 
No. 15 Kansas has 40th straight home victory with rout of No. 11 Missouri, takes control of Big 12 race 
Associated Press 
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. -With a share of the Big Ten title on the line and Illinois closing fast on what had once looked like a comfortable lead, Michigan State coach Tom Izzo put his faith and the ninth-ranked Spartans' fate in the hands of a little used grad student from Nigeria. 
Idong Ibok hadn't played since Feb. 17, and is averaging just over six minutes on the court this season. 
But with Illinois center Mike Tisdale coming to life in the sec­ond half and what had been an 11-point lead vanishing, Izzo said he had nowhere else to turn. 
"It was a panic decision," Izzo said. "When we couldn't handle Tisdale, Ibok did a great job and stepped up for us." 
Facing the 260-pound Ibok, Tisdale faded and Michigan State (23-5, 13-3) held on for a 7 4-66 win that guarantees the Spartans at least a share of the Big Ten championship. Only 16th-ranked Purdue (22-7, 11­
5) can catch the Spartans. 
Sunday's win came at the expense of a man Izzo called one of his best friends, Illinois coach Bruce Weber, who entered the game knowing a win kept the No. 20 Illini (23-7, 11-6) in the race for the title. 
Reporters, Weber said, asked him earlier in the week what he feared most about the Spartans. 
"I said Tom Izzo, because I knew he would have them ready to play," Weber said. "We spot­ted them a seven-point lead and we could never really catch up. We had to adjust but then we were playing catch up the whole time." 
That opening 7-0 run and the up-tempo pace the Spartans set from the tip-off put the Illini immediately on their heels. 
With 4:31 left in the second half, Illini forward Mike Davis sank a soft jump shot to cut the lead to 27-26. 
But 13 seconds later, Michigan State's Marquise Gray pushed the gap back to three with a layup and, with 4:01 left in the half, Raymar Morgan gave the Spartans a five-point lead, 31­26, on a layup of his own. 
Morgan had 14 points and Kalin Lucas led the Spartans with 18. 
"Their transition was so good and we weren't ready for that," Weber said. 
Lucas also provided for his teammates. He had four assists, including the pass that created Travis Walton's jump shot a minute into the second half, the one that gave the Spartans a 41­30 lead. 
"I thought we had a secure lead," Izzo said. 
At about that point, though, Tisdale and his hook shot changed the game. 
"We just told Mike at halftime, get your fanny down in the block, shoot your hook and make them block you," Weber said. 
Tisdale did, and the Spartans, for a time, couldn't do much about it. 
His last points, a pair of free throws, cut the lead to 56-53 with 8:51 left to play. 
Then, after a layup by Walton, a three-pointer by Illinois guard Trent Meacham and a layup by Jeff Jordan tied the game at 58 with 7:19 left. 
But Tisdale, thanks to Ibok, never scored again. Even though Michigan State didn't score again until a Lucas layup more than two and a half min­utes later, Illinois couldn't find the basket that would give it the lead. 
"We had opportunities," Illinois guard Chester Frazier said. "We had a lot of chances to tie, and take the lead. But the ball bounces that way some­times and they played great defense and took advantage." 
Michigan State outscored the Illini 16-8 down the stretch. Six of those points came from Lucas, four from the free throw line. 
The championship is Izzo's fifth in his 13 seasons at Michigan State. 
He said that, among his more successful seasons, this has been the toughest. 
"Defensively we were awfully good," Izzo said, adding that his team had to overcome both a tough crowd afld Illinois' defense, statistically the best in the Big Ten. "So maybe my team is growing up a little bit, because we controlled a decent amount of that game." 
No. 15 Kansas 90, No. 11 Missouri 65 
LAWRENCE, Kan. -Kansas landed an 18-1 knockout punch in the first 10 minutes, and then made sure Missouri didn't get back in the fight this time.Sherron Collins scored 25 points and dished out several key assists in the take-command run and the No. 15 Jayhawks took command of the Big 12 race by trouncing the 11th­ranked Tigers Sunday. 
Now, with a Wednesday night game at Texas Tech and a regu­lar-season finale at home Saturday against No. 25 Texas, the Jayhawks (24-5, 13-1 Big 
12) stand on the cusp of a fifth straight title in what was sup­posed to be an inexperienced team's transition season. 
"I'm falling in love with this team," coach Bill Self said. "They try hard and they're get­ting more and more aggressive all the time." 
Cole Aldrich had 19 points and 14 rebounds in a surpris­ingly lopsided win over the team that came back from a 14-point deficit to beat them 62-60 last month at Missouri. It was also the nation-leading 40th straight victory at home for the Jayhawks, who lost every starter from last year's NCAA championship team. 
"I think today was just one of those days that went well for us," said Collins, who also had six assists and five rebounds. "I think we had a tick in our ear after what happened in Columbia." 
Leo Lyons had 20 points and DeMarre Carroll had 16 for Missouri (24-5, 11-3), which had won seven in a row and exceed­ed last year's victory total by eight games.

MLB 
Rodriguez silent about MLB meeting 
Associated Press 
SARASOTA, Fla. -Alex Rodriguez kept his plans to himself. 
Rodriguez was lifted for a pinch runner in the fifth inning of the New York Yankees' spring training game Sunday and p~rhaps headed for a scheduled meeting with Major League Baseball offi­cials to discuss his admission of using performance-enhanc­ing drugs from 2001-03 with Texas. 
After coming out of the game, Rodriguez spoke with reporters but declined to dis­cuss when or if the meeting would take place. Then he got into a car with teammates Robinson Cano and Mark Teixeira and left the ballpark. 
Rodriguez did say he planned to be in Jupiter by Sunday night to join the Dominican Republic team for World Baseball Classic prepa­rations. He said the squad had a meeting scheduled for 9 a.m. Monday. 
''I'm not sure what I'm doing. But I will be in Jupiter tonight," Rodriguez said. 
"Opportunity of a lifetime playing in the WBC. I'm excit­ed about that." 
Be£ore the Yankees' game against Cincinnati, New York manager Joe Girardi declined to talk about Rodriguez's meeting with Major League Baseball, saying it was up to Rodriguez or MLB to discuss specifics. 
''I'm only talking about base­ball," Rodriguez said. ''I'm just excited that I have a game every day. That's where I belong. It's fun to be back out there." 
MLB wants to speak with Rodriguez about security issues involving a trainer from the Dominican Republic and the cousin the three-time MVP said injected him with a banned substance called "boli." 
A-Rod worked out at Steinbrenner Field for about 90 minutes before .boarding the team bus Sunday, which left Tampa at 9 a.m. He didn't talk to reporters after taking batting practice before the game against the Reds. He had a pair of RBI doubles in three at-bats. 
"I get to see my family tonight," Rodriguez said. ''I'm excited about that. My two beautiful girls." 
Rodriguez, after receiving a mixed ovation that had more boos than cheers, hit a run­scoring double in the first off Reds starter Aaron Harang. He fouled out in the third and had another RBI double against Arthur Rhodes in the fifth. 
To get ready for the WBC, Rodriguez and the Dominican Republic will play three pre­tournament games against major league teams starting Tuesday against Florida. 
"He's going to have to go through traveling and be on road trips eventually," Girardi said. "So, this can be a helpfttl thing in a sense. The fact he's going to play in different ball­parks might give us an idea of what's going to happen during the year, and it may not. It also might be a good thing for him to go through." 
Girardi thinks the support system Rodriguez has with the Yankees will also be in place during the WBC.

Dodgers to start over with Ramirez 
Associated Press 
PHOENIX The Los Angeles Dodgers have pulled their $45 million, two-year offer to Manny Ramirez, and owner Frank McCourt said Sunday that negotiations will have to start again from scratch. 
The Dodgers announced last week that Ramirez had declined the team's latest offer, a $25 million one-year contract for the 2009 season with a $20 million player option for 2010. McCourt said no talks with Ramirez's representatives were sched­uled for Sunday. 
"We're in what I call a transition phase," McCourt said before the Dodgers lost 3-2 to the Chicago White Sox in their first game at their new spring training facility at Camelback Ranch. "We had an almost four-month negotiation which terminat­ed on Thursday. Now were in a quiet period. At some point we'll pick up negotiations, but with a fresh start." 
_A message was left Sunday seeking comment from Scott Boras, Ramirez's agent. 
The issue separating the two sides appears to be how the $45 million will be paid out. The Dodgers wanted to defer payment of $10 million until 2011, $10 million more to 2012 and $5 million to 2013. 
Boras' latest proposal was for a $45 million, two-year deal with no deferred pay­ments. 
McCourt said Sunday that offer only came after Boras responded to the $45 million offer with a proposal for $55 million for two years. He said the Dodgers rejected that proposal. · 
"You can't get a no and then when the other side says, 'OK, we're going to start fresh,' you say, 'I meant yes,"' he said. "That's not how it works. It's too lit­tle, too late. It wasn't multi­ple choice." 
The owner also said Boras' suggestion that the deferred money proposal is keeping 
both sides apart is a red herring and the agent had encouraged deferred money to be paxt of the offers from the beginning. 
Despite the sometimes acrimonious exchanges between the two camps, McCourt also said he expects negotiations to resume soon. 
"We want to see Manny a Dodger this year," he said. 
Los Angeles carried a 2-0 lead into the ninth inning against Chicago but Gordon Beckham led off with a long home run_ off Victor Garate. The White Sox then loaded the bases, and Brandon Allen and Michael Restovich each drove in a run with a fielder's choice. 
Hiroki Kuroda, Eric Milton and Claudio Vargas threw two scoreless innings apiece for Los Angeles. Mark Loretta and Blake DeWitt had RBI singles. 
Mark Buehrle worked two scoreless innings for the White Sox. He struck out two, walked one and allowed one hit. 

are going to build that same 
wall," Girardi said. "It might 
take a couple days, but I have 
a feeling a lot of those players 
have come out and are behind 
Alex. I'm hoping that takes 
place. We'll have to see if 
that's the case." 
Girardi thinks Rodriguez has 
been able to handle the situa­
tion so far. 
"I think he's come through it 
very well," Girardi said. "I see 
him more relaxed every day. 
Really, the last five, six days I 
don't think he's changed a bit. 
Pretty much the same relaxed 
guy. The first couple days you 
could tell it was weighing 
heavily on his mind, and I'm 
sure it's still weighing on his 
mind, but time helps every­
thing. Probably knows how to 
approach it better now. I think 
he has done very well." 
Rodriguez said he has 
received phone calls and let­
ters of support heading into 
the WBC. 
"I've gotten tremendous sup­
port from not only the . Dominican community but the Hispanic community all over," Rodriguez said. "I think over­all it's going be very positive."

Irish lose two of three in Phoenix 
FENCING 

Team finishes second in conference 

By MATT GAMBER 
SportS Writer 
Notre Dame lost two of three at the Phoenix Classic over the weekend, topping host Dayton and falling to Gonzaga and Creighton. 
The Irish (3-3) started their weekend with a 7-3 loss to Gonzaga (5-1), as the Bulldogs scored two runs each in the eighth and ninth innings to break a 3-3 tie. Sophomore starter Cole Johnson allowed two earned runs in four innings in his first start of the year, and fellow sophomore Todd Miller took the loss by giving up three runs over four innings. 
Juniors David Mills and Matt Grosso each had two hits and an RBI for the Irish, who scored twice in the bottom of the first on a throwing error and an RBI groundout. 
The Bulldogs tied it with a pair of runs in the top of the second and then took a 3-2 lead in the top of the fifth. Notre Dame knotted the score 3-3 in the bottom of the sev­enth but Gonzaga again answered and then kept the Irish bats quiet in the final two frames. 
Senior Jeremy Barnes drove in three runs and four others each knocked in a pair in Notre Dame's 14-5 win over Dayton (2-4) Saturday. The bullpen also pitched in with 3 2-3 innings of scoreless relief after sophomore starter Brian Dupra gave up five earned runs over 5 1-3, striking out a career­high six Flyers to earn the win. 

Leading 5-1, the Irish offense exploded for seven runs in the top of the fourth with help from three run-scoring doubles -one from Barnes, who was a home run short of the cycle. 
Like Friday's loss, Sunday's 6-3 defeat included a late­inning rally by Notre Dame's opponent. Creighton (1-6) took a 4-3 lead with two outs in the top of the eighth when Irish junior right fielder Brayden Ashdown appeared to lose a routine fly ball in the sun au.d had it drop in front of him to allow the go-ahead run. 
The Bluejays would add two more insurance runs in the ninth. 
Juni.or right hander Steven Mazur took the loss after giving up four earned runs in 2 2-3 earnings. 
The Observer could not reach Irish coach Dave Schrage as the team traveled back to Notre Dame Sunday. 
Notre Dame will hit the road again this weekend, as the Irish are scheduled to play nine games in Houston and San Antonio, Tex., between March 6-15.

While the women's epee team opened with a 5-2 vic­tory to draw the series to 2-2 overall, Ohio State respond­ed quickly with a 5-2 victory in women's foil. The Notre Dame women's sabre team, a strength of the Irish, gave it their all, but lost a close 5-4 decision to clinch the victory for the Buckeyes. 
Notre Dame returns to the strip on Friday at the NCAA Midwest Regional Qualifiers at Ohio State's gym in Columbus.

Nevv Jersey goaltender Brodeur earns lOOth shutout 
Blackhawks end three-game skid with 4~2 defeat of Kings in Chicago; Niemi has 22 saves, wins first NHL start 
Associated Press 
NEWARK, N.J. -Martin Brodeur has found the New Jersey Devils have changed during his almost four-month injury absence. This is a team that not only plays defense, it scores early and often. 

Brodeur earned his 100th NHL regular-season shutout with a 27 -save effort, and the Devils extended their lead in the Atlantic Division with a 3-0 victory over the second-place Philadelphia Flyers on Sunday. 
The shutout was the second in three games since Brodeur returned Thursday following recovery from elbow surgery, and this one moved him within three of tying Terry Sawchuk's mark of 103. It was also Brodeur's 547th career victory, moving him within four of tying Patrick Roy's league record. 
"It's a big number, it's kind of hard to believe," Brodeur said of his shutout total. "You get to different numbers and at times you think, 'OK, it's just another one.' When you get to a round number, it looks more impres­sive.'' 
Brodeur has been very impressive in his return, post­ing two shutouts and winning three times in four days. He has stopped 46 ·of 48 shots, and has four shutouts in 13 games this season. 
"This is as good as it gets," he said. 

The potent scoring is defi­nitely new for Brodeur, who was used to winning one-goal games in helping the Devils capture the Stanley Cup three times, the last in 2003. 
New Jersey outscored Colorado, Florida and Philadelphia by a combined 14-2 margin since Brodeur returned. 
"Any goalie, that's your dream team in front of you, one that scores goals and is responsible defensively," the four-time Vezina Trophy win­ner said. "I don't think we are cutting corners in our own zone. We've been really disci­plined in these three games and that makes a big differ­ence in keeping the puck out of your net." 
Jamie Langenbrunner, Brian Gionta and Johnny Oduya scored as the Devils won for the eighth time in 10 games to open a nine-point lead in the division with 19 games left in the regular season. 
The loss was the fourth in 11 games (7-3-1) for the Flyers, who welcomed back Danny Briere to the lineup after he missed 36 games following abdominal-groin surgery. Philadelphia has played two fewer games than New Jersey. 
"Not a very good one from our part," Fly(\rs left wing Simon Gagne said. "If you shoot 25 or 26 shots, it's tough to win hockey games, especial­ly against Martin Brodeur. We did not test him enough and they got the best of us." 
After Brodeur had relatively easy wins over Colorado and Florida, the Flyers had several quality chances against the 36­year-old goalie. Philadelphia captain Mike Richards had the best two. 
Brodeur, who missed 50 games after having surgery to repair a torn biceps in his left elbow, protected a 1-0 lead when he slid across his crease to stop Richards in close after he was set up by Gagne. 
"I was by myself with Brodeur and saw Richie on the corner on the left side. I thought it would be open net for him," Gagne said. "I thought he read the play pretty good and Marty made a great save on that." 
Richards also had a deflec­tion early in the third period. 
Briere added a good wrap­around attempt during a first­period power play. Brodeur made a couple of good stops against Scottie Upshall late in the game. Brodeur saved the shutout stopping Mike Knuble in close with 5:46 to go. 
"I definitely feel more tested today than .any of the other games I played so far," Brodeur said. 
Chicago 4, Los Angeles 2 
CHICAGO -A fast start helped the Chicago Blackhawks put a timely end to a mini-slump. 
Jonathan Toews, Duncan Keith and Dustin Byfuglien scored in the first period, and Antti Niemi made 22 saves in his first NHL start to give the Blackhawks a 4-2 win over the Los Angeles Kings on Sunday. 
Dave Bolland added a power­play goal with 43 seconds left in the third as the Blaekhawks snapped an 0-2-1 skid and defeated the Kings for the first time in three games this sea­son. Chicago was beaten 5-2 twice in Los Angeles. 
The Blaekhawks have not gone more than three games without a win this season and haven't dropped more than two straight in regulation. That's been a key to Chicago's resurgence and why the Blackhawks are solidly in fourth place in the Western Conference. 
"When you lose three in a row, it gets your attention," Chicago coach Joel Quenneville said. "A good start was some­thing we were looking for, and getting that lead early helped." 
The Blackhawks jumped ahead 2-0 and 3-1 in the first before the Kings closed to 3-2 after 20 minutes. 
"It was a big win," Toews said. "In a lot of ways we played the same way we played as the last couple of games, but we were able to put three periods together and fin­ish it off. 
"We've found a lot of great ways to win games like this year when we've had losing streaks." 

Anze Kopitar scored and added an assist on Jack Johnson's goal in the third con­secutive loss for the fading Kings. Los Angeles, playing the fourth game of a five-game trip, entered six points behind eighth-place Anaheim and the postseason cutoff in the Western Conference. 
The Kings, who opened the trip with a 2-1 shootout win at Minnesota, are in a 1-5 skid. 
"We kind of shot ourselves in the foot," Kopitar said. "That first period wasn't good at all. When you fall behind right away, it kind of kills the moti­vation right off the hop." 
"We responded just OK," Kings coach Terry Murray said. "There's a great need to a lot of desperation right now in our schedule and our games. Getting down makes it really hard, especially in this build­ing. 
"They're (the Blackhawks) a great skating team. They could be a dangerous team in the playoffs." 
Toews has nine goals and four assists in his last eight games, and has taken over the team lead with 26 goals. He scored 24 goals in 64 games last season as a rookie. 
"Besides the production, he's been very effective for us," Quenneville said. "He's a spe­cial player and going to contin­ue to improve his game."

PGA TOUR 
Ogilvy defeats Casey for match play victory 
Associated Press 
MARANA, Ariz. -Geoff Ogilvy has been better than anyone in match play over the last four years. 
One of these days, he might find out if that includes Tiger Woods. 
Even without the world's No. 1 player around, Ogilvy finished off a remarkable weekend at Dove Mountain on Sunday with a 4­and-3 victory over Paul Casey to win the Accenture Match Play Championship for the second time in four years. 
He played 66 holes on the weekend in 25-under par. He never trailed the final 63 holes of this event, mowing down teenage sensation Rory Mcilroy and Stewart Cink on Saturday and never giving Casey a chance in the title match. 
"The thing I'll remember is I beat some really good players, and I beat them well," Ogilvy said. "I played better and better during the week. Every round, I played better, which doesn't often happen in golf." 
He saved his best against Casey, building a 3-up lead after the morning round, then pouring it on. 
"This afternoon, three birdies in the first eight holes and I still lost two holes," Casey said. "Geoff was exceptional." 
Cink defeated Ross Fisher in the consolation match with a birdie on the 18th hole for a 1-up victory. 
A tournament that began with so much buzz over Woods' return from knee surgery ended with a newfound appreciation for the skill and composure of Ogilvy, who ran his career record to 18­
3 in match play. Woods is 40-12-1 in his profes­sional career. Ogilvy was asked if he was the best in the world at match play. 
"This week I probably was. Last year, I was the 33rd best match-play player in the world," he said, referring to a first-round loss. "But I have played well in this tournament in the last few years. I'm obviously one of the better match-play players." 
He was quick to note, however, that Woods won three straight 
U.S. Junior Amateur titles and three straight U.S. Amateurs. He also knew at the start of the week that Woods was in his quarter of the bracket. 
"I think I would do OK," he said. "Hopefully, we can do it one day, for sure." 
Ogilvy won his third World Golf Championship-he will defend his title in two weeks at Doral in the CA Championship-the most of any player besides Woods, who has won 15 of these elite events. 
Ogilvy closed out the match with a 6-foot birdie on the 15th hole. He won $1.4 million and moved up to No. 4 in the world ranking with this third victory in his last seven starts. He started the year with a wire-to-wire win at Kapalua, and won late last year at the Australian PGA Championship. 
Casey came into the final match having led 79 of the 80 holes he had played in his five previous 18-hole matches. 
That amazing mark didn't last long. 
Ogilvy made birdie from 6 feet on the first hole, and when Casey failed to match him from 5 feet, it was the first time the Englishman had trailed all week. 
NBA 
LeBron, Cavs edge Hawks 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -LeBron James dribbled at the top of the key with the clock winding down, then made his move. What happened next was a matter of debate. 
AI Harford thought he played good defense. The officials decided otherwise. 
After the call went his way, James stepped to the line and made one free throw with 1.6 seconds remaining, just enough to give the Cavaliers their seventh win in eight games, 88-87 over the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday night. 
The Hawks, after rallying from a 13-point deficit, squandered a five-point lead in the final 1:42. Delonte West hit a jumper, Mo Williams sank a 3-pointer and James won it for the Cavaliers on their final pos­session. Driving from the top of the key, he threw up a shot that missed but Harford, standing in the lane with his arms up, was called for the foul. 
"It was unfortunate the way the game ended," Horford said, choosing his words carefully. "He came to me. I kept my arms straight. The refs felt it was a foul." 
James missed the first free throw but swished the sec­ond. The Hawks still had a chance after a timeout, but Joe Johnson's jumper over James clanked off the rim as the horn sounded. , 
The Cavaliers (46-12) moved a half-game ahead of Boston for the top spot in the Eastern Conference and eclipsed their win total from last season. Atlanta hurt its bid to maintain the fourth seed in the East, which would guarantee home-court advantage in the opening round. 
"It's one of the better wins we've had," James said. "On the road, it means a lot more against a playoff team." 
Down the stretch, it was James vs. Johnson at both ends of the court. 
"I was going one-on-one. I had to take the challenge," said James, who called the closing minutes "some of the best basketball we've played all season." 
Johnson led the Hawks with 21 points, but he missed his final two shots-including the potential game-winner. 
"I had a good look," he said. "It felt great when it left my hand. I thought it was. definitely going in, but not quite." 
James ran at Johnson with a hand extended-failing to get a piece of the ball but, as James put it, making "him shoot it a little bit different." 
Triple-teamed at times, James made eight of 20 from the field, including a pair of 3-pointers, and dished out 11 assists. 
The teams met on a day that should have made Cleveland feel right at home-a freak March storm left downtown Atlanta with a light blanket of snow. 
As always, the celebrities turned out for King James. Bill Murray, in Georgia film­ing a movie, sat courtside along with director Spike Lee, who was trying to sell Murray on another project while they both took in the game. 
The Cavaliers led 62-49 
about 5 minutes into the third; but the Hawks closed the quarter on a 21-7 run. Johnson, Zaza Pachulia and Flip Murray scored five points each to lead the spurt. 
On its final possession of the quarter, Murray gave the home team its first lead since 2-0. Isolated with Daniel Gibson, the Hawks guard drove into the lane and hit the jumper while drawing a foul. Even though he missed the free throw, the Hawks led 68-67 going into the fourth. 
James' best move came in the first half. He stepped back on Johnson, then sud­denly blew by him to the right and made the shot despite being fouled by Josh Smith. 
Cleveland Cavaliers for­ward LeBron James (23) drives to the basket as Atlanta Hawks guard Joe Johnson, right, defends dur­ing the fourth quarter of an NBA basketball game, Sunday, March 1, 2009 at Philips Arena in Atlanta. James had 26 points for the night and lead the Cavaliers to a 88-87 win. 
Smith dazzled the crowd, too. He blocked Williams' shot at one end, took off down the court and dunked off a miss by Joe Johnson. But Smith was mysteriously on the bench down the stretch as coach Mike Woodson chose to go with Pachulia. 
Williams had 20 points for Cleveland, while Zydrunas Ilgauskas had a double-dou­ble with 17 points and 11 rebounds. The Hawks had five players in double figures, including Murray and Marvin Williams with 14 apiece.

That Notre Dame even had a chance to force overtime at the end seemed unlikely early in the first half. Led by Thabeet, the Huskies blocked six Irish shots in the first 10 minutes of the game, effectively eliminat­ing any offensive productivity from the Irish interior.

ond half, but within minutes Blaney had an answer for Notre Dame. The Irish went on anoth­er four-goal run late in the peri­od to seal the win. 
"We weren't happy about our win last weekend over Ohio State, we felt that we hadn't been executing well,~' Coyne said. "In practice we focused on the fundamentals and it paid off. They started to get rough and foul at the end, but we remained focused on the game and got the win." 
Senior Erin Goodman earned the win in goal, compiling 13 saves in just under 53 minutes of play. Junior Amy Wmik snagged two saves in the final seven min­utes. 
"All of our early season games are important for the national court partner Jeff Adrien to score 22 of the Huskies 32 first half points. 
Despite their struggles against the Connecticut big men, the Irish managed to stay in the game by resorting to what they do best -shooting. Notre Dame made four 3­pointers in the final 10 min­utes of the first half and shot a combined 6-of-15 from beyond the arc helping to finish the first 20 minutes down only 32­30. 
The shots that kept Notre Dame in the game early ulti­mately eluded the Irish in the second half as Notre Dame endured a shooting stretch reminiscent of their 33 percent shooting performance against the Huskies on Jan. 24. After halftime, the Irish shot only 2­of-12 from 3-point land. 
"It's frustrating not to knock down those shots, especially when the game ended up that close," McAlarney said. "We had some good looks." 
The Irish stayed in the game due largely to the contribu­tions of Tory Jackson. The junior point guard who has endured an up-and-down sea­son was at his creative best Saturday penetrating the Huskies lane and finishing at the hole or finding teammates for open looks. Jackson fin­ished the game with 17 points on 7 -of-14 shooting to go along with five assists. 
Notre Dame has little time to recover from Saturday's game as they prepare for what is a must-win game today at the JACC against Villanova if they hope to make the NCAA Tournament. The game begins at 7 p.m.

Senior center Christian Hanson shoots against Michigan State in Notre Dame's 5-0 win on senior night Friday. 
Seniors

another CCHA regular season championship banner to the Joyce Center rafters. 
"It's about what we're try­ing to build here," Irish coach Jeff Jackson said. "Banners create traditions, and the only way we're going to build a tradition is after a long period of time." 
The Irish (26-5-3, 20-4-3-3 CCHA) wasted no time putting the game out of reach. Condra scored the first.of four open­ing period goals just 1:48 into the game with a wrister over Spartan goalie Drew Palmisano's blocker. Palmisano was starting in­place of senior Jeff Lerg, who sat out due to injury. 
"They had three guys in my lane, and I was just trying to get it past them." Condra said. "I couldn't see the net and I don't think the goalie could see the puck." 
White doubled the lead at 
9:41 of the period, and fresh­man Billy Maday got into the scoring act just eight minutes later, firing a blistering one­timer just under the crossbar on Palmisano's stick side. 
Condra closed out the peri­od with his second goal of the night, and 12th of the season. 
The score stayed 4-0 until the third period, when junior right wing Christiaan Minella added one more goal for good measure, 
Pearce was rarely tested until the last two minutes of the game, when the Irish were killing a Patrick Gaul penalty. 
"That power play at the end really made me work for it," Pearce said. 
The shutout was Pearce's second in a row and 10th of his career. He said he wasn't as active in this one as some others. 
"You're not facing as many shots so you're not as into the game," he said. "You've just got to try and stay ready and not fall asleep, I guess." 
After the game, the seniors reflected on a career that went from just 13 wins in their freshman year to strong national championship con­tenders four years later. 
"As seniors, we look back and see wha.t a wonderful career we had, but when we came in we had no idea," Condra said. "They had just come off a terrible season. We had no idea we would do it this quickly." 
Pearce said that previous upperclassman paved the way for the success this team is experiencing. 
"Good things will come if you work hard," Pearce said. "And after all the work we put in over the past four years trying to change our culture, we're starting to see the ben­efits." 
Pearce added that, while he enjoyed the senior night fes­tivities, he planned to add a few more banners to the rafters before the end of the season. 
"There's a lot more to accomplish this year," he said. "It's nice to have this night, but there's going to be a lot more special nights for us." 
Saturday's 2-1 win at. Michigan State wrapped up the regular season for the Irish and also marked the first time any of Notre Dame's current seniors had won in East Lansing, Mich. The Irish hadn't beaten the Spartans on their home ice since Feb. 9, 2002. 
Condra and Hanson each scored for Notre Dame, and Pearce stopped 19 of 20 shots in a game the Irish dominat­ed, outshooting Michigan State 37-20. 
The Irish will now have a week off as the CCHA tourna­ment begins this weekend. Notre Dame will host a best­of-three series on March 13­15 for the right to get to the conference's semifinals in Detroit, Mich., on March 20­
21. 

Notes: 
uJackson said he was trying to get all six seniors on the ice for the final shift of Friday's game, but Gaul's penalty with two minutes remaining made it impossible. 
uBefore Friday's game, a moment of silence was observed for radio play-by­play man Mike Lockert, who passed away in his sleep Thursday night at the age of 
43. Lockert had called Irish games on Cat Country 99.9 FM and und.com for the past seven years. 
"It was just devastating to me. I got to know Mike real well," Jackson said. "Today, I can say it's not just about the voice, but the man behind the voice, and he was a tremen­dous man."

Byers sets points record inbigwin over Stanford 
By NATHANIEL LEE 
Sports Writer 

Senior .lillian Byers became Notre Dame's all-time point leader after scoring five goals in No. 12 Notre Dame's 17-8 victory over No. 16 Stanford Saturday at the Loftus Sports Center. 
".lillian's performance was out­standing, she was very relaxed and in the flow of the game," Irish coach Tracy Coyne said. "We never talked about the record, she just played hard for the team and for the win." 
Byers' five-point performance gave her a career total of 238 points. 
Also pacing the Irish (3-1) was junior Gina Sciosia's four goals and one assist, sophomore Shaylyn Blaney's three goals, freshman Maggie Tamasitis' one goal and two assists and sopho­more Ansley Stewart's one goal and one assist. 
"This was a huge game for us. Not· only is there a rivalry between our schools, but Stanford is a great team and tested us," Coyne said. ".This game was revenge for a tough loss last year. We capitalized on a lot of their errors early on to put it away." 
Sophomore midfielder Kailene Abt put the Irish on the board first just 34 seconds into the first half. The teams traded goals until Byers took off, scoring four consecutive goals to put the Irish up 6-2. 
Sciosia and sophomore Jackie Doherty netted scores of their own before the end of the half to bring the score to 9-3.

Neither fighter was able to take a clear lead after two rounds, but the senior Hof pulled away in the final round to earn the split-decision victo­ry. 
"There were a couple of times where I was trying to wrap him up, but he wouldn't let me get him," Sayles said. "He just kept throwing a lot of real flurries of body shots." 
Although Sayles was able to evade some of Hof's jabs and hooks with his quick feet and

"From this point forward, we continue to do what we have done in the past," Belles coach Jennifer Henley said. "Our four outgoing seniors have set the bar high for those
