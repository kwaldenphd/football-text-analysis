An early morning fire Sunday at Corby Tavern, Inc., 1026 Corby Ave., caused 550,000 in structural and material damage, according to the South Bend Fire Department. 
The tavern should be "fully opera­tional in three to four weeks depending on the weather," Corby's spokesman Harold A. Rowley Jr., said yesterday. He added that final work on the reconstruction con­tract will be completed today. 
The South Bend Fire Department report listed "heavy ceiling damage to the roof and rafters at the rear of the building with water and smoke damage throughout the bar area." 
The fire started in the furnace room where stored items such as liq­uor, plastic cups and supplies ap­parently spontaneously ignited, 
according  to a Fire  Department  
spokesperson  insisting  on  
anonymity.  

The spokesperson also said the fire moved up and across the ceiling to the rear of the building but the furnace "did not malfunction and this is definitely not an arson." Rowley also docs not suspect arson. 
Rowley said the fire department's "outstanding job" saved the building from complete destruction. Three tire trucks answered the 4:32 a.m. call and had the blaze under control within 4S minutes.

WASHINGTON (AP) -Salvage

of the Potomac River on yesterday, 
hut the achievement turned sour 
when the crumpled section failed to 
yield two llight recorders which 
could unravt:l the causes of last 
week's crash. 
Investigators were initially exul­tant when, after battling the frozen river for five days, divers managed to tic straps under the Boeing 737's tail and lift it from a crane on the bridge overhead. But the objects of the operation -the critical cockpit voice and flight data recorders ­weren't inside. 
With that, divers took to the water once more, but darkness forced suspension of the effort for another day. 
Authorities had expected to find the voice and data recorders, each contained in heavy metal boxes, within the recovered section. But when they probed the wreckage, they came up empty. Adisappointed Jim Burnett, acting chief of the Na­tional Transportation Safety Board, told reporters, "We don't have either one of them," when asked if the recorders were found. He said divers would try anew to find the recorders in the 27-foot-decp water. 
Police Inspector James Shugart said it was possible the recorders dropped hack into the ice-caked water as the blue, green and white tail section was being hoisted onto the bridge.

Rowley speculated, "We would have had to close until the summer." As it stands now, Corby's will open in about a month assuming the winter weather does not sl_ow the clean-up. 
Rowley, who serves as the 
tavern's business secretary, said the 
building will need an entirely new

also be replaced. 
"Anyone who is familiar with

PARIS (AP) -Assistant U.S. Military Attache Lt. Charles Robert Ray was assassinated yesterday by a lurking gunman who police said fired a single shot into Ray's forehead and fled as the victim col­lapsed on a Paris sidewalk. 
The U.S. ambassador to France, Evan Grifft ith Galbraith, said the gun­man was "probably a professional and undoubtedly an experienced killer." 
Police said Ray was shot about 9 
a.m. as he walked alone to his parked car near his apartment in a fas­hionable distict. He wore civilian clothes and carried a small attache case found by his body. 
The only witness police found was a woman who saw the shooting from a distance on her way to work. She said she caught a back view of the killer fleeing on foot and described him as short with long hair and casual clothes. 
In Washingwn, President Reagan described the assassination as an act of international terrorism, saying Ray "gave his life in the line of duty as surely as ifhe had fallen in battle. 
"Our hearts go out to his family in their bereavement, and the wanton 
act of his murderers reinforces our 
determination to stamp out interna­
tional terrorism and prevent similar 
tragedies in the future," Reagan said. 
French President Francois Mitter­rand and Premier Pierre Mauroy, expressing outrage, promised an in· tensivc search to tlnd the assassin and offered to bolster security for 
U.S. Embassy staff. 
Galbraith said security for U.S. of­ficials in France would be reassessed because ofthe killing, since Ray "did not seem to be a target and it was not thought he ran any risks." 
Security was incre;u;cd for senior 
U.S. Embassy staff in Paris after an un­successful assault on U.S. Charge d'Affaires Christian Chapman last Nov. 18 by a gunman who escaped. Police said the tactics and descrip­tion of Ray's assassin were similar and that a 7.6S mm pistol was used in both attacks. 
Ray, 43, was survived by his wife Sharon, daughter Julie, 17, and son Mark, 15. He had been stationed in Paris with his family since August 1980. He was schooled in military intelligence, served in Vietnam and

Rowley said the employees did turn the furnace's heat down to 55 degrees before leaving, as in· structed. "Because of the cold, the furnace had been working hard for two weeks," Rowley said. 
Corby's is fully insured and the property is assessed at $1 00,000. The fire caused $40,000 in damage to the building and ruined S10,000 worth ofsupplies. 
Rowley's wife, Rose Kessen­Rowley, actually owns the property, but she has been out-of-town and was unavailable for comment. 
Jennifer, like other manics, suffers from a disorder which scientists believe is caused by a chemical im­balance in the brain, according to Dr. )amesJefferson, a psychiatrist and director of the Lithium Information Center at the University of Wisconsin Center for Health Sciences. 
The center, the only one of its kind in the country, was founded in 1975 and is a computerized library of over 8,300 articles and studies on all aspects oflithium use. 
Jennifer, like others, takes lithium, a common form of salt, to control the euphoric highs and tearful lows with which this Jekyll-and-Hyde syndrome jolts its victims. 
Jefferson said about 1.1 5 million Americans suffer from manic depression, but only a third -roughly 300,000 people -have been diagnosed and take lit­hium. 
Manic depression differs greatly from regular depres-t sion and schizophrenia, according to Jefferson. While some people just suffer plain depression and schizophrenics possess an emotionally distorted picture of reality most of their lives, manic depressives slip in and out of three stages -manic, depressed and

The worst cold wave of the century shifted its grip to the Northeast yesterday, stranding thousands of city commuters as trains quit running and cars refused to start in temperatures at record lows. Temperatures were on the rise in the Midwest and the Deep South, hard hit last week, but more extreme cold may be on the way. The National Weather Service forecast below-normal tem­peratures across the eastern two-thirds of the nation over the next 30 days. At least 283 deaths have been attributed to the polar air mass that first pushed into the country onJan. 9 and dealt cities such as Chicago, M t ilwaukee and Akron, Ohio, their coldest temperatures since the weather service started keeping track. -AP 
Despite the Roman Catholic Church's sharp 
criticism of martial law, the Polish government said yesterday cooperation was needed from the church to pull Poland out of its crisis. In other developments, the Polish news agency PAP called for an increase in food a11d other prices to save the economy from total collapse. Officials of both the army and the Communist Party demanded a purge of the "enemies of socialism." Polish primate ArchbishopJozef Glemp issued his third attack on Poland's military rulers Sunday. But yesterday the daily government newspaper Rzeczpospolita spoke of the church's "important social role" in mediating "even the most difficult problems." It appeared the government was taking a conciliatory line toward the church despite repeated denunciations by the church ofmass arrests. -AP 
Marie Osmondis the leading candidate to play Britain's Princess Diana in a TV movie planned by ABC, The London Daily Star reported yesterday. The tabloid said the movie will cover Diana's life up to her marriage to Prince Charles, 33-year-old heir to the throne, at St. Paul's Cathedral last July 29. The Star quoted an unidentified spokeswoman for ABC saying: "the story must be handled tastefully. The actress we choose must capture the in­nocence and charm that has made the princess the darling of the world." -AP 
Last nigllt the Student Senate approved Notre Dame Stu­dent Body President Don Murday's deadlines for the election ofnew class officers, student body president, and vice president and stu­dent senators. A mandatory meeting for all persons interested in running for class offices will be in the student government offices at 7 p.m., Feb. 11. Elections for class officers will be March 2.

A meeting for all persons interested in running for the Student Senate will be at 8:30p.m. Wednesday. Elec­tions for both will be Feb. 8. Elections will be earlier this year to enable new officers to be .come more familiar with the duties oftheir offices. Outlining his plans for this semester, Murday said he wants the Senate to involve itself in academic and social issues by forming study groups that will present ideas to the Board ofTrustees in May. -The Observer 
Narcotics agents in Union City, Tenn., arrested seven people and confiscated almost 5300,000 in marijuana and cash late Sunday and early yesterday after they caught a drug-laden airplane being unloaded at an airport near here, officials said. The plane's pilot managed to fly away in a hail of gunfire when police began to move in at Everett-Stewart Airport, Obion County Sheriff Danny Cunningham said. Two men were arrested at the airport, one was picked up nearby and two others were arrested at Milan, Tenn., about 50 miles away, Cunningham said. A sixth man and a woman were arrested when Metro Narcotics detectives raided two homes in Shelby County shortly after the airport raid, he said. The plane and its pilot were being sought. -AP

A different taste of life 

Thinking about summer work while the greater 
Notre Dame-Saint Mary's community is experiencing 
the record-breaking temperatures of winter might 
seem futile, but the Holy Cross Associates and the Sum­
mer Service Projects Program offer exciting summer 
positions in various locales that are proven to be fulflll­
ing and enlightening experiences. 
Awide variety ofsummer experiences are offered to 
provide various communities with much-nt:eded assis­
tance as well as giving the participant a view oflife not 
strewn with textbooks and final exams. 
What makes one dodge the vast pool of summer 
employment to participate in volunteer work? 
I asked Mary Ann Roemer, chief screener and mem­
ber of the Board of Directors for the Holy Cross As­
sociates Program, why students choose to join. 
"The students try to integrate the beliefs oftheir faith 
with their career goals," she explained. Roemer said the intent ofthe program is for the students to serve others and, at the same time, strengthen their faith in Chris­tianity. 
The domestic Associates program focuses on four principle American cities: Portland, Oregon; Phoenix, Arizona; Hayward, California; and Colorado Springs, 
Colorado. Service positions there are as diverse as the cities' locales. A student can find himself teaching in an inter-city school, counseling skid row drunks at an al­coholic treatment center or aiding in community projects in neighborhoods. 
What differentiates the Holy Cross Associates program from other programs is that there is no "drive" for recruits. If a stu­dent is considering the program, "I probably would not try to sway the student, for it is through a student's willingness to serve that at­tracts them to the program. 
"I point to what the 
program is. It is a sense ofChristian faith acted out in an active way," Roemer stated. 
Roemer also expressed the value of the program in relation to future career goals. As john O'Lear, a former Associate in Portland stated: I am even applying some ofmy engineering as I bead up a major renovation of the building. When all that doesn't keep me busy enough, I climb a mountain, ride my bike to San Fran, or have breakfast with Val. 
The Summer Service Projects Program also offers stu­dents the opportunity to come into direct contact with urban and social problems, according to program coor­dinator Andrea Shappell. 
Students work under the auspices of Notre Dame 
Alumni clubs serving the poor. Each student has the 
opportunity to discuss the problems in the areas they 
reside with the Alumni Clubs. "(The Summer Service 
Projects) is a challenging way to spend the summer. 
Students can learn much about the different cultures, 
something you cannot find in school," Shappell stated. 
Students will receive a SI ,000 scholarship to aid in 
Features Editor 
Inside Tuesday 
the costs ofthe I982-83 academic year. Approximately 20 students will be chosen to serve in the eight week program. 
The scholarships will also come from the James Andrews Scholarship Fund. This year the Fund will sponsor two work sites, up from the partial assistance the Fund sponsored last year. 
Andrews graduated from Notre Dame and was active in justice issues. He went on to co-found the University Press-Syndicate, the suppliers of Doonesbury and other columns. 
Students in the program found themselves serving the educational, recreational and role modeling needs of their communities. Roles as teachers, and camp in­structors, and volunteer service organizations allowed 
cial justice. It it a .lifelong search, and without a "family" ofsupport we'd never make it. I am now a thirdyear law student. My classmates are not very in­terested in social justice. My own attitudes have become more pragmatic and my golden ideals a little tarnished from the wear. I continue to see things that make me angry: my clients inprison who getfiveyears for forging checks while doctors stealing Medicare money get probation; Ronald Reagen using money which once boughtfood stamps to build nuclear war­heads; the Catholic Church still treating women as in­ferior. I intend to continue working to change these 
things, to reverse the injustice in any way I can. I need only look at the faces in thephotograph to know thatI am not alone. 
Applications for the Holy Cross Associates Domestic Program can be picked up from Mary Ann Roemer at the Volunteer Services Office, 1.5 LaFortune. Deadline for the program is Feb. I2. Applications for the Summer Service Projects can be picked up at the Volunteer Services Office or from Andrea Shappell at the Center for Experimental Learning, II I 0 Memorial Library. 
himself on a schoolyard fence near Arleta, Calif, police said yester­day. The body of Lehman, 20, was found, hanging from a chain link fence at the Vena Avenue Elementary School, by a friend, Joseph Allen, police said. The school is across the street from Allen's home, where Lehman was spending the night. Lehman's death was tentatively listed as a suicide, police Detective AI Ferrand said. Allen told investigators that Lehman "had spoken about taking his life" and was despondent. Lehman played Butch Everett, the mischievous son of Professor Howard Everett, played by Richard Long, on the ABC series in I971. -AP

In the "deprogrammmg" case, Thomas Joseph Ward filed suit in 1979, charging that 33 people ­including his parents and other relatives -conspired to make him renounce his beliefs. 
Ward's suit says he was kidnapped in 1978 while on his way home from a Thanksgiving visit at his sister's home in Virginia Beach, Va., and was held captive for 3S days before escaping. 
Ward says he was subjected to ar­duous "deprogramming" sessions in

which he was threatened with physi­cal violence and death. 
His suit, filed in Norfolk, Va., said the defendants conspired to violate his religious freedom and his right to travel, in violation of the 1871 law, often called the Ku Klux Klan Act. 
Two of the defendants, Robert and Eugenia Mandclkorn, chal­lenged Ward's usc of that law. They said the law protects people only against conspiracies to violate the rights ofracial minorities. 
Last Aug. I0, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the law can protect members of religious groups, too.

normal -which can be triggered by any event at any time, he said. 
The manic stage, characterized by decreased sleep, euphoria, ram­blings of grandiose plans, excessive drinking, spending and an extraordi­nary sense of benevolence and religious enlightenment, can last three to six months, according to Jefferson. 
He said the risk of accidental 
death during this period increases 
because victims lose inhibitions and 
become self-destructive. 
"They may quit their jobs, leave their families, or give away all of their belongings," Jefferson said. "They feel they no longer need them because they're invincible or be­cause God is protecting them." 
Jennifer said her mania was 
marked by avid party planning, 
strong religious feelings and bouts of 
impulsive spending. 
Jefferson said the depression stage, which lasts six to nine months, is marked by feelings of rejection and lack of energy, coupled with an increased risk ofsuicide. 
"If untreated, or assuming they don't kill themselves first, the vic­tims will come out ofeach stage and slip into the next," Jefferson said. 
He said such mood swings may be recognizable to friends and family of the victim but mistaken for other maladies, such as schizophrenia or alcoholism. 
Recent medical evidence shows the disorder may be genetically transmitted, and that persons with family histories of manic depression are more likely to suffer from it than those who do not. 
In Madison, patients are able to get the treatment, support and counseling they need from profes­sionals and other manics through the Lithium Connection, a voluntary self-help group at University Hospi­tal and Clinics.

Jefferson said counseling is an im­portant follow-up to lithium treat­ment -determined through blood tests and mood observations -be­cause users must decide whether the drug and its side effects improve or worsen their quality oflife. 
Some of the less commo·n-arid­more serious effects include hair loss, kidney damage, diarrhea, memory loss, coma and death, which can result from an overdose ofthe drug, jefferson said. 
Jefferson, who has published several papers and a book on manic depression and treatment, said an overwhelming majority of patients in nationwide studies chose to con­tinue using the drug.

The beat performance in the Notre Dame mile relay squad was turned in by Steve Dziabis, who ran a 50.2­second anchor quarter and also doubled in the 600. "Steve is run­ning better than any other of the quarter-milers," said Kelly{ who also commended Dziabis' 600 effort: "He ran a tough, gutty race. I told him to go out with the leaders and hold them off as long as he could. He beat them to the start and held them off on three consecutive straightaways and then fell back because of the energy he expended in holding the lead." 
The mile relay time of 3:24.2 on the slow boards means that the school record of3: 16.5 set in 1968 is in jeapardy. "I'd be suprised if we· didn't break the school record this year," said Kelly. 
The two-mile relay team also ran well. Freshman jim Tyler, senior tri­captain Rick Rogers, junior jim Moyar and senior Tim Macauley each took home trophies for their third-place 7:54.7 finish. "The two­mile relay ran well, as usual. They're all just very good runners," said Dziabis. 
Senior john McCloughan got off to a great start in the 50-yard hurdles. In the Jane next to him was former world record holder and Olympic gold medal winner Rod Milburn. Also in McCloughan's heat was Rodney Wilson, who was the NCAA champion two years ago. 
"I got out with the guy (Milburn) and after the first hurdle he wasn't ahead of me," said McCloughan. "Then I fell apart." McCloughan hit the second hurdle but still finished the race strong, one stride behind Wilson. Milburn won the heat. "I was impressed with John's perfor­mance yesterday," said Kelly. "The thing is that he learned that he can run with some ofthe best hurdlers in the country. Yesterday confirmed my belief that he is running better." Caron seemed to sum up the team's attitude about its rather auspicious start,"From this meet everyone gained confidence. We realized that we're talented and we're going to be a team to deal with. We won't be taken for granted anymore. We can't be."

Irish switn teams fall to Cleveland St. 
For a time Sunday, it seemed that the Notre Dame swim team would pull off a sizeable upset. Going into the final relay event, the Irish looked like winners against the powerful team. 
"Cleveland State has the third­fastest pool in the world," said Mike Shepardson. "They are a strong team that has already qualified for the na­tionals in several events." 
The Irish swam well as a team, but fell just short of the upset, as Cleveland State pulled away to a 12­second win in the 400-yard Freestyle relay, and a 63-50 overall win. 
Though the visitors won eight of the thirteen events, Notre Dame hung tough, piling up points for second and third-place finishes. Sophomore AI Harding paced the Irish, winning the 500-yard Freestyle, placing second in the 200­yard Freestyle, and anchoring the 400-yard medley relay. 
That relay was the first event of the match, and was an indication of things to come. Glenn Battle, John Willamowski, Shepardson and Har­ding edged out Cleveland State by al­most three full seconds. 
Cleveland State came back to win the next three straight events, but the tone was set for the Irish, who never lost confidence. That con­fidence got a big boost when Don Casey and Dan Flynn finished first and second, respectively. That sweep allowed Notre Dame to climb back into contention, where they stayed until the finish. 
The women, meanwhile, did not fare as well. 
Cleveland State swam to wins in 11 of the 13 swimmimg events, and overwhelmed the Irish, 88-50. Notre Dame's two-time. All­American, jeanine Blatt, continued her winning ways, taking first in the 500-yard Freestyle. Blatt was out­touched in the 200-yard Freestyle, however, losing by just .6 seconds. 
The other winner for the Irish was Teri Schindler, who easily outdis­tanced her nearest competitior to win the I00-yard Breaststroke event. 
Both the men and the women will ·return to action this Saturday at Il­linois State.

I Irish trackmen excel 
Aragon defeats stellar field 
ByEARLRIX 
Sports Writer 
It was a curious mixture ofthe old and the new for the Irish at the Goodwill Games in the Rosemont Horizon on Sunday. 
Chuck Aragon, Notre Dame's three-time All-American and first­ever sub-four minute miler, still wore his Notre Dame uniform as he bested star-studded field in the mile run. Aragon is currently a first-year medical student at the University of New Mexico. 
Aragon's winning attitude seemed to rub off on some of his former teamates who turned in good perfor­mances of their own against some of the best track atheletes in the country at this prestigious meet. 
"Chuck was strong and confident and he wasn't about to give up. I think that's now the attitude of the 
team. Chuck represents the epitome
-ofwhat we're trying for. After a lot of work, good things will happen:'said sophomore Ralph Caron who ran a fine 9:12 in the two mile. 
Indeed Aragon didn't give up. Sit­ting in second place for the first half of the race, Aragon took the lead with a little more than five laps to go on the 11 lap-per-mile banked hardwood surface. To the delight of the crowd he held off a charge by Steve Lacy over the last two laps. Chuck finished the race in 4:04.2 over the 160-yard board track, which is about the slowest surface races are held on. 
Olympian Steve Lacy, whose per­
sonal best in the mile is 3:52, finshed 
a full second behind Aragon. Jim 
Spivey, who holds a personal best of 
3: 54 finished third with a time of 
4:06.7. Ross Donahue, a 3:56 miler, finished fpurth. Sidney Maree, who holds the American record at 3:48, finshed fifth and was never a factor in the race. Craig Masback, a 3:52 miler, rounded out the field. 
"I've seen Chuck race quite a few times," said Irish head Coach joe Piane. "and this is the most intel­ligent race I've ever seen him run. It was probably the most exciting race of the day and the crowd reaction was superb." 
The meet also marked senior Bill Ribera's return to competition after an almost two-year layoff caused by a ripped achilles tendon. He under­went surgery last spring. Despite the forced layoff and no experience whatever on the "boards," Ribera held his own with a 51.2-second clocking in his quarter-mile segment ofthe mile relay. 
"Billy is as good a competitor as we have on our team," said sprint Coach Ed Kelly."Its really good to see him do well." 
Freshman Mitch VanEyken ran a fine 51.1 quarter in his first col­legiate competition as he led off the mile relay. "He pleasantly suprised me," said Kelly. "He ran a very com­petitive opening leg." 
Senior tri-captain jacques Eady 
ran a 51.1 second leg in the relay.

Seeking revenge 
Pinone,Villanova invade ACC 
By CHRIS NEEDLES 
Sports Writer 
In this "season ofrevenge" against Notre Dame, Villanova may have the best reason of anybody to gain vengeance. 
Sure, Virginia and Kentucky, among others, have had scores to settle with the now-floundering Irish this year. But consider the Wildcats' situation. 
Rollie Massimino's teams have dropped seven of their last eight games against Notre Dame, includ­ing a 94-65 pasting at the Palestra last season. Worse yet, Villanova, in its last two visits to the ACC, has lost by identical scores of 70-69. In their 
last visit in I980, the 'Cats t clawed back from an 18-point deficit to take the lead in the final minute, only to have Tracy jackson swish a 35-foot prayer at the buzzer to hand them still another defeat. 
The emotional Massimino cried openly after that one. But shed no tears for Villanova this season. )be 'Cats enter tonight's game at the 
-ACC (8:05 tipoff) with a 12-2 record, ranked 12th in the nation and they feature one of the better balanced teams around. There's the dominating center, All-America candidate john Pinone, who leads Villanova in scoring, averaging just over 20 points per game. The 6-8, 228-pound junior from Wethersfield, Conn., generally is regarded as one of the best big men in the East, if not the entire country. "John has become one ofthe most outstanding players in America," says Massimino. "His confidence as a passer and ball handler gives us the ability to use him in all situations." There's the finesse forward, fresh­
...,.. man sensation Ed Pinckney. The 6-9, 195-pounder from the Bronx, a con­sensus high school All-American, has burst onto the collegiate scene and currently ranks second in the nation in field goal percentage, hitting near­ly 75 percent ofhis shots. "Ed's not only an outstanding player," Massimino says, "but he has also fit into our philosophy im­mediately. He's an excellent talent at both ends ofthe floor." There's the power forward, 6-7 senior Aaron Howard, a three-year letterman from Linden, N.J. Al­though he is not a prolific scorer (averaging eight points a game 
lifetime), Howard can hit the clutch shot when called upon, as witnessed by his heroics against Syracuse ear­lier this year. 
In the January 9 game at the Palestra, Howard hit a baseline jum­per at the buzzer to send the game into overtime, where the 'Cats pulled out an 84-83 Big East victory. 
There's the playmaking guard, Stewart Granger, one of the best in the country at his position. Granger, who was born in Canada and grew up in Brooklyn, played basketball on the international level .this past sum­mer -for the Canadian World Uni­versity team. 
Ironically, Granger was the hero in the Canadian upset of the U.S. team, which included Villanova teammate Pinone. The 6-3 Granger, a junior, . scored 23 points in engineering the upset of the eventual-gold-medal-winning Americans. 
There's the shooting guard. Mas­simino has a couple ofsharpshooters to choose from. 6-4 sophomore "Happy" Dobbs fills the starting role, with relief help from freshman Gary McLain. 
Finally, there's the bench, where Massimino can go three-or four­deep with confidence. In addition to McLain, Rollie can choose from junior Mike Mulquin, senior john Sices, and Dwayne McClain, still an­other talented freshman. 
So, what does Digger Phelps have in store for Villanova? 
"We're going to do just what we've done all season ... go out and give it our best shot," says Phelps. "Villanova has a top-quality team, just look at the polls. We've got our work cut out for us, there's no ques­tion ofthat. 
"Pinone is one ofthe top big men in the East, along with Sampson and Ewing, and Granger is a tough player as well. We've got to play with inten­sity underneath, and try to neutralize those two guys. We can 
do that. ._ ______ 
"John Paxson has shown through­out his career that he can play defense against the best guards in the country, and he'll have to prove that again with Granger. We'e !lad some success keeping people like Wallace Bryant from getting in­volved in the offense, and we think we can do the same with Pinone, but it'll be tough." 
The Irish ( 3-9) have pieced to­gether two decent efforts in a row, a.nd at least, by virtue of Saturday's 59-45 victory over Davidson, have shown that they are capable of win­ning a ballgame. 
But there still are questions to be answered: can Ron Rowan repeat his fine performance from Saturday against Villanova tonight and for the rest ofthe season? 
Will 
john Paxson break out of his shooting slump? 

Will 
Tim Andree rise to the occa­sion tonight against Pinone, as he did against Wallace Bryant in San Fran-

Knight responds to 'charges 
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -Bobby 
Knight, Indiana's basketball coach, 
sent an assistant to Columbus yester­
day with videotape to support his 
claim that Ohio State freshman Troy 
Taylor committed a flagrant foul 
against the Hoosiers' Jim Thomas. 
Kohn Smith, an Indiana coaching 
assistant, showed the tape from In­
dianapolis station WTTV to 
representatives of the Columbus 
Dispatch and Columbus station 
WCMH-TV. 
Knight was upset over a flagrant foul called on Taylor when the Ohio State guard tried to block a layup by Thomas with 11 seconds remaining in the Hoosiers' 66-61 Big Ten vic­tory Saturday over the Buckeyes. 
At first, Knight declined to com­ment. But he reversed his decision when Taylor said the Indiana coach "started screaming at me and called me everything in the book." 
Bob Hunter of The Dispatch wrote in Monday's editions that the videotape showed Taylor's foul to be flagrant. But he said it did not sup­port or refute Knight's statements that he didn't say anything to Taylor after the incident. 
"I didn't say anything for several seconds," Knight said via telephone Monday. "Then the kid (Taylor) came up to me. He was standing be­hind a player or two and he said, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry.' 
"I then said something like, 
'There's no excuse for somehing like 
that, get him the hell out of here,' and then went to the officials. 
"That's the only comment I made and I didn't even say it directly to the kid. I asked my players about it, and they said they didn't hear me say anything to any effect other than what I've just said. They were adamant about that." 
Knight, however, says his incident with Taylor was not the reason for sending the videotape to Columbus. 
"What's central to this thing is the foul, and I've sent the tape ofthat to the conference office. It's a con­ference matter," the Indiana coach said. 
Hunter wrote that the videotape clearly showed Taylor shoving Thomas with his left hand, grabbing Thomas' wrist with his right hand and kicking the Indiana guard's leg out from under him. 
first contact is a push on the back. And how about the leg whip? How can you believe what he said about me? To start with, he gave a couple of erroneous descriptions of what happened." 
While Knight denied he swore at Taylor, he did not deny he directed an ~;xpletive toward Ohio State Coach Eldon Miller or that he slammed Ohio State's coaching staff on his Sunday television show. 
"I said I didn't see any concern at all from the Ohio State staff -and I didn't say team, I said staff -for Thomas," Knight said. "But I said I've come to expect that from that opera­tion." 
Miller has refused to comment on the incident, saying it's not a matter for publication. 
Knight said he could not imagine ,...---------------. 
what was going through the Ohio State player's mind. 
"First of all, the game was over; secondly, he has no chance to stop the shot and then we have the kind of foul that it was. The basket was already made so how necessary was it for him (Taylor) to kick his legs out from under him (Thomas)?" Knight asked. 
Knight said he read comments 
made  by  Taylor  in  Sunday's  
newspapers.  
"Let's analyze the  statement  he  

made on the foul," said the Indiana coach. "He said he hit his wrist, but he fell on his own. Is that true? The
