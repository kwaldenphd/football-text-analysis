O'Meara 
releases letter to CLC 
by Pat Toomey 

There will be no housing lottery this year. This news was announced in a letter from Dr. Timothy O'Meara, University provost, to the student body. O'Meara's letter was released at last night's Campus Life Council meeting. 
According to O'Meara, last August's overcrowding will be reduced by more than one half without a lottery. Therefore, students who are eligible for campus housing and who have signed a contract are assured accomodation for next year. 
In the letter, O'Meara also expressed optimism that con­struction of additional on-campus housing will be started by the academic year 1980-81. ' 
Funding is now being sought for this new housing. The University will reapply for a housing loan from the federal government before the June 1 deadline. Discussions with po­tential donors for a new dormi­tory are also being continued. 
At the meeting, it was an­nounced that students who had turned in housing cards might still be abk to move off-campus · without beind fined $250. Fr. John Van Wolvlear, vice­president for Student Affairs, said these students would be 
allowed to plead their case until 
April 1. 
The CLC also discussed campus alcohol abuse at the meeting. Keenan rector Fr. Richard Conyers expressed con­cern about current drinking atti­tudes at Notre Dame. According to Conyers, "Drunkenness is something that shouldn't exist at an academic institution where we're trying to improve our­selves.'' 
... 'Alcohol is just a symptom of the social problems we have on campus.' 
Gene Woloshyn, assistant Student Union director, res­ponded to Conyers' ar~ent by claiming, "Alcohol 1s just a symptom of the social problems that we have on campus. Alcohol is an outlet for these social frustrations." 
The CLC' s discussion on alco­hol soon developed into a discus­sion of the social life at Notre 
Dame. 
The Council voted to have Van Wolvlear and Student Body President Andy McKenna devel­op a strategy to achieve a campus-wide conference on the quality ·of campus living. An alcohol abuse prevention pro­~ was also approved by the 
The problems of false frre alarms on campus and the repre­sentation of off-campus students on the CLC were also discussed.

In a letter addressed to the 
student body and read by Andy 
McKenna, Student Body presi­
dent, at last night's Campus Life 
Council meeting, University Pro­
vost Timothy O'Meara revealed 
that there wdl be no off-campus 
lottery. 
O'Meara outlined three points in the letter dealing with the housing situation on campus, the first of which was the announce­ment that all students eligible for campus housing who have signed housing contracts will be assured accomodation ·in campus dormi­tories next year. 
He explruned that an analysis of signed housing contracts indi­cated that the overcrowding of early last semester will be greatly reduced, in his words, ''by more than half,'' without the need for a lottery. 
"This solution would not have been possible without the effor t of those of you who have volun­tarily dectded to move off campus," O'Meara noted in the letter. 
Commenting that the Univer­sity is moving in the right direction, Andy McKenna ex­pressed satisfaction with O'Meara's letter. "I think the patience in waiting for the figures to come in instead of trying to force a lottery in the first semes­ter really paid off," the SBP said. 

Dan McCurrie, president of the Junior Oass, the group which would have been most directly affected by any lottery proposal, was less enthusiastic about the revelation, remarking, ''It's no swprise to me.

Many survivors, apparently fearing the _plane would burst into flames, fled in panic through the snow after the accident, witnesses said. The plane did not catch ftre. 
"We had just taken off from the ground and the plane started rocking back and forth and all ofa sudden it flipped,'' said Sally Bishop of Shinnston, W.Va, a passenger who was not seriously hurt. 
"I didn't realize what was going on and all of a sudden we were hanging from the ceiling," she said. 
Dave Shipley, director of pub­lic relations for Allegheny, said the plane came to a rest upside down about 100 feet from the end of the runway at Benedum Air­port. Shipley said it was snowing when the plane crashed and the runway had just been plowed. 
One of the injured was in critical condition at United Hospi­tal Center in Oarksburg, a second was in serious condition and the conditions of the other two were unknown. The remain­ing 19 persons were also being examined at the hospital. 
Allegheny spokeswoman Nancy Vaughan said one of the dead was a crew member, but she said she could not provide either identity immediately. 
The plane, Flight 561, was taking off from this north-central West Virginia city at about 1:10 
p.m. It was bound for National Airport in Washington, D.C., witli. a stop in Morgantown. 
Shipley said the plane, an M-298 twin-engine propjet with a capacity of 28, was carrying 22 passengers and three crew mem­bers.

Rhodesian airliner crashes 
SAliSBURY, Rhodesia [AP)-A Rhodesian airliner crashed min­utes after takeoff yesterday from the northwestern resort of Kari­ba, killing all ~9 persons aboard, Air Rhodesia announced. 
Airline officials said they feared black nationalist guerillas had shot down the plane. 
Last Seet. 3, guerrillas claimed responsibility for shooting down another Air Rhodesia plane with a Soviet-made SAM-7 sround-to­air, heat-seeking missile. That plane also went down shortly after taking off from Kariba and 48 persons were killed, including 10 survivors slain on the ground by guerrillas. Eight persons escaped alive. 
Both planes were four-engine turboprop Viscounts. 
Yesterday, the blue-and-white airliner took off smoothly from Kariba, on the border with Zambia, bound for Salisbury, 200 miles to the southeast.

But some six minutes huer a distress call was made and it crashed. Air Rhodesia later is­sued this terse announcement: Air Rhodesia rerets to an­nounce the loss o a Viscount aircraft operating flight RH827 between Kariba and Salibruty. It has been established that there are no survivors." 
The announcement said there were ~4 passengers and five crew members aboard. 
Army troops reached the site of the wreckage and found no survivors, airline officials said. 
The first indication at Kariba airport that Flight 827 was miss­ing came when passengers, in­cluding Associated Press corres­pondent Maureen Johnson, on an Air Rhodesia Viscount that took off 1~ minutes later for Salisbury saw three camouflaged soldiers rushing toward a police spotter plane. 
The spotter plane took off, followed by the second Viscount flight. Rhodesia's supreme mili­tary commander, Lt. Gen. Pete Walls, and his wife were aboard the second plane, returnin~ from a four-day fishing vacatton in Kariba. 
Those on the second plane found out about the crash when two stewardesses began sobbing. 
The downed airliner carried men, women and children, most­ly people on holiday who had spent the weekend at Kariba, which features a casino and excellent fishing on Kariba lime. 
AP reporter Fohnson said her flight, instead of swinging left like Flight 827, circled for almost 20 minutes over the giant lake, on the tense border between Rho­desia and Zambia, where the guerrillas have their rear bases. 
Miss Johnson said she had chatted briefly with some of the passengers on Flight 827 before they took off, indudin~ a pretty hostess for British Airways on vacation in Rhodesia.

Notre Dame will try once again to climb above the .500 mark when they travel to Bowling Green, Oh. for a double dual meet with host Bowling Green State University and Cleveland State next Tuesday. Both Ohio schools visited South Bend last winter--Notre Dame lost to 
develand, 59-54, but did manage to win over the Falcons by an identical score. Bowling Green is currently 4-4 on the year while the Vikings boast a 7-3 mark. NOTE: The team was scheduled to travel to New Jersey this 
weekend for a meet at Monmouth College. However, the trip was cancelled due to travel complications. 
by Mike Henry Sports Writer 

A strong measure of discipline mixed with equal doses of de­termination and desire are necessary for any athlete to succeed on the college level. Coaches expect their players to develop a routine at practtce that will enable them to maximize their performance on the field. In a word, the function of practice sessions is conditioning---of an 
athlete's mental process as well as his body. 
Notre Dame's baseball team, coming off a promising fall camprugn, has been working out under the north cupola of the ACC for three weeks. They are preparing for the team's annual spnng tnp to Florida, with seven games scheduled in the Sunshine State. Head coach Tom Kelly expects this swing against rugged competition to steel the Irish for a 36-game regular season. 
While the Irish are at an obvious disadvantage due to the vagaries of winter, they have been able to set and accomplish certain goals at practice. Players are worked with on an indivtdual basis or in small groups where they are instructed on all facets of the game. By the time March rolls around, arms, legs and reflexes should be toned to a razor's edge for the funstuff--frolicking on the 
. red day and Bermuda grass under the benevolent Florida sun. ''Practice has been going along very smoothly,'' Kelly· noted as he prepared to send his charges through another spirited session. 
'The enthusiasm of the team has been infectious, and everyone is anxious to start the season. There is solid competition at more than one position, and this only serves as an added incentive to those players fighting for starting berths." 
"During practice, we break the squad up into pitchers and catchers, infielders, and out fielders. Each group does some running for about twenty minutes. Other than that, the team usually works at something different each day. For example, last week when the batting cage was taken out to make room for the hockey bleachers, we concentrated on rundowns and defenses against the bunt. We· like to vary the routine as much as possible." 
"We also work with indivi­duals to correct any deficiencies or bad habits a player may have picked up. Last fall we video­taped our pitchers and pointed out where we felt they could make a significant change. Righthanded freshman Greg Kot was keeping his from leg stiff as he came through on his delivery .. Now he's putting a lot more behind his pitches. Second baseman Tommy Caruso has to move in closer wtth a man on first base. With our infield defense, we should be capable of turning many more double Pl?vs.'' 
A.nother player to watch is pitcher Mike Desey. Desey suffered from a stramed rotaror cuff (the same injury that has stifled Kansas City Royal Steve Busby) and attempted to return too hastily. He's been throwoing well this winter and shows no sign of discomfort. His addition to an Irish staff led by Mike Bobinski and Mark Ladd will be a welcome plus for the Irish. 
The most solid part of Notre Dame's dub would seem to be the left side of the infield, spearheaded by captain Ricky Pullano and slugging third base­man Mark Simendinger. Both are coming off strong showings in the fall, and will be counted on to set an example for the younger members of the squad. 
'The spring trip to Florida is intended to be a treat for the players," Kelly said. "Everyone who goes on the triP. will get a chance to play. It wtll be a good learning experience.'' As preparation for the season begtns, Kelly is breeding a quiet self-confidence in relative obscurity--a confidence that will manifest itself in forty days.

another hoop 25 seconds later to regain the lead for her team­mates. A basket by Julie Froese tied the game again at 44-44. Notre Dame then went on a tear as Pat Meyer, Maggie Lally, Cashman, and Conboy all scored in an 8-0 burst that gave the Irish a 52-44 lead with 11:41 left in the game. 
Goshen refused to give up, however, and they remained tough until a bucket by Deb Fedderke brought them within one, 63-62, with 2:20 remaining. But a field goal by Jane Politiski, another one by Tricia McManus, and a free throw by Cashman gave the Irish an insurmountable six-point lead with 41 seconds left. Albrecht's hoop with 30 seconds remaining made the final margin four points. 
Individually for Goshen, Froese was high scorer with 23 points, followed by Albrecht with 
20. Three players had five rebounds each as the Goshen women were outrebounded by Notre Dame, 47-36. 
Maggie Lally led four Irish players in double figures with 13 points. Politiski added 12, and Conboy finished with 11. 
Politiski's 10 rebounds led Notre Dame in that department, while Conboy and McManus each chipped in with 7. Conboy also had rwo blocked shots, and Cashman dished out seven as­
sists.

by Paul Mullaney Assistant Sports Editor 
At the beginning ofthe season, Notre Dame fencing Coach Mike DeCicco was hopeful that the Irish epee squad would at least be respectable .. After all, the top three epeeists had to be replaced from last year's NCAA cham­pions. 
Gold medalist Bjorne Vaggo returned to his homeland of Sweden, while senior .captain Bill Kica and classmate John Strass received their diplomas. That left this year's group with little varsity experience. 
But after last Saturday, DeCicco is least concerned with the epee squad's performance. While the sabre squad posted an 18-9 weekend mark and the foilsmen were 20-7, the epee team won all but three of27 bouts as the Irish defeated Michigan­Dearborn (22-5), Chcago (20-7) and Detroit (20-7). 
The Irish, now 7-0 this year with 92 straight triumphs, will face Penn State, Michigan State afltl Ohio State this Saturday in Columbus, giving the epeeists the chance to prove that they are indeed for real. 
"Penn State and Ohio State will have good epee teams," said DeCicco. "It'II be a super test for 
Tankers drop fourth meet at theRock 
by Michael Ortman Sports Writer 
After Saturday afternoon's dis­mal 75-38 loss to Marshall, the Notre Dame swimmers are begin­ning to wonder if maybe Rockne Memorial Pool is cursed. The Irish, now 4-4 on the season, posted their third loss at the Rock without a victory this season. 
The meet wasn't a total loss for the Irish tankers, several individuals turned in dazzling performances. One key illdividual was sophomore star John Komora, who took both the 50 and the 100-yard freestyle events. In the 50-yard freestyle Komora and fellow Irish sop­homore John Krutsch clocked identical times of 22.7, but the judges' decision gave first place toKomora.. 
Freshman phenomena Donald Casey was heard from as ,,ell. In Notre Dame's frrst home loss this season, Casey broke Bob Reilly's three-year old record in the 200-yard blUtterfly. After erasing his own record in his next home meet, Casey did it again against 
Marshall. His time of 2:01.4 was .4 of a second faster than his pervious mark and a full two seconds quicker than Reilly's timeof2:03.4. Casey hasn't been terribly thrilled with his records, "Records are nice," he stated, "but winning would have been a whole lot !better." 
Diver Betsy Shadley scored her ftrst win as a member of the Irish sguad in the 1-meter (required) dives. Shadley, who last year became th~ first femal~ to make ~e squad ~ the teams 2~-year history tallied 162.65 pomts. ''Whether I'm a male or a female

our epee squad. In fact, Penn State will be the first team with really good overall balance that we've faced this year." 
The epeeists intend to keep up the pace they thus far have set for themselves, and are keeping Wayne State, an opponent later this month, in the back of their minds. 
Leading the way for the epee squad to date has been Mike Schermoly. The senior won all of seven bouts this oast weekend in Detroit. 
Andy Bon, a junior from Park Ridge, Ill., led the foil team with an 8-1 mark, while Mike Sullivan led the sabre team with a 7-1 slate. Sullivan, Notre Dame's to_p all-time fencer, suffered only his third loss in 158 career bouts. 
The Irish women increased their record to 6-0 by posting wins over Michigan-Dearborn (11-5) and Detroit (8-1). Dodee Carney, a junior transfer student, won all of six bouts, lifting her season mark to 15-0. 
St. Mary's team defeated Detroit, but lost to Michigan­Dearborn. That leaves SMC with a 3-2 record heading into this weekend.
