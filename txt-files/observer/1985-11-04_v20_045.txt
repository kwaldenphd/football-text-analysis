Senate disbandment referendum delayed: HPC to meet tonight 
By FRANK LIPO 
News Editor 
Astudent referendum concerning the possible:: disbandment of the Stu­dent Senate has been postponed one week, according to Maher Mouas­her, who handles constitutional af­fairs for Ombudsman. 
The referendum was scheduled for tomorrow. 
Aletter signed by presidents from nine halls calling for a special meeting of the Hall Presidents' Council tonight prompted the postponement. In the letter, delivered to The Observer last night, the presidents said that last week's vote, which approved an amend­ment to the constitution to disband the senate, was'"ta.ken In haste." 
The letter said, "Since we con­sider this issue of disbandment sig­nificant to student life, we feel we must reconsider our votes." 
"We're not saying people should say no to the disbandment. We're saying people should be more in­formed on the issue," said Glen Sgambati, Holy Cross Hall president. 
The ten signers of the letter com­prise one-third of the HPC. Accord­ing to HPC bylaws, that number is enough to call the special meeting. If a two-thirds quorum ( 17 of 25 mem­bers) attend the meeting tonight, the HPC can discuss the amend­ment. A majority of that quorum would have to vote to overturn last week's vote. 
"I think holding off a week is great. I'm not sure everyone knows what they're voting on," said Bill Healy, student body president and one of five sponsors of the amendment to disband the senate. 
"The key is misinformation," said Sgambati. In a vote before October break, the HPC voted by more than the necessary two-thirds majority to bring the disbandment issue before the student body in a referendum. 
In a second vote last week, the HPC proposed an amendment to the constitution to disband the senate. Sgambati said HPC Chairman Kevin Howard led the members ofthe HPC to believe the second vote was just an extension ofthe first vote and not the approval of the constitutional amendment. 
In effect, Sgambati said, the HPC did not know what it was voting on because the line-by-line changes to the constitution were not yet made at the time of the vote. He said the signers of the letter questioned the role the HPC would play in the ab­sence of the senate. 
"We have enough things going on in the hall . . . (The amendment) gives us a lot ofauthority and power that we didn't have," said Sgambati. "Hall presidems have a lot ofobliga­tions to their dorms ... More respon­

November 3, 1985 
By votin~ last Tuesday, we, as members of the Hall Presidents' Council, proposed an amendment to the constitution to disband the Student Senate. We feel that this vote was taken in haste. We were intentionally misled as to the content and ramifications of'this amendment. Since we consider this issue of disbandment significant to student life, we feel that we must reconsider our votes. Therefore, we ·would like ~o call a special meeting of the HPC for ~onday, November 4, at 8:00p.m., in the conference room of

ND student gov't starts newsletter 
By PATRICK CREADON 
StaffReporter 
Edt tor's note: Tbts article ts part one of a two-part series examin­Ing new Notre Dame campus publications. 
Notre Dame student govern­ment recently published the first of a new twice-per-semester newsletter titled We 'Ibe People to raise interest in student govern­ment and its activities, according to Chuck Beretz, editor-in-chief of the publication. 
"What we're actually doing is selling ourselves (student govern­ment)," Beretz said. 
Student Body President Bill lkaly "came to me at the begin­ning of the year with the idea of putting out a student government newsletter. His main rationale be­hind it was to make student government more accessible to the students," said Beretz. 
Beretz is also the press secretary for the Healy-lawrence ad­ministration. 
Several students, according to Beretz, questioned whether the newsletter was a result of much of the controversy now surrounding the llealy-lawrence administra­tion. 
"'Ibe fact that the newsletter came out at this time was a com­
; 

plete coincidence," he said. "It had Notre Dame's rates were the hig­nothing to do with the present hest, according to the report. conflicts in student government." Beretz noted that because the 
The staff of We The People con­sists mainly of Beretz and four reporters. All of the laying out of the paper is done by Beretz himself on his personal computer. The newsletter is distributed to each dorm by dorm representatives, ac­cording to Beretz. 


"Everyone who is involved with student government has. input to We The People," he said. "For in­stance, the article about Notre Dame's high phone rates for stu­dents started out as only a sugges­tion, but when we looked into it further, we found quite a story." 
That article reported that Notre Dame students pay nearly 300 per­cent more for their phone services than do students at Indiana Univer­sity. In all, six colleges were sur­veyed, and it was revealed that newsletter is a student govern­ment publication, the articles only will concern student government affairs. 
In the first issue of We The People, a personal letter from Healy and lawrence was inserted. The letter was Healy's idea in an ef­fort to clear up some ofthe present conflicts surrounding his ad­ministration and will not be a regular feature in issues to come, Beretz said. 
Money was set aside in the stu­dent government's budget for the ' newsletter, according to Beretz. 
"Although there is money set aside for the newsletter, we are probably going to sell advertising to outsiders. For now, however, we are only advertising student government activities," said Beretz. 
"I feel that this was a great idea by Bill (Healy)," Beretz said. "We really needed something like this for student government. 
"Before We The People, we didn't have anything that informed the students of our progress on a regular basis," he said. "Hopefully this publication will be carried on by student government ad­ministrations in the future." 
The next publication of We The People is tentatively scheduled for early December, Beretz said. 

'Real Beginning' ends: recall effort disbands 
ByTIIERESA GUARINO 
SaintMary's ExecutiveEditor 
Saying that with the force of stu­dent activism, "the current student government can be the effective leaders we need," the group of stu­dents organized to recall Student Body President Bill Healy formally abandoned their efforts to continue with the recall in a letter to The Ob­server yesterday. 
The students, with Bill Krais and Mike Vore as co-spokesmen, met with Healy Friday afternoon, to dis­cuss the reasons for the recall, ac­cording to Krais. 
"We had an open dialogue between the group and himself (Healy)," Krais said. "We expressed how we felt he had not represented the student body." 
The letter states that Healy and Student Body Vice President Duane lawrence had met with the student group to plan "effective means of protest" against recent administra­tion decisions dealing with the Dil­lon tailgater incident and parietals issues. 
"We told Bill we want to see him express the student outrage to the administration much better," said Krals. "He has promised us a change." 
"The (student government-sponsored) forum Wednesday was part of the signs that Bill was willing to listen and exchange ideas," said Anne Marie Finch, a member of the recall group. "We wanted him to state his position and we think he has." 
The group plans to keep, for two to four weeks, the 800 signatures they had gathered on petitions to hold the recall referendum. "We'll see If other people express an Inter­est in the recall and we'd turn them over," said Krais. 
The letter also states that If enough students contact the group, protesting the abandonment of the recall effort, the members would reconsider their position. "Eight­hundred people signed those peti­tions and if they still want it, we'd have a responsibility to them," Finch said. 
In the statement, group members state that "our fight will continue, al-. beit transformed," and urge students to contact them to "further voice legitimate student concern." 
"We feel that we've acheived what we set out to achieve," said Kra1s. "Our efforts had turned Into unintended consequences." 
The letter urges students to retain the Student Senate in the upcoming referendum, saying "it Is the only truly representative body com­prised solely of students that we have." 
To vote in favor ofdisbanding the senate "would be to vote away our voice In student government," the letter states.

More leading business executives took their un­dergraduate degrees at Notre Dame than at any other Catholic col­lege or university, according to a survey by the Financial & Economic Information Company of New York City. The study was based on Poor's Register, which contains data on approximately 70,000 presidents, vice presidents and directors of more than 40,000 U.S. corporations. When compared to other private univer­sities, Notre Dame's 641 undergraduate alumni in the survey ranked the University seventh in the nation, and when compared to all American institutions of higher learning, Notre Dame's ranking is 20th. When the survey was done three years ago, Notre Dame was first among Catholic institutions, 11th among private universities and 23rd among all U.S. colleges and universities.-The Observer

Nineteen years ago yesterday, Notre Dame students sat down at lunch and opened The Observer -for the first time. 
"People were sort of stunned by it," said The Obser­
ver's premiere editor-in-chief, Robert Sam Anson, ofthe 
newpublication. "It was a whole different breed ofcat." 
The Obse~er drew its life from the corpse ofanother student publication, The Voice. In late October 1966 Steve Feldhaus, editor ofThe Voice, "metwith a handtui of key staffers, assessed the newspaper's manifold diseases, and decreed euthanasia," according to the first issue ofThe Observer. Feldhaus tossed away what many called the rag, but he didn't throw in the towel. 
"Because we killed the product didn't mean we were murdering the idea. There was a need for a news­oriented publication then, and there is now," Feldhaus wrote after The Voice went hoarse. Anson, who had been associate editor of Scholastic, decided to join Feldhaus' venture as co-editor-in-chiefofThe Observer. It was agreed that Feldhaus would retain financial con­trol while Anson assumed responsibility for news con­tent, design and personnel. 
Not only did The Obser­ver take its name from the National Observer, but it also borrowed its logo. Notre Dame's newspaper did not have anyone to design its own masthead and Anson always had admired that of the professional jour­nal. 
In its first issue The Ob­server dedicated itself to do just what its name proclaimed, "observe, remark, notice, comment and adhere." As Anson wrote in 1975, the newspaper did more than just print accounts of the latest good deeds of the Fightin' Irish and the Blue Circle. It editorialized against the Vietnam war and raised the demand that students be given a meaningful voice in the University's affairs. "We took special delight in going after sacred cows," Anson wrote in reflection. 
These sacred cows ranged from Gen. William Westmoreland to Dr. Tom Dooley. The Observer broke the news that the senior class had voted to name Westmoreland "Patriot of the Year." In the same issue was an editorial denouncing this choice along with the basic concept ofsuch an award. In another issue Obser­ver editors suggested that Dooley might be in th~ grip of the Central Intelligence Agency. The headline read, "An Ugly American After All?" 
Anson described his publication as outspoken with a definite political slant...It was different and I think the

hers make love. He used a five letter synonym, which in another context can be found on the shelf of a hardware store. 
Less than amused, Father Hesburgh called the article "the most irresponsible act in the history of Notre Dame," according to Anson and Feldhaus. The Univer­sity president considered dismissing the two but in­stead accepted a formal apology presented to every Notre Dame student

change. The newspaper's two new mastheads since Anson's first "borrowed" logo are insignificant alterations·when compared to other areas ofgrowth. 
Since 1966 the newspaper has grown from a weekly to a daily and the average issue has increased from 12 to l 6 pages. Today more than 100 students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's comprise The Observer staff. Together these people work to present the issues and events of both campuses fairly and accurately and to provide a forum for the free expression ofideas. 
Considering all of the improvement, I'd like to think that a more efficient distribution system is the reason why fewer people wait outside The Observer office for each day's paper today than in 1966.

USA Today publisher Black heads 'fastest growing paper' 
By ANN KALTENBACH 
Copy Editor 
Cathleen Black, publisher of USA Today, told a forum at Saint Mary's Friday afternoon the publication, once "ridiculed" by skeptics, is now the nation's fa..~test growing new newspaper. 
"We sell I,400,000 copies per day," Black said, adding that ap­proximately 90 percent of the country is covered by USA Today. 
Black. the first female executive­in-residence at Saint Mary's, spoke at a luncheon of the College's Business Associates and lectured in an ad­vertising cla..'is. 
Speaking at a forum in Stapleton Lounge, Black explained the newspaper's struggle for success. 
"We were ridiculed by more skep­tics than you can imagine," she said. "Three years ago, people didn't think liSA Today had a chance of making it." 
Black said the press was USA Today's worst critic. Moreover, she said, the paper was dubbed "The McPaper ofJournalism," referring to McDonald's brand offast food versus USA Today's brand of news stories. 
Defending the paper from such criticism, Black highlighted the credibility of the Gannett Co., Inc., the parent company of USA Today. She said Gannett is a nationwide in­formation company which publishes 87 daily newspapers, in­cluding USA Today and 38 non­dailies. It operates six television and 14 radio stations and the largest out­door advertising company in North America. 
She said Gannett also offers marketing, news, television produc­tion, research and satellite informa­tion services. 
Black also spoke of Gannett's strides in other areas. 
"Gannett is the number one com­pany in affirmative action and equal opportunity. Gannett has felt firmly for affirmative action for a long time," Black said. 
Supporting this statement, she said Gannett employs 29,000 per­sons, 43 percent of whom are women. She added those statistics are "practically unheard of in any company today." 
Black joined USA Today from a position as first woman publisher of a weekly consumer magazine, New York, which she helped turn around to a highly profitable publication. A graduate ofTrinity College, a private women's college in Washington D.C., she previously served as as­sociate publisher of Ms. magazine. 
She sits on the Gannett Manage­ment Committee and recently was chosen as an insider of the Gannett Board of Directors. 

Discussing women in manage­ment positions, she said, "I believe managers are not born. Managers learn as we move along." 
Quoting former congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro, she added,"Men assume office with the assumption 

Cathleen Black 

of success. Women assume office with the burden ofproof." 
"I have a lot of self-confidence," Black said, adding, "It's impossible to move forward ... without think­ing ofyourselfas a winner." 
Black said, although she's "not driven like Lee Iacocca," good judgement in management is impor­tant. Black added she likes being a manager and the sense of authority she can assume from it. 
Nevertheless, the publisher said, "I have been in the hot spot and in the limelight. Much of the press coverage about me and USA Today has been very positive." 
On another note, Black discussed USA Today's strategies for profitability, including advertising revenue and cost control. 
"The cost has been staggering for USA Today. In the first two years, money was spent to accomplish the job. Cost control in the next three to five years wih be much more strin­gent," she said. 
A four-color advertising page, when the newspaper was launched, cost a few thousand dollars, she said. Today, it has soared to S33,46I. 
"We will be aggressive in page cost in the coming years," said Black. 
As of Nov. I, advertising prices were increased seven percent while circulation was increased I00,000. Another advertising increase of 9.8 percent will be implemented March I, Black said. 
"We must be aggressive in' pricing to achieve profitability," Black added. 
Black noted that the price per issue, originally 25 cents, recently was hiked from 35 cents to 50 cents. 
"We have led the charge for the newspaper industry. We saw no fal­loff (of readership) between the 35 cent to 50 cent increase," she said. 
This showed the USA Today's  
"readers are hooked," Black added.  
The wide circulation of USA  
Today constitutes much of its  
success, according to Black. The  
newspaper is printed in 30 cities  
around the United States and is sold  
in 113,000 vending machines  
around the country, which Black  
amusingly referred to a..~ "those won­derful blue and white machines that  I_,  
have graced the landscape of  ~  
America."  ~  
Black said the International  '  
Herald Tribune, the liSA Today world edition, is selling 20,000  1 1  
copies per day in thirty countries  
after only I 7 months of business in  
this sector. This newspaper, accord­ 
ing to Black, is rivaling the Wall  
Street Journal Europe which sells  
28,000 copies p,er day.  
"For Americans overseas," Black  
said "we are the exact right read."  
USA Today hit the presses three  
years ago with the ambition of be­ 
coming the nation's only national in­ 
terest daily newspaper. It is known  
for its heavy dose of entertainment  
and human interest stories, two  
pages of state-by-state news briefs  
and its sports section geared to  
television.  
Black told an advertising class at  
Saint Mary's that because of the  
newspaper's color and brevity, "We  
are geared to the TV generation."  


Founder of Tenn. 'former prisoner' program visits ND 
ByJOE MARKEY 
News Staff 
Father jack Ulckey, the founder of a Na.~hville, Tenn. prisoner relea..~e program, was on campus last week to discuss the possibility ofcreating a similar program at Notre Dame. 
Hickey's program, called Dismas House, has students and community volunteers help former prisoners readjust to society. 
Hickey first saw the need for such a program while serving as chaplain at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. 
Through a community outreach program for prisoners which Hickey had coordinated with some Vander­bilt students, he noticed prisoners being released with no place to go. 
"Any stable relationships which the prisoner may have once had are lost while he is in prison ... he is released into a cold community where he is treated a..~ an outcast," said Hickey. 
In order to satisfy the needs of released prisoners, Hickey asked active students ofhis group to form a "collective." Eleven students volun­teered to share a house, under the

Hickey emphasized the humanity of the prisoner saying that after release he should be called a former prisoner rather than an ex-convict. "Former prisoner" suggests im­prisonment while "ex-convict" connotes the offense, Hickey said.

"A criminal is not just a criminal, but usually only a poverty-stricken person with inadequate resourses ­no education, no skills, no family, no friends," said Hickey. 
In prison, where crime is the so­cia! norm, the person's character Is impoverished instead of rehabllitated and his freedom and sense of responsibility are taken away, according to Hickey. 
"Lack of freedom is the lack of freedom to choose good over evil," said Hickey.

can only live from day to to day, Hickey said. 
Dismas House seeks to help former prisoners utlllze their freedom in order to discover ai­ternatives and to give them con­fidence in relationships, according to Hickey. 
"At first they are suspicious be­cause they have never been able to trust anyone, and they think that Dis-mis House is trying to exploit them somehow," Hickey said. 
"Once they realize Dismas House is sincere, they feel happiness and see that life is not a downer," said

creative lifestyle, we really can affect 
things." 
The role of the student in Dlsmas 

House is two-fold, he said. While the 
students serve as role models, they 
receive a rich learning experience as 
well because most students have 
been isolated from different types of 
people. 
"It's a pretty normal place for the 

students;" he said. "We're not 
looking for a student with a mission­
ary or counselor attitude -just a nor­
mal person." 
The atmosphere at Dismas House 

is safe and non-violent, he said, ad­
ding that the two basic rules are "no 
violence and no threats ofviolence." 
Eight students live in the house 

with eight former prisoners. Stu­.dents pay rent, which covers three­fourths of the operating budget, and do chores. There are volunteer 
cooks, he said. 
The head of the house holds three 

intensive interviews with the 
prisoner seeking admittance into 
Dismas House. Once a former 
prisoner is accepted into Dismas 
House, he gets a job within an 
average of ten working days, Hickey 
said. 
Hickey said that although some 

people do not fully understand the 
situation and tend to remain ig­
norant, "most are glad to sec some­
thing accomplished." 
Similar programs are beingstarted at the Universty of Vermont, Trinity College, and Saint Michael's College, he said. 
Director of Community Relations James Roemer has been appointed to head the planning of this project at Notre Dame.

U.S. proposes ceiling on strategic bombers and missiles 
Aseoclated Press 
HELSINKI, Finland -The United States has proposed a ceiling on American and Soviet strategic bom­bers-and a freeze on nuclear missiles in Europe as part of a new arms con­trol accord with Moscow, a senior 
U.S. official said yesterday. 
Other key elements of the package now before Soviet negotiators in Geneva include a ceiling of 3,000 on long-range nuclear warheads and no limits on submarine-launched cruise missiles. 
The official, who spoke on condi­tion of anonymity, said there is "compromise" in President Reagan's proposal to overcome what he described as "hookers" -snags -in

sibilities would make me an 
ineffective hall president," he said. 
"I understand what they are doing," said Howard. "They want to understand what the role ofthe HPC will be. That is their right." 
Under the proposed amendment, the HPC shall advance the position of the student body-on issues con­cerning student life, approve all cabinet appointments, approve ap­pointments made by the Student Ac­tivities Board Steering Committee, and bring bills of impeachment against various elected and ap­pointed officials. 
"Discussion (of campus-wide issues) will move to the HPC," said Mouasher. 
Also under the amendment, the Campus Life Council would determine who would represent the student body at Board of Trustees meetings, the budget committee would handle fiscal work as an in­dependent committee with a slightly changed composition, Obud would handle elections by its own authority with appeals to the HPC, and the judicial coordinator would select the faculty and administration members of the judicial review board. The judicial review board handles appeals in disciplinary procedures. 
The CLC retains final approval of legislative actions tinder the amend­ment. 
the plan Soviet leader Mikhail Gor­bachev submitted five weeks ago. 
For instance, the ceiling of 3,000 on intercontinental ballistic missile warheads is 500 higher than the ini­tial U.S. position in the Geneva negotiations. It would allow the Soviets to retain more of their land­based missile arsenal, the heart of Soviet nuclear strength. 
Gorbachev called for a 3,600­warhead limit on strategic ground missiles, bombers and nuclear sub­marines. 
The U.S. official said that if the Soviets accepted the American package deal, there would be no mobile Soviet strategic missiles or any new heavy intercontinental bal­listie missiles added to the super­powers' arsenals. 
This would presumably prompt the United States, in return, to scuttle the single-warhead Midget Man, which has stirred complaints by some members of Congress. The Soviet SS-24 missile and SS-25 mobile missile are much more ad­vanced than the Midget Man; which is still on the drawing broad. 
But the outlook for an early agree­ment appears dim. Secretary ofState George Shultz, who is expected to discuss prospects for an accord during two days of talks in Moscow beginning today, told reporters the two sides remain "quite a distance apart." 
The main stumbling block is a Soviet demand for a "total ban" on all arms in space. The senior official said Moscow's definition encom­"passes all U.S. attempts "to counter

After a rest stop here, Shultz leaves for Moscow this morning to discuss preparations for the Nov. 19­20 Reagan-Gorbachev summit meeting with Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Gorbac­hev. 
Shultz made a courtesy call yester· day on President Mauno Koivisto and Foreign Minister Paavo Vayrynen. Finland is neutral in East· West disputes.

Gorbachev's call for a total of 
6.000 nuclear "charges" lumped bombers in with all kinds of nuclear weapons, from potent globe­girdling missiles to mines. 
American and Soviet intermediate-range missiles in Europe, meanwhile, would be frozen at 140 under the U.S. proposal. This would require a reduction of 103 Soviet SS-20 missiles and no reductions by the United States in the Pershing 2 and cruise missiles.deployed among NATO allies. 
The United States, however, would not build up to the 572 total approved by NATO by 1988.

Dillon, administration take issue to the extremes 
You are entering into a world where all sense of reality bas disappeared, where stu­dents think they can do anything they please, where New Year's Eve parties are broken up after 2 a.m. because they violate parletals, where looking at two sides ofan issue is un­deniably absurd. You are entering into . ... 
Hello? Is anybody home? 
It is time for somebody to go out and find the residents of Dillon Hall and the members ofthe Notre Dame administration responsible for making the rules that govern student life and bring them back to reality. 
Mike Wilkins here, there and back 
It seems members of both groups have taken a vacation from the real world and become at least temporary residents of "The Twilight Zone." They have stopped offat that dreaded place where all your worst fears, no matter how crazy they are, become reality through the powers ofyour imagination. 
Along the way, Dillon residents have some­how come to believe that there are no bounds to the exhibitions of their spirit, and that the administration is trying to take over their lives by making rules that suddenly appear bet· ween the lines ofdu Lac. 
And the administration has been struck by the thought that the best way to punish a group of people is to take away privileges from those people and all their friends, and that the best way to get a better handle on students is to make rules that suddenly appear from between the lines ofdu Lac. 
Truthfully, you have to admire the spirit continuously displayed by members ofDillon. They throw themselves Into everything they do and set the example for the rest of us to follow when it comes to supporting Notre Dame in virtually any endeavor. But sometimes Dillonites get a little carried away. 
They do things that could be considered of­fensive by administrators, alumni or even stu· dents. When this happens, the administration has certain reactions. 
At the same time, the administration has a justifiable role of maintaining a certain stan­dard oflife at Notre Dame. This is certainly an admirable goal and Notre Dame has long been known for the quality atmosphere that pervades the campus. But sometimes the ad· ministration gets a little carried away. They try to control students' lives instead of trying to guide them. When this happens, students have certain reactions. 
Such is the situation now. A number of Dil· Ion residents got carried away at a tailgater on another campus not too long ago. The ad· ministration responded by taking away one of Dillon's SYRs and assigning the dorm a service project. 
The folks in the administration are mad be· cause the conduct of a relatively small num­ber ofstudents gave a very bad impression, for which the Notre Dame's administration has received a large number of calls and com· plaints. 
The folks in Dillon are mad because the whole dorm is being punished for the ac­tivities of a relatively small number of its members and because the punishment came as a result of activities that took place nowhere near the friendly confines of Notre Dame. 
Both sides have legitimate complaints, but on their little vacations from reality they have each failed to see the other's point ofview and have put things terribly out ofproportion. 
There are certain things both sides must realize. First, like it or not, students at Notre Dame represent the University at all times. Embarrassing conduct reflects poorly not only on individual students, but on the Uni­versity as well. The University has a reputation to protect; that reputation played at least some role in bringing each of us here. When a group of students does something damaging to this reputation, they should expect to be punished. 
The second important thing to realize is if the administration wants to set out rules for students to follow, they must be enforced f.lirly. This means students must know what kind of conduct is prohibited in dillerent situations and that entire groups of people will not be punished for the actions ofcertain members of that group. If the University Is going to establish rules aimed at protecting Its reputation, it seems only fair that the students should be informed ofthese rules before they go out and break them, and that only those students who actually do decide to break the rules are punished for their conduct. 
So with these ideas in mind, I propose the following suggestions in an effon to bring Dil­lon and the administration back from "The Twilight Zone." 
To Dillon Hall: All those residents involved in the tailgater incident should step forward and turn themselves in. Since their conduct has damaged the entire dorm, these in· dividuals should be punished within the 
dorm, preferably with some kind of work to 
be performed for the dorm. 
Also, In an offering of good faith, the dorm 
as a whole should volunteer to take on a 
service project either with the University at 
large, or better yet, with some organization or 
individual outside of campus. This will show 
the dorm is worried about Its reputation and 
Notre Dame's and will work to see that those 
reputations are not damaged. 
To the administration: Give Dillon its SYR 
back. This is a much bigger punishment than 
you realize, and also much bigger than most 
Dillon residents would be willing to admit. 
This will show the residents of Dillon and the 
entire student body you are willing to 
cooperate with students if they will do the 
same. 

Also, establish firm Interpretations ofdu Lac so students will know exactly what Is ex­pected ofthem. Show the students you are not trying to make rules that prevent them from -having a good time with the Notre Dame flag flying overhead,_ but are merely trying to do your best to protect the reputation and atmo­
sphere that is so important to Notre Dame. 
The big question among students, and 
probably among members of the administra­
tion as well, is just how far the provisions ofdu 
Lac reach. The administration avoided this 
issue last year during the spring break Inci­
dent. Now, the administration must face this 
issue and provide students with some clear 
guidance. Unless the administration clarifies 
its position soon, we are all going to end up In 
"The Twilight Zone."

NAACP will benefit entire ND black community 
The National Association for the Advance­ment of Colored People Is an organization which over the past several decades, has es­tablished Itself as the most powerful minority Institution in the history of the United States. Officially founded in 1909, the organization was designed to elevate the socio-economic and political status of blacks in the United States. 
Lester Flemons guest column 
As the years progressed, the NAACP gained tremendous power and influence, particularly in U.S. politics. In the 1960s the organization made political history by winning passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Bill, the 1965 Voting Rights Bill, and the 1968 Fair Housing Act. Membership In the NAACP also progressed, reaching 91 ,000 in 1919 and a staggering 400,000 In 1985. In the 50-year period im­mediately following the NAACP's inception, blacks gained more rights than they had gained In the previous 200 years. 
Recognizing the need for such an organiza­tion at Notre Dame, several black students took the initiative and set out to charter the organization last spring. Led by senior govern­ment major Carlton West, and assisted by Melva Martin, president of the local South Bend NAACP chapter, the group succeeded in establishing the Notre Dame's first NAACP college chapter. "Black students at Notre Dame's need to know that they have an or­ganization like the NAACP behind them," stated West. 
"Not only will the organization add unity to the black population at Notre Dame, but it will also give black students an organized network for which they may regtSter any complaints or observations they may have." 
West and his colleagues noticed that In the fall of 1984, Notre Dame had admitted only 34 black students out of a class of 1,81 0. "The University's admittance ofblack students is an area which must be improved," West said. "If the administration does not take a course of action, the students will." 
In addition to the problem of black admit· tance, West also cited Notre Dame's lack of black professors as well as reports of dis· crimination in dorms and classrooms. "In the past, black students and other minorities have had no one to complain to but themselves," West said. "Now these students have a structured organization which will not only listen to their complaints, but thoroughly in­vestigate them as well." 
According to West, another objective ofthe Notre Dame NAACP college chapter will be to improve the relationship between white and black students at Notre Dame. "It's difficult for whites and blacks to socialize together at Notre Dame," he said. "It's a disheartening situation because blacks tend to become is­olated and therefore left out of the Notre Dame social life. 
"I've heard several white studentscomplain about the social life at Notre Dame. It would be interesting ifsome of those white students c<'Uld be black for a few weeks. Then, they would really have something to complain about." 
West is hoping that a proportionate number of white students will recognize the need for the NAACP at Notre Dame and will become members ofthe organization. "Ifthe organiza· tion is truly to ba a success, we need par­ticipaton from all students ofall nationalities," asserted West. "It's time for the student body at Notre Dame to come together for a very important cause. The fact that we are all human beings should override whether orror not we are white or black." 
On Sunday, Sept. 28, the Notre Dame NAACP college chapter held its first general meeting. West was not surprised that only 40 students attended the meeting. 
"I think that many of the students are waiting to see if the organization is for real," said West. "Once they see that we are ded· icated to make this organization a success, I'm certain greater participation will result. 
"Every senior must look within himselfand realize that we did not do everything we could to better the situation for blacks at Notre Dame, but the future is always bright. If 
we want to see prosperity grow, we must act 
on the future's behalf," West concluded. 
Although only 40 students attended the 
first meeting, West reported that membership 
for the organization, nevertheless, has 
doubled since then. 
West strongly urges any students Interested in becoming members of the Notre Dame NAACP chapter to sign up in the Black Cul­tural Arts Center office on the third floor of the LaFortune Student Center, or call any of the following students: Carlton West ( 277· 7149), Dennis Tillman ( 1521 ), Martin Rodgers ( 19 51 ), or Lester Flemons ( 26I 0 ).

Breeder's darkens award race 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Breeders' Cup Day at Aqueduct provided exciting com­petition, and when it was over, the championship picture was as cloudy as the skies under which the seven races were run. 
"I think it made it more compl­icated for you guys," trainer John Veitch told a group ofreporters Sun­day when asked how his Proud Truth's upset victory Saturday in the S3 million Classic would affect the races for the 3-year-old champion­ship and Horse of the Year. 

It also kept Chiefs Crown from probably clinching both titles. The Marlboro Cup winner, who also won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in 1984, finished fourth, beaten by about 10 lengths by Proud Truth.

ND trounces Loyola in soccer season finale 
By PETE SK.IKO 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's soccer . team went out in style. 
After a somewhat disappointing 
season, the Irish finished the year 
with three impressive wins, cul­
minating in their 7-0 whitewashing 
of Loyola (Chicago) Friday after­
noon at Alumni Field. 
"I'm proud of the way our guys 
finished strong," said second-year 
head coach Dennis Grace. "Three 
wins in a row is a great way to end it. 
We played well, exceptional at 
times, and we used a lot of good 
things that we've learned throug­
hout the year." 
Senior John Gibbs, playing in his 
last game for Notre Dame, scored 
the first goal of the Loyola game. 
Ironically, it was his first and only 
goal of the year. 
Another senior, Dave Miles, 
scored the 23rd goal of his prolific 
four-year career in his final game at 
Notre Dame. Miles had mixed emo­
tions about the end of his career. 
"In a way. I'm glad that it's over," 
said Miles. "I need some more time 
to get back to my schoolwork. But, 
of course, I'll miss playing again." 
Miles was disappointed with his

the problems that he and Notre Dame had to a tougher schedule. 
"I felt that we learned a lot this year, we learned that we could play with some pretty good teams," noted Miles, "but I had less con­fidence in my game this year be­cause of the increased caliber of play." 
Joe Sternberg, a freshman who led Notre Dame in scoring with ten goals this year, was happy with the way he contributed this year and is very optimistic about the next few years. 
"The team really pulled together on our trip to Florida (over fall break) and I hope that our strong finish sets the stage for next year. With a good recruiting year next year, we could start out the year ranked pretty high. The tough schedule we played this year helped me get a lot of experience." 
All in all, Coach Grace was pleased with his team's development over the last season and is looking for­ward to coaching his third season. 
"If everybody works hard in the offseason and we do some decent recruiting, we'll be competitive with everyone we play next year. I can only hope that we continue to grow as a team like we did toward the end of this year."

quillare. Sobilo's goal came on a beautiful shorthanded effort at 8:'59. 
In the third period, Kent State tried to rally around O'Neill's goal at 4:21, which cut the Irish lead to 5-4. But the Irish responded with scores from Mooney and Whitmore to put the game out of reach. Tonna and Chapman rounded out the scoring to make the final score 8-'5. 
Irish head coach Lefty Smith, while happy to get two wins, wasn't completely pleased by his club's weekend effort. 
"Last night (Friday) we didn't play 
well," commented Smith. "We need 
a lot of work on shooting, as we had 
too many missed opportunities. 
Also, we need to work on defense in 
our own end. Right now we're too 
tentative. We're not clearing the 
zone." 
Smith also expressed concerned 
about the play ofhis sophomores. 
"They have to play with more 
poise, but they're hard-working so it 
looks encouraging." 
Despite the problems, Smith did 
give further cause for optimism. 
"Tonight (Saturday) Is the first en­couraging, game. The return of Bob Thebeau helped. His ability to get the puck out ofour end is important, and he is needed on the power play. 
''I'm pleased with the way Rich Sobilo is coming on," Smith con­tinued. "Waldbillig had been strug­gling so it's nice to see him score."

In the opening contest at Stepan Field, Flanner defeated Stanford in a game that could have been classified as two different games instead of two different halves. The opening halfbelonged to Stanford's combina­tion of strong defense and powerful offense, while the second half showed some creative play calling and gutsy play on the part ofFlanner. 
Stanford oi>ened the scoring with an impressive first quarter drive which featured a few short passes and ended with a short run by Joe Davey. With the ensuing extra point, Flanner quickly trailed by seven points. During the rest of the first half, Stanford thwarted any attempt by Flanner's offense to score while their own offense ran up and down the field. Even though Stanford produced a lot of offense, their first quarter score proved to be their only one ofthe game. 
In the second half, the previously stagnant Flanner team came to life. After a fumble recovery, their of­fense turned to some trick plays that eventually resulted in a touchdown. On a third down play, Flanner ran a reverse accounting for 30 yards. On the very next play, they called a

SMC soccer team blanks Loyola 
By ANDREA LaFRENIERE 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's soccer team defeated the Loyola (Chicago) soc­cer club 7-0 Saturday at Angela Field. 
The competition marked the end of the season for the Belles, who finished the season with a record of 5-9. 
Saint Mary's played an aggtessive game, esj:>ecially in the first half when it scored six ofits seven goals. 
Senior Sue Schier! started things off when she put in a shot seven minutes into the game. Schier! matched that goal minutes later off an assist by junior Mary Anne Perri. 
Sophomore Karen Chandler made it 3-0 on an unassisted tally, and freshman Theresa Harrington regis­tered the next two goals. Harrington scored her first goal on a free kick and was assisted on her second goal by freshman Sarah Creech. 
Perri scored the sixth goal for the Belles and was assisted on the play by Schier!. The team's final goal came towards the end of the game when Schier! came across the middle to put in the score and com­plete the hat trick. 
Belles' Head Coach john Akers 
was pleased with the team's strong 
performance, particularly in the first 
halfof the game. 
"I was glad to see us end the 
season with such a good game. We 
played the kind of soccer we're 
capable of playing, and we worked 
well together as a team, especially in 
the first half. It was good to finish on 
a positive note," Akers said. 
Akers attributed much of the 
team's recent success to assistant a late second quarter field goal. 
The second half belonged to both team's tenacious defenses. Alumni scored the only points of the half as Schuermann again hit Laughlin for a 10yard score to give Alumni a 12-10 lead. Again, the extra point was muffed. 
On their last possession, Howard came inches short of advancing to the semi-finals. Starting with poor field possession, Howard decided to air it out.. They initially threw short, but with time running out, Tom Pas­sinault, Howard's top receiver, grabbed a long bomb. Just when it looked as though he would scamper the last 25 yards for the touchdown, Joe Dearie, an Alumni defensive back, made a diving, game-saving tackle. With almost no time left, Howard tried to win on a 35 yard field goal. As the ball flew threw the air, six anonymous Alumni residents stood below the goal posts and trie to jinx the ball which fell inches short. A belated fun bunch embrace followed as the six began to celebrate. 
"We all felt extremely lucky to have won this game," said Joe Puetz "Our defense bent all day, but it never broke. They really beat them­selves because of all the penalties. If they had not received a five yard penalty before their final field goal attempt, it would have been good by a couple ofyards. 
"When it counted, we played har­der than they did," continued Puetz. "The game was physical to the end, and our players withstood the chal­lege. In addition to the great play of Laughlin and Schuermann, Chad Smith ran extremely well while the whole defense as a unit should be given credit. (Bill) Smith came up with a crucial fumble recovery, and Dearie made the tackle that preserved our victory." 
"We played inconsistently," added freshman linebacker Mark Gibbs, "but in the end we were tough when we needed to be." 
"We could have cleaned a few more clocks," added nosegaurd jim Gero jokingly,"but we ran out of time." 
Next Sunday, Alumni will meet Sorin, and Flanner will meet Grace on Cartier Field in the semi-finals. Both Sorin and Grace received first­round byes due to their regular season finishes. The winners ofthese games meet in two weeks for the In­terhall championship.
