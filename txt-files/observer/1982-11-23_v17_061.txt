Johnson & Johnson has distributed more than 20 million Tylenol coupons worth $2.50 each to entice American into replacing the painkiller capsules they threw away in fear. Extra­Strength Tylenol capsules will be back on store shelves nationwide in new tamper-resistant packaging by the end of December, three months after poisonings in the Chicago area prompted many people to get rid of their Tylenol. On Sunday, Johnson & Johnson began a 520 million campaign to promote the product. The 20 million coupons were inserted in Sunday newspapers, and the giant phar­maceutical firm intends to give out another 60 million coupons on the next two Sundays, said Lawrence G. Foster, vice president for public relations. "The object is to replace the Tylenol thrown away because of fear," he said. "It's also to get Tylenol back in the households." Seven Chicago-area residents who took Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules laced with cyanide died in late September, prompt­ingjohnson & johnson to recall all Tylenol capsules nationwide. ­

Communist Party chiefYuri Andropov said yes­terday the future belongs to detente, but declared that the Kremlin will make no "preliminary concessions" toward improving relations with the United States. In his first address to the party leadership in Moscow since being named general secretary Nov. 12 to replace the late leonid I. Brezhnev, Andropov stressed the continuation of Brezhnev's foreign policies, including Kremlin overtures to China. On domestic matters, he announced the promotion of a former regional deputy director of the KGB to Politburo voting status, and praised the work ofAndrei P. Kirilenko, whose retirement from the Politburo was officially announced yesterday after several months of rumors that the 76-year-old, No. 3 Kremlin man was out. -AP 
In north Tehran, where Western "corruption" once made its biggest inroads, there are fewer mosques. And these days there are also many fewer movies, con t certs, non-religious or English-language books, and music programs on radio. "The 1V we call 'mullah-vision,' " quipped a young middle-class housewife. "About all they show are religious programs and speeches by mul­lahs." As a result, unofficial "video shops," selling cassettes of Wes­tern films, are one of the few booming businesses in Tehran. In a north Tehran apartment one night, a reporter found two teen-age boys and two girls huddled around a videocassette recorder watch­ing "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." Not only would the mullahs have frowned on the film, but the gathering itselfwas illicit -put­ting boys and veil-less girls together is an offense punishable by a dozen or more lashes ordered by rehgious courts. -AP 
Chrysler Corporation reopened talks with the United Auto Workers union in Highland Park, Mich. yesterday on 
U.S. and Canadian contracts. A union leader called the atmosphere "conciliatory," but Chrysler said it still cannot afford an immediate pay raise. About 10,000 Canadian workers are on strike against Chrysler, and 43,200 U.S. employees rejected the company's last offer. At a news conference after the first main-table session, UAW official Marc Stepp said he "didn't see the hostility or resoluteness" that characterized earlier talks which resulted in an agreement rejected by U.S. workers. "There seems to be a conciliatory atmos­phere," Stepp, UAW vice president in charge ofthe Chrysler depart­ment. -AP 
Republican Gov. James Thompson was declared winner ofthe closest Illinois governor's race in history yes­terday, three weeks after the election, and Democratic challenger Adlai Stevenson sought a recount. "It's over as far as I'm concerned," Thompson said. The certified tally gave Thompson 1,816,101 votes and Stevenson 1,811,027, a margin of 5,074 votes or just 0.139 per­cent. Thompson signed a certificate that declared him re-elected to an unprecedented third straight term. An hour later, Stevenson, a former U.S. senator, made his expected announcement that he would take the first steps toward a recount, which in Illinois is com­plex and costly. An additional46,418 votes were cast for third-party candidates, so that Thompson won with 49.43 percent ofthe ballots cast. -AP

It's not just turkey 
What does Thanksgiving mean to you? Besides being a good title for an early-morning sermonette, it is a question few people ponder. If the legend of the day is true, then at one time Thanksgiving was more than a commercial and overindulgence opportunity. 
Actually, some historians contend that the pilgrims, in their food engorged glee at surviving one year in America, may have eaten way too much. And as a result, they ended up nearly starving during the ensuing win­ter. Another version has the "friendly" Indians provid­ing tainted and spoiled food, in hopes that the pilgrims would take the hint and go south -to someplace like Newjersey. 
Whatever the truth may be, thanks to Mssrs. Hallmark and American Greetings, we now have a cheery image of Thanksgiving. Lots of corpulent, rosey-cheeked pilgrims frolicking about in a most un-puritan manner. In the backround are the dancing pumpkins, and the cavorting corn. Of course what festive table would be complete with the fold-out crepe paper turkey, with the incongruous smile? . 
Back in the 1950's, the decade currently in vogue as being "the good old days, "Thanksgiving had more meaning -at least in a seasonal sense. The pro-football season was almost over, as

ofease and the little amount of thought that goes with our daily meal deserves thanks. 
The pilgrims were also thankful for merely having survived another year. While conditions are not as rough now, except perhaps after a long weekend of parties, we can thank a number of benefactors. First of all, there are our parents who make this this four (or five) year festival known as college possible. If we weren't here busy learning, we might be out in the real world employeed -or victims of supply side economics. 
Just as the pilgrims thanked the Indians -at least in the happy version ofThanksgiving-so we, too, need to remember how vital our friends are to ns. Imagine a day without your friends. There would be no one to com­
plain to regarding dinner's 

opposed to just starting. Pop could don his hat, and the family could troop downtown to see the begin­ning of the Christmas shop­ping season. Nowadays, the downtown has been tom down, and the local mall is having a spring clearance sale. 
What's lacking from all this is a recognition of the true purpose ofthe day. For too many people, Thanksgiving means eating way too much and hoping someone else does the 
dishes. For college students, it is a chance to find some way home for a couple of days of "real food" and sleep. For unfortunate others stuck on-campus, it is a chance to blow off before the Christmas finals rush. 
These are certainly enjoyable ways to spend a holiday, but they don't do justice to the original intent of Thanksgiving. A jolly turkey just doesn't say it. The real turkeys are dead, and for good reason. The fowl birds symbolize the bounty the pilgrims were thankful for. 
Unless you are a rabid WASP, Thanksgiving is not meant to celebrate the survival of the original pilgrims. Rather, we are supposed to follow their example and be thankful for what we now have. And never has this been an e<~Sier task. 
That poor symbolic turkey is good example. With over a third of the world's population going to sleep hungry each night, our conditions stand in stark con­trast. Not only can a person march into his or her local supermarket and select from a variety of turkeys, be they basted or buttered, but that person can select from thousands ofother products as well. The great amount

whom to welch money. Think about how you "get by with a little help from your friends," and you'll realize the vital role they play in preserving your sanity. 
For too many Americans in their early 20's, Thanksgiving was spent eating foul meat matter on a battlefield. As ofthis writing, 
we're not involved in any 
war, something to be thank­
ful for on this, and every, day. 
People who have their health should not only be thankful for it but try to preserve it. Being healthy is one of life's joys that is not appreciateduntil it is gone ­sometimes for good A visit to any hospital or rest home quickly puts this into perspective. 
While we're busy being thankful, we should give credit to our respective schools. If for no other reason than the cheerful men who plow the snow, or the prof who closes his or her lines and accepts that major project a few days late. Besides, for all the complaing we do, we owe our schools something. And giving thanks now is cheaper than giving thanks as alumni. 
So as you sit down wherever on Thursday, as you sniff the aroma of yams, take advantage of a chance to be optimistic. Let your pessimism lie dormant out in the cold, and pause for a moment to put your own life in perspective. Despite whatever worries you have right now, chances are things aren't as bad as you think. While you gnaw on your turkey, remember, there is a whole world that could be so lucky.

New roles of journalists and their new responsibilities in dealing with ethical issues were the main topics discussed by Georgie Anne Geyer, columnist for the United Press Syndicate, in her talk, "Journalists, the New Targets, the New Diplomats, the New Inter­mediary People", yesterday afternoon. 
Geyer was the first speaker in the second session ofthe "Responsibilities ofJournalism" conference which began yesterday and con­tinues today. This session focused on the relationship between the news media and the government. 
According to Geyer, the Vietnam War 
marked the beginning of an entirely new 
world of journalism. Geyer stated that, during 
this period, "Journalists became diplomats, 
participants -not just observers. They went 
from being simple conveyors of messages to 
arbitrators of truth." 
Geyer stated that two new types of jour­
nalism emerged from thi~ period. Advocacy journalism deals with the belief that a jour­nalist actually can advocate his beliefs within a story. Adversary journalism, on the other hand, promotes the attitude that anyone in­volved in an institution ofsociety is an enemy. 
Geyer said that because of these new at­titudes, "We (the journalists) were becoming self-righteous." She cited adversary jour­nalism as a problem, saying that, "We (the press) cannot remove ourselves from society." 
Geyer also observed that journalists are becoming the targets of blame in many world conflicts. She cited her experiences in Beirut in 1977, where Lebanese officials felt that the presence ofAmerican journalists served to an­tagonize the conflict. While at one time American journalists were considered passive observers of international crises, they are no longer welcome and arc often harassed, she said. Geyer said that this situation caused those who never had been involved directly in the fighting -including journalists, clergy,

The romantic image of the reporter expos­ing political dishonesty is not realistic, said Robert McCloskey ofThe Washington Post in his address, "The Executive Branch and the Fourth Branch." 
"The stereotype notion that the govern­ment functions to hide secrets and the press to dig them out and report them is not the real world." McCloskey said. 
Me Closkey, who now works as om­budsman for the Post, has served as a foreign ambassador and secretary of press relations for the state department. He spoke of the relationship between the government and the press as a "fox hunt" with "the unspeakable pursuing the uneatable." 
There is a tendency in government, he said, to believe that the only right story is one that furthers the state's ends. "The government is intimidated by the press," he said. "Its basest inclination is to wish that the press would go away and leave the gcnuises at work." 
He remarked, however, that the press often sees government officials as "easy targets in destroy missions." He observed that the press does not see the consequences the politician's family must face as he is "torn apart" by the media. "The press institutionally has to do more telling it as it is," he said. 
Addressing the problem of dishonesty in government and press McCloskey remarked that "neither of these have a corner on honesty." McCloskey compared the two fields ofjournalism and government. "It isn't a totally different atmosphere," he said, refer­ring to journalists who have entered politics as "poachers turned game wardens." McClos­key found that these ex-reporters tend to be more bureaucratic and overprotective of in­formation than the average government offi­cial. 
There will always be controversy surrounding the press in McCiosi\:ey's opinion. "As soon as you write something about a topic, there is going to be a ·eader out there that knows more about it than the writer and you're going to be critici1ed." 

Economic reporting 
Silk discusses coverage problems 
By KATHLEEN DOYLE 
SeniorStaffReporter 
Separation of the business, news, and editorial functions of the media may be one solution to contem­poraf)' problems of the American press, according to Leonard Silk, economic columnist for The New York Times. 
In his lecture, entitled, "The Et­hics and Economics ofJournalism," Silk said that the American press is experiencing an internal tension caused by the conflicting interests of business and public service. 
"In our country, journalism is a business," Silk said. "There is a little non-profit journalism, such as that done by the Smithsonian Institute and Harvard, but most journalism is profit-making." 
"But at the same time journalism is more than a business," Silk added. "The business of the press is not just making monev, but taking a public role." 
This second function of American journalism, thoug t · demanded by the public, is sometir .:s denied by the critics, according to Silk. 
"Newspapers do not always live up to the standard," Silk said. "The Pentagon Papers and Watergate are perfect examples of the purpose of the press. They were not performed perfectly, but I feel that, on the whole, they were heroic vindica­tions of the press." 
Silk also said that some advertisers think they can hurt The New York Times by removing their advertise­ments. Such actions may hinder the paper slightly, but usually are not 
"Institutions like newspapers, which are vested with the public in­terest, should not have to peddle their wares lest they have to pander to their public." Silk continued. 
He also said that publishers should promote a sense of profes­sionalism among those who work for the media: "It is up to the leader­ship, such as the American

Other problems of the press cited by Silk include the number of one­paper towns and the attitude of careerism -when reporters are more concerned with making a name for themselves than in good journalism common among young news reporters.

Congress to decide 

Reagan to deploy MX n1issiles 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Wielding both stick and carrot, President Reagan announced yesterday he in­tends to deploy the huge MX missile in a "dense-pack" stringofWyoming silos, then prepared to offer new arms control proposals to the Soviet Union. 
"We would prefer that the Soviets dismantle SS-18's (their intercon­tinental ballistic missiles) rather than we build more holes," Reagan said in a written statement. "But we can accommodate either and main­tain stability." 
To emphasize his long-range goal, Reagan formally named the MX the "Peacekeeper" missile and called his basing plan "a reasonable way to deter attack." 
The long-awaited MX basing proposal, which faces a doubtful future in Congress, would have the United States deploy its first new in­tercontinental missiles in 20 years. 
However, in a nationally televised speech later yesterday, Reagan was to inform the Kremlin leadership that America would prefer reduc­tion of nuclear arsenals to participa­tion in a dangerous and expensive arms race. 
Hours before the formal an­nouncement, all signs indicated the president had accepted the Air Force recommendation to place I 00 MX weapons in superhardened launch silos spaced about I ,800 to 2,000 feet apart near Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming. 
The close-spacing concept, which the Air Force calls "dense pack," represents a dramatic departure from past missile deployment plans, including the Carter administra­tion's scheme for the MX. 
That plan called for spreading 200 MX missiles among some 4,600 con­crete shelters stretching across the Utah and Nevada deserts and shifting real missiles and decoys from site to site. 

The untested theory behind the dense-pack plan is that most of the MX missiles could survive a Soviet surprise attack because incoming Soviet warheads would disable each other as they converged on the MX silos and exploded. 
Reagan said cost was a factor in his decision. "We concluded that by pulling the launch sites closer to­gether and making them a great deal harder, we could make significant savings," from the plan originally envisioned by then-President Car­ter. 
Reagan said his proposed deploy­ment "would require the Soviets to make costly new technical develop­ments if they wish to even con­template a surprise attack. Most of the Soviet's proposed counter­measures are really no more than technical dreams on: which no Soviet planner or politician would bet the fate of his country."

First step in deployment 
'Densepack, missile basesproposed 
WASHINGTON (AP)-President Reagan's proposal for putting the new MX missile in a "dense pack" base is based on a theory that the nuclear weapons would be best protected by placing them so close together that attacking Soviet missiles would disable each other before they could knock out all the MX's.

The Notre Dame student body's involvement in the Indiana Student Higher Education Association was one of the topics discussed at last night's Student Senate meeting. 
The senators voted to join the as­sociation, a lobby-type group which provides the student's point-of-view to politicians. According to Senator Andy Tucker, it is the only group of its kind in Indiana. 
Notre Dame will be entitled to send one delegate to the meetings of the organization, which is located on the Indiana University campus in Bloomington. 
The top priority of the group will be to increase the amount of governmental financial aid offered to students. 
Also discussed was the recent campus-wide concern over alcohol abuse which has prompted proposals by University ad­ministrators for the elimination of hall happy hours. No concrete in­formation could be provided on the issue, though it was pointed out that no party room is to be in use before 7 o'clock on any evening. A decision concerning the matter is expected to be issued by a member ofthe Uni­versity administration in the near future. 
Chris Tayback updated his com­mittee's progress on securing cable television availability for student dorms. Tayback is presently in the process of compiling a list of proposals supporting cable televi­sion on campus. 
Also discussed during the session was the proposal of improving the existing game room in the basement of LaFortune. Working together on the idea are Tim Farrell and John Kelly, both ofwhom envision the in­stallation of video games in place of some of the pool tables there presently. 
Cheryl Simoneau is working on an idea to open membership in the Uni­versity Club to seniors. Cost of the membership and various application processes are two of the points being discussed on the issue. 

A reminder was made that Senior 
Bar is currently open to under­
graduates on Sunday nights. Due to 
the low student turn-out on Sun­
days, the time will be changed to 
Monday evenings beginning in 
December. 

Mike McAuliffe reported on issues discussed in the most recent HPC meeting. Dean of Student Affairs James Roemer raised the possibility ofissuing a directive banning the use of grain alcohol and the elimination of drinking games in future hall events. 
The HPC decided to ban grain al­cohol in hall party rooms. A verbal notification as to the hazards of drinking games will also be sent to each dorm by the HPC. As a result of the actions taken by the HPC, a campus-wide directive will not be issued by Roemer. 
Before the session was adjourned, it was decided that the next Student Senate meeting will be held in LaFortune. All students are welcome to attend meetings.

Research Update 
Ashland Oil Inc. has withdrawn it~ sponsorship of a multi-billion dollar project to produce synthetic oil from coal, the company said yesterday. The company, making the announcement from its Ashland. Ky., headquarter:-, cited several reasons for scrap­ping the project. including "the uncertainty of future crude oil prices," the huge cost of the project and possible cost overruns. The Breckinridge project was a planned commercial-scale plant to be located in Breckinridge County, Ky. Although Ashland had researched and tested the technical processes to be used at Breckin­ridge since 1971, the Breckinridge plant had not gone beyond the design stage, according lO Dan Lacy, an Ashland spokesman. In Washington, D.C., the federal Synthetic Fuels Corp. issued a state­ment saying it "regrets but understands" the Ashland decision to pull out ofthe project. In the most widely publicized case, Exxon Corp. withdrew last May from the Colony project, a S5 billion plan to con­struct a commercial plant for extracting synthetic oil from shale in the hills of western Colorado. A S2.7 billion project in Wyoming to produce gas from coal, called WyCoal Gas., also was cancelled this year. Among the major projects postponed this year was the Oc­cidental Petroleurr. Corp. and Tenneco Inc. plan to produce shale oil at Cathedral Bluffs, Colo. -AP

Woolworth emblazoned in gold on a red back­ground. It was a design copied from another early chainstore operation: A&P.

Satellite uplink atND 
By MARY ANN MCMORROW 
News Staff 
Today the ACC, the football stadium, and the Center for Continu­ing Education are being linked to the WNDU studio in order to improve communications and to transmit conferences on campus nationally. 
Only two or three other univer­sities in the country have the kind of satellite uplink that is being used here, according to WNDU promo­tion manager, Gregory Giczi. Use of tiber optic cables is expected to in­crease as their cost falls and becomes closer to that of leased telephone lines. 
Each of four links is made up of a continuous cable, about half an inch in diameter, containing six fibers about the thickness ofa human hair. 
Conventional coaxial cahle would 
be a few inches in diameter. The ad­
vantages of fiber cable include im­
proved video and audio quality, 
almost no noise interference, easier 
installation and the ability to receive 
and transmit information to 
satellites. 
This link-up has been in the plan­ning stage for over a year and con­struction began in mid-summer. 
Although the fiber optic cable i:­more advanced than the rest of thl· equipment, it will let WNDL adapt betrt.-r as new production h:1rdwarc hec ·mes available.

On the other hand, Brough pointed out, "The inheritors of his millions behaved as though they preferred to forget how it had all been made in nickels and dimes." 
The most forgetful of all was, of course, Frank Woolworth's granddaughter, Barbara Babs Hut­ton, who inherited a third of his fortune and spent it more easily than most people buying trinkets at Woolworth's. In 1926, when she was 14 years old, she had her own 26-room duplex on Fifth Avenue (her mother had died and her tather, Franklyn Hutton, brother of stock­broker E.F. Hutton, had remarried). She once tipped a bellboy at the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco $10,000. She married seven times, never to an American-born man, fre­quently ending the marriage with a 
S2  million settlement  on  her  ex­ 
husband.  
In  1979,  when  the  Woolworth  

tlve-and-ten was celebrating it~ I OOth anniversary. Barbara Hutton died of a heart attack -friendless and with no ~urviving relatives. Her son, Lance Reventlow, died in a plane cra~h in 1972. She spent the last the year~ of her lite holed up in the Beverly Wibhire Hotel in Los Angeles. where she lined the win­dow~ of her suite with foil to keep out the sunlight. She was the last of the Woolworths. 
Meanwhile. the F.W. Woolworth Company, as it's still called. was fighting its own battle for survival. It began to lose its footing in the 1960's when longt t ime rival. S.S. Kresge. transformed itsdf into the nation's largest discounter under a new name. K-Mart. Woolworth followed feebly with the Woolco chain but never seemed to have its heart in it. 
In 197S, Woolworth's got a new boss, Edward Gibbons, who was im­ported from another company. The first person to head the company who did not come up from the ranks, he boldly announced: ''Gibbons is here to save old Frank Woolworth's empire, not to liquidate it." 
Last month Gibbons announced he was giving up on Woolco. All 336 stores, accounting for S2.1 billion of Woolworth's S7.1 billion of sale~. will be closed by next February. At the same time, Gibbons moved to sell the 52 percent interest the com­pany has in its British subsidiary, which operates more than 1,000 
F.W. Woolworth stores. So here's what's still left of old Frank Wool­worth's empire: 
--1.5-tO Woolworth stores in the u.S., 190 in Canada and 200 in Ger­many.

anury ast project: assessing implications 

This is the second ofa two-part serie:. on the responsibilities and implications of the A. Murty Kanury atomic test blast project. The project, funded by the Department of Defense, endeavors to answer the question, "is the test blast ofa scale-model city built in a Western desert the most effective means of studying how a nuclearexplosion..would af­fect a modern city?" 


Paul McGinn 

Roper Review 
The implications of the Kanury project demand as much concern as the responsibility for a possible nuclear war. The precedent set by the University's approval of Kanury's project opens the floodgates to any number of other similar Defense Department projects. 
It does not seem sensational to think that if the Kanury project is morbidly successful, the Defense Department will gaze appreciatively upon Notre Dame's research capabilities. And this would undoubtedly lead to more defense­related contracts. 
Another implication ofthe project is the ap­
parent shift in culpability for any such project. Throughout the affair, the University has refused to comment to the national press, especially to the leading investigator of the experiment, The National Catholic Reporter. 
Since the first interview with Kanury in August, The Reporter has been met with silence. Kanury says he was misquoted and his words were taken out of context. The com­munication gap between the University and the press has contributed to Kanury's ap­pearance as the malefactor in the matter. 
This separation of the scientist from the community he represents is another dan­gerous precedent: the University is apparently disclaiming responsibility for research done on its campus. 
But the most obvious implication of the presence ofthe project on campus is that the University abides by no ultimate standards ofa community-held philosophy. Though this fact is by no means a precedent in itself, it relates a staggering fact about University policy. 
Notre Dame has willingly accepted con­tributions from arms manufacturers, most notably the Bendix Corporation, and the Chrysler Corporation. But Notre Dame silences objections to the acceptance ofthese donations: although these corporations do manufacture weapons or weapons systems, their primary concern is civilian projects. These corporations produce machines ofwar only when the need arises. 

But one need not search fur to discover that the military contracts of such corporations are on-going affairs, not limited by the nebulous notion of "need." No one can deny the present production of Bendix's missile guidance systems or Chrysler's X-1 tank. 
The presence of the Kanury project only enhances the University's inconsistency, as manifested in its stance on nuclear weapons. While Hesburgh signs The Declaration on Prevention ofNuclear War, S266,000 worth of military projects takes place in his own backyard. 
In the face of such a contradiction, it is no wonder that so many take the declaration lightly. This document of high ideals rings a hollow note in face ofsuch a discrepancy. The apparent contradiction between the values manifested in the document and the values manifested in the explicit approval of the Kanury and other military projects has made Notre Dame the laughing stock ofacademia. 
It is no wonder that so many smirk at Hes­
burgh's glowing tribute to Jonath·m Schell's The Fate ofthe Earth. Hesburgh can only offer empty praise for this work, as he can claim no empathetic virtue. 
Notre Dame, the great bastion ofAmerican Catholicism, cannot even decide whether it should first be American or Catholic. The 2ge­old priority listing ofGod, Country, and Notre Dame is becoming blurred, and the priorities are being interchanged to meet the fickle demands ofthe Defense Department. 
The Declaration on the Prevention of Nuclear War and similar documents are in­tended specifically to influence world politi­cal leaders. But how can these leaders take such pleas seriously in light ofsuch hypocriti­cal policies? 
Notre Dame policy is like a blade ofgrass ­when the wind .blows, it goes with it. But Notre Dame stands for more than simple intel­lectual inquiry and academic honesty. 
Notre Dame should stand as a witness to the living Church Church; Notre Dame cannot shake its moral responsibility to the pacifist traditions and teachings ofthe Church. But foF the present, Notre Dame, to paraphrase Theodore Roosevelt, "has the backbone of a chocolate eclair." 

Humanae Vitae-eminently realistic 
On November 1 S, The Observer published an anonymous letter in response to an earlier letter by Dr. Janet Smith. The author treats a delicate issue in an admirably sensitive way, but, unfortunately, the treatment is flawed by errors. factual and otherwise. ln particular, the fundamental questions surrounding artifi­cial contraception have been inaccurately identified and the position of the Church, to

In the first instance, the question of whether individual married couples have the right to decide. for appropriate reasons, to limit the number of their children is not at issue. Indeed. the Church commends respon­sible decisions about family size. While inap­propriate reasons do exist for wanting to limit family size, the fundamental questions con­cern the means which may he legitimately employed to achieve that goal. Given this as the question. what should the role of the Church be' 
The answer here is important since the Church will he judged, in part, on how well 
she fulfills the role we define. unfortunately, it seems that a great many people assign a sort of arbitrary legislative function to the Church. lt is almost as if certain activities in some times and places, and perhaps not in others. While this is an appropriate model for our Congress, it is far too legalistic tor the Church, at least with respect to general principles governing human action. 
What we ought to expect, and here we have the Church's own self-detlnitiO!J to guide us, is that the Church will assume the responsibility of telling us what kinds of actions, in the con­crete, we ought to engage in (or not engage in) in order to accomplish the goal of "ultimate and eternal joining with god." Some kinds ofactions facilitate this. while other~ im­pede it. To say that the Church has the respon­sibility to identify human actions a_~ belonging to one class or the other is not to say that, by her mere declaration, the action becomes morally good or bad. 
Even a cursory reading ofHumanae Vitae should reveal that Paul VI did'. not see himself as making a legislative decision. but rather a judicial one. As the appointed spokesman for the Universal Church. exercising his prop­hetic office, he declared that. according to the natural law, "each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life." 
Put negatively, this is to say that any act of intercourse within marriage which is purposely rendered infertile, is that kind ofact

which lessens human dignity and impedes the supernatural goal oflife. 
We have a tendency to see decisions like this as judgements which have the effect of denying something to us which would other­wise enhance our lives. We also tend to see them according to a legislative model, which implies that the Church has the authority to reverse the decision. if only theology would catch up with modern realities. But such views arc false, regardless of how enthusiasti­cally they might be encouraged by well­intentioned theologians and priests. 
Equally false is the view that the doctrine of Humanae Vitae is an ideal rather than a norm applicable to all married couples in the Church. This was recently reinforced by Familiaris Consortia (paragraph 34). 
On the other hand, it is true that each couple must decide for themselves which course of action they wi!l choose. But this decision must come to grips with the teaching of the Church as it really is, not as it is merely purported to be. No responsible decision can be made without a careful scrutiny of the documents and a respectful and obedient con­sideration ofthe reasons and explanations put forward. 
It might be appropriate to know, for ex­ample, that the Church does indeed distin­guish between barrier. abortifacient and 
anovulant methods of contraception, con­trary to the impression created by the author

ln the last analysis, any decision about the use of artificial contraceptives remains a per­sonal decision, as do all moral decisions. This is the fearful cost of our human freedom, and while it would be easier to defer to a "church" which would make those decisions for us, that is emphatically not the character of our Church, regardless of the view so often presented. Those of us who choose to accept the teaching of the Church on the matter of artificial contraception are no less thoughtful than those who do not. 
We do not see ourselve~ as accepting a bur­den but rather as remaining open to a genuine human fulfillment, and we prefer this open­ness to the arbitrary closing offof t.uman pos­sibilities which results from the alternati\·e.

The Hunt Is On! 
Students go in debt to pay college 
By KATHLEEN DOYLE 
SeniorStaffReporter 
The federal government has tightened the screws on the Guaranteed Student Loan program sin{:e President Reagan took office two years ago, and according to the Notre Dame Financial Aid office, more changes are still possible for the 1983-84 academic year. 
"Perhaps the most likely change is an across-the-board 'simple needs test' require­ment," said Financial Aid CounselorJane Kelly who coordinates the Notre Dame GSL program. "Such a regulation would require all students, regardless offamily income, to demonstrate a need for a loan." 
Other proposed changes are the elimina­tion ofgraduate, law, and professional stu­dents from the program and a doubling ofthe surcharge. This surcharge was set at five per­cent last October. Reagan's proposals would raise it to ten percent. 
This means that a student now receiving a loan of S2,500 and having SI 25 subtracted from it for processing fees, will have S12 5 more subtracted from it ifthe proposals are accepted. 
The GSL program is the biggest source of federal assistance at Notre Dame. Ofthe SI6 million offederal funds utilized by Notre Dame, approximately S 13 million is used in the GSL program. Last year, 4,7 4 7 students borrowed S 12,563,206. As ofmid-September, 3,087 students had borrowed 58,231,832 for the 1982-83 academic year. 
Nearly 95 percent ofthe Notre Dame stu­dents receiving Guaranteed Student Loans during the 1981-82 academic year had their loans processed prior to the implementation ofthe 1981 Postsecondary Student Assistance Amendments. 
These amendments were contained in the 
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. 
With their enactment, family income has 
become a factor in determining GSL 
eligibility. Those families with an adjusted 
gross income more than $30,000 and less than 
S75,000 are currently required to prove their 
need using either the simple needs test or the 
Financial Aid Form. 
Families with an adjusted gross income of 
S75,000 or more must use the FAF. 
The Omnibus Reconciliation Act changed the Middle Income Bill of 1978 which had removed the income ceiling on the program. 
"The Guaranteed Student Loan program was getting too expensive for the govern­ment," Kelly said. "More families were par­ticipating under the Middle Income Bill and the economy was so bad that the government found it necessary to put tighter restrictions on the program. Now loan eligibility is calc­ulated by subtracting from the school budget the estimated family contribution and the amount offinancial aid the student receives from other sources." 

"There is abuse of the loan program," Kelly added, "but that is not the primary reason for the present push for further restrictions. Abuses do exist, but it is rarely mentioned that 94 percent of those students who borrow money, repay it. The national default rate is only six percent. 
"The influence ofabuse stories on con­gressmen is probably one ofthe reasons for the restrictions, but the greater force leading to reform is the great cost ofthe program," Kelly said. 
The cost, Kelly said, has increased for two main reasons. The first is that more people need and are borrowing loans. The second reason is that due to the nation's poor economy and high interest rates, the special allowance the government must pay on the loans has greatly increased. 
The special allowance is the additional in­terest on a student loan which the govern­ment pays to the lender, both while the student is in school and while the student is repaying the loan, so that the total interest being paid on the loan is comparable to the current prime interest rate. The special al­lowance is interest in addition to both the seven or nine percent interest paid by the government while the student is in school and the interest paid by the student after gradua­tion. 
"The assigned seven or nine percent inter­est rate on astudent's loan is fixed," Kelly said. "The special allowance is required to make up the difference between the assigned rate and the current prime interest rate. Thus higher prime interest rates increase the govern­ment's special allowance costs." 
Aprogram similar to the GSL program is the 
relatively new Parent Loan for Undergraduate 
Students program. Recent legislation makes 
this program available to independent under­
graduates and graduates in addition to parents 
ofdependent undergraduates. 

Interest rates on PLUS loans are based on Treasury bills. If the prime interest rate drops and remains down for a year, then the PLUS rates will drop. Last October, the interest rate was 14 percent, but during the last year the average rate dropped to 12 percent. The new interest rate of 12 percent on PLUS loans became effective Nov. I. 
1,288 students who participated. Students may receive up to a 53,000 but are limited to S6,000 during their four years. The average loan in 1981-82 was 5973. 
The federal Office ofEducation awards NDSL funds to colleges each year to be dis­tributed to students in their financial aid package aid package. The Financial Aid office must apply annually for the funds. 
Russo said Notre Dame, "just like all other instituitions, receives far less from the govern­ment annually than needed by its students." 
Students who sign up for loans must begin repayment six months after completing school. The period had formerly been nine months. Interest rates have increased one per­centeach ofthe past two years to five percent. Students may take up to I 0 years to repay the loan, with minimum quarterly payments of 
545. 
The rate ofdefault on NDSL's by Notre Dame students is 8.4 percent. The national rate is between 15 and 20 percent. 
 A limited number ofstudents also receive Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants as part oftheir financial aid packages. Notre Dame is responsible for selecting recipients ofthis federal grant. Students who receive the grant, which may be as large as S2,000, have exceptional financial need. It is targeted for those students who otherwise would be unable to afford Notre Dame. 
Foreach award, the student'sfinancial need is carefully evaluated. The average SEOG for 1981-82 at Notre Dame was 5727 for the 629 students receiving one. The amount ofmoney the federal government allocates to each school determines the amount and number of these grants. 
"As in the NDSL program, the University receives far less from the government than is needed," Russo said . 


Computer aiding 

Companies offer to say where the money is 
By CATHY PAX 
StaffReporter 
You missed out on a scholarship last year. 
The reason you are still reading is why scholarship searchcompanies have continued to spring up across nation despite heavy criticism from consumer advocate groups. 
Awards and scholarships amounting in the millions ofdollars go unclaimed every year, these companies say, but computer data banks can inform students ofscholarships sources they may have overlooked. 
Twenty thousand students each year employ Scholarhip·Search, the oldest of these companies, to aid them in their search for financial a:d. Scholarship Search guarantees the student a referral list offinancial aid sources for which he is eligible. 
Much confusion and controversy has developed because the company cannot guarantee a scholarship per se, but can only advise the student where to look. 
Mary Ann Maxin, director ofScholarship Search, said, "We cannot guarantee that a stu­dent will receive a scholarship but we can in­crease his chances. We will save him time as we lead the student to paths where he will be most successful. Using our service, a student won't be caught barking up the wrong tree." 

Scholarship Search will refund the 545 processing fee if the student does not meet the requirements ofany ofthe scholarships listed. The company says that 40 percent of the students who use its service receive funds through the direct pursual of the sources listed. The average scholarship listed in its data bank is approximately $1,000. No scholarship under $250 is listed. 
"We list some scholarships for four years of full tuition, room and board, and books, but these are few and far between," Maxin said. 
A similar venture, Scholarship Bank, aids 10,000 to 15,000 students a year. This com· pany offers two packages -a minimum of 20 sources for 535 or a minimum of 50 sources for 545. The company reports that there has never been a problem finding scholarships. Close to 300 sources were once provided for a single student. The company contends to have once found 36 scholarshipsfor a student planning a major in deep-sea diving. 
None ofthis amuses financial aid directors 
at colleges across the country. Notre Dame 
By PAT MALLEY 
News Staff 
Three other federal programs besides the Guaranteed Student Loan and Work/Study provide students with financial assistance. 
The National Direct Student Loan Program, the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program, and the Pel! Grant Program supplied more than 52.5 million dollars for Notre Dame students last year. 
 The Pell Grant, formerly the Basic Grant, is a grant for undergraduate students with United States citizenship and enrolled in school at least on a halftime basis. The grant is adminis­tered and funded by the U.S. Office ofEduca­tion. According to ND Financial Aid Director Joseph Russo, Notre Dame is simply an "agent in the process." 
Unlike most sources offederal aid, funds for Pell grants this year actually increased despite President Ronald Reagan's veto ofthe first al­location, which he deemed too large. Congress, however, voted to override him and acrually increased funding. Russo said there may be a S20 to S126 hike in the size of the awards, increasing the maximun award from SI,674 to Sl,800. 
Astudent who has completed a proper ap­plication -the Financial Aid Form is just one ofseveral possible forms -is assigned an eligibility index number. Notre Dame translates this number into a predetermined amount ofthe grant and credits the student's account for that amount. 
The federal government is then billed for all the Pell money awarded -S861 ,972 for the 1981-82 academic year. 
 The National Direct Student Loan Program represents the largest form ofcampus-based federal aid administered by Notre Dame totalling more than S 1.2 million dollars for the 
Financial Aid Joe Russo ran his own test to determine the credibility ofthese companies. He created a name, mailed a dollar and re­quested the application for computer assis­tance. 
The company requested information about residence, background, race, religion, schools being considered, and income. 
When Russo did not return the application with the S39 processing fee, the company wrote to offer him the same package for only Sl9. Russo said, "I think 60 Minutes would· have a field day with these companies." Russo has recommended that the National Associa­

tion ofStudent Financial Aid Administrators 
investigate that particular company. 
"Most of these companies are trying to 
make some money at the expense ofvery vul­
nerable students and families," he said. 
"l don't have much credence in most of 
these companies," Russo said, adding that a 
student could find the most productive 
sources with a little effort through the Finan­
cial Aid office and library at no cost. 
He said that the obscure scholarships that 
the companies advertise as going unused are 
so restrictive that very few students qualify. 
"Typically, these are not going to result in any­thing for the normai'Joe College' kid." 
Scholarship Search disagrees with this state­ment as it promises to list more than 250,000 sources. Maxin said that "information is provided at the student's fingertips with our service." She said ideally guidance counselors should use Scholarship Search to help direct students. "We should be used as a research tool. Unfortunately, guidance counselors see us as a replacement for their jobs." 
The Scholarship Bank company advertises through posters placed in financial aid offices. One third of the company's applicants are referrals from these offices. Scholarship Search advertises only through the mail. Names ofgraduating high school seniors are purchased from mailing houses. Its brochure lists the name ofstudents who have won scholarships with the help ofScholarship Search. 
The company once listed a Notre Dame stu­dent as their leading testimonial. He had reportedly won five valuable scholarships with the company's aid. Russo contends two ofthe scholarships were awarded by Notre Dame and the student would have been automatically considered for both ofthem through the normal financial aid process. An­other scholarship listed was a California state scholarship that the student never received because he attended an Indiana school. The company was still using this testimonial six years after the scholarships were awarded.

All work and some pay 
Work/Study helps students pay that b1g bill 
By SARAH HAMILTON 
News Staff 
"A job is financial aid." 

So says Notre Dame's Employment Coor­dinator Sharon Veith who views campus student employment as a key ingredient in Notre Dame's financial aid recipe. 
Students demonstrating financial need are given first preference for the limited number ofcampus jobs, according to a policy es­tablished several years ago by University offi­cials. 
Nearly halfof the campus jobs are supported by the federal Work/Study program. Not unlike other forms offinancial aid, Work/Study has fallen victim to the many recent cuts in the federal budget. For the 1982-83 school year, Notre Dame has been allocated 5735,000 in Work/Study funds. This is a substantial decrease from the Sl.2 million received in 1980-81, the University's peak year. Since federal funds have diminished, fewer students received Work/Study awards this year because ofstricter eligibility require­ments. 
Nevertheless, Veith said that even ifall 

federal money disappeared, Notre Dame 
would retain most ofits student jobs. 
Work/Study was implemented in 1965 as 

part of the Higher Education Act and is 
designed "to stimulate and promote the part­
time employment ofstudents who 
demonstrate financial need," Veith said. 
Although this act has been amended 

Endownment funds University programs 

ByJOHN HINES 
News Staff 
Uncle Sam's financial aid programs have 
taken a beating lately, but Notre Dame does 
have some endowed scholarship programs of 
its own which are independent offederal 
funds and federal red tape. 
Notre Dame awards two basic scholarships 
from its own monies. 

The first, and perhaps best known, is the Notre Dame Scholars program available to the 300 Notre Dame Scholars selected by the Ad­missions office from each year's applicant pool. 
Scholarships are awarded only if the ND Scholar demonstrates financial need through the normal financial aid process. Scholarships range from SSOO to S3,SOO (varies from year to year) depending on just how much need the student shows. 
The primary source offunding for the Notre Dall!e Scholar program is the annually earned interest from the University endowment. As of June 30, S27 million of the endowment

get the FAF to the College Scholarship Service on time, Saint Mary's recommends mailing the FAF before Feb. 15. 1983 to meet the March I, 1983 deadline. The Saint Mary's Financial Aid Application is due in the Financial Aid Office by March l. 

Additional forms arc required for the Guaranteed Student Loan program. Ifa stu­dent is applying only for the GSL, the Guaranteed Student Loan Application is sub­stituted for the Financial Aid Form. All ofthe applications for the GSL are dueJuly 1, 1983. 
After March I, the application process for federal financial aid is completed. Next, a stu­dent must wait to receive a Student Aid Report, and all three copies must be sent to the Financial Aid office before student eligi~l}~~an be determi_ned;.. __ ,_ . _ numerous times, the basic requirements for eligibility in the Work/Study program remain the same. 
 A student must first demonstrate financial need by filing the Financial Aid Form before March I each year. Need is assumed ifcollege costs are above a student's other financial aid and family contribution. 
Regardless of a student's financial status, Veith said it is necessary to file an FAF to "get into the system." 
 
The second requirement is that students must be in "good academic standing," exhibit­ing "satisfactory academic progress." Present­ly, the federal government is questioning whether or not these words have uniform meaning at all colleges. Various financial aid organizations, including the National Associa· tion ofFinancial Aid Administrators, are trying to standardize these terms. 

 
Ifa student meets these requirements and is awarded a job as a form offinancial aid, he or she must then complete an application specifically for Work/Study. Among other questions, the application asks for the stu­dent's class, intended major and any prior ex­perience in Work/Study. jobs in some departments require specific skills or ex· perience, which may be related to a student's field ofstudy. 


Students also may request certain jobs or jobs in certain departments although there is no guarantee that requests will be accepted. 
 Once the application is filed, a student must acquire an authorization slip from the Office 
generated·funds to support undergraduate scholarships. 
The second Notre Dame scholarship is the Holy Cross Scholarship for minority students who demonstrate financial need. Once again, this scholarship is awarded to incomingfresh­men and is subject to yearly re-evaluation. 
The money earned by the Notre Dame foot­ball team's 1970 and 1971 bowl appearances provide an endowment for the Holy Cross Scholarship. 
The most conspicuous scholarships (actually called grants-in-aid because they are not based on financial need) are athletic scholarship~. The athletic coaches, not the Financial Aid office, determine the recipients ofthese grants. Funds for these come directly from the earnings ofthe "producing" sports such as football and basketball and have no· thing whatsoever to do with the funds used for the Notre Dame Scholar program or the 
Holy Cross Scholarship Award. 
Notre Dame offers no fully paid scholar· 
ships except through the Athletic depart· 
ment. 
The first step in applying for any University 
financial aid, as well as what is available from 
the federal government, is filing a Financial 
Aid Form. The FAF correlates financial data 
from parents and students alike to determine a 
student's financial need. The suggested date 
for filing the FAF is at least two weeks before 
March 1 but afterJan. 1. 
The Financial Aid office analyzes a student's 
financial aid and awards both campus-based 
Problems arise when students apply late, said Casey. "We are encouraging applicants to get their applications in on time," she said. Other problems develop when letters sent to the students requiring immediate response are nor returned to the Financial Aid office. 
Financial aid awards are made on the basis of need as well as ac;;c!emic performan.ce. Since thes-: awards art:'made annuaily, it is necessary to reapply fpr aiJ each year. Eligibility isprimariiy deternineG fro.;n. family

Last year, 68 percent ofSaint_Mary's stu­dents received financial aid, according to statistics. Funds may bt: significanrly reduced for the 1983-1984 school ~;ear l'ecause of proposed ch;mges in the finlmcial aid program

ofStudent Employment. This form shows the amount ofearnings for which he or she is eligible and also lists a referral to a specific department for employment. 
Most student employees find work in the dining halls. Th~ libraries are a close second. Other places ofstudent employment are the laundry, book store and residence halls. With­in academic departments, students are hired as tutors and graders. 
There are far more students wanting campus employment than there are jobs. Con­sequently, the Office ofStudent Employment tries to avoid placing a student in more than one job. 
University policy mandates that no student work more than 20 hours a week. Most stu­dents average 12-13 hours. 
Most employed students earn a basic rate of S3.65 per hour. Some, however, earn as much as H.40 per hour, depending on the the job. 
For Work/Study jobs the federal govern­ment pays a portion of this salary leaving the University to make up the difference. 

Saint Mary's 
By VIC SCIULLI 
Assistant News Editor 
Federal budgest cuts are casting a dark shadow on next year's Work/Study program budget, and small colleges like Saint Mary's stand to suffer. 
Saint Mary's received S125,000 in Work/Study dollars this year,-80 percent com­ing from from federal funds with the other 20 percent coming from the College. 
1982 was the first year that Saint Mary's ex­perienced a decrease in Work/Study money, according to Financial Aid DirectorJudith Casey. Work/Study has been the last program 
federal funds and University money accord­ingly. After freshman year, any Notre Dame stu­dent with a grade point average higher than 
3.0 and demonstrating financial need may receive some financial assistance from Univer­sity monies, albeit very small. The Financial Aid office first reviews the record ofstudents who qualified for financial assistance in the previous year. Ifgrades become too low or if need no longer exists, the aid could be ad­justed.

hit by the budget cuts, C;~sey said, because Congress has long com·idered Work/Study an excellent application ofthe "work ethic." 
Approximately 175 Saint Mary's students are currently participating in the Work/Study program. Wages are S2.85 an hour, 50 Cl nts less than the current minimum wage. 
The amount of money available is the most important factor in determining who gets aid, Casey said. "We try to help as many people as possible," she said. 
Initial placements for Work/Study jobs are made in the spring with incoming freshmen being placed last. The Financial Aid office at­tempts to schedule work hours around classes but requires students to work through exam cycles. 
Casey said that she hopes to have a job board displayed soon which would list the job, salary and place ofemployment. 
Financial Aid officers reviews the files of prospective recipients. In order to qualify for a scholarship or any other form ofaid at Saint Mary's, a student must complete the Financial Aid Form by the March 1 deadline. 
The Saint Mary's Financial Aid Application form is also due by March 1. 
Consideration is based equally en demonstrated need as determined from the FAF and academic achievement requiring a minimum ofa 3.0 cumulative grade point average. Eligibility also includes enrollment as a full-time student. 
The amount oftotal scholarship funds varies each year with the change in donations to the College. This includes alumnae con­tributions which range from S25 to 52,000. 
A list of individual scholarships and grants can be obtained through the Office ofStudent Affairs or the Financial Aid office. 
While freshmen are bringing fewer money awards with them to Saint Mary's, alumnae donations are increasing, said Financial Aid DirectorJudith Casey. 
Some of these donors select their recipients, but most are decided by the Finan­cia! Aid oftke. 
A re-evaluation offinancial aid policies is currently underway. "During past years," Casey said, "financial aid was based largely on outstanding achievements, while today the trend is toward a balance ofneed and achieve­ment. Success in obtaining aid is based on the effort ofthe individual to look into the endiess possibilities," Casey said.

McGee second 
Sax takes NL rookie honors 
NEW YORK (AP) -Second baseman Steve Sax has been named the National League's Rookie of the Year in a close vote to become the fourth consecutive Los Angeles Dodger to win the award, the Baseball Writers Association of America announced yesterday. 
Sax, 22, landed nine first-place votes and a total of 63 points from a panel oftwo writers from each ofthe 12 National League cities. Johnny Ray, Pittsburgh Pirates second baseman, t1nished second with six first-place votes and 57 points. 
Outfielder Willie McGee, one of the St. Louis Cardinals' World Series heroes, finished third with five first· place votes and 39 points. 
The voting was taken at the con­clusion of the regular season. A first-place vote was worth five points, second place three points, and third place one. 
Sax drew four second-place votes and six for third and became the 11th Dodger to win the rookie prize since it was inaugurated in 1947. In 1947 and 1948 there was only one rookie award for both leagues. 
Ray attracted seven second-place votes and six for third. 
Sax, whose emergence allowed the Dodgers to trade veteran Davey Lopes to Oakland during the off­season, batted .282 in the leadoff position, drove in 47 runs and stole 49 bases in 150 games. 
Ray batted .281, knocked in 63 runs and stole 16 bases. He led the league's second basemen in putouts ( 381 ), assists (512 ), total chances (914), errors (21) and games ( 162). 
Both Sax and Ray had .977 fielding percentages. 
Sax, a native ofSacramento, Calif, was the Dodgers' No. 9 choice in the June 1978 free agent draft, spent 48 days on the Los Angeles roster in 1980, taking over at second base for the ailing Lopes. He batted .277 in 31 games. 
He also won the Texas League bat· ting title at San Antonio in 1980 with 
a.346 mark. 
The 5·11, 175-pounder says he has patterned himself after his idol, Pete Rose, who won the NL rookie award in 1963 when with Cincin­nati. 
"I've patterned myself after him," says Sax. "I'm a very aggressive player and try to give 100 percent all the time. I trv to force mistakes, make thing:. happen..." 
McGee batted 296 in 123 games for St. Louis. driving home 56 runs and stealing 24 bases. 

Idle Penn State moves into second in AP poll 
By HERSCHEL NISSENSON 
AssociatedPress 
Penn State moved into second place yesterday in The Associated Press college football poll, setting up a possible national championship meeting with top-rated Georgia in the Sugar BowL 
Although Penn State did not play over the weekend, the Nittany Lions climbed from third place to second when Southern Methodist, last week's runner-up, was held to a 1 7· 1 7 tie by Arkansas. 
Penn State winds up its regular season Friday against fifth-ranked Pitt, while Georgia, also idle last weekend, closes Saturday against Georgia Tech. The two teams will 
meet  in  the Sugar Bowl  on  New  
Year's Night.  
Georgia,  the  nation's  only  

unbeaten-untied major college team, was a near-unanimous choice for No.1 with 52 of 57 first-place votes and 1,133 of a possible 1,140 points. Penn State received two first· place ballots and 1,057 points. 
Nebraska, which meets Oklahoma on Friday for the Big Eight cham­pionship, rose from fourth to third with the other three first-place votes and 1,018 points. 
SMU is fourth with 969 points, followed by Pitt, up from sixth to fifth with 898 points. The Panthers swamped Rutgers 52-6 to earn a Cot­ton Bowl berth. 
Arizona State, idle until Saturday's clash with Arizona, vaulted from eighth to sixth with 817 points. LSU, a runaway 55-21 winner over Florida State in the Orange Bowl sweepstakes, jumped from 12th to seventh with 749 points. 
Rounding out the Top Ten are UCLA, Arkansas and Clemson, while Washington drorped from fifth to 13th after losing to Washington State 24-20 and Florida State fell from seventh to 15th.

career that somehow went sour 
By LOUIE SOMOGYI 
Sports Writer 
The scene was the Notre Dame locker room two years ago at Spartan Stadium after Notre Dame had rallied from a 9-0 deficit to defeat Michigan State, 26-21. 
Writers congregated around the cramped quarters of Notre Dame's stocky sophomore tailback, Phil Carter. Uttle doubt, they may have been thinking, that man was going to be one ofthe top contenders for the Heisman Trophy -if not the winner of it ­by his senior year. Heck, the way he's going he might be the first sophomore ever to earn the prize. 
After opening the 1980 season with a slashing, smashing 142­yar t d effort against a strong Purdue team on national television, Carter next rocked the the Michigan Wolverines for 103 yards and two crucial touchdowns in the memorable 29-27 triumph. 
Now after his monster-mash 254-yard rushing performance on 40 carries against the Spartans -just one yard short of Vagas Ferguson's single-game record -the sky was the limit for the man that had to replace the graduated Ferguson. 
"No, I had no idea I was that close to the record," said the ever-cheerful and smiling Carter after the game. "But that's OK. I'm only a sophomore. I've got a lot more time (to break the record)." 
Going into his final 60 minutes of football action for Notre Dame this Saturday, however, the senior Carter is hardly the buzz of the campus anymore. 
The only broken record that Carter ever seems to be as­sociated with now by fans and the press is the offensive attack that Notre Dame people have come to know in the last three years as "Carter left, Carter right, Carter up the middle." 
The new kid in town, in the person ofAllen Pinkett, is now the mainstay ofthe backfield. In comparison, Carter seems to be that one step slower, less flashy and less explosive than Pinkett, who has at times generated more electricity in football stadiums this year than Musco's mobile lighting units. 
In the last six games, meanwhile, Carter has picked up only 21 I yards on 48 carries. Although he still leads the team in rushing with 633 yards, he is averaging only 3.9 yards every time he totes the ball, and has scored only two touchdowns. 
The Heisman Trophy, once a realistic dream, is now but a long, faded-out memory. like this year's football team, Carter's career closes with only pleasant memories of what once was, and sad frustrations ofperhaps what could have been. 
"In all my years of football, I've never been that embarrased," recalls Carter of the Air Force loss. "There is just no way that we should have lost that game." 
There have been other frustrations for the Tacoma, Wash., native. An injury in that same Michigan State game led him to miss four games in a row in 1980 right at the peak ofhis career. And, of course, the Dan Devine-Gerry Faust transition has lent him a change in his style of running. 

"Devine's and Faust's systems are completely different," says Carter, "With Devine it was just line it up and run at them. We had about two or three set plays for an entire game. With Coach Faust we have several running plays planned a game. 
"I was more suited to Devine's system. He was the one that recruited me and he knew what kind ofrunning back he wanted for his system. Someone like Allen Pinkett, who Faust recruited, and Greg Bell (whom he didn't) are more suited to Faust's system ofhaving speed to the outside. I'm most effective on the off-tackle plays." 
For that very reason, don't sell Carter short on having an ef­fective career in the National Football League -if he gets drafted. 
"I definetely want to give the NFL a try," says Carter. "You don't see too many long runs in the pros. They usually want the back that can get that four, five, six yards on a carry. I think I could do all right in such a situation." 
While frustration has been evident in Carter's career, bitter­ness has not. 
''I'm happy with some of the things I've done and I've been happy with Notre Dame," reflects the two-year tri-captain. "I don't think a person is ever really happy though, or can ap­preciate something until he retires from it." 
Whether he has been happy or sad, however, Carter has always maintained his class of keeping a low profile and being a team man. For example, a feature that was supposed to be run on Car­ter by The Observer two years ago was scrapped when Carter politely asked not to have it run, since he felt he was receiving too much ink already. 
Today, he still greets feature articles with a smile and a quiet, sincere "could you find someone more deserving" inquiry. 
While his on-the-field performance has declined, his character as a person never has. Defensive line coach Greg Blache, who coached the running backs last year, described last year his own first impressions ofNo.22. 
"He's one of those people that jumps above everyone else in a crowd," praised Blache. "He's just a winner and he'll give whatever it takes to win." 
Indeed, whether it's been being the blockingfullback his fresh­man year for Vagas Ferguson, or making heroic touchdown dives for the winning score as he did against Alabama two years ago, or rushing for over 100 yards 11 times in his Notre Dame career, or gaining 2,327 career yards (placing him fourth on the all-time Notre Dame list, only 15 yards behind George Gipp), or yes, even just helping set-up a flea-flicker perfectly as he did against Pitts­burgh this year, Carter has given whatever it has taken to help Notre Dame to victory. 
And that's more important than any individual records he has or has not set at Notre Dame. 
Phil Carter

The NCAA cited violations dating from 1977 to 1982, which included giving players automobiles, televi­sion sets, clothing, "substantial" sums ofcash and other gifts. In addi­tion, the NCAA said Clemson had awarded scholarships to friends and relatives of recruits and paid telephone bills of recruits' families. 
In one case, the NCAA said: "In April, 1980, the head football coach, director of athletics and dean ofstu­dent affairs arranged for the univer­sity to pay the cost ofa dental bill on behalfofa student-athlete." 
"Due to the large number and serious nature of the violations in this case, the committee believed that institutional sanctions related to appearances on television and in postseason football games were "appropriate," ,1 Ian Wright, chair­man of the Infractions Committee, said in the release .

"It's a community event. To have students side-by-side with the ad­minstration -there was even someone here from the Board of Regents -creates a lot of com­raderie." 
Dillon pointed out that some of 
the notables taking part in the race 
included college vice president and 
dean of faculty Bill Hickey, vice 
president of college relations Larry 
Durance, and Sr. Eva Mary Hooker, 
the associate dean offaculty. 
First-place finishers in each 
category received a plaque -and a 
13-pound turkey. Second-and third­
piace finishers also were given 
plaques, while every participant 
received a cenificate. 
"When I started this a year and a 
half ago," said Dillon, "some told me 
that it would never work, because 
none of these had ever succeeded 
before. But with a lot of publicity, 
we've been able to make this a 
success."

Saint Mary's also received some bad news when it was learned that Van Ort may miss the next two weeks due to injury to her hand suf­fered in a collision. The Belles, who only had eight people dressed for the game, will probably start Trisha Nolan, who totaled nine points against Kalamazoo. 
The Belles seek their first victory tonight, as they travel to Siena Heights College in southern Michi­gan. 
Kalamazoo sophomore Laura Pawloski, who is considering transferring to Saint Mary's for her final two years, led all scorers with 22 points on eight baskets and six­for-eight at the charity stripe.
