Father-Daughter Weekend preparations underway 
By KATIE MCSHANE 
News Staff 
The fifth annual Senior Father-Daughter Weekend will kick off today with more than 500 expected to attend. 
"We're pretty excited about the weekend," said Father-Daughter Chairperson, Anne Farrel. 
Activities will include a "cocktail hour," various sports events, a barbeque, "Casino Night" and a Mass. 
Of these, Casino Night is par­ticularly popular, scheduled for Saturday. For this event Angela Athletic Facility will be furnished with card tables, roulette wheels and play money. Participants will be able to exchange raffle tickets for play money at the end of the evening. 
In addition, Jeff Roberts, as­sistant director of career and counseling at Saint Mary's will speak on, "Hiring Patterns of Liberal Arts Graduates." Also Dr. Rebecca Stoddart, a psy­chology professor at Saint Mary's will discuss "Father­Daughter Relationships: Prospects for The Future." Both are scheduled for Satur­day morning. 
"This will be a really special weekend for both fathers and daughters since many will be going out on their own next year," chairperson Anne Far­rel said. 
Government dept. announces new plagiarism policy 
By GREG LUCAS 
Senior Staff Reporter 
All government majors recently received a letter from Sharon O'Brien, undergradu­ate advisor, informing them of a new departmental policy re­garding plagiarism. 
The letter stated, " ... the department has established a departmental policy for 
plagiarism--failure  of  the  
course."  
The  new  policy  came  into  

being at the end of last year in response to an incident involv­ing three students, according to O'Brien. In this case, the stu­dents were required to rewrite their papers and were given failing grades for the assign­ment, but not for the course, said O'Brien. 
One additional case was de­termined to be plagiarism last year, after the policy had been formed, and the student was given a failing grade in the course, said O'Brien. 
According to O'Brien, there had been no set policy in the Government Department before last year regarding the penalty for plagiarism. "There is somewhat of an unwritten rule in the University that you fail the course" when found to 
have  commited  plagiarism,  
said O'Brien.  
O'Brien  added  that  before  

the policy, each case had been handled individually and there was some discrepancy in the punishments. 
"We felt that out of fairness to everyone, we should have a clear policy that is stated" said O'Brien, who said she originally proposed that the de­partment adopt a policy. 
"There was an increasing feeling (among the professors) that we should have a policy to deal with plagiarism as a de­partment" said O'Brien. The policy was formerly initiated by a vote by all members of the department, O'Brien said. 
"Much plagiarism is done from ignorance and not from malicious intent, but ignorance is not a defense" said O'Brien. 
The letter also contained a list of guidelines to help stu­dents determine what is and is not plagiarism. "Hopefully the letter will eliminate any new cases" said O'Brien. 
The penalty will only be im­plemented if an investigation by the Department's Honesty Committee finds that plagiarism has occurred, the letter said. The committee will be chaired by the undergradu­ate advisor, two appointed fac­ulty members and a student representative.

Some seniors still have another year to go 

Earlier this week I had a long conversation with one of my roommates from last year. Since he moved off-campus I don't see him too much. Anyway, after we caught up on past and future girlfriends, how bad all our classes were, and whether we'd be seeing an undefeated football squad in Miami, the conversation rolled around to next year. 
"Headed to law school?" I asked. 
"Yeah, it looks that way. I'll still be back for football, though." 
"Well, you can crash on my couch next year." 
It seems funny saying that, considering we're both seniors. 
While he and most of my classmates (95 percent, I think) are getting diplomas next May, I will be in the audience watching, no doubt a little teary-eyed. As a five-year Aerospace-Psychology major, I will be back for a second senior year. 
There are 30 or so of us, I am told, plus the architecture majors who spent a year in Rome. The archies all know each other, though. There's a group of people to hang out with that they know fairly well and can reminisce about freshman year with. Not so with us five-year 
majors, though. Five-year students outside of architecture rarely are in the same classes and do not have many opportunities to meet one another. 
I don't mean to imply that we are social recluses. Far from it, as we get to meet twice as many people because we take classes in two colleges. But most students know the people in their own class best. After next May, our class is 30 people. 
The five-year student leads a difficult life at times. Credit loads are high, with 18 being common and 21 not unlikely. Courses tend to be scheduled on top of each other since Arts and Letters doesn't try to schedule its courses around Engineering, or vice versa. Advisors for us don't seem to exist, since Engineering has us on file as Arts and Letters majors and Arts and Letters can't tell us much about ME328 -Differential Equations. We have fallen through the cracks in the Notre Dame system. 
People always seem to think double majors are weird, too. If I hear one more joke about psychoanalyzing astronauts I will probably hit somebody. 
Five-year students are thrown off campus by University Housing. Of course a fifth year of dorm life would probably sicken even the most chaste college student, but it is rather

disconcerting to be thrown out of the dorm after all the people you'd room off-campus with have all graduated. 
The worst part, though, is the knowledge that, while my colleagues all take off for law school or med school or jobs in "the real world," I will be coming back for another year of dining halls and snow. It is strange to see my friends walking to job interviews in three-piece suits and hear them talking about LSAT's and the CPA exam and med school applications. 
Sure, I sit and laugh and say "I'm glad I can skip all these interviews and hang around for a national championship next fall." But I imagine that sounds a little hollow. 
I can't honestly say I regret choosing the five-year option. I could never handle four years of solid engineering, and I don't love psychology enough to do that for the rest of my life. The double major has given me a breadth of courses and a wealth of options once I finally do leave. Five years of school meant I could go to London for foreign study, and I wouldn't have missed that for the world. 
It's tough to stay behind, though. I'm sure that next year it won't seem like such a big deal, and I don't lose sleep over it now. But it's already starting to occur to me that I've got a long year to go after this one.

"They're installing a chilled water line to Sacred Heart Church for the air conditioning system," said Gary Shumaker, assistant director of the physi­cal plant. 
"(The digging) is supposed to be completed before the Southern Cal game," said Shumaker, "It's supposed to be completed no later than the week of fall break." 
The excavation of the ground is several feet deep and extends for several yards between LaFortune Student Center and Sacred Heart Church. 
Shumaker said that the ex­cavation was started Monday so that the digging would take place between the inauguration of Father Edward Malloy and the four week string of home football games, starting with the USC game on Oct. 24, when the University has a large amount of visitors.

Reagan urges vigilance PERSONALS] 
at 611. 

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The White House denied Thursday that President Reagan advocates reconstituting the congres­sional subversives committees of the McCarthy era, even though Reagan suggested there is growing Communist in­fluence in Congress and in the media. 
In an interview with the Washington Times, Reagan said he fears people in this country have dropped their guard against Communist sub­version and said this sort of vigilance has become "unfas­hionable." 
"There is a disinformation campaign, we know, worldwide," the president said, "and that disinformation is very sophisticated and is very successful, including with a great many in the media and the press in America." 
Chief spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan, a onetime witness before the now-defunct House Committee on Un-American Activities, was "not calling for any new (Communist-hunting) organi­zations. He's just pointing out the historic development of Communist influence in America and some of the manifestations of it." 
"I don't think the press corps need feel like their reputation is blackened by this," Fitzwater added. 
But he also said Reagan "believes that the Communists have influence through various disinformation techniques and

plans and programs ... and that has influence on the Congress, on the public, on the press, and on everybody." 
Questions about Reagan's beliefs were raised at the daily news briefing after the Times on Wednesday published Reagan's interview with its Editor-In-Chief, Arnaud de Borchgrave. 
In that interview, Reagan was asked to comment on an article, published earlier, in which some conservatives in Congress voiced concern about they saw as a growing leftist influence on Capitol Hill. 
Reagan was asked to com­ment on statements made by Reps. Newt Gingrich of Geor­gia, Bob Dornan of California 

and Bill McCollom of Florida, own people, that you'reall Republicans, complaining depending on to support you,"of "hard-left members of the the president said. "And it's no

Reagan replied, "Well, ... that is a problem that we have to face." 
"Remember, there was once a Congress in which they had a committee that would inves­tigate even one of their own members if it was believed that that person had Communist in­volvement or Communist leanings. Well, they've done away with those committees," he said. "That shows the suc­cess of what the Soviets were able to do in this country with making it unfashionable to be anti-Communist."

Students lacking in responsibility 

Alcohol policy in need of review 
The other day, I was chatting with Jennifer, my sister, and Joe, both Law students here at Notre Dame. Some­how, we got on the subject of the Cath­olic Church's stand on artificial means of birth control, and I was asked for my opinion. I said that I was in favor of the Church's stand. At the time, though, my thoughts were muddled and I seemed to sound like a narrow­minded reactionary. But I realized that it all has to do with taking responsibility for one's actions. Naturally, people have sex for pleasure, but one cannot forget the possible consequence of preg­nancy. Birth control seems to me to be somewhat like putting a silencing device on a shotgun; it allows one to act irresponsibly without taking the consequences. 
Andrea Burman 
guest column 
Responsibility is something good which is rapidly becoming extinct. This is a "me" generation, and we want it all -without paying the price. The stu­dent body of Notre Dame (in general> is a perfect example of this, especially regarding the alcohol policy. I read the policy word for word and did not un­derstand why I didn't see the ugly face of opression glaring back at me. I even felt a little guilt (God forbid) for being among the lone supporters of the Alco­hol Policy. It has, would you believe, the audacity to tell the students to take responsibility! How dare the blood­thirsty administration impose such tyranny on us poor, weakling students who are here only for the simple pleasures of the joys of learning! And yet, I actually agree with it. 
If the University wanted a dry campus, alcohol would be banned. It is not; alcohol is very present on this campus, at times like a festering boil. As it is, in fact, we seem to be excep­tions to Indiana State Law. The policy says that irresponsible drinking will be punished, just like any other irrespon­sible behavior. No one is saying not to drink. If the alcohol policy is hindering your fun on campus, then you have big problems (anti-social behavior and al­coholism instantly come to mind -a 
The individual does.) If you can't be happy and carefree without alcohol, then I suggest you leave this institution and head straight for Alcoholics Anonymous. I don't shun those whoop­pose the alcohol policy, yet if you do oppose it, I ask you to look at yourself to see if your opposition stems from a refusal to drink responsibly. I would safely say that one-third of this campus is either alcoholic or heading in that direction. 
I had a bad experience with alcohol here at Notre Dame but I learned just how easy it is to lose control and there­fore how challenging it is to be respon­sible for my action. I agree with Jean Paul Sartre, who said that there are no excuses; we consciously choose all our actions, good and bad. It is time that the students here take responsibility and stop blaming the University for all their woes. 
Andrea Burman is a junior English major. 
A few years ago, the administration implemented an alcohol policy. Al­though I did not have the privilege to attend the University before the policy was put into effect, I heard all the stories from the seniors I lived with my freshman year. During those years before the policy there must have been a problem with alcohol abuse for some of the students or the University would not have come up with such a policy. But after a few years of the policy being put into effect, it is obvious to me that it has not worked. It has created more problems than it had attempted to solve. 
John Bodrozic 
guest column 
First of all, the problem of students abusing alcohol has not been solved by the policy. The administration has to realize that students will find a way to drink. Rules, such as no open contain­ers in the hallways or section parties, will not prevent alcohol abuse among the students. The University should try to promote a program which stresses responsible social drinking, rather than banning it. 
It is obvious to me that the policy has almost banned social drinking on campus and forced the students to go off-campus for social activities. This is an obvious fact which can be seen every weekend by the number of students at Campus View, Turtle Creek, and many student houses. This off-campus drink­ing has created many problems which might not have arisen if the alcohol policy had not directed social life off­campus. Some of the problems include strained relations between student

houses and neighboring houses because of loud music and parties. Then the police get into the act by raiding student houses and arresting students who are minors. Now the cited students have to pay the price for looking for social al­ternatives away from the campus. I don't know about other states, but in California when student parties get out of hand, the police break up the parties, but no one is arrested or cited; every­one is told to leave and that is it. 
Next, because the students go off­campus, they have to drive which presents the problem of drinking and driving. Because more students go off­campus to drink, the chances of people drinking and driving is greater. Don't get me wrong, the alcohol policy should not be to blame for people drinking and driving, but I think it increases the chances of it happening. 
It also appears to me that the admin­istration is quite hypocritical in its policy. If it is a Saturday afternoon on the day of a home football game, stu­dents drink freely among many of the alumni all around the campus and stadium. But next Saturday when the football team is playing away, if stu­dents are drinking on Green Field, then they are almost assured a visit to the Office of Student Affairs for violating the alcohol policy. Is there something wrong here? 
I don't know all the answers, but I think the University should try to treat the students like young adults and realize that in our society today, stu­dents are going to drink. I also feel that a serious review of the alcohol policy is needed because it did not solve the problems it was designed for, and it created some serious new ones.

Gulf incident supports stated policy 
1'11 admit it. I was one of those hy­percritical anti-Reaganists who ap­peared late this summer when the Ad­ministration announced the reflagging of 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers. Caught up in the mob mentality of further bashing an already battered president, I con­sidered the move folly. 
Matthew Slaughter 
and another thing 
In many respects it was. Not by choice did the administration decide to reflag the tankers, but rather by black­mail. If we had refused, Kuwait would have turned north and gotten the more than eager USSR to do the job. In­creased Soviet presence in the Persian Gulf is totally unacceptable, ergo ... Another textbook example of United States foreign policy reacting, not in­itiating. Then the supertanker Bridgeton struck a mine, and we sages eagerly chorused to the world a con­descending "I told you so." But Reagan persisted --and the events of the past few days have borne fruit for both the policy and other international issues. 
Night had fallen on the Persian Gulf a few days ago when the Iranian vessel Iran Ajr slipped out of port at Bandar Abbas. It sailed not alone --some 30 miles away three U.S. warships secretly watched its every move on radar. The vessel proceded directly toward the north-east, directly toward major international shipping lanes. Two OH-6A helicopters lifted off the USS Jarrett to investigate ... and oh my. 
At midnight local time the pilot spotted the vessel's crew "dropping ob­jects overboard which appeared to be mines." Without warning the helicop­ters openned up with a hail of rocket and machine gun fire. Hours later, as the ship listed dead in the water, US Navy SEAL commandos scrambled aboard and hit jackpot: nine primitive mines remained aboard, undropped. 
P.O. Box Q 
Community thanked for loving support 
To the Notre Dame Community: 
On behalf of my sister and all mem­bers of my family I express my deep gratitude to all of you for your prayers and support since the death of my par­ents. I regret that it is not possible to thank each one of you individually, but I hope this letter will convey to you how much all that you have done has meant to us these past three weeks. 
When word of the all-night vigils, the prayers, and Masses on the campus reached us, we were deeply moved. The power of prayer was very evident to me personally as I was able to get through some very difficult times be­cause of all of the prayers coming from this campus. 
All of the Masses, flowers, cards, notes, and words of sympathy and sup­port have been truly overwhelming. Even when words would not come, it was sufficient just to know that all of you cared, and that you were there with your prayers and concern. Mom and The Iranian crew was detained and later turned over to the Red Crescent, the crippled ship was blown out of the water by US ships, never to plant mines in international waters again. 
Finally, the United States' goal in sending some 40 ships to the gulf had produced tangible results to silence critics like me. Our stated policy goal has always been to aid in maintaining the free passage of merchant vessels through the gulf. How quickly we forget that as leader of the free world, the 
U.S. often must assume such roles. Tasks such as this may appear point­less to many --we aren't really doing anything, they will say, except inviting attack. Such errant opinions overlook a crucial reality of international rela­tions today: with the growing worldwide repulsion to war, the projec­tion, not utilization, of power takes precedence. 
The United States cannot cower from such obligations. Isolationist ten­dencies pull hard, but cannot restrain us. By sending our ships to the gulf, we send a clear message to the world com­munity; namely, that the seven-year bloodbath between Iran and Iraq can­not spill into the gulf and affect inter­national free trade. It's always lonely at the top, and this situation proved no different. Initially, the gulf states refused assistance from our forces, and our European allies, who have such a penchant for castrating the U.S. in public while crawling to it in private, refused military support. Now the gulf states warmly offer help, and no less than five European countries have quietly (surprise) sent contingencies. The Iran Ajr incident has provided con­crete evidence for those shortsighted of us that our presence in the gulf is both necessary and valuable. 
The incident has yielded good in an­other way. Consider Iran for a moment. I care not what nationality, creed, sex, or sign you are; if you hold any em­pathy for the government of the Ayatol­lah Khomeini, I hold nothing but con­tempt for you. Since seizing power in 1979, the regime has contributed not thing one to the betterment of the world. Consider some of the shennanigans Iran has recently dabbled in: inciting riots in Mecca which killed some 400 pilgrims, kidnapping Americans and others in Lebanon, bombing the Marine compound and leaving 243 dead ... the list seems endless. Time and time again, evidence in the wake of terrorist strikes has pointed in the direction of, but never directly at, Iran. 
My, how things have changed with the Iran Ajr's "smoking gun." How did the Iranians respond to being caught in the act? Like any other defense of the weak, their response abounded with lies and rhetoric. They labeled the Iran Ajr a merchant ship and denounced the charges of laying mines as ''a pack of lies." And the Iranian President Ali Khameni took the opportunity of speak­ing to the UN General Assembly to denounce the organization as "a paper factory for issuing worthless and inef­fective orders." The U.S. delegation rightly stormed out of the assembly as Khameni's drivel droned on without end. 
Governments which exhibit such a flagrant and repeated indifference to the established international order and organizations have no right to exist. The Khomeini government does noth­ing but pose a continuous threat to peace and stability in the Middle East and beyond. As of late, perhaps the world governments are finally aban­doning their ridiculous attempts to es­tablish ties with Iranian moderates (the definitive oxymoron) in the name of na­tional interests, and are realizing ces­sation of Iran's antics is in the interest of all. Witness the mounting drive in the UN for an arms embargo against Iran. Here a true opportunity exists to isolate Iran, one which should not frit­ter away. 
And the Iran Ajr incident has proven beneficial in yet another way. Stop for a moment and consider the general con­dition of America as of late. We have definitely seen better days; our position 

Dad truly loved this place, and their belief in Notre Dame would have been reaffirmed by the way the Notre Dame family came together in a time of per­sonal tragedy. 
It is good to be back home with you, and to share with you the many chal­lenges and excitement that await us in the months ahead. As these months pass, know how much your prayers will help, and how much it means to me to be a part of this Notre Dame family. Be assured of my prayers for all of you.

Criticism crucial to genuine growth 
Dear Editor: 

Last Monday's letters to the editor suggest a need for greater sensitivity toward fellow students. Eileen Doherty raised this point quite eloquently in her protest against the sexist comments which appeared in a Cavanaugh Hall window. Unfortunately, examples of sexism are abundant on this campus: in attitudes, language, grafitti in the library, and sometimes in Observer columns and cartoons. 
Speaking of insensitivity, since when is William Joseph Sammon the arbiter of valid sentiments? He may be right that the "Life in Hell" cartoon was in­tended to satirize rather than condone prejudice and stereotypes, but he does not help to improve the environment which minority students have encoun­tered here by claiming that people who found the cartoon offensive are "vociferous prigs" for expressing their opinions. 
Also troubling was David Spach's response to a letter from a freshman who was disillusioned by his first few weeks at college. I thought the earlier letter was poignant, and accurate in some of its observations. Granted, it was a bit melodramatic to use the dome as a personal symbol that things would improve. Such sentimentality pervades this campus, so perhaps it was helpful for Mr. Spach to warn a new student to keep it in perspective. 
Indeed, Mr. Spach began compas­sionately: "we can all appreciate the as a world leader has slipped. Every time we ask the West Germans and Ja­panese to expand their economies and thereby reduce our trade deficit, they scoff at us with indignation. The glory days of our space program have vaporized along with the Challenger, leaving the less spectacular but more reliable Soviet program far ahead in methodically pioneering space. In the Ryder Cup matches last week the Europeans snatched from us the title -­not even the Golden Bear could rally our linksmen. And we have by no means helped ourselves. Ollie North and his boys' cake and Bible bearing escapades made our government the headline act for the world audience. 

The Iran Ajr incident provided our government --and Americans on the whole--with a much needed lift. Amidst all the innuendos, uncertainties, and frustrations of daily foreign affairs, here appeared an incident which clearly provided a hero and a villain -­and America got to play the hero. As long as we do not digress to xenophobic extremes, feeling proud about America can go a long way. 
Thus American foreign policy benefited greatly from the Iran Ajr in­cident. But before we slap our backs too often, take a quick glance at Tues­day's Business section of the Chicago Tribune. "The United States imported more oil from Iran in July than any other country except Nigeria, accor­ding to the Commerce Department ... (some) 637,000 barrels of oil a day." We condemn their war effort, then pro­vide the badly needed currency to finance it. Will the United States ever develop a coherent, consistent policy toward anything? Someday. Just re­member the words of those lovable lads from Liverpool: "I have to admit it's getting better, a little better all the time." 
Matthew Slaughter is a sophomore gov­ernment/economics major and an As­sistant Viewpoint Editor. 
mixed feelings of a freshman." Yet switching to condescension, he declared that the complaints of the "petulant 18-year old" were not "of serious concern." 
Next Mr. Spach made the unjusti­fiable claim that The Observer should not be "the forum for his (the fresh­man's) emotionally charged question­ing of what the university has to offer.'' How kind! A guy feels lonely, in­decisive, and not quite part of this "Notre Dame family," and his peer belittles him for being "emotional'' and suggests that his opinions are not worth printing. 
Campus newspapers are not intended to be extensions of college booster clubs. Moreover, a university is not great merely because its students con­stantly tell each other that it is. Notre Dame is a great university in many ways, but let's not forget that criticism­-especially by newcomers who still have some objectivity--is crucial if a univer­sity is to grow and adapt.

esse Jackson at a youth conference must be the most charismatic preacher in the world today. He makes a liturgy out of telling It as it is, involving his listeners in a litany which they recite after him: "I am. Somebody. I am Somebody. Down with dope. Up with hope. My mind. Is a pearl.

Father Robert Griffin 
Letters to a Lonely God 
Holden feels overpowered by the evil in the world. He's so tired of obcenities at this point. it would madden him to read "F--k you" in a rhyming diction­ary. 
I don't want to poor-mouth 
the Black students I am anx­
ious to defend. They don't 
come here from the backwoods 
of Tennessee; they're a number 
of gene5ations away from living 
in Uncle Tom's cabin. Every 
student here has a separate 
history. Nobody can be a 
catcher in the rye, saving the 
children from a fall into the 
awareness of good and evil. 
Young eyes will always find the 
graffiti that the perverts have 
left for them. I can imagine a black freshman, street-wise and sensitive, hoping that he or she has come to the greener pas­ture on the other side of the fence. 
Notre Dame, the freshman is told, is a special place, free of the ordinary tensions common to the jungle. Then he or she reads a possible putdown in the college magazine, and feels that the insults are everywhere. Like "F--k you" in the rhyming dictionary, the context doesn't matter. The white brother can tell him that the slur is no put­down and shouldn't be re­garded as a personal insult. The white brother shouldn't be so quick to deny the Black his right to feel pain; this is sensi­tivity; this may even be justice: to try to walk a mile in your brother's moccasins, before telling him his pain is silly. 
The Notre Dame blacks will not be spared the pain of the real world. They didn't come here to be fitted with blinders, or a cocoon to hide in that will save them from jolts. Some Notre Dame Blacks are trying to interiorize what their leaders are telling them: "Nobody will save us for us but us. I am Somebody. My mind is a pearl." White students need to learn the lesson too: Black and yellow, red and white/All are precious in God's sightA1is eye is on the children of the world. 
What do Black students know of the Black experience in America? Jews keep the memory of the Holocaust alive: if the horror of the death camps is forgotten, the Jews say, the death camps could be repeated, and another Hitler is possible. That is why the Jews want to keep the conscience of mankind sensitive to the memory of the 6 million vic­tims. 
The tragedy of Blacks in American is not over. Every­thing ugly happening in the country hits the Black youth hardest: unemployment. drugs, teen-age pregnancy, disease, crime, the squalor of slum life. Black youth are the first to be­come school dropouts, the first to be drafted in time of war. They don't have to be reminded or horror by holocaust committees. The bad things that hurt them aren't happening in another country a half a century ago. Blacks are hurt by the everyday ine­qualities in America the beauti­ful. 
Recently, a student showed me a lapel button he borrowed from his father. The button identified the wearer as a member of SPONGE, an acronym for the "Society For The Prevention Of Negroes Get­ting Everything." My mention of SPONGE may be more unset­tling than any racial allusion the Scholastic has ever printed. The SPONGE button was con­sindered funny jback in the Civil Rights Days of the Sixties. It's re-appearance now is a sign of how prejudice carries over from one generation to an­other. 
Will the Black children at­tending schools in the inner­city grow up in a happier life­style than their grandparents knew? Will the smell of poverty, the homes without enough love in them because one parent is missing. the 
"The white bro­ther shouldn't be so quick to deny the Black his right to feel pain." 
street smarts that passes for wisdom, the drugs, the sexual climate, the inferior education, leave them unscathed? Not un­less a moral miracle happens; and if it doesn't happen, we will have more of the same. 
Are you a tacit supporter of the fear behind SPONGE, jealous, for a number of reasons, of the minorities that you feel are trying to inherit the earth, at least on the bas­ketball court or football field? Do you lack any passion for social justice anxious to see that Black and Hispanic lives are not wasted by ignorance and ugliness on city blocks where innocence is swallowed up by violence, and kids of 17 are a hundred years old? Is your mind full of bromides about Black people who make something of themselves being as good as you are, but why do so few of them try to be a credit to their race, and why do Blacks still tend to be losers, now that they have the vote? Do you stereotype Blacks in a way that degrades them, and excuses you from believing that Black tragedy is American tragedy, which diminishes not only them, but you? 
Is this mere rah-rah talk from a priest in his easy chair? A writer like Faulkner believes with good reason that America as the New Eden was cursed from the beginning by the new settlers' treatment of the Indi­ans and the introduction of slavery. As citizens of a land under a curse, are Americans free of the responsibility of working to regain the original blessing? Mere tolerance doesn't do anything to redress grievances in a rich land where children, most of them black, go to bed hungry, and slum dwellers, to survive, have to become welfare cheats. Who dreams dreams the size of Mar­tin Luther King's dream? Who, hearing King's dream, doesn't shrug it off as an impossible dream? 

A moral miracle could begin humbly. Hearts that beat with excitement to the ordinary prejudices aren't going to change overnight. Are you aware of your prejudices, as obvious as the effects of original sin? Could you pray to be exorcised of the racism which, whether you are con­scious of it or not, darkens your heart and weakens your will, or could you pray at least to be aware if you are a closet racist? 
Pray, not to be fair, but to be more than fair, toward peers who have not had your advan­tages. Even when a classmate 
complains of bleeding from 
wounds you don't think he is supposed to have, make an effort to be preternaturally polite; such politeness in itself could be a moral miracle. 

In the old love story, a suitor wears a mask not his own, to hide his plainness from his true love's eyes. When he fi­nally takes off the mask, his face is shining with borrowed beauty. Courtesy is the mask that can transform the wearer into the Christian he would like to be. Courtesy may have to be preternatural, if it is going to survive in the rough and tumble of healthy dorm life, but it goes a long way in taming the savage beast. 
Will today's five-year olds grow up in a country where they are pre-judged by the color of their skin? Undoubted­ly. You will never know. will you, if you could make things better for them, unless you try to help? Notre Dame is not the New Jerusalem, and you are not saints getting measured for your golden harps. But you are Christians who hope for a peaceful world. As Christian Americans, you have to pay more than ordinary lip service to the ideals which are sup­posed to be corner stones for life in a democracy. 
Black students have their work cut out for them, as Jesse Jackson makes plain. Why should I lecture them, In a campaign for brotherhood, as though I were carrying the cross of racism, and they were not? I agree with everything Jesse Jackson tells them, but they need to hear it from him before they hear it from me, not as a prophet, but as the echo of the prophet. teaching. Regardless of your politics, you shouldn't listen to the bigots who would cut Jesse Jackson down. In 1987, bigots are still trying to stone the prophets. How many prophets have we buried since Martin Luther King? Those who aren't buried may be publicly defrocked of their reputation and good name. Why should you let them discredit Jesse Jackson when he tells Blacks and white together: "You are Somebody"? He isn't around to preach mainly to the Blacks; he's your preacher too, and the salvation 
at stake may be America's

Reading Jesse Jackson's talks, I picture him as a new Moses, reminding scruffy nomads in the Sinai peninsula that they are the Lord's beloved children, destined to carry His words to the ends of the earth.

1\lack In American has been an 
ugly experience. During World 
War II. students were writing 
essays on how Hitler could be 
punished. A daughter of the 
ghetto made this suggestion: 
"They should paint him black, 
and make him live in America." 
My mother. watching the newsreels from Selma In 1965, said something startling: "I would hate God, if He had made me a Negro." As an aging lady in Maine, where the Blacks she might meet on the street were Pullman car porters who would never In a million years show themselves as poli­tical, my mother was conscious of the cross under which Black people struggled. She never read the Black writers, or even the white Southern writers, who have documented the suffer­ing. She saw Blacks only at a distance, and never in her life entertained a Black In her home. Still, she knew the prej­udice which made growing up Black In America humiliating. 
She would have been surprised to learn the number of blacks who love Christ very much. Even when they suffer, they don't hate God, and they don't hate being Black, or feel sorry for themselves at not being white. Perhaps they feel sorry for whites who are twisted inside by fear and bigotry, for whose sake, the Blacks have had to play games, like being Invisible in the way Ralph Ellison talks about, or role playing as Br'er Rabbit plays the game, to outfox the 
cratty Bre'er Fox. The anger of Blacks in America --so plain to see in protest writers like James Baldwin and LeRoi Jones --has always been out­weighed by the love and for­givenness in them. Otherwise, they would have burned down om cities generations ago. 
Recently, the strip in the Scholastic, putting Negroes in a 


class with drug pushers and # 
street gangs, stirred up trou­
ble. Some campus Blacks com­
plained that the comparison 
demeaned them. White stu­
dents were quick to explain to 
the Blacks that they were being 
over sensitive, since the al­
leged slur had to be under­
stood in the context of the art­
ist's intention. 
I understand the artist's in­tention. As a former WASP, I can see the artist intended no harm. In a culture entertained by the satire represented by Opus and Uncle Duke, "Life in .Hell" doesn't have to be cen­sured as hate literature, nor do the editors of "Scholastic" have to be pilloried for printing it. Someone should explain to the Blacks what they are reading in the funnies, but perhaps white students with a chip on their shoulders are not the best ones to do the explaining. 
The harm comes not from the panel to which the Blacks reacted; the harm comes from white students reacting indig­nantly to the way some of the Blacks reacted. Isn't it arro­gant, or at least insenstitive, for a member of the white majority to explain to a minority member whether he should feel he's had his nose rubbed in the dirt? 
Bigotry is so poisonous that even the suspicion of it is harmful. A rabbi reacted to the accusation against a New York Jew of being a slum landlord. The rabbi said: "Pogroms start with a wild accusation. Every­one tells the Jews: Don't over­react to a cheap shot. Be a good fellow, and turn the other cheek.' The Jew, as a good fellow, keeps his peace. The next time he's accused as a slum landlord, a mob throws rocks at his house. Then, the mob is burning the house down. Eventually, the mob is burning the Jews down. That's what Jews have learned from their history. You have to nip matters in the bud at the beginning. A cloud no bigger than a man's hand may be the start of a firestorm." 
Holden Caufield, the catcher in the rye. wants to save kids from falling over a cliff; that is, he wants to save them from losing Innocence, so he rubs out dirty graffiti that he sees on a wall. Finally, finding "F--k you" on the walls of a museum where kids will see it, he depairs over his awareness that the "perverts" will always keep ahead of him. "Probably, when you die," he thinks, "some per­vert will write F--k you' on your tombstone." A discouraged

Belles win third straight match 
By KATHY JENSEN 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's volleyball team continued its winning streak last Tuesday, defeating Bethel Colllege and improving its record to 8-3. 
The Belles won in four games, 15-12, 11-15, 15-10, 15-7, and currently have won their last three contests, two of which were conference games. 
The team played well and ran many difficult attacks. They also showed definite team uni­ty, a quality they previously have lacked. 
Dorsett among picket crossers 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-The striking NFL players union called Thursday for a resumption in bargaining -as nine more players, including Tony Dor­sett, broke ranks and returned to their teams. 
Management, however, said

''I am very pleased with their performance," said Head Coach Sue Medley, "Bethel presented a hurdle, but all four games were played with a quick and consistent pace." 
Junior Margaret Feldman, the Belles' team captain, led the team with sixteen kills, three attempts, three aces, and served a very strong third game. 
"Sophomore Mary McCarthy set a very fine game," com­mented Medley, "and junior Tammy Suth contributed a big offensive plus." 
it saw no reason for talks at 
this time. 
The defections brought to 48 the number who have crossed picket lines in the 10 days of the strike. Twenty-four have returned since Wednesday. Friday is the deadline for reporting and still getting this week's paycheck.

The fourth game showed strong serving by freshman Melissa Phillips, who recorded eight attempts and two aces. 
Despite the win over the Pilots, Medley indicated the Belles might need more work in a couple of areas if they are to continue their winning streak. 
"We need consistency in both our intensity and in our com­munication, though the team did show definite improvement in these areas Tuesday night," said Medley. 
Talks broke off last Friday with the two sides deadlocked on the union's demand for un­compensated free agency for players with more than four years' experience. 
Many of the players return­ing to work said free agency wasn't worth the walkout, al­though Dorsett, the biggest name in Thursday's group, was not among them. 
The 48 players who have returned are on 14 of the NFL's 28 teams and not all are union members -some are rookies who were on injured reserve rather than the active roster when the regular season started and were never eligible to join the union,

To that extent if there is a need, I don't know that there is, it may be self-funding in part or in total. But it is an area I have not looked at at all. Frankly there are just other areas with the season upon us that are claiming priority right now.

Women's cross country team looks to keep momentum 
By GREG GUFFEY Sports Writer 
Irish women's cross country coach Dan Ryan says his team is starting to put everything to­gether, and it looks as if his run­ners could not have picked a better time to do it. 
The Irish host the first-ever Notre Dame Invitational for women today at 1 p.m. at Burke Memorial Golf Course, and Ryan is guardedly optimistic about his team's chances in the 10-team event. 
"I would say they're right where we want them to be," Ryan said. "We've got four solid runners, and I think they're ready to run well." 
The meet will consist of a pot­
pourri of teams from all divi­
sions of the NCAA and the 
NAIA. Saint Mary's will com­
pete on the club level. 
Cardinals win, 8-2, clinch East 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS-Veterans Danny Cox and Dan Driessen were the unlikely heroes Thursday night, as the St. Louis Car­dinals beat the Montreal Ex­pos, 8-2, to clinch their second National League East title in the last three years. 
The Cards will face the San Francisco Giants next week in the National League champion­ship series. 
Cox, 11-9, faced a Montreal lineup that had batted .447 against him before Thursday. After allowing a first-inning run, he retired sixteen batters in a row. He struck out four and walked one. The victory was just St. Louis' seventh in 18 games against the Expos this season. 
Jay Tibbs, 4-5, lost in his second start since being recalled from the minors on Sept. 14. Tibbs was a late choice by Montreal Manager Buck Rodgers, who had ex­hausted his pitching staff while trying to catch the Cardinals. 
Tibbs' trouble started when John Morris led off the third with a triple. Tony Pena fol­lowed with an RBI groundout on a 3-0 pitch that tied the score 1-1.

"It is an advantage," noted Piane of running at Burke, "but the disadvantage is that while the other teams will be resting in hotels (on Thursday night), our players will be studying for their classes and exams (today)." 
Regardless of how the Irish fare at this meet, the tough competition can only serve to strengthen the team as the season progresses. 
"We still haven't run well this season,'' said Garrett, despite last week's second place finish and a blowout vic­tory over Georgetown. "We are a good team -everyone's just got to put it all together in one race and we can do well." 
"Virginia is the team to tween the first and fifth-place beat," Ryan said. "It'll be an runners will determine the interesting race. There are a final finish for the Irish.

ND sweeps DePaul 
Special to the Observer 
One day after having its seven-match winning streak snapped by Northwestern, the Notre Dame volleyball team quickly got back in track with a 15-3, 15-3, 16-14 sweep of DePaul last night. 
Juniors Zanette Bennett and Mary Kay Waller led the Irish charge at DePaul. Wal­ler led Notre Dame with 10 kills, while Bennett recorded six kills in seven attempts for an .857 hitting percentage. Bennett did not play the third game, as al­most all of the Irish sub­stitutes saw action in the match. 
Sporting a 12-3 record, the Irish end their road trip tonight at Butler before re­turning home to face the University of Iowa Saturday night at 7:30p.m.
