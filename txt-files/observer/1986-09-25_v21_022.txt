College hoops is all hoopla 
"College athletics are a farce." 
1 was sort ofshocked when I heard these words. These words came from, of all people, a TV cameraman covering one of Notre Dame's men's home basketball games last year. 
He and I were eating hotdogs In the pressroom. The cameraman was taking a break from shooting highlights for a local TV station. I was taking a break from my volunteer job as a statistician for the basketball team. 
"All this is made possible by a bunch of teenagers running around playing a game," the cameraman said ofthe event that was taking place In the arena. The cheering, the crowds, the band, the excitement. All the hoopla. The entire event was meaningless, he said. It was all contrived. 
This event seemed to me to be his livelihood. Because someone had contrived this event. he had a job. 
Yet he said he hated being there. It was all too shallow. 
He would still have a job if there were no "big­time" college basketball, he said. There were plenty of real events involving real people out there that he would rather be covering. All he did here was film a few seconds of a fast break here, a glimpse of an ecstatic crowd there. 
Every week. major crimes are committed, premature babies are saved by medical miracles, and happy families celebrate their good fortunes. These are real concerns and real celebrations, he said. This is real news; these things are important. 
But at that moment, there were thousands of people around the corner from us in the arena sinking In unison into the depths of despair and then soaring to the heights of celebration all be­cause a bunch of teenagers were playing a game. 
One wonders how the first varsity basketball coach at Notre Dame recruited his players. Per­haps he put up a sign in the dining hall and then stood on a soapbox saying, "I know you all came to this tine school because you are bright and you want to get an education. But maybe five of you would like to have a little fun in your spare time." 
Consider today's recruiting. We don't look for 4.0s and see if any of them happen to be able to shoot hoops, too. We gun for the best basketball talent In the land and then pray they somehow manage to meet the standards of Proposition 48. 
Basketball Is the number one priority in our players' lives. If we hear that a player has failed a test. our first fear Is not that he may be struggling 
with  his  education.  Our  first  fear  Is  for  his  
eligibility.  
Traditionally,  each  Notre  Dame  basketball  

season starts out slowly as the Irish play lesser­known and local teams: easy teams. The players study hard In the fall -their second semester eligibility depends on it. Then, after finals are over, the players' heads belong to the coach. 
When the TV cameraman spokeofall this hoopla being for some teenagers playing a game, he didn't say that they necessarily have any fun. 
Students, alumni, and other fans place in­credible pressure on the coaches to produce a winning team. And the coaches place Incredible pressure on the players. With so many drills to run, situations to cover, and films to watch, there Is little time for fun and games. 
Jim Riley 
Copy Editor 



Even student managers, who for the most part are volunteers, quickly discover that the pizzazz of the big-time basketball stage show disappears when they go backstage. Locker rooms and closed practices are no bowl of cherries for anybody in­volved in high-pressure, big-business, big-time basketball. In the big time, there's no room for fun and games. 
I had started eating my hotdog at halftime--the hotdogs are free in the pressroom since the press is a key part of the hoopla machine--and I realized by the Intermittent roar of the crowd that the second half had been going on for some time. But I wasn't all that eager to get back to the ex­citement 
Suddenly, the cameraman said, 'Tm here be­cause my boss sent me. Why are you here?" 
Well, I said, I had started working for the team because I thought it would be fun. That didn't really turn out to be true. But I hung around anyway. The more I saw of the team and the more I thought about college athletics, the more disil­lusioned I had become. But I hung around anyway. 
"But, really, why did you hang around?" he asked as the crowd roared again in the back­ground.· 
For the same reason the crowd comes out every week. Not to see some teenagers run around and play a game. But for a little of the glory, and for all of the hoopla.

French Prime Minister urges end to terrorism 
UNITED NATIONS -Prime Min­ister Jacques Chlrac of France urged the United Nations yester­day to stamp out International terrorism, which has cost his country nine lives In the past two weeks. 
Chirac told the 41st General Assembly that terrorism is the most urgent challenge to the world and requires concrete countermeasures, Including joint action to Improve security In the air and on the sea. 
"The tragic events In Istanbul, Karachi and Paris prove once again that terrorism has become the systematic weapon of a war that knows no borders or seldom

has a face, Chirac told delegates. 
Nine people have been killed and more than 160 injured in five bombings In Paris since Sept. 8. 
Terrorists stormed a synagogue In Istanbul, Turkey, on Sept. 6, killing 21 worshipers. Two gunmen also were killed. Twenty people were killed after hUackers opened fire Inside a Pan Amjetliner in Karachi, Pakis­tan, on Sept. 5. 
Chlrac reminded delegates that among terrorism's victims are the French, American and British hostages held In Lebanon. Word of another French kidnap victim In Lebanon came yesterday, when a group called Revolutionary Justice claimed It had abducted a man the group called a French secret service agent. 
Chlrac, who entered the U.N. building behind a phalanx of American security agents, said terrorism "would take us back to ages we thought were long gone If we allow It a free hand to cor­rupt democracies and destroy the basic rules of International life." 
The French prime minister ad­dressed the third day of the as­sembly's so-called "general debate,II which features a parade of government leaders from among the 159 U.N. member states. 
Other speakers Wednesday in­cluded Mexican President Miguel de Ia Madrid and Chinese Foreign Minister Wu Xuequlan. 
In his speech, Chlrac said countries have "not always shown the necessary lucidity toward this scourge (terrorism) which some would like us to think is the sole means of ex­pression of the oppressed. 
"The odious methods It uses, the slaughter of Innocent people perpetrated In free societies, the ongoing blackmail over the lives of hostages rule out our confus­Ing, even in some small way, those actions with genuine resis­tance," Chirac said. 
He condemned states "willing to close their eyes to terrorist or­ganizations' activities or that do not hesitate to use them to their own advantage and even actually encourage them."

Panel defines eligibility for new AIDS treatment 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A panel of ex­perts yesterday finalized criteria on who will be eligible for an ex­panded trial of the first promis­Ing drug treatment for AIDS, but said the Information would not be made public until government regulators review it. 
Government health officials, academic researchers and repre­sentatives of the pharmaceutical company which makes the drug met at the National Institutes of Health for several days before finalizing test criteria. 
Kathy Bartlett, a spokes­woman for Burroughs Wellcome Co., developer of the drug, said the research proposal would be submitted tomorrow to the Food and Drug Administration. 
"According to the FDA, the review will be completed early the following week," Bartlett said. 
Meanwhile, Otis R. Bowen, sec­
retary of health and human ser­
vices, told restaurant owners 
they should allow employees 
with AIDS to keep working In 
their kitchens. 
A walter or kitchen worker with 
AIDS should only be taken off 
the job, Bowen said, if there is 
"evidence o! other Infection or 
Illness for which any food service 
worker should also be 
restricted." 
Bowen told the National Res­
taurant Association, "All the 
epidemiologic and laboratory 
evidence we have Indicates that 
blood-borne and sexually­
transmitted Infections like AIDS 
are not transmitted during the 
preparation or serving of food or 
beverages." 
"No Instances of this happen­
Ing with AIDS have been docu­
mented," he added. 
After the FDA review of the new 
Burroughs Wellcome drug, the 
company's spokeswoman said, 
criteria for the expanded Inves­
tigational New Drug trial will be

House defeats bill for local revenue sharing 
WASHINGTON House leaders yesterday night moved to kill the General Rev­enue Sharing program with­outa vote, quietly deleting the $~.4 billion for local govern­ments from an omnibus spending bill scheduled for full House action today. 
The House Rules Commit­tee, by voice vote and without debate, sent to the House floor a last-minute substitute for the pending $567 billion 
measure,  deleting only  the  
revenue sharing money.  
The  action  required  an  

abrupt turnaround by Rep. Jamie L. Whitten, D-Miss., chairman ofthe House Appro­priations Committee, who had kept alive revenue sharing In the massive spending pack­age despite Reagan adminis­tration opposition and Congress' own voted Intention to terminate the program in

Whitten had persuaded his 
committee to cut other pro­

However, House Speaker Thomas P. o'Neill Jr., D-Mass., other House leaders and com­mittee chairman said they op­posed extending the program at the cost of others. The federal government, which has been run~ing deficits In excess of $200 billion, can no longer afford to continue passing along money to municipalities, they said. 
Under pressure from House leaders, Whitten submitted the substitute plan yesterday. "He had no choice," said an aide, who spoke on the con­dition of anonymity. 
The rules committee then sent the substitute bill to the floor Instead of the original, and barred any floor amend­ments to add the money back ln.

BOSTON -Nearly 40 percent of doctors under age 40 admitted in a survey that they used mari­juana or cocaine to get high with friends, and a quarter of doctors of all ages said they recently treated themselves with mind-affecting drugs. 
Overall, more than half the physicians and three-quarters of the medical students who partic­ipated in the Harvard University survey said they have used drugs at least once for self-treatment, to get high or to help them stay awake. 
Only 1 percent of the doctors surveyed said their drug use had ever caused them to give poor care to patients. 
Most physicians use these drugs only occasionally, if at all.

Soviets consider freeing Daniloff 
Associated Press 
UNITED NATIONS -Soviet of­ficials yesterday considered a two-stage U.S. proposal to let American newsman Nicholas S. baniloff leave Moscow, and Secretary of State George P. Shultz left the door open for an­other meeting with the Soviet foreign minister. 
"We're working on it," Shultz said in between meetings with foreign ministers attending a special U.N. General Assembly session. 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze held his own series of talks, and told reporters while posing for photographs with French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac: "the less noise the better. We con­tinue to work in a calm atmo­sphere." 
Shultz and Shevardnadze met twice Tuesday. One U.S. of­ficial said yesterday that the negotiations were "active," and that Shultz might see Shevardnadze again.

proposal would let Danlloff leave Moscow while Soviet physicist Gennadi Zakharov Is tried in Brooklyn on spy charges. If Zakharov Is con­victed, he would be exchanged for an unspecified number of Soviet dissidents. 
Administration officials publicly refuse to equate the Danlloff and Zakharov cases, saying the U.S. News & World Report correspondent is Inno­cent. They also rule out any trade. But privately, they ac­knowledge the proposal has been put to the Soviets for con­sideration. 
The proposal was advanced by the Reagan administration soon after Daniloffwas arrested on Aug. .30 and appeared this week to be the basis for the 
U.S.-Soviet d lscussions. 
Shultz merely raised his hand in a restraining gesture when asked by reporters yesterday night if another meeting with Shevardnadze was in the of­fing. He also refused to say if there was progress in efforts to free Danlloff. 

Shevardnadze said earlier yesterday that ''we have given good proposals" to the Americans. "They must think about them." 
But a U.S. official in Washing­ton said: "there hasn't been anything acceptable to us that the Soviets have proposed yet." 
Shevardnadze, emerging from a meeting with a Maltese official at the United Nations, said he still believed there was a chance of resolving the Danlloff dispute. 
"Yes, yes, there's a possibili­ty. There is a chance. Every­thing's up to the American side," he said. 
Asked if some sort of ex­change had been discussed during the negotiations, he replied: "Don't Interfere with them. Give us a chance to work." 
Presidential spokesman Larry Speakes said yesterday In Washington that the "issue is not resolved."

Claiborne pleads for tax evasion acquittal 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Abandoning calm testimony In his own defense, federal Judge Harry E. Claiborne beseeched the Senate Impeachment Committee Tues­day to acquit him If it believes he was the victim of the "brutal errors" of Income-tax preparers. 
Asked by Sen. Mitch McConnell why a convicted tax evader should be exonerated In his Im­peachment trial, Claiborne leaned into a microphone and pleaded for acquittal, "If you honestly feel in your heart I got a raw deal." 
Claiborne, serving time in a federal prison while still carrying the title, and salary, of chief U.S. district judge for Nevada, tes­tified for the second straight day In his 6-day-old trial. 
65 mph limit OK'd for portions ofinterstates 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Senate yesterday approved a $52..3 bil­lion highway bill that would in­crease the maximum speed limit to 65 mph on rural portions of interstate roads, but a House chairman Immediately responded with a threat to let the proposal die. 
"I don't know whether we will go to conference as long as this is In the bill," declared Rep. Jim Howard, 0-N.J., chairman of the House Public Works and Trans­portation Committee. 
"I don't know how anybody could vote for legislation that

The trial followed a unanimous House Impeachment vote earlier this year. The committee of 12 senators hearing evidence will , later hand the case to the full Senate for a verdict on whether Claiborne can keep his lifetime 
job on the federal bench. 
In addition to urging a favor­able decision so he could restore 
his  own  battered  life,  the  69­ 
year-old  Claiborne  maintained  
that  the  independence  of the  

federal judiciary would suffer if judges could be "literally chased from the bench for any reason." 
Launching into his theme that he was framed by vengeful federal prosecutors, the judge said, "The biggest danger I can see to the federal courts is ifever there be created a buddy rela­tionship between the federal 
judiciary and the executive branch of government." 
could result In so many deaths, In so many paralyzing injuries and other serious Injuries on the nation's roads," Howard added In a statement released by his committee. 
If the House and Senate ver­sions of the legislation do not go to a conference committee, the differences in the bills would remain unresolved by next month's congressional aqjourn­ment. 
Thus, the four-year program authorization, which envisions $1 2  .35 billion In federal highway aid annually, would not go to the White House for President Reagan's signature. 
The provision to permit state legislatures to raise the speed limit from the current level of 55 mph to 65 mph on portions of the Interstate system outside the nation's cities was approved Tuesday night by the Senate. 
The lawmakers yesterday ap­proved the bill Itself, which would also bar construction of bil­lboards along federal highways.

Americans' labels of Communism are unfounded 
One of the things that strikes me most about public opinion in the United States is the fervent anti-communist mood. Frankly, I'm quite shocked at the level of hatred, oversimpPfication, misinforma­tion and falsification when it comes to the discussion about communism or the Soviet Union. 
Peter Palesch 
guest column 
Be assured, "Communists" are human beings like you or me, have families for whom they care, they enjoy life, yes, they even smile and laugh and they want peace just as we do. Surprised? Well, if you watch movies like Rambo or rely on columns like "Talks with Communists not always the answer" (Kevin J. Smant in The Observer Viewpoint of Sept. 7) you probably are. 
What bothers me most in these anti­communist tirades is the often implicit assumption that "we in the West" (as Kevin described the United States and its allies) are the moral superiors. We are the good guys, the others the bad guys. And thus we can justify everything we do in the name of anti-communism (for ex­ample the overthrow of truly elected gov­ernments a in the cases of Chile and Guatemala or the support for so-called "freedom fighters" who specialize in ter­rorizing the population of Nicaragua). After all communism is a bad and every­thing against it is a good. Simple, isn't it? 
To bolster the claim of the bad com­munists, some recent Soviet misdeeds are vividly pictured -in most cases the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan

provides proof enough for the ar­gumentations that the Soviets are aggres­sive warmongers. At the same time however, it is conveniently overlooked that the Soviet Union's invasion of Af­ghanistan has its counterpart in the United States' policy via Nicaragua, El Sal­vador and Guatemala. 
Although the justification of the U.S. involvement in these countries, i.e. defense of human rights and democracy against communist aggression suggests a "good cause," I would argue that it is not very different from the Soviet Union's justification of their invasion, i.e. defend­ing Afghanistan aganst imperialist ag­gression. This becomes obvious if we look back at the long history of U.S. in­volvements in Central America: the defense of human rights and democracy did not play any role in the U.S. policy in Central America. What it boils down to is simply the policy of a superpower that does not allow for independent nations in its self-declared security zone. Alone the possibility that such a nation could formulate policies which might be harm­ful to U.S. interests ( whatever these are or whoever defines these) is conceived as a threat that has to be eliminated. Is that so different from what the Soviets are doing? 
It is interesting to note that in this con­text the label "Communist" suddenly takes on a new meaning. Everyone who does not agree with and acts against the status quo easily becomes a Communist 
just in the same way as in the Soviet Union everyone who fights against the almighty state apparatus may be labeled an im­perialist agent (with all its consequences). And again, because being a communist is a bad we do not have to be concerned with human rights or democracy while 
Is right. What Notre Dame · nationally known as the Mecca of College social life needs Is more administration Involve­ment In our private lives. The University's crackdown on fun should not be halfway: fun should be completely abolished. I nominate Lou a the student leader of this noble crusade. 
The first question I want to ask Mr. Sarabando Is whether he has ever been to an SYR. Those two nights a semester on which he said we act like "Class A jerks" and have the "Domer mentality'' are some of the best nights at Notre Dame.

fighting this communism. 
Is that our moral superiority? Isn't the killing of children in Afghanistan as morally wrong as the killing of children in Nicaragua-even ifthey were "real com­munist" children? Obviously President Reagan and many in Congress think dif­ferently, or probably they don't care. 
Another area of supposed proof of So­viet aggression is the arms race. While all we hear about the United States is its need for security, the Soviets are portrayed only as potential aggressors. But don't they have security needs too? After all they experienced painfully what it means to be invaded and they still haven't forgotten this. What should they think of the rapid expansion of the U.S. military force in the light of President Reagan's repeated remarks that the So­viet Union is evil and thus has to be erased? Shouldn't they feel threatened by the U.S. quest for being Number One ­and answer with increased military spend­ing'? 
Please, don't misunderstand me, donot want to justify any Soviet action like the invasion of Afghanistan nor am I interested in showing how bad "we in the West" really are. But before we raise the claim to be the good guys, we'd better clean up our own house and realize that both, the United States and the Soviet Union are superpowers playing super­power geopolitics. Therefore patriotic self-righteousness is totally out of place.

P.O.BoxQ 
These nights give us an opportumty to ask someone, either a friend or someone we are Interested In, to have a good time in the dorm. Unless you like to get laughed at, "Let's go for a bottle of club soda and discuss the origins of life,"just doesn't cut it. 
If I'm not mistaken it Isn't written on all SYR tickets that the holder ofthis ticket must get sloppy drunk and vomit uncon­trollably In the bathroom. 
As he said, "Ifwe need alcohol to enjoy our weekends, we are not at the right Institution." If we all didn't want the op­portunity to drink we would have gone to 
Garry Trudeau 

Brigham Young or Oral Roberts. 
The administration gives us the oppor­tunity to have a good time, and I'm sorry if you don't take advantage of it. Why don't you go to an SYR and see how much fun the "other half" has exhibiting the "Domer mentality." Let me know how it goes and maybe we'll do lunch.

Cluchey's 531st Performance In 'Krapp's Last Tape' Masterful 
Laura Lindner 
features writer 
Rick Cluchey's 5.31 st perfor­mance of Samuel Beckett's "Krapp's Last Tape" was a mas­terful conviction. The audience at Washington Hall, both stu­dents and adults, was spiritually and emotionally moved despite a technical breakdown in the sound system. 
The intricate spatial arrange­ment of the stage combined with the mechanical and lyrical details of Cluchey's performance made Beckett's distilled vision of the human condition highly evoca­tive. 
On stage~~ ~~ 
Krapp's Last fape 
Cluchey, appearing In tattered old clothes, was the focal point on a darkened stage advertising a celebration of Beckett, the quintessential writer of the 20th century. Krapp is a mechanism of facial expressions, weary sighs and resonating grunts as he enters his dimly lit den com­posed merely of a worktable, chair and hanging lamp. The au­dience was intensely waiting, a common element in Beckett plays, for conversation amid total immersion in Cluchey's detailed use of non-verbal com­munication. 
Cluchey engaged in a series of repetitive, physical and tactical movements and gestures, in­cluding a mugged facial expres­sion when confused or con­centrating, contrasted with a stark dimensional, almost exag­gerated, opening of the eyes when thinking or remembering. Ail of this pervaded Krapp's sys­tematic eating of banana halves, giving his character an essence of triviality and emptiness. 
Following this comical, but yet depressing, scene with an old, preoccupied man with nothing better to engage his mind, Clue­hey brings out the essential prop, a reel-to-reel tape recorder and a series of boxes. At this point Krapp began the activity that consumes his waking hours. He looked up a particular tape in a book that indexed each spool, his .39th birthday, "box .3, spool 5." It was at this point Krapp ut­tered his first audible words, reveling in the word "spool" and cataloging the topics of the tape. When Cluchey began to play the tape, the sound system unfor­tunately failed to produce causing a break in the perfor­mance. 
Despite technical difficulties, the show continued flawlessly. In the play Krapp is a 69 year-old man confronting his .39th birthday. While listening to the tape, the audience learns that the man at .39 Is not the same man as he was 1 0 years ago because he has given up all vision of his "Opus Magnum." He wants to return to the time when he was happy with a woman and despite the mention of eight women In the play, it is evident Krapp Is a bankrupt lover and desperate al­coholic.
