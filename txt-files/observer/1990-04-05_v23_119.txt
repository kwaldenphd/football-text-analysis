INSIDE COLUMN 



American system leaves time for growth 
A nineteen-year-old family friend walked into her first class at Cambridge University last fall and was given a corpse. minus the head. 
As an English stu­

dent she did not have Alison Cocks to complete an undergraduate degree Editor-in-Chief 
before beginning her three-year course in medicine. 
Her professor told the class that the corpses were theirs to dissect for the next two years; as each section of the anatomy was covered, the students would gain hands-on experience. Once they reached third-year status, they would be allowed to work with the heads. 

People rant about having to waste time on boring introductory classes, but imagine walking into Biology 102 on the first day of classes and encountering that. It's probably difficult to picture because in this country it would never happen. 
The American system is often berated when compared to its counterparts around the world. Some of the criticism -.is legiti­mate--Americans do not leave high school with as strong a foundation for advanced studies as an English student would, for ex­ample. 
But the American system does take emo­tional development into account. School is not merely a system to pass through on the way to a job or a university education. It's also an environment, a place a student is supposed to feel something for, be it posi­tive or negative, when he leaves it. 
At 18, when the average American starts college after a lengthy application process, he prepares to make some hefty adjust­ments. Aside from the new environment, he or she often copes with a changing relation­ship with parents and school friends as the pressure to find the right major in prepara­tion for the _right career in the right city with the right salary evolves. 
At 22, when he walks into medical school for the first time, at least his ambitions are more focused and he's an old hand at find­ing a niche and keeping parents at arm's length. Now. maybe, he's ready for his first corpse. 
The average English student is 19 when the mixed blessing of leaving home is thrust upon him. He may have the knowledge re­quired for entrance into med school that the American student does not, but he isn't much more mature emotionally than the American freshman. He doesn't have time to stop and think about whether this is the right idea or whether his calling is really art. He's there already before he's quite through with adolescence. At 22, he's a res­ident in some hospital working suicidal hours. 
Time may stand still in Intro to Psychol­ogy, but at least drowning out the professor means time to relax.

The men said that presently kids are joining gangs as early as twelve or thirteen years of age. They said that in compari­son with the 1970s and early 80s, no one is forced to join a gang now and it is easier to 
drop out of one. Previously, there was a death penalty for leaving a gang. 
Another of the group, Aaron Smith, stated that "higher-class people sell drugs" and that gangs only sell enough drugs to get them the cash they need. When asked if the movie "Colors" was realistic of their experiences, the Cabrini-Green residences laughed and said that "no way" was the movie like Chicago. 
The group told stories of their bad experiences with the police. Several members of the group described similar in­stances when the police would round up a hunch of gang members after a shooting. They would hold them and sometimes beat them until someone confessed who the culprit was. 
Webster told of an iqstance when he and a friend were picked up by police and put in the back of a squad car. When they got out, the police showed them drugs previously placed under the back seat and ac­cused them of placing the drugs there. 
All of the group said that they wanted jobs, but said that most jobs were for minimum wage. Often jobs were in places they could not get to because some­times there was no public transportation and they could not walk to the jobs because it

was in other gangs' territory. 
When asked what could be done to alleviate some of the problems in the projects, they all agreed it would be to "get everyone jobs," with good hours and pay. They described the frustration of working for minimum-wage jobs when deal­ing drugs can earn someone over $200 a day. 
School was described as just as violent as the streets. Many said they went only to the classes where they thought there would be gang trouble. 
The group said that the main problem they had with high school was that the classes were boring and the teachers indifferent. They described their frustration at having trouble in class coupled with teachers who were unwilling to reach out and help. 
Most said that they would have stayed in school if they found the classes more interesting. 
When Smith was asked why he dropped out of school if he wanted to play basketball as a career, he seemed regretful and said that he "wasn't thinking." Some said they were going to return lo school or take the GED test.

fighting. The Cabrini-Green speakers said that their actions help ease the violence in the area. 
Tomes and Fogerty were first believed to be undercover police by the gang members. However, they were later accepted when the gangs became more famil­iar with them. 
They help mediate talks be­tween gangs and often perform funeral masses for victims of the gang violence. Fogarty said that after a funeral, there is a "better bond" between them­selves and the gang members. 
Brother Tomes said that he has been shot at 28 times. Tomes described the love he has for all of the men in the project, and said he would be "glad to die for them." He said that the times he is shot at are the times of "the greatest peace in him." 
Tomes had at least a hundred pamphlets with him. Each pamphlet had the picture of someone who had been killed in gang activity. 
When asked if the group had any bad feelings towards the Notre Dame audience, the group responded by saying they felt only positively for their good fortune. The audience was impressed by the candidness and personability of the speak­ers. 
The Cabrini-Green group ex­pressed their pleasure in having the opportunity to answer the students' questions. They said that students would be welcome at Cabrini-Green. 
Tomes summarized by saying he thought presentations such as this helped people to under­stand that "people are all the same, only in different circum­stances."

. so the most intense career 
times do not coincide with the 
most important parenting 
times. 

These strategies have been 
tried out and they are cost­
effective, according to Beck. 
Problems such as confiicting 
personal styles can make job 
sharing difficult and small 
firms cannot always afford to 
give employees leaves. These 
obstacles, however, should not 
stop women from talking to 
their employers and asking for 
working options that suit their 
needs, she said. 

"There is no real reason why 
women should not begin to 
change the workplace," said 
Beck. 

Beck said she is leery of long 
periods of day care for babies 
and young children. She 
believes that small children 
have a need for one-on-one 
parenting for a large portion of 
each day. 

She quoted a pre-school 
research project report that 
said "Babies and toddlers need 
to spend a large part of the day 
with someone who is crazy 
about them."· 

Although Beck said that not enough is known about the effects of day care on children,

reports of increased sickness among children and the possibility of lower LQ.s among youngsters, are reasons to be concerned about day care. 
Beck is a member of the Chicago Tribune's editorial board and writes a twic~­weekly column on social issues for the editorial page which is distributed through the Knight Ridder Tribune News Service to other papers.

Greeks ready for vote 
Communists hope to share power 
I'IHAEUS, Gn~nen (AI') -De­spito tlw collapse of commu­nism elsewlwn~ in Europe, Grnnk Communists arn hoping

The most rneen t polls predict thn Communist-led Coalition of tlw Left and l'rogrnss will win 
10.5 pnrcnnt of thn vote, down from 11 percont it scornd in Novembor Ploctions. 
Thn consnrvativn Nnw l>nmoeraey party is nxpneted to n~main at 4(, pnreont and the l'anlwllnnie Socialist Movmncnt, or PASOK, at 40 pPrcent. 
II' tlw conservatives fail to win a majority in tlw 300-mem­lwr l'arliamnnt. tlw Communists may lw ablo to shan~ power again, as thny havo for tho last I 0 months. 
They toamnd up with thn con­sPrvativns aftnr inconclusive nlnctions in Jurw, and thPn with tlw socialists in an all-party govnrnment in November. Mnanwhile. Communist rPgimes in Eastnrn Europe wern being topplnd in popular nwolutions. 
"Tiw Grnd p1~opln will not judge us bncausn of thn myths that nxistnd in Eastnrn Euro­JHHtn countrins," said Mimis Androulakis. thn Communist Party's key stratngist and re­forrnnr. "ThPy havn judged us by our decades of struggle for d.emoc~.acy and progress in Greece. 
The Greek Communists were outlawed from 1947 to 1974, and political scientist Mihalis Spourdalakis says this may have saved them. 
"In Greece, the Communist left has always been identified with the struggle for civil rights, for parliamentary democracy. On the other hand, we havn had an authoritarian anti-Communist tradition. Communism is therefore not identified with authoritarian­ism, but rather with progress," he said. 
Menia Mendrinou, a long-time Communist Party organizer, said the party's supporters may have "bnnn numbed by events in Eastern Europe, but they won't vote for any other party. They still bnlieve that the party will protect their interests." 
The Communists contend that their jettisoning of the hammer and sickle emblem when they formed the Coalition in March 1989, and their alliance with the conservatives in June, were precursors of broader changes elsewhere. 
Pollster Panayote Drmitras expncts the Communists may be further damaged by a burgeon­ing environmentalist movement.

AIDS victim White holds steady 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -The stabilizing condition of Ryan White and a steady vigil by singer Elton John continued on Wednesday to bolster the spir­its of the AIDS victim's family, a spokeswoman said. 
Doctors said the 18-year-old White, whose 5-year battle against acquired immune defi­ciency syndrome has won him worldwide attention, was in critical condition suffering from a life-threatening respira­tory infection. 
But family spokeswoman Carrie Van Dyke said the spirits of family members at Hiley Hospital for Children have im­proved since worries surged Monday that the youth's death was imminent. 
She said White's mother,

Jeanne, and other family mem­bers have been staying with the patient round-the-clock. 
The fact that White condition hasn't deteriorated since then has helped, she said. 
"That in itself was sort of a relief and with Elton and every­thing it sort of brightened things up," Van Dyke said. 
John spent his second full day Wednesday at White's room at Hiley Hospital for Children, Van Dyke said. 
She said John does not intend to make any statements or meet with the media but" has been playing tapes of his music for Ryan and the family. 
"He's strictly here as a friend," Van Dyke said. "He goes in and talks to Ryan,holds his hand and changes his mu­sic." 

Dr. Martin Kleiman said Wednesday that White remains in critical condition, uncon­scious and heavily sedated so a life-support system would func­tion more efficiently. 
Van Dyke said John's fre­quent humorous jabs at news­paper articles and sports lig­ures and wry comments about the "junk food" he's been eat­ing were bolstering spirits. 
John befriended White as the youth was gaining prominence for his struggle in the early stages of the illness. Van Dyke said .John has called White on a weekly basis ever since. 
Thousands of well-wishers and celebrities touched by that battle have swamped the family with with messages or phone calls of support.

50 pound 'monster' turtles found in New York sewers

Sonw of tlw turtles rncovered from the Bronx and Manhattan plants have wnighnd 50 pounds or morn, according to Tina Casl~Y, a spokeswoman for the city's l>npartnwnt of Environ­nwntal l'rotnction. 
"Tiwy'rn big enough to dose­rious damage to any hoodlum," slw said, but not quite the size of tlw characters of the new hit movin, "Tnenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." 
Tlw last time any of the big snappers came out of a New York sewer was 1988, when two wnrn found, lean, mean and on sernnns intended to sirt tml~ limbs and other large objects from sewage, Casey said. Peri­odically, younger snapping tur­tles or other, smaller breeds are found. 
Workers at the Bronx semening station have kept a few of the greenish-brown rep­tiles around as pets, feeding them eold cuts and meatballs, she said.

Government tells 6.8 million secrets a year 
WASHINGTON (AP) -After seven years of trying, the gov­ernment thinks it finally has an accurate count of how many secrets it creates: 6.8 million a year. 
That's a 35 percent decrease from the previous count, but nearly all the drop came when. the Navy decided it really didn't originate more secrets than the rest of the government put to­gether. 
It's still just an estimate but it appears that the "top se­cret," "secret" and "confidential" stamps were wielded 6,796,501 times in the fiscal year which ended last Sept. 30. 
"It appears that this un­precedented drop is primarily the result of more accurate counting, rather than an actual tremendous decrease in classi­fication activity," said Steven Garfinkel, who has spent the past seven years trying to get the government to produce fewer secrets and count them more accurately. 
Garfinkel heads the Informa­tion Security Oversight Office, created in 1982 when then­President Reagan rewrote all the rules for classifying docu­ments. 
In his annual report to Presi­dent Bush, released Tuesday, Garfinkel praised the Navy for finally figuring out what he has been trying to count each year. 
The government doesn't ac­tually count its secrecy deci­sions each year. It samples the number of times some offices decide to classify information. Then it projects those numbers to reflect the number of deci­sions in all offices. 
Moreover, there are two kinds of secrets: original se­crets, of which 500,000 were produced last year, and deriva­tive secrets, of which 6.3 mil­lion were created. For example, an official creates an original secret by deciding that all pho­tographs from a spy satellite will be kept secret; another of-· ficial creates a derivative secret each time he stamps one of the photos "top secret." 
A derivative secret also is 
created when one official copies 
another official's original se­
cret into a new document -the 
government equivalent of the 
friend who says, "Don't tell so­
and-so, but I just learned that 
For 1987 and 1988, the Navy reported creating far more original secrets than the rest of the government combined. As Garfinkel put it in his report to Bush both the Defense De­partment and his office "expressed skepticism about the accuracy of these data." 
In 1989, the Navy learned what went wrong. Some of its sample offices were "reporting the number of all classified documents on hand, not just classification decisions that they had originated," Garfinkel said. 
Fixing that error knocked about 3.5 million off the num­ber of secrets created last year. 
Garfinkel said it didn't hurt that the Navy sampled seven times more offices than before, conducted its samples for al­most half a year and provided all sample offices with "extensive instructions and training." 
Of the four agencies -the Defense, State and Justice de­partments and the CIA -that create nearly 99 percent of the secrets, only Justice created more secrets in 1989 than 1988. Not only that, Justice re­ported significant increases in the number of over classified and mismatched documents. 
But Garfinkel said that was far from a failure at Justice. 
tie said the number of secrets rose because more FBI agents are assigned to catch spies and FBI field offices are keeping better records. The bureau cre­ates more than 90 percent of Justice's secrets. 
In addition, Garfinkel praised the· FBI for starting to review actual documents as well as surveying agents, which he said is how the bureau found the misclassified items. "That's a commendable effort to achieve better quality control," he said. 
Overall in 1989, Garfinkel said, "the strides were modest, but what's most important is we finally have the Defense De­partment count in the ball park. These numbers can pro­vide a benchmark to look at fu­ture activity."

SMC juniors selected for business fellowship 
By SUSAN MINAHAN 
Two Saint Mary's juniors were recently selected to partic­ipate in a fellowship program of summer study offered by the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. 
Amy Boss and Anne Brady, as Chicago Business Fellows, have been officially admitted into the Graduate School of Business and will reeeive credit toward their first academic quarter of study in the Master of Business Administration program at the University of Chicago, according to l'atrieia Sayre, assistant professor of philosophy at Saint Mary's. 
A full-tuition scholarship is provided for thn summer term running from mid-.Junn through the last week of August. Upon completion of their undergrad­uate study, Boss and Brady may reenter the Graduate School of Business and receive their MBA degrees. 
The Chicago Business Fellows will take two or three courses in areas such as microeco­nomics, managerial accounting, statistics, marketing, industrial relations, and behavioral science, Sayre said. They will also partieipate in a number of informational workshops and seminars, meet Chicago busi­ness leaders, and make fre­quent visits to corporations in their field of interest. 
The program gives the stu­dents the opportunity to iden­tify career possibilities and set eareer goals while by-passing GMATs and guaranteeing ad­mission into one of the nation's top business programs, Sayre said.

To emphasize the importance of the talks, President Bush met Wednesday with Nobuo Mat­sunaga. a former ambassador to the United States, and Deputy Foreign Minister llisashi Owada, personal emis­saries from .Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. 
Both sides have a lot riding on the outcome of the current negotiations. 
Chicago business firms hire fel­lows after graduation from college and often sponsor stu­dents through the remainder.of 
the MBA program, she said. These firms include Arthur An­derson & Co., General Mills, Inc., Hewitt Associates, Inter­national Business Machines Corp., Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Peat Marwick Main Co. to name just a few. 
The University of Chicago supplies selection criteria to established committees on each campus of participating schools. According to qualifica­tions listed in a brochure by the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, fellows are chosen on the basis of "exceptional academic, leader­ship, and communication skills," and "strong commit-

Pro-choicers are not pro-abortion 
By Alicia Sierra and 
Amy Eckert 
The abortion issue is a matter of individual and personal choice. As reproductive rights advocates, we believe in the right of a woman to make a re­sponsible decision according to her own moral conscience. 
Many Pro-Life advocates de­termine the morality of abor­tion based on the circumstances of the pregnancy. The recently vetoed Idaho abortion bill, which was drafted by National Right to Life, demonstrates this conditional approach to the abortion issue. Under this bill, abortion would have been illegal except in case of non­statutory rape reported within seven days, incest if the vic~im is under eighteen, severe fetal deformity or a threat to a woman's life or health. 
These are complicated and contradictory ethical lines which are being drawn for women. Working from the so­called "truth" that life begins at conception, National Right to Life has placed more value on certain kinds of life. Certainly, these guidelines do not adhere to the "universal truth" that abortion is murder. In fact, it is contrary to that very moral truth the Pro-Life movement claims to own, placing the exis­tence of any such truth into se­rious doubt. 
By making these complex ethical decisions, the Pro-Life movement devalues women as moral agents. By refraining from imposing moral decisions. the Pro-Choice movement ac­knowledges each woman's ability to draw her own ethical lines. 
Traditionally, the Left sup­ports the rights of the power­less. In protecting reproductive rights, we protect the right of a woman to make a personal

. moral decision. Women must be able to decide for themselves if and when an abortion is a moral option. 

Some Pro-Lifers would claim that the fettis is oppressed by abortion rights and that the Left has sold out its commit­ment to the oppressed by advo­cating these rights. We believe, however, that women must be able to make their own per­sonal, moral decisions and that any woman who is denied the right to make this choice is in­deed oppressed and powerless. 
Pro-Choice does not mean pro-abortion. The Pro-Choice movement stands for reproduc­tive rights freedom. This in­cludes not only the right to a safe, legal abortion, but also the right to prevent pregnancy, or to have a child. Indeed, all women should have equal ac­cess to sex education and birth control. Just as important are pre-and post-natal care, paid parental leave and child care. Reproductive freedom will not truly exist until all these provi­sions are equally available to all women. 
Unlike Pro-Life advocates. Pro-Choice supporters do not pretend to have an answer to a theological question upon which the religious community as a whole has yet to reach a consensus. The Pro-Life move­ment claims to have a monopoly on truth. The Pro-Choice movement denies the ex­istence of any such truth. 
Once again, we insist on the right of each woman to decide according to her own moral conscience. As Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion Rights Action League, says: "The central question in the abortion debate is: Who de­cides? Americans have an­swered: The intensely personal and moral decisions about abortion must be left to women and their families." 
We believe in a woman's right and ability to choose for herself. We favor the right to make a personal moral decision over the imposition of a sup­posed universal truth.

Sensual lambada invades South Bend 

THERESA LOOMIS accent writer 
A Latin beat lilled Washing­ton Hall and the crowd eat­railed as a clinging human chain slunk onto tlw stage. First the left feel, then tlw right. But always the hips. As an accordion took tlw nwlody, the rhain separated itself into eouph~s and lambada d11butnd at Notre Damn. 
The provocative dance JWr­fomwd at the 1990 lntnrnal.ional Studnnt Organization f1~stival in narly FPbruary has quickly travnlnd a long way from its nativn nortlwastPrn Brazil. In thn past fpw wnnks it has empt into "Nnwswnnk," "Mcl.nan 's," "USA Today." tlw "Wall Strent .Journal." thn "Nnw York Timns," and evnn thn Christian Sd1•nen Monitor." A charactnr on NBC's prinw time sit-com "A lli!Tnrnnt World," rnfnrrnd to it as tlw nnw dane1~ crazn that's "swnnping tho nation." 
llailnd as the nnw "safe sex." it has giVPn birth to a wavn of dPsignatPd lambada eompnti­tion nights in dubs across thn country. Contnst winners in Dallas can walk away with $500. Last month, New York City's Palladium nntin~d a mrord crowd to its lambada night. 
Susan Finn, a Notre Damn senior and one of thn lambada J>Prforrners, first nneountnred a sistnr dance, tho forro, last summer while working in 
Brazil. She quickly discovewd 
that lambada was a necessary social skill in night dubs 
throughout Brazil's northeast­ern Salvador region. 
Pedro Baleen>. a Notrn Dame graduate student from Brazil, eonlirms this. In a country of 12 million people, Tuesday through Sunday 500,000 people go to discos every night. "Lambada really is the most famous dam~n." he says. 
The dance. in which the man places his leg between both legs of his partner, while gyrating their hips in unison. has shocked some Americans. As a result, the ISO troupe had to adjust their choreography for the Notre Damn debut. Balcero says the forro is even more s1msual. "If they IAmnricansl an~ amazed at this. they'd be rnally amazed at the forro." Finn agrees, though, that lam­bada is at first a strange sen­sation for an American to ex­perience. 
Northeastern Brazilians. she points out. "an~ more comfort­able with their bodies. Lambada is an expression of their sensual nature. It has no dirty connotations. Husbands and wives do it. Everyone does it. Little girls know it from the minute they walk. The maid where we lived ran a tape all morning from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. They've got the rhythm in their heads." 
It seems that Americans will 

J. Eddie Peck and Melora Hardin in "Lambada," demonstrate the erotic Latino dance, which has swept the nation. 
soon have the salsaesque rhythm in their heads too. Promoters have put together a band, Kaoma, which is touring the United States with its "World Beat" album and ap­pearing on late-night television such as the "Arsenio Hall" show. The music is a unique blend of Latin and Afro­Caribbean styles with a nearly irresistible bongo background. Although only able to tempt a few couples to the dance floor when first played at Senior Bar. it now fills the floor and is oc­casionally requested. 
Finn says lambada is a good way to meet people. She adds. "My morn thinks I should go to a dance studio and offer to teach. but I don't think it's go­ing to catch on in South Bend. There really aren't any chic dance places where it can be passed off." 
According to Baleen>. Brazilians are surprised the dance has made it this far. Many claim it's of African ori­gin. Finn says, "In order to un­derstand the history of the dance you have to understand the development of the region." Salvador was Brazil's main slave-importing region until 1920. Regional dance and reli­gion reflect the African influ­ence. 
Lambada has been confined strictly to northeastern Brazil until recently because the upper class regarded it as im­proper. Former President Quadros went so far as to ban lambada in the fifties, but it never died. It took firm hold in the northern cities of Recife and Salvador, and three years ago made its way to Sao Paulo. Due to regional rivalry, Rio de Janeiro was slower to accept the dance after it had become popular in Sao Paulo. 
Balcero tells a slightly differ­
-

ent story of lambada's origin. He claims forro's origin has in­correctly been attributed to lambada as well. Lambada, he asserts, began as a dance per­formed by fishermen after their day's work. "Lambada" which means "to whip" in Portuguese, came from the movements the fishermen made when removing fish from their nets. 
Hegardless of its origin, French record producers thought lambada was mar­ketable when they saw it in Brazil during 19H8. Although prnsently banned in Peru, it has spread to Paris, Home, Madrid, and South Bnnd. Balcero says, "It's funny to us that people an~ so·shocked. Brazilians don't see it !lambada! that way. It's normal. I have a cultural and national pride in it." 
Finn thinks lambada is a passing American fad. "People aren't willing to learn it be­cause it's hard to learn and there aren't enough people who know how to do it. I don't think America is ready for lambada." 
South Bend will have a chance to see if it's ready. The ISO festival, lambada included, will be performed again for the civic community Saturday, April 7 at 7:30p.m. in the Bendix Theater of the Century Center. Tickets are $5 for adults and $3 for students, available at the Century Cenhlr Box Office or the Lafortune Student Center. 
Misfits in Disguise give off beat performance 
LIZ HAVEL accent writer 

Tlw Mislits in Disgust, a comedy improv company mado up of Notn~ Dame and Saint Mary's studonts, hits th1~ stage of Washington flail tonight at H:30. The company will pnrl'orm a high energy snrios of 22 skits minglnd with surpriso video dips and familiar hit tunes. 
Tlw skits indudo straight improv numbors that dopPnd on audim1cn participation, such as "Biuns lmprov," in which tlw audience is ask1~d to providn the subjoet that the pnrfornwrs will sing about. 
Thn other skits are basnd on loosely writtnn scripts. Tho pnrformors arn not limitod by set routinns, so tlwir pnrfor­numees vary according to the inputs and fnPlings of the audinnce and the pnrformers. 
Intersp1~rsnd among these skits are video dips. which will indud1~ vintage school houso rock mat1~rial and brief comic asides. For instance, pnrformors throw out qtwstions such as, "So why do nylons come in eggs'?" 
Many of the skits are satirical portrayals of modern day fears. The pPrformers don't want to point ling~~rs at any particular group; rather, they would lik1~ to dispel the myths building up rwgative slenwlypes. For instance, tlwir song/skit "People of the Villagp" pokes fun at the overblown apprehensions surrounding homosexuality. The Misfits an~ made up of a strange and diverse assembly of up a lung.

The Misfits also include Brian Maggio an ND senior who claims to have been raised by the Dalai Lama, Brian McMafferty a first year ND law student who's grnatP.st aspiration in life is to be head groundskecper at the Bush­Wood Country Club, and Karl Rohling an ND senior known not for the fact that he likes to dress in drag, but that he looks good in it. 
Finally, the group is rounded out by its founder, creator, and producer (who also ·­washes their clotlH~s) Brad Perry. Brad's idols include Arsenio I Jail, and. under the influence of Brian Maggio, he has fostered the desin~ to become the next Dalai Lama. 
This distinct assembly of personalities is performing tonight for a worthy cause. The profits raised from ticket and tee shirt sales will benefit homeless groups in the South ­Bend area. Unlike shelters, these groups offer food and companionship to the homeless who live on the streets.

Simmons, who averaged 26.5 points, 11.1 rebounds, 4.2 as­sists and 2.0 blocked shots per game. was named The Associated Press Player of the Year last week with Payton second, Coleman third and Gathers fourth. 
Simmons led La Salle to a 30­2 record, the best in the coun­try, and its first appearance in the second round of the NCAA Tournament since 1955, when the Explorers lost the title game in a bid to repeat as champion. 
He had 3,217 points during his four-year career, a figure bettered by only two NCAA Division I players -Louisiana State's Pete Maravich, who fin­ished with 3,667 points, and

"This is the most prestigious award I've won," Simmons said during ceremonies at the Los Angeles Athletic Club, which sponsors the award. "It's really an honor. I feel very pleased. I credit my teammates and coaching staff for working with me all year. 
"This means a lot to me, my family and the people at La Salle. I don't see how they (the voters) can decide on who they're going to select. There . were some outstanding players nominated. For me to be se­lected has me puzzled. I'm glad I didn't have to vote. 
"I think the bottom line is we're all good players and I was fortunate enough to be singled out." 
La Salle coach Speedy Morris said there wasn't any question in his mind as to who deserved the award, named for the former UCLA coach who retired in 1975 after coaching the Bruins to 10 NCAA champi­onships in a 12-year span. 
"I think the best thing to say about Lionel is he got better ev­ery year," Morris said. "And he played in such a classy way. I could go on and on about his accomplishments on the court.

Douglas trying to sue out of King agreement 
LAS VEGAS (AP) -A new trial date of April 23 was set on Wednesday in heavyweight champion Buster Douglas' suit seeking to break his contract with promoter Don King. 
U.S. District Judge Howard McKibben set the date after at­torneys for King and Donald Trump agreed to put on hold a scheduled April 16 federal trial on suits they filed in New York. 
However, a federal judge in New York later threw out Trump's suit. In a written rul­ing, Judge Robert Sweet dis­missed the lawsuit by Trump, finding the court did not have 
jurisdiction  because  Trump  
Plaza  Associates  is  a  New  
Jersey company.  

He declined a motion by Douglas' lawyers to dismiss King's lawsuit or to move the case to federal court in Las Vegas. 
McKibben had earlier set a 
"He's such a fine young man. lie turned down an opportunity to go pro last year and will gnt his degree on time in criminal justice. We at La Salle University and in Philadelphia are extn~mely proud of our All­American." 
Morris said without question Simmons is the best player he's ever coached. 
"I don't think there's any onn thing he docs spectacularly. but he does everything very well,"

Douglas and The Mirage ho­tel-casino are suing King in an effort to break his claim on the rights to promote Douglas' de­fenses of the heavyweight title he won by knocking Mike Tyson out in February in Japan. 
Douglas has agreed on a $60 million two-fight deal with Mirage operator Steve Wynn, but the fights are contingent on Douglas winning the suit and being free to fight at the resort. 
Under terms of the pact, Douglas will get $25 million to defend the title against No. 1 contender Evander Holyfield in September. Should he win that fight, he will receive another $35 million for a rematch with Tyson. 
Morris said. "He'll certainly improve at everything.

HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) -Top-seeded Martina Navratilova eased into the quarterfinals of the Family Circle Magazine Cup on Wednesday while 14-year-old Jennifer Capriati continued her winning ways with an easy sec­ond-round victory. 
Navratilova, ranked No. 2 in the world, trailed 3-1 in the first set before rallying to beat Isabel Cueto 6-3, 6-2, becoming the first player to earn a spot in the quarterfinals. 
Capriati, who is not seeded and has not played in enough tournaments to receive a world ranking, defeated Angeliki Kanellopoulou, ranked 77th in the world, 6-1, 6-3 to run her record as a pro to 10-2. 
Second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and No. 5 Katerina Maleeva both ad­vanced to the third round with straight set victories. 
Cueto, a native of Spain who was seeded 12th, was the only seeded player to lose Wednesday. 
But Cueto played well in the early going against Navratilova, a three-time Family Circle winner. Cueto, ranked 31st in the world, broke Navratilova in the third game of the first set and then held serve to go up 3-1. 
Navratilova came back to win five straight games, fighting off two break points in the seventh game and another in the final game of the set, which she won with a half-volley at the net. 
Navratilova won the first four games of the second set, breaking Cueto at love in the first game. She then used a jumping overhead cross-court shot at the net to earn another

break  in  the  third  game.  
Navratilova  won  the  match  
with a service winner.  

"She puts a lot of topspin on the ball, and I was not quite getting my racket up to the ball on the high balls," Navratilova said. "I don't see that much topspin that often. I got used to it a little better and started hitting a little firmer shots." 
Navratilova said that had she faced the same circumstances a year ago she might have lost. 
"It's still a struggle for me to play on clay. But my head is much, much better," she said. "I could have gotten very tenta­tive and just played it safe and could have easily lost the match if I had kept playing the same way I did the first four or five games. 
"But I was able to make my­self go for the shots and really think about what I'm doing on the court. Last year, if I was down 3-1, I would have been thinking about quiting playing tennis. That's where my head was then. I would have been thinking, maybe I am too old. Or at least what am I doing here on clay? 
"Today I was thinking, 'What do I need to do to get back into the match?'" she said~ 
Earlier, Sanchez-Vicario of Spain beat Mary Lou Daniels 6­2, 6-2. Sanchez-Vicario, ranked fifth in the world and seeded second, broke Daniels, ranked No. 101, the first two times she served and won the first set on a drop shot. 
Sanchez-Vicario, who won the French Open last year, broke Daniels at love to start the sec­ond set and later won the match with a forehand winner at the net. 
The victory was the second in a week for Sanchez-Vicario over Daniels, who won 7-5, 6-2 in the quarterfinals last week in Houston. 
Capriati, of Wesley Chapel, Fla., took just 55 minutes to beat her Greek foe, who was playing in her first tournament since November. She will play Sanchez-Vicario in the third round on Thursday. 
Capriati, who advanced to the finals of her first pro tourna­ment in March, gave up just five points in the first five games of the first set before Kanellopoulou finally held serve. 
The second set was more of the same. Capriati broke Kanellopoulou at love in the first and third games en route

Funderburke to take sum mer Classes at IU 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) ­Lawrence Funderburke may re­turn to Indiana University this sumnwr. but only to fulfill the academic requirements in the lettN of intent he signed with the Hoosiers, his attorney said in a published report. 
The talented forward left Coach Bob Knight's basketball program in Deenmber and joined a Kentucky junior col-
leg«~. 
Attorney William Fleck said Tuesday he has advised Funderburke to take nine credit hours this summer to allow him to he released from the na­lional lettnr of intent. 
"I'm not saying that is an ab­solutl~." Finck told The Indiana Daily Student in a copyright story published Wednesday. "That's one of tlw courses that have been rncommnnded to Mr. Fundnrburkn." 
Funderburke left Indiana for St. Catharine College, a junior college in Springfield, Ky., say­ing hn was unhappy with Knight's controll1~d offense. Indiana refused to release him from his letter of intent. 
Finck originally was looking into a lawsuit against thn uni­vnrsity to fren Funderburke from thn lettnr, but hn advised tlw playnr to take summer rlassns. FundNburkn narnnd 15 credit hours at Indiana in thn fall, leaving him ninn short of the 24 hours required by the NCM. 
Until Funderburke can secure his release, any school inter­ested in him cannot contact him. Instead, he has to contact the school himself. By complet­ing 24 credit hours at Indiana, Funderburke would negate the lettor and Indiana's power to bind him to it. That would allow him to transfer, sit out next year and still have three years of eligibility remaining. 
St. Catharine coach Jack Pack said Funderburke told him Tuesday that he has applied to Indiana for financial aid for the 
summer. 
"As far as I know, his inten­tions are to go to Indiana this summer," Pack told the campus newspaper. 
But Park said Funderburke "has no intention of going to Indiana to play basketball and enroll there in the fall." 
lie also refuted a report by an Indianapolis television sta­tion that Funderburke and his mother had met with Knight. 
"lie said he had not spoken with Coach Knight at all," Pack said. 
"When he comes into your program and rubs your whole chemistry in basketball practice and in school, he lies to you, then I fenl like those chances arn used up."

(AP) -Don Mattingly's agent said Wednesday he's hopeful about negotiating a contract extension for the New York Yankees first baseman before the start of the season. 
"We're moving in the right direction," Jim Krivacs said after meeting witth Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. "We've exchanged all our thoughts now, the ground­work's been established. Now all we can do is try hard to get this thing done. Even if we have to work around the clock, we'll do it." 
Mattingly, eligible for free agency after the 1990 season, will make $2.5 million in the final season of a three-year, $6.7 million contract. Early in camp, he said he was seeking a five-year deal with "Will Clark-type numbers." Clark, the San Francisco Giants first baseman, signed a four-year contract this winter worth $15 million. 
Krivacs and Steinbrenner' 
who sat together during 
Wednesday's exhibition game 
against the Atlanta Braves, 
are scheduled to meet again 
Friday. 
"We'll know a lot more after 
Friday," Krivacs said. 
Mattingly, Krivacs, and 
Steinbrenner met for two 
hours Tuesday night to dis­
cuss the contract and the 
state of the Yankees. 
"I don't want to sound too 
optimistic but it was a positive 
step," Mattingly said. "It was contract, but we spoke mostly about the team. I suggested things that I thought wo~ld make us a better club. I m glad that (Steinbrenner) heard me out." 
But less than 12 hours ear­lier, Mattingly appeared angry with Steinbrenner and the stalled talks, saying he "didn't

to ~ake a deal before the sea­son s start. 
"They're still talking, and that's a good sign," Mattingly said, referring to the talks be­tween Krivacs and Steinbrenner. "But there's no reason for me to go anymore. I said what was on my mind."

Bookstore records first shutout of spring 
By GREG GUFFEY 
Sports Editor 
On a day that featured sev­eral close games, the biggest story was the first shutout of the spring. 
Digger's NIT Express blanked Dam Slunkers 21-0 as Bookstore Basketball XIX con­tinued Wednesday afternoon. 
Dam Slunkers missed all nine of its shots. while Digger's NIT Express hit 21-of-27 field goals in advancing to the second round. Mike Hartmann led the winners with seven points. 
"It wasn't something we were thinking about," Hartmann said of the shutout. "It just happened. Toward the end of the game, we just wanted to get the final points." 
"We didn't realize the score on the court because we got caught up in the game," said Kyle Garlitz, another member of Digger's NIT Express. "They had several chances to score, but just didn't get it in." 
Action will continue today with 40 games on 10 courts be­ginning at 4 p.m. The field will be reduced to 512 teams by early next week. 
Four games went into over­time Tuesday, highlighted by Third and Short's 27-25 marathon win over Depression of a Lifestyle. Scott Hardek scored 12 points for the win­ners. 
Lindsay Knapp scored 12 hoops to lead Reckless Abandon past Excuse Me, Pardon Me, Let Me Dribble 23­
21.The winners started the game with just four players, fell behind 7-1 early in the contest and then battled back when their fifth man arrived to get the victory. 
"They were beating us most of the game," Knapp said. "When we got our fifth guy there, that helped out a lot." 
0 For 3 But We Still Have Our Health finally got a victory with a 22-20 win over We Dare You To Score On Us. Marty Hull led 0 For 3 with nine points. That team, composed of five seniors, won for the first time in four years of Bookstore competition.

Mirer's elbow caught the helmet of defensive tackle Bob Dahl during his fol­lowthrough, sending the foot­ball spiralling upward where 
it l~nded safely in. the arms of spht end Tony Smith.

hit a looper to first base, where Verhey made the catch and then stepped on the bag to force out Alvarez, who was caught off base. Next, with two out and runners on second and third, second baseman Laurie Sommerlad flew out to left field to end the Irish threat. 
"That double play really took us out of it," Boulac said. "To get the bases loaded and not get runs was disappointing."

Among the players getting a look were safety Pat Terrell, fullback Anthony Johnson, quarterback Tony Rice, defensive tackle Jeff Aim, cornerback Stan Smagala, safety D'Juan Francisco, tackle Dean Brown, guard Tim Grunhard and linebacker Ned Bolcar. 
Jimmy Johnson was joined by NFL coaches and scouts representing the Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, Atlanta Falcons, New Jork 
Football Notebook Jets, Cleveland ~rowns and San Diego Chargers. 
"I got hit right on the elbow and had some numb­ness in my hand at first," said Mirer. "It swelled up a little bit, but I've just got to keep some ice on it and I'll be ready for the scrimmage on Friday." 
Mirer was able to throw the ball around on the sidelines later in the practice. 
A familiar, albeit unpopular face to Irish football fans showed up at the Loftus Center last Wednesday.

The former Insh players were tested in the 40­yard dash, vertical jump and other tests similar to those employed in the NFL scouting combines. 
Lance Johnson filled in at first-team center on Wednesday. Jim Kinsherf, normally the backup to starter Gene McGuire, was sidelined with an ice bag on his right shoulder. McGuire was not at practice, presumably due to a previous commitment. 
Sophomore split end William Pollard made a spectacular catch during Wednesday's practice, leaping high along the right sideline to pull in a pass do with it. My tl~ammates made some good plays; they n~ally help me out a lot when I get into tough situations." 
The Irish will now begin a dif­ficult road trip. They will travel to Butler for a doubleheader at 3 p.m. today, to Saint Louis for two games tomorrow and to Joliet for four weekend games

"I'd like to  come  out of this  

trip with a winning record," said Boulac, whose team is cur­rently is 10-9. "I think we're going to play n~ally well. 
"Butler is a tough team. They've got good, solid pitch­ing, but if we can hit better, we'll be all right. Saint Louis is a much improved team this year, and that's a game we'll look forward to." 
But the real test this weekend will come against Valparaiso, a team that twic1~ beat the Irish by 4-3 scores at Valparaiso earlier in the year.

the win for the Aces as she scattered three hits and walked two. Linn only allowed one run in the loss, lowering her ERA to 1.86. 
Four Irish batters had hits in the second inning of the night­cap as Vernetti, Alvarez, Kmak and Sommerlad all scored. Junior designated player Hache! Crossen delivered the big blow of the inning, a double to left that scored Kmak and 
Sommerlad  and  pushed  the  
score to 4-0.  
The  four  runs  were  more  

than enough cushion for Alford, who allowed only four hits as she improved her record to 5-4 and her EHA to 1.81. Alford benefited from some outstanding defensive plays in the field, particularly in the fourth inning, when first base­man Vernetti snared a hot line drive for the first out and right fielder Megan Pay made a slid­ing catch for the second. 
"I got really lucky today," said Alford. "Luck has a lot to 
from Mirer before being knocked out of bounds by walk-on cornerback Chet Hollister. ~ 
Walk-on cornerback Jerry Bodine later picked off a deflected pass and sprinted untouched down the sideline for a defensive score. 
The Irish will pay special attention to the kicking game Friday before its second scrimmage of the spring. The kicking game also received work prior 
to last Sunday's scrimmage, but it did not merit at­
tention at Tuesday's practice as originally sched­
uled. Instead, the team spent extra time watching 
films and working in the weight room. 
Notre Dame will scrimmage for the second time this spring on Friday, following a brief rest on Thursday. The team will break again on Saturday before resuming practice Sunday afternoon.
