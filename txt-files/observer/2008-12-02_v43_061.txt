Reish to use survey results as guide 
Many students identify off-campus safety as a concern, but say they feel safe on-campus 

By JOSEPH McMAHON Assistant News Editor 
The results from last month's student survey, which was taken by 3,658 students, will help guide future student gov­ernment initiatives and influ­ence the final months of his administration, student body president Bob Reish said. 
"I think this information will be very valuable both in the different initiatives our office decides to pursue as well as helping provide hard numbers in support of some of these ini­tiatives to both the faculty and administrative offices on cam­pus," he said. 
Reish said there was "no sin­gular, pressing issue" that arose from the survey results, but said safety off-campus was a major concern for many stu­dents. While 94.6 percent of students said they felt safe walking around campus at night, 78.9 percent of students said they did not feel safe walking off-campus at night. 
Reish said 89 percent of women feel unsafe off campus at night, compared to 67 per­cent of men. More upperclass­men said they felt unsafe off campus than underclassmen, he fjaid. 
Reish said student govern­ment would respond to these concerns with several initia­tives, including a winter break safety forum "where students will find out how to help keep their off-campus apartment or house safe as well as be able to sign up for an off-campus safe-

TCEs n1ove to Internet

Notre Dame will be imple­menting a new system to evaluate professors and courses at the end of this semester, according to the Course Instructor Feedback Web site. 
Course Instructor Feedbacks, nicknamed CIFs, will replace Teacher Course Evaluations (TCEs) this semester. According to Gunty, the new system will be completely online, so stu­dents will have a longer time to fill out the evaluations.

Irish fans disappointed, en1barrassed by USC loss 
Students cite Marching Band's halftime show as highlight of game; Notre Dame falls 76-3 in two years to Trojans 

By LIZ HARTER and KATIE

News Writers 
Notre Dame students who traveled out to the University of Southern California this week­end were hoping for a miracle -but instead they got a mas­sacre, watching the Irish fall 38-3 at the Coliseum. 
Waiting until only seconds left in the third quarter for the Irish's first first down, students were disappointed in the last game of the regular season. 
"I was disappointed overall," said Saint Mary's senior Allison Buddie, a member of the Band of the Fighting Irish. "Our defense was able to keep it close through the first quarter which gave me a lot of hope, but then the offense was unable to come up with even a first down until the third quarter." 

Senior George Packer said he was not only disappointed in the loss, but embarrassed. 
"It's embarrassing. We have lost 76-3 to USC the past two years. Father Jenkins only gave Ty Willingham three years. Why should Charlie [Weis] get more than four?" Packer said. 
"It sucks that we fell apart right at the end [of the sea­son]," Buddie said. "But I think Weis will stay another year ... too much money and overall improvements have been made to have Weis leave now."

INSIDE COLUMN 

U111brellas in the snovv 
I don't think anyone is a fan of the 

snow that fell on campus on Monday. 
It doesn't settle on the ground in aes­

thetically pleasing drifts. It just kind of 
meekly melts on the sidewalks or feebly 
tries to cover the grass on the quad. It's 
either hard and stinging or wet and 
slushy-not that 
big, feathery kind 
that elicits visions Jordan Gamble 
of idyllic Christmas 
cards. 
Having Christmas Scene Writer 

card snow fall on 
your bare head is 
cool, because it settles all angelically 
and stuff. But the kind of snowfall we 
had yesterday? I'd much prefer to keep 
it off my hair, face and clothing, thank 
you. I don't relish being wet and cold 
once it all melts when I go inside ­
especially when outside. Notre Dame is 
going to be some degree of both for the 
next four months. 
To protect against the undesirable 

snow, some people wear hats, others 
hoods, others are just tough and zip up 
their jackets and saunter through the 
elements. But me, I use an umbrella. 
I know, I know. An umbrella in the 

snow'! Who does that? 
One my friends, a native Californian 

who had never seen snow before com­
ing to South Rend, had the same ques­
tion freshman year. Some people told 
her it was nerdy, that you'd definitely 
stick out as a newbie to winter weather 
if you were seen with an umbrella in 
snowfall. 
I told her what I saw as the most 

rational approach: If it works for rain, 
why not just use it for crystalline water 
ice? 
Needless to say, I was the only person 

who had such an argument. 
Maybe the novelty of walking through 

such precipitation discourages most 
from using umbrellas. Maybe they relish 
the light, white, fluffy, swirling good­
ness in a way that I cannot, seeing as 
how I have grown up in the crazy 
weather of Indiana and have had quite 
enough of "wintry mix" to fill up my 
novelty quota. 
And, if you have trouble remembering 
to grab an umbrella even when it's rain­
ing, the distraction of aforementioned 
swirling goodness will even further 
deter you from using one when its 
snowing. 
So, in defense of snow umbrellas: 
They keep you dry (at least your head 
and shoulders). All those layers ofT­
shirt, sweatshirt, fleece jacket, parka, 
scarf, ski mask, sock hat and earmuffs 
will not be for naught. Seriously, if they 
get wet, they are useless. 
And, if you choose to go hatless, prob­
ably in an effort to retain some sign of 
hygienic attention to your hair, the 
snow will do your painstakingly styled 
coif no favors. Sure, it looks all angelic 
and stuff outside, but once you go into a 
heated building'! Not so much. 
Most importantly, umbrellas often come in bright, cheery colors, which stand out nicely against the (a) pristine white blanket of snow, or (b) the brutal, churning mess of slush and mud. Either way, the umbrella wins. No one will be able to resist the quirky charm of a bright red umbrella on the frozen tun­dra of South Quad.

Man says God told him to crash into car 
SAN ANTONIO -A man who rammed his truck into a woman's vehicle on a highway early Friday told author­ities he crashed into her while going more than 100 mph because God told him "she needed to be taken off the road." 
The truck rear-ended the car on U.S. Highway 2 81, both vehicles spun across a median then came to a stop along a barrier in the opposite lanes. Both drivers suf­fered only minor injuries.

Deer attacks hunter who shot him 
SEDALIA, Mo. -A hunter bagged a big buck on the second day of firearms season, but the kill caused him a lot of pain. Randy Goodman, 49, said he thought two well-placed shots with his .270-cal­
iber rifle had killed the buck on Nov. 19. Goodman said the deer looked dead to him, but seconds later the nine­point, 240-pound animal came to life. 
The buck rose up, knocked Goodman down and attacked him with his antlers in what the veteran hunter called "15 seconds of hell." The deer ran a short dis­tance and went down, and died after Goodman fired two more shots.

Dance Marathon hosts purse party for charity 
By ALICIA SMITH News Wrirer 
Saint Mary's students gath­ered in the basement of the College's student center Monday to purchase designer handbags and accessories for a good cause. 
"We are hosting the event to raise money and awareness. It also brings something fun to 
Saint  Mary's,"  said  senior  
Sarah  Voss.  the  Dance  
Marathon president.  

Over 150 bags were brought to Saint Mary's for the event. Brands like Coach, Kate Spade, Prada and many other design­er bags filled three tables. Along with the designer purs­es, designer sunglasses, wal­lets, jewelry, headbands and scarves were available to be purchased at discounted prices. 
Saint Mary's freshman Hanna Vicary attended the event. 
"It's supporting a good cause and I want to get involved with Dance Marathon. It's a fun fundraiser. A Jot of times it is like they are selling cookies or candles. This is something that I think more people can get involved with." she said. 
Sophomore Mary Castle also shopped at the purse party. 
"I knew all the money went to a good cause, and that's really important to me. I also need to do some Christmas shopping. I got a lot of girls on my list and I think they'll like these purses." 
Students paid a dollar entrance fee to the event. A portion of the profits from the items sold will benefit Riley Children's Hospital. 
"The proceeds will go towards Dance Marathon and the final donation will go towards Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis," Voss said. 
Dance Marathon has hosted several events this fall, and is planning on hosting many more in the future, closing with the Dance Marathon. 
"We'll be having a lot of events next semester, so we are really excited," she said. Saint Mary's junior Kelly Deranek, the vice president of publicity for Dance Marathon, Kelly Deranek said they were planning another purse party next semester. 
"The money goes to the gen­eral benefit fund at Riley which helps the area of the hospital that has the most need. It changes from year to year what our donation directly benefits," Voss said. 
"I think it's an incredible cause," Castle said. "The Riley Children's Hospital is a really important institute and I think it's wonderful what they are doing. I am glad I get to partic­ipate."

Profs return to grad school 
Scholarship program lets faculty study Catholic intellectual tradition 
Special to The Observer 
University of Notre Dame economists Richard Jensen and Kasey Buckles went back to graduate school last year. 
Both had the chance to par­ticipate in an Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts (ISLA) program that allows Notre Dame faculty members course-release time for study of the Catholic intellectual tra­dition. 
Jensen and Buckles are two of seven participants in the program since its inception two years ago, says Ken Garcia, associate director of ISLA. 
"The program is designed to., make faculty members famil­iar with the Catholic tradition and how they might incorpo­rate relevant aspects of Catholic teaching into their coursework," he explained. 
The program is open to both Catholic and non-Catholic fac­ulty members from any college or school in the University, excluding the theology depart­ment. It allows faculty to be released from one course to allow time for study, and offers a $7,500 stipend to the depart­ment to provide for their replacement. 
Rather than taking a formal graduate seminar. both Buckles and Jensen worked on independent reading and research with members of the theology faculty. 

Jensen, department chair and professor of economics and econometrics, is interested in environmental economics­what would people be willing to pay to preserve the rain for­est, for example. Part of the reason for his taking the course, he says, was to better understand how the environ­ment figures into Catholic social teaching. 
Jensen worked with Matthew Ashley, associate pro­fessor of systematic theology. 
"I read all the papal encycli­cals, and just kept reading from there," Jensen says. "I also read [Notre Dame theolo­gian] Dick McBrien's 1,200­page tome 'Catholicism.' I became curious about what it means to be Catholic, as well as what it means to pursue the Catholic intellectual tradition." 
The pope, he notes, has begun directly addressing environmental concerns. 
"He points out that in Genesis, when man inherits the earth, it doesn't mean he inherits the earth and wastes the resources," Jensen said. "John Paul II specifically argues that we have to be good stewards of the environ­Jnent." 
For Jensen. one of the most interesting aspects of his stud­ies was that he learned a great deal about what the popes actually said -as opposed to what people think they said. 
Buckles, assistant professor of economics and economet­rics, worked through a series of readings with moral theolo­gian Todd Whitmore, associate professor of theology and director of the Program in Catholic Social Tradition, beginning with Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical Rerum Novarum and moving forward through documents on the role of women in the Church. It was interesting, she notes, to see how the Church's teach­ings have evolved over the last 30 years. 
Her studies also have had the interesting result of mak­ing her -in many cases ­more educated about Catholic social teaching than her stu­dents who were raised in the faith. They may know the prin­ciples, but have never read the actual documents. 
What she's gained from the program is a better under­standing of her students and what they know about Church teachings. 
"It's up to me to make sure my students understand that economic models aren't incon­sistent with Catholic social teaching," she said. "Having had this class, I feel much more prepared to do that." 
"I think [the program] was quite valuable," Jensen says. "I don't have the same kind of understanding I'd have if I'd been raised Catholic, but I have a much better under­standing."

PARIS -France's glamorous first lady threw her considerable star power behind the global fight against AIDS on Monday, as the world tallied the victims of the HIV virus that infects a new person every 15 seconds. 
As ceremonies marked World AIDS Day, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy signed on to become a goodwill ambassador for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which said it has provided life­saving treatment to two million people liv­ing with IIIV worldwide. 
"I think the world has become used to AIDS." the model-turned-singer told a news conference in Paris. "We no longer see it as a scandal or an emergency." 
Thai leader avoids capital amidst crisis 
BANGKOK. Thailand -Thailand's prime minister stayed away from the capital Monday, unable to quell a political crisis that has paralyzed his government for weeks and shut down the city's two main airports and stranded 300,000 foreigners. 
Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat has refused to send in police to evict protesters besieging the airports or occupying his office complex for fear of bloodshed, instead mak­ing weak pleas for them to go home. The demonstrators vow to stay until Somchai resigns; he has refused. 
The monthslong crisis has drained millions of dollars from the economy and is worsen­ing divisions in Thailand. 
Late Monday, an explosion hit protesters camped outside Bangkok's airport for domestic flights. Mongkut Wattana hospital said 13 people were injured, including three who suffered serious shrapnel wounds.

Bush works on leaving a legacy 
WASHINGTON -President George W. Bush says history will judge him, but he is getting his own crack first. Bush is using his final 50 days in oflice to tout his legacy, hoping to leave a lasting impression of overshadowed progress. 
On Monday, World AIDS Day, Bush was her­alded for his leadership in fighting the disease, a point that even his Democratic critics readily concede. 
The anti-AIDS program Bush championed in 2003 has delivered lifesaving medicine to more than 2 million people in five years, up from 50,000 people before it began. Many of those helped live in impoverished sub-Saharan Africa. where AIDS is the leading killer. 

Holiday parade accident injures nine 
OVERTON, Texas -A hospital official says an accident at a holiday parade in east Texas has injured at least nine people, some of them children.

India demands Pakistan take action 
Nation seeks answers as businesses reopen, life begins to return to nor-
Associated Press 

MUMBAI, India -India demanded Monday that Pakistan take "strong action" against those behind the deadly Mumbai attacks, and Washington pressured Islamabad to cooperate with the investigation. 
The only known surviving attacker told police that his group trained for months in camps operated by a banned Pakistani militant group, learning close-combat tech­niques, explosives training and other tactics for their three-day siege. 
Teams from the FBI and Britain's Scotland Yard met with top Indian police as they prepared to help collect evidence, a police official said. 
Soldiers removed the remaining bodies from the shattered Taj Mahal hotel, where the standoff finally ended Saturday morning, with at least 172 people dead and 239 wounded. The army had already cleared other siege sites, including the five-star Oberoi hotel and the Mumbai headquar­ters of an ultra-Orthodox Jewish group.

thn past two years," Packer said. 
"llopefully it gets better. There is

The only positive thing for Packnr and many other Notrn Dame fans was the beautiful California weathf~r. he said. 
Senior Luke Tabit thought thn problem wasn't the lack of tal­ent, but the lack ofemotion. 
"I don't think it would look good for Notre Dame to fire another coach afler throe years, but we d1~finitPiy need change. Our tnam has a lot of talnnt, but they don't look like they are motivated at all. We don't play as a team and we don't play with emotion." he said. 
Kristi Pellegrini, a Notre Dame senior in the Band of the Fighting Irish. said she was glad she had the opportunity to travel to Los Angeles to support the team. 
"It was definitely a unique experience bning out there and supporting the football team." she said. "I wish the outeome of the game had been better, but I'm glad I had the opportunity." 
Pellegrini said she thinks the best part of the game was the band's halftime show. 
"So many USC fans even eame down and complimented the band on our performance," she said. "And during the game, our 

band was even audible above the 
mic-nd USC band." 
The Trojan Marching Band's halftime show was a dig at the fact that the Band of the Fighting Irish hadn't traveled to Southern California in 35 years, she said. 
"USC's halftime show was a classless attack on Notre Dame," Pellngrini said. 'Their show was desigm~d to remind Notre Dame of what we missed out on in the 35 years that we haven't been traveling to USC." 
Even though they felt attacked, Pellegrini said the band listened to the USC halftime show and were commended by fans at their respect during their show. 
"Our band was commended by both Irish and Trojan fans as having the better halftime show," she said. 
She said most of the band is talking about how they outplayed the Trojan Marching Band by playing a better arrangement of A-lia's "Take on Me," a song that USC played during their halftime show, during the second half. 
Senior Matt Meinig, a saxo­phone in the band, said traveling to USC will be something he always remembers from his time at Notre Dame. 
"It's something that I'll remem­ber for the rest of my life, to be sure," Meinig said. "As a snnior, it was a great way to top off my final season. Despite the out­eome of the game and the hostile environment, it was probably the best away game I've played at because l could tell that every Irish fan out there appreciated the band's presence."

USAFhonors engineering professors 
Tomar, Xing were selectedfrom 210 proposals, will receive research grants 
Special to The Observer 
The University of Notre Dame's Vikas Tomar, assistant professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering, and Huili (Grace) Xing, assistant professor of electrical engi­neering, are two of the 39 engineers and scinntists selected by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFSOR) as part of the 2008 Young Investigator Program (YIP). 
The program, which is only open to engineers and scien­tists at U.S. research institu­tions who have received a doctoral degree within the last five years, recognizes those who "show exceptional ability and promise for conducting basic research." This year's YIP honorees will share approximately $12.1 million for research efforts over the next three years as outlined in their winning proposals. 
As in previous years, compe­tition for the award was very competitive. The ASFOR received 210 proposals encompassing a broad range of areas, including aerospace, chemical and materials sci­ences, physics and electronics, mathematics, information technologies, and life sciences. 
Tomar, who joined the University in 2006, is investi­gating nanoscale thermal con­duction and mechanical strength correlation in high­temperature ceramics as part of his efforts in the YIP. It coincides well with his work in the department's Multiphysics Laboratory, where he is studying advanced ceramic matrix composites for usn in energy plants. lligh-temperaturn ceramics that can work in extreme environments ­radiation or corrosion ­would significantly benefit thn coal industry and the develop­ment of nuclear power. For example, a simple increase in operating temperature (made possible through new high­temperature ceramics) can result in increased energy effi­ciency. 
Although not part of his YIP research, Tomar also is study­ing biomaterials such as bone issue and biosensors. In one project, he is analyzing the structure-property relation­ships for bone tissue in differ­ent chemical environments to determine how different drugs affect the properties (includ­ing strength) of bone tissue. 
In another research effort using molecular analyses, he is focusing on understanding the fundamental mechanisms that control biofunctional materials in extreme environ­ments, such as a highly radioactive environment or sensitive physiological envi­ronment (a diseased part of the human body). 
Xing's YIP focuses on the quantum limits of nitride HF high-electron mobility transis­tors. Through experimental and theoretical approaches, she is investigating the physi­cal origins of the upper limit of speed and power-handling capabilitins in gallium-nitride based semieonduetor transis­tors in order to advance the development of the next gen­eration radio frequency appli­cations. 
Similar electronic devices, featuring reduced size and lower energy consumption. have already been employnd in cell phone base stations. Xing envisions that high-elec­tron mobility transistors could replace bulky power adapters with millimeter size chips, deployed in hybrid engines in automobiles, efficient tera­hertz (Thz) emitters and a host of other applications. 
Xing's project aligns with her interests in nitride semi­conductors and electronic and optoelectronic devices. ller current research activities in this area include the integra­tion of heterogeneous materi­als using direct wafer bond­ing, development of high ener­gy effieiency green light emit­ting diodes for solid state lighting, as well as ultraviolet and infrared emitters, and Thz detection technologies for medical applications.

IN BRIEF 
Retailers offer deals on 'Cyber Monday' 
NEW YORK -Retailers who saw Thanksgiving holiday sales drop off as the weekend progressed stepped up online pro­motions on the day known as "Cyber Monday" to try to get consumers tired of the crowds at stores to keep shopping. 
But after weeks of already heavy dis­counting both at regular stores and online, experts were doubtful that the day would give much of a lift to what is still expected to be one of the weakest holiday seasons in years. 
"People are expecting that deals will only get better as we approach the Christmas time frame," said Youssef H. Squali, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. "So while Cyber Monday is significant I wouldn't say today is the only day to track. People may opt to wait a little more." 
The Monday after Thanksgiving was dubbed "Cyber Monday" by the National Retail Federation trade group in 2005 to describe the unofficial kickoff to the online retail season -when customers shopped at their desks as they returned to work. But with more deals advertised ahead of time and more consumers with high-speed access at home, the day has lost some lus­ter. 
Manufacturing falls to 26-year low 
WASHINGTON -A gauge of U.S. manufac­turing activity that fell to a 26-year low Monday followed similarly weak readings in Europe and China, fueling fears of a deepen­ing global downturn. 
The Institute for Supply Management's index of manufacturing activity for November fell to 
36.2 from October's 38.9. The reading was worse than Wall Street economists' expecta­tions of 38.4, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. A figure below 50 indicates the sector is contracting. 
The November reading is the lowest since May 1982, the Tempe, Ariz.-based ISM said. The report is based on a survey of corporate purchasing managers. 
The report came the same day that the National Bureau of Economic Research, a pri­vate group, said the U.S. economy has been in a recession since December 2007.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Alternatives to go green 
While GreeND's campaign to lower energy use and cost by handing out lluorescent lights are admirable, I feel that it's important to note that there are altnrnatives to fluorescent Lighting that also save energy and don't have all of' the nngative aspcets of' fluores­cent bulbs. 
First of all, many pnople forget or ignorn the fact that fluorescent lighting simply isn't a feasible alternative for some people and locations. Because fluorescent Lights don't work properly in very cold temperatures, they don't work well as outdoor lighting in cer­tain parts of the country. Other problems with fluorescent lights include the mercury inside them, which is released if they are acci­dentally broken, and is released into the ground and water when they arc thrown in the garbage. Other negative efl'ects of fluores­cent lighting occurs at a more personal level. In the workplace and in schools, studies have shown that fluorescent lighting increas­es irritability, blood pressure, and misbehavior among children. Many individuals with conditions that can cause photosensitivity, such as epilepsy and lupus, experience health problems due to lluorescent lighting. Many people also experience severe headaches and eye strain due to fluorescent light bulbs. 
It's certainly true that fluorescent lighting is the most energy efficient option, but its unpleasant light (even among "warm" CFLs, many people consider the light unflattering and unpleasant) and the immediate health ramifications led me to search for other options. Although they give oil' a lot of heat, some halogen lights are far more efficient than other incandescnnt bulbs without the hideous light and mercury of its fluorescent counterparts. Philips has released a line of natural-light bulbs called EcoVantagn that save 25 pnrcent on energy. A<> LED technology improves, it may prove to be a viable alternative for accent lighting. 
I fully agree with GrecNI)'s desire to save energy, but I believe it's important to do so without introducing highly unpleasant and even dangerous light. What I believe is most important, however, is ensuring that we don't force lluorescent light bulbs on people who don't want to fill their homes with limited-spectrum light that may cause them headaches or health problems. As I said, I fully support GreeND's desire to save the Earth through energy conservation, but we should also explore other options that arc more pleasant and healthy, and ensure that if' consumers want to pay the higher eneq.,ry bills to continue using f'ull-speetrum, warm, pleasant incandescent lighting, they are free to do so.

True tneaning lost 
Being a senior I admit that I was disappointed with how the game ended on Saturday, but when I read the view­points in November 23rd's paper, I was even more disap­pointed. Nobody talked about our senior football players. We arc so wrapped up in the future of the coaching staff and what was thrown during the game that the true meaning of the day was lost. 
I remember the end of sophomore year after the Army game and the farewell that the senior football players received. I'll tell you now that the current senior worked just as hard as they did and deserve the same amount of credit even though the last two years have not been the best in the history of the program. In fact, they stuck it out through a transition that we all knew would be bru­tal, and yet they came back full of energy and willingness to serve a storied tradition during its darker days. 
What are we giving them in return for four or five years of lives? If there is anything that has defined my last four years at this wondering institution, it has been my friends, my major, and Notre Dame Football. I have loved every minute of it: the tailgating, the games, the feelings of triumph and the feelings of' despair. Every weekend of fall semester, the student body has been brought together as one by Notre Dame Football. 
It is time that we all thank the seniors for what they have done for us all. So on behalf of myself, the senior class, and the student body, I would like to thank you, seniors. We appreciate everything that you have done for us, and we will not forget your devotion or determina­tion.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Syracuse, snow-balls, and seniors 
After watching the egregious show of ineptitude that was the football game against Syracuse, three major problems stood out in my mind as l reflected upon my last Notre Dame football experience as a student. Just chatting with depressed fellow seniors after the game, I could tell that these three issues-despite all the craziness that transpired -stood out perhaps the most: 
1. 
We lost. Obviously. Not only did we lose, but we lost to a team that. according to Sagarin rankings, is worse than 12 non-bowl-subdivision teams. It would be easy to rip apart our coaching, or our effort, or just the team in general-but I don't want to. l want to believe in Weis. I want to believe ND will return to prominence. Plus, that's a topic for another article. 

2. 
Lack of respect for the senior class. Please, do us a show of respect-we've stood by you through thick and thin, good (2005, 2006) and bad (actually, the worst season in ND history, 2007). It would have been a nice gesture to address the senior section at the end of the game, instead of the traditional march over to freshmen. 

3. 
The senior walk-ons and non-starters. Those who don't quite make the depth chart deserve a 


chance to play at home, which presumably is why former AD Kevin White scheduled such a patsy of an opponent for the last home game of the season. Oops. These guys work hard, day in and day out, for little to no recognition. They are the ones who keep the guys that see the field -and television cameras and fame (infamy?) associated with it-in fighting form. The unsung heroes, in this case, remain unsung, and it was a heartbreaking sight for all of us seniors to behold. 
Oh, and a note about the snowball-throwing debacle: 99.9 percent of the seniors in the section not only were not throwing at the team, but also thought that the idiots who were should be ejected. And some were, from what l saw. Moreover, it sure seemed like these clowns were aiming at the Indiana State Troopers (mean­mugging, goofy-hat-wearing and all) rather than the team. God knows we have more animosity towards those guys than any football team, losing or not.

Weren't you listening? 
This year, I participated in the creation of College HAS Issues, the annual presentation that is mandatory for all incoming freshman. Of course, HAS represents Hookups, Alcohol, and Sex, and we hoped to prevent the incoming freshman from making serious mistakes in any of these areas. Apparently, Melissa Buddie in her Nov. 19th letter concerning her own first semester at ND must have slept through my portion. I spoke for roughly fifteen minutes about ... that's right, the hook-up culture and its negative effects on the formation of lasting relationships. 
The following are direct quotations of what I said to the entire freshman class this past August: 
"Obviously the hookup culture is not very conducive to strong and lasting relationships. l would say that it actually impairs you in how you approach your relationships, because you are so used to doing it one way ... with no strings attached and most times with alcohol. But this is not a relationship, and rarely ever can it lead to a meaningful relationship. In fact, all it ever really leads to is an awkward moment in the dining hall." 
"As I talked with other friends, over and over I heard that the outcome of hook-ups is awkward run-ins in the dining hall the day after; never talking to that person again; and that it makes relationships -even friendships -nearly impossible. You quickly realize that campus is not that big after all ... really!" 
"The hook-up culture creates a situation where we are not striving for real relationships; we just want what is quick and easy. The work hard/play hard mentality translates to sexual activity; in fact, sexual activity becomes just another thing to check off our "to-do list" for the week -and almost always it involves serious binge drinking." 
"Given the hook-up culture, I think many people have a skewed idea of how real relationships work. If you only go through your college career pursuing hookups, then you won't be prepared to form successful relationships once you get out of college. From my experience, getting caught up in the hookup culture only leads to a skewed perspective on your self-value and your value of others. It's objectification of the opposite sex, especially women." 
At the time, I had assumed that most incoming freshman were old enough and mature enough not to need such advice. But upon reading that letter, it became clear that perhaps some of us may need a friendly reminder (especially as every aspect of the harmful effects of hookups discussed was also found in what I had already said). We don't need to run any experiments to demonstrate the harmful effects of such interactions (especially not six times). We just need to practice some common sense.

Alutnni need cotnpassion 
My last game as a student at Notre Dame was pretty much as painful as could possibly be expected. Yes, I cried. I stood the entire game, including half time, in the freezing cold, just like the rest of the senior class. I cheered my hardest. I did every possible thing I could think of to make the experience the best I possibly could. I went to the Pep Rally and Drummers' Circle. I tailgated. I ate a steak sandwich at the Knights of Columbus stand and a brat from a student-run concession stand. I participated in the marshmallow fight at half time. I did NOT throw snowballs. At anyone. And I DID ask those around me to stop. I got hit with a pretty hard snowball right in the neck and I suffered the redness and cold for the rest of the game. 
I don't think that students were trying to injure the players or anyone. They were trying to make the best of the fact that they were stuck in the snow for four hours. The snowballs that I saw being thrown were all well before we even considered it a possibility that we might lose that game. It was very immature and childish, but for me, the snowballs were the very least of what made my experience so sad. I didn't get to celebrate the end of my football fan-dom as a student. Instead, I got to see Syracuse jumping around in the middle of our band during the Alma Mater and Fight Song. I will never be able to forget that sight and how terrible it made me feel. I didn't get to see our senior players run around the field one last time. The team ran out that tunnel as soon as they possibly could. We students stayed out there for a long time afterward, but the players were gone immediately. 
And then, to top it all off, now alumni are writ­ing in to the Observer and saying things like, "Class of 2009, you are an embarrassment to yourselves and to Domers everywhere." Thanks a lot alumni. I really appreciate your support. The Notre Dame family is really making me feel loved. You're really helping an already painful situation. You guys are saying that you thought the student body was better than that. Well, I thought our alumni were smarter than to make hurtful generalizations like that. Apparently we were all wrong.

Pianos duel controversy 

In response to Tyler Deschamps's "Dueling Pianos and the Catholic Identity", I agree with your sentiments wholeheartedly. I, too, was in the audience at the Dueling Pianos show at Legends. I assumed it would be a night of simple entertainment in line with Notre Dame's Catholic identity. This, as would be proven later that evening, was clearly a false assumption. Like Tyler, I was shocked and offended by the performers' choice of songs. "FHG"-I dare not say the actual title, but you know what it is -shocked my sensibilities. Of course, not wanting to seem a wet blanket, I laughed and chortled along with the rest of the crowd, but inside I was deeply offended. Tyler, if that music violated your personal taste as it did mine, I have a nice album of Gregorian chants you can borrow if you want. Track 6 is particularly moving.

Snowball reactions 

Coach Weis said he was "taken aback" by the snowball throwing incidents at the Syracuse game. It's funny that he should feel that way. I for one have been taken aback for the entirety of my two seasons as a Notre Dame student by this team. Since pro football dominates my hometown of New York, I didn't know much about college ball before coming here, but I was given some impressions. Notre Dame was a premier program. They recruit the top players in the country, win things, and generally don't embarrass the University. Perhaps the part about top recruits is correct, but I've seen anything but premier football under Charlie Weis. I'm not calling for his termination, just suggesting that Charlie Weis should be taken aback by how he doesn't get top performance out of his "top recruits" rather than snowball throwing. Thankfully motivational wizards Jeff Jackson and Mike Brey will carry us through the winter.

Band tops USC 

Occasionally, USC loses a football game. But like our perpetual sunshine, the SC Band always wins, easily outclassing the lesser bands of the Pac-10. So imagine SC fans' shock and surprise when our Irish band not only visited the Coliseum for the first time last weekend, they conquered it. NO's band easily outplayed, out-marched, and out-choreographed the Trojan marching band. They even got an ovation from the usually tough SC crowd. Most of my USC friends have never been out of the Coliseum or the Pac-10. Many didn't even know we had a storied marching band of our own. They do now. As a native of Los Angeles and 1985 grad of ND, I know the Coliseum can be a lonely place for Domers. To the Notre Dame Fighting Irish Band, thanks for making the trip and giving all of us, including my SC friends, something else to talk about besides the final score. See you again in 2010!

Other highlights of the soundtrack include Hot Chocolate's "You Sexy Thing," the album's pair of Hob Dylan traeks, including a live version of "Maggie's Farm," and "Get Together" by The Youngbloods. Thompson himself would often champion The Youngblood's work as more powerful than most critics gave it credit for, down to the track's recognizable chorus. "C'mon, people now/ Smile on your brother/ Everybody get together/ Try to love one another right now." 
If anything, the "Gonzo" soundtrack is a fascinating look into the mind of a revolution­ary man through the music he knew and loved. Any fan of sixties music, ranging from Creedence Clearwater Revival to Lou Reed, should check out this album.

THE Tuesday, December 2, 2008 BSERVER USC 38, Notre Dame 3 
Good grief, Charlie 
Irish gain just 91 yards ofoffense in blowout at the Coliseum 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Editor 
For the second time in as many years, No. 5 Southern California hung 38 points on Notre Dame en route to a 38­3 victory in Los Angeles Saturday. 
The Trojans rolled to their seventh straight victory over the Irish -the longest streak in the rivalry's history ­behind an impressive showing from senior quarterback Mark Sanchez. Sanchez fin­ished his final home game with 267 yards passing and two touchdowns. 
"Well, it's a rivalry game and it's always tough to lose to any rival, but losing like this is obviously tough," Irish senior Pat Kuntz said. 
On the other side of the ball, the No. 1-rated USC defense stopped the Irish in their tracks. Notre Dame was held to a field goal on its only trip into Trojan territory and did not pick up a first down until the final play of the third quarter. 
The Irish defense kept things close through most of the first half, but the offense didn't help it out. With just over nine minutes until the break, Trojans senior corner­back Cary Harris picked off a tipped Jimmy Clausen pass to give USC the ball at the 45­yard line. Clausen finished the day 11-for-22 with two interceptions.

LOS ANGELES -Dear Charlie Weis Jr., 
We've never met so I don't know what your personality is like, or how you handle criticism of your father, but I can probably guess that it hurts, probably more than when someone says something bad about you. 
Every coach's son grows up idolizing his father. You think he's the smartest guy in the world. You think nobody is Editor-in-Chief a better coach than he is. And you don't believe it when anyone says otherwise. 
At least that's how I felt growing up. My father, Chet, was the head basketball coach at my high school, Bishop Hoban, in Wilkes­Barre, Pa., for 33 years. After my junior year, his job status was up in the air. A handful of angry par­ents were displeased with his per­formance -we finished just around .500 that year -and felt he should be doing better with the talent he had. 
It was only a handful of parents, but it was the right parents ­those with the deep pockets -that wanted him out. The boneheaded principal listened to them and took the matter under consideration and for weeks, we waited until he made the decision. 
Waiting was truly the hardest part. 
While we waited, people made accusations about my father and stabbed him in the back, 
just as I'm sure you've probably seen reports in various newspa­pers or Web sites, quoting sources -both named and anonymous ­that take shots at your father. 
And maybe you heard the USC fans Saturday -and even the Notre Dame fans last week -say-


ing you're dad stinks and should be fired as he was walking into the locker room. It's cheap and it's petty. 
But at the same time, you proba­bly realize that the team that dejectedly walked off the field Saturday wasn't the same team it was at the beginning of the year. It resembled the team that took the field week in and week out last season: The offensive line strug­gled mightily and as a. result, the offense did nothing. The defense, while spirited in the beginning, wore down from being on the field too much. As happened all last season, and Notre Dame can't have its team looking like it did in 2007. 
You don't want these critics to be right, but when you see the team play like this, you begin to worry if they're right to say your dad can't inspire his team and can't develop the talent that he brings in because he can't relate to college players. 
As for my dad, his critics said he many of the same things couldn't motivate the team to play, that he was wasting talent, and that he couldn't relate to high school kids. Funny, because after all, I was a high school kid, and he always related to me pretty well. But I recognized that we had talent and things just weren't clicking that season, and it frustrated a lot of people. I worried that people would think those critics were right. 
The mistake was, I took it all personally. It was hard to get up and go to school every day, and have to face the same rumors and accusations from these small peo­ple all over again. 
For weeks, we kept waiting. The parents who wanted my dad out even organized a meeting to rally support for their cause. 
In my head, I imagined all the conversations they were having with each other, all the long phone calls they must've had to plot dad's removal. I thought, "Don't these people have anything better to do with their lives than worry about the basketball team? After all. it's just sports, there are more impor­tant things to worry about." 
When you see these Web .sites, read the newspaper or watch ESPN, you might have the same opinion. 
I was distracted in every aspect of my life. There were some long, even sometimes tear-filled nights where I couldn't stop worrying. I saw what they were doing to my dad. He, too, became sadder and angrier during this time, and that made me even angrier. 
Finally, the school let him have one more year. An odd arrange­ment, but we made the most of it, winning our district title and advancing to the state quarterfi­nals. So much for the argument that he couldn't coach anymore. 
Charlie Jr., you're going to hear a lot of rumors -many more at Notre Dame than we heard at my high school. Tune them out. 
You're going to hear a lot of talk on TV. Turn it off'.

Ineffective offense dooms Irish 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Assistant Managing Editor 
LOS ANGELES -Anyone looking for the main reason that Notre Dame fell to No. 5 USC Saturday needs to look no far­ther than the top of the stat sheet. 
In the 38-3 loss, the Irish ran 49 offen­sive plays for 91 yards, good for a 1.9 yards per play average. On the other side of the ball, the Trojans had an aver­age of 6.8 yards per play, with 449 yards gained on 66 plays. 
The rest of the stat sheet looks to favor the Irish, who played a disciplined game (except for the occasional scuffle). The turnover margin was even with three apiece and USC actually had more penal­ties than Notre Dame did (eight flags for 80 yards against the Trojans and only two for 22 yards against the Irish). 
Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis credit­ed a lot of his team's offensive inability to the Trojan defense, which was one of the best in the country in both scoring and yards going into this game. 
Weis said the Trojans backed into a cover-2 shell, something they have not done often this year. 
"They're more of a press-man, bring an extra guy down in the box," he said. "But they felt they could stop us with their front seven and they were able to do that." 
The Trojans managed to sack Notre Dame quarterback Jimmy Clausen four times Saturday, all from the front seven and only one from a linebacker. Irish running back Robert Hughes tries to break a tackle during Notre

Laying do"Wit 
the L.A. law-
The battle began before the game started. Irish and Trojan players 
clashed on the field, emotions overflowing. Once the game began, how­ever, the battle turned into a bloodbath. Notre Dame hung with the Trojans in the first quarter and was only down by seven, but an inter­ception and a long touchdown run quickly changed that. USC's 17 points in the second quarter put the game out of reach. 
USC added to its lead with a one-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. It took the Irish 45 minutes-right up to the end of the third quarter-to get a first down, and the Irish didn't reach Trojan territo­
ry until the fourth quarter. Rrandon Walker's field goal averted the shutout. but another Southern Cal touchdown pass ensured that Notre Dame could not eover the 31.5-point spread, the largest in the history of' the series. Late-game scul'lles on the field did nothing to change the outcome. and Notre Dame limped out of the Coliseum with an even record. 


Clockwise from top, Clausen throws a pass to Robert Hughes; linebacker Kerry Neal dives to recover a loose ball; Notre Dame and USC players get in each other's faces before the game; Irish linebackers Steve Quinn, right, and Kevin Smith force Trojans running back Staton Johnson to fumble; Trojans defenders sack Clausen.

It provides theright musical blend for vampires and their sig­nificant others, and it can do the same for ordinary people as well. This 14-song mix is just some of the music that set the mood for the hOliday season, teen blockbuster, Twilight. And for those, who {despite constant attention paid to Bella and Edward in books, movies, and the on the Web) still can't get enough, this soundtrack will help feed the Twilight addiction. Still, the album has an eerily unusual and enjoyable mix that can stand on its own, even without the Twilight phenomena. 
With a peculiar, and yet satisfYing, blend of pounding, aggres­sive techno-rock hybrid, hypnotic indie, and tender, slow love the Twilight soundtrack is surprisingly cohesive. An under­anomaly connects the tracks with an indescribable quality 
created by sound, lyrics, and tone that unpredictably work to~rettter. Going off the heavily beaten path of solely popular hits, the mix generates an oflbeat concoction that translates from film to album, and has potential to suit Twilight fans and those not so vampire obsessed alike. 
The appeal of Twilight's soundtrack is that it's atypical and unpredictable in equal parts. At one moment, the processed sound of techno-rock pushes a fast, beating tempo and, at the next, captivating raw vocals are crooning over minimal instru­mental. And yet, the swings from one end of the spectrum to the

"other album highlights. It's not only the rhythmic quality of the tracks that sew a thread from one high powered track to another but also an eerily off beat sound that is nonetheless confi­
-inJI$ atypical power~ Tracks like these, while more subtle, are the strength arid backbone of the album that help transition etween mellow and vigorously aggressive melodies. 
The heart wrenching love songs are all similarly unhurriHd and deliberate. More importantly, they all seem to have an enthralling spirit. Iron and Wine's contribution, in their never-fail heart­warming, romantic style, enchants listeners with the magical "Flightless Bird, American Mouth." 
But perhaps the most surprising musical contributor is the star of the movie himself, Rob Pattinson. Lending two tracks to the album, Pattinson's crooning is soulful, measured, and breathtak­ingly redolent of pain and love. While he's said that a musical career is a backup. his musical talent has a captivating ability that reeks a maturity that his acting skills lack. Sadly, these are the only two tracks available from Pattinson, whose talent could no doubt create more beguiling music. 
Also, the instrumental and classical portions of the soundtrack are worth being mentioned. While Carter Burwell created the entire score for the Iilm, his touch is only found on the soundtrack in "Bella's Lullaby," which comes off a bit more like seductive piano playing rather than calming, bed-time lullaby. More from Burwell would have been a welcome addition. His talent easily could have replaced tracks from more predictable, unexciting artists like Paramore, which probably should have been left out in the first place. Additionally, "Clair de Lune" provided a classical, charming piece that nicely works in with the rest ofthe album. 
Unconventional film themes somehow translate into an atypical sound that is just as appealing as the story for which it sets the mood. Some tracks utilize a powerful tension that encompasses equal parts of aggressive passion, empowering poignancy, and measured restraint. Others have an affecting sensitivity that will pluck at listeners' heart strings. And still other songs instrwnen­taiJy create charmingly enchanting melodies. 
Perhaps all styles are in their own way memorizing and this is the quality that defmes and unites tl1e album as a whole. And while, of course, certain tracks are so evocative of their respective cinematic scenes that it is hard not to be sucked into the film, for the most part, the Twilight soundtrack can stand on its own as a offbeat, captivating mix. It will speak not only to Twilight fans but also to those who simply love a cohesive variety of none-generic, satisfYing music.

Twilight: The Soudtrack 
Various Artists Released by: Chop Shop Records Recommended Tracks: "Spotlight", "Let Me Sign," Flightless Bird, American Mouth," "Full Moon" 
By MARTHA KARAM Scene Writer 
Time has treated David Byrne and Brian Eno well. Over 25 years after their collabo­rative and experimental 1981 release "My Life in the Bush of GhosL'>," Byrne and Eno team up in a familiar sounding summer Internet release, "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today." Byrne and Eno's latest collaboration sounds exactly how you would expect a Talking Heads and Brian Eno album to sound. Take Byrne's vocals and soothingly sanctified lyrics and place them onto Eno's distinctly warped electron­ic-rock sound and you get "Everything That llappens." 
If you're looking for an album that goes outside of what you expect from Eno and Byrne, "Everything That llappens" will not suffice. Most of the songs on the album are comparable in either lyrical mode or saun­tering beat to any Talking Heads album you've heard. lf you happen to be a big Talking Heads fan, this album is a lot like what you would expect from the band somewhere between "Remain in the light" and "Speaking in Tongues." 
Byrne's vocals have changed little, if at all, for the better, becoming slightly less comical and irritating than his Talking Heads days. The tracks "I Feel My Stuff," "Poor Boy," and "Wanted For Life" carry the most obvious influence from Eno with their more synthesized sound and stick-out on the albwn as more current and accessi­ble. 
The ironic single off the album, "Strange Overtones," is a poppy song about a song. The concept of a song about songwriting seemed doomed. But despite its literal lyrics of "melting snowballs" and "hearing your feet in the apartment next door", the song's subject ties together the entire albwn's idea of the transcendent pleasures of music over time and even Byrne's per­sonal beliefs. 
The second song off the album, My Big Nurse, is testament to that subject. As an ode to Byrne's confidence in a high being, and the biblical references scattered throughout the entire album hints that Byrne's higher being just might be God. 
The music on the album is contemporary, but the lyrics could easily be placed on an album over a half-century earlier and still be appreciated in a completely different context. The ability of the lyrics to match Eno's instrumentation is why Byrne and Eno make a good team. 
The ability of the lyrics to be timeless as well as modern makes Byrne's influence on the album more overtly memorable than Eno's influence. It is also Byrne's influence that makes the album sound more like a Talking Heads' album than anything else. 
There is one difficulty in listening to this album. When a producer and his artist get together to make an album again, it's a chore to avoid similarities and associations in sound to their previous work. If you are willing to accept that this album is not going to be a refreshingly novel sound check out "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today." The album manages to be unique from most music being released today, regardless of Byrne and Eno's expe­rience and practice in music for three decades. 
The full streaming albun1 is available on the official site (http://www.every­thingthathappens.com), but for the deluxe edition, which contains 5 extra tracks, you can now order a physical copy.

NEW YORK, N.Y. ­Taken to court in hand­cuffs, Plaxico Burress post· ed $100,000 bail on weapons possession charges Monday as the frenzy grew around the Giants star receiver who accidentally shot himself in a nightclub. 
Authorities said team­mate Antonio Pierce was being investigated over his role in the weekend shoot· ing, while the Super Bowl­champion Giants weren't sure what action they would take, if any, against Burress. The NFL said it was monitoring develop· ments. Mayor Michael Bloomberg also weighed in, saying it would be an outrage "if we didn't pros­ecute to the fullest extent of the law." 
Burress shot himself in the right thigh in the VIP section of the Latin Quarter nightclub in Manhattan about 1 a.m. Saturday, police said. He did not have a permit to carry a handgun in New York. 
A witness reported hear­ing a popping sound before Burress' legs began to shake, according to a criminal complaint. It said the person saw a bloody pistol fall out of his pant leg and land on the floor before Burress said "Take me to a hospitaL" 
It's believed Pierce took Burress to a car and then left with him, according to police. Burress was treat­ed at New York­Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center and released later Saturday. 
Burress was charged with two counts of second­degree criminal possession of a weapon, which could result in a prison sentence of 3 years to 15 years if he is convicted. He was not required to enter a plea Monday and is due back in court on March 31. Burress did not say any­thing in court. 
"He is standing talL He is a mature adult," said Benjamin Brafman, his defense lawyer. "I think any professional athlete in this situation would be concerned." 
He said Burress is feel· ing OK. "If they let him play, he will be able to play.... I think he will be a superstar for the rest of his career." 
Originally, police had said that running back Derrick Ward was with Burress and Pierce at the club, relying on informa­tion given to them from security guards at the bar. But police said later that it was unclear if Ward was at the club, and the run­ning back denied that he was. 

IN BRIEF Marbury's future with Knicks 
uncertain after tirade 
GREENBURGH, N.Y-Stephon Marbury did not get the divorce he wants, but he and the New York Knicks agreed to a separation. 
Marbury was ordered Monday to stay away from the Knicks \\-bile the team looks for a solution to its $21 million problem ­one that has lingered since the preseason and exploded last week when the team sus­pended him for refusing to play and he retaliated with a series of inflammatory remarks about coach Mike D'Antoni. 
Marbury's future was "not resolved" dur­ing a meeting with team president Donnie Walsh at the Knicks' practice fu.cility, accord­ing to the players' mmciation attorney rep­resenting him. The sides will continue to talk, but Marbury won't be around in the meantime. 
"After meeting with Stephon and his rep­re;entative this afternoon, we have directed Stephon not to participate in practice or attend games until further notice," Walsh said in a statement 'We want to continue to meet with him to discuss a long-term resolu­tion." 
Red Raiders' Harrell's tinger 
broken in nine places 
LUBBOCK, Tex. -Texas Tech quarter­back Graham Harrell was recovering Monday from surgery to repair nine breaks in two fingers of his non-throwing hand, but he won't miss any playing time. 
Texas Tech spokesman Orris Cook con­firmed details of Harrell's injury and Sunday surgery. He didn't have specifics on whether Harrell's fingers got caught in a facemask or slammed against a helmet in Saturday's 35-28 win over Baylor. 
ESPN.com first reported the details involving the nation's leading passer. Surgeons inserted 17 pins and two plates into the pinkie and ring finger of Harrell's left hand. 
Harrell, a contender for the Heisman Trophy, will play when the No. 8 Red Raiders (11-1) appear in their ninth straight bowl, likely the Cotton BowL 
The fifth-year senior played in the sec­ond half and finished with 309 yards and two touchdowns, the second one coming midway through the fourth quarter to cap a 21-point rally by the Red Raiders. 
Anderson out for season,
Dorsey to lead the Browns 
BEREA, Ohio-Derek Anderson's season is officially over, yet another slap for the down-on-their-luck Oeveland Browns. 
Anderson, who lost his starting job to Brady Quinn several weeks ago, will miss the final four games after !Paring a lig'dlllent in his left knee on Sunday against Indianapolis. 
An MRI taken Monday revealed Anderson tore the medial collateral ligament when he was sacked in the final minutes of Oeveland's 10-6loss to the Colis. Anderson, making his first start since Nov. 2 after being benched for Quinn, will not need surgery. He will be placed in a brace and will need four to six weeks to recover: 
Quinn, too, is done for the season with a finger injury. He has not yet decided whether to have surgery on his broken right index finger, which he hurt on Nov. 17 at Buffalo. 
The injuries to their top two Qll'> mP.arJs the Browns (4-8) will start third-stringer Ken Dorsey on Sunday against the Tennessee Titans (11-1). Return specialist Joshua Gibbs will serve as Dorsey's backup.

Irish end season with sweep 
By JARED )EDICK Sports Writer 
The Irish finished up their season in style with a 3-0 (25-23, 25-19, 25-22) win over Xavier on Friday, sending their two seniors, middle blocker Justine Stremick and out­side hitter Mallorie Croal, off into the sunset with a good taste in their mouths. 
"We all would have rather been playing in the NCAA's," Irish coach Debbie Brown said. "But it was important for those two to go out with a win. We all have a lot of respect for Justine and Mallorie." 
Notre Dame (17 -14; 9-5 Big East) did not disappoint on senior day, dominating all facets of the game against Xavier (16-15; 8-5 Atlantic 
10) to pull out the sweep win and earn the team its 80th victory in the seniors four years. 
"Overall. we did pretty well, despite a somewhat poor showing statistically," Brown said. "Our main goal wa<> to get everybody into the match and gain some experience." 
Freshman outside hitter Kristen Dealy and junior outside hitter Christina Kaelin had 10 kills apiece to lead the Irish in scoring, who hit .225 as a team. Sophomore outside hitter Kellie Sciacca tossed in eight kiUs with five blocks with Strernick nailing five more kills. Sophomore libero/defensive specialist Megan Dunne led the Irish with 14 digs, fol­lowed closely by freshman libenvdefensive specialist Frenchy Silva's total of 10. 
But the real story of the day was the send-off for the seniors, who have been important leaders for the Irish for some time now. 
Croal could not make it onto the court this year for any extended period of time because of injury, but she took over the role of doing whatever she could on the sidelines, according to Brown. 
"Mallorie was just an outstanding leader," Brown said. "She could not be the leader she was on the court because of her injury, but she did everything she possibly could off of it to help the team." 
Brown found the hard work and insights of Croal to her fellow team­mates to be inspiring and an impor­tant aspect of the team down the stretch and through the surprising run to the Big East Championship. 
"Mallorie tried everything to get back out there, but her ability to do everything you would expect a leader to do was important down the stretch," Brown said. "She was an inspiration to us." 
The last month of the season saw Stremick coming on as the player and leader Brown always knew she could be. 
"Justine is our dominant presence at the net," Brown said. "This last month saw her playing up to the ability that she always had." 
Strernick came from a small town by the name of Langdon, North Dakota, and did not even play for a club team, but she found a way to keep rising to the occasion and become a key player on a Big East team, according to Brown. 
"When she came onto the team as a freshmen, she had to sit and learn from some dominant players already on the team," Brown said. "But she stepped up into the start­ing role sophomore year and just kept getting better and better. She is really pretty remarkable." 
After failing to reach their goal of making the NCAA's this year, the Irish have to look to next season, as they would like to move beyond the inconsistencies that plagued them for most of this year. 
"It is a little frustrating when you have an up and down year," Brown said. "The early losses really hurt us, especially with all the injuries." 
But Brown believes the season ended on a high note with the team coming together in the Big East tournament, bolstered by the fact that the team is only losing two players to graduation and will boast six returning seniors and four jun­iors. 
"Overall we improved as a team," Brown said. "Nobody on this team ever crumbled, and no one threw in the towel." 
The expectations are even higher next year than this. 
"We have very high expecta­tions," Brown said. "We felt that this year would be the year we made it back to the NCAXs and returned to an elite status. That did not happen this year, so there is no question we want to make it there next year." 
The Irish will be back next fall looking to build on the momentum gained from a furious run at the end of the year.

Belles break streak against Wheaton 
By KATE GRABAREK and 
MICHAEL BLASCO 

Sports Writers 
The Belles certainly had a full plate over Thanksgiving break, opening a two-week home stand with three games in four days. 
Saint Mary's (2-3) earned its first win in eleven meetings against Wheaton on Wednesday, triumphing 81-78 over the visiting Thunder, bel'ore dropping two matches in the Saint Mary's College Thanksgiving Classic over the wneknnd. The Belles took a close, 66-63 loss to Otterbein, beforn No. 21 University of Chicago edgnd out Saint Mary's 73-(14 on Sunday. 
Bnllns head coach .len Henley is looking for lwr squad to step up across thn board this sea­son. 
"I expnct us to have more depth in our program this ynar," lienley said. "We need to improve our overall team defense and be more balanced in our offense from last sea­son." 
In its lirst home game of the season, Saint Mary's survived a late rally from Wheaton to take home the vietory 81-78. 
After trading points through the early going, a 24-11 Belles charge late in the first half gave Saint Mary's a 50-37 lead heading into the locker room. Wheaton hung tough in the sec­ond period, tying the contest at 78 with only 39 seconds remaining. 
Belles freshman guard Maggie Ronan pulled down an offensive rebound with 27 sec­onds left, before a crucial foul sent her to the free-throw line. She sunk the first to take a 79­78 lead. After missing the sec­ond, Saint Mary's junior for­ward Anna Kammrath picked up the most important of her fourteen rebounds on the night. The Belles would not relinquish the lead. 
Senior forward Erin Newsom notched a double-double with 22 points against 10 rebounds on the night, while the squad shot 43.8 percent from the field and 42.9 percent beyond the arc. 
After the holiday, Saint Mary's dropped both contests of the weekend's SMC Thanksgiving Classic, opening the tournament with a 66-63 loss to the Cardinals. 
Otterbein shot over 55 per­cent from the floor in the open­ing half to take a 38-34 lead at the half, while the Belles kept it close by going B-for-16 from thfl charity stripe. A pair of field goals from Honan to open the second tied the game up quickly. The two squads traded the lead seven teams before a Cardinals three-pointer halfway through the second gave them the lead for good. 
In its Sunday match against the Maroons, Saint Mary's kept it close until halfway through the first, in which a 17-4 run for Chicago broke the 15-15 tie. The Maroons would not let up until claiming a 73-64 victory. 
Newson repeated her double­double performance adding 10 rebounds to her 20 points. Belles senior forward Nicole Beier tallied a career-high 20 points alongside a perfect 6­for-6 effort from the free-throw line. Beier led the Belles with 32 points for the tournament and was named to the All­Tournament team. She also earned her first ever MIAA Player of the Week Award for her efforts off the bench. 
Saint Mary's has struggled through the early part of the season having been exacerbat­ed by the graduation of an out­standing senior class last spring, notably guard Alison Kessler. 
"There certainly was a void to rill after the graduation of Alison," llenley said. "But every program goes through that transition when seniors gradu­ate. The team has adjusted well." 
The Belles open their MIAA­conference schedule Wednesday with a 7:30 p.m. game against Trine at Saint Mary's Angela Athletic Facility in Notre Dame, Ind.

missed opportunities. 

"I obviously feel sorry for the seniors," Notre Dame coach Bobby Clark said. "They've had a great career. This is the first time they've fallen in the second round. It's always tough when that hap­pens. This group of guys have worked so hard over the past four years and this year they have been superb. It's been a great senior class. I felt we deserved more, but soccer can be a cruel game sometimes." 
Cruel would be the word to describe the end to Notre Dame's season. Kupe hit the game winner with only 1:14 remaining on the clock when he took a pass from senior defender Brian Usinger and fired past Irish keeper Phillip Tuttle. 
The goal put a cap on a strong Wildcat performance in the second half that saw Northwestern out-shoot Notre Dame 7-4 after intermission. The comeback started early in the· second half when the same duo responsible for Northwestern's game-winning goal tied the game. In the 66th minute, Usinger slotted a through ball putting Kupe behind the Irish defense, and the forward made no mistake dispatching the ball past Tuttle. 
"[Kupe] came on and caused trouble for us," Clark said. "We had a little bit of a problem with getting our feet in the back at that time. They pressed forward and it was a very good win for them." 
Northwestern's second-half surge couldn't have been more different than the first 45 min­utes. Before halftime, the Irish constantly pressured the Wildcats goal registering 11 shots to Northwestern's four. The pressure paid off in the 24th minute when senior defender Jack Traynor ripped a shot from near the top of the 18-yard box that beat Wildcats keeper Misha Kosenthal to the far post. 
Kosenthal would give up nothing more, ending the game with seven saves. In the 38th minute, junior midfielder Michael Thomas beat Kosenthal again to the far post, but his shot rebounded back off that post into play. Junior midfielder Dave Donahue was there for the rebound, but his attempt was saved by Kosenthal. 
"I thought we played excep­tionally well in the first half," Clark said. "I also thought we played well in the first part of the second half. They scored the goal and they certainly got into the game. They finished the game very strongly. We had our opportunities. We needed to get a second goal." 
That second goal never came, and Notre Dame paid dearly for it. It was the second time this season that the Irish let in a goal in the final min­utes that ultimately cost them the game. In a regular season tilt at Louisville, Notre Dame conceded the tying goal on a penalty kick in the 90th minute before losing in overtime.

winning streak record -origi­nally set from 1943-48 at Notre Dame Fieldhouse. Against North Carolina and Furman, McAlarney shot a combined 19­for-35 from 3-point range. 
Notre Dame 81, Texas 80 

Notre Dame did not trail for the entire second half Tuesday night but that doesn't mean the Irish had an easy time with A.J. Abrams and Texas. 
In a game that resembled a Wild West shootout. No. 8 Notre Dame prevailed over the No. 6/7 Longhorns 81-80 to advance to the linal game of the EA Sports Maui Invitational. 
But not before Abrams drained four second-half 3­pointers and saw his despera­tion 60-foot prayer graze the front of the rim and fall just short as the linal buzzer sound­ed. 
"We did a good job defending the 13-point] line the whole game," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "A couple that he hit were bombs." 
But Abrams' biggest bomb just missed. 
"I was wondering if the [good] karma reversed, quite frankly," Brey said. "Because he got a pretty clean look and he was feeling good." 
Abrams got the shot off after Irish junior Luke Harangody, who led Notre Dame with 29 points and 13 rebounds, missed two free throws with 3.5 sec­onds left. Harangody's foul shooting was part of a second­half trend for the Irish, who hit just 6-of-13 freebies during the period. 
The free throw misses were some of the only mistakes Notre Dame made all day. The Irish committed just six turnovers against a physical Texas team. 
"We should be a single-digit turnover team no matter who we play," Brey said. "I wasn't sure if we'd be able to do that against Texas. That's really tak­ing care of the ball because they come aftnr you." 
Irish guards Kyle McAiarney and Tory Jackson, who scored 19 and 16 points, respectively, high-fived over Brey in the postgame press conference after they heard they had limit­ed Notre Dame's turnovers to single digits. 
With just over 12 minutes remaining in the first half, the Irish held a 19-13 lead. But Texas went on a 14-4 run over the next five minutes of play to take a 27-23 
2:34 left in the period, senior forward Luke Zeller drained a 3-pointer to give Notre Dame a 40-35 lAad. After Texas cut the deficit to one on a pair of free throws, llarangody answered with a jumper and a three-point lead the Irish would not surren­der in the half. 
Texas cut the Irish lead to two or fewer six times in the second hall' but Notre Dame responded each time with a bucket of its own. 
"That's maturity and experi­ence. Young teams panic, young teams panic in a situation like that," Brey said. "You can't inject an experience into a team because when these guys were young they got smacked a little bit when runs came like that ... That's being old and poised." 
Brey and his players said Texas' physical play provided the Irish with a good template for their Big East schedule. The Longhorns outrebounded the Irish 48-37 but Notre Dame came up with several key rebounds in the game's waning minutes. 
"That was definitely the toughest challenge I've had this whole season," Harangody said. "They have a great front line with [forwards Connor] Atchley and [Damian] James." 
Brey said the win over Texas will benefit the Irish during the selection process for the NCAA Tournament at the end of the season. 
''I'm trying to figure out how to get a bid from the Big East right now with the schedule we play," he said. "Certainly, this was a great resume win and we have the opportunity for anoth­er one so anything we can stack up." 
North Carolina 102, Notre Dame 87 
At the Maui Invitational, Notre Dame showed why it was one of the top 10 teams in the country, but in Wednesday's champi­onship game, North Carolina showed why it was the No. 1 team in the country. 
The Irish, who defeated No. 6/7 Texas Tuesday, fell to the Tar Heels 102-87 despite 39 points and a Notre Dame record 10 three-pointers from Irish guard Kyle McAlarney. 
"They're an elite team. We're not that," Brey said. "We like to aspire to be that in time. Maybe, hopefully by the league season, maybe by February. We know where the bar is." 
Notre Dame simply had no answer defensively for the Tar Heels, specifically Tyler Hansbrough and Ty Lawson. Hansbrough, the reigning Naismith and Wooden national player of the year, scored 34 points and grabbed five rebounds. Lawson, a lightning­quick guard, scored 22 points, dished out 11 assists and claimed tournament MVP hon­ors. Forward Deon Thompson also pitched in 19 points and 13 rebounds. 
"I was disappointed, we did such a good job against Texas' bodies in the paint last night," Brey said. "We couldn't do it tonight and that's disappointing for all of us." 
One reason for Notre Dame's trouble defensively could have been the condition of junior for­ward Luke Harangody, who scored 13 points

"I just felt good. I got my legs under me. My teammates did a great job, especially [senior for­ward! Zach Hillesland. I have to give him a lot of credit. He did a great job the past three days of getting ball exchanges and set­ting good screens on my guy." 
But as was the case all night, every time Notre Dame made a run, North Carolina responded. 
"We were in desperation time and I was just trying to put some points on the board," McAlarney said. "But we can't win without getting stops and we can't come back without get­ting stops. It's as simple as that." 
McAlarney hit another shot that would've pulled Notre Dame within eight, but the ref­erees had called a foul on Thompson. Irish junior guard Tory Jackson missed the front end of a one-and-one. North Carolina then scored six of the next eight points. 
Two more McAlarney three­pointers made it 93-81 with 
1:57 to play, but time was run­ning out on Notre Dame. A 3­point play from Thompson and a pair of free throws from Hansbrough gave the Tar Heels a 100-81 lead with 1:17 to play. 
"We're not at North Carolina's level yet, but we can be," McAlarney said. 
Early in the first half, Notre Dame did play at North Carolina's level. A dunk from senior forward Luke Zeller pulled the Irish within 24-21 with 10:17 to play, but then they went on a dry spell, scoring just five points in the next 6:40. 
During that stretch, North Carolina grabbed a 40-26 lead. Brey said the lack of offensive production was more Notre Dame just missing open looks, instead of North Carolina shut­ting the Irish down. 
"I think we missed a lot of 

clean looks. Clean threes. [Senior forwardJ Ryan Ayers and Zeller had a couple there, but they have to keep shooting them because that's who we are. We're a team that needs to knock down a good percentage of those when we get clean looks, especially against a team like this, where we're not going to be able to maneuver inside as easy with all those bodies." 
Brey added: "We're going to need a few more of those to go in because we're going to need to score a lot against this team to beat them. We're not stop­ping them or shutting them down." 
For the game, Notre Dame shot 32-for-78, 41 percent, while the Tar Heels shot 39-for­70, or 56 percent. North Carolina also shot 19-for-21 from the free-throw line 
Notre Dame 93, Furman 61 

Playing without Harangody, the Irish still steamrolled Furman Sunday night in the Joyce Center as McAlarney hit another nine 3-pointers and fin­ished with 32 points. Jackson pitched in 17 points, eight assists and six rebounds while Zach Hillesland added 12 rebounds. Ayers added 19 points on 8-for-13 shooting. Notre Dame plays South Dakota tonight.

North Carolina 
only led 46-36 at 
the half, but 
extended its lead to 58-43 with 15:15 left to play. After the media timeout, Hansbrough scored North Carolina's next six points. Then a 12-4 run, featuring a three from Lawson and a dunk from Hansbrough, gave North Carolina a 76-53 lead with 8:49 to play. 
Then, McAlarney put on a shooting clinic the rest of the game, hitting shots from well beyond the 3-point line and with defenders in his face. Within a 
3:20 span, McAlarney hit four three-pointers and scored 14 points and Notre Dame pulled within 84-73 with 5:15 to play.

On a cold night at Alumni Field,. which will bo replaced next season by the Alumni Soccer Stadium, the Irish rolied on a trio of Texans to take them to the College Cup. Hanks, Schuveiller and Knaack all hail from the Lone Star Statn. 
"It's kind of funny, with all the cold-weather games we've been playing in the past month, that three of the players from Texas were the ones who hooked up on our goals. So it was kind of nice to see the warm-weather girls do that for us," Waldrum said.

After a scoreless overtime period, they moved into a shootout. Western Michigan scored early and Maday and sophomore Calle Ridderwall both missed their chances. Jackson decided to move Thang to the third spot because of his play late in the game and the move paid off. Thang buried his shot to send things to sudden death. 
"Tbe shootouts are kind of a feeling out process at this point. I went in with a certain order of guys I would use, but I changed that based on the way we were playing late in the game," Jackson said. 
Two shooters later Condra stepped up and finished things ofT for the Irish. 
Friday night was a little bit easier for Notre Dame. The team skated to a 4-1 win while going four-for-four on the power-play. 
Western Michigan's Campbell got things startnd with his Jirst of two goals in the series halfway through the first period. 
Junior Kevin Deeth answered late in the period with his third goal of the year. Deeth's unit which also includes Hanson, Ridderwall, Maday and Brett Blatchford was on the ice for all of Notre Dame's goals. 
"There is no question they have had a lot of success over the past couple weeks," Jackson said. "Teams are going to start looking for ways to shut them down, so the are going to have to be ready to make adjustments." 
Ridderwall picked up the next two goals in the second period and Maday rounded out the scoring in the third. Ridderwall had four points in the game adding two assists to his pair of goals. Hanson also had three assists in the game. 
The Irish will defend their No. 1 spot this weekend in Big Rapids, Mich. with a pair of games against Ferris State.

Irish nallled top tealll in the country after w-eekend svveep 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Editor 

Notre Dame has rnachnd the top again. 
With a pair of wins over Western Michigan this weekend the Irish moved to No. 1 in the polls for the first time since the 1~nd of tho 2006-07 season. 
"It's all well and good," Irish coach Jeff .Jackson said. "Polls are polls, I didn't really discuss it with [the team[. I want them to focus on the process not on where they are ranked." 
Notre Dame entered the week­end just behind Minnesota in the national rankings. A loss and a tie from the Gophers were enough to drop them behind the Irish who received 33 of 34 first place votes. 
The team improved its unbeat­en streak to ten games, but it didn't come easily. Western Michigan took the Irish to their second sudden death shootout of the season Saturday night before senior captain Erik Condra scored the game-winner. The shootout victory was the second of the season for Notre Dame in as many tries. 
Senior forward Christian Hanson got the scoring started midway through the first period when he snuck behind the Bronco defense and buried his team-leading ninth goal of the season. Christiaan Minella and Garrett Regan both picked up assists on the play. 
Not to be outdone, freshman Bill Maday netted his ninth of the season only three minutes later on the power-play to give his team an early 2-0 lead. 
"[Hanson and Maday] are play­ing with a lot of confidence. Once they start feeling good about their game they start playing even better," Jackson said. 
Western Michigan then took over with three unanswered goals from Patrick Galivan, Tyler Ludwig and Max Campbell. Jackson said he felt his team lost the momentum quickly, giving

The Irish must have left Alumni Field last Tuesday night with a bitterly cold feeling that had nothing to do with the win­tery conditions they faced dur­ing their second-round NCAA Tournament game against Northwestern. 
For the first time in any of the current Notre Damn players' career exempting fillh-year sen­iors, they won't be tasting the Sweet 16.

"She was doing a tPrrific job so far," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "It was devastat­ing news at first." 

McGraw said the presence of assistant coach Niele Ivey, who also had multiple i\CL surgeries while at Notrn Dame, will have a positive efl'ect on Peters' recovery. 
"That was the first thing we talknd about," McGraw said. "It's a grnat rnfi~rence point !or her." 
McCraw also said she asked the rest of the players to fill one gap left by Peters' absence. 
Despite losing Peters, Notre Dame won two games over the holiday break. beating Georgia Southnrn 85-36 and No. 21 Miehigan State 78-72. The Irish hPld Georgia Southern to 21.4 percent field goal shooting and forced 24 turnovers.

MAUl -Notre Dame faced its biggest tests of thP season over Thanksgiving break when it faced Texas and North Carolina in the Maui Invitational. The Irish proved they belong among the top teams in the country when they beat Texas 81-80 and learned what they needed to get to the same level as thn No. 1 Tar Heels. Of course, hav­ing a healthy Luke Ilarangody, who contracted pneumonia in Maui, could have helped against the Tar Heels.
