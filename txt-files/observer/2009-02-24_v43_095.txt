Bengal Bouts fighters make first trip to Bangladesh in program's 79-year history to witness what they fight for 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 
For the first time in Bengal Bouts' history, five Notre Dame boxers set their gloves aside to witness first-hand what it is that they are really fighting for in poverty-stricken Bangladesh last summer. 
The boxers' trip to Bangladesh provided the opportunity to experience how the money raised from the competition benefits people in the impoverished country, said senior and Bengal Bouts presi­dent Mark Weber. 
"In our 79 years of service to Bangladesh. not a single boxer had ever actually set foot in the country," he safd. "There were many reasons I felt this needed to change -as a stu­dent, I saw the potential to provide a tremendous educa­tional experience for our box­ers; as the president of Bengal Bouts, I saw the opportunity to transform our connection with Bangladesh from a mere 

check into a  real relatio n­ 
ship."  
Senior  captain  Leo  

Rubinkowski, senior Tomas Castillo, senior Patrick Martin and alumnus Patrick Ryan accompanied Weber on the trip. 
Castillo said the trip was a chance to understand what he had been fighting while boxing at Notre Dame. . 
''I've been part of the Boxing Club for four years. It meant a lot to be able to box for a good cause, and I was interested in knowing what we really do

INSIDE COLUMN 
Pondering Poke111on 

I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the societal ramifications of a seemingly innocuous cultural phe­nomenon from our past: Pokemon. 
You could tell a lot about someone 

by their choice of starting Joey Kuhn Pokemon. The most popular Scene Writer choice by far was Charmander, because it would evolve into a Charizard, a lean, ferocious, fire-breathing dragon. Who wouldn't want a Charizard? Charizard was hot. Charizard was sexy. Charizard was sleek, powerful, and utterly destruc­tive. The second most popular choice was Squirtle, which looked too cute as a baby to win any battles, but eventu­ally it would evolve into Blastoise, a tank of a turtle with huge water can­nons on its back. In last place was Bulbasaur, which would become Venusaur, a clumsy-looking lout with a giant flower growing on its back. 
The people who picked Charmanders were the kind with the competitive edge, the killer instinct, the drive to win. They were the Ferrari drivers, the supermodel wife­flaunters. Those who went with Squirtle were a little more temperate; they would be likely to drive some­thing big and powerful but still some­what practical, like a Toyota Land Cruiser. But who would choose Bulbasaur? Maybe they were not into brute force, preferring a good game of chess to rugby. Maybe they wanted more of a strategic challenge. Maybe they did it out of spite for the main­stream majority. Or maybe they just felt a special empathy with Bulbasaur because they knew how it felt to be picked last in gym class.They would be the ones to drive a beat-up old minivan, and if you criticized that minivan, they would defend it with all their heart. They possessed true com­passion, true spunk, and true fire. 
Alright, you got me. I picked Bulbasaur, and my Pokemon career consequently crashed and burned faster than the American economy. I justify myself, though, by telling myself that I stuck to the honorable tenets of peace and knowledge. When you are growing up, adults are always telling you to "treat others as you want to be treated" and trying to "instill a love of learning" in you. Pokemon similarly lures new players in with a seemingly mild motto: "Gotta catch 'em all!" The ostensible objective of the game is to collect specimens to fill out your Pokedex for research purposes. As the plotline progresses though, you find your Ash or Gary quickly losing sight of his scholarly ideals and sliding instead into the mere pursuit of power and glory. The de facto motto of the game is "Gotta beat 'em all!" 
Pokemon may have indirectly caused the current crisis on Wall Street. No wait, that's not what I'm trying to say. I guess it's just that Pokemon can be seen as an indicator of many of the ills of our society. No ... that's not it either. Maybe I'm say­ing that almost anything can be (ridiculously) stretched into an extended metaphor for life? Nah, just forget it. I need to get back to Grand Theft Auto 4 anyway. .

Man  tries  to  steal  
customer's laptop  
BRADENTON, Fla.  - 

Sheriff's officers said a 19­year-old man snatched a Starbucks customer's laptop after being told he could not use it to check his Facebook account. According to offi­cers, the man then grabbed the customer's laptop and ran out of the coffee shop, located in an outlet mall. 
Two people in the parking lot tackled the man and held him there until a mall secu­rity guard arrived. 
The victim got his laptop back and the man was charged Saturday with rob­bery by sudden snatching, a felony. 
Fish pedicures banned In Rorlda 
TALLAHASSEE -A trendy pedicure with fish that nib­ble dead skin from the feet has been nipped in the bud. The Florida Board of Cosmetology has banned the procedure, even before it was known to be offered anywhere in the state. The board said salons had been inquiring about its legality and decided to preemptively strike. 
The treatment is popular in Asia and has spread to some U.S. cities. A client sticks feet, hands or other body parts in a bowl or pool, and the small fish chow down on soft decaying skin.

Profs debate green economy 
By MOLLY MADDEN 
News Wrirer 
Two University professors presented differing viewpoints on how environmental and eco­nomic issues are affecting the United States at a lecture Monday. 
Engineering professor Frank Incropera spoke of taking measures to preserve the envi­ronment and the present fuel situation that affect the United States and the global communi­ty. 
"In my mind, energy is as critical as an issue today as food and shelter," Incropera said. 
Incropera said while mother countries in the world rely on tenewable energy resources as 
a power source, the United States depends on non­renewable sources for 80 percent of its energy needs. 
"These are finite resources," Incropera said. "At some point we are going to reach our peak productivity with each of the

Incropera said it will be difficult to begin depend­ing on other energy sources because the United States will be starting from such a small scale.

wind power only accounts for 
about two per­cent," he said. 
Incropera compared the American views on alternative energy sources to those of other countries. 
"European countries that have invested in these alternative fuel technolo­gies are at the 
cutting edge of this develop­ment," Incropera said. "In terms of economic growth, the United States is incredibly behind. When the time comes and we adapt to these new technologies, we're going to have to import everything." 
even if we fuels. "If the 
resources begin to run out, the price will go up and get so high that no one will buy them thereby forcing us into invest­ing in alternative fuels," Dutt said. 
Dutt also said that despite the good that can come from alter­native fuel technologies, the cost might outweigh the possi­ble positive outc6mes that can arise. 
"We know that technology can be created that can cut down on pollution, but you have to consider the cost," he said. "You have to consider the cost to society as a whole as well."

Professor returns to SMC to share vvorks

NewsWrirer 
With the support of the English Department and the Center for Academic Innovation, professor and author Kirsten Sundberg Lunstrum returned to Saint Mary's to give students a sample of her fiction·read­ing Monday. 
Lunstrum, who previously taught in the College's English Department, read an excerpt titled "Familial Kindness" from her newly published short story col­
lection "Swimming w i t h Strangers" and an excerpt from the preface of the novel she has been working on for the past year. 
Lunstrum, who is cur­rently ass"is­tant professor 

ers, Mr. Ander, Lunstrum said. 
She said she chose to write this novel in third­person plural voice from the point of view of other girls who have attended the same school and are pass­ing the story of these par­ticular girls to others. 
The novel is a story of the relationship between the girls and the wife of their teacher. The wife is envi­ous of the youth and their freedom, while the girls are fascinated with her because she is the ideal woman, Lunstrum said. 
"Read. I think you only come to writing ifyou love to read and you only become a better writer ifyou continue to read.,, 
Kirsten Lunstrum creative writing professor 
of creative writing at Purchase College in New York, said she was glad to be back at Saint Mary's. 
"I am very homesick for Saint Mary's often; it's a treat to be back," Lunstrum said.

BOG considers beauty conference 
By SARAH MAYER NewsWrirer 
Senior communications major Emma Farrell asked the Saint Mary's Board of Governance (BOG) for a co-sponsorship to help spon,sor a female beauty conference at their meeting this week. 
The conference, in its second year, will be held in the Student Center later this spring. 
Farrell said she hopes the conference will "deepen the understanding of what being a woman means while trying to resist what makes a woman -seem to be." 
In other BOG news: 
+Technology commissioner Deirdre Hayden said she will be meeting with the Information Technology department at the College to find out how much it would cost to put a printer in the Student Center. 
+Michele Peterson, the Student Activities Board (SAB) president, said SAB went to the National Association for Campus Activities conference in NashviHe, Tenn. two weeks ago. She said the group brought back many new ideas to bring to Saint Mary's. Peterson said the group was interested in ideas like a Def Jam poet and a magician.

According to Lee, certain celebrities, like Poorman and Hesburgh, are regulars to the Meal Auction. Poorman always hosts an "exciting" meal. she said. 
"Last year, I think he took [the winners] to the football changing rooms," Lee said. "This year, he's taking people to the tunnels of South Quad." 
Those who win a meal with Poorman will have the chance to see the tunnels underneath South Quad, and then dine in the Main Building. 
The winners will also have the opportunity to "elimb up the bell tower to ring the bells in the Basiliea." Lee said. 
Those who win a meal with the trombone section will enjoy a cookout at one of the band houses, according to Lee. 
In addition to the live auction for meals, which will take place in the LaFortune Ballroom, a silent auction will take place in the Dooley Room of LaFortune, where people can bid on gift certificates and baskets. 
Gift certificates will be o!Tered to a variety of business­es, including Five Guys, Chick­Fil-A, Applebee's and Kr:ispy Krome. 
"Every cent that we earn goes to Meals on Wheels," Lee said. 
They chose to make dona­tions to Meals on Wheels, according to Lee, because "it kind of fit with the whole theme of the meal auction." 
"You bid on a meal with a cel!'brity and the money that you pay goes to a meal that somebody else will be using," she said. 
Lee also said that because the auction will take place qn Ash Wednesday, no food will be served out of respect for those who choose to fast. 
"It really brings into the fore­front that you are fasting and the money you are raising will go ... to people who don't have as much opportunity as us to get meals," Lee said.

Report on tainted blood released 
LONDON -The first extensive report into Britain's tainted blood scandal stopped short Monday of blaming individual doctors or companies for what is widely viewed as the National Health Service's worst treatment disaster. 
House of Lords member Peter Archer's report called the scandal a "horrific human tragedy" but did not name any specific med­ical workers or pharmaceutical companies as being responsible for the deaths of around 
2.000 hemophiliacs since the 1970s.

ATHENS -The helicopter company offered "escapes ... to idyllic destina­tions." But this wasn't the kind of flight it had in mind. 
For the second time in nearly three years, a notorious bank robber was lifted out of a prison where he was being held along with his Albanian accomplice in a rented chopper amid fire from prison guards. Within hours, hundreds of people had joined more than a dozen fan clubs on Facebook celebrating the pair. 
Police launched a massive manhunt Monday for Vassilis Paleokostas -the robber hailed by some Greeks as a mod­ern-day Robin Hood -and accomplice Alket Rizaj, throwing up roadblocks and checking the abandoned helicopter for fingerprints and DNA. 
Police also announced the arrest of four prison guards and the helicopter pilot, who was found bound, gagged and with a hood over his head. The pilot said he had been hijacked by a man and a woman brandishing an assault rifle and a hand grenade.

Justice Deparbnent seeks new ruling 
RICHMOND -The Department of Justice on Monday asked a full appeals court to rule that the federal government has the power to hold sex offenders in custody indefinitely beyond the end of their prison terms. 
The filing seeks the reversal of a three­judge panel's ruling last month that Congress overstepped its authority when it allowed civil commitment of "sexually dan­gerous" federal inmates. The panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that the law intrudes on police powers that the Constitution reserves for states, many of which have their own similar statutes. 
In asking the full 4th Circuit to rehear the case, the government argues that it assumes responsibility for inmates in feder­al custody and should be allowed to "create civil commitment procedures for such per­sons to protect the public safety." 
Priest found guilty of embezzelment 
WEST PALM BEACH -A jury convicted a Florida priest on Monday of stealing from his church, but the panel found that he embezzled far less than the $488,000 prosecutors charged.

Timothy M. Dolan, 59, was named by Pope Benedict XVI on Monday to what is perhaps the most influential post in American Catholicism. At a news con­ference, Dolan pledged "my life, my heart, my soul" to the 2.5 million parishioners of the archdiocese, the nation's second-largest after Los Angeles. 
Dolan, currently the arch­bishop of Milwaukee, will succeed the retiring Cardinal Edward Egan, 76, who has led the Archdiocese of New York for nearly nine years. Dolan will be installed April 15. 
"He's going to defend and promote church orthodoxy," said David Gibson, a former Vatican Radio journalist. "But he's a friendly guy who knows how to translate that into a real kind of pastoral presence."

found guilty of that particular violation. 
The ticket of Kevin Kimberly, Alexa Doyle, Dylan Fernandez and Rachel Roseberry had two additional allegations brought against them, and was found guilty of both violations, Perez said. 
The allegations caused two special sessions of the Executive Committee of Judicial Cotmcil, one at 7 a.m. Monday, and another at 11:30 p.m. Monday. 
Of the 1292 votes cast in the race, 120 voted to abstain, 511 voted for the ticket led by Kimberly, and 611 voted for the Caitlin Pulte, Henry Shine, Luke Stavole and Tllll Castellini tick­et. 
The Pulte ticket received 47.3 percent of the vote, and the Kimberly ticket received 39.5 percent of the vote. The remaining votes were cast to abstain. 
Perez said because the Kimberly ticket was found guilty of two election violations, the Executive Committee deliv­ered a sanction against the tick­et. Kimberly and his running mates will not be allowed to spend any remaining campaign money between now and the run-off. All tickets are restricted to spending $75, which is pro­vided for the election. 
Perez said the sanction also included restriction of addition­al campaigning to word of mouth and the social network­ing Web site Facebook.com,

"It's a great charity," Wolbeck said. "And it pro­motes self-esteem and confi­dence in the young kids as well as basketball skills." 
The first event of the night featured two open games of Knockout with a prize of free tournament registration for the winner. Senior Alex Klupchak won the first game, and junior Hyan Hornacek took second place. Klupchak said his team hasn't decided on a name, while Hornacek's squad will be called the "Monstars." 
Ackerman, Malloy and Timmermans were up next for a game of "Horse." Despite several high-difficulty shot attempts, including one attempted off-the-wall header, Ackerman was eliminated ftrst. 
"!Malloy and Timmermans] are just fantastic players with a great basketball background and I just came out here to be a part of it," he said. 
Timmermans won the matchup against Malloy by hitting a shot from behind the backboard. Despite the loss, Malloy said he was excited about the upcoming tourna­ment. 
''I've probably played in more Bookstore tournaments than anybody," he said. "At least I'm in the top-10." 
Malloy said his favorite Bookstore Basketball memory is from a tournament during his time as president of the University. His team, "All the President's Men," was playing a first-round game against a team of his niece and her roommates. After letting his where the ticket has a group page titled "Kimberly-Doyle­Roseberry-Fernandez for Junior Class Council." 
Perez said the ticket would not be allowed to use any other method<; of online campaigning. Existing posters can remain posted, he said. 
Perez told The Observer he was not aware if the ticket had funds leftover. 
Perez said he could not reveal the nature of any of the violations or allegations, nor could he reveal who brought the allegations, according to guidelines set forth in the Student Constitution. 
Additionally, Judicial Council president George Chamberlain said the information couldn't be released in order to protect the candidates. 
"It's important that we pro­tect the integrity of the candi­dates," he said. Revealing the nature of the violations or alle­gations could further damage the campaigns, he added. 
The tickets were e-mailed of the decisions of the Executive Committee shortly after 1 a.m. The results of the election ­which were sealed until the allegations were resolved ­were then unsealed. 
Perez e-mailed the results of the election to the tickets around 1:30 a.m. and notified them that the run-off would take place Thursday. 
The run-off election will take place Thursday online from 8 
a.m. to 8 p.m. Students will be notified of election procedures via e-mail.

"Nobody knew it was my niece, so it looked like I was mauling some co-ed student," Malloy said with a laugh. 
The final contest of the night was a "Hot Spot" competition fought among about a dozen students for the prize of free tournament registration. Freshman Michael Jackson won the event, draining three straight three-pointers in the fmal seconds to secure victory. 
"I wasn't even thinking," Jackson said. "Just look at the basket, shoot the ball and keep going." 
The Tipoff event was hosted by Notre Dame basketball players Zach llillesland and Hyan Ayers. They are undecid­ed on whether they will partic­ipate in this year's tourna­ment, even though they are eligible as seniors. Hillesland and Ayers said they have enjoyed watching coaches and former players compete in Bookstore games in past years. 
"It's always fun watching the old guys get up and down a lit­tle bit," Ayers said. 
Even as a player who has battled Big East heavyweights, Hillesland said he was impressed with the quality of play in the Bookstore Tournament. 
"There's a lot of good talent from what I've seen," he said. "Especially towards the later rounds, the games are really exciting and entertaining." 
Wolbeck said the Tipoff was a success and the Bookstore Basketball organization would try to build on it in upcoming years.

Catherine Soler and her run­ning mates Jay Kenney, Ben German and Shannon Crotty won the race for sophomore class council with 55.5 percent, amounting to 609 votes of the 1096 cast in the election.

Soler, currently a member of freshman class council, respond­ed to concerns raised by compet­ing tickets that the current fresh­man class council is a "clique." 
"The clique is really a miscon­ception," she said. "It's by now means exclusive or anything like that." 
"One of our main goals is to increase the diversity on the council and hope that all who are interested in class council feel encouraged to apply," she said. 
Soler said she was "happy" with the results. 
"We are looking forward to fol­lowing out the ideas on our plat­form," she said.

IN BRIEF 
President to slash budget deficit 
WASHINGTON -Urging strict future restraint even as current spending soars, President Barack Obama pledged on Monday to dramatically slash the skyrocketing annual budget deficit as he started to dole out the record $787 billion eco­nomic stimulus package he signed last week. 
"If we confront this crisis without also con­fronting the deficits that helped cause it, we risk sinking into another crisis down the road," the president warned, promising to cut the yearly deficit in half by the end of his four-year term. "We cannot simply spend as we please and defer the consequences." 
He said he would reinstitute a pay-as-you-go rule that calls for spending reductions to match increases and would shun what he said were the past few years' "casual dishonesty of hiding irre­sponsible spending with clever accounting tricks." He called the long-term solvency of Sucial Security "the single most pressing fiscal chal­lenge we face by far" and said reforming health care, including burgeoning entitlement pro­grams, was a huge priority. 
Fmancier selected to assist Geithner 
WASHINGTON -The White House selected a Wall Street financier on Monday to advise Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on the restructuring of General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC. 
Steven Rattner, co-founder of Quadrangle Group LLC, will serve as counselor to Geithner, who is leading an auto industry task force charged with shaping the future ofGM and Chrysler. 
The White House said in a statement that Rattner would advise Geithner "on a variety of economic and financial matters, and will lead the Treasury's efforts with regard to the automobile sector." 
Rattner had been a leading candidate to become the so-called "car czar." But President Barack Obama decided instead to create a task force led by Geithner and White House economic aide Larry Summers to review $17.4 billion in federal loans to GM and Chrysler and their requests for billions more in aid. 
Quadrangle Group said Monday that Rattner was leaving his role as managing principal of the firm to take the Treasury position.

Official predicts Locke as next pick

WASHINGTON 
President Barack Obama's 
likely third pick for 
Commerce secretary is for­
mer Washington Gov. Gary 
Locke, a senior adminis­
tration official said 
Monday. 
Locke, a Democrat, was the nation's first Chinese­American governor when he served two terms in the Washington statehouse from 1997 to 2005. 
Obama's expected choice of Locke arose less than two weeks after his most recent pick, Republican Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, backed out. Just over a week after Obama named him and he accepted, Gregg cited "irresolvable conflicts" with the policies of the Democratic president. 
Tho official spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcement has not yet been made. 
Obama originally gave the post, which requires Senate confirmation. to New Mexico Gov. Bill Hichardson. He withdrew in January, before Obama took oflice, after the disclo­sure that a grand jury is investigating allegations of wrongdoing in the award­ing of contracts in his state.

Government expands b~ ownership 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The govern­ment on Monday moved toward dramatically expanding its owner­ship stakes in the nation's banks ­with Citigroup, the struggling titan of the industry, apparently at the top of the list. 
Wall Street responded as it has with the rollout of almost every other plan to fix the financial cri­sis, taking a big drop and sending the Dow Jones industrials to its lowest level in a dozen years. 
The Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and other banking regulators said they could convert the government's stock in the banks from preferred shares to common shares. 
The strategy, which could be applied retroactively to banks that 
received money in the first incar­
nation of the bailout, carries risks. 
But it avoids, at least for now, hav­
ing to tap more taxpayer money or 
resort to full-fledged nationaliza­
tion. 
Citigroup Inc. -perhaps the 
biggest name in American banking 
-has approached the regulators 
about ways the government could 
help strengthen the bank, includ­
ing the stock conversion plan, 
according to people familiar with 
the discussions. They spoke on 
condition of anonymity because 
they are not authorized to speak 
on behalf of the government or the 
company. A Citigroup spokesman 
declined comment. 
The stock conversion could be 
available for other banks as well, 
the same sources said. , Regulators, reinforcing what the White House has said, insisted that keeping banks private is a priority. But fe.deral officials are walking a difficult line because the govern­ment could still have huge stakes i11 banks. 

Citigroup already has received $45 billion in bailout money, plus guarantees to cover losses on hun­dreds of billions of dollars in risky investments. 
"What we are doing·here is we're creeping our way toward national­ization," said Terry Connelly, dean of Golden Gate University's Ageno School of Business in San Francisco. 
The conversion plan would give the government greater flexibility in dealing with ailing banks. It would give the government voting shares, and therefore more say in a bank's operations.

Grandma has a problem. The Feds, it appears, are about to ration her health care. That could turn out her lights. The Obama stimulus package creates a new bureaucracy under a National 
Coordinator for Health Information Technology. [Sees. 3000-3018.] The Coordinator is mandated to devel­op an infrastruc­ture that "reduces health care costs 

resulting from inef-Charles E. Rice ficiency [and] inap­propriate care .... " 
Right or
[Sec. 3001(b)(3).] 
Wrong?
Medicare currently pays for treatments that are safe and effective. The stimulus opens the door to a cost-efl'ectiveness stan­dard pursuant to guidelines set by the bureaucracy. Under such a standard the availability of care could turn on Grandma's age, her productivity, etc. The recession will intensifY pressure to reduce medical spending on non-productive por­sons. In that game a 75 year-old woman seeking a substantial medical procedure will be a predictable loser. 
A later column will discuss the stimulus in detail. For now, let's ask: II' Grandma is denied a needed operation and is home in bed with no hope of recovery, can you put her out of her misery? If she is on a feed­ing tube, can you withdraw it? Suppose she wants to die? The stimulus provides an added reason to address these issues, but they already arise with patients of all ages who are incurable, incompetent, or both. 
The legal and moral principles are clear. A competent adult has the legal right to rel'use any and all medical treatment, including the right to refuse food and water whether naturally or artificially pro­vided. If a patient is incompetent, the law permits withholding of treatment, induct­ing food and water, based on the patient's intent previously expressed in an advance directive or otherwise, or based on his health care agent's opinion that the patient would want such withdrawal or, in some states, that it would be in his best interest. 
The moral principles are dearly present­ed in Catholic teaching. First, you never have the right intentionally to kill the patient. "[T]he direct and voluntary killing of an innocent human being is always gravely immoral." Evangelium Vitae (EV), 
57. This includes euthanasia, "an act or omission which, of itself or by intention, causes death in order to eliminate suffer­ing." Catechism (CCC), 2277. The Catechism calls it "murder." 
With respect to medical treatments, we have a duty to use all ordinary and propor­tionate means to preserve our own lives and the lives of those in our care. See CCC, 2276-79. "[M]edieal procedures that are "burdensome, dangerous, extraordinary or disproportionate" are not morally oblig­atory. CCC, 2278. 
The main issues involve palliative care and the withdrawal of nutrition and hydra­tion. In Vacco v. Quill, in 1997, the Supreme Court said a State "may permit palliative care" ol'patients to relieve their pain, even though it "may have the fore­seen but unintended 'double effect' of has­tening the patient's death." According to Catholic teaching, palliative care may be so administered to relieve pain even though it hastens the unintended death of the patient. But it cannot be used with the intent to kill the patient. The law, however, cannot ordinarily determine whether the palliative care was given to relieve pain or to cause death. Where the family and caregivers a1:,rree that it is time for the patient to die, the administration of mor­phine or other palliatives can be a mode of homieidn elli~ctively beyond the reach of the law. 
On nutrition and hydration, if a patient refuses lillld and water with the intent to die, it is a form ol' suicide which "is always as morally objectionable as murder." EV. 66. 
In the Terri Schiavo ease, Judge Greer ordered, and not merely authorized, Michael Schiavo to remove not only the li.~eding tube but all forms of "nutrition and hydration" from his wife. The only reason you heard about Terri Schiavo was because the family members disagreed. When the family and caregivers agree that the patient should die, he can be legally executed by withdrawal of l'ood and water. There arn no statistics but it is fair to assume that such executions are numer­ous and perhaps routine. 
The Congregation for the Doctrine ol' the Faith (CDF), with the approval of Pope Benedi~;t XVI, issued a statement on August 1, 2007 (L'Osservatore Romano (English), Sept. 19, 2007) on "the nutrition and hydration of patients in ... a 'vegeta­tive state."' The principles apply to all patients in whatever condition. The CDF posod and answered two questions: 
"First question: Is the administration of food and water (whether by natural or artificial means) to a patient in a 'vegeta­tive state' morally obligatory except when they cannot be assimilated by the patient's body or cannot be administered to the patient without causing significant physical discomfort? 

"Hesponse: Yes. The administration of liJOd and water even by artificial means is, in principle, an ordinary and proportionate means of preserving life. It is therefore obligatory to the extent to which, and for as long as, it is shown to accomplish its proper finality, which is the hydration and nourishment of the patient. In this way suflering and death by starvation and dehydration are prevented.

A feeding tube is not intended to cure the cancer or other disease. Its purpose is nourishment and the prevention of suffer­ing from hunger and thirst.

One could apparently also be justified in removing the tube in the closing minutes before death when the lack of food and water will not cause dis­comfort and will not contribute to the death, subject to the duty to put it back if the expected death does not occur. The fact Grandma is incurable or will never recover consciousness does not justifY starving or dehydrating her to death. To remove a feeding tube with the intent to end Grandma's life is "murder."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Dude, -where's tny freedotn? 

Insulated in our Notre Dame bubble, we have been argu­ing over whether we should condemn Michael Phelps for taking bong rips, or ifa boycott of Subway is more bologna than is fit t6 consume. However, I feel that we are missing out on a far more important story. 
Geert Wilders, a freely and democratically elected mem­ber of Dutch parliament was invited to the British House of Lords to screen his controversial, anti-Islamic film Fitna (available on YouTube) and to discuss his views with his hosts. On February 11, Wilders was detained when his flight landed at Heathrow Airport and immediately sent back to the Netherlands due to a ban by the British Home Offic~. which claimed that his presence would "threaten communi­ty harmony and therefore public security in the U.K." Perhaps this view was reached in part after Lord Nazir Ahmed, the only Muslim member ofthe House of Lords, threatened to mobilize 10,000 Muslims to prevent Wilders from entering the House. Ahmed quickly turned to the Pakistani press to promote this "victory for the Muslim com­munity." 
It seems strange that a victory for any community would come after a defeat for freedom of speech, about which he said, "Freedom of speech is alright so long as it doesn't come at my expense." In the words ofNoam Chomsky, "If we don't believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it at all." Unsurprisingly, there has been no similar move to protect "community harmony" by stopping extremists who actually promise violence in the streets of London, and other European capitals, commonly chanting such fun phrases as: "Bomb, bomb (country of choice)" and 
Responsible potheads 

As a reader with an open mind, I'd like to voice some of the concerns that I have with Daniel Tostado's article "'Reefer Madness' is insalubri­ous" (Feb. 20th). There seems to be a misconcep­tion between an individual that is irresponsible and an individual that is a pothead. 
Let's clarify some issues: a father that can't quit smoking weed -irresponsible; a person that gets high -pothead; a friend that continually tries to rob a liquor store-irresponsible (and stupid); a person that smokes weed -pothead. This last one is a little confusing so try to stay with me: a person that develops 'amotivational syndrome' and loses interest in everyday activi­ties because of a drug they are choosing to do ­irresponsible; a person that goes to class, main­tains healthy relationships, is active in sports, and chooses to smoke marijuana in their free time ­a responsible pothead. 
I know, it is difficult to comprehend such an oxymoronic statement -"A responsible pothead? Yeah right, get real." Careful though, we wouldn't want to form any prejudices. It would be wrong · to categorize all potheads as drug addicts, crimi­nals, and misfits. Potheads are people that like to smoke weed and get high. Sometimes they will even go to a movie, or out to eat. Maybe they will just sit around and watch T.V., or listen to music. Or (and I know this might be surprising) they 
might even do something productive. You·see, just because a person is a pothead doesn't mean that they are going to fail out of 
· school, let down their family, lose all their friends, and repeatedly try to rob a liquor store (or any other business venue for that matter). It might even be possible that a person who smokes grass could do something as extraordinary as be admitted to Notre Dame! Here we go again­"Haha, yeah right. Yeah right! Like their half­baked ideas and amotivation would meet the standards of this University!" False. Some responsible people can do bizarre things like smoke weed and not be academically, socially, and physically impaired. Dare I say it? Yes. You even go to school with some of these people -and they are just as smart, suave, and spiritual as you are. Just like no one ever hears about the functioning alcoholic, no one ever hears about the functioning pothead, but they do exist. So, moving forward, let's refrain from using examples of irresponsible individuals as a stan­dard to measure an entire group of people ­now that's a half-baked idea. ~ 
Michael Hubert freshman Dillon Feb. 16 

Somewhere along the way I actually learned the les­son we have all heard before: If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. And yet, we live in the age of JuicyCampus, or CollegeACB or whatever. And of letters of attack on one another in the form of letters to the editor. And of rumors. 
I could write about the moral fiber I thought this uni­versity was made of, how its students would rise above these actions, how it breaks my heart to see bad things happen to good people. I could write about the sinful "USA you will pay, the mujaheddin are on their way." So much for the dialogue promised by multiculturalism and political-correctness. 
European politicians have shown that not only are they too afraid to speak out on the increasing crisis around them, but that they would gladly trample such hallowed concepts as freedom of speech and expression to avoid upsetting an exploding Muslim electorate. The precedent set is a grim one indeed, but it is important to understand, as it just may enter this bubble of ours sooner than we think. 
Jay Rowley sophomore Morrissey Feb. 22 

Superpovver showdovvn 
In response to Jonathan Miller's Feb. 18th argument that telekinesis is irrefutably the superior superpower, I would like to submit my opinion that the ability to control time is far superior to any other power (including telekinesis). ·1 feel that your portrayal of telekinesis is rather extreme. The greatest flaw of your argument is the magnitude of the powers described. Moving objects with your mind must require knowl­edge of each atom and what is connected to it. Your talk of moving objects (specifically, removing your foe's organs) begins to sound not like telekinesis and more like teleportation. 
What I feel is the greatest flaw of your argument, however, is your omission of no doubt one of the greatest possible powers, time control. It may simply be your preference to move objects rather than stop time, but, just like telekinesis, time control can mimic-other less worthy pow­ers. Super speed can be mimicked by starting and stopping time rapidly while you move, strength by stopping time while you work out, and invisibility by simply stopping time while you perform whatever mali­cious deeds you like. As for taking down bad guys, the ability to stop time would also stop people in the middle of their motions. This would make epic battles between nemeses much less epic for you, but victory would no doubt be assured. 
I know that every person is entitled to his opiniOn, and that the argu­ment between all the superpowers will not be resolved by words; so, Jonathan, once we both get our wishes, I'll meet you out in Stepan Fields to settle this once and for all.

Next time you have some awful thing to say about a person, without knowing them truly and deeply, think about that person hearing or reading those words. See that person huddled into a corner of his or her loft, cry­ing. See that person holding the rope with which they plan on using to commit suicide. Because, that dramatic or not, do you want to risk your words being the ones that pushed that person over the edge? So be nice to one another. Or at least be neutral.

There is a great mother load of music out there. Everything exists. And because of the Internet, we can find it all, listen to it all, download it all and love it all. Literally millions of songs are at our finger-· . tips, if not billions. Stephame 
From the highly DePrez ranked iTunes top-Assistant pers to the crappy Scene Editor 
Garage Band upload on your cousin's music MySpace, music is being heard, inter­preted, reinvented and produced at a rate so rapid there is no guarantee any artist will survive more than a few weeks, or months if they are lucky. 
And if you miss an artist, too bad, because they're lost forever in the void of "Once Was Popular." 
With so many options, it's daunting to go fishing for anything new. We cling to iTunes charts and the radio to tell us what's good, because we haven't got a snowball's chance in Miami at finding it ourselves. At least, this is the thought of the music muggle. 
This means that even though the indie artist is free to write, record and produce their own full album, if they haven't got a way to market it to the masses, then their music is moot. It takes the music geek, the guru, to fish out new music, and then popularize it through blogs, file sharing, mixes and worcf'of mouth. Then, radios begin to pick it up and the ears at Spin Magazine perk up minutes before it bursts onto the scene. They get one to three hits on iTunes, perhaps a full album of popularity, some placement in ads and on "Gossip Girl," .and then begin to be dubbed "Known Music." 
This is the kiss of death. No one real­ly wants.to listen to "Known Music." It isn't popular enough to be Taylor Swift-ing its way into the hands and iPods of the muggles, but it is no longer indie-chic, and therefore the music geeks and tiber nerds won't touch it. And then, three years later, it gets dumped on Rolling Stone. 
Every so often, a band fished frorri the obscurity of its MySpace page will strike a real chord -or at least one that sounds different -and it will gain a true following of diehards. 
These are the bands that have stay­ing power, the ones that, in the end, really matter. 
The corporate system plucks unsus­pecting youngsters from their festering musical obscurity, dresses them up, tells them they're rock stars and spoon feeds them to the music muggles through movies, television and the radio. They play huge release concerts at Virgin and are begged to put their name on a fashion label. The muggles eat it up. The gurus scoff. 
The point, though, is that there is way too much music out there for all of this to matter. Even for most of it to matter. 
Music has one major flaw: it requires time. You need three minutes to listen to a song. You need 45 minutes to appreciate an album. And the only way to find music is to listen to it. We sim­ply cannot love that much music. There is a limit to what can be popular, because we can't listen to everything that "Should Be Popular." Even if every radio station everywhere never repeat­ed a song, we wouldn't be able to get through it all. 
No one would go for that anyway, because the beauty of music is falling in love with it, and a lot of times it isn't love at first sight. We need to sit with music, to live with it, to associate memories with it in order to claim it. And in the end, that's all we really want to do. 
Muggle or guru, we want music that's our own.

"If you're not bombing on a semi­regular basis, you're not trying hard enough as a comedian," he said. 
Comedy is all about finding new material, and the only way to do that is to go out on a limb at times. Still, this doesn't make bombing any easier.

Finnegan said he actually did not draw from other comedians that much. Instead, he was inspired more by gen-· res of entertainment, like music. Even watching a friend's professional dance troupe would feed his muse.

Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Marvin Harrison refused to take a pay cut. The Indianapolis Colts couldn't afford to keep him without one. 
On Monday, the two sides reached agreement on one thing: Harrison will be a free agent. 
Agent Tom Condon told The Associated Press that Indianapolis has agreed to release the franchise's all­time leading receiver, although an official announcement is not expected until Tuesday or Wednesday. 
The decision comes one day after team president Bill Pollan said he hoped to cut a deal that would keep Harrison in Indy. When Harrison said no, the Colts 
.. said farewell. "Basically, we were not able to come to any kind of agreement, it was not con­tentious and the Colts have agreed to release him," Condon said in a phone interview. Team officials declined comment and a message was left by The Associated Press at the office of team owner Jim Irsay. It's 11ot a surprising move because the Colts would save about $6 million, based on Harrison's base salary. They would still be charged for prorated bonuses from the $66 mil­

lion deal he signed in December 2004. 
The Colts found it too expensive for a 36-year-old receiver coming off one of the least productive seasons of his career. 
Harrison ranks second in NFL history with 1,102 receptions, and the move will disappoint many Colts fans, who embraced Harrison as a favorite. They referred to Harrison, Peyton Manning and Edgerrin James as "The Triplets," and Harrison was one of the franchise's most identifiable player in the last decade. 
His penchant for toe-tap­ping catches along the side­line and incredible grabs in the middle of the field 
IN BRIEF Jenkins attempts to quell
NFL doubts about size INDIANAPOLIS -Malcolm Jenkins hears the questions constantly. 
Maybe, the doubters suggest, he's not quick enough to play cornerback in the NFL. Maybe, at his listed size of 6 feet 1, 201 pounds, he'd be a better safety. Maybe he should have skipped that senior season and put those debates to rest. 
Jenkins believes he can answer any question scouts have for him at the NFL's annual scouting combine. If they want more proof, Jenkins suggests they review his game tapes -or pay attention to what he says. 
"If you put on a film of a guy who's about 5-10, 185, I'm doing the same things they're doing at my size," he said. "In the league now, you've got receivers that are getting bigger and more physical and that's what you need -a guy that can do it all. With my size and speed, it's something rare you really don't find around the nation." 
Rangers fire Renney after 
twefve game tailspin 
NEW YORK -Tom Renney was fired as coach of the New York Rangers on Monday and replaced by John Tortorella in an attempt to save a season that has spiraled out of con­trol. 
· The Rangers opened 10-2-1, but 10 losses in the last 12 games have knocked the team out of contention for the Atlantic Division title and placed it in danger of missing the playoffs completely. 
Tortorella led the Tampa Bay Lightning to the Stanley Cup title in 2004 and was let go following last season. The Rangers were not required to provide compensation to the lightning. 
Renney, a former coach of the Vancouver Canucks, was 164-121-42 with the Rangers in four-plus seasons and ranks fourth on the team's career wins and games coached lists. 
In recent home games, fans had chanted for Renney's dismissal. 
helped the Colts build one of the league's most successful franchises in this decade. 
But longtime teammates understood why Harrison wanted to become a free agent. 
"I think whatever Marvin chooses to do for himself, he has to do," center Jeff Saturday said Sunday night. "I love Marvin as a friend and as a teammate." 
Indianapolis took Harrison in the first round of the 1996 draft and when Manning arrived two years later, the tandem began a record-setting journey. 
They combined for more completions, yardage and touchdowns than any duo in league history. 

Crabtree addresses foot 
stress fracture worries 
INDIANAPOLIS -Michael Crabttee was quick on his feet Sunday, and if he does the same thing for NFL scouts next month the stress fracture in his left foot might soon be forgotten. 
In an odd scene at the league's annual scouting combine, Crabtree strolled quickly across the media room moments after Patriots coach Bill Belichick finished speaking. He walked up a couple of steps, smiled at reporters and then gave a 20-second statement confirming the decision to delay surgery so he could run in front of scouts during next month's person­al workout. 
"It's an old injury that I've been hav­ing, but I never had any pain in it," he said. "I will run my 40, and after that I will have surgery." 
With that, Crabtree exited stage left, taking no questions. 
Clearly, it was an effort to stem the fallout that began Saturday when it was revealed he needed surgery.

WASHINGTON Louisville is in a crazy­good race for the regular­season championship of the Big East, where four of the nation's top eight teams sit atop the standings. 
Georgetown, the two-time defending regular-season champion, is not a member of that quartet. The Hoyas are all but conceding that their only road to the NCAA tournament runs through the conference tournament at Madison Square Garden.

The loss also dropped the Hoyas to 12th place in the Big East, just six weeks after they were ranked No. 9 in the country.

The marksmanship was more of a necessity than a luxury because they were so careless with the ball, but the initial shooting burst was enough to build a lead that kept Georgetown at bay throughout the second half.

Samardo Samuels, Terrence Williams and Preston Knowles added 10 points apiece for the Cardinals, who had a 17­point first-half lead cut to eight in the second half.

The Cardinals started the second half with turnovers on their first three posses­sions, but Georgetown could only cut the deficit to eight.

NBA 
Robinson's 41 leads Knicks past Pacers 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -In another spectacular offensive perform­ance, Nate Robinson's biggest play came with a return to his defensive roots. 
Robinson scored a season-high 41 points, including the tiebreak­ing layup with 26 seconds left, and the New York Knicks beat the short-handed Indiana Pacers 123-119 Monday night. 
Robinson scored 32 in the sec­ond half and matched Bob McAdoo's franchise record for most points in a game by a reserve. His final bucket came when he picked off an errant pass, just as he did twice in 2002 when he played for the University of Washington as a defensive back. 
"That interception definitely would have been for six to the house," Robinson said. "Would have got a flag for celebrating, but it's OK." 
He kept the celebration going after the game, giving actor Will Ferrell, whom he befriended last year and was sitting courtside, the green jersey he wore to win the slam dunk jersey at All-Star weekend. That's just one of the highlights of a month that has seen Robinson score 30 or more points four times in the last six games. 
"He's been on a dramatic tear since the All-Star break and he had another great perform­ance," Indiana's Jarrett Jack said. 
Al Harrington added 27 points and David Lee had 20 points and 13 rebounds for the Knicks. helping the Knicks pull out a game against a team that was missing most of its best players. 
"That should have been a game that we should have won handily tonight with them having their two best players out, but any time you keep it close like that they have some shotmakers on their team," said Lee, who had his 20th straight double­double. "So it was too close for comfort tonight, but I'm just glad we got a win." 
Jack scored a season-high 33 points and Marquis Daniels matched a season best with 28 for the Pacers, who had won two in a row overall and four in a row at Madison Square Garden. They fell to 4-2 when playing without both All-Star Danny Granger and Mike Dunleavy. 
The Knicks led for most of the fourth quarter but couldn't con­tain Jack, who had his previous season high here last month when he capped a 29-point per­formance with the winning jumper with 0. 9 seconds left. Indiana had the ball in the front court and a chance for the lead, but Jeff Foster threw away an inbounds pass and Robinson tracked it down before streaking in for a layup and a 121-119 lead. 
"I was in trouble getting open," Jack said. "Jeff thought someone was going one way and he threw it up there and (Robinson) was able to get the steal." 
Troy Murphy, who had 19 points and 21 rebounds, traveled on the next possession, and Robinson knocked down a pair of free throws for the final mar­gin. 
The Pacers were already with­out Granger (torn right foot ten­don) and Dunleavy, who coach Jim O'Brien said he expects will miss the rest of the season with an injured right knee. Then they were forced to go without point guard T.J. Ford, who was expected to play but couldn't because of the flu. 
"I thought we played a very spirited game, played with a lot of guts," O'Brien said. "We were missing three starters. We played well enough to win on the road, we just didn't pull it out at the end." 
The Knicks couldn't take advantage for most of the game, looking sluggish a day after a loss in Toronto. They eventually pulled it out behind Robinson, playing the best basketball of his career in the last couple of weeks, and surpassed last sea­son's total with their 24th victo­ry.

Belles Ineet Adrian in first round 
Saint Mary's will try to continue regular season success in MlAA tourney 
By BOBBY GRAHAM Sports Writer 
It has been a record­breaking season for the Saint Mary's basketball team. 
The Belles, under the direction of coach Jennifer Henley, registered 13 MIAA conference wins and 15 total wins, both of which are school records. However, the team is not content with all of its suc­cess. 
Tonight marks the begin­ning of the MIAA confer­ence tournament for the Belles, giving them another chance to make school his­tory. 
Saint Mary's (15-9 over­
all. 13-3 MIAA), which came up 1.5 games short of rival Hope College for the regular season champi­onship, will try to win the first MIAA tournament championship in its pro­gram's history. Since the tournament's inception in the early 1990s, the Belles have yet to reach the title game. 
The Belles' first step to achieving history comes tonight when they host Adrian College in the first round at the Angela Athletic Complex. 
Saint Mary's and Adrian squared off twice in the regular season, with the Belles getting the better of their opponent each time. Saint Mary's walked away with 74-69 and 77-71 wins earlier this year. 

The previous close matchups could possibly make this a trap game for Saint Mary's, which cannot afford to make many mis­takes if it expects to win. Several untimely miscues could end in an unfortunate opening-round loss for the favored Belles. 
All year, the Belles have looked to senior forward Erin Newsom to lead the team and she has done just that. Newsom came up huge in both of the previ­ous games against Adrian, scoring 15 and 22 points in the respective contests.

Wednesday night] first and keep improving our position and putting pressure on the committee and people above us in the standings and put our­selves in great position for [the Big East tournament in] New York." 
Added forward Luke Harangody: "We can't control it. All we can control is the next game. We can't look at that stuff and try to piece things together and figure out where we're going to come out." 
But at The Observer, we have no quibbles about analyzing the standings. Here's how everyone stacks up heading into the fmal few games: 
Fighting for first: No.2 Connecticut (25-2, 13-2), No. 6 Louisville (22-5, 13-2), No.1 Pittsburgh (22-5, 12-2), No.8 Marquette (23-4, 12-2) 
This race at the top is every­thing a college basketball fan could hope for. Four great teams, all tied in the loss col­umn, slugging it out for the title in the last few games. Marquette has the toughest remaining schedule -consid­ering its next three games are against Connecticut, Louisville and Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh and Connecticut still play each other one more time, this time in Pittsburgh, on March 4. Pittsburgh looks like it could win the national title right now, but if Pittsburgh and Louisville both win out, the Cardinals will hold the tiebreaker over the Syracuse and Cincinnati are Panthers for the No. 1 seed in the only two of this group that

Tournament and if the Mountaineers take care of business, they are in as well. West Virginia's remaining games are against Cincinnati, South Florida, DePaul and Louisville. The Mountaineers could go 4-0, but 3-1 is more likely. Worst casa scenario, they probably go 2-2, losing to Cincinnati and Louisville, but that would still put them at 10­8 in conference with 21 wins overall, giving them a solid shot at making the Tournament. 
Fighting for their lives: Providence (16-11, 8-7), Cincinnati (19-8, 7-7), Syracuse (17-10, 7-7), Notre Dame (15-10, 6-8) 
The top four teams may be duking it out for No. 1, but here's where the real nail-bit­ing will take place in the next two weeks. There's still time for each team to make a case for a Tournament bid with a strong finish to the regular sea­son and a couple wins in the conference tournament. 
Key games down the stretch: at home and 

travels to Villanova. Notre Dame has Connecticut in Storrs on Saturday and then Villanova at home next week. March Madness has come a little early for these teams. 
Too bad everyone goes to the Big East tournament: Seton Hall (14-12, 5-9), Georgetown (14-12, 5-10), St. John's (13-14, 4-10), South Aorida (8-18, 3-11), Rutgers (10-17, 1-13), DePaul (8-19, 0-14) 
Under previous Big East rules, there would be a dogfight this year for the 12th and fmal conference tournament posi­tion, with four teams still in the running for it. But since every­one goes to New York this year, there's no drama to speak of, just bad basketball.

of many hotly-contested bouts tonight. The rest of the 48 remaining boxers will fight for a place in the finals this weekend. 
Along with Bourroughs, there are seven more defend­ing champions stepping into the ring, including senior Kris Perez. Perez, who is undefeat­ed in his career, is going for his fourth straight title. He takes on Kieran Bulger in the 140-pound division semifinals tonight. 
Senior captains Mike Lee and Dan Rodgers are each trying to take the next step towards a third Bengal Bouts crown. Lee, who transferred to Notre Dame at the begin­ning of his sophomore year, is also undefeated in his career. Jim Hasson, who has won both of his fights this year in unanimous decisions, will try to hand Lee his first loss. 
Several other hungry fight­ers will vie for their first chance at a championship tonight. Some notable bouts include bruiser John Tchoula against the technical Rafael Diaz in the 185-pound divisio; a battle of senior veterans Patrick Kibbe and Brian DeSplinter in the 147-pound bracket; and lightweights Sean McNichols and Michael Sayles, who will square off in the second fight of the night.

with a fighter's attitude, having hung with the best team in the country. 
"We can play with an ath­letic team like this. We know that we can move the ball and get rebounds with an athletic team. We knpw that we can play with a team like this," Irish guard Ashley Barlow said in the postgame press conference. 
Now that the top dog is out of the way, the Irish can begin their three-game slugfest for seeding in the Big East tournament. The Orange are first on the docket. Syracuse sits tied with West Virginia for 11th place at 4-9 in the confer­ence and 15-11 overall. 
Although the tournament expanded to include all 16 teams this season, the Irish (sixth place at 18-7, 7-6) still have a chance to improve their seed. But they will likely need to win all of their remaining games to do so. 
Notre Dame is one game behind DePaul (20-7, 8-5). whose remaining games are against Marquette, South Florida and Cincinnati, teams in the middle or bot­tom of the conference. Notre Dame swept the season series with DePaul, but still needs the Blue Demons to lose at least one game to move up to the No. 5 seed. 
But first the Irish have to get past the Orange, who are led by senior Chandrea Jones. The 5-foot-9 guard 
leads the team in scoring 
(16. 7 points per game). rebounding (8.5) and 3­point field goal percentage (.314). 
Sophomore guard Erica Morrow has also lit up the scoreboard for Syracuse this season, averaging 16 points per game while shooting .295 from beyond the arch. This season, Morrow has taken 166 3-point attempts, compared to 297 by Notre Dame's entire roster. 
Notre Dame has spread the wealth offensively this season, and has four players scoring in double figures. Barlow leads the team with 
12.8 points per game, fol­lowed by senior guard Lindsay Schrader at 12.2, junior point guard Melissa Lechlitner at 10.7 and soph­omore forward Becca Bruszewski at 10.3. 
Bruszewski has been one of the top performers for the Irish of late, and had scored in double figures in five straight games before the Connecticut Joss, in which she managed just nine 
points. 
Irish coach Muffet 
McGraw attributed 
Bruszewski's recent success 
to her more relaxed 
approach to the game. 
"[Bruszewski is] just play­ing well in the last couple of games," McGraw said. "I think it's a little bit easier when you're a sophomore playing. You don't have quite the same pressure on you, you can just go out and play your game."

Harris hits half court shot, Nets beat 76ers 
Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -Devin Harris hit an unbe­lievable lunging half-court shot at the buzzer and the New Jersey Nets snapped a season-high five-game losing streak with a 98-96 victory over the slumping Philadelphia 76ers on Monday night. 
With players from both teams surrounding the scor­er's table, the referees watched replays of Harris' shot for nearly three minutes before signaling the basket was good. 
Seconds earlier, the 76ers seemingly nailed down the victory when Andre Iguodala sank the second of two free throws to give them a one­point lead with 1.8 seconds to play. 
The Nets quickly inbounded to Harris, who bobbled the ball after bumping with Iguodala and then heaved in the winner from in front of the scorer's table. 
Harris finished with a game-high 39 points, but his 22nd shot of the night will be one Nets fans remember, especially if it helps key a run to the playoffs. 
Vince Carter added 10 points, including a driving layup with 13.2 seconds to play that tied the game at 95. 

Philadelphia worked for a final shot and gave the ball to Iguodala, who led it with 21 points. He didn't begin his move down the left side of the lane until about 6 seconds remained on the clock and he got hit by Harris as he took the shot. 
Iguodala missed the first and made the second, setting the stage for Harris to steal the win and send the 76ers to their fourth straight loss, matching their season high. 
Andre Miller added 17 points and 10 assists for Philadelphia, while Willie Green and Thaddeus Young had 14 points apiece. Samuel Dalembert had 13 points and 10 rebounds as the 76ers lost to the Nets for the third time in as many games. 
The final 2 minutes seemed · to last forever, with the Sixers opening a 92-89 lead on a rebound follow by Dalembert. 
Harris made a free throw to cut the margin to two points with 1:14 to go. After a miss by Miller, Bobby Simmons hit a 3-pointer from the left wing with 35.3 seconds to play aQd was fouled, putting the Nets ahead 93-92. However, he missed the free throw. 
Marreese Speights, who had five points, gave Philadelphia a 94-93 lead with a 10-footer with 26.4 seconds to go.

BENGAL BOUTS 
Lone heavyweight fighters to square off in finals rematch 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Editor 

The first Bengal Bouts champion of 2009 will be crowned tonight in the Joyce Center. 
The heavyweight champi­onship fight features sopho­
more  Kevin  Crepeau  and  
defending .champion  Will  
Bourroughs.  

Crepeau and Bourroughs will be fighting for the first and final time tonight as the only two boxers in this year's heavyweight division. Crepeau weighed in at 234 pounds and Bourroughs tipped the scales at 239. 
-"It's kind of nerve-wracking because that first fight you always get to see where you are," Crepeau said. "Nothing is the same as when you actu­ally fight, so you don't know if all your training has been enough until you actually get in there." 
Tonight's battle is a rematch from last year's final when Bourroughs, a law student, proved to be too much for then-freshman Crepeau. 
"Last year he gave me a pretty good beating, so this year I think I'm going to come with something a little differ­ent," Crepeau said. 
Last year, after a fairly even first round, Bourroughs pulled away in the second and opened up on his opponent in the final round, ending the contest before the final bell. 
"Once he had me, he just hit the gas," Crepeau said. 
To his credit, the rookie was the only fighter that Bourroughs did not put on the canvas. Crepeau said he used the loss as motivation in his training this year and thinks he is better prepared the sec­ond time around. 
"I know what I have to do," Crepeau said. "I just have to do it and that's not that easy." 
They know each other's style after sparring many times leading up to this year's fight. 
The title fight should be one

By JAY FITZPATRICK Managing Editor 
Notre Dame begins its final 

" push to the postseason tonight when it takes on Syracuse at 7 p.m. in the Joyce Center. The Irish are coming off a hard-fought 76-66 loss to top­ranked and undefeated Connecticut on Sunday, in what was the smallest margin of victory this season for the Huskies. Despite having sev­eral opportunities to win, the Irish allowed a 22-1 Connecticut run and fell by the wayside in the second half. Notre Dame left the game
