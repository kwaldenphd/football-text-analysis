Irish Wake ready 
about why we thought a party of this nature 
and size culd be held successfully. The report 
has met with favorable response." 
Dean of Students John Macheca said he shared comments with members of the staff and then discussed it at a Central Staff meeting, although the Wake is primarily his responsibility. 
"Macheca," said Gasior, "has helped us a great deal and pointed out the rough spots that had to be worked out. He's integrally involved in the planning as is Fr. David Schlaver, director of student activities." 
Macheca commented that he is working on the same basis as he would for any private hall party, only on a larger scale and that he has the same expectations for this party as for any private party. 
"By using Stepan, the Wake gives students the chance to show responsibility and also · gives the University the opportunity to show a sign of good will towards the improvement of An Tostal," continued Macheca. "This is something worth doing and doing right." 
The use of Stepan has many advantages according to Gasior. Because the Wake will immediately follow the Beach Boys concert, the An Tostal Committee will be able to sell a package deal for the two events. Both will be held on campus, so transportation will not be a problem. 
In addition, a "more positive atmosphere on campus will be achieved during the weekend by havig all events on campus," stated Gasior. "The use of Stepan could also create a precedent for the implementation of campus facilities for parties." 
The Wake will run from 10:00 a.m. untill :00 
p.m. It will be limited to 450 couples, and tickets can be obtained through advanced sales only. Windjammer, a campus rock group, will be featured, and Gasior is trying to get together a second act of some kind for the band breaks. 
The committee is saving about $350 dollars by not using the armory and "will put a lot of that money into decorations" said the An Tostal Chairman. 
Gasior feels the "an Tostal Committee is taking great pains to insure that the Irish Wake is a success. We're going to attempt to create a suitable party atmosphere and offer an evening of fun for everyone."

BRUSSELS UPI -Speculation that the West German mark 
would be revalued sent the dollar into decline throughout 
Europe Monday. The mark rose dramatically and gold held

The dollar lost ground on virtually every European money

revaluation of the mark.

SLC considers problems of University honor code 
by Patrick Hanifin Staff Reporter 
The SLC yesterday considered 
the problem of honor in the 
University agreeing that stan­
dards of honor must cover all three 
groups on campus: students, 
fac.ulty, and administration. 
Several members also pointed out 
the strains placed on students by 
the system and the need for a way 
of dealing with violators. 

Dr. James Danehy began the discussion by pointing out that "There is no way we can legislate an iron-clad code. What we have to do is produce some kind of statement of the community 
SMC awards three grants 
Dr. William A. Hickey, vice president for academic affairs at Saint Mary's has announced the recipients of the College's first annual Faculty Research Grants. Solely sponsored by Saint Mary's College, these grants are designed to assist faculty members in the conduct of their scholarly or creative work. 
The three grants for the 1974-75 school year were awarded to Dr. Anne Susana, assistant professor biology; Mr. James M. Raymo, assistant professor of art; Sister 
M. Jean Kiene, C.S.C., assistant professor of English. 
Susana will research the ultrastructure of tobaccoleaf plastids as they differentiate in tissue culture. She will utilize the transmission electron microscope in her study. 
Susana explained the significance of this research. "Little is known about the development aspects of plastids­yet life as we know it could not exist without the activity of these celluar entities," she said. 
Raymo's grant will be applied to using the new 3-M Color-in-Color copy machine as a creative, ar­tistic process-tool. In addition, he will experiment with this machine for spontaneous graphic ideas. 
Kiene's accepted research proposal is entited "A Critical Old­Spelling Edition of Five Representative Entertainments for Elizabeth I". Her aim is to publish a single text in English Literary Renaissance. She is also planning the publication of a book, Five Entertainments for Queen 
I.

standard." 
Danehy also noted that the standard must apply to everyone at the University. "That is why the SLC, representing everybody, should look at the problem," he said. 
The point was seconded by Dr. John Roos. "There is a lot of cynicism in each of the three groups that the other groups are not honorable," Roos added. He felt that the code would be a failure if each group was not convinced that the others would follow it. 
Dr. Julian Pleasents agreed that honor standards must be nearly universally accepted by the community if they are to work. "That raises the problem of what 
to do with violators. Too often 
group loyalty prevents people from 
turning others in," he said, "and 
the university needs workable 
structures to bring the problem out 
in the open." 
Danehy argued that "we must 
also create a general atmosphere 
of honor--though I know that is 
vague."

Several student members, particularly Ed Rahill and Bob Connally, pointed out the strains 
the system puts on students. 
"I really wonder if honor is more than a Utopian ideal," Rahill said, "considering the heavy emphasis on academic achievement." He claimed that the curve grading system in some courses made students feel they had to cheat if others did. 
Connally pointed out that course requirements of underclassmen in areas outside their interests were also a source of cheating. "The whole problem is the expectations a person has about the system-­what he thinks it will do to him and what he thinks other people will do," he said. 
The discussion rose from the report of the University Honor Committee and the Commission created a steering subcommittee to report on the direction that further discussion should take. At their next meeting on April 8 the SLC will begin to revise the judicial code for next year.

Staff in final preparation 

Jazz Festival readies for opening Wed 
by Tom Russo Staff Reporter 
Ken Lee, Director of Notre Dame's Collegiate Jazz Festival, and his staff of approximately twenty students are making their final preparations for the three­day event to be held April 4-6. 
Last night Lee announced the schedule for the 20 bands and combos participating in the festival. Seven nationally known jazz musicians will judge the field. Both the performers and the judges represent a wide spectrum of jazz, from the avante-garde to the big band. 
Notre Dame's the oldest Collegiate Jazz Festival in the country--this is its 16th year. "It's also the only truly national one, now that American University in Chicago closed down their Festival 
last year," said Lee. 
Thursday night a Symposium will be held in the Library Auditorium with no admission charge. The symposium will be "Fashioned after the blindford test of Downbeat Magazine, !>elections of music will be played and the judges will comment on and ex­
plain theam," said Lee. There will also be discussions on im­provisations and the controversial jazz of Miles Davis. 
"The highlight, of course, will be the Judges' Jam Session Saturday at midnight," said Lee. "Even though these professionals won't rehea1se, a spontaneity is acheived which can't be found in 
studio recordings. Besides being a 
treat for the audience, it's an honor

The Freshman Year of Studies in 
cooperation with local professional

freshmen women, beginning last 
night and continuing through 
Thursday March 28 in Farley

begin at 7:30 p.m. 
The seminars are offered to 
freshmen women with the hope of 
giving information about 
professional career opportunities 
from a woman's point of view. 
Each seminar will include brief 
presentations by the professional 
women, followed by general 
discussions in the various career 
areas. 
Karen Bergwall and Paula Dawning, both counselors at the Freshman Year Office, are coordinating these first open

"This is a special opportunity for women in aiding them with in­formation about possible careers that they wish to pursue," said Bergwall. 
Dawning added that "up to date literature and research" on professional careers has been elicited for these seminars. 
Emil Hofman, dean of the Fresh­man Year of Studies, stated "The seminars will be important and valuable to the Notre Dame fresh­men women. They are needed to allow women a chance to hear from professional career women themselves." 
Since it is that time of the year when freshmen will decide on an intent for their sophomore year, the seminars will hopefully bring more insight to the freshman woman into which career she wishes to pursue.

"I urge people t() come out and try something different. People here are afraid to try new things, and they often limit tehmselves to one type of music, "commented Lee. "Like all Student Union projects, the Festival is for the good of the students.

Start 

This year's studen\. body president­vice-presidential elections have been called the most important of recent years. The outcome has also been evaluated as one of the most significant in recent years. Now the results and what they point to seem to be less than relevant, however. The students who were interested and involved, distributing posters and attending all night forums in the Keenan-Stanford Chapel before spring break seem to have lost their drive. 
For the past few days the student government and Student Union, .~s~g public advertising, have been solic1tmg applicants for all areas of student government-social, academic, ad­ministrative, services. The response to the ads and turn-out at the interviews has been less than overwhelming. This is to say the least, a disappointment to the candidates who experienced an en­thusiastic rapport with a seemingly enthralled student body. The campaign 
and election bore much hope and happy foresight for many people. That projection is swiftly fading. 
We 

The decision released today-to hold the Irish Wake in Stepan Center-is a measured risk by both the University, the HPC and the An Tostal committee. Through cooperation and com­munication, they offer a tremendous opportunity for a new tradition, and best of all, we can make it happen. 
 
Highlighting the spring celebration has always been the Irish Wake.. In past years, held at the armory, the Wake was not only physically but also socially removed from the campus. Working within the present party guidelines to secure University consent, the An Tostal Committee of the HPC was able to gain the administrative confidence that was 
needed. It now remains for the student 

daanesbury 

a Fire 
A good student government means more than capable or charismatic leaders. It needs supporters who are willing to work, become frustrated and keep working. Talent, experience, charisma-they all help. Determination and a lot of elbow grease is all that is necessary to get the job done. 
This election started something at Notre Dame-something good, something bright and promising. This flame will soon be snuffed out with the apathy that is fast becoming typical of the ND community. 
Before you complain of being smothered by a student government that is "irresponsible" or an administration that "doesn't care", carefully consider the opportunities for real involvement offered to you. Use a little energy and you could spark a fire. 
-Ann McCarry 

Can 
body to prove that confidence true. And we can do it. 
A new bond must be made between the Irish Wake and Notre Dame students to retain this confidence. With the Wake on campus, we can have more than "good times" just by adding that touch of class found at Notre Dame. For in addition, students can positively demonstrate their willingness to work and accept respon­sibility for good times. 
As Committee Chairman Wally Gaisor,. who along with Ron Paja, has proven that willingness, said "This could serve as an important breakthrough for the social life at Notre Dame." Without a doubt, we can make it happen. · 
~Tom Drape 

Why is it that a college president resigns after only two years? Why is it that a years extensive planning and work of a special TASK Force Committee on student life gets shoved aside with a noncommittal wave of the hand? Why is it that a writing instructor gets fired for fostering the idea of academic freedom? Most important, why is it that the students don't question the decisions that affect their own academic and social environment? 
Every student at St. Mary's College is frequently reminded to act in a mature and responsible manner. It seems the concept of a mature and "responsible" has been altered to suit the stability of what would be llsheepranch. A mature person learns to question and evaluate the events that affect his own personal life and the lives of those around him. On the St. Mary's campus the meanings of "mature" and "responsible" have been twisted to mean acceptance without question. Ask yourself-'Is this the purpose of a liberal education?' 
Within only a few years a sad situation has developed atSt. Mary's College. Students have fallen victim to fear. It is not an unjustifiable fear. It is a fear that is warranted if a student wants to survive and "succeed". 
If education is to be a beneficial experience it must be an open forum of ideas. There must be room for freedom of speech and thought that is not bound by any arbitrary restrictions. This is not the case on this campus. The student's right to voice her own opinion has been grossly violated. 
The late St. Mary's Review and current The Sports Page, SMC student newspapers, have been banned from free circulation in the dining hall and dormitories. In essence, these papers were forced underground. They were forced underground by the English Depart­ment. Nothing in the St. Mary's Student Manual states that the operation of a student newspaper is illegal. It is odd that the St. Mary's Review was forcedunderground bythe same department that funded it. Since the English Department was funding the paper they had the right to control it, but to force their own project underground points to the fact that the administration might also be a victim of fear. Fear of student opinion. 
It is wrong that The Sports Page is forced underground when it is an independent paper supported only through advertisements, but as one headline reads: "We'll Hang In There!". Still, all the articles in The Sports Page lack by-lines. Staff members fear retribution from the college. 
These are not the only cases of fear happening on this campus. Some 
students have encountered threats in their relationships with faculty 
members. The use of threats is obviousl7 a misuse of power. Cases 
like these stress the fact that fear leads to limitations an an unjust 
exercise of authority. 
Could it be that when Dr. Edward L. Henry commented after his 
resignation, "I would be less than honest if I said everything fell into 
place, because it didn't. There were and are disappointments, but 
none that I can do anything about.", he was referring to the current 
stifling atmosphere at St. Mary's? 
It is hard to say if this situation ctn be remedied but it is clear that an honest effort on both the parts of the administration and the students must be made. The administration must broaden their outlook and make for a free, uninhibited exchange of ideas They are here to help, not hinder, the students in the pursuit of their goals. The students are not here to undermine their own environment. Any opinions they state or questions they ask are the purpose of seeking a better and more effective education. If the lines between the ad­ministration and students are opened up honestly then we will all surely learn what it means to be mature and responsible.

Catholicism may establish a false dichotomy between this in­stitution's vocation to be Catholic, and its vocation to be a University. Some may even begin to assume that a scholar's effort to lead his students "through the purgatory and hells of modern rationalism"-­"to lead ·em into the jungle and let ·em hack their own way out," as Professor Richard  Sullivan described the teacher's role at the last summer school com­mencement--is less than a moral endeavor, and that teachers mu~t do something else--preach, say--m

Affected 
Editor: 

I read with amusement the 
recent Jetter by Ann Hawkins and 
Mary Loberstein printed on the 
letter page in Thursday's Ob­
o.;crver. What a surprise! The 
students involved just discovered 
the meaning of the phrase "en loco 
parentis," that is, if the Uni~ersity
of Notre Dame is to be considered 
our temporary parent, then we in­
turn must be considered the 
children. Under the expert 
guidance of John A. Macheca and 
~'ather James T. Burtchaell we 
ean not help but become better 
people; without their divine 
guidance we will probably stray 
and become the "moral 
troglodytes" that the Provo~t 
referred to earlier this year. SIC 
months ago 1strayed, and I will be 
forever grateful to the Dea~ of 
Students for setting me straight. 
I must ask Miss Hawkins and Miss Loberstein what makes them 
think that they are capable of throwing an orderly party? ~hy indeed is a party necessary smce there are so many other en­tertaining things to do at Du Lac? What was the theme of their party? Exactly who was to be inv~t~? More importantly, was drmkmg really secondary at this party? Why were the two girls <not women remember "en loco parenti~,") objecting to inv~tin* the "life of all campus parties, John Macheca to their get together? How could a party possibly hope to succeed w1tho~t his assistance? <By the way, he IS 
 a top rated charades player. l But, then, the Dean of Students need not be invited since he can enter any room on campus at any time he so pleases. Check your room con­tract. Anyhow, the Dean and Assistant Dean are great guys. 
Ask me, I know. I've been in conferences or trials ten times with the gentlemen since the in­famous Sorin Hall party, three times in the eight days following the SBP elections. You see. I made the mistake of speaking my mind and then losi1g. Believe it or not! 
The Wall Street Journal wrote a glowing article about the University of Notre Dame the other day; the image is intaet. The fact that the students have to check with the Dean of Students before they blow their noses was ~ot mentioned. DuLac breathes a sigh of relief. Why don't the students themselves react? Because it won't affect them, they think. When it does, the ball game is over, because the students have no rights in jucidial procedures; they are powerless. The few rights that students have are not enforced. Some students blame Mr. Macheca; I blame student government and student apathy. Most students feel that if they play by the rules they won't be bothered. Wrong! Miss Hawkins and Miss Loberstein were bothered. And six months to the day I am still being harassed. We played by the rules <ridiculous though they seem) and got caught in the backwash of red tape. 
As for the rest of the students, I say enjoy yourselves. You have 
not been affected.  Yet.

Kelsey delivers lecture on human emotion 
by Tom Russo Staff Reporter 
Rev. Morton T. Kelsey, a Presbyterian minister and Assistant Professor in Religious Education and Jungian Analyst at Notre Dame, delivered a lecture on "Psycosomatic Medicine: Body, Mind, and Emotions" before a capacity crowd at the Library auditorium Sunday evening. His talk was one in a series of lectures sponsored by the Notre Dame Pre­Med Society. 
Kelsey's basic question was: "Do emotions, including religious ones, have any effect on the human body?" 
In proving that they undoubtedly do, Kelsey gave an hour talk and presented a film and several slides !)n cancer research, followed by short question and answer session. 
In his personal, humorous style, Kelsey first traced the history which has led to the modern separation between medicine and the Church. The five steps he emphasized were: 

-the Medieval change from the "Sacrament of Healing" to the "Sacrament of the Extreme Unc­
tio~t'~~ decision of the 1215 Lateran 
Council which required priests to 
visit the sick before doctors. 
-the later Papal Bull which, in 
effect, forbade dissection of human 
corpses, which was meant to curb 
abuses during the Crusades. 
-another Papal Bull which for­
bade clerics to cut the human 
body.. 
-the burning at the stake of two 
gifted physicians by the Papacy 
Serves as prosecution witness 



Dean implicates Mitchell 
NEW YORK <UPI) -For­mer White House Counsel John 
W. Dean III testified Monday former Attorney General John 
N. Mitchell asked him to get the Securities and Exchange Commission to hold up aspects of its investigation of financier Robert L. Vesco. 
Dean also testified former Commerce Secretary Maurice Stans told Mitchell on one occasion his name would not be connected with a $200,000 secret contribution from Vesco to President Nixon's 1972 election campaign. 
Dean, star witness at last year's Senate Watergate hearings, took the stand Mon­day as a key prosecution witness in the federal court trial of Mitchell and Stans on charges of attempting to impede the SEC investigation in return for the contribution. 
The two, who managed 

SU holding interviews 
by Jim Donatben Staff Reporter 
Interviews for Student Union positions will be held Wednesday, March '1:1, Thursday, March 28, announced Student Union co­director Pat Burke. Names are presently being accepted for social services, cultural arts and academic .commissioners,' con­troller, assistant director, and staff positions. Burke urges in­terested students to call the Student Union at 7757 or drop by the office in LaFortune. 
There is an ample supply of staff positions, according to Burke. 
"If people want to work on the staff, we are more than willing to find them something to do." Burke said. "Ifsomeone wants to work in one comm1s1on area or on one special project (i.e., Mardi Gras, An Tostal) we'll find a place for him," he added. 
Students who contact the Student Union Office to reserve an in­terview time will be asked to state the area of activities in which they prefer to work. Burke and the present commisioner of that area will conduct the interview. 

Nixon's re-election campaign, are on trial on a federal grand jury indictment charging con­spiracy and perjury. 
Just before the 1972 election, Dean said, Mitchell attempted to get SEC Chairman William Casey to postpone taking depositions from Vesco em­ployes because "it was another example of political harass­ment" designed to embarrass Nixon. 
Dean quoted Mitchell as saying there was "no need for this to come out." 
Vesco and 41 associates later were charged by the SEC with civil fraud for the alle~d looting of $224 million from a mutual fund corporation. The financier is now a fugitive from 
U.S. prosecution in the Baha­mas. 
Dean said Mitchell was concerned in October, 1972, that his initials,"J.M.", were next to the sum of $200,000 on a contribution Jist, which should, by law, be reported to the Office on Federal Elections. He said he was present in Mitchell's office when Stans told Mitchell, "It shouldn't be a problem." 
"He indicated that the contribution wouldn't be on the list when it was filed,' Dean testified. An official of the election office testified earlier in the trial that the contribution never was reported. 
Later that October, Dean met with Stans and Mitchell at the Metropolitan Club in New York, he said. 
He described Mitchell as "very disturbed" about the SEC calling Vesco aides to testify on the eve of the election when "it could come out about the cash contribution and Edward Nixon's connection." 
Edward Nixon, the presi­dent's youngest brother, helped Vesco's secret campaign contri­bution, according to previous testimony, and Donald Nixon Jr., the president's nephew, is employed by the financier. 
Dean said he called Casey on behalf of Mitchell but Casey said it would be difficult to postpone the depositions. 
"I called Mitchell and told him 'John, I don't know, whether we are going to have any luck with Casey'," Dean testified, adding he did not find out whether the subpoenas were put off. 
According to previous wit· nesses they were not, but Vesco aides refused to testify on grounds of possible self incrimi­nation. 
Dean also quoted Casey as 
telling him to tell Mitchell that 
Vesco is a "bad man" and 
"Don Nixon Jr., shouldn't be 
hanging around with him." 
It was the beginning of the 
sixth week of the trial and 
Dean, who pleaded guilty last 
October to impeding the Sena­
te's Watergate investigation, 
was the 25th witness. 
The previous 24 government 
witnesses had failed to back up 
the government's charge that 
Mitchell, who ran the Nixon 
campaign committee, and 
Stans, chief of the campaign's 
finances, attempted to impede 
the SEC probe of Vesco. 
Casey testified flatly last 
week that neither defendent 
ever asked him to fix the case. 

and by Calvin. 
Thus, he continued, science came to think that "only matter counted." This attitude, however, was reversed by the influence of Freud and a "classic book by Dr. Florecne Dunbar in 1935 entitled Emotion and Bodily Changes." 
Finally, said Kelsey, physicians and psychologists realized that "emotions affect resistance to disease". This resistance is based on lymphocyte cells. These cells, he explained, attack the ever­present disease cells in the body, such as strep throat or cancer. Over-active lymphocytes attack the body itself, and can lead to arthritis <as theorized by Dr. Christian Barnard). 
Kelsey proposed that "a set of satisfactory goals leads to a proper balance of lymphocytes, and thus good health." 
He then listed on a blackboard seven symptoms of tension caused by the sympathetic nervous system. These symtoms, which include high blood pressure, high pulse, and a greater tendancy for blood clotting, "can be caused by fears you don't even know you have. These symptoms are an infallible indication that someplace there is fear or anxiety." 
Kelsey proceeded to give other examples of emotionally related symtoms and dlseases in .tbe cardio-vascular system, the gastro-intestinal system, and even in warts, which he said can be cured as much by a placebo as by surgery. 
"The three emotions which cause the most damage are fear, anger, and depression. They cause the greatest portion of illnesses," he said. 
"The solution l.o avoid these destructuve emotions is to develop fellowships where you can con­verse at any level, to have a basic sense of intimacy and value and to have some ultimate meaning in the universe around you," concluded Kelsey. 
The film and slides concerned cancer research done at the University of Southern California which depicted the· roles of specialized cells, particularly lymphoctyes in the lungs. Time lapse photography and immense magnifications were used to film these functions. 
In the quesuons and answer session, Kelsey maintained that the full creative growth and happiness of man can occur only 
in groups, and that religious groups are some of the very few social organizations which concern themselves with total human development.

KSU shootings re-exalllined 
CLEVELAND <UPI> -The federal grand jury re-examin­ing the killing of four Kent State University students by Ohio National Guard troops during a 1970 antiwar demon­stration was expected to reach its final conclusions by mid­week, the head of the U.S. Justice Department's Criminal Division said Monday. 
Robert A. Murphy said at the re-convening of the jury follow­ing an almost three-week recess, "We are meeting today to discuss a couple of items that have been hanging since we last recessed. We expect to wrap up the investigation probably by Tuesday or Wed­nesday." 
The federal grand jury was impaneled last Dec. 18. 
In 34 days of meetings, it heard testimony from more than 150 witnesses, beginning with a consultant who testified on the accuracy of a model of the shooting scene and ending with former Gov. James A. 
450,000 kids are drunks 
DETROIT (UPI) An estimated 450,000 American children are drunks, according to an expert on alcoholism, and many of them are taught by their parents. 
"It is sad but true that we live in a drinking society and that drinking often is taught as a social grace to children," John Heiner, executive director for the Detroit area of the National Council On Alcohol, said Sunday. 
Many parents set examples by drinking themselves, he said. 
Others, he said, encourage their children to drink in · the belief that alcohol is preferable to drugs. 
"While we agonize over the possibility that our children might become drug addicts," Heiner said, "we pay scant attention to the possibility that they stand a far better chance of joining the nation's nine million alcoholics and problem drinkers." 
He cited a survey of 589 high school students in Michigan's Washtenaw County. It indicated more than half of the students first drank at home in the company of adults. 
The survey also indicated Washtenaw teen-agers not only prink more frequently, but drink harder than an earlier survey showed in 1970, Heiner said. 
In the latest survey, 20 per cent of the students said they most frequently down five or more drinks at a time. Only 12 per cent reported drinking that heavily in the 1970 survey.

According to Mrs. Black, the abortion issue is the main topic which prompted her to file. She says "I am a pro-life candidate" and advocates a passage of the "right to JifP." amendment, along 
with f;overnmental restrictions on pornography within "the spirit of the Constitution." 
In commenting on the three 
main issues cited by the in-
cum bent, John Brademas, Mrs. 
Black offered the following 
statement concerning the energy 
cns1s: "I think John Brademas 
contributed somewhat to this by 
completely ignoring the Arabs in 
favor of the Israelis. 
"With resoect to Watergate and 
impeachment she stated that 
"Watergate is part of the whole 
corruption of the country. I wouid have to say that I have not read 
anything yet that would warrant 
impeachment." In speaking of 
inflation, Mrs. Black pointed out 
that "there has not been a law ·passed in 20 years that a Democratic Congress has not passed. Whatever laws have been put into effect are the result of twenty years of Democratic legislation." 
Mrs. Black cited her years as a high school English and Religion teacher as qualifications for congresswoman because she is associated daily with the people and can feel the pulse of the community this way. 
Besides teaching, Mrs. Black is a writer who is listed in Who's Who of American Women and has published numerous articles in educational journals. Her husband is an associate history professor at St. Mary's College. The Black's have four children and have lived in the South Bend area for twenty

For 'Shu', it's a tough decision 
by Greg Corgan Sports Editor 
John Shumate approached the microphone to a roaring round of ap­plause from the 1100 or so people seated in the audience. The scene was last Tuesday night's basketball banquet, and the "big Shu" had just been awarded the Field Goal Percentage trophy for his efforts during the '73-74 season. 
He reached the podium and after a few customary acknowledgements he began to speak about a topic of which there seemed at least a fair amount of interest. 
"I know," he began, "that everybody is wondering and asking me questions about whether or not I'm going to stay here at Notre Dame next year, and I feel that this is a good time to try and clear things up." · 
At this time Shu began to smile and the crowd sensed a favorable verdict. Shu tried to continue but the crowd began to voice their ap­proval. He waited for them to quiet down and finally after two more such displays of enthusiasm, he continued. 
"I just want to take this opportunity, "he said, "to say that 'I don't know."' With this, Shu turned to his left, a smile on his face a foot long as if everything was just a game, and took his place at the head table. 
The audience obviously wondered about John's teasing antics, but the big center from Elizabeth, New Jersey, wasn't just fooling around. He was dead serious. And he had reason to be-simply because there are so many things for him to consider. 
"My mother, father and sisters are a big factor influencing my decision," said Shu. "I went home after the season and we talked about it quite a bit. We're not one of the richest families in the world, both my parents have to work, and I want to be able to help them the best I can. One of the biggest reasons I came to college was so that after I was through, I would be able to help my family. 
"But there is the other side of it also, and that's my school and my teammates. I don't want to let anybody down. All the guys on the team have told me that whatever decision I make they'll be behind me all the way. They're not just concerned for themselves and I respect them for that." 
Gary Brokaw may have spoken for the whole team when he said," I would like Shu to stay for the benefit of the program, but his goals were to play pro ball and to get a degree, and now he can do both. If he gets what he wants, I think he should go, but he has to make the decision concerning what's best for himself. Whatever he decides, though, we'll back him all the way." 
So far John Shumate has achieved his first goal, that of a degree. Despite some misinformed opinion to the contrary, Shu is not a hardship case. He has more than the necessary credits to graduate with a degree in sociology although because of the year he was sick he is still athletically eligible for another season. Therefore, regardless of his decision, he can graduate with his class this coming May. 
"I've worked hard athletically and academically," added Shu, " and I've prolonged my decision just so that I can look at everything ob­jectively so that I can make the right decision. 
"I've dedicated myself to Notre Dame and I think I'm counting on my experience here to help me make my decision, and no matter what I choose, I feel that everyone here will be right behind me." 
Nonetheless, Shumate has been the target of many Notre Dame "friends" pleading with him to stay. John appreciates the concern, but finds it all pretty narrow. 
"They think they're doing it for my best interests but they're not. People are putting unnecessary pressure on me. I wanted to try to ob­jectively weigh all the circumstances. If it was up to me I'd come back to college, but I have my family to consider first, Notre Dame second and myself third. 
"Notre Dame was Notre Dame before I was ever born, and it'll be Notre Dame after I leave. I love my family and I love Notre Dame. I could never even begin to pay this school back for what it's given me. But I love my family, and my mother has been working since she was nine years old. She dedicated four more years of her life so that I could come here and I owe a lot to her. I'd like to see her be able to stay home and raise the rest of her children." 
John Shumate appreciates people, sincere people, and that goes beyond 


The big question now seems to be whether or not John Shumate will be hitting jump shots in the pro 
ranks or back at Notre Dame. 
his own personal friends and teammates. "The student body body here is just great," said the big center. They want me to come back,. but I know that if they sit down and think about it, they'll be behind anything I do. That's the type of relationship we have 
here. I've given the best I have, and I know they'll never let me down. 
"I've always wanted to tell the students how grateful I am for what they've given me. They helped me and they helped the team to achieve the goals we set out to achieve. I'll never forget their support as long as I live." 
When it comes to playing basketball, John Shumate does it all. He doesn't overlook a thing. And that's how it's been as he considers the future. 
"I thought about coming back and trying to win a National Cham­pionship, but I think the team is going to reach that goal regardless whether I'll be here or not. They know they'll always have my support. 
"I'm also concerned with the academic aspect of things. I'm a sociology major and I'd like to take more courses in psychology an­ticipating a further career in social psychology. I also need about four more courses to double major in economics and I have to say this will influence my decision. 
"It's really an insult to me when people overlook the academic nature of an athlete's situation and just call them a 'jock.' I've gone through all the academics like everybody else plus two summer sessions. Besides that I've done pretty well at basketball, and it really bothers me when I'm referred to as a jock." 
And the "big Shu" views the idea of preparation for pro-ball realistically. 
"Cqming back another year would help me for professional basketball if I played outside facing the basket. But right now I feel that I'm already as good as I can be underneath."

Ruggers split on the Emerald Isle 
by Bob Kissel 
Cr.edit the Notre Dame rugby team with celebrating St. Patrick's Day in a manner certainly befit­ting any true Irishman. The Irish ruggers spent St. Paddy's day in Dublin amidst the massive throngs of people and the city's traditional parade. 
But the Irish ruggers' main purpose of their Ireland tour was not to see the beautiful Irish countryside, its castles, or spend money on souvenirs. The purpose of the Ireland tour was to play rugby--and play rugby with the best in Ireland. 
"We hoped to schedule the best teams in Ireland," explained team captain Tom Masenga. "Our realistic goal was to leave Ireland with a split. .I believe our squad is among the best in collegiate rugby and a favorable showing in Ireland would show the students and the athletic department the excellence of our program." 
The rugby team accomplished their pre-tour goals with great success. Rugby in Ireland em­ploys much the same a~~;e development program that American football uses. 
This makes for an all-round devolopment of the skills and tricks necessary to win in rugby. The Irish played two major city club teams, the Bohemians of Limerick and Tralee, and two of the best college rugby teams in all Ireland, the universities of Cork and Dublin. The four games' wrapups are: 
Notre Dame 6 -Bohemians 0 N.D.'s first contest was won on a try by Larry Casey and the con­version by veteran Ed O'Connell. N.D.'s physical attack was ap­parently enough to overcome Limerick's better passing and finesse. The "B" squad lost to Old Crescent of Limerick 9-8, with Bill Sweeney and John Mcintyre scoring tries for the Irish. 
Tralee 22 -Notre Dame 12 
Notre Dame's physical game was no stranger to the farmers playing for Tralee. Notre Dame was beat physically as well as stylishly. Rich Conti notched a try and Ed O'Connell converted two penalty kicks to account for the Irish offense. · 
Cork -24 -Notre Dame -14 

The Irish ruggers dropped their second game on a rain soaked field in Cork. The game was close for most of the contest, but the ·ex­ceptional kicking ability of Cork prevailed in the end. Pete Frantz and Joe Hafner combined for three tries for the Irish scoring. The "B" squad lost to Cork "B" 14-4, with Chris Patterson tallying for the Domers. 
Notre Dame -14 -Dublin --11 

The final win for the Irish was pounded out on a muddy field in Dublin, over the best collegiate rugby team in all Ireland. 
It was through sheer emotional desire that the ruggers overcame a deficit with five minutes remaining. The winning try was scored by Joe Hafner, with Bill Sweeney and Ed O'Connell providing the other Irish scores. The "B" team lost to Dublin "B" 14-4, with Dave Ward providing the lone Irish points. 
Whert asked how the Ireland tour helped the play of the rugby team, team captain Masenga responded, "our backs improved grearly, increasing their ball-handling and passing skills. We also learned tricks of the game which cannot be learned except for years and years of play.'' 

The rugby club's spring schedule is no pushover. The basic ob­jective for the team this spring is to go undefeated, as they did during the fall. Their season begins this Saturday against Ohio State behind Stepan Center. 
"Ohio State is one of the best teams I saw at the nationals last fall," offered Masenga. "Both teams will be playing all-out for the possession of the series silver cup.'' 
Other opponents this spring include Big Ten champ Illinois, traditional rival John Carroll, mid­American conference winner Ohio University, and the Chicago Lions, who the Irish knocked off to claim the Midwest title. 
All these teams will be gunning to knock off the undefeated Irish­but after all-that's nothing new in sports around the Golden Dome.
