Witt vs.Reneau vs. Phelps And Stumm vs. Klemm Big Class Contests 
Campus politicos, just recov­ering from Student Body Pres­idential elections and the Mock Convention, are taking time out from national elections for next Tuesday's class elections. All tw­elve races are contested save for two, and the candidates seem to be both returning favorites and new emerging faces. 
The three way race for the Senior Class Presidency between present Junior Class vice pres­ident Dave Witt, Junior Class Special Projects Coordinator Scott Reneau, and Business Sen­ator Mike Phelps appears to be 
the most unpredictable contest. 
Witt was sophomore class sec­retary, Reneau is a former stu­dent senator and stay senator, and Phelps ran for the sophomore class presidency and lost to Rick Rembusch. All three candidates are considered to have consid­erable support among various elements of their class. 
Thomas Breen, Rembusch's vice-president as a sophomore who did not seek office last year re-enters the arena as a candidate for Senior Class vice president. He is running unop­posed. 

Robert Rogers is challenging incumbent Bruno Eidietis for the position of class secretary. Eidietis ran unchallenged last year but v.as almost defeated by a strong write-in campaign. 
A three-man race is also de­veloping for Senior Class treas­ury. Thomas DeMetrio, Ernest Gargalo, and Michael Neumeis­ter for seeking control of the class finances. 
Although sophomore Sam Bo­yle's attempt to organize a "Co­alition for a Junior Class Al­ternative" failed, the Junior class presidency should be no less a clash. Sophomore President Leo Klemm, against whom the coa­Jition was directed, is seeking re-election. David Stumm is Kl­emm's only opposition. He de­sires less political manuevering in. the appointment of class of­ficers and says he will open all positions to interested students.

Dow Protest Set For This Afternoon 
Herbert D. Doan, President of Dow Chemical Company, will speak on campus at 3: 15 this afternoon in the Center for Con­tinuing Education. A student protest is anticipated. 

Mr. Doan, appearing in the Cities in Context conferences being held all week, will discuss the "Ethical and Natural" fac­tors necessary in creating a bet­ter urban environment. 
In a flier circulated yesterday Mr. Doan, whose company con­tracts the production of napalm, was strongly attacked. Quoting an excerpt from the New England 
. 
Journal of Medicine on the atro­city of napalm wounds, student protesters called for campus sup­port against this controversial figure. The flier, in part read, "We will protest and confront all of Dow's recruiters and of­ficials until they decide that the ethics they speak of apply to themselves and they refuse to continue their contract to pro­duce napalm." 
The student protesters will gather at 2:45 to welcome Mr. Doan at the Continuing Educa­tion Center.

Editor: 
Mr. Connelly's article in the April I Observer is a true classic in logic. He reasons with a skill that is uniquely his own. To back-up his belief that anti-cler­icalism is "rampant" on campus he writes, "Just glance for a moment at the empty pews at Sacred Heart or the pitiful turn­out for daily Mass in many halls." Student laziness has been used to explain many things 
but it is ridiculous to think it 
indicates a personal animosity 
towards the clergy. 
My main gripe is Mr. Connel­ly's constant reference to the majority support of the student body. Using words such as "size­
able percentage" and "overwhel­

mingly" he sets for th the idea 
that the rest of us are with him. 
I do not doubt that he has dis­
cussed the matter with other students, but are these students a fair representation of the ma­jority? What they represent are his circle of friends. It was one of these friends that stated the most absurd paragraph of Mr. Connelly's prize-winning article. It is I who am nauseated by the fact that this person is a member of the University. My circle of friends are as much in support of the administration as Mr. Con­nelly is against it and I have as much reason to believe we con­stitute a majority as he has to believe he does. The disrespect and poor taste shown in the article indicates that Mr. Con­nelly is in bad need of the paternalism that he so severely denounced. 
Sincerely, AI Carzoli 81 I Peashway Editor: 

Tom Figel's column of March 
27 is a mess! He states unequivo­
cally that Sen. Eugene McCarthy 
is the best man for the office of 
President of the United States 
for the very cogent reason that 
he was the first to ask for it. I hadn't really noticed that our democracy was run on a "first come, first served" basis. 
Another thing, who's taking the greater risk? Sen. McCarthy was never mentioned as Presiden­tial timber, and probably will never be closer to that office than he is now, while Sen. Ken­nedy was conceded an excellent very real chance at the Presidency in '72 by all who know anything of politics. If Bobby Kennedy doesn't get the nomination, he rnigh t very well have made e­nough political enemies to keep him out of the running for a very long time. 
I suggest that Mr. Figel read a little more and write a little less until he's able to write intelli­gently and unbiassedly. Of course, then he'd get thrown off the Observer-no place for intelligence in Our newspaper! 
Love, Dennis J. Mulshine 307 Keenan Hall 
Editor: 

Now that the red crosses and suits of armor have contentedly been tucked away, it is time to look at the Mock Political Fiasco in retrospect. Had the Hatfield people any conception of polit­ical reality, it is quite obvious that the William Jennings Bry­
an of I 968 would not have been 
nominated as the Republican 
candidate. 

The visionaries of this cam­
pus may feel that they have 
spoken; in fact, they have only 
murmured. Had the convention 
been in any way similar to the 
August convention (as it was billed), there would have been no suspension of rules. There would have been no need be­cause a coalition between Rock­efeller and Hatfield people to back a man who successfully governs a city with more people than the entire state of Oregon, who is an outspoken critic on Vietnam, and who appeals to the confused youth of America-John Lindsay. 
Face it, crusaders, the Mock Convention was a sham, which only illustrates to the American public that the eligible draftees and ineligible voters of America are not worthy of the sacred righ.t to vote. It's too bad that Ambrose Mcinerny wasn't nom­ianted VEEP to make .the con­vention a complete farce. If the 
knights of this campus expect to get "Scarbelly" out of the White Hosue, they will ahve to show more responsibility than they did this past week-end. 
Yours in Neville Chamberlain, 
Luke Griffin 
Editor: 

I'm a little disturbed by a growing tendency around the country, especially after John­son's recent announcement, to think that jumping on the Ken­nedy bandwagon is the thing to do, that "he can't miss now." 
I wish people would remember that while Eugene McCarthy was risking his political future by challenging the president, even though he is representing a Hum­phrey-dominated state in the Sen­ate, the typical Kennedy speech began with a condemnation of Johnson's policies, proceeded to a refusal to do anything about changing them, and concluded with a statement supporting LBJ all the way. 
Without McCarthy's move, Kennedy would still be waiting for good old 1972 and we would be. faced with a Johnson-Nixon "choice" next November. To say that McCarthy is "a nice guy who did his job but can't win" is ridiculously narrow-minded. He has at least as much political experience and popularity as JFK had at this stage in 1959 and what is important he is a man of action, not words, who has always had the courage to act on his beliefs, from the period when he debated the "other" McCarthy to the present day, while others with similar bl 
while others with similar beliefs have sat around. Just once, in this messed up country of late, I'd like to see the best man come out ahead. It sickens me to think that this man, to whom, whether we realize it or not, we owe such a great deal, may be left on the outside looking in next November.

Editor: 
I read Tom Brislin's explana­tion of why we youthful ideal­ists should "place our stars" in Robert Kennedy (RFK Center), 
but I must admit that, although 
I am an Irish Catholic, I have not 
seen the light quite as clearly as 
Mr. Brislin has. 
Maybe I'm just looking at 
things from a different point of 
view. Brislin praises Kennedy for 
going down to Mississippi and 
Alabama (total of I 8 electoral 
votes) and criticizing the racial 
bigotry of the local whites-there 
can be no doubt that these states 
will never vote for Kennedy now, 
so Bobby is lauded for a truly 
courageous act. Brislin fails to 
note, however, that RFK had 
been hated in these areas for 
y~ars, that he had nothing to 
lose in these states anyway, and 
that it helped to ice down a few 
million northern Negro votes. 
In 1967 Bobby was the major critic of the war in Vietnam. From November of 1967 until the New Hampshire primary, however, he silenced his attacks 
on Vietnam, and was perfectly content to see Eugene McCarthy play stalking horse. Suddenly realizing that McCarthy couldn't handle the job, Bobby decided to enter the race. McCarthy, blinded by his thirst for power, has also failed to see the light, and has refused to drop out. 
McCarthy isn't the only one who is blinded. Polls taken in February in New York show that RFK's popularity has dropped from 5 I% to 36% in two years. Reasons given by Bobby's con­stituents: "too arrogant, too am­bitious, too ruthless." A man like this just doesn't appeal to my youthful idealism, and now that Johnson has dropped out of the race I think it is now practical to work for the man who placed his stars in us-Eugene McCarthy.
