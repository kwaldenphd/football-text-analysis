;\ limner Notre Dame student was found dead in an apparent suicide in Bloomington, Ind. Saturday moming. 
Brian Berg, a former member of the class of 2004 from Wheaton, Ind., had a history of mental illness and had been 1mrolled in a resident treatment program for his illness in Bloomington at the time of his d1~ath, his mother Julie Berg said. 
Sgt. David Drake of the Bloomington Police Department said Berg's body was found Saturday moming and police had no reason to believe foul play was involV(.ld. 
Berg's mother said her son was on his way to a llalloween party Friday night in Bloomington and did not return to the treatment center for its nightly curfew. 
Berg, a eomputer engineering major, participated in Notre Dame's London Program during the fall of his junior year in 2002 1U1d began to show signs of what counselors initially thought was homesickness, his mother said. After returning to the United States in the spring, Berg was placed on medication and eventu­ally diagn~ed with schizophrenia, his mother said.

Editor's Note: This arti­cle is the first in a series of three articles focusing on academic engagement at Notre Dame.

Sophomore Elizabeth Webster would like to spend more time reading a newspa­per or a book. but she fmds she just doesn't have time; when she's not in class or practicing for cross-country. she must do her homework. 
"Some people seem to be able to do it all," she said. "I feel like I'm limited." 
like many Notre Dame stu­dents, Webster's involvement in both her schoolwork and her extra-curricular activities leave little time for much else. Students often said that. although they would like to keep up more with current events, politics and the news through reading outside sources, the academic and extra-curricular rigors of Notre Dame can prevent them from having the time to do so. 
"Nearly everyone is con­sumed with classes, clubs and jobs," junior theology major Eric Wooldridge said. 
As a result. students said they cannot really spend time focusing on material they know will not be necessary for a test, even if they are personally interested in the subject. 
"If I sit down to study for a test [and) the professor gives us something to concentrate on. I'm going to concentrate on that. I don't want to clutter my brain with information that is not going to be on the exam," said Zach Goodrich. a biology major. 
Satisfaction 
Despite this time crunch. however, Notre Dame stu­dents generally said they remain well-informed about politics and current events through conversations with peers, rather than outside media or reading. They also said the level of intellectual­ization on campus satisfies them, in contrast to faculty concerns about the lack of undergraduate academic engagement outside of the classroom. 
Some students said that conversation among their peers often focuses on sub­jects such as sports, alcohol and the opposite sex. 

"Partying. alcohol. girls and sports are much more com­mon topics of conversation than politics or philosophy. I'm more comfortable with that-I like it that way," Wooldridge said. 
Students. however, said they often connect material learned in class in conversa­tions with peers to make their discussions more academic, which contradicts faculty per­ceptions that most students do not often discuss academic issues in their dorms or the dining halls. 
"A lot of [my) conversations with friends are deeper than 'what are you doing this weekend,' " said Hobert Gibbs, a finance/psychology major. "My friends and I talk a lot about philosophy in gen­eral." 
Jessica Campbell, a senior biology major, said she likes how she and her friends from science classes can discuss the material outside of the classroom. 
"With [my] pre-med friends, we are always ana­lyzing what's going on with our bodies -!Uld it's so cool

Smith said he didn't know he was carrying a knife. He said he later learned his sis­ter had packed it in the DVD case in order to cut fruit dur­ing a summer road trip.

DETROIT-The city's for­mer police chief, who resigned late last week over his failure to declare a loaded pistol on a flight, was charged Monday with misde­meanor possession of an unlicensed handgun. 
Jerry Oliver stepped down on Friday, saying the contro­versy over the gun had become a distracting sideshow. 
The controversy began after Oliver, 56, failed to tell airport officials he had a loaded, .25-caliber pistol in his luggage before taking a flight Oct. 18 from Detroit Metropolitan Airport to Philadelphia. He already has been fined by federal authorities. 
Wayne County Prosecutor Michael Duggan said Monday in announcing the charge that Oliver should have registered the gun when he moved to Michigan, nearly two years ago.

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Metnbers adopt ne\V bylaws, name 
By MATT BRAMANTI 
News Writer 
Executive Cabinet members met Monday evening to dis­cuss their new bylaws, which shake up the composition of the broad-based committee. Under its new bylaws, which were adopted unanimously, the body will now be called the Council of Heprcscntativcs, reflecting its composition of members from bodies across student govern­ment. 
A key change to the bylaws allows for four members of the Student Senate to receive voting scats on the new coun­
cil. Student Body President Pat Hallahan said the addi­tion of the senators allows the council to more directly rep­resent the concerns of stu­dents. 
"It increases representation across the board," Hallahan said. 
The new bylaws also elimi­nate several positions from the council. Chairs of the six Club Coordination Council divisions will no longer sit on the Council of Hepresentatives, though the CCC president will remain a voting member. In addition, the Student Union Board director of programming will no longer be a council mem­ber. 
Hallahan said the new arrangement is more fair to all student constituencies. 
"Their voices won't be lost -they'll be heard through the heads of their organiza­tions," he said. 
"There's no real loss and a lot of gain." he said. 
Several amendments were added to the new bylaws. Tai Romero, SUB director of pro­gramming, proposed an amendment making Council of Representatives meetings open to the public. 
The council approved the amendment without objec­tion, reversing an April deci­sion to close the Executive Cabinet meetings. Other amendments clarified the def­inition of a quorum and man­dated that members give three days' notice before bringing new business to the council. 
The council also voted to meet twice a week for the rest of the semester. in order to allow enough meeting time for a successful transition to the new constitution. 
"We don't want to lose this momentum," said Charlie Ebersol, SUB manager.

Undergrads often uninterested in academia 
By JOE TROMBELLO 
News Writer 
A combination of parental expec­tations, career choice and conver­sations with faculty members out­side of the classroom that do not focus on the world of academia may explain why Notre Dame stu­dents said that there is a general stigma about entering into higher education, some undergraduates said. 
Nthough many students said fac­ulty members arc often willing to meet with them during office hours, they also said that conversation top­ics are often about class-related matters and not about academia in general. 
As a result. and by choice, stu­dents kno~ little about entering into the field of academia. Many said that because of parental sacri­fices and a deeply-instilled work ethic, they think that students are uninterested in becoming profes­sors 
Zach Goodrich, a biology major, said that his experiences with Notre Dame faculty during office hours have been very positive. 
"Professors here are willing to try to help you out. They want to see you succeed," he said. 
like Goodrich, Elizabeth Webster, a sophomore psychology major. said her professors are usually very accessible and willing to meet with her. She said that she attends office hours "all the time." 
However, some students said they have felt uncomfortable attending office hours because they think fac­ulty are too busy to meet with them. 
"I feel intimidated," said senior biology major Jessica Campbell, "because [professors] are so busy. I

just feel they don't have time. Notre Dame is such a big research uni­versity, I've gotten the impression that teaching is not what they want to be there for. I would just rather not bother them," she said. 
Students also said they usually attend office hours for a specific purpose -with a question about a test or a lecture -rather than sim­ply to talk to professors about issues unrelated to class. 
"I am goal-oriented, and if I'm going to meet with a teacher, infor­mation that I expect to get is going to be on the test," Webster said. 
Students also said their parents instilled in them a strong work ethic, and they recognize that their parents often make financial sacri­fices for them to attend Notre Dame. Because of these factors. students said they do not often con­sider entering academia and becoming professors, as they feel obligated to graduate with a "firm" career path in mind. 
'We are heavily weighted toward the corporate world and the career world here," Eric Wooldridge said. 
Some also said that. perceptions of academia and a general lack of knowledge about what professors actually do might cause an unfair stigma towards becoming one. 
"Maybe a lot of students don't know what it [academia] entails and hear. 'You'll be in the lab all day' -which can maybe cause a stigma," Campbell said. 
Robert Gibbs, a financ('}psycholo­gy major, said that parental influ­ence may also lead students to choose a major that satisfies their parents and may lead to a finan­cially successful career. However, he said this perception probably extends to the general college pop­ulation as opposed simply to Notre Dame. 
"I think there might be pressure felt to choose a major based on what [would give) a comfortable liv­ing because ... your parents have sacrificed to put you through col­lege," he said. "I think a lot of peo­ple chose majors based on that ­they feel like they owe it to their parents."

to see that what we are learning in class has practical applications," she said. 
The Honors Perspective 
like other Notre Dame students, undergraduates in the University's Honors Program and those recom­mended for prestigious scholar­ships like the Rhodes said they tend to engage in intellectual dis­course outside of the classroom and see little difference between themselves and the rest of Notre Dame undergraduates. 
"It's not a division between Honors Program students and non­Honors program students," said senior Mary Mullen, an honors stu­dent and English/Political Science double major. "It's a division between people for whom academ­ics is their first priority [and those for whom it is not]. You can learn many things at college, and aca­demics are part of that." 
Josh Stuchlik, an Honors Program student and a Rhodes Scholarship candidate, said he remembers students having many conversations about politics in Sorin College and fervently watch-


Death

Counselors had made arrange­ments for Berg to live independently in his own apartment within the upcoming month, she said. 
In light of these improvements, Berg's mother said the suicide was completely unexpected by the treat­ment center counselors. 
'They think something snapped in him," she said. "He was not suici­dal." 
Until his junior year, friends and family said Berg loved being a stu­dent at Notre Dame. 
"He was valedictorian of his high school class. He wanted to go to Notre Dame since he was a little kid," his mother said. "He was ecstatic [about getting into the London Program.]" 
"We used to play pool all the time," said Kristin Cordova, one of Berg's friends who kept in touch through e-mail. "One of the best 


Elections 
continued from page 1 
Municipal elections tend to draw less attention from the pub­lic sector because, often, none of the highly dramatized events that occur on the state or federal lev­els is present among local candi­dates. 
Ironically, local issues are not thought to be as important as some of the debates occurring on the federal level, even though attending to local issues would affect more citizens than would most federal issues, Ayala said. 
He said students and faculty might be motivated to vote more often if they keep in mind that beneficial changes in their every­day lives cannot occur if they do not let their politicians know there is a problem. 
"The next time [one] com­plain[s] that there are not enough fun things to do in town, or that the roads ... tear up your car, or that you wish downtown had more diverse entertainment options, remember that munici­pal elections play a large part in deciding these questions," Ayala said. "If you want the city to be more responsive to your needs and wishes, you frrst need to reg­ing presidential debates and elec­tions. 
"Students are very engaged in matters about news and politics," he said. 
like Stuchlik, Mullen said that the small classes and frequent required colloquia common to the Honors Program have allowed her a greater forum for the exchange of ideas outside of the classroom. However, she said her personal interest in academics has driven her to actively attend many lec­tures on campus. 
"I just think that because I'm really interested in academics and in making the most of my four years here ... I have gone to a lot of the lectures," she said. 
Mullen also said she has found the ability of Notre Dame students to integrate academic issues with their conversations to be an impressive quality. 
"The percentage of people who talk [about academics] outside of class is pretty high at Notre Dame. The way that people think. I'm pretty impressed with all the time . .. how people in normal conversa­tions can tie it [academics] in is really incredible," she said.

memories [was] dining hall dinners. I always remember Brian's smile." 
Berg was also "extremely close" to his younger sister. currently a junior in high school, his mother said. 
"He was really fun-loving," said senior Annie Moranski, who dated Berg during their freshmen and sophomore years. "He always made us laugh." 
like his mother, Moranski said news of Berg's death was unexpect­ed. 
"It came as a huge shock. I've never lost someone close to me," she said. 
Ed Mack, rector of O'Neill Hall, Berg's former dorm, said a memori­al Mass is being planned for later this week. 
Funeral services for Berg will be held Wednesday at 10 a.m. at St. Cecilia Catholic Church in DeMotte, Ind. A visitation will be held from 4 to 8 p.m. today at Jackson Funeral Services in DeMotte, Ind.

ister a response." 
Students and faculty are also working to make the process of voting easier on campus in the hopes of encouraging more stu­dents to take part in the elec­tions. 
Sarah Wheaton, a freshman student council officer, said the Progressive Student and Faculty Alliance soon will be holding a voter registration drive for stu­dents in the library during the day and at night. At the drive, registration forms and informa­tion on absentee voting will be provided. The College Democrats will also be holding a registration drive, tentatively planned for the start of the spring semester. Further details for both drives will be provided at a later date. 
In the South Bend area, one of the most important races is between mayoral incumbent Democrat Stephen Luecke and his Republican challenger Thomas Schmidt. If Luecke wins and serves the entire length of his term, he will become the longest-serving mayor of South Bend in history, surpassing the nine years of mayoralty by cur­rent Indiana Governor Joe Kernan.

Holy Cross are extremely limited. We have a long-standing relation­ship with these schools, and we want to share with them the enjoyment of our sporting events." 
The timing of the sale was also called into question. 
"It's discouraging. I had classes all morning, like a lot of people, and really had no other option but to come later," said Bridget Tuohy, a McGlinn freshman. "Hopefully, my schedule next year will let me get here earlier, because that seems to be the only solution." 
Stanford sophomore Mike 
Savino also expressed his discon­tent at being sent away without a ticket. 
"It's great to see all this excite­ment, but I wish there were more student tickets available so every­one could join in," Savino said. 
Those arriving earlier in the day were greeted with snaking lines and free Krispy Kreme donuts, handed out by men's bas­ketball head coach Mike Brey. 
Also involved in the morning's event was the Leprechaun Legion, arguably the loudest and most public source of student support for the men's basketball team. In conjunction with Sports Promotions and the athletic department, the Legion distrib­uted green shirts for students to wear to the games in a display of solidarity.

"The goal of the Legion is to unify the student body, to bring all of the students together in support of the team and to intimi­date the opposing team," said junior Eric Tarnowski, vice presi­dent of marketing for the Legion. "That's what these shirts will do." 
Despite ticket shortages and short tempers, the sale proved the student body's anticipation of an impressive basketball season and continuation of athletic sup­port in the face of current disap­pointment. 
"Everyone's excited about the new season," Tarnowski said. "It'll be good to get something fresh in the way of sports."

Spain closes border with Gibraltar 
GIBHAL;rAR -Spain briefly closed ofT its border with Gilbraltar on Monday while a cruise ship with some 2,000 passengers, including several dozen sickened by a highly contagious stomach virus, docked at the British colony. 
The 13-hour border closing -the first in nearly two decades -angered London, which called the move unnecessary, and temporarily kept several hundred people from entering the tiny territory from Spain. Spain and Britain regularly disagree over the sovereignty of the once-strategic military post. 
The British-owned Aurora, which was denied entry to a Greek port on Friday because of the illnesses, docked for 11 hours at Gibraltar. About 50 passengers stayed on board while the rest of the passengers, most­ly Britons, were allowed to go ashore.

Days of heavy rain triggered a surge Sunday night in the Bahorok River, which winds through the village of Bukit Lawang. Dozens of inns and restaurants that line its banks were destroyed. 
Most of the village's 2,500 people were asleep when the flood hit. Many had been observing the dawn-to-dusk fast of the Hamadan holy month and had gone to bed early in order to rise for a pre-dawn meal.

Most of the money -nearly $34 million -will go toward helping state and local law enforcement and emergency personnel pay for planning, training and equipment for first responders. 
Another $10 million will help Jaw enforce­ment agencies detect and prevent acts of terrorism, particularly attacks involving weapons of mass destruction. 
Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge said that for the first time, agencies can now apply for the grants online. 
"No longer will our state and local part­ners have to go to different places within the departments to apply for terrorism­related funding," Ridge said in a statement. 
Since March, the Department of Homeland Security has awarded nearly $4 billion in grants to the nation's first respon­ders.

KABUL -Two years after the fall of the Taliban, the Afghan gov­ernment unveiled a his­toric draft constitution Monday, aiming to cast aside a quarter-century of conflict with a unified Islamic state under a pow­erful presidency. 
The draft makes 
Afghanistan an Islamic 
republic but stops short of 
imposing the harsh brand 
of Islamic law favored by 
the Taliban, and for the 
first time enshrines a per­
manent role for women in 
governing the country. 
Still, turning the docu­ment's guarantees of equality, liberty, dignity and free speech into reali­ty in a country lacking all of them will be a singular challenge for President Hamid Karzai and future Afghan leaders. 
The draft, containing 160 articles in 12 ~hap­ters, is to be presented next month for approval at a constitutional loya jirga, or grand council, of some 500 delegates from across the country. Nationwide elections would then be scheduled in June. 
The document was the result of a year's work ­and months of delay ­reflecting deep divisions and fierce back-room struggles inside the 35­member Constitutional Review Commission. 
The most dramatic change from earlier drafts was the elimination of the post of prime minister and concentration of power in the president -who will be commander in chief of the military, have the power to appoint one-third of the parliament's upper house, and to name judges, military officers, police and national securi­ty officials.

allegiances and ethnic groups -where warlords rule like feudal princes in areas that seem frozen in time -will be the consti­tution's true test. 
"The degree of centraliz­ing that you see here is for the time being simply wishful thinking, unless there's going to be a change of the balance of power between the center and the provinces," said Vikram Parekh, senior analyst on Afghanistan for the International Crisis Group think tank. "Frankly, I don't see in the near term how that's going to be implementable." 
The draft's first article declares "Afghanistan is an Islamic Republic," an indication of the govern­ment's desire to bring the 
country together under the banner of Islam, practiced by almost all Afghans. 
"The religion of Afghanistan is the sacred religion of Islam. Followers of other reli­gions are free to perform their religious ceremonies within the limits of the provisions of Ia w," the draft states, according to an English translation pro­vided by the government. 
At a ceremony at the Presidential Palace, red­bound copies of the draft constitution were handed to former King Mohammad Zaher Shah, President Karzai and Lakhdar Brahimi, special envoy of 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. 
"I hope this will be acceptable for the people and will direct people toward peace, security and democracy," said the 88­year-old Zaher Shah. 

The constitution accords for the former king the ceremonial title of "Father of the Nation." But it has no provisions for the monarchy to continue after his death -an issue that could be contentious in southern regions loyal to Zaher Shah. 
Many feared a strong prime minister could have emerged as a political and military rival to the presi­dent, a major concern in a country that has known lit­tle but war for the past generation. Much debate focused on limiting the powers of that position before the commission decided to drop it entirely. 
ISRAEL 

Foreign reporters to need 'accreditation' 
Associated Press 

JERUSALEM -Israel will force journalists to undergo stringent checks by its Shin Bet security service as a requirement for accreditation, the head of the Government Press Office said Monday. 
Israeli and foreign journalists criti­cized the measure as an attempt to inhibit freedom of the press. 
The Foreign Press Association said that while it understands Israel's security problems, there is no evi­dence that journalists pose a risk. The new policy gives Israeli authorities "unreasonable veto power" over who can serve as a foreign correspondent, the association said in a statement. 
Citing security concerns, Government Press Office director Daniel Seaman said he decided to hand a list of more than 17,000 accredited journalists to the Shin Bet for security checks beginning Jan. 1. 
Until now, only Palestinian journal­ists were checked by the Shin Bet, Seaman said. Under the new policy, Israeli and foreign journalists will also have to go through a security check, although it will not be as thorough as that given to Palestinians, he said. 
"I am sure that [the Shin Bet] have the intelligence information regarding people who could present a danger ... and therefore they have to give their opinion," Seaman told Israel Radio. 
The press office stopped issuing ere­dentials to most Palestinian journal­ists in the West Bank and Gaza ­many of whom work for foreign press agencies -shortly after Israeli­Palestinian fighting erupted three years ago. 

The Government Press Office is responsible for overseeing the needs of all journalists in Israel, both domestic and foreign. The office issues credentials, helps arrange visas for foreign journalists and distributes information about news conferences and other events. 
Seaman said that after journalists are accredited under the new system. the Shin Bet will evaluate them and inform the press office if they pose a threat.

example, that a quarter of the nation's largest broker­age houses helped favored clients illegally trade mutual funds after hours. That finding moved Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-111., to ask: "We're talking about serious, wholesale criminal violations coming to light, aren't we?" 
Fitzgerald is chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee examining the burgeoning mutual fund scandal and the regulators' response. A House panel is also holding hearings this week on the debacle, which has tar­nished the reputation of mutual funds, traditionally viewed as a safe. conserva­tive investment. Some 90 million people have money in U.S. stock mutual funds; half of all American house­holds invest in them. 
Stephen Cutler, the SEC's enforcement director, told the subcommittee he want­ed to "emphasize that we will aggressively pursue those who have violated the law and injured investors as a result of ille­gal late trading, market timing, self-dealing or any other illegal activity we uncover." 
The agency's investiga­tion is "continuing on mul­tiple fronts," said Cutler. 
Companies must be forced to pay back to investors the hefty fees received for managing mutual funds while they allowed fund trading abus­es to occur, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer testified. 
"This number will be big. It will impose pain, and it should," he said. 
Repayment of manage­ment fees would be in addition to restitution to shareholders of profits made from alleged improp­er trading, said Spitzer, who charged in September that preferential trading deals for big-money cus­tomers at mutual fund companies were taking bil­lions of dollars from ordi­nary investors. 

Since then, dozens of firms have been subpoe­naed, including Fidelity Investments, Janus Capital Group, Morgan Stanley and Vanguard Group. 
Sen. Susan Collins, H­Maine, head of the full Senate committee, said she found it shocking that the trading practices, "which benefit a select group of individuals at the expense of the vast majority of mutual fund investors, continue." 
gery," even though her doctor object­ed. "It kind of sums up (patients') worst fears about HMOs." 
The court also agreed to hear a companion case from Texas involving a post-polio patient required to use a cheaper pain pill than his doctor had recommended. Juan Davila claims he suffered bleeding ulcers and nearly had a heart attack. 
Calad, of Sugar Land, and Davila of Denton, ended up in the emergency room, and both later sued over allegedly shoddy treatment. 
Patients' rights advocates and trial lawyers say HMOs need the threat of lawsuits to ensure they don't short­change patients. liMOs say lawsuits drive up costs for everyone and they must draw the line somewhere. 

Employer-sponsored health insur­ance covers nearly 160 million employees and their families, as well as 16 million retirees, according to court filings in a related lawsuit. As of 2001, 93 percent of employees with employer-sponsored health plans were enrolled in some kind of managed care. 
Some in Congress have pushed for national patients' right legislation that would allow patients to sue over alleged injuries, and HMOs lobbied hard against it. The broadest recent effort faltered two years ago. 
So there remains only a web of unwieldy laws and lower court rul­ings governing where patients can bring their lawsuits and what they can ask for.

An endangered culture 

I have always felt like a person with­out a past. Unlike people who can trace their families back to some far away time and place, I am unjustly ignorant of my cultural identity. Due to two of history's greatest crimes Kamarla Porter -Middle Passage and the enslavement of Breaking the Africans -black Habit Americans such as myself are lacking the most basic personal right -knowledge of their ancestors and history. 
Because of this void, I decided to venture on a CSC Seminar to the South Carolina Sea Islands and learn about the Gullah people-a rare group of African-Americans. The Gullah people are ancestors of West Africans, stolen in the slave trade and brought to the United States. In an early headhunting exercise, slave traders noticed these people from countries along the coast­line including Sierra Leone, Senegal, Gambia and Liberia practiced efficient methods of cultivating rice. 
Thus, traders tore countless Africans from their homes. languages, cultures and families to both harness these effective growing techniques and exploit the people for slave labor. The Africans who survived the high con­centration of disease and cargo (peo­ple) dumps of the Middle Passage had a greater evil waiting for them-slav­ery. 
The story of the Gullah people in the Sea Islands is quite uncharacteristic compared to other plantation experi­ences in the south. Due to the tropical climate conditions and malaria, whites could not settle on the islands and impose the typical violence-based plantation dynamic. Therefore, Africans lived and worked in rice fields with little influence from whites. In these conditions, cultural attributes of West Africa such as the craft of sweet-grass basket-making survived, while other aspects were blended among the community with the new environment. The Gullah language consists of a mix­ture of words from various African tongues, European languages of slave captors and English, with its own unique syntax and structure. 
After the Civil War, the newly freed peoples of the Sea Islands bought and maintained the land of their captivity since the property was isolated and of no value to whites -yet. 
Unfortunately, within the last 50 years, the Sea Islands have trans­formed from an intolerable living area to prime real estate for vacation and luxury development. Now the culture­crushing tactic already dished out to African-Americans during slavery times is being served up big time to the Gullah People. Every aspect of their culture stands at risk of annihilation. 
Building companies working to con­struct unnatural paradises like Hilton Head, Kaiwah and Seabrook Islands Resorts tracked down Gullah people who had moved away or directly approached land holders and basically bamboozled them out of their land. Either by flashing a suitcase full of dol­lar bills or presenting perplexing con­tracts of sale, developers snatched up land to erect golf courses, vacation homes and gated communities. 
Now sweet-grass basket makers have to buy the needed grass from Florida because chemicals used in the upkeep of resorts and golf courses kill the crop, or "No Trespassing" signs prohibit people from collecting the grass within gated areas. Gullah peo­ple need special passes to pay homage to their ancestors buried on former plantations -now resorts for the rich. 
America's suppression of every speaking pattern outside the King's English forces the Gullah language into hiding. People only use it in their own homes or with other Gullah people. Viewed as uneducated and low, the Gullah language has become a source of undue shame for blacks. 

Resorts and gated communities not only disrupt the equilibrium the Gullah people established with the land, but also raise the property taxes of natives. When they are unable to keep up with the modern, unforgiving econ­omy, the property their ancestors culti­vated for centuries is stolen from them in tax auctions. Lacking the isolation that facilitated cultural survival, the Gullah people are going through the same assimilate-or-perish, cultural imperialist tactics suffered by all non­white peoples of this country. 
The white-capitalist-patriarchal social structure in all its forms and applications spells the end of contem­porary articulations of Gullah culture on a mass scale. Certain aspects may survive in individual families or insu­lated communities, but the "white man" is showing the Gullah people, as other blacks have already experienced, difference is not welcome and resist­ance is futile. 
I, for one, am not ready to give up on the Gullah culture. The people of the Sea Islands stand as ambassadors to a home blacks today will never know; their language, music, crafts, and tra­ditions are more valuable than any­thing I can imagine. 
I urge everyone to learn about this nuanced community, as the partici­pants of the Gullah Seminar did this semester. And if you find yourself on the seventh tee on some golf course at Hilton Head or any of the other Sea Islands, remember that that land once belonged to a people stolen for slavery and oppressed in freedom.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Homophobic remarks disturbing 
I am writing this letter out of pure disgust with respect to how I saw many of the students at the FSU-ND game act this past Saturday when the FSU band took the field before the game and during half time. When the FSU band came onto the field to play before the game started, I noticed that they had a male baton twirler as part of their group. I couldn't help but think how cool it was to see someone break a gen­der barrier and participate in something that he looked to be really enjoying. 
However, I was astounded when I heard the Notre Dame student section's response to his entry onto the field. Many students, mainly men, immediately began to laugh and call him insulting names like "fairy," "flamer" and one person, after he started twirling the fire batons. even stated, quite loudly, "He doesn't need the fire batons! He's flaming enough as it is!" 
First of all, just because he is a baton twirler does not mean that he is gay. Second of all, even if he is gay, it is com­pletely inappropriate for the student section to be shouting such insults at him. Are these students so insecure about their heterosexuality that they feel the need to shout these insulting names onto the field and act in such a juvenile manner? Is this the way Notre Dame students want visitors to the campus to see us? Do we want to be seen as a campus that has such an intolerance towards people that don't follow the norm of society that we feel the need to make fun of them for it? 
I, for one, do not want to be counted as part of this campus if this is the way that students here are going to act. I think it is time that these students go back to kindergarten so they can relearn the basic grade school teachings of decency of behavior and respect for others.

First, let's look at 
student life and then I'll meander into 
a more meditative look at Oxford. 
Allow me to correct a misimpression that I reported in the last column. From what I have seen of student drinking here at Oxford, there is not the culture of binge drinking that is so prevalent at Notre Dame. While the Oxford students on average probably drink the same amount of alcohol as their counterparts under the Dome, the atmosphere here is more open, tolerant and embracing of the drinking culture, and so students seem to drink not to get drunk, but for the pleasure and enjoyment of alcohol. The Notre Dame community can learn much from the healthy way that alcohol is embraced at Oxford. 
Second, there are so many more opportunities to relax and talk at Oxford than there are at Notre Dame. For example, there are dozens of small, ethnic restaurants throughout the city, serving food in casual environments perfect for chatting and lamenting the weather (which, to be honest, really isn't that bad). One of the other Domers here succinctly summed up the differ­ences between South Bend and Oxford while we were dining at a fancy Italian Notre Dame as night from day.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Dorm rivalries taken too far 
<I 

On the night before Halloween, stu­dents from Keenan Hall participate in a traditional community service event known as the Keenan Great Pumpkin. As a symbol of our pride and commit­ment to the event, the men of Keenan hang a huge wooden sign in the shape and color of a pumpkin that reads: "Coming soon, the Keenan Great Pumpkin." During the Great Pumpkin, students from Keenan and other dorms take young children from the local Boys and Girls Club trick-or-treating at all of the participating dorms on campus. As an event where students volunteer their time to help local kids, this is surely an activity that I believe all stu­dents should support and embrace. 
When I woke up for breakfast last Wednesday morning, I saw something that made me ashamed of some of my fellow Domers; when I looked up at the big, orange sign, I saw something that turned my pride in Keenan Hall into disappointment in Notre Dame: during the night, someone from a rival dorm of Keenan Hall defaced the Great Pumpkin sign. I have only one question for the perpetrators of this act: Why? 
Why did you feel the need to mar a sign that supports a community service event to help eight-year-old kids? Even if you have a rivalry with the dorm hosting the service event, why would you ruin it for the children who wanted to have a fun night of trick-or-treating? 
Even for those people who have the 
attitude of "I would never have done it, 
but I think it's hilarious that someone else did"-perhaps you are more a 
part of the problem than you realize, and you need to rethink your attitude. 
In any event, it is not my place to spec­
ulate or point a finger. 
I was dismayed tonight when I heard the rector of Keenan Hall, Father Mark Thesing, announce a new rule regard­ing Christmas light decorations to help prevent vandalism. Christmas lights hanging on Zahm and Keenan Hall can­not hang less than eight feet from the ground, so that the lights cannot be cut by someone on the ground. The rule was created because both dorms' lights displays were cut last year. This rule, based on the failure of Notre Dame stu­dents to respect each other, makes me disappointed in and ashamed of my fel­low Notre Dame students. Even though one of Keenan's signs has already been vandalized, I call on students from both dorms to respect each other's Christmas light displays this year, show respect and class to all other dorms, and to overcome 011r rivalries and take pride as a single Notre Dame communi­ty. 
Patrick Corrigan freshman Keenan Hall Nov. 3 

No 300-student lecture halls, with homework and tests; nope, just simple face-to-face interrogation, the crucible of the mentor's knowledge squeezing out every last drop of the unformed, vague and hazy from my thoughts. 
But, as at Notre Dame, most of my time is spent in my hall (or College, at Oxford). New College is universally regarded as one of the most beautiful colleges, with good reason. When New College was built in the middle of Oxford's late-14th century red-light district, part of the agreement was that the College would maintain the walls. And so it has preserved, these many years, its medieval wall: the stairs that lead to the archer posts, the turrets and crenellations, the gargoyles strug­gling to emerge from the rock face. 
What characterizes Oxford as an institution is the balance, the tension between the old and the new. As Susan Sontag professed in her acceptance speech of the Friedenspreis, "old and new are the perennial poles of all feel­ing and sense of orientation in the world," and Oxford is constantly trying to synthesize the two, to reconcile tuto­rials with higher expenses, decaying buildings with diesel, liberal education with science. Oxford is a place where the past meets the future, and this is the bond between Oxford and Notre Dame: the attempt to preserve while innovating.

DVD REVIEW 
'Reloaded' DVD does not fire on all cylinders 
By TIM MASTERTON Scene Movie Critic 
One billion dollars. 
The first two installments of The Matrix have already grossed over a bil­lion dollars. and with The Matrix Revolutions due out this Wednesday, Matrix fever is starting to spread again. The movie's creators, brothers Larry and Andy Wachowski, have established an empire of merchandise, from video games to comic books, and arc poised to make even more with the release of The Matrix Reloaded on 
ovo. 
Reloaded picks up where the first 111m left off and is only half of the final chapter to this story. Hather unconven­tionally, Reloaded was released in May, leaving fans hanging for months with its huge cliffhanger ending -but that will soon be resolved with Revolutions. 
The complex story of Reloaded makes that of the first film look relatively sim­ple by comparison. Keanu Heeves is back as Neo, prophesizcd to be "The One" to save humans from destruction by the machines that have taken over both the world and the majority of humans' bodies and minds. Reeves still retains his stone-cold delivery of lines, but who cares? It somehow works in this fascinating trilogy of movies. Back, too. are multiple philosophical and reli­gious references, making this film appealing on many levels. 
Like most other sequels, there are the typical bigger-and-better fights and action scenes. But very little about any of these films can be called typical. The revolutionary bullet-time camera tech­niques are used again in Reloaded to good effect when Neo flies, or, as one character notes, does "his su·perman thing." (Yes, now he can fly.) 
The highlight of Reloaded is the one­of-a-kind car chase staged on a one­mile stretch of highway built especially for the movie. The mix of.real stunts and computer-generated imagery pro­vides a seamless end result that will keep anyone on the edge of his seat. Only so much can be said or written about it. You just need to see this scene for yourself. 
Some Matrix fans have complained about a few seemingly unnecessary scenes, including those depicting the developing love between Neo and . Trinity's (Carrie-Anne Moss and one showing some sort of techno dance orgy that is too long and wholly excessive. Another fight scene between Nco and hun­dreds of agents drags on and ends when Neo flies away. Why didn't he just do that in the first place? However, the film 

has very few major, glaring flaws. 
The quality of the movie itself on DVD is outstanding. Although released as a two-disc set, don't get the wrong idea. There isn't much here beyond the film itself. Disc One features the film in its original widescreen format. The images are crisp, and the sound is phe­nomenal. Even though most students don't have flat-screen TVs and sur­round sound in their dorm rooms, Reloaded is still worth a view. You will probably want to go back and watch that highway chase again and again. 
Disc Two includes "an explosion of mind-freeing features," or so the DVO case promises. Even though Reloaded will help you put off your homework, don't waste your time on Disc Two. The only things worth watching are a "How They Did It" explaining the aforemen­tioned chase and a parody entitled The MTV Movie Awards Reloaded. featuring a hilarious performance by Will Farrell as the film's character, the architect. Unless French subtitles and Matrix­inspired advertising excite you, skip the rest of this disc. 
Although some, myself included, may find some elements of Reloaded to complain about, it is overall a thrilling movie and a great showcase for cut­ting-edge film technology. It picks up where the first movie left off and sets the stage for the all-out war between man and machine to be concluded in theaters this Wednesday. Like any good entertainment should do, Reloaded succeeds in leaving the viewer wanting more.

Hollywood injects Christmas cheer into holiday season 
A..ociated Press 
At last, a holiday-movie season with real tinsel. 
Amid the blockbuster big guns of The Matrix Revolutions and The Lord of the flings: The Return of the King, 
Hollywood serves up a wealth of warmhearted fare to put audiences in the holiday spirit, including three very different Christmas-themed comedies. 
Elf is a merry boy-raised-by­Santa's-helpers tale starring Will Ferrell as a towering human who leaves his adopted home at the North Pole to find his real dad (James Caan) in New York City. Ed Asner plays the world-weary Santa Claus. 
Love Actually is a big, fat ensemble romance set in the weeks before Christmas, with whipsmart dialogue and a cast of lovelorn Londoners including Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman. Colin Firth, Laura Linney and Hugh Grant as Britain's bachelor prime minister. 
Bad Santa stars Billy Bob Thornton (who pops up briefly in Love Actually as the imperious U.S. president) in a black comedy about a thief who learns the meaning of the season while posing as a mall Santa to pull a robbery. 
Directed by Terry Zwigoff. who made the art-house hit Ghost World, Bad Santa co-stars the late John Hitter as the mall manager. With Joel and Ethan Coen as executive produc­
ers, the movie promises a blend of sentiment and Coen brothers weird­ness, Thornton said. 
"It's like an episode of South Park that turns into It's a Wonderful Life," Thornton said. "It's definitely the alternative Christmas movie.... We'll hit you with a right cross, then the other holiday movies will come along to bandage you up." 
Elf is a crowd-pleasing mix of slap­stick, fish-out-of-water silliness and childlike heart as Ferrell takes Manhattan with nothing more than his bottomless Christmas cheer and a dorky elf suit. 
Ferrell said he could relate to the character's naive innocence and holi­day spirit. 
"One of the things that struck me about playing this character is that it was so appealing to play someone who's very earnest, is completely nonjudgmental and accepting of any­one and everyone," Ferrell said. 
Love Actually could have taken place any old time, but writer-direc­tor Richard Curtis, who wrote Four Weddings and a Funeral and Nolting Ifill, said "Christmas is the time when you sort of have a go at things romantic.... It's the time when love is most likely to burst out both in its happy and sad forms, and people are most likely to say the unsayable." 
Among Hollywood's other comfort­food movies for the holidays: Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat, with Mike Myers; Mona Lisa Smile, starring Julia Hoberts as a progressive art-
history teacher who inspires students at a close-minded women's college in the 1950s; Eddie Murphy's The Haunted Mansion, a family comedy based on Disney's theme-park attrac­tion; the romantic comedy Something's Cotta Give, featuring Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton in the story of a womanizer who loses his taste for sweet young things when he falls for someone in his own age bracket. 
Also: a remake of Cheaper by the Dozen, with Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt as a couple that missed a few Planned Parenthood sessions on their way to having 12 kids; Martin again as the villain in Looney Tunes: Back in Action, a live-action and cartoon combo that pairs Brendan Fraser with Bugs, Daffy and other Warner Bros. favorites; the huge-screen IMAX exclusive The Young Black Stallion, a prequel to the 1979 horse tale; and Peter Pan, a live-action adaptation of J.M. Barrie's story of young girl Wendy and her pal Peter, the boy who won't grow up, directed by P.J. Hogan (My Best Friend's Wedding). 
Jason Isaacs, who plays the villain­ous Capt. Hook and Wendy's father, said people who know the story only from Disney's spry animated version will be surprised at the movie's dark depths. 
The film also casts a boy, Jeremy Sumpter, as Peter, breaking with the old stage tradition of putting older women in the role. 
"I remember having seen one of these horrible stage versions with slightly menopausal women dressed in green tights, slapping their thighs," Isaacs said. "As a young boy, I couldn't understand why this little girl Wendy fancied this 50-year-old woman." 
The season's serious fare includes four heavy-duty 19th century tales: 
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, with Russell Crowe as a Napoleonic-era British ship's ··­captain in a deadly high-seas duel; The Missing, Hon Howard's savage Western about redemption between a pioneer woman (Cate Blanchett) and her estranged father (Tommy Lee Jones); Nicole Kidman, Jude Law and Renee Zellweger in Cold Mountain, adapted from Charles Frazier's Civil War best seller; and Tom Cruise in The Last Samurai, about a disen­chanted American soldier who finds renewal amid culture-clash strife in Japan. 
Also coming are 21 Grams, starring Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro in a sober drama of grief and mortality; Tim Burton's Big Fish, with Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor in a father-son reunion fantasy; /louse of Sand and Fog, the story of an ex-Iranian bigwig (Ben Kingsley) fighting for possession of a home with its former owner'(Jennifer Connelly); and Michael Caine in The Statement, Norman Jewison's thriller about an aging Nazi collaborator run­ning from assassins.

Equestrian club places third in first competition 
Special to The Observer 
The Notre Dame and Saint Mary's Equestrian club com­pleted its first semester com­petition placing third in a pair of IHSA Horse Shows this weekend at Taylor University. On Saturday, the Irish earned 25 points to trail first place Earlham University's 36 points and IUPUI, with 32 points. 
Irish co-captain Liz Bell was high point rider, while Indiana's Julie Goodman took reserve high point rider hon­ors. Each rider had won her respective jump and flat class­es, and the winner was deter­mined with a ride-.off. 
Others earning points for the Irish were Katie Baron, fourth, and Claire Freeman, sixth in open jump A. Kelsey Ostberg, second in open flat C and fourth in open jump B, Liz Bell, first in both intermediate jump A and open flat B, with Freeman second, Andrea Oliverio, second in novice jump B and fourth in novice flat B, Baron third in open flat A, Catherine Linn third in novice jump A and fifth in novice flat A, Kristin LaSota third in advanced walk trot canter and Kendall Anderson second in walk trot. 
On Sunday, the club finished with 22 points behind Purdue and runner-up IUPUI with 31 and 28 points respectively. Ostberg earned high point rider honors, edging Lucy Withers of IUPUI, who finished reserve high point rider. Osteberg, teammate Lauren Ball and Withers all participat­ed in a ride-off as they finished in a three-way tie for the show. 
Ostberg took first in open flat B and second in open jump B, while Ball took first in novice flat B and second in novice jump C. Oliverio also garnered a first in novice jump B and sixth in novice flat A, while Freeman took first in open flat C and fourth in open jump B. Baron finished third in both 
Guillen nam.ed White Sox m.anager 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Ozzie Guillen was certain he was the right person to be the new manager of the Chicago White Sox, regardless of what his resume did or didn't say. 
1\vo hours into his first inter­view, White Sox general manag­er Kenny Williams agreed. 
"The passion, the commit­ment, the energy, the game knowledge, the aggressive atti­tude," Williams said Monday in introducing Guillen as manager of the team where he spent 13 years of his 16-year career. 
"He bleeds White Sox base­ball. There is no doubt in my mind that he is going to provide something here we desperately need. Ajolt, ifyou will." 
When Williams fired Jerry Manuel on Sept. 29 in the wake of the White Sox's colossal melt­down, he was certain he want­ed a manager with experience. Someone who'd been to the postseason, maybe even the World Series. 
Former Toronto manager Cito Gaston was believed to be an early favorite, and Williams said he talked to Tom Kelly and Jim Leyland to see if either had interest in getting back into baseball. 
But then came Guillen. He just retired in 2000, and his only experience was as a coach, the last two years as third base open jump A, and open flat B, Linn placed fifth in novice jump A and Julia Burke took sixth in open flat A. Katy Ryan captured second in novice flat A and Marta Ascadi was sixth in advanced walk trot canter 
A. Lauren Croall brought home another first for the Irish in advanced walk trot canter C, with teammate Kristin LaSota finishing sixth. Kendall Anderson again contributed to the team total, with a fifth in walk trot. 
The club will return to action in the spring. 
Women's Ice Hockey 
The Irish suffered another tough loss this weekend as 

they dropped a 6-1 contest Friday evening at Western Michigan. 
The Broncos' Rhonda Sheahan proved again to be one of the best goalies in the conference as she shut down the Irish attack, which almost doubled Western Michigan in shots on goal. Saint Mary's Megan Mattia scored the only goal for the Irish late in the second period, assisted by Jaky Kehler and Lizzy Coghill. 
The Irish will travel to Michigan State on Nov. 21 to face off with the Spartans, before returning home for a rematch with the Broncos at the Joyce Center the next day. 
Raiders continue to struggle with losses 
Associated Press 
ALAMEDA, Calif. -Rod Woodson jokingly offered up the idea of hanging a sugges­tion box outside Oakland's practice facility for anybody who thinks they can solve the mess the Raiders are in. 
The team's other Woodson, four-time Pro Bowl cornerback Charles Woodson, is at the cen­ter of the turmoil -the off­field stuff anyway. Twice in five days he publicly criticized sec­ond-year coach Bill Callahan, saying Callahan is stubborn and has lost control of his team, and that the Raiders are falling apart. 
On Monday, Callahan called the comments "inappropriate and inaccurate." 
"As long as he comes here to 1220 Harbor Bay, he'll find the team," Rod Woodson said in a nearly empty Raiders locker room. ''I'm pretty sure you can't lose 53 guys. We're not playing hide-and-seek here. You never quit playing, because you play for each other." 
He claims "there is no inter­nal grumbling," but apparently changed his stance upon learn­ing Callahan and Charles Woodson haven't spoken in a month. 

If Oakland hasn't imploded already, the team seems on the brink of major disaster only eight games removed from its Super Bowl loss to Tampa Bay. Callahan insists he isn't wor­ried about his job security and that he still has all faith in his coaching philosophy and the strength of his staff. 
Things became significantly worse Sunday when the Raiders lost 2 3-13 at Detroit, losing their backup-turned­starting quarterback in the process. Marques Tuiasosopo partially tore a ligament his left knee while filling in for injured 2002 MVP Rich Gannon, and the Raiders will likely turn to third-stringer Rick Mirer this week to face the New York Jets. They were beat up enough already. 
"I mean, we lost one game now to the Detroit Lions, who coach says was an outstanding football team," Rod Woodson said. "So, I guess the Jets are going to be -whoooo -they might be going to the Super Bowl." 
The Raiders have reached record lows. They are all but out of the playoff race after a 2­6 start, their worst start since beginning 1-6-1 in 1964. They appear to be losing faith in each other and their coaches. 

coach for the World Series 
champion Florida Marlins. 
Williams set aside four hours 
for their interview, never think­
ing he would need more. 
"By the time that second hour 
hit," Williams said, "I was con­
vinced he was the guy." 
Though Williams' mind was 
already made up, he brought 
Guillen back for a second inter­
view. He offered him the job 
Sunday night, and Guillen 
signed a two-year contract with 
an option for a third year ·Monday. 
"It's an honor for me," Guillen 
said. "It took me a little while to 
get back and wear this uniform. 
Hopefully it'll be the last uni­form I ever wear." 
Guillen's passion for the White Sox is undeniable. The former All-Star shortstop never stopped smiling Monday. And when he walked out the door to catch a plane back to Florida, he was still wearing his new White Sox cap. 
But his honesty impressed Williams, too. Thirty seconds after he walked in the door, Guillen told Williams he wasn't going to try to impress him or tell Williams what he thought the GM wanted to hear. 
He was going to be Guillen, take it or leave it.

PHILADELPIIIA -Billy Wagner questioned Houston ownership's com­mitment to winning. He won't have those problems with the Philadelphia Phillies. 
The All-Star closer was traded Monday from the cost-cutting Astros to the Phillies for right-hander Brandon Duckworth and minor league right-ban­ders Taylor Buchholz and Ezequiel Astacio. 
Wagner, a three-time All­Star, goes from one of baseball's best bullpens to among its worst. The Phillies converted just 33 saves in 51 opportunities as Jose Mesa and Mike Williams both faltered. 

''I'm excited about com­ing to Philadelphia because they obviously have made a commitment to winning a champi­onship," Wagner said. 
Wagner had criticized Astros owner Drayton McLane for not making a move to get another quali­ty starting pitcher for the 2003 season and expected more of the same for next season. 
"It's going to be a tape job," Wagner said after the season finale. "It's not like we're going out there and getting any marquee pitch­ers."

A six-time All-Star who was the team's captain from 1991 until his retirement in 1995, Mattingly was persuaded by owner George Steinbrenner to become the team's hitting coach. While no announcement was made Monday, his hiring was dis­closed by a baseball official with knowledge of the team's decision. A news conference was expected Tuesday. When Mattingly was at Yankee Stadium on Oct. 15 to throw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 6 of the AL championship series, he wasn't sure whether he wanted to return to a full-time role with the team. He replaces Hick Down, who was fired last week after New York hit just .140 with runners in scoring 
his comments after the trade. 
"My comments to Drayton were truthful. They were about winning, not about him being a bad owner," Wagner said. 
Whatever the case, the Phillies are thrilled to have him. General manager Ed Wade said getting a closer was the team's top priority in the offseason. 
"Billy Wagner was at the top of our list," Wade said. 
Phillies manager Larry Bowa compared Wagner to Atlanta's John Smoltz and Los Angeles' Eric Gagne. 
"He's a dominant closer," Bowa said. "There's a big void we filled real quick." 
Wagner was 1-4 with a 

1.78 ERA last season and had 44 saves in 4 7 chances, making a career­high 78 appearances. Mesa converted 24 of 28 saves for the Phillies and had seven losses and a 
6.52 ERA. Williams, an All-Star with Pittsburgh, was 0-4 with a 6.38 EHA and three saves in five chances after being acquired by the Phillies in July. 
The Phillies are moving into a new ballpark in April, and the trade for Wagner has generated a lot of excitement among fans that can translate into increased ticket sales.

Dislocated shoulder injury to keep Bashir out a couple of weeks 
INDIANAPOLIS -Indianapolis safety Idrees Bashir is expected to miss Sunday's game at Jacksonville and is likely to be out longer with a dislocated right shoulder. 
Colts coach Tony Dungy said Bashir will miss "a couple weeks at least" with the injury. He hurt the shoulder while trying to tackle Miami running back Ricky Williams during Sunday's 23-17 victory. 
Bashir has started 37 of 40 games throughout his career. He was replaced Sunday by Jason Doering and Dungy said the Colts would use one of their cornerbacks at safety in practice this week. Dungy gave the Colts an extra off day Monday after their seventh win in eight games. 

Dungy was uncertain whether kick returner Brad Pyatt would play against the Jaguars. Pyatt was injured on a punt return early in the first quarter Sunday when Miami's Tommy Hendricks made a helmet-to-helmet tackle. 
Pyatt laid on the ground for sev­eral minutes as doctors immobi· lized him and he left the field on a stretcher. Dungy said it was a chest injury and Pyatt believed he could play this week. 
"That was a very scary situation," Dungy said. "You feel like he got a concussion or some type of neck injury, but when we went out there, he was saying 'My chest, my chest."' 
The Colts also lost wide receiver Brandon Stokley during the game on Sunday with a concussion. Dungy said the team would conduct neurological tests before clearing him to practice this week and did not rule him out of the Jacksonville game.

Morrissey able to overcome Zahm 20-7 in quarterfinal 
By KEVIN O'NEILL 
Sports Writer 
If the true indicator of the heart of a team is how they respond to adversity, third seeded Morrissey certainly showed themselves to be in possession of heart as mounting an impressive comeback to defeat a valiant Zahm team 20-7 and move one step closer to the Stadium. 
Tailback Nick Klein ran 13 times for 7 5 yards and a touchdown and quarterback Marty Mooney threw for one touchdown and ran for another to lead the comeback. 
Zahm took advantage of a few strategic wrinkles to build the early lead. Defensively, the Rabid Bats came out in a 4-3 scheme instead of their customary 5-2 to "switch it up" according to captain Mike Maimone. The early results were favorable as the Rabid Bat defense stopped the Manorites on their first possession. 
From there, the Rabid Bats used some misdirection in both the run­ning and passing game to spring back-to-hack plays of over 25 yards. That set up a great individ­ual effort from wide receiver Mike Russell who defeated double cover­age to come down with quarter­back Mitch Knapke's pass to make the score 7-0 in favor ofZahm after the extra point. 
The 76-yard drive represented the first time all season the Manorite defense had been scored upon as the result of a long drive, but the Morrissey offense was right there to pick its defense up with a 65-yard scoring drive that was all achieved in the running game. Nick Klein completed the drive on which he had five carries for 55 yards with a 25-yard jaunt around and through the left side of the Zahm defense. 
Following the two-point conver­sion the Manorites suddenly led 8-7 and had forced Zahm to switch back to their customary defense. 

"We had to switch back to the 5­2 to try and stop the run," Maimone said. 
When the Morrissey defense came back on the field, they made it clear that they had settled down, forcing an immediate three and out by allowing just one first down while forcing two turnovers over the remainder of the game. 
"We got our assignments down and played like we had played all 
year  and  tried  to  get  some  
turnovers,"  linebac ker  Brian  
Dinsmore said.  .  

With the defense back to its dom­inating ways, the Morrissey offense was able to mount another scoring drive before the half. With Zahm in the 5-2 to stop Klein, Mooney dropped back, and recognizing that Zahm was in tight man coverage, took off up the left sideline. Mooney had one man to beat as he crossed the Zahm 25, and beat him with an impressive juke to make his run a 60-yard, momentum changing touchdown. 
"I thought the turning point was Mooney's run," Morrissey captain Aaron Ronsheim said. "It was huge to get that score right before the half." 
Following a Dinsmore intercep­tion that positioned the ball at the Zahm 24, the Manorites scored the game-icing 11-yard touchdown on a tipped pass that fell into the arms of Ronsheim. 
Despite the loss, Zahm had a lot to be proud of after starting the season 0-2. 
''I'm satisfied overall." Maimone said. ''I'm proud of our team. We started the year 0-2 and could have folded, but we came back strong and made the playoffs. I think we played them pretty even overall today." The Manorites advance to take

rushing plays behind Kevin McCarthy and Ben Butwin, was one dimensional and admitted­ly so. 
"We're going to run the ball every play, and there's nothing !Sorinl can do about it," a Dillon coach said to Sarin's defense during the fourth quar­ter. 
The persistence of Dillon's running game proved the dif­ference as they used brute force to wear down Sorin and eventually find holes in its defense. 
Dan Block anchored Dillon's defensive line with linebacker Hobert McBride putting pres­sure on the quarterback. The extremely vocal Dillon sideline also was a 12th man on defense that caused false starts on Sorin's offense. 
Dillon realizes that teams will be gunning for them through­out the playoiTs. but they feel ready to face Keenan next Sunday. 
"Being a number one seed is like having a bull's-eye on your back, but we'll be more pre­pared against Keenan next week." Arseniadis said. 
Keenan 10, Knott 7 
Skill, composure and a last minute field goal proved to be the right ingredients for a Keenan victory. 
After a sluggish first half, the Keenan Knights were able to maintain their poise and upset the Knott J uggerknotts 10-7. 
Knott began the first half energetically, as it seized con­trol of the game by maintaining possession of the ball and by stopping Keenan's offense by only allowing one first down. 
Knott's dominance eventually turned fruitful during the sec­ond quarter, as Knott scored the first touchdown of the game. Running back Joe McCarthy ran for 18 yards and dove into the end zone to make the score 7-0. 
Despite Keenan giving up the touchdown, its offense remained stagnant as Knight quarterback and team captain Patrick Downey immediately threw an interception to Alex Fergus and allowed Knott to run the clock to end the first half. 
"We had no life in us during the first half," Downey said. 
Fortunately for Keenan, the offense made a complete turn­around to begin the second half. After dictating play for most of the third quarter, Keenan found the end zone as Downey handed the ball to Reed Langton to tie the score 7­7. 
After allowing the touchdown and struggling defensively dur­ing the third quarter, Knott's defense managed to recover an early fourth quarter fumble. But Knott could not capitalize and was forced punt and allow Keenan to decide the final out­come. 
With 28 seconds remaining in the game, Keenan kicker Andrew Warner kicked a 25­yard field goal to end the game and make the score 10-7. 
Warner was a surprise. as Keenan struggled all year in punting. He was a late replace­ment on the Keenan roster and proved to be a critical asset as Keenan moves on to the second round of the playoffs. 
After leading by a touchdown for most of the game, the loss was a true disappointment for Knott. 
"Everything went our way in the first half," Knott captain Drew Donovan said. "The loss was heartbreaking ... we left everything out on the field."

Ramblers defeat Dawgs on late TD 
By ANNIE BRUSKY 
Sports Writer 

The game went down to the wire, but, in the end, it was Siegfried's well-rounded attack that pulled through with a 10-6 victory over Alumni. 
After taking the lead midway through the first half, Siegfried gave up a touchdown and had to overcome not only a strong defen­sive effort by Alumni but also frus­trating calls in order to score again late in the game. 
"We did really well. It was just as we planned," Siegfried quarter­back Bill Bingle said. "Mental mis­takes hurt us a bit but we came through." 
John Nowak put Siegfried on the board with an 18-yard field goal and the Ramblers went into half­time ahead 3-0. Early in the sec­ond half. Siegfried looked to punt from their own 15-yard line. 
After the snap, punter Eric Cherney saw Alumni's defensive line fast approaching and, know­ing his punt would be blocked, unsuccessfully attempted to throw the ball for a first down. Alumni gained possession deep in Ramblers territory and was able to capitalize on the opportunity by giving the ball to running back Alex Roodhouse. 
Roodhouse made several good runs, ultimately breaking into the end zone for a touchdown. Alumni's first extra point attempt was wide, but it was called back after Siegfried was penalized for roughing the kicker. On the secmid try. a botched snap forced Alumni to look for the two-point conver­sian, but Siegfried's good coverage kept the score 6-3. Siegfried worked its way down the field thanks to clutch plays by Bingle and several of his receivers. 
"We know we have a potent offense. We really used all of our weapons today," Bingle said after six different receivers made recep­tions in the game. 
Bingle connected with receiver Jon Kaup on fourth-and-four to keep the Ramblers' hopes alive. 
A clipping penalty pushed them back, but Kaup and sophomore Marques Bolden made some big receptions to overcome the deficit and move the Ramblers to just within the 10-yard line. On first­and-goal Bingle scrambled to the right until Mike Wahl got open and the two connected for the winning touchdown. 
"It was awesome. Bill made a great play," Wahl said. "He's the best quarterback in the league." 
Alumni, unfortunately, goes home empty-handed and disap­pointed. 
"I think it took us too long to get things going. When we finally did get our offense going we ran out of time," Alumni senior Chris Seponski said. "Siegfried is a good team; their quarterback and receivers do a good job." 
With a number of seniors on the team, Alumni was not ready for their season to end. 
"We went to the championship last year so we wanted to put in more of a fight this year," Seponski said. "We have the talent; things just didn't go our way."

Belles try to end slump 
By DAN TAPETILLO Spotts Writer 
Saint Mary's continued its slump with a 1-0 loss to Albion College Saturday. 
"We are in a bit of a slump right now, and the stats do not necessarily prove how well we have done this sea­son," said Saint Mary mid­fielder Katie Nobel. 
Saint Mary's now stands at a 9-5-3. The Belles now arc in fifth place in the MIAA stand­ings after being ranked sec­ond earlier this season. The Belles have only one won of their last four games, against Hope College. 
Despite the Belles solid defense that consists of Shannon Culbertson, Stephanie Artnak, Carrie Orr and goalie Laura llcline, Albion still managed to score early in the first half. 
"It was a highly physical game," Saint Mary's forward Carolyn Logan said. 
Orr continued to play stellar defense and Heline played a fabulous game added Logan. 
llowever, Saint Mary's does not intend for this loss to affect them during its next game against Olivet this after­noon. 
"We are hoping to get another win," Katie Noble said. "We already beat this team 4-0 earlier this season.. " 
The team is more focused upon Calvin that is Saint Mary's fmal game of the regu­lar season. Calvin gave Saint Mary's difficulties earlier in the season with a 2-2 over­time tie. Noble is depending upon the team to its compo­sure and to end the season on a high note after the two­week slump.

haven't lost faith in the man Alumni Association Executive Director Chuck Lennon calls the captain that sails the ship on the "Sea of Green." 
"I low could you not believe in a man like that? He's been driv­ing us the whole time, and I put this loss completely on myself," Irish quarterback Brady Quinn said. 
With the Irish at 2-6, even winning four straight games would not put them in a bowl game since Notre Dame doesn't accept bowl bids from the lower-tier bowls. 
Therefore. all this team has left is to play for something that has become very common on the mouths of coaches and play­ers once this season went south -pride. That's the message the fifth-year seniors, who only have four games left in an Irish uniform, are trying to pass on to the younger team members with hopes of turning this sink­ing ship around quickly. 
"For me, and this being my fifth year and my last year, it's pride," Notre Dame cornerback Jason Beckstrom said. "The way I try and go about it, and the things I try and tell the younger guys, is that this is a metaphor for life -that's what football is. Despite the fact that we're now 2-6, you can't give up. 
"In life, you're going to get curveballs, you're going to be down, the odds are going to stack against you, but you've got to keep going." 
While the players try to help the coaching staff and Willingham keep the morale up the locker room, ultimately, it comes down to the head man himself. 
"That is always one of the most difficult jobs of any coach, when things aren't going well to keep a team moving forward, to keep them positive," Willingham said. "We will find ways to do that. I can't tell you exactly what they are today. There are still things this football team can accomplish."

T h e Shamrocks started the second half with renewed intensity and two 10-yard runs by run­ning back Raquel Ferrer. However, the Bullfrogs responded to their efforts with Betsy Schroeder blocking a pass intended for Ferrer. 
"Their defense really stepped up and we couldn't really get a long drive together," Wong said of the second half. 
With 10 minutes remaining in the second half. Carter caught another touchdown pass from Heath to guarantee the victory. 
The Bullfrogs were also suc­cessful in their attempt for the 
extra  two  points,  with  
Charlebois catching a  pass  
from Heath.  

Badin's defense maintained the 28-0 lead with a number of interceptions by Huarte and Feeny. 
The Bullfrogs are set to meet Cavanaugh, who had a first round bye, this Sunday and anticipate a hard-fought bat­tle. 
"Everyone has to step up 100 percent for the Cavanaugh game," Carter said. "It's going to come down to individuals. It's definitely going to be the hardest game we've played all season." 
Welsh Family 19, Breen Phillips 0 
Welsh Family emerged with a convincing first round victo­ry, dominating both sides of the ball on route to a 19-0 shutout of fourth-seeded Breen-Phillips. 
A first half touchdown from Melissa Sands to Jamie McEldowney, the first of two connections on the afternoon, set the tempo for what would be a one-sided game con­trolled by Welsh Family who had a 6-0 lead at the half. 
Welsh Family came out fired up in the second half, as Sands only lost one 
game this year before Sunday's encounter with Welsh. 
"Our offense was really working. We ran our routes like [Sands) wanted," McEldowney said. "It was a team effort." 
The Welsh Family defense was impressive itself, looking overpowering as it shut out the Breen-Phillips offense. A Katie Powers second half intercep­tion virtually erased all hope of Breen-Phillips coming back from what was then a 13-0 Welsh lead. 
Breen-Phillips looked anemic on offense, moving the ball inconsistently in the second half. The passing game could­n't get going, and they were forced into quarterback scrambles and draws to move the ball. 
On its final drive, Breen­Phillips failed to complete a pass. 
The win advanced Welsh to the semi-finals against Lewis, the top team in women's inter­hall in the regular season. 
"We played really well," coach Brian Adams said. "Lewis is a great team, too. We'll have to figure them out this week at practice."

Belles want to build on win 
Hope is first-round opponent for Belles in MIAA Tourney 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
The Belles wanted to come into the MIM tournament on a good note, and they accom­plished that goal with a four set victory over Albion Friday. 
Saint Mary's (16-12, 5-9 in the MIAA), who wrapped up the s~xth seed in the tournament, defeated Albion (10-21, 3-11) by the score of 30-28, 30-20, 24­30, 30-28. The Belles will visit third seed Hope (20-12, 11-3) in the first round of the tourna­ment today. 
"It was real important for us to get a win against Albion," coach Julie Schroeder-Biek said. "We really wanted to play Hope, and we were able to solidify our sixth seed with that win." 



ward to Hope, a team that defeated the Belles both times they met during the regular sea­son. Despite her team's lack of success so far against the Flying Dutch, Schroeder-Biek has high hopes for her team's first round match. 
"We've always had a real rivalry with Hope," she said. "We've played them real tough so far this year, even though we lost. They have weaknesses that I know we can take advantage of. 
"This is a team we have a strong desire to beat." 
The Belles are relishing their role as an underdog and spoiler in the postseason. 
"We just want to keep tallying away the wins," Schroeder-Biek said. "We'd really like to go in there and mess up some higher seeds." 
The match is scheduled for 7 p.m.

She added that setter Lauren Temple played an excellent game against Albion, running a potent offense that was able to keep the Britons' defense off­guard. 
"As a team we just played really well," Schroeder-Biek said. "Lauren ran a great offense and really mixed it up. We need to work on getting our middles more involved in the flow, though, going into the tournament." 
The Belles' defense also did a good job of handling Albion's talented outside hitter Krystle Weeks, holding her to only nine kills in the four-game match. Weeks came into the match averaging almost three kills a game. 
For the Belles offensively, out­side hitter Kristen Playko led the team with 19 kills. Libero Alison Shevik was the team­leader in digs with 19; five other players collected more than 10 digs in the match.

Staying the course 
Willingham still confident in direction of program 
By MATT LOZAR Associate Sports Ediror 
How appropriate that Notre Dame coach Tyrone Willingham made a reference to watercraft in his post-game conference against Florida State with Navy coming to South Bend Saturday. 
"The first thing we have to do is get a win this next See Also weekend," 
"Seminoles 
Willingham

said. "We have to get the tone" our ship right­

ed and point­ed in the right direction." 
Everything seems to be head­ing downhill rapidly for the Irish, and suddenly fans don't think Willingham seems like the man to turn around this program like he did last year. But that's not weakening his confidence in the master plan. 
"I don't think it's any question this is one of the toughest spots I've ever been in," Willingham said. "But at the same time, I know what our goal is; our goal is to clearly build this program to be a great team. I still believe that can happen. Sometimes, it's difficult to see. I think we are pointed in the right direction, and we will stay in that direc­tion." 

While at Stanford, Willingham's teams were very inconsistent from year to year. He started his head coaching career with the Cardinal in 1995 with back-to-hack seven win seasons but followed those years with five and three win years. 
However, Willingham led Stanford to the Rose Bowl in 1999 after that 3-8 season for the school's first trip to Pasadena, Calif. in 28 years. Then Stanford followed that year with a disappointing 5-6 cam­paign before Willingham's last year where the team went 9-3. 
At Notre Dame, Willingham started last year with the most wins by a first year coach in Irish history but followed the pattern of his past head coaching career as the.Irish are 2-6 this season. 
But ask the players, and they

LaVere and Duffy lead Irish in win 
By JOE HETTLER Sports Ediror 
Only until she saw the final stats did sophomore point guard Megan Duffy realize just how many assists she had in Notre Dame's first exhibition game of the season -13 to be exact. Duffy will take those and 14 points any game this sea­son.
"''ll take those numbers any night, no matter who we're playing," Duffy said. "I didn't think I had that many assists but I'll take it. It's a good start, something to build on." 
Fellow sophomore Courtney LaVere had 21 points on 10-of­14 shooting and grabbed seven rebounds, while junior forward Jacqueline Batteast added 18 points and 10 boards to lead the Irish to an 85-65 victory over Northwest Sports in an exhibition game Monday night. 
"I thought we did a lot of good things offensively," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. ''I'm really encouraged by the things we did. I thought we ran the ball better and scored a lot

WelshFam beats B-P 
By ANN LOUGHERY and 
BOBBY GRIFFIN 
Sports Writers 
"Clockwork" was the word Badin captain Jenn Carter felt best described the Bullfrogs convincing 28-0 win over the McGlinn Shamrocks Sunday afternoon. 
Beginning with the first offensive drive of the game, the Bullfrogs proved they deserve a life in the postsea­son. After a long sustained offensive drive from their own 15-yard line, the Bullfrogs scored their first touchdown of the game, courtesy of quarter­back Steph Heath. 
Before the end of the first quarter, the Bullfrogs scored another touchdo,vn, this time via a 10-yard pass to receiver Megan Charlebois. 
"Everything just clicked," Carter said of the early offen­sive drives. 
Carter contributed a touch­down towards the end of the

Dillon uses run game to advance 
By STEVE COYER and DAN 
TAPETILLO 
Sports Writers 
The outcome between Sorin and Dillon was a question mark throughout the entire game until a thumbs up marked the end of the uncertainty. 
After a fourth quarter touch­down by Dilltm gave them a 7-0 lead and the victory, the referee gave a thumbs up to signal the made extra point and perhaps also relief for an anxious Dillon sideline. 
Both teams played grind-it­out football all day with aggres­sive defense and mostly rushing plays. The game remained scoreless until the fourth quar­ter, when Dillon quarterback 
A.J. Cedeno rushed for a touch­down on second-and-goal. 
Dillon had a costly penalty in the first quarter that brought back a 30-yard touchdown run. Another penalty canceled a fourth quarter touchdown that would've sealed their victory. 
"We need to address a few things on offense, and we can't keep making mistakes like we did today," Dillon captain J.T. Arseniadis said. 
Sorin played with a 16-man squad but stayed in the game down to its last possession. Overall, they were pleased with the season, notwithstanding the small roster. 
"We had a small team this year but managed to play hard, have fun and take the top seed into the last quarter," Sorin captain Collin O'Keefe said. 
Sarin's ground attack initially was shut down by Dillon's phys­ical defense its passing attack proved more effective. O'Keefe connected with his receivers on two separate 40-yard plays and was 6-of-9 passing for the game. 
Dillon's offense which had 23
