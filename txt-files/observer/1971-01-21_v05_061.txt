The Student Government con· stitution proposed by the Krash­na administration failed to be ratified in the pre-Christmas re­ferendum. Two-thirds of the stu­dent body had to vote for the election to be valid. Only about one-tl1ird of the students voted. 
Of those who did vote, 1507 voted for the charter, 527 cast ballots against the proposal. Twenty-four votes were declared invalid. 

The rreasure carried every hall, except Fisher and Sorin. The majority of off-campus stu­dents voting approved the con­stitution.

Riehle denies foreknowledge of narcotics investigation 
by John Abowd 
In an Observer interview yes­terday Fr. James L. Riehle, Dean of Students, denied that his of­fice had any foreknowledge of the undercover investigation that led to the arrest of four Notre Dame students. 
Riehle addressed himself to rumors that narcotics agents are enrolled as students. "To my knowledge, there are none," he said, "They have never asked me to do this and I wouldn't give them permission to do it." 
"This does not mean that I'm not interested in the problem, because I certainly am,"Riehle added. "Anything that comes to my own personal knowledge is an entirely different thing but its probably well that I say at this time that, to my knowledge, there are no undercover agents here on the campus at all." 
The students arrested eight days before Christmas were charged with selling LSD to an undercover agent working for the South Bend Police. 
Riehle noted that the two arrests made on campus were the first action by South Bend po­lice for drug offe:'!ses. He said the decision to call 'the students to the security office was made because of the attitude some students have toward the police. 
"Anytime a police officer has a warrant for somebody's arrest you can't stop him; it's got to be served. We had to cooperate in a thing like that and we figured that it would be better, rather than have the South Bend police go into the dorm-,' because of some ofthe false'-attitudes about the police ;that some students have, that it would be better for I!S to go in and ask the boy to come dtown,"· Riehle noted. 
He continued, ~·It was a deal only to the extent that we thou~ht it would be; the most prudent thing to·do.'l 
According to Riehle the po­lice had no search warrants for the on-campus room but were able to ~-.-:arc!J the off-campus apartments. "The students' room on campus was not search­ed. In fact, our own security people were the only ones who went ot the room and they had no warrant at all, so they had no right to search the room. The South Bend police did not go into the students' room." 
"I understand the apartments donwtown were searched but they had search warrants," he continued. 1

"Somebody who is under civil arrest could be suspended sum­marily by me until the case has gone to court," Riehle said. "This might be invoked in this particular instance. I consider somebody that sells drugs to other students a potential danger

Park-Mayhew Post-Mortem 
Two distinguished American educators, Dr. Rosemary Park and Dr. Lewis B. Mayhew, have succeeded in writing a clever balance of recommendations designed to balm the egos presently threatened by St. Mary's proposed merger with Notre Dame. What they have failed to do is to produce the promised solution to our present crisis in coeducation. They have failed to either recommend a complete merger with St. Mary's or invent an ingenious excuse for 
maintaining St. Mary's separate identity. One cannot fault them for attempting the latter. At one point the report says, "St. Mary's College has made a distinctive and recognized contribution to the education of Catholic women and it guards its heritage tenaciously and with reason," but chauvinism, mystical vanguards, school spirit and tenacious guards are better suited for basketball than education. The fact that St. Mary's has made contributions to education in the past doesn't alter the fact that it would be better able to make more contributions if it merges with Notre Dame. According to the report, the difference in the intent and direction of the two institutions and their departments Notre Dame emphasizes professional and graduate preparation, the report says, while SMC falls under the ambiguous category of a "humanizing" institution is sufficient to seriously hamper merger processes. " ... there are forces and factors ... suggesting caution in establishing closer relationships between the two institutions ," the report says. "First among these is the possibility that the differing emphasis of an undergraduate college· and a U1iversity stressing professional work might be incompatible -incompatible with respect to staffing, course offerings, and· financing, and even overall intellectual style." But the report contradicts itself three pages later when it says that the two institutions would be "in competition" with each other if they decided to become coeducational. Surely two institutions with approaches to education so radically different from each other that departmental merger would be impossible would not be in competition for the same kind of student. Indeed, the report leaves the impression that the only two things the two institutions have in common is South Bend and Catholicism, neither particularly potent selling points for the prospective students for which they would be "in competition."As time goes by, it becomes increasingly apparent that only SMC's complete absorption by Notre Dame or independent coeducation on du lac's part will solve the single-sex stigma which discourages interested prospects, stulifies social life, and generally makes things sad on both campuses. The report discusses both possibilities. The former, which would involve buying or leasing the buildings and land upon which SMC is presently situated from the Sisters of the Holy Cross and using the physical plant as a center for preprofessional studies or business and engineering, was condemned as "repugnant to the faculty and administration of St. Mary's College and would very likely be rejected by the Board of Trustees and by the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross." Further up in the page, lwwever, the report delineated what would happen if Notre Dame became coeducational: drop in the quantity of applicants to SMC and a subsequent drop in either enrollment or average quality of student. Faced with such an alternative, faculty, administrators, trustees and Sisters of the Holy Cross might find absorption considerably more palatable. The Park-Mayhew report then suggested that St. Mary's be made a college within the University of Notre Dame; and continue to offer "a viable and reasonably comprehensive undergraduate program designed primarily for women." In other words, the two institutions, except for some administrative functions, food services, and -my God! security -would remain effectively separate. The "solution" of course misses entirely the problem which first motivated the report --the fact that single-sex institutions are no longer acceptable to the vast majority of graduating high school seniors, even as glorious a single-sex instit~tion as Notre D~me. Instead, the report is a political balancing act contnved to keep a maximum number of Administrators at their ease. 
The next move is the Notre Dame administration's. If it rejects the Park-Mayhew report and moves boldly toward coeducation it would have aff_irmed a b~md of good. faith and cooperation with the stude~t body. But if it 
qmetly acquiesces-and tt has been quiet so far-well... 
...the report says that "the fuJI significance of these changes (coeducation in se~eral. ?th~r colleges) has been made stridently apparent to colleges and umversttJes m the decade of the sixties through the influence of student opinion and the emergence of student power." If it appears in the upcoming weeks as though du lac w~ll follow the .recommendations of the Park Mayhew report, The Observer suggests the influence of student opinion be made stridently apparent to the administration.

Student Govt. Expose! 
Dramatic evidence has finally been discovered for what has long been rumored among knowledgable University figures. Elements of Student government have been proven to be subservient instruments of the American Military-Industrial Complex and the International Male Chauvinist Conspiracy. 
The evidence was discovered on the back cover of the I 970-7 I Notre Dame-St. Mary's Student Directory. The lower half of the page consists of an advertisement whose message is FLY NAVY! and the slogan of which is "It take a Man to meet the Challenge!" 
This blatant right-wing, male chauvinist propaganda might have been passed off as an inadvertant participation of student government in the Corrupt Economic System of America (i.e., they pay, so they get the ad space), if it weren't for the message in the upper right hand corner of the page. It says, "SUPPORT THE ADVERTISERS WHO SUPPORT YOUR DIRECTORY"! 
Student government has asked the student body to support the Navy! This implies tacit consent of the student government to all Navy activities, which includes bombing missions in Vietnam originating from offshore Navy ships --missions responsible for the murder of countless men, women, and children (especially women ­the Navy hates women, as the ad makes clear). 
A newly-formed Women's Lib organization --Women to End Navy Chauvinism (WENCH) -· announced that it would take immediate action against student government by voting en masse (all four of them) against it. When informed that SMC students do not yet . vote" in NO elections, the spokesman, or, er, spokeswoman, replied Aha, More Male Chauvinism! We'll burn our bras or something. That'll show 'em". As indeed, one supposes, it will. . L~ck~ys ffor s_tudent government attempted to deny the Jmphcahons that 1t supports the Navy or male chauvinism but a quick-witted Scholastic writer pointed out "Student gove;nment people have opposed ROTC on the grounds that it implicates the University in the Military-Industrial Complex, as indeed it does ­doesn't their own reasoning equally implicate them in THIS situation?!" (Impeccable reasoning.) 
The word in ·government circles now is that Student Services Commissioner Rob Browning is going to be made the scapegoat for t~e whole messy affair, since his commission is responsible for the directory. But those in the know are deeply worried and concerned that the real subversive elements are located higher up in student government echelons.

BERLIN -West Berlin stands alone in the world. Hundreds of miles within the confines of the German Democratic Republic, West Berlin is acutely attuned to the social and political developments of the West. In an age when all American military determinations are questioned; in an age when serious proposals to with­draw all American troops from Europe, including Berlin, have been formulated; in such an age, the citizens of West Berlin feel like the inhabitants of an island in the Mississippi River at flood-time: they ask how high the waters will go. 
I entered Berlin by train in the early hours of the morning. At the border of East Germany and West Berlin men walk about with submachine guns, while others man guard-towers with searchlights, and still others patrol the border's fences with dogs. All of these men, according to the official Communist line, are keeping a strict watch for · aggression from the forces of imperialistic powers that are represented in West Berlin. Crossing the border, I saw trenches from another war, a war other than the Cold War. Zig­zagging like a serpent over the surface of the forest that surrounds the city at this 
point, these trenches reminded me of the histories I had read concerning this city's fate in the last days of Hitler's Germany, how every conceivable project had been put forward in an effort to organize a defense against the invading soldiers from the east. These, then, were, literally, the ''last ditches." 
In West Berlin itself stands another reminder of the Second World War, a memorial left by intention, the Kaiser Wilhelm church. This token of the past stands at the hub of West Berlin's com­mercial district, at the point where the city's three main avenues converge, one upon another. No man can view this church without contrasting its condition with the modern, bustling city that sur­rounds it. No man, having seen this contrast, can help but understand a por­tion of the tragic and inhuman conse­quences of war. It is a scene such as this, which provokes sharp awakenings of human consciousnesness and conscience, that caused George Santayana to write: "To find joy in another's trouble is, as man is constituted, not unnatural, though it is wicked ... These are the chaotic depths of that dreaming nature out of which humanity has to grow." 
The Kurfurstandamm is West Berlin's main street, and it reminded me a great 

deal of the bustling thoroughfares which roll across the island of Manhattan. As appealing, as exciting as the Kudamm is, one cannot visit West Berlin without travelling along another street, a street called "The Seventeenth of June" in memory of East Berlin's I 95 3 uprising. The street of the Seventeenth of June leads from the throbbing focus of West Berlin along to the Victory Monument, a memorial or"'the victories that belonged to the seemingly invincible German Army during the last half of the Nineteenth Century. But the Street of the Seven­teenth of June does not stop for the Victory Monument; it sweeps around, on up to the Brandenburg Gate. It stops short of its goal, however; the dam that is the Wall of Berlin was charged ten years ago with that vital responsibility by the men who built it. Almost a hundred yards from the wall, on its western side, stands a monument to the Soviet Army, sur­rounded by barbed wire. Two soldiers from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, armed with submachine guns, stand guard upon the highest steps of the memorial. Another fifty yards from here, British soldiers play cards in a mobile command post. 
Assured by these men in Her Majesty's Not-So-Secret Service of the right direc­tion to Checkpoint Charlie, I set off to cross the Wall. I soon found out, how­ever, that this "island" that is West Berlin is small only in relation to the vast expanses of land that surround it; I had 
to take the subway part of the way. At the border, one must change a portion of his money into East German marks, the western currency being closer to real value than that of the German Democra­tic Republic. (This process is, by the way, illegal under all the tenets of law existing among nations.) The first thing striking a visitor to East Berlin is the comparative lack of traffic, and the style of those cars that do travel the streets: they appear almost as though they were bought at one of MGM's auctions, when they sold off the props used in some 1940 movie. The second thing that is striking in East Berlin is the profusion of patriotic banners and flags. Every public building has a banner, and virtually every building sports a flag. (The banner on the City Hall read: "A Look to the Year 2,000: Our Efforts Will Be Rewarded!") Finally, and most important of all, the people themselves come as a slight surprise. Anyone, anyone other than a Joseph McCarthy perhaps, will almost certainly find the East Germans to be friendly and helpful and cooperative: I have met no friendlier people in the last five months of 
travelling. 
It has been said that travel informs, and I would guess that this is so. Govern­ments may fall from power,whole nations may wither and sink into oblivion, but people remain essentially the same. "A man's a man for a' that", said Robert Burns, and what was true in the 18th Century is just as true for the 20th. In times like these. that is good to know. 
Has the world already ended? 
Howard A. Eliar, uf Anderson, a school teacher at Dalesville, a former principal at Boone Grove and of the junior high in Arcadia, is author of a new book "Jesus, Father of Jehovah," setting forth some startling theories including the claim that the world has already ended and that the persons of God are residing within a 66 mile radius of New Castle. 
Although the book refrains from listing names of the Persons of God, the author says they have been well-circulated on a world wide basis, are irrefutably well-founded and that they and their titles will be publicly proclaimed in due time. 
Area within diameter of the 66 mile include all or parts of Jay, Blackford, Grant, Madison, Delaware, Randolph, Hamilton, Marion, Hancock, Wayne, Shel­by, Rush, Fayette, and Union counties in Indiana, and parts of Darke and Preble counties in Ohio. 
He refers to the area as "Mount Zion"the state of Indiana as "Greater Mount Zion;'. The book avers that the world has already ended and that the "former Earth" is the heaven of the Entire Universe. It maintains that establi­shment of the Kindgdom of God in Heaven (on Earth) will come in due time and that most of the Deities have lived 
most of their materialized lives within the east central Indiana area, overlapping into a small enclave within southwest Ohio. 
Eliar says in his new book that Chica­go is the biblical New Jerusalem and will be the capital city of Heaven, making Chicago one cpncept of the modern holy city of the Lord, along with New Castle, and that the permament throne of God will be located in Chicago. According to Eilar there is now a temporary throne and the keys to heaven and hell are located near it in displayable form. 


The author maintains in the book that the full Godhead established in the Bible has materialized and that the "coming" isn't limited to Christ, but also those persons known as the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit and Comforters are also "alive and breathing today, walking and talking with the people." 
The author, a native of Hagerstown 
and graduate of New Castle High School, 
has A.B.. and M.A. degrees from Ball State 
University, was a chemist and project engineer a number of years ago at Alu­minum Company. of America in Rich­mond and at the former Perfect Circle Corp. in Hagerstown, and has held teach­ing posts in several central and southern I.ndiana counties. 
He was founder of Eilar Theocratic Enterprises, Anderson. In the book he states that he maintains complete neu­trality with established sects, denomina­tions and religions, and supports none. 
Aborted babies live momentarily 
(National Catholic Register Special) 
The baby struggled for breath, his heart beating wildly in the battle for life, the arms flailing, the fists cle~ched. There was a tiny cry. 
And then he died. 
For that was the whole idea, he was supposed to die. He was another victim of the abortionists, to be tossed away in a can and incinerated with the rest of the accumulation of trash for the day. 
This is the horrible fact revealed in an article by Chicago Tribune science editor Ronald Kotulak. 
But if many infants that are aborted breathe wildly for a few breaths, strug­gling to live, Mr. Kotulak reveals an even more horrible fact -at least 26 babies have been aborted fully alive in New York City since the abortion law was liberalized only a few months ago. 
One of these 26 had such determin­ation and will that the child resisted death, still lives and now more than four 
who view it close up are saddened by it. Dr. Jean Pakter, director of the mater­ninty and new born services for the New York City Department of Health-which campaigned for the liberalized abortion law-said, "I am deeply saddened by this. In many of these cases where the fetus 
comes out alive, it takes a gasp or two and that's it. This is not right. As a physician I don't like to see life ended or hurt in any way." 
In New York, Cardinal Terrence Cooke .denounced the situation, "Once this law 
was passed the abortionists lost no time

they grow wealthier from the killing of

1cers are half way to goal
Irish  
by Jim Donaldson Observer Sportswriter 
At the beginning of the 1970-71 hockey season Irish coach Lefty Smith felt that the year would be considered a suc­cess if his young club could win half of the games on their diffi­cult schedule. At present, the Irish icers are halfway to Smith'& goal of a .500 season, boasting a 7-7-1 record at the midway point in the year. 
Notre Dame, playing only its third year of varsity hockey with a club composed predominately of sophomores and freshmen, was expected to have problems winning its share · of ·games against more experienced clubs but Coach Smith's charges have held their own. The Irish had a 
I-3 record when most of the 
student body left forA victory 
and a tie in a pair of games 
against the Wisconsin Badgers at 
the ACC on December 19 and 
20 sent the Irish skaters home 
for Christmas with a 2-3-1 slate. 
The club returned to South 
Bend immediately after the holi­
day and commenced a lengthy 
road trip that saw them win two 
of three games against Eastern 
hockey teams and split six deci­sions against Western clubs. 
Against Wisconsin, the Irish scored three goals in 74 seconds in the first period to overcome a 2-l deficit and grab a 4-2 lead. Eddie Bumbacco netted two goals and Paul Regan one in the scoring flurry. Bumbacco's' second goal came just 14 seconds after his first tally. 
Joe Bonk had put the Irish ahead 1-0 in the first minute of play but the· Badgers stormed back to grab a 2-1 lead before Notre Dame's three goal blitz put them on top for good. 
Regan and Ian Williams notched third period tallies as the Irish bested the Badgers 6-5. 
Although Notre Dame out­shot Wisconsin 53-36 the follow­ing night the Irish had to settle for a 3-3 deadlock. The Badgers scored a first period goal and nursed their 1-0 advantage into 
the third period before Kevin Hoene knotted the score with 
4:37 gone in the last stanza. Paul Regan gave the Irish their only lead of the night when he beat Badger goaltender John Anderson in the seventh minute of play. 
Wisconsin went back out front 3-2 but Bill Green tied the

Eddie Bumbacco sped down the left wing, a step ahead of the Boston College defenseman, took a perfect pass from John Roselli and fired the puck past the Eagle netminder. The clock in the McHugh Forum showed just 1:21 gone in the first period. 
After the ensuing faceoff, the Eagles roared down the ice and gunned a hard shot at Mark Kronholm, a freshman making his first start in the nets for the Irish while first string goalie Dick Tomasoni was rested. Kronholm turned it aside, the first of 37 saves he was to make as the Irish downed B.C., 5-3. 
Notre Dame combined the talents of newcomers and veterans ,as they have been doing all season, for the victory. Co-captain Phil Witliff, a veteran of the days when the Irish were playing club hockey, broke a 2-2 tie with a shorthanded goal and a freshman, Steve Curry, scored what proved to be the game-winning goal on a wicked slap shot from the right point. 
Just two years ago teams such as Gustavus Adolphus, St. Mary's of Minnesota, St. Thomas and Lake Forest appeared on the Irish schedule. Notre Dame did play Wisconsin of the WCHA but they were beaten by scores of 10-2 (on two occasions) and 12-0. 
In this, their third year of varsity hockey, the Irish play a 29-game slate, listing 20 games against members of the WCHA conference, the top college hockey league in America. And this season the Irish have beaten Wisconsin 6-5 and tied the Badgers 3-3. 
In just three years the Irish have come a long way. Their first two seasons they built up a 37-16-4 record but the competition wasn't top rate. Notre Dame is playing the best now. The w.on-lost mark is 7-7--1 but when one considers the speed with which the hockey 
program has progressed and the fact that I 4 of the top 21  players  
are  freshmen  and  sophomores,  that  .500  figure  is  an  
accomplishment.  

The man who has done the most to bring the Irish from obscurity into the national hockey picture is coach Charles "Lefty"Smith. He has brought some outstanding hockey players to the campus of d-u Lac and has worked hard to produce a team that will be as feared in hockey circles as the Irish grid and hoop squads are in their respective sports. The icers haven't reached this level yet but they're on their way. 
Paul Regan, a sophomore, Ian Williams, a freshman, and John Noble, a sophomore, are leading the team in goals scored, with 8. Witliff, a senior, Bill Green, a sophomore, and Eddie Bumbacco, a freshman, all have 6 goals. Green and Bumbacco's figures look more impressive when you consider that Green is a defenseman and Bumbacco has missed the last six Irish games while recovering from mononucleoiss. 
Goal tender Dick Tomasoni, who Denver coach Murray Armstrong says is "the equal of any goalie I've seen this season" is just a junior. Four of the top five Irish defenseman are freshman. 
The entire team is young. They're inexperienced and they make mistakes. They lack real speed and don't have exceptional finesse. But they don't lack hustle. 
After his Denver club won two tough games from the Irish in Colorado last weekend, Armstrong said, "We had to play as well as we could this weekend. Notre Dame comes to play hockey. They're a good team now and they're going to be great in the near future." Murray Armstrong knows what he's talking about. 
score with a goal at the 16:29 mark. Both clubs went all out for the win in the remaining regulation time but were thwarted in their offensive ef­forts by some fine goaltending by Anderson and Notre Dame's Dick Tomasoni. Anderson and Tomasoni both starred in the ten minute overtime period too, each making some great saves under heavy pressure. 
The Irish traveled East after Christmas to participate in the Boston Arena Christmas Tourna­ment. In the opening round of the tourney, Notre Dame re ecorded a fairly easy 4-1 win over Northeastern. John Noble scored two goals and Bill Green and Paul Regan added tallies to lead the Irish attack while sophomore goalie Chris Cath­cart, making his first start of the season, turned in a solid job in the nets, stopping 33 Huskie shots. 
The Boston University Ter­riers, the nation's ~-l team, provided the opposition for the Irish in the tourney final. 
The Terriers were just too good for the Irish, although the 
N.D. sextet battled the Boston club on even terms after the first period. The Terriers jumped out 
to a 4-o lead in the initial twenty minutes of play and upped their advantage to 5-Q in the second period before Phil Witliff put Notre Dame on the scoreboard. Ric Schafer and John Noble also scored goals in the game but the Terriers matched those tallies and notched a 7-3 win. Noble was named to the All-
Tournament team for his fine play in the two games. The Irish pla~ed their third game in as many ·nights on Dec. 
30, taking on the Boston College Eagles in McHugh Forum. Five players scored goals for the Irish and freshman Mark Kronholm, making his first appearance in the Irish nets, stopped 37 Eagle shots as the Irish downed B.C. 5-3. Bumbacco, Kevin Hoene, Witliff, Steve Curry, and Regan scored for Notre Dame. 
The Irish had a few days off before heading West to play six games in nine days. 
Notre Dame got off to a good start on their western jaunt, handing the Air Force Academy a pair of defeats on Jan. 8 and 9. The Irish had to overcome a four goal deficit to notch their first win over the Falcons. After Hoene put Notre Dame ahead 1-0, the Irish played sluggishly and fell behind 4-1 as the Fal­con's star center, Bob Ross, ter­rorized the Irish defense and scored all four Academy goals. Witliff and Ian Williams put the Irish back in the game with second period goals and when Noble and Gary Little put the puck in the net at 5:19 and 5:53 of the third stanza, the Irish had win number five. 
Notre Dame was in control all 
the way the next night, besting 
the Falcons 4-2. 
Green, Little, Regan and Joe 
Bonk scored for the Irish while 
Kronholm was again sensational, 
holding the Falcons scoreless un-, 
til the last five minutes of the 
game. Ross spoiled the fresh­
man's shutout at IS :52 and the 
Falcons managed to add another 
tally in the final minute of play. 
Coach Smith returned his top 
goalie, Dick Tomasoni, to the 
nets against a tough Colorado 
College sextet but Tomasoni 
didn't get much support as the 
Irish played poorly and were thrashed, 6-l. Green recorded the only Notre Dame goal. 
The Irish looked like a dif­ferent club the following night, however. Scoring four goals in each of the first two periods, the Irish built up an 8-3 lead and held off a late Colorado surge to win 8-6. 
Jim Cordes, John Noble and Ian Williams each netted a pair of goals while Gary Little and Steve Curry chipped in single markers as the Irish turned in their top offensive effort of the season. 
Denver University brought the Irish's journey to an unhappy end by handing the N.D. club a pair of defeats, 6-3 and 4-2, last weekend. 
Poor coverage in front of the 
goal and too many penalties hurt 
the Irish in the first game of the 
set. After a scoreless first period, 
Denver moved out to a 4-1 lead 
in the second stanza and pretty 
much decided the issue. Cordes 
Green and Williams scored fo; 
the Irish. 
Notre Dame played good 
hockey the next night against 
the Pioneers but not quite good 
enough to win. Denver grabbed a 
2-1 first period lead but the Irish 
tied the score at 2-2 on John 
Noble's second period goal. Den­
ver regained the lead later in the 
second stanza and added an in­
surance goal in the final twenty 
minutes. The Irish outshot the 
Pioneers 15-7 in the last period 
but just couldn't slip the puck 
into the net. 
The Irish return to the Convo 
this weekend, hosting the Uni­
versity of North Dakota Friday 
and Saturday nights. 

Gustafson sparks Irish 
The Notre Dame wrestling team evened its seasonal team record at 2-2 with a convincing 31-11 victory over down state rival DePauw University at Greencastle, Indiana. The match took place on Tuesday. 
Phil Gustafson took his third pin in as many matches this season in leading his Irish mates to the big win. Gustafson pinned his opponent, Doug Wood, at 
1:03 in the heavyweight divi­sion. Gustafson is undefeated in 20 matches over his three year career and he is threatening to break all existing records at ND for career wins and winning per­centage. He is the only junior so he has quite a chance to cope the the all time career victory mark. 
Besides Gustafson's pin the Irish were aided by two DePauw forfeits. Notre Dame's 118 pounder Chris Paige and captain Tom Ciaccio, 126 lb., were cre­dited with victories. 
Other victors for Notre Dame were Steve Moylan, who pinned his opponent Dave Isler in the 134 class at 2:37, and Ken Ryan, another winner by a pin in the l SO class over Dan Bru­nette. 
Rick Esposto won by means of a 12-0 decision over Bruce Hamilton of DU. Esposto com­peted in the 142ib. class. Bob Bennett beat Brian Burnie 5-Q to mark the only other NO win. Bennett wrestled !58.

lust for the record 
by Mike Pavlin In case you may have forgotten, Notre Dame won the Cotton Bowl and in the process added seventeen individual career marks to the Record Book. Eleven of those belong to Joe Theismann who now has thrown more passes, made more completions, for more yardage, for more touchdowns and at a higher percentage of completions than anyone else. Also on the career lists, Denny Allan is seventh in kickoff returns; Scott Hempel ranks fourth in scoring; Tom Gatewood stands right behind Jim Seymour in the receiving department; Clarence Ellis (tied for fourth) and Ralph Stepaniak (tied for seventh) rank in the interception files; and Jim Yoder is now third all-time punter. Yoder's 74 yard kick in the Cotton Bowl was the third longest in ND history, tying one of similar distance by Ed DeGree in 1922.

Notre Dame Accounts TVelcome 
by Lucia Zaucha 
After reading the Park­Mayhew study on the relation­ship between St. Mary's and Notre Dame, many St. Mary's facult'y members are of the opinion that the report contains too many ambiguities and flaws to constitute a significant contri­bution to the subject of co­education. 
The report did suggest a num­ber of possible changes. Among those cited as "significant" by Dr. Poinsatte of the St. Mary's History Department were the proposals for the establishment of a joint board of trustees, the merger of the admissions' offices and the union of the registrars' offices. "But," he warns, "there are many ambiguities that have to be cleaned up." 
Some faculty members feel the text becomes so ambiguous at times that it lapses into self­contradictory arguments. One of these is Dr. Bambenek of the Chemistry Department who feels that the section urging the de­velopment of "a combined Biol­ogy Department which would offer some things in common but which would also offer dis­tinctly different biological science programs on the two campuses..." is an example of such a self-contradictory pas­sage. In commenting on this statement, Dr. Bambenek points out: "If there is a combined Biology Department I don't think you're going to find two separate programs." 
Another passage in the text which has been given consider­able attention by faculty mem­bers is the section dealing with what would be the teachers' own 
nghts if the suggested merger would take place. Asked if the merger would pose a threat to members of the St. Mary's facul­ty, Dr. Richard Bohan refers to the report itself, which states: " .. .faculty members who con­centrate their efforts as under­graduate teachers should not be expected to compare for tenure of salary purpose with professors who conduct research and direct graduate students as well as teaching undergraduates." And Dr. Bohan concludes, "Of course that's a threat." 
This "threat" is seen by facul­ty members· as endangering not only their jobs, but the quality of education available to the St. Mary's student. Frequently men­tioned is the fact that Notre Dame uses much of the money it receives from ·its undergraduate program to finance its graduate school. On the other hand, St. Mary's has always been con­cerned with the undergrads. Dr. Barmenek states: "We have peo­ple here who specialize in teaching undergraduates. I think the merger would give rise to an institution in which something 
Fellowships available 
The Notre Dame Institute for Urban Studies announced today that a number of fellowships are available for the year 1971-72 in the field of urban research and planning. These fellowships are sponsored by both federal and local governmental agencies and in general require that a detailed application for the fellowship be submitted by January 31, 1971.

would be lost. I think it would be the students who lose." 
The only way such a loss might be averted, some faculty members suggest, would be if additional changes were to take place both at St. Mary's and Notre Dame. Comrrenting on the report, Father James Runde says: "I think the sad thing in the concept of merger is that I 
don't  see  any  suggested  re­ 
structuring  of  Notre  Dame."  
Among  the  reforms  he  sees  as  

desirable are broad curriculum changes and the inauguration of an all-college major. Mr. Bohan agrees with Father Runde that restructuring is necessary and concludes: "In view of all the problems Notre Dame has, I don't think it would do St. Mary's much good to merge." 
Many other criticisms have been leveled at the report. One of these concerns the "postpone­ment of consideration of social issues" that is mentioned by Mr. Harold Isbell of the Writing De­partment. Another is related to the commonly-held belief that adoption of the Park-Mayhew proposal will mean that "one of the Vice-Presidents of Notre Dame would be the President of St. Mary's."

Additional graduate research fellowships are available with the National Institute of Law En­forcement and Criminal Justice. Any student is eli!!ible who is 
working toward a graduate de­gree in any discipline related to problems of criminal justice. Each graduate research fellow­ship will cover the student's tui­tion and fees, plus a $2,600 stipend. Arplications and de­tails concerning these fellowships may be obtained from the Institute for Urban Studies, 214 Rockne Memoriai Building, 283 -1112.
