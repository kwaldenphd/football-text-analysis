dents, season tickets were split into  
two eight game packages. This system will allow 800 Notre Dame freshmer and 400 Saint Mary's students a chance to see at least eight games. Busick stresses ''we were able to take care of everyone who applied during the summer." Even the 1284 freshmen requests for tickets were satisfied through split ticket packages because the upperclass­men applications did not exhaust their 4,400 allocation. Although freshman wiJl only get to see half the home basketball games, Busick said "there is only one year you are going to have to suffer .'' Last spring, Busick and Joseph O'Brien, assistant director and business manager of Athletics, met with respective student body leaders to formulate a plan of distribution that would be as fair as possible. Busick said the plan of distribu­tion for basketball tickets was designed with the goal of accomo­dating the greatest number of students possible. Upperclassmen, Law and graduate students were allocated 4,400 tickets. 400 tickets were set aside for freshmen.

Thorson, Republican candidate for U.S. Congress addressed about twenty-five Notre Dame students last night in La Fortune. The remarks were made as part of Thorson's campaign for the Indiana 3rd District Con­gressional seat, which includes Notre Dame-Saint Mary's. • Thorson said ''This race is particularly important as it gives the voters a real opportunity to demonstrate their discontent with welfare-state philosophy my opponent represents.'' Thorson, a political science pro­fessor, gave a historical outline of the causes ''of our current economic woes. The theory of spend, spend, spend has definite historical roots going back to the pre-depression days," Thorson said. "We must now, however, realize the limits of this theory and allow the entrepreneurial forces in the country to bring us back to economic well-being.''  specific interst to the Notre Dame­Saint Mary's community," Thor­son said "I would have voted for tuition tax credits. Mr. Brademus did not. I think there is a need for supporting and maintaing in­dependent universities like Notre Dame and tax credits help do that." "Brademus also voted for federal funding of abortions, some­thing I would not have done," Thorson said. Thorson, who is 43, is a professor of political science at Indiana University at South Bend. He  received his PhD. from Princeton University in 1960 and did graduate work both at Princeton and Indiana University at Bloomington. During the past 17 years, Thor­son has served on the faculties of the University of Wisconsin at Madison the University of Califor­nia at Berkeley, the University of the Phillipines, Northwestern Uni­versity, and the University of Toronto. · In 1963, Thorson received the Kiekhofer Award for distinguished teaching at the University of Wis­consin and a Guggenheim fellow­ ship to Oxford University in Eng­land. In the spring of 1975, he was Fulbright professor of American civilization at the University of Grondheim in Norway. The Logic of Democracy, which Thorson wrote in 1962, was called by Notre Dame's Review of Poll­tics as "a very good book. In fact, it may be the book Walter Lippman has been looking for to re-establish a reasoned philosophy of demo­-cracy.'' Along with this boo, Thorson has written three others on the subject of political science.

Competing with televised base­ball playoffs and upcoming exams, newly -appointed Vice President of Student Affairs, Fr. John Van Woevlear fielded questions from an audience of approximately 20 stu­-dents last night in the gameroom at St. Edwards Hall. 
It was the first time he has addressed a campus residence hall since succee'ding Bro. Just Pac­zensy, who left the university last year. 
In response to a question about the recent alcohol directive issued by Dean of Students-James Roemer, Van Woevlear pointed out that, while not yet at the crisis level, drinking is "a serious prob-tern facing the entire community." He revealed that the initiative for the directive came from a group of students who approached a student affairs advisory board. 
"It was the students who brought the issue to our attention," he said. ''They were looking for a way to get their message across to the campus.'' 
lie .told the group about his exper1ences as rector of Cavanaugh Hall in 1955. He said that when students came in at night they were required io sign their name. Ifthey were intoxicated, their signature 
showed it.  
"Believe me,  they had  to  sign  
their  names  on  mighty  narrow  
lines.''  •  

Did these rules and restrictions help to curb the alcohol problem? "I'm sure they did," he empha­sized. 
"What we're trying to do is face the problem. Perhaps the directive issued was a little harsh. If we had to do it over again, we would probably handle the situation in a different manner." 
"I'd like to sav that Dean Roemer does a great job," he continued. "He saves the hides of many students. There are cases where he goes to bat for a student and prevents that student for ending up with a police record." 

Parietals was another issue raised at the informal meeting. Van Woevlear was quick to make the distinction between "parental control" and "parental concern." 
"Rules like parietals aren't de­signed to control anyone," he said. "Like your parents, we are cJn­cerned with your welfare. What we try to do is offer help and guidance where it's needed." 
He sid that in the case of parietals, the intent is not to impose restriction on a student that has vsitors of the opposite sex. 
"Parietals protect the privacy of a student in his hall. I would think that a student in his hall has the right, after a certain hour. to a certain amount of privacy;'' he said. 
"It's one of the rules that No :re Dame happens to have. When you enter the business world, you may work for a company that has certain employee rules you may not like. You'll find you have to live with those rules or find another place to work.'' 
"Van Woevlear said he thinks the· whole issue is ''blown way out of proportion." 
"Most of the hall rectors handle parietal violations within their own halls. I think the dean of students sees two or three cases a year." 
When asked whetner students should have input into policy making at Notre Dame, he re­sponded that while the students should be able to voice their opinions, there has to be someone in charge who can say, "This is the way it is going to be." 
"If we allow students to make the rules at Notre Dame then what do when partkular class

Senate signals extension of ERA 
WASHINGTON [AP]· The Senate signaled yesterday it will extend the ratification deadline for the Equal Rights Amendment and decided that states cannot use the additional time to take back their approval of the ERA. 
By a 54-44 margin, the Senate rejected a proposal by Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, to couple an additional 39-month ratification period with an opportunity for 
ratifying  states  to  rescind  their  
actions.  
The  vote  cleared  a  major  con­ 
gressional  obstacle  facing  ERA  

advocates while dealing a severe blow to its oooonents. Sen. Birch Bayh, D-Ind. principal Senate sponsor of the extension, predicted the Senate would approve the ERA extension by a healthy margin when the issue comes to a final vote set for tomorrow. 
Garn conceded that the vote was a major setback for those fighting addition to the U.S. Constitution of the ERA, which would specifically bar discrimination on the basis of sex. 
In August, the House passed a measure moving the ERA rati­fication deadline from March 1979 to June 1982. 
The measure aoes not require the signature of Presi~nt Carte~:, who has been a staunch supporter of the ERA. 
Sarah Weddington, special assistant to the president for women's issues, said Carter was "gratified" by the Senate's action.

Consider the Plunge 
Urban Plunge is a unique opportunity to augment textbook knowledge by personal­ly viewing urban problems and learning what is being done to correct them. Any ND-SMC stUdent Interested In social justice, government or just In humanity should consider taking the Urban Plunge. 
A two-day experience, Urban Plunge iakes place sometime between January 5-13. During his visit, the student will stay at a convent, rectory or community building within the city he chooses. He will see the poverty, injustice, and apathy which exists in American cities. He will also see steps being taken to solve these problems. For exampfe, while a student may spend a day at juvenile court, he will also visit a community center designed to keep juveniles out of trouble.: 
Notre Dame and Saint Mar:'( s students, for the most part, come from middle and upper class families. The problems they will see are problems they have only heard about: they' have never worried about such things as hot lunch programs, welfare, or growing old alone. And while they may have read about the cities, they have known neither the urban residents, nor the people who have chosen to help them. Without taking the Urban Plunge, one could continue to live in a world of narrow scope, a world where an expensive college education is taken for granted. 
Urban Plunge is not "slumming it;" it is 
On!y
entertainment 
Dear EdJtor: 
Even to a naturally complacent person like myself, the letters printed in Friday's Observer bor­dered on ridiculous. Specifically, I am referring to the opinions that 
· had to do with, as one of the authors put it, "the Saturday Afternoon Debacle" (i.e. the Mich-. igan game.). I shall not even take the time to address the very questionable assumptions that Mr. O'Connor uses to dismiss Michigan as an inferior team. Instead, I want to consider his suggestion that the ''fair weather Notre Dame alumni and students fail{ed) the team." Well, Joe, I don't know about you, but when I left the stadium last Saturday, I didn't feel like I had let anybody down. And I didn't feel any necessity to slink back to m my room and wait for the "rays emanating from the Golden Dome" to inspire me to construct a 
melodramatic lecture on school spirit. Furthermore, I rather wish I had been too drunk in the fourth quarter to know who was winning. Let's not forget what a football game is--it's an event for the entertainment ofthe spectator. No matter what kind of religious experience we try to make_out of it, it can never be more than enter­tainment. That's the reason people were willing to pay over fifty dollars to get in the stadium. 
I will readily admit that enthusi­asm is very important at a football game, but only inasmuch as it makes it more fun for the fans, since that enthusiasm helps pro­duce a favorable outcome. To say • however, that we have some kind of obligat;ion to be spirited is absurd. The football team is the entertainer (that's why the coaches get paid and the players get scholarships), and it has the responsibility for giving us a reason to be enthusias­tic. There's a duality in this relationship, and when one partner fails, the other must also. The auther of "The Former Number One" should realize that it's no coincidence that the former #1 student body was also cheering for the former #1 football team. 
As fox the statements "That beating Notre Dame is the epitome of college football'.' .and that nobody cares who Michigan pl~ys 
not a chance for students to play poor or exhibit their pity. Instead, it Is a learning experience, especially necessary for any­one interested in being a leader or anyone who claims to be educated. How can one fulfill the needs of people if he is unaware of them? How can a student In a classroom idealistically discuss solutions If they do not know the depth of a problem? Urban Plunge is an opportunity to see a part of America in an unusual way. 
Urban Plunge, need not be done purely out of the goodness of one's heart. When done properly--attending the two or three required meetings, and preparing two written assignments--Urban Plunge pro­vides a different way to gain academic credit. Although it is .only one credit, It may be the most challenging and most worthwhile credit earned during your college career. Also, taking the Urban Plunge enables a student to take a· special course during the spring semester. "The Unseen City," is geared toward students who have had experiences of Urban Plunge. 
For whatever reason--personal ex­perience, knowledge, or academic credit-­consider the Urban Plunge. It is a rare opportunity to increase one's knowledge of urban life and is well worth the two days during the Christmas season. If you have not yet considered Urban Plunge you should do so before the Friday deadline for applications passes.

A Precious Possession
For Judy and John Paul 
==============Christoplwr A. Stewart*==========.Mary Goodwin 
"No man is an Island, intire of it selfe; every man is a peece of the Continent, a part of the maine; if Clod bee washed away by the Sea, Europe is the !esse, as well as if a Promontorie were, as well as if a Mannor of the friends or of thine owne were; any mans death diminshes me, because I am involved in Mankinrle; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tons for thee." 
An uninvited guest appeared at du Lac this week, intruding upon the gaiety and frivolity accompany­ing our initial gridiron victory. This visitor seldom makes his presence known at so lovely a place as Notre Dame. If a person searches for him, it would appear that he is forbidden on the premies since he is so little seen, experienced, or talked about. However, his wrath was manifest in full fury, claiming not only a pope but the life of a young girl. By now, you guess the identity of our guest. It is the reaper, death. 
What exactly is death, and why is the shock and bafflement that results from its intrusion so pro­foundly upsetting to our lives? There are several reasons. Death is the greatest dread of all. It hurls itself upon the human race with diabolical indiscriminateness. It seems to have no justifiable reason for those whom it chooses. It · nocks all our standards of eti­quette; it spits on. our feeble attempt to create security and certainty in a world full of chaos, paradox and fear. We all sense death is the end, yet no one is ever fully able to comprehend their own unique death. We delude our­selves into believing the other guy will get it between the eyes; or someone else's parents will con­tract cancer or schirosis ofthe liver. 
Dee!' down, the psyche refuses to acknowledge that it, too, must one day die. This means that no r.tatter how beautiful you are, how well endowed you are physically, you will ultimately become caviar for Lhe maggot. No one enjoys thinking this way; it does not relieve the anxiety or the dread that man's fate is to die. Even more than taxes (which can be avoided with the necessary skill) the only certainty in this life is death. 
What then is a man to do about this demon of death? How is it possible to confront a force which has no respect for those values and ideals that men cherish above everything? Death mocks our conventions, reviles our symbols of immortality and condemns us to a consciousness which oppresses us by the continual knowledge of the finiteness of existence. Death defecates on power, wealth, status, beauty, youth, intelligence, and accomlishment. The more worldly a man or woman is, particularly of a hedonistic or nihilistic nature, the more deeply terrorized is that person of their ultimate fate: confrontation with the void. At least religions attempt to dispel man's inordinate preoccupation with death by offering him a life hereafter. Otherwise, if there was no hope, the debauchery and 
lunacy of the world would know no bounds. Sodom and Gomorrah would be instantly resurrected if the afterlife promises of Christian faith were ever discredited. But the terror of death would remain. 
Why did the pope's death shock me so? And why should I even care 
that  a  St.  Mary's  senior  was  
annihilated in  a  VW  last  Friday  
night?  Because they  are  human;  

they have met the fate I one day will meet as well. One of the strangest feelings I had when my own father died two years ago was envy; now he KNEW, knew what I longed to know. Is there a beyond, which will bring us to an under­standing of this valley of tears, this monstrous cave of shadows? Why should I be so concerned with these two deaths, as opposed to the endless stream* of horror stories so stunningly portrayed on TV or in the newspapers? Why does the violent end of an English major, 21 years old, who would have graduated next spmg, or the titular head of Catholicism's 700 million Catholics, resonate a different chord within my soul? After all, the recent disasters in California (air crash), Iran (earthquake), Nicaragua (civil war) or Cambodia (genocide of the Pol Pot regime) all involve the lives of thousands, even millions of people. The difference is that these two deaths involve my life in a very personal and signifi­cant way. 
As a Roman Catholic, the pope is my leader, the mundane heir to the throne of Christ. The appalling incongruity in his death is that it came at the acme of his life. He served his God and church humbly and faithfully for many years. Out of the abyss of obscurity he ascended to the most prominent religious position on earth. Ironi­cally, he served the people as pope for the same number of days that our Savior lived in years: 33. The brevity of his reign makes the vulnerability I feel in regard to my own mortality that much more pronounced. His loving kindness, his warmth and evanescent smile are no more; somehow it strikes me as bizarre that a man should so long toil, and then die at the pinnacle of his career. How fleeting life is. 
-And what of Judy? No doubt she was fully alive, jesting and joking with all the uninihibited joy of youth as she drove along with her comrades that evening. Although I knew her not ip the flesh, I know the beauty and ineffable quality of

life that must come from maturing into a young woman, leaving behind the fantastic reveries and fantasies of teenhood to assume her role in the adult world. (I have 
three sisters of like age, whose blossoming and beauty are mar­velous to behold.) I think of the anguish suffered by her parents of youthful life snuffed out; a flower crushed by the roaring of a police car into the rear of a toy automo­bile. The masterpieces she will never write; the inspiration she will never give to those oflike spirit and mind. These are my thoughts. What love and goodness she will never endow to this world, since she has been claimed for reasons we are forbidden to know. Her death saddens me, fills me with the tears of the inexplicability of life, and the rage that comes from knowing this too may happen to 
m~. 
these fallen comrades, I have 

:letermined to confront death on its own turf. I will write, and I will live with all the uninhibited vigor and ardor that one human being can muster. I will not resign myself to anything that will not bring to others, to God and to myself the joy, happiness and beauty that life has to offer. I will not be a lamb, cowering to the reaper who lurks in the darkness, lusting after life like the lecher for the harlot. No death, you bastard, I will proclaim your illegitimacy, and inform my fellow human beings that they are CALLED TO LIVE. 
The fullest potential of their lives may be realized not in fear, not in cowardice, not in alcohol and national championships, not in cr<tss materialism, not in death; instead, in love, in truth and in facing oneself, realizing that death awaits each and every one of us. The one thing worth betting on is that no one gets out of this world alive. Once that reality is con­fronted, we might all take life more seriously, and appreciate the mo­ments, the hours, the days, the people, our education, the love of friends and parents, the professors and religious at this university, and most of all, ourselves a whole lot more than we now do. Live fully, while you have life. 

The when death knocks, you'll be able to invite him in for a Schlitz or a Coors before you embark upon the journey we all must take. Then death--that absurdly intransigent cosmic joke--will not be feared, but conquered through love.

When I first learned of the death of SMC senior Judy Cerabona, I felt only the tragedy of the situation in general: the loss of a life so young and full of promise. I didn't think 1 knew the girl and so her death was not for me a personal 
Joss. However, when I came across the picture of Judy in the October 2nd 
Observer, I was dumbfounded. I knew this girl. I had worked with her at Logan Center. She was now 
an animated personality, someone with whom I had talked and laughed. The shock of her death became a gnawing reality and the grief her friends were feeling struck me also. 
When death takes the young, we are left with desperate questions. We question the untimeliness of the event; and the great irony that would allow those so young and innocent to be taken. We wonder how God, if such a being-exists, could permit such a senseless injustice to occur. , 
And yet, while we mourn the passing of a friend and fellow student, we mourn also for our­selves. Not only have we lost a peer, we have also lost any blind may have prevtously entertained. When death strikes so near, so close to home, we are forced to realize that our own deaths are inevitable. We can no longer stumble blindly and purposelessly through life. We, as Christians, come to the realization that that which we must prepare for. a life after death, is imminent. The 
preparation must begin now, with no further delay. We can't ignore our obligations any longer. 
I realize that it is small consolation to Judy's friends and family to say that good can come from such a crushing tragedy. But, as botH campuses mourn the death of a person whose warmth and friendli­ness touched all who knew her, the positive influence of Judy's life continues to affect us. 
Ideally, Judy's untimely death will bring about a sense of com­munity; a group solidarity as we become aware, albeit painfully, of the frailty of human life and the need for communal interdepend­ence. But, perhaps more realisti­cally, friends may become a Jittle dearer to us, petty differences a bit less consequential, and life a little less a burden than a precious

I've been framed! That Joseph O'Connor who wrote the arti.:le, 
"Michigan Superior?" sure wasn't this Joe. Though friends knew that 
that wasn't the real O.C. saying those absurd things about the Notre 
Dame student body, alumni.communicationmajors, physical education 
majors, and worshippers of the holy bottle, I must clear the O.C. 's name 
anyway. 
To the "other" Joseph O'Connor out there please use your middle 
initial next time you write to the editor (if you exist), I've had enough 
phone calls complaining about your article. 
Now to the article itself. Bunk! I don't think you were inspired, as you 
say, to prose emanating from the Golden Dome, rather I think you've read 
too many bathroom wall scriptures. You wondered how the Irish could so 
thoroughly "beat" a team and yet trail when the clock ran out. Drugs. 
Pure Drugs. You're head must have been somewhere else or you were at 
the wrong stadium. N.D. got stomped on and Michigan is one class team 
and school. And so are we. Was Michigan reaJiy a superior team? The 
score speaks for itself, Joseph. Perhaps we could womp on them later in 
the season but that particular Saturday we were just plain beaten by a 
better team. 
Joseph, you said the students possibly fai1ed the team. What? The 
team failed, we didn't. We didn't throw interceptions, fumble the ball, 
screw up plays, accumulate tons of yardage in foolish penalties, nor day 
dream about how good it was last year. 
We are mere mortal spectators, paying for entertainment, so far not much entertainment. Granted, we students weren't as Rah Rah as usual but the game isn't won in the stands, it is on the field with concentration, execution, and a little luck. If our team needs constant noise to win a game I suggest the Stones be hired to play during the game. What are our men going to do away from home? Lose because there isn't enough fans yelling for them? Apparently Michigan and Missouri do not have that attitude. They simply went out and did the job. Maybe our players should concentrate on what's going on on the field and not what's going on in the stands . 
I'm sick of reading about students anyway. If we don't jump and scream and behave irrationally maybe it is because we realize it is not a life and death matter. We are a new breed of N.D.student, a more mature fan, still interested in winning but who puts football in the proper perspective. I can tell you, Joseph, that for years now this same bull about students not yelling enough and too drunk to see the scoreboard has been handed out. We've got great students here and the alumni are the most funloving alumni in the world. So don't say students and alumni lost the game. And please stifle the drunkenness number. We at N.D. love to party. Yeah, we hate to lose and we love to win. But we realize the purpose of "games." It's to ENJOY yourself, to become immersed in total craziness, a time to act irrational and out-of-control, wearing crazy clothes and living up to the festival atmosphere by acting out-of-the-ordinary. There's the pregame parties, during the game parties, post-game parties. We drink in anticipation, we drink during the action, and we drink for victory and we drink to drown out a loss. Come on Joseph, hoist up your bottle and let her slide. · This past weekend N.D. sputtered past Purdue which could cure anyone's insomnia, but the fact still remains that all of us from Pangford had a good time. Besides, its the good times partying and socializing that we'll remember in years to come, not whether the Irish sparked or sputtered. Us Stillborners hate to lose and are demanding a more open offensive show, but we don't let a loss by a football team compel us into convulsions and think of ourselves as "losers"s because "we" lost a football game. ' 
Finally, just to end this thing, I quote from Joseph's article, "With rowdy fan support, sober and otherwise, the Irish just may demonstrate that they are the best team in the country. After all, this is not a team of physical edu~ati9n .and .cooununwatiotl majors.~·: I'~ ~11l' ~~s!·~r~~ds: :.. · ·~ .. ::

" ...lfl have seemed to love my subject, it is no surprising thing, for I loved the profession far better that any I have followed since, and I took a measureless pride in it. jl1te reason is plain: a pilot, in those days, was the only unfettered and entirely independent human being that lived in the earth. Kings are but the hampered servants of parliament and the people; parliaments sit in chains forged by their constituency; the editor of a news­paper... must work with one hand tied behind him by party and partons ... no clergyman ... may speak the whole trJ,Jth, regardless of his parish's opinions; writers of aU kinds are manacled servants of the public .. .ln truth, every man and woman and child has a master, and worries and. frets in servitude; but...the Mississippi pilot had none ... The moment that the boat was under way in the river, she was under the sole and unquestioned control of the pilot. He could do with her exactly as he pleased, run her when and whither he _chose, and tie her up ot the bank whenever his judgment said that the course was best. His movements were entirel,/ free; he consulted no one. he received commands from nobody, he promptly resented even the -merest sug­gestions. Indeed, the law of the United States forbade him to listen to commands or suggestions, rightly considering that the pilot necessarily knew better how to handle the boat than anyone could tell him. So here was the novelty of a king without a keeper, an absolute monarch who was absolute in sober truth and not by a fiction of words."

In the spirit of Mark Twain's· riverboat pilots, a group of Notre Dame students, staff, and faculty from the Law School and 
Air Force ROTC formed Notre Dame's flying club in January 1977. Led by its first president, Air Force Captain Gene Renuart, the club purchased a used Piper Cherokee 140 for its 20 members, and Renuart was the only instructor for the group. Today, 28 members, four of whom are instructors, comprise the Irish Flyers, Inc., and the club operates its Cessna 150 and its fully instrument equipped Piper Archer 180 from the Michiana Regional Airport in South Bend. 
The non-profit club provides opportunity for flight instruction at reasonable rates. The planes are often seen circling the Notre !Dame campus, and members some­times take cross country trips. Larry Soderquist, a Law professor, is the current president of the Irish Flyers. Membership has expanded to include many people outside of the University, and the club always welcomes new and inexperienced· people to join.

by Gregory Solman 
The problems of the local parish will be given a national perspective when church leaders from all over the country gather at the 1978 Catholic Committee on Urban Min­istry Conference (CCUM) Oct. 
22-25. 
"I'm going to do an awful lot of listening this year," said Dr. Helen Volkomener, S.P. executive direc­

tor of the CCUM. "There should be five to six hundred people showing up," Volkemener continued, "and none of them are passive listeners. Anything can happen." 
The theme chosen for this year's annual conference is "Neighbor­hood: Viewed Through National r Telescope and Local Microscope." It will be held at the Athletic and Convocation Center. The Con­ference will take two views of

headquarters at Notre Dame since 
1970. 
"Notre Dame became the head­

quarters when Msgr. Jack Egan 
moved from Chicago to here," 
commented Volkemener, "He was 
the director until two years ago." 
Egan is now the Director of 
Social and Pastorial Ministry, and 
Special Assistant to the President. 
"I think that having the head­
quarters here is a fine thing to have 
happening," commented 
Volkomener,"I thiqk we come up 
with some good ideas on what's 
happening in this area, and it is 
•

good for us to be able to tap the 
resources of Notre Dame for our 
conferences." 
This year, CCUM will again be 
joined by the Protestant Committee 
on Urban Ministry which will 
participate is some of the CCUM 
sessjions as well as sponsor work­
shops for its own members. 
Themes of past conferences have included "Justice in the Economic System'', featuring Dr. Richard Barnet of the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, and Father Brian Hehir, the Director of the office of International Justice and Peace. "Coalition Building" and ''Toward Empowerment'' were other recent conference topics. 
Last year, the conference studied labor movements, calls to action and' 'the neighborhood'' under the theme ''Fulfilling a Committ­ment." Featured speakers were Geno Baroni, the Assistant Sec­retary of HUD, Father John Coleman of the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkely and Joyce Miller, Vice President of Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union. 
SU hides 
Pitt Panther 
by Marcia Kovas Staff Reporter 

Can the clue ''An oft quoted line of 
Shakespeare comes to mind," help 
you guess where the Student Union 
hid the Pittsburgh Panther on 
campus? 
This week, Student Union is 
conducting a Hidden Panther Con­
test. Oues hinting at the location 
of this elusive panther will appear 
each day this week in the Observer. 
The panther could be hiding 
anywhere on the 1,250 acres of the 
campus of Notre Dame. The 
student who tracks him down with 
the correct guess will win a 
Homecoming package. 
The package, offered as first 
prize by the Student Union includes 
two tickets to the football game, 
two tickets for the Neil Young 
concert, a ticket admitting one 
couple to the Homecoming dance 
and a Homecoming mum. 
A Notre Dame student who 
wants to hunt for the panther 
should leave his name, phone 
number and a single guess at the 
panther's whereabouts in the Stu­
dent Union offices on the second 
floor of LaFortune. In order to 
qualify, a student must explain why 
he chose the location listed on his 
entry. 
The contest winner will be 
announced Oct. 11. 
Homecoming packages still available 

A limited number of Home­coming packages are still on sale in the Student Union Ticket Office each afternoon from noon to 4 p.m. Each package contains two G.A . Pitt tickeh, two lower arena Neil Young tickets, a ticket which will admit on• \.:ouple to the Home-c~mi9g t.•• ;.c~ and a Homecoming

Council to take surveys 
BY John McGrath The Student Government Presi­
Staff Reporter dent also pointed out that the council will be doing other surveys 
The Student Government Council of Communications, a major plank of Andy McKenna's election plat­form last year, is alive and well, according to the Student Govern­ment president. 
In response to questions about the status of the council, McKenna said that "it has been doing real well. It's function now is to administer surveys through the individual halls to keep us (student government) informed of student trends.'' 
The group was formed following McKenna's election to the student government post and is composed of one representative from each dorm, chosen by the hall president. 
There had been some controversy during the spring term over the purpose of the group. At that time Initiative 202, enacted by con­cerned students, had requested that the Student government Board of Commissioners meet to discuss among other things, the definition of the role of the body. There had been protests that the council was duplicating the role of the Hall Presidents' Council, (HPC). 
Andy Herring, Student Govern­ment Executive Cool:tinator, dist­inquished the role o~ {he Council of Communications from that of the HPC by stating, "It's worthwhile because it is a little more diver­sified than the HPC. It is really useful, but it is essentially a more i·nformal group.'' 
McKenna pointed out that the council had recently been involved in preliminary information-gather­ing work in preparation for last week's student forum. 
"In the first survey, we, in effect, in the near future. "We'll be doing another soon, probably before the October break, on two major sub­jects: student views on parietals and student drinking habits. We're also thinking about doing a general life survey, but at present time, we're not sure whether we will handle the questions individ­ually or as one general survey." 
Jim Seifert, Student Government Public Relations Director, as well as Chairman of the Council of Communications, echoed McKenna and Herring in his appraisal of the group, calling it "Andy's Gallup Poll." explained that the council compiles a quest­ionnaire for each survey and gives approximately ten to each rep­resentative. The questionnaires 
Skydiving classes begin today 
asked the students: If you could make a list of the top ten problems facing you what would they be? ", McKenna commented, adding that the results turned out to be very useful at the forum. 
Judicial Council 
to meet in BP 
There will be a meeting of the Judicial Council tonight at 6:30 
p.m. in the Breen-Phillips Puzzle Room, located in the basement of Breen-Phillips. 
The redefinition of parietals from a University to a hall offense will be discussed. 
Training classes for students interested in skydiving will begin Thursday at 6:15p.m. in room 117, Haggar Hall. This training period, lasting two to three hours, will complete most requirements nec­essary to make the first jump: The final training session, lasting ap­proximately one hour, will take place at Marshail Airport. Stu­dents completing these two train­ing periods will be qualified to make the first jumps upon arrange­ment with their instructors. Final training periods probably will be scheduled on Sundays. 
Registration and a fee of $35.00 will be required for Thursday's meeting. The $35.00 fee includes all instruction and the cost of the first jump. For further information contact Tom McKernan (1166).

World Hunger Coalition sponsors faster's mass 
by Paul Stauder 
The World Hunger Coalition is sponsoring a faster's mass in the Walsh Hall chapel each Wed­nesday, according to Charlie Brown, director of the activity. 
l 
-The purpose of the masses, according to Brown, is to "give a more religious aspect to the fast­
ing." The masses "establish a 
i sense of community among the fasters. It's a religious experience. 
The masses give us a chance to discuss the spiritual aspects of the 
fast," Brown added. 
The masses are celebrated each 
week by a different priest and 
begin at 5:15p.m. The masses are 
in conjunction with the popular 
practice of students giving up their 
Wednesday evening meals. 
Brown estimated that the first 
mass was attended by 20 to 30 
fasters, but added that "Non­
fasters are more than welcome to 
attend in the future." 
Terry Napier, a Notre Dame 
student who has pledged his 
Wednesday meals during October 
under the coalition's program 
added, "It's easy to go hungry one 
night a week when you know an 
unfortunate child won't have to because of you.'' 
A lot of companies will offer you an important sounding title. 
But how many offer you a really important job? 
In the Navy, you get one as soon as you earn your com­mission. A job with responsibility. A job that requires skill and leadership. A job that's more than just a job, because 
it's also an adventure. 
If that's the kind of job you're looking for, speak to your 
local recruiter.  -

Your  Navy  Officer  Representatives  will  be  on

Conflict continues in Lebanon 
BEIRUT*Lebanon [AP]··Syrian­
Christian violence has torn apart 
1this capital city, and some veterans of the Lebanese conflict say the fighting now is worse than any seen during the worst of the 1975-76 civil war. 
The conflict that has destroyed much of the Christian sector of East Beirut is now spilling over into the western entertainment ·and commercial center, an area that in better times earned Beirut the name "Paris of the Middle East." 
The Syrians, now the heart of an Arab League peace-keeping force stationed here, intervened in the civil war that pitted leftist Lebanese Moslems and · Palestinians against right.wing · Christians whom the Moslems thought had too much political control. 
The Syrian move saved the 
Christians, but they have now 
proved stubbornly resistant to 
Syrian attempts to control them. 
The Christian quarter has been without water and electricity for a week. Tuesday, the big guns constantJy hammering the city knocked out most of west Beirut's power, plunging it into darkness and cutting all communications with the outside world. 
The blackout proved a night­marish backdrop for the battle waged in the air--fiery tracer shells and whistling rockets from Syrian guns criss-crossed the night sky, landing with white bursts of fire in the eastern sector. 
The orange glow of a blaze at an oil depot, partially obscured by thic smoke, put the easte~n skyline in a ghostly silhouette. 
Radio reports from the Christian sectov, completely cut off by Syrian roadblocks and sniper fire from the Moslem quarter in the west, said corpses were rotting ia the streets, hospitals and homes, deprived of burial because of the danger. 
Red Cross workers say the threats of famine and death from thirst are bel·oming more serious by the hour as all routes of supply to the eastern sector have been severed. The right-wing militia 
· campaign to wrest two strategic 
bridges from the Syrians that lead 
into east Beirut and out of the city 
to the north could be -a push for an 
escape route. 
In West Beirut, leftist Lebanese 
militiamen who have stayed out of 
this fight--some say only because of 
considerable pressure from Syria-­
have thrown up roadblocks in 
neighborhoods they treat as their 
own private strongholds. Armed 
gunmen check identities of passing 
drivers and, in apparl.!nt frustration 
at being !eft out of the fight, shoot 
fussillades of machine gun fire into 
the night air. 
An occasional rocket-propelled 
grenade swishes toward the 
eastern sector from an apartment 
window, testimony to the old Beirut 
cliche that every building is an 
armory. 
Scores of restaurants and night­
clubs in West Beirut that reopened 
after the civil war in hopes of 
eventual recovery have shut their 
doors once again. 
Hans Maschek, an Austrian 
restaurateur who spen $290,000 
refurbishing his war-gutted estab­
lishment, put a "for sale" ad in the 
newspapers. 
"This is sheer madness. I've 
had it," Maschek said, adding he is 

willing to take almost any loss to 
sell and get his family out. · 

The embattled Christian quarter, which largely escaped damage during the civil war, has been dubbed "Stalingrad," a reference to the Russian city held hostage by German troops in World War II and almost depopulated at the end of the seige. 
Streets in the area are impass­able because of the chunks of concrete, shatter_ed glass and felled telephone poles. 
On a tour of the East during a lull early this week, correspondents were shown dozens of unexploded shells, some weighing 250 pounds. 
Officials in the eastern sector believe more than two-thirds of the 600,000 Christians here have fled to the mountains or the country. The remainder, mostly poorer residents, have stayed behind to support the mifitia or to protect their property from looting. 
"I think this is in some ways worse than the civil war," said a British diplomat who was here during the ''Lmonth conflict. "These big guns weren't operating then. It was mostly a light-arms war." . 
Experts say the heavy artillery, mortar and rol ket barrages--mostly from Syrian guns--are responsible for the high (;,viiian cllsualty toll. 
More than 700 Lebanese, an estimated 90 percent civilians, have been ki · in three extended battles sinct .ne current conflict broke out t February. The 1975-76 civl : took more than 37,000 lives, : of them comba­tants, as it 1 ged through most of the country. 
The currer fighting, which up to­this week · ..1S localized in the eastern sector of the capital, is now being carried to the northern mountains, the home of the Maronite Christians.who make up much of the right-wing militia troops. 
And veteran observers believe the Syrians may soon launch an offensive against Jounieh, the unofficial Christian capitall2 miles north of Beirut, the only remaining supply port for the militia.

The Freshman Year Office offers a Senior Interviewer Program ''so that freshmen are given the oppor­tunity to benefit from the discus­ions with informed and r.eliable upperclassmen--" stated Peter Grande, i'ssistanf dean of Freshman Year and Director of the Senior Interviewing Program. 
Begun in 1971 by Emil Hofman, dean of Freshman Year, the prog­ram consists of 36 seniors plus six advisors from the Freshman Year Office. 
"By and large, this year's sen­
. iors are informed they are aware of the specific services provided by Freshman Year, the activities ·.we sponsor, and the assistance offer­ed through the Learning R~source Center," Grande explained. 
"The seniors inform the fresh­men of life at Notre Dame--they share their experiences with fresh­men and communicate to them how they were able to make it through their first year at Notre Dame," Grande said. 
Grande stated, "One ofthe goals of our program is to assure that every freshman here is seen either by their advisor or their· senior 
interviewer.. before midterm.'' And before the end of the semester, each freshmen will have met with both their advisor and their senior interviewer, Grand said. 
Sr. Margaret Suerth, one of the six advisors who leads a team of six 
.. senior interviewers said, "In my own team, I have set the goal that each freshman assigned to my team (over 300) will see an inter­viewer before the end of the semester," said Margaret. Anne Cordesman, a senior Eng­lish major stated that the program is especially useful for the fresh-. men. "It is easier for students to talk to other students than to talk to adults," she said. Students all have similar prob­lems. And, the seniors have recently experienced the problems of the freshmen, whereas the adults have not," Corderman ex­
plained. 
"The interviewing also provides 
seniors to have a learning exper­
ience that is not classroom orien­
tated. It is beneficial to both 
seniors and freshmen--you are able 
to learn about yourself and others­
and how well you can relate and 
react to others,'' stated 
Cordesman. 
Tracie Paris, a freshman engine­.ering major stated, "My interview was very helpful. It's good that our interviewers are in our same col­lege and can talk to us intelligently about our majors." 
She added, "My interviewer encouraged me not to concentrate only on attending classes and studying all the time but to take time out and get involved in extra activities here at N.D." 
John Hem, a freshman philo­sophy major said, "I felt right at h!}Jlle with my interviewer--I could talk to her and tell her what I felt. My interviewer related some exp­eriences that assured me that she knew what I was going through as a freshman." 
"Senior Interviewing gives freshmen a good chance to talk to someone who has been around and 
1 
·· 
Dean Peter Grande 
who is on their ieve. Freshmen are able to ask me the questions which they don't know who else to ask. At least if I can't answer them, I can refer them to the person or 
group  who  can,'_'  stated  s.ue  
Schribner, a seruor  Economtcs  
major.  

Grande and Hofman make the final selections of the Senior Inter­viewers. Nominations come frotn the various coJJeges' Deans, De­partment Chairmen, and graduat­ing senior interviewers. Out of.the 85 nominations we had last spnng, it was extremely difficult not to select everybody,'' said Grande. 
In the 36 interviewers we did select, we felt we got the best distribution of seniors from all of the different academic back­grounds,'' Grande added. 
Grancte also stated that any freshman may request a meeting with his or her advisor or one of the senior interviewers at any time a meeting might be desired. 
Meetings will take place in the Freshman Year of Studies Office between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. For mor informa1ion call the Freshman Year Office at 7421.

Student directories to 
be distributed soon 
by Ruth Kolcun 
Permanent student directories will be distributed either a week before or a week after break, John Malcolm, a Student Union Services Commission member, anticipates. "Usually they are never out before the third week in October,". he added. 
"It is not the students' fault. The registrar just stopped asking for corrections on Friday. The registrar prefers that the phone books come out late and be correct rather than coming out early with inaccuracies," Malcolm explained. 
Malcolm said that students are responsible for compiling Saint Mary's calendar of events, Notre Dame Student Union, Student Government cabinet lists, class officers, Hall Presidents Council (HPC) members and student publi­cations. This information is then 

delivered  to  the  Administration  
Building.

Aerosmith posts bail for fans 
r 
group Aerosmith parted with $4,000 yesterday to get two dozen of its fans out of trouble with the law in this northern Indiana city. 
Fort Wayne police arrested 62 persons who attended the Aero­smith concert Tuesday night, most­ly on charges of possessing drugs and alcohol. During the perfor­mance, lead singer Steven Tyler stopped in the middle of a song to protest the police action and pro­mised to post bail for anyone arrested. 
"I hear the chief of police don't like rock and roll,'' Tyler shouted to the crowd. "Well that's all right because I don't like chief of policemans." 
After the concert, the band sent accountant Peter Mensch to the Allen County Jail, where he paid out about $500 to win the release of 13 persons still in the lockup. "We didn't want anybody to spend the night in jail,'' Mensch said. 
Before the court opened at 9 a.m. yesterday, Mensch was there wait­ing to pay almost $3,500 in fines for .. 25 persons who had peladed guilty to misdemeanor charges. 

Joni Goodman, an employee of Allen Superior Court, where the cases were handled, said, "some of them were in such a hurry to get out they didn't even thank him or anything ''He Mensch just kept peeling of $50 and $100 bills. "They were'$0 surprised when he paid their fiues. You should have seen their faces." 
Fort Wayne police have been making arrests at rock concerts for the past year, after Police Chief Kenneth Buckmaster attended a concert and complained about mar­ijuana and cigarette smoking and 
. drinkin~. 
The crackdown led several pro­moters to cancel Fort Wayne tours, and the Aerosmith performance was the first rock show at the county coliseum since July 17.

Mark Ronslni Sports Writer 
Finely tuned athletes, travel­ling from such distant places as Florida, Alabama, and Canada will gather on the Burke Memorial Golf Course tomorrow afternoon for what should prove to be one of the most interesting and competitive cross-country events of the new season, the Notre Dame Invitat­ional. 
This year's invitational is divided into four separate divisions: the Blue division (5 miles), the Gold division (5 miles), the Open divis­ion (5 miles), and the High School division (2.5 miles,). Action will takes place every hour, beginning with the Blue division at 2 p.m.

' 
snapped an 0-2 start by defeating Purdue 10-6: "We won 10 in a row and then lost two in a row. Believe me, 10 in a row is better." 
Purdue Coach Jim Young: "Overall, we played a good game and I'm proud of my team. Unfortunately, good games don't count on the won-lost record.'' 
Running back I.M. Hipp, who 
I' )' scored four times in Nebraska's 69-17 rout of Indiana:-. "We had something to prove after we got beat by Alabama in our opener. We felt we had to have this kind of game to show other teams how good we really are and that they can't take us lightly.'' 
Indiana Coach Lee Corso: ''This is my worst defeat. At Louisville, I was beaten 69-19 by Memphis State and I threw in the towel. Today, I couldn't find a towel to throw in." 

Michigan Coach Bo Schembech­ler, whose fourth-ranked Wolver­ines pounded Duke 52-0 following last week's 28-14 triumph over Notre Dame: "We worried very much about a letdown. In past years, we'd win big one week and then have a letdown. That's not going to happen this year. We're going to be up for every game. You can't play highly emotional every week, but you can come out to play." 
Coach Joe Paterno, after fifth­ranked Penn State upped its record to S-0 by thrashing Texas Christian 
58-0 and outgaining  the  Homed  
Frogs 450 yards to 181:  "We're  
making progress."  
Memphis  State  Coach  Richard  

Williamson, a 59-0 loser to Texas A&M, said Curtis Dickey's 65-yard scoring run on the game's first play "put us in a state of shock, and we stayed that way the rest of the afternoon.'' 
Bear Bryant, after Alabama rallied from a 21-16 third-period deficit to crush Vanderbilt 51-28: "We either made big plays or bad plays. We seldom looked like a football team, and we never looked­like one that had any coaching." 
Running back Frt;d Jacobs, who scored all three touchdowns as Pitt rallied to beat North Carolina 20-16: "When there's 30 seconds left, they've got the ball and we don't have any timeouts left, that's when I worry.'' 
Coach Barry Switzer, expressing satisfaction with top-ranked Okla­homa's 512-yard offensive display in a 45-23 rout of Missouri: "I think our performance should en­hance our position in the polls. We felt like we could go out the first half and score every time we had the ball, and we almost did that.''

Dodgers best Phi/lies, 9-5 
PHILADELPHIA [AP]· Steve Garvey slammed two home runs, tripled, drove in four runs and scored three times, powering the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 9-5 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies last night in the opening game of the Natipnal League championship series. 
The second game in the best-of­five playoff will be today before the series moves to Los Angeles for Game 3 tomorrow night. 
In addition to Garvey's thunder­ing bat, Davey Lopes crashed a two-run homer and Steve Yeager, starting his seventh game since July 1, hit a solo shot. In all, the Dodgers rapped 13 hits off four Philadelphia pitchers in this re­mat~h of last year's playoffs. 
While Los Angeles' power hitting made a gray, rain-threaten­ing night more miserable for 63,460 rabid Phillies' fans, rookie Bob Welch, in relief of starter Burt Hooton, pitched 4 1-3 innings of two-hit, one-run ball and gained credit for the victory. 
The only hits off Welch came in the bottom of the ninth, a leadoff home run by pinch hitter Jerry Martin and a single by Larry Bowa.

Hunter was the highest placing American in the NCAA Division I championships held last year. One, however, might want to keep a keen eye on Auburn's freshman phenom Tom Graves. Last year Graves was the most highly rec­ruited high school cross-country prospects in North America. 
The Irish, fourth place finishers a year ago, are looking for some marked improvement. Seven tal­ented roster members are entered in the race. They are lead by senior, co-captain Dennis VanderKraats of Toronto,Ontario Canada. Senior Joe Strohman, sophomores Pat Sullivan, Chuck Aragon and Charlie Fox, along with blue-chip freshmen Tony Hatherly and Ed Bomber hope to place high in the individual rankings. Senior co-captain Steve Welch is side­lined with an injury and will not compete. 
"Nine or ten teams have a shot at winning,'' says Coach Piane. 
"Last year's winning time was

Rice leads Irish defense 
by Mark Perry Sports W rlter 

Although the offense of the Notre Dame soccer team has been receiving most of the headlines this year, it would be hard to forget th{l strong play of the defense. The Irish have only allowed '!ight goals in their first eleven games, and have recorded five shutouts at this point. One of the reasons for this strong defensive play is co-captain Jim Rice. 
Rice, a senior from Manhasset, NY, along with his fellow fullbacks Randy Wittry, Tom Luetkehans, nd and Jim Sabitus, have been ex­tremely successful this year in keeping the Notre Dame opponents bottled up in their own end, allowing the halfbacks and for­wards many scoring opportunities, and a monopoly on the glory. 
Rice first became interested in soccer during grade school, where he played during lunchtime. But when he entered Chaminade High School in Mineola, NY, Rice did not become involved in soccer right away. 
''Chaminade is a difficult school 'as far as studies go," Rice said, "so I concentrated on that my freshman year. But by my sopho­more year I decided to go out for soccer." 
The going was tough for Rice, who was • one of the younger members of the team, but by his senior year ·he had evolved into a "decent" player, g~. ~nough to be selected to the· all-Long Island team that year. The team also developed at this time, and nearly qualified for the state playoffs in Jim's last year. 
Rice also played lacrosse at his high school, serving as captain for two years. He gained additional soccer experience playing for the Hicksville club team, "one of the better teams on the island as far as clubs go." 
Rice credits his early soccer education to three people: his two coaches and a close friend. 
•'The coach I had in high school was also a wrestling coach, and they asked him to coach soccer because they needed one," Rice said. "The first day of practice he h~d us doing every kind of push-up . on earth. But he. taught us how to be aggressive and a lot about hustle.'' 
''The coach I had at Hicksville, Frank Schnurr, was excellent," 

Jim Rice, right, prepares to head a shot away from the goal during last weekend's game with Purdue. 
Rice continued. ''He also coached at Fordham in New York. I learned a lot from him about finesse and technique." 
"I also learned a lot from a close friend of mine," Rice added. "He hadmoved to our area from Cali­fornia, and his father moved around the world, so he picked up soccer in England when he was ten. 
He was an all-American, and taught me about defense, since he was a good offensive player." 
Rice -came to Notre Dame mostly for academics, although he re­ceived a few letters from other schools. But soccer was still important to him. "I didn't pick Notre Dame because it had an outstanding soccer program, but at least it had a program. I didn't want to become bookworm." 
His freshman athletics also in­cluded lacrosse, but Rice saw that soccer was beginning to catch on at Notre Dame, and decided to stick with that sport. 
The growth of the soccer team at Notre Dame has been impressive to Rice. "When I came here I was disappointed with the team. The Hicksville team could have run them off the field. The style of play was not as advanced, and I though I was going downhili...But by my sophomore year we started to get better, and then last year we started talking about possibly going varsity, and started writing letters towards that goal." 
"Then Rich Hunter started getting in the picture,'' he con­tinued, "and he has advanced the program tremendously. And from then on things started happening." 
Rice has also noticed a great improvement from last year's team. "A lot of the reason that we did so well last year was because Rick had us prepared so well for games. Our skills weren-'t--that great, but he had us in great shape, and most of the time we ran people off the field, even if they were two or three times better than we were." 
"This year everybody knew what
