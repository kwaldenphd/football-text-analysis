O'Brien is retiring his post after leading the Irish bands for 34 years, during which time he supervised more than 220 football halftime band performances and helped to entertain more than 14,000,000 people. He was instrumental in nearly doubling the number of yearly performances and in tripling the size of the band. Now that he is retiring, O'Brien said he hopes to spend his addi­tional time working on a complete accounting of the oldest mar­ching band in the country.

A suspect in the April 27 robbery of a Notre Dame stu­dent's off-campus house was apprehended last week, using infor­mation supplied by a neighbor of the student. Steven D. Perkins, 21, 725 E. Wenger, was arrested and charged with felony burglary, said county officials. A neighbor of student Joe Donnelly read an Observer article about the crime and noticed that the car described in the story matched one that he had seen in the vicinity, said Don­nelly. The neighbor took down the car's license plate number and later learned the driver's last name. He then gave the information to Donnelly who passed it along to police officials. Using this in­formation, police arrested Perkins. -The Observer

All roads must converge 
As an intern with Notre Dame Magazine this semester some of my most valuable learning ex­periences were the Wednesday morning staff Sarah meetings. I usually sat quietly in my place and ab­sorbed all of the talk of prospective writers and Hamilton deadlines and such, because I was the apprentice. One

week, however, there was in attendance a young lady 
whom I outranked by more than 20 years. 
A shortage of babysitters had brought Laura to her 
father's office that morning. Although she should be 
applauded for her silence and good manners, Laura 
refused to stay put in her place. With no paternal 
assistance she sat up and stretched her arms. Then 
Laura painlessly toppled forward, and on her hands 
and knees, she crawled toward the door. 
Not a child psychologist, I don't know the capacity 
of a baby's mind. But if babies possess coherent 
thoughts, I'm certain that Wednesday morning Laura 
must have thought, "Wow! Look at me. All by 
myself I am sitting up. Now look, I can crawl. I can 
move myself from one point to another." 
To realize personal talents, gifts and capabilities, to 
discover a new part of oneself, is a terrific and impor­
tant thing. It is being alive. 
As graduation looms, now is an appropriate time 
for us to sit up and say, "Wow! Look at us. See all 
the possibilities of life and that which we have to offer 
it." 

Numerous curricula have led us down different 
academic paths, but all of these roads should converge 

in one academic goal. As I understand the purpose of 
an institution of higher education, it is much more 
than the communication of knowledge, it is the en­
couragement of curiosity. A university or college stockpiling nuclear weapons and starving nations, of

Graduate student, wife commit double suicide 
By MARK PANKOWSKI 
News Editor 
A Notre Dame foreign graduate student and his wife were found Sunday in their University Village apartment, the victims of a double suicide. 
Solomon Aptekar, 29, and Irene Aptekar, 27, both from Bombay, India, died after ingesting liquid cyanide, Deputy County Coroner James McMeel ruled. The time of death was placed sometime on or near Wednesday, May 7. 
A note found in his apartment in­dicated the couple had been distraught because Solomon had failed his oral examination for his thesis, said Richard Conklin, University director of public rela­tions and information. Solomon was a doctoral student in metallurgy. 
Notre Dame Security discovered the bodies at I: 15 p.m. after being called by a friend of the couple who earlier that day had opened up a letter from Solomon, Conklin said. 
The letter, dated May 7, in­structed the friend to go to the cou­ple's apartment, said Conklin. If the friend received no response, he was to call Security. 
Solomon had been at the Univer­sity since beginning his doctoral studies in 1980, said University Village Chaplain Father David Bur­rell. Irene was not a student at the University. The couple has been married since December, 1984. 
Burial services for the deceased couple were held yesterday at Tem­ple Beth-El in South Bend. Burial followed in Rosehill Cemetery. 
Solomon's mother and brother were to come from Bombay to at­tend the services, Burrell said. 

SMC speaker to draw protesters 
By THERESA GUARINO 
Senior StaffReporter 

Picketers and protestors have planned to be among the many visitors to Saint Mary's campus during this commencement weekend. 
A demonstration on graduation day tomorrow has been scheduled by local anti-abortion groups to protest the presence of com­mencement speaker Barbara Ken­nelly, a Democratic con­gresswoman from Connecticut. 
Opponennts claim that Ken­nely's voting records in the House of Representatives indicate a pro­choice stance on aboration. 
Organizations including St. Joseph County Right to Life, Democrats for Life and several area Protestant churches will take part in the demonstration, which College President William Hickey called an "unfortunate situation." 
Saying that he finds the protest difficult to understand when Ken­nelly's record is objectively assess­ed, Hickey added that "every group has a right to their opinion but they also have the respon­sibility of being objective under each question and situation." 
Burnie Bauer, national presi­dent of Democrats for Life, an anti-abortion caucus in the Democratic Party, said Kennelly voted pro-choice in four of the five roll call voates dealing with abortion in 1985 in the House. She was absent for one vote, ac­cording to Bauer. 
Doug Johnson, legislative chairman for the National Right to Life in Washington said Ken­nelly is "100 percent in suppon of legal abonions and federal fun­ding of abortion on demand." 
Kennelly was quoted in a 1982 edition of Washington Magazine as saying "it is outrageous for any politician to tell a woman what to do about that (abortion). . . It shouldn't be discussed in Con­gress." In an interview with The Observer May I, Kennelly said she would rather not address the abortion issue over the phone because of its complexity. 
Bauer has sent letters to Hickey and members of the Board of Regents, expressing his disap­proval over Kennelly's selection. The letter asked that Saint Mary's either withdraw its invitation or announce publicly and during Kennelly's introduction that the College is honoring Kennelly despite her pro-choice stance. 
Protestors will not enter Col­lege grounds because it is private property, but they plan to picket the entrance to the College, said Virginia Black, a member of the board of directors of St. Joseph County Right to life. 
Hickey said that Kennelly was researched and approved by the Board of Regents who are "pleas­ed with their choice."

1986 valedictorians: hard work was the key 
ByELLYNMASTAKO 
Senior StaffReporter 
A lot of hard work. 

That's what Notre Dame valedic­
torian Daniel Thompson and Saint 
Mary's co-valedictorians Mary 
Kathryn Leary and Karen Draths 
consider the key to their academic .success. 
Thompson, who achieved a 
perfect 4.0 grade point average, 
said his high marks were the result 
of a lot of hard work but "nothing 
excessive, no overload." 

"You can get good grades 
without pulling all-nighters," said 
Thompson, a theology and 
philosophy major from 
Reynoldsburg, Ohio. 

Leary, whose 3.968 GPA equall­
ed that of Draths, also attributed 
her grades to a lot of hard work. 

"It didn't come easy, but I got a 
lot of support from my teachers 
and my classmates," said Leary, a 
native of Creve Coeur, Missouri 
and a business major with an ac­
counting concentration. 

Draths, a chemistry major from 
Morton Grove, Illinois, also said 
she considers her grades to be the 
product of a lot of hard work. She 
added, however, "I'm certainly not 
in the library any more than my 
share." 

Thompson, who will attend 
divinity school at the University of 
Chicago, said that "one's grade 
point average is not necessarily a 
measure of intelligence. It's really 
just how good you are in school." 
Thompson, who plans to pursue 
masters and doctoral studies and 
eventually to teach theology on the college level, said the topic of his commencement-day speech is to be a surprise. "The element of surprise gives it more of a dramatic im­pact." 
Leary, who has been involved with the Toastmasters and accoun­ting clubs, said upon graduating, she will join the Kimberly-Clark Corporation in Connecticut as a financial assistant. 
Leary said she recently tallied the highest score in the College's history on her business comprehen­sives. All Saint Mary's students are required to pass departmental com­prehensives in order to graduate. 
Draths, who plans to attend graduate school at Stanford University, intends to pursue a doc­torate and eventually enter either industrial research or the teaching profession. 
She has also been active in the chemistry club at Saint Mary's and served in student government dur­ing her freshman and sophomore years. · Draths and Leary are coor­dinating their speeches. They said they will address the whole idea of commencement and its meaning for 
the  entire college  as  well  as  the  
senior class.  
Notre  Dame and  Saint  Mary's  

both choose their valedictorians based on cumulative grade point averages.

A conversation with the r~eluctant atheist 
Father Robert Griffin 
Letters to a Lonely God 


Spirit turned out to be ciphers ad­ding up to a score of zero, powerless to create the world, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?" 
He wants me to admit that I'd race to bordellos, or become a thief. I said, "Does it occur to you that the good pagan may care more about the way the neighborhood is run than a careless Christian does? Pagans hate cruelty, murder, in­justice and vice. They have con­sciences that would keep them awake at night if they let deviates harm the children." 
He said, "You're saying that changing from a Christian to an atheist wouldn't make a great dif­ference in your life?" · "Maybe as a reluctant atheist, I'd ·pray less," I admitted. "If prayer seemed the way to keep hope on its toes, I'd pray twice as much.'' 
"You'd be talking to yourself!" he protested. I gave him the quiet smile of a traveler who has always known his journey could be a mistake. 
''What would there be to hope for in a godless world?" He sound­ed poignant, as though on the verge of asking to be saved. 
"Paul wrote, 'Love is patient, love is kind, and not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.' I hope that human love in action is an idea whose time has come, even though the candles of heaven have all gone out, because No body's home." I hate the cuteness which tries to domesticate the cosmic darkness. What else do you do with a space in which the absence is as visible as a presence? 
I said, " 'Greater love no man has than this, that he should lay down his life for his friend.' This isn't an ideal we should give up. Such sacrifices remain beautiful for their unselfishness. Acts of love like this would never become expendable." 
I was beginning to tire of being on the defensive in this dumb con­versation. I said, "Joseph, you're arguing as though believing were a form of gambling in which you're afraid of backing the wrong horse.'' 
"I'm a very good Catholic," he reminded me. "I go to Mass every Sunday. I'm only curious to know how you'd feel if you found out that religion is a hoax, and you'd been wasting your time." 
"It's a gamble," I said. "I'm gambling on a sure thing. If I found out it was all a mistake, I wouldn't change anything." 
"Reliance on a God you can't see is risky, don't you think? Why does He stay invisible, like Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy?" 
"Germs drifting on the wind are also invisible," I said, "and so are pain, fear, love and the other emo­tions. The visible world is controll­ed by things that the eye can't see. 
Invisibility is not a serious com­plaint about God." 
"Not as long as there are miracles. Have any good miracles been happening? Has any good wine been served at a wedding?" 
He was enjoying himself. Young Catholics love the game of corner­ing the priest. "Miracles are the frosting on the cake," I said. "The Lord warned us that faith is shallow if it needs to see miracles." 
"So what turns you onto God, Father?" He was starting to chortle like the village atheist. The village atheist is never far away from the village idiot. 
"Truth!" I said the word with authority so he could see I was im­patient with him. "The New Testa­ment is full of truth that leaves even the skeptics enriched. Without knowing theology, the Roman soldiers were shaken by the dignity of Christ on the cross. You can im­agine them taking off their caps to the dead outlaw, because the politi­cians couldn't get Him to say 'Un­cle.' At his death, he was more powerful than Caesar, because He resisted hatred. I don't know who He was if He wasn't God; but He was godlike beyond comparison. Who, in life or literature, compares with Him? It's hard to write of Him without diminishing the perfection of the Gospel sketches. Who are the artists, where are the speech writers, capable of producing a script featuring goodness, love, pity, mer­cy and forgiveness, so impressive and holy that they seem like revela­Creed." This was Joseph's way of telling me I was delivering a ser­mon. 
tions  of the  emotions  that  God  
keeps in His heart?"  
"Let's  all  stand  and  recite  the  

I said, "Nobody invented Jesus. He's too unpredictable. You don't need metaphysics to prove He's there. You only need to hear His words. Who would say, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do'? You trace such tenderness to its source. You find the Teacher who had love for everybody, and helped them make sense of the human condition." 
"Who was He?" asked Joseph, thoughtful over the riddle of the ages. 
"Call Him E.T.'s older brother, and I would still love Him," I said. "He's God's Son, and I don't want to lose Him. Even if He's a confus­ed Messiah Who couldn't cut the mustard, He knows more of the score than anyone, and I don't want to lose Him. He spoke as sweetly and encouragingly as I would want God to speak, and He didn't hide from suffering. He has my eternal gratitude, and I wouldn't give Him up for the world." 
We reached the end of our talk. I didn't want Joseph leaving campus feeling that his religion was an albatross hanging around his neck. I couldn't argue him into faith and grace; but it isn't necessary. Truth and grace are available to the mind and heart that stay open to the sim­ple promises: "Come unto me . . . My yoke is easy, my burden is light.'' Only the Son, seated at the right hand of the Father, has the right and power to make such pro­mises. God bless the graduates. Darby O'Gill and I never said we didn't love you. 

Joseph is an aspmng theology major who likes to ask impossible questions. "What would you do," he wanted to know, ''if you had positive proof that there is no God?" I was willing to play the game of Faith Crisis by his rules, treating his wild hypotheses as though they were defensible. It is hard to prove anything, pro or con, about the existence of God. 
"Nothing would change," I answered, "except that I would have to try harder.'' Joseph has no idea how often a priest flies blind. He was hoping to hear I would kill myself out of disappointment, if God disappeared from my radar screen. 
He said, "Wouldn't trying harder be a waste of time? Wouldn't everything change if you knew nobody cared if you're bad or good?" He thinks religion needs God to make the rules. He would have to invent God, to reward good and punish evil. 
"Love wouldn't change. Respon-. sibility wouldn't change. Without God, hope wouldn't come easily. That's why all of us would need to try harder.'' 
"Listen!" he said seriously, "I'm talking about no God: God as a mistake the churches made, and the exposure of His non-existence is so clear that the Pope resigns. I'm ask­ing: if the Father, Son and Holy

On Sept. 18, a group of 12 student leaders requested to see The Observer's 1984­85 financial statements. Their request was prompted by The Observer's increase in advertising rates. The Observer declined to honor the request, saying it was accountable to students through the University's Budget Unit Control system. 
A group of students collected approx­imately 600 signatures on a petition in its first day in an attempt to recall former Stu­dent Body President Bill Healy and Vice President Duane Lawrence. The group, numbering approximately 50 students, cir­culated the petition titled, "A Real Beginn­ing" but abandoned their attempt after meeting with Healy.

Dear Friends: 
I'm sorry it took so long, but thank you very much for the "Irish Clover" award. It still puzzles me, as I'm sure there were many other eligible people. 
It's exciting to be the recipient of the same award as Gerry Faust. He might not have a successful coach for Notre Dame football, but as a person he can't be beat. This award does mean a lot to me. Thank you very much.

Bookstore XV tourney adds to rich tradition 
Dear Editor: 
Despite the best attempts of South Bend weather to stop it, Bookstore Basketball XV is history. For my part I watched it end with mixed emotions. When I took the job of tournament commissioner, I was told alter­nately that it was "the best job on campus" and "ten weeks of constant hell." Now that the dust has settled, I am ready to admit that it lived up to both billings. 
Bookstore is a huge operation and I had a number of people working with me who helped to insure that the near chaos never quite got out of control. These people put in a lot of time and effort without much recognition, but without them Bookstore XV could never have been the success it was. First and foremost, my assistant commis­sioners, Carol Cavaliere, Gus Herbert, Dan Meixner, Denise Weis, and Chris Borgstrom, who put in long hours on and off the courts and made my job much simpler. Matt Laven 
Hamilton and the rest of The Observer staff 
did a great job providing tournament 
coverage and Rudy Brandl, Kevin Herbert 
and Frank Mastro did the same at WVFI. 
Bookstore XV also had a group of over fifty dedicated scorekeepers who helped us, despite having to endure the worst of South Bend's spring weather. Certain members of the Notre Dame staff were also unwavering in their support, especially John Monhaut and the ND maintenance staff, Rex Rakow and the security force and everyone down at the Copy Center, who turned out the largest schedule and scoresheet delivery in the tour­nament's history. 
Lastly, I would like to offer my personal thanks to Jeff Blumb, commissioner of Bookstore XIII and XIV and this year's com­miSSioner emeritus. Jeff kept me on the right path with solid advice, but always made it clear that it was my job and the deci­sions were mine in the end. His guidance this year makes me confident of my ability to run the tournament solo next year. 
I believed when I started, and still believe now, that Bookstore Basketball is one of those traditions which makes Notre Dame special. As Fritz Hoefer and Vince Meconi envisioned 15 years ago, Bookstore is basket­ball played the Notre Dame way, intense, competitive and fun. The tournament has been accused from its beginning of becoming too competititive (I found a comment to this effect in a 1975 edition of The Observer -the fourth year of the tournament). Notre Dame students enjoy competition and enjoy being the best, and yes on occasion the intensity goes too far, but in my experience these in­cidents have been isolated and almost always resolved when the heat of competition dies. 
Bookstore's history is somewhat shorter 
than some of the other traditions which cidents best forgotten, but for the most part the stories are about people enjoying the game of basketball, which is what Bookstore Basketball is all about.

ND fight against MS sets example for others 
Dear Editor: 
One short year ago, the University of Notre Dame raised over $20,000 in the first year of the Students Against Multiple Sclerosis collegiate fundraising drive, the most of any participating schools. 
What virtually no one could have foreseen was the tremendous impact that our efforts would have on this and future years' cam­paigns. 
With Notre Dame as an example, over 120 schools embarked on the Rock-A-Like fun­draiser in 1985-1986. These schools raised over $300,000. 
My involvement in this year's fundraising activities helped me to appreciate even more the support and spirit which the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's community gave to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in 1985. 
As the school year draws to a close, and a new Rock-A-Like winner wil'l be chosen in early June, I would like to thank the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students as well as the faculty of Notre Dame for all of their support in helping to fight MS and in aiding the over 500,000 Americans already af­flicted.

Challenges lie beyond the Dome 
Conflicting emotions. They run rampant at a time like this. Feelings of anticipation and dread co-exist in the hearts of graduating seniors. As we forge ahead to a new and exciting future, sentiment tempts us to drag our feet. 
Jeanne Grammens 
ask not 

We fill our last weeks and days in full en­joyment of each other's company. Nothing, not even books and classes, get in the way of our "final hours." The seniors, the class of 1986, "did it up right," as they utilized every hour to pack as much of the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's experience in. Final ex­ams never saw such cramming. Senior month kept everyone busy with the luau, Booze Cruise, cocktail party, Cooler Night, Mr. D's, dunes trips, brunch, cook-outs, mass at the Grotto and good old Senior Bar (even though it was taken over by juniors sometime in March). But even amid the hub­bub, many found some moments to reflect upon the last four years. 
The flashbacks are unbelieveable. Wasn't it just yesterday, we were silly freshmen run­ning over to the Saint Mary's panty raid or worse, throwing panties out of Regina win­dows to those howling domers. How about the first screw-your-roommate dance. You know, the one where your date spilled his drink down the front of your new dress. It was the same guy who kept calling you Mary when your name is Anne. And let's not forget those wild parties in the dorm basements. The biggest problem then was figuring out how to get the girls to stay at your dorm rather than going to the seven concurring parties. The girls thought it was great as long as they could hit ten parties in three hours. Then there was that football game where you stood up at the top of the bleachers in the snow, squinting to see the football field while you were more interested in the cute red head at your left. One of the most interesting memories was An Tostal. You thought you came to college to grow up, but students were running around at Recess skipping rope. And how can we forget the joys of "mud in your eye," and your hair and clothes ... 
Yes the memories run rampant, but as we experience this "string of lasts," it is hard not to feel incomplete. There were so many things that never got done, and so many peo­ple we meant to spend more time with. As we near the end of our college experience, we realize these things cannot get done tomor­row. We are forced to be satisfied with the memories we formed as we look ahead to building future memories. A new beginning. 
It is a scary thought, but we met the challenge of the new beginning four years ago. With this new challenge there are many questions. Some of these questions will take years to answer, and perhaps some will never be answered fully. 
As we forge ahead to new challenges, we must do two things. First, no matter how frustrating the circumstances ahead are, we must never give up the dreams that were formed under the Golden Dome. Each and every one of us here is special. We all hold special gifts and insights which we haved shared with each other and expanded upon in our years here. We may have idealistic hopes of implementing these insights into the 
world beyond college. However, "out there" 
lies a cold word called "reality." We must 
not give up these dreams as we struggle in 
reality. When you give up your dream, you 
die. You become stagnant in a sea of yup­
pies. 
I also believe it is important for us to carry 
on the reputations of the University and Col­
lege; we must do them proud. We have all 
had the privilege to participate in something 
that is foreign to most people in this world. 
We have had the opportunity to improve 
ourselves through study and interaction with 
others who hold Christian ideals. The 
challenges we have faced and the questions 
we tried to answer have formed mature, sen­
sitive, concerned human beings. Evidence of 
this growth should be integrated into "the 
world out there." The how-to's cannot be 
defined right now, but we should leave the 
Golden Dome with consciousness fully alive. 
Many liave told us our college years are the "best years of our lives." We should not accept this statement as a predictor of the future, but rather as a challenge. Notre Dame and Saint Mary's were merely the basic training camps for the army of life. The revelations we have had here, the pro­blems we have solved, the mountains we have climbed have formed compassionate adults who are on the verge of a new challenge. A challenge to fill "life" with the best of times as we seek our dreams as graduates of the University of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. May God bless us on our way.

This has been a week of reminiscing. As seniors run around in last-minute socializ­ing, class get-togethers and goodbyes in between packing and cleaning up for mom and dad, all the way through there's been those funny but nostalgic stories of the last four years. 

Mary Healy 
guest column 

"R001ember that time freshman year when 
we all went swimming at midnight in St. 
Joe's Lake?" "And remember the Pitt game 
when Allen Pinkett ran the kickoff all the 
way back for a touchdown?" "And 
remember that guy who used to swallow 
goldfish at Holy Cross parties?" "And how 
could we forget Father Fitz saying masses at 
B-P?" 
Sometimes these memories have been mix­
ed with a tinge of regret. Have we truly made 
the most of these four years -"the best 
years of your life"? What if I hadn't 
been so quick to blow off studying and skip 
classes, but had really taken advantage of the 
academic atmosphere and gone to all the lec­
tures and events I'll never have the oppor­
tunity for again? On the other hand, what if 
I had spent more time with the friends who 
are so important now but who will all go 
their separate ways Monday? What if I 
hadn't had all those struggles that made 
some days·great and some unbearable? 
But then, without those peaks and hollows 
how would Notre Dame have shaped us? 
Without the frustration of spending hours 
(ususally early morning ones) writing a 
paper, you'll never learn how to write. And 
without its ups and downs, its much-berated 
social life, and even its administration that 
often seems in loco parentis, Notre Dame 
wouldn't have educated us on the art of liv­
ing the way it has. 
This week the class of '86 is finally going to hit that legendary "real world" we've heard so much about. And when we do, we'll be very different people from the ones who arrived on campus lonely and homesick four years ago. Because Notre Dame wasn't perfect, it showed us how to be ourselves in that real world. It trained our minds for ''those useful careers, but it reminded us that there's a lot that's more important than a $30,000 a year job. It showed us how to look for God when it's easy to and when it isn't so 
easy. 
Notre Dame is never seen through such 
rose-colored glasses as it is in the last few 
weeks. Everything seems better -the campus 
prettier, the Grotto more special, the parties 
more fun, the Dome shinier, the friends 
closer. Even classes are more exciting. 
But if it had been so rosy all along we 
would be none the better for it. From sitting 
through interminable classes and working on 
tough projects and papers, we learned the 
value of a solid education. After enduring 
long, cold and ugly South Bend winters we 
saw how beautiful the campus was in spring. 
And through times of difficulty and distance 
we learned how much our friendships really 
mean to us. 
Looking back, it all seems so great. But 
looking ahead, it's great too, because we've 
gained something that we'll always take with 
us, something that will eventually be more 
important. 
As one Notre Dame senior said, "You'll 
leave Notre Dame, but Notre Dame will 
never leave you."

Kovaleski named capt. of '86 Irish 

By MARTY STRASEN 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Mike Kovaleski, a senior inside linebacker, has been elected captain of the 1986 Notre Dame football team. The vote, conducted at the close of spring drills, was made by his teammates. Unlike past years, the Irish will have only one captain. 

Mike Kovaleski 

"That's the way Coach Holtz decided to do it, and everyone on the team respects that," said Kovaleski. "It's his decision and if he wants only one captain, then that's how many there's going to be. I'm just glad to be the one. 
"It's just a great honor for me to be selected, especially since there's only one captain this year. That makes it an awesome responsibili­ty. "I'm really looking forward to next year," continued Kovaleski. "Being captain is going to put some extra weight on my shoulders, but it's not anything that I can't handle. If it was, I wouldn't have accepted the position." 
The 6-2, 218-pound native of New Castle, In., has started in 29 games during his career, including the 1983 Liberty Bowl and the 1984 Aloha Bowl. Kovaleski finished se­cond on the team in tackles last year with 95 after leading the team with 108 his sophomore season and third with 62 in his freshman cam­paign. As with the rest of the retur­ning seniors, Holtz is looking for­ward to good things from Kovaleski. 
"I've said that for us to have any success this fall, our seniors are go­ing to have to play the best fall of their careers," said Holtz. "As cap­tain, Mike will play an instrumental role in making that happen. He has earned the respect of his teammates because of his contributions the last three years, and I know he has earned the respect of everyone con­nected with the program because of his dedication and enthusiasm and the fact that he has played hurt on numerous occasions."

Asst. A.D. Petro goes to Virginia 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN 
Sports Editor 
After eight years as an Irish coach and one year as one of Notre Dame's assistant athletic directors, Sharon Petro will be trading in her office for a classroom and the Golden Dome for the Rotunda of the University of Virginia. Petro will study for her doctorate in sports psychology at the Charlot­tesville, Va., school. 
"I'm terribly excited," said Petro of her move. "It's a chance to do something different. It's something I've been interested in doing for a long time." 

Sharonhtro 
Petro joined the Notre Dame 

coaching staff in 1977 as head 
coach of the women's basketball 
team. She finished with a three­
year career record of 49-20, in­
cluding an Indiana AlA W state ti­
tle. 
Petro was also coach of the 

women's tennis team for seven 
years. Her career record stands at 
89-40, including two NCAA Divi­
sion II third-place finishes in 1983 
and 1984 and second-place finish 
last year for which she was named 
the Division II coach of the year_ In 
addition, Petro's tennis squads won 
two North Star Conference cham­
pionships and three Indiana state 
titles. 
This year, Petro joined Athletic 

Director Gene Corrigan's staff, 
where she served as a liason with 
the North Star Conference and 
worked with Notre Dame's 
women's sports. 
"I hate to see her leave, she's a 

heck of a gal," said Corrigan. "But 
this is something she's wanted to 
do. I'd like to hire another woman 
to replace her. I've had a few of the 
athletes visit me, and they said they 
apprecitated having her there. If I 
can find someone who's had the 
same playing, coaching, and ad­
ministrative experience, then I'll 
hire her." 
Petro is a graduate of Wayne State and holds a masters in health and physical education from Eastern Michigan and a masters in science in administration from Notre Dame. With the degree she is now seeking, Petro is anticipating work in a new area. 
"I want to get back to working with athletes as well as the ad­ministration," says Petro. "I'd like to work as an academic advisor like Mike DeCico does here. I'd like to work with coaches and players, help with emotional problems ­more than just teach forehands and free throws. 
"It will be a little scary, though, going back to school after 20 years."

S~orts 
Remember. • • 
For many members of the Class of '86, Notre Dame sports have not quite lived up to the expectations they held at the beginning of their freshmen year. We were told how good the football and basketball programs were, even though the two teams were coming off 5-6 and 10-17 seasons, respectively. We were told how Notre Dame always won. We were told how exciting things would be. 
Jeff Blumb 
Sports Editor 1985-86 


The success we desired may not have come to pass, but one thing 
which can never be taken away are the many memories which will re­
main etched in our minds. Although those memories may not be of 
trips to the Sugar Bowl or to the Final Four, they are good 
memories nonetheless. 
FRESHMAN YEAR: 

Remember... that first football season. The Irish opened by 
beating Michigan, 23-17, in a nationally-televised game under the 
lights of MUSCO, and everything looked so right, so perfect. Then 
there was the stunning upset of No. 1 Pitt, keyed by a freshman 
named Pinkett, and the greeting the team found upon returning to 
campus. And how could we forget Michael Harper's phantom 
touchdown, which sent USC to a 17-13 win over Notre Dame in the 
final game of the season. 

Remember... the week when Kentucky, UCLA and Indiana visited the ACC. The Irish were unable to satisfy student chants of "We want Kentucky Fried," but narrowly missed beating UCLA, losing when Ralph Jackson went the length of the floor for a layup with three seconds left. SOPHOMORE YEAR: 
Remember... the joy of beating Purdue (52-6), USC (27-6) and Boston College (19-18 in the Liberty Bowl), while losing heart­breakers to Miami (20-0), Pitt (21-16), Penn State (34-30) and Air Force (23-22). 
Remember... Tom Sluby's critical three-point play with 18 seconds left, which sent the Irish to a 52-47 upset of No. 5 Maryland. The senior would continue to lead the youthful Irish all the way to the NIT finals against Michigan, where the Cinderella story came to an end. JUNIOR YEAR: 
Remember... the 3-4 start which included the loss to Purdue at 
the Hoosier Dome, after which the Irish rebounded to win· their 
final four regular season games and a trip tcHawaii to play SMU in 
the Aloha Bowl. 

Remember... all the great basketball games, including thenar­row loss to North Carolina in the NCAA tournament. There was the early-season upset of Indiana, the win over UCLA at Pauley, the victories over Washington, Marquette and Dayton in the final week, and, of course, the NCAA tournament. SENIOR YEAR: 
Remember... the rollercoaster ride of the football season. After the Irish lost three of their first four games, all eyes were on Gerry Faust as he coached in the final year of a five-year contract. But Notre Dame answered with four straight victories. Three straight losses to conclude the season, including a 58-7 drubbing by Miami, would end any chance of a post-season bowl or renewal of Faust's contract. 
Remember... the disappointing end to the brilliant careers of four Irish seniors, when tiny Arkansas-Little Rock upset the Irish, 90-83, in the first round of the NCAA tournament. The season had its brighter moments, though, including an upset of eighth ranked Syracuse at the Carrier Dome and narrow losses at North Carolina and Duke, both of which were ranked No. 1 at the time Notre Dame played them. 
IN GENERAL: 

Remember... Gerry Faust's grace under fire. 
Remember... Allen Pinkett's class as all the attention was on Faust while he was breaking numerous records, including the all­time rushing record. Remember... the thrilling moves of David Rivers. How could they be forgotten? Remember... all your other fond memories which there weren't space for here.

The T AC Championships will feature the best runners in the na­tion, both collegiate and club. In this race Tyler hopes to make the finals, which would give him a shot at joining a club team after he graduates.
