SMC theater group puts on controversial play 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY 
News Writer 
"Stop Kiss," Saint Mary's spring theater production, was met with initial hesitation due to its controversial themes of homosexuality and violence but was eventually accepted by the audience. 
When it was first announced that "Stop Kiss" would be per­formed on campus, several members of the Saint Mary's student body sent e-mails to the play's director, Katie Sullivan, expressing concerns over some of the play's content. 
In an e-mail to the student body, Sullivan explained that the play was chosen to help explore violence in the every­day world. 
"The play spoke loudly to me in its plea for non-violence in our world, both in the larger global picture and in the small individual choices we each make everyday," Sullivan said in an interview. 
Both during and after the per­formance, the audience did not seem to take offense to the issues addressed in the play. 
"It broke some preconceived stereotypes I had about lesbians because the girls were two nor­mal people who happened to fall in love like anybody else falls in love, without trying," Saint Mary's freshman Catie

Cavanaugh -wins RecycleMania 
University participated in 10-week competition for first time 
By EMMA DRISCOLL 
News Writer 
Cavanaugh Hall captured first place in Notre Dame's inter-dorm recycling com­petition -part of the 10­week-long RecycleMania competition between 400 colleges and universities nationwide. This was the first time that Notre Dame participated in RecycleMania. 
Cavanaugh won by col­lecting 81.36 pounds per capita of recyclables, according to Recyclin' Irish president and RecycleMania coordinator Ann Kelley. St. Edward's Hall came in sec­ond with 72.31 pounds per capita, and Walsh took third 
with 65.73 pounds per capi­ta. 
As part of the competi­tion, students took recy­clables out of campus trash cans and from other dorms -a factor in Cavanaugh's 
win,  according  to  the·  
dorm's environmental  com­ 
missioner Sarah Cline.  

"I am so excited and so happy that we won because everyone in the dorm put so much work into it," she said. "We went on raids and really tried to get everybody involved. I know everyone here was really happy about it." 
Cline said Cavanaugh gen­erated a lot of awareness through emails and posters and created enthusiasm by highlighting the competitive aspect of RecycleMania. 
"We put posters every­where and we sent out e­mails," she said. "We really promoted the competition side of it. There was the general consensus that we did not want to lose to Farley, so people were real­ly excited about that." 
In addition to the inter­dorm competition, Kelley said Notre Dame also par­ticipated in the Stephen K. Gatski Per Capita Classic Competition -the original RecycleMania competition in which schools compete to see who can collect the most acceptable recyclables

NEW YOHK -So much for the curse. The New York Yankees have ended a con­struction worker's attempt to jinx their new stadium with a buried Boston Hed Sox jersey. 
Team officials watched Sunday as construction work­ers removed the jersey, with slugger David Ortiz's name on it, from 2 feet of concrete in a service corridor of the stadium that's under con­struction. 
The team says a construc­tion worker -who is a Red Sox fan -recently buried the jersey there while on the job.

Knott honored as 
Prodi's collapse brings early election
Hall of the Year 
Polls may return conservative billionaire Silvio Berlusconi to power 
By STEVE SANTAY News Writer 
Knott Hall was awarded the honor of IIall of the Year by the Hall President's Council last Monday at the Student Leadership Recognition Banquet at Legends. 
Keenan Hall was named Men's Hall of the Year, while Lewis won Women's Hall of the Year. 
Cavanaugh received honor­able mention -the first time ever that an "honorable men­tion" dorm was recognized. 
Knott president Edward Barloh said Knott's success could be attributed to the wide variety of events the dorm host­ed throughout the year, includ­ing charity events and discus­sion with professors. 
"I believe the single-largest reason for Knott's success is that we organized an unprece­dented amount of extremely successful events," Barloh said. "It was a lot of fun; I really enjoyed working with all of the other great dorms on campus." 
Keenan Hall president Mark Weber said although he was very proud of Keenan's success, his overall experience as dorm president was more rewarding. 
"One of the coolest things about being a hall president was the chance to interact with leaders from other dorms," he said. "Awards aside, we're all trying to create an awesome campus atmosphere." 
Although Lewis lost both of its assistant rectors, hall president Jessica Keppel said the hall council was still able to organ­ize exciting events by enticing people with the promise of free food. 
"The commissioners on our hall council really worked hard to get everyone excited," she said. "Offering free Papa John's breadsticks really works well if you want people to come to your events."

ROME -Italians fed up with the governing class and a stag­nant economy voted Sunday in early parliamentary elections that could return conservative billionaire Silvio Berlusconi to power. 
The 71-year-old media mogul's main opponent is Walter Veltroni, a center-left former mayor of Rome who has promised deep reforms and an ideology-free approach to tackling the country's prob­lems.

The idea that sludge -the left­over semisolid wastes filtered from water pollution at 16,500 treatment plants -can be turned into some­thing harmless, even if swallowed, has been a tenet of federal policy for three decades. 
In a 1978 memo, the EPA said sludge "contains nutrients and organic matter which have consid­erable benefit for land and crops" despite the presence of "low levels International Monetary Fund forecasts growth of 0.3 percent this year, compared with a 1.4 percent average growth for the 15-country euro area.

Comparable research was con­ducted by the Agriculture Department and Environmental Protection Agency in a similarly poor, black neighborhood in East St.

The sludge, researchers said, put the children at less risk of brain or nerve damage from lead. A highly toxic element once widely used in gasoline and paint. lead has been shown to cause brain damage among children who ate lead-based paint that had flaked off their homes. 
The msearchers said the phos­phate and iron in the sludge can bind to lead and other hazardous paucity of research 
into the possible 

harmful effects of heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, other chemicals and disease-caus­ing microorganisms often found in sludge. 
A series of reports by the EPA's inspector general and the National Academy of Sciences between 1996 and 2002 faulted the adequacy of the science behind the EPA's 1993 regulations on sludge. 
The chairman of the 2002 acade­my panel, Thomas Burke, a profes­sor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says epi­demiological studies have never been done to show whether spread­ing sludge on land is safe. 
"There are potential pathogens and chemicals that are not in the realm of safe," Burke told the AP. "What's needed are more studies on what's going on with the pathogens in sludge -are we actually remov­ing them? The commitment to con­necting the dot<> hasn't been there."

Berlusconi, who has been prime minister twice before, led elections polls two weeks ago, but more recent polls showed Veltroni making a

Candidates discuss God and religion 
Clinton and Obama answer questions about personal faith at forum 
Associated Press 
GHANTHAM, Pa. Democratic Sen. Hillary Hodham Clinton said Sunday that the potential for life begins at conception as she and presi­dential rival Sen. Barack Obama answered questions about faith and religion in both their personal lives and the public discourse. 
In a forum devoted to an issue rare on the campaign trail, the two White House hopefuls talked about the pres­ence of God in their lives and how often they read the Bible as well as divisive issues such as abortion, abstinence and human rights within the con­text of faith. 
The two are reaching out to people of faith in Pennsylvania, which holds its primary on April 22. GOP nominee-in-wait­ing John McCain did not partic­ipate. 
Clinton was asked whether life begins at conception ­which opponents of abortion contend is a reality that makes any termination of a pregnancy the ending of a lifP. 
"I believe the potential for life begins at conception," Clinton said. "For me, it is also not only about a potential life. It is about the other lives involved. ... I have concluded, after great, you know, concern and searching my own mind and heart over many years, ... that individuals must be entrusted to make this profound decision, 
because the alternative would 
be such an intrusion of govern­
ment authority that it would be 
very difficult to sustain in our 
kind of open society." 
The New York senator added 
that abortion should remain 
legal. safe and rare. 
The two candidates appeared separately at Messiah College near Harrisburg, Pa., and briefly met as Clinton left the stage and Obama took her place. The moment of p~eas­antries and handshakes belied days of angry accusations between the two over Obama's comments about bitter voters in small towns. 
Asked whether life begins at conception, Obama said he did­n't know the answer. 
"This is something that I have not, I think, come to a firm resolution on. I think it's very hard to know what that means, when life begins. Is it when a cell separates? Is it when the soul stirs? ... What I know, as I've said before, is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when we're having these dPbates." 
Clinton is a Methodist. Obama is a member of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, where the retired pas­tor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, touched ofT a furor with ser­mons criticizing the United States. 
The words of Obama's pastor have dogged the campaign, and the candidate reiterated his condemnation of Wright's remarks but stood by his church. 
"Pastors are imperfect. Certainly, the membership is imperfect. I, as somebody who is sitting in the pews as a sin­ner, is imperl'ect," he said. "And, you know, that doesn't detract from, I think, what the church is supposed to be about, which is to worship God and proclaim the good news."

Iraqi governmelllt sacks deserters 
BAGHDAD-Iraq's government moved Sunday to restore discipline within the ranks of the security forces, sacking more than 1,300 soldiers and policemen who deserted during recent fighting 1gainst Shiite militias in Basra. 
At the same time, Iraq's Cabinet ratcheted up the pressure on anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada a\-Sadr by approving draft legislation barring political parties with militias from participating in upcoming provincial elections. 
AI-Sadr, who heads the country's biggest militia, the Mahdi Army, has been under intense pressure frorr Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, also a Shiite, to disband the Mahdi Army or face political imlation. 
Al-Sadr's followers are eager to tak-e part in the local elections because they believe they can take power away from rival Shiite parties in the vast, oil-rich Shiite heartland of south­ern Iraq. 
President's rival to be prime minister 
NAIROBI -President Mwai Kibaki named opposition leader Raile. Odinga as prime min­ister Sunday, implementing a long-awaited power-sharing deal aimed at resolving a politi­cal crisis that left more than 1,000 people dead. 
The deal -signed more than a month ago -marks the first time Kenya will have both a president and prime minister. But the working relationship between Kibaki and Odinga, which has been frosty in the past, will deter­mine how long the coalition lasts.

Officials confiscate witnesses' phones 
SAN ANGELO, Texas -State officials on Sunday enforced a judge's order and confis­cated the cell phones of the women and chil­dren removed from a polygamous sect's pri­vate ranch in West Texas. 
Attorneys ad litem for 18 girls from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints who are in the legal custody of the state had sought the order, said Marissa Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for Texas Child Protective Services. 
The attorneys reasoned that cutting off com­munications would "prevent the possible tam­pering of witnesses," Gonzalez said, reading from the court document. 
It was unclear how many phones were taken Sunday. Gonzalez did not know if the docu­ment could be released.

Obama apologizes for comments 
MUNCIE, Ind. -Democrat Barack Obama on Saturday conceded that comments he made about bitter working class voters who "cling to guns or religion" were ill chosen, as he tried to stem a burst of complaints that he is condescend­ing. 
"I didn't say it as well as I should have," he said at Ball State University. 
As he tried to quell the furor, presidential rival Hillary Rodham Clinton hit Obama with one of her lengthiest and most pointed criticisms to date. 
"Senator Obama's remarks were elitist and out of touch," she said, campaigning about an hour away in Indianapolis. "They are not reflective of the values and beliefs of Americans." 
At issue are comments Obama made privately at a fundraiser in San Francisco last Sunday. He explained his troubles winning over working class voters, saying they have become frustrated with economic conditions: 


Pope to arrive at White House 
Papal visit with President Bush to be second in history; crowd of12,000 expected 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The leader of the world's Roman Catholics has been to the White House only once in history. That changes this week, and President Bush is pulling out all the stops: driving out to a suburban mili­tary base to meet Pope Benedict XVI's plane, bringing a giant audience to the South Lawn and hosting a fancy East Room dinner. 
These are all firsts. 
Bush has never before given a visiting leader the honor of picking him up at the airport. In fact, no president has done so at Andrews Air Force Base, the typical landing spot for modern leaders. 
A crowd of up to 12,000 is due at the White House on Wednesday morning for the pope's official, pomp-filled arrival cere­mony. It will feature the

ISRAEL 

Leaders shun Carter over Hatnas tn~eeting 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM -Former President Jimmy Carter brokered the first Israeli-Arab peace deal, but he's get­ting a cool reception in Israel during his latest visit to the Mideast. 
Israeli leaders are shunning the globe-trotting peacemaker for plan­ning to meet with Khaled Mashaal, the head of Israel's archenemy l-lamas, and comparing the Jewish state's policies to apartheid. 
A schedule released by the Atlanta­based Carter Center showed no plans for the former president to meet any of Israel's key players: Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni or Defense Minister Ehud Barak during this week's visit, which began Sunday. 

The only high-ranking official on Carter's schedule was Israel's cere­monial head of state, President Shimon Peres. The 83-year-old for­mer U.S. leader held a closed meet­ing with Peres shortly after arriving Sunday. 
A senior Israeli official said "sched­uling problems" was the official rea­son given for the high-profile snub­even though Olmert recently took time to chat with "Prison Break" star Wentworth Miller. 
But the real reason for the cold shoulder is Carter's plan to meet with Mashaal when his Carter Center delegation travels later this week to Damascus, Syria, the Israel official said. 
Israel's leader are not publicly crit­icizing Carter out o' respect for his former position as U.S. president, the official added. He spoke on condition of anonymity because his explana­tion went beyond the official position. 
Ahead of his Mideast trip, Carter defended his reasons for wanting to engage l-lamas and said he feels "quiet at ease" abo 11t meeting with l-lamas militants. 
"I think there's no doubt in any­one's mind that if Israel is ever going to find peace with justice concerning the relationship with their next-door neighbors, the Palestinians, that l-lamas will have to be included in the process," Carter told ABC News "This Week" in a broadcast aired Sunday.

"Since returning to his alma mater a decade ago, John has been a valued voice on our cam­pus, throughout higher edueation and in the Church," Jenkins said. "He is held in the highest regard as a scholar and colleague here at Notre Dame and in the acade­my, and I am delighted that he has accepted our offer to lead Notre Dame's largest and oldest college." 
McGreevy joined the Notre Dame faculty in 1997 after serv­ing at Harvard University as the Dunwalke Associate Professor of American History and History and Literature. He has been chair of the Department of History at Notre Dame since 2002.

Am. Airlines returns jets to service 
DALLAS -American Airlines on Saturday received clearance from federal aviation offi­cials to return all of its 300 grounded jets to service, an airline spokesman said. 
After 200 cancellations Saturday morning, Fort Worth-based American was running a full schedule by the afternoon with no cancella­tions, said spokesman Charley Wilson. 
Starting Tuesday, th·3 nation's largest airline canceled nearly 3,300 flights, as it grounded 300 MD-80 jets to wrap wiring bundles to meet federal safety :;;tandards and prevent fires. 
The cancellations stranded hundreds of thousands of people during the week. 
American said 226 of its MD-80s were back in service by Friday morning. By noon on Saturday, the airline had received clearance to return all the remaining grounded jets to serv­ice, Wilson said. 
The groundings had come as a surprise. 
American officials said they thought they had the needed repair work completed two weeks ago when it scrubbed more than 400 flights, but the Federal Aviation Administration said the wiring still was not secured and stowed properly in wheel wells.

World Bank addresses food prices 
Zoellick urges governments to give U.N. World Food Program $500 million by May 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The president of the World Bank on Sunday urged immediate action to deal with mounting food prices that have caused hunger and deadly vio­lence in several coun­tries. 
Robert Zoellick said the international community has "to put our money where our mouth is" and act now to help hungry people. "It is as stark as that." 
He called on govern­ments to rapidly carry out commitments to pro­vide the U.N. World Food Program with $500 mil­lion in emergency aid it needs by May 1. 
"It is critical that gov­ernments confirm their commitments as soon as possible and others begin to commit," Zoellick said. Prices have only risen further since the WFP issued that appeal, so it is urgent that govern­ments step up, he said. 

After a meeting of the bank's policy-setting committee, Zoellick said that the fall of the gov­ernment in Haiti over the weekend after a wave of deadly rioting and loot­ing over food prices underscores the impor­understand others are "This is not just a that if they remain high tance of quick interna­looking to help." question of short term there will be dire conse­tional action.

Security, railroads impact immigration 
Associated Press 
AHHIAGA, Mexico -For thousands of illng<tl immigrants from Central America, the long journny to the U.S. starts here, on the groaning back of a fmight train they call The Beast. 
But these days many don't get too far. 
Central Americans without documents now face increased security within Mexico, includ­ing dwcks on the train for stow­aways. It's also harder for them to hnad north once they cross into Mexico because of hurri­cane damage to the train tracks. 
Tlin result: The number of non-Mexi<:an migrants stopped by the U.S. Border Patrol has dropped almost 60 percent from 2005, despite increasPd deten­tion ell'orts. About 68,000 non­Mexican migrants -mostly Central Americans -were detainnd last year, compared to 165,000 in 2005. Non-Mexicans make up about 10 percent of all migrants caught by Border Patrol ollicers. 
Mexico itself is also seeing fewer illegal immigrants ­120,000 were arrested last year, a 50 per­cent drop from 2005, when floors collapsed under the weight of freight, and 22 Salvadoran migrants drowned in an October shipwreck ofT the coast of southern Oaxaca state.

The long trek begins at the Suchiate river, on the border with Guatemala, where for $1 they cross on makeshil't rafts into sweltering jungles. 
Then they hike along the destroyed, sun-scorched train tracks to Arriaga for up to nine days. Arriaga, 200 miles from the Guatemalan border, is the closest place to hop a train since Hurricane Stan destroyed the Chiapas-Mayab line.

The slowdown in immigrant traffic is notable in Arriaga, a town of corn and sorghum farmers. Only a few dusters of Central American men and women linger around the most­ly abandoned, graffiti-covered train station, where they wait for the first train they can grab. Many stay at a local migrant shelter, watching television or sharing stories of abuse. 
Sitting on a eracked sidewalk outside the shelter, one Nicaraguan man told of the time he saw a group of crimi­nals gang-rape a woman and shoot her boyfriend. A llonduran couple talked of flee­ing their country after gang members killed their teenage daughter, and leaving their seven children, ages 18 to 1, in hiding. 
It doesn't get any easier once immigrants hop a train. They must oftnn bribe private guards and police stationed along the tracks. Many stowaways arc too tired to hold on to the train and 

Soldiers,citizens use alcohol detectors 
767 on Anny training post have personal devices in cars, on key chains 
Associated Press 

FOHT JACKSON, S.C. ­Hoping to save a life when an Army buddy's had too much to drink, 767 soldiers and civilians on the Army's largest training post now carry personal alcohol detectors in their cars or on their key chains. 
Fort Jackson's safety director Sean O'Brian has been handing out the four-inch devices since the first of the year. 
"It's a good way to not get into a confrontation with a buddy, in case they've been drinking," said Master Sgt. James Smith. "It's impartial. It lets you say, 'Hey, let's let this be our guide."' 
While there hasn't been a big problem with drunken driving on the base -there were 10 alcohol-related accidents in a recent 12-month span -that's still too many in O'Brian's opin­ion. 
Fort Jackson is one of eight Army installations that have begun using the pocket-sized detectors, base spokesman Pat Jones said. 
Staff Sgt. Tenesia Vann at fort Benning, Ga., said she grabbed half of dozen of the tiny breathalyzers when she first arrived at the base in January. 
"If I go to a gathering where people are drinking, I want to be able to hand them out. I think they could be a deciding factor in convincing people not to get behind the wheel," said the 35-year-old administrative assistant. "I keep them at home in case I have people over for a cookout." 
Fort Benning, home to multi­ple infantry units and the ser­vice's Airborne and Ranger 65,000 soldiers pass through training schools, got 155,000 of the gates annually. Luckily, the devices last May.

The Army, with more than 524,000 men and women on active duty, is the nation's largest military service. Besides Benning and Jackson, other installations trying out the detectors include Fort Lee, Va.; Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.; Fort Greely, Alaska; Fort Sam Houston and Corpus Christie Army Depot in Texas, and Fort Dix, N.J. 
In South Carolina, the detec­tors come amid a state legisla­tor's proposal that would allow members of the armed forces younger than 21 the right to buy alcohol even though it's in contrast to the military's efforts to diminish underage drinking and related accidents. 
Five years ago, there were 23 alcohol-related accidents at Fort Jackson, where 55,000 to

The detectors are not a self­diagnostic tool. They require a. buddy's help. 
Known as "Breathscan" tubes, they're carried inside the yellow plastic key fob designed for military use, said Patrice McMorrow, marketing director for Akers BioscienC'es Inc. in Thorofare, N.J., which pro­duces the devices. They aren't marketed directly to the public, she said, although some might be found for sale online. 
O'Brian, who is in charge of giving safety lectures to all new soldiers and the 4,400 civilian workers who come to Fort Jackson, got 2,500 of the devices to hand out along with information designed to punc­ture myths about drinking and driving. 
For example, he said, "Cofli~e doesn't make you sober. It just wakes you up. Another myth is that you know when you're too drunk to drive. You don't." 
That's where a friend with the tiny device comes in.

HAITI 
Nutriti1Dnal crisis threatens stability 
Anger over rising food prices leads to protests, ousting of politician 
Associated Press 
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -Aid organizations said Sunday they feared the nutritional crisis could deepen in impoveri!;hed Haiti, where skyrocketing food prices have already led to deadly protests and the ouster of the nation's No. 2 politician. 
With anger over food prices threatening the stability of this Caribbean nation already haunt­ed by chronic hunger, the U.N. World Food Program appealed for donations to meet its US$96 million ( 61 million) aid goal for Haiti. It has collected less than 15 percent of the annual budget goal. 
On Saturday, President Rene Preval announced subsidies to lower the price of rice and Haitian lawmakers fired Prime Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis for failing to boost food produc­tion. 
But aid workers said the meas­ures might not be eno 1gh to ease popular anger if hun:~er contin­ues to rise. 
Mamadou Mbaye, who heads the U.N. World Food Program's office in Haiti, said fixing Haiti's systemic problems like unem­ployment and dependence on imported food cannot be accom­plished immediately, and that means unrest could coatinue. 
"Some measures will generate results in the long term ... but whether people will be~ willing to wait for that is another issue," he said. 
Mbaye said the violence is hampering his agency's efforts to feed people. Children who used to depend on school-lunch pro­grams and adults who participate in work-for-food programs have been forced to stay home, bur­dening families, he said. 
Haiti imports almost all its food and global food prices have risen 40 percent since mid-2007. Locally, the prices of rice and pasta have doubled in parts of the capital of Haiti, a country where 2.4 million people already cannot afford the minimum daily calories recommended by the World Health Organization. 
On Saturday, Preval announced that international aid and local importers would work together to lower rice prices by 15 percent. 
A week of hunger-provoked protests and looting have already left six people dead, including a Nigerian officer with the 9,000­member U.N. police force who was pulled from a car and killed Saturday afternoon. Three Sri Lankan peacekeepers on patrol were injured by gunfire earlier in the week. 
Preval is mulling over candi­dates to replace Alexis as prime minister, while some Haitians speculate lawmakers could go after the president next. Sen. Youri Latortue told reporters that legislators would be prepared to consider a new prime minister on Monday. 
A lull in violence Sunday allowed residents to shop in mar­kets and attend church in the Haitian capital. U.N. peacekeep­ers reported no new violence or widespread protests. 
But aid workers said that volatile protests were likely to continue because of sustained high food prices in the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. 
As prices increase, desperation is spreading from the slums to Haiti's working poor, part of the impetus for this week's demon­strations, said Bill Canny of 
 Catholic Relief Services. 
Dumas Antenor, a 54-year-old father of 14, said just one can of rice costs a fifth of the US$4 
( 2.50) he earns on a good day loading group taxis in the hills above Port-au-Prince. 
"I hope that one day I'll see rice go back down at least 10 gourdes (26 cents; 16 euro cents) and I will be able to feed my kids at least two meals a day," he said. 
Canny said Catholic Relief Services continues to distribute food to tens of thousands of vul­nerable children, pregnant women and the sick. But the pro­gram will need more donations if hunger spreads to poor people with slightly higher incomes. 
"The international community has to work with the government to come together" to ease the hunger crisis, he said. 
AUSTRIA 



Official ca11cels 
meetingwith IAEA 
Associated Press 

VIENNA, Austria -A top Iranian official on Sunday abruptly canceled a meeting with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, dealing a blow to the 
U.N. monitor's efforts to investigate allegations that Iran tried to make nuclear arms, an agency official said. 
The IAEA official, confirm­ing Iranian media reports that Monday's planned meet­ing was off, told The Associated Press that no rea­son had been given. 
But a senior diplomat had told the AP that IAEA head Mohamed EIBaradei likely planned to use the meeting with Gholam Reza Aghazadeh, the head of Iran's nuclear program, to renew a request for more information on allegations Tehran had tried to make atomic arms. 
Both the official and the diplomat demanded anonymi­ty because they were not authorized t.o comment by name on the Iranian nuclear issue. 
Iran's official news agency, IRNA, reported Sunday that the talks between Aghazadeh and the U.N. nuclear watch­dog were postponed. There was no immediate explana­tion for the discrepancy. 
The diplomat, who follows IAEA attempts to clear up suspicions about Iran's nuclear aetivities, said the meeting also was likely to have focused on Iran's latest show of defiance of U.N. Security Council demands to suspend uranium enrichment. 
Last week, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced that his nation was installing thou­sands of new uranium-enrich­ing centrifuges and testing a much faster version of the device. 
Ahmadinejad said scientists were putting 6,000 new cen­trifuges into place, about twice the current number, and testing a new type that works five times faster. 
That would represent a major expansion of uranium enrichment -a process that can produce either fuel for a nuclear reactor or material for a warhead. 
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, however, cautioned th.e claim could not be jmmediately substaJ;Itiated, and diplomats close to the IAEA said Iran has exaggerat­ed its progress and experi­enced problems operating the 3,000 centrifuges already in place.

The value of college 
We should all feel lucky to be in col­lege. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, just under 30 percent of the adult American population holds a bachelor's degree or more. Yet that elite 30 percent

ma, and those with advanced degrees, four times as much. The Institute for Higher Education Policy, meanwhile, reported that college graduates enjoy higher levels of saving, increased personal and professional mobility, improved quality of life for their offspring, bet­ter consumer decision making and more leisure time. Economically spmtking, a college degree is a good thing. 
But there is something odd about reducing a bachelor's degree to mere numbers. Are such statistics supposed to reassure those studying toward degrees that they lor their parents) made the right choiee or arc they sup­posed to be an incentive l'or those who are thinking of not going to college at all'? And what does it say that these institutions arc describing the whole of college experience in terms of future salaries'? After all, according to these two institutions, the university is nothing more than a means to a voca­tional end -a monetary leg up and nothing else. And because the univer­sity apparently has to justify itself in terms of the market, it suggests that a bachelor's degree has no intrinsic worth outside of its economic value. 
Maybe it doesn't. It's hard to break the liberal arts curriculum down into something as punchy as a cosVbenefit analysis. Of course, the liberal arts are supposed to impart eritical think­ing skills, general knowledge, aesthet­ic sensibilities and the like, to create a "complete" person. All of these things sound good but are hard to measure or define. More importa:ntly, all of these things are becoming less and less valuable in the real world, or at least in the working world, which for the most part values compliance, punctuality and el'ficiency as much as (if not over) creativity and critical thought. If you need some critical thinking, you can turn to the glut of analysts and GOmmentators, who can reduce even the most complicated ideas or events into a sound byte or, even better, a smug one-liner. And where are you going to use your gen­eral knowledge exeept at, say, trivia night at your local bar'? 

In one of J.D. Salinger's short sto­ries, a character complains, "You never even hear any hints dropped on a campus that wisdom is supposed to be the goal of knowledge. You hardly ever even hear the word 'wisdom' mentioned!" And in a sense, that's true. No matter what goes on the cur­riculum. uni.versities are, for the most part, designed to impart knowledge. Even the most advanced classes, whether in the sciences or the human­ities, teach you mostly knowledge: facts, theories, arguments and so on. Wisdom, on the other hand, is purely internal. Maybe it results from broad­ening your intellectual capacity through intense study of everything from history to physics to music or maybe you ean get it just from reading Plato, Augustine or Nietzsche. What the liberal arts eurriculum ultimately does, I think, is place you in contact with so many products of the human experience that you are as likely as not to lind some small thing that makns you think. But most important­ly, wisdom is something that can't really be taught. It's something wholly personal and that makes it something immeasurable, unalienable from the individual; something that can't, in short, be measured in dollars, leisure time or quite possibly by any rubric at all. 
And that is both the achievement and the drawback of a liberal arts education. It can makn you start along the path to wisdom, but it can't explain how. or why, or even guaran­tee that it will happnn. Aftnr college you'll probably never be in such an intellectually rich environment again and you may very wnll be working in a place where knowledge, wisdom and much else of what you learn in collnge is secondary to pure productivity. Any further personal growth is entirely up to you. 
So in the end, because we are at a university where the liberal arts are still an integral part of' the curricu­lum, we arc indeed lucky-and maybe not just for our future pay­checks.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR A._ person's a person no matter how small or great the disability 
During my time as a student at Notre Dame I worked at Logan Center with many severely disabled adults like Terri Schindler-Schiavo and Lauren Marie Hichardson. These extraordinary human beings had more life and love in them than many other non-dis­abled human beings I have met. There was one client I assisted at Logan, !'or example, who could neither walk nor talk-although he could make noises. He could not see much but he could hear. His name was Royce and he adored me. He knew my voice, he would squeeze my fingers so tight I couldn't move them when I would give him my hand, he would get this huge smile on hLs face when the other caretakers told him "Laura is coming today" -he knew my name. He would also sing (in his own way of course) the Notre Dame Fight Song when we would tell him to. 
The problem is not the disabilities of those with severe disabilities like Terri Schindler-Schiavo or Lauren Marie Richardson. The real "disability" is the fact that by continuing to advocate a "quality of life" mentality society improperly puts a value on the lives of people with disabilities as being nothing based on what they cannot do. As a person with a disability myself, I cannot imagine someone deciding my life is not valuable because I cannot do something or that I have to do something differently. I am a person, not my disability. We must use our voices to advocate for 
Re-rethinking aclohol consumption 

Don't get me wrong. I love Notre Dame with every fiber of my being but the pretentiousness and sanctimo­ny being spewed by some Notre Dame students with regards to alcohol corsumption make me sad to call them my peers. I don't care if you drink alcohol. Maybe you just don't like the taste or you happen to dislike the post-drinking side effects. But just because you do not drink does not give you any acceptable reason to thumb your nose at those who do or look down at us beer drinkers from your imaginary pedestal. 
I have met some extraordinary people here at this uni­versity and a lot of thfm drink something other than soda or Cabernets. And maybe some of these outstand­ing people I've encountered consume too many cold bev­erages on the weekend but you know what; it's called being a 19-year-old and being in college. This is the last four years (make that two) of my life to occasionally make questionable decisions and just be ridiculous. 
Now don't get me wrong, I abhor those drinkers who let alcohol lead them to being violent, abusive, and non­responsive but that's why you surround yourself with friends who will look out for you even when you're stumbling down Notre Dame Ave. after a house party. 
I'm sure I speak for a large group of people when I say that most students at this university have encircled themselves within a group of friends that genuinely care not only about each other, but more importantly, each other's well-being. Alcohol consumption is only a prob­lem when you either drink by yourself (and in that case have serious problems) or hang out with a group of peo­ple who are terrible human beings and have no regard for your personal safety. I'm going to make a bold pre­diction that the majority fall into the first group. 
So Daniel Cerrone, Ryan Slaney and all you other con­descending Notre Dame students, I am not asking you to become pro-drinking. Instead, I am asking you to realize that not only are you not more intellectual and moral for not consuming alcohol but that you also need to lighten up and allow others to enjoy their college years. But seriously guys (and girls), go grab a Keystone Light and enjoy the nectar of the Gods. 
Tim Lang sophomore O'Neill Hall Apr. 8 

'Why stop at alcohol? 

I commend Ryan Slaney (Alcohol: Enemy of academic and moral development," Apr. 10) for his insightful and well-researched indictment of the dangers of alcohol con­sumption. I would, however, like to expand upon his vision, which I feel to be sadly restricted. The physical and spiri­tual harm alcohol brings to our student community is obvi­ous but there lurks a more insidious threat to our personal and moral integrity. It lurks within every residence hall, perhaps even your own dorm room and it'> usage is com­pletely unrestricted by Our Lady's University. Yes, I am talking about television. According to some motivational poster I saw at my old high school, sitting on the couch and watching television day after day not only makes you really, really boring, but also affects your health by impair­ing your vision and encouraging weight gain. You would be much better off going outside for a jog, or at the very least a brisk walk about the block to meet the neighbors whose dinner party you blew off last week so you could watch "30 Rock" and "The Office." 
What's more, long-te ·m addiction to prime time televi­sion shows can negativ3ly impact a person's intellectual lite. I have seen this happening at Notre Dame since I was a freshman -walking down my hallway at 8 p.m. of a Thursday night, my ears were assailed with the inanity of "California" coming from all directions. Today, I know peo­ple who skip homework, put off papers and ditch group project meetings just sc, they can catch all of their week­night line-up. I lind it d'lplorable that the administration has exacerbated this problem by granting dorm-wide cable access. Do they want student'> to fail? 
Then are some who may try to argue that watching tel­evision is a purdy pPrs' mal choice, or that its impact is not nearly as detrimental as I'm making it out to be. To them I say that the e(fect'i of tdevision, like those of other drugs, can only worsen with increased exposure, and never stay limited to the user. Cou 1tless silent victims have their stud­ies interrupted when their neighbors gather next door for a session of collective IQ-Iowering with America's Next Top Model at full blast. Innocent bystanders and their property become compromised when someone's attempt at publicly replicating a Jacka** stunt inevitably goes awry. The Catholic character of this university is itself under constant assault from the day-to-day influx of television programs promoting sexually promiscuous attitudes, the objectifica­tion and degradation of women and the gay agenda. 
Let us not also forget that television watching frequently goes hand-in-hand with that other vehicle of both mental and moral impairment: alcohol. A group of students gath­ered in a dorm room watching SportsCenter are far more likely to be engaged in irresponsible drinking (which, as we all know, is the only kind of drinking) than a group of students occupying their time with wholesome and enrich­ing Bible study. 
Now, I'm not denying that television can have its proper place and time. I myself was responsibly introduced to tel­evision by my grandmother when I reached an appropri­ate age and spent many summers at grandma's house enjoying the chaste pleasures of Mother Angelica's Eternal Word Television Network. I only wish that other students had been so fortunate as to have the support and guidance ofloving family members during their first experiences with television. However, it is obvious to me that the stu­dent body lacks both the maturity and the moral fiber to resist television's many sultry temptations. It is therefore the duty of the administration to give our Notre Dame Family proper guidance by prohibiting the use of televi­sion.

all people with disabilities, especially those who are unable to advocate for themselves due to their dis­abilities. We must remember Terri Schindler-Schiavo and the inhumane treatment she suffered as a person with a severe disability to the point of death. We must support the life of Lauren Marie Richardson so that another disabled person is not the victim of the "dis­ability" of the "quality of life" mentality. A person is a person no matter how small or grea.t the disability.

Sponsor an alcoh()l practicum 
I would like to add to Bill Nolan's Apr. 11 
response ("Alcohol in the 'Real World"') to Ryan Slaney ("Alcohol: Enemy of academic and moral development," Apr. 10) concerning Notre Dame alcohol policy. I agree that outlawing alcohol on . campus would be a serious mistake for students 
to develop as balanced, responsible human 
beings. The University should take an active role 
in making sure its students can swim socially 
after they leave. My main concer1 comes from 
outside the bubble. 
At a recent medical school interview, I sat 
through a H)-minute rant about how Notre Dame 
students do not understand the r1~al world when 
they get into it because they "live in a fantasy 
land." My interviewer firmly believes that Notre 
Dame students are not immediatdy ready for 
reality after graduation because 1;hey have not 
experienced it in at least four years. The fact is 
that there is alcohol in the real world and it is a 
scary proposition that Notre Dame students might 
have to figure out alcohol moderation once they 
leave. 

A better suggestion than outlawing alcohol: 
Notre Dame should sponsor a series of student­
run events that focus on alcohol culture for its 
other ingredients. Wine-tastings. A history of beer 
with free samples. What is in a martini? What are 
acceptable drinks in the business world? What 
message do I send my boss when I order a "sex on 
the beach?" Those experienced in these areas can 
show us how to be social in the real world and be 
realistic. Aleohol is a social force in our culture 
and it would be a shame if Notre Dame did not 
acknowledge graduates' inevitable interaction 
with, you know, everybody else.

NFL 
Associated Press 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. ­Suspended Tennessee Titans cornerback Adam "Pacman" Jones will again ask NFL commis­sioner Roger Goodell to reinstate him, with his agent planning to send in his latest request on Tuesday. 
Jones had planned to ask to be reinstated before the NFL draft on April 26-27. His agent, Manny Arora, said that being able to work out for teams would increase Jones' appeal to those in the market for a corner­back. 
"We were hoping some-thing would get worked out with the Titans or another team to work out a trade, but the trade talks, the way I read, aren't progressing as well as we hoped," Arora said on Saturday. "If the com­missioner reinstates or grants permission to work out at a team's facility, that should ease the risk factor for a team interest­ed in picking him up." 


The NFL sent Jones a letter in late February telling him he could not work out at the Titan's facility. The Titans have given Jones permission to talk to other teams about a trade, and the Dallas Cowboys have shown the most interest. But the talks reportedly have bogged down over com­pensation. 
Arora said they still hope Jones will be traded before the draft, and they are ready to rework his contract. 
Arora also said that if they can't get Jones rein­stated they hope to at least ease the terms of his suspension, now going on more than a year, to make him more attrac­tive.

U.S. Women's soccer team 
qualifies to Beijing Olympics 
CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico -Nicole Barnhart made a diving save on Brittany Timko's penalty kick to give the United States a 6-5 shootout victory over Canada on Saturday night in the CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifying final. 
The United States won the shootout after the teams finished regulation play tied 0-0, and 30 extra minutes tied 1-1. 
Barnhart stopped Timko after Heather O'Reilly gave the United States the lead. Carli Lloyd, Leslie Osborne, Abby Wambach, Angela Hucles and Christie Rampone also scored for the Americans in the tiebreaker. Kara Lang, Rhian Wilkinson, Christine Sinclair and Melissa Tancredi and Clare Rustad scored for Canada in the shoo tout. 
Lloyd opened the scoring for the United States on a free kick in the 11Oth minute, but Tancredi tied it on a header in the 118th minute. 

Olympic torch makes one 
ani:l only trip to Africa 
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania -About 1,000 people cheered and marched wi1h a team of 80 athletes and a Cabinet minister participating Sunday in the Tanzania leg of the Olympic torch relay, the flame's only stop inAfrica. 
Officials have said that they do not expect any of the disruptions that have hit other torch runs in the world. Kenyan Nobel Peace laureate Wangari Maathai, however, pulled out of the relay in Tanzania to protest Orina's human rights record. 
Vice President Ali Mohamed Shein lit the Olympic torch, passing it on to Cabinet minister Mohamed Seif Khatib, who led the relay team from the city's main train station the main stadium, about three miles away. 
The crowd that marched behind the relay team waved miniature Olympic flags and chanted in the national language Kiswabili, 'We are happy the torch came to Tanzania," and 'We are glad to receive it.

in 2005 and 2006. 
Goodell suspended him on April 10, 2007, for his off-field conduct, which now includes six arrests since being drafted. 
Jones settled the last of his criminal charges on Feb. 14 by entering an Alford plea to obstruction of a police officer in Georgia, which left him with a felony conviction. Under an Alford plea, a defendant acknowledges there is enough evidence for a conviction without admitting guilt. 
The commissioner has said he'll consider rein­stating the cornerback before training camps open in July. 

Antonio Tarver wins light
heaveyweight title bout 
TAMPA, Fla. -Antonio Tarver climbed into the ring with one light heavyweight title Saturday night. He departed with two championship belts and a roaring crowd behind him. Tarver handily defeated Clinton Woods with a unanimous 12-round decision to retain his lightly regarded lBO crown and seize the IBF title from his British foe. 
Tarver (27 -4, 19 KOs) thrilled his hometown fans by rocking Woods with a solid left jab to the head in the 11th round. The Tampa resident carried the momentum into the fmal round, then thrust his hands upward at the final bell as Woods dropped his head and returned to his corner. 
Judge Howard Foster scored the bout 119-109 for Tarver. John Rupert had it 117-111, and Steve Marshall called it 116-112. 
Tarver immediately turned his attention to the future.

Irish excel at tvvo invites over vveekend 
By EUGENIA ALFONZO Sporrs Writer 
Notre Dame sent athletes to 

two events this weekend but 
had enough strong marks in 
the Spartan and Ole Miss 
lnvitationals to make it seem 
like a full Irish squad compet­
ed in each. 
Freshman Alex Gannon started things off at the Spartan Invitational Saturday with a seventh-place time of 
11.93 seconds in the tOO­meter dash. Freshman Justin Schneider followed in the men's 200-meter dash with an 11th place finish of 23.09. SchneidtH, one of the top decathlon runners of the Big East, also earned top marks in the 11 0-meter hurdles and long jump. He linished in lifth place in the hurdle event and fourth in the long jump. 
Freshman Hyan Gamboa also scored some points for the Irish in the middle distance race. He placed fourth with a time of 1:56.39 after a close finish at the end of the race -Gamboa finished .02 ahead of Central Michigan's Nick Agosti. 
The Irish placed three com­petitors in the top 10 in the pole vault competition. Sophomore Matt Schipper fin­ished first with a height of 4.90-meters, while sophomore Jim Merchun finished in a three-way tie for fourth with a height of 4.60-mllters. 
"So far it has been [a good! season, and I have already qualified for outdoor regionals, but now I need to prepare for a good finish at Hegionals," Schipper said. 
Junior Brian Mahon followed close behind Schipper and Mercun with another three­way tie for seventh place with a height of 4.45-meters. 
In the Ole Miss Invitational, freshman Miklos Szebeny fin­ished in seventh place in the 100-dash with a time of 10.82 seeonds. In another sprint event, the 400-hurdles, senior Austin Wechter linished eighth with a time of 54.39 seconds. 
"I was not too happy with my performance this past week­end, I know I can do better," Wechter said. "I would defi­nitely like to improve on my personal best, that's my major goal." 
Junior Kevin McFadden and freshman Spencer Carter kept up the team's strong showing, finishing fifth and tenth respectively in the 1500-meter run. 
The Irish also did well in the field events. Junior Blair Majcina dominated his compe­tition by four inches in the high jump, finishing first and not far from an NCAA regional qualifi­cation. Majcina comes into the outdoor season after recover­ing from an injury in the fall. 
"The outdoor season has just started. I have given a couple of mediocre performances, but it has given me a chance to make some much needed adjustments to my approach and jumping form" Majcina said. "It is a work in progress because I am coming back from a torn patella tendon in the fall." 
Sophomore Eric Quick kept up the momentum from his double NCAA regional qualifi­cations in the long and triple jump, placing third in the triple jump. 
Brandon Denon narrowly 
qualified  fur  the  NCAA  
Hegional  meet  in  May  by  
throwing  the  discus  52.37  

meters. Denon's effort was good for second place, a full two meters better than the third-place finisher. 
The freshman trio of Denes Veres, John Belcher and Greg Davis placed fourth, seventh, and 14th respectively in the shot put. Belcher also placed in the discus throw, earning seventh place with a throw of 
47.14 meters. Davis and Veres also participated in the ham­mer throw, throwing 50.68 meters and 47.83 for sixth and tenth place respectively. 
The next meets for the Irish are next weekend at the Central Collegiate Championships and the Mount SAC Belays.

Doubles improves in win 
Struggling squad gains confidence in win over conference team 
By MEAGHAN VESELIK Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's recorded its second MIAA win Saturday with an 8-1 victory over Tri-State, improving the Belles' record to 6-9 over­all and 2-3 in MIAA play. The Thunder fell to 3-9 overall and 0-6 in the MIAA. 
"We played pretty well overall," Saint Mary's coach Chuck Rubino said. "Tri-State was a pretty decent squad, better than I expected them to be. We showed a strong team effort." 
Saint Mary's had been struggling in doubles com­petition this season, but it didn't show on Saturday. The Belles won two out of the three doubles matches behind the leadership of the No. 1 doubles duo of sophomore co-captain Camille Gebert and fresh­man Jillian Hurley. Gebert and Hurley defeated Tri­State's Amanda Waidely and Dana Dunham 8-1 for their seventh win of the season, moving their record to 7-8. 
The Belles No. 2 doubles pair of sophomore co-cap­tain Lisa Rubino and fresh­man Betsy Reed was defeated by Kara Kauffman and Amanda Steiner 8-5, putting the Belles duo at 5­8 for the season. Freshmen Franca Peluso and Jessica 
Kosinski won 8-5 over Stephanie Steiner and Jen Wall to help win the dou­bles portion for Saint Mary's. 
The Belles momentum from doubles carried over to the singles as they swept that part of the match. In the No. 1 slot, Gebert defeated Stephanie Steiner 6-1, 6-1 for her seventh matches." 
Up next for Saint Mary's is a week full of matches, including three at home. Tuesday the Belles will host Bethel for a cross town rivalry match at 4 p.m. Saint Mary's will play against conference rivals Adrian on Thursday, and Kalamazoo on Saturday. The Belles will finish off the

Runners unable to 
qualify for regionals 
By ALEX BARKER Sports Writer 
Notre Dame achieV·3d mild success this weekend in the Spartan and Mis~.issippi lnvitationals, but failed to cap­italize on the good weather by not setting an NCAA regional qualifying mark in any event. 
Freshmen Natalie Johnson and Kelly Langhans led the way for the Irish at the very competitive Mississippi Invitational in Oxford, Miss. The duo took first and second, respectively, in the 800-meter run. but fell short of a regional qualifying mark by about four seconds. 
Sophomore Joanna Schultz and Senior Brienne Davis ran well in the 200, taking fourth and fifth, respectively. Davis also continued her string of good finishes in the 100 dash, taking third place in the event and missing an NCAA qualify­irtg mark by less than a quar­ter of a second. 
In the field events,. the Irish sent only two athletes to com­pete and both came away with excellent finishes. 
Sophomore Elise Knutzen took third place in the javelin while Junior Alyissa Hasan grabbed sixth in the high jump. 
At Michigan State's ~;partan Invitational, the Irish logged a number of quality finisLes. 
In the 5000-distanc El race, junior Heidi Rocha took first place for the Irish with senior Amy Kohlmeier finishing right behind her in second. Senior Ann Mazur and sophomore Beth Tacl took fifth and sixth, respectively, to round out a strong Irish performance in the event. 
In the 3000-meter steeple­chase, sophomore Lindsey Ferguson and junior Becca Bauman ran away from the competition, easily taking first and second, respectively. 
Sophomore Jaime Minor had a standout meet for Irish, placing well in a variety of events. Minor took second in the triple jump to go along with two seventh-place finish­es in the 100-and 200-meter dashes. 
In the field events, junior Anna Weber continued her dominance of the throwing events while several other Irish athletes posted solid results. 
Weber blew away the com­petition as she took first in the shot put by almost a meter and finished a close second in the hammer throw. 
Freshman jumper Jessica Sullivan tied for second place in the pole vault and Jasmine Williams finished fourth in the long jump, rounding out a dominant Irish performance in the field events. 
Next weekend, Notre Dame will send athletes to the Central Collegiate Championships in West Lafayette, Ind., and the Mount SAC relays in Walnut, Calif., both of which are three-day meets.

Immelman wins Masters 
28-year old wins first major tournament four months after surgery 
Associated Press 

AUGUSTA, Ga. -Trevor Immelman has never felt bet­ter. 
Four months after he had a tumor removed from his back, Immelman handled the wind and pressure of Augusta National far better than any­one chasing him Sunday to win the Masters, the first South African in a green jack­et in 30 years. 
Immelman held it together around Amen Corner and stretched his lead to as many as six shots on the back nine, taking the life out of a Masters that began with so much hype. 
A two-putt par on the final hole gave him a 3-over 75, matching the highest final . round by a Masters champi­on. Even so, it was good enough for a three-shot victo­ry over Tiger Woods, whose hopes for a calendar Grand Slam ended with a tbud. 
Woods never got within five shots of the lead when he was on the course, twice missed birdie putts inside 8 feet and had to settle for a 72 and his second consecutive runner-up finish in the Masters. 
"I learned my lesson there with the press," Woods said with a smile. He was the one who started the talk about a Grand Slam by stating three months ago that winning all four majors in the same year was "easily within reason." 
The only slam possibilities now belong to Immelman; a 28-year-old with a polished swing, who finally realized his potential in the wicked wind of Augusta and a final round that yielded only four rounds under par. 

Immelman, who finished at 8-under 280, started the week by playing a practice round with his boyhood idol, Gary Player, who won his third Masters in 1978 and set a record by playing for the 51st time. 
Player told Immelman he was good enough to win the green jacket, and he left him a voicemail Saturday night that Immelman played on his speaker phone for his family to hear. The message: "I know you're going to win." 
"He's been on me all week, telling me to believe in myself," Immelman said. "He also told me to keep my head still on putts. It's really a spe­cial moment, and I'm glad I pulled it through for him." 
Reached by telephone in Abu Dhabi, Player told his assistant: "I am so proud of Trevor. What a thrill it was to see him come back from major surgery and beat Tiger. I can't wait to see him and shake his hand personally." 
Immelman's wife, Carminita, and their 1-year­old son were waiting for him behind the green. Jacob took hold of the 18th flag, fussing when he couldn't go into the scoring shack to be with his father. 
Immelman's parents also were there to greet him with hugs. His father, Johan, is the former commissioner of the Sunshine Tour in South Africa. 
"It's his moment, not mine," said the father, who waved away a reporter. 
No one doubted he was capable of winning a major, but maybe not this one. Only four months ago, doctors dis­covered a tumor in his diaphragm that required sur­gery through his back to remove it. The tumor was benign and the recovery was quick, even though it took him two months to get his game back in shape. 
The recovery hit warp speed this week at Augusta, where Immelman had only broken par once in his five previous Masters. 
"This has been the ultimate roller-coaster ride, and I hate roller coasters," Immelman said. "I win the Nedbank Challenge in South Africa, and a week later I'm having an operation to remove a tumor.... I felt like I had to start from zero again. Here I am after missing the cut last week. 

"Masters champion -it's the craziest thing I've ever heard of." 
Immelman built a two-shot lead with three rounds in the 60s, and held it together dur­ing a few nervy moments. 
He made a 10-foot par save from the bunker at No. 9 to keep a two-shot cushion, but continued to look shaky. Immelman missed the 11th green well to the right when his chip didn't quite reach and he was left with a 20-foot putt that was slick and dan­gerous. 
Ahead of him, Woods was gaining momentum. 
Woods holed a 70-foot birdie putt on the 11th, made an acrobatic escape from the trees on the 13th and spun a wedge down the slope on the par-5 13th that left him 5 feet away for birdie. 
lmmelman holed his par putt. Woods missed, just as he has done the last two years on the back nine of a major he once dominated. Brandt Snedeker and Steve Flesch, the last two players with any hope, folded quickly. 
Woods closed with a 72 and has finished 3-2-2 in his last three Masters. It also was his fifth runner-up in a major. 
Immelman earned $1.35 million for his second PGA Tour victory, with Woods also finishing second behind him two years ago in the Western Open. 
"I was trying to be tough out there," Immelman said. "There's a disaster around every corner." 
Emotions were running wild for all the contenders, none more than Snedeker, who tied for third with Stewart Cink. The 27-year­old American with Huck Finn looks and a constant smile made only six pars in his round of 77, tying for the lead with an eagle on the second hole but stumbling badly the rest of the way. 
"I went from extreme highs to extreme lows, and that's what you don't want to do around here," Snedeker said.

Team opens new field by going 1-1 
By JARED ]EDICK Sports Writer 
The Irish earned a split to open up newly constructed Melissa Cook Stadium in this weekend's double-header against Villanova. The Irish lost the first game 4-1 and winning the second 10-5. 
The win was Notre Dame's 200th all-time regular sea­son victory in the Big East conference, bringing its record to 200-32 in Big East play. 

Saturday's intended stadi­um-opener double-header against Rutgers was can­celled due to rain. Those games have been resched­uled for 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. Observer today at Melissa Cook Freshman catcher Sadie Pitzenberger slides during Notre Stadium. Dame's 2-1 win over Toledo on Apr. 2.

was an assistant under Irish head coach Mike Brey, who said Cross was an instrumen­tal part of the team's success over that span. 
"He has done a fabulous job here for us at Notre Dame," Brey said in a press release. " ... The Notre Dame basket­ball family is going to miss Gene and we wish him noth­ing but the best as he embarks on this exceptional opportunity." 
Cross came to Notre Dame after spending six seasons at Illinois-Chicago, three sea­sons at DePaul, and one sea­son at Virginia.

fence, bringing in three runs. 
"That was our first really hard hit ground ball of the day," Gumpf said. "Kohan came up with a big hit when we needed it and that lifted us up a little bit." 
Notre Dame added more in the fourth, with six runners crossing the plate for the Irish. The team batted around, with freshman Erin Marrone getting a clutch two-out hit. 
"They walked [Kohan] to get to Marrone and she did exactly what we needed her to do," Gumpf said. "That was.. the biggest hit of the day. 
The Irish added an insur­ance run in the sixth on a Villanova error that scored sophomore utility player Christine Lux from third. 
Freshman Jody Valdivia started the second game but was pulled after 1-and-1/3 innings after giving up six hits and four earned runs in favor of Bargar. Bargar stepped up and allowed only one more run for the remain­der of the game. 
"Bargar and Valdivia have been picking each other up all year," Gumpf said. "They both know that the other will keep on fighting and rebound from bad outings." 
The Irish have a full docket of games this week, starting with the makeup double­header against Rutgers today at 11 a.m. at Melissa Cook Stadium before traveling to Evanston, Illinios, to take on Northwestern Tuesday. The Irish will then come back home on Wednesday for a game against Wisconsin at 4 p.m.

Opening ceremonies were conducted on Saturday despite the pouring rain and featured remarks from ath­letic director Dr. Kevin White, coach Deanna Gumpf, 

senior captain Katie Laing, Lisa Hoffman, and Paul and Lisa Demo, the parents of Melissa Cook. The site was officially blessed and dedi­cated by University president Fr. John Jenkins. 
"The ceremonies were per­fect," Gumpf said. "It was exciting and we truly appre­ciated it." 
However, the celebration ended quickly for the Irish (25-11, 6-2 Big East), who were out-played in all facets of the game Gumpf said in their 4-1 loss to the Wildcats (15-17-1, 4-8 Big East). 
"They out-pitched us and the out-hit us," Gumpf said. "When you get out-played like that, you cannot really expect to have a chance to win the game." 
The Wildcats jumped on the Irish early, putting three runs on the board in the sec­ond inning against junior Brittney Bargar (18-7). Bargar was charged with the loss, giving up four runs on eight hits and striking out seven. 
The Irish bats were also cold in the first game, with their only run coming in the bottom of the first. Laing notched the first hit in the new stadium with her RBI single to knock in freshman Katie Fleury. 
"[Villanova] pitcher [junior Laura Determan] did a great job for them today," Gumpf said. "She was in a lot of pressure situations and she was able to work out of it."

the puek," Irish dnfenseman Kyle Lawson said. "That's kind of our bread and butter and when they neutralized that and got it into an up-tempo game, that's when their speed took over." 
Gerbe, a 5-foot-5 junior, proved an unstoppable force, generating four points on the night and 11 points in the Tournament (7 goals, 4 assists}. (;erbe s1:ored Boston College's first two goals of the night and assisted on his team's l'inal, back-breaking two goals. 
Boston College was the national runner-up each of the last two seasons. Last year it lost 3-1 to Michigan State and fell 2-1 to Wisconsin in 2006. 
It was Notro Dame's first trip to the Frozen Four. let alone the title gamn. The Irish earned a shot at the titl11 by defeating top­seeded Michigan 5-4 in over­time two days earlier. 
"I thought IBoston College! had us on our heels early on with their spePd and I was a lit­tle bit surprised that our team played a little too cautious," Irish coach Jell' Jackson said. "II was al little disappointed in the fact that I thought our team eould have made some plays, and we didn't. First time being in this event. I think the advan­tage was theirs as far as the experience factor beeause our guys rosponded to that situa­tion." 
Aller Boston College built a 3­0 lead -all in the seeond peri­od -Notr11 Dame staged a eonwback. Irish center Kevin Deeth placed the puck over 
-Muse's glove side off a pass from Lawson through the slot to the left sido at 9:07 of the sec­ond. The Irish appnared to cut the score to :~-2 at the 4:56 mark of tho third period when Lawson caught defenseman Ian Cole's crossover pass in his skates and tho puck slowly slid across the goal line as Lawson sought unsuccessfully to tap it with his stick. The play was reviewed in the booth and the goal was recalled by video· replay ollieial Greg Shepherd. "The puck was kicked in the net by the Notre Dame player's right skate. The skate was mov­ing toward the goal line," Shepherd said. "There were sticks in the crease, and we needed to make sure there was­n't a dolleetion ofT tho sticks or tho defender's skates after it was kicked." Irish coach .lefT Jackson said the disallowed goal was the turning point in the game. "I thought we had something going at that timf! and I thought we were doing a much better job with the puck," he said. "I talked to our guys about show­ing some poise with the puck because I snnsed a level of panic at times with the puck." Both teams had a tightly­matched first period, resulting in the fourth scoreless opening in a title gamn in NCAA history. The Irish had three power play opportunities during the pnriod, but couldn't capitalize on tho opportunities. Notre Dame had eight power play chances throughout the gam11, but couldn't score, a problem that plagued the Irish for extended periods of time throughout the season. "I think we had a couple of good looks, but you have to give credit to their penalty killers and their goalie made some big saves on the penalty kill," senior captain Mark Van Guilder said. "I think that was the key to the 
game, their power play was effective and ours weren't." 
The Eagles, however, were much more effective against Notre Dame's penalty-kill unit, the second best in the nation. Boston College went 2-for-4 on power plays. 
Gerbe broke the offensive silence in the second period with a goal at 2:23, beginning a 3-0 Eagles run. 
From behind the Irish net, freshman center Brian Gibbons sent a backhand pass to Gerbe in the left circle, who shot the puck over junior goaltender Jordan Pearce's left shoulder. 
Gerbe struck again a little more than three minutes later after an interference penalty was called on Irish left wing Hyan Thang. Eagles right wing Ben Smith sent a crossover pass toward the goal. Hicocheting off the net, Gerbe crashed the rebound and scored, tapping the puck inside the near post and giving Boston College a 2-0 lead. 
"I just try and do it with my grit and speed," Gerbe said about how he makes up for his size. "You've got to use your strengths and not your weak­nesses. Obviously I'm not big, so I'm not going to go plowing someone over, but I still finish checks and bug people out there." 

At the 8:11 of the second and working with a 4-on-3 man advantage, Gerbe sent a cross­ing pass to freshman forward Joe Whitney high in the slot, whose slap shot deflected off an Irish defenseman and past Pearce's left side, giving the Eagles the 3-0 lead. 
After Lawson's goal in the third was overturned, Boston College answered with a goal less than a minute later. 
Gerbe sent a blind pass to Smith inside the right circle, whose shot deflected off Irish del'enseman Brock Sheahan and into the net for the 4-1 lead at 
5:31 ofthe third. 

"Gerbe and Ben Smith are just so good," linemate Brian Gibbons said. ''I'm so lucky to play with those guys as good as they are. I just try to stay out of their way."

score for the remainder of the game. 
Pearce made 19 save for the Irish, while Muse stopped 20 for the Eagles. Muse, a freshman who started every game for Boston College this season, allowed only two goals in the two games of the Frozen Four. 
"(Muse] was awesome tonight. It's pretty special for a freshman to do something like that," Van Guilder said. "His team played awesome in front of him, and he made some big saves." 
The Irish will lose live seniors after this year -Van Guild.er, Sheahan. Evan Hankin, Dan VeNard and Brian D'Arcy ­who were the last class to play a season not under Jackson, when they played for former coach Dave Poulin as freshmen. 
"Bottom line is that these kids gave us everything they could in the last couple weeks and I'm proud of them," Jackson said.

"Notre Dame and Jeff .Jackson remind me a lot of our team in 1998. We were just starting to pick up the pieces and all of a sudden we're in the Frozen Four playing the University of Michigan," York said. 
"That got us over the mmp and back at the national level. Notre Dame is at that point now; they've reached the national championship game. They're going to be one of those brand name schools in hockey." 
The Frozen Four introduced Notre Dame fans that had rarely looked beyond th~ foot­ball stadium or basketball court to Irish hockey. Notre Dame clubs around the coun­try organized game watches and the keyboards of national sports writers tapped out the names of Mark Van Guilder, Jordan Pearce, Ryan Thang and more, continuously. 
Notre Dame football coach Charlie Weis took a day away during spring football practice to watch the title game in Denver, rooting on his friend Jeff Jackson. 
Irish hockey had earned the respect of the world beyond college hockey. 
Outside the locker room Saturday after the loss, University president Fr. John Jenkins stood quietly for a long time, his head down, eyes closed and fingers pinching the bridge of his nose. Members of the athletic department milled around, stunned, no one breaking the silence. 
It was etched on everyone's face, Notre Dame couldn't have lost. The team had come too far, worked too hard, got­ten people too excited to have lost when the NCAA trophy was right there, 100 yards down the arena corridor but now wearing an Eagles hat. 
But in that sadness was the beauty of what Notre Dame hockey has become. It's a win­ner. 
A loss is devastating, not the expected end to every season anymore; a national title now no longer the crazy dream of the Irish players and coaches who set about inventing three years ago what "The Gold Standard" of Notre Dame hockey meant. 
One inch could have changed a lot Saturday night, but Notre Dame has already come so many thousands more.

Notre Dame sweeps another weekend series 
By FRAN TOLAN A'sociatc Sports Ediror 

The Irish again showed their witch-like penchant for the broomstick with a sweep of Villanova this weekend. 
Notre Dame has now swept thrne of the four Big Hast foes it has far.ed while running its con­l'e r11 nee r11co nl to I0-2. The Irish won after trailing Villanova on both l'riday and Saturday before blowing the Wildcats out in the series' finale Sunday. 
"I thought our team played really, roally WPII this weekend," Irish coach Dave Schrage said. "We did a little bit of everything, eoming from behind the first two games then playing really well again [Sunday] ... It was a good weekBnd for us." 
Notre Dame 2, Villanova 1 
The Irish scored a run in both the eighth and ninth innings and that was enough for ace David Phelps, who struck out eight batters and surrendered just five hits in 8 2/3 innings of work. 
"PhPlps had a lot more teeth on his fastball Ithan earlier in the season] and I think he just really dominated the game," Schrage said.

The Notre Dame off'Bnse thrPatmwd several timns bnfore finally brnaking through in thB eighth to tie the game.

Designated hitter David Mills eventually pushed an RBI single through the infield that proved to be the difference in the game. 
"[Mills[ came through with a big two-out single after Barnes did the same thing in the eighth," Schrage said. 
Villanova almost drew even in the ninth, chasing Phelps from the game with a single and walk. 
But after throwing a wild pitch to put the runners on second and third, Weiland struck out Villanova catcher Wesley Borden to end the contest. 
Notre Dame 8, Villanova 5 
The Irish offense was cold for the first six innings Saturday as the team fell behind 3-1, but Notre Dame put together a five­run rally in the seventh frame to take the lead for good. 
The Irish loaded the bases off Villanova starter Brian Streilein in the seventh before Barnes tied the game with a two-run single into center field. 

"Jeremy Barnes had a couple real clutch hits for us lthis weekend]." Schrage said. "His

Brezovsky then provided anoth­er big blow, crushing a home run well over the right-center field fence. Brezovsky's blast was the highlight of his 3-for-5 day and gave the Irish a 6-3 lead. 
Villanova climbed back into the game with two runs in the eighth "inning but Notre Dame shut the door on the comeback with a pair of runs of its own in the ninth. Boockford and Sherry each knocked in an insurance run for Weiland, who worked the bottom of the ninth to pick up his fifth save of the season.

What has changed is Notre Dame's standing among the college hoekey powers. The Irish are now one of them. 

Notre Dame's profile has rocketed from the doldrums to the marquee faster than the Hoadrunner-likc wheels of Boston College forward Nathan Gerbe, who torched the Irish for two goals and two assists on Saturday. 
During the 2004-05 season, Notre Dame limped to five wins; three years later they played in front of nearly 19,000 people in an NIIL arena for a national title. 

Two years ago, the Irish won 13 games under first-year coach Jeff Jackson but lost in the first round of the CCHA tournament to Alaska; the past two seasons the Irish earned byes past the first round.
