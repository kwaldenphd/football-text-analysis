China raps Vietnam war 
Peking, March 19 -(Agence France Presse) -Premier Chou En Lai accused the United States today of prolonging and in­tensifying its "war of aggression" in Southeast Asia and of trying to occupy Indochina. 
It was Chou's first public speech since President Nixon's visit here. 
Chou said that as long as the war continued China would not cease to support the three Indochinese peoples "no matter what form the war of aggression will take." 
The Premier, who spoke during a banquet celebrating the second anniversary of the arrival in Peking of Prince Nordorom Siahnouk of Cambodia, denounced "certain big powers who are in the process of setting up what was claimed to be a "third Khmer force." 
Chou said any attempts directed towads a compromise would be rejected by Sihanouk and his supporters. 
"We resolutely oppose all in­ternational plots aimed at dividing the Cambodian people and the other Indochinese peoples and at 

Florida primary sparks Kennedy speculatio:n 
by R.W. AppleJr 

(c) 1!172 New York'l'lmes 
Chicago, March 19--0n the morning after the Florida Primary, the politicians lounged around the swimming pools of Miami and Miami Beach and guessed,like everyone else. One of the things they guessed, as they mulled over the muddled Florida results, was that no one would be able to put together a first-ballot majority at the Democratic con­vention, and that that would help Edward M. Kennedy. 
Kennedy, Democratic Senator from Massachusetts, brother of an assassinated President, brother also of an assassinated Presidential candidate, does not agree. 
"I still think the nominee will emerge from the primaries," Kennedy said in a weekend telephone interivew. "We've had only two out of 23 primaries. There is a long way to go, and the Wisconsin primary <April 4) has always been more representative of the Democratic Party than Florida or states like that." 
Kennedy said his position was unchanged, that he still had ab­solutely no intention or desire to run for president in 1972. 
In his view, the Senator said, Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota had made "a good showing" in Florida, Sen. Henry l\1. Jackson of Washington had turned in "a very creditable performance" and Sen. EdmundS. Muskie of Maine "had been hurt." 
"But I still think Ed has the broadest support within the par­ty." Kennedy added. "He is probably in the best position." 
Asked whom he considered the main contenders for the nomination. Kennedy said from his home in McLean, Va.: "1\luskie and Humphrey, and I think George McGovern has moved into the big three in a very legitimate way." 
Kennedy said that beginning with Wisconsin, candidates would begin to run out of money, and that the resu!ts in states like Wisconsin, sabotaging their war of resistance to American aggression," Chou said. 
Sihanouk, the guest of honor at the banquet, also rejected all compromise with "the clique of Pnompenh traitors." 
The Prince said that The United National Front of Cambodia (the party over which he presides) and the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia refused "the so-called political solution put forward by certain powers aimed at frustrating a total military victory in Cambodia which would not fail to be achieved." 
The Front and the Royal Government refused to deal with a so called "third Cambodian force, the creation of certain foreign powers hostile to the reolution of the Cambodian people's power in Pnompenh," Sihanouk said. 
The Prince also rejected "any new Geneva-type conference which would make Cambodia a country divided into two states, whre U.S. imperialism would perpetuate its neo-colonialism on a prt of the national territory.". 
Pennsylvania and Massachussetts­-all of which will hold primaries before May 1--would begin to "cut a lot of them out of the race." 
He was unwilling to answer the ultimate question as to what would happen if the race deadlocked'? Would the party leaders, eager to avoid chaos, turn toward him'? 
But the leaders of the Democratic Party, increasingly apprehensive about what they consider the disorderly nominating process created by the party's reform rules, are beginning to ask whether Kennedy isn't the answer to the divisions between left and right. and old and new. 
If the April primaries produce no clear leader. the swing toware Kennedy or some other non­participant in the primaries could begin astonishingly quickly. 
As most professionals now see the situation. Muskie has a chance to bounce back from his Florida embarrassment and win enough primaries and caucuses to put his nomination drive back on the road. 
But if he fails to do so. if he 

Greg Stidham, new Scholastic editor 
Stidham dubbed Scholastic head 
by Mike Baum 
Greg Stidham, an Arts and Letters Pre-Med Student, 
will be the new editor-in-chief of the Scholastic, ac­
cording to his predecessor Mary Ellen Stoltz. 
The Notre Dame Junior was picked by the Student Publications Board of Notre Dame, and will take the place of the present co-editors-in-chief, Miss Stoltz and Joe Hotz. Stidham was formerly a member of the editorial staff of the fortnightly publication. 
The Student Publications Board is composed of Frs. Blantz and Shilts 1(Vice-president and Assistant Vice President of Student Affairs, respectively), and Ronald Weber: Director of the American Studies Program, Frank O'Malley, the Faculty Advisor to the Scholastic and Miss Stoltz and Mr. Hotz. 
Commenting on the appointment, Miss Stoltz said, "I have full confidence in Greg's ability to mobilize the staff's potential. I think Greg will be a really good editor-in-chief, since he's got a certain awareness and an ability to lead." 
Stidham remarked, "I really look on it as a challenge. The Scholastic I feel, has a very definite role, on that is different feom any of the other media." 
Ms. Stoltz noted that the changeover from a co­editorship to a single position did not reflect any failure in this year's arrangment. "I think it (the policy of having two editors-in-chief) worked very well. Joe and I were really fortunate with the cooperation we got." One reason for the change, she said, was that .no one applied jointly for the position this year. 
Stidham agreed that the former arrangement did not seem necessary, this time and said that he intended to rely heavily on the staff. "We're going to have a more tightly knit editorial board this year. I suspect that it won't be reflected in a change in the magazine, but in smoother working in the office," he said. 
He feels optimistic about next year's Scholastic, "We have a lot of Juniors who will be back to form a good nucleus for the staff next year," he said. Miss Stoltz had characterized the present crew as "a really great staff." Stidham is presently considering the applicants for the unfilled staff positions on the Scholastic. He an­ticipates that the defcisions will be annuunced before the spring break, but probably not until Wednesday. 
continues to experience dif­ficulties, it is conceivable that he would pull out ofthe contest. Muskie has implied as much to friends. That would leave many of his supporters, people to whom the nomination of Humphrey for a second time would constitute an admission of party bankruptcy, in need of someone else to back. 
Unless McGovern or some other liberal had caught on by them, they might well begin to bring pressure on Kennedy to allow them to switch their support to him. 
Among those in that group might be Gov. John J. Gilligan of Ohio and Sen. John V. Tunney of California, both of whom endorsed 1\luskie early and helped give his campaign the momentum that it has lost recently. 
1\layor Richard J. Daley of Chicago. who is expected to control a bloc of 90 or more uncommitted delegates at the Miami Beach convention. might well join in such a move. Daley, an old ally of the Kennedy family, has never forgiven Humphrey for un­flattering comments he made about Daley's conduct during the 1968 convention and campaign. 
It is also conceivable that Muskie would win often enough in the next three months to keep his candidacy alive, but not enough to put together the required 1,509 votes for the nomination at the convention. It Humphrey, McGovern, Lindsay, Muskie, Jackson and Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama all had blocs of votes, a deadlock could occur. 
A last-minute move to Kennedy could then develop, particularly if he does well in the Oregon Primary on May 23. His name has been entered by Oregon's secretary of State, Clay Myers, despite Ken­nedy's statements that he is not a candidate. 
Most prominent democrats now accept Kennedy's noncandidacy at face value. But most also think that. all disclaimers aside, cir­cumstances could develop that would generate almost irresistible pressure on Kennedy to run.

ND shows two faces in exchange program 
by Ann Therese Darin 
Campus Editor 
Promises, Promises----N .D. Reports No. 13 lists Du Lac's of­ficial stance on '72-'73 co­exchange. According to the Report, Notre Dame encourages co-exchange between the two schools and will not do anything to hinder its students who wish to major in a strictly SMC depart­ment, such as Elementary Education. The Dome, however, seems to be a double-dealer. From the desk of Arts and Letters Dean Robert Waddick, a letter point bt'ank forbids Notre Dame students from majoring in Elementary Education, unless they have first declared a Notre Dame major. SMC Education Dept. spokesmen consider Notre Dame's move impossible. 
With all of the mundane requirements aside from stipulated education courses, no student can double major with Eled. Reportedly Notre Dame is in the process of losing accreditation for its graduate school, from the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education. The University does not have a program for secondary or elementary teacher accreditation. 
"We're in the Money Versus Ted Is Dead"----Ever been invited to a formal sitdown dinner without being told why? 
Wednesday evening, when the campus is de-studentized for spring vacation, N.D. ad­ministrators, department chair­men and college deans will dine together with wives auspiciously to honor department chairmen. 
According to administrators, department chairmen work hard with scheduling and budgeting <which will occupy most of their vacation l and receive little financial recompense.

Soledad trial to end soo,n 
<c> 1972 New York Times 
San Francisco, March 19 -The 
three-month trial of the celebrated 
Soledad Brothers is in its final 
stages, with closing arguments to 
be presented this week in the ar­
mored courtroom where the two 
black convicts are being tried on 
charges of killing a white prison 
guard. 
The all-white jury of nine women 
and three men will probably begin 
deliberation at midweek. 
The defendants, John Cluchette, 
28 years old, and Fleeta Drumgo, 
26 are charged with murdering 
John V. Mills, 26, a correctional 
officer at Soledad State Prison, on 
Jan. 16, 1970. 
The State contends that the two 
inmates, along with George 
Jackson, 29, beat Mills mercilessly 
and then threw him to his death 
from a third-floor cell tier. 
Prison officials believe Mills was killed in retribution for shooting deaths of three black prisoners by a guard three days before the Mills incident. 
Robertson: war 

exists in UeSe 
by Bob Cosentino 
"The war does exist in our country and veterans are as much helpless victims of it as are those left in Southeast Asia," declared Charles Robertson of Stanford Hall. 
With unemployment of returning 
war veterans at its highest in many years, the Executive Committee of the American Legion, Department of Nevada. proposed an increase of war veteran benefits during a meeting in Tonapah, Nevada, February 20. 
The committee favored an in­crease in school year benefits, which would give a veteran $200 per month plus tuition and in­cidental costs of education. 
"The present educational training benefits by law are en­tirely inadequate due to the rising costs of living expenses." the committee stated. "Furthermore. an increase in benefits could permit more veterans to go to school when they return; thus eliminating them from competing in the overflowed job market." 
One of the advantages of the proposed increase of benefits is aimed toward ROTC students. raising their monthly stipend to $200 . according to Robertson. "The effects of the resolution would more rapidly bring about the strongly desir~ voluntary army." . 
The resolution would also have a great effect on all college students. who can be assured of finishing school later if they are drafted. 
"Veteran organizations have been greatly criticized in recent years," said Robertson. "Students should be aware of efforts made in their behalf. This resolution demonstrates the interest held by those organizations for the youth.·· 
Jackson, assertedly the central figure in the killing is now dead. He was shot last August in a bloody outbreak at San Quentin prison in what prison authorities say was an 
escape attempt. Two other prisoners and tgo San Quentin guards also died in that violence. 
The Soledad Brothers trial was conducted under stringent security Pr t. s It has been marked

by tensl.on and repeated clashes between the defense and the

whether the judge was being fair to

The state's case is principally based on testimony by Mills' fellow guards and the accounts of two white andd two black prison in­
mates who said they saw Cluchette, Drumgo and Jackson assaulting Mills.

It was tne case of the Soldedad Brothers that involved Angela Davis in the difficulties for which she is now being tried in nearby San Jose.

one top administrator, "and thought that by having the affair formal, the wives would have a chance to dress up." 
This is the first time such a dinner has been held. Suspiciously: 
With the much publicized $700,000 deficit this semester causing these same department chairmen to cut back ten percent in departmental spending and not to replace retiring faculty, WHERE is the money coming for the gala? 
More importantly, WHY? 
To honor Fr. Hesburgh for a successful 20 year term as N.D. president, when the average stay in a president's office is only four years? 
To announce Honorable Fr. Hesburgh's retirement from a 20 year job well-done? (Four years ago, Hesburgh heralded that a college president should serve no longer than 20 years. l This is one of the darkest horses in the race, although, at present it runs like wild-fire among faculty coffee clatches. 
Observer Insight 
Informed sources believe this too far off Hesburgh's retirement timetable reputed to be graduation 
or early June. Local media per­
sonnel substantiate this by noting 
that a deluge of national press accompany all official TMH acts. This dinner is too low-key. 
Hesburgh 's announdement of his 
exodus from the sterile Indiana plains to an elective office in the politically-sterile, silent majoritied Washington, D.C.?
Some knowledgeable students believe this may be the cause-­fueled by Nixon's anti-bussing announcement last week--although the dinner was announced well in advance of the speech. 
Reply to last week's faculty statement roasting the provost's office for its un-democratic decision-making policies? Fr. Burtchaell has refused comment until TMH has first been up to bat. However, dinner invitations were in the mail a week before the faculty statement was released. 
To announce Notre Dame has found a pot of gold in the form of a large grant to erase the debt? Financial spokesmen, when quizzed, shot this possibility down. 
Dark Horse: To announce Rev. James Riehle's retirement from the office of Dean of Students? While many insiders agree that the retirement is forthcoming, they felt Wednesday night was neither the time or place. 
On--Again--Off-Again Merger--­From Notre Dame Magazine,February, 1972, p.5: 
The SMC trustees added that if negotiations fail once again, Sa~t Mary's will immediately begm seeking a new president. Sister Alma has said she will not take the job and would prefer not .t? serve past this summ~r. In add~t10~, the college will begm to rede~me Itself as an independent Catholic college for women.

Some inner-city ghettos have special schools. For little boys who don't talk. 
Not mute little boys. But children so withdrawn, so afraid of failure, they cannot make the slightest attempt to do any­thing at which they might fail. 
Some don't talk. Some don't listen. Most don't behave. And all of them don't learn. 
One day someone asked us to help. 
Through Kodak, cameras and film were distributed to teachers. The teachers gave the cameras to the kids and told them to take pictures. 
And then the miracle. Little boys who had never said any­thing, looked at the pictures and began to talk. They said "This is my house." "This is my dog." "This is where I like

We're helping the children of the inner-city. And we're also helping the adults. We're involved in inner-city job pro­grams. To train unskilled people in useful jobs. 
What does Kodak stand to gain from this? Well, we're showing how our products can help a teacher-and maybe creating a whole new market. And we're also cultivating young customers who will someday buy their own cameras and film. But more than that, we're cultivating alert, edu­cated citizens. Who will someday be responsible for our society. 
After all, our business depends on our society. So we care what happens to it.

Ifthere is one word that we love to use to describe Notre Dame, it has be "community." A beautiful word, evoking thoughts of cooperation an mutual concern, describing the perfect Christian way of life. Listen to a interview with a University spokesman, or read one of the stories tha national magazines periodically publish on ND ·the word is there. 
Problem is some of the people who spend a lot of time here · several students and faculty members for instance-have a lot of problem finding 
that "special feeling about the place." For many here, Notre Dame is just a place to spend four years, get a diploma, job, and, when memor fades, give money to. 
Several items in last week's issue of The Observer bring out some of th problems that people see here. 
The first is the faculty statement on the "Future of Notre Dame." Th main point in the essay seems to be the failure of the community proces in the administration of the school. "The whole community at No · Dame is being revised and revised downward . . . a frustrat regimented society also makes a poor community, and individuals who self-respect and confidence are perpetually undermined become poor persons," this report read in part. 
The statement was not hastily considered, and the faculty membe who affirmed their agreement with the substance of the essay worry th there is a developing failure of the sense of community here. 
Another report that showed that problems exist in our awareness each other was the announcement that Tom O'Mara would be leav· school, and the reaction that followed. We wondered about the frustrati of the other "Tom O'Mara whose names never make the paper but just as alone, unhappy, or frustrated." 
O'Mara described Notre Dame as "something less than an intellect and academic oasis," a place thatfails to consider the emotional needs the people that live here. Again, this is a failure of the community -a the reaction to this decision indicates that he is not alone in his criticis 
The last item, somewhat more hopeful, was a report on a "Celebrati of Self" that several St. Mary's students are planning for April. Dunn, who is organizing the effort, said that the college takes on appearance of a "non-community of individuals suffering in mutu isolation." 
The idea is a hopeful one, since it shows that people might care enou to start something. If they have the courage to carry the plan through, spite of the apathy they will encoutnter, and the time it will take, planners will at least be providing a basis for awareness of the co munity that can exist here. 
Any effort to develop community awareness will encouner the sa problem, however. There has to be a willingness to admit that any failu in community is the fault of everyone of us. 
It might be difficult for a sensitivity group that would love to hug only -itself, but we must come to the realization that we must reach o and find the rest of the people here. The old adage of "Make a friend, friend," is corny, but right now. we need it, and, hopefully, we have t potential to make it a real commitment.

another v·iew from across the road 
One evening I caught the bus to the library. A man of my age was driving and he had on highly polished black shoes and tapered panoc-
I smiled and said "Hi." I was in a good mood despite cold weather and the work I had to do. 
He looked at me and said, "Evening." He began combing his hair in the mirror of the bus. I asked him how he liked driving the bus. 
··-He·· grinned into the mirror showing large, white teeth. 
"It's the best job I ever had. I graduated and went into the army and when I got out, I couldn't find anything. I need the money to buy a car and get a house and to get around before I settle down. There's a lot I want to do, you know?" 
He turned to face me and I nodded. "Yeah." 
. "Like I can make a lot of money doing this and I really love it. I work and it's not hard. Like today I worked until three o'clock and then I had to be on from six until four downtown, then I ate some dinner at the bus station and came on here until midnight. The pay is fantastic." 
driving in circles 
"Do you have a girl or something that you're saving for?" 
"Nah ... I just like to think of the future. When I get enough money I'm going to quit and get away from here and just live while I can enjoy everything. It shouldn't take long because I work a lot and the pay is good. Then ... will I have a good time! Look out! And maybe later I'll get married or something. A lot of my friends are married already. But, no.. .l really love to drive this bus. The kids are good kids and we talk and get to know each other a little. The kids here are pretty nice kids." 
We had arrived at the library and I waited until last to get off. "Thank you. G'night." My good mood was left on the bus. 
I got on a bus after having watched two pass me by. . 
"Good morning," said the driver, smiling compassionately at my wind burned cheeks and chapped lips. 
"Hi," l answered, -smiling and then feeling the sting of my lip which had split in the midst of all my friendliness. "How are you?" 

This additional courtesy was automatic and I expected absolutely no other reply than "Fine." 
"Oh-h-h, I have to tell you what hap­pened to me this morning." 
I sat back and painted a half smile on my face, wondering why I hadn't kept my mouth shut. 
"l worked until three o'clock this morning and then had to be back on at seven because one of the other drivers who takes the Notre Dame, St. Mary's route was sick. He caught the flu from his wife and he won't be driving until tomorrow." 
I inquired whether or not I had heard correctly when he said that he worked until three and then had to go again at 
seven. 

"Yeah ... I stay at the bus station and take a nap there. I don't get too tired and I catch up on my day off. But the money is pretty good." 
My head snapped back as he bolted the. bus across the road to the gate. He con­tinued after opening it.

Fr. Griffin 
i've heard it before 
The mother's voice on the long distance line was full of agony. She spoke slowly in the way people do if they are afraid of losing control over their emotions and becoming hysterical. She told me of her daughter, a lovely, intelligent girl of twenty, who has left school --perhaps, said the mother, under the influence of drugs or the delusions of witchcraft--to live with a student who declines to marry her. He will never marry her, the mother said, presumably on the theory that boys won't marry the girls they shack up with, because they don't really have to. 
"My daughter says it's okay to live with a boy," said the mother. "She says there's no sin, and nothing wrong, because she loves him." 
There was something deeper to the words than the simple explanations to a priest of a school girl's ethics. The implicit meaning became explicit in the woman's question: "Father, do you think it is right for my daughter to be living in sin with this boy, and that there is nothing wrong in what they are doing just because they love each other?" It was obvious from the context that the mother suspected me of teaching some system of morality in which love is the universal solvent of integrity and respon­sibility; and self-discipline can be dismissed as irrelevant. because people can do anything --anything at all, no matter how self-destructive--as long as their motive is love. · 
1do believe that love is the highest motive 
of human action·, my sources for saying so 
are impeccable. I couldn't say to the 
mother. "I believe in love, but what your 
daughter feels for this boy is not love," 
because I don't know if it is true; perhaps 
she loves the boy very much. The hope is 
that he is worth being cared for, and that he, 
in his turn. cares for her also. But where 
love is mature and responsible, people do 
not risk hurting each other. I think that a 
boy living with a twenty year old girl he is 
not ready to marry risks hurting her very 
badly. I think also the girl risks hurting 
herself. 
When two people love each other with tion of guilt, I wish my own innocence we>P as intact as that of the girl whose only fault is to live with th boy she loves. What is wrong -terribly, tradically wrong -is that the girl is giving so much of herself at a time when the couple is not ready for marriage .. . that she exposes herself to exploitation and betrayal ... that she does not have enough respect for the physical and psychic energies that are intended to fulfill her as a woman . . . that her sex,!la!ity needs to be 
explored not in a casual living arrangement 
but in a situation of established security 
where the mutual love of two people 
result in the building of a togetherness for 
life. 
This attitude may sound old-fashioned, 
but I am not trying to be endorsed by Playboy or to win the approval of Women's Lib. I am an old-fashioned kind of priest; and the notion of pre-marital living arrangements -for me or anyone else -does not turn me on. 

Even mothers, in their God-given wisdom, cannot make moral choices for their 
honesty and sincerity, I hesitate to describe children. This girl has made what I con­the unwise things they do to each other as sider to be a bad decision; but love, conern, sin. because sin is an affair of the con-and involvement with people should be science. and I am not a reader of con-based not on what they do, but who they are. sciences. Hatred is a sin--it offends against I hope this mother will make a moral choice the life and light of God; it cripples and of her own; accepting whrer she does not disfigures the mind and the will. But love--understand, loving where she cannot con­not to be confused with the charades and done. The daughter already runs the risk of masquerades wherein passion parodies love being a heavy loser; she can't afford the loss --is holy and from God. Even in its holiness, of hermother's compassion and the therapy it is subject to the disciplines of the mind; of her love. Maybe the girl's love affair will otherwise it is like a fire that can leave one end happily. But if it doesn't, her unhap­badly scarred as the victim of flames. piness could be compounded into a tragedy 
But how. without appearing to be morally if the concern of her family is not senstiive permissive, can a priest tell a heart-broken enough to receive her without criticism or woman: "Little mother, I am concerned censure. Sometimes it is not the lamb who about your daughter not because I think she has lot the sheepfold, but the sheepfold that . is a great sinner, because sin is on a level of interiority where neither of us can intrude.. There is a wrongness here that goes deeper 
.but because I fear she does not know what than sin. which. in recent times, seems like the consequnces of her actions are." What a technical word dealing with the mechanics is needed here is not a system of legal of grace--if grace has a mechanics, which I has lost the lamb, and we should celebrate the homecoming of the shepherd. 


At Christmas time, I sat in a New York restaurant talking to a pretty young girl, who was a prostitute. Our conversation was of ordinary, innocent things, which made it all seem so pathetic. 
She said, "Have you noticed my nail polish?" 
"Yes," I said. "It's very pretty." 
"It's the first time I've worn this color," she said. "People never tell you if they like your nail polish or not, and I hate sitting around waiting for someone to notice. So I'm asking you. Do you really like it?'' 
"I like it very much," I said. "But tell me: why are your hands trembling?" 
"Something happened to me," she said. 
"Please take better care of yourself," I said, and I got up to leave. "Why do you think I am not taking good care of myself?" she said. 
"Because your hands are trembling." 
"Something happened to me," she said. "Can I help it if something happened to me?" "No." I said, "but take care of yourself anyway." 
Prostitutes are not necessarily hardened veterans of sin. In the City, there are thousands of them, young, pretty girls who do human little things like worrying about nail polish. You would hardly know they were prostitutes, if their trembling hands did not betray the fact that something happened to them, and they have lost the clue to the mystery of their own sexuality. 
Without odious or melodramatic com­parisons, I do wish to make this point: sometimes the life of a prostitute begins as the impasse of a girl shabbily treated by a boy and cast off as the sinner by her family. Then the girl begins the slow drift from affair to affair. until gradually she becomes convinced of her own worthlessness. Prostitution becomes a way of staying alive. a form of punishment self-inflicted because self-respect has been lost. The prostitute's guilt is communal , but the heartbreak is mostly her own. 
Before saying it doesn't happen, try talking to some of the girls in New York who are walking the streets at Midnight. 
That is why I get sick when mothers call long distance to tell me of girls who leave home to live with boys who won't accept 
categories that analyze human behaviour on doubt. because it assumes that God deals lllilrriage. It sounds like the beginning of a the basis of sin. Judging from a presump-with us as machines, not as living beings. story I've heard before.

car awav and the police were at the house. 
The car was parked in front of the house and it had license plates that were due to run out tomorrow, but they said that it shouldn't be parked on the street, but we always park it there. So I had to get home in a hurry to see what was going on. The cops were really mad when I got there and I told them that they better damn well get off my property since they didn't have no right to be there, you know?" 
"M-m-m-m. Yeah." I couldn't think of a reply. 
"Anyways, they took me downtown and I told them bastards that they couldn't take my car away because of the plates 'cause they didn't run out until tomorrow. I was mad and so was that sargeant. They took the car and now I have to go down there tomorrow when I get off work and pay to get the car back. I'm not paying any $40...they can forget it. I didn't ask them to tow it away." 
I got off at the grotto, smiled, and said, "Let me know hot it turns out. Good luck." I had to hurry to the bookstore so that I

Debi Gras 

Never have I felt so lost and depressed in my life. As I look at the brochure on the Economics and Business department at St. Mary's I see that I can be a secondary education school teacher. I paid $4000 to hear that I can't even get a BBA degree, instead the SMC business majors get a degree in arts and letters. Sure they have some business courses to offer but not enough for one semester let alone after that. 
So after examining all the possibilities of this wonderful college I find myself writing letters for applications and making numerous trips over to the administration building to have them send my transcripts to Ohio State, Berkeley, Colorado, etc.... each of course costing $10. 
Facing reality, which is so often hard to do. I realize that I cannot get into Notre Dame and must leave. I must start all over again. Will I change so much when I go to another university that my friends here won't be able to relate to me as they do now. Not knowing if you will see these people again scares me. Coming from Denver I know that it would be hard to see these people in the next three years. When I do see them will I be so wrapped up in what I am doing and they in their lifestyle that we won't know each other. I hope and pray that this doesn't happen. I know that I should be making the most of these next three months in the SMC-ND COMMUNITY. But instead I have turned everything off. I just don't care any more. I am so afraid to face what I will he doing in May, saying goodbye to tveryone. and second starting all over again in September. 
I t-hink the main reason I am writing this is because of the article entitled, "Is This a Christian University" in a recent edition of the Obst>rver. If this is a Christina l 1niversity and I am a Christian then I better get out of here before I lose all faith in people. I will have to give the ad­ministration credit, though, they really did put us in our place. 
I know that I will ~ okay but will what I have experienced here be forgotten by me and everyone else; I hope not. I also hope that I have the strength to leave. If I am not myself then please realize that I am so scared that I am covering up for it. And to the people I do know here, please don't change and please be here if ever I come back to visit you at Notre Dame.

teachers and administrators over the usefulness and real meaning of the A's, B's, C's, D's and F's that have traditionally spelled the difference between success and failure for students seeking scholarships, hoping to get into graduate school, or looking for a good job after graduating. 
Part of the reason lies in the liberalized curriculums and grading systems of the last decade. But teachers and other educators with differing teellngs about the grade rise believe that

Similar trends are present in each of a dozen other universities queried. At Harvard, just over half of 1961 graduated with honors, last Spring the figure was over two-thirds. 
Correspondingly, fewer students at the University of Illinois are flunking out or being put on academic probation. During the 1964-65 school year, the university reported, 16 percent of the undergraduates were either expelled or put on probation for low grades; last 

Bicycle owners should take extra measures to safeguard their bikes over Easter break, ND Security warns. 
Campus bicycle thefts are in­creasing as warm weather ap­proaches. ~xact figures are not available according to Arthur Pears, head of ND Security, Holy Cross Hall seems hardest hit with two ten-speeds stolen this month. 
Pears believes certain residents of South Bend come on campus with bolt cutters and steal bicycles from racks outside residence halls. He suggests all bicycles be stored inside. 
"We are having an awful lot of stolen bikes. Ifa bike is valuable to you, make arrangements with your rector to store the bike inside over vacation," Pears said. 
All dorms will be locked over vacation and security will have extra patrols checking halls to guard against theft. Pears ex­plained that all students staying on campus during the break must secure a pass key from their rector. 
Security strongly suggests all bicycles owners record the serial number of their bikes. It is usually found on the rear of the bike on the permanent portion of the bike frame. 
"The only way to effectively identify a bike is through the serial number. We need the serial number not just the description." Pears said. 
Three years ago ND required bicycles to be registered to insure the serial number was known. Pears said this practice was discontinued because itwas "time consuming and thankless." '_

Francisco State College. Burwen found that the over-all un­dergraduate grade rise was from 
2.4 in 1960 to 2.56 in 1969 was equal to the rise of the previous four years. 
And while grades have gone up, the scores earned by high school seniors on College Entrance Examinations--the familiar Scholastic Aptitude Test--have dropped slightly. Freshmen who entered college in 1966 scored an average 471 out of 800 points; on the verbal test last year's fresh­men got an average of 454. 
Although the divergence of SAT scores and college grades may confirm the suspicion of some teachers that grades are going up even though the students are not any smarter, testing experts caution against reading the connection too literally. The College Boards ask different questions and test a different knowledge from college examinations and term papers, they point out. 
The debate on rising grades turns on the attitudes of teachers, not how smart students are, rises from deeply held feelings among the faculty about the new trends in college education and its changing standards and students.

Workers organize against lettuce growers 

by Frank Zivl' 

Another, and perhaps the most crucial, battle between the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee (UFWOCl and California lettuce gruwers has begun in a Gresno, California courtroom. 
Attorneys for the National Labor Relations Board <NLRB) filed a petition in a federal district court in Fresno on March 9 asking for a 
Begun in 1964 
nationwide injunction that would bar the UFWOC from conducting boycotts of products ot any growers. such an injunction would 
remove UFWOC's most  effective  
tool  in  its  struggles  agamst  
growers.  

It was a 5-year grape boycott that finally brought about negotiations that resulted in the farm workers receiving a wage of $2.10 an hour and 10 minute breaks every four hours. It was a lettuce boycott a year ago that resulted in Salinas Valley lettuce growers recognizing UFWOC in a jurisdictional controversy with the Teamsters. 
The hearing to determine whether the injunction will be issued is scheduled for April 6. The NLRB also plans to begin unfair labor practice hearings dealing with the issue of permanently 

Students to tutor S.C. residents 
r 
A group of students plan to leave this Wednesday for Hampton County, South Carolina, in order to tutor residents of that un­derprivileged area. 
Paul Fuchs, local organizer for 

the project, said that at present he 
l ahd 17 students ready to go and would take more if he had the trailsportation. "There has been a very llood renonse to'the program, but unfortunately we haven't had too many offers or cars. I think we could take 25 people it we have the transportation." 
The program for bringing students down to Hampton County was begun at Notre Dame in 1964 in order to help in voter registration after the Civil Rights Act was passed. The organizer in Hampton is James Moore, a state representative for the NAACP, and founder of the Committee for Betterment of Poor People. 
Now, since the voterregistration is straightened out, the main aim of the program is to educate the people of the conty, and perhaps, as Fuchs said, "to stabilize the economic position of the peopole by raising their standard of education." 
Fuchs stressed that Moore was the primary organizer of the program, and that, he, Moore, felt that one of the aims was to bring students down to South Carolina, not merely on a temporary basis to tutor just during Easter vacation, but with the hope that "they will like it enough to reutrn for perhaps a year or more to teach .... maybe even to come back to live as doctors and lawyers." 
The other local organizer of the program is Joyce Miller. Fuch:;o said that he could be reached b) any interested party who might wish to drive or lese is interested in the program at 234-5889.

Faculty would teach only three courses intead of four. Students could only elect twelve or 15 hours. 
Calendar Crisis----Despite faculty and student distress at Notre Dame's new calendar, "In by Labor Day, Out by Christman," because of extensive co-exchange with Notre Dame, the College Academic Council felt obliged to pass the university one. 
SMC's new hierarchy felt that a veto on the new calendar would not faze the University one bit. However, if Notre Dame at Wednesday's special Academic Gouncil meeting passes the student-proposed calendar, SMC new administrators would gladly switch-over . 
explained that the four students won their second place in a fifld of 14 teams with little coaching or preparation. "Now we are pmch more organized," he added. "We are practicing'avariety of opening moves and defenses, and gaining some good theory as well."

halting boycotts, but no date has been set for these hearings. 
Speakers will be at the main quad on the Notre Dame campus today at noon to explain the court action and UFWOC's position. 
The latest round in the UFWOC­growers controversy is the result of a change of position by the NLRB. On two separate occasions, the latest being March 15, 1971, NLRB general counsel had written to UFWOC stating the organization was not a "labor union"under the 
National  Labor  Relations  Act  
<NLRAl.  
This  is  critical  as  secondary  

boycotts--boycotts on products rather than just a strike--are not permitted under the NLRA. Since UFWOC was not considered covered  by the act, which specifically excludes agriculture workers from its protections and benefits such as minimum wages, its boycotts were not unlawful. 
Peter Nash, appointed recently by President Nixon as general counsel to the NLRB, has aban­doned this position and has ad­vanced the theory that UFWOC is a labor union within the act's framework and therefore is sub­ject to its restrictions. 
According to a fact sheet from UFWOC supporters, Nash's action came in response to a request made by several California growers including lettuce growers from the Salinas Valley who are presently being boycotted 
It appears that the legal reason for the change in the NLRB's position is a technical one. UF­WOC has some members who work in produce packing sheds and workers in the sheds are covered by the NLRA. The theory is that since some of UFWOC's members are covered by the act, then the organization does meet the statutory definition of a "labor union." 
However, since agriculture workers are excluded from the act, none of the benefits of the NRLA will be bestowed upon the UFWOC members working the fields. 
UFWOC's leader Cesar Chavez, in a letter to supporters, stated, "The boycott is breath and life for our union. We are taking our cause to the American people. We ask you to judge our struggle, to test our committtment to non-violence, and to consider the gross injustice of this Republican move against farm workers." 
Chavez also aksed supporters to write to Senator Robert J. Dole, chairman of the Republican National Committee, 310 First St. S.E., Washington, D.C., 20003 to protest the action. 
Local UFWOC supporters are planning to go to Indianapolis Monday April 3 to show their concern to the NLRB and state GOP leaders. They are en­couraging all students returning from Easter break and join them
