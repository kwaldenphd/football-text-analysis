IN BRIEF I 
Some 1 ,800 Notre Dame Freshmen learned during orientation that they have a special cachet. The Class of 1992 has been designated the Sesquicentennial Class by University officials, and members will be involved in plan­ning events celebrating the 150th anniversary of the found­ing of Notre Dame. Established in 1842, the University is the 13th oldest among existing American Catholic institu­tions of higher learning. The idea came from the History of the University committee, which has been involved in some of the early discussion of the Sesquicentennial. The committee has suggested that the observance take place between November 1991 and November 1992. That proposal and others will be taken up by a formal Sesquicentennial Committee to be appointed soon by Provost Timothy O'Meara. 
Jurgen Brauer, a graduate student in economics at the University of Notre Dame has been awarded a Peace Scholar .Award by the United States Institute of Peace. Brauer, a native of West Berlin, received a master's degree from Notre Dame 1986. He is doing research in military expenditure, arms production, and economic de­velopment in Third World nations. 
A microwave popcorn bag is the subject of a patent infringement suit filed by Golden Valley Microwave Foods Inc. The civil suit accused Weaver Popcorn Co., of Van Buren, Ind., of patent infringement. Weaver,~ privately held business, is one of the largest processors of popcorn in the United States and produces and sells microwave 
. popcorn products worldwide. The lawsuit, filed last week, maintains that Weaver is infringing on the patent issued to Golden Valley last April 5 for technology included in its microwave popcorn bags marketed under the Act II trademark. Golden Valley contends that Weaver is selling and distributing microwave popcorn packages which in­corporate the technology covered by the Golden Valley patent. In addition to seeking damages for past infringe­ment, Golden Valley has asked the court to enjoin Weaver from further manufacturer, sale or distribution of the package at issue.-Associated Press 
The moos have it. Dairy farms may have disappeared from around the northern Illinois town of Harvard that once called itself "The Milk Center of the World," but residents still know their cows. When they saw two 8-foot­high pictures of what were supposed to be dairy cows on their new 135-foot tall water tower last month, they started beefing. The cows, they said, looked like bulls. Residents also noted that everything on the water tower had been painted on the wrong directional axis, so people driving by could see only part of the design. A day after the paint job, Mayor Frank Godo ordered a more accurate repre­sentation of cows and proper alignment of the artwork. Local farmers were happy to supply more accurate cow drawings, and city engineers presented the painters last week with a proper cow image Including a small patch of grass. "I guess it turns out we're lucky that they messed up on the direction," said engineer Bill Rimer. "We'll get a good cow out of it."-Associated Press

Tonight is Student Activities. All the clubs and organizations on campus will be there, in­cluding The Observer. "What can I do for The Observer?'' will no doubt be the most frequently asked question at our table. For anyone inter­ested, The Observer has a number of entry­level positions at The Observer. All of the fol­lowing jobs require only minimal experience, but they are all responsible positions. If The Observer hires someone, we are putting our faith and trust in them, and they in turn should respect us enough to do a complete and thor­ough job. 
News copy editors: Each night of publication a news copy editor is on duty to copy edit the campus and Asso<;iated Press stories as well as help write photo outlines. A copy editor works from 6 p.m. until the newspaper is finished. 
News reporters: In order to cover as many campus events as possible The Observer needs a broad base of reporters. News reporters must be solid, responsible writers. No prior news writing experience is necessary; The Observer will be happy to train new writers. R~porters should be prepared to write a least one story a week. 
Sports reporters: Just as a newspaper needs news reporters it also needs sports writers. Sports reporters, like all reporters, must be re­sponsible, competent writers. 
Typesetters: The Observer typesets its own copy for the production of the newspaper. Typesetters work with The Observer's mini­computer and an Apple Macintosh computer, and therefore prospective typesetters should be comfortable with computer equipment. There are positions available for afternoon and eve­ning typesetters. 
Photographers: Photographs help illustrate 
and report the news, and The Observer is al­
ways looking for photojournalists. There are 
many positions available for photographers at 
various times throughout the day. 
Illustrators: The Observer generates its own artwork on a daily basis. There are often stories that cannot be illustrated properly with photographs and therefore need an illustration. The Observer needs not only free-hand il­lustrators but also those who are interested in computer generated info-graphics. 
Production staff: Students are responsible for laying out the paper every day we publish. The Observer is always looking for interested, re­sponsible students to help in lay out (production) of the paper. 
Viewpoint columnists: The Viewpoint page serves as The Observer's editorial page every day. The Viewpoint department needs students who are interested in writing a column periodi­cally. If you feel you have something important to say, this is the department for you. 

Ad sales people: The Observer supports it­self, iri part, through the sale of display adver­tising. The advertising department has posi­tions open for students interested in ad sales. 
Ad design: Many of the ads in The Observer require extensive make-up by The Observer's ad design staff. The ad designers, as the name implies, design and lay out the ads. It is an afternoon job and positions are available. 
Page design: This is a new position for The Observer this year. The page designers will be responsible for the overall design of the Accent page and other special sections. The Observer will train those interested in newspaper design and production, but some interest in art or design is required. 
Accent writers: The Accent department is the features department of The Observer. Those interested in features writing (e.g. reviews, profiles, human interest) are welcome to work for The Observer. 
I hope we see you there tonight.

Future air shows face changes after traged·y 
Associated Press 
LONDON-The disaster at Ramstein U.S. Air Base in West Germany casts a shadow over the air shows that are among Europe's favorite spectator sports as well as being the major marketplaces of the in­ternational aerospace indus­try. 
But while Germany has suspended military air exhibi­tions and some calls are being heard for other European countries to do likewise, the shows look likely to go on. 
Sunday's tragedy at Ramstein came a week before Europe's biggest aviation event England's Farnborough Air Show --and although Farnborough hasn't experienced an accident in­volving spectators since 1952, the Ramstein disaster immedi­ately prompted thoughts about safety at the show. 
In Britain, Ken Collins, a Labor Party member of the European Parliament, wrote to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Monday urging that Farnborough be canceled because, "We cannot afford to take any more needless risks with human life." 
Organizers said the show 
would go on, but spokesman

Duncan Simpson, a former test pilot, said: "No one would deny that after an accident like that we all have to think very hard." 
However, he said the safety rules already were so strict that there was little scope for major change. 
Pilots at Farnborough have to perform their display for a committee of experts before the show opens. They cannot fly over or toward the spectators, they must maintain a mini­mum altitude of 100 feet and must keep to the side of the run­way farthest from the grandstands. 
"I would never say an inci­dent will never happen," Simpson said in an interview. "They do happen occasionally. What we are concerned with is ensuring that in the likelihood of an accident, the catastrophic consequences should be reduced to an absolute mini­mum." 
Paul Beaver, managing editor of Janes' Defense Data, the authoritative military publishing concern, reckons that air shows statistically are 10 times safer than highways. 
"You're much less likely to be hurt at an air show than driving to it," he said in an in­terview.

"The plane blew up, and people started running," Beichler said. "One guy was on fire. Other people were wrapped up in barbed wire. There were small fires all around me." 
A ball of flame 200 feet high and equally wide raced toward the crowd after the crash that killed the three Italian pilots.

datory federal pollution plans and litigation, which will only further delay reaching the goal we all want--clean air." 
The General Accounting Of­fice, the investigative arm of Congress, says existing law is not silent on the issue, as Thomas contends, and that all 107 areas should be penalized. 
Decisions on similar con­struction bans are pending for Ventura County, Calif., and for the Indiana and Illinois sub­urbs of Chicago. 
Before the end of the year, the EPA expects to adopt a policy requiring areas not meeting pollution standards to demonstrate steady progress, with a goal of an average 3 per­cent reduction in pollution con­
centrations  annually,  apart  
from  any nationwide  reduc­ 
tions.  

When it adopts that policy, the agency will decide whether to impose construction bans at Denver; Reno, Nev.; 
Lee said, adding that there could be more such cases in other hospitals. 
Rudolf Tartter, head of the local government district that includes Ramstein, said West German officials put the death count at 45, one below the U.S. toll. There was no explanation for the discrepancy. 
Defense Minister Rupert Scholz said officials will study ways for West Germany and its NATO allies to demonstrate their air forces' abilities with­out endangering spectators. 
"Until suggestions for effec­tive measures are complete, there will not be any more air shows with military aircraft in West Germany, this with the agreement of the air forces of our NATO allies," Scholz an­nounced. 
Bakersfield, Sacramento and Fresno, Calif.; East St. Louis, Ill., the Indiana suburbs of Louisville, Ky.; Cleveland; At­lanta, and Dallas. 
The agency said Dallas could escape penalties because of new proposals in its latest air quality plan. 
Denver, Reno and Cleveland fail to meet carbon monoxide standards. Fresno fails both the carbon monoxide and ozone standards, and the other areas fall short of meeting ozone standards. 
Because of its weather and terrain, Los Angeles has by far the highest ozone concentra­tions in the country. Anti­pollution measures there have long been the strictest in the country. 
Already under construction bans are the Kentucky suburbs of Cincinnati; St. Cloud, Minn. ; Albuquerque, N.M., and some parts of Illinois. Other penalties have been assessed against Albuquerque, but the EPA last month proposed lif­ting those sanctions.

But flames so far have been successfully diverted around buildings and monuments. Power lines and some cabins have been saved under the protection of fire-proof blankets. 
And already officials are planning the rebuilding and talking to potential visitors about next year --when grassy meadows will sprout where dense forest used to be. 
"Yellowstone will be a differ­ent kind of Yellowstone in the future. It certainly will be a living testament to the most powerful forces in nature," said park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo. 
"On a scale of one to ten, I guess I'd say the condition of the park is an eight. But we still have at least four more weeks of drought conditions," and the fires continue to spread, she said. 
Yellowstone, which is the size of Delaware and Rhode Is­land combined and is visited by more than 2 million people a year, still has more than one million acres of untouched lodgepole pine. 
Wildlife like buffalo, elk and bears have escaped unharmed, and still could be seen grazing along some roads Monday. Park rangers estimate that in areas where fast-moving flames jumped around, only 50 percent of the vegetation was lost. 
"The park isn't entirely black," spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt said. 
Yet several roads remain closed because of the danger of falling trees. In some areas, the thick, pungent smoke painted a white sheet over colorful mountain vistas. 
And about half of the camp grounds and hotels have been shut down --not because of damage but because of prox­imity to danger and lack of tourists. 
Eight major fires contiltlued burning Monday in Yel­lowstone, and several others blazed in national forests on the perimeter. 
While it will take decades of mature trees to return to damaged areas, fires spark a rebirth in the forest and are ac­tually beneficial for its ecologi­cal cycle by allowing new growth.

Alcohol Policy transferS problem 
During the past summer the Officers of the University reviewed and acted upon the report received from the Task Force on Whole Health and the Use and Abuse of Alcohol. Policy changes have been implemented;_ however, parts of the policy have failed to address properly the issue of alcohol consumption here at Notre Dame. 
First, the clause that limits dorms to one all-hall formal per semester and specifies that 70 percent of the dor~ must buy tickets well in advance will do little to enhance an already limited social atmosphere on campus. In the past, th~ University has stressed the centrality of dorm life, given the lack of fraternities and other such social organizations. The residence hall and its associated activities develop a strong sense of spirit and camaraderie, and the SYR is the dorm's social high point. 
Given the changes, disgruntled students will not regard the dorm as a viable social alternative and will turn to off-campus social events, an outcome that simply moves the alcohol problem elsewhere. The problem lies not in the all-hall formal itself but in the abuse of alcohol which often takes place at the SYR. A better solution could eliminate the alcohol orientation of these events without limiting their number. 
Second, in implementing these changes the University, failed to explain the rationale behind them. One can discern general reasons, primary among these the 21 drinking age in Indiana and the growing sentiment nation-wide to enforce more strictly these consumption laws. But these are not enough. Students, who comprise the majority of the University community, deserve to know the specific reasons why their dorm social life is being so radically altered. Moreover, the actual distribution of the policy changes has been sparse, as the majority of students have not seen the document itself. 
Third, the clause that forbids alcohol advertisements from University-sponsored publications unnecessarily questions the responsibility of the students and the student journalists. The publication of alcohol advertisements in The Observer neither constitutes alcohol abuse nor glamorizes it to students. The Ob­server in the past has printed responsible advertisements, and has a specific, written policy which guides advertising decisions. The University's actions are unwarranted in this area. 
Five years ago the University implemented an alcohol policy that has failed to address fully the alcohol problem on this campus. The necessity for periodic revisions have demonstrated this. The administration has to its credit implemented several positive steps, among these the creation of the mandatory course for freshmen on substance abuse. Unfortunately these latest changes affecting dorm parties and publications fail to improve the situation.

P.O. Box Q 
Year of Diversity plans events 
Dear Editor: 

We mentioned in our last letter that student government will be running a weekly Viewpoint column that will ad­dress campus issues that affect its ser­vice to the community and the student body as a whole. Thus we begin the year by addressing a topic we will all be hearing a great deal about over the next nine months, the Year of Cultural Diversity. 
We are now entering a very exciting time, one that may distinguish Notre Dame as a leading university that has challenged itself and its citizens to be­come more culturally sensitive. As we come in daily contact with various or­ganizations and people that are plan­ning the events of the Year of Cultural Diversity, we are excited about the pos­sibilities that this year holds. Students, administrators and faculty alike have devoted countless hours to provide an unparalleled selection of events and forums to educate and enrich this com­munity's understanding of the unique cultures that thrive within our world. 
This year challenges all of us to take a hard look at our own ignorance about people and customs that may be differ­ent from our own. In what other time or place will we ever again get the chance to explore in such detail and variety the different characters of our fellow man? If we somehow take a cyni­cal or apathetic attitude toward this year and this issue, then we rob our­selves of the chance to grow as human beings. The hall presidents will be re­ceiving a booklet containing a list of all the events and programs that the various committees will be presenting. In addition, distinctive posters and other media will be employed to adver­tise the various programs throughout the campus. This information will be passed on to all of you. Clearly, if we are to make this campus more ed­ucated and sensitive about the differ­ences of other cultures and peoples, then all of us must make a commitment as a community to participate in this year's events to start and continue a trend of cultural awareness. 
Finally, even though the success of 
the Year of Cultural Diversity rests upon your support, several individuals should be acknowledged for their ex­traordinary efforts in planning this year: the entire Committee on Cultural Diversity ohaired by Father Oliver Wil­liams, the five students who spent the summer organizing and designing the booklet outlining all the events: Robert Bartolo, Jr., Ramzi Baulaun, Maria Fuentes, Angela McRae, and their ad­visor Adele Lanan. ·

Burke golf course deserves respect 
To studerJ-ts, faculty and staff: 
Many of you have seen the improve­ments at the Burke Memorial Golf Course. Last year more than 17,000 rounds were played by members of the Notre Dame comrimnity, and many more rounds are played by alumni and friends of the University. The Univer­sity has a strong commitment to con­tinue to make "the Burke" an excep­tional collegiate facility. During the past two years we have built 18 new tees, modernized tee and green irriga­tion, renovated 67 traps, planted 60 trees and increased staff and equip­ment. Improvements are very costly; however, these improvements are only the start, and we are excited about the future. As you can imagine, there are numerous demands on University re­sources, and improvements can be a one-time cost with your help. 
We sincerely hope that many of you will use the facility and want to be part of the improvements to make "the Burke" an enjoyable experience. You can help by treating the course with respect, following posted rules and ob­serving golf etiquette. In doing these things your enjoyment will be en­hanced, as will the enjoyment of others. If we all help, "the Burke" can become an exceptional golf course in which we can all have pride. Thanks for helping!

Meek~ expected big victory 
Associated Press 

HOT SPRINGS, Va. -It took eight different survival tests over the course of nearly a month, but Eric Meeks said he wasn't particularly surprised by his victory in the 88th U.S. amateur Championship. 
"I've played well the past year. I kind of felt like I was going to do something,'' Meeks, 23, of Walnut, Calif., said Sun­day after he won the U.S. amateur with a 7-and-6 victory over Danny Yates. 
Meeks, a recent graduate of Arizona, had failed to qualify for the U.S. amateur in his four prehous attempts. , 
But at the beginning of Au­gust, he and 4,311 other golfers with handicaps of 3.4 or lower began sectional qualifying at 66 sites around the nation. Their goal was to make the 291-golfer field that would advance to The Homestead, a mountain resort in the George Washington Na­
tional Forest where this year's 
championship was held. 
Because of past accomplish­. ments as amateurs, nine gol­
fers were exempt from sec­
tional qualifying, so the 4,312 
were vying for 282 spots in Hot 
Springs. 
Meeks had somewhat of an 
advantage, as his sectional was 
held at his home course, the 
Friendly Hills Country Club 
near Los Angeles. 
Once Meeks made it to The 
Homestead, the next test was 
36 holes of stroke play to trim 
the 291 golfers to a 64-man grid 
for four days of match play. 
Meeks finished the on-site qual­
ifying one shot away from win­
ning medalist honors. 
In order to get to the final, a 
player had to win five matches. 
Meeks disposed of his first two 
opponents by scores of 1-up and 
4-and-3, setting the stage for what proved to be his stiffest 

challenge of the tournament. 
That came from Jay Sigel, a 
Philadelphia insurance execu­
tive who was playing in his 22nd 
U.S. amateur and who in 1983 became the last man to suc­cessfully defend his title. Meeks needed 21·holes, but he met the challenge, defeating Sigel1-up. . 
Mter that, Meeks had 1-up 
victories over Robert Gamez, 
his former Arizona teammate, 
and David Toms, a Louisiana 
State junior and the reigning 
Southeast Conference cham­
pion. . 

Then it was on to· Sunday's 
scheduled 36-hole final against 
Yates, 38, an insirance agent 
from Atlanta who was playing 
in his ninth U.S. Amateur. 
Yates had not trailed in his five 
matches, which went a com­
. bined total of 78 holes. Meeks put an end to that streak immediately.

Committee defends dis 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -Although Angel Myers' supporters in­sist that taking birth control pills caused her to test pos­itive for a steriod, the U.S. olympic Committee on Mon­day stood firmly behind its drug testing and the decision to remove her from the U.S. Olympic Swim Team. 
"We have total confidence in the integrity and validity (of the drug testing process),'' USOC spokes­man Mike Moran said. 
He said substances which birth control pills produce are very easily detectable and can be recognized im­mediately. 
"Birth control pills produce characteristics of a disqualifying substance, but the level and dosage (of the substance) is where it (disqualification) occurs," he said. 
Although the USOC will not identify the banned sub­stance involved in Myers' case, a statement released by her family said she had been informed that it was a steriod. 
Kirt Myers, who coaches 
Unsigned Solt still unhappy with Colts 

his daughter, released a statement Monday after­noon from the family's home at Americus, Ga., saying that she will appeal her removal from the U.S. team. 
"We feel that there are problems with the test and that there has been possible violations of the U.S. olym­pic Committee's protocol during the collection process of the samples and we hope to be able to present this in­formation at an administra­tive hearing this week," he said. 
He said the eadline forcer­tifying members of the U.S. olympic team is Thursday. 
"Angel firmly maintains that she has not taken any banned substance and that the test is in error," the statement said. "There must be some other expla­nation for the positive find. 
An earlier statement issued by the family said she had a prescription for Ortho­N ovum, a birth control pill which has nearly "identical characteristics to the steroid the USOC claims (Myers) was testing positive for."

NO names captains 
Special to the Observer 
Notre Dame basketball co­
ach Digger Phelps has an­
nounced the team co-captains 
for the 1988-89 season and also 
has named a former Irish cap­
tain as graduate assistant. 
Junior guards Jamere Jack­son and Joe Fredrick have been selected as Notre Dame's new co-captains. 
"There two individuals have shown by what they do on the basketball floor, by what they do in the classroom and by what they've been as people off the court -that they deserve to be co-captains of this team based on all three facets," Phelps said. 
Jackson, from Peoria, Ill., started 22 games as a sopho­more -more than any other re­turning Irish player. He averaged 5.3 points and 1.3 rebounds per game. Fredrick, of Cincinnati, Ohio, came on strong late in his sophomore campaign to average 7.7 points and 1.2 rebounds per game. 
Former Irish captain Joe Dolan has joined the coaching staff as a graduate assistant. Dolan, a 6-8, 230-pound forward for the Irish, spent the last year playing professionally in En­gland for the Manchester United team. 
A Point Pleasant, N.J., na­tive, Dolan averaged 5.9 points and 5.4 rebounds per game during his four-year career. He was a seventh-round draft choice of the New Jersey Nets in 1986 and stayed with the team until its final cut. 
In other basketball news, junior forward Keith Robinson probably won't be at full strength when the Irish open practice. He is recovering from a broken bone in his right foot . 

the media and spectator onslaught, there are some things you just can't control. Oops, maybe I have to refresh your memory on this one. Ted Turner put on an Olympic-type sports event between the U.S. and USSR in Moscow during the summer of 1986. He televised it on WTBS, and the spectacle grabbed about as much fan interest as a Braves­Padres showdown in late Sep­
tember. 
Whew, it's been fun getting 
all that off my chest, but my 
bus to Graceland, I mean 
Kalamazoo, has just arrived.

Ageless Fisk continuing assault on record books 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Carlton Fisk stands so tall and proud he al­most looks arrogant. 
Maybe it's because at age 40 he's just as strong and more productive than players half his age. And his ability to come through in a pinch is becoming legend. 
The Boston Red Sox let him go by way of free agency al­most a decade ago, assuming his best years were already over. 
And the Chicago White Sox 

tried several times to shove 
him into the background but 
keep bringing him back. 
"I have pride in myself and I pride myself in the job that I do," said the 6-foot-2 Fisk, who recently caught his 1,807th game -surpassing Hall of Farner Rick Ferrell and moving into fourth place on the all-time list for games caught. 
"He has that ability to rise to the occasion," Chicago manager Jim Fregosi said. 
"He'll break a lot of records, and by the time he's through he'll have hit more home runs than any catcher in history. There's no question in my mind he'll be in the Hall of Fame" 
Johnny Bench is the all-time leader with 327 home runs as a catcher, and Hall of Farner Yogi Berra is second with 306. 
Fisk, who has 297, would have caught Berra by now ex­cept for a broken hand that sidelined him for 2% months last spring. 
Earlier this month, Fisk passed Ferrell in a game at Detroit, going 5-for-5 for the first time in his 17-year career. 
"First time in 40 years," Fisk said. "I had never had five hits in a game little league, high school or minor leagues." 
And the broken hand he suf­fered in New York? 
"It was just another broken bone," Fisk said. "I was start­ing to swing the bat real well and I was looking to hit 30 home runs at the age of 40. No catcher at my age had ever done that." 
Between the seriousness of the injury and his age, did he consider quitting? 
"No, I never gave any thought of not playing again," he said. "It was just a matter of not knowing if I would be ef­fective when I started playing again." 
Indeed Fisk is no stranger to injuries. There was major knee con­

struction in 1974. "I was told I'd never play again." 
Later he had an elbow oper­ation. "They told me I'd never throw again." 
There were other burdens be­sides injuries. 
In 1986, with a young catcher named Joel Skinner, the White Sox decided to turn Fisk into an outfielder. Skinner couldn't hit and Fisk couldn't play left field. Skinner was traded and Fisk went back to catching. 
In 1987, it was young Ron Karkovice. Fisk was converted to backup catcher and desig­nated hitter. But Karkovice didn't hit and again Fisk went back to catching. 
How does he keep going? 

"When you're young and full of energy, you don't have to do much. You go along with what God gave you. But when you get older, you have to work harder," said Fisk, now a fit­ness advocate. 
The future? 

"That's two hours from now," said Fisk, looking up at the clock before gametime. 
"But really, I don't know. Baseball has been a majority of my life. I don't know if I can find anything that can make the same demands. That con­cerns me when I get done playing."

UK players rema1n silent 
Associated Press 
LEXINGTON--Three mem­bers of the University of Ken­tucky basketball team refused to touch on specific aspects of an NCAA investigation of the program, but all said the team has to band together. 
"We obviously have our backs against the wall," said sophomore guard Sean Sutton. "But we've got to try and put all of this in the backs of our minds. We can't sit around and soak in our sorrows." 
The Kentucky athletic depar­tment allowed Sutton, forward Eric Manuel and center LeRon Ellis to talk to reporters Wed­nesday -the first time any players have responded to questions since the NCAA probe began.

The compliments went both ways. 
"The guys coordinating it all did a great job," said Sanger, who came away with the first ticket distributed. "We got in there and there was no need to run around and fight off a crowd." 
The first group, of Sanger and company, arrived at the Joyce ACC Friday morning at 8 a.m. but were shooed away by security later that day.

This summer the Wildcats have been plagued with rumors and allegations surrounding a controversy that began when assistant basketball coach Dwane Casey sent a package in March to the father of recruit Chris Mills that allegedly con­tained $1,000. 
Casey denied sending the money, and Mills and his fa­ther, Claud, said they did not receive any. 
But an April14 story in The Los Angeles Daily News detail­ing the incident sparked an NCAA investigation into Ken­tucky's basketball program, The NCAA has already issued one allegation concerning the package and has told the school to expect about 10 more regard­ing different phases of its pro­gram any day.

NFL suspends Taylor after second offense 
Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, 
N.J. -Seven-time All-Pro linebacker Lawrence Taylor of the New York Giants, who had vowed to make this his best season, was suspended for 30 days on Monday for violating the NFL's sub­stance abuse policy for a second time. 
Coach Bill Parcells and NFL spokesman Joe Browne said Taylor was suspended after testing positive follow­ing "a recent" mandatory preseason drug test. They declined to disclose what substance Taylor was abusing. 
Taylor had acknowledged that he underwent treatment for a cocaine problem in 1986. 
He followed with his finest season as the Giants went on to win the Super Bowl, be­coming only the second de­fensive player in league his­tory to be named the NFL's most valuable player and setting a club record with 20 sacks. 
The suspension means Taylor will miss four games, including the season opener next Monday night against the Super Bowl champion Washington Redskins. 
"Obviously when you lose a player of that nature, it will have an effect," said Parcells, who learned that All-Pro Carl Banks signed a contract Monday.
"However, that player could have been hurt in the first play of practice on Wed­nesday and we'd have had to make an adjustment." 
"I am a little surprised," added Parcells, a hard-liner on drug problems. "You don't expect these types of things. I had every reason to believe everything was all right with Taylor." 
Taylor, 29, is the ninth player suspended this sum­mer for substance abuse problems. He stands to lose $62,500 a game from his $1 million salary. 
Parcells did not know whe­ther Taylor would undergo rehabilitation during his suspension. Gary Kovach, Taylor's agent, was not taking telephone calls from the media. 
Taylor was not available for comment. He must stay away from the Giants train­ing facilities during his suspension. 
Most of Taylor's team­mates declined to talk about the suspension. 
"In practices and games I couldn't see anything," cor­nerback Perry Williams said. "He was the same way he has always been, enthu­siastic. He was giving his all."

"It's been difficult," said El­lis, also a sophomore. "A lot of people aren't very high on us, for whatever reason. They don't even expect us to win more than we lose this year, and that's pretty bad. 
"Everybody will have to push themselves real hard for us to be successful because we're so young." 
And Ellis, who announced last spring that he was consid­ering a transfer, has now shelved those thoughts. 
Ellis said the team was equipped to handle contro­versy. 
"We've all been pushed to be No. 1 throughout our lives. So we're more set to handle pres­sure," he said. "I don't think we've really been affected by all this."

Wilson one of many veterans released 
Associated Press 
Quarterback Marc Wilson, who spent five years trying to become the solution to the Los Angeles Raiders' quarterback problem, was told Monday that he wasn't the answer in Green Bay either. 
But Wilson, an eight-year NFL veteran, wasn't the only "name" cut on a typical last Monday of the NFL preseason, a day of heartbreak not only for rookies and free agents, but for dozens of veterans. 
"I know what the business is like, how ruthless it can be," said 32-year-old Doug Betters, a one-time Pro Bowl defensive end and 11-year veteran waived by Miami. "I was just an insurance policy the last two years. I don't think I was ever given a chance to compete for a starting job." 
Among the other veterans to go were a group with recent Super Bowl rings: tight end Clint Didier and running back Keith Griffin of the defending champion Washingon Redskins; wide receiver Stacy Robinson, guard Chris Godfrey and safety Greg Lasker of the New York Giants' 1986 cham­pions; and wide receiver Keith Ortego and defensive back Reggie Phillips, who returned an interception 26 yards for a touchdown in Chicago's 46-10 Super Bowl victory over New England after the 1985 season. 
Among the other cuts were Paul McFadden, whose 91 field goals were more than any Philadelphia Eagle in history; strong safety Lester Lyles, a two-year starter for the New York Jets; wide receiver Frankie Neal, Green Bay's second-leading receiver as a rookie last year with 36 recep­tions; wide receiver Mike Jones, New Orleans' leading receiver in 1986; and three other Super Bowl veterans: running back Gene Lang and defensive back Steve Wilson of Denver and defensive lineman Jerome Sally of the Giants' 1986 team, who was cut by the Colts. 

In addition, veteran tight end Kellen Winslow, once an All­Pro, was suspended by San Diego for refusing to play. Winslow, who suffered a severe knee injury in 1984, said he was unfit; the Chargers said he was fit. 
Cincinnati waived their rights to two holdouts, fullback Larry Kinnebrew and defen­sive back Robert Jackson, leaving them free to sign with anyone. 
Center Mike Baab was traded to New England for a draft choice by Cleveland, which also cut veteran defen-

Rain wins at Open 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -The 1988 U.S. 

Open started the way last 
year's tournament ended-with 
rain. 
Steady showers washed out 

opening day Monday at the Na­
tional Tennis Center 90 minutes 
after play began. 
Only five matches were com­

pleted, and only one of those 
involved a seeded player, No. 
11 Zina Garrison's 6-0, 6-3 vic­
tory over Nicole Provis. 
Second-seeded Mats 

Wilander was leading former 
NCAA champion Greg Holmes 
6-2, 6-1, 1-2 when play was 
halted. 
No other men's seed got to 

play a single point. 
The wet scene was reminis­

cent of the final Sunday at last 
year's Open when rain forced 
the men's final between Ivan 
Lendl and Mats Wilander to be 
delayed until Monday. 
Garrison beat the rain by 

beating Provis in just 59 
minutes. 
"I was really nervous to play the first match on the first day of the tournament," she said. "I didn't want to be the first seed to go out." 
Garrison had reason to be 

wary of Provis, an 18-year-old 
Australian who reached the 
semifinals at the French Open 
this year. But Provis, ranked 
34th in the world, barely 
avoided a shutout. 
Garrison won the first 11 games before Provis staged a mini-rally and pulled to within 5-3 in the second set. But Gar­rison broke back in the next game to end the match. 
"I've been playing some really good tennis, although my ranking doesn't show it," she said. "I've reached the semis or quarters of most of the tour­naments I've played in. 
"For the first time in my life, I'm totally committed to being a professional tennis player. I feel good about that and I feel good about myself." 
Lend! is seeking his fourth straight Open title, but he is having an off year. If he doesn't win here, it will be the first time since 1983 that he has gone through a year without winning at least one Grand Slam title. 
While Lendl would settle for one major title in 1988, Steffi Graf wants to win them all. 
If she wins the Open, the 19­year-old West German will be­come the first player since Margaret Court in 1970 to sweep the four Grand Slam events in the same year.

Nebraska closing gap on No. 1 Florida State 
Associated Press 
Following Nebraska's 23-14 victory over Texas A&M in the Kickoff Classic on Saturday night, Coach Tom Osborne was asked if he thought the second­ranked Cornhuskers deserved to be No. 1. 
"I'll let the voters decide," Osborne said. 
The voters in the Associated Press' first regular-season col­lege football poll decided Mon­day that Nebraska is still No. 2 -but by a much closer margin than in the preseason rankings. 
Florida State remained No. 1 by receiving 41 of 53 first-place votes and 1,032 of a possible 1,060 points from a nationwide panel of sports writers and sportscasters. Nebraska received four first-place votes and 939 points. 
In the preseason poll, Florida State led 44-2 in first-place bal­lots -60 voters participated -and 1,161-952 in total points. 
"It's something I've always wanted -unbeaten, untied, un-

ever been around. Yes, he might be a potential superstar, but he knows we have other people who need to carry the ball, too." 
Two of those people figure to be Johnson and Banks. Holtz has not indicated which of his top fullbacks will start against scored upon, No. 1 in the na­tion," joked Florida State Co­ach Bobby Bowden, whose team opens next Saturday night against defending na­tional champion Miami, ranked No. 6 this week. "If I didn't have to play that schedule (the Seminoles also face nationally ranked Clem­son and Michigan State in Sep­tember), I would be happy. If it wasn't for the games, I'd have it made." 
By losing the Kickoff Classic, the only game played thus far, Texas A&M fell out of the Top Ten, slipping from lOth to 11th. 
This week's 20 ranked teams are the same as in the preseason poll, but there was some minor shuffling in the or­der. 
Oklahoma held onto third place with one first-place vote and 845 points, Clemson remained fourth with three first-place ballots and 832 points, and UCLA is again No. 5 with two first-place votes and 754 points. 
Michigan, but you can bet the other will be in the game not too long after the first play. 
"We consider them both starters," Strong noted. ''They've got a lot of talent, and with the type of running we do, we need two fullbacks ready to run." 
Johnson scored 11 times on 78 carries last year, or nearly once every seven times he carried the ball. He picked up 366 yards, while Banks rushed for 212 yards on 54 carries.

Irish running backs will soon be scoring real touchdowns 
By MARTY STRASEN 
Sports Editor 

Every practice the Notre Dame ballcarriers are sup­posed to picture themselves scoring touchdowns against Michigan, Mia111i and the other Irish opponents. 
Chances are the real TD's are on their way, although in­juries to Anthony Johnson and Tony Brooks are letting some of the younger backs get in on the action in recent workouts. 
"We try to instill in our run­ning backs the idea that they can be great," Notre Dame running backs coach Mike Strong said. "We try to make every run in practice as close to a game-situation as possi­ble." 
Riding an exercise bicycle is not Brooks' idea of a game­situation, but the sophomore back-up tailback peddled for 30 minutes Monday to keep off the left foot he fractured in prac­tice late last week. He said he 
' hopes to be running plays sometime this week in a padded shoe. "It's not a lot of pain or anything, but it's something you know is there," Brooks said. "The shoe has reinforced steel in it, and the insole will shift the pressure when I run. 
I'm really motivated to get back out there." 
Johnson has a minor ankle in­jury, and also is expected to take the field sometime this week. 
Freshman Rodney Culver 

from Detroit has been working behind starting tailback Mark Green in practice, along with (oh no, not again) Ricky Wat­ters. Yes, Watters saw time at tailback Monday after making the move to flanker at the end of the spring to try to fill the gap left by Tim Brown's graduation. 
Irish head coach Lou Holtz said he plans to keep Watters in the flanker slot if possible. 
Culver has made the most of his opportunity, gaining 56 yards on 17 carries in Satur-

Several students waited long hours at the JACC  for  juniors, Wednesday  for  sophomores  and  
Monday to purchase tickets for the upcoming  Thursday for freshmen. Brian O'Gara details the  
football season. Sales of tickets continue today  hoopla surrounding the tickets below.  

Stubborn residents of Pangborn buy first season football tickets 

By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 

Section 28. Row 18. Seat 22. 
That was the first ticket sold to a Notre Dame student Mon­day during the opening day of football ticket distribution. And it was that seat and several like it at the 50-yard line that in­spired approximately 100 seniors, led by Pangborn resi­dents Warren Sanger, Bob Heckler, John Delaney and Bob Costello, to camp out at Gate 10 of the Joyce ACC. 
The quest for 50-yard line seats could potentially create an anxious and restless crowd 
day's scrimmage. Only Green ran for more. 
At fullback, sophomore Braxston Banks has been car­rying most of the load in Johnson's absence, while soph­omore Ryan Mihalko has been working behind Banks. 
But when this backfield is at full strength, it ranks as one of the top groups in the nation. In fact The Sporting News tabbed the Notre Dame backfield best in the country. 
"They're professional writ­ers, they said it and I can deal with it," said Brooks of the rating. "Seriously, "though, I'd say if not the best, at least one of the best. We don't have any superstars, and that makes everyone give 100 percent all the time." 
Green has led the Irish in rushing each of the last two years with 406 and 861 yards, respectively, in his sophomore and junior years. The senior tri-captairi has great hands as well as great moves, finishing second only to Brown in recep­tions the last two seasons. 
"Mark Green is one of the better college running backs in the country," Strong said. "He has great work habits and is the most unselfish player I've

as the 1:30 p.m. window­opening time approaches, but ticket manager Bubba Cunnin­gham had nothing but praise for the crowd outside Gate 10 Monday. 
"I'd like to thank the senjors," said Cunningham as the line of approximately 400 moved past him methodically as the windows opened. "The students were really good about keeping things in order and keeping this place clean." 
Once the doors did open, only 10 people per line were allowed in the lobby to purchase tickets at the five windows open. Not only did this eliminate any type of mob-like crowding to reach the windows first, but it also allowed the ticket distributers to hear the students purchasing tickets. 
The line seemed shorter than those of previous years, but it stayed consistent in size throughout the afternoon as students made their way over after classes ended and into the evening. 
"In previous years this day has been kind of a mess," said Jim Murphy, Joyce ACC Crowd Control Supervisor. "But this has been the best I've seen. We
