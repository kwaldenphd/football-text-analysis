[continued from page 1] 
lated how now J-Boards worked 
with in their halls. Keenan's 
J-Board is carefully selected and
screened by the hall staff. The rector respects the board and it is 
very active within the hall.
It was the general agreement of the Hall Judicial Board that if the rector did not respect the J ·Board, then it would have no power within 
the hall. The representative from Alumni

<!Xplained that their J-Board works, but that every case must go to the rector first. Farley and Breen-Phillips representatives both stated their boards were not used to hear 
cases but were used for other purposes. In Sorin the J-Board hears no cases because the hall 
staff will not go to them. · After finishing their discussion, the J-Board chairmen decided to form a committee to find out what 
the students want from their hall J-Boards. Dane said that if "com­
promises are made everyone can run their own systems under set-down guidelines."

Supreme Court to hear arguments in Bakke case 
WASHINGTON [AP) -The Sup­reme Court said Tuesday it will hear argumentS Oct. 12 in a case many legal experts believe will lead to the court's most important decision on race relations since segregation was outlawed 23 years ago. 
The case could decide the fate of special programs in education and business that benefit blacks and other minorities discriminated a­gainst in the past. 
Such programs have been praised by supporters as "affirm­ative action" and scorned by others who claim they foster a type of "reverse discrimination," against whites. 
Allan Bakke, a white Sunnyvale, CA, resident, believes he was discriminated against by the Uni­versity of California at Davis Med­ical School because the school admitted 16 allegedly less qualified minority students ahead of him. 
The -California Supreme Court agreed with Bakke, ruling last October that the medical school's policy of admitting "special stu­dents" over white students who were more qualified was unconsti­tutional. The university is appeal­ing that decision. 
The Bakke case was listed on an oral argument schedule for 10 a.m. on Tuesday, Oct.-12. One hour has been allotted for arguements, 30 minutes for each side. 
Former Watergate special pros­ecutor Archibald Cox, who argued many cases before the Supreme Court while serving in the Justice Department as solicitor general, will argue for the university. Bakke will be represented by San Francis­co attorney Reynold Colvin.

SMC complains about water 
bv Maureen Sajbel 

Senior Staff Reporter 
Many St. Mary's students have noticed a change in the school's water in the past t,wo weeks. The water, according to some, has an iron taste to it and leaves a rust-colored residue in sinks, tubs, and toilets. 
"Every time I wash my hands I smell rust," complained one LeMans resident. "The water tastes terrible and the ice in the dining hall even has a yellowish color," she added. Some dorm residents have also complained about the yellowish stains left on clothes after using the school's machines. 
These conditions, while they may cause an inconvenience, are harm­less and temporary, according to Frank Koontz, director of maintain­

Wise. judge defeated 
MADISON Wise. [AP] -Dane County Judge Archie Simonson, whose remarks linking sexual per­missiveness with rape created a furor in this liber;tl university communmity, was defeated in a recall election yesterday by an attorney with strong feminist back­ing. 
With 100 of Dane Cr 11ty's 137 wards reporting, Mori Krueger had rolled up 15,507 votes to Simonson's 11,735. 
The judge, whose regular six­year term expires next April, took an early lead in rural areas but quickly fell to second place as Madison ballots were counted. 
Simonson was forced into the recall election by a 35,000 sig­nature petition drive after he made comments from the bench linking rape and women's ~lothing. 
Ms. Krueger, who spent more than $15,000 in the campaign backed by area feminists, led the field of six candidates. There will be no runoff election. 
In third place was Daniel Mos­ser, an assistant family court commissioner, with 8,933 votes. 
Three other Madison attorneys were also running. William Brad­ford Smith had 5,101, while Robert Burr had 2,994 and Worth Piper 1,982. 
Simonson, who voted early in the day at the same school where three youths allegedly raped a 16-year­old girl last year, drew national attention and the anger of local feminists for his comments from the bench !turing a hearing in the case. 
The judge said during the cam­paign that his comments were rhetorical and he does not person­ally believe Madison's sexually permissive climate or provocative women's clothing makes rape a normal reacion in a young man.
