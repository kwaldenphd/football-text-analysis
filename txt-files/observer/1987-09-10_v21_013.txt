Businessman, radical 'practically' agree 
As a dedicated, narrow-minded business major, I feel it is my responsibility to take a class in the Arts and Letters college at least once a semester, to force my views on people, if for no other reason. 
gested they channel that enthusiasm into more productive groups, that actually do something for people. 
I was speechless. He was a Practicalist. So am I. So what if he prefers an earring, and I a suit and tie. We see eye-to-eye on political issues. For those that are unaware, Prac­ticalism is a political pursuasion, like Liberalism or Conservativism. The basis for this ideology is to do something that works. 
I have complaints about liberals and, yes, even conservatives. In my opinion, neither really work, although liberalism less than con­servativism, since the market is working properly, thanks to deregulation. Anyhow, I have critisms. 
For instance, a liberal policy built large housing products for the inner city blacks in Chicago, in the name of helping them rise in society. 
We now have thirty-three high rise prisons which have effectively segregated the blacks and trapped them in crime-ridden ghettos with little hope of ever raising their living standard. 
Or conservatives, with their large defense spending. And their support of corrupt regimes over the years. What does their inef­ficient spending help, the economy? It cer-

tainly does not the ghetto dwellers, who could probably use safer, better-run schools. 
Practicalism does not disregard the social contributions of either conservatives or liberals. Instead, we concentrate on what works. Welfare is great, but not if it creates dependent, unmotivated bums. Pay them to work, and give them a self image as well. 
Some defense spending is needed, but I think we can help more young men and women if we can spend a few billion less on high tech tanks that do not even work. 
Now, on to the steps of the Capitol. Keep in mind that Practicalism's objective is to do things that work. Working together works. Someone should tell that to the branches of our government. And the men and women of Congress. And the states, for that matter. 
If a sixties radical and a business-prone en­trepreneur can agree on mutual respect in the name of Practicalism, maybe those that we look up to in Washington can as well.

Molestation charges called ridiculous 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES The matriarch of the now-defunct McMartin Pre-School sugges­ted Wednesday that "evil­minded people" were respon­sible for molestation accusations against her grandson and daughter. 
Virginia McMartin, 80, also ridiculed claims that animals were tortured and dismem­bered at the Manhattan Beach nursery school. 
"Most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of," she said when asked about allegations that her grandson, Raymond Buck­ey, killed small animals in front of terrified toddlers. 
"He always had a great love of animals," she said. 
McMartin, once a defendant in the case, spent her second day on the stand taping her tes­timony for the trial of Buckey, 29, and Peggy McMartin Buck­ey, 60. 
They are charged with 100 counts of molestation and con­spiracy in the 4-year-old case. 
Though the defense phase of the trial may not come up for six months to a year, the un­usual taping was permitted outside of the presence of the jury because of the witness' advanced age. Defense attor­neys had.said they feared she might not live long enough to testify. 
If McMartin is healthy when the defense is ready for her tes­timony, she will go before jurors herself and the videotape will not be used, at­torneys said.

Iraq, Iran continue Gulf attacks 
Associated Press 
MANAMA, Bahrain -Iraq said its warplanes attacked Iranian cities, power plants, factories and oil centers Wed­nesday in retaliation for at­tacks on Kuwait and to force Iran to accept a U.N.­sponsored cease-fire. 
Iran said 105 civilians were killed and vowed to avenge them. 
The raids came two days before United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is due to ar­rive in Tehran on a mission to end the 7-year-old war. 
Iran said it shot down three Iraqi jets and captured one pilot when groundfire hit his French-built Mirage over the western city of Arak. Iraq ac­knowledged losing one plane. 
Shipping executives worried that Iranian commandos in speedboats might stage an­other round of retaliatory raids on foreign merchant ships in the Persian Gulf, where U.S. warships have been guarding Kuwaiti tankers against attack by Iran. 
"Iraq today avenged Iranian attacks on Kuwait in a series of powerful and destructive strikes staged by large num­bers of Iraqi fighter jets on 13 different targets deep in Iran," said military communiques quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Cyprus. 
The communiques said Iraq will "continue its at­tacks...until the Iranian regime accepts to live with the people of the region in peace and puts an end to the war" in accordance with· the July 20 
U.N. cease-fire resolution. 
Kuwait last week accused Iran of firing a Chinese-made Silkworm missile at its south­ern coast on Friday and ap-

pealed for urgent U.N. action. No casualties were reported. 
INA said the Iraqi warplanes bombed 11 cities and two other industrial targets. It said later that Iran troops shelled the southern city of Basra and the northern border town of Khanaqin with long-range ar­tillery. 
Iraq's air force, which out­numbers Iran's depleted air force by around 8-1, flew 122 combat missions and helicop­ter gunships flew 43 more during the "day of revenge," INA said. 
INA earlier said Iraqi planes hit two unidentified "large maritime targets," Tuesday night near Iran's Kharg Island oil terminal in the northern gulf. Iraq employs the term "maritime target" to describe commercial vessels, usually tankers. 

Tickets 
continued from page 1 
iD numbers were randomly se­lected from more than 2.300 entries, Blount said, "the way it is set up now, yes, (the stu­dent body) would think it was random. The entire list wasn't random but most of it was." 
Blount said the policy will soon be revised. "I think that in some cases such as this one, it perhaps is not fair. And just because it's been done in the past, it should not necessarily continue to be done in the fu­ture," she said. 
Both Blount and Hering, however, said they will use their tickets for the Michigan game. 
The policy also recommends that two tickets be distributed to the student body president. 
Pat Cooke, student body president, said he had never heard of the policy. "I didn't know the policy existed," he said. 
"The policy will be revised before the next game," he said. "There won't be 'i policy grant­ing tickets to anyone in student government or the SUB." 
Blount .>aid the SUB won't handle a lottery for the next game, unless its policy is revised in time. "It's been too much of a hassle," she said. 
Cook said the next lottery will be run from his office. "Hope­fully, we will be able to avoid a lot of the confusion that took place," he said. 
"Looking back, we feel· we should have published the policy ahead of time," Blount said. 
But, Hering said, "there hadn't been problems with it in the past."

Back to dixie cups and string? Because of the installation of a new phone system at the U. of Wisconsin campus, dormitory resi­dents will be charged 9 cents per local call instead of a flat fee for unlimited usage.

Talk about prior restraint. But don't print anything about it at Tulsa Junior Col­lege, where an 11-year-old First Amendment war may finally be coming to a head. The state legislature has passed a "legislative warning," not naming T JC, but inspired by its actions against The Horizon, the campus paper. Those actions include a ban on all editorials and letters to the editor; a ban on "undue" criticism of public officials; reduc­tion of print runs·from 5,000 to 100 issues and limiting of distribution to journalism clas­srooms; and mandatory prior review by the communication office.

Even more direct censorship was tried at the U. of Arizona by several Kappa Sigma members: They went out and stole most of a day's press run of the Daily Wildcat.

You can't hide lying eyes. The U. of Tennessee is considering a new way to detect drug use among its athletes: eye tests. Offi­cials say a pupilometer test, which is cheaper than a urinalysis test, uses a small flashlight to chart the response of eyes to light. It can indicate whether drugs such as cocaine, ma­rijuana, PCP and heroin have been used in the past three to four days. The new test won't replace the urinalysis test; it will indicate whether a follow-up test is needed, says one official. -The National On-Campus Report

Western fires continue blazing 
Associated Press 

Thick smoke and changing weather hindered efforts Wed­nesday to contain the last big forest fires still burning in the West, where more than 1,000 square miles are charred, and some fires were spreading again. 
"It's sad to see Mother Na­ture doing this," lamented Cal­ifornia National Guardsman Dennis Berry. 
A layer of cool, humid air that had been holding dense smoke close to the ground and not fanning the flames in nor­thern California and southern Oregon appeared to be lifting, with temperatures climbing, said California fire informa­tion officer Steve Smith. 
There was a chance of thun­derstorms in Oregon, which would kick up wind, said Kathy Aplin of the Oregon Unified Co­ordinating Group. 
In Washington, steep terrain allowed burning logs to roll past fire breaks on the Olym­pic Peninsula. 
In California, 76 firefighters have been injured, dozens suf­fering from smoke inhalation, said Art Wirtz at the Sacramento fire command center. An additional 30 firefighters had been injured in Oregon. Three have died in vehicle accidents, two blamed on the dense smoke. 
Smoke continued to prevent the use of aircraft to drop water and fire retardant in Oregon, fire spokesman Ron DeHart said. Fog grounded water-dumping aircraft Wed­nesday in Washington. 
The smoke was so bad in some parts of northern Califor­nia that doctors equated breathing to smoking more than three packs of cigarettes a day, said Art Wirtz of the Sacramento Fire Command Information Center. 
The force of nearly 22,000 firefighters on duty is "the greatest mobilization of

The College Placement Coucil also reports the merchan­dising and services industry provided more than half of the job offers to humanities grads. Meanwhile, grads in technical fields, especially petroleum engineering, faced a much tighter job market. They experienced an 82% drop in job offers and a 6.6% decline in the average salary. -The National On­Campus Report 
A Protest at State University of New York­Stony Brook, over campus housing condi­tions, took the form of a here-today, gone­today, here-tomorrow Tent City. Campus police and protesters, predominantly graduate students, fell into a repeating pat­tern of torn-down tents, resurrected tents, and finally, arrested students-over 40 in all. Pending the outcome of a federal court chal­lenge to the university's actions, a judge has ordered the students not to sleep in the tents, and the school not to interfere with them during the daytime. -The National On­Campus Report

Quadriplegic shoots his newlywed wife 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON -A quadriplegic accused of killing his bride with a wheelchair-mounted gun fired by a string in his teeth was apparently upset be­cause she was planning to go to California, officials said Wednesday. 
Bertha Mae Burns, 37, was shot in the neck find died Mon­day night at a b'ar where she and her husband of two weeks had been talking, police said. Witnesses told police that Burns had placed the string in her husband's mouth. 
Police Sgt. J.C. Mosier said detectives had filed a murder charge against her husband, James Burns, but that he had not been taken into custody. Burns had been allowed to return home after the shooting pending a review of the case by a judge, homicide Sgt. Dave Collier said Wednesday. 
He was expected to appear before a judge Thursday, said court coordinator Mary McClinton. 
Burns, who was left a quad­riplegic after being shot by a previous wife, had gone to several bars Monday looking for his wife, Collier said. 
"He was upset. She had told him she was going to Califor-

nia" where her daughter lived, Collier said. 
"According to witnesses, they were sitting there talking in quiet tones," said Detective 
A.J. Toepel. "She then got up and put a string in his mouth and he jerked his head back once and the gun went off." 
Burns told police he jerked his head back accidentally, Mosier said. Three shots fired from the apparatus hit Burns, who was sitting directly across from her husband. 
Police described the appara­tus as a 9mm pistol mounted on a small board that the man had across his lap. A string ran around two small screws in the board with one end running to the trigger and the other to his mouth. A shoebox that covered the apparatus was taken off before the shooting. 
Mosier said police don't know why Burns put the string in her husband's mouth. 
Mosier said Burns gave a statement to police in which he said he wanted his wife to kill him, but that "she talked me into killing her." Mosier said Burns also suspected his wife of infidelity.

WASHINGTON-The moral and ethical issues confronting the nation in dealing with AIDS are as difficult as the scientific and medical ones, Surgeon General Everett Koop told a presidential commission Wed­nesday. 
One of those problems, he told the opening session of President Reagan's AIDS commission, is the growing minority of doctors and den­tists refusing to treat patients

who have AIDS. 
"The good conduct of the majority does not in any way release us from facing the un­professional conduct of a fear­ful and irrational minority," declared Koop. 
He contended that "such conduct threatens the very fabric of health care in this country. What shall we do to prevent that from happening? We need some answers before this deadly virus further weakens the ethics of medical

practice in the United States.' 
Perhaps the most potentially serious social problem, he said, is related to the fact that AIDS" is becoming the partic­ular scourge of people who are young, black and Hispanic." 
"How tragic that is for them, but also how tragic that is for America. This country is only now emerging from two decades of turmoil during which we have tried to correct the social injustices of the past. 
before we increase patrols." 
The student who was dragged out his front door said, "They seem more concerned about breaking up parties be­cause they know we won't be around next year -that's how it seems to us." Off-campus students admit that the parties sometimes get out of control. "The worst stud nts that come to parties are on-campus fresh­men and sophomores," Rowe said. He said they don't have enough consideration for the neighbors. "People who live off-campus have to think about these things," he said, because they have to deal with angry neighbors after the party-goers have retreated to campus. 
Out-of-control parties, of course, draw the police and subsequent complaints about the police. Students com­plained about occasions where police entered homes without warrants. Two students men­tioned an incident in which a 21-year-old was asked to step outside and then was arrested for public drunkeness. 
But students also said they recognized a responsibility to be good neighbors as well. Basement parties don't bother the neighbors or draw the police. "The police won't bust a party that's in control," Rowe said. "What's worth their while is a huge party not in control where they can make arrests and make money." 
Rowe cited the need for stu­dents at off-campus parties to drink more responsibly. "What gets people in trouble is when they get belligerant and start mouthing off to the cops," he said.

Students have also expressed a desire for more police protec­tion. Dallova said police were reluctant to respond to his har­rassment call, questioning him as to whether it was really nee­essary to send someone out. Other students said they wished the police would show a greater presence by sending more patrol cars through the area. But many students don't expect increased police protection because of the way students conduct their parties. Students claim a South Bend police officer said one night at a party raid that "you've got to tone down your parties

Drunk driving policy not the solution 
The letter has finally appeared in the mailboxes of Notre Dame students. It contains the approved recommen­dations of a committee formed to dis­courage students from driving under the influence of alcohol. The sanctions go into effect immediately. 
Unfortunately, the solution will not correct the problem. 
The committee proposed a way for the University "to respond in a very special way to the problem of students who drive under the influence of alco­hol." What is that "special way"? Four pages of sanctions. 
The University is right in trying to solve the problem. Despite last year's tragedies, students continue to drink and drive. 
The administration's solution to that problem, however, fails to provide a real solution for several reasons. First, the committee's recommended action is presented in a negative way. At the end of the cover letter, the student is faced with four pages of "sanctions." Granted, the administration is looking out for students' interests by ensuring they go to proper counseling. However, the administration is cloaking the counseling in the sanction of loss of driving privileges; hence, counseling becomes a way to punish students rather than a way to help them. 

Second, the sanctions that are im­posed against a student for drinking and driving "off campus" are a form of double jeopardy. Students not only face a possible fine or prison sentence by the judicial system, but they also face a punishment by the University --the loss of on-campus driving and parking privileges for the first offense and suspension for at least one semes­ter for the second offense. The Univer­sity should only punish students for drinking and driving on campus. Let the city or county authorities punish students when they violate the law off campus. 
Third, the committee has failed to offer positive ways to prevent students from drinking and driving. For exam­ple, the committee has recommended no formal programs such as a "Desig­nated Driver" program. It has not of­fered to continue a program such as the "Buzz Bus" service, designed to bring students safely to their homes on the weekends. It has offered no way for a intoxicated student to call Secur­ity or someone at the University as an alternative to getting behind the wheel drunk or with someone who is. 
In essence, the University's policy deals with drunk driving after it oc­curs, rather than dealing with the prob­lem when it should --before it occurs.

Security needs new approach 
Dear Editor: 

I'm writing in support of Victor Krebs' September 7 column concerning student-security relationships. Mr. Krebs wrot<'! about instances in which he was undestrvingly treated rudely by security guards, and suggested that there is a fundamental lack of trust which prevents them from being as helpful as they could be. I hope to lend support to the idea that something is wrong here, and needs to be changed. 
I, too, have had problems with guards. One particular instance, much like Mr. Krebs', opened my eyes. I had rented a car with two friends, and came back to campus to pick up some gear. Being a naive freshman, I assumed that the gate guard would be anxious to help, and receptive to my desire to drive on campus. When we got to the gate, however, we encountered only insen­sitivity, unhelpfulness, and open hos­tility. The guard's excuse for not letting us pass was that there was no sticker on the car. He remained insistent on this point even after we told him that it was a rental. He even said to us, "park, come over here, and we'll talk about it, but there's absolutely no way I'm letting you on campus." This ir­rationality stunned me. I'm not arguing with the policy per se, but trying to make a point that the guard was com­pletely unjustified to treat us the way he did.

I have several other stories, but I'm sure that all the readers have their own, so I'll get to the point. Security guards are University employees, and as such exist to serve the students. When, in the performance of their jobs, they be­come unreasonable hinderances to the students, something must be changed. That something is this: the attitude of some of the security guards must be altered, from that of having an oppos­ing relationship,to that of having a working one. The guards must trust that the effective majority of students want no problems, it merely wants to go its own way and live harmoniously with the rest of the University. 
In my search for the right college during my senior year of high school, I read an independent article about Notr~ Dame, one which tried to give an objective view of student life. It in­cluded an interesting student inter­view. In it, the student said something to the effect that while people were al­ways talking about the Notre Dame family, it seemed to him that the ad­ministration and its arm, the security, were like the evil step-parents, and that the students were treated as the ir­responsible adolescent brats. 
While this does, unfortunately, apply to too many security guards, my hope is that a change can be brought about. If all of the guards were like a few others whom I've dealt (the sincere, helpful, courteous ones), then Notre Dame would be a much happier place.

NL roundup 

Ryan downs Giants 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON -Houston's Nolan Ryan struck out 16 batters in eight innings as the Astros defeated San Francisco 4-2 and moved within 41;2 games of the National League West Division­leading Giants. 
Ryan's 16 strikeouts, the most he's ever had in the NL, boosted his total to 226 for the season in only 176 innings. He supassed Seattle's Mark Langston with 222 to take over the major league lead and also overtook teammate Mike Scott, who started the game leading the NL with 210 strikeouts. 
Mike Atdrete was Ryan's 13th strikeout victim to end the seventh inning, giving Ryan 4,500 career strikeouts. 
Ryan, who extended his major league record to 172 games with 10 or more strikeouts, fanned 10 of the last 12 batters he faced, including the last five. It was his highest strikeout total since he struck out 16 in 1979, when he was with the California Angels. 
Dave Smith pitched the ninth for Houston to gain his 23rd save. 
The Astros took a 4-0 lead on Ryan's second career game­winning hit and a double by Gerald Young in the second in­ning, and Kevin Bass' two-run homer over the left field fence in the third inning. 
Mets 11, Phillies 5 
NEW YORK -Darryl Straw­berry hit a pair of two-run homers and Mookie Wilson added a three­run shot Wednesday night as the New York Mets defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 11-5. 
Strawberry's first homer came 
with Keith Hernandez on base 
and began a seven-run sixth in­
ning that was capped by Wilson's 
eighth home run of the season. 
Late in the game, Strawberry hit 
his 34th home run, this one with 
Dave Magadan on base, his fourth multiple-homer game of the season. 

The Mets' right fielder also doubled in the seventh and now has 62 extra-base hits this year, breaking the club mark of 61 set by Tommie Agee in 1970. 
Rick Aguilera, 8-2, went seven­plus innings to gain his fifth straight victory, although he needed .help from Jesse Orosco. Shane Rawley, 17-8, allowed five runs on six hits in five-plus in­nings. 
Reds 4, Dodgers 1 

CINCINNATI-Tom Browning held Los Angeles to just two hits and Barry Larkin knocked in two runs Wednesday hight as the Cin­cinnati Reds defeated the Dodgers 4-1. 
Browning started the game by pitching five perfect innings before Mike Devereaux doubled down the right field line to lead off the sixth. After Devereaux scored on an errant pickoff at­tempt by Browning, Steve Sax

Lambert seeking improvement despite ankle injury to Waller 
By THERESA KELLY Sports Writer 
Talk about tough. The Irish women's volleyball team travels to Michigan tonight to face the Spartans, then moves on to the Mid-American Classic for the weekend. 
Now, that sounds like a reasonable schedule, but that Mid-American Classic features two of the best teams in the country, Illinois and Southern Cal, along with Illinois State. 
To make matters worse, the Irish were struck with a big blow during Tuesday's prac­tice. Junior middle blocker Mary Kay Waller went down with a sprained ankle and is ex­pected to miss two weeks. 
Coach Art Lambert was forced to rearrange his rota­tion. Zanette Bennett will take over for Waller in the middle, Colleen Wagner and Kathy Baker will play left front, and Gretchen Kraus will move up to right front. 
"We'll proceed from there to challenge some of the best in the land," said Lambert. "I'm confident we can do a good job." 
The Wolverines have a young program, but they have to be tough in the Big 10 conference. 
"They're just where we were a few years back," said Lam­bert. "They are becoming a fine team." 
"Every Big 10 match is im­portant," continued Lambert. "If we can get a bid for the na­tional tourney, it looks good to have beaten Big 10 teams. It's known as one of the best leagues in the country." 
Another Big 10 team, Illinois, leads the field in the Mid­American Classic. The Illini, along with Southern Cal, are among the top ten teams in the nation. 
"If we play to our capabili­ties, I think we'll surprise some people," said Lambert. 
"If we play the way we have been playing, we will not do well at all." 

Laudner lifts Twins over Sox; Tigers take two from O's 
Associated Press 
MINNEAPOLIS -Tim Laud­ner led off the bottom of the ninth inning with a 428-foot homer Wednesday night, giving the Minnesota Twins a 2-1 victory over the Chicago White Sox. 
Laudner's game-winning homer, his 16th of the year, came on an 0-2 pitch from Jim Winn, 4-6. It was only the second hit of the game for the Twins off three White Sox pitchers. 
The victory, coupled with Oakland's 11-7 win over Texas, maintained Minnesota's three­game lead in the American League West. 
Frank Viola, 15-8, pitched a six-hitter for the victory, blank­ing the White Sox after a game-

Lambert referred to the team's loss at Indiana, saying that the team did not take ad­vantage of their opportunities. 
"It was like having fifteen scoring opportunities inside the twenty-yard line and not taking advantage of a single one," he said. 
"I was displeased with the In­diana match, and the girls were, too. We can be competi­tive with any team on our schedule, we just have to play the best we can." The Classic will· test the ability of Lam­bert's team, and despite injur­
•

ies, the team continues to im­prove. 
"We've been working on trying to improve our tempo, getting our timing right,'' Lam­bert added. "We are working on the transition from offense to defense--our transition has been pathetic." 
"We have made progress this year," Lambert said. "If you want to be the best, you have to play with the best."

Buck agrees to terms 
Associated Press 
CINCINNATI -Mter missing all of training camp in a con­tract holdout, first-round draft choice Jason Buck expected to take his time getting ready for his National Football League debut with the Cincinnati Ben­gals. 
His timetable was thrown off Wednesday morning when he arrived at the Bengals' Spinney Field training complex for team meetings and practice. 
"I was really surprised. They just said 'you're playing' this morning,'' Buck said at the end of workouts Wednesday after­noon. 
The Bengals released nine­year veteran defensive end Ross Browner to make room for Buck, who will be used in pass rushing situations against the Indianapolis Colts in Sun­day's season opener, Bengals Coach Sam Wyche said.

ter of execution for each one." 
Also still in the quarterback picture for the Irish is junior Steve Belles. Belles held off a challenge by Pete Graham in the spring drills, but the youth movement might catch up to him this season. 
Belles does have the advan­tage of experience--he ap­peared in five games last season. Belles also shares time with the second team offense in practice, alternating with Kent Graham and Tony Rice. 
Mter Andrysiak, anything could happen with the quarter­back position this season. But as Rice points out, the compe­tition hasn't affected the prog­ress. 
"All the quarterbacks work together," says Rice. "I like it a lot. We help each other out any way we can." 
Browner's release surprised many Bengals players. Wyche said earlier in the week that Browner would see consider­able playing time as a backup for second-year pro Jim Skow. 
Browner, first-round draft choice from Notre Dame in 1978, recorded six-and-a-half sacks in 1986, a dropoff from the previous year when he had nine sacks. 
Eleven-year defensive end Eddie Edwards, Browner's close friend and former room­mate had thought Browner's position was safe when he sur­vived the final roster cuts Monday. 
"I was kind of expecting that me and Ross were going to be around this year," Edwards said. "When they signed Buck, I knew that someone had to go because they had already said they were only keeping six de­fensive linemen.... 
"(Buck) is going to have to learn the defense a lot quicker. I think there will be a little more pressure on him to per­form."

Irish receivers 


Brown not only air weapon 
With the loss of starter Joel Williams and Dan Tanczos at the tight end spot, the Irish might, at first glance, appear weak at that position. Tight End Coach George Stewart begs to differ. 
When  the  average  college  
football  fan  previews  Notre  
Dame's  football  team  this  

"We might not be as strong as last year when we had Joel's experience,'' said Stewart, also in his second year at Notre. Dame. "But I'm certainly not afraid to go on the field with the guys I've got this year. Andy Heck has some good ex­perience and caught a touch­down pass with a two-point con­version against USC last season. What I like about Andy is his great blocking. He's got sure hands, and I'm sure-we won't hesitate to use him in passing situations. But he's developed into just a fine block­er." 
Stewart also sees a great deal of potential in freshman Frank Jacobs, who has shown ex­tremely well in fall workouts. 
dence  in  all of  our  quarter­ 
backs,  though.  The  team  is  
ready to win."  

"I would not hesitate at all in putting Frank Jacobs in the game," said Stewart. "Frank could be called our 'tight end of the future'. He has a consi­derable amount of speed and quickness, and also possesses the major tools to become a great tight end. He's adopted well to the college game, and I wouldn't be surprised if you saw some of him before the year is out. Tom Byrne is playing very capable tight end and could very well move up the ladder with his solid work ethic." 
The Irish, then, are more than happy to have that Tim Brown guy on their side of the ball. But a few more receivers have good chances to share some of the limelight this year.

year, one thought immediately comes to mind. 
"They've got that really good wide receiver, don't they? That Tim Brown guy, the Heisman candidate." 
Well, the Irish do have that Tim Brown guy. But many of the smarter teams Notre Dame plays will try to take him out of the Irish offense as much as possible. That means that the rest of the wide receivers and the tight ends may have to pick up a good deal of the slack, and the Notre Dame coaches think they have the depth and the tal­ent to do it. 
"Of course, what can you say about Tim Brown?" said Pete Cordelli, receivers coach for the Irish. "I haven't been able to improve as much on his strengths as Tim himself has. What sets Timmy apart from the rest of the pack are his practice habits. He practices like he plays, and that's full tilt 100 percent of the time." 
It would seem hard to im­prove upon Brown's stellar junior year, but from what Cor­delli has seen so far this fall, the senior from Dallas shows no signs of letting up this season. 
"How many times have you seen really good players slump their senior year after getting a lot of hype from a good junior year?" continued Cordelli, who is in his second year with Notre Dame after following Head Coach Lou Holtz from Min­nesota. "You won't see it this year from Tim Brown. He's worked hard this summer and is in the best shape I've ever seen him in. He's more knowledgeable of the system, and has good sight of his goals and priorities. 
"If he plays as well as he did last year, consistently, I don't know how you couldn't give him the Heisman." 
But one player who knows he'll see more action this year because of the blanket coverage Brown will receive is split end Reggie Ward. Ward knows he'll be drawing single coverage, an idea that appeals to him. 
"I feel really good with my game so far this fall," said Ward. "We know Tim is going to be double-teamed a lot of the time. It's just been a matter of the coaches stressing the fun­damentals to prepare me for what should be a lot more balls thrown my way. Hopefully, if I contribute the way I'd like and the coaches would like, and the other younger receivers can come through, we'll be able to free Timmy up for another great year." 
Ward praises the coaches for their approach to the season, and has a great deal of confi­dence in the team's overall ability to win. 
"The coaches have been trying to make us complete receivers," added Ward. "We just can't be catching the ball and making a move here and there. We've got to concentrate on reading the coverages and moving to the ball. Right now, the way Terry (Andrysiak) has been practicing, he's our start­ing quarterback, and I know he can do the job. I've got confi­
Reggie Ward 
Cordelli is also confident with Ward and the other Irish wideouts who figure to see ac­tion. 
"Reggie's had a great fall," said Cordelli. "So have Patrick Terrell and Ray Dumas, a couple of guys who are doing some good things and should make big contributions this season. If we can just be con­sistent, we'll play with an ex­cellent squad of receivers."

Thanks to the Black Cultural Arts Council, the Student Union Board, Fisher Hall and the stu­dent government. students will be able to broaden their musi­cal horizons on Saturday with Pieces of a Dream, a jazz trio which, In the late 1970's, be­came well known as the youngest professional jazz combo In the United States. The Stepan Center concert starts at 9 p.m. and will be fol­lowed by a dance at 11 p.m. 
The trio -bassist and vocalist Cedric Napolean, drummer Curtis D. Harmon, and keyboardlst James Lloyd ­began performing In the Philadelphia area over a decade ago. Then teenagers, they began winning acclaim for their music before they could legally 
play In clubs where alcohol was 
served. 
Under the guidance of saxop­
honist Grover Washington Jr. 
they gained further recognition 
as they released three success­
ful albums. In the early 1980's 
they shared the stage with such 
luminaries as Milt Jackson, 
Mercer Ellington, Lionel 
Hampton, and Denlece Wil­
liams. In 1981 they opened a 
Philadelphia show for Count 
Basie. 
About them Basle com­
mented, "They're a hard act to 
follow." 
The group has gained fame 
internationally as well. In 1983, 
the trio joined Grover Washing­
ton Jr., Art Blakely, Max Roach, 
Les Brown ~ His Band of 
Renown and many others in 
Japan's prestigious Aurex Jazz 
Festival. 
Pieces of a Dream will per­
form Saturday at 9 p.m. in 
Stepan Center. A dance will 
follow at 11 p.m. Tickets are 
$3 in advance and $4 at the

many critics screamed for after last year's Lifes Rich Pageant hinted at a growing social awareness in the band. In­stead, Document fuses the moody, murky, self-interested 
R.E.M of old with the brave, new R. E. M, a band that's aware not only of itself but also of its generation and the social con­ditions around it. 
So when Stipe opens the al­bum by singing "The time to rise has been engaged'Your better best to rearrangett'm talking here to me alone-1 listen to the finest worksong..." and follows this with ~'Your finest houri" the listener is struck by a sense of urgency that's more defined on Document than on any of R.E.M's albums, yet at the same time the band's mes­
'J 
Hey Friday! 

sage is as unclear as ever. Are they calling for social change? personal change? both? nei­ther? As it turns out Document isn't a call for anything. It's more like a shout of warning. 
In "Welcome to the Occupa­tion" a vision of the soldier as glorious hero is set up with "Here we stand and here we fightfclll your fallen heroes" and then shot down with "Held and died and skinned alive-listen to the Congress where we propagate confusion." "Oc­cupation" fades out with Stipe demanding "Listen to me. Lis­ten to mel" In "Exhuming McCarthy" the band lays down an infectious, almost Motownish dance song com­plete with horns and "doo-doo, doo-doo" backing vocals as Stipe gleefully exposes the so­called patriots who are only really "loyal to the bank of America." He goes on on to liken McCarthy's paranoid, commie bashing tactics of the 50's to the paranoid, commie bashing tactics of the far-right in the 80's. 
These songs, along with "It's the End of the World as We Know It (and I Feel Fine)", "Strange" (an old Wire song and the album's sole cover ver­sion) and "King of the Birds" sum up the general feeling of the album. In short, your freedom is under attack and the enemy isn't the Russians but current political leaders and trends that substitute jin­goistic "patriotism" for real li­berty. The feeling of urgency, of being threatened, is rein­forced throughout the album, even down to the jacket spine which reads "File Under Fire." 
The album's first single, "The 

One I Love," was performed on tour last year and is probably
..

the most traditional R.E.M song on the album with lyrics straight from Stipe's notebook and a lonely Rockville-like at­mosphere. Once again Buck's insistent, heavy chords and the wailing of Stipe and bassist Mike Mills make the song more than just the love letter it could have been. 
The music of Document is closer to the music of Fables of the Reconstruction than that of last year's Pageant. Most songs are instantly arresting but murky around the edges in­stead of the crisp studio sound

of Pageant. Buck's guitar is still the dominant force in this band and Buck plays in a variety of styles from an Edge-like drone to grungy power chords that would make Angus Young proud. 
Document is another excel­lent album from R.E.M. It remains consistent with the band's earlier work in its refusal to settle for easy answers but it shows definite development in its sharp focus and its consistency. Note: The single of "The One I Love" is also a must as It has a great live version of "Maps and Legends" on the B-side.

Substance 
New Order 

tlon to this very Influential new wave dance band. Previously called Joy Division, England's 
Solid Ground 
New Order emerged with a new 
lead vocalist around 1980 as 
an Innovative new band with a 
heavy synthesized sound. The songs on their albums con­
tained new Ideas and experi­
ments and on each LP there was always the expected dance single which set the standard until the next release by the band. However, New Order, from the very beginning, has always been noted for Its 12 -Inch singles and dance remixes. 
Substance Is a collection of these old remixes. On these extended versions, the songs really come alive. In addition, New Order has atso released many songs which never ap­peared on any of their p~:evlous four albums. For example. "Blue Monday" was released as a single and it became one of the top-selling 12-lnch singles of all time: But until now It was never otherwise released. 
Substance Is a double record set of twelve songs, each ex­tended and some specially remixed for this album. "Bizarre Love Triangle" Is up­beat and fantastic, although 
"Temptation" does not come off as well. "Shellshock" is here though, and "The P.erfect Kiss." "True Faith" Is brand new and is receiving substantial play in clubs and on progressive rock radio stations. 
For the most part. however, these songs are nothing new 
for the listener who has fol­lowed New Order all along. If 
you are not a diehard fan, go

Living with the milk elf 
T
here Is an elf living In my apartment --a milk elf to be precise. You might think that I am trying to be cute or want to create a little magical world of my own, but that Is not the case. There really Is an elf In my apartment and I don't want him there; he's a thief; he's a slob and he's not paying any rent.

The next week the elf struck again,but this time I was prepared. One ofmy sweaters disappeared from my closet and re-appeared on Steve. 
"What are you doing with my sweater?" I demanded. 
"I found It In one of my drawers and thought it was mine," he retorted. 
I was about to accuse him of stealing when I realized that he really might be innocent. My awe at the power of the milk elf grew; not only was he able to transport objects from room to room, he could also alter my roommate's memory. 

Since then I have learned to recognize the activities of the milk elf and not blame them on my roommates. The milk elf can be tolerated if you learn to under­stand his quirks and understand that he will always get his way. Besides, he throws good parties.
