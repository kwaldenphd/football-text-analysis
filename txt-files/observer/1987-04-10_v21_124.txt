Soviets display devices, accuse U.S. of spying 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW-The Soviet Union put on display Thursday microphones and other gadgets it said were dug from the walls and floors of its U.S. missions and claimed the devices prove that Soviets are victims of American spies. 
The devices, some crammed with 
miniature electronics and no bigger 
than a pencil, are "material evidence 
of who is really intruding into the sov­
ereign territory of others," Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Boris Pyadyshev 
said at a news briefing. 
The briefing and the display of ob­
jects allegedly planted at Soviet mis­
sions and residences in Washington, 
San Francisco and New York was a 
clear Kremlin response to reports that 
the KGB laced the U.S. Embassy in Moscow with bugging devices and com­promised its security. 
The Soviet counterattack came as American officials were trying to gauge a sex-and-spy scandal that allegly in­volved U.S. marine guards who became sexually involved with Soviet women and were enticed into allowing KGB agents inside the American Embassy. 
It was not possible for journalists to verify that the transmitters, receivers and other electronic devices had actu­ally been planted on Soviet property by 
U.S. agents. 
The Soviet Union took extraordinary measures to protect its new Washington embassy after the United States tried in 1979 to bug apartment buildings in­side the compound, The Washington Post reported Thursday.

'Lazer Tag' game turns fatal as teenager shot by deputy 
Associated Press 
RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif. -An anguished deputy sheriff was taken off duty and counseled Thursday after fa­tally shooting a teen-ager who was using a toy laser gun in mock combat with friends in a dark schoolyard. 
The unidentified six-year veteran of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department had been called to Central Elementary School at 10 p.m. Tuesday after a passer-by walking a dog re­ported armed prowlers, sheriff's spokesman Jim Bryant said Thursday. 
Leonard Joseph Falcon, 19, who had been playing Lazer Tag with three friends, was shot to death after he fired flashes of light from the toy gun at deputies, Bryant said. He died of two 12-gauge shotgun wounds, coroner's in­vestigators said. 
"This kid was in all likelihood think­ing he was in the game and that this officer coming around the corner was one of his opponents," Bryant said. 
He said Falcon's eyesight may have been hampered by the dark. 
"I agonize for that family," said Bryant, "but I also agonize for the dep­uty involved because I know he's a com­passionate human being, a good citi­zen." 
He said witnesses reported seeing the deputy sitting on a curb weeping after the shooting. 
The dead youth was also "a good, solid citizen," a Chaffey Community College student who was studying electronics and worked at a fast-food restaurant, Bryant said. 
One participant in the game, Ronald Gross, 20, said Falcon, "one of my best

Kevin Hurley continues progress, celebrates 20th birthday at home 
By BETH CORNWELL Staff Reporter 
Kevin Hurley, the Notre Dame fresh­man who was injured in a hit-and-run accident crossing U.S. 31-33 on Septem­ber 7, 1985, celebrated his twentieth birthday on April 8 at his home in Mas­sachusetts. 
"I got a call from Ken, my roommate, and I got a call from Emil this morning. It made me feel good. I also got at-shirt and a sweatshirt from the Sophomore Class Advisory Council. My mom showed me that I got about ten cards. That made me feel great," Hurley said. 
I'm really glad you people care. I'm not joking when I say that even from 1500 miles away I still feel -I don't know, it just makes me feel great," Hurley said. 
Hurley continues to improve physi­cally, and is working with an artificial limb. His lower left leg was amputated because of injuries suffered in the ac­cident. 
"I'm using it (the prosthesis) more. It gets kind of sore, wearing a leg where you haven't had one for a year and a half. Also the skin on my stump gets kind of sore -but it's getting better as I work more and more," said Hurley. 
The procedure for learning to walk using a prosthesis involves a progres­sion from a walker to crutches to canes to a cane. 
"I'm still on crutches -really not anywhere near canes but I'm con­stantly working and I'm improving," Hurley said. 
The letter writing campaign spon­sored by the sophomore advisory coun­cil is trying to increase the number of letters Hurley receives from Notre Dame, according to Student Body Pres­ident Pat Cooke. 
"We want to increase the amount of mail he's been getting of late because there's a chance he may come out some time this spring. It's important for Kevin to know that even though he's not physically here he's still a real member of the class of '89," Cooke said.

'Women at Prayer' is focus of lecture at Saint Mary's 
By COURTNEY JAMIESON Staff Reporter 
Reflections on the spiritual journeys of poet Anne Sexton, painter Meinrad Craighead and writer Anne Dilard and the different perspectives of God each of these women convey through their respective art forms, was the subject of a lecture given by Sister Mary Collins 
at  Saint  Mary's  O'Laughlin  
Auditorium.  
Collin's lecture,  titled  "Women  at  

Prayer, " was the third annual Madeleva lecture in spirituality given Thursday night. 
Collins said of these women,"I have chosen women who are unashamed God-seekers and who have not been afraid to trust and give imaginative ex­pression to their experiences of God in this .late twentieth-centuryWestern cul­ture." 
"Last year's lecturer, Sandra Schneiders, talked about the need for healing the church's imagination which has been narrowed by male images of God. So what I wanted to do was look at some women who were giving ex­pression to feminine images of God," said Collins. 
Collins said of Saint Mary's, "I think it has made a contribution for several generations in the education of Catholic women. 
"I think what Saint Mary's is doing today is inviting students and alumnae to deepen their faith and prepare for new kinds of leadership among Cath­olic women," she added. 
Collins ended her speech by calling for men and women to share mutually respectful words about God when gat­hering for prayer. 
"For in the beginning, before we lost our way, we were created male and female as God's images," she said. 
Collins is currently at the Benedictine Priory in Atchison, Kansas where she has been doing research and lecturing, and working in liturgical studies and women's spirituality. Next fall she will be returning to Catholic University where she was fr6m 1978 to 1984.

Toastmasters: a club that gives everyone a 'fighting chance' 
A few months ago I unexpectedly found myself with some free time on my hands. Ob­viously, using it to do more schoolwork was not the best thing to do, but I did not want to end up as an excise statistic at the County Prose­cutor's Office. 
So, I joined Toastmasters. 
Toastmasters is not a club for those who al­ways manage to set the toaster ablaze in the dining hall; Toastmasters is not a club for those who are going to be newly married and want to impress a spouse with breakfast-making prowess. No, Toastmasters is not the place to learn how to make corny "toasts" at formal dinners. (Now all pf the familiar "Toastmaster jokes" are aside.) 
Toastmasters, as I see it, is a way of life. A club fostering the development of public speak­ing, communication skills and confidence, Toastmasters offers anyone who is interested a place to improve himself and make some good friends. 
Toastmasters is not confined to the Notre Dame campus and the three clubs at Saint Mary's by any means; it is an international organization with over 130,000 members. The 

word Toastmaster itself means "one who intro­

duces speakers at a banquet," and it is on this "ah," or "you know," it will be counted, and

Indiana votes to raise state speed limit to 65

Associated Press 

INDIANAPOLIS -The In­diana House voted Thursday to raise the speed limit on most interstate highways to 65 mph. 
Lawmakers approved Senate Bill 180 on an 83-15 vote, sen­ding the measure back to the Senate and probably to a House-Senate conference com­mittee, according to Rep. Thomas Coleman, R-New Castle, the House sponsor. 
The measure would apply to about 75 percent of the inter­state mileage in Indiana, or ap­proximately 852 miles in rural areas. Another 267 miles defined by the federal govern­ment as urban interstate would retain the current 55 mph speed limit. 
Other federal and state high­ways would also keep the 55 mph limit, established during the energy crises of the 1970s.Shaded Sightseers "I think there are two things people in Indiana are really
Morrissey juniors Dave Fischer, left, and John concerned about -number one, Beckham enjoy thf' weather and the action at the lottery, and number two,the Lyons Courts Thursday. Round two of 

the 65 mile an hour speed 
limit," said Coleman. 
"I think if you drive the in­
terstate, you know that the 
speed limit is about 65 miles 
per hour right now," said Cole­
man. 
Reps. Ralph Underwood, D­
Connersville, and Frank New­
kirk, D-Salem, both said they 
feared higher speeds would 
lead to more traffic fatalities. 
Newkirk also said higher insur­
ance rates could result if 
greater speed produced more 
accidents. 
Coleman replied that only 63 
fatalities were recorded on In­
diana interstates in 1986, and 
only 15 were speed-related. 
Those categorized as speed­
related included accidents 
where a driver was going too 
fast for prevailing road condi­
tions but not fast enough to 
exceed the speed limit, Cole­
man said. 
Because so many people ig­
nore the 55 mph limit, Coleman 
said he expects little or no real 
increase in speed due to the 
higher speed limit. 
Rep. Edward Goble, D­
Batesville, said cars and roads 
are safer today than they were 
when the speed limit was last 
65 mph. He also noted that the 
state's new seat-belt law, 
which goes into effect July 1, 
should help hold down the num­
ber of fatalities. 
"When we passed this (the 55 mph limit), we were coerced into doing this," said Goble, re­ferring to federal threats to cut off highway funding to states that didn't comply with the lower limit. 
The rationale that lower 
speeds would improve gasoline 
consumption "is simply no 
longer a valid reason" for the 
55 mph limit, he said. "Now 
cars get twice the mileage they 
did then." 

Saint Mary's 'little sisters' a tradition 
By MARY HEILMANN Senior Staff Reporter 
Dormitories at Saint Mary's may be a little bit crowded this weekend, but it is unlikely that anyone will be complaining, as the College will be hosting its annual Little Sisters' Weekend. 
"It's a traditional event on 
campus," said Mary Ellen 
Smith, director of Student Ac­
tivities at the College. "We did 
an advance registration and 
about 75 of our students regis­
tered approximately 100 little 
sisters.'' 
Junior Moira Michiels, stu­
dent chairwoman of the event, 
indicated that the interest was 
higher than anticipated, saying 
that originally the event "was 
budgeted for only about 25 stu­
dents to respond." 
"I hope everyone enjoys 
what's planned, and that they 
have a fun weekend with their 
sisters," Michiels said. 
Activities begin Friday night 
with an ice cream party and 
banana split bar in Regina 
Hall. Saturday's events feature 
a fashion show and special 
lunch at SAGA in the afternoon, 
followed in the evening by a 
showing of the movie "Grease" 
and a pizza party in the Club­
house. The weekend concludes 
Sunday with a Mass in Regina.

Arms proposal said to be dead issue 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Reagan's proposal at the Iceland summit to scrap all 
U.S. and Soviet ballistic mis­siles over 10 years is a dead issue, Nuclear Arms Control Director Kenneth Adelman said Thursday. 
"The Soviets have rejected it out of hand," Adelman said. 
He told reporters the U.S. proposal is still on the negotiat­ing table in Geneva. But, he added, "I don't think it's going to come on the radar screen on arms control again, if you ask me." 
Reagan proposed a two-stage plan to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik,

Iceland. In the first five years, the two sides would cut by about one-half their long-range bombers, missiles and sub­marines. In the next five years, all ballistic missiles would be phased out. 
U.S. negotiators formally presented the proposal to So­viet negotiators later at Geneva. But, Adelman said, "they didn't give us the time of day." 
The director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency said the Soviets refused the offer because ''they figure that the backbone of their military and their arsenal has been land-based ballistic missiles." 
Some U.S. allies in Western 
Europe also had reservations 
about Reagan's proposal. Sec­
retary of State George Shultz 
responded to those concerns by 
saying a small force of U.S. bal­
listic missiles might be 
retained. 
Shultz will discuss arms con­
trol issues next Monday 
through Wednesday in Moscow 
with Soviet Foreign Minister 
Eduard Shevardnadze. He also 
may meet with Gorbachev. 
They would discuss plans for a 
third summit meeting in Wash­
ington. 
Adelman said Gorbachev had not responded to Reagan's invitation but said he expected the Soviet leader to be here during the summer or early fall. 
On another nuclear issue, Adelman said the United States would offer the Soviets a timetable on "Star Wars" ex­periments in exchange for in­formation on their anti-missile research program. 
He said he did not expect the offer to change the fundamen­tal differences between the two sides on space-based defenses. But, he said, "there are some elements that would interest them." 
The disagreement over Reagan's program to find a way to shoot down missiles in space has slowed negotiations over curbing U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons. 
Adelman said Shultz would put the emphasis on limiting strategic nuclear weapons.

Sex must involve responsible decision making 
Editors Note: The following is the fourth in a series of columns from the University Counseling Center. 
Writing about sexual issues is diffi­cult even for a 35 year old woman who lived through the "sexual revolution." Part of the difficulty comes from the setting in which I find myself, where sexual activity is not openly discussed because of religious sanctions against it. Not talking about sex, however, doesn't keep it from occuring, it just makes it more difficult to sort out one's feelings about it when it does happen. I believe barriers to communication about sex can make one more suscep­tible to myths and misinformation, and may ultimately result in less respon­sible sexual behavior.

Let me be clear about what I mean by "responsible" behavior. For me, the critical determinant of responsible be­havior is the exercise of choice based on one's own values. This may sound simple, but it requires that one know one's own values and not base decisions on peer pressure or media pressure or even on parental pressure. That's a tall order, especially when there's so little opportunity to explore feelings about such an emotionally charged issue. 
My sense from my counseling expe­rience here is that there is very little discussion about sex between the young women and men on this campus, except in awkward and guarded ways. In fact, it appears that there isn't a lot of open and honest discussion about it between members of the same sex. That may be partly responsible for the adver­sarial relationship that often exists be­tween the sexes here. The myths that develop about male sexuality or female sexuality are both a result and a cause of this lack of communication-it's one of those proverbial vicious cycles. 
I'd like to address some of the myths that interfere with responsible choices. , There are so many that it's hard to know what ot concentrate on, but I'll pick out the ones that seem to me to be the most destructive and prevalent. While I am drawing from my experi­ence as a woman and a counselor in this discussion, there is evidence in the psychological literature to support these issues. 


P.O.BoxQ 
Catholic education is beneficial for officers 
Dear Editor: 
Two things. 
The article in your issue of March 26, 1987, which asserted that drug tests are an infringment on rights of players, workers. What rights? Constitutional? Only the government can violate con­stitutional rights, not the NCAA or employers. 
The article "The Right Stuff", in the same issue was good, but it had to say that "some people wonder whether ROTC contradicts the values supported by a Catholic university." Who wonders? 
Doonesbury 
The military profession is as noble a profession as any other, and nobler than some. It exists to take care of the people. What kind of officer would they want in the military, anyway? And if the officers are not trained at Notre Dame, where should they be trained? Since when does Catholicism as a reli­gion condemn the military profession, or by religious tenent make it a sin to be a soldier? If there is any place where the ROTC could be woven into the mosaic of a school without any dissent at all it should be at the University of Notre Dame where the nobility of obedience marks both the Catholic and the soldier. What values supported by a Catholic university can the ROTC pos­sibly contradict if the values are true? 
John W. Snyder Creve Coeur, Missouri 
I think the myth that interferes most with communication is the one that all men have (or should have) stronger sexual needs and appetites than all wo­men. The fact of the matter is that both men and women have varying sexual needs; they vary from person to person and they vary across time for any one person. Misconceptions about this can make some men feel inadequate and some women feel guilty because they don't fit the stereotype in terms of their sexual needs. This can make it difficult to be honest with oneself or others about relationship issues. Learning to under­stand and be comfortable with one's own needs, as well as those of others, is an important step in making sexual chioces. 
Another prevalent and highly destructive myth is that "when a wo­man says no she really means yes." This is simply not true. What may hap­pen is that a woman will say no and mean it, but be confused about her right to refuse. So if she's pressured she may give in, but most men would not be proud of capitalizing on someone else's confusion and discomfort if they thought about it in those terms. (This experience is not uncommon among young women who have resisted sexual

A woman may even be confused about what she wants and send mixed signals because of it, espe­cially if alcohol is involved. That doesn't make her bad, or a tease, and it doesn't diminish her right to draw the line at any time. If a man perceives this as rejection it may add to his own confusion in this situation. Given the newness of the experience, the power of it, the mystique surrounding it, and the inability to talk openly about it, is it any wonder that people get confused? 
Sex can be a wonderful, uplifting ex­perience under the right condiitons, but it can be equally bad under the wrong conditions. It's important to keep in mind that sex is much more than a physical experience-it is psychological, emotional and spiritual in nature. We all have the right, and the responsibil­ity, to choose wisely when and how it influences our lives, and to respect the choices of others.

"Something to do, something to see, something new to crack the igloo mood." 
-from "Big Noise" by Joseph Corey 
KIM YURATOVAC features writer 
T he most mag­
nificent, clean-cut, swlngln' affair I've ever attended," Is how band leader Stan Kenton described the 1960 Collegiate Jazz Festival. This weekend, that tradition continues at Notre Dame with the 1987 Collegiate Jazz Festival. 
The festival, celebrating Its :30th year, gathers the best of the collegiate jazz musicians and celebrity judges for two day's of concerts, competition, and jam sessions. Fifteen bands from all over the United States will compete Friday eve­ning, Saturday afternoon, and Saturday evening at Stepan Center. 
Chairman Kevin Cronin Is enthusiastic about the talent of bands. "The quality and Inten­sity of the band s amazes me. The collegiate talent Is superb," he remarked. After sending out 11 0 applications, Cronin and his seven member student staff as well as their academic ad­
vlser Father George Wlsklrchen, 
chose the fifteen competing 
bands. The staff chose the panel of six judges looking for respected musicians who could give helpful critiques, and who work well together, according to Cronin. One of the most ex­citing aspects of the festival, Cronin remembers, was en· couraglng jazz greats to be judges In the festival. "We even contacted Dizzy Gillespie. But he was booked. Not one poten­tial judge didn't want to do It," he said. "The $1,000 check and payed expenses are small fees for greats who can com­mand two or three jobs In a 
weekend." 
Nevertheless, the festival has 
continued to draw top-notch 
judges. Past festivals have In­
cluded such judges as Herbie 
Hancock, Roberta Flack and 
Wynton Marsalis. The Judges' 
Jam Is the highlight of Friday's 
events. "The Judges' Jams 
seem to get better every year, 
even when you thought they 
never could," admitted Cronin. 
This year's judges Include 
trumpeter Red Rodney, bassist 
Charlie Haden, drummer Roy 
Haynes, pianist Kenny Kirkland, , critic Dan Morgenstern, and 
versatile musician Frank Wess. 
Jospeh Kuhn Carey, chairman 
of the 1979 festival and author of the book, "Big Noise From Notre Dame," says at the Judges' Jam, "The excitement starts to build. It's the peak of the whole thing." 
Carey Is returning to the fes­tival this weekend to sign copies of his book and to take In the festival. "The festival has soul. It has a history behind It: an aura," he said. The beauty of the festival, he admits, Is that, "Anything goes. Every year there's something new." 
Carey observed that Notre Dame students have become more conservative since the tlrst days of the festival. "In the early days of the festival In the

How about dressing up in clothes that are reminiscent of the 60's? How about dancing to the music of Blind River? How about paying only $4 to go to a dance on campus? How about attending the Beaux Arts Ball? While most students outside of architecture probably hadn't heard of the ball before com­ing to school here, the Ball Is not unique to Notre Dame. 
Its origin comes from across the Atlantic, from L'Ecole de Beaux Arts in Paris. The faculty at the famous art school held balls which were traditionally very formal. Some creative stu­dents decided to hold their own parties that mimicked those of their professors. The Idea was to get decked out In

Collegiate Jazz Festival in America. Carey's book chronicles the history of the Collegiate Jazz Festival. But the book is more than a factual history. The chapters are separated into decades. And Carey carefully shows how the mood of each era was both reflected and influenced in its jazz. 
In "Big Noise," Carey vividly remembers the excitement of chairing the 1979 festival. He contacted Stevie Wonder, Dizzy Gillespie, and Benny Goodman, hoping to convince them to be jusdges at the Festival. He even tried to get Woody Allen as an emcee. Even though all of these attempts were unsuccess­ful, Carey was persistent in securing a top-notch panel of judges. However, Carey's prob­lems were far from over. After booking all of the judges on United Airlines nights into 
any kind of attire that wasn't 
formal and have a wild time. Over the years, the ball be­came a tradition among archi­
tecture and art students all 
over the world. 
The ball is not restricted merely to these students, however, and certainly It can be enjoyed by Darners In other majors. Although the proceeds from the dance do go to the Notre Dame chapter of the American Institute of Ar­chltects(AIAS), the ball's chair­man encourages all students to attend. 
Held once each semester, the ball is probably best known to students for its crazy themes. Over the years, these have ranged from focus on color; such as Black and White or Paint the Town Red; to politics, such as Revolutions; to the morbid, as with We Only Come Out at Night, last semes­ter's theme. Tonight, guests will sport attire that reflect the theme of Psychodelic. The original spelling is meant to encourage guests to be espe­cially creative. However, cos­tumes are not required. Decorations created by art and architecture students will also reflect the theme. 
The dance will be held from 9 until 2 tonight in the front lobby of the Architecture build· ing. The stairs and balconies provide interesting opportuni­ties for decorations as well as dancing. Interestingly enough, this dance is the only one on campus that is held in an aca­demic building. 
The price of tickets is $4 presale and $5 at the door. Dates are not required and, in fact, not even particularly preferred. The dances which yield the biggest attendance are the ones in which people come with large groups and bring their friends. 
The AlAS uses their earnings primarily for student lectures and films but they also go towards cutting costs of social events, such as this one. Occa­sionally, cash prizes are awarded in design competition as well. 
So it's Friday night again and you're looking for something to do. If you're in the mood for hauling out something tie-dyed or something mod, you can go to the Psychojelic Ball. If you're in the mood for creating something deranged· looking(whatever that entails), you can go to the Psychodelic Ball. If you're in the mood for just going dancing and aren't in the mood for Theodore's, you can go to the Beaux Arts Ball. Whatever you do, 9 p.m. at the Architecture lobby is an option to be psyched about.

Carey sees the change In style of music reflected In the three decades of festivals. "In the early slxltes, there was an Interest In experimental music," he said. With the rise of rock 'n' roll, Carey ex­plained, there seemed to be a general decline In Interest In jazz. However, In the 1968 fes­tival, one of the bands turned the festival around with a rock version jazz. No prize was awarded that year because the performances were more rock than jazz. But, significant strides were made In the world ofjazz. 
Carey e11Joyed watching the evolution ofjazz at the fes­tivals, which also reflect the social changes of the times. "They got judges that were real trendsetters. They let new things happen," he said. The judges and audiences return year after year. And the impact of the festival has been great.

Stand Up ends on a sen­timental note with "''ll Sleep With You (Cha Cha D'Amour)." The song is basically an open invitation to a woman saying that if she ever needs him, he's there for her, and not. in the context of the song, in a sexual way. It's sort of an 80s 'Til Be There," and it's a neat way to end the albuni. 
The Del Fuegos are produced again here by Mitchell Froom, and his trademark organ is all over this album. I think it's time for a new producer. It seems like the band is strug­gling to go in a new direction on Stand Up, with the in­creased use of back-up singers and new instruments besides their trademark grunge guitars. Mitchell rroom is too familiar and I think he's holding them back.

'Angel Heart' reveals a Heart of Darkness 

DON SEYMOUR features writer 
A 
ngel Heart teams up some of the most singular talents of contemporary mmmaklng: Mickey Rourke, who charmed us with his down-and-out, Intui­tive style In nlms like "Diner, ""The Pope of Greenwich VIllage," and "9 1/2 Weeks,"; Robert DeNiro, one of the most acclaimed actors of his time; and writer/director Alan Parker, who brought us "Midnight Ex­press," "Fame," Pink Floyd's "The Wall, "and "Birdy." With a crew like this, we can reason­ably expect a tour-de-force. And they do deliver. Angel Heart mixes elements of the detective story and the super­natural to create a stunning vision of the Individual who has sold his soul for success. 
Mickey Rourke plays Harry Angel, a detective hired by a mysterious man named Louis Cyphre (DeNiro) to find a singer who disappeared during World War II. The time Is 1955. The singer's name Is Johnny Favorite. Yes, names are sym­bolic In this fllm. Angel's search quickly leads him to New Orleans and into the voodoo religion that Is prac­ticed both In Harlem and in the bayou. Along the way, he 


All the Seasons of Mercy 
Contemporary in theme, written in inclusive language, and grouped according to the seasons of the church year, these prayers, based on the Common Lectionary, convey the mystery of Gods presence in our lives. 
"Gods grace has showered upon Diane Karay the wonderful gift of theological insight and the poetic insight to translate the mystery of Gods grandeur into prayers that sing with scriptural integrity and human honesty." -James G. Kirk 
P'aper, S7.9'i

meets Epiphany Proudfoot, 
played by The Cosby Show's 
Lisa Bonet, a young voodoo 
priestess and Illegitimate child 
of Favorite. The two share a 
steamy scene together. 
The fllm Is filled with recur­
ring Images: a closing gate, a 
slowly rotating door fan, a lit 
window In an apartment block 
from which issue screams, a 
V-Day celebration In Times 
Square. These Images occur In 
Harry's consciousness, but they 
are unexplained until the 
climax--one I cannot tell you 
because It would ruin the unex­
pected power of the movie. 
What the Images do show Is 
Parker's careful crafting of this 
nlm. There's great artistry at 
work here. Every shot counts. 
Every symbol Is rich. And they 
ail contribute to the stunning 
climax that will affect you long 
after you leave the theater. 
Mickey Rourke quietly and 
subtly creates Harry Angel 
before our eyes. He looks 
seedy enough to convince us 
that he Is a cheap detective on 
the Lower East Side. His an­
guish at the end of the mm 
brings together a character 
who has never been afraid but 
who has been tormented by 
nightmares and visions he can­
not understand. Angel Is 
Rourke's fullest and most ma­
ture characterization yet. 
Robert DeNiro, In a small but significant role, Is as elusive and slippery as a snake. His performance Is hypnotic and eerie, yet he has a strange power, not only over the viewer but over Angel as well. One does not fully recognize the power of his performance until the climax. 
Lisa Bonet, In her motion picture debut, Is sultry, sexy and generally Impressive. Epip­hany Is a more subtle and complex character than Denise Huxtable and, under Parker's guidance, she handles It well. 
As for Parker, he Is quickly becoming one of our most sig­nificant mmmakers. Each of his projects Is finely crafted and deeply moving In Its own way, yet, because of the diversity of his work. he Is Impossible to define. 
Angel Heart fits comfortably

Into Parker's body of work. It Is a rare fllm, packing enough thrills to keep you Interested and enough chills to make you remember lt.

The crossroads out of a revolution 
I 
'm old-fashioned, conserva­tive, reactionary, with enough streaks of liberalism, perhaps, to keep me ~om being written off as hcjlpelessly out of date. I'm not ready to see the clock on the old church tower turned back to the 1960's, nor do I want the world turned around so that It can make a return trip back to Ig­norance and darkness from which mankind has evolved. arthritis, I hope I'll have the grace to be brave as a Chris­tian. In the meantime, I'm cheering for medical science to find a miracle cure for every affliction. 
Most of the time, as Americans not hounded by poverty, we manage to stay healthy. Mental and spiritual pain, however, are no respec­ters of persons. Loneliness, depression, discouragement and the rest are moods that overtake us In the midst of happiness. We walt like children wanting to fall asleep to pleasant dreams, for the anxieties to go back to their closets. 
A Christian at any age, hating the shambles he has made of his life, may start to pray for help. When things fall apart, the Lord who endured heartbreak can seem very dear; we need His message of defeat turned into victory. We trust Him to have mercy on our small, shabby crosses, as He looks down on us from the Cross of shame which He made His throne. 
Why is the Cross never men­tioned in the context of our human sexuality, even by priests? As rational animals endowed with this major in­stinct, all of us are subject to the tease of the flesh. The body and the spirit are yoked In an uneasy marriage, with the lower appetites frequently In rebellion against the intellect and the will. 
ferlng gets lost behind the Easter lilies. 
We're psychologically health­Ier, I suspect. than the old-time penitents who wore halrshlrts or hid ~way from life as desert monks: Unnecessary suffering, deliberately sought as a way of paying for our sins, may serve as a stepping stone to godli­ness, as some of the saints taught. Penance, taken In small doses, Is as much as I can 
Father Robert Griffin 
Letters to a Lonely God 
From this column, you may conclude that I've become deaf and blind to human progress. I hope I'm neither deaf, blind, nor a blind man trying to lead those with sight. In the end, most people do what they have to do. I try to love and respect them, depending on them to love and respect me. 
It's the season of the Cross. We hear the lessons that tell us of Christ's obedience to the death of the Cross. We celebrate that ancient Instru­ment of suffering as the tree of life. We are reminded that He challenged us to take up the Cross and follow Him. 
We commonly complain that the holy lesson of peace on earth to men of good will Is put away with the Christmas decorations. We could add that the example of the Lord's suf­handle, though. 
The fast days, the meatless Fridays of Lent, a week In which I don't drink. an evening during which I don't smoke: these minor league abnega­tions do my soul good, like turning off Letterman so that I can visit the Grotto. 
Sooner or later, the rough times will come. I will get sick. Maybe I'll need an operation. I'm not patient with pain, even when It's explained to me theologically as an effect of original sin, or when I'm urged to offer It up In union with Christ's pain. I'm tempted to think that any pain Is dumb, and that It's inconsiderate of God to allow it. 
I'm deeply touched by dying people who have learned to turn their suffering Into prayer. When I'm afflicted with terminal 
Christians become humiliated by the sexual appetites. Temptation Is nothing to be ashamed of, though, since It's part of the human condition. One Is well off as a sexual being, capable of love and being loved. If sexuality Is to be used humanly, mere Instinct cannot be allowed to call the shots. Are liberated, born-again Christians supposed to live In bondage to the flesh? 
I hear preachers better than I am telling the gallery, ·"You gotta be you." The minorities are answering, "I gotta be me." The groundlings are clamoring. "We gotta be us." Hearing them, I'm almost persuaded, "They gotta be them." 
Then I read one, two, three, four articles or more every day in the New York Times. I found the script of Camus' "The Plague" being written before my eyes as a contemporary drama. Does The New York Times realize that it's telling us that the world Is starting to die? Is It hysterical of me to think so? 
I hope so. I hate being long­faced over the liberation. I'm not going to repeat again the statistics that could scare you. The Times will not blink at what I want to say next, "Being yourself has a limited impor­tance. Being alive as a life­giver is what Easter is all about." 
Is It dull of mind of me to conclude that the Cross is In the shape of a lifestyle that creatures afflicted with the human condition should start Investigating? Jesus Crucified Is remembered as a liberator because of the lesson of love He taught us. 

The love that came to us from the Cross was wondrous and unconditional. The Church has believed for 2, 000 years that the Father's love for the world was made visible In the Passion of the Lamb broken to pieces on the Cross. At Calvary, the love stronger than death was a divine Idea whose time had come. 
Because of lt. a priest has the grace to redefine his voca­tion If his faith has grown cold. A couple has the grace to redefine their marriage if their commitment has grown weak. The downtrodden have the grace to redefine their libera­tion In a way that shows that they have asked what they can do for their world, rather than to insist on telling the world what It must do for them. 
Liberation, even if it is overdue, doesn't have the right to act Irresponsibly. Love that is life-giving bears a Cross on Its back. Easter is a mockery if we pay lip service to the Cross on which the Prince of Glory died, wanting all of its love and none of its discipline marking our flesh. No one reading this column needs it more than me. 
Happy Easter. Darby O'Gill and I never said we didn't love you.

Irish take on Kenyon in lax Golf team goes to Indy 
home-opener 
By CHRIS DALLAVO Sports Writer 
Home at last. After five road trips, featuring four games, the Notre Dame lacrosse team opens its 1987 home season Sat­urday on Cartier Field, taking on the Kenyon College Lords. 
After two weeks without a game, Head Coach Rich O'Leary is afraid that his squad might be a little rusty. 
"It's really hard to tell where we are, since we haven't played an actual game in two weeks," O'Leary noted. "We look at this game as the start of our second season. It will set the tone for the rest of the year." 
The Irish never have lost to Kenyon in the six years of the series, and they don't plan on breaking that string this weekend. One of the keys to keeping the winning streak alive will be to control the tempo of the contest. 
"We really want to put a lot 
of pressure on their attack," 
noted O'Leary. "We need to 
contain their quickness and 
shut down their two big 
scorers. We're going to try and 
run them down." 
O'Leary is confident with his 
reserves, especially now that 
several younger players have 
started to come on. 
"We got some good play
(during Tuesday's scrim­
mage) from some people who 
have not had a lot of playing 
time, especially on defense," 
said O'Leary. "I am confident 
that they can step in and do the 
job." 
The first home game will fea­
ture other attractions besides 
the top-notch lacrosse action. 
The Dog 'n Brew Crew, the of­
ficial Notre Dame Lacrosse 
Fan Club, will make its 1987 
debut. Also, at halftime of the 
game, a shooting contest will 
be held, the winner of which 
will receive a genuine Notre 
Dame lacrosse stick. 
When asked about rumors 
concerning the unveiling of a 
new Dog 'n Brew Crew team 
uniform, Tom Tracy, the Crew 
president, responded only, "No 
comment." 
Since the Wooster game was cancelled last week, Kenyon will be the first game against a Midwest Lacrosse Associa­tion opponent. The game, scheduled to start at 1:30, is im­portant for Notre Dame's By ORLANDO R.UBIANO Sports Writer 
"You're only as good as your last performance," is the attitude the Notre Dame golf team will take into this weekend's Indianapolis In­tercollegiates, being hosted by Ball State. Coming off a strong second-round perfor­mance in last weekend's Purdue Invitational, coach Noel O'Sullivan is confident that his club will have the carry-over effect in display. 
At Purdue, the Irish found themselves one spot from the cellar after the first round. The weather condi­tions, however, which caused havoc the day ear­lier, improved considerably which seemed to be a good omen for the linksters. As a team, the Irish trimmed a whopping 40 strokes off the previous day's total. 
"That averages to 10 strokes less per man which is almost unheard of," said a smiling O'Sullivan. 
With the stellar second­round effort, the club jumped five teams to finish lOth. Overall, the squad shot a total of 640 which put it 24 strokes behind winner Miami of Ohio (616). 
The Indianapolis Intercol­legiates will be a 36-hole event played at Eagle Creek Golf Club (the site of the USGA 1982 Public Links Championship). The course is a par 72 with a rating of 
73.4. The tournament will be attended by all Indiana schools, thus the bragging rights of Indiana are at stake. Defending champion Ball State will be the likely favorite, but O'Sullivan believes his club has an ex­cellent chance to win the tournament and medalist honors (which it last did in 1980). 
"We finished ahead of Ball State last weekend for the first time in a long time, and they have traditionally been a strong power in golf. I know we can finish ahead of them again, because our guys feel the same way " said O'Sullivan. ' 
In order to do so, O'Sullivan is relying on his number one and two Doug Giorgio and Pat Mohan 
. ' 
respectively, to provide the spark. Senior captain Chris Bona, who has fired un­characteristically high num­bers this spring, will need to shoot better if the Irish en­tertain any hopes of victory, according to O'Sullivan. 
"We truly feel that this tournament can be ours " he said, '

Stanford will also present a challenge with its strong middle-distance and distance crew led by Charles Alexander. Brian Connelly should be a threat in the 800-meter run as should Mark Olsen in the 1,500­meter run. 
LSU has strong pole vaulters, high hurdlers and jumpers as well as Mark Venhelden, the in­door champion in the 1,000­yard run. Washington should be dangerous with its speedy crew of sprinters. 
"As a dual-meet competitor 
San Diego State should be the 
toughest competition," said 
Piane, "but from the individual 
standpoint we'll get a tough 
meet from LSU." 
It will be a non-scoring meet 
so time and distance will be 
more important than the places 
won in each event. 
"It will be a great opportu­nity for the guys to run ex­tremely fast times," said Piane, "because of the scoring system and quality of the com­petition."

Saturday the Notre Dame track team travels to the west coast to take on Stanford, LSU, San Diego State and Washing­ton in the Stanford Invitational. 
Leading the balanced Irish attack will be freshman Glenn Watson. Having already qualified for the IC4A Cham­pionships earlier in the outdoor season, Watson will try to im­prove his time of 14:08 in the 110-meter high hurdles and run 
13:88 to qualify for the NCAA Championships. 
Although only a freshman, Watson has already gained valuable experience from the indoor track season. He finished third at the indoor IC4A Championships in the 110­meter hurdles and his perfor­mance at that meet earned him a spot on the East Coast Con­ference team. 
"He is a very good worker," said Irish head coach Joe Piane, "and he is turning out to be a great competitor." Watson, a South Bend native, gained much of his track expe­
rience as an all-American in 
high school and was ranked among the top 10 in the nation 
He won the 110-meter high hurdles at the Midwest Meet of Champions and made a smooth transition into college athletics by winning the same event at the Hoosier Dome Invitational, his first indoor track meet. 

Joe Plane 
At Stanford the Irish will also need a strong performance from freshman Tom Kraus in the shot put and discus and junior Tim Brown in the 100 and 200-meter dash and 400-meter relay. 
Freshman Mike O'Connor ran 3:55 in the 1,500-meter run at the Indiana Invitational and continued success in both the 1,500 and 800-meter run will help the Irish.
