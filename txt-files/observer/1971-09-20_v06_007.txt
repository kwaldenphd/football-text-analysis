Black Politicians will discuss '72 
(c) New York Times News Service 

WASHINGTON--Black political and civil rights leaders from across the country will meet in Chicago next weekend to map final plans and strategy to enter black candidates in several democratic presidential primaries next year. 
In what was planned as a secret session, about 60 prominent leaders have been invited to what is considered to be a major meeting. 
Their over-all strategy is to solidify the black vote, which would pose a serious threat to traditional democratic party strength in black communities. 
Four basic considerations will be before the gathering: for­mation of a black political party, which several have already dismissed as unfeasible; running blacks in democratic primaries in such states as Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Tennessee and California, as well as other states with sizable black populations; the relationship of blacks to any fourth party movement; and the possibility of a black vice presidential can­didate.

Consisting mainly of singles, Fischer Hall provides little op­portunity for any kind of "private" gathering. The quad set-up or fairly large rooms in other halls somewhat relieves the pressure, but this is not so in Fischer. 
Maciariello pointed out that any work or effort that has been put forth in the last two years to achieve hall unity has been severely hampered by the inability of the residents to organize a party. 
Also with the drinking age in 
Michigan being lowered to 18 as 
of Jan. 1, he feels the present

tremely unfortunate. 
Along with most of the other 
presidents, he expressed great 
confidence, with or without the

students ability to maintain the 
good order desired by the com­
munity as a whole.

Irish tame'Cats 50 -7 in opener 

Defense shines-7 interceptions ties ND mark 
by Jim Donaldson Sports Editor 

Perhaps two quarterbacks are better than one. 
The big question during the week preceding Saturday's game was whether Bill Etter or Pat Steenberge would run the Irish offense this season. As things turned out, both Etter and Steenberge, with plenty of help from the Irish deft>nse, led Notre Dame to a season opening 50-7 romp past Northwestern. 
The Irish defense scored two of Notre Dame's seven touchdowns and consistently gave the offense possession of the ball in good field position. Etter and Steenberge took over from there, engineering scoring drives of 32, 66, 41, and 40 yards. Sophomore Cliff Brown directed the final N.D. touchdown, march, taking the Irish 22 yards for the final score of the game. 
The big Irish front four of Walt Patulski, Greg Marx, Mike Kadish and Fred Swendson stopped Northwestern's ground game cold and forced the Wildcats to take to the air. And when 'Cat quarterback Maurie Daigneau tried to throw he was constantly pressured by a strong pass rush that was as responsible for the Irish secondary picking off seven passes as the alert play of Notre Dame's defensive backs. 
The seven interceptions by the Irish tied a single game record set in 1943 against Wisconsin. Junior Ken Schlezes had three pass thefts, becoming the tenth player in N.D. history to swipe that many in a game, Mike Crotty grabbed two, returning one for a touchdown, and Clarence Ellis and Halph Stepaniak snared one each, Stepaniak running 40 yards for a score after his interception. 
Notre Dame's 83rd football opener was a nip and tuck affair for the first quarter. Neither club was able to generate an attack the first couple of times they had the ball. 
Steenberge started the game at quarterback for N.D. but didn't get the Irish a first down in his first two series. 
Notre Dame gained possession for the third time in the game when Patulski blocked a Marty McGann punt and the Irish. 
recovered the loose ball  at  the  
'Cat 32.  
I<:tter  came  in  to  direct  the  

attack J!fld wasted little time in 
moving his club in for the score. After running for two yards, the neet-footed senior broke loose around right end for 17 yards, picking up the first first down of the game. Andy Huff carried for three yards to the ten and then I<:tter scrambled for seven more yards around the right side, giving the Irish another first down. Eddie Gulyas, behind a strong block by Huff, carried into the end zone on the next play to score the first Notre Dame touch­down of the season. Brown's conversion kick gave the Irish a 
7-0  lead  with  7:55  left  in  the  
quarter.  
That advantage  didn't  last  

long, however The Wildcats took the ensuing kickoff and marched 77 yards in nine plays for the 
tying touchdown. 

AI Robinson took a 16 yard pass from Daigneau to start the drive rolling. McGann kept things going when, on a fourth and eight situation at the Northwestern 45, he faked a punt and passed to nanker Barry Pearson at the Irish 39. A questionable pass interference call on Clarence Ellis gave the 'Cats a first down on the N.D. 23. Daigneau hit split end Jim Lash for another first down at the Irish seven and then completed a short toss to John Cooks for the score. Bill Planisek's placement tied the score, 7-7. 
Late in the quarter, the Irish began the drive that was to put them on top for good. Starting on their own 32, Notre Dame moved to the 'Cat 42 by the end of the quarter. The Irish turned around and continued their march to paydirt. On a second and 14 situation at the N.U. 42 I<:tter lobbed a perfect pass to halfback Bill Gallagher good for 32 yards. Two plays later, with 
13:18 to go in the half, Bobby Minnix broke off right tackle and battled into the end zone from four yards out. Brown converted to make it 14-7. 
Steenberge led the Irish to their third score of the game, making a couple of big third down plays while taking the club 41 yards in eight plays. The Erie, Pa., junior tossed a screen pass to Tom Gatewood good for 18 yards and picked up 11 yards himself on a keeper on successive third down situations. Steenberge flipped an eight yard pass to Gatewood for the touchdown. The TO grab was 
Gatewood's 16th in his career, 
tying him with Jim Seymour for 
the all-time N.D. mark. Brown 
converted again for a 21-7 N.D. 
lead. 
f<'rom that point on the game was totally controlled by the Irish. The 'Cats were forced to play catch-up football, putting the ball in the air at every op­portunity, and had to pay the price: numerous interceptions. 
Schlezes' first swipe gave the Irish good field position and the offense converted that op­portunity into three points when sophomore walk-on Bob Thomas booted a 36 yard field goal, with 5:37 to play. 
Notre Dame added another 

score before halftime and this, 
too, was set up by an intercepted 
pass. Ellis picked off a Daigneau 
aerial at the N.D. 44 and returned 
it to the 'Cat 40. 
With John Cieszkowski doing the brunt of the ball carrying, it took the Irish eight plays to reach paydirt, Cieszkowski going over from the four after a block by Jim Humbert cleared the way. Brown's extra point attempt was wide and the half ended with the Irish on top, 30-7. 
The Irish had limited the Wildcats to just eight yards rushing and 85 yards passing in the first half while grinding out 161 yards rushing and picking up 93 yards passing themselves. In the second quarter, the Irish controlled the ball for 11:09 and ran 32 plays to Northwestern's 14. 
The final two quarters were anti-climactic. The Wildcats threatened to score only once, reaching the N.D. 15 early in the fourth quarter, but that drive was thwarted when Eric Patton and Tom Freistroffer dumped Daigneau, causing him to fum­ble, and Tim Sullivan recovered for the Irish. 
Notre Dame scored three 

touchdowns in the second half, 
two of them coming on long runs 
with intercepted passes. 
Stepaniak made his scoring jaunt 
late in the third quarter, making 
a beautiful theft of a Daigneau 
pass at the 'Cat 40 and romping 
down the sidelines for six points. 
Crotty registered another 

score for the Irish defense with 
12:21 remaining, picking off an errant Cat pass and racing 65 yardsfor the touchdown.Thomas kicked the extra point to make it 43-7. 
The Irish reached paydirt once more. After Schlezes had returned his third interception of the day 46 yards to the 'Cat 22, llrown took the second stringers in for a score. Sophomore Greg Hill went over left tackle for the tally and Thomas booted the conversion for Notre Dame's 5oth point. 



None of the Irish quarterbacks fared too well statistically. Steenberge complete just five of 16 passes for 54 yards and a touchdown, Etter hit on two of six for 39 yards and Brown connected on 2 of 5 for 21 yards but had two passes, including his first as a collegian, intercepted. 
Etter was Notre Dame's leading rusher, picking up 59 of the club's 242 yard total. Minnix, with 41 yards, was second in the rushing parade. 
Gatewood led the Irish receivers, making three grabs, good for 33 yards and a touch­down. 
The Irish picked up 175 yards in

United Nations, N.Y.-United Nations Secretary General U Thant l sincel950. issued his last annual report in which he spoke bluntly and made judgments that are likely to displease some members. Thant asked ' that the U.N. be given more power under his successor and said that

Bonn -After 16 hours of talks with Soviet leaders, West German Chancellor Willy Brandt said that his most vivid impression was a new and positive realism on the part of Leonid Brezhnev toward the problems of Europe and relations with the West. Brandt said that the Soviet leadership realized that he was talking to them with the approval and the cooperation of the United States.

Based ·on these assurances, American officials said that they doubted that the cease-fire was in any danger of collapse.
