University tuition hits 
$33,407 
Increase is fifth in five years at Notre Dame 
By AMANDA MICHAELS Assistant News EJiror 
A Notre Dame diploma just got a little more valuable ­that is, in terms of how much it costs. 
The University announced Friday that tuition for under­graduates will inernase 5.H percent l'or the 2006-07 school year -up $1,S65 from the eurrent academic: year's bill. 
Deeided at tho winter Board of Trustnes mentings in Hornn, the total eost for a year or undergraduate edueation will be $42,137, including $33.407 for tuition and $H,730 for avnr­age room and board ratns. Tuition increases for the other schools eonneeted with Notrn Dame are 5.H percent as well, bringing costs for the Graduate Sehool to $32,HOO and both the Law School and Mastnr's of Business Administration Program to $33,670. 
Though any tuition hike is painful for bill-paynrs, this year's incrnasn signals a level­ing out in eornparison to the last five increases. Thn 2005­06 acadnrnic year saw a 7 por­cent rise, slightly higlwr than 2004-05's (~,1) percent and 2003-04's 6.5 percnnt incrnas­ns. The 2001-02 and 2002-03

Lessons learned 
Nter three and a half years of class presentations and journalism inter­views, a room full of elementary school kids shouldn't have fazed me, right? 
Nevertheless, I found myself quite nervous Thursday as I drove toward Nuner Primary Center in Mishawaka. My friend Becky, stu­dent teacher in a fourth grade class­room there, thought I would be a good addition to her lesson on newspapers. In other words, I was the guest expert. 
Now, I would like you to stretch your memory back to your own ele­mentary school days when there was a classroom visitor. Remember how wise that classroom visitor seemed? How professional? How ... old? 
I felt compelled to do my best to live up to this image. I evp,n wore my most adult outfit: button-down shirt, wool slacks and heels, but I still felt I embodied none of the aforementioned characteristics. Instead, I felt like a stage actress with a tape recorder and notebook as props. 
What I was most concerned about, however, was not seeming grown-up or impressive. I was terrified of being · boring. I had an image of glazed-over eyes staring back at me, or worse yet, heads resting on desks. I didn't want to be yet another reason why kids tell their parents their day at scbool was "tine." 
Nter the students filed in from lunch, settled in their chairs and turned expectantly to me, I launched into my "journalism is exciting" spiel. I told them all about working for The Observer, stalking sources around campus and laying out pages until God-awful hours of the morning. 
After a few minutes I felt myself relax. Maybe I could teach them some­thing interesting about the newspaper business. I certainly believed every­thing I was saying. Journalism is excit­ing, and the hard work is rewarding. 
Further, I had forgotten about the hyperactive energy and the overactive curiosity of the average fourth-grader. After every sentence I uttered, hands shot up in response. Many, of the ques­tions were quite smart and made me consider things that I had not thought about in a long time. 
Once or twice I called on students only to have them forget what they were going to say because they were so excited. Other times the response had absolutely nothing to do with the topic of conversation. A couple of the students had started their own news­paper and they provided me with a copy. 
All in all, it was a very enjoyable afternoon. I got the chance to see my friend operate in her professional envi­ronment and to admire how hard she is .working to engage her students every day. But the afternoon also served to remind why I am pursuing my chosen career path and gave me the opportunity to get excited about my future.

Poll aims to find the best ­kept bathrooms 
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. ­Call it the Toilet Bowl. A bathroom supply company sponsoring an online poll aimed at finding America's best bathroom has narrowed the field to five sparkling­clean, sweet-smelling pot­ties. 
A Michigan bistro, a Rhode Island seafood house, a New Jersey casino, an Illinois air­port and an Ohio restaurant are the fmalists in the eon­test, which will name a win­ner in April based on the number each receives in admittedly nonscientific online voting. 
"It's a big compliment, sur­prisingly," said contest organizer Jessica Bensten. "People get really excited." 
Sponsored by Cincinnati­based Cintas Corp., manu­facturer of Sanis restroom supplies, the America's Best Restroom contest was start­

Increase

rises, however, w11re the lowest the University had seen in 40 years at 4.5 percent. 
University spokesman Dennis Brown attributed the compara­tively smaller increase from the past two years to a strong per­formance by the University's endowment, as well as greater income from its auxiliary enter­prises, including the Hammes Bookstore, athletics, licensed merchandise and laundry. 
"Because we can draw more from the University endow­ment, there is less of a need to significantly raise tuition," Brown said. 

University President Father John Jenkins announced the tuition hike to parents and guardians of students returning next year in a letter mailed last week. In the letter, he explained that Notre Dame needed the revenue from high­er educational costs "to attract and sustain a superb faculty, administer and maintain a large and complex physieal plant, and secure a peaceful, hopeful and pleasant environ­ment for our students." 
In the letter, Jenkins also affirmed that the University 
"remains firmly committed to being affordable and accessible to a talented and diverse stu­dent body," indicating Notre Dame's total student charges continue to remain below the average of its peer institutions, as determined by the U.S. News & World Heport survey of America's best colleges. In that survey, Notre Dame is listed as the 18th best college in America in 2006, and the 19th best value in education. 
Brown said the University will not only continue to meet all students' demonstrated finan­cial needs, but plans to reduce the proportion of need-based aid constituted by loans, lean­ing more heavily on monetary scholarships. 

"Over the past 15 years or so, our University scholarship aid has grown from $5.4 million to more than $60 million per year, and that's been the highest pri­ority in the University's fundraising and budgeting and continues to be so," Brown said. "So, while the tuition number does grow, financial aid grows even more." 
The funds from the tuition increase will go into the General Operating Budget, which allocates money for a wide range of University func­tions, including the salaries for the faculty and staff and the daily costs of running an aca­demic institution. 
"There is a continuing need to balance the fiscal realities of operating the University while maintaining some constraint lon tuition increases] while needing to improve upon the educational experience we pro­vide," Brown said. "It's a bal­ancing act, like everything else in our world. The costs of oper­ating any sort of organization continually increase, and at the University, tuition helps to drive in a significant way our overall budget."

The Robinson Center offers a variety of educational, health and lead­ership programs aimed to enrich the lives of volunteers and participants. 
Jenkins said he -along with fellow key community leaders -remains commit­ted to the Center, which has seen its number of volunteers and employees more than triple in the last live years. 
"[The Robinson Center! is instrumental with forging and sponsoring relationships within the community. I hope to continue to foster this strong relationship," Jenkins said. "The Center brings peo­ple together and makes great contribution to this neighbor­hood."

"[Robinson Center] increas­es horizontal relationships, and allows for a continued healing and evolution of [res­idents'] relationship with Notre Dame," Miller said. 
South Bend resident Marva Williams said the Center's volunteers work hard to keep the Center on track. 
"Everyone does a beautiful job. They really give the youth something to look for­ward to." 
South Bend Mayor Steven Luecke said he "loved the spirit of [the Center] and the volunteers are the lifeblood of the community." 
"I am grateful for the many relationships that have been developed here at Hobinson Center," Luecke said. "There are some strains between the community and University, but Robinson Center has allowed people to eome together to implement their vision."

"Notre Dame has come together with [Northeast­side] residents to decide what to do," Miller said. 
Miller shared Northeast­side residents' quotes with the audience about the impact of the Center on the community-University rela­tionship. Many said prior to the development of the Hobinson Center they were not pleased with relations, but upon its 2001 opening, they noticed an immediate change.

Transfers

and the College of Science are sometimes more rigorous than the classes made available to Holy Cross students, making them less competitive within the transfer applicant pooL 
For sophomore transfer stu­dent Colin Ethier, who began classes at Notre Dame in January, getting to Notre Dame certainly wasn't easy. 
He was originally declined admission to the University dur­ing his senior year of high school and opted to reapply after a year attending Holy Cross. 
"It was kind of hard to transi­tion in the middle of the school year, but I have good classes and everyone has been really helpful," Ethier said. "I don't know if IHoly Cross] really helped with my acceptance, but it helped me to prepare [for Notre Darnel. I definitely felt prepared." 
Ethier -who transferred into the College of Arts and 

Letters -said the largest chal­lenge he faced when trying to transfer to Notre Dame was fig­uring out which classes he should take at Holy Cross to secure his acceptance at Notre Dame. 
"The hardest part was making sure that I had the right classes [to transfer]. Everyone tells you something different," he said. 
Sophomore Danyal Kareem transferred to Notre Dame last fall and had to take the highest­level science classes available at Holy Cross in order to get into Notre Dame's College of Science. 
While Kareem said he was glad to have made the switch to Notre Dame because Holy Cross lacked science courses for him to take after his first year, he noted differences between courses at the College and the University -differences that may have ultimately helped him transfer. 
"The classes [at Holy Cross] were smaller and the professors were able to be more involved in the courses," he said. 
Kareem said he feels he may not have had the grades to get into Notre Dame if he had tried

to transfer from a school with larger class sizes. 
And for Kareem, the hardest part of the transition was not getting used to Notre Dame classes -it was making new friends. 
"A lot of sophomores and jun­iors have already made their group of friends, which makes it harder for transfer students," he said. 
Holy Cross freshman Anthony Garcia, who was previously denied admittance to the University, hopes to reapply in the spring of 2007 to the College of Arts and Letters. 
In the meantime, however, he said he feels that attending Holy Cross allows him to go to school away from home while at the same time learning about Notre Dame's environment. 
"I've heard of many people who have had the opportunity of getting into Notre Dame [after attending Holy Cross], but I also wanted to experience the Notre Dame community altogether," he said.

Rioting prisoners seize control 
Al-Qaida and Taliban loyalists accused of inciting com1non crirninal inmates 
Associated Press 
KABUL -Summary oxe­
culions' of prisoners took 
place at the· Policharki 
prison during the Soviet 
occupation of Afghanistan 
and tho Taliban rule of the 
country. On Sunday, it was 
the inmates who were in 
charge. 
llundreds or Afghan sol­
dinrs with tanks and 
grenade-launchers sur­
rounded Kabul's main 
prison Sunday al'ter rioting 
inmates seized control of 
much of the facility in an 
uprising that officials 
blamed on al-Qaida and 
Taliban militants. 
Local media reported 
several people were killed 
and dozens injured. But it 
appeared security forces 
had yet to gain aceess to 
parts of the jail under pris­
oners' control, so of'licials 
could not eontirm reports 
of casualties. One official 
said at least four inmates 
were injured. 
Gunshots occasionally rang out as troops tried to knep thn prisoners bottled up. Oflicials said the riot­ers did not have any J'irearms but had armed themselves with small knives and clubs fashioned 
from wrncked furniture. 
Smoke could be seen 
curling out of some cell 
windows. where inmates 
apparently set lire to bed­
ding and furniture. 
Government negotiators late Sunday suspended talks to end the standoll" at tho notorious Policharki jail, which later this year is slated to receive dozens of Afghans currently in U.S. military's Guantanamo prison. 
The riot broke out late Saturday in Block Two of the prison, which houses about 1,:{00 of the 2,000 inmates. Officials said the violence began when inmates refused to put on new uniforms, which were ordered after seven Taliban prisoners escaped last month by disguising themselves as visitors. 

Offieials said some 350 al-Qaida and Taliban loyal­ists were among the il'lmates in that block. Abdul Salaam Bakshi, chief of prisons in Afghanistan, aecused them of inciting the other pris­
oners,  mostly  common  
eriminals.  
lie  said  no  inmates  

escaped from the prison block but guards had been forced out. 
The Afghan army said it deployed 800 soldiers around the prison. Along with NATO peacekeepnrs, they parked at least 10 tanks and armored person­nel carriers outside the gates. 
"We have surrounded the jail. There's no way to escape, Mohammed Qasim llashimzai, deputy justice minister, said. 
llashimzai, who was part of a government delegation that came to negotiate with the prisoners, said at least four inmates had been hurt. 
He said about 100 of the rioters from Block Two had taken control or the neigh­boring wing of the jail housing about 70 women. 
Another senior govern­ment official, who would speak only on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said prisoners had dug a tunnel to the women's wing -explaining how they had managed to infil­trate it. 
Ilashimzai said altnmpts to negotiatn the rnlPase ol' the women from the riot­ers' control floundered because of disunity among tim inmates and confusion over their various demands. Prisoners also backtraekml on an agree­ment to hand over thnir injurnd to the International Hed Cross, he said. 
"Unfortunately, tho pris­oners have no unity and have different demands. Thorn's no one leadnr who ean talk to us," llashimzai said as he left the prison around dusk, adding that officials would try to resume rwgotiations Monday. 
lin gave no details about the prisoners' demands.

"The push for student involve­ment grew organically, if you will, and was shared by all of us," Gude told The Observer in an e­mail Sunday. 
In 2001, the Standing Committee's student membership grew from four to six students ­a jump accompanied by an increased workload, she said. 
"The Committee became heavily involved in educa­tional programming was given standing status the fol­lowing year. 
Since the Committee's forma­tion, Poorman said the group has directed educational programs on issues affecting gay, lesbian and bisexual students, hall staff pro­grams, CommUnity sessions for freshmen, the Network program to help staff members promote "safe spaces," coffee hours and events surrounding Solidarity Sunday and National Coming Out Day. 
"Part of the impetus for this [restructuring] is we really would like to broaden our sources for this [programming]," Poorman said. 
Tiffany Thompson, a senior who has served on the Standi][lg Committee for three years, said she has seen "a greater desire" for

ing with more stu­dents who support our gay and lesbian students." 
Poorman, who sits on the com­mittee along with Gude, Director of Campus Ministry Father Richard Warner and St. Edward's rector Father Tom Eckert, said he has attended most of the group's meetings this academic year. 
He said while the "serious con­siderations" to restructure were discussed during the past four to five weeks, the idea is not com­pletely new. 
"Elements of the discussion have been in the works for a while," Poorman said. 
Poorman said University President Father John Jenkins, who attended a Standing Committee meeting last semester, was briefed on the restructuring and was "comfortable" with the changes. 
"Since the creation of the Standing Committee in 1996 and the adoption of our 'Spirit of Inclusion' [statement] a year later, Notre Dame has sought to better address the needs of our gay, les­bian and bisexual students within the parameters of Catholic teach­ing," Jenkins said in a statement Friday. "I am grateful for the dedi­cated work of committee mem­bers the past 10 years, and, with the evolution of this new council, I am excited about this important step forward." 
Gude said it was "hard to say" what the long-term impact of the change would be. 
"Better communication, certain­ly, among those interested in issues facing the gay community, and a chance to work together on given events," she said, 
The Standing Committee was created in 1996, emerging from a hotbed of campus debate. In January 1995, the Office of Student Aflairs banned the unoffi­cial student group Gay and Lesbian Students of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's (GLND/SMC) from meeting on campus. 
The deeision sparked clamor across and beyond campus, receiving national media atten­tion. Then-Vice President of Student Affairs Patricia O'Hara released an open letter on March 6, 1995 establishing the Ad Hoc Committee on Gay and Lesbian Student Needs in order to "move beyond the painful polemics that have characterized the discussion in recent weeks." The committee 
said. 
Thompson said she hoped the restructuring would result in greater commmli­cation between campus groups, students and the administration. 
''I'm very excited about the changes," she said. "I think it -will lead to a more efficient group and help connect the Standing Committee to the rest of the cam­pus." 
Andy Magee, a senior who has sat on the Standing Committee fi)r two years, said recent campus discussions surrounding topies · such as the former Queer Film Festival and the unrecognized gay/lesbian student grou:p AllianceND made restructuring necessary. 
"There's a lot that's happened on campus in the past few yeaJrs regarding gay and lesbian stu­dents, and a lot of times it seems the Committee has been behind a bit," Magee said. · 
While Magee said he did not think the idea behind the restrue­turing to increase student involve­ment with the Committee substi­tuted for AllianceND's efforts to win official club recognition from the University administration, he believes it will provide an outlet for the unofficial group. 
"Ideally under this new system they'll be able to say, 'Hey, can you help us with this?' ... The idea is that a student group that wan1ts to do programming [can work through the Core Council]," he said. 
Magee, who is pursuing a dual degree, will maintain his position with the Core Council next year as a fifth-year senior. Members who will be leaving the Committee include Thompson, who will graduate, and Gude, who will retire after the spring semester. 
Eckert said he planned to keep his seat on the Council. Warner was not available for comment Sunday. 
While there is not a specific timeframe for the restructuring, Poorman said he hopes to accept applications this spring from stu­dents interested in sitting on the Council. The next step is to elect a sfudent co-chair.

what measures were taken to stop the problem after it first occurred, or allowing landlords to pass their fine onto tenants. 
The tension between stu­dents and South Bend has been represented in the back-and-forth debate between Baron and Assistant City Attorney Ann­Carol Nash since the sum­mer. While neither side has shifted positions, Baron said student government's appearance at today's Common Council meeting will be important in continu­ing to push for a student voice. 
"Our attendance at the Council over the summer was important," Baron said, referring to his, off­campus president Matt Wormington and several senators' presence at June and July meetings dis­cussing the proposed amendment. "It was a learning experience for us as student leaders, to see how they went about dis­cussing these matters. This seems like a natural step to take ... to give our perspec­tive on the way it has played out for students." 
The six presenters will be student body vice president Lizzi Shappell, Community Relations committee mem­ber Shawn Finlen. Community Relations com­mittee chair Nick Guzman, Judicial Council president James Leito, Wormington and Baron. 
"Hopefully, they [Common Council members] will engage us beyond the meet­ing," Baron said. "That's, I think, the best-case see­nario." 
But Baron also hopes the presentation will help a new tradition take root-to have student government play a "participatory role" in South Bend. 
"This would be the begin­ning of student participation at Common Council meet­ings, which I think is a more feasible goal," he said. 
And the fight won't end if the Common Council doesn't consider Senate's resolution, Baron said. 
"It would not be the end step at all," Baron said. "At the same time we've been reaching out to the Council, we've reached out to land­lords as well ... to let them know they don't have to evict [student tenants]." 
Baron said the presenta­tion would also emphasize the efforts student govern­ment has taken to promote a healthier relationship between the Notre Dame and South Bend communi­ties, such as the partnership with Transpo and communi­ty relations letter to the stu­dent body passed by Senate on Nov. 9 that "addressed frankly there are some elit­ist attitudes" among Notre Dame students. 
"[We want] to show them we're taking some initiative in our own ranks," Baron said.

Mine safety laws scrutinized 
Recent tragedies raise questions on lack of attention and action in the past 
Associated Press 

MOHCANTOWN, W.Va.­The number remains astonishing -16 West Virginia coal miners dead in a month. 13 of them trapped underground by an explosion, awaiting res­cuers who came too late for all but one. 
The string of back-to­hack, highly publicized tragedies has shaken the No. 2 coal-producing state and the No. 2 coal-produc­ing nation to the core. Anguished families are wondering what went wrong, politicians are demanding new laws, and labor leaders are asking why technology has largely passed them by. 
But coal mine accidents in China, tho world's top producer, kill an average of 16 workers a day.

I think we've all had this thought at one point or another. You're at a dorm dance and all of a sudden you hear the sweet serenade of an '80s hair band. You can easily imagine a true fan of this genre, playing~ some righteous licks on his air guitar, mullet flapping in the breeze while his black Quiet Riot T­Shirt and acid­washed jeans declare his lifelong dedica­tion to all things rock. Then you ask yourself, "How could anybody take this stuff seriously?" 
It's easier than you would think, and it's happening again right now. After spending the past weekend in St. Louis, home of Nelly and Chingy, I made a startling realization: hip-hop is the modern hair band. I think at this point I need to make an important dis­tinction. When I say "hip-hop," I don't mean all hip-hop, but rather a distinct brand of it. Just as all the rock bands in the '80s were not hair bands, so too not all hip-hop acts today are the type of hip-hop I'm talking about. From now on, I'll be referring to this specific brand of hip-hop as "bling-hop" to avoid confusion. Think "My Humps" by the Black Eyed Peas, and you'll catch my drift. 
Right, back to my assertion that bling-hop is the modern-day hair band. Initially, they don't seem to have a lot in common. One set wore the tightest leather and cheetah-print Spandex pants that money could buy, and the other opts for all of Subway Jared's old Dockers. One belted like

banshees, and the other prefers the smooth flow of their rhymes. The Damn Yankees were wondering, "Can You Take Me High Enough?" On the other hand, Lil' Jon just wants you to "Get Low." Aquanet and cornrows. If I placed the Black Eyed Peas and White Snake next to each other, you'd never believe that these groups are, at heart, the same. Trust me, the similarities are there. 
First, let's start with the spelling. For some reason, both hair bands and bling-hop artists decide to give Webster the finger and spell their names like they're cheating at Scrabble. The '80s were a Motley Crue infested with Ratt. In fact, they rocked so hard, they could probably even make a Leppard Def. On the other hand, the spelling of some bling-hop acts today is far from Fabolos. I bet that many people would even declare that these spelling atrocities are Ludacris. The similarities between these two groups are numerous, and poor spelling is just the tip of the ice­berg. lceburg? No, it's iceberg. 
Furthermore, there's the issue of superfluous facial accessories. Hair bands bucked the system by taking to the Avon counters and covering them­selves in rouge·and eyeliner. Also, each member of a hair band (even the key­boardist) had to have a personal hole in the O-Zone above their head from copious hairspray usage. But bling-hop doesn't get a free pass here. Some of these acts decide to coat their mouths with grills made of platinum or gold. In fact, our old friend Nelly just wrote a song about these grills. It's called "Grillz." So we've moved on from spelling, but the similarities persist. 
But lastly and most importantly, the key similarity between these two groups is that the emphasis on their work is the lifestyle rather than the music. Style over substance, crunk over content. Hair bands were about living fast, partying hard, and rocking out. We've all seen the "Behind the Music" specials; it truly was sex, drugs and rock n' roll. It was more important that they lived like a rock star, even if they didn't necessarily sound like one. Likewise, a modern bling-hop artist needs to portray a certain lifestyle. lie needs to have the Escalade rolling on 22's, the house payment hanging around his neck and diamonds crammed wherever there is room for cramming. Just watch music videos from either era to catch these lifestyles. A hair band video consists of lots of hot chicks, driving a fast car or a crazy party. A bling-hop video shows lots of hot chicks (again). riding on some spinners (they don't stop) and popping the Crista!. This is where the heart of their similarities lies; the lifestyle you present is as, if not more, important than the music you create. 
As you can see, the mullet may have faded, but its spirit lives on. It's not that either genre is bad, but it's impor­tant to recognize that they exist as a simple pleasure, not serious artistic expression. I fully anticipate that in 20 years, kids will be at a virtual SYH or jetpack-dancing at the bar, and they'll hear some "It's Getting Hot In Herre," and wonder how we ever bought into this stuff.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Supporting Readership in a different vvay 
I am writing in response to a letter submitted by Joe Brutto ("Supporting readership," Feb. 24) about supporting the College Readership Program. In it, he attacks the Club Coordination Council for not supporting the College Readership Program and for providing "funds to a plethora of student run organizations, the majority of which no one cares about." First of all, I want Joe to tell the 1,088 student leaders of these organizations that no one cares about their organizations. Also, I want him to say that to the over 7,000 students that are involved in these organizations. The College Readership Program only pro­vides newspapers for one in four stu­dents on this campus. The Club Coordination Council provides funding that three fourths of the students on this campus will use. 
In addition, biased reporting has led many members of campus to believe that the Club Coordination Council is against the College !leadership Program. This is completely false. Dave Baron, Student Body President, and Beth

O'Shaughnessy, Club Coordination Council President, have been working closely together in an effort to find a new way to fund the College Readership Program. 
The Club Coordination Council sup­ports the College Readership Program. It is a great way to keep the student body informed of issues outside of the Notre Dame world. The Council is opposed to the cut in the money that will go toward campus clubs and organizations. 
Every year, students put their passion into creating new clubs and expanding existing ones. These clubs allow stu­dents to do many things they normally would not be able to do. They give stu­dents opportunities to compete in sports in college, perform plays and musicals, complete community service projects, increase awareness of world issues, learn about new cultures and increase their academic knowledge outside of the classroom. 
In addition to improving life on cam­pus, these clubs give students leadership and economic experience for the real

world. Cutting the hard line percentage that the Club Coordination Council receives from student activities fees will affect the future of campus clubs and organizations. It will be harder for new clubs to be introduced to our campus and for existing ones to continue. The Club Coordination Council is looking for ways to fund the College Readership Program that will not take away from three of every four students. With the amount of money that comes through this University, there has to be an alter­native. 
In closing, I would like to encourage Joe to join just one of the campus clubs that may remotely interest him. Since his money is already going toward the club, maybe he will see the benefit that over 7,000 students at Notre Dame are already taking advantage of.

Chance to set exam_ple 
In response to Alex Forshaw's letter ('"Fair wages' not fair at ·all," Feb. 23) regarding the living wage debate, I feel that it is nec­essary to step back and takfl a look at the purpose of Notre Dame as a university and as a Catholic institution. Mr. Forshaw said, "The University's main pur­pose is to serve its students with the best learning environment possible." This statement is true, but incompletn. The University must snrve its students with tho best learning environment possi­bln-in limns of the Christian community in whieh it strives to be a leader. A neeessary way of doing this is to be an example of Catholic behavior to the students whom the University is teaehing. Paying our employees living wage is one way to be such an exam­ple. 
Many peoplf1 opposed to the liv­ing wagn, including Forshaw, havn mnntioned market-based faetors as reasons for keeping nmployees' wages at current lnv­els, and they are correct in terms or the large-seale economy. Companies in free-market soei­elins arn motivated by the need to make a prol'it, and thus raise their employees' pay only when market forces dietate. Many of these opponents fear that a mandatory increase of the mini­mum wage would cause such companies to "find ways to replace many of them [the employees] with machinery that can get the job done more cheap­ly," in the words of Forshaw. As I said before, this is correct when one looks at the nationwide, large-scale market economy. 
However, Notre Dame is not a profit-based company. Notre Dame is an educational, private­ly-funded institution that is not at the mercy of market forces. This means that its Christian values, not the market, should dictate wages and consequently compel it to raise its employees' wages without reducing their numbers. Considering the size of its endow­mont ($3 billion) and its rapidly­inflating tuition, which will almost certainly rise again next year (with or without a living wage policy). If the University cannot or will not pay a living wage to its staff, its Catholic character in this respect would be, at best, dubious.

ND hotnogeneity a 'crisis' 
"The Vagina Monologues" as performed here looked like a rhetorical attempt to win over Notre Dame from implicitly fearing all sexuality to celebrating female sexuality while demonizing male sexuality. This is progress of sorts. Within the wider debate about how Notre Dame is to retain its Catholic character, I'd like to raise the following concerns. It's hard to be an inclusive community when the judgment of objective disorder plants poison in our heads before we, even start talking. 
There's a danger that our community will drift further from the conversation of the present age. We are closing doors and putting up signs that tighten the concentric circles of the normative around us like a cilice until those drawn here will be more like us. And indeed we may one day look around and real­ize that we have built right here a union of individuals in a community that treads on earth but has its heart in heaven, but at what price? 
The crisis of Notre Dame's homogeneity isn't that we fail to represent -like some perfectly proportioned stained glass window -the eth­nic map of the United States. It's that it sug­gests the signals we're sending out are dis­suading the dilleront from joining us at the discussion table. 
When sending out a message, it's under­standable that Notre Dame should feel accountable to iL.:; alumni; the alumni them­selves serve as a conservative ballast to remind us that ideologically, we're account­able to a great deal more. And it would be fatal to the University's sense of self ifit were to try to deny ilc.; allegiance to the palimpsest doctrine of Catholic tradition; but let's also remember that part of the audioneo lilf those messages we're sending out is prospnctivn students. 
This may be the thin end of the wedge. Some members of the administration who went to see the 1932 Noel Coward play "Design for Living" at the I WAC l<Lc.;t smnostor reportedly came away with the opinion that its themes rendered the play too mature for undergraduates to perform. (;ood art is het­eroglossic, and I don't envy the committee that would be entrusted to artkulate defonsi­ble judgment calls on whieh theatrieal per­formances should and should not bo spon­sored by a true Catholic university. 
Having an explicit and consistnnt proeeduro would at least endow assessmenlc.; with the semblance of legitimacy -and an appeals process ought to be instated for tho same ma­son. But this path will impact diversity (of peo­ple and ol'ideas), contestation and our partici­pation in the richness of contemporary lili~. 
It's good to bo in conversation with people who aro dill'erent than us. Our neurotic publk hand-wringing about our Catholic identity in the academic context jeopardizes tho univer­sality of our eonversations. In the short term it may do this by polarizing tho liold of diseourse around the right answor. In tho longnr-torm it may do this by its eflect on admissions.

Simply Shakespeare 
AFTLS downplays staging, highlights acting for 'The Merchant of Venice' 


By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Assistam Scene Editor 
Actors From the London Stage (AFTLS) performed William Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" this weekend in the Decio Mainstage of the DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts (DPAC). The performance was a part of the Spring ArtsFest and also their regular appearance for the semes­ter. 
The play, which is one of Shakespeare's most controversial come­dies, began with a brief prologue that introduced each character and how each actor was going to play him or her. This was an absolute necessity because each actor portrayed multiple charac­ters, sometimes in the same scene. Using costuming or inflected manner­isms, the actors established how they were going to differentiate between each character. 
Often, the changes were subtle, espe­cially in the costuming. At times, a sash or sunglasses were the only notable indicators. In previous plays presented by the AFTLS, this sometimes led to confusion as it became difficult to follow who was who. But this particular group of actors' impressive talent made the play easy to understand throughout. 
"The Merchant of Venice" follows 

Bassanio {Christopher Staines), who needs a loan of 3,000 ducats to properly woo Portia {Isabel Pollen). He approach­es his friend Antonio (Gregory Cox), whose fortune is invested in several merchant ships at sea. Antonio gets the loan from the Jewish moneylender Shylock (Tim Hardy). 
Shylock bitterly hates. Antonio, whom he feels has insulted him for being a Jew. Shylock agrees to the loan on the condition that if it is not fully paid with­in three months, the penal­ty is a pound of Antonio's

Hardy's portrayal emphasizes the villain dimension, par­ticularly in his powerful rendition of the "If you prick us, do we not bleed?" monologue. But the monologue's place­ment right before the intermission cast a surprisingly dark pall over the rest of the proceedings. 
Additionally, .the A-ctors From the London Stage version of the play ends on a disquieting note, as Shylock's daughter Jessica {Louise Yates), who has eloped with Lorenzo {Tim Hardy) learns of her father's fate. Though Shakespeare probably intended the play to end happily, the ending presented by AFTLS is darkly indefinite. While cer­tainly affecting, this ending seems oddly inappropriate -"The Merchant of Venice" is, after all, a comedy, and an ambiguous ending is thus problematic. 
Still, all of the acting was quite good 
and the play was enter­
taining and swiftly paced 
characters. 
Staines had a hilarious scene as Arragon, whose comical misfortune was much deserved, and Pollen and Yates seemed to have a great time switching between male and female characters. The use of singing -the actors were excellent singers, especially Hardy, who has a background in opera -and brief musical interludes gave the play·a wel­come added dimension. 
The Decio Mainstage was a good loca­tion for the performance. None of the actors used microphones but were still easily audible, even in the balcony. This gave the show a warm, personal feel, and the actors took full advantage of the stage. Most of the time, they sat on stage {even in scenes they were not in), which allowed them to "enter" and "exit" on cue. 
Costuming and staging was minimal, as per the AFTLS standard. Most of the cast wore contemporary clothes {button down shirts and pants), but this wasn't necessarily a deterrent. Never once is "The Merchant of Venice" presented as a period piece, which instead allows the audience to concentrate on the poeti­cism of Shakespeare's writing and the skill of the actors. While the perform­ance did rely on some key props, most of them were actually used to help dif­ferentiate between characters. 
The Actors From the London Stage almost always put on a great show, and "The Merchant of Venice" was no exception. Though only Staines has toured with the group before {as part of 2004's "A Midsummer's Night Dream"), they almost always manage to pull together a great show, despite -or per­haps because of-the performance's artsy minimalism.

FENCING 

Irish finish behind Buckeyes on home turf 
Sterns pulls off upset 
over defending sabre 
national champion 
By JACK THORNTON Sports Writer 
If Sesame Street had sponsored this weekend's Midwest Conference Fencing Championship, the number would be "two." The Irish took second place out of a field of 16 

-
teams in all six team categories, earning second place for women's overall. men's overall and combined overall. 
"We did well, but [Sunday] I think we could've done better," women's epeeist Kim Montoya said. "Not that we sucked, but we 

-weren't at the top of our game." Coming in with the No. 1 ranked men's team and the No. 10 women's team, the Ohio State Buckeyes made a powerful state­ment by winning Sunday's team portion with 1,325 points to Notre Dame's 1,260. The Buckeyes took first overall in every category besides women's foil, which Northwestern won. "Earlier this year we beat [Ohio State] in women's, and today they took revenge," head coach Janusz Bednarski said. "It's not a shame to lose against such good fencers, but it is a sigri that you have to work to be better." The weekend was structured with individual competitions Saturday and the team competi­tion Sunday. While placing second to the Buckeyes was disappointing, the weekend was still full of exciting moments. During Saturday's 
Individual Competition, Matthew Sterns pulled off a convincing 15­8 upset of last year's men's sabre National Champion Jason Rogers in the quarterfinals. Moments later in the men's sabre final, Notre Dame's Patrick Ghattas fell 15-12 to Ohio State's Adam Crompton in one of the most memorable bouts of the week­end. 
On the women's side, freshman Emilie Prot improved her already stellar season by taking first in the women's foil, earning the only gold medal for any Irish fencer. 
"The highlight of the match to me is the gold medal won by Emilie Prot," Bednarski said. "She gives us this feeling of potential of a young team." 
Overall; Notre Dame fencers won eight medals in the individ­ual session. Four of them were bronze medals -l\:ladeline Stephan (women's epee), Addi Nott (women's foil), Jakub Jedrkowiak (men's foil) and Sterns (men's sabre) -and three were silver medals won by Valeri Providenza (women's sabre), Greg Howard (men's epee) and Ghattas (men's sabre). 
Bednarski said that perhaps his young team needed a wakeup call. 
"I will say it will bring us to reality ... perhaps this will teach the kids that good talent doesn't explain that good teams will come out and work hard. The kids, maybe, were too confident," he said. 
Shortly after the Championship concluded, the Irish were already looking to the future. 
"This is kind of our chance to scope out the competition and next week we'll be better pre­pared, and I think we'll do a lot better," Montoya said. 

"We're going to be facing the same people next weekend, so it's good to fence them now so we can adjust how we practice for them and prepare for next week­end," Ghattas said. 
Though the Buckeyes' clutch performance might make them the favorites next weekend at Regionals, the·Irish know the Midwest Fencing Conference Championship is not a script for postseason play. 
"It's different at the NCAAs because you can only qualifY two for each event, so it's a totally dif­ferent tournament," Ghattas said. "And from this season, we're much better off than we were last year with 11 fencers qualified, and Ohio State will struggle to get 10." 

When these two powerhouses do collide again next weekend, Notre Dame can count on current World Cup Champion Marie! Zagunis to be fencing for the blue and gold. Zagunis missed this weekend's event because she was competing in a World Cup event in Budapest, Hungary, where she -quite appropriately -placed second overall. 
"There is a lot of work to be done -get new actions, get ready with new tactics against each other," Bednarski said. "We have a very young team, but young people are very ambitious and want more than they can have, which makes this team very unpredicatable. Give them time to mature and they will be very good in the future." 

Irish pitch way to a 3-1 record in Invitational 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 

Notre Dame made an impres­sive turnaround this weekend, "posting a 3-1 record en route to 
winning the  Golden  Panther  
Invitational  at  Florida  
International University.  

The Irish saw the rise of a defi­nite No. 2 starter in freshman Brittney Bargar. Bargar, who had pitched some in the Desert Classic in Las Vegas the previous week­end, flashed signs of brilliance this weekend, most notably in Notre Dame's first game against Buffalo, a 1-0 win for the Irish. 
Although the Bulls stymied Irish hitters, allowing only three hits and five walks, Bargar was domi­nant against Buffalo. The only run of the day came in the bottom of the third, with two runners on base and two outs, when Brittany Glynn faked a break for home on a dropped ball, sparking a pick-off attempt from Bulls catcher Lacy Schneider. Schneider's throw was off the bag, and Glynn scored easi­ly from third. 

That one run would prove to be all that was needed for Bargar, who allowed only four hits and three walks against eight strike­outs in the complete game victory. In fact, after a double by Lauren Picciano in the first inning, no Buffalo runner made it to second base against Bargar. 
The Irish also boasted the tour­nament's MVP, pitcher Heather Booth. Booth won the two middle games of the tournament with an ERA of 0.58 and 19 strikeoults while surrendering only eight total hits. Booth, a two-time first team All-Big East pitcher, showed a return to form in Miami this week­end, most notably in her first start against the host team, FlU. 
In a rain-shortened game that lasted only five innings, Booth was perfect in three of them, retiring FlU batters in order in the first (in which she struck out the side), third and fifth innings. While Booth was baffiing opposing bat­ters, the Irish offense gave her more than enough run support for the win. Despite having only one extra base hit -a double by sec­ond baseman Katie Laing-Notre Dame's aggressive base running led to a 5-0 victory. The Irish played small ball to perfection, using five sacrifices, taking extra bases at the right time and work­ing counts to their favor by strik­ing out only twice. 
The Irish continued winning on Saturday morning against Memphis 4-1, again featuring Booth's arm and Notre Dam~;J's bats. Booth surrendered only one run on six hits while also striking out 10 in her second complete game victory of the tournament. The win also demonstrated Notre Dame's ability to get runners on base and move them over when needed. Irish hitters capitalized on mistakes and created their own opportunities against the Tigers, using bunts, hit and runs, steals and errors to keep innings alive and put runners into scoring posi­tion. 

The last game the Irish played was their only loss in Miami, falling 6-5 in a rematch against FlU. This was al<>o the only game in which Iri<>h pitching and fielding were not stellar, as Bargar allowed five runs -only two of which were earned -in three innings of work. The Irish opened scoring in the first with an HBI sin­gle from Laing, but the Golden Panthers responded in the second inning with a two-run double by third baseman Samantha Card. FlU added three unearned runs in the third against Bargar, all of which resulted from a fielding error she committed. 
The Irish had a comeback rally in the fifth, pushing the score to 5­4 behind a solo home run by right fielder Stephanie Brown -who, along with Booth and shortstop Sara Schoonaert, were named to the all-tournament team -and an RBI single by catcher Malorie Lenn. But the rally ended two bat­ters later, leaving the Irish one run short of the Golden Panthers. 
The championship game of the tournament against either St. John's or FlU was cancelled due to rain, and the Irish were named the tournament champions, in1proving their record to 5-4 on the season. The Irish hope to carry this victory into next week­end's tournament at Tulsa, Okla.

MEN'S lACROSSE 

Nittany Lions overpowered by Kemp, tenacious defense 
By TIM DOUGHERTY Sports Writer 
In the preseason, co-captain and senior defenseman D.J. Driscoll said the difference between playing in the 2006 NCAA Tournament or watching it on TV would be the perform­ance of the Irish defense. In its first test of the season on Sunday, Notre Dame respond­ed to that challenge with an 8­4 triumph over Penn State at the Loftus Center, allowing the fewest goals in over a year, since April 9, 2004 -a 12-2 victory at Air Force. 
Sophomore goalie Joey Kemp recorded 13 saves, including several screaming shots from short distance, to lead a stub­born Irish resistance. 
"It all starts with our defense and Joey Kemp," Irish coach Kevin Corrigan said. "He played very well. Overall we didn't give anything away. We made them earn what they got, and Joey probably stole a cou­ple away that they earned." 
Both teams pitched first quarter shutouts until fresh­man attackman Peter Christman scored 40 seconds into the second frame on an assist by senior attackman Brian Hubschmann. The Irish capitalized on an errant Penn State pass that sophomore midfielder Taylor Clagett picked up -one of his four groundballs -to spark the score en route to a 3-2 half­time lead. 
Christman's goal was the first of two critical goals he scored in his first collegiate game on his only two shots, an accomplishment matched by fellow freshman attackman Ryan Hoff, who scored two goals on four shots. 
Another tough defensive holdout in the third quarter saw only one goal scored. With under two minutes left in the period, Penn State senior attackman -and honorable mention All-American -Nate Whitaker scored the second of three goals for the elusive offensive sparkplug of the Nittany Lions. Whitaker extended his scoring streak to 43 games, encompassing every college game of his career. 

With the game tied 3-3 in the fourth quarter, the Irish fresh­men busted the game open, each scoring consecutive goals to fuel a 5-3 lead the Irish never relinquished. 
"When you get four goals from freshmen, you got to be excited about that," Corrigan said. "They played within the game. They got opportunities, and they made them count." 
Christman and Hoff benefited from a Penn State defense that keyed on star Irish attackman senior Pat Walsh, who had lim­ited opportunities to attack the net throughout most of the game. Walsh, who days earlier was named to the Tewaaraton Trophy watch list for the nation's top player, scored the Irish's eighth goal with 1:55 left in the game -avoiding the first pointless performance of his collegiate career. 
Driscoll led the Irish with five groundballs, pacing the team's 30-27 advantage ovel'­all. 
"D.J. Driscoll played just an outstanding game all around," Corrigan said. "He was very active, played all over the place. He didn't take any bad chances and get himself in trouble." 
Although the Irish needed a fourth-quarter offensive onslaught to secure a win Sunday, Corrigan was pleased with the first three quarters of mistake-free lacrosse that set up the fourth frame outburst. 
"We did have the ball a lot," he said. "In time of possession we were in control. Clagett did a great job of facing off. We wore [Penn State) down a little bit, and [we took) advantage of that in the fourth quarter." 
Corrigan hopes the team's fundamentally sound perform­ance, led by Driscoll and Kemp's defense and Clagett's 10-for-16 face-off perform­ance, will resonate with the team as it turns its attention to No. 9 Cornell next Saturday, whom they will face in Chicago at a neutral site at 1 p.m. 
"If you play a sound funda­mental game and don't make mistakes to give away goals, you can put yourself in posi­tion to win a lot of games," Corrigan said. "There's still a lot of things we can do better. Hopefully we can keep working ha,rd and improve, and we'll have a chance to become a really good team."

The match outcome looked bleak after the doubles point, when the Irish (8-4) were swept by Ohio State. 
"That's about as badly as we can play," Bayliss said. "There was no energy, and they just took it to us. I'm glad [Ohlo State] didn't charge us tor the lesson."

as the buzzer sounded. 
"I thought we really showed our poise at the end, because we could have put our heads down and thought the game was over, but we came over, executed the play perfectly and sowed a lot of character to come back from that with two seconds left," McGraw said. "And that's why I thlnk we had the momentum going into overtime." 
In overtime, Schrader opened the scoring with 1-of-2 free throws to give the Irish a 58-57 lead. She fmished with 11 points in the game. 
After Cincinnati's Michelle Jones made a layup to give the Bearcats the lead, Schrader scored again on a feed from Gaines to give the Irish a one­point lead. 
With 2:04 left in overtime and the game tied at 62, LaVere con­verted on a three-point play thanks to Schrader's assist. 
"We wanted to get the ball inside, and Courtney did a great job down low," McGraw said. 
Schrader hit a jumper with 1:26 remaining to extend the Irish lead to five, and Duffy connected on eight straight free throws in the final 42 seconds to seal the win for Notre Dame and fmish with 17 points in the game. 
"Megan at the free-throw line really iced the game for us," McGraw said. 
Humphries was the star of the game for Cincinnati, shutting down DuffY on the defensive end most of the afternoon and putting up 14 points of her own. Humphries played the final six minutes with four fouls but held the senior All-American to just seven field goal attempts in regu­lation. 
The Bearcats' deadliest threat from outside, freshman Shelly Bellman, made just 4-of-14 field goals, including 1-of-5 from three­point range. Cincinnati entered as the second best team in the con­ference from long range but hit just 5-of-20 from behind the arc against an oft-porous Irish zone. 
Gaines finished with 14 points on 3-of-7 shooting from the floor and 8-of-9 from the line. 
LaVere joined DuffY as the hlgh­point scorer in the game, connect­ing on 8-of-11 field goals en route to her 17 points. 
McGraw said a key in getting LaVere involved was the hlgh-low passing the Irish utilized through­out the game to extend the Cincinnati defense. 
"That's out of the Princeton offense, and we've run that pretty successfully throughout year," she said. "Courtney's really good at thn high post."

nation's No. 1 doubles ranking, while Keckley and King weigh in at No. 51. 
Eric Langenkamp and Sheeva Parbhu also lost 8-2 in the No. 2 spot, as Ohio State's Drew Eberly and Bryan Koniecko clinched the point for the Buckeyes. 
Brett Helgeson and Andrew Roth fought to avoid the sweep at No. 3, but ultimately fell 8-6. 
"I had a few comments for them that weren't very flattering," Bayliss said of his team's break inbetween_ doubles and singles. "I think they realized it was put up or shut up." 
No. 17 Stephen Bass was the first to put up a win in singles, tying the match at 1-1 by defeating No. 42 Devin Mullings in No. 1 sin­gles. Bayliss called ills 6-2, 6-3 vic­tory a "signature win" for the jun­ior, who has now won six straight matches and 13 in a row at home. 
"Stephen Bass deserves a ton of credit," Bayliss said. "Mullings is a tough little street fighter and Stephen just out-toughed him." 
Helgeson, who stands at No. 60 in the national rankings, was next off with a 6-3, 6-4 win at No. 3. The win was more impressive because the freshman -who is 11-0 at home -was still recover­ing from illness. 
When Langenkamp won 6-3, 6-4 at No. 6, the Irish were one match away from clinching the win. 
"Eric did an amazing job at not making many mistakes, but also being willing to step up in the court and take advantage of short balls," associate head coach Todd Doebler said. "Our team got a lot of momentum because he was able to get off the court." 
Sophomore Parbhu would clinch the match before raucous fans in a 1-6, 6-3, 6-3 win at No. 2 singles. 
The crowd had gravitated towards Parbhu and Keckley, both playing their thlrd sets on adjacent courts in the Eck Pavilion. 
"[Parbhu] got a little tight once he knew the match was on the line, but he got more aggressive and regained his composure," Doebler said. 
The crowd remained to see Keckley, one of the team's most consistent wins in singles, post a win over Chris Klingemann 3-6, 6­3,6-4. 
"I think the pressures off !after the match is clinched] but its hard­er to play because all the guys light so hard for the team," Doebler said. "Ryan still wanted to close out that match, just because in the past we've had some really tough matches with Ohlo State." 

Keckley played at No. 4 for the first time with all the starters in the Irish lineup. 
"(It was] a big step moving hlm up to four," Bayliss said. "But, he's got a 10-1 record." 
The Eck drew a strong crowd from both local residents and stu­dent<;, as tills was the tenni'i team's designated Gold Game. 
"It's nice to see that our guys can respond to the support we got," Bayliss said.

It's time to stop making excuses and start examining what's wrong with Notre Dame.

Associate

it. Notre 
Sports Editor 

Dame still has a chance, but it will have to win its last two games and deal with potential tiebreaker situa­tions. 
That's not even the worst part. Given Marquette's intensi­ty and Notre Dame's willing­ness to allow its opponent to control the tempo, a casual fan would not have known which team was playing for its post­season life. 
The Irish should have taken charge of this game and played with the sense of urgency a team playing for its postseason life possesses. But instead, the Irish allowed Marquette to play its own style of basketball, and eliminate Notre Dame's major weapon-its 3-point shooting. 
And when the Irish did make a comeback in the second half, all Marquette needed to regain control was a quick 30-second timeout when down five points. From there, forward Steve Novak hit two 3-pointers and Marquette went on a 12-2 run the Irish could not recover from. 
This leads to another issue. Where was Notre Dame's defensive intensity in its biggest game of the season? Sure, the Irish neutralized their oppo­nent's best player for the most part (Steve Novak), but they also allowed career days from lesser-known freshmen and sophomores (Dan Fitzgerald and Jerel McNeal). 
It is no secret Notre Dame struggles on the defensive end. The Irish have the second­worst scoring defense in the Big East behind Providence, giving up 70.5 points per game. This is not going to change. But there are ways to work around specific team weaknesses. 
While Notre Dame gives up a lot of points, the Irish score more than just about anyone. The Irish have the second-best scoring ofl'ense in the Big East behind Villanova and outscore their opponents by 6.2 points per game (seventh in the league). 
But when Marquette shut down Irish guards Colin Falls and Chris Quinn (who shot a combined 3-of-12 from the field), Notre Dame failed to make the necessary offensive adjustments that could have neutralized its lack of defensive stops. 
Well, almost. Notre Dame did begin feeding the ball inside to senior forward Torin Francis, who had his best game of the season, scoring 16 points and grabbing 15 rebounds. Francis was a force in the paint and continued to show improve­ment in his ability to cnate for himself and his teammates. 
But once Marquette retook the lead in the second half, the Irish panicked on the offensive end. They went away from working through Francis (besides guard Kyle McAlarney, who looked inside all game) and settled on quick shots, even though Marquette was smoth­ering Notre Dame's perimeter shooters (the Golden Eagles had the 6-foot-10 Novak on the 6-foot-1 Quinn during spurts). 
This begs a question, too. Why did Notre Dame get away from what was working (feed­ing the ball inside to Francis) when it was trying to save its season? 
As difficult as it is to say given his high character and leadership, some of this blame has to rest on Quinn's shoul­ders. When a team is winning, the best player gets much of the credit. likewise, when a team is losing, the same player bears much of the responsibili­ty. 
Quinn was pressing against Marquette, desperate to get a necessary conference win and fight the demons that must be present in his mind. Quinn has missed the big shot on several occasions this season and it has to weigh on him mentally. 
But this issue extends far past this season alone. If Quinn had been the starting point guard before his senior year, he would not be in the position of having to lead a team while try­ing to figure out how to handle the daily pressure of being the main guy on and off the court. 
Is it head coach Mike Brey's fault? Maybe a little, but it is way more complex than blam­ing a coach who after a Sweet 16 appearance in 2003 was one of the hottest names in the country. Maybe the Irish coach places too much faith in his players and takes a backseat once the game begins. But that's not necessarily a bad thing either-he has confi­dence in his team and knows ultimately his team's perform­ance will come down to execu­tion. 
There's also another way to look at it. Maybe this is not the right approach with this specif­ic group. Maybe Brey needs to take charge and not defer to his captains in game situations. 
Either way, it is too early to call for the coach's head. Let this season play out and see how he develops a new crop of underclassmen that will not burdened by the lasting impact of an underachieving point guard who is now playing in Europe. 
But time is running out, and Notre Dame's season now comes down to two remaining games. It's too late for the Irish to control their own destiny ­they will need help from other teams at the bottom of the con­ference. 
But at the end of the day, Notre Dame's loss to Marquette was just another chapter in a season full of confusion and disappointment. A season that unless something changes in the next week. someone has to begin taking responsibility for.

points from forward Steve Novak and 18 from freshman point guard Dominic James. 
The Irish (13-12, 4-10 Big East) fell to No. 15 the in con­ference standings and must win their remaining two games to have a chance at qualifying for the Big East tournament March 8. The Golden Eagles (19-8, 9-5) improved their con­ference record and remain No. 5 in the conference. 
Marquette won the first meeting between the two teams in Milwaukee, Wise., 6 7­65, on a contested last-second shot by Novak Jan. 20. But on Saturday, the Golden Eagles played their game and were shooting foul shots at the end instead of sinking game-win­ners. 
''I'd rather get blown out by 20 than [have] a team just take it from us," freshman point guard Kyle McAlarney said after playing the most produc­tive game of his young Notre Dame career (14 points, 6-of­12 shooting, eight assists, two turnovers). 
Marquette permanently regained momentum with a 9-0 second half run behind three straight 3-pointers -one from Dan Fitzgerald (10 points). two from Novak. The Golden Eagles led 60-56 after Novak's second three fell with 5:57 remaining, despite Notre Dame having built a 56-51 advantage coming out of a 49-49 tie at the 10:58 television timeout. 
"We just had some posses­sions there -both defensively and offensively -after we were up five, [in which] we did­n't get the job done," Irish point guard Chris Quinn said. "And to beat a team like Marquette, you've got to be good in those situations." 
Notre Dame never recovered, though it had a chance. Guard Russell Carter sank two free throws with 3:31 left to cut the Golden Eagles lead to 63-60, and Marquette guard Jerel McNeal missed a shot to give the Irish the ball and a chance to draw closer or tie. 
But one shot clock violation and a turnover later, the Irish saw McNeal follow a Novak miss to send Marquette back up five and out of South Bend with a victory. 
"It hurts," Quinn said of the loss, "but a lot of them hurt." 
Notre Dame lost despite receiving a double-double from forward Tarin Francis by half­time, the first time the senior has accomplished the feat before the half. Francis had 10 points and 12 rebounds at the break but finished with 16 points and 15 rebounds, the most boards by an Irish player in one game this season. 
Notre Dame got away from the inside game down the stretch. Forward Rick Cornett also played only six minutes after making major contribu­tions in a near-upset of No. 3/4 Connecticut Tuesday. And despite McAlarney's perform­ance, the guards struggled as a group, and Notre Dame's offense paid for it. 
Marquette held Quinn (12 points, two assists, four turnovers) to 3-of-12 shooting, and Irish sharpshooter Colin Falls -who averaged 14.6 points before Saturday -did not score until he made two inconsequential foul shots with 
34.1 seconds remaining in the entire game. 
"We subbed [Quinn and Falls] a little bit, tried to loosen them up, rotated them out, just tried anything to change the atmos­phere," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "We need their legs back under them [for the next two games]. 
"I was very matter-of-fact 

with them in the locker room. Obviously we need some help [to qualify for the Big East tournament] now, but we're staring at having to win a tiebreaker with Providence on Wednesday." 
Marquette opened a 14-9 lead with 15:16 remaining in the first half by pushing the tempo and keeping Notre Dame on their heels, as Brey said afterwards, on defense. Notre Dame then scored four straight to cut the lead to one, but the Golden Eagles pulled away and maintained a lead that fluctu­ated between two and seven points until McAlarney hit a three with 5:25 left in the half to cut the lead to 27-26. 
Carter made a three to take a 29-27 Irish lead out of a Marquette timeout, and the Irish led with 3:21 remaining. But the Golden Eagles went on a 9-6 run to end the half, including a last-second lay up from Fitzgerald to send the Irish into halftime down 38-35. 
"If we would have limited transition, I think we would have been in better shape at halftime," Brey said. "We even­tually adjusted to that, but it kind of punched you first." 
Notre Dame players now face the reality of possibly seeing no postseason action at all. 
"You want to say, 'Don't worry about that. We just gotta get ready for Providence again,"' McAlarney said. "But it's really hard not to focus on that because this is what we've been playing for, [what] we've been working for all season, and now it's almost like our chances are going down. 
"But we've just got to keep working, keep bouncing back, because after all the stuff we've been through, I think we can bounce back better than anybody."

FOOTBALL RECRUITING 

Neal becomes first 2011 commitment 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Writer 
Notre Dame got its first verbal commitment of the class of 2011 Feb. 23 when 6-foot-2, 225­pound defensive end Kerry Neal told Irish coach Charlie Weis he would accept a scholarship offer. 
"I always wanted to go to Notre Dame," Neal said in a telephone interview with The Observer Sunday. "I plan on coming up [to visit] during spring practice." 

Neal, a junior at Bunn High School in Bunn, N.C., said he has never visited Notre Dame or any other schools in the Midwest, but accepted Weis' offer after return­ing a call Weis left on his high school coach's voicemail early Thursday morning. He said he was speechless when Weis made 
the offer. Neal said Weis was confident he could succeed at Notre Dame. 
"He was like, 'I've been around athletes, and I know one when I see one. And you're one,"' Neal said. 
Along with his admiration for the school, Neal said his family supports his choice of Notre Dame. 
"My (amily, they're behind me 100 percent," he said. 

Mike Frank of IrishEyes.com said Neal has not been rated by most recruiting services yet but will bring a defmite edge to the Irish defensive line. 
"l-Ie's a tremendous prospect," Frank said. "Notre Dame has a lot of defensive ends, but I don't know if they have that true pass

Buckeyes stun1ble vs. squad 
Irish knock of! Ohio State in front of big Gold Game crowd 
By KATE GALES Associate Sports Editor 

Despite a lopsided loss in doubles, the Irish rebounded to saddle Ohio State with il<> first loss this season in a 5-2 match at the Eck Tennis Pavilion Friday. 
Before an enthusiastic home crowd, the No. 26 Irish reeled oil' four straight singles wins at Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 6 to clinch the match over the No. 11 Buckeyes. 
''I'm really excited about beating a team this good," head coach Bobby Bayliss said. "And the thing that is especial­ly gratifying is the number of tough matches we had to play." 
The Buckeyes came into the match 9-0 after an upset of then-Top 10 LSU. The team was 3-0 against Top 20 teams, while the Irish were 0-4. 
"I felt that we were playing at a high enough level to beat teams in the Top 10, and we just didn't get it done, and that the wins would come," Bayliss

Decked out in its new green away jerseys, Notre Dame used a little luck of the Irish Saturday to pull off a dramatic win over Cincinnati in a crucial conference contest on the Bearcats' senior day. 
Irish guard Tulyah Gaines hit a running layup from the right side off an inbounds play to tie the game as time expired in regula­tion, and Megan Dufl)"s 10 points in the extra session led Notre Dame (16-10, 7-8 Big East) to a 75-66 overtime victory.

After Bearcats guard Treasure Humphries broke a 55-55 tie by hitting a jump shot from 12 feet with 2.4 ·seconds remaining in regulation, Notre Dame head coach Muffet McGraw called a timeout to set up her offense against Cincinnati (17-9, 7 -8).
