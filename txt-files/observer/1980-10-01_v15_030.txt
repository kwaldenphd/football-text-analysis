Corby's a-waits verdict 
by john M. Higgim 
INDIANAPOLIS-South Bend city officials wound up test­imony in the state hearings con­cerning the renewal of the liquor license ofCorby's Tavern yester­day. City Attorney Richard Hill appeared before the Indiana Alcoholic Beverage Comission to dispute earlier testimony that the city is engaging in a con­spiricy against Corby's and other

The hearing was the conclu­sion of a series of hearings stem­ming from the local ABC's rec­ommendation last April that Corby's license not be renewed because of the number of vio­lations of liquor laws and numer­ous complaints from neighbor­hood residents that Corby's is a

"public nuisance." Final briefs will be submitted by both sides to the Commission on October 21. 
Under direct examination by Assistant City Attorney James Masters, Hill refuted accusations by Corby's Tavern Industries (CTI) officer Harold Rowley that Hill, Mayor Roger Parent, and other city officials have con­spired to shut down Corby's. Hill said that he and Parent had never discussed Corby's specifically, but rather the five-points bar situation in general. 
Hill outlined the procedures his office follows when a license comes up for renewal before the local ABC. When the renewal hearing nears, Hill said, the Police Department forwards to his office any information re­garding legal violations concern­ng the license in question, noting that "in normal course, such reports do not come up until renewaL" This information is then presented before the local board. 
Hill also stated that although he had discussed with Parent special efforts to increase police

The Hall Presidents Council met last night at Dillon Hall to debate the proposed Consti­tution. Student Body President Paul Riehle put the new plan before the council and fielded questions from the group. 
A hand count of the hall representatives showed that thir­teen of the necessary sixteen dorms had already passed the Constitutional ammendment al­lowing the October 9 vote. A referendum before the entire student body is necessary for passage oftht! new Constitution. Over fifty percent of the student body must vote on the referen­dum, and two-thirds must vote in favor of the revised Constitution for the referendum to pass.

'Paper Lion ' recalls professional adventures 
By David Sarphie 
George Plimpton, also known as "The Paper Lion," entertained a capacity crowd last night at the Library auditorium with tales of his many experiences involving professional sports and show business. 

· Plimpton, a graduate of Harvard and Cambridge, des­cribed his occupation as "part­icipatory journalism." As a writer for Sports Illustrated, Plimpton has received a first-hand look at such diverse activities as quarterback­ing a professional football team, pitching in an All-Star game, and boxing the world light heavy­weight champion. 
Plimpton was introduced to this odd profession while a student at Harvard. As an 

. initiation to the campus comedy journal, Harvard Lampoon, Plimpton was required to run in the Boston Marathon. 
Plimpton, however, deviously managed to avoid the first 25 miles of the race. In true Rosie Ruiz fashion, he entered the race several strides behind the leader and only a block from the finish. Although he was out-kicked by the distance runner, Plimpton had discovered a unique way to get close to the professionals. 
In his speech Plimpton also described his first meeting with the great boxer, Muhammed Ali. He had scheduled a three-round exhibition match with the champ.

"I would say that this body would replace the CLC," said Riehle. However, if there is a future need for the CLC it may be reactivated. 
The SBP said, "the CLC hasn't been the student voice to the administration." Only nine of the nineteen members of the CLC are students. Riehle com­plained that a majority of the time last year the CLC couldn't get a quorum and couldn't ac­complish anything.

Sending planes 

U.S. to protect ...Mideast oil 
WASHINGTON (AP)-The United States is 
rushing four special early warning radar planes to ISaudi Arabia to help strengthen the oil-rich country's air defense against a possible spread of the war between Iraq and Iran, the Pentagon 
announced Tuesday. 
In announcing the shipment of the highly 
sophisticated planes, U.S. officials said the de­
ployment is temporary and stressed that the move 
does not mean the U.S. is taking sides in the Iran­
Iraq war. 
"The United States government unequivocally 
reaffirms its position of neutrality," said Pentagon 
spokesman Thomas B. Ross. 
"This deployment is purely for defensive 
purposes. It is designed to track aircraft for the 
purpose of providing additional warning for Saudi 
Arabian defenses," Ross said. 
Saudi Arabia has indicated its support for Iraq in 
the fighting with Iran. However, U.S. defense 
officials said they have no reason to believe the 
Saudis will be relaying to Iraq any military data 
provided by the American radar planes, known as 
AWACS. 
Ross told a Pentagon press briefing the decision 
to deploy the aircraft was made "in response to a 
request from the government of Saudi Arabia." 
,Defense officials said one of the big AWACS 
planes already had taken offfrom Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma and that the remaining three would be leaving for Saudi Arabia within hours. 

They said the planes were to fly directly to Saudi Arabia with in-flight refueling, covering the distance in 17 to 18 hours. 
The deployment will involve a total ofabout 300 military personnel, defense officials said. They added t;hat American cargo planes would be making flights to deliver supplies to Saudi ground facilities being used by the AWACS aircraft. 
The AWACS planes, which are modified Boeing 707 jets, carry a fligl)t crew offour plus up to 24 Air Force technical personnel to monitor radar and other electronic gear. 
Defense officials said that after the A WACS planes reach Saudi Arabia, they would be flying their early warning patrols wholly within Saudi airspace. They declined to identify where in Saudi Arabia the planes will be based. 
The AWACS deployment came in response to a formal request made by the Saudi government on Monday, Pentagon officials said, noting that the request followed several days of intensive con­sultations. 
The U.S. offidals said the AWACS planes, with a "look-down down" radar range of 250 nautical miles, will be particularly helpful in bolstering Saudi Arabia's defenses against any possible attack by low flying aircraft.

Inside Wednesday 


On October 
October. A month set aside for bier gar/ens, the World Series and midterms. And at Notre Dame, October kicks off the annual United Way cam­paign. 
Each year at this time students can be seen scurrying around campus carrying small change as donations to United Way; money that would otherwise be spent "chowing down" at food sales or drinking a few rounds at Senior Bar. This is quite admirable and everyone who contributes should be commended. After all, proceeds go to a charitable organization and Notre Dame is an institution steeped in charity. 
Those in charge of the 1980 Notre Dame campaign project 100 percent participation effort among both students and faculty members. In fact, each student is expected to pledge two dollars and faculty members are expected to pledge a small percentage oftheir month's earnings in support of the drive. 

There is a problem, liowever. For many years, alongside Notre Dame, Saint Mary's was also an avid supporter of United Way, and together both schools pooled a substantial and significant do­nation. This noteworthy sum was then ha:nded over to the local St.]oseph chapter ofUnited Way, which then distributed the money to organizations such as YMCA, GirVBoy Scouts, and 35 other groups in the area that aid the poor, the handi­capped and the elderly. 
The problem is that on September 15 the Saint Mary's Board ofGovernance single-handidly ruled to boycott this year's United Way campaign. This undemocratic decision , needless to say, has gen­erated much disbelief, disapproval and plain dis­gust among students, faculty membe.rs and admin­istrators who view United Way as a worthwhile and meaningful campus endeavor. United Way, they are arguing, has proved to be a vital human improvement organization in the South Bend area. 
The_Board's reasons for rejecting United Way are twofold: 1.) students in the past never had the opportunity to vote whether they wanted United Way as their college charity and 2.) a few of the board members questioned the validity ofsome of the organizations that are funded through United Way claiming that abortions are available through these groups. 
It is reasonably safe to say that the St. Joseph 
Pam Degnan 
chapterofUnited Way is "legitimate," a fact many South Bend residents will attest to. There are no shady, underhanded, aspects to this United Way branch. So what's wrong with giving to this specific branch? 
Lately, a cloud of confusion seems to be hovering over Saint Mary's, and it's only fair to point out that the student government leaders are doing nothing to improve the situation. The Board of Governance has decided to endorse a charity other than a United Way affiliate, which, board members promise, will be announced at a future date. So how do they justify righting one wrong with another wrong? 
It was wrong that students in the past did not have a voice in choosing United Way as the college-sponsored charity, but it is doubly wrong for the Board of Governance to reject this year's United Way campaign without a student referen­dum. 
So despite continuous urgings by faculty mem­bers (who live in the South Bend community and would be the best judges of the effectiveness of United Way) and some administrators who view the United Way drive as their "personal pet project," including SMC PresidentJohn Duggan, the Board has stood steadfast by its decision. 
Many are extremely disappointed that, as Saint Mary's students, they were denied the right to vote for what charity they would or would not like to endorse. There are approximately 2,000 students attending the college-students capable of vot­ing on an issue that does affect them, and it seems that the Board has decided to ignore this fact 
Consequently, students have banded together under the direction of Dr. Clarence Dineen, a biology professor at Saint Mary's, in organizing a United Way drive on campus. Students volunteer­ing their time and effort will be collecting money from all five dorms during the week. At least some interested Saint Mary's students are making sure that a "charitable" campaign does exist on campus despite what fellow students rashly decide for them. 
The month of October. Save those dollars. United Way is back in town.Justlook at the ugly billboard in front ofthe Administration building if you have any doubts

Marosen questions friendship 
By David Rickabaugh 
"I felt I could ease the relations between Security and the stu­dents," said former Main Gate Security Guard Steve Maroszan of the events surrounding his resignation )n April. 
The circumstances surroun­ding the resignation led Maroszan to claim he was forced to forfeit his position. 
"They (Security) wanted me to conduct a prison-like operation. I couldn't do this to the students, they were my friends, not prisoners," commented 

.. Maroszan. Maroszan thinks other mem­bers of the security staff com­plain .:d about the number of students visiting him at the gate. He also feels the other guards watched his post to find him disobeying the rules. Maroszan supposedly did not have a good relationship with some members of Security be­cause they allegedly felt the students were "jock straps that couldn't open the doors of their dorms." "I didn't remain silent and let this untrue bigotry con­tinue. I supported the students. So, the students drink and get a little rowdy; they need some way to relieve the pressure. That does not make them secondclass citizens:" Despite his friendly attitude, the enforcement of the rules was not disregarded by Maroszan. 
"Everyone received the same kind of treatment," he stated "Of course I stepped on some toes, maybe that's why I'm not working there now." 
Maroszan gave up Social Security Disability and unem­ployment compensation when he accepted the job at the University. However, after his resignation he became ineligible to receive his previous benefits. 
The loss ofan income has cost "Boog" more than the expected monetary loss. His wife of 30 years filed for divorce over the lack of income. 
In an attempli to prove he was forced to resign Maroszan took his case to the Indiana Em­ployment Security Commission in ] uly. The commission con­

. eluded that he voluntarily left his employment without good cause. 
Due to the embarrassment he feels due to the incident, he no longer is a parishioner of Sacred Heart. He feels the clergy of the University could have suppor­ted, or at least consoled, him during his time of crisis. "Boog" asks, "Do they know what hell I was going through." 
When asked about the devel­opments, Security Director Glenn Terry stated, "The Commission confirmed what we have been saying all along." 
Terry also commented that, "I am displeased that The Observer is reporting this sWry. It happened

Maroszan feels it is an attempt to continue the policy of sweeping the incident under the rug. He still does not know what became of the student petition protesting his resignation. "It seems it fell on deaf ears," he observed. 
"Not one of the students has visited me since the incident I am begining to wonder if my position of friendship was worth' the price I've paid." 
Maroszan's residence is one block from the Notre Dame campus . 

·Pangborn falls victim to crime 
By Mary Fran Callahan Senior Staff Reporter 
More campus crime was dis­covered last night when-a theft of two watches and a class ring was reported to The Observer by Pangborn residents, who said the theft occurred during the Michigan football game. 
The students, who wished to have their names withheld from publication, said their room doors were unlocked. 
One of the watches taken was t'valuable," according to a res­ident. The other watch was en­graved, and the owner intimated that the article was of senti­mental value, as was the stolen class ring. 
A victim expressed a reluct­ance to accept the reality of campus crime when he said, "I never bothered to report it to Security because I knew nothing would ever turn up." 
Floor residents said they saw a "suspicious" man ·standing in their stairwell shortly after the Michigan game. 
"We asked him what he was doing, and he said he was "'trying to find the way out,"' a resident 

· stated. 
Thus far, ·Security has been unable to apprehend any sus­pects in the recent wave of campus crimes. The department, however, does have officers working on the thefts. 
Last week, Security officers questioned a group of South Bend residents emerging from Pangborn Hall. No suspects were taken into custody, how­ever. 
Earlier in the week, a recent robbery at Fisher Hall prompted Security Officer William Hedl to advise students to lock their doors "even if they just go take a shower."

"In fact, police were instructed not to make any special efforts to arrest bar patrons onSt. Patrick's Day," Hill said. "We didn't want a situation where 3 or 4 officers 
Corby's had ''broken its promise'' 
would try to make mass arrests. We didn't want to create a dangerous situation." 

Also appearing was Myron Busby of the Northeast Neigh­borhood Council, who testified that despite efforts to create a cooperative atmosphere, Corby's had "broken its promise" to try and keep the disruptive force of the bar to a minimum. Busby said that the management of Corby's had not fulfilled promises it made in an 1978 agreement with the Coun­cil to control some of the dis­ruptive effects the bar had on the neighborhood. "We're pretty much fed up with unkept prom­ises," Busby said, noting that the management of other area bars, Bridget McGuire's, Nickies and the now-closed Goose's Nest had fulfilled the terms of the agree­ment even after its expiration in Aprill979.

Student Senate and the CLC. 
Notre Dame had a Student 
Senate in the past, before the 
Student Life Council which pre­
ceeded the CLC. Conklin won­
dered why Riehle was reverting 
back to something that was so 
unsuccf!ssful in 1968 that it was 
voted out of existence by the 
students. He inquired as to how 
the new StudentSenate would be 
perceived by the administration. 
Conklin thought that the sem­
ester used getting the Senate in to 
operation might be more effec­
tively used working on the al­
ready formed CLC. 
Riehle responded that he 
would have no qualms convening 
the CLC next semester butwants 
to work on the Senate this sem­
ester. Though he will not con­
vene the CLC, his designate may 
call the group into session. 
Riehle has made Fr. Van 
Wolvlear his designate. Fr. Van 
Wolvlear plans on convening the 
CLC this semester. 
Riehle stressed that the Senate is a student senate and that ad­ministration and faculty are not ·included in the membership so 
that the students alone may have a voice. In the past, many res­olutions· never passed the CLC because of the administration membership. 
The Senate would be only an advisory group, but passage of a resolution would be by students, and the resolution would be presented to the administration. Thus, if the resolutions were not adopted, it would be clear that the administration was unwilling to accept them-not that the students were unable to organize and present them. 
Riehle said the formation of the Senate would more clearly define the roles of student gov­ernment. 
Riehle expressed concern that the CLC and the Student Senate operating concurrently would confuse the students over who had the say in student govern­ment. The CLC works on hall life; the Senate would work on campus life. Riehle said that the Senate would include elected members rather than the CLC's appointed members. 
Flanner Hall President Mike Shepardson pointed out that student senates at other schools

Carter eases standards 


WASHINGTON (AP)-Presi­dent Carter, preparing to take his battle for re-election to the nation's industrial heartland, an­nounced Tuesday. he will seek extended environmental dead­lines to help ailing steel manu­facturers compete with overseas 
manufacturers 
Saying "a healthy and modern­
ized steel industry is vital to our 
nation's economy and also to our 
nation's security," Carter also 
unveiled a liberalized tax de­
preciation schedule for steel­
makers. 
The measures could result in 
domestic steel prices rising by as 
much as 25 percent, industry 
officials said. 
The president announced the measures at the Executive Office Building next to the White House just before he begins campaign visits to several key steel-producing states. The nation's five leading steel states -three ofwhich Carter will visit Wednesday and Thursday have 112 electoral votes out ofthe 270 needed to win. 
Carter will make campaign visits to Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania on Wednesday and Thursday. The other two leading steel states are Illinois and Indiana..

warned Carter that he could fare 
poorly in industrial states if there 
is no program to restore some of 
the lost jobs. 
In an apparent reference to those who advocate a reduced government role in business, Carter said: "the comprehensive steel agreement that we've reached is proof that the proper role of government is to be a partner in economic change, not an impediment and also not an unwitting or indifferent specta­tor." 
"In today's real world, a quick fix for one particular problem easily means quick trouble...for others," the president said. 
The industry has been hurt in recent years by rapidly rising wages, reduced product demand, a lag in capital investment and import competition from Japan and Europe. 
Administration officials, from the president on down, were quick to deny that the new environmental plans amounted to a relaxation of air and water pollution standards. Instead, they used the phrase "stretch­out" -more commonly called upon to describe an industrial

(continued from page 1) 
In the weeks prior to the fight, Plimpton was continuously an­noyed by calls from Ali pre­dicting the tragedy that was to befall his opponent. "You is gonna fall during ring instruc-. tions," Ali would whisper. 
Plimpton recounted other unusual adventures. Several years ago as a Boston Celtic, Plimpton was put into the final minutes of a game with the Atlanta Hawks, down by fifteen points and with little hope of winning. 
Seeing the odd man come onto the court, Plimpton's teammates were revitalized momentarily and fought back to within two points of the opponents. At that point Plimpton was replaced by John Havilcek, the All-Star power forward. This turned out to be a mistake, however, as the Celtics went on to lose the game. 
Plimpton's career has ven­tured off the playing field as well. As a percussionist for the New York Philharmonic, Plimpton ruined an entire performance one night, sending Leonard Bernstein into a rage. 
Known as "The Flying Telephone Pole," Plimpton was once a circus trapeze artist. Although his performances in the center ring were less than perfect, Plimpton did not go totally unnoticed. Minutes be­fore one show was to begin, wearing only his pink leotards, Plimpton went to see a doctor about a shoulder ache. Upon hearing that his strangely-dres­sed patient was a "flyer," the doctor replied, "the human body is a cathedral and you've de-~ secrated it." Plimpton was re­fused treatment. 

Perhaps Plimpton's unusual career was summed up best by the young lady who introduced him last night. To the delight of the crowd, she announced that Plimpton, "Has done almost anything I can think of." 
  . Warnings

patients. "Our biggest worry right now is getting people to read the label," Nida said. "If we could get one thing across to consumers ­read the label-we'd figure our work was done. All we'd have to do is watch the manufacturers." Nida is optimistic, however. "Consumers are picking up on the language of the medical field," he said. '"Side effects' is not a term that's an exclusive property of doctors anymore." 
In recent months, the FDA has 
announced that warning labels will be required on bubble bath. "Excessive use or prolonged exposure may cause irritation to skin and urinary tract." 
It has ordered warnings on products ranging from sunlamps to hair dyes. It warned pregnant women to curtail or stop drink­ing coffee, tea and colas because of a possible link between caf­feine and birth defects. The agency found no scientific ev­idence to back up claims that Bendectin, a drug used to treat morning sickness, causes birth defects. But it recommended, nonetheless, that manufacturers include "patient package in­serts" to give customers more information. Look around the house. The skull and crossbones that used to be confined to containers of rat poison and weed killer has been replaced by fine printand has spread through the rooms. The print seems to get smaller as the warnings get longer. "For external use only. Keep away from children."

Throwing away your vote 
I have a recurring nightmare: It's November 4, and I calmly stroll into the voting booth, confidently toting my first presidential ballot. I pick up the "tool" and scan the ballot."Carter, Reagan, Anderson." I knit my brow. "Reagan, Cartllr, Anderson." I begin to sweat. "Anderson, Carter, Reagan.'' I awake violently, screaming," Where is none of the above'!"

Dick Russell, an infamous in view ofthe situations that await us segregationist from Georgia. He was in the '80s.

thing to sit around Charley's Barbershop and talk about "what should be done to straighten us out" and quite another to say the same things as the presidential candidate of a major political party.

I'll tell you what-I hope it isn't this bad every four years, because if it is I think I'll just bag it now.I mean this will be my first time inside the voting booth and there's nobody with a bandwagon that I want to jump on, nobody that I can spend my college years fanatically supporting as an idealistic undergrad. Eugene McCarthy, George McGovern, Morris Udall, heck, even Edward Kennedy, where are you? When I was a "kid I used to put my Humphrey and McGovern bumper stickers on my bicycle and school folders and be the most politically hip 10-year-old in town, But now I can finally vote, and there's nobody to vote for. 
Seriously, who can any self­respecting 20-year-old liberal vote for this year'? (I know, I know, John Anderson, but I'll get to him later). 
This is a year for the "Don't vote, it only encourages them" t-shirts in tion system (they make it necessary for a serious candidate to be unemployed or else ignore his job) to the loss of esteem that politics and politicians have suffered in the last 20 years. (Why be in politics when it is nothing but a miasma of worries and not as economically rewarding as private business?) Through combinations of these and other reasons, we are left with the basic choice of Carter or Reagan, which is really no choice at all. 
First of all, there is no real ideological difference between Carter and Reagan. Carter is a bit more intelligent, as such is slicker and more sophisticated, but he is really a moderate Republican in Democrat's clothing. The only real difference appears to be on certain social issues such as abortion and ERA, and Carter could not oppose these without losing a large segment of his constituency. Historically, Carter is

opponent by circulating a picture of him hugging a black man. Carter's economic policies are much more traditionally Republican than Democratic, and he is also a proponent of the traditional Repub­lican concerns such as deregulation and military strength. 
Reagan, on the other hand, appears daily to be nothing more than a good-intentioned, though definitely not harmless, old man who would be better off back in Dixon, Illinois, telling stories to his grand­children. I do not mean this in any sort of discriminatory way (pertain­ing to age), but in the sense that Reagan's background, qualifications, and experience in no way prepare him to be President of the United States. It is a very strong comment upon the situation of the electoral system of the country, and the electorate itself, that he has been allowed to come this far. It's one future of the world we're talking about. In a way, if Reagan is elected (or for that matter, Carter), it will serve a sort of twisted justice, because America will get the kind of leadership it deserves. 

As far as personalities go, I actually prefer Reagan's because I think that he is at least sincere. I disagree with most of what he says and openly fear the potential impli­cations of his presidency, but he is a much nicer person than Carter, who, while presenting his pious exterior, has been one of the most ruthless, cynical and politically-motivated chief executives ever. His manipula­tion of the White House, Iran, Afghanistan, Russia, China, energy, and countless other issues has been disgusting. This has been much more disturbing than his alleged incom­petence. For example, consider the Stealth bomber leak, and his use of the Iranian issue "to hide in the Rose

Garden." Not to mention his criticisms and distortions of Reagan, which often amount to the "pot calling the kettle black." 
So what are we left with? Good old John B. Anderson, the white­haired panacea. (Ed Clark, Barry Commoner, and the others truly represent throwing your vote away.) The only problem is that Anderson revealed himself as more of a self-

righteous sycophant thar the con­cerned intellectual the media have portrayed him as. He also has no real credibility (he didn't win a primary) outside of the media, and lacks the strong organization to seriously challenge and win. The only thing that Anderson can do is what I hope happens, and that is throw the election into the House. While I do feel he doesn't have a chance, if everyone who is saying, ''I'd vote for him, but he doesn't have a chance and I don't want to throw my vote away" would vote for him, he could probably send it to the House. This would be better than either Carter or Reagan. 
All ofthis brings several questions to mind, the most prominent being "Isn't there a better way?" There is a leadership crisis in this country, and we need strong leaders to govern, but first we need viable choices to create dialogue in which to decode these issues. Our current situation is another bitter fruit of television, in that Iowa and New Hampshire get to have a 90 percent share in deter­mining who becomes president. By being strong there, the Reagans and Carters get their head starts and become media "front-runners". Perhaps it is time for a parliamentary system. But that is another article. In the end, all I can say is "Where have 
you gone, Pat Paulsen and Harold Stassen, a nation turns its lonely hearts to you."

the time to make it to nearly every Notre Dame game since his son arrived in 1978, remains a steadying influence on Dean. 
"Once I didn't think he was going to make it to the Navy game in Cleveland," says the 20­year-old Masztak. "But I heard a yell from the stands, there were 80,000 people there. It was my father. I heard him above all those other people. I looked around and there he was. 
"He's always been there; I always hear him, don't ask me how." 
Masztak, who was named to prep All-American squads by Coach andCoach & Athlete, says the change from high school play to collegiate competition was a major one for him. 
"Itwas a big transition. When I got here everyone was so much bigger, so much faster and hit so much harder. You had to hang your head low so it didn't get taken off." 
A two-time prep letter winner in both basketball and track, teams he caP.tained his senior year, Masztak has helped to compile a long and impressive list of memorabilia to that treasured Notre Dame tradition: the near comeback-win versus Southern California in his fresh­man year (four grabs for 82 yards); the brilliant win over Houston that same year at the Cotton Bowl (three catches for 49 yards); 
·and the 18-17 steal from South Carolina last year, a game in which he hauled in the game­winning 14-yard pass with less than a minute to play (just one of his six aerial receipts on the day for a team-leading 1979 mark). T.hey are just a few contests that stand out most~ Masztak's mind. 
But, of course, he does not omit the recent wonder-win over Michigan from his memories. 
"I was just concentrating on getting the guys blocked so Harry could kick it," says the member of last year's Butcher Brothers in Bookstore Basketball with fellow grid standouts Kevin Hart and John Scully. "I was thinking, 'Come on, Harry,' but I never lost faith. 
"When it went up I thought, 'It's there.' I was on my knees watching and I was just kind of bringing my hands up slowly as it was going, and then finally, 1 brought them all the way up when it was good. 
"You could see how close we 
(the team) were then-every­
one on the sidelines was giving 
support. It was good, and every­
one was a part ofthat win. Even if 
it wasn't good, everyone would 
have been a part of it." 
Masztak stresses that the aura 
of closeness is still there, despite 
a week's layoff from play, and 
that it has to be with the team

Though Dean Masztak admits the season gets long, it gets tough to prepare for games and he gets tired, he's also quick to assure everyone of one special thing. 
"I love it here, I wouldn't be 
happy any other place." 
It's doubtful the Irish team and 
fans could be as happy if the 
talented Masztak were any other 
place but under that Dome that 
mesmerized him nearly three 
years ago.

Masztak: traditionalist at heart 
by Beth Huffman Sports Editor 
It was a cold, snowy day in January of 1978 when Dea.n Masztak first came to Notre Dame. He had looked at Mich­igan, a school less than an hour from his Toledo, Ohio, home, and had been impressed. He was determined, though, to keep an open mind about the all­important decision of which college to choose. Yet, the quiet junior who led all Irish receivers in playing time last year says it didn't take him long on that occassion to realize he belonged in an Irish, not a Wolverine, uniform. 
"I put my foot down from the car, looked up at the Dome and said, 'This is it,"' reflects the 6-4, 227-pound tight end who has caught five passes fora total of74. yards in Notre Dame's two games this season. 
With the Irish tradition im­bedded in his mind by a subway alum father, numerous miracles performed by men in blue-and then green-on his television set, the Central Catholic High School graduate was determined to preserve at least one relic of Notre Dame history. 
Visions of Mike Creaney and then Ken MacAfee clad in the blue and gold shadowed Masztak's mind when he prepared for his first season as an Irish player. The "Green Wave" image produced by the Southern California vic­tory didn't set well with the freshman destined to back up Dennis Grindinger in the 1978 "Kids dream to be a part of Masztak surrenders to, no matter campaign. As Grindinger's fill-in this," says the junior finance what he wears on the field, he he played in all 11 Irish games major. "I got here; I am a part of does his job as Notre Dame's and hauled in 13 aerials for 236 it. I figured as long as I have the starting tight end, and he does it yards. opportunity I should do some­well. 
Masztak devised his own way thing. "He has real good hands," says to preserve his memory of "the "My father said if I should get Ron Toman, Notre Dame's way it used to be." Given his hassled I should tell them it was quarterback and receiving coach. choice, he'd wear the traditional so my grandmother could see me "He has good speed for a tight blue and gold instead of green. on the field.

OUT OF THE BLOCKS-Notre Dame's 2-0 record this season in football marks its best start since Dan Devine's first squad went 3-0 in 1975. That year the Irish defeated Boston College (17-3), Purdue (17-0) and Northwestern (31-7) before losing to Michigan State (10-3). 
Notre Dame has scored more points in its first two games this season than in any other year under Devine. Their 60-point total is most closely matched by the 34-point sum in '75 and'79. 
OPEN UP L.._ A glance at the records might convince Notre Dame's schedule makers to pencil a few more open dates into the Irish slate.Since Knute Rockne became coach in 1918, Notre Dame has posted a 17-6-2 record in games played following open dates. Nine of those games h~tve been season­ending clashes with Southern Cal, in which Notre Dame is 2-5­
2: Since Devine has been under the Golden Dome,the Irish are 4-1 after open weekends, losing only to Michigan (28-14)in 1978. 
DEVINE INTERVEN:riON-Following Notre Dame's aweinspiring victory over Michigan State, the Michigan student newspaper indulged in some posthumousevangelizing. The headlines in their Monday edition read "Michigan27, Notre Dame 26., God 3." 
IT CAN'T HURT-Creighton Miller, star halfback for Notre Dame in the mid-40's and now a lawyer in Cleveland, recalls that there may be more truth than mythwhen it comes to divine intervention for thelrish. Miller remembers his coach, Frank Leahy, taking the entiresquad to the cemetary before big games to say a rosary at Rockne'sgrave. 
"I'm not sure if it helped," remarks Miller, "but it didn't hurt." 
TWO-MINUTE WARNING-There have been only eight occasions in the history ofNotre Dame football when the Irish have been deprived of victory in the last two minutes of a football game, the most recent being Southern Cal's field goal with two seconds left to nip the Irish 27-25 in 1978. 
On the other side ofthe winner's circle, the Irish have scored the winning or tying points after the two-minute warningin 14 games. Southern Cal and Iowa have been the victims three times apiece. 
KNIGHT-LESS KNICKS-The NBA's New York Knicks announced last week thatToby Knight, who played for the Irish from 1,974-78, will be sidelined for the entire NBA season because of ligament damage tohis left knee. Knight, who averaged 19 points last year and has beena starting forward for the Knicks for the past three seasons, was injured during an exhibition game last Tuesday.He'll be in a leg cast for three months and will spend the next three to six months undergoing rehabilitation. 
CROSS COUNTRY FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY­Notre Dame's Irish Invitational, the largest collegiate cross country meet in the nation, will boast five of the top-twenty harrying(is that a word?) squads in the country. According to the mo'st recent issue ofThe Harrier, the bible ofAmerican cross country, Auburn is rated third nationally,Michigan seventh, Indiana eighth, Florida 19th and Illinois State 20th. All five of those teams, plus the host Irish and some 50 other schools, will take to the Burke Memorial GolfCourse course (huh?) starting at 2 p.m. Saturday. 
SPEAKING OF INVITATIONALS-The Notre Dame men's tennis teamwill see its only action of the fall when the' Irish host the eight-team Notre DameInvitational. Surprisingly enough,the same teams will be back this year that competed lastfall. Four-time defending champion Miami (Ohio) will be among the pre-tourney favorites, along with the host Irish who finished their spring campaign with a bri!liant 20-3 record and the Eastern Collegiate Tennis Championship. Play begins Friday morning at 9 a.m. and runs through late-Saturday afternoon. 
JV JUNKED-Notre Dame's final j~nior varsity football game ofthe season has been cancelled. Originally scheduled for Sunday afternoon in East Lansing against Michigan State,the game was scrubbed because the Irish did not have enough personnelto field a team. All NCAA football players are limited to playing in 11 games (eitherJV or varsity) during the regular season, and JV Coach Gene Smith expliained that some of thoseJV players might have to be called on later in the season for the varsity.
