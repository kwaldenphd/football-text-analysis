Debaters weigh in on candidate petfonnance 
Students gather in Coleman-Morse to watch nominees square off on domestic issues for third and final debate 
By KRISTIN DOLO News Wrirer 
After Sen. John McCain and Sen. Bantck Obama faced off in their third and final debate. the Notre Dame Debate Team had its own debate -about the Hepublican and Democratic candidates' performances. 
Students assembled in the Coleman-Morse lounge Wednesday night to watch debat11 and listen to analysis by the Notre Dame Debate Team. 
Members of the debate team had a mixed reaction to the candidates' performances, though they all agreed that the debate had not altered the course of the campaign. 
"Because he is behind, McCain had to come in tonight with a knockout punch. and he didn't," Debate Team president Henry Chan said. 
Dr. Susan Ohmer, a Film, Television and Theatre profes­sor, moderated the debate team. 
"McCain did a better job than he has in the past two debates," she said. "However, Obama appeared cool and level-headed compared to some of McCain's snarky tactics." 
Tom Foote, a member of the debate team, referenced Joe the Plumber, a man, perhaps real, perhaps symbolic, whose name was repeatedly mentioned by both candidates. 
"I don't know if Joe the Plumber exists, but if he does, Obama did a good job articulat­ing how his policies will affect him," Foote said. 
Junior Elyse Hoffman explained why McCain would try to show Americans how elo­quent Obama is as a speaker in order to make them rethink his words. 
"A big part of this is speaking pretty; however, the majority of Americans don't realize that," she said.

By SARAH MAYER 
News Writer 

For many students, this is the lirst elec­tion they are voting in, and the only elec­tion that will be held during their four years of college. For the Saint Mary's College Democrat<;, this is primetime. 
College Democrats president Blaine Nolan said the club is frred up about the election, especially after the recent vice presidential debate. 
"The girls are so excited about the debates. Even girls who aren't so active in the club are talking about the debates and loving every minute of them," she said. 
"The Bielen/Palin debate has brought a lot of good information to the table because of the way it played out." 
Nolan said there has been a noticeable increase in membership this year as well. 
"Our membership has almost doubled this year as compared to the past," she said. 'The interest level is very high. I get daily e-mails about girls wanting to get involved in many different aspects Lof the club]." 
The club has been active in the "Super Tuesday" events on campus and is trying to get the word out that voting, no matter which candidate one votes for, is impor­

NewsWrirer 

Saint Mary's College Republicans are getting excited for the historic vote on Nov. 4, said Erin Horvath, the president of the Saint Mary's College Republicans, with involvement in the club up significantly since last year. 
"This year, the group has nearly 70 members and 30 attend meetings regularly. Last year, honestly, we had between 2-5 girls at meetings ... it was pretty sad," she said. 
The increase in the number of girls who attend meetings makes for good discussion, Horvath said. 
Club member Kara Rusnak said she is happy with the way meetings have been going so far. 
"I enjoy the meetings because a lot of different perspectives are expressed," Husnak said. 
Due to this year's presidential cam­paign, interest and participation have increased, allowing the group to plan more events involving cam­pus Republicans, Horvath said. 
"[The club] organized events to watch the Republican National Convention as well as the debates,"

News Wrirers 
For the second week in a row, Saint Mary's Board of Governance (BOG) failed to approve the Student Government Association (SGA) · budget with the necessary two­thirds majority at their weekly meeting Wednesday night. 
The budget, which failed to pass in a 14-11 vote, had been revised after last week's meet­ing. The original budget includ­ed a $20,000 stipend for the Executive Board consisting of student body president Mickey Gruscinski, student body vice president Sarah Falvey, execu­tive treasurer Mo Weaver, Student Activities Board coordi­nator Michele Peterson, Student Diversity Board president Adriana Rodriguez, Hesidence Hall Association president Maura Clougherty and execu­tive secretary Jenny Hoffman, who has previously written for The Observer.

Suit against God thrown out over lack of address 
LINCOLN, Neb.-A judge has thrown out a Nebraska legislator's lawsuit against God, saying the Almighty wasn't properly served due to his unlisted home address. State Sen. Ernie Chambers filed the lawsuit last year seeking a pnnna­nent injunction against God. 
He said God has made terroristic threats against the senator and his eon­stituents in Omaha, inspired fear and caused "wide­spread death, destruetion and terrorization of millions upon millions of the Earth's inhabitants." 
Chambers has said he filed the lawsuit to make the point that everyone should have aeeess to the courts regardless of whether they are rieh or poor. 
On Tuesday, however, Douglas County District Court Judge Marlon Polk ruled that under state law a plaintiff must have aeeess to the defendant for a law­suit to move forward. 
Dozens get gas for 35 cents after a mistake 
WISCONSIN RAPIDS, Wis. -Sure, gas prices have come down lately. But to 
34.9 cents a gallon? That's what Kelly Joosten and dozens of other motorists paid at a Citgo station Monday. The sign adver­tised $3.43 for a gallon of premium fuel, but the pump eost read $0.349 a gallon . 
"That was amazing," said Joosten, who normally spends about $100 to fill up her 1998 Ford Expedition. 
Joosten proudly showed off her receipt for 25.36 gallons at $8.85. She said she saw other motorists fill­ing gas eans, too, at the dis­counted price.

Unigo.com serves as electronic guidefor prospective students, gives tips on application process 
By ELLYN MICHALAK News Writer 
New electronic college guide­book Unigo.com offers more than just statistics on a partic­ular university -it offers stu­dents uncensored opinions through an interactive and multi-dimensional Web site. 
Unigo.com is a free online guide to 267 of North America's top colleges for prospective students. Current students create the reviews so that prospective students are able to get an unbiased opinion of campus life. 
The Web site includes origi­nal articles from students and recent grads on every aspect of a particular college, an "Intelligent Calendar" to guide students through the search and application process and "Unigo Match" to help students find the colleges that are right for them 
aging editor was in charge of finding student liaisons on about 10 college campuses. One managing editor, Dan Mesure, sent an e-mail to Notre Dame's English depart­ment last spring looking for interns. Junior Lindsay Sena applied and now serves as the Unigo intern for Notre Dame. 
"The main reason that I decided to work for Unigo is that I love Notre Dame," Sena said. "For better or worse, I think high school students deserve to learn what Notre Dame is really about and why we are so incredible, but they should also learn that we aren't perfect." 
Since February 2007, Sena has collected student reviews from Notre Dame students and taken photos for Web site. Unigo even provided 100 of its interns with flip video cameras to include video footage of campuses nationwide on the site. One

tos, no videos, no interactivity and little insight from the real experts -the students who attend the schools," said Jordan Goldman, founder and CEO of the New York-based start-up in a 2008 press release. 
Goldman graduated from Wesleyan in 2004 with the idea to start an online student-pro­duced college guidebook. After he e-mailed over 500 people in the Wesleyan database with jobs in finance, Goldman final­ly received a reply from Frank Sica. a former president of Soros Private Funds Management. The two met, and Sica now serves as Unigo.com's leading investor. 
Goldman's company has grown exponentially over the past year -he has a Park Avenue office and 25 employ­ees to work under him. During the past year, 18 full-time edi­tors, 300 on-campus interns and more than 15,000 students collaborated to create Unigo.com. Last year, Unigo began to collect information through student interns on each campus. Each Unigo man-

Within the last year, the Web site has received over 30,000 bits of content from its student interns, including reviews, writing samples, photos and videos. 
"I think our goal is to get the content and make the content," Unigo editor Nikki Martinez said. "We are not going to be ranking a school according to other company's views. [Unigo] is centered on the experience and what students have to say. We don't censor or edit student surveys." 
Martinez also encouraged students to get their personal opinions onto the website. 
"We love all kinds of perspec­tives and we're aiming to pro­vide a very comprehensive look at Notre Dame," Martinez said. "So if you think your perspec­tive is not being heard, this is definitely the platform to do it on."

STUDENT SENATE 
Group passes donations resolution 
By JOSEPH McMAHON Assisstant News Editor 
Wrapping up some unfinished business, Student Senate passed two resolutions and a constitu­tional amendment in its final meeting before fall break Wednesday. 
The Senate first passed a reso­lution proposed by Senate Social Concerns Committee chair Michelle Byrne that called for allowing students to make chari­table donations to clubs using Domer Dollars. The resolution passed by a vote of 26 to 1. 
To facilitate this, student gov­ernment will be forced to pur­chase an ID card swiper, which can cost up $3,500. But Byrne said she was exploring purchas­ing an old swiper from Food Services or the Career Center. 
"We're looking into using some money from the technology fund," Byrne said. 
Senate also passed a resolu­tion commending the Office of Information Technology (Om for its work on the transition to Google Mail from the old WebMail system. 
"We're thanking orr for going through the WebMail transition helping students get some new applications to communicate," Senate Technology Committee chair Devin Fee said. 
The resolution passed by a vote of 26 to 1, with Cavanaugh senator Robin Link casting the one dissenting vote. 
"These kinds of resolutions are just a waste of time," Link said. 
But student body vice presi­dent Grant Schmidt said the res­olution was a nice way of thank­ing OIT for their work. 
"This is a formal way of appre­ciating the work they did," Schmidt said. 
Senate Academics Committee chair Ryan Brellenthin agreed, saying the resolution will help strengthen the working relation­ship between student govern­ment and orr. 
"By doing this it encourages [OIT] to keep working with us," Brellenthin said. 
Continuing his crusade to clean up and organize the stu­dent government constitution, Senate Oversight Committee chair Ian Secviar proposed grouping the awards given by student government -the Irish Oover Award and the Michael J. Palumbo Award -under the same article. The amendment to the constitution passed unani­mously. 
In other Senate news: +Schmidt handed out copies of University President Fr. John 
Jenkins' recent address to the faculty and asked the sena­tors to read the address with­in the next three weeks to be prepared to discuss it in Senate. 
+Knott senator Greg Salter said he was giving a resolu­tion to the Oversight Committee for reviiew which would examine the constitu­tional stipulation that states "no person may simultane­ously hold more than one office enumerated in this Constitution." 
Salter's proposal would allow this clause to be sus­pended in specific eases by a two-thirds vote of the Senate. 
Salter said Knott Hall presi­dent Matt Barloh, who led the dorm to Hall of the Year hon­ors last year, was being forced to resign his presidency to become president of The Shirt Project. Salter said Barloh's resignation would be a major loss for the dorm. 
"None of us want to see him have to stand down because he's doing such great things for the dorm," Salter said. "We think it should be in our hands to decide whether or not he's still capable."

Break draws students off can1:pus 
By AMANDA GRAY News Writer 
This fall break, Notre Dame students are scattering across the map -returning home, vis­iting friends or going on service projects. 
One student returning home is junior Kevin Partington. 
''I'll enjoy seeing my family, especially my three cats," he said. 
Freshman Chris Stare is also going home. 
''I'm looking to partying with my friends in Milwaukee and seeing my dog," he said. 
Some students, instead of vis­iting family, are spending their break with friends at other schools. 
''I'm going back to Kentucky to stay with friends at the University of Kentucky," fresh­man Ross Finney said. "I might see my family over the week­end. That'd be nice." 
Several students will be going on seminars sponsored by the Center for Social Concerns (CSQ, many of which send stu­dents to the Appalachian region. 
SEN lOR CAPTAIN ERIK CONDRA 
Junior Michelle Perone will be leaving for Appalachia on Saturday morning. She's excited to be going with some of her friends. 
"I've done a couple other trips with the esc and they've been really amazing experiences," said Perone. 
Sophomore Simone Bigi is attending as well. 
"I saw the poster in my resi­dence hall and it seemed like it would be fun," he said. 
Freshman Greg Woods is also going to Appalachia. 
"My group members and I are going to be teaching and tutor­ing at Sacred Heart grade school," Woods said. "I am going to enjoy spending time with the students and seeing their enormous smiles." 
Besides going on the trip, the attendees are required to attend several classes given by the esc. 
"I like that the classes we've been attending in the weeks leading up to the trip have been making sure we understand the causes behind the area's pover­ty," Perone said. "This level of understanding adds a whole other dimension to actually doing service." 
Sophomore Beth !\agel is also attending the Appalachia semi­nar. 
"I am excited about meeting more Notre Dame students and becoming closer to those in my group," said sophomore Beth Nagel, who is also going to Appalachia. 
Another seminar sponsored by the esc over fall break is "Human Rights, Faithful Citizenship and Public Policy." Senior Christine Clark will be attending this seminar, which will be held in Washington, D.C. 
"It's not a service project, per se, but a chance to learn about the intersection of hmnan rights and public policy," Oark said. 
Clark said she is going to enjoy exploring Washington and meeting new people on her trip. 
Sophomore Katrina Corcoran will be attending the Cultural Diversity Seminar in Chicago, also sponsored by the esc. 
''I'm going to enjoy seeing Chicago from other people's point of view," Corcoran said. "I love to be immersed into some­thing."

The College Hepublicans have also taken an active interest, running phone banks that are helping to elect Luke Puckett to Congress as a representative for Indiana's 2nd District and re-elect incumbent Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, Horvath said. 
The College Republicans can be seen around Saint Mary's campus sporting the club's red "VOTE" T-shirts 
with the GOP Elephant on the front. Members of the club are encouraged to wear their T-shirts each Tuesday leading up to the election, Ilorvath said. 
"I like the !shirts] because [theyI promote voting in gen­eral; whethnr you are a Hepubliean or Democrat doesn't matter," Husnak said. "People are just trying to get involved and do their part and that's important." 
Caitlin Sullivan, the vice president of the Saint Mary's College Hepublicans, said she is excited about engaging fel­low students, and ·said the club is organizing a fundrais­er to send care packages to troops. 
After the election on Nov. 4, Saint Mary's College Republicans' efforts in creat­ing party awareness will con­tinue, Horvath said. Members can look forward to a trip to Washington D.C. to attend the Conservative Poli(ical Action Committee (CPAC) in February, Ilorvath said.

Debate 
conti~ued from page 1 
Hofstra University in llempstead, N.Y.. was moder­ated by CBS's Bob Schinfl'er. The lablll discussion format allownd thn candidates to engagn nach other directly on a mixed bag of issues including the economy, attacks ads, thnir running mates, energy. abortion and ndueation. 
Both candidates strove to present the image of a strong lnader when Schieffer asked them why their eeonomic plan was superior to their opponnnts. Obama was left defending his tax policies to McCain who told viewnrs, "I know how to save billions." 
Obama criticized McCain for rBpnatedly siding with l'rnsident Bush. 
McCain respondnd: "Sen. Obama, I am not Prnsident Bush. If you wanted to run against l'rnsident Bush. you should have run four years ago. I'm going to givn a new 
direction to this economy in this country." 
Schieffer gave the candi­dates an opportunity to reflect on the presence of attack ads in the campaign. Obarna accused McCain for running "100 percent nega­tive ads" and dismissed the McCain campaign for claim­ing lw "pals around with ter­rorists." McCain used the opportunity to point out that Obama agreed to town hall meetings months ago and later opted out. 
The candidates were asked why their pick of a running mate was better than their opponents. Obama passed on critieizing Palin and said, "heaven forbid something happnn to me, Biden would make a great president." MeCain, who listed Palin's accomplishments extensively, failed to address the possibil­ity of her becoming president and nnded with "her hus­band Todd is a pretty tough guy."

U.S. soldiers kill no. 2 al-Qaida leader 
BAGHDAD-American soldiers killed the alleged No. 2 leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, a Moroccan who trained in Afghanistan, recruited foreign fighters and ran operations in northern Iraq where Sunni insurgents remain a potent threat, the U.S. military said Wednesday. . 
The man, who the military said was known as Abu Qaswarah, died Oct. 5 during a raid on a building in the northern city of Mosul that served as a major "command and con­trol location" for the region. Four other insurgents were killed in the operation, the 
U.S. said. 
The announcement of Abu Qaswarah's death was withheld until Wednesday to allow for positive identification, the military said. 
Fighting erupts at Cambodian border 
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -Escalating ten­sions botween Thailand and Cambodia over a disputed border near a historic temple erupted Wednesday in a deadly gunbattle, prompting oft1cials to quickly declare that they would resolve the dispute through talks, not bullets. 
Two Cambodian troops were killed, the first deaths in a 4-month standoff that began when UNESCO, the U.N. cultural agency, approved Cambodia's bid to have Preah Vihear temple named a World Heritage Site. Thailand feared its elaims· over nearby· land would be under­mined. 
In recent days, as the dispute fueled national­ism in both countries, officials appeared to be preparing for a major confrontation. 
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen issued an ultimatum to Thailand on Tuesday to pull back its soldiers from the disputed territory, calling it "a life-and-death battle zone." Thailand moved reinforcements up to the border area.

Nancy Reagan suffers broken pelvis 
LOS ANGELES-Nancy Reagan suffered a broken pelvis in a fall at her home and will be hospitalized for several days, her spokes­woman said Wednesday. 
The 87 -year-old former first lady fell last week, spokeswoman Joanne Drake said. She did not seek immediate medical care but decided Monday to get checked out because of persistent pain, Drake said. 
Doctors at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center determined she had a fractured pelvis and sacrum, the triangular bone at tpe base of the spinal column. 
"She's in some pain but in very good spir­its." Drake said. 
Residents return as fire fears diminish 
LOS ANGELES -Residents of the San Fernando Valley breathed air free of smoke and ash for the first time in four days Wednesday under brilliant blue skies. 
Gone were the convulsive winds that at times reached gale force. Nowhere could Los Angeles police be found using bullhorns to order residents out of homes and away from deadly fires that have blackened more than 34 square miles and destroyed more than 50 homes. 
The last evacuation orders for two big fire areas at opposite ends of the valley were lift­ed, though some locations were open just to residents. Some of those who returned found only rubble.

McCain, Obama debate domestic policies, attack opposition campaign ads 
Associated Press 
HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. -John McCain repeatedly assailed Barack Obama's character and campaign positions on taxes, abortion and more Wednesday night, hoping to transform their final presi-.. dential debate into a launch­ing pad for a political come­back. "You didn't tell the American people the truth," he charged. 
Unruffled, and ahead in the polls, Obama parried each accusation, and leveled a few of his own. 
"One hundred percent, John, of your ads, 100 per­cent of them have been neg­ative," Obama shot back in an uncommonly personal debate less than three weeks from Election Day. 
"It's not true," McCain retorted. 
"It absolutely is true," said Obama, seeking the last word. 
McCain is currently run­ning all negative ads, according to a study by the University of Wisconsin­Madison. But he has run a number of positive ads dur­ing the campaign. 
The 90-minute encounter, seated at a round table at Hofstra University, was their third debate, and marked the beginning of a 20-day sprint to Election Day.

IRAQ 
Pact calls for limited U.S. jurisdiction 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD -American troops could face trial before Iraqi courts for major crimes committed off base and when not on missions. under a draft security pact hammered out in months of tortu­ous negotiations, Iraqi officials familiar with the accord said Wednesday. 
The draft also calls for U.S. troops to leave Iraqi cities by the end of June and withdraw from the country entire­ly by Dec. 31, 2011, unless the Baghdad government asks some of them to stay for training or security support, the officials said. 
It would also give the Iraqis a 
tWeater role in U.S. military operations and full control of the Green Zone, the 3?-square mile area of central Baghdad· that includes the U.S. Embassy and major Iraqi government offices. 
One senior Iraqi official said Baghdad may demand even more con­cessions before the draft is submitted to parliament for a final decision. The two sides are working against a dead­line of year's end when the U.N. man­date authorizing the U.S.-led mission expires. 
The Iraqi officials, familiar with details of the draft, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not supposed to release the information. 
In Washington, the State Department confirmed a draft had been finalized but refused to discuss any details. 
"There is a text that people are look­ing at," spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters. "Nothing is done until everything is done. Everything isn't done. The Iraqis are still talking among themselves. We are still talking to the Iraqis." 
U.S. officials declined to discuss details of the draft but characterized it as the administration's final offer, say­ing no more concessions would be considered. 
Colleges face priest shortage 
Declining nun1ber of clergy pose problems for Catholic institutions 
Associated Press 
I'IIILADELI'IIIA -Thn short­
ago of Homan Catholic dnrgy 
isn't just being felt in ehureh. 
Hnfigious ordPrs that have four~dnd and run Catholie eol­lnges and universities aeross tlw U.S. -in some casns for more than a century-are grappling with how to retain thn institutions' distinet reli­gious idnntitins in the faee of declining numbers of priests and nuns. 
The Hnv. Timothy Lannon, presidnnt of Saint Joseph's University. ean envision a time when a lay person will lead the Jesuit school in Philadelphia because of the dwindling num­ber of his brethren. So it's important now to instill the order's philosophy on eampus through eurrieulum and staff initiativns, hn said. 
"Without .Jnsuits, how ean you 1:all yoursnlf .Jesuit?" Lannon said. 
Saint .JosPph's is not ;donn, said Hirhard Yanikoski, presi­dnnt of thn Association of Catholic Colleges and Univnrsitins. 
As rnligious orders shrink, the 1:riti1:al ,·.hallnngn is for Catholie idnntity "to lw built into thn goals and opnrations and prac­tices of the institution," Yanikoski said. 
Hntaining that idnntity was sonwwhat nasinr in provious gmwrations wlwn prinsts and nuns who ran thn sehools wore rnligious garb as th1~y earrind out tnar.hing and administrativn dutins. lw said. 
"Evnryonn could snn the Catholic identity of thn institu­tion in thosn pnopln," said Yanikoski. 
Ynt diminishing numbnrs. and nwrn lwrs of orders opting for S!H:ufar dress. havn combinnd to dmngn that sensibility at pfacns likn Saint XaviPr Univnrsity in Chi1:ago, which was founded by the Sisters of Merry and where Yanikoski served as thn third fay pn~sidnnt. 
Tlw school's studnnt body has rhang<~d as well. said university spokesman .Josnph Moorn. While tlw pnrcentagn of Catholics is still very high, tmlay's students grew up under Vatican II rnli~rms and am less st!~np!Hl in what might be con­sidnn~d traditional Catholic cui­tun~. lw said. Tlwy are rnquirnd to takn two religion r.ourses, but not nncnssarily on Catholidsm.

Saint Xavier tries to maintain 
its roots by offering a "peer 
mentoring" program in which 
stall' members periodically meet 
after work for informal, faculty­
fed discussions on what it 
means to work in a Catholic 
institution. 
But it's still a challenge. Only two sisters remain among the faculty at the 5,700-student campus, Moorn said. Five more work in other roles at the school. 
Overall, the Chicago congre­gation of sisters has dropped from 800 to 200 since 1967, and the median age is now 79, Moore said. 
The story is similar for Jesuits, whose numbers have been decreasing since the 1960s, according to the Jesuit Conference of the United States. Currently, there are about 3,000 nationwide and their average age is 60. 
Heligious orders are losing prinsts at a fastpr rate than dio­cnsns. Overall. the number of' n~ligious order priests in thn 
U.S. has droppNI from about 23,000 in 1965 to 13,000 this ynar. That's a decline of 43 pnr­cent-steeper than the 30 per­cent slide in total number of' priests nationwide during that period, according to Georgetown University's Center for Applied Hnsearch in the Apostolate. 
The identity issue has bmm of' eoncern to Pope Benedict XVI, who addressed the presidents of' the nation's more than 200 Catholic universitins during his 
U.S. visit in April. I In told the educators that they "have the duty and privilege to ensure that studnnts receive instruction in Catholie doctrine and prae­tiee." 
Catholic higher education is also important in terms of' devnloping the next gennration of' leaders in thn church, Yanikoski said. 
"We know that leadership tal­ent has to be systnmatically devnloped. If' we don't do it in Catholic colleges and universi­ties, where will it bn done'!" he said. 
At La Salle University in Philadelphia, the founding Christian Brothers also face shrinking numbers, said BrothN Joseph Willard, exneu­tivn assistant to thn school prns­iden t. 
To supplmnent the presence of' :~8 brotlwrs who work on 
campus, the college offers La 
Sallian leadership training to its 
lay staff to help infuse the 
order's values of' faith, service 
and community, Willard said. 
Otlicials are also increasing the 
number of liturgical events on 
campus. 
"We consider being Catholic 
in name and Catholic in reality 
is very much what our mission 
is about," Willard said. "The 
mission of the brothers can't die 
with the brothers." 
Saint Joseph's has a similar program for lay stafiJJased on the "spiritual exercises" of St. Ignatius, the Jesuit patron. The 12-to 24-week program is designed to help participants strengthen their relationship with God and make decisions within the context of Gospel val­ues. 
The sehool, which has about two dozen priests working on campus, also plans to offer a biannual seminar on lgnatian teaching for faculty, officials said. 
For students, the 57 -year-old Lannon spearheaded an effort to create a required course called "Faith, .Justice and the Catholic Tradition" -one com­ponent of a revised core cur­riculum approved last week by univnrsity trustens. A previous rnligion requirement did not spedlieally include a course on Catholicism. 
The new elass is meant to ensure that students under­stand key doctrines in Catholicism and the Jesuits' commitment to social justice, compassion for the poor and searching for God in all things, said provost Brice Wachterhauser. 
"Our hope is to produce a deeper understanding of our institutional roots and commit­mEmts," he said. 
Saint Joe's sophomore Marissa Foster, who grew up Methodist in Scranton, Pa., said she's interested in the Jesuit tradition and thinks the required dass is a good idea. 
"I don't think I'd go out on my own" and learn about it, she said. 
But interacting with priests outside the classroom is impor­tant too, Foster said. Seeing Lannon -who lives among stu­dents in university housing ­and other Jesuits regularly on campus and in classrooms hnlps ernato a unique, tight-knit spiritual community.

Bush: federal intervention is temporary 
ADA, Mich. -President Bush said Wednesday he's against government taking part ownership in private businesses, but that it's necessary this time -for a while. "In the long run it's not good for the country," he said. 
Speaking in this traditional election battle­ground state, Bush said he agreed with critics who don't want the government owning pri­vate enterprises. But he said the administra­tion's bank rescue plan was needed to help the nation through the economic crisis. 
"We moved with a plan big enough to make a difference -a plan with features in it that will cause investments to be temporary, because I frankly don't want the government being involved with businesses, owning busi­nesses," he said. "It's not -I don't think it's good for the country." 
World stocks drop due to data 
LONDON -World stocks fell Wednesday after poor U.S. retail sales data stoked con­cerns that global efforts to restore confi­dence in the. financial system will not be enough to stave off a deep recession. 
Wall Street followed Europe and most Asian stocks in heading lower, as the Dow Jones index of leading U.S. shares was down 325.84 points, or 3.5 percent, at 8,985.15, after US retail sales data raised expectations that the world's largest econo­my is already in recession or about to move into one. 
The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed down 314.62 points, or 7.2 percent, at 4,079.59. Germany's DAX ended 
337.56 points, or 6.5 percent, lower at 4,861.63, while France's CAC-40 was 
24 7.45 points, or 6.8 percent, down at 3.381.07. 
The renewed selling pressure was stoked by a U.S. government report showing that retail sales plunged in September by a monthly 1.2 percent almost double the 0.7 percent drop analysts had expected.

Fears send stocks plunging again 
Dow Jones suffers staggering 733-point loss, economic anxiety continues 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Investors agonizing over a faltering economy sent the stock market plunging all over again Wednesday after a stream of disheartening data convinced Wall Street that a recession, if not already here, is inevitable. The market's despair pro­pelled the Dow Jones industrials down 733 points to their second-largest point loss ever, and the major indexes all lost at least 7 percent. 
The slide meant that the Dow, which fell 76 points on Tuesday, has given back all but 127 points of its record 936-point gain of Monday, which came on optimism about the bank­ing system in response to the government's plans to invest up to $250 billion in financial institutions. 
Wednesday's sell-off began after the govern­ment's report that retail sales plunged in September by 1.2 percent -almost double the 0.7 percent ana­lysts expected -made it clear that consumers are reluctant to spend amid a shaky economy and a pun­ishing stock market.

Americans vvary about visiting Ciudad Juarez 
Associated Press 
EL PASO. Texas 
Mexican o!Tieials are trying 
to pnrsuadn Americans to 
visit Ciudad Juarez, touting 
tho city in a new billboard 
campaign as a "land or 
encounters." But on this side 
or the border, that sounds 
like a cruel joke. 
More than 1,100 people havn been killed this year in .luarnz, population 1.5 mil­lion, in a drug-related blood­bath so staggering that the city has been deelared ofT­limits to U.S. soldiers looking to go bar-hopping; El Paso's public hospital is seeing a spi !lover of the wounded; and residents on the Anwrican side are afraid to cross over to visit family, shop or conduct business. 
"We all like to make money, but tlw money I was making isn't worth it," said Fernando Apodaca, who spnnt at least one day a week ror the past 18 years working in Juarez as an auto industry consultant. Al'tnr his Cadillac I\scalade SUV was seiznd in a carjacking last month, Apodaca vowed he wouldn't go over the border again.

"The government isn't in control, and that makes for a very dangerous situation," Tony Payan. an expert on border crime at the University of Texas-EI Paso. "Anyone at any time can commit a <:rime and anyone at any time can become a victim." 
While the bloodshed hasn't yet spilled over to the American side, the violence is costing El Paso, a city of about 600,000 where only 17 homicides were reported in 2007. 
Dozens of shooting victims, several of them U.S. citizens or legal residents, have been treated at Thomason General Hospital -the only facility 
for  250  miles  that  is  
flquipped  to  handle  such  
patients  - at a  cost to local  

taxpayers of more than $1 million. 
The hospital has had sev­eral loekdowns because of fears that hit men would realize a victim was still alive and cross the border to finish thfl job -something that has happened in hospi­tals on the Mexican side.

Bus seat belts mandated 
New Alabama policy requires safety devices after deaths of 4 students 
Associated Press 
DEATSVILLE, Ala.­Smaller school buses will have to be equipped with lap­and-shoulder seat belts for the first time under a govern­ment rule drafted following the deaths of four Alabama students on a school bus that nose-dived ofT an overpass. 
Larger buses also will have higher seat backs under the new policy, which was announced Wednesday. The design change is supposed to keop oldor, heavier students from being thrown over the seats in a collision. 
The seat belts will only have to be installed in new buses weighing 5 tons or less, and the requirement will not take effect until 2011. These smaller school buses are already required to have lap belts, but not the safer, har­ness-style belts. There is no seat belt requirement for larger buses. 
Transportation Secretary Mary Peters said she stopped short of requiring seat belts for larger buses because that could limit the number of children that can squeeze into seats, forcing some chil­dren to travel in ways that aren't as safe as school buses. 
School districts sometimes expect as many as three younger children to share a bus seat, but if there are only two belts installed per seat then fewer children can ride the bus. 
"We wanted to make sure that any measures we put forth don't needlessly limit the capacity of the buses and then force that school or that school district to have more children walking, riding with parents, biking, etcetera," Peters told The Associated Press in an interview. 
At Pine Level Elementary School in Deatsville, about 20 miles north of Montgomery, Gov. Bob Hiley and Deputy 
U.S. Transportation Secretary Thomas Barrett climbed aboard a bus with 12 school­children who have been using the belts in the pilot project. 
It was started after four Lee High School teens were killed in Huntsville on Nov. 20, 2006 when their school bus went over a highway overpass rail and plunged to a street below, with dozens of students flung from seats. 
"We asked the question at that time -would it have been safer if the students on the Huntsville bus had had seat belts?" Riley said. "We were amazed to find out that no one knew." 
A bus driver who has been part of the pilot project, George Caudle, noted that keeping children from unclicking the belts may be a problem. He said the bus can­not start until all are strapped in, but sometimes after he starts driving it's not long before he hears belts being clicked off. 
Jacob Chandler, 12, said he was worried about the belts. 
"If you were to flip over in a pond, the little ones might not be able to get the belt off and they might drown," he said. 
But Monessia Smith, anoth­er 12-year-old, said she sup­ported them. 
"They're good. It keeps kids safe," she said. Schools buy about 2,500 of 
the smaller school buses each year, the Transportation Department said. The buses seat about 16 to 20 students. Larger buses carry more than 50 students. 
The Transportation Department estimates it will. cost about $6.1 million a year to equip new, smaller buses with the three-point seat belts and higher seat backs, and $3.6 million a year to equip new, larger buses with higher seat backs. 
The rule gives schools the option of using federal high­way safety funds to help pay for retrofitting buses with seat belts, in addition to other money already available through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
Jonathan Adkins, a spokesman for the Governors Highway Safety Association, objected to the use of addi­tional federal funds for seat belts on school buses. 
"Federal highway safety money is very limited and using that money to install seat belts on school buses isn't supported by crash data," Adkins said. "School buses are already an incredi­bly safe mode of transporta­tion. We are more concerned about the areas surrounding schools and bus stops. States should not be pressured on this issue." 
The new rule also includes a performance standard for seat belts on new, larger buses so that schools that want to voluntarily add belts will have guidance on what belts are best, Peters said. Providing a common standard may also lower the cost of adding belts, she said. 

Beer enthusiasts find God at annual festival 
Brewers create drinks with divine inspiration 
Associated Press 
DENVER -In the beginning, there was a long line for Judgment Day ale. 
Shortly after the doors opened on the 27th Great American Beer Festival, a crowd congregated at the booth offering that and other pours from The Lost Abbey of San Marcos, Calif., where the tap handle is a Celtic cross and the legacy of beer-brewing monks endures. 
Standing under a banner promising "Inspired beers for Saints and Sinners Alike," pro­prietor and former altar boy Tomme Arthur had a confes­sion: He's using God to sell some beer. 
"It's the oldest story ever told -the struggle between good and evil," said Arthur, 35, a product of Catholic schools in his native San Diego. "There is a battle being waged between those who make good beer and those who make evil beer." 
Without question, unholy excess is in evidence anytime 18,000 gallons of alcohol is served to 46,000 people over three days. See: women in Bavarian maid outfits and "Beer Pong" tables. 
Yet perhaps surprisingly, God could be found at last week's Great American Beer Festival -in the crassly commercial, in homage to religion's long histo­ry in brewing, in needling faiths that turn a suspect eye on drinking, and (if the prophet of home-brewing is to be believed) at the bottom of every glass. 
While alcohol and religion don't always mix, no less a fig­ure than Benjamin Franklin once said: "Beer is living proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy." 
Charlie Papazian, author of "The Complete Joy of Homebrewing," the undisputed bible of the craft, can cite many intersections of beer and the divine. Mayan and Aztec priests controlled the brewing of beer in pre-Columbian days, monks in Bavaria brewed strong bocks for sustenance during Lent and the first brewery in the Americas was founded by Belgium monks in Ecuador in 1534. 
Before Louis Pasteur pin­pointed yeast as the culprit in the 1850s, brewers didn't know what caused fermentation, said Papazian, president of the Boulder, Colo.-based Brewers Association. So they invented one run-on word to describe the mysterious stuff at the bot­tom of the bottle: "Godisgood." 
"As you drain a glass of beer, look at the yeast at the bottom and be reminded that God is good, because that's the way it feels," Papazian said. 
Like most business owners, brewers tend to avoid politics and religion out of fear of alien­ating customers. At the same time, microbrewing has become an intensely competi­tive industry, so putting a saint on a bottle can help a guy stand out. 
When Brock Wagner was looking to name his new brew­ery in Houston 14 years ago, his search took him to the library of a local Catholic semi­nary. There, he found the story of St. Arnold of Metz, the French saint of brewers and 
one of many patron saints of the brewing arts. ­As the tale goes, Arnold {580­
640) urged his people, "Don't drink the water, drink beer" because he believed water boiled in beer was safer than tainted water sources. 
Centuries later, St. Arnold Brewing Co. became Texas' first craft brewery, with a "divine reserve" single-batch beer and 21 fermnnters named for different saints. 
"One purpose of religion is the formation of eommunities, and our brewery kind of has that effect, of bringing pe,,.qple together," said Wagner, who describes himself as spiritual but wary of organized religion. "Some of our regulars say going on our brewery tour is going to church." 
Jeremy Cowan, the marketing mind behind He'Brew (the cho­sen beer), was absent from his company's booth on the festi­val's first day; it was Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement. 
Established in 1996 (or 5757), Cowan's. Schmaltz Brewing Co. uses Jewish humor, scripture and imagery in packaging its beers, all of them kosher. There's Genesis Ale ("our first creation") Messiah Bold ("the one you've been waiting for") and Jewbelation ("L'Chaim!"). 
"I am passionately Jewish," Cowan said. "I don't get as caught up in the legal minutiae. I'm more fascinated in the proj­ect of· Judaism as a civilization. This is the way I participate." 
Some faith traditions reject alcohol as an intoxicant that invites bad behavior and abuse. Observant Muslims and Mormons, among others, abstain from drinking on reli­gious grounds. 
Last year, an evangelical church targeting young adults in the St. Louis area got in trou­ble with the Missouri Baptist Convention for holding a church ministry at a micro­brewery. (The Southern Baptist Convention opposes making, advertising, distributing and consuming alcohol). 
At Denver's Great American Beer Festival, four ex-Mormons who met at Utah State University ran a booth selling "X-Communicated Mormon Drinking Team" T-shirts, sweatshirts and other products. 
"Our business model is to sell enough T-shirts to pay the cost of a group of our friends getting together and having fun for the weekend," said Mike Hansen, 36, of Whitefish, Mont. 
Another entrepreneur ped­dled "WWJB: What Would Jesus Brew?" T-shirts, with an image of a smiling Jesus with a mash paddle in one hand and a pint glass in the other. 
Vinnie Cilurzo of Russian River Brewing Co. in Santa Rosa, Calif., brews a series of religion-themed beers that began with "Damnation." A strong golden ale, the beer's name is a nod to the great Belgian beer Duval, which comes from the Flemish word for devil. 
A restaurant around the cor­ner from Cilurzo 's brewery refused to stock it. 
"It all started with 'Damnation,"' said Cilurzo, who has no religious affiliation. "I felt like if we started with 'Damnation,' we needed to be redeemed. We needed 'Salvation.'"

Is this honesty thing so good? 
They don't give me 800 words every other week to state the obvious. 
But sometimes, when the obvious is so different from what it long has been, it's important to make sure everybody gets what has changed. 
"It's a very 17­year-old American view of the world to think that you should tell someone you love everything and somehow the world will be a better place," a friend told jour­nalist Phillip Weiss in New York magazine. 
Of course, it's not just "someone you love," today. In some ways, we are hon­est with everybody. We say things online that we would not say in person or on the phone. People we've never met know who we are, where we live, who we know, and what we did last weekend. 
We trust this will make the world a better place. 
We are a generation that worships authenticity. Even as we grow up, we will continue to be the 17-year-old American kids who think we should tell most people most things. 
We want honesty, openness, and self­consciousness. We're hyper-conscious of advertising and manipulation. Our politics are the politics of Stephen Colbert: ironic and self-aware. We share some of the most intimate details of our lives on the Internet, accessible to just about anybody if they try hard enough. 
I've written before that the Internet "means that we'll be able to talk more frankly about our experiences and their social implications. Judgments-political and personal-will be informed by an 

acknowledgment of the reality of peo­
ples' behaviors, not by denying their 
existence." Because of the Internet, I 
wrote, maturity will no longer mean 
shaping a public image of yourself sep­
arate from the reality of your past. 
In many ways, this is true-we will have to be more open about ourselves because more information will be instantly available. This is still a good thing. We won't be able to as easily sugarcoat our pasts. We will have to acknowledge complexity and mistakes, and admission will become normalized. From the top down, our policy and interactions will be governed by these acknowledgments. 
But I was wrong, too. This openness won't be-and shouldn't be-as absolute as it might sound. Yes, the Internet means that more information about each of us is available. But college still encourages-or, at least, allows-us to bracket our private and public selves. Increasingly, even those with whom you are closest have lives beyond what you know of them. We're becoming adults, and adults have secrets. 
Today, college and our maturation into adulthood are paradoxical, bal­anced against the ethos of Facebook and nearly-anonymous online conver­sation. 
College and emergence into adult-­hood begin to create entirely separate spheres in which we operate. Before, we operated in small spheres -in gen­eral, one or two social groups dominat­ed our social and academic activities. Most people in our lives knew most other people in our lives. 
Now, we have professors who do not have yearly meetings with our parents to facilitate a well-eoordinated effort towards our growth. We have friends from home, friends from school, friends from summer jobs. We will all move on to the real world, develop new social circles, leave behind the people we know here and the identities we've cre­ated with them. 
Think of it like Bug Juice-style camp friends versus home friends, super­sized. 
I don't only say this to boast about my many friends. Because we begin to exist in separate spheres in college, it represents a time we can deline our­selves di!Terently for different people. 
This is not earth shattering. Freshman year has always represented the ability of people to recreate them­selves, without preeonceived notions. And adulthood has always facilitated further expansion of these different public and private identities. 
But for us-unlike for our parents or even older siblings-this is mixed with a need to be partially honest about what we've been. Now, your first imprnssions of your roommate aren't the body of your experiences with them. Instead, your first impression is a somewhat fil­tered, pre-packaged virtual self. It is a self over which we have limited-and definitely less-control. It makes it more challenging to define each other based solely on our experiences with each other. 
This is the paradox of a Faccbook world. Just as we come of age to define ourselves, we arn tied to our past.

Message in a meltdown 
After suffering record-breaking losses last week, the stock market finally began a potential recovery on Monday with a bang, jumping up 11percent in the best single day ever. Close-up pho­
tos of joyful,

pers everywhere.  

The non-stop news coverage of this financial crisis has felt overwhelming at times, and in fact it did trump all other news for the past week or so. After all, investment banks and individual investors watched trillions of dollars evaporate overnight. Jobs and compa­nies and homes that seemed secure have been exposed as overbuilt on shaky foundations. This financial melt­down has touched just about everybody somehow. 
On one level, we all have to hope that really, really smart people who have taken the best interests of the common good to heart can help us out of this mess, without letting it become hope­lessly politicized or lobbied into com­plete ineffectiveness. 
On another level, though, can we view this crisis as an opportunity? A chance for a fresh start? A reason tore-exam­ine what we really hold nearest to our hearts? While there's certainly nothing wrong with accumulating and spending money, perhaps we've been sucked into the very alluring and constant call of our culture to make a god out of con­suming, placing our money or material possessions at the center of our own attention. Maybe we've even come to believe that if we lead good and faithful lives, our very prosperity itself serves as a sign from God that he is pleased with us, that he has somehow blessed our efforts. Yet nowhere in the example of the life or words of Jesus Christ; or anywhere in our Scripture; or in the Tradition of the Church do we find that we can place all our trust in anything but the kingdom of heaven. 
When we find the rug -financial or otherwise -pulled out from under us, our faith calls us to a new way of think­ing. We can come to a new awareness of our true dependence on God; we can recognize the truth that our lives rest in God's hands, no matter the balance in our checking or savings accounts, the labels on our clothing, the University we attend, the kind of car we drive, or the prestige of our new job. 
Our faith may call us to a new way of living. Why not try to get by on less of everything? Make your downsizing intentional and purposeful, so that you have more room and time and resources for life as a follower of Christ. Then, try giving something away. Guess what somebody out there needs it more than you do, whatever "it" is: a pair of shoes, a winter coat, a few hours of your time, a couch or a chair, or a hun­dred dollars. 
In other words, let's try to recognize that we depend on God even more deeply than we depend on our individ­ual (or our national) financial success, and let's try to live like it. With utterly perfect timing, this Sunday's Gospel reminds us that we ought to pursue our relationship with God more closely than the workings of our government and economy. As Jesus fearlessly tells the angry Pharisees and Herodians, "Repay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God." Though his audience has been trying to trap him by forcing him to take a side, Jesus neatly demonstrates that the coin of the realm is a limited currency, and that to recognize that God's demands go beyond the secular economy is to acknowledge the real truth of the mat­ter. 
The sense of panic and urgency which has accompanied the-lion-stop news reports will no doubt subside in the coming weeks and months. Will we just move on to the next "big thing," or can we force ourselves to remember what it feels like to be on such shaky ground? Can we, also with a sense of urgency, ask God by our prayers, actions and choices to help us continually re-align our priorities?

Usually, I'm embarrassed by the notorious "boo birds" of Philadelphia, whose claim to fame is, according to legend, having booed Santa Claus. It's a reputation that's earned Philadelphia sports fans a bad name around numerous professional leagues, and it even led me to a brief stint as a Dallas Cowboys fan in fourth grade. But there was something about this booing that seemed different. It was impassioned, and directed not at something superficial, but rather at some common dislike for a public figure. And despite how out ofplace it seemed and how much ofit was probably caused by excessive imbibing, I couldn't help but feel somewhat inspired when hearing it. 
Across America, there is a renewed sense ofpolitical activism. Voter turnout stands to be at record levels, with the young and old alike getting more and more involved in the political process. As November approaches, activists all over the country have only one concern-getting their candidate elected and cheering vehemently against the oppo­sition. This is not an election characterized by indifference-people have strong feel­ings, and they're willing to voice them. 
But there's a reality check question that's been on my mind for some time now. With all this focus on Nov. 4, what's the day after going to look like? Columbia's liberal envi­ronment is no secret, and there seems to be some common responses to the notion of McCain's winning. Surveying three people randomly with the question "What would you do if McCain won the election?" I was met with only two answers. The first was ''I'd buy a flask and drink it instead of going to class," and the second-which I heard twice-was ''I'd move to Canada." The log­ical question becomes, then -is that renewed sense of American political activism going to be reduced by half come Nov. 5? My columns, as some ofyou might have noticed, tend to have at least a little relation to Shakespeare. He-watching the classic Marlon Brando Julius Caesar this past weekend, I was reminded ofhow pow­erful a people's interaction with its leader can be. One element of it struck me, in par­ticular, perhaps due to its current relevance -the desire of a few high-ranking men to take power into their own hands. 
Shakespeare's plays, particularly his his­tories, are often concerned with how to deal with a ruler who has become tyrannical. The question underlying Julius Caesar is whether taking desperate action is justified when a leader has overstepped his bounds. To be clear from the outset, I am well aware of how different Roman times were, and in no way would I consider unlawful overthrow of the government or the violent stabbing of a political leader to be justified in today's day and age. But in the abstract, Caesar portrays passion for the political process extending so far as to provoke a form of activism -the kind of activism that arises only when you stand in opposition to those in charge. 
Now is not the time for indifference. In the midst of economic turmoil and an unpopular war, now is the time to stand up for what we believe in-whether we're standing with or against the sitting execu­tive power. Shakespeare challenged his audience with the question of whether or not extreme action was justified, but nowhere in his text is there any implication that apathy would have been commend­able. The conspirators perhaps went too far, but the lesson remains the same -it is our responsibility in a democracy to remain politically active, whether or not our candi­date makes it into office. 
There is nobility in opposing those in power. Whether it's by marching on Capitol Hill or rallying the vote for 2012, it's as important a part of the democratic process as is supporting your own candidate. Shakespeare tells us that Romans didn't allow Caesar's power to remain unchecked, and neither should we -neither by moving to Canada nor by drinking ourselves into oblivion. 
"You are not wood, you are not stones, but men," declares Antony to the Roman mob. As men, we must continue to fight for what we believe in and refrain from becom­ing idle creatures -whether or not Election Day goes the way Wf! want it to. At the very least, remember that life will go on as long as we're able to boo public officials at hockey games.

College debt adds up after school 
On average, AU students graduate with $19,000 in debt-near the national aver­age of $20,000. It is a credit to this univer­sity's fmancial aid system that we are under the national average for college debt, especially when one factors in Staff Editorial AU's sticker price. Board 
But $19,000 still isn't spare change. We can only hope The Eagle that an AU degree will help us pull in big bucks after graduation and enable us to pay off our student loans and then quickly get back into debt for more fulftll­ing things, such as expensive cars that we can't atl"ord. The Princeton Review ranked AU's career placement services as the 18th-best in the nation this year. With the help of these services, as well as a vibrant job market in the surrounding area, a good-paying job -and that sweet car -is possible. Even then, the payment of all $19,000 in student loans will surely be a drain on a graduate's finances for years to 
come. 
It seems that this debt is a necessary by­product of our competitive college system. Students at private universities had cheap­er options available when they chose to opt for a private education over a public uni­versity. Even though a state's university system is still more expensive than some of our European counterparts systems, for the most part they offer solid educations for less money than private universities. This interplay between cheaper state uni­versities and more expensive private insti­tutions keep American colleges globally competitive. 
The best advice for students is to save as much money as possible during their col­lege years. Every bit of money you can divert away from alcohol-or whatever else it is you splurge on -towards your student loan will pay off in the future. Another good move would be to get your­self a part-time job so you can make a little extra money and come out of college in good fmancial standing. Save carefully and you can graduate college and move on to a job you enjoy, rather than one that just makes you money. Here at AU, a politically active campus, many students make this choice anyway. 
It's a simple lesson: save now, benefit later. Save now, and you can afford to hitchhike down to South Anwrica -or whatever you plan to do-after you grad­uate. The recent economic downturn means your student loans are bound to become more expensive. Offset them early and you can at least come out of college with a clean financial slate.

"It's a really interesting show. Last year I was in South Bend and a lot of people wanted to come. It was one of my best shows if not the best," Mencia said. 
Mencia enjoyed the performance so mueh that he promised to return to South Bend for another performance. 
"Some doubted that I would be back next year," he said. "After the show I thought. 'Wow. this is a great market!'" 
Carlos Mencia's most recent success can be attributed to the popular sketch eomedy show, "Mind of Meneia," which recently eompleted its fourth season on the television network Comedy Central. 
Since Mencia," has enj increasing suc­eess, becoming a staple ·on the popular comedy network. 
Known for his exploitation of stereo­types and questionable depictions of ethnic and social groups, Mencia's comedy is often criticized as inappro­priate and crude. Mencia, however, disagrees. 
"American has freedom of speech. I'm not trying to be edgy or controver­sial. I'm really not doing it to get a reaction. I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of thought and I exercise it," Mencia said. 
While his jokes may seem abrasive to some, Mencia believes the arousal caused by his jokes is simply the exag­gerated reaction of the "sensitive soci-

While Carlos Mencia continues his "At Close Range" tour of 80 American cities, he is unsure of what endeavors the future holds. Hegardless of what path his career takt~s after his tour concludes in January, Mencia wants his fans to know that his time in enter­tainment is far from over.

American pop culture is in the midst of a severe downward spiral. While comedy endeavors have held their own in relation to the past as well as the rest of the world. other genres of entertainment are virtually in ruins. "Beverly Ilills Chihuahua/' topped the box office this past weekend. The American movie viewing public isn't "aggressively mediocre," they're aggressively idiotic. 
Pop music isn't much better. While .Jennifer Hudson and Robin Thicke bat­tle for the top spot on the charts, many college students count annoying, banal acts such as Maroon 5 and Coldplay among their favorites (Or "favs"). It is far from surprising 
U.S. and Europe. 
This Sunday night, the traveling band of troubadours pulled the caravan over just two blocks shy of Wrigley Field at the famous Metro. The Metro has qui­etly become one of the best concert venues in the U.S. recently. With a capacity nodding over 1 ,000, the Metro established itself in the 1980s and early 90s as a destination for up and coming alternative acts. Notable shows have included The Smashing Pumpkins farewell concert, as well as two Bob Dylan shows following the release of the stunning "Time Out of Mind." 
After a quick 30-minute set by moun­tain folkie Frank Fairfiled, the five bearded gentlemen from the Pacific Northwest took the stage. Pecknold's voice was reminiscent of Graham Nash, yet his tenor maintained its 
strength even as he 
work, Kerouac trades the speed­infused 6 a.m. jazz blowouts for a bot­tle of wine and the terrain of the American Northwest. 
Crowd favorites included the up­tempo "Mykonos" and the set closer "Blue Ridge Mountains." The 15-song, 90-minute set was broke up by Pecknold performing two songs with­out his bearded friends. The lead singer sang a touching version of Judee Still's "Crayon Angels," followed by the acoustic ballad "Oliver James." During their encore, the band also treated the capacity crowd, which included members of Wilco and Beach House, to a new, unreleased song, "Silver City." Pecknold picked up an electric on this tune, yet there were no "Judas" declarations as the Foxes showed that their new album will con­tinue to accentuate their knack for harmonic melodies. 
Since their last stint in the capital of the Midwest, the Foxes have clearly matured as a live act. Their live per­formance now accentuates their mag­nificent debut record. Pecknold looked comfortable throughout the night, trading jokes with the audience. At one point Pecknold responded to a member of the audience, "You really would rather have corn than Sarah Palin as your V.P.?" Most of the audience nod­ded in jest, but also with the hope that in some fashion a part of this band could enter their society. It won't hap­pen, but if it did what a more tolerable place America would be.

While the lavish praise has created some doubters, the Foxes have responded by touring relentlessly throughout the

Kazmir to start 
game five for Rays 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -The Tampa Bay Rays are giving Scott Kazmir the chance to pitch them into the World Series. 
The 24-year-old left-bander was moved up in the rotation so he could start in the potential AL pennant clincher against the Boston Red Sox on Thursday night at Fenway Park. The move keeps Kazmir on his regular rest and bumps scheduled starter James Shields to the if-necessary Game 6 at home Saturday. 
"I was very eager for this opportunity to get back out there and try to redeem myself from my last outing," said Kazmir, who allowed five runs in 4 1-3 innings in Game 2. ''I'm not real­ly going to think about it too much, about 'This win right here will take us to the World Series.' I'm just going to go out there and have fun. Our team is real loose. It's kind of like we don't even realize the situation that we're in right now." 
Kazmir will match up against Daisuke Matsuzaka, who went 18-3 in the regular season and beat the Rays in Game 1 of the AL championship series. The defending World Series champi­ons have lost three in a row since then to fall to the brink of elimi­nation, but it's a position that has served them well: They're 7-1 in elimination games since 2004, including Matsuzaka's victory in Game 7 of the ALCS against Cleveland last year. 
"Believe me when I tell you: How he pitches this -the inten­sity, the meaning, as much as 
this game means-that will help 
him," Red Sox manager Terry 
Francona said Wednesday, a day 
after the Rays beat Boston 13-4 
to take a 3-1 lead in the best-of­
seven series. "That won't hinder 
him.'' 
Matsuzaka has been Boston's 
most reliable pitcher in the play­
offs, with the Red Sox winning 
each of his first two starts. 
Meanwhile, Jon Lester struggled 
in his last start, and Josh Beckett 
has had problems in both of his. 
Beckett's problem appears to be the lingering effects of a side strain he sustained at the end of the regular season, an injury that has deprived Boston of the ace who was 6-2 with a 1. 7 3 ·ERA in his postseason career 
before this year. 
''I'm not Beckett," Matsuzaka 
said. "But if I can pitch like he 
did last year and hand the ball 
off to the guys behind me, that 
would be great." 
If he can, the Red Sox will need 
Beckett and Lester to rebound in 
Games 6 and 7 if they're going to 
have any chance at a third title 
in five years. In both previous 
World Series runs, the Red Sox 
came back from a 3-1 deficit in 
the ALCS -in 2004 they trailed 
the Yankees 3-0 -to win the 
pennant. 
"If we can draw on anything 
from tlmt, good," Francona said. 
"Anything that's happened in 
your past -you try to turn it 
into an advantage for you. 
Saying that, this is a different 
team, it's a different Tampa 
team. But, again, we'll use any­
thing we can to give us any kind 
of advantage."

Clearly, though, the injury has been big news since the Colts announend July 14 that Manning needed surgery. 
Tho surgery was the seeond higgnst story during training 1:am p, exceeded only by Brott Favre's summer soap opera in Creon Bay.

Irish head to West Lafayette 
Khabibulin's 29 SeLves 
By ERIC PRISTER 
Sports Writer 
The Irish will try to continue their winning ways when they compete this weekend at the Lady Northern Tournament in West Lafayette, Ind. They are coming off a record-setting first-place finish at the Heather Parr Memorial, a big confi­dence boost for the Irish. 
"I look for the team to really be ready to play," Irish coach Susan Holt said. 
The Irish will face all of the teams in the Big Ten, including Purdue, Michigan State and Ohio State, all of whom are in the top 25. 
"!The Lady Northern! is a 
real opportunity for us to pick they're playing. It's a good test

llolt said. 
The match is a two-day event that will be played on Purdue's Kampen Golf Course. The course, Holt said, is a difficult one, but is similar to Notre Dame's own Warren Golf Course. 
"The greens are very big. We have to hit the ball in the right place or you could be three­putting all day long," Holt said. "But, the kids are used to doing those types of things when

Khabibulin kept it close until Heather Farr, 
the Chicago Blackhawks' which includes 
offense took over midway senior captain 
through the second period. Lisa Maunu, jun­
Khabibulin made 29 saves, ior Annie Brophy, 
and Martin Havlat, Patrick sophomores So­
Sharp, Brian Campbell and Hyun Park and 
rookie Colin Fraser scored in Katie Conway 
the final 29 minutes to lead and freshman 
the Blackhawks to their first (1-2-1) scored more than two goals in a game for the first time this season. 
Khabibulin kept it score­less early. He made several close-in saves until a power­play goal by Phoenix's Peter Mueller at 4:30 of the second gave the Coyotes a 1-0 lead. 
"We got great goaltending in the first period," Chicago coach Denis Savard said. "Then we got some breaks and the puck went in for us." 
A big hit by Chicago rookie defenseman Aaron Johnson on Phoenix's Viktor Tikhonov in the second seemed to fire up the Blackhawks. 
So did a highlight-reel goal by Havlat with 8:25 left in the period that tied it at 1. Havlat skated in from the left point, danced around Phoenix defenseman David Hale, stickhandled across the slot and beat goalie Ilja Bryzgalov with a high back­bander. 
"That was the play we were waiting for," Chicago captain Jonathan Toews said. "When he pulled that, we were laughi l1g on the bench. I couldn't believe he pulled that off. We went to work and everything came together." 
Added Havlat: "It was one of the prettier ones, but it doesn't matter how you score. The whole team was working hard and 'Habby' was unbelievable tonight." 
Fraser's goal was his first in the NHL. Campbell's was his first with the Blackhawks after signing an eight-yeal', $56.7 million free..agent con­tract. 
"With every game, we're getting a little better," Campbell said. "Tonight the turnovers were down a ton, although we came out a little loose." 
Bryzgalov made 26 saves in the Coyotes' first loss after opening with two victories. 
"We played too easy of a game," Phoenix coach Wayne Gretzky said. 'After a period and a half, we started to cheat a little bit. If you cheat, you're going to get beat at this level." 
The Coyotes played most of the game without defense­man Derek Morris, who was injured in the first period and didn't return. Team offi­cials wouldn't comment on Morris' condition. 
Mueller's opened the scor­ing on a high, screened shot from the right circle moments after a 5-on-3 Phoenix advantage lapsed to a 5-on-4. 
After Havlat tied it at 1, Sharp gave the Blackhawks a 2-1 lead with 58 seconds left in the second, just after a Chicago power play expired. From the right edge of the crease, Sharp ripped in a rebound of Keith's shot from the point.

Belles get first MIAA win 
By ALEX BARKER Sports Wri[er 
Saint Mary's notched its first MIAA win of the season with a 4-0 victory over Trine Wednesday, breaking a five­game losing streak. 
The Belles grabbed the lead in the 23rd minute when sen­ior Lauren !linton assisted junior Mieki 1-Iedinger on her second goal of the season.

"We've seen IndiMa play a few times ti1L<> year because we played down at their tournament and they played up at ours earlier in the sea<;on," Clark said. "They are a very good team and they are similar to us. This will be a big test for us because they always work really hard. They are com­ing off a loss so they'll be ready for us." 
While Indiana enters Thursday's game in less th<Ul con­vincing form, the Irish have impressed with their recent play. After a two-game losing streak to Louisville and Michigan, Notre Dame seems to have regained the 2-0 lead heading into halftime. This goal marked the first time the Belles have scored more than onee in a game this season. 
But it didn't stop there. In the 62nd minute, the fresh­men duo of Michelle Leonard and Michelle Marshall hooked up on Marshall's first eareer goal to give the Belles a deci­sive lead. 
Hinton added her fifth goal of the season in the 69th minute to finish orr the Thunder. 
In a rainy-match, the Belles put together their jwst domi­nating performance of the sea­
early-season form that saw the lrL<;h rise a<; high a<> No. 3 in the polls. La<;t wonk, the lri<>h defeat­ed Michigan State <Uld Pitl<;burgh by a eombined smre of 7-1. 
The catalyst for last week's impressive resull<; wa<; a dynmnie offensive attack that has helped the Irish overwhelm opponents at times this sea<>on. Notre Dame is currently averaging 2.5 goal<; per gam{\ which L<; good for second in the nation. 
"It's a fun team to watch," Clark said after the Pittsburgh game. "We have a lot of attacking per­sonalities Md very skillful players. It's hard to single Mybody out. On My given day somebody difl(Jrent eM step up." 
Ten different Irish players have found the back of the net so far thi<> season. Despite the bal<Ulced son, outshooting Trine 33-0. 
Junior Patty Duffy played the first 70 minutes in goal before senior Nicole Beier took her place to finish out the game. They combined to pro­vide Saint Mary's with its sec­ond shut-out win of the sea­son. 
The Belles improve to 2-9-1 on the season with a 1-4 con­ference reeord.

Brown said she does not believe being behind or ahead in the standings has any effect on the way the team plays. She said she considers the team highly determined to win. 
"The team has that atti­tude to compete all the time anyway," Brown said. "Needing motivation is not a factor for us. We are already motivated." 
Coming up first today is a trip to play a struggling DePaul (2-16, 1-5 Big East) on the road. Brown said she feels confident that the team will be ready for the game, but is concerned about some fatigue creeping in around midterms. 
On Tuesday is a rare non­conference opponent, Long Beach State (14-3, 4-1 Big West). The Irish hope this matchup will keep the team sharp over the break and allow the team to improve without affecting the confer­ence standings. 
"It is really good for us to have a match thrown in there," Brown said. "There is no question that we are going to be playing to win. We are going to be pushed." 
At the end of fall break will be matchups against Big East opponents Villanova (11-9, 2-3 Big East) and Seton Hall (10-10, 2-3 Big East). Although both teams are below .500 in the Big East, Brown said she's con­cerned that her team be properly prepared to face the Wildcats and Pirates. 
"Both of these teams are good," Brown said. "With the parity in the Big East, every team could beat any other team on any given night." 
These games are coming at the right time for the Irish, as they finally feel like they are starting to get healthy. Brown said she was espe­cially happy that she has no new InJUries to report. Junior outside hitter Serinity Phillips and freshman libero/defensive specialist Frenchy Silva are back and playing well, Brown said. Junior middle blocker Tara Enzweiler is getting ready to comeback soon. 
Notre Dame will be back in the gym on campus in two weeks when it faces Big East foes Syracuse (1~~-9. 4-1 Big East) and Marquette (7-10, 2-3 Big East).

Waldrum said. "But they're going to be there in the end and you just know [Huskies coach Len Tsantirisl is going to get them turned around." 
Connecticut, which was ranknd earlier in the season, has had to struggle just to even up its Big East record at 2-2-3. 
''I'm a little leery of them bocause it's a bit of a situa­tion where they feel like they havn to win." Waldrum said. "They're like a wounded ani­mal. They need to win just to survive and keep their hopes for tho NCAA Tournament ­and oven the Big East tourna­ment-alive."

ND CROSS COUNTRY 
Squad runs in pre-NCAAs 
By LAURA MYERS 
Sports Writer 
Consider it a midterm nxam for the nwn's and women's cross country tPams. 
While most students will be relaxing Saturday, the runners will face their toughnst chal­lnngn yet when they travnl to Tnrrn Jlautl~. Ind., for the pre­NCAA nHwt. 
Doing wPil at the pre-NCAA ment would be a major step for Notrn Dame to earn an at­largo tnam bid to tlw NCAA Hngionals and Championships, which take place in Novnmber. 
"It's a must-pnrform meet to get at-largo points and have a rnalistic chance to make the NCMs," women's head coach Tim Comwlly said. 
The Irish faced national competition for the first time this season on Oct. 3 at the Notre Dame Invitational, which featured several ranked teams. There, the men tied for sixth place and the women lin­ished in 11th place. 
llownver, Connelly said he thought his team could have done hotter. 
"We came up a little short of where we wantnd to be, where we needed to be," he said. 
The love! of competition will be even higher in Terre llaute, as 23 of the top 30 women's tnams will be competing and 24 of the top 30 men's teams will be competing, according to tho U.S. Track and Field Cross Country Coaches Association.

"If we had run a lot better two weeks ago, we would be well-entrenched in the top 30," Connelly said. 
Both tpams have an even distribution of veterans and rookies who have done well. Senior Patrick Smyth linished first among the Irish and fifth overall at the ND Invitational. The next three linishers were sophomores Dan Jackson and Paul Springer, and freshman Ryan Gamboa. It was only the second career race for Jackson and Gamboa.

In-state rivalry reneW"ed against No. 22 Hoosiers 
By GREG ARBOGAST Sports Writer 
Aftnr recent matehes against out­of-stato opponents, No. 9 Notre Dame will travel to Bloomington Thursday to mnew its rivalry with No. 22 Indiana. 
The Hoosiers await the Irish in what will be the 29th installmnnt of thP seriPs bntwPPn thn two schools and the eighth consecutivP year they have met. Indiana holds a 22­5-1 edge in the all-time series, but Notre Dame has enjoyed a rPcent run of success, going 4-4 against the Hoosiers under coach Bobby Clark's tenure. 
If recent signs are any indication, the Irish have a good shot to move above .500 against Indiana with CJark at the helm. 
The Hoosiers enter Thursday's game with a 6-4-2 record and a 2­0 loss to Michigan State in the team's most recent game on Oet. 
12. Indiana is eurrently averaging only slightly more goals scored than conceded at a 1.33 to 1.25 dip. 
Tlw lloosicrs' slow start is some­what surprising given that they rnturn nine starters from a team that won the Big Ten title and advanced to the second round of the NCM Tournament in 2007. Clark, however, said he still feels that Notre Dame's in-state rival will provide a stern test.

Thrnn of the upcoming games are in tlw Big East, which could help the Irish (IJ-9, 4-2 Big East) move 
closer to their goal of win­ning the regular season con­fnrenco title. With a .500 weekend against West Virginia ((J-12, 0-6 Big East) and Pittsburgh (13-8, 5-1), tlw Irish fell from first placP in the conference to a tie for third with Cincinnati (16-5), Ceorgetown (11-8) and Louisville (8-9).
