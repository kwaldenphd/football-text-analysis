Dining Hall Comm. Meeting 


Chef Named To North Dining Hall 
Food Services Director 
Bernard Mehall told the Dining 
Hall Committee last night that a 
number of changes including a 
new North Dining Hall chef have 
been instituted on committee 
suggestion. Talking to a dinner 
meeting in the South Dining 
Hall, Mehall promised action on 
other requests, and stated that 
the university hopes soon to find 
a qualified sanitarian to 
supervise health facilities in the 
dining halls. 
Stay Senator Steve Ahern, 
who has directed Senate work 
on dining hall conditions, was 
optimistic over the results of the 
meeting, saying "Mr. Mehall is 
putting a conscientious effort 
into answering the many re­
quests of the students. He has 
engaged a new chef for the 
North Dining Hall, has begun 
plans for initiating special food 
nights, and is in the process of 
putting heat lamps into the din­
ing halls." 
Ahern, while praising the 
work done by Mehall, expressed 
hope that the Student Life 
Council will approve the for­
mation of a board of directors 
over the dining halls in a meeting 
Monday night. The board, a un­
animous recommendation of the 
SLC subcommittee on the dining 
halls, would consist of five stu­
dents and three dining hall dir­
ectors. It would be a governing 
body, but decisions of the group 
can be referred to the SLC on 
the appeal of one board mem­
ber. 
The major announcement at 
the meeting last night was un­
doubtedly the new North Dining 
flail chef. North Dining Hall 
manager Mr. Marion D. Hayes 
was optimistic about the sel­

YR's Meet 

Three resolutions were passed last night at a meeting of the Notre Dame Young Republicans. 
YR Chairman Mike Kelly introduced two of the resolutions. The first listed proposals intended to increase the credibility of the Republican Party among America's black community. Kelly informed the members that the resolution 
'Would be forwarded to other YR Clubs. "We hope to have the National Committee deluged with these resolutions as passed by hundred of GOP organizations," he remarked. 
Kelly's other resolution urged Bill R uckelshaus, unsuessful Republican candidate for Senate this fall, to run again in 1970. 
The third resolution supported the stand taken by the NO Young American for Freedom regarding the recent action of the Campus Judicial Board. Proposed by Bob Marucki, the motion allowed money from the YR treasury to be used to pay for WSND advertisements attacking the board's postponement in the trial of Marty McNamara. 
The meeting also dealt with details of upcoming fund raising projects and campus activities. 
ection, commenting "I think we've got a real good man." Mehall echoed Hayes' sen­timents, pointing to better food preparation and the institution 
of more desert, salad, and fruit 
juice selections in the much cri­
ticized facility. The North Din· 
ing Hall has been the scene of 
two mass food poisonings over 
the last few months and was 
damaged in a food riot in 
January of last year. 

Besides the new chef, Mehall 
told the committee that special 
food nights are being instituted, 
the first to be a Mexican dinner 
in early February. Regarding 
sanitary conditions, he said Dr. 
Lewis E. Howell, Chairman of 
the St. Joseph Health De· partment visited the dining halls last week to speak with em­

Think selfishly about your own career before you decide on one with Du Pont. 
Be selfish. But be honest. You've put in a lot of tough years to get your degree. Your allegiance lies with a professional discipline. 
Why, then, must you decide now to plight your trust to a company for life? Don't. Join a company first. If it doesn't advance you within that professional discipline, well, you're not married to it. 
reported on increased inspection of silverware in the North Dining Hall, saying improvements were being made in this major area of 
student and committee com­
plaint.
In addition to reporting on pregress, Mehall spent more than a half hour taking suggestions from committee members. He pledged to increase the number of selections on all food items in the dining halls, and said a mini· mum of three salad dressings would be set out at all meals. The committee was not hesitant to suggest changes, and one member went to considerable length re~ommending im­provements in spaghetti sauce and meatballs. At the end of the meeting, Mehall suggested another session early next month "to see if we can make

Many have found career enrichment at Du Pont. This comes from being handed a ball and being expected to run with it. From working with top people, from growing in a company where the opportunities are always wide open and the projects are often way out. 
Many have found professional fulfillment and have built a very full, varied and happy life as "Du Ponters." 
Others have found, after working at Du Pont, that their professional interest lay in teaching, in further study or in an industry that offered even wider scope in their particular discipline. All of these men left Du Pont far better qualified professionally than when they came.

THE OBJERUER 

Spencer Makes Hay, But Irish Win, 84-77 

By GREG WINGENFELD 
Notre Dame sloughed off a 30 point outburst by All-America candidate Spencer Haywood and a rash of technical fouls on the way to an 84-77 victory over the University of Detroit last night at the Convo. 
Haywood looked every bit as good as his newspaper clippings, gathering in 16 rebounds and intimidating people on defense in addition to his bucket pro­duction. But the Irish offense placed five men in double figures to offset his showing, Capt. Bob Arnzen leading the parade with 23 markers. 
For a while it looked as though technicals would play a major role in the outcome of the game, as Coach Johnny Dee and two of his players were slapped with the fouls in the opening minutes of the second half. Ac­tually, Dee's sin was committed at the conclusion of the initial stanza as he chose to find fault they never relinquished. with a number of calls. Thus, Haywood's defensive efforts Detroit came out of the locker became more cautious after he room knowing they'd have two picked up his fourth foul with free throws and the ball (Dee 8:28 to play. The Irish streak suffered a double T), to go with started about a minute later. their 44-40 lead. The first half was a nip and

Denny On Joe 
NEW YORK (UPI)-Denny McLain, who's had his picture on the front page a couple of times himself, looked at Joe Namath's picture on the front page and smiled. 
"I feel good for him," Detroit's super winner said about the New York Jets' super duper. 
"I know how he must feel. I never met him but from what I read I like him. He's the same type of fellow I am. He talks a lot and people get the wrong idea about him. It's no crime to say what you feel, is it? He backs up everything he says, too, doesn't he? You have to like a guy like that. I think what he accomplished down in Miami was something out of sight." 
One of those listening to the Tigers' 31-game winner at the Hotel New Yorker, where he was helping ballyhoo the annual sporting goods fair, suggested Namath would make a bundle of money now in the wake of that 16-7 mother of all upsets over the Baltimore Colts. 
"Good for him," said McLain, displaying not even so much as a cuticle of envy. "He deserves everything he gets and whatever it is I wish him twice as much." 
McLain wondered what the Jets' dressing room was like following their Super Bowl spectacular. 
"A madhouse," said a guy who had been in it. 
"Rougher than ours after we won?'' McLain wanted to know. 
"Rougher than yours." 
"Nothing could top our pennant celebration," he insisted. 
"This did," the guy said. 
"Our World Series dressing room was nothing, but I still say nobody could beat our pennant celebration." McLain said. 
"How do you think Namath feels today .now that he's had a little 
time to think it over?'' Somebody else in the group inquired of the 
Detroit right-hander. 
"Well, I know how I felt once the original shock wore off. You 
can't find words to describe it, but I realized I couldn't have done what I did without the other 24 players. What I wanted to do was express my feeling to them, to let my teammates know how I felt. I'm pretty sure he-Namath-must feel the same way." 
The subject swung over to baseball and naturally there was the inevitable question: How many games did McLain think he'd win next season? 

"I don't think I gonna win 30," he spoke right up. "People forget I had everything going for me last season. We had a great ball club and I think we still have but you never can tell about injuries or things like that. All I really care about is winning the pennant again. That's the big thing. Look, with the kind of ball club we had last year any one of our four starters could've won 30. If we win the pennant again next season I wouldn't care if I was 7-6, 10-9 or 20-19." 
"Seven-six would be okay with you, too?'' 
"That's right, if we won," McLain repeated. "My goal is to win the pennant. If the ball club has a good year, I'll have one, too. I'm not worried about that." 
McLain has been on a tough schedule this winter, making appearances and playing the organ, but the grind somehow hasn't shown on him at all. 
"I'm okay but I was exhausted last week," he admitted. "I went 3~ days without sleep during one stretch. I left Los Angeles midnight Monday and didn't get to bed again until Thursday morning. In between I made stops in Detroit, Sharon, Pa., Albion, N.Y., and Chicago. I didn't mind though. I was playing the Hammond organ and I love it." 
When the conversation returned again to football and Namath, McLain suddenly remembered something he had in common with the Jets' quarterback. 
"I've got a white mink coat fike he has," laughed the Tiger ace. 
"Namath's coat isn't white mink," someone put in, "it's black seal." McLain shrugged. So who's counting anyway? 
Whitmore got themselves in foul trouble at three apiece. 
The crowd of 10,495 growled its disapproval at each and every call made by referees Art White and Tony Portorello, until the Irish broke into the lead to stay. The technical called on Collis Jones for alledgedly grabbing the rim as he tried to block a shot induced the first major hail of programs and other refuse in Convo history. 
Capt. Arnzen got able scoring support from teammates Murphy (18), Jones (15) and Whitmore (13). Arnie lead the club in rebounds with 13. Back­court whiz Jackie Meehan dir­ected the Irish attack for most of the second half, hitting on both his jumpers and handling the ball through the Titans press­ing attempt at a comeback.
