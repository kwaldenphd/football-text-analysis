Jenkins returning to classroom for Lenten course 
Cunningham to join University President for five-time, one-credit Sunday afternoon theology class 
By KATE ANTONACCI 
News Editor 

On the first Sunday of Lent, University President Father John Jenkins will step back into the classroom to co­teach the newly-offered one­credit theology course "Know Your Catholic Faith: God is Love." 
"It will be on Sunday after­noon and I'm teaching it with [theology professor] Larry Cunningham," Jenkins said Wednesday. 
Composed of "around 35 
students," the course was open to individuals of all lev­els in the University, from undergraduates to law stu­dents to 
S a i n t Mary's stu­dents. Students were able to register at the end of last semester 

and early Jenkins this semes­ter, Jenkins said. 
The course gains its name 
from Pope Benedict XVI's first encyclical "God is Love," which is the focus of the five Sunday sessions. 
"It's simply a kind of look at encyclical, at the themes and issues that it raises," Jenkins said. "It's a chance to under­stand the encyclical." 
The course will meet from 6 to 7 p.m. in the Coleman­Morse Center and will then participate in Sunday Vespers together in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, according to the InsideND course descrip­tion. 
Though there are just five classes, Jenkins said that he may have to "miss a class or two" because of travel engagements. 
A short reflection paper each week and attendance at all five sessions is required to earn the course credit. The Office of the President is also holding an essay competition and a student conference about the same encyclical this spring. 
As for future plans, Jenkins said he will "certainly be teaching more classes," but it is just a question of finding time in his busy schedule. 
"It will be a juggling of the various demands of my time ... to find a way to teach," he said. 
Jenkins will be making another effort to carve out time from his busy schedule this semester by offering open office hours to "any undergraduate or graduate student who is interested," said Frances Shavers, the executive assistant to the president. 
"One of the great joys of when he was teaching was

Record numbers to flock to ND Career Fair 
Employers, recruiters plan to attract career-seeking students 
By EVA BINDA 
News Writer 
Many seniors believe they have a chance to squelch pre-graduation jitters today by attending the Winter Career Fair. 
Representatives from over 100 employers representing more than 18 industries will flood the Joyce Center from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. intending to recruit Notre Dame students. 
Career Center Associate Director Anita Rees said the fair, which she organized, is "one of the largest and most diverse career events in the history of Notre Dame." 
The Career Fair will be preceded by a Diversity Reception from noon to 2 p.m. in the Monogram Room of the Joyce Center -an event intended to allow students to introduce themselves to employers. 
"The Diversity Reception provides an oppor­tunity to more casually talk to employers and make an initial connection with the employer when they see them at the fair," said Latonia Ferguson, Career Center counselor and

Underclassmen look for summer alternatives, pre-professional work 
By EVA BINDA 
News Writer 

Instead of relaxing on the beach this summer, many Notre Dame students will suit up to work in corporate offices as interns, testing out careers and establishing contacts in the busi­ness world before they graduate. Today's Winter Career Fair will open the door to many students to network with potential employers and explore internship possibilities. 
Career Center counselor Latonia Ferguson, the organizer of the Diversity Reception -a prelude to the Career Fair -invited all stu­dents to the fair to talk to potential employers, including those who may feel unsure of their majors and future career paths. 
It may be difficult for freshmen to get intern­ships as oftentimes employers are more inter­ested in hiring upperclassmen, she said. However, Ferguson still encouraged freshmen to start the process early to establish the con­tacts they'll eventually need in the internship search process that awaits in their sophomore

Students shed clothes to benefit hoiTieless

News Writer 
As temperatures plunge it becomes exceedingly rare to see a student sporting sandals, but onlookers should not be surprised to see sophomore Robbie Bernardin sprinting across campus in shorts and flip-flops today. 
Bernardin will be joined by fellow Siegfried residents, including Hall president junior Tom Martin, in their parade against the harsh elements as part of the first annual Day of Man -an effort of solidarity intended to raise awareness of those who cannot afford a winter coat. 
"[Bernardin] was doing a jog around campus wearing his shorts and a T-shirt and he said, 'Hey, it's cold out, but I feel pretty manly,"' Martin said. 
It wasn't long before Martin transformed his idea into an effort to aid those in need.

Rohan Anand 

India is so intrigu­ing, not because the society is exot­News Wire ic, but actually Editor chaotic. And I love it. 
You can watch Bend-It Like­Beckham or feast on Indian Cuisine to get a vicariously second-hand experi­ence of what Indian culture is some­what like. But I, a first-generation Indian-American citizen, cannot deny myself the pleasure of visiting the motherland only to return with humor­ous anecdotes to share with my American friends. 
So my Christmas break entailed a three-week vacation to New Delhi, the hometown of my parents and extended family. I braced myself for the culture shocks that would inevitably occur. 
The havoc commenced at Chicago's O'Hare airport. Indians are notoriously impatient, particularly in the context of travel. At 8:45, the expected depar­ture time of our Air India flight, the gate agfmt was nowhere to be seen. A throng of Indian passengers had already lined up to board. When one employee nonchalantly appeared and called one passenger to reconfirm their seat, all 400 passengers stood up in anticipation. Upon hearin.g that the flight wasn't ready to board yet, uproar ensued amongst passengers. What a zoo. 
Exiting the arrivals lounge at Delhi Airport some 24-nebulous hours later, I searched for my driver to retrieve me, and the first sight that caught my eye was a man publicly urinating out­side the terminal. Lovely. On the free­way to my relative's home, a bus had broken down, and all the male passen­gers had been ordered to push it to the nearest gas station. Classic. 
Sleeping off jet lag at the house, I awoke to an explosion resonating in the street. I panicked, fearing that the India-Pakistan tension had reached the brink, until I realized it was just a car wreck. Relief. 
My Indian family didn't fail to enter­tain me either. My grandfather greeted me by asking, "so, how's the sex life?" Can you say awkward? And just how feeble were my cousins' attempts to sing "Smack That" by Akon or imitate Borat? Comical. 
Still, nothing beat "the massage" that my uncle treated me to. I envisioned beautiful Indian women soothing my aching muscles from my long journey. To my unpleasant surprise, I instead received a full-body b 
eat-down from a short Indian man. Not memorable. 
When I left Delhi, I longed for red meat, hot showers, and a little person­al space. But not without a bit of grace: it's true that my heritage adds dimension to my life. I'll admit the say­ing, "you can take the dude out of India, but you can't take India out of the dude," applies to me especially.

Man, dog travel on riding mower 
GARDEN CITY, Utah ­Joined by his dog Yoda, Paul Woods travels by day and sleeps in a tent at night. His vehicle: a riding mower. "You've got to be pretty strange and pretty weird to be driving a trac­tor mower across country," Woods, 44, said. 
The Herald Journal of Logan caught up with Woods in the parking lot of Beaver Mountain ski resort, 107 miles north of Salt Lake City, near the Idaho border. 
Woods' ultimate destina­tion is Virginia, where he claims his late mother left him a house. He said he took care of her in Alaska until her death. 
Woods said he left Alaska in 2005 and has been riding his mower or getting rides from sympathetic pickup drivers who hoist his vehi­cle in the back of the truck. 
The mower's maximum speed is 15 mph, but it's weighted down by tools, snacks and the dog.

Driehaus avvarded to Robertson 
Special to The Observer 
Jaquelin T. Robertson, a New York-based architect and urban planner whose work is found worldwide, has been named the recipi­ent of the Notre Dame's fifth annual Richard H. Driehaus Prize for Classical Architecture. He will receive $100,000 and a model of the choregic Monument of Lysikrates in Athens during ceremonies March 31 in Chicago. 
A partner in the firm Cooper, Robertson & Partners, Robertson founded the New York City Urban Design Group. He served under former New York City Mayor John Lindsay as director of the Mayor's Office of Midtown Planning and Development and worked as a New York City planning commissioner. In 1975, he directed the design of Iran's new capital center, Shahestan Pahlavi. 
Committed to introducing "human values into urban plans," Robertson founded 
the Jeffersonian Restoration Advisory Board and the Mayor's Institute on City Design. He has been a con­sultant to the Ford Foundation, the government of Jamaica, the Federal Highway Administration, and the National Capitol Development Commission in Canberra, Australia. 
To "learn more about the DNA of American architec­ture," Robertson accepted an appointment as dean and a chaired professor of archi­tecture at the University of Virginia in 1980, a position he held for eight years. 
Robertson has received numerous design awards, including the 1998 Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal in Architecture and the 2002 Seaside Prize for his contri­butions to American urban­ism. A Richmond, Va., native, Robertson earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from Yale University and was a Rhodes Scholar at Magdalen College, Oxford. 
Edward Perry Bass, presi­dent of Fine Line Inc., a pri­vate diversified investment and venture capital firm in Fort Worth, Texas, will receive the $25,000 Henry Hope Reed Award in associa­tion with the Driehaus Prize. Bass is recognized as a leader in one of the most successful urban revitaliza­tion efforts in the nation. He and his family developed Sundance Square into a suc­cessful mixed-use urban core in Forth Worth. As chairman of Performing Arts Fort Worth, Bass led the development of the Nancy Lee and Perry R. Bass Performance Hall, which opened in 1998 to interna­tional acclaim. 

Richard H. Driehaus, the founder and chairman of 

Driehaus  Capital  
Management  in  Chicago,

through the Notre Dame School of Architecture because of its reputation as a national leader in incorpo­rating the principles of tra­ditional and classical archi­tecture into the task of mod­ern urban development.

The Diversity Heception and Career Fair will gather a vari­ety of employers ranging from PriceWaterhouseCoopers to Abercrombie & Fitch to the Central Intelligence Agency. 
"This fair is so diverse that I don't see one particular internship that all the stu­dents are applying for," Career Center Associate Director Anita Rees said. "We have a representation of at least eighteen different industries and within those industries, there are different divisions. For example, we have an energy firm that is hiring for a supply and trad­ing position." 
In addition to narrowing a wide range of employers and

industries, students will also have to decide whether to stay close to home or live in a new place. 
"It depends on the student and their situation," Ferguson said. "Some stu­dents want positions in their hometowns and others want t~) e~plore other opportuni­ties. 
For students that may even want to intern abroad, the Career Fair may be a good starting-off point. Several of the employers attending today's fair -such as Goldman Sachs and KPMG ­have international offices. 
"I want to intern away from home so I can get the experi­ence of actually working in the real world," said fresh­man Patrick Bears, a psy­chology and Italian major with plans to intern in Italy in the near future. 
Sophomore Patrick Vol! echoed Bears' enthusiasm about traveling. 
"I want to get an internship in the engineering field away from home," the mechanical engineering student said. "I've looked into interning with an international corpo­ration." 

In addition to the Career Fair, students interested in internships abroad can explore opportunities on campus through the Nanovic Institute for European Studies, the Kellogg Institute for International Studies and the Students in International Business Council. All of these organizations sponsor intern­ship opportunities around the globe. 
The Career Center also offers help to students trying to find internships through GOirish -its career online database -and various workshops and seminars throughout the semester. 
"We talk to students about what they are passionate about, what they've already explored, enjoyed," Rees said. "If it's an internship, we ask them about the kind of experiences would they like to garner while they are undergraduates. We take them from that point to learning to network, to inter­viewing to learning eti­quette."

Venezuelan president gains power 
CARACAS, Venezuela -President Hugo Chavez was granted free rein Wednesday to accelerate changes in broad areas of society by presidential decree -a move critics said propels Venezuela toward dictatorship. 
Convening in a downtown plaza in a ses­sion that resembled a political rally, law­makers unanimously gave Chavez sweeping powers to legislate by decree and impose his radical vision of a more egalitarian socialist state. 
The law gives Chavez, who is beginning a fresh six-year term, more power than he has ever had in eight years as president, and he plans to use it over the next 18 months to transform broad areas of public life, from the economy and the oil industry in particular, to "social matters" and the very structure of the state. 
Iraq implements new security plan 
BAGHDAD, Iraq -Iraq indefinitely halted all flights to and from Syria and closed a border crossing with Iran as the govern­ment prepares for a new security crack­down aimed at crushing violence in the cap­ital and surrounding regions, a member of parliament and an airport official said Wednesday. 
The airport official said flights to and from Syria would be canceled for at least two weeks and that service had been inter­rupted on Tuesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to reveal the information. 
Hassan al-Sunneid, a legislator and mem­ber of the parliament Defense and Security Committee, said the move "was in prepara­tion for the security plan. The state will decide when the flights will resume."

GHENT, W.Va. -The West Virginia state fire marshal on Wednesday retracted his statement announcing the death of a fifth person injured in a propane blast that destroyed a convenience store. 
State Fire Marshal Sterling Lewis initially said the manager of the Flat Top Little General Store had died in the explosion Tuesday that reduced the store to a pile of splintered debris and twisted metal. 
Lewis later retracted that statement, say­ing five people remained hospitalized with burns and other injuries. 
Lewis attributed the mistake to erroneous information from hospital officials. "I requested that it be confirmed at four differ­ent times, and they confirmed it each time," he said. 
Senator censured for groping page 
PIERRE, S.D. -The South Dakota Senate on Wednesday refused to expel a lawmaker accused of fondling an 18-year-old legislative page in a motel bed, but voted to censure him instead. 
Democratic Sen. Dan Sutton had admitted sharing a bed with the page last winter but denied groping him. 
The censure amounts to a public reprimand that has no effect on Sutton's legislative pow­ers. 
The motion to expel Sutton failed 14-20, and the censure vote was 32-2.

British terrorism plot foiled 
Police arrest nine suspects in alleged kidnapping attempt in Birmingham 
Associated Press 
BIRMINGHAM -Police foiled a major kidnapping plot, the first of its kind in Britain, with the arrests Wednesday of nine terror suspects who reportedly planned to torture and behead a British Muslim soldier and broadcast the killing on the Internet. 
The alleged plot, said by British media to mirror the brutal executions of foreign hostages in Iraq, was in its fmal stages and uncovered during a six-month surveil­lance operation by anti-ter­ror officers in this city of more than 1 million in the heart of England. The arrests came in a pre-dawn raid on homes and busi­nesses in several Birmingham neighbor­hoods, which were mostly Pakistani. 
"The threat from terror­ism remains very real," said Assistant Chief Constable David Shaw, who would not confinn reports from the British Broadcasting Corp .. and other media outlets that the intended victim was an army soldier to be killed in an "Iraqi-style" execution and broadcast on the Internet.

However, the Senate was informed of a new initiative at the start of the meeting when Notre Dame Millennium Development Initiative Assistant Director Tim Lyden addressed the senators to describe an upcoming program to facili­tate discussions about Notre Dame's Millennium Village Project in Uganda and development in general. 
Lyden said a student advi­sory council -made of approximately 20 students, most of whom have experi­ence in sub-Saharan Africa -will visit residence halls this semester to answer questions about the project. 
"We want these groups of students to lead discussions about economic develop­ment," Lyden said. 
The dorm discussions will take place during the last three weeks of February, he said. 
"It's very informal and it's open to any level of knowl­edge," Lyden said. 
In another effort to expand knowledge, Academic Affairs chair Jim Grace said he was exploring ways to connect students through a tutoring program. Grace said he was research­ing whether students can use insideND to post tutor­ing requests. 
Community Relations chair Josh Pasquesi announced March 2 as the date for the community summit that will take place between Notre Dame stu­dents and local college, uni­versity and city representa­tives. The summit will take place at Notre Dame Downtown, Pasquesi said. 

In another area of com­munity relations, he said he has been in contact with Mikki Dobski, director of communications and special projects for the office of the mayor of South Bend about sponsoring a freshman bus

year.  
"We  want to  make  sure

IN BRIEF 
Google triples fourth-quarter profits 
SAN FRANCISCO -Google Inc.'s fourth­
quarter profit nearly tripled amid another 
burst of breathtaking growth that enabled 
the online search leader to sprint past ana­
lyst expectations -a habit that has helped 
propel its stock price above $500. 
The Mountain View-based company said Wednesday that it earned $1.03 billion, or $3.29 per share, during the final three months of 2006. That compared with net income of $372.2 million, or $1.22 per share, at the same time in 2005. 
If not for expenses for employee stock 
compensation and gains from tax benefits, 
Google said it would have earned $3.18 per 
share. That figure easily exceeded the aver­
age analyst estimate of $2.92 per share 
among analysts surveyed by Thomson 
Financial. 
US Airways drops $9.8 bil. Delta bid 
ATLANTA -US Airways Group Inc. dropped 
its $9.8 billion hostile bid for Delta Air Lines 
Inc. on Wednesday after a key group of the 
bankrupt carrier's creditors said Delta would 
be better off emerging from Chapter 11 on its 
own. 
With the dual decisions, Atlanta-based Delta 
cleared a big hurdle in its effort to exit bank­
ruptcy by the middle of this year as a stand­
alone company. 
But it isn't out of the woods yet. Smaller cred­
itors could ultimately vote not to approve 
Delta's reorganization plan, and some have 
already filed objections to the disclosure state­
ment to the Delta plan. · 
A Feb. 7 hearing in bankruptcy court in New ·York is scheduled to discuss the disclosure 
statement. If the statement related to Delta's 
operations is approved, Delta could begin solic­
iting votes for approval of its reorganization 
plan. Delta hopes to hold a confirmation hear­
ing on its plan in April. 
US Airways disclosed its initial hostile bid for 
Delta on Nov. 15. US Airways later raised its bid 
by nearly 20 percent in hopes of swaying Delta's 
official committee of unsecured creditors. 
Delta's official unsecured creditors committee 
said in a statement it reached its decision after 
a lengthy review of both Delta's proposal and 
US Airways' proposal. 
I Bush visits NY stock exchange

NEW YORK-President Bush challenged corpo­rate America Wednesday on the lavish salaries and bonuses paid to chief executives, saying their pay should be tied to how much they help their companies' shareholders.

Orlando sparks trend with anti-homeless laws 
Dallas, Gainesville and Atlanta among cities with laws restricting or prohibiting the feeding of homeless 
Associated Press ORLANDO, Fla. -At Lake Eola park, there is much beau­ty to behold: robust palms, beds of cheery begonias, a cas­cading lake fountain, clusters of friendly egrets and swans, an amphitheater named in honor of Walt Disney. Then there are the signs. DO NOT LIE OR OTHERWISE BE IN A HORIZONTAL POSI­TION ON A PARK BENCH ... DO NOT SLEEP OR REMAIN IN ANY BUSHES, SHRUBS OR FOLIAGE ... per city code sec. 18A.09 (a) and (o). Visit the park's restrooms, and you'll find this sign on the · wall above the hand dryers: BATHING AND/OR SHAVING IN RESTROOM IS PROIIIBITED ... per city code 18A.09 (p) ... LAUNDERING CLOTHES IN LAKE EOLA PARK IS NOT PEH­MITTED. Since joggers and dog walk­ers tend not to snooze in flower beds, and b e c a u s e employees at the glittering 
the courts, the city tried to dis­courage aggressive beggars by obliging them to carry ID cards, and later by confining them to 3-by-15-foot "panhan­dling zones" painted in blue on sidewalks downtown. 
Despite these laws, the num­ber of people living on the streets of the Orlando metro area swelled, from roughly 5,000 in 1999 to an estimated 8,500 today, dwarfing the city's shelter capacity for 2,000 peo­ple. 
So in July, the city commis­sion tried a "supply-side" approach: It passed an ordi­nance regulating the -feeding of large groups of people in Orlando's downtown parks. 
Those who wished to feed more than 25 hungry individu­als at parks within a 2-mile radius of City Hall could do so, but only if they obtained a "Large Group Feeding Permit" from the parks department ­

"They're talking to us, to the homeless," says Vargas, 28, who says she has lived on the streets, in parks or under over­passes, since age 16. "It's a way of saying, 'Your kind isn't wanted in our city."' 
Orlando, population 200,000, works hard to conjure the image of a true-life Pleasantville: a safe, welcom­ing place where visitors can soak up year-round sunshine and devour choreographed experiences at palm-ringed theme parks. But its spotless sidewalks, sparkling lakes and twinkling skyline belie a real city with real maladies -most notably,_a surging homeless population that authorities are struggling to control.

"It's now illegal to feed the homeless in Orlando, Florida," Jay Leno, host of NBC's "Tonight Show," told a studio audience last summer in Burbank, Calif., during his opening monologue. "Have you seen the fat people walking around Disney World? We should make it illegal to feed THEM." 
But when the Orlando Sentinel posted Leno's wise­crack on its Web site, local bloggers weren't laughing. 
"Feeding the homeless only encourages more homeless­ness," one resident, with the moniker "Justin Credible," wrote. He then summed up his argument in an equation. "Less­Homeless Less Problems Better Place to Live." 
Another, "TG," didn't oppose feeding the destitute. "But there are places set up for this. Soup kitchens exist ... It is not unreasonable to want to keep Lake Eola Park from becoming a homeless cafeteria." 
William Beem added: "For what it's worth, Las Vegas enacted a similar law at the same time as Orlando. Tourist towns think alike." 
Indeed, a week before Orlando's ordinaneP . took effect, Las Vegas criminalized giving food to even a single 
transient in a city park. 
In August, the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit chal­lenging the Las Vegas ban, say­ing it violated constitutional protections of free speech, right to assembly and right to practice one's religion. A fed­eral court in Nevada has pro­hibited the city from enforcing the ordinance until a final rul­ing is issued. 
Advocates for the homeless feared it wouldn't be long before other cities passed simi­lar laws. As it happens, they were right. 

Already, the cities of Dallas, Fort Myers, Fla., Gainesville, Fla., Wilmington, N.C., Atlanta, and Santa Monica, Calif., have laws restricting or outright prohibiting the feeding of the homeless. In Fairfax County, Va., homemade meals and meals made in church kitchens may not be distributed to the homeless unless first approved by the county. 
Other cities, inducting Miami, are considering similar anti­feeding measures.

ITALY 
Berlusconi pleads for his W"ife's forgiveness 
Associated Press 
ROME -Former Premier Silvio Berlusconi, challenged in an open letter by his wife over !1irtatious comments he report­edly made to other women, pub­licly apologized to her Wednesday, saying he never meant to hurt her dignity. 
"Forgive me, I beg you. And take this public show of my pri­vate pride giving in to your fury as an act of love. One of many," said the letter from Berlusconi released by his Forza Italia party. 
"Your dignity has nothing to do with it. I treasure it as a precious good in my heart, even when I make carefree jokes," said Berlusconi, 70. 
His wife, Veronica Lario, wrote an open letter published Wednesday in La Repubblica -a left-leaning daily and a fierce opponent of Berlusconi -to voice her complaints over what she said was behavior that dam­aged her dignity as a woman. 
"If I weren't married, I would marry you immediately," Berlusconi told one woman at a VIP party after a TV awards cer­emony broadcast by one of his channels, according to reports widely carried in the Italian press. 
He reportedly told another, "With you, I'd go anywhere." 
The famously private Lario wrote in the open letter: "I see these statements as damaging my dignity." 
"To both my husband and the public man, I therefore demand a public apology, since I haven't received any privately," she wrote. "I have faced the inevitable contrasts and the more painful moments that a long con­jugal relation entails with respect and discretion." 
Lario, 50, saying her husband's comments were "unacceptable" and could not be reduced to mere jokes. 
Berlusconi, who has boasted of his success with women in his youth and says he has a sense of gallantry, has a reputation for making comments that some women fmd inappropriate. 
In a separate interview, Berlusconi said his wife is a "spe­cial woman." 
"Veronica has been an absolute passion; when we met, she made me lose my mind," he told the women's magazine A, which released excerpts of the inter­view Wednesday. 
"She has been and is a wonder­ful mother. She has never embar­rassed me, never," Berlusconi said. "And she is so lenient..·.. What more could I want?" 
Lario largely kept out of the public eye during Berlusconi's five-year premiership, which ended with the defeat of his con­servative coalition in April elec­tions. 
But she occasionally expressed positions that were not in line with her husband's, such as defending pacifists protesting the war in Iraq, which Berlusconi supported. 
Berlusconi and Lario were married in 1990, but had been together for a decade before then. A former actress, she is Berlusconi's second wife. The two are rarely seen together. 
Simon follows father's path 
Councilwoman carries former senator's legacy into mayoral run 
Associated Press 
CARBONDALE, Ill. -Sheila Simon has come a long way since her first speech at a political picnic. 
"Thanks for the hot dogs," she recalls muttering as a teen after being prompted to say a few words by her father, popu­lar U.S. senator and former

Medical costs result in taxable deductions 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -What do doctors' visits, Navajo healing ceremonies and clarinet les­sons have in common? All can qualify, under the right cir­cumstances, as tax-deductible medical expenses. 
It's not that easy to take the deduction -medical expenses must exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income before they can be deducted. On the other hand, taxpayers can cast a wide net to reach that threshold, so it may be easier than you think. 
Costs for elastic hosiery, see­ing-eye dogs, stop-smoking and weight-loss programs, lead paint removal, special mattresses for relief of arthri­tis or spine problems, reclin­ing chairs prescribed by a doc­tor -all have been permitted by either the Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Tax Court, where tax disputes are heard. 
"If it was prescribed for a medical purpose or to alleviate a condition, you have a good chance of getting it through," said Donna LeValley, a tax attorney and contributing edi­tor of the J.K. Lasser tax pub­lications. 
The key is whether the expense involves the diagno­sis, cure, treatment or preven­tion of a disease or health con­dition for you, a spouse or a dependent. 

Don't stretch it too far. Health clubs, therapeutic dance lessons, marriage coun­seling, tattooing, sex-change operations and diaper services don't qualify as medical expenses. Costs of divorce, even if recommended by a psy­chiatrist, don't qualify; neither does a hotel room used for sex therapy. 
Also not deductible: funeral and burial expenses, tooth­paste, toiletries, cosmetics and most cosmetic surgery, unless necessary to improve a disfig­urement from disease, birth or accidental injury. 
Still, legitimate expenses do add up. They can include air conditioners for relief of aller­gies or breathing problems, hearing aids, eyeglasses, con­tact lenses, Braille books, adapters for closed-caption service for the deaf, orthope­dic shoes, crutches, wheel­chairs, wigs for those who've lost hair through disease, and legal fees for guardianship of a mentally ill spouse. 
Deducting clarinet lessons was permitted because a den­tist recommended them for treatment of tooth defects, LeValley noted. 
"You can see how that might be a little iffy, but it made sense once you see what the dentist was trying to achieve," she said.

Detns push budget toward vote 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON--Democrats say they are making the best of a bad situation as they bring to the House floor a massive bill cobbling together $463.5 billion in unfin­ished budget business. 
The bill, combining the budgets of 13 Cabinet agencies, won praise Tuesday from Democratic Party allies such as activists pressing the fight against AIDS overseas and advocates for boosting education funding. 
Lawmakers in both parties hailed the bill for freeing highway construction funds, even as the White House complained that the bill will slow aid to communities harmed by a 2005 round of mili­tary base closings and cut a request for basic scientific research. 
Still, the White House signaled that President Bush would sign the bill into law once it reaches his desk. 
The House debate on Wednesday promises to be bitter, and the measure appears likely to pass on a largely party-line vote. But Republicans in the Senate appear unlikely to place procedur­al hurdles in its path. 
The harshest criticism came from House Republicans, who complained that they were shut out of any chance to offer changes to the bill _ and had barely any time to read it. 
Rep. Jerry" Lewis of California, the Appropriations Committee's top Republican --displaced as chairman last fall --ripped into the Democrats for rushing the bill to the House floor "without any prior debate whatsoever and with­out the opportunity to offer even one amendment on the floor." 
Republicans also took issue with Democrats' claim to have "scrubbed" the bill free of homes­tate projects. They pointed to, for example, $50 million to match last year's funding for the Denali Commission, which funds rural road, sanitation, energy and other infrastructure projects in Alaska. Then there was the Senate's refusal to kill $45 million in fund­ing for an indoor rainforest project in central Iowa, even though local backers have yet to come up with their required share of funding. 
Democrats sought to focus attention of numerous --albeit generally small -funding increases they managed to provide in favored accounts, even while living within tight limits set by Bush and last year's GOP-domi­nated Congress. 
The powerful veterans lobby won a $3.6 billion increase for medical care, earning praise from veterans groups and the White House, while low-income college students would receive a $260 boost in the maximum Pell Grant, to $4,310. 
"After five years of broken promises from the admini'itration, this is an important down pay­ment by Democrats on our com­mitment to help families with high college costs," said Sen. Edward 
M. Kennedy, D-Mass. 
State and local law enforcement agencies, meanwhile, won increases in grants for new equip­ment and hiring new officers. 
Community development block grants, however, were frozen at current levels, as was Amtrak. But advocates for those programs took them as a victory relative to Bush's budget submitted a year ago. 
Activists pressing for big boosts to combat AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis overseas won a $1.3 billion increase -to $4.5 billion. That's enough to fund the presi­dent's $225 million initiative to fight malaria and increase the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to $724 million.

Solar home plays host to Va. senator 
Eco-friendly home designed, built by students 
Associated Press 
RICHMOND, Va. -State Sen. Frank Wagner is staying warm at his temporary address, even in below-freezing weather and without a traditional power supply or fireplace. 
The Virginia Beach Republican, a proponent of alternative energy sources, is living for a week outside the Science Muselllfl of VIrginia in a solar-powered house designed and built by Virginia Tech students. He moved in Wednesday. 
Using a remote control and a computer, Wagner is testing whether the award-winning home can generate enough electricity from the sun to run everyday home appliances _ and still have enough left over to send to Richmond's power grid or charge an electric car. 
"The house is designed to be self-sufficient, but there's a lot of things that could be adapted into existing houses today," he said Friday, after spending his second almost glitch-free night in the 800 square-foot home. 
The house is warmed by heat that comes up through the floor, and has a rainwater har­vesting system and automated mood lighting. It also features a wide-screen TV and kitchen appliances chosen for their energy efficiency. 

These features can be manipulated while sitting on a couch and tapping on a tablet computer connected to the building's control system. All of it is powered by the sun's ener­gy, which is gathered by rooftop photovoltaic panels and stored in the home's battery system. 
"We want to show that you don't have to huddle around candles and be dressed in all your clothes to be comfortable in a house powered by solar energy," said Robert Schubert, associate dean of research for the College of Architecture and Urban Studies at VIrginia Tech. 
It's a ladies game too: Football faithful not solely male 
Associated Press 
MIAMI Super Bowl Sunday, once the manliest of annual celebrations, is get­ting a shot of estrogen. 
Sports-savvy ladies are brushing up on their football lingo and planning couples activities to reconnect with their men, while other game widows will revel in a night of freedom. 
"For single people, this has gotten as big as, 'Do I have a date for New Year's Eve?' There is hardly a soul that doesn't say what are you doing for the Super Bowl," sports lecturer Paula Duffy said. 
The author of an audio 
book series, which includes the "Woman's Guide To Football," Duffy says her Long Beach, Calif.-based business is swamped once the playoffs start. She trav­els the country speaking at Tupperware parties, hold­ing seminars at The Learning Annex, appear­ing on radio shows and 
"Sports and entertainment have blended. Coaches like Phil Jackson are rock stars. There's red carpet events. It's Access Hollywood meets ESPN, and it's a genuine topic of gossip." 
Paula Duffy sports lecturer 

even teaching private lessons, which cost upward of $250. 
Duffy demystifies the rules of the game for clients, a mix of single and married gals and business ladies looking to connect with their colleagues, with graphics and cheat sheets. 
"Sports and entertainment have blended. Coaches like Phil Jackson are rock stars. There's red carpet events," Duffy said of the glamour sur­rounding sports. "It's Access Hollywood meets ESPN, and it's a genuine topic of gossip." 
And a great way for single women to snag a guy, said Duffy, who estimates about 60 percent of her clients fall into that category. 
Several professional and college football teams are also giving women the play by play. The Buffalo Bills host NFL 101 during preseason camp, which includes lessons on how to catch and throw and a tour of the locker room. 
Jan Wannstedt, wife of University of Pittsburgh's coach Dave Wannstedt, leads Football University, a one­night introductory class for women. The Cincinnati Bengals and the Green Bay Packers also hold Football 
101, where attendance is in the hundreds. 
Gwen Arafiles, 23, was one of 600 women who attended the University of California at Berkeley's women's football huddle led by head coach Jeff Tedford last August. 
"It was defi­nitely fun. They had us practice kicking field goals from five different spots 
on the field," said Arafiles, a public relations executive from Berkley. "Afterward, I could say this is what a safety does. I can understand how a running back gets stripped of the ball." 
But what about the women who don't care as much about the game, but still want the camaraderie? 
Christine Cheng hosts a couples football and cooking party and hires a gourmet tailgating chef. The ladies learn to make mini Kobe beef burgers, salmon quesadillas, homemade sweet potato fries 
and crab cakes which they later serve the boys. 
A Brooklyn spa is looking to keep the sparks flying long after the coin toss with four plasma screen TVs, food and a full bar for the men and chocolate massages and facials to entertain the ladies. When the game is over, cou­ples can reunite in Body by Brooklyn's thermal hot tub or Turkish steam room. 
Then there are the gals who are happy to thumb their nose at football's most sacred day. Seattle restaurant The Pink Door is throwing a "Superbelle event" in their honor, which includes a man­

icurist, Tarot card reader, trapeze artist and chick flicks. 
DIYNetwork.com is plan­ning a marathon airing "Knitty Gritty" and encourag­ing knitters to trade tips over the Internet as they make shawls and blankets for char­ity.

OBSERVERONLINE 

When Dean Kamen unveiled his Segway Personal Transporter in December 2001, much of the grandiose hype and bloated expectations surround­ing the invention focused on how the new device would revolu­tionize the way mod­ern cities are built. Pretty lofty goal, sure, but no one accuses Kamen of downplaying his work. When the device was ollicially unveiled, people dis­covered that it was a motorized scooter. A pretty sweet scooter that can balance itself, true, but still ... a scooter. 
The Segway is a really nifty device, true. It's fast, dean, easy to charge and use, and it almost erases pollution when compared to a car. For the average American city-dweller, the machine really serves all your daily needs, provided it can reach the workplace and nearby stores. But Kamen's ballyhooed invention underestimates the sterling and durable method of transportation that humankind has possessed ever since evolution propped us upright: walking. 
The human gait is a fine thing when you think about it. You just push your legs forward and go, one foot in front of the other. As the steps add up, feet turn into yards, yards into miles, and miles into ... many miles. There are no emissions besides your exhaling breath, and none of the noise that clogs up otherwise serene cities. The footprint of the average human person is decidedly less than an automo­bile, and even the Segway can't best a person for space-savings. The speed may not be quite as great as a Segway or car, but it gets the job done. The energy sup­ply lasts a lot longer than a charge on 

James Dechant 
Foregone Conclusion 
Kamen's brainchild, and fuel is remark­ably cheaper than what Ford's offspring demands (even if you prefer.line dining). All those years of planning and inventing, and here the whole time we've been sit­ting-or standing-on the most effi­eient vehicle of all. Until our descendants colonize the moon and start scooting around in hover cars, it's the best means of travel we've got. 
Kamen's vision did bring to mind a regrettable aspect of modern life: we design our cities and neighborhoods around transportation, and that trans­portation is always a car. Older cities were built with narrower streets, where buildings hunched closer together, and they gave you an easier walking experi­ence. In our time, however, everything modern is subject to where a car can go. This means our more state-of-the-art dties possess a great deal of convenience lor us, but that convenience comes at a price. Cars are the de facto method of traveling, even within cities and suburbs, and we're left with little choice. Just think about getting around in South Bend and Mishawaka. Walking around campus or dose to it does not trouble us, but try walking to Meijer and carrying back your purchases. Sure, you can do it, but it's a pain. 
That pain, however, may be worth it. Living in a city may not provide the healthiest lifestyle in many aspects, but it beats suburban sprawl when it comes to weight and daily exercise. A national study published in American Journal of Preventative Medicine last December found that teenagers who grow up in sub­urban neighborhoods walk far less in their daily routines -relying instead on a car to get to and from school, work and friends' houses-and therefore are far more prone to obesity. They are, in fact, more than twice as likely to be over­weight when compared to city teenagers. 
I'm studying in Rome this semester, and as my first long-term city living situation, it has definitely changed my habit<>. When you're here, it's true, there's a whole lot of walking to do. Just going from our resi­dence to school and back and nowhere else probably adds up to four or five miles every day. The plight of suburban dwellers seems much more credible to me, because I now understand how little walking I used to do. Once you get used to walking everywhere, though, the conven­ience of it really becomes apparent. You're mobile, independent and environ­mentally-friendly. 

Most European cities are built on the same premise -they existed long before cars, and the largest thing the streets had to accommodate was an occasional horse and carriage. Here, walking is your best option for getting around. Modern cities have tons of advantages-better city plumbing and waste disposal, more suit­able land, ~asier transportation of goods -but they force you to hop in your car whenever you need a carton of milk or a loaf of bread. 
Fighting our handicapping modern city design isn't an easy task. Residential areas don't spring up overnight, so we can't expect our neighborhoods to change their layout that quickly. We can, howev­er, choose to walk to the store or work whenever we can. In the process, you can save energy, get a workout, create less noise and just enjoy your town. 
You could buy a Segway, but why waste the money? Use what you already have, and try walking. Your grandchildren liv­ing in redesigned moon-cities may thank you one day.

Live in the moment 
Guess how many school days remain until the end of the semester. Any ideas? The correct answer is, of course, "It depends on how you count." Some possi­bilities include 108 days until commencement for those of you who are seniors; 99 calendar days until the end of exams; 62 actual class days, a number which you, having Kate gained acceptance to Notre Dame, Barrett should be able to break down even 
FaithPoint

further into your own personal tal­lies for your M-W-F and T-Th class­es. 
Now, though you may have a particular course which cannot come to an end quickly enough (hmmm, what a bummer if you already have this attitude on the first of February), hopefully you are not eagerly, anxiously, foot-tappingly, finger-drumm­ingly awaiting the end of the semester. I mean, what's not to like? You have access to the best pro­fessors; a wide selection of good and plentiful food (which you must do nothing more than carry a tray around the dining hall to receive ... just wait till you have to cook it yourself!); beautiful churches and chapels where you can pray and attend Mass about 458 times a week; free NOMAD wireless almost everywhere on campus; the use of fitness facilities you'd pay big bucks for in the "real world;" opportu­nities to attend retreats, spring break service proj­ects and world-renowned music and theater presen­tations. This is a pretty good life. Rather than rush­ing ahead to whatever's next, it seems reasonable to live it with gratitude. 
Unfortunately, circumstances seem to conspire to make "an attitude of gratitude" difficult. We face dis­appointments in love, academics or employment; we worry about ailing family members far away. Perhaps underlying all these others, we worry about the future. The obligation to choose a major, figure out a career, obtain summer jobs -or for those of you facing commencement, real jobs -weighs heav­ily on our minds. 
From beautiful and classic prayers by saints and holy men and women to the scores of self-help books on the Amazon or Barnes & Noble Web sites you can find endless suggestions, from profound to insipid, for how to "Jive in the now." How about just living each day with gratitude? Why not try to find some­thing to be grateful for each and every day-some­thing about being here, now, for which you give thanks? If you're a senior looking forward to Commencement (in 108 days), perhaps you especially will want to try the "daily gratitude" plan. For exam­ple, one of your classmates has returned to campus this semester after battling cancer and looks forward to graduating in May, cancer-free. That seems to me to be worth a big heap of gratitude. 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Border patrol is not what We need 
This is a country that has a love-hate relationship with its immi­grants. We love when they build our homes, pick our fruit, land­scape our suburbs or clean our kitchens. But we hate when they've earned a place in the suburbs, when their kids "steal" our kids' spot at the university or even, perhaps, when their daughter marries our son. 
In defending the Minuteman Project, Geoff Spiess made some hasty speculation about the group's vigilante behavior ("'Bigot" an unfairly applied term, Jan. 29). In their Web site, the group is frank, explaining that the "nation is [being] devoured and plundered by the menace of tens of millions of invading illegal aliens." They describe how "future generations will inherit a tangle of rancorous, unassim­ilated, squabbling cultures with no common bond to hold them together, and a certain guarantee of the death of this nation as a harmonious 'melting pot.'" These lines reveal that the Minuteman Project is not simply concerned with illegal immigration, but ALL immigration. After all-"legal" immigrants are just as likely to ruin the "harmonious melting pot" as illegal ones. An immigrant is an immigrant-differentiating some as legal will not create harmony. 
Spiess also posits a mistaken notion that better protection along the U.S.-Mexican border equals better protection from terrorism. In The Wall Street Journal, Daniel Griswold explains that "before Sept. 11, the government had stationed more than four times as many border enforcement agents on the Mexican border as along the Canadian one, even though the Canadian border is more than twice as long and has been the preferred border of entry for Middle Easterners trying to enter the United States illegally." Thus, ifthe United States wants results in its war on terror, it should build a more efficient and fair system of immigration, not fences. The cur­rent regulations make legal immigration impossible for millions worldwide trapped in extreme poverty -not coincidentally, the same group willing to accept the jobs that the average American worker does not. 
Lastly, for those who decry the "burden" that illegal immigrants place upon social services-immigrants pay taxes too! Legal immi­grants or not, they pay sales taxes when they shop, they pay proper­ty taxes when they buy homes and they pay income taxes when they work. 
Catholic Social Teaching principles can also contextualize immi­grant use of social services. The principle of Option for the Poor and Vulnerable encourages Catholics to place the needs of the poor and vulnerable ahead of economic concerns. The principle of Solidarity urges Catholics to promote justice through the recognition that all belong to one human family, regardless of race, class or even citi­zenship. And the principle of Participation reminds Catholics that all persons have the right to access those institutions necessary for their human fulfillment. 
The issue of illegal immigration will not be resolved until the U.S. accepts responsibility for its intermeddling political actions through­out the world. It will require future leaders to fight global conditions of extreme poverty that are creating millions of immigrants. Are we up to that challenge, Notre Dame? 
Michelle Munoz senior off-campus Jan. 30 
We may create countdowns or spend all our time waiting for the future to happen out of worry or anx­iety. We may also do it because we've just come to take our present situation for granted. If you feel like you've used up all Notre Dame has to otTer, then it's time to make a new friend; go to a Mass or -prayer service you've never been to before; make a retreat (see below!); attend a lecture or concert you never thought you'd try; or best of all, find some small, new way to give something back to this com­munity. 
If you're one of those seniors counting down the 108 days until commencement, consider tossing your countdown in the trash-unless, of course, you're using it to find "108 Ways to be Grateful During My Last Semester Here." Additionally, how about going on the senior retreat this weekend (Feb. 2 and 3; see campusministry.nd.edu)? It starts tomorrow but you can still sign up -and no one will make fun of you for having no previous plans for the weekend. Hey, you're living in the now!

Support the team let 'the box' live 
College sports' fans stand out from the crowd, so to speak, in their passion for the team and willingness to travel great distances in support of that team, and consume their lives knowing the high school stats of a junior tailback in North Dakota, who may or may not go to their school someday. And if you look around in the students' section of most college games, you can see spectators dressed extravagantly and borderline loony. The lep­rechaun isn't the only mascot that Notre Dame basketball has. Many have seen him, but few understand the simple brilliance until getting a closer look. Right in front of Notre Dame's biggest games this season has been "the box." That blob of white down in the first row next to the center aisle is not a marshmallow but one crazy fan. 
Willing to camp out sometimes 12 hours before game time for the coveted seat, "the box" garners a bad rap from the security staff worried about the younger audience. (Mind you, "the box" is short for the Halloween costume "box of wine" which comes complete with a spigot.) They fear that small children will think of the spigot as a phallic symbol. And although it is important to protect our children, honestly, how many kids are old enough to know what it symbolizes, but young enough to still be offended? With the cos­tume turned inside out, people only see a foam blob or as one ESPN commentator recently called him, "the bubble boy." 
"The box" must be set free and allowed to be worn in good harmless fun. There are three Irish home games remaining and in order to keep the streak alive and keep the Leprechaun Legion as great as it is, let the box live.

DVD REVIEWS 
Jaa's 'Protector' ruined by Americanization 
ByTAEANDREWS Assistanr Scene Editor 
Tony Jaa burst onto the scene with 2003's "Ong Bak," an instant classic that f1ew at audiences like an elbow strike to the face and cemented his sta­tus as a bona fide martial arts super­star. Utilizing vicious elbow and knee strikes in the Muay Thai martial art style, Jaa dispatched onscreen enemies with panache and flair reminiscent of (dare we say it) the late and great Bruce Lee, the greatest kung fu movie star of all time. Along the way, he even managed to make the movie title a verb in the popular slang, as in, "Oh man, he just got Ong Bak'd right in the face!" 
Jaa is like a real-life version of "The Matrix," performing impossible flips, somersaults and aerial acrobatics, usu­ally ending with one bad guy or anoth­er receiving massive punishment to the face from one of Jaa's many limbs and joints. Throwin' 'bows in the distinctive Muy Thai style, the sheer creativity of Jaa as a martial artist matches pretty much anything Quentin Tarantino could dream up short of Pai Mei's Five-Point Exploding Heart Technique. 
The high-flying Thailander is like the 

The Protector 
Two-Disc Collector's Edition

~~1~r 


Tazmanian devil, a whirling dervish of fists, feet, elbows and knees unleashed upon enemies everywhere. And the best part of all is that Jaa is the real deal. As the DVD proudly proclaims, Tony Jaa has "no stunt doubles, no wires, no CGI." In other words, what you see is what you get. 
Normally, watching Jaa in action is a kick in the pants, or more aecurately, a flying knee strike to the dome. So natu­rally, Jaa's next movie should have been as sure of a thing as one of his signature monster elbows to the face, right? 
Wrong. Enter "The Protector," one of the worst put-together movies of all time. Somewhere, Bruce Lee is doing backflips in his grave after the release of this sloppy jalopy.

Unfortunately, the various clowns at the Weinstein Company headquarters decided to cut a different version of the film for its release in the U.S. 
Perhaps the studio was trying to sim­plify the film for American audiences, but ironically enough, the plot is very standard fare. Jaa reprises his role from "Ong Bak" as a Thai country boy done good. This time around, he tlnds 
himself risking life and splicPd togethPr by a glue stick­eating first grader with construction paper, chewing gum and Scotch tape. The editing is just awful -it's choppy, devoid of any coherent structure and makes the plot impossible to follow. "The Protector" skips from fight scene to chase sequence back to fight scene regardless of plot. 

Amazingly, the fight scenes remain breathtaking, with audiences sure to ooh and ahh at Jaa's many insane moves. Jaa still sizzles and dazzles, delivering a scintillating performance almost in spite of the atrocious editing. 
Throughout its confusing and distort­ed narrative, the film even manages to jump between dubbing and subtitles seemingly at whim, which is just adding insult to injury. Even for a 111m genre known for its cheesy dialogue and worse acting, "The Protector" manages to disappoint at every turn. 

The sole redeeming feature of the DVD set is that the generous folks at Dragon Dynasty DVD decided to add a second disc of the original film, "Tom Yum Goong." 
Although there is plenty of Tony Jaa inflieting his typical pain on heads, shoulders, knees and toes, all that bone-breaking and name-taking is ulti­mately wasted, as not even the talented Mr. Jaa can save "The Protector."

For those college students socially adept enough to have never picked up a comic book in their lives, Iron Man doesn't carry the same superhero name recognition as a Batman or a Spider-Man. As such, most undergraduates may be unaware that Marvel recently released "The Invincible Iron Man." a reboot of the Iron Man mythos, for the faithful in the form of a straight-to-DVD animated classic. At least, that's what the goal was. 
Sadly, even Iron Man's rocket shoes can't launch this clunker of a flick off the ground. Although the DVD features pretty good animation, bad dialogue and the typ­ical convoluted plot associated with ani­mated movies put a whole lot of chinks in Iron Man's armor. 
Iron Man's alter ego is billionaire play­boy Tony Stark, the founder of Stark Enterprises, a multi-billion dollar tech company. Basically, imagine Bill Gates with game: a computer technology nerd with the suave skills of Justin Timberlake, plus a pretty sweet Fu Manchu mustache and limb in pur­suit of pachyderm protection, guard­ing a venerable line of elephants from evil poach­ers. 
Dumbed down and sped up for American audi­ences, the movie was apparently cut 
'Iron Man' falls far short of invincible namesake

another superhero re-launch movie), Lions Gate here it seems as though Iron Man's GPS navigation sys­tem went haywire and he accidentally landed himself in 'The Last Samurai." 

(granted, this is not an easy thing to imag­ine, but that's why it's based ofT a comic book). Plus, with all of his mechanized joints, Iron Man can do "The Hobot" just like JT. In fact, it seems like he's always doing "The Robot" as he elunks and clanks his way through the IND. 
After an early attack leaves him with a damaged heart, Tony Stark manages to soldier on. Despite his bum ticker, the tin man still has a heart of gold, an iron will and a steel resolve to fight crime (and evil supernatural beings). 
As these things tend to go, the plot is pretty far out there. Stark Enterprises has a project to raise arr ancient buried city in China. However, midway through the project, evil magical demons called Elementals pop up like supernatural Whack-A-Moles. Obviously, the next logi­cal step for these dark forces of nature is to try to raise the Mandarin, the evil and all-powerfulleader of an ancient dynasty. With the world in peril, a man in a robot suit is called upon to save the day. In other words, standard comic book fare as far as the plot goes. 
Although the use of Chinese mysticism is an interesting angle to take in the re­telling of the Iron 

Iron Man fans will no doubt enjoy the appearance of Tony Stark's best friend James "Hhodey" Rhodes. However, per­haps the most disappointing thing about the movie is that Tony Stark doesn't even spend the majority of time as Iron Man in his usual red and yellow get-up. No, instead he plods around in a grey bucket of bolts with a microwave oven for a hel­met. 
Unfortunately, by the time The Invincible Iron Man saddles up and reach­es its "climax," Tony Stark's palm blasters are firing blanks: the bizarre plot makes the fmal showdown somewhat less than epic. Animated classics aside, the film's bad dialogue and worse vocal perform­anees cause the whole movie to ring more hollow than an empty suit of armor. Fortunately for the diehard tin can head fans out there, this is only Marvel's first try at making an Iron Man movie. Although this first stab at the character can be considered an unqualified swing and a miss, unsatisfied fans are still better off waiting for the live action version, directed by Jon Favreau, due out some­time in 2008. 

Here's to hoping the second time is the charm.

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Barry Bonds' contract with the San Francisco Giants isn't final just yet. 
After the commissioner's office rejected Bonds' $15.8 million, one-year deal because it contained a per­sonal-appearance provision, the team sent revised docu­ments to his agent, Jeff Borris. 
"At this time, Barry is not signing the new documents," Borris said. 
Baseball's Uniform Player Contract states a player "agrees to cooperate with the club in any and all rea­sonable promotional activi­ties." Bonds' contract had additional language that the commissioner's office reject­ed. 
Borris did not detail the provisions in dispute, but a baseball executive, speaking on condition of anonymity because these details had not been made public, said they dealt with personal appearances. 
Giants executives did not immediately return tele­phone calls seeking com­ment. 
Bonds and the Giants, who agreed to financial terms Dec. 7, said Monday the drawn-out agreement had been finalized. 
Still, they disagree on the meaning of an unusual pro­vision in the deal relating to 
IN BRIEF 
CowbQYs will wait until after 
Super Bowl to name coach 
!HYING, Texas -The Dallas Cowboys won't name Bill Parcells' replacement until after the Super Bowl. 
In his first public comments since Parcells retired Jan. 22, owner and general manager Jerry Jones said Wednesday he wouldn't have a deci­sion on a new coach until next week. Jones has already interviewed eight candidates, and said he might add to that list. 
"We've got a good football team. and I've got to get this right," Jones said. "We've got to make a good decision when we select the next coach. We're going to have the opportunity and a plan in place that will allow us to do that." 
Hall of Fame linebacker Mike Singletary, the assistant head coach for the San Francisco 49ers, interviewed Tuesday. That came two days after 49ers offensive coordinator Norv Turner. 
Bonds' potential legal prob­lems. In the contract, a list of criminal a,cts is spelled out in a section. 
"Player acknowledges and agrees that an indictment for any criminal act under (that section) ... is proper grounds for termination of this con­tract," Bonds' contract states. 
The language in the con­tract was read to The Associated Press by a person with a ~opy of the agree­ment. 
"Player also acknowledges and agrees that he will not grieve, appeal or otherwise challenge any club action to terminate this contract as a result of player's indictment for any criminal acts (speci-fled) ... nor will he cause or authorize any third party, such as the Major League Baseball Players Association, to grieve, appeal or other­wise challenge any club action to terminate this con­tract as a result of player's indictment for any (specified) criminal actS." 

The Giants wanted to pro­tect themselves if Bonds is charged in the federal gov­ernment's steroids investiga­tion. Bonds' personal trainer, Greg Anderson, is in a California federal prison because he has refused to testify whether Bonds com­mitted perjury when he told a 2003 grand jury he never knowingly used perform­ance-enhancing drugs. 
Su~r Bowl air security tight, 
high-tech · 
HOMESTEAD AIR RESERVE BASE, Fla. -Pilots who stray into a no-fly zone around the Super Bowl on Sunday can count on an immediate, robust response from F -16 fighter planes, helicopters and lots of high­tech gadgetry aimed at countering any threat. 
"We'll be prepared to handle any­thing like that," said Julie Tortes, chief of the Miami office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the federal secu­rity coordinator for the Super Bowl. 
When flight restrictions are violat­ed, most of the time it's because of a communications problem or a pilot isn't aware of the rules.

qualifying spot rule CONCORD, N.C. -NASCAR changed its Nextel Cup past champions provi­sional Wednesday to limit it to only six uses per season. 
There had previously been no limit to how many times a past Cup cham­pion could use the provisional to ensure a spot in the field each week. The provisional was set aside for the 43rd spot in the race to the most recent former champion who did not qualify based on speed. 
Now, a driver can only use the spot six times in a year, and the limit also applies to the entire team so that a car owner can't use multiple past champions in the course of one sea­son. 
"As NASCAR seeks to place more emphasis on competition. we have decided the time is right to limit the number of provisionals allowed," said Hobin Pemberton, NASCAR's competition director.

OLYMPICS 
Olympic athletes will now be tested for HGH 


Sample fares From Chicago to: 
London  $273

Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO -Olympic athletes soon will have their blood tested for human growth hormone, but the NFL and base­ball officials instead are embracing the unproven con­cept of urine testing in their bid to stop use of the performance­enhancing drug. 
Critics question whether the pro leagues truly are intent on rooting out HGH, thought to be widely abused because no one currently is testing for it. But baseball and football officials say they are stymied by union contracts that prohibit taking blood from players, and they cite privacy concerns and doubts about the accuracy of blood tests. 
The two leagues recently awarded grants worth a com­bined $1 million to develop a urine test, but even the scientist who received most of the research money concedes an effective urine screen is years away, meaning players can con­tinue using HGH with little fear of getting caught. 
"It's a difficult proposition," said Don Catlin, chief of the Olympic Analytical Laboratory at UCLA. "It's going to take a while." 
This blood feud over how to root out cheaters has opened a deep schism at the highest levels of amateur and professional sports. 
The World Anti-Doping Agency plans to test the blood of elite amateur athletes by the end of this year. The agency's chief, Dick Pound, dismissed efforts by the NFL, Major League Baseball and their unions as "a piddling little amount" spent on unproven technology to combat a major problem. 
"Our view is that it's out there being used with impunity because of the lack of testing," Pound said. 
Anti-doping agencies that police amateur athletes around the globe have spent nearly $10 million over the past decade to develop a blood test to detect synthetic growth hormone. 
"All the experts we have con­sulted told us to forget about urine tests," said Olivier Rabin, the anti-doping agency's top sci­entist. "In urine you will find less than 1 percent of human growth hormone than you will find in the blood." 
Human growth hormone occurs naturally in the body and synthetic versions taken by injection are chemically identi­cal, making detection difficult. The new blood tests are designed to find higher-than­normal hormone levels that can be reached only by taking syn­thetic versions. 
Rabin said the blood test can detect the presence of synthetic growth hormone for about two days after it's injected, which requires the agency to conduct unannounced, random sam­plings. 
Some 300 athletes at the 2004 
Olympics in Athens underwent 
blood testing without a positive 
result. But Rabin says testing 
deterred human growth hor­
mone use because athletes 
knew the tests were coming. 
An NFL official, however, said that proves the tests were unre­liable. 
"Our indication is that there 
are outstanding issues with 
respect to the availability and the reliability of the blood test," league spokesman Greg Aiello said. 
Donald Fehr, head of the base­ball players' union, said: "We would have nothing to say about it until it came out and we had an opportunity to review it." 
Human growth hormone is produced in the pituitary gland, a pea-sized structure at the base of the brain that controls growth and other functions. In the mid­1980s, scientists at the biotech­nology pioneer Genentech Inc. figured out how to produce the hormone by genetically engi­neering human genes into bac­teria. 
Since then, the global market for human growth hormone has reached nearly $1 billion annu­ally with seven companies, including Eli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc. and Novartis, producing similar versions. Its uses include treating pituitary gland tumors and growth disorders in chil­dren.

Yankee Stadium to go out with All-Star salute

Associated Press 
NEW YORK Yankee Stadium is going out with an All-Star salute. 
The beloved old ballpark will host the 79th major league All­Star game on July 15, 2008, the final season before the New York Yankees move into a new stadium being built across the street in the Bronx. 
Baseball commissioner Bud Selig and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg were on hand Wednesday at City Hall for the announcement, which had been expected for months. 
"When you think of Yankee Stadium it is the most, in my opinion. famous cathedral in baseball -and I think the most famous stadium in the world," Selig said. "So we real­ly believe that this is the way we can honor a cathedral that has meant so much to this sport for so long." 
It will be the fourth All-Star game at Yankee Stadium, which opened in 1923 and underwent an extensive reno­vation in the mid-1970s. The most recent summer showcase in The House That Ruth Built was in 1977, when the National League won 7-5 for the sixth of 11 consecutive victories over the AL. 
Now, the American League has nine wins and a tie in the pqst 10 All-Star games going into this year's contest July 10 in San Francisco. The 2009 game will be played in St. Louis. 
"We're excited," Yankees general partner Steve Swindal said,; "It just seemed appropri­ate. 
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner did not attend the news conference. Swindal said The Boss had a scheduling con­flict but was feeling well in Tampa, Fla., and was working hard to get ready for spring training. 
Steinbrenner offered his com­ments in a news release from the commissioner's office. 
"It is always a great honor for a team's home stadium to ser.ve as host for the All-Star game, and the Yankees are proud and delighted to have been selected for the honor in 2008," he said. "It will be one of many historic moments in the 2008 season as we say goodbye to a great facility and look forward to our new ball­park, where the heritage of the Yankees and Major League Baseball will be extended for decades to come." 
Selig said one of the primary reasons Yankee Stadium was selected was to honor Steinbrenner for the owner's many years in baseball. Bloomberg also had kind words for The Boss. 
"I was impressed and touched by both of their com­ments about me," Steinbrenner said through spokesman Howard Rubenstein. 
Yankee Stadium also was the site of All-Star games in 1939 and 1960. All three seasons in which the game has been played there, the Yankees have reached the World Series. 
New York shortstop Derek Jeter, a seven-time All-Star, said he would be honored to play in an All-Star game in his home ballpark. 
''I'm surn it would be special for anyonn, whether you're a Yankee or not. It would be more special for a Yankee," Jeter said at the team's com­plex in Tampa. 
Bloomberg said the city esti­mates that the 2008 All-Star game and its related events will generate about $150 million for New York -in addition to pro­viding valuable exposure. 
"Great news for the city. Finally my big chance to enter 
the  !lome  Hun  Derby,"  
Bloomberg  said,  drawing  
laughs.  

"Nobody stages big events like the Big Apple," he added. "We'll put on the best All-Star game in baseball history." 
It will be the eighth All-Star game in New York. The Polo Grounds hosted the event in 1934 and 1942, Ebbets Field in 1949 and Shea Stadium in 1964. Selig said the crosstown Mets are "on the radar screen" to be awarded the Midsummer Classic once they get their new ballpark, which is slated to open in 2009. 

"I cannot tell you the intensi­ty of competition for All-Star games," Selig said. "Ten years ago that wasn't true. Now I have a long list."

O'Neill keys icers' defense 


By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 
Last season the Notre Dame defensive unit opened up the year by allowing five or more goals in three of its first five games. After an 8-5 home loss Nov. 4 to No. 3 Michigan, Irish coach Jeff Jackson decided he had seen enough and benched his top defenseman, Wes O'Neill. 
The next night was the first -and only -time that the Ontario native was not on the Irish lineup card in his hockey career. Now a senior, O'Neill has played in 140 of a possible

O'Neill 
continued from page 28 
141 games since coming to Notre Dame in 2003 -a stat matched only by fellow senior Jason Paige. 
O'Neill, now an alternate cap­tain, called his night off a "wake-up call" from Jackson that allowed him to stay focused throughout the rest of the year. 
"It was the first time I've ever been benched," O'Neill said. "But it was good because after that game I played pretty good for the rest of the year." 
Since then, he has only helped to anchor the No. 1-ranked defense in the nation, as well as collect his second consecutive Bill Nyrop Award, given to the top defensive player on the team each year. Nyrop was an All-American defenseman dur­ing his four-year career at Notre Dame. He later went on to win three Stanley Cup Championships on the domi­nant Montreal teams of the late '70s before passing away due to cancer in 1995 at the age of 43. 
"Anytime you win an award named after a guy like that, it's pretty prestigious," O'Neill said. "We have a lot of great defense­men on our team, and any one of us could win it any year." 
O'Neill is a serious candidate to collect his third trophy at the conclusion of this year. Jle would be the first Irish bluelin­er to ever achieve the honor three years in a row. 
O'Neill has also been an offensive threat throughout his career. 
He was second on the team in scoring his sophomore year, with six goals and 14 assists. The following year he buried another six pucks while adding 19 helpers. 
The highly decorated lefty attributes his success to hard work, his vision on the ice and the 40 pounds that he has added to his 6-foot-4 frame since his freshman year. 
"Putting on that extra weight has really helped me be able to dominate in front of the net," O'Neill said. 
The 235-pounder has made a living by punishing forwards parked in front of Irish goal­tender Dave Brown, especially when his team needs him most. 
O'Neill has played his best games in blue and gold against top-tier opponents. This year he played a big role in wins ovor then-No. 1 Boston College, Michigan and Miami. 
Against the Hedllawks last weekend, O'Neill took a low, hard shot from the point, which was deflected past Miami goalie Jeff Zatkoff for a goal when the Irish trailed 2-0. Zatkoff had looked invincible tho entire game, but the goal sparked an Irish rally to tin the contest and take a crucial point in a key CCHA series. 
"Wes has the ability to be the most dominant defenseman in this league," Jackson said. "It's just a matter of him being as intense and motivated against every opponent, because if he did that he would dominate." 
Although both O'Neill and Jackson expressed concerns about his consistency, neither can be upset about the contri­butions he has made to the team so far this year as the Irish will make a bid to be the No. 1 squad in the country this weekend against Bowling Green.

at the end of the year." 
The Irish will face No. 18 Oemson (2-0) today in first-round action. Leading the Tigers is No. 72 junior Carol Salge and Frederica van Adrichem, who finished the 2006 season ranked No. 55 in sin­gles play. 
Clemson is a young team with freshmen comprising half of their 10-player roster, with only one senior -Maria Brito. But the team's success in recent years otTers an exciting challenge for Notre Dame. 
"We're really excited to get a chance to play Clemson," Louderback said. "We haven't played them for quite a while. They've done well in the NCAA Tournament the last few years." 
Notre Dame began its spring season with a 7-0 win over Illinois and a 4-3 victory over No. 12 Vanderbilt, who is also one of the 16 teams in the tournament this weekend. This year's team relies on its highly touted doubles teams of No. 11 Catrina and Christian Thompson and No. 5 Brook Buck and Kelcy Tefft to gain the doubles point and give the Iri'lh a 1-0 start in each match. After that, Notre Dame looks to at least split singles matches to claim victory. 
"We'll be happy to win it. We're the two seed this year, but eight to ten teams have a chance to win it," Louderback said. 
Should the Irish defeat the Tigers, they will play the winner of No. 10 Baylor and No. 37 BYU. If Notre Dame makes it all the way to the finals, they will most likely face No. 1 Stanford. 
"Everybody's looking forward to playing Stanford. There are sen­iors on the Stanford team who have never lost a dual match," Louderback said. "Any chance to play them is going to be fun ... but we have a lot of other matches we have to play before them." 
Wm or lose, Louderback said his squad should get some quality competition against other elite pro­grams around the country. 
"We should get three matches against top-20 teams, which is going to be good for us," he said. "This is good preparation for when we play top-flight teams at the end of the year in the NCAA Tournament."

On paper the Comets and Belles played an even game. Olivet turned the ball over two more times than Saint Mary's (14-12) but out­rebounded the Belles 35-33. The Comets shot 43 percent from the field compared to Saint Mary's 45 percent. 
Free throws ended up being the key to Saint Mary's victory. The Comets shot a higher percentage from the charity stripe, but the Belles were able to get to the line more often. The Comets made 80 percent of their 20 free-throw attempts, while the Belles made 72 percent of their 36 shots. 
Junior guard Alison Kessler scored a career-high 34 points, recording three steals and hitting a career high 14 free throws on 15 attempts from the line.

Special to The Observer 
The Notre Dame baseball program's sixth annual Opening Night Dinner will be held in the Joyce Center Fieldhouse on Monday, Feb. 12 -with 2006 Major League Baseball manager of the year Jim Leyland and former Notre Dame standout Craig Counsell (a two-time World Series champion) to serve as the keynote speakers at the popu­lar event. 
As in recent years, fans are encouraged to purchase tick­ets early·to ensure their spot at the special night, which provides attendees the oppor­tunity to visit with members of Notre Dame's nationally­ranked baseball team. The $40 admission price ($25 for stu­dents, youth and seniors) includes a Notre Dame base­ball 2007 season ticket (a $50 value, covering 27 regular­season game), a 2007 media guide ($15 value). auto­graphed 8x1 0 photographs of each speaker, and several other advance promotional items. A special "fan pack" price of $100 also is available, providing admission and the other dinner benefits for two adults and two youth. 
The "ballpark-style" dinner will begin at 7:00 p.m., in the Joyce Center Fieldhouse. The night's festivities include the opportunity to win a variety of baseball and sports-related door prizes and introduction of the Notre Dame team mem­bers, who will be seated at tables with the rest of the attendees and will be available for autographs prior to the dinner, from 5:45-6:45. The ballpark atmosphere also will include big-screen video high­lights and game tapes from previous Notre Dame seasons, plus a musical selection of tra­ditional and contemporary baseball songs. The night again will conclude with a spe­cial question-and-answer ses­sion that will allow attendees to interact with Leyland and Counsell. 
Leyland is a self-proclaimed Notre Dame fan and a long­time friend of the University's former sports information director, Roger Valdiserri. His nephew Chris Leyland is a 1999 Notre Dame graduate while Leyland's brother, Father Tom Leyland, is a Catholic priest who performed the wedding service for Jim

The keynote speakers have a connection going back to the 1997 Major League season, when Leyland was the manag­er and Counsell one of the heroes for an upstart Florida Marlins team that won the World Series title. Leyland's 33 total years in professional baseball have included 15 pre­vious seasons as a big-league manager, amassing nearly 1,200 career wins during stints with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Florida Marlins, Colorado Ifockies and now the Detroit Tigers. He holds the rare distinction of guiding wild-card teams from both leagues -the 1997 Marlins and 2006 Tigers -to the World Series and he was named the National League's manager of the year for the 1990 and '92 seasons, during which time the Pirates won three straight National League East Division titles (he also was a NL manager-of-the-year honoree in '88). 
Counsell -whose father John was a player and assis­tant coach with the Irish dur­ing the 1960s and early '70s ­was among the top players who led the Notre Dame base­
ball program to national prominence in the early 1990s, with his four-year career including a .306 batting average, 204 runs scored, 166 RBI, 50 doubles and twice as many bases on balls (166, still most in the ND record book) as strikeouts (82). As a senior, the versatile infielder was named MVP of a 1992 Irish squad that included 14 eventual profes­sional draft picks, with his impressive final season includ­ing a .339 batting average, 63 RBI (nearly doubling his previ­ous career-best), twice as many home runs (12) as he had hit during the previous three seasons combined (6), 45 walks and 13 stolen bases. Counsell was named to the 1992 NCAA all-Atlantic Regional team, after captain­ing the Irish to within a game of the College World Series.
