'Just say no' to game show addiction 
"I'd like a 'K' please ...." "It's a six-letter word building on the letter 'M' in ANIMAL ...." "It's the 'Sing Along With Colin' channel 
" 
I have become addicted to game shows. I'll admit it: my name is Colleen and I'm a game showaholic. From Win, Lose, or Draw to Wheel of Fortune, I'll watch just about anything with contestants and prizes. 
One of my biggest childhood dreams was to actually play on a game show, especially my favorite, Family Feud, though any game show would do. 
On summer mornings, when most normal grade school kids were terrorizing the neigh­borhood on Big Wheels, I was glued to the tele­vision with a glass of milk in one hand and a bowl of Rice Krispies swimming in sugar in the other, watching such classics as Card Sharks and The Joker's Wild. And the dream lived on. 

My game show obsession went into recession during high school, but once I arrived here it exploded. My roommates and I have become Jeopardy goddesses. The annoying song they incessantly play is permanently ingrained and occasionally I find myself humming it for no apparent reason--a sure sign that professional 
rlJ~:)'8"" 
help is needed. 
Scrabble, which we cut lunch short to see, has become one of our fortes. The Chuck Bucks and that neat sound as the Scrabble board opens up keep us going through our difficult days. 
It's a good thing we do not have MTV or Remote Control would take up the rest of what little free time I have. 
Anyone walking into our room during a game show will usually be ignored until the commer­cial and hear such outbursts as "Pick the L, you dummy!" or "I solved that puzzle five minutes ago ! " 
'J'hen it happened: the chance to make that childhood come true. Wheel of Fortune was to scout Notre Dame for participants on their Col­lege Week. 
I nearly choked on my chicken patty as the world swam in front of my eyes. Mter years of watching game shows try to pass off a College Week with representatives from every school in California and podunk colleges such as North­eastern Community College of Central Mon­tana, they finally got smart and scouted some real schools: the University of Oklahoma, the University of Hawaii, some school in Coral Gables, Fla., and N_Q. 
On Friday at 11 a.m., to my joy, surprise, delight, mirth and general glee I was 85th in line. It was to be a cold two hours, but I was within the 100-person limit and on my way to that dream! 
Anyone who remotely looked like they might be thinking of maybe possibly cutting in line was practically ripped to shreds. But once the 100 of us determined Wheel fans (though I have a feeling many guys were just vying for the chance to see Vanna "Goddess of Love" White) were let in I figured it would be smooth sailing. 
Because I cannot bear the thought of com­pletely retelling this horrible story, my child­hood dream had no chance. It died a swift and painful death. 
But I did not leave empty-handed, however. My "I tried out for Wheel of Fortune" pencil and Wheel of Fortune hat (what every well­dressed person nee<js) will always remind me how close I was. 
So much for all the practicing: "For $200 I'd like the brass eagle bookends ..." and scream­ing "Big money, big money!" all over the dorm. 
Maybe next year it will be Scrabble.

Idaho National Guard troops Tuesday helped rescue lives­tock stranded by 15-foot snow drifts that have buried hundreds of other animals, while the nation's deadly cold snap pushed temperatures to record lows in several states. 
Some California citrus growers feared the arctic air has caused millions of dollars in crop damage. And in Las Vegas, which dropped to a record low 16 degrees, sheets of ice covered casino fountains and backyard swimming pools. 
But Mardi Gras revelers didn't let a little cold stop them. Men in miniskirts pranced through New Orleans' French Quarter in near-freezing wea­ther, as others pitched tents along parade routes. 
Panel members support creation of a government 'ethics czar' 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-Several members of President Bush's ethics commission supported the idea Tuesday of creating a federal ethics czar with the power and prestige of Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who cleaned up baseball in the 
1920s. 
No final recommendations were made at the first meeting 
"I live to just go up and down the street and get my picture taken," said a man in black lace corset, garters and goosebumps who declined to be identified. 
At least 79 deaths have been blamed on the cold weather since Jan. 31, when frigid air blew out of Alaska and into the lower 48 states. 
Schools were closed in parts of Alabama, Colorado, Idaho, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oregon, and Texas. Scattered power outages were reported in several states, including Texas, utah, Colorado and Mis­sissippi. 
Snow fell over parts of New Mexico, Texas, from northern New York state across nor­thern Ohio, the upper Great 
the czar idea was informally floated by Chairman Malcolm Wilkey, a former federal appel­late judge, and instantly en­dorsed by other members. 
The two-week-old panel has one month to recommend to Bush any legislative or admin­istrative changes needed to stiffen and standardize federal 
ethics enforcement. 

As they debated what issues to address, former Attorney General Griffin Bell, the vice
chairman, complained that the welter of existing laws and rules is confusing. 
"The ethics laws in govern­ment now are about like the

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The Pales­tinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip led to a "substantial increase" in human rights violations by Is­raeli authorities last year, the State Department said Tues­day in its annual report on rights conditions worldwide. 
The report, covering condi­tions in 169 countries and ter­ritories, praised the Soviet Union for "remarkable changes" in the human rights field, including the freeing of all prisoners detained for poli­tical or religious offenses.

outstanding performance during the season, and thanked the entire university for its tre­mendous support. 
Finally, after much applause and cheering, Coach Lou Holtz rose to speak. 
Holtz attributed the National Championship title to the team's intense discipline, the intelligence of the athletes and the students, and most of all, to the feeling of love and con­cern present at Notre Dame. 
"We were without a doubt the very best football team in the entire country," Holtz stated. He then brought the entire team on the stage, and congrat­ulated them class by class. 
Holtz ended his speech by saying, "I'd rather be at Notre Dame if we never won a game, than to be anywhere else and win a National Champion­ship." 
Coach Holtz was presented with a large photograph of the entire football team and coach­ing staff. The picture will be hung in the La Fortune Student Center. 
The pep rally concluded with an hour-long display of 88-89 highlights, titled "They Wanted to Win."

Afghan government prepares for life without the Soviet army 
Associated Press 

KABUL, Afghanistan -The government has armed 30,000 Communist Party members in Kabul and thousands more in towns and villages in case guer­rillas attack after all the Soviet troops are gone, a spokesman said Tuesday. 
Nab Amani of the Foreign Ministry said the party mem­bers would continue their reg­ular jobs but "have been armed to defend their homes," neigh­borhoods and towns after the Feb. 15 deadline for Soviet withdrawal. "Party members look on their weapons as their pride," he declared.

The chartered Boeing 707 was at the Islamabad airport in Pakistan. In New York, U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes said it was held up for undeter­mined reasons and probably would not leave until Wednes­day. 
In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said at a news brief­ing that food supplies had im­proved in Kabul but the fuel shortage was critical. Soviet aircraft began an emergency airlift of flour and fuel last month. 
Yuri K. Alexeyev, a Foreign Ministry official, said about 15,000 Soviet soldiers had been killed in Afghanistan, nearly 2,000 more than the Kremlin re­ported previously. This indi­cated heavy losses during the withdrawal, but Alexeyev said, "It doesn't mean that during the last months we had the bloodiest period of the war in Afghanistan.'' 
At the news briefing in Kabul, Amani said 45,000 addi­tional party members who had finished compulsory military service volunteered for reserve duty or for self-defense and border units. They include 5,000 women assigned to non-combat units, he said. 
About 10,000 party members held a rally Sunday. They paraded past President Najib and Politburo members bran­dishing assault rifles and pledging to defend the Marxist government.

South Bend student devises top-ranking computer game 

Associated Press 
White blood cells are the heroes and viruses the villains in a computer game based on the human immune system and created by a 13-year-old stu­dent. 
The game titled "Anatomic Commando" has been named a top-10 finalist in a nationwide competition and has won a trip to Washington for its creator, Mike Krier, and his father Bill, professor of English at Notre Dame. 
When Mike saw a magazine advertisement for the contest, he was already prepared to begin. 
"I thought of the game a long time ago, and I thought I could put it down on paper and add details," he said before leaving Tuesday for the final competi­tion in the nation's capital. 
"You are a white blood cell in a human's body," read the playing directions. "Using your cytoplasm gun, along with various weapons you will col­lect along the way, you must

Science class provided Mike with most of the technical in­formation and jargon, such as cytoplasm, the stuff that con­tains many of the basic struc­tural elements of human cells. 
"For details I had to fill in, I went to the library," he said. 
When he needed a name for the missiles, one of the weap­ons, a sdence book description of gamma globulin seemed fit­ting. Gamma globulin is a blood protein that plays an im­portant role in the immune sys­tem's job of fighting disease. 
The weapons are used to fight off villains such as Attack Bac­teria, Monster Bacteria and Virus Clusters. 
The game made the finals probably because it is based on facts and isn't just another fan­tasy shoot-'em-up, said Mike. 
"It's real," he added. 
In the late development stages, Mike had to share home computer time with his sister, Caitlin, who came home from college on Christmas break and worked on her senior thesis. 
"He would be up late hacking away at the word processor," said his father, Bill Krier.

Editor's note: The following is the fourth in a series offive articles dealing with eating disorders. 
"Hi, my name is Wendy and I am a bulimic." Getting those words to come out was probably one of the toughest moments of my life. Yet, the opportu­nity for me to say those words came only after I finally admitted to myself and my family and friends that my life was out of control--I needed help. 
Wendy Chambers 
guest column 
My cry for help resembled a sur­render after a five year war between my mind and body. The ammunition in this way consisted of food, laxatives, excessive exercise, and purging. The casualties of this war added up to one-­myself. 
The war began as a game. Initially my strategy involved starvation. Of course I never thought of my "great plan to thinness" as being the road to resembling a concentration camp vic­tim or an Ethiopian child. But after six months of boycotting food, I weighed less than 90 pounds, most of which was accounted for by the weight of my bones and brain. I took pride in my "victory" over food. I was thinner than anyone I knew. Yet, I couldn't see the grossness of my body. Somehow the nerves to my brain malfunctioned every time I stood in front of a mirror. I saw a fat person with large hips and fat cheeks. Religi­ously I followed my daily routine of dodging meals. One day a size two pair of pants fell to the floor; at that moment I realized that maybe I should stop. But how? I couldn't bear the thought of gaining weight; I no longer knew how to eat. Sure I had heard about anorexia, yet recognizing it within myself never crossed my mind. 
I lived safely in my anorexic lifestyle until unexplainably my obsession with abstaining from food transformed into an obsession for food. I became over­whelmed by an insatiable hunger: ac­tually true feelings of hunger disap­peared and were replaced by a need to feel full. Of course this tranformation did not alleviate my fear of calories and regaining those forbidden pounds. I turned to ways of purging. First I tried laxatives, which never fully accom­plished my goal and became so painful that my abdomen felt like it had been

put in a food processor. Then J tried using my fingers to induce vomiting . .I found this to be noisy and incriminating in a dorm situation, not to mention the incredible sore throat which followed every attempt. 
I also used exercise as a means of purging. Many students easily incor­porate exercise into their daily routine. Think about trying to fit two aerobics classes, running two miles, and 100 sit­ups into one day. I spent most of my day either sweating or showering. Un­fortunately, disciplined athletes gain respect, because so many people claim laziness and other commitments super­sede a workout. Yet, no one realized my disciplined workout really was an obsession. I would become outraged if something interfered with my routine. 
The "binge" dominated my every waking and sleeping thought, leaving me continuously unrested and anxious. Like an alcoholic craving liquor, I craved food. I joined my friends for the normal three meals a day, where my incredible will-power turned me into a hero. My friends saw me eat salads, vegetables, and fruit; never adding up to more than 600 calories a day. But in my "secret world" I would eat dozens of cookies, jars of peanut butter, boxes of cereal, and the whopper of the list was "Whoppers." My self-esteem dragged farther and farther behind me. At every bite of food I would call myself an idiot and declare intense hatred for myself. Many times I sat crying in the corner of my room with a bag of cookies in my lap. I wanted to stop so badly, yet my hands shook furiously reaching for that next cookie. I was out of control, the addiction had taken over~ Yet, I didn't seem to care any more. 
Every aspect of my life fell apart in the shadows of my addiction. I became afraid to read my school work, for after ten minutes of reading thoughts of a binge consumed me. My concentration level fell, along with my grades. Yet, I didn't seem to care any more. 
Mter five long years the addiction began to take its toll on me. My deep dark secret manifested into an over­whelming sense of guilt. I realized how wrong my actions had been in God's eyes. I spent most of my day as a her­mit; my shame kept me from the people who loved me. I wanted to die. Every night I prayed for God to take me from this earth and my addiction. I desperately wanted to be free. 
Finally, I hit the bottom of my plum-

P.O. Box Q 

Learn to speak up at Toastmasters 
Dear Editor: 
How many times have you shuddered at the thought of speaking in front of a large group of people? Though com­mon, this fear of public speaking is easier to overcome than you might think. The Notre Dame chapter of Toastmasters International provides you with the opportunity to hone your overall communication skills while con­quering your fears of public speaking, all for a time investment of just one hour per week. 
The Toastmasters program is not a formal course in public speaking. It is an ongoing experience that involves you in a number of different communi­cation situations. The priniciples you will learn, such as the use of eye con­tact, body language, or vocal variety, are basic to any form of interpersonal communication, regardless of audience size. 
The key aspect of Toastmasters is ac­tive participation. People learn best by doing, and Toastmasters attempts to involve everyone in its meetings. In ad­dition to prepared speeches, you will participate in Table Topics, an im­promptu speaking exercise that develops your ability to quickly orga­nize and present your thoughts. This_ will prove valuable in such situations as interviews, seminars, business meetings, and conversations. There are numerous other roles in a meeting, in­cluding evaluators and a general evaluator. These roles are crucial, as evaluations both highlight strong points and offer constructive criticism, allow­ing everyone to learn from others in the club. • 
Possibly the most important aspect of Toastmasters is that you are among friends: A 'foastmasters meeting is a "workshop" attended by people united for the same reasons--to _overcome their fear of public speaking ~nd to develop skills crucial for proper cmn­munication and leadership. While this spirit of mutual support is comforting to the new member, it also makes learn­ing fun. • 
Whatever your goals in life may be, your success depends on your ability to communicate. Individuals who can ver­balize their ideas so that they are heard, understood, and acted upon, pos­sess one of the primary qualities of leadership. By joining a Toastmasters club, you will embark on a program that will multiply your communication and leadership skills. The Notre Dame chapter of Toastmasters meets Wed­nesdays from 7:30 to 8:30p.m. in room 223, Hayes-Healy. I challenge you to take the initiative, and speak up at Toastmasters.

Danger: Keep out of 'Dolphin Cove' 
Two of America's best female authors on campus
, 
JOE BUCOLO accent writer 

I 
n the midst of a devastating strike, such as that of the Writers Guild over the past summer, people try desperately to make the best of a bad situation. In this summer's sea of dark sets and perpetual reruns, some­one had an idea to film a show in Australia, far away from the politics of Holly­wood. The result of this voyage is a fish out of water in "Dolphin Cove." 
JOE BUCOLO 
To Be Continued... 
CBS' newest family drama swims into living rooms nationwide on Saturdays at 8 
p.m. "Dolphin Cove" tells of a marine biologist, Professor Larsen (Frank Converse) who, recently widowed, takes his family to Australia where he intends to research the language of dolphins. 
His son David (Trey Ames) hates the idea of leaving home and tends to be sarcas­tic about his fishy predica­ment. Katie (Karro!' Graves) is Larsen's daughter who developed a case of denial shock after seeing her mother die in a car crash. Ever since, Katie has not spoken to anyone. Other characters in­clude Katie's therapist Allison Mitchell (Virginia Hey), AI­li~on's son Kevin (Anthony Richards), Larsen's native assistant James Desmond (Ernie Dingo), and Baron Trate (Nick Tate). 
Sophomore Literary Festival 
~..........~~~..

GERRY SCIMECA accent writer 

T 
he Sophomore Literary Festival features its "buy one, get one free" night as two of today's most critically acclaimed women writers, Sue Miller and Meg Wolitzer, speak on their most recent works in the library auditorium tonight -at 8 p.m. 
Meg Wolitzer, a native of New York, is an engaging writer who has been talented enough to maintain a serious writing career while simulta­neously writing "The Dream Book," among other litera­ture for children. This crea­tive versatility has won her the unique distinction of having her work compared to Ann Tyler, as well as Beverly Cleary. 
The premise seems inter­esting enough, but in practice it becomes cliche and absurd. "Flipper" fans can easily predict the dolphins are heroes of the show. Ironically enough, the mammals (Larsen makes it clear they are not fish) do not like the biologist. Katie, on the other hand, becomes their instant friend. In fact, they communi­cate with her. It is like "Beauty and the Beast" in the deep blue. 
The expression "like father, like son" suitably describes 

these men's luck with friends. While dolphins do not respond to Larsen, the Australian boys at David's prep school often mock him; however, David finally befriends Kevin as Larsen becomes ac­quainted with Allison. 
The natural spring water in which these big tuna soak quickly turns to vinegar as the ridiculous communication between Katie and the dol­phins develops. In one episode, a jellyfish stings Al­lison while she is swimming in the ocean with Katie. Help­less and speechless, Katie signals the dolphins in a man­ner that would make Aquaman proud. In a spectac­ular (and silly) scene, the dolphins leap out of their private pool, over a huge ce­ment wall, and into the ocean to save Allison. 
Not all the scales on this 
flounder of a show are slimy. 
In "This is Your Life," three young sisters grow up to becomt three very differ­ent adults. Two of the sisters wear a size 20 dress, yet their similarities end there. 
While one gains fame and earns laughs on the "Tonight Show" by making sport of her girth, the other is lost in a sea of self-loathing and a hopeless obsession with a man she cannot hope to regain. Her continual aware­ness that she may never find love in a body which resembles an orchestral per­cussion instrument leads her into a spiraling despair of drugs and self-neglect. 
The daughters of the wo­men are tied into the story, and the focus turns to the bind of mother and sisterhood and the realization of its pow­erful importance in their lives. 
Sue Miller has gained a tre­mendous following over the past two years with the publication of her novel, "The Good Mother," and her most recent collection of short stories, "Inventing the Ab­botts." 
Focusing on the struggle in a woman's life between her loyalties to her daughter and

In fact, the character of David and the actor who portrays him, Trey Ames, are the slbow's saving graces. David is a delightful charac­ter to who many of the audi­ence members can relate. He's caring and compas­sionate to his sister; he's sar­castlc yet comforting to his father. 
In one funny school scene, the teacher is discussing great books and asks David to name a great American novel. He replies, "Emily Dickinson." After the stu­dents' laughter stops, the

her" has been hailed as one of the most gripping and im­portant pieces in contempo­rary women's fiction. 
"The Good Mother" is in its second printing, mainly on the strength of its release by Touchstone this past summer as a major theatrical release. Unfor.tunately, the novels name has been tarnished a good deal by the poor recep­tion of the movie, which was universally panned despite the presence of director · Leonard Nimoy. 
"Inventing the Abbotts" has equaled the accolades of "Mother" and won her com­parisons to Updike, Tyler and Fitzgerald as a surveyor of

teacher asks, jokingly, who wrote Emily Dickinson. David replies, "I suspect her parents did, from time to time." Ames, star of the now­defunct "A Year in the Life" is a superb actor who adds sparkle to the show's murky waters. 
"Dolphin Cove" is a dreary, unreal drama that should be harpooned by CBS executives as soon as possible. Without the communication between Katie and her aquatic friends, the show would be bearable; however, as it stands, no

Hi-tech takeovers show emphasis on short-term 
By LOUIS RUKEYSER Special to The Observer Mergers are emotional things, as any bride can at­test. So it's probably not surprising that every mem­ber of Congress seems to be wringing his or her hands these days over the issue of corporate takeovers. But, on the central ques­tion of whether such mergers are good or bad for the country's future, remarkably few solid facts have yet come marching down the aisle. The high-tech industry, possibly America's number one hope for the 21st cen­tury, provides a useful illus­tration. Passions-­and misinformation--abound on both sides.  larly frightening, since long­term planning has scarcely been the United States' strong suit in the past gen­eration. Indeed, the cliche has been that American cor­porate leaders too often are preoccupied with the next three months, while their Ja­panese counterparts are perpetually scanning the next three millennia. Even though that image is badly overdrawn, anything that adds to the perception of excessive investor focus on short-term profits is naturally touchy. In reality, though, financial analysts are not quite as dumb as they have been depicted; as corporate raider Carl Icahn observes, the stocks of genuinely ''research-driven  "has not happened," he may be going too far himself. In fact, many industry ex­perts are looking for a record number of high-tech mergers, acquisitions and leveraged buyouts in 1989, despite the recent decline in the number of deals in al­most every other area of the economy. The computer software and service industries have already recorded a 17 per­centincreaseintakeoversin the past two years. Among those phased in were the $830 million acquisition of Iccel Corp. by Computer As­sociates, Inc.; Advanced Micro Device's merger with Monolithic Memories, and Digital Communications As­sociates' purchase of  of explosive growth. This means that compan­ies are being pressured to pull different types of com­puters into hybrid networks. In some cases, the merger deals simply help solve tech­nological problems. others are the result of growing fin­ancial or marketing pressures-­or merely the desire to make a quick buck. It is the last complaint that is being made by Prime Computer, Inc., as it fights a hostile bid of nearly $1.3 billion by MAl Basic Four, Inc. The takeover was delayed by Federal Judge A. David Mazzone on the un­precedented ground that there were "profound ques­tions" about the strength of MAl's financier, Drexel  the (takeover) money would be provided by 'junk bonds,"' he told me. "The sky-high interest and debt load the merged companies would have to pay certainly would force slashing the re­search and development that not only built our firm, but keep us competitive." Research and develop­ment investment is the foun­dation of all high-tech com­panies, since products typically have a life cycle of no more than 18 to 24 months. The bottom line is that fur-· ther consolidation in the fragmented high-tech indus­try is inevitable--and often desirable. But shareholders should scan such deals closely and be wary of those

But when Icahn argues that, as a result, "intensive takeover activity" in these  other corporate naergers, analysts say the rise in solicited and unsolicited mergers indicates that the computer data processing market has started to ma­ charges. But Anthony Craig, Prime Computer's president, raises a direct challenge to the argument made by raiders like Icahn.

Meet new, mellower McEnroe 
Former No. 1 tennis player looks to regain consistency 
Associated Press 
As John McEnroe ap­proaches his 30th birthday next week, he says he no longer of­fers a fireworks display every time he plays a tennis match. 
"There's always a group of people who'll come out and want to see me yell at anum­pire," said McEnroe, the top attraction in the $300,000 Volvo Chicago tennis tournament that began Tuesday. 
"But I hope they come see me based on the way I play ten­nis and on my personality," McEnroe said. "The tide has really turned. For a lot of years, I had the crowd against me. 
"People now still like to see me play, but they feel more comfortable with me. They feel like they know me a little bet­ter." 
McEnroe left the tennis cir­cuit while he was on top, to marry and begin a family. He took six months off in 1986, and the break made him step back and take a look at his priorities. 
"I wished I love tennis like Magic Johnson loves basketball or Pete Rose loves baseball, but I never did," he said. 
·~r like to compete and win, but I don't have the burning love of it," he said. "And that kept me from being a little bit better. But it has helped me keep a perspective on where I was. I was never comfortable being No.1. 
"When I look back--and it's easy to look back-if I was No. 1 again, I would handle it dif­ferently and enjoy it much more. Instead, I felt there was nowhere to go but down." 
Since his break, however, McEnroe hasn't had the luxury of looking down from the top. 
He reached the finals of five tournaments in 1987 but didn't win any. He won in Tokyo and Detroit in 1988, reached the semis in Los Angeles and San Francisco and finished the year ranked 11th. A quarter­final apperance last month in Australia, where he lost to Ivan Lendl, pushed his ranking to ninth. 

McEnroe says he still is trying to find his game. 
"I don't feel I'm giving 100 percent," he said, "and that's more important at this moment than being No.1. The fire isn't btnrning, the flame has sort of dimmed a bit. 
"It doesn't seem quite as im­portant. I've been through it all so many times before, and it's sort of difficult to psych your­sell up. That's what's separat­ing me from other players." 
Lendl is seeded No. 1 in the six-day Volvo Chicago tourna­ment at the University of Illi­nois Circle Pavilion.

Svet captures gold in women's slalom 
Associated Press 
BEAVER CREEK, Colo.-­Mateja Svet gave Yugoslavia its first-ever skiing gold medal Tuesday by winning the wo­men's slalom at the World Al­pine Ski Championships and beating Vreni Schneider and Tamara McKinney. 
Svet finished a comfortable six-tenths of a second ahead of Schneider, the runaway leader on the World Cup women's cir­cuit. McKinney settled for the bronze medal--her second medal after winning the gold in the combined last Thursday. 
Svet, just four-hundredths of a second behind McKinney after the first run, was con­siderably faster than McKin­ney on the second run. Her second-heat clocking of 46.86 was third-best of the run. 
Svet, 20, finished with an ag­gregate time of 1 minute, 30.88 seconds. Schneider had an ag­gressive second run of 46.04 to move from eighth to second place at 1:31.49. It was the second silver medal of the championships for the 24-year­old Swiss ace. 
McKinney, 26, of Olympic Valley, Calif., could manage no better than the ninth-best run of the afternoon, 47.58, and slipped to third at 1:31.56. 
Blanca Fernandez-Ochoa of Spain was fourth in 1: 31.75, and Ingrid Salvenmoser of Austria took fifth in 1: 32.57. 
"I was sure of my victory at the finish area," Svet said. "Both Tamara and Vreni were very strong. I was not afraid at all, however."

Fordham is next test for ND 
Irish meet Phelps' old team in Madison Square Garden 

By PETE SKIKO Assistant Sports Editor 
NEW YORK-Notre Dame men's basketball head coach Digger Phelps returns to New York as the Irish face Fordham, the team he began his collegiate coaching career with 19 years ago, tonight at 8:30. 
But there won't be much room for sentimentality in Madison Square Garden as Notre Dame cannot afford a road loss to the 10-10 Rams. 
"We've just got to take it one game at a time," said Irish co­captain Joe Fredrick. "We learned a lot from the Duke game (a 102-80 loss), and we know that we've got to beat the teams we're supposed to beat and maybe a few that we're not--whatever it takes to get to Seattle." 
The Notre Dame-Fordham matchup is the second game of a Madison Square Garden doubleheader. lona takes on Georgia Tech in the opening game. 

Fordham is riding a three­game winning streak heading into tonight's game, but the Rams are running into an op­ponent with which they have had little luck over the years. 
After steering the Rams to a 26-3 record and a third-place finish in the NCAA East Regional in the 1970-71 season, Phelps came to Notre Dame and his teams have wreaked havoc against his old school. 
The Irish lead the series 15-5, with Phelps carrying a 13-4 record into tonight's matchup. Notre Dame has won the last six meetings, inc1uding last year's 64-59 victory at the Joyce ACC. 
Fordham is led by 6-5 senior forward Joe Paterno (20 points 
Opinions concerning 
Bird, Jabbar, Jordan 
Something is amiss in the state of Texas. Or it soon will be anyway. This has nothing to do with George Bush although some­
thing is amiss there too. 

When the National Basketball Association All-Stars take to the court Sunday in Houston, No. 33 will not be suited up. 
On both sides. Neither absence has to do with an oversight nor an in­justice. 
Brian O'Gara 
Irish Items 


On the one hand, age and the rest of the basketball world 
has finally caught up with the greatest scorer in NBA 
history, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 

Once a guaranteed 20 points a night, the king of basket­
ball over the last score now struggles to get eight. 

For the Eastern Conference, a Bird of a different feather 
will miss this gala showcase for the first time in his il­
lustrious career. 

The man who put the basketball craze back into Bean­town a decade ago now awaits the doctor's word before he can don the green-and-white again. 
Celtics officials estimate March 1, when Boston returns home to meet Atlanta after a long road trip, as Larry Bird's first game back after a 39-game abs~nce. 
But when the jump ball goes up on Sunday in Houston, Bird will be nested up in the stands or back home again in Indiana. 
Larry Bird not in the All-Star Game? 
Its like Wheaties without milk. 
Q without the U. 
Keenan Revue without Saint Mary's jokes,.. 
A dunking contest without Michael Jordan. 

Which, speaking of the most high-flying bird of all, is another void in this All-Star weekend. 
On the advice of doctors, Jordan will not defend his title after suffering a strained knee two weeks ago in a game with Dallas. 
It's too bad that it took an injury to keep Jordan out of the contest. He admitted last month that participating in last year's All-Star weekend festivities took so much out of him that he was lackluster for two weeks. During that time, the Bulls went 4-7. 
Thanks for thinking of your team, Michael. 

While we are on the subjects of one man carrying four others on his back, has anyone out here, engulfed by the Jordan hoopla, noticed that the mighty Celtics are wallow­ing in mediocrity? 
If Jordan needs a clue as to what it means to be the most valuable player on a team that has a prayer of winning a round in the NBA playoffs, he ought to read his newspaper clippings when Larry Bird returns. 
I make no claims that Boston will win back the title or

Junior center Danny O'Sullivan (10.6 ppg, 8.0 rpg) will take up the middle and is the only other Ram to average above double figures in scoring. Damon Lopez (5.4 ppg,

Head Coach Nick Macarchuk can usually get his team up for the Irish, and that is enough to both worry and interest Fredrick.

Another recruiting bonanza 
NO expected to sign 17 SuperPrep All-Americans today 
Associated Press 

Notre Dame, coming off its 
first national football champi­
onship in 11 years, is about to 
score another dramatic vic­
tory. 

Wednesday is the national 
signing day for high school 
prospects and the Irish loom as 
runaway winners, according to 
Allen Wallace, publisher of Su­
perPrep Magazine of Costa 
Mesa, Calif. 

Notre Dame has received oral commitments from 17 of the 161 players given All­America status by SuperPrep, including the top-rated prospects in two of the maga­zine's nine categories--quar­terback Rick Mirer of Goshen, \Ind., and tight end Irv Smith of 
Pemberton, N.J. 

Mirer was SuperPrep's No. 
1-rated quarterback, as well as 
Midwest Offensive Player of 
the Year. He led his team to 
the state championship by 
completing 259 of 420 passes for 3,973 yards and 30 touchdowns while rushing for 480 yards and 22 TDs. He played safety on defense, intercepting eight passes, and also did the placekicking. 
The 6-foot-4, 230-pound Smith is rated the best tight end in the country although his team's wishbone offense limited him to 18 receptions. He made All­State as a defensive back. 
SuoerPrep's top-rated offen­sive lineman, 275-pound Bob Whitfield of Wilmington, Calif., has committed to Stanford, as has the top kicker, Paul Stonehouse of Los Angeles. The No. 1 defensive lineman 268­pound Sean Gilbert of Aliquip­pa, Pa., Defensive Player of the Year in the Northeast, says he will attend Pitt. The No. 1 defensive back, Eric Geter of Newnan, Ga., is headed for Clemson. 
Curtis Conway, a quarter­back with exceptional speed who ranks No. 1in Super Prep's all-inclusive "athlete" cate­the teams like Oklahoma," said McCann. "It all stems from concentration and right now some of our guys are lack­ing." 
Notre Dame's spot at No. 13 in the nation is its highest rank in the history of the program. With the strength of their schedule, the Irish are starting to compete with the elite of col­lege wrestling. Before its match with Notre Dame, Okla­homa had tied the top-ranked team, Arizona State, and beaten the 2nd ranked team in Penn State. With one more in­dividual win, the Irish would have beaten Oklahoma and probably assured themselves of a first-ever top ten ranking. 
"That <Oklahoma match) could be the turning point of our season," said McCann. "We know that our capabilities are as good as anyone in the country."
