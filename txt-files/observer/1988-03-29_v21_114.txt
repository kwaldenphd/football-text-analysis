An Ohio yankee in the land of (Southern) Oz 
They say you learn something new every day. Well over spring break, I learned one thing ... I am a Yankee. I hadn't felt more branded with an unwanted identity since freshman year when I dropped all 23 of my research books for a four-page paper down the library stairs. 
Someone called my entire family "Yankee pigs" once in Georgia when we were on our way to Florida, but the only thing I remember from that town was that my dad had to wake the gas station attendent, who was sleeping on the gas pump, so we could fill up and move on. 
When I found out that I would be spending break in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, I gladly L---~ 


pulled my luggage across the frozen snow­covered plains of Indiana to the airport. I was excited to be going to astate usually associated with sun and sand, but I have never been a big basketball fan, so the ticket in my pocket to the Notre Dame game at the NCAA regionals was only the excuse to get me away for the week. 
Little did I realize that my less-than­enchanted attitude for basketball would stick out of the crowd like a sore thumb in the land qf the South, where college basketball is next to cleanliness and Godliness. 
These people eat, drink, sleep and breathe basketball, and everyone is a Dick Vitale. Maybe I would have felt better at the game had I dressed in Carolina blue and pushed my way through to see the television screens stationed at every gate in the Smith Center. They were broadcasting ESPN so that fans at the game would not have to miss one basket of tourna­ment action around the country, especially their Tarheels. They even named a bar in the area after a famed offense called The Four Cor­ners. 
This basketball bedlam was amazing to me, coming from a steel town in Ohio where bas­ketball is considered to be a consolation sport for us football fans. 
I sat, in comfort, with the Carolina members of the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's "family", who showed up in green plaid for the Irish appear­ance on St. Patrick's Day. But we might as well have been wearing Union Blue and playing flutes. There were only a handful of us and when the team was announced, the only sound we heard was a dull hiss. Notre Dame is not very well-received, being from the north; and moreover, there is not a general acceptance of Catholicism in the Bible Belt. 

Slowly (very slowly), Southern attitudes about things other than baketball began to un­fold before me, and I felt like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, confused by the disruption of my stability. The Tarheel residents that I ran into thought I was brave for wearing just a jean jacket in what they called frigid 50 degree wea­ther. They also noticed that "I tawk funy." 
Southern hospitality is very much alive and the people are genuinely interested in having conversations with you to make you feel at home, or at least to make you realize what you are missing, "being a Yankee and all." 
The food is incredible. The portions are huge and the taste is quite distinctive. The breeze was warm most of the time, except when the Irish lost, but then again, anything would have been warmer than ten inches of snow. 
But the yellow brick road was more like a path for the Irish in their quest for tournament action. I was glad to be back on familiar ground and I developed a deeper respect for college basketball. However, there was snow on the ground, the airport broke by suitcase and classes were to start the next day. 
Ahh. There's no place like home.

'Campaign managers' debate issues in Mock Convention 
By MATT GALLAGHER Copy Editor 
The campus campaign managers for the Mock Con­vention reached consensus on the most important issues in the upcoming presidential elec­tion: education, the deficit and making America more compet­itive in the world market. 
In a debate held Monday night in the Hesburgh Library auditorium, the mock cam­paign managers of the six Democratic candidates who will be represented at the up­coming Mock Convention had a chance to answer questions about domestic policy. 
Professor Peri Arnold, chair­man of Notre Dame's depart­ment of government, and Pro­fessor Patrick Pierce from Saint Mary's department of 
government asked a series of four questions to each of the 
campaign  managers  at  the  
sparsely attended event.  
Questions  relating  to  the  

budget, social spending priorities, economic policy and education policy were asked by the two professors. 
The organizers of the debate chose not to place a time limit on the responses of the cam­paign managers. 
Former Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt ,represented by Dan Sophy, was "the most ar­ticulate of the candidates re­garding the budget," accor­ding to Arnold. Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachussets, represented by Mark Betten­court, was portrayed as the candidate with the most practi­cal executive experience. 
Other candidates

represented were the Rev. Jesse Jackson (represented by John Farley), Sen. Paul Simon (Bill Smith), Sen. AI Gore 
(Mary LaSata), and Sen. Gary Hart (Mike Collins). These mock campaign managers will represent their candidates during the Mock Convention, to be held April 11 through April 14. 
The debate was moderated by Steve Claeys. 
Education, in its various forms, emerged as a dominant issue. Farley pointed out that "for every dollar of tax money taken in, 55 cents will be spent on defense, while only two cents will be spent on educa­tion." Farley said Jackson pro­posed a doubling of education funding, at the expense of defense funding. 
The campaign managers were unable to respond to several of the questions posed by the two professors and the audience, either because their candidate had not yet taken a stance on the issue or because the mock campaign managers were unfamiliar with their can­didates' responses. 
All of the mock candidates agreed the defense budget needed to be cut. Defense and foreign policy will be debated 
at a similar event on April 6

ND rats subject of diet, lifespan study 
Associated Press 
The immune systems of rats fed a low-calorie diet appear to function better in old age, a condition that may help explain why the rats lived longer, re­searchers reported at Notre Dame on Monday. 
Immune cells decrease in number with age in rats, a ten­dency retarded by a low­calorie diet, said immunolgy researchers Dr. Yoon Kim of Chicago and Dr. Kara Eberly, a biologist at Saint Mary's Col­lege. 
"Dietary restriction seems to slow the aging process,'' said Eberly. 
Kim and Eberly were joined by about 30 other scientists presenting results of a coopera­tive study on the effect of low­calorie diets on aging among rats raised at Notre Dame's Lobund Laboratory. 
"In a restricted diet, the ten­dency is not to use up" the im­mune system's ability to fight disease, said Kim. "Life, and healthy life, is due to restric­tion of diet, maintaining the po­tential of the defense system, not using it unnecessarily." 
Dr. Morris Pollard, director of the Lobund Aging Project, said the study is aimed at pro­viding a better understanding of why dietary restriction in­
creases the lifespan of labora­
tory animals. 

The scientists said the pre­liminary results with rats rein­force current medical notions about a healthy diet for humans. Nevertheless, the scientists cautioned against drawing new conclusions about the value of cutting down on eating. 
"I think the studies support the wisdom of what is com­monly referred to as a prudent diet," said Dr. Richard Weindruch of the National In­stitute on Aging. "Don't over­load yourself with calories." 
But he added, "The studies at present do not justify a re­commendation to the general public of severe caloric restric­tion, or even moderate caloric restriction, because there are so many difficulties in transla­tion between the animal model and the human situation." 
Weindruch speculated the animals on a restricted diet may undergo changes in metabolism. 
"The animals on food restric­tion may treat the limited en­ergy they ingest in a more ef­ficient fashion, and the biochemistry underlying that greater efficiency may be cri­tical," he said.

P.O. Box Q 
Annual Gong Show tonight 
Dear Editor: 

The curtains of the second Annual 
Gong Show open tonight! The show is 
a unique, fun-filled event produced by 
the class of 1990 to raise money for our 
class service project. 

As sophomores, we have spent two 
years sponsoring St. Hedwig's Out­
reach Program. The Outreach Pro­
gram provides a place where needy 
children from South Bend can go for 
support, tutoring, athletics, crafts, etc. 
Whether students have tutored during 
the week, have chaperoned evening ac­
tivities or have organized weekly Sat­
urday activities, involvement in the 
program has provided those students 
from all classes with fun and 
memorable experiences. 

The kids in the program are at an 
impressionable age and are looking for 
friendships and role models. Coming 
from crime-ridden areas, these kids, al­
though young, have been through more 
difficult times than most Notre Dame 
students. They have learned to fend for 
themselves and usually carry respon­
sibilities that would be burdensome at 
any age. The Outreach Program en­
courages the kids to work hard and pro­
vides rewards for their efforts in the 
form of trips to the Notre Dame campus 
and activities with Notre Dame stu­
dents. The kids look up to Notre Dame 
students and look forward to every op­
portunity to spend time with them. 
While the Gong Show raises money 
to continue the Program throughout the 
year, the production also provides an 
opportunity to get involved. Students

Liturgical Choir exclusion unfair 
Dear Editor: 

As a six year member of the-Notre Dame Liturgical Choir, which sings at the 10:30 a.m. Sunday Mass at Sacred Heart Church, I have looked forward to participation in the liturgies of the Easter Triduum. I was therefore very upset to learn that this year the Liturgi­cal Choir has been excluded from par­ticipation in the Holy Thursday Mass, and that the Folk Choir, which sings at the 12:15 p.m. Sunday Mass, would be the only choir participating. This deci­sion was wrong and should be changed for next year and future years. 
I have no objection to the participa­tion of the Folk Choir. They have par­ticipated with us for the past five years at the Holy Thursday Mass, as well as Junior Parent's Weekend. My objection goes only to the complete exc;lusion of the Liturgical Choir. 
I must state here that I am writing only for myself, to express my own feelings on this matter. I am not writing on behalf of the Liturgical Choir or anyone else connected with it. 
I wrote a letter some time ago to Fr. Daniel Jenky, the rector of Sacred · Heart Church, detailing the reasons for my objection. He wrote a lengthy letter back to me detailing his reasons for the exclusion. I have read and considered Fr. Jenky's letter, but I am still not con­vinced that it was the correct decision. 
I do not mean to be territorial. The main reason I object to the Liturgical Choir's exclusion is that there is a unity among the liturgies of the Triduum, and that the exclusion destroys that unity. 
I realize it is too late to change anyth­ing for this year. Anyone who will be attending the 5 p.m. Holy Thursday Mass at Sacred Heart Church expecting to hear the Liturgical Choir will be dis­appointed. I hope, however, that the decision will be changed for next year and future years, so that the Liturgical Choir will not be excluded from any of the liturgies of the Triduum.

Blame  wrongly  
placed  on  U.S.  
Dear Editor:  

Whenever a Marxist state commits an act of aggression, the question is not will some leftist group or organization somehow try to minimize or justify it, but rather when this will happen and how much blame the United States will be assigned. Enter Pax Christi-Notre Dame; the beat goes on. 
Mr. Dowd in his letter of March 23 says that the United States is willing to "engage in war before peaceful solu­tions have been exhausted." But the Sandinistas knew that peace talks with the Contras were on the horizon. Yet they still actively pursued an offensive which resulted in an armed incursion into Honduras. Who did you say was "engaging in war"? In other words, Mr. Ortega has once again provoked an incident--yet the United States gets the blame. 
Meanwhile, the deployment of U.S. troops has halted the Sandinista at­tacks, forced them to withdraw back into Nicaragua, -and opened the door for the recent cease-fire. Furthermore, aid to the Contras has forced Mr. Or­tega to make at least modest reforms in the area of human rights and freedom of speech. Continued pressure on the Sandinistas could force a con­tinuance of those reforms. Yet Pax Christi would have us cease all aid to the Nicaraguan Resistance, and at the same time abandon those suffering un­der the Ortega dictatorship to their fate. I fail to see the morality in that position. 
By the time this is printed, U.S. troops will be pulling out of Honduras. They will have accomplished their mis­sion of returning at least a semblance of stability to the region. Sadly, while groups such as Pax Christi show great awareness of the dangers of United States power, they do not realize that this power·can be put to good use. Fur­thermore, while they in effect tell us to trust Mr. Ortega and his henchmen, they do not see the dangers he presents to the Nicaraguan people--and what Mr. Reagan is trying to do about it. But then, they always blame America first.

Junior World Fencing at ND 
Dear Editor: 
During the next eight days, we will have on our campus 350 athletes and officials from 28 countries taking part in the 1988 Junior World Fencing Cham­pionships. I feel that as in 1971 and 1979, the last two times that Notre Dame has hosted this most prestigious event, this gives us all a unique opportunity to ex­tend a warm feeling of hospitality to our guests. 
I would enjoy putting many of our students in direct contact with our guests and allowing the chemistry that only our students can generate to promote feelings of good will. Any stu­dent who plans to be here from Mar. 31 to Apr. 4, and would like to help as a volunteer, please contact my office at 239-5585, or come by Room 309 of the Administration Building. 
From Thursday, Mar. 31, to Monday, Apr. 4, the best junior (under 20 years) fencers in the world will be competing for the title of "World Champion" at the Joyce ACC Fieldhouse. Fencing begins at 8 a.m. each day, with the finals at 7:30p.m. Notre Dame and St. Mary's students with valid student IDs are admitted free. 
On Thursday, Mar. 31, at 7:30 p.m., the opening ceremonies will take place in the Joyce ACC Arena. Admission is free. We hope that our student body will help us welcome our guests by filling the arena and cheering each delega­tion. 
On Monday, Apr. 4, at 7 p.m., the Notre Dame student body is sponsoring a party for the fencers and volunteers at Theodore's. We would also hope that our students would attend to help us say au revoir to our guests. 
I feel that this is probably the best opportunity all of us will have to meet and interact with such a large number of international students. Let this week 
become an experience that all of us will remember fondly.

Anchors away! 
'Fed up' students experiment with creative dining Two weeks ago we, as Notre Dame students, were graciously given a spring break--a week free of classes. During this week junk food became a delicacy as we fulfilled even our strangest cravings. I thought the first thing I wanted once I got out of this institution was a thick. juicy steak. Wouldn't you know, I substituted that steak with a Big Mac. (It was not only great but it was off-campus.) Now that I've been forced back to classes and dining hall  
Stephanie Snyder Less filling  
food, I've once again resorted to my way of semi-er\Joylng meals, that is, using creative dining. Creative dining is the art of making the dining hall food edible by adding other foods or just by creating new recipes making due with what is given, especially the salad bar. Cheese, it seems to me, is the savior of the dining hall (along with our quick heating microwaves). Cheese is melted on eggs, spaghetti, bread and mushrooms, to name a few. Some students satisfy their hunger by melting cheese on Fritos and then adding a little tobasco sauce for the taste of nachos. Another basic part of a typical student's meal, I have noticed, is the salad. The salad is a popular item because the menu fare is never too exciting and those who claim to be on diets refuse to eat anything else. Not surprisingly, many students feel like they are impressing others, especially members of the opposite sex. by suppressing their appetite and being content with just a salad. I have observed an unusual technique of making salads. We all realize the problems that can arise when making large salads in those small bowls. When It's time to add dressing, half of the lettuce ends up sliding out of the bowl and on to the fioor. The solution? Some clever students came up with the idea of putting the dressing in another bowl, quickly nipping it over the salad bowl, holding them tightly together and then shaking them vigorously. This method also ensures that the dressing is equally distributed throughout the salad. A few other recipes include peanut butter on bananas, apples, pears, carrots, celery, and, of course, bread (with jelly). Cottage cheese is often mixed with the fruit of the day by those with the intent of eating healthy. (You can usually see these students at the Ice cream bar later.) Bacon bits on Double Dome Burgers add some excitement between the buns. There is a problem, however, when there Is absolutely nothing in the menu that appeals to me and I'm not in the mood for a salad. When this happens (about every other day) I have one last recipe to fall back on. I take a bowl of Grapenuts, add a Iitle milk --not too much, pour on a little honey, and nuke the whole thing for about 45 seconds. Don't think that there aren't creative drinks because, yes, there are! Mixing juices with sodas is a common creative drink. Rootbeer floats and chocolate shakes are fun to try to make in those small glasses. Probably the most popular drink on a chilly day is mocha: half a cup of coffee mixed with half a cup of hot chocolate. And If you want to be eve,n more creative, you can steal some marshmallows from the Lucky Charms and add them to your hot choco­late or mocha. Although there are many ways of manipulating the food at the dining hall, there are some that won't work. For example, there were marshmallows out one day Intended for hot chocolate only. One student decided to make a version of Rice Krispie treats but his experiment failed as the whole thing blew up in the microwave. Manipulation of the meals and creation of new recipes at the dining hall, I have found, becomes a necessity after a period of time If you want to continue eating there without giving in to the urge to order out. Look around you at lunch. Check out the recipes that other people are eating, and If nothing Interests you, try a couple of the recipes I've mentioned. Be bold. Try some creative dining. M L B

Fisher Regatta stays afloat of the fun 
TIM KAISER accent writer 

Y
es, It's time again for the Fisher Hall Regatta! For those of you who may be fresh­men or missed out last year because you were too hung over to suffer through the driz­zling rain, the Fisher Regatta Is a homemade boat race on Saint Mary's Lake. This year it will be April 9 and will Include a cookout lunch on the shore along with a five band spon­sored by SUB. 
"What we are trying to do," said Jay Farraher, founder and chairman of the event "Is develop a yearly event directed towards the entire campus that will be both competitive and amusing." 
Amusing it is. Besides dodging a bombardment of water balloons, backsplash from oars and fire extinguis­hers filled with water, competi­tors were stunned last year by the presence of some unearthly figure who walked across the waters of Saint Mary's Lake. 
"We had a lot of fun last year," Farraher said, "but the rain prevented both the picnic, prepared by (University Food Services), and the five band. With warm weather, I think you will see a large turnout by the campus and people will stay and make an afternoon of it." 
1987 Asher Regatta participants paddle their way 
through the waters of Saint Mal)''s Lake on a drizzling day. Hopefully. this year's participants will have a more accomodatlng day on which to show off their homemade vessels and enjoy the accompanying activities. 
Boats can be made out of anything that fioats. Even If it doesn't fioat throw it on board. One of the teams last year put an old bathtub in the middle of their craft. Another boat or maybe it was the one with the bathtub, disintegrated upon contact with the water. 
"Don't worry," said Dan McDevitt, safety committee chairman, "we have talked with the Red Cross and they will be present throughout the race for safety reasons. Along with the Red Cross, there will be several certified lifeguards and monitors in boats alongside the course." 
Last year's boats were real masterpieces. Pangborn's entry, whose boat sported a large wooden paddle and was held afioat by numerous kegs, had a bit of trouble getting the paddle to touch the surface of the water. Lewis Hall couldn't find anybody brave or daring enough to pilot their ship, so they placed a dummy in their boat and tied It to the back of another competitor's craft. 
The Green Seamen, mem­bers of Fisher Hall's team and winners of last year's event are looking to duplicate their suc­cess this year. Greg Tatum, a senior mechanical engineer who was designer and captain of the winning vessel issued a challenge to the rest of campus. "We've been in the Aero Lab for the last month 
testing various fiow patterns and our next stop is the America's Cup." 

There will be separate heats for male and female teams. Prizes will be awarded for top finishers in both categories. That is not alii Awards will also be given for the most original boats. If you don't think you 
will be fast enough to win then get wild. Make a boat out of something original. Someone last year made a boat out of empty two-litre pop containers. 
"Right now, we are working on prizes from local mer­chants," said Omar AI-Farisi, chairman of the awards com­mittee, "but of course, the real prize will be the cherls!}ed 
Regatta Cup." 
I 
The Regatta is a charity event and the proceeds collected from entry fees will go to a Holy Cross missionary called the Andre house. All dorm presidents have the Informa­tion concerning the event and anyone interesed in forming a team should contact them. Even if you are not in the race, come out and join the fun, feed your faces, listen to the band or just lay in the sun.

Too much to do in too little time 
It was a simple case of too many matches in too few days for the Men's Volleyball Club last week. A tired Irish squad managed to win three games during that four-day span, but lost two other close contests. 
A 15-2, 15-6, 15-5 sweep of Aquinas College started the grueling stretch last Thursday. That victory sealed the Northern Conference Championship for the Irish. They finished the season with a perfect 10-0 mark in conference play and left coach Bill Anderson looking for better competition. 
"I knew there wasn't a team in the conference that could beat us," Anderson said matter-of-factly. "Next year, we're going to be an independent. It just doesn't do our program any good to play these teams in the conference." 
Indiana-Purdue Ft. Wayne downed the Irish in straight games Friday by scores of 15-10, 15-8, 15-7 in the JACC. Notre Dame then hit the road and bounced back with a 15-5, 15-6, 15-8 win over Miami Saturday. Then, the big road trip began. 
The Irish boarded a bus at 4 a.m. Sunday morning with a destination of Normal, Ill. and the Illinois State tourney. They arrived tired and sluggish, losing to Wisconsin 9-15, 15-6, 11-15, 13-15 in the first round. The Irish bounced back to take the consola­tion contest 15-6, 8-15, 15-12, 10-15, 15-10 over the host Redbirds. 

"I wasn't happy at all with the way we played," 
Anderson said. "San Diego State dominated us. We should have beaten Chapman College, but luck didn't have it that way. I think maybe we had a little too much sun. We kind of forgot part of the reason why we went out there." 
The Irish now stand 22-9 with only the Regional Championships ahead of them. That tourney will be held April15-16 at Bowling Green. 
The Rugby Club lost to Ball State 13-12 last 
weekend to fall to 1-1 for the spring season. 
"We really should have beaten them," Club Vice­
President Pat O'Malley said. "There were some 
really questionable calls made. We played really 
well. The serum held us in the game the first half 
and then in the second half the backs started to 
play well." 
The Irish defeated the South Bend Men's Club to 
begin the spring campaign earlier in March. The 
team travels to Purdue Saturday, April 9. 
Irish tennis returns home to take on Hawaii, Ball St.

The Notre Dame men's ten­nis team plays at home for the first time in close to a month on Thursday when they host Hawaii. On Saturday the Irish take on Ball State. Both matches are scheduled outside on the Courtney Courts.

Belles stay perfect, top Wheaton 

By HEATHER ATKINSON Sports Writer 
Although the weather forced it to play indoors again at An­gela Athletic Facility, the Saint Mary's tennis team was able to outlast its competition and maintain its perfect record. The Belles defeated Wheaton College 6-3 in boosting their record to 2-0. 
Once again the freshmen played key roles in the Belles' victory. Many of the players were victorious in two straight sets. 
Freshman Sarah Mayer was promoted to the position of the number one player in the singles competition because of her outstanding performances in the past. Living up to the ex­pectations, Mayer defeated her opponent 6-1, 6-2. 
Belles fall to sw Michigan 
By KRISTINE GREGORY Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's varsity track team lost Saturday at Southwestern Michigan Jr. Col­lege. The Belles scored 46 points in their first outdoor meet, but it wasn't enough to beat one of the top five junior colleges in the country whose star runner is a member of the Jamacian Olympic team. 
Unlike our recent spring weather, the afternoon was cold, windy and snowy. The conditions challenged the team, yet it still managed to show some fine individual and relay performances. 
The 100 meter dash was the highlight of the meet as fresh­man Kelly Streit tied the school record in the event. Her time of 13.2 seconds run was enough to match Ann Boutton's record set in 1982. 
The time was only enough for a second place finish as Streit

Jen Block had some difficulty with the inconsistency of her competition, but also came through with a victory in two straight sets with scores of 6-2, 6-2. 
"Jen played really well," co­ach Debbie Laverie said. "Her opponent was difficult to play because she was very hot and cold, but Jen kept the pace going and beat her." Mary Turk also turned in an out­standing victory. Turk was down 5-1 in the tie breaker of the first set but came back to win 7-6, 6-4. 
Also contributing to the Belles' second victory of the spring season was Charlene Szajko with a 6-3, 6-2 win. 
In doubles action, a change in the partnerships for the num­ber two and three teams pro~red beneficial, but the number one team could not pull together to win. 
"They played really tough but just weren't quite on the right track and lost one they shouldn't have," said Laverie. 
Mayer, Block and Turk con­tributed to the Belles' victories in doubles in addition to their successes in singles competi­tions. 
Mayer teamed up with Turk to come from behind and con­quer Wheaton's players 3-6, 6-4, 6-0. 
The duo of Block and Jane Schnell won with scores of 6-2, 
6-1. 
"We didn't have a spring trip this year so it was tough to come back with only three days to prepare for this match," said Laverie. "I think this has been a great start to the season."

Second place in NCAA 
Tourney highlights year~

What do you do when your competi­
tion turns in an outstanding gold medal 
peformance? 
Invest in silver. 

-
That's exactly what the Notre Dame men's fencing team did this past week at the NCAA Championships at Prince­ton, N.J. The defending champions from Columbia beat the Irish with a stellar performance and managed to place one fencer atop each of the three weapons, garnering three gold medals. 
"Our only way of catching them was to win a gold medal in one of the weap­ons," said Irish head fencing coach Mike DeCicco. "We should not take anything away from the Columbia team, what with their winning all three gold in the individuals." 
Of course there were bright spots for the Irish. Three-time All-American Yehuda Kovacs placed fourth overall in foil, while freshman Phil Leary was impressive in finishing 16th in his first ever NCAA Championship. 
In the sabre weapon, freshman stan­dout Leszek Nowosielski wrapped up Kentucky, with a score of 921, took second and Louisville held onto third with a score of 937. Also competing in the Invita­tional was Purdue, which bet­tered Notre Dame by only seven strokes. 
Two individuals who per­formed extremely well in the adverse conditions were juniors Pat Mohan and Doug Giordio. Mohan recorded a score of 232 for three rounds of golf, good enough for nth place out of 105 golfers. Right behind 
sabremen helped put Notre Dame in third place overall after the first day of competition. 
Without a doubt, the high spot for the men's team was the performance of junior epeeist Todd Griffee. Griffee ap­peared to be on a mission as he finished the regular season on fire. Losing some early bouts forced Griffee to take the long road, but when the dust cleared he was fencing against John Normile of Co­lumbia for the epee championship. Griffee had to settle for the silver--this year. He will return next year as will all six NCAA qualifiers from Notre Dame. 
Junior Ted Fay will also have another shot next year after placing 18th this season. 
The performance of Griffee cul­minated a team effort that gave Notre Dame second in the overall team stand­ings. 
"For us to finish where we did, I'm thrilled," said DeCicco. "I think that it was a great opportunity for the whole team to see what it's like to compete at the championship level." 
DeCicco not~ that his personal ex­pectations concerning the team were Mohan was Giordio, who finished 12th with a score of 233. 
Coach Noel O'Sullivan was pleased with his team's effort, stressing that Notre Dame's score of 313 was the sixth best score recorded on the final 18 holes. 
"We finished up strong, on a very impressive note. This should help springboard us onto Lewis College," O'Sullivan noted.

Bookstore continues for elite 512

It's Bookstore allright. 
Friday it was sunny. Saturday it snowed. And in case you didn't make it outside on Monday, it rained. But Bookstore Basketball is even more reli­able than the U.S. Post Office, espe­cially of late, braving the elements as the preliminary rounds continued yes­terday. 
"We scheduled the three major types of weather to see who really wanted to play," said Assistant Commissioner Tony McHale.

There were Screaming Midgets on Stepan courts and a human peanut but­ter and jelly sandwich on the Bookstore courts, but everywhere there were soggy players who played through the rain and puddles, and all for the glory of reaching the distinction of being one of the 512 best basketball teams on this campus.

"Although we expect to do well, we can never look past any team, especially one with a PGA pro as its' coach," O'Sullivan said. 
After Lewis College, the Irish participate in the competitive for a sloppy situation on the Bookstore courts, where Marv Mastro and the Human Peanut Butter and Jelly Sand­wich dropped their game with Fun With Kitchen Utensils, 21-4. 
"I've lost games for three years now," said Mastro, a senior, "and we decided not to worry about winning but instead go out with a bang and leave a good taste in people's mouths, so to speak." 
While Marv wore typical athletic garb, his cohorts dressed true to their name. One player covered himself with peanut butter, one with jelly and two attached pieces of bread on their clothes to create relative anarchy and an all-out mess. 
"Our basic strategy was for the peanut butter and jelly to clear out the lane by swinging appendages and creating wide-open layups," said the jelly, Dave Marcantuono. "We had to take breaks to reapply the substances, and the ball got pretty slick and hard to handle after awhile. 

"We appreciate the fact that most of the guys on the other team were cool about it," continued Marcantuono. "It was kind of pain for them."
