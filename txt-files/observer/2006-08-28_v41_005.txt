"The final ticket sale was 4,818, which is the highest number we've had," said senior Patrick Vassel, chair of The Show 2006 Committee. 
The goal for this year's Show, Vassel said, was to bring "two exciting, dynamic performers." 
"We brought bands that everybody wanted to go see, and that is reflected in the numbers, which. exceeded all expectations," he said. "If we had sold about 3,800, I would have been thrilled, so being at 4,800 is unbelievable." 
Students like sophomore Janeva Waked agreed that this year's Show benefited from fea­turing higher-profile perform­ers. 
"I think Third Eye Blind is more popular with Notre Dame students," Waked said. "Last year [when band Cake and Akon performed] my room­mate hadn't heard of either of them so she thought it was a band called 'Cakeakon. "' 
Sophomore Matthew Storey also said the band was more suited for Notre Dame stu­dents. 
"The typical Notre Dame stu­dent associates more with a Third Eye Blind-type of band," he said. 
What makes this year's Show even more impressive, Vassel said, is that neither Third Eye

Tess Murray only second female member inducted in group's history

At some point, political correctness and diction­aries mated, and words like policewoman, mail­woman and alumna were born. Now Notre Dame has a new gender­specific term to adopt ­Irish guardswoman. 
Competing against 33 other 6-foot-2 or taller hopefuls, junior Tess Murray marched her way to one of five open spots on this year's Irish Guard. She is the first female to do so since 2000's Molly Kinder and only the second in the Guard's 57-year history. 
As long as they meet the height requirement and "are willing to march," band director Ken Dye said, all candi­dates are welcomed ­meaning gender is not a

One student evades harm; another injured 
By MARY KATE MALONE News Editor 

Notre Dame Security/Police and South Bend Police are inves­tigating two off-campus inci­dents involving Notre Dame stu­dents that both took place during the first week of classes. 
At Turtle Creek Apartments, a man dressed in a service uni­form allegedly h-eld a junior Notre Dame student at knife­point Wednesday night. The female student allowed the man to enter her apartment around 
7:45 p.m. after he said he need­ed to look at her cable box, according to police. 

But after spending 10 minutes with him, the student, who wished to remain anonymous, grew frustrated and increasingly certain that "this guy wasn't supposed to be in my apart­ment." 
Within minutes, the man was holding a knife to the student's neck. 

"He said, 'If you scream, I'll kill you," she said. "I grabbed the knife, pushed his arm down and looked at him and said, 'What are you doing? What are you doing?"' ·

Anode to 

autulill1 
While the weather outside is still warm and very few trees have started changing color, Labor Day is only a week away, and that means the unoffi­cial start of the best season of them all -fall. 
Here are some 
Chris Khorey 
reasons to love the fall: 
1. It has two Associate names. Sports Editor Fall is the only season that is called by two different names. Some call it fall, after the leaves which FALL from the trees. Others prefer autumn, 
which is poetic-sounding. Fall is the season so nice, they named it twice! 
2. Nice weather. 
This may not be immediately appar­ent to some readers. After all, you say, isn't fall the season when it starts to get cold outside? Yes, it is, but who doesn't want relief from 90 degrees with high humidity and thunderstorms all the time? I'll take the 70-degree days of September and the crisp mornings of October, thank you. 
3. Falling leaves. 
Along with the changing weather come the beautiful changing leaves. Oranges, reds and yellows light up the quads, making our already pretty cam­pus stunning. (Note to students from other parts of the country: changing leaves are not, as you might suspect, a Notre Dame phenomenon. They are actually a yearly occurrence in the Midwest and Northeast. See what you're missing when you don't have four seasons?) 
4. Back to school. 
While during our childhoods, back to school was something to be dreaded, in college it's the best time of year. You finally get to be done with that boring summer job, get out of your parent's basement and come back to see all your friends under the Dome. Plus, school work isn't nearly as bad this time of year because you're motivated and ready to get good grades. Of course, this feeling will disappear by the Michigan game, but you won't find it at all in any season but fall. 
5. Football. · 
Of course, fall means football season, and the return of our beloved Fighting Irish. But Notre Dame home games aren't all there is. There are also great away game Saturdays when you turn the TV on at noon, and there's college football until2 a.m. There's pro football games on Sundays and Mondays, and there's even those Tuesday night Middle Tennessee. State vs. Central Michigan games where you know you should be studying but you can't help trying to figure out which team you should be rooting for to help Notre Dame's BCS chances. 
6. Baseball. 
Baseball may be a summer sport, but it really doesn't heat up until fall. That's when the pennant races really heat up and Bostonians, New Yorkers, Chicagoans and Cardinals fans (who come from all over for some reason) start to argue in the hallways while people from towns with losing clubs wonder what the big deal is.

Grad returns as adtninistrator 
By JOE PIARULLI 
News Writer 
Notre Dame graduate Todd Woodward, the man who helped launch and coordinate the "Got Milk?" ad cam­
paign, returned to his a I m a mater June 19 tO' take over the newly­


created 
Woodward

position of associate vice president for Mar-keting Communications. 
Woodward, an executive vice president for the public relations and communica­tions management firm Weber Shandwick, will be responsible for integrating communication channels in order to present a consistent message about Notre Dame. 
The only reason this role was not created earlier is because no one as qualified as Woodward had come along, said Hilary Crnkovich, vice president for Public Affairs and Communication. 
"The position itself, the need for someone to man­age products at an integrat­ed level, is something that has been under considera­tion for some time," she said. "The channels for communication have grown, and the need to integrate our message across chan­nels has become more important." 
Woodward's job is to use those channels -primarily Web, television and publica­tion -to make sure that the University is not sending out a fragmented message. 
Plenty of public knowledge exists about Notre Dame, Crnkovich said, so the goaJs now are to strengthen the University's messages and to keep them consistent. 
As a graduate, Woodward Hardware, Staples and Harley-Davidson. 
Before joining Weber Shandwick in 1997, Woodward held manage­ment positions with Prince Sports Group and Benetton Racquet Sports. 
"It's important to take a look not just at who he is as a person but where he's been in terms of his work," Crnkovich said. 
Woodward's background, however, does not mean that Notre Dame will be seen as a product like milk or motorcycles.

guardsmen. 

"Outside of [practice and games] we're all just like, really good friends," Martin said. "We have practice or places to be, so we end up getting food together and just hanging out. 
"I think Tess will be a part of that." 
The negative reaction surround­ing the selection of Kinder in 2000 has not occurred with Murray, Dye said. 
''I'm sure it raised some eye­brows," he said, "but it's different this time around." 
Known for their traditional Victory Clog dance, the 10 stone­faced, kilt-sporting Irish Guardsmen are responsible for leading the band from Main Building to the Stadium on football Saturdays. They practice nightly with the band, and the two groups tried out together beginning Aug. 17. 
Elizabeth Cuda, a senior saxo­phone player, observed Murray's audition and said she was "a step above the rest." 
"She put more passion and energy into [her audition]," Cuda said. "I think that put her over the edge. You could tell she really wanted it. 
"I talked to others afterwards, and we had no doubt that she was going to make the Guard." 
So she can talk the talk -but can she walk the walk? 
Easily. Murray was a member of the band herself during her fresh­man and sophomore years, so rhythmic marching isn't new to her. Senior saxophone player Gary Pritts said Murray was "clearly one of the best marchers," and Martin echoed those statements 
"She was one of the better marchers out there," Martin said. "That's why she made it." 
Being a member of the Irish Guard is more than marching, thdugh, Dye said. 
"You have to have a knack for rhythm, a flow, a style. There's a stature that's involved with being a guard," he said. "It's a unique style of marching." 
Some of the others vying for the spots lacked that ability, senior clar­inets leader Justin Hendricks said. 
"To be honest, Tess really stood out," he said. "There were definitely a lot of guys who could just not march to the beat, frankly." 
When selecting the new members of the group, returning Irish guardsmen evaluate the candidates, said senior Kevin Coleman, captain of the Irish Guard. 
"Every year the tryouts are judged on physical appearance, stature and marching ability," said senior Kevin Coleman, captain of the Irish Guard. 'The band directors then have final say as to who makes the Guard." 
Dye then leads a six-member band staff through another evalua­tion process, to "come to some kind of collective decision," he said. 
Murray ranked highly, according to Dye. 
"Their evaluation of Tess was a strong one," he said. "She was extremely well-prepared .... She did a good job." 
Hendricks embraced the decision to select a guardswoman. 
"I thought it was really cool when it happened before -I'm excited that it's my senior year and it's hap­pening again," he said. "I hope that she does a great job and it's some­thing that can continue."

New-adlllinistrators settle in,lllake plans for Saint Mary's 
By KATIE KOHLER 
News Writer 
. 
The beginning of the new aca­demic year brought with it sev­eral new administrators to Saint Mary's, filling the empty vice president of Student Affairs and vice president and dean of facul­ty offices. 
College President Carol Ann Mooney and the recruitment search committee at Saint Mary's welcomed Jill Vihtelic, J9seph Incandela, Deborah McCarthy and Karen Johnson to their new roles. 
The first position Mooney filled was that of acting vice president and dean of faculty when faculty members selected Vihtelic late last spring to fill the position for one year. 
"Jill has been a valued, trust­ed, and indispensable member of the campus community for years," Mooney said. "Her deci­sions are thoughtful and based on her deep love for the College and extensive knowledge of it." 
For Vihtelic, her transition goal is simple. 
"I hope to make changes that will smooth the transition for the next vice president and dean of faculty," she said.

Incandela, who received his doctorate from Princeton University, is now responsible for directing the general education programs at the College. Incandela left his position in the Theology department at Saint Mary's for the new role. 
McCarthy now directs the Center for Academic Innovation at Saint Mary's. Her responsibili­ties include developing new cur­riculum and academic programs and facilitating grant proposals for academic endeavors. 
McCarthy said she would be coordinating with the directors of Saint Mary's Center for Spirituality and Center for InterCultural Leadership as well. 
"I will be working closely with the directors of the other Centers for Distinction to foster synergy in our programs," she said. 
Both Incandela and McCarthy have several goals they wish to accomplish during their three­year terms.

Iraqi PM addresses latest violence 
BAGHDAD, Iraq -A wave of bomb attacks and shootings swept Iraq Sunday, killing dozens of people despite a massive security operation in the capital and appeals from Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki for an end to sectarian lighting. 
Al-Maliki insisted that his government was making progress in combatting attacks by insurgents and sectarian clashes between Shiites and Sunnis. 
"We're not in a civil war. Iraq will never be in a civil war," he said through an interpreter on CNN's "Late Edition." "The violence is in decrease and our security ability is increas­ing." 
Asked about U.S. allegations that Iran is sup­porting Iraqi groups involved in sectarian vio­lence, al-Maliki said the reports were being investigated. IIe said Iraqi authorities were in contact with Iran in order to determine the veracity of the information "and to prevent this interference."

Rumsfeld climbed down a steel ladder into one of 10 silos that house single 54-foot-long missile interceptors.

IN BRIEF 
Ohio, Indiana vie to supply Honda 
GREENSBURG, Ind. -Economic develop­ment officials in Indiana and Ohio who com­peted for a $550 million auto assembly plant that Honda Motor Co. announced in June would be built in southeastern Indiana are now engaged in another battle. 
The two states are vying to attract auto suppliers that would make parts for the Greensburg plant, which will employ 2,000 workers and eventually produce 200,000 vehicles annually. 
Honda plans to spend $1.5 billion each year to provide resources to that plant. 
Indiana Commerce Secretary Mickey Maurer said he and Gov. Mitch Daniels are eager for Indiana to beat out Ohio in this next round of Honda-related growth. 
"We're going to be very aggressive," Maurer told The Indianapolis Star for a Sunday story. 
Ohio has been Honda's U.S. manufacturing home since 1982, and it now operates an 11 ,000-worker car-making hub in west-cen­tral Ohio. 
Embattled charity returns to Indiana 
FORT WAYNE, Ind. -A charitable founda­tion investigated by attorneys general in two states after it relocated to Las Vegas is returning to the city where it was formed. 
Indiana Attorney General Steve Carter announced Friday that incorporation papers had been filed in Indiana for the Olin B. and Desta Schwab Foundation, which was found­ed in Fort Wayne 17 years ago. 
"This brings the dream of Mr. Schwab back to its roots," Carter said. "This is an impor­tant date ... for the Schwab Foundation." 
The foundation was investigated after The Journal Gazette reported last year that the charity had purchased a $1.5 million, three­bedroom home in a gated Las Vegas commu­nity that the foundation president used as a retirement home before his death. 
After the purchase was exposed, Carter and his Nevada counterpart sued the foun­dation, seized its assets and removed its board members. 
California cond-os cause concern 
Environmentalists clash with developers over new national trend in real estate 
Associated Press 
ENCINITAS, Calif. -On a sandy bluff overlooking the Pacific, surfer Mark Massara sees a developing threat to a Calil'ornia amenity: guaranteed beach access for average families. 
Luxury hotel builders are hovering over the coastline, hoping to expand California's shores the nationwide trend of devel­opments split between high-priced hotel rooms and privately owned condo­miniums. 
Where developers see opportunity in "condo hotels," Massara and oth­ers see a legal loophole that lets private buyers snap up parts of the coast which are supposed to remain public. And that, he fears, will make getting to the beach harder. 
In this low-key northern San Diego County surf town, dunes and ice plants are being cleared from land designated for public use to make way for 100 condos that will sell for an estimated $1.5 million each and 30 hotel rooms that will go for up to $600 a night.

in a Sept. 27, 2004 article. 
A new road east of campus, North Twyckenham Drive, now begins off Edison west of Ivy Road and merges into Ivy between Vaness Street and Dunn Road. Moving west, it intersects Bulla Road at a stop­light and runs behind the Fischer Graduate Residences, meeting Douglas Road at a traf­fic roundabout. 
This north-south connection between Edison Road and Douglas Road is helping to "move traffic very well," Lyphout said. 
"Particularly with the roads project, [campus construction] was pretty much wrapped up by the time school started," )1e said. "The target completion date had 'been the end of this calendar year." 
Work was also finished on Douglas Road itself, with the addition of a large roundabout at the Twyckenham-Douglas intersection. 
"The only comment I've heard is that Bulla Road no longer goes through," Lyphout said. "It terminates at Twyckenham. Otherwise, [the campus roads project] has gotten really good reviews."

"I thought it was the best Show I've been to," jun­ior Katie Smith said. "Compared to other concerts the pricing was very reasonable, especially for seeing a band like Third Eye Blind who's pretty well-known." 
The pricing also impressed freshman Steve Bold, who said he wouldn't have been surprised to pay five times as much for a show like this. 
"I know for other concerts you can pay around 50 dollars or more for a ticket," he said."So at ten dollars a ticket these were consultation with area residents who expressed concern about keeping traflic out of the neigh­borhood, Lyphout said. 

"We had to ofl'er the neighbor­hood something and they want­ed less traflie going through," he said. "It doesn't really incon­venience anyone." 
There are still a few compo­nents of the project left unfin­ished, like the area in front of Library Circle. 
"There are planters that we use as barricades now [in front of Library Circle]," Lyphout said. "Next summer that'll change, and we will scrape up the old Juniper Road. We didn't want to create that kind of inconven­ience during the school year." 
Besides taking up the road .. Lyphout said "some new infra­structure" needs to be put in place as well. 
Phase One of the project was completed last summer when Edison Road and Route 23 were widened and a large portion of Edison was demolished and realigned. A four-lane north­south road could be created where Edison met Ivy Road. 
The campus roads project also included the construction of a newly expanded and reconfig­ured campus entrance on Notre Dame Avenue, which was com­pleted in June 2005.

The seating arrangements dif­fered from previous years, Vassel said, allowing for floor seating that eliminated standing-only sections divided by barricades for a "more intimate concert feel." 
Attendees like freshman Kim Kristofl' appreciated the change. 
"I liked the setup," she said. "Wherever you were, you had a good seat and could hear the bands really well."

A little over two decades ago, much of this student body emerged from the womb itching for the start of a potential national championship run by the Fighting Irish. As our fathers clipped our umbilical cords with Notre Dame Bookstore-issued scissors and our nurses swathed us in "Play Like a Champion Today" towels, the greatest fight song in the land was undoubtedly echoing in the backs of our undeveloped, spongy minds. It is even rumored that the first words of a few particularly pre­scient and potty-mouthed students were, "Notre Dame will kick the s*** out of Georgia Tech on September 2, · 2006." 
Now, in only six days, that magic moment will finally arrive, and the entire universe will discover whether or not this year's squad can live up to the hype purveyed by Sports Illustrated, Sports Illustrated On Campus, ESPN, ESPN the Magazine, ESPN.com, SportingNews, CBS Sportsline, the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Tribune, the South Bend Tribune, USA Today, Yahoo! Sports, Scout.com, Rivals.com, CNN, MSNBC, NPH, ABC News, NBC Sports, Fox Sports, Sports Digest, CSTV, the Los Angeles Times, the San Jose Mercury News, the Atlanta Journal Constitution, the Seattle Post Intelligencer and Live! With Regis and Kelly. 
Because of the intense anticipation and speculation about the upcoming football season, there has been a lot of fictional information swirling through­out the media about Charlie Weis' team. In fact, several loyal readers have been littering my inbox all sum-

mer with questions about this hype. So today, we will separate the fact from the fiction. 
Kate O'McFitzgerald of Lyons Hall asks, "Is it true that Brady Quinn was born of a vestal virgin?" 
Yes, Kate. A perfectly sculpted body like that doesn't just pop out of a fallop­ian tube. In fact, it is rumored that the Holy Spirit was only in Dublin, Ohio, on that fateful day back in 1984 because He wanted to ask Wendy's world head­quarters why they didn't make square buns to fit their delicious square burg­ers. Apparently, the munificent Mrs. Quinn gave the Divine Inseminator directions along the way, and He rewarded her womb with the second coming of the Lord and Savior. Just watch out when this kid turns thirty. 
Moses McGillicuddy of Stanford Hall wonders, "If the entire Georgia Tech football team falls over in a forest and no one is listening, do they make a noise?" 
Great question, Moses. Believe it or not, they do actually make a noise when they fall: the same pathetic, high­pitched squeal that a pig makes after it waddles into a bacon factory. 
Shy Shillingham from off-campus asks, "I heard that Charlie Weis drinks the blood of a dozen lambs before he enters the locker room on game-day. Is that true? And if so, why did the University ofWashington still go 2-9 last year?" 
Well, Shy, I'm not too sure what the Washington Huskies football team, led by former Irish coach Ty Willingham, has to do with your question, but some­one must have been pulling your leg when they told you that one. According to Weis' personal chef, Wolfgang Puck, Charlie has a very specific routine for eating and drinking prior to every game. He starts the morning off with a 128-ounce porterhouse steak and a Colt 
45. For lunch, he rides his noble steed into the woods behind St. Mary's College, spears a wild boar, skins the ferocious beast with a plastic butter knife, eats the great pig raw and picks his teeth afterward with the animal's tusks. To wash it down, he spikes St. Joseph's Lake with a thousand bottles of Bacardi 151 and drinks the entire body of water with a thimble. Only then does he begin strategizing for the after­noon's game. 
Mas an Asmallah of Keough Hall writes, "My brother who still lives in Baghdad tells me that the United States did actually find weapons of mass destruction when they invaded Iraq. Is it true that those WMDs were in fact the guns of Tom Zbikowski?" 
Another great question, Masan. I actually had to put in a call to General Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to find out this answer, and much to my surprise, you were absolutely correct. Buried deep within a labyrinth of winding tunnels that was discovered under Saddam's most sacred palace, a group of Army Rangers stum­bled upon a sealed hyperbaric chamber which contained the Iraqi leader's most dangerous weapons. Sitting there, in between a large container of anthrax and a tube of enriched plutonium, was the Irish safety and kick returner. 
Sadly, we have run out of space, but hopefully some of the greatest myths about the Fighting Irish have been debunked. For answers to any other questions that were not addressed here about Brady Quinn, Charlie Weis or other Notre Dame football stars, please refer to the Gospel of John, Chapter 3, Verse 16.

Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) and Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) aim to discourage online gaming by amending the Wire Act of 1961 with their bill, H.R.4411. In Rep. Leach's own words, "What the [bill] basically does is make it illegal to use a bank instrument such as a credit card or money transfer or check to settle an Internet wager." What he fails to mention is that the bill only cov­ers certain types of Internet wagers. 
Goodlatte would like people to believe he is the noble leader of some moral crusade to save Americans from the supposed evils of online gaming. H.R.4411 is the latest in a series of mis­guided attempts stretching back almost 10 years; this one has unfortunately passed the U.S. House of Representatives, however, and Sen. Jon Kyl (R­Ariz.) is eager to pass similar legislation in the upper chamber. 
Support for this bill is lukewarm at best, while its opposition is intense. A fringe issue appealing to some groups, the ban faces organized resist­ance from financial institutions and Internet service providers who do not want to be slapped with these new regulations. Goodlatte and Leach point to amateur and professional sports leagues that are pleased with the bill, but these groups are some of its biggest beneficiaries. 
Fantasy sports leagues, state lotteries and horse racing are given generous exceptions and would continue to be legal under the bill. In fact, the bill's proponents defeated an amendment proposed by Shelley Berkley (D-Nev.) that would  remove these hypocritical carve-outs. If online gaming is such a problem for America, why is there cherry-picking that allows certain forms to remain legal? Certainly the people who place bets on football games are the same ones in the fantasy sport leagues; why is Powerball better than a roulette ball? 
One part of the answer can be found among Goodlatte's campaign contributors. 
The National Thoroughbred Racing Association PAC has given Goodlatte $15,000 over the last three years. When this bill was written, Goodlatte appears to have been rather concerned with helping special interests by giving the powerful ones exemptions so they wouldn't oppose his bill. 
The good news is that a vast majority of Americans are opposed to government attempts to regulate too deeply into our personal lives. A Zogby poll conducted in March of over 30,000 likely voters found that 78 percent of Americans "do not think it is appropriate for the federal gov­ernment to restrict what adults do on the Internet in the privacy of their own homes." 
By allowing online gaming sites to legally base their operations in the United States, the govern­ment could make online gaming even safer through regulation and tax a portion of the $6 billion wagered online last year by Americans. The United Kingdom has recently done this with great success; publicly traded companies provide regulated and secure gaming services to people around the planet who seek entertainment in the comfort of their own homes. 
Playing politics with such sweeping public poli­cy is never a good thing for America. Although considering Sen. Ted Stevens' (R-Alaska) "series of tubes" comments about the Internet, it is ques­tionable whether many of our policymakers in Washington, D.C. understand the Internet at all. Until they do, citizens should be outraged by attempts to pass such fallacious legislation, and they should let their representatives hear about it.

MOVIE REVIEW 

Inspiring sports movie not exactly 'Invincible' 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Editor 
For better and for worse, "Invincible" is the picture-perfect sports movie. It rev­els in its cliches, its honesty, its uplifting message. Yet those very ingredients make "Invincible" an agreeably pleasant film for those willing to overlook its shortcomings. 
Every single sports movie cliche is there, from the determined coach to the doubting friends, to the rival-teammate­turned-friend, to the "Big Game" 

that ends the film. Invincible Kinnear shines in It proudly features 
his considerable the most ubiqui­screentime as tous moments of Vermeil. "Miracle," "Rocky" The film is as pre­and "Rudy" all Director: Ericson Core dictable as they rolled into one. In Writer: Brad Gann come, but that isn't fact, "Invincible" is Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Greg necessarily a bad almost like a Kinnear and Elizabeth Banks thing. The film is 
sports-movie-by­numbers, as thor­oughly quintessential as they come. "Invincible" is filled with cliches in a genre dominated by them. Yet the film gets by on sheer conviction, anchored by winning performances from Mark Wahlberg, Greg Kinnear and Kevin Conway. 
"Invincible" is the true story of Vincent Papale (Wahlberg) a teacher-turned-bar­tender who becomes a professional NFLer after new coach Dick Vermeil (Kinnear) takes over as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles and allows an open tryout for the team. 
Like a pro football "Rudy," it follows an overage underdog who successfully pur­inspirational in all 
the right ways, and its heart is clearly in the right place. For the most part, this is enough, though there are obvious problems. 
Foremost is that "Invincible" feels oddly underdeveloped, despite a full­length running time. It doesn't help that the ending feels abrupt rather than satis­fying, which is particularly unexpected since the film has such a strong build-up to the rousing conclusion. 
Additionally, most of the characters are only sketchily drawn, though the cast does its best to round them out. Papale himself is held at s strange distance, without the type of psychological charac­ter insight usually imbued in films like sues his dream. Along the way, he falls in love with fellow bartender Janet Cantwell (Elizabeth Banks) and has. a heart-to-heart with his crusty old father Frank Papale (a surprisingly elegant Kevin Conway). 
Like most movies of this type, it's not really necessary to be a fan of the team in order to enjoy the film. The film isn't really about the Eagles, though the Philadelphia backdrop is crucial to the movie's setting Oust as it was in "Rocky"). Whether the Eagles are beloved or hated, "Invincible" is more about Vincent Papal~;J than the team, though

and controversial 2000 decision that awarded the presi­dency to current Commander-in-Chief George W. Bush, Gore retreated from the limelight to reflect on his dashed dreams and decide what his next move would be. 
For the next several months, the public got brief glimpses of the former vice president, and the image wasn't a posi­tive one. Gore seemed to have lost his way and gained a beard. That's when his wife, Tipper, urged him to travel with his slideshow again -a presentation that focused on the immediacy of global warming and the human race's part in the destruction of the earth. Gore had traveled often with the slideshow before he became vice president. 

The environment has been Gore's choice issue since his college days -an issue he took with him to Congress and an issue that was lost among the chaos of Decision 2000. 
With this documentary, Gore resurrects the global warming debate to convert the doubters, those who believe that global warming is a myth and part of the natu­ral cycle of the environment. Gore pres­ents scientific proof to convince the non­believer otherwise, and he does so with­out elitism. Instead, the film offers the facts in a clear and captivating

follows the rocky 
journey of one man with one giant passion. We learn about Gore's childhood and public life throughout the film as he expresses his undying love for the environment. 
Gore shows us the land where he grew up and lets us listen to the sounds of insects, animaJs and running waters that were so familiar to him as a boy. He shows us a view of Mother Earth from outer space and allows us to reflect on its beauty. He then explains how this beauty will be lost if we continue our current path of destruction. Polar ice caps will melt and entire cities will be immersed in water. 
These are not hypotheses. These are terrifying truths about the future we are creating for ourselves. 
He takes us through his days as a Congressman and his sometimes fruitless attempts at changing the minds and hearts of Congress. We see moments from his campaign and the disappointing aftermath. 
His need to feature so much of his per­sonal life was a wise choice. In order to understand his devotion to this cause, we must understand how he arrived at the place where he was ready to share his message with the world. 
AI Gore will not run for president in 2008. After seeing this documentary, a persDn will realize that this AI Gore ­the one that can focus on one cause -is a more effective AI Gore. By creating "An Inconvenient Truth" and continuing his talks around the country, he is able to accomplish more by honing in on one, singular issue. 
This free and charismatic Gore, unre­stricted by election polls and a speech writing staff, can make a film that changes global warming from a political issue to a moral obligation. Gore can make the environment exciting again and renew .our commitment to Mother Earth and ou'r future.

this. 
Part of the problem may be in the film's focus. Shots of picket lines and unem­ployed workers gives the impression that Papale stands as a sort of "everyman" who represents the poorer Philadelphia workers, but not enough is made of this. In fact, the protagonist, as a character, has a bizarre lack of balance. Papale is at once too complex to be a symbol and too underdeveloped to be an intriguing character. 
Additionally, the direction and cine­matography from Ericson Core (ih his directorial debut) has a workman-like feel to it, though the over reliance on slick camerawork and editing during the football sequences is dizzying rather than thrilling. 
Still, "Invincible" is a simple yet increasingly rare thing -a good story well told. It has to be taken on its own terms, but once those terms are accepted are accepted, the film works. This in of itself is an accomplishment, albeit a minor one. 
"Invincible" is certainly a film worth seeing for anyone who wants to be inspired, who believes in a man who overcame the odds to become an Eagle and fly.

THIRD EYE BLIND REVIEW 
By ELIZABETH HESBURGH and 
MARY MIGLIOZZI 
Scene Critics 
Third Eye Blind may not be as popular now as it was 10 years ago, but its former '90s fame was enough to fill the Joyce Center Fieldhouse Friday night when the band performed exclusively for Notre Dame, St. Mary's and Holy Cross students. Based in San Francisco, Third Eye Blind is made up of lead singer Stephan Jenkins, Kevin Cadogan on guitar, bassist Arion Salazar and former Counting Crows drummer Brad Hargreaves. As they came on stage and began the concert with one of their most fun and upbeat hit singles, "Never Let You Go," a black banner unfurled behind them bearing the band's name in large block letters. The students went wild, jumping, dancing and singing along. 
A band that saw the height of its popu­larity in the late '90s, Third Eye Blind wisely chose to play numerous songs from its self-titled 1997 debut album. This deci­sion seemed to be greeted with approval by an audience that remembered the days when Third Eye Blind was essentially the soundtrack to summer. 
The college age group proved to be the ideal audience for songs like "Jumper." When the band played this well-known anti-suicide anthem, the crowd sang along not only to the vocal part, but also to the catchy and memorable guitar solo, which was extended to make the number per­haps the best in the show. 
Newer songs, such as "Palm Reader," from the 2003 album "Out of the Vein" ­"Deep Inside of You," from "Blue." 

True, Third Eye Blind has faded a bit from popular attention and the pop/rock music scene. Jenkins expressed his disap­pointment at one point in the concert that the band's fans had not been showing the same support as they once did. Or the fact that its album in 2003 and its July released greatest hits album entitled, "A Collection" have not sold as well as it had hoped. 
However, in closing, Jenkins told the crowd, "It's great to come here and feel this warmth. It's a really good feeling." 
This warmth was especially apparent as they played the final song, the hit from summer of 1997, "Semi-Charmed Life" 
.·

which clearly received the wildest response of all the performances of the night. 
At the end of the night, Third Eye Blind left a contented audience at The Show. Its performance contained a solid collection of a few new songs and mostly old songs that have not lost their effect on an audi­ence that grew up to them.

COMMON REVIEW 
By CASSIE BELEK Assistant Scene Editor 
Common delivered a performance with­out awkward pauses Friday night, but not without awkward moments. 
Opening to a packed and energized crowd, the Chicago-based rapper brought his unique hip-hop sounds to the Joyce Center with a touch of dirty dancing. 
Rapping, "Never looking back or too far in front of me, the present is a gift and I just wannabe," Common started off strong and kept his momentum going throughout the performance by offering multiple sur­prises to both established fans and new lis­teners. 
With most of his set consisting of songs from his 2005 album "Be," Common was truly living in the moment, expressing excitement for being at Notre Dame and ­sharing his love and gratitude for God in his life. 
Common, a socially conscious rapper with a penchant for integrating '70s soul and soul-jazz into his music, got the crowd riled up early, opening with songs from his latest album, including "Be," "The Comer," "Go!," "Faithful," "Testify" and "It's Your World," before transitioning into his older songs like "Ghetto Heaven." Few in the crowd were completely familiar with his music, but most were enthused and inter­active anyway. 
Common continually reinforced his advice to have faith in God, crediting God and his Aunt's advice with his success. His other words of wisdom included remaining while certainly enjoyable, were met by a significantly less animated response, even bordering on boredom at times. Still, it proved a valuable and entertaining addi­tion to a show that otherwise would have run the risk of being little more than a walk down memory lane. 
The members of the band showed skill as experienced live performers, especially guitarist Tony Fredianelli, who delighted the crowd with his solos. Jenkins found the right balance in terms of crowd inter­action, introducing and inviting audience reaction to some songs, but didn't overdo it. 
During one performance, Jenkins strode down the center aisle of the audience as students reached out to touch the famous rocker, giving the students in the far risers a closer look. 
Guitarist Kevin Cadogan also once ven­tured down the aisle. Evidently, Cadogan had made a trip to the Notre Dame book­store that day as he wore a t-shirt bear­ing an ND leprechaun throughout the performance, much to the delight and appreciation of the Notre Dame students. 
One of the strengths of Third Eye Blind's music comes from an ironic ability to effectively combine songs of greatly vary­ing moods, and even to combine moods within a single song, as in the somber yet oddly buoyant "Jumper." 
The band certainly did this exceptionally well in its choices for Friday's show, play­ing both the decidedly sorrowful "How's It Going to Be" and the ecstatically upbeat "Semi-Charmed Life," its most well-known song, right before leaving the stage at the end of the set. For an encore, it chose to again alter the mood with the pensive 
faithful in relationships. He called out the infidelities of the men in the audience, but didn't let the women go unscathed either. 
During a particularly touching moment, Common dedicated a song to his good friend and producer Jay Dee (a.k.a. J Dilla), who passed away in February of this year. Jay Dee, who was diagnosed with Lupus and TTP, a rare blood disease, produced for other artists such as The Roots,_ De La Soul, Busta Rhymes and Erykah Badu. 
Halfway through his set, Common took a breather and let OJ Dummy take over, say­ing that the soul and origin of hip-hop is DJing. After a tribute to early hip-hop with Dr. Ore's "Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang," DJ Dummy spun Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock's "It Takes Two" during a fascinating but long performance. Cameras above him allowed the audience to see his master­work, a service he's provided for Kanye West, Talib Kweli and Mos Def. 
At one point, Common asked for a lady from the audience who was "open." After some innocent flirtation, the dancing between the two g_uickly became sugges­tive and then raunchy. The volunteer and the audience seemed in shock at how far Common took his dancing, especially after preaching to the audience about faith and God. It was a complete about-face, and set Common up for criticism for this blatant contradiction. 
Despite his faults and perhaps too much preaching, Common delivered a solid and exciting performance that had the Joyce Center dancing, screaming and getting familiar with a musician many did not know. 

"I think he's a talented and poetic rapper. I don't know very many of his songs, but I was pleasantly surprised by his perform­ance," sophomore Kristina Merz said. 
Yet there were others who disagreed, particularly those who came primarily to see Third Eye Blind. 
"When I think Common, I think 'Comm on!"' sophomore Dannis Rankin said. 
However, Common was a vast improve­ment on last year's The Show rapper Akon. With five Grammy nominations under his belt and one Grammy win, Common proved that he is worthy of rapping with the likes of Kanye West. To close his set, he urged the audience to support good music -music by Kanye, Nas, Talib Kweli and Jay-Z, among others. Through his music, Common campaigns to move hip-hop away from gangster rap toward social issues. He pleaded his case to an eager crowd on Friday, but came away with mixed reac­tions after a somewhat hypocritical, but quality performance.

PGA TOUR 
Associated Press 

AKRON, Ohio -Tiger Woods celebrated his 10­year anniversary of turn­ing pro Sunday by win­ning for the 52nd time on the PGA Tour, making an 8-foot birdie putt on the fourth playoff hole against Stewart Cink to win the Bridgestone Invitational. 
Woods won for the fourth straight time, a streak that began at the British Open and shows no sign of ending. 
This one looked to be in doubt, however. when Cink made up a three-shot deficit over the final three holes, then had Woods on the ropes the first three holes of the playoff. But with rain pounding Firestone South, Cink hit into a bunker on the 17th hole, and never got a chance to putt for par 

when Woods  made  his  
birdie.  
Both  finished  at  10­ 
under 270.  

Woods won for the fifth time in the seven years this World Golf Champion­ship has been played at Firestone, and he now has won more on this track than any other golf course on the PGA Tour. Woods has won four times each at Augusta National and Torrey Pines. 
It was on Aug. 27, 1996, that Woods announced in 
IN BRIEF 

Ramirez sits out another 
game with sore knee 
SEATTLE -All-Star Manny Ramirez was out of Boston's starting lineup for the third time in four games Sunday as the Red Sox closed out a series against the Seattle Mariners. 
Manager Terry Francona also said that left-bander Jon Lester would not make his scheduled start on Monday night in Oakland and instead would be sent back to Boston for further examination on his sore back. 
Ramirez played in Saturday night's 4-3 loss to the Mariners and was 0­for-3. The outfielder told Francona his right knee was sore Sunday morning. 
"I don't think it's a setback," Francona said before Sunday's game. "I think it was bothering him during the game. "We were hoping a couple of days off would be enough." 
Ramirez started in left field on Saturday after missing the previous two games. 
Milwaukee he was turning pro. Ten years later, his 52 victories match Byron Nelson for fifth place all time, and his 12 majors are second only to the 18 won by Jack Nicklaus over a quarter-century. 
Cink was looking for a peculiar repeat. 
Two years ago, he vali­dated Hal Sutton's deci­sion to make him a cap­tain's pick for the Ryder Cup by winning at Firestone. Tom Lehman picked him on Monday, and Cink nearly delivered his first victory in two years. 
"There were a lot of highs and lows today," Cink said. "Unfortunately, 
Monday, August 28, 2006 
I finished on a low." 
Cink had a shot to win on the first three playoff holes -a 20-foot chip that grazed the lip at No. 18, an 18-foot putt that missed on the high side at No. 17, and an 8-foot par putt on the 18th again that missed to the right. 
Woods was in trouble most of the time. On the first extra hole, he pulled his approach long and left into the rough, but pitched beautifully to 5 feet and escaped with par. The second time playing the 18th in the playoff, Woods found a greenside bunker 40 feet from the flag. blasted out to 8 feet and left it inches short. 

Jets' four-way quarterback
battle still not over 

HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. -Even though the regular season is two weeks away, Jets'coach Eric Mangini insists he has­n't chosen a starting quarterback. 
Those who thought Mangini would finally choose between Chad Pennington, Patrie~ Ramsey, Brooks Bollinger and rookie Kellen Clemens on Sunday were disappointed. 
"All four of those guys need to be ready to play Friday," Mangini said, referring to the preseason finale against Philadelphia. "That's the way we're going to approach the week with all the players. They need to be ready to play for as long as we decide to keep them in the game." 
Asked if he might not announce a starter even in the days before the Sept. 10 opener at the Tennessee Titans, Mangini said, "It would depend on whether someone has dis­tinguished himself by the time we get to Tennessee." 
Team USA defeats Australia 
by 40 in FlBA play 
AITAMA, Japan -Look out, world. The United States routed Australia 113­73 Sunday, sending an unmistakable message to the FIBA World Championship. This isn't the team that proved an embarrassment in recent international competitions. 
"We wanted to make a statement coming into the round of 16," said for­ward Chris Bosh, who grabbed a game­high nine rebounds. 
On a day that every American scored, Carmelo Anthony led the U.S. with 20 points while Joe Johnson added 18 and Dwyane Wade 15. 
Granted, the Australians weren't much of a test. They went 2-3 in group play and have few weapons beside Milwaukee Bucks center Andrew Bogut, who scored 20 points. 
But the Americans made it look almost too easy, turning a tight game into a Iaugher by outscoring the Australians 32-6 in the second quarter.

Ochoa shoots seven under for Wendy's title 
Golfer birdies 13th and 14th holes to beat out Lee in the stretch 
Associated Press 

DUBLIN, Ohio-If Lorena Ochoa keeps this up, soccer soon might be ·taking a back seat to women's golf in Mexico. 
Ochoa outdueled Jee Young Lee down the stretch, pulling away with birdies at the 13th and 14th holes, to shoot a 7­under 65 and win the Wendy's Championship for Children by three shots Sunday. 
"In Mexico, soccer is every­thing. Golf is, like, 1 percent," the Guadalajara native said with a laugh. "I feel fortunate to have so much support. It's been great. I'm very proud to be from 

Fo.r rnore illfonnati:on o:n au:y course, call J-6886. 
Mexico. We're learning.... It used to be soccer, soccer, soccer. Now there's also golf." 
Ochoa and Lee, playing in the same group. were tied at 22 under through 12 holes. 
"It was like match piay," Ochoa said. "It was a different feeling, to look at the scoreboard and see everybody else three or four shots behind." 
But Ochoa hit an 8 iron to 6 feet and rolled in the birdie putt at 13 and then spun a wedge near the hole at 14 and made the 15-footer to regain a two­shot lead. She was never threat­ened again as she parred out to finish at 24-under 264. 
Only three players have gone lower in a 72-hole LPGA event in relation to par. Two are Hall of Famers, and the third almost certainly will be: Annika Sorenstam (27 under), Karrie Webb (26) and Se Ri Pak (25). 
Lee, a rookie who began the day two shots back of Ochoa in second p"lace, had five birdies, an eagle and no bogeys in her first 13 holes-and still trailed. 
"I don't think I lost today," she said. "I enjoyed playing against a great player, a top player. I didn't play bad. She played bet­ter. I learned a lot today." 
The victory was the 24-year­old Ochoa's third of the season on the LPGA Tour. She also has five seconds, a third, two fourths and a fifth-place finish in 18 starts. 
The $165,000 first-place check raised Ochoa's earnings this year to $1,840,774, moving her past Karrie Webb and into first place on the money list. 
"That's the highest profession­al goal you can accomplish," Ochoa said. "But right now it doesn't mean anything. I have to go all the way to November. That would be a dream to accomplish." 
Ochoa, who leads the tour in scoring average, has shot 66 or better 12 times this season. 
With earlier rounds of 67, 68 and 64, Ochoa had the lowest 72-hole total on a par-72 course this year by five strokes. She didn't have a bogey in the final two rounds while going 15 under. 
"I played a great round of golf -I didn't really make any mis­takes," Prammanasudh said. "You knew she (Ochoa) was going to go out there and play a great round, just based on her career." 
After rolling in an uphill 5­footer for par on the final hole, Ochoa pumped her fist and then acknowledged the gallery sur­rounding the green at Tartan Fields Golf Club. 
Ai Miyazato shot a 68 and was alone in fourth at 271, with Diana D'Alessio (67) next at 273. Tied for sixth at 13-under 275 were Jeong Jang (67), Webb (69) and Michele Redman (70). 
Defending champion Cristie Kerr closed with a 70 and was at 276 along with Tina Barrett (68) and Morgan Pressel (69). 

Paula Creamer was on the leaderboard all day until she sliced her approach at the final hole underneath the grandstand. Arter a lengthy delay during which she looked over her options and discussed the situa­tion with her caddie and a rules ollicial, she chipped short of the green and ended up with a dou­ble bogey that gave her a 72 and left her at 11-under 277.

While Martin accepted his bad fortune, car owner Jack Roush was crestfallen over the ill-timed falter. This"is sup­posed to be Martin's last full­time season of Cup racing (but so was last year) and Roush would do anything to give his longtime driver a shot to final­ly win a championship. 
"My heart is heavy for Mark Martin," Roush said. "He's 1Oth in the points right now. .Certainly we're in jeopardy there." 
But so is Earnhardt, who pushed his team hard all weekend after they unloaded a noncompetitive car. Terrible in practice and qualifying, Earnhardt sulked and stomped until the DEI crew figured things out. 
In rallying to his third-place finish, Earnhardt moved off the bubble and up a spot into ninth place to give himself just a little bit of breathing room. 
"I think we have a really good shot at it now," he said. "Before, it was 50-50 up for grabs between me and Kasey Kahne. But I feel like we are in a better position."

the first ball was served, the jit­ters were gone," Kaelin said. 
The Falcons threatened in the second game after the first went almost entirely in Notre Dame's favor. With the score 25-23 in Bowling Green's favor, the Irish sparked a 7-3 run after a Kaelin kill to take the 2­0 lead in the match. 
The late rally was capped by an enormous kill on the outside by sophomore Mallorie Croal. Croal received the set on the left side and blasted a strike past a diving Falcon defender against the left sideline for the game-point. 
"In both the second and third games we had a couple rota­tions where our passing broke down a little bit," Irish head coach Debbie Brown said. "We just managed to maintain com­posure and not get frazzled with anything, then slowly chip away and come back." 
Notre Dame also pushed its way back from a small deficit midway through the third game behind a series of Kaelin kills, a number of blocks from fresh­man Tara Enzweiler and a service ace from junior Ashley Tarutis. 
Kaelin was able to secure the match-point with the score 29­26 on an outside blast that deflected off a Falcon hitter and out of bounds in the direc­tion of the media tables. 
"We're not used to playing with each other right now ­for sure not as smooth as it needs to be," Brown said. "But I think it was a good start for us, and it certainly helps us to know what we need to work on this week before we play a level of competition that's a lit­tle bit higher." 
The Irish dominated the first game -at one point leading the Falcons by a score of 26-14 -before taking it 30-24. Enzweiler put an end to the short-lived Falcon comeback with a solid kill through the middle of the Bowling Green defense. 
Freshman Megan Fesl pro­duced five kills in the opening frame, while Kaelin secured six of her own.

yards out. Only a sprawling save by Blazer goalkeeper Jeremy Drake prevented Yoshinaga from giving Notre Dame the lead. It was one of eight saves on the night for Drake. 
Senior forward Justin McGeeney almost secured the victory for the Irish with seconds to go in the first overtime when he settled a cross from forward Joseph Lapira and drove a hard shot towards the corner of the goal. The ball flew past the goal­keeper but a Blazer defender was there to clear the ball off the goal line. 
Notre Dame had numerous other chances but just couldn't fmd the back of the net. 
"It was a combination of things," Clark said. "The shots have to be better, but there we!"e also good saves and clearances. We didn't have Lady Luck on our side tonight." 
One bright spot for the Irish was the play of speedy freshman Justin Morrow. Morrow, who led Notre Dame with five shots on the night, came off the bench in the first half, second half and overtime to provide a dangerous option both crossing the ball and attacking the defense. 
"He's a tremendous athlete as we obviously saw tonight," Clark said. "He did very well tonight. He caused a lot of danger." 
Along with Morrow, Michael Thomas saw significant minutes Friday night, indicating that both freshmen will be among Notre Dame's options off the bench this season. 
Friday night's loss dropped the team's record for the season to 0-1-0. The loss was the first for the Irish in the five-year history of the Mike Berticelli tourna­ment. Before the defeat, Notre Dame held was 5-0-3 in the tournament, with titles in both 2003 and 2005. 
Despite Friday night's loss, Clark remained very upbeat about his team's prospects for this season.

Notre Dame 4, Creighton 1 

After Friday night's 1-0 dou­ble-overtime loss to UAB, Notre Dame took their frustration out on No. 8 Creighton, winning by the score of 4-1 Sunday in the final game of the Mike Berticelli Memorial Tournament. 
McGeeney, who was Notre Dame's leading scorer in 2005, led the way for the Irish with his first two goals of the season. Sophomore forward Bright Dike tallied his first official goal of the season, and Lapira also into action." 
The second half was more of the same as McGeeney almost secured a hat trick when his header went off. the crossbar in the 60th minute. The Irish were able to breathe easier in the 77th minute when Dike gave Notre Dame a two-goal advan­tage. 
The play started when a wide­open Nate Norman received a long pass from midfielder Michael Thomas. Norman beat two defenders, drew the goal­keeper out and centered the ball to Dike, who tapped it into the open net. 
Three minutes later, Lapira put the fmishing touches on the

"We have a  Irish coach  inside  his  

number of players who are huge threats," McGeeney said. "We have great forwards and midfielders. I don't think we've ever had this many threats at one time." 
The game started on a sour note for Notre Dame as Creighton opened the scoring in the second minute off a corner kick. Blue Jay defender Pietari Holopainen h1t an in-swinging cross that found its way through a crowd of players and into the back of the Irish net. 
Notre Dame responded deci­sively as McGeeney would score the first of his two goals only 12 minutes later. After receiving a pass from midfielder Greg Dalby, outside midfielder Nate Norman used multiple step-over moves to beat his defender and loft a ball into the box where McGeeney was able to flick the ball into the corner of the net. 
Only four minutes later, McGeeney would give Notre Dame the lead. Off a long clear­ance by goalkeeper Andrew Quinn, Bright Dike flicked the ball into a sprinting McGeeney's path. Using a spin move at the top of the box, McGeeney eluded his defender and unleashed a powerful shot into the top'corner of the goal. 
"Getting those two goals really settled the team, and it helped us feel like we were in the driver's seat," Clark said. "The one good thing about [Creighton's] early goal was that it jolted our team

"(This weekend) was two games of total domination," Clark said. "I felt we played much better this weekend than we did in our two preseason games, and if we keep perform­ing well, it's only a matter of time before we start winning." 
While the offense looked impressive Sunday afternoon, sophomore goalkeeper Andrew Quinn, making his first career start for Notre Dame, also drew the praise of his head coach. 
"He made some good saves," Clark said. "He has terrific feet and great range. He settled in well after the goal, and it was good for him to make a couple of saves today." 
Sunday's win evened Notre Dame's record at 1-1-0, but they will still finish in second place for the Berticelli Tournament behind in-state rival Indiana ­who won both their games this weekend. The Irish will have their chance for revenge, howev­er, next weekend when they play the Hoosiers in the Adidas/IU Credit Union Classic. 
Notes: 
+ Yoshinaga was taken off the field in the first half against Creighton with an injury to his upper chest. Junior midfielder Kurt Martin was also helped off the field in the second half with a back injury, but he is not expect­ed to miss significant time. 
+With a 2-1 victory over UAB Sunday afternoon, Indiana secured first place in the Mike Berticelli Memorial Tournament. with a perfect 2-0 record. The Hoosiers also defeated Creighton 1-0 on Friday night. Notre Dame and UAB both will fmish at 1-l . but the Irish will take second place because of a better goal differential than the Blazers.

injury to senior Nikki Westfall. Lysander saw only four shots over the course of the contest, just two of which were on target. 
Waldrum said he was encour­aged by Lysander's performance, but added he couldn't judge enough from the limited action. 
"We just haven't seen [Lysander or Karas] tested much," he said after the win over Iowa State. "I guess that's a good thing because it means we aren't giving up many chances. But at the same time it makes the evaluation of them harder." 
Another freshman, forward Michele Weissenhofer, scored two goals in her first collegiate start. After the game, she said she wasn't expecting to play so well her first time. 
"I was surprised," said Weissenhofer, who also had two assists in the game, said. "I wanted to do well, and it's very exciting." 
Waldrum, o the other hand, was not surprised by Weissenhoffer's success. 
"We recruited her for that reason," he said. "We've seen Michele enough times in her club and her high school sea­sons that we knew she could score goals." 
Five other players -senior Jill Krivacek, senior Lizzie Reed, junior Susan Pinnick, senior Claire Galler-ano and senior Molly Ioracci -scored goals for the Irish. For Gallerano, it was the first time 

freshman forward Hannah Weatherly. 
"They caught us with that early goal," Waldrum said. "We made a mistake in the back and got caught out of position." 
The Irish evened up the score in the 39th minute, when a cor­ner kick bounced around the Ole Miss box and was eventually volleyed in by Irish junior for­ward Amanda Cinalli. 
Notre Dame took the lead for good in the 52nd minute when Weissenhofer, using a flip-throw in technique, tossed the ball into the Rebel penalty area, where Krivacek headed to Hanks for the goal.

Karas started at keeper for the Irish, allowing the one goal and making two saves. Waldrum said 
Karas  - like the rest of the  
team  - looked  mentally  
fatigued.  

"[Karas] handled most of the things well, but she made some mental mistakes, just like the rest of the players," Waldrum said. "She would make agreat save and then throw the ball to the other team." 
Waldrum said he is not ready to name a sure starter for next weekend's home games against Southern California and Santa Clara. 
''I'm going to go this week and see if one of them starts to sepa­rate a little bit," he said. 
Waldrum said he was impressed with the atmosphere in Ole Miss Soccer Stadium and that he wished Alumni Field could be as imposing for visitors. 
''They had a great crowd with a great student section," he said. "They had the roster of our team and were giving us a hard time. It was a pretty hostile environ­ment. 
"I know this is a football school and that takes a lot out of our students, but I don't see why we can't have that kind of envi­ronment at our stadium." 
The USC game kicks off at 
7:30 p.m. Friday and the Santa Clara game starts at 1 p.m. Sunday.

 The Irish will "tone it down" physically this week so "we're as fresh as we possibly can be," Weis said. Fresh legs will come in handy when the Irish defense lines up against Georgia Tech All­America receiver Calvin Johnson.

Notre Dame spent the final third of Friday's scrimmage on finding repetitions for younger players. Weis said that the first and second spots on the depth chart are mostly solidified, but "there are still some issues" between the second and third spots. 
Up to 70 players will board the flight to Atlanta for Saturday's 8 p.m. (EST) kick off. Sixty of those spots are filled, and Weis said there is a handful of Irish competing for the final 10 spots to make the trip. 
Notes: 

+ The returning defensive players are ahead of where they were last season -physi­cally and mentally. 
Starting free safety Chinedum Ndukwe is "in the best shape he's been in since I've been here," Weis said. 
The returning defenders also understand the game more than last season, Weis said ­something he hopes will pay off against Georgia Tech. 
"Everyone's telling me how bad the defense is -I guess we'll just have to wait till next Saturday night to find out," Weis said sharply. "We'll see if we have any speed or not." 
+ Irish right tackle Sam Young will start against Georgia Tech -impressive considering he's a true freshman. To help Young adjust to Dh-ision-1 foot­
ball, Weis 
"Ryan's 
been valuable in helping Sam mature through this process," Weis said. 
While Harris, whose first career start came at Pittsburgh in 2003, sat out much of fall camp with an injury, the Irish coaching staff kept him busy by having him help "coach" Young each day. 
"That's how we kept [Harris] mentally involved in the game, because the tendency is to let your mind wander when you're not in there," Weis said. "Now that we've assigned him that coaching responsibility, that's kept him sharper at the same time." 
+ Notre Dame will dress in coats and ties on the jet to Atlanta this week. If the Irish lose, Weis said they will wear the same outfit on the trip home. If they win,-they will wear sweats.

By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Sports Editor 
Notre Dame had a few holes in its lineup this weekend, but that didn't matter. 
Playing without sophomores Brittany Bock and Carrie Dew ­both competing in the under-20 World Championships -and with several other players limit­ed by injuries, the No. 5 Irish (2­
0) won their first two games of the season, 9-0 over Iowa State at Alumni Field Saturday and 2-1 over Ole Miss Sunday in Oxford, Miss. 

. Notre Dame 9, Iowa State 0 
The Irish got off to a fast start Saturday, immediately moving the ball into the Cyclones' end and peppering goalkeeper Ann Gleason with shots until second­semester sophomore forward Kerri Hanks scored the first of her two goals just 1:19 into the game. 
The goal was the fastest the Irish have ever scored to open a season. 
"The thing that helped us the most was that we got oft' to such a fast start," Notre Dame coach Randy Waldrum said. "They had to come here and play a ranked team, and we got to them early. And [the Cyclones] were a little shellshocked." 
Hanks, who missed several practices earlier in the week with

After heartbreaker, Irish rebound 
UAB wins do-uble­overtime thriller but ND bombs Bluejays 
By GREG ARBOGAST Sports Writer 
It was a down-and-up week­end for Notre Dame. 
The Irish dominated UAB in every phase of the game except the scoreboard Friday night, as Jerson Monteiro's goal in the 105th minute allowed the Blazers to escape with a 1-0 vic­tory in the season opener for both teams. 
Despite out-shooting UAB 23­5 and holding a 14-4 edge in corner kicks, the Irish could not capitalize on their many chances in Notre Dame's open­ing game of the Mike Berticelli Memorial tournament. The Blazers, who seemed content during most of the over­time periods to sit back and play for a tie, would capitalize on what was their only shot on goal

for the night. 

UAB's Dejan Jakovic drew a foul near the end line just out­side the 18-yard box, giving the Blazers a free kick. The Blazers' Two-Boys Gumede then sent a curling ball into the box and found a rising Montiero at the back post for the only goal of the game. 
"[This game] will be a charac­ter test for us," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. "Our play was positive, but when it's said and done, the result is what's impor­tant." 
Throughout the night, there were many times when Notre Dame seemed poised to take the lead, especially in the second half. After earning ten corner kicks in the first half, the Irish out-shot UAB 15-2 in the sec­ond half. 
Perhaps the best chance came in the 73rd minute when an Ian Etherington cross found an unmarked Alex Yoshinaga for a point-blank header from six

a pulled muscle in her leg, played only 30 minutes against Iowa State but made the most of her time, showering Gleason with five shots, two of which found the back of the net. 
"I just went out and played the best I could," Hanks said. "I told Coach earlier that I wanted to score two goals and then he could take me out." 
Waldrum said he wanted to see Hanks in game action, but had made up his mind to take her out early no matter what the situa­tion. 
"Kerri and I did joke about two goals -and she ended up get­ting those-but I wouldn't have left her in much longer than that even if she hadn't been scoring," Waldrum said. 
Another player who had missed preseason practice time but played against the Cyclones was senior captain Kim

Injury-free scrinunage ends pre-season camp 
By MIKE GILLOON Sports Writer 

The best news was no news for Charlie Weis this weekend. 
Notre Dame's intrasquad scrimmage in the stadium Friday night ended with no injuries -a welcome report for Weis and his staff as the season's first game week kicks off today. 
''I'm a creature of habit," Weis said Saturday. ''I'm looking for­ward to getting into my normal schedule, because until this point, nothing [has been] nor­mal." 
After three weeks of fall camp, Weis stressed a typical routine in the scrimmage. 
The team went through regu­lar pre-game preparations Friday, even saying an opening prayer. 
"We did everything," Weis said. "At the end we got in the locker room and [Irish offensive guard Bob] Morton led us in the fight song." 
Notre Dame spent two-thirds of Friday's scrimmage on Georgia Tech and now turns its full attention to the Yellow Jackets, with just five days before the season's first game.

Fr. Bill Lies, CSC Executive Director, Center for Social Concerns 
The Center for Social Concerns invites you to push the boundaries of your classroom into the neighborhoods of South Bend and be~ yond. Come and enter the lives of those who live and study and work there. Indeed, consider the ways that you might begin to be a part of the world's transformation. 
Through the years, thousands of students have taken part in the numerous opportunities offered through the Cen~ ter for Social Concerns and our many partners. Each student has made an important difference. 
Often this service involve~ ment, and the learning that comes through it, transform you. In turn, this transformation allows each of you to 


Fr. Bill Lies, esc 

be impressive agents of 
transformation in others' 
lives. This is seen during 
and long after your time 
at Notre Dame, Saint 
Mary's, or Holy Cross 
College. 

Jesus called love the 
greatest of all command~ 
ments-to love the Lord 
God with all our hearts 
and to love our neighbor 
as ourselves (Mark 12: 
28-31). It is not easy but 
it remains no less our 
challenge and call. It is 
the foundation on which 
we will build the justice 
we seek and the peace we 
long for. 

Be a part of the trans~ formation to which we are called. Give yourself away. One or more of the opportunities on these pages could quite possibly change you forever.
