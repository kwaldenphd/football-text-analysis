Infractions consistent over last three years

Mention "HesLife" among a group of Notre Damn students and a chorus of voices will undoubtndly jump in, eager to share a tale or two. 
But how many students have actually been there? And what are they really there for? 
Statistks released by the Oflice of Hesidence Life and Housing show relatively consistent num­bers for the past three academic years -which followed major changes to the University's alco­hoi policy in the spring of 2002. 
During the 2004-05 academic year, 1,019 disciplinary incidents were reported to the Office of Hesidence Life and Housing, com­pared to 1,074 cases during the 2003-04 year and 1,246 cases during the 2002-03 year. 
"It's my impression that Notre Dame has a low safety net," said Kelly Lawrence, assistant direetor of the Office of Alcohol and Drug Education. "Students are proba­bly more likely to go through the disciplinary system and alcohol education system here than at other schools, maybe for more minor problems that would be ignored if we had a student popu­lation of 30,000." 

And a fair number of them go through it again. During the 2004-05 academic year, 32 per­cent of disciplinary ineidents reported to the Orficc of

After two hours of emotional testimony, the South Bend Common Council deadlocked Monday night over the zoning sta­tus of the Peter Claver Catholic Worker House. 
The year-long controversy cen­ters around whether or not the South Bend house, which shelters homeless people, can continue to operate in its current single-family zoned property. 
The Council split 4-4 over the Catholic Worker house's petition to rezone its 1126 West Washington St. property as a mul­tifamily residence. 
Concerned citizens packed the council's meeting room in antici­pation of llle decision. 

Supporters of the Catholic Worker petition wore white rib­bons and included guests of the house, neighbors. Notre Dame professors and students and the pastors of Sacred Heart, St. Adalbert's, St. Joseph's and Christ the King pari'ihes. 
Letters of support from University President Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh and Fort Wayne-South Bend Bishop John D'Arcy were also read. 
The opponents of the zone change were also present in force, including some neighbors, several South Bend residents including one Notre Dame employee, and South Bend Mayor Steven Luecke.

STUDENT SENATE 

Voters say Zahrn is no 'House' 
By MADDIE HANNA 
Associate News Editor 
Student Senate was all business Wednesday night ­almost. 
Senators quickly passed three resolutions amending the Student Union constitu­tion but denied a resolution to formally recognize Zahm Hall as "Zahm House," a topic that sparked debate and stirred a few heated dorm rivalries. 
Judicial Council president James Leito and vice presi­dent of elections Peter Van Loon presented two resolu­tions on amending election and Judicial Council proce­dures, noting problems that arose during the student body elections last spring. 
"We believe they're pretty much necessary," Van Loon said. 
The first resolution, which Leito described as "cosmet­ic," calls for additional time for student body president and vice president candi­dates to collect the 700 sig­natures required before they can officially begin cam­paigning. 
The signature requirement jumped from 300 to 700 two years ago. 
"For you non-math majors, that's over a 100 percent increase," Leito said. "It's a pretty big ordeal."

INSIDE COLUMN 

My kind of fen1inisn1 

When I came to Saint Mary's I did not consider myself a fi.~minist. I could not deny that in some instances men are bet­ter than women, and women are better than men in others. 
I also could not deny the fact that I Kelly Higgins enjoyed the special treatment that

girl. It is nice to have the door held open tor me and to know I will never be drafted. With these opinions, I was sure I did not qualifY. 
After coming to Saint Mary's, with its relatively diverse population when it comes to women's rights, I learned that my outlook on life and the sexes actually has a name -compatablist feminism. 
Compatablist feminists believe that there are differences between men and women and that with these differences come strengths and weaknesses. Neither sex is better than the other, nor are they equal. Because men and women are not the same they deserve not equal but equitable treatment. 
This means that women should be treated with the same amount of respect and dignity that all humans deserve. Both sexes should have the capability to strive for whatever station they desire in life. Because men and women have dif­ferent strengths, we develop an interde­pendent relationship in order to maxi­mize on these strengths. I believe that our society and Saint Mary's are set up in a way to allow this to happen. 
Now many people will read this and think: "What? That is not what a femi­nist is." It is important to recognize that there are other school'> of feminism. liberal feminism is what most people think of as feminism, which is not sur­prising because they are activist-based and the most vocal. 
When you think of feminists burning their bras, growing their armpit hair, and bashing men, they are who you are thinking of. I believe that their spirit, enthusiasm and hope toward a better life are impressive. 
However, I begin to disagree when they deny the differences between the sexes and start to blame men for many of their problems. It seems as though many feminists have lost sight of the idea of equality and have begun striving for dominance. 
As a believer in equity of rights for all humans, I cannot agree with this. Further, I cannot agree with those who say marriage and motherhood are wrong or backward concepts. I hope to one day be a mother and a wife and to work together with my husband to teach my children to respect not only the oppo­site sex but all people. 
Not all liberal feminists are as extreme as I have described, but in reality that is the image that comes to mind when the word feminist is used. I know it is what I thought of before I came to Saint Mary's. 
I am thankful that I have learned that the way I view the world is a brand of feminism that I am proud of. I have accepted my gifts as well as my weak­nesses as a woman because of it. I hope that society can begin to realize the other faces of feminism: ones of equity and respect instead of radicalism and man­hating.

Saint Mary's Shovvcase of Careers creates job opportunities 
By KATIE KOHLER Nt·w,Writer 
l>espitP high winds and snow l'lurrins, students packed HnignbtHlliX Lounge in l.nMans llall at Saint Mary's lilf the annual Showcase of Carnnrs that ran from :~ to 6 p.m. Wndru~sday. 
With morn than 45 companies prnsnnt this year, there wnrn plenty of opportunities for stu­dents to make profnssional eon­lads for l'uturn jobs and intnrn­ships. Tlw earner fair W<L<; optm to students of all ages from Saint Mary's, Notrn Damn and Holy Cross. 
Dirnetor of thn Saint Mary's Center for Carner Opportunities .Jell' Hobert.-; said Saint Mary's hao; om~rml some sort of career fair fitr morn than :m years. 
"It is a good starting point for studnnts," Hobt~rts said. "If they d1oos1~ to fitllow-up with a phone call or an intnrvinw. then the chance, of course, inereao;es." 
Attending dons not guarantee studt~nts intnrvit~ws or jobs, Hoht~rts said. but it certainly inermLo;ns their chances. 
"Tbnrn is a dnfinite eorrnlation, hownver, bntwmm thn number or organizations a studnnt talks to and the opportunities they create from thn job fitir," he said. 
Michael Sandnrs, director of Indiana Cawnrs at Saint Mary's and assistant professor in the business departnwnt, said the Showeasn of earners was very lwrwfkial for job-hunting stu­dent.-;. 
"To my knowlndge, students havn gottnn jobs aftnr eoming to thn showeasn," Sanders said. 
"ISaint Mary's I invito nmployers to the fair that like to hirn our stu­dtmts." 
.Juniors and seniors, who are bt~ginning to l'nnl t.hn pressure to secure a job af'ter graduation, wnre the biggest groups repre­sented, Sandnrs said. llowever, underdasswomen also attnnded to get a jump-start on thn job market. 
"I am hem mainly to gnt infor­mation, not necessarily f'ind a job," freshman .Jayde Kennedy said. "I wanted to come so that it could help me see what kinds of things I could do with my major." 
Hoberts made a elear ell'ort to invite a variety of companies to campus li1r the student<;. 
"We extended invites to over 300 companies so that the stu­dent-; could have a cornucopia of options and career paths to choose from," Hobert-; said. 
Hoberts and Sanders also worked in conjunction with stu­dent-; so they knew what compa­nies to speak to and what compa­nies would be best for their field of study. 
"We make sure they lthe stu­dents] know who is here," Sanders said. "We make introduc­tions and give them information so that nothing is overlooked." 
Organizations represented ranged from non-profit and post­graduate volunteer programs to banks, the military, the FBI, labo­ratory internships and many oth­ers. Tho companies that could not physically be present still left information about their company and the opportunity for interested student<; to leave a rcsmne. 
"We are looking for someone with a profflssional image who would like to stay relatively in the Michiana area," said Abigail Zahner of 1st Source Bank. "We recruit from schools in the area, namely !USB, Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Ivy Tech." 

When asked about the success ofjob fairs in the past. she said, "I have definitely seen success in the past because if students are will­ing to make the effort to come out and get information, they are most likely willing to get onboard in the future." 
Senior Lindsay Cook said having several dozen organizations right on campus is quite convenient. 
"It is nice that [companies] come to us because during the school year, it is hard to go out and distribute your resume to eompanies," Cook said. "I mean, I would still be proactive about it, but overall, it is easier that all the companies are in one place right here." 

Representatives said they were looking fi.1r students with a wide variety of majors and specific interests. 
"We aren't just looking for writ­ers or artists," said Aaron Woodsworthy, publicity director at the Writer's Center of Indiana. "We are looking for people who are passionate about hnlping peo­ple and want to positively afTeet the community." 
The Writer's Center of Indiana makes appearances at one or two career fairs per year. It was at such an event where executive director Emily Wat'ion was hired. 
"I think it is a good opportunity for students, and we come to Saint Mary's because we already have connections here and want to make those connections big­ger," Watson said. 
Some eompanies were just look­ing for summer candidates. Chemist Beth Blaktlslee of Dow AhrroSdnnees, said she was con­tacted by the chemistry depart­ment at Saint Mary's and was interested in hiring interns for the summer. 
"We have had a lot of success recruiting for chemistry, but this year we are looking specilically for interns, not full-time work­ers," Blakeslee said. 
Be it internships, full-time work aft.nr graduation or simply gaining inlimnation and insight on a par­ticular field. the Saint Mary's Showcase of Careers created opportunities for students of all ages and majors. 
"More student-; were exposed to many different companins and types of work, giving them a greater possibility of getting a position in the future," Hoborts said.

Speaker shares fears of terror 
Professor calls concerns about border vulnerability well-founded 
By RYAN SYLDIK News Writer 
Jimmy Gurule, professor of law in the Notre Dame Law School and former Undersecretary for Enforcement in the U.S. Department of the Treasury, presented a lecture on "The Need for Immigration Heform in the War on Terror" Wednesday. 
The lecture, which focused on issues of terrorism, border secu­rity and global trade, was part of an ongoing lecture series featur­ing Latino and minority speak­ers sponsored by Notre Dame's Institute for Latino Studies. 
In addition to his work with the Treasury, Gurule has also worked for the U.S. Department of Justice and as a federal pros­ecutor in Los Angeles. 
Gurule, an expert on interna­tional criminal law with regards to terrorism, terrorist financing and the prevention of money­laundering, set the tone for his discussion by saying, "Terrorism, border security and global trade all intersect." 
"In August 2001, I was sworn in as Undersecretary of Enforcement at the Treasury Department," he said. 
There, he was in charge of 30,000 people and a $5 billion­per-year budget. Just a month after he took office, on Sept. 11, 2001, everything changed. 
"I was in my office at the Treasury Department and felt the explosion of the plane that hit the Pentagon," he said. "At that point, we moved security to the highest level." 
Gurule, who went on to draft and implement the U.S. Government's anti-terrorist fmancing strategy, discussed the unintended consequences of securing the border in that high­security post-Sept. 11 environ­ment. 

"One very interesting thing happened," Gurule said. "We saw lines of traffic back up that were six to eight to ten hours long at the border. We need to understand and appreciate that we live in a small, interdepend­ent world." 
Gurule went on to discuss future threats. The media has focused heavily on preventing the entry of undocumented workers, he said, who are not a security threat. Instead, he said a container or a vehicle with an explosive or even weapon of mass destruction should be the main concern. 
"The fear a WMD could be smuggled across the border is well-founded," he said as he described how the millennium bomb plot involving AI Qaeda terrorist Ahmed Ressam was foiled by an observant customs agent. 
The practicalities and limita­tions of protecting the borders were also discussed. Gurule noted that in 2003, 412.8 million people were processed and 132 million conveyances entered the country. 
"Searching everyone is neither practical nor justifiable," Gurule said. 
In addition, he also mentioned the threat posed at seaports. 
"Nine million containers are unloaded every year," he said. "Conceivably, any one could serve as a carrier for a nuclear device. Not every container can be searched." 
Gurule addressed this by explaining how gamma X-ray machines scan suspicious con­tainers. He also cited the largely successful Container Security Initiative, in which U.S. customs inspectors check containers before departure at foreign ports rather than at arrival at 
U.S. ports as a way to not only keep the U.S. safer, but also to speed up the inspection process benefiting security and trade alike. 
However, Gurule was much more critical of other post-Sept. 11 reforms. 
"There is no bigger bureau­cracy than the Department of Homeland Security," he said, adding that merging 20 very dif­ferent agencies creates severe problems with regards to direc­tion and efficiency. He said among other things, the separa­tion of U.S. Customs Service from the Treasury and its subse­quent division into two agencies undermined morale in the agency. 
Gurule also warned of old habits creeping back into the system. 
"Sometimes we're our worst enemy," he said. "We weren't very good at intelligence-sharing before 9/11." 
Though he stated that Sept. 11 had changed that attitude, he also said, "That attitude has become retrenched." 
Gurule ended his discussion with a message for Notre Dame students. 
"The one message I want to communicate is that this whole issue of terrorism will be here for years to come," Gurule said. "I hope that Notre Dame stu­dents will dedicate themselves to public service so as to defeat it. We need the best and the bright­est to solve this problem."

TV's favorite doofus shares life experiences 

By MARECELA BERRIOS 
News Writer 

Steve Urkel spoke to a full house Wednesday night. 
Jaleel White, who played the goofy Urkel on the television show "Family Matters," shared some of his experiences in show business with an ample DeBartolo audience. 
Before the lecture began, stu­dents eager to meet their child­hood hero discussed not only White's unforgettable moments, but also the legacy of "Family Matters," the second-longest running show featuring pre­dominantly African-American characters in the history of tele­vision. 
"The show itself was solid," said seniors Blake Johnson and 
White almost played Bill Cosby's youngest offspring in "The Cosby Show," but at the very last minute, Cosby changed his mind and decided to make Rudy a girl instead of a boy. 
"Had I gotten that part, my life would've been different, but nobody knows in which ways," White said. "Perhaps I would've missed out on countless great experiences." 
It is this same optimism that later also made him the most memorable character on "Family Matters." 
White believes Urkel's tram­poline to fame was the episode in which his character is bom­barded by pies in a remarkably humorous fight. 
He was hesitant at first to become the show's buffoon, since he was already being 
Annie Desir. "Its portrayal of a strong, African-American mid­dle class family -who was also funny -really became a role model for our community." 
"Jaleel White-as Stephan or Kel-was looking fine," senior Rhea Boyd said. "What is even more incredible, though, is that he really was a positive and prominent African-American male figure on television throughout our adolescent years." 
The "Family Matters" star opened to a thunder of applause, and touched on an array of issues that included his parents' efforts to keep their son in school and unpreten­tious, despite the fact he was earning $100,000 per episode. 
"My mother wanted me to know the value of a dollar," White said. "When you earn something, when you've worked hard for it, you learn to appre­ciate it more, and I thank my parents for teaching that." 
White said he was not even aware of his six-figure salary until the third season of "Family Matters," since his parents wanted him to act driven by "the love of the game," rather than monetary compensation. 
He also spoke of some of the difficulties he encountered throughout the nine seasons that "Family Matters" was on the air, such as the struggle in his post-puberty years to main­tain the high-pitched voice that characterized Steve Urkel. 
Another private anecdote he shared with the Notre Dame audience pertained to another well-known African-American family program. 
harassed at school for his quirky performances onscreen. 
However, the pie fight episode made Steve Urkel a household name. 
"I decided to be a team player, a professional, and let the punches roll," White said. 
"That attitude got me center positioning in the show, and opened a world of opportuni­ties." 
From that day on, ABC pro­moted Steve Urkel more than any other character on "Family Matters," or in the network's popular TGIF lineup, White said. 
White also made reference to his reluctance to participate in shows like "The Surreal Life" or "Dancing with the Stars," where formerly well-known actors desperately assemble for an additional five minutes in the spotlight. 
"I let my work define me," White said. ''I'm not in it for the attention. Every time you see me on the screen you can be sure it is because I really do believe in what I am doing." 
Students who attended the lecture seemed more than satis­fied with White's presentation. 
Junior Crystal Erwin was even lucky to do the Steve Urkel dance with him on stage. 
"As an FTT major from California, I could relate to some of his Hollywood experi­ences, which is incredible because he's somebody I've watched growing up," Erwin said. "I feel like today I got to know him on a more personal basis."

WASIIINGTON -Bob Woodward's version of when and where he learned the idnntity of a CIA opera­tive contradicts a speeial prosneutor's contention that Vice President Dick Cheney's top aide was the first to make the disclosure to reporters. 
Attorneys for the aide, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, described Wednesday's statement by the Washington Post's assistant managing editor as helpful for their defense, although Libby is chargnd with lying to a grand jury and the FBI, not with disdosing the CIA ollkial's name. 
"llopnl'ully, as infill'lnation is obtained from rnporters likn Bob Woodward, the real facts will come out." lawyer Ted Wells said Wndnesday. 
Woodward, a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter, said he had not told his bosses until last month that he had learned about Yalnrie Plame's identity and her work at the CIA mom than two years ago from a high­level Bush administration ollicial.

Interior Minister: Prisoners include all sects 
Associated Press 

BAGIIJ>AU -A top Interior Ministry official said Wednesday the 173 malnourished prisoners round by U.S. forces ineluded all Iraqi sects, playing down allegations of a campaign by Shiitn-led security forces to supprnss Sunni Arabs ahead of next month's Pleetion. 
Thn Shiite-led government sought to darnpnn Sunni outrage ovnr rove­lations Tuesday by Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari that the detainees, some showing signs of torture, were fi1und last weekend by 
U.S. troops at an Interior Ministry loekup in the capital. Most were bnlievnd to be Sunni Arabs, the leading group in tho insurgency. 
But the deputy interior minister, Maj. Gen. Hussein Kamal, said the detainees also ineluded Shiites, Kurds and Turkomen. lie gavn no breakdown. 
President Jalal Talabani said there was "no place for torture and porsn­cution in the new Iraq" and that anyone involved "would be sevornly punishnd." 
And government spokesman Laith Kubba defended the Interior Ministry, saying all the detainees were legally arrested and most were referred to courts for prosecution. They were kept at the detention centnr in the Jadriyah distriet because of a lack of jail space. he said. 
"The Interior Ministry is doing its job at a difficult time and some mis­takes happen," he said. 
That did little to assuage Sunni Arab anger, with Sunni politicians saying the Jadriyah center was not the only place where detainees are 
tortured. Sunni lnadPr Adnan ai­Dulairni said lw had complainnd to tho government about abuses at throe Interior Ministry compounds.

Senate 
continued from page 1 
Under the current rules. students can start obtaining petitions on the first Tuesday of classes of the second semester and must file them by Wednesday of the follow­ing week. The resolution, which was approved without opposition, pushes the filing deadline to Friday. 
The other resolution tackles frustrations faced by Judicial Council concerning its duties during election season, implementing a simple majority rule and lengthening the time period the Council has to consider allegations. 
A significant problem encountered by Judicial Council last spring was not being able to meet quorum ­the minimum number of members required for a vote to be legitimate. 
One of the Judicial Council's roles is to investi­gate potential instances of campaign misconduct, "to convene if any allegations come up," Van Loon said. 
But last year Election Committee member.s were unable to consider two of the four allegations that came before them due to decreased attendance at meetings, said Van Loon, who served on the Committee last year. 
"Basically, they were just dropped dead," he said. 
"If there's a violation, and it's a serious one -and there were serious ones last year -they do need to be investi­gated," Leito said. 

The resolution drops the number of members required to vote at Election Committee meetings from 21 to 14 -a simple majority of the 27­member Committee. 
While Judicial Council is "trying to put a few checks in place, to block off time" for emergency meetings during election, Leito said former Judicial Council president Brin Anderson wrote these recommendations in her transition report. This reso­lution also passed without opposition. 
The third resolution passed by Senate eliminates the "so called idea of a pocket-veto" by the student 
and this inconsistency should be resolved," the resolution read, noting that Morrissey Manor and Sorin College have already shed the "Hall" in their names and "such names and cultures build community among the stu­dent body." 
Dillon senator Dan Brown opposed the resolution based on three points.

Delta, pilots in court over reduced pay 
Bankruptcy court asked to void contract in financial crisis, reducing wages, benefits 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Delta Air Lines Inc. asked a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge Wednesday to void its con­tract with Delta's pilots' union so the beleaguered airline can impose deep wage and benefit euts and avoid further financial ero­sion. 
With sevnral uniformed Delta pilots looking on in· a standing room-only court­room, Delta attorney Jack Gallagher said the airline valued its pilots and tried to nngotiate reductions, but ultimatnly failed. 
Faced with rising fuel eosts, Delta is seeking to slash $325 million from its collective bargaining agree­ment with its pilots, saying the money is needed to kenp its operations running. The ALPA, which has offered $90.7 million in concessions, has threatened to strike if the court grants Delta's request. 
"The need is $325 million of cash. That is what our investment bankers tell us. That's what our creditor committee tells us, Ghallager said. "ALPA is fervnntly urging the court to say it isn't so. We're telling them it is so. We wish we didn't need $325 million of

zations on campus in order to find feminism at the College, however. Many members of the Saint Mary's community said the single-sex aspect of the College lends itself to a natural focus on feminism in the class­room. 
Krista Hoefle, Gallery Director and an assistant professor of art, said that feminism is an inherent part of the education at Saint Mary's. 
"Themes of feminism are woven into the courses," Hoefle said. "You have to address those issues because it's on the mind of many students." 
Henry said she believes the inclusion of feminism in the academics is an understood aspect of the curriculum. 
"Even professors who don't teach Women's Studies classes, because they are at a women's college, tend to do projects focused on women," Henry said. "That is one of the byproducts of being at an all-women's col­lege. It's really part of that organic feminism that's in the air."

The number of students in the program has more than quadrupled since Henry's arrival four years ago. She attributed the growth to stu­dents' eagerness to finally discuss 
great, the student interest in the subject is really growing, and it feels like some­thing is really happening." 
Senior Women's Studies minor Maryann Senesac said her life has been altered because of exposure to classes associated with the minor. 
"My intro class made me real­ize that I always held feminist beliefs, but was afraid to say it," she said. "It was a decision to identify with feminism, and now I'm proud of that decision." 
The courses in the Women's Studies program planted the seed of feminism, Senesac said, and she hopes to plant that seed in others. 
"I want to touch the future and inspire them to question beliefs, society and people in power," she said. 
The Women's Studies program is not the only entity on campus that fosters feminism. Feminist United has also been a distinct voice in women's rights and feminist issues since its forma­tion three years ago. The objec­tives of the student group include improving awareness of feminist issues, providing a link between the Women's Studies program and the campus at large and drawing attention to specific women's issues, accord­ing to the group's Web site. Amanda Caddy, president of Feminist United, said the group has an even more specific goal for this year. 
"We are trying to show peo­ple that feminism isn't scary," Caddy said. "We want women to embrace the values of feminism, instead of the stigma that's associated with it." 
Henry, who serves as the fac­ulty advisor, said the group accomplishes this in a variety of 
ways. 
"They've done a lot of activi­ties around film screenings, they've had activities for Love Your Body Day, and they've done things in the past for women's history day in March," Henry said. "They also have weekly meetings to talk about whatever issues concerning women's rights are circulating at the moment." 
Henry said the membership of the group includes a broad range of students. 
"The leadership are mainly not Women's Studies students, which is kind of interesting," Henry said. "This maybe sug-· gests a good thing, that femi­nism and women's issues aren't isolated to the classroom." 
In the spring of 2005, Feminist United gave birth to the Straight and Gay Alliance (SAGA), which also incorporates the themes of feminism in its mission. SAGA president Sarah Medina said although the group may not deal with feminism directly, it communicates the values of feminism on deeper levels. 

"SAGA is a group that pro­motes equality, understanding and a safe community for all. To me, that is the core of femi­nism," she said. 
Medina said members of the Saint Mary's community can benefit from the presence of groups like SAGA and Feminist United on campus.

Groups like SAGA and Feminist United are able to remain active on campus due in part to the Women's Resource Center. The center, which began as a student-pro­pelled idea in 1992, is now housed in the new Student Center, and is the place many women-oriented campus groups call home. Senior Katie Kelly serves as the director of the center and acknowledges the importance of its presence. 
"The Women's Resource Center's mission is focused on opportunities for Saint Mary's students to experience other cultures. It assists in the College's study abroad pro­grams, as well as independent research projects. Women who

Stats

Hesidenee Uf{l and !lousing were for students with repeat viola­tions. That number was 35.4 per­cent in 2003-04 and 31.1 percent in 2002-03. 
Recent trends 
Four violations -intoxication, parking violations, off-campus arrest and abusive drinking ­have been among the top live vio­lations fllported during the past thren ynars. 
Intoxication aceountnd for 21.2 p11rcm1t of the disciplinary inci­dents snnt to the Office of Hnsidnnre Liffl and !lousing dur­ing the 2004-05 academic year. Parking violations areountml for 
12.2 percnnt, oll"-rampus arrest fi1r 11.7 percent, computnr usage fi1r II pereent and abusive drink­ing fi1r 9.6 pen:tmt. 
Thn most rnr.ent trend has been an incrnasn in r.omputer usage violations -meaning download­ing material in violation of copy­right laws. l>ireetor of Hesidence I.ifil and I lousing Jell" Shoup said. 
"We'ro contacted by the people that hold th11 1:opyright and who are making a complaint about studnnts who are infringing on tlwm," Shoup said. "We contact tlw studnnt, tdl them imnwdiate­ly to eeasn and desist the media that they're viewing. Some of tlwm don't nvnn maliZil that the material they've downloaded is eopyrightml or protm:t11d in some way." 
Shoup said in this seenario, the studnnt would liknly bn called in for "morn of a conversation" and sent to the Ollice of lnfi1rrnation Teehnology to have his or her ma1:hine deannd. 
l'arintals incidents were the sixth most reported violation dur­ing each of t.he thrne years-5.9 pere1mt of easns during the 2004­05 and 2003-04 academie years, 
4.2 percent in 2002-03. 
Heported violations of the University's sexuality code, how­ever, are few and far between, ranging from one to three inci­dents per year. 
The two most common sanc­tions are a monetary fme, admin­istered in 35.4 percent of the inci­dents during the 2004-05 aca­demic year, and alr.ohol assess­ment, administered in 17.6 per­cent of the incidents during the 2004-05 year. 
And as for the most serious sanctions -the numbers are small. 
One student was permanently dismissed during the 2003-04 ar.ademir. year. No students were dismissed during the 2002-03 year or during the 2004-05 year. 
"1\velve students were suspend­ed during the 2004-05 academic year, compared to seven during the 2003-04 year and 10 during the 2002-03 year. 
"I think one of thosn r.ommon miseoneeptions is how many peo­ple get suspended," Shoup said. "Sincn I've been here we've had three or four have to leave earn­pus ... 20 is about the most since I've been here. Permanent dis­missals ... That's about nqual to one or two, every other year. Those tend to be sexual assault eases, drugs, maybe a very seri­ous thcf"t. or repeated kind of behavior. where maybe tiHly've already bmm suspended once and have the same kind of behavior. But those are pretty rare." 
The numbers of students filreed to move ofl" r.ampus varied some­what over the p<L'it three years ­14 during the 2004-05 aeademie year, six in 2003-04 and nine in 2002-03. 
The statistics show that male sophomores are the most fre­quent HesLife oiTenders. Last ynar, 67.4 percent of disciplinary inr.idents involved males. The gender breakdown ehanges little from year to year-69.9 pereent of ineidents involved males in 2003-04, eomparnd to 65.6 per­r.ent in 2002-03. 
During the past three years, sophomores have paid the most visits to the Office of Residence Life and Housing, accounting for 
31.9 percent of reported diseipli­nary incidents during the 2004­05 academic year, 24.7 percent during 2003-04 and 28.1 percent during 2002-03. 
Freshmen are consistently the dass with the second-largest pro­portion of reported disciplinary incidents-25.4 percent in 2004­05, 23 percent in 2003-04 and 
27.9 percent in 2002-03. 
Codes of conduct 
duLac may be unique to Notre Dame, but the ideas within are not. 
The disciplinary policies of two of Notre Dame's peer institutions, Georgetown and Boston College, are for the most part strikingly similar to those outlined in duLac. 
Georgetown's Code of Conduct emphasizes community, a duLae tonot. 
"When order is absent or dis­rupted, not only are individuals harmed, but the r.ommunity suf­fers too," Georgetown's Code of Conduct reads. 
It also contains lanh'llage about harm to the community that is only slightly less vague than duLae's community clauses. promising sanctions for "actions or attempted actions that obstruct. interfere or could result in harm to others and/or the uni­versity community regardless of intent." 
Like Notre Dame administra­tors, tho Code stresses the impor­tance of education rather than discipline. 
"The student disr.ipline system is designed to be an educational system and does not function as a· court of law," it states. 
Georgetown's Code breaks its violations down into three classi­lir.ations -Category A, B and C -based on seriousness. 
Category A violations indude underage possession or eonsump­tion of alcohol, defar.ement, disor­derly conduct, possession of drug paraphernalia and "being in the presence of the use of a counter­feit or controlled substance." 
These violations "typically inelude a combination of sanc­tions ranging from a tine and/or work sanction hours coupled with educational classes/projects, referral to appropriate communi­ty resource, and/or party restric­tion up to and induding housing relocation or housing probation," the Code reads. · 
Category B violations range from misrepresentation of age in order to obtain alcohol, to provi­sion of alcohol to underage per­sons, to sexual misconduct, to use of drug paraphernalia and use or possession of a eoun terfeit or controlled substance. 
The sanction for a Category B violation involves, at minimum, housing relocation. It could mean a diseiplinary suspension lasting up to two years. 
Finally, the most serious viola­tions -Category C -mean "a student would likely receive, min­imally, disciplinary suspension or could be dismissed from the University," the Code reads. 
These violations include arson, physieal assault, sexual assault and manufacturing or possessing a counterfeit or controlled sub­stance with intent to distribute. 
The "Behavioral Standards and Polieies" section of Boston College's Student Guide is organ­ized alphabetir.ally by violation. 
Like Notre Dame, it refers explicitly to sexual union outside marriage, an action that "that may be subject to sanr.tion as conduct unbecoming a Boston College student." 
And like Notre Dame. it<; sanc­tions range from fines to dis­missal from tlw university, whieh requires "that the student r.om­pletely sever any and all connec­tion with Boston College." 
lloston College does outline minimum sanctions for eertain violations. For example, possess­ing a "central aleohol source" ­like kegs or punch bowls -or excessive amounts of aleohol means housing probation for those over 21 years of age, one semester housing suspension for those under 21. 
One area where Notre Dame does seem to differ is in drug poli­cies. 
At Boston College, possession of small quantities of Class D drugs like marijuana means housing probation and visits to the Alcohol and Drug Edur.ation Program. At Georgetown, a stu­dent in possession might be sus­ponded -but aL'io might just bn put on housing probation or housing suspension. 
At Notre Dame, however, that same possession moans a student "shall result in disciplinary sus­pension or dismissal." 
So is Notre Dame strictnr than othnr schools'? Or more lnninnt'? 
While the polieillS may snem thn same, they're just words. It's hard to judgn how the schools matr.h up, ev1m when eomparing numbnrs. 
"The challenge is that becausn nach of our sehools enforces thn polir.ies somewhat differently or has a different policy in general, numbers aro somnwhat mnaning­less," said Stephanie Quade, Associate Dean of Studnnt Dnvelopment at Marqunttn University. "Our p1H>pln would lm quick to tell you our aleohol poli­
r.y start<> at a low hwel. We bngin looking in thn JlrllSPneO of alcohol and document everything from the ground up." 
Marquette's Code of Condur.t wa<> not available fi1r rPview. 
The numbers may not show everything about nnforr.mnnnt, but many Notre Damn studnnts attest to a rer.nnt crackdown -a trend thny say is pushing them ofl" eampus. The sixth part of this series will examine the futurn or Notre Dame with regards to its rules and rngulations.

The Senate will hit Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito with a lot of ques­tions about "rights,'' including the right to privacy, to abortion, etc. Before the hearing begins, it might be a good idea to get our own act together on "rights." 
The index of the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Catholic Church lists 197 separate "rights," including the "right to freedom in religious matters," the "right to a just wage" and many more. Where did we get all those rights? Who can take them away? According to historian, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., "Human rights is not a religious idea. It is a secular idea, the product of the last four centuries of Western history." Or did the Declaration of Independence get it right when it said that "all men are created equal," and "are endowed by their Creator with certain Unalienable Rights"? 
Does the Constitution give you the freedom of speech? Or does it merely guarantee that freedom which you got somewhere else? Professor Iredell Jenkins, in the American Journal of Jurisprudence three decades ago, described the "two broad views which have disputed the field for centuries." One view holds that "rights have a real metaphysical and moral status .... Rights derive directly from God or Nature ... and they belong to man as part of his intrinsic nature ... Law mere­ly recognizes these rights and enforces respect for them ... The other view holds that rights ... owe their being and their nature exclusively to law ... whose crea­tures they are.... [T]he legislative or judicial act ... brings the rights into being and constitutes its content." Under this second view, the state gives rights and can take them away. 

Whether the person has any absolute rights depends on his origin, nature and destiny. "I see no reason for attributing to man," wrote Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, a patron saint of American jurisprudence, "a significance different in kind from that which belongs to a baboon or a grain of sand." What claim to immunity could such an insignificant entity have against the power of the majority or of the state to subject him to slavery or death at the discretion of oth­ers? "[T]he sacredness of human life," Holmes said, "is a purely municipal ideal of no validity outside the jurisdic­tion. I believe that force, mitigated so far as may be by good manners, is the ultima ratio." He defined truth as "the majority vote of the nation that could lick all others." 
If Holmes is right, if there is no objec­tive truth and no God, the Creator, how can we offer any reason why the human person has more intrinsic rights than "a baboon or a grain of sand"? As Pope John Paul II said, "the eclipse of the sense of God and of man ... leads to a practical materialism, which breeds individualism, utilitarianism and hedo­nism ... The first to be harmed are women, children, the sick or suffering and the elderly. The criterion of person­al dignity ... is replaced by the criterion of efficiency ... [O]thers are considered not for what they 'are,' but for what they 'have, do and produce.' This is the supremacy of the strong over the weak." After the experience of the Godless regimes of the 20th century and today, can we doubt the truth of John Paul's assessment? 
"We are not," said Pope Benedict XVI at the start of his pontificate, "some casual and meaningless product of evo­lution. Each of us is the result of a thought of God. Each of us is willed, each of us is loved, each of us is neces­sary." That is why, as John Paul put it in Veritatis Splendor, "civil authorities and ... individuals never have authority to violate the fundamental and inalienable rights of the human person ... [0 )nly a morality which acknowledges certain norms as valid always and for everyone, with no exception, can guarantee the ethical foundation of social coexis­tence." 
The only coherent basis for asserting those exceptionless moral norms and the transcendent rights of the human person is his creation in the image and likeness of God with an immortal des­tiny. As you read these lines, some child is being born in a hospital somewhere in Indiana. That child's life began some nine months before his birth. There will come a time when there will be no Indiana, no Washington, no Ireland, no Paris, no Rome. Maybe not even a Notre Dame Stadium. It will all be gone. But that child will still be alive. The human person, because of that immortal des­tiny, has rights that the state, and every­one else, is absolutely bound to respect because those rights come from God. 
The bottom line? Let's stop being apologetic about bringing God into "rights talk." Without God, our very existence makes no sense and we have no absolute, inalienable rights. With God, it all makes sense. It might even make sense to the United States Senate.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 


Commending Navy-ND reaction 
Peter Schroeder's column about the Notre Dame vs. Navy game was both eloquent and moving as well as "dead on" in my humble opinion. It was an incredibly well-written piece, and it is patently obvious that he is an English literature major! (Go Notre Dame professors!) Thank you so much. Schroeder, for writing it, and for all the kind words about the Navy-especially that "Navy has big­ger fish to fry. We may claim that we must protect this house, but Navy must protect something way bigger." They surely do. My brother and father are Notre Dame graduates, and I knew the Notre Dame fight song before I could walk. That same brother is also a F-18 fighter pilot for the Navy and has done several fly­overs for football games at Notre Dame-nothing has given him greater joy. I myself am an Army spouse -my husband is an Army JAG attending the Command and General Staff College at Ft. Leavenworth, Kan. He enlisted in the Army as a paratrooper at Ft. Bragg, N.C. at age 18 and later put himself through college on the GI Bill, went to law school and then "re-uped" as an officer. I am so very proud of both of them, not only for their military serv­ice but for the honorable, kind, brilliant men that they are. I am honored to be their sister and wife (respectively). 
It is so nice to realize that others outside of our military family understand and appreciate the sacrifice that so many young men and women-and those of us not so young anymore-are mak­ing on behalf of our country and for the greater good. I am not certain that all Americans see it that way, and it saddens me. The

men and women of the armed forces ask nothing from the general public-and yet they deserve far more. Yes, they collect a pay­check, but believe me, the paycheck is not what it is all about­more could be had elsewhere and, unquestionably, there are not too many of us willing to lay our lives on the line for folks that we do not know and will never meet, no matter how much someone wants to pay us. Thus, columns such as yours give a big shot in the arm to those in the military and the military spouses that sup­port our loved ones in uniform to allow them to serve and protect our country and its citizens. Your column hopefully will compel your readers to take a moment to realize what really matters in life and to reflect upon the daily and often unrecorded acts of self­lessness that our men and women in uniform conduct on behalf of us all. For in the end, as Schroeder so wisely reminds us, football is merely a game (I have to remind my husband, a rabid Arizona State alum, of this all the time). It is not life. So thank you. The future is bright with young men like Schroeder being ready and willing to let folks know that, even for Notre Dame football, win­ning cannot be the only goal -it truly is far more important how we play the game and that we are fortunate -and free enough ­
to play at all.

tlwir nnnd for assis­tance ends is not news. In faet. "compassion fatigue" becomes fod­der for news stories following almost every situation of disastrous loss. 
llownver, we have an obligation to keep thesn brothers and sisters of ours in our hnarlo;, long after the first heartfelt weeks of eontributions and prayers. 
A rnennt family emergeney brought horne to me onee again that large-seale disasters are simply tragedies that happen to one family at a time, multiplied by hun­dn~ds. or thousands. or hundreds of thou­sands of people. Just last week, my cousin, her partner and their dog escaped from their apartment during a fire that had probably ernpt through the interior walls of the largo old house they shared with six other apartment-;. They literally lost every­thing but the dothes they had on-they evnn had to have new car keys made. The old house burned to the ground and was subsequently bulldozed. Imagine losing every beloved photograph, every book you own, your furniture. your socks, shoes and every artide of clothing ... this story needs only to be multiplied by several tens of thousands, with water substituted for fire and Louisiana for Massachusetts, to encompass the stories of the people of the Gulf Coast last August and September. 
As we in our family pray and share updates and information, as we send gift cards and money and try to figure out what more we can do to help, I have thought over and over again that so many, many families continue to share this expe­rience on a larger scale with their own rel­atives who have lost everything due to a hurricane, an earthquake or a tsunami. And of course, that's not even counting the perhaps hundreds of thousands of people in the poorest parts of New Orleans, in the mountains of Pakistan, in Ban de Aceh, Indonesia. whose housing before these dis­asters was tenuous at best and who now face a quality of life we cannot imagine and would not tolerate for one of our own family members. 
Perhaps we don't even have "compas­sion fatigue," but simply a sense that this is

Wave hurts experience 
Like most students at the University of Notre Dame, I spent last Saturday afternoon cheering the Fighting Irish on to their eommanding victory over Navy. llowever, early in the fourth quarter I was shoekt~d. dismayed and physieally sickened as students in my section started performing "Tho Wave." This sad exeuse for a eheer is detri­mental to the Notrn Dame football experienee for many rnasons. 
It is no eoineidence that the last three times fans in Notrn Dame Stadium have engaged in wavn-like cheers. the Irish oll'onse has failed to eon vert on third down. Ao; many of us learned from a very informative Jumbotron at Purdue, the time to bn loud and obnoxious is when the tnam you like is on defense. Brady Quinn has the ovnrwholming responsibility of not only maintain­ing two of tho most beautiful and muscular arms in the world. but also of running a precision ollimse under the serutiny of a national audience; thn last thing he needs is 80,000 fans taunting his peripheral vision by leaping to their feet in a semi-choreographed manner, cheering loudly for a mildly amusing visual display. A'> gracious fans, the least we can do is avoid distracting our faith­ful team as they march onward to victory. 
Also, the initiation and performance of "The Wave" takes a lot of strategic planning, commu­nication and teamwork. lfthere's anything I've learned from two years of business classes, it's that anything that begins with careful planning and teamwork is never fun or worthwhile. While advocates of 'The Wave" are busy coaxing thou­sands of people to stand up on command, they're missing an essential part of any football Saturday: the football. Many people would pay hundreds, even thousands of dollars to sit in the student section for one exciting game between two rival eollege liJOtball programs. I am disap­pointed in my fellow students that do not find the battle on the gridiron exciting enough to divert attention from a cheap spectaele like "The Wave."

all too much to take in, that there's no pos­sible way we could do anything to help need of this magnitude. "This is all so overwhelming," my cousin wrote to my mother in an email from a borrowed com­puter. "Overwhelming" can easily lead us to a condition we might call "compassion paralysis" where we end up doing nothing simply out of the confusion of not knowing where to start. 
I guess we just start like our family has the luxury of starting: one family at a time. If we can recognize that somewhere out there lives a family, perhaps just like our own, that desperately needs our prayers, some clothes, some supplies to rebuild or clean up or move, some warm blankets or coats or boots, and ifwe could send those to a reputable relief organization, then perhaps together we could continue attempting to meet needs that continue to exist. Looking ahead, we could pay atten­tion to, and pray for, the discussions that have begun to take place which will hope­fully create changes on a larger scale. We cannot stop hurricanes, earthquakes, tidal waves or sometimes even fires from wreaking their havoc, but we can be better prepared for them -we can work for bet­ter quality affordable housing; we can hon­estly examine whether we should develop and build extensively in unstable coastal 
areas. 
My family's local parish here in South Bend has begun a program to send hun­dreds of large "clean-up buckets" to the southern United States to help with the digging, scrubbing, scouring and disposing that remains ongoing. It helps my husband and I and our children to know that our buckets will get to a family who will actu­ally be able to use the supplies inside to make their home and their possessions liv­able, sanitary and wearable. 
As Thanksgiving and Christmas approach, we stand on the edge of about six weeks of abundanee and plenty. We can also use these weeks to be about grati­tude and· generosity. Maybe the ongoing needs of our displaced brothers and sisters around the world will displace some of our own wants during these weeks to come.

Make the 'C' 
I want to respond to the letter yesterday about doing Ws for Weis [It should be a 'W', Nov. 16]. First. before I get to that I would like to rebuke the wave phenomenon. John Wrenn daimed that doing the wave shows "that everyone in the stadium cares about what is going on, is paying attention," and the wave doesn't show that at all. When people are doing the wave all they are paying attention to is the fans and not what is going on on the field. When Quinn threw the interception during the wavn, half the people around me were still cheering at the wave going on across the field. But I digress. Back to the point. People debatnd for way too long about the green shirt being a symbol of Willingham's era and no, that's not why seniors didn't buy them. The old green shirts just aren't as bad as the new ugly yellow shirt (bottling up the spirit to light up 
the universe has what to do with football?). And what is evnn more of a symbol of thn Ty era than the grmm shirlo; are tJ1e Ws (took mn a while to get to my point, I apolo­gize). The chant is spndlkally done to honor the coaeh ­whereas the shirt is for the team -so by continuing to do the Ws we are continuing a symbol meant for Ty. Doing a C would honor Weis and be a sign of the new era. I'll even let you say Weis if it makes you mom comliJrtable. Tim Cs are pretty easy to do, too. If you are having a problem come to see­tion 29 and I'll show you how.

CD REVIEW 
Ben Lee contemplates life and love on new album 
Photo courtesy of girlieaction.com Aussie Ben Lee was one of the youngest musicians ever to enter the Australian music scene. He began his career in the band Noise Addict when he was 14. 
By ANALISE LIPARI Scene Critic 
Unfortunately for Ben Lee, this Australian musician has been most well known in America for being the ex­boyfriend of actress Claire Danes. But with his newest release, "Awake is the New Sleep," Lee has a better, and certainly catchier, way to make a name for himself in the U.S. 
Lee's first major studio release in two years, "Awake is the New Sleep" is a 14­song journey into light melodies and earnest lyrics. It has a sweet and genuine feeling about it, whether it is from Lee's slight Aussie twinge or his lovable mug on the album's back cover. Ultimately, while it may not reveal any earth-shattering truths about human nature or the nature of love, "Awake" is an appealing detour from some

a point of poten­tial cheesiness, 
of the harsher music of today. 
The album opens with "Whatever It Is," a quiet little reflection on questioning and inhibition. The track flows with Lee's soft voice nearly whispering into the micro­phone, speaking gentle words to the song's subject. 
"And you're dancing, and you're looking kinda crazy I and your arms are making little circles I there are reasons, there are reasons, you can find out," Lee tenderly muses in "Whatever It Is." 
A standout track is the first major single off of the album, "Catch My Disease," which describes both Lee's quest for the . love of a certain girl, as well as his ran­dom thoughts on life in general. The mood and melody of the track are infectious, pun most likely intended with a smile by Lee. Here he uses a collection of instru­ments and a motley-crew-of-a-chorus to accentuate the cuteness factor this unabashedly adorable song.

but Lee toes the threshold with carefree ease. 
"You're not a land mine I You're not a gold mine I No you're not mine at all," Lee sings in "Into the Dark." 
For Lee, the journey to making this record comes in the wake of personal change on several levels. His split with Danes and his continual spiritual growth were both catalysts in working towards a new phases in his music. 
"This whole record stems from a change that is something I don't have the vocabu­lary to be articulate about," Lee says in a recent MTV.com article, "like that child­hood dream when you are in your house and you find a new room you didn't know about. That's what my life was like when I was making this record, almost like I remembered what I came for." 
The major issue with "Awake is the New Sleep" lies in its lighthearted nature. There's an unapologetic lack of weighti­ness about this disc, and the general tone of the album is one of blissfully inconse­quential pop. 
Is this a criticism or a compliment? Lee, it seems from the overall tone of the album, would find no fault with either. Instead, he seeks to and succeeds in mak­ing a series of lightly contemplative obser­vations on life and love, and in doing so, he is uncomplicated without being shallow. Ultimately at the end of "Awake Is the New Sleep," nothing major has been observed, learned or changed, and that's completely line by Lee. Certainly free from social com­mentary or serious reflection, the album and its listeners can and do relish in its willful lack of pretension.

reach 18 wins on the season. Most seasons, teams would be happy winning their conference and making the NCAAs. 
For the No. 8 Irish volleyball team, this season is different. 
Coach Debbie Brown describes her quintet of four­year vets as -simply put­hard workers and team players. 
"I think they all bring differ­ent strengths, and because of that, it helps keep the team really balanced," she said. "They're all leaders in their own way. It's a group that has a strong work-ethic." 
For the high-flying Irish, who expect to win every time they step on the court, this season is about winning the Big East for the 1Oth time in 11 years. But that is just one major step on their ladder of lofty goals. But, the ultimate goal is so lofty, it's not talked about. It's in the backs of their minds. It can't be talked about, perhaps because it would break their stellar focus. 
That ultimate goal, though, is obvious. It's as transparent as the holes in the nets on which they play. How so? 
Each time they've lost ­twice -the Irish say they're disappointed, similar to what any team would say. 
They say they need to respect every opponent they play ­typical. Yet, when talking to them, an observer could get the feeling they're more than disap­pointed. 
Each time they win, except for maybe a few of the upset victo­ries over top-ranked foes, the Irish and their coach say they aren't near satisfied with their performance. Every time they win, despite their win, the observer could get the feeling they're anxious. 
These Irish are hungry. After a sweep of a feisty Valparaiso team in the middle of the sea­son, the Irish walked off the court displeased, and there was a sense they wanted to keep playing. 
They wanted to suit up right then and there and take on their next opponent-beat up their next victim -because they hadn't played well for a stretch in the third game or because they should have won a few more points early on in a slow first game. 
"We're not really pleased with how we played," Brown said after that match. "We were just inconsistent. So, we had some bad spurts in both games one and three." 
This season is about more than making the NCAA tourna­ment and hosting a regional, something the Irish have done quite regularly in the past. It's about getting the monkey off their back -about getting to that elusive final eight of the Big Dance. 
The past 13 seasons, Notre Dame has made the NCAA tour­nament. Four of those seasons, it made it to the round of 16. Only one of those seasons, it made it to the final eight. And that was all the way back in 1997. 
With such a solid core group -including pre-season Big East player of the year Lauren Brewster, pre-season All-Big East pick Lauren Kelbley, Big East No. 4 in blocks Carolyn Cooper, Big East No. 4 in digs and undoubtedly the leader Meg Henican and, finally, the epitome of the phrase "team player" Kelly Burrell -the Irish realize they can create some­thing special this season. 
Throughout the season, they've told the media of their great team chemistry and confi­dence in each other. 
When asked about what lega­cy these five seniors can leave, Brown paused. She was most likely caught off-guard by the premature question. 
"We haven't really talked about what this group of sen­iors is going to leave, because I think we're still in the process of accomplishing that," she said. 
"We've talked as a team about where we are and the things that we still want to accom­plish."

What exactly do the Irish want to accomplish, then? 
None will say specifically. An observer, though, could easily get the idea that anything short of the Final Four would be a disappointment. Maybe, just maybe -because of their sin­cere disappointment after every loss and even after some wins -anything less than a national championship would be a disap­pointment. 
The last time the Irish lost, they went on a 15-match tear. Counting the last two regular season matches, the Big East tournament and the entire NCAA tournament, there aren't even 15 possible matches left. 
Notre Dame lost just last Sunday. Teams like No. 1 Nebraska or No.2 Washington don't know what it's like to lose. The Irish do. And they don't like it. In fact, they can't stand it so much that they never want it to happen again. 
So, what describes this group of seniors, one more time, coach? 
"It's a group that's competi­tive and committed to making this year the best in the history of Notre Dame volleyball," Brown said.

All this ber.ause of their outstand-Notre Dame beat the Cardinals in four games two weeks ago but wants to prove it is definite­ly not a co-champ. 

"Our team loves playing good teams, and we're really exdted to go into the tournament," Cooper said. 
"ITo] show that we don't need a share of the Big East champi­onship. We want to win the Big East championship. We're real­ly excited about possibly play­ing Louisville again." 
It's been eight years since the Irish made it past the first three rounds of the NCAA tourna­ment. And this, Cooper says, is the year that ehanges.

50 Cent soundtrack favors image over substance 

'The Road and the Radio' not a very exciting ride 

By TAE ANDREWS 
Scene Criric 
Wlwn 50 Cnnt rnleased his album "Cot Hich or Die Try in"' in 2003, it was tho most explosive album of' the year, packing morn heat on tho box charts than 50 dons in the waistband of' his jnans. 
By contrast, there's definitely morn of a chill f'nnl to "Get Hich or Die Tryin': Music From and Inspired hy the Motion Picturn," as if 50 mistakenly lel't the alhurn in the fridgn next to his bottles or Cristal or perhaps put it on ice in his lwdroom by pladng it amongst his vari­ous diamond-encrusted necklaces. 
Many of the CD's tracks continue in tlw trend of 50 Cent's collaboration with rapper Thn Garno on the hit song, "llat«~ It or Lovn It." The song combined an old-sdwol vibe with feel-good vocal samples to crnatn a sound that was simultarwously brand nnw and an hom­age to Motown. 50 Cent sticks with this winning recipe on "Hustler's Ambition," the first single off of the soundtrack. 
On "Best Friend," a thug love ballad reminiscent of his earlier hit "20 Questions," 50 reminds us that the ladies still light up his bullet-dimpled face. "What If"' is a eontemplative track in which 50 discusses the various possi­ble different ways he could have turned out. (Not surprisingly, none of his alter­native career paths included stints as a librarian or a male nurse.) Along the way, he manages to name-drop nearly every rapper or hip-hopper in the game, in the tradition of his inflamma­tory first single, "II ow to Hob." 
Dnspite its more subdued nature, the album is nonetheless very much in the vein of previous 50 Cnnt discs -it is a nonstop ode to the eopious amounts of lead 50 has !ired, drugs he's done and sold and women he's romanced along the way. Even better, 50's built a stable of talent to ride with. New additions to the G-Unit fold ineludn rap groups M.O.P. and Mobb Deep. Also, SO's origi­nal two sidekicks, Lloyd Banks and Young Buck are back. Although the latter's mediocre show­ing on this CD shows that he may still need to be shown the ways of the herd. What with all the new components

of G-Unit, you might think 50 would have a hard time getting his two quar­ters in, but he nevertheless manages to appear on every single track on the album. 
50 Cent is a cultural phenomenon ­he is America's most controversial music star because of his glorification of the gangster thug life. llowever, in his own way, 50 is also a criminal ver­sion of the epitome of the American Dream -having come from abject poverty, he has clawed his way up into multimillionaire status by virtue of his ability to sell drugs and survive bullets. Even more important than the massive tattoo which reads "South Side" across his broad shoulders, 50 wears the badge of street credit, which he has earned by surviving the gang warfare scene of inner-city America and nmnrg­ing on top. 
Buying a 50 Cent album is like buying designer clothing -you are purchasing image over substance. When you buy all 1S tracks of "Got Hieh or Din Tryin': Music From and lnspirnd by tho Motion Picture," you are paying twice for each and every on!l of tho nine bullets 50 survived in his infamous gangland shooting. It is as r·ival Nnw York city rapper Jadakiss so eloquently puts it in "Animal," a battle rap against 50: "You had to get shot nine times to be rich." 
The artist formerly known as Curtis Jackson sells albums by his iconic sta­tus, not by his skill as a rapper.

months on the road touring through out the year, he also dealt with the struggles of a short-lived, high-prolile marriage to actress Henee Zellweger (whoso role in Jerry Maguire was tho inspiration for Chesney's song, "You had me at Hello"), which she annulled after only four months. Since then, Chesney has been working overtime to put his life back together, while at the same time record­ing and promoting his latest musical efTort. 
One of the things country fan~ have come to know since the release of "No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems" in 2002, is that whenever Chesney releases a new CD, he will catch them with the first single and hold tight to his fans from then on out. This reputation may be thrown out the window with his nnwest record. Although the first single, "Who You'd Be Today" is a touching tributn to a lost friend, it fails to attract the same type of attention as the singles from his other recent albums, including "No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems" and 
"When the Sun 

bring Chesney back as country's king of the islands. But even in these songs, the themes of loss and searching aren't completely forgotten. In "Beer in Mexico," he sings of his plans to "let the warm air melt these blues away," and questions his life plan-"Maybe I'll set­tle down, get married I Or stay single and stay free I Which road I travel I Is still a mystery to me." 
The second track on "The Hoad and the Hadio," "Living in Fast forward," gives an interesting description of' Chesney as a "hillbilly rock star out of control." With a lazy rock tempo, its sound resembles some of Chesney most well-known songs and may be in the lineup for the album's next single.

In a recent intervinw with People Magazine, Chesney shared his bnlief that an album "should take you on an emotional roller-coaster ride. I've been on one." "Tho Hoad and the Hadio" does seem to take listeners on a ride through Chesney's emotions -the ride just might not be quite as exciting as he had hoped it would be.

Blue Jackets singing the Blues in Sergei Fedorov's debut 
Crosby's breakaway overtime goal gives Penguins the win 
Associated Press 
COLUMBUS, Ohio -Lee Stmnpniak had a goal and an assist in the third period, and Curtis Sanford posted his sec­ond c:arner shutout in St. Louis' 2-0 victory over the Columbus Blue Jac:kets on Wednesday night that ended the Blues' f'ranehisn-reeord, 11-game los­ing skid. 
The game was also Sergei Fedorov's debut in a Blue Jaekets uniform. Fedorov was acquired in a tradn with Analwim on Tuesday. 
Seott Young added a goal for tho Blues, who hadn't won since a :J-2 victory over Anaheim on Oet. 19. 
Sanford, spelling starter Patrick Lalime, stopped 36 shots in only his 1Oth NIIL ganw. 
Sternpniak, who scored the Bluns' only goal a week earlier in Columbus in a 3-1 loss, broke up tlw seomlnss game with 7:47 rnma1n1ng. Blue Jackets def'ensnrnan Bryan Berard's blind pass from the blue line went to Stnmpniak, who was all alonn coming in from the left wing on goaltender Marc Denis with Jan llrdina trying to cut him ofT. Stempniak coasted in front across the crease, faked 
and then flipped the puck past Denis. The unassisted goal was Stempniak's third of' the year. 
Young added an insurance goal with just 3:17 left, stretch­ing out his arm with his stick to redirect Stempniak's centering pass. 
Columbus, which has lost seven of' eight, outshot tho Blues 36-16 and had numerous prime scoring opportunities. The Blue Jackets wore 0-for-5 on the power play, running their man­advantage drought to 21 straight. 
Fedorov looked f'luid while shaking ofT jet lag -he arrived in Columbus on Wednesday al'ternoon after a 15 l/2-hour trip -to get ofT three shots in the opening period. 
Penguins 3, Flyers 2, OT 
Sidney Crosby scored his sec­ond goal of the game on a breakaway with 46.7 seconds left in overtime, leading the Pittsburgh Penguins to a victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on Wednesday night. 
Hyan Malone had a goal, and Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 45 shots, helping the Penguins improve to 6-3-2 since going winless in their l'irst nine games. 
Joni Pitkanen scored two power-play goals for Philadelphia, which had won nine straight at home. 
Crosby took a long, breakout pass from Malone near center ice, skated in alone and beat Antero Niittymaki to win it. 
Fleury stopped two point­blank shots by Mike Knuble and Mike Hathje in overtime. He started because a puck hit Jocelyn Thibault in the throat in warmups. Thibault's injury did­n't appear serious. 
Pitkanen scored his goals 1:34 apart to tie it after the Penguins had scored twice in a 56-second span early in the third. 
Pitkanen took a crisp pass from NHL assists-leader Peter Forsberg and one-timed a shot just inside the post to tie it 2-2 at 6:44 of the third. 
He slipped a shot between Fleury's legs to cut the deficit to 
2-1. 
Malone gave the Penguins a 1-0 lead with a power-play goal 
2:03 into the third. He got a pass from Crosby and slapped a shot past Niittymaki. Crosby stuffed one in during a scram­ble in front of the net to make it 2-0. 
Islanders 7, Thrashers 3 
Shawn Bates scored twice, including a short-handed goal in the closing minutes of the third period to help the New York Islanders to their third straight victory, this one over the Atlanta Thrashers on Wednesday night. 
Bates clinched the win with his eighth goal with just over seven minutes left and the Islanders leading 4-3 when he beat Thrashers goaltender Adam Berkhoel on a breakaway with his team down a man. 


Miroslav Satan, who also had two goals, made it 6-3 with about four minutes remaining. Jason Blake made it a rout with a power-play goal with 27 sec­onds left in the Islanders' high­est-scoring game of the season. 
Atlanta had outscored oppo­nents 19-2 in winning three in a row. Ilya Kovalchuk scored a franchise-record six goals in his previous two games, but was scoreless against the Islanders. 
New York took a 2-0 first­period lead. 
Bates opened the seoring just over six minutes in and Trent Hunter scored his third goal on a power play with about three minutes remaining in the peri­od. 
Atlanta's Jaroslav Modry scored seven minutes into the second period to make it 2-1, beating goalie Garth Snow on a 20-f'oot slap shot from the left side. 
The Thrashers were trying to match a franchise-best four wins in a row, whieh they did twice in 2003-04 -on Nov. 16­23 and on Dec. 6-12.

Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA-The Philadelphia Eagles could­n't win without Terrell Owens. Now they won't have Donovan McNabb. 
The five-time Pro Bowl quarterback will miss Philadelphia's game against the New York Giants on Sunday with a groin injury. 
Mike McMahon, who had been the third-string quar­terback, will get the start over backup Koy Detmer. 
McNabb's status beyond this week is uncertain. He'll see a specialist Thursday. McNabb has played through several lllJUries this season, including a sports hernia that will require surgery. 
He originally planned to have the surgery after the season, but it's possible he'll have it sooner. 
"It's pretty much a mat­ter of when I will have it. It'll be the first surgery I have, so I'm not excited about going under the knife," McNabb said Wednesday. 
"There are some ques­tions that have been answered and I am going to other people to hear their opinion and I will make a decision after­ward. 
"Us being 4-5 or 1-8 or 7-2, it doesn't matter. Being the quarterback of this team and the leader of this team, I want to be out there at all times. I have full confidence that we can turn this around." 
The reigning conference champion Eagles (4-5) have lost three consecutive games and are last in the NFC East. They've lost both games since suspend­ing Owens on Nov. 5. The All-Pro wideout was told not to return to the team last week following a series of incidents, includ­ing repeated criticism of McNabb and insulting the organization. 
McNabb put himself on the spot by saying the team was "better ofT' without Owens, its top playmaker. But he failed to back up his statement, throwing a crucial inter­ception that led to a 21-20 loss to Dallas on Monday night. 
McNabb reinjured his groin while trying to tackle Cowboys safety Hoy Williams after he misread the coverage and threw the pick. Williams returned it 46 yards for the go-ahead touchdown with 2:43 left. 
McMahon nearly led Philadelphia to the win­ning score after coming in for the last series. 

IN BRIEF 
Colts unfazed b_y Bengals'
Johnson, and fiis mouth 
INDIANAPOLIS-When receiver Chad Johnson speaks, the Indianapolis Colts laugh. They don't worry about Johnson's playful remarks, guarantees or even his cho· reographed celebrations. 
Instead, they're amused by the reg­ular act. 
But the Colts do have one item on their to-do list this week: Keeping The Mouth quiet Sunday when the NFL's last unbeaten team visits Cincinnati. 
"Whatever he has planned, I don't want to see it," cornerback Nick Harper said Wednesday, laughing. "He can save it for next week." 
Johnson's antics have included everything from sending opposing cornerbacks Pepto-Bismol bottles to holding up preprinted signs asking NFL officials not to fine him. He's done the Riverdance, the Salsa and now that the Bengals are into the second half of the season, Johnson is promising to bring out the "good" stuff. 
Whatever moves Johnson makes, the Colts seem to enjoy them. 
"I think it's funny, I think a lot of guys think it's funny," said wide receiver Brandon Stokley, who caught 10 touchdowns last season with nar~ a peep. Penn State looks to secure Big Ten title on Saturday STATE COLLEGE, Pa. -Kerry Collins, Ki-Jana Carter and Kyle Brady walked on to the Beaver Stadium field on a cool, dreary April day to the cheers of Penn State fans. 
Other members of the Nittany Lions' undefeated 1994 team were also on hand that afternoon for a ceremony during the spring scrim­mage to honor the squad that won the school's first Big Ten crown. 
Penn State hasn't won another since, but maybe that April event was an omen. 
The fifth-ranked Nittany Lions (9­1, 6-1) can secure at least a share of their second Big Ten title if they beat Michigan State on Saturday. 
"It's been talked about a lot ... to really bring back Penn State to where things were before," line­backer Paul Posluszny said about possibly ending the 11-year drought. Race collision injures jock­ey, kills two horses ANDERSON, Ind.-A jockey was injured and two horses euthanizod after an accident at the Iloosier Park horse racing track Wednesday. 
Jockey Hector Hosario Jr.'s horse, Version, fell heading into the first turn during the first race, unseating him. 
Another horse, Cape Fear, ridden by Stove Capeles, was also involved in the accident. 
The track veterinarian examined the horses, and both Cape Fear and Version were euthanized. track olli­cials said in a news release.

MLB 
Yankees.sign Matsui to 4-year, $52 million deal 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Hideki Matsui sat behind a table in Yankee Stadium, happy to know he will be back with New York for the next four seasons. Whether be remains in left field or is moved to center remains to be deter­mined. 
"He says, 'Whatever you want me to do,' but he did allow me the fact that center field is probably his most comfortable position," Yankees manager Joe Torre said Wednesday, a day after Matsui agreed to a $52 million, four-year contract. "He gets a jump even though he's not overly fast." 
New York knows poor center­field defense by Bernie Williams was a glaring weakness the last few years. With Williams now a free agent, the Yankees say they intend to add an outfielder. 
Brian Giles, a free agent who will be 35 next season, is among the players the Yankees are interested in -for center or left. 
"The little I saw of Giles was when he was with Cleveland," Torre said, going back to the late 1990s. "He was an extra player there and looked like a guy who could do some things. I'm talking about added dimen­sion to your ballclub, the fact that he can run, the fact that he's one of those hard-nosed type players." 
Joe Bick, Giles' agent, said his client could play a corner out­field spot or center. Giles hasn't played more than 17 games in one season in center since 2001. 

"I don't even know what the Yankees' plans are. That's for them to determine. It's not for us to dictate," Bick said. "Brian doesn't care where in the out­field he plays." 
Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said that Williams' agent, Scott Boras, called him Tuesday but that the Yankees weren't ready to talk about Williams until later in the offseason. Torre wouldn't mind having the 37 -year-old Williams back in a secondary role. 
"I still think that he's got baseball left, but a lot of it depends on the makeup of this club, if there's a fit for him," Torre said. 
Matsui is to earn $13 million in each of the next four seasons and gets a no-trade clause. He was coming off a $21 million, three-year contract in which he earned an additional $1.5 mil­lion in performance bonuses.

What is the Angelus? Does it have something to do with the chiming ofthe Basilica's bells? 
If you've ever been walking near the Basilica around the 12:00 noon or :00 pm hours, you may have wondered why the bells began to ring in a certain that is definitely not the same toll as they normally do on each hour. What heard was not, in fact, Quasi modo playing a trick on the Notre Dame com-by ringing the bells out of sequence, but rather the ancient Christian call to known as the Angelus.

By the 14th century, the tradition of the Angelus had developed to serve as means of allowing the laity to enter into the monastic call to prayer symbolized the ringing of bells. When our Basilica ·s tower rings the Angelus, you will hear series of three sets of three rings, each followed by a pause, and then a series of strikes in a row. As memorialized in Millet's famous painting The Angelus, ith the ringing of the church bells, people within earshot traditionally stop their and p~ay the following prayer as the bells ring: 
the first set of three rings: 

The angel l~f'the Lord declared unto Mary, and she conceived ofthe Holy Spirit. 
(Hail Mary, full of grace, ... ) 
uring the second set of three rings: 

Behold the handmaid r~l the Lord! May it be done unto me according to Yrmr Wlml. (Hail Mary ... ) 
the third set of three rings: And the Wort/ was llULdeflesh and dwelt among us. (Hail Mary ... ) 
the final nine strikes:

The veteran coach also said that although he has not changed his practices, there has been a visible difl'erence in the way the 2005 team goes through its workouts, especially with four out of the five scoring runners from last year's squad back to motivate the rest of the team.

Benninger said he feels the team's focus on this year's NCAA Championships will be an advan­tage come race time on Monday. 
"Racing's so mental, especially when you get to this level and everyone is equally as strong, equally as fit, and equally as good, that mental edge is just huge," he said. 
The junior has a routine of going through each race in his

"I just like to go over the raee

Turning the Paige 
Assistant captain Jason Paige is a physical presence for Irish 
By KYLE CASSILY 
Sporrrs Writer 
Jason Paige sets an example on and off the ice -but most definitely leads first with his body on it. 
The physical forward was named Irish hockey assistant captain at the beginning of this season by Notre Dame head coach Jeff Jackson, and for good reason. 
"He's one of the guys that walks the talk," Jackson said. "He's probably one of the more vocal guys on the team, but for a guy to be vocal you better be able to back it up with how you play and how you work in prac­tice and work in the weight room, and he does that." 
It was in the weight room prior to the start of on-ice work­outs that Jackson first noticed the leadership skills present in Paige, and the first-year coach knew he had found a player with solid potential. This is Paige's second year as an assis­

Squad runs from memories of 2004 
Irish runners hoping to soon wash bad taste out of mouths 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Writer 
Kurt Benninger raced out to the front -no one was ahead of him. He was in first place at the NCAA Championship meet and the feeling was a thrill. Unfortunately, the moment was over almost before it began and Benninger fell behind more patient runners, finishing 42nd as the Notre Dame men's cross country team, ranked No. 5 heading into the meet, finished in a disappointing 11th place. 
That was 2004. A year later, Benninger and the Irish are ready to erase some of their bad memories at the 2005 NCAA Championships Monday in Terre Haute, Ind. 
Notre Dame again heads into the meet ranked No. 5 in the nation, fresh off a second-place finish in the Great Lakes Regional last Saturday. 

But while 2005 has so far been a success, the Irish know they have to do well Monday to remember this year fondly. 
"Last year was a huge disap­pointment, both individually and as a team," Benninger said. "Since the day after the race none of us wanted to be in that position again. We just know that this is the meet we have to do well and this is everything for our season. What we've done up until now doesn't mean any­thing." 
Notre Dame coach Joe Piane said the team has been using last year's race as motivation ever since. 
"As soon as they crossed the finish line last year they knew they had not run up to their potential and they have been determined to change that the last 12 months," Piane said.

Three top 

seniors lead tea111 
By FRAN TOLAN 
Spom Writer 
On the surface, the 2005­06 Belles basketball team features three seniors in unfamiliar leadership roles. 
The squad lost four sen­iors from last year's team and saw the addition of a new coach this summer. What's more, two of the three seniors have never played in a regular-season game for the Belles. 
But that doesn't mean these seniors are poorly suited to be team leaders. 
Team captain Bridget Boyce, a second team All­MIAA selection last season, has played since she was a freshman and knows the ins and outs of the basket­ball program. 
Shelly Bender is new to Belles basketball but just completed her fourth sea-

Emotions to tug at squad Saturday 
Weis says team must stay focused on task at hand vs. Orange 
By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN Sports Writer 

There's no doubt emotions will be running high on Saturday when Notre Dame's seniors play their last game at Notre Dame Stadium. But Irish coach Charlie Weis wants them to stay focused on the task at hand -Syracuse, a team that beat them 38-12 in the final game of 2003, a 5-7 season for the Irish. 
"I have a seven-minute tape that I'm going to show them about the 2003 game here at 2 
p.m. [today], and that will be a very humbling experience for them and a quick reminder that this game is really about playing Syracuse as much as it is about being respectful to the seniors," Weis said on Tuesday. "You've got to respect your opponent." 
Syracuse, which is 1-8 with its lone win coming over Buffalo, is a team that has struggled all 

season. But the Irish cannot overlook the Orange if they want to keep a BCS bowl in sight. 
That's where Weis comes into play. 
"The biggest thing keeping us focused is Coach," Irish wide receiver Matt Shelton said. "He's obviously done a good job with the first season and the second season [Weis split the season in half for his team], and I think he's just going to keep doing it." 
And Weis won't go easy on his team as to avoid a letdown in the final stretch of the season that concludes next weekend in Palo Alto, Calif. with Stanford. 
"You never can let up on the players," Weis said. "It doesn't make a difference what level
