I roally am proud of' the person I've

Ferrufino added the immi­grants' countries of origin to McKenna's list of role players. 
"Countries where immigrants are from also have a stake [on the immigration debate)," she said. "Low-income families do as well. And many companies are taking their businesses to other countries, hurting Americans and immigrants." 
But rather than from a busi­ness angle, Carmona said he views the immigration debate "through the eyes of faith." 
"We have to examine the way Catholics interpret the issue," he said, emphasizing the need for immigration poli­cies that are in line with Christian principles. 
"The issue here is to protect the common good. Causing deaths at the border is immoral," Carmona said. 
McKenna agreed with him, saying the United States has an obligation to protect human rights both at home, at the bor­ders and beyond. 
The panel also discussed the challenges immigrants must cope with, as they are often unfamiliar with the English language and exploited by their employers in jobs that were already low-paying to begin with. 
Ferrufino lamented the treat­ment undocumented workers receive in the United States. . 

McKenna complemented Brauer's argument. 
"Immigrants cannot get the [preventive] care provided to legal citizens, so there is crowding in emergency rooms, as well as crowding in schools," McKenna said.

benefits of migrant work­ers to the American economy by asking if immigrants are good for Social Security. 
Brauer commented that the notion does hold some truth because while many undocu­mented workers pay taxes, they can't claim many of the benefits. 
"[Undocumented immi­grants] are not getting the ben­efits from Social Security or reaping the benefits from social welfare programs," she said. 
tions to these problems are not simple. 
"Any decision we make must be comprehen­sive," Carmona said. "I think the situation will get much better." 
McKenna said the need to address both the govern­ment's actions and the citizens' 

attitudes was part of the solu­tion. 
"We have to look at the pub­lic policy as well as the lan­guage we use to describe immigrants, which is insult­ing," McKenna said. 
The forum, which was open to anyone, was meant to con­tinue the debate that started in September's Notre Dame Forum on immigration.

"The works ask questions that are a superb fit for a university that seeks to explore religious and ultimate questions, such as, is God forgiving, and is salvation possible f()r a sinner?" he said. 
This year is not the University's first endeavor to incorporate a variety of academic subjects into a yearlong event, mathematics professor and eo-chair of' "Faust at Notre Dame" Alex Hahn said. 
"The idea was to bring many academic components together under one event that would have interdisciplinary themes," Hahn said. 
In conjunetion with "Faust at Notrn Dame," Mark Beudert, the director of the opera 'Faust 1859,' has worked for the past year on reconstructing this Opera Notre Dame production, which will be shown April 18-20. 
lie said that this opera will contain elements from Charles Gounod 's original version and has not been heard since it was produced in 1859. 
Beudert chose to use compo­nents of this version to more 
accurately represent Gounod's 
original idea and to include the 
dialogue Gounod wrote. 

"Performances of the original Faust were said to be more inti­mate in seale than the grand ·opera version, with dialogue that enhanced the 'human' dimen­sions of the story, a more com­plete development of the plot and an alternate and. we think, more compelling sequencfl of 
scones," he said. 

According to Beudert, the 
company had to reconstruct the 
dialogue in English and edit the 
score to creato Opera Notre 
Dame's version. 

Only two of the 56 cast mem­
bers are professional actors. 
Beudert said it was a challenge 
to cast undergraduates in an 
opera that professionals usually 
perform. 

The Film, Television and 
Theatre (FTI'l department is also 
celebrating the Faust theme with 
a rendition of Marlowe's "The 
Tragieall-listory of Dr. Faustus." 
Although Marlowe wrote this 
play more than 400 years ago, 
this production strives to make 
Faust relevant to a modern audi­
enee, Christine Sopczynski, FTT

Carlin said. "We want to pull

Carlin said FLEX will target

in student government but

similar to a program at 
Virginia Tech. 
"It would give !those not

FLEX will also allow fresh­
men to help in different 
aspects of student govern­
mont, such as helping plan 
community servic:e projects 
and learning about policy­
making in the Student Senate. 
"The goal is to educate 
freshman about student gov­
c~rnment," Carlin said. 
Several COH members wern 
wary of tho new ideas !'or 
FLEX, and several expressed 
concerns over possible over­
lap with the Freshman Class 
Council. 
"You don't want to step on the tcws ol' the Class Council," Student Union Board (SUB) eo-director of external affairs .Jnl'f Lakusta said. 
Class of 2011 President 
Cynthia Weber echoed 
Lakusta's sentiments, and 
said FLEX should include sev­
eral Class Council members 
because it would allow them 
to diversify their experience 
in student government. 
"It's almost a good idea to have people on Freshman Class Council also on FLEX because it is good to have people with both policy and programming experience," she said. 
Some COR members sup­ported the original idea of not allowing Class Council mem­bnrs on FLEX. 
"I think a major part of this is pulling in people who weren't successful in their run for Freshman Class Council," SUB treasurer Kadeja Gaines said. 
con mnmbers were also 
divided over the prospect of 
making FLEX something 
exclusive to the dorms. While 
some members thought this 
would allow morn people to 
get involvnd, others believed 
it would hurt students in larg­
er dorms. 
"I would hate to penalize a student for being in an enthu­siastic dorm," Class of 2008 President Bridget Keating said. 
In other COR news: 
+ COH unanimously approved freshman Nicole O'Connor as the Student Union parliamentarian and junior Dennise Bayona as the SUB co-director of program­ming. 
Bayona's nomination was originally delayed due to a rule that says no person can hold two different positions in student government. Bayona deeided to step down as vice president of Walsh IIall. 
"It was a really tough call and I had trouble sleeping that night," Bayona said. "But ultimately, I decided on which position would best help me strengthen my relationship with people."

experienced for good work to flourish," O'Hara said. 
Executive associate dean and law professor John Robinson praised O'Hara's leadership and commitment during the last decade. 
"Like her predecessor, Dean O'Hara has been fully committed to this law school's being recognized as both a top f1ight law school nationally and as one that, in the Catholic tradition, invites serious and sustained con­sideration of the normative dimensions of the law. She has invested an enormous amount of time and an equal amount of intelligence and imagination in achieving that objective." 
O'Hara's contributions to Notre Dame, however, were questioned in 2007, when the Law School dropped from No. 22 to No. 28 in the 
U.S. News and World Report Law School rankings. This was the program's largest drop since 2000. 
"The rankings are notori-

ously controversial, and sev­eral leading legal academics and law schools have point­ed out the lack of consisten­cy in the computation of these ran kings," said Katherine Kirkpatrick, sec­ond year law student and secretary of the Student Bar Association. 
She said it's natural for schools' rankings to shift from year to year. This year, 
U.S. News and World Report ranked the Law School again at No. 22. 
"I was confident that !the Law School] would rebound, and we did, back to a very solid No. 22. I think that reaffirms the notion that no one person or dean was responsible for a temporary slump." 
O'Hara said she is not cur­rently prepared to comment on her tenure because she still has a full year as dean ahead. 
"There are 15 more months before I step down as dean, and much to do during that time. Thus, I am not ready to reflect back on my tenure as dean just yet," O'Hara said.

did reflect on the ways the University's Catholic identity inf1uenced her leadership. 
"I can assure you that there has not been a day since I became dean that I have not thought about what needed to be done from the viewpoint of preserving and enhancing that [Catholic] legacy, not only for the stu­dents and faculty of the present time and for the cur­rent staff and alumni, but also for the future genera­tions of students, faculty, staff, and alumni we cannot know, but to whom we owe as great an obligation as that we owe to those who came before us," O'Hara said. 
Her decision to step down was announced more than a full year before the comple­tion of her tenure so University Provost Thomas Burish has enough time to assemble a committee to look for a replacement, O'Hara said. After taking a sabbatical she said she expects to return to teaching and continue being a part of' the Law School.

IN BRIEF 
WellPoint customer info exposed 
INDIANAPOLIS -Personal information that may have included Social Security numbers and pharmacy or medical data for about 128,000 WeliPoint Inc. customers in several states was exposed online over the past year, the health insurer said Tuesday. 
WellPoint, which has had other data security issues in the past, recently learned about the problem, fixed it and is notifying customers, spokeswoman Shannon Troughton said. The nation's largest health insurer by membership is offering free credit-monitoring services for those customers, but has received no reports of identity theft or credit fraud. 
The latest security lapse stems from two servers maintained by an outside vendor that Troughton declined to identify. The vendor spe­cializns in data management. 
WeiiPoint had learned early last year that a server was improperly secured, and that infor­mation on about 1,350 customers may have been exposed online and was vulnerable to Internet search engines. The insurer fixed that breach quickly, Troughton said. 
FDA triples heparin death count 
WASIIINGTON -Sixty-two deaths now are associated with contaminated batches of the blood thinner heparin, triple the previous esti­mate, the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday. 
That doesn't mean people still are dying -the latest deaths the FDA knows of occurred in February, the month Baxter International recalled contaminated batches. 
But dozens of deaths weren't reported to the agency when they happem~d. only later after the tainted blood thinner made headlines. 
On Tuesday, the FDA posted a month-by-month mortality count on its Web site, showing that a sudden jump in allergic-style fatal reactions actu­ally began last November -possibly signaling the time when the contamination began. 
The FDA's investigation found a compound derived from animal cartilage sneaked into sup­plies of raw heparin coming from China. Although sdnntists haven't yet proved the com­pound triggered the rnactions, it is the chief sus­peeL

House Dems debate housing crisis 
Party split over response to homeowners while Senate focuses on businesses 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Democrats are split over how to respond to the housing debacle, with House leaders focusing on helping homeowners facing foreclosure while the Senate moves to take care of businesses impacted by the subprime crisis. 
The Senate could pass its bipartisan, business-friend­ly measure, which showers some $25 billion in ta,x breaks on home builders and banks, as early as Wednesday. That's also when a key House panel is to consider a rival Democratic plan that instead steers tax breaks toward first-time home buyers and investors in low-income rental housing. 
The emerging rift clouds the prospects for a broader housing rescue plan that would have the govern­ment step in and insure $300 billion in restructured loans for homeowners star..: ing at foreclosure.

cious and improbable of Tournament victo­ries, and despite this Guest dazzling display of Columnist quicknnss and skill, I am lilh~d with great sense of regret. For I know that this is not really college bas­ketball that I am watching and that these exceedingly talentod basketball players are not really studont-athletes. 
In fad, though they mpresent their Universities so well in this great competi­tion, few (perhaps NONE) of these players that I am now watching will actually earn degrees from their sehools. According to the NCAA website, in the 2000-2001 school year, of those Memphis Men's Basketball players who had exhausted their eligibility, only 33 percent graduat­ed. On average, the Memphis basketball team has graduation rate of 30 percnnt. 
Kansas graduates a paltry 40 percent of il'i basketball players, on average. And perhaps saddest of all, none of the Afriean-Ameriean basketball players at the University of Memphis graduated in 2000-2001. None. Only one-third did so at Kansas in the same year. 
I mention this not to shame the players or diminish their accomplishment on the basketball court, and certainly not to make ill-conceived pronouncements regarding the role of money in college athletics, race, exploitation, or to com­pare Notre Dame athletes to those at oth­ers schools. I merely would like to sug­gest that all of us take this time to con­template how miserably these Universities, indeed all of' us, are failing these players. And I call on all of you to demand better. We should rise up and be awed by this abominable waste of poten­tial. Consider how we are all complieit in their failure. Consider how we watch silently as these players fail as students and seholars. And eonsider the vast resources that surround these students, the time and mom1y invested in these enterprises, and their failure to achieve is almost unfathomabh'l. 
What a loss for these wonderful human beings, these marvelously talented young men, who might have become our fellow professionals and eolleagues, as well as more informed and articulate citizens! What a shame! Opportunities for empow­erment, squandered. The ehance to transform families and future generations with education, frittered away. The prospoet of a new mind, an original voiee, a poet, an artist to be diseoverod, fos­tered, and opened up by the pursuit of aeademie excellence, p***** away. 
College athletes undergo a truly gruel­ing schedule. For those who take their roles as both students and athletes seri­ously, the physical and intellectual rigors are formidable. For these blessed and tal­ented young men and women to come together each day to train for many hours, all the while keeping up with the demands of family and faith, while still managing to master English Literature, History. and Physies-this is indeed a great and noble accomplishment and worthy of our admiration. 
Indeed, we are proud ofthese students because at their best they represent the best in all of us. They show us what is possible. In recognition of their example, Universities offer them scholarships because despite the faet that some of these great athletes may not be truly the best minds among us, to nonetheless suc­ceed in both arenas is exceedingly rare and requires a type of scholarly aptitude and dedication that is laudable and wor­thy of high regard. A great scholar OR a great athlete is to be respected. A great scholar AND great athlete is to be hon­ored, admired. 
On that note, I'd like to say thank you to all those NCAA student athletes here at Notre Dame and elsewhere who have 
managed to rise to this dual chalhmgc 
and succeed; you make us proud! But it is 
with great sadness that I have to eontem­
plate that so many of these groat athletes, 
from diverse ethnie and sodoeconomic 
backgrounds and from colleges a1:ross 
the nation, are not HEALLY college stu­
dents at all, and that it is not HEALLY 
"college" basketball that I am watching. 
Perhaps I am watc.hing two fine D-league 
NI~A teams, or some variation thernof, 
masquerading as 1~ollege basketball 
teams. I'm not surn, but I do know that 
they are interloping because they are . hardly college teams and the vast majori­
ty of these players can only be described 
as barely stud1ml'i. This is prolinmdly dis­
appointing. 
But much wors11, throughout the televi­
sion coverage, the interviews, the 1:olor 
commentary, not one word of this sad 
status quo was !ward. This is appalling! I 
suggest that we start to mmedy this situ­
ation by saying to anyone who will listen, 
"TillS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH." To the 
Board of Hegents, the NCAA, the U.S. 
Congress-It simply is not good enough. 
The seconds am ticking away ... Well 
done, Kansas! Your players perfilrnwd 
brilliantly. and you overcame gnmt odds 
and a fierce and talented Mmnphis team 
to win a stunning overtimo vietory. You 
are victorious and I eongratulate you. You 
have my respect, but not my admiration.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Speaker ignores 
students' wishes 
Unlike Joanna Cornwell {"Appreciate your speaker," Apr. 7), we actually are upset that neither Bono {nor Stephen, nor Benedict, nor George W.) were selected as our commencement speaker. 
Since the only large gatherings on campus must be pre-approved by the University (and thus a Continental Congress is out of the question) it would seem that the most effective way of expressing our grievances is through a Viewpoint arti­cle. You may call us snotty, you may call us arrogant, but you can't call us wrong. 
This isn't a matter of whether or not a speaker is "good enough," his credibility, or his credentials. Instead, this is a complaint about what we see as one of a long list of instances in which University administration ignores student opinions and desires in its decisions and operations. 
We are not complaining that Cardinal McCarrick has nothing to say to our gradu­ating class -in fact, he probably has a lot to tell us. In choosing Cardinal McCarrick, though, it is clear that the University made no authentic attempt to con­sider student wishes, even though the administration asked for our input. It seems unrealistic to expect that the University will select the exact candidate that we request. Sure, it would have been nice to see Stephen Colbert wishing us well, but we're not complaining because the fine DFA wasn't selected. 
Rather, we are frustrated that the University asked for our opinion and then took no consideration of it whatsoever. It stands to reason that if there was a genuine concern for our desires then our speaker would at least be similar to one of the speakers we requested. This demonstrated lack of regard for students characterizes the administration's request for student "input" as nothing more than indulgent patronization. While we can't say that the administration never had any intention of listening to us it does not take a high school diploma to figure out that the end result is far from ideal from the view of the class of 2008. 
So, while this woeful attempt at a semblance of democracy may be initially com­mendable, the administration's cavalier attitude toward our requests screams of tyranny. At this point it seems far too late to change anything for our commence­ment (though throwing a "Boston Tea Party" on the quad during Senior Week may heal our wounded hearts), but we hope that by voicing our concern, the administra­tion will take heed of student desires in future issues, including, but not limited to commencement. 
In the meantime we resign ourselves to simply this message (unless of course they attempt to put a stamp tax on our diplomas, in which case we would fear a con­frontation leading to the North Quad Massacre), and we call upon the fervent under­graduate patriots who will succeed us to take up our rallying cry: No tuition without representation! Sic Semper Tyrranis!

Shredding boxes woefully unsecure 
OIT: Please remove or replace your sensitive document shredding boxes from the residents halls. The current version of these boxes has an inexpensive lock that can be picked open with little training. An unscrupulous student can very easily open these boxes and have access to supposedly secure private data. 
While I commend your dedication to student privacy concerns, your current attempt was woefully inadequate.

GOP not pro-life 
I'm tired of the hypocrisy of so many so-called Catholic pro-lifers that feel they must vote Republican in order to preserve the sanctity of life. What about capital punishment? Torture? Unjust treatment of homosexuals? Of women? Of the poor and disadvantaged? The lack of contraceptives in Africa? The ongoing destruction of our only Earth? · 
Do these not also a!Iect the sanctity of life? I hope people will rethink their deci­sions to assume that the GOP is the beacon of truth and light in the political arena.

'V' word usage 
I'm only a guy and thus know less than nothing about such things. Also, I'd always hoped my first Viewpoint could be about something a little more pleasant than this. But alas, in reading Michayla Sullivan's letter ("Absurder was being satirical," Apr. 7), I won­dered why she was "bewildered" to find that a girl found the front page of the Absurder somewhat offensive. 
Don't worry, I won't resuscitate the Monologues debate; I'm only chiming in regarding that Absurder disagree­ment -namely, the other half of the play's title. And yes, I'm afraid I'm among the ranks of those "several people" who minimize naming in pub­lic what seemed to be the protagonist of said play. 
Doubtless this will seem overly Catholic to many students, and overly Puritan to many Catholics. Maybe it is. Give me a chance. 
Michayla applauds The Observer for satirizing a certain "embarrassment" and "fear" on campus about using the word. Well, satire is satire, I do know that, but I also know that many who support the article find this "embar­rassment" not only laughable, but wrong. It seems they feel that such "embarrassment" has been responsi­ble for past oppression of women and for continued violence against them, and that encouraging more people consistently to use those three sylla­bles in everyday conversation will help to end both those trends. 
That women shouldn't be made to feel ashamed of their anatomy, I agree. Of course I agree. My prudish silence is actually not meant to make my female friends ashamed of them­selves or to "put them in their place," unless that place is the station of respect that's theirs as women. Reluctance to name "it" is simply reluctance to make the word some­thing common, casual, worthless, dime-a-dozen, because it's not, and neither is any girl. 

What next? Does our culture's insis­tence on clothing likewise imply that women have something to be "ashamed of?" If people want so much to make the body part common parl­ance, simply because hiding some­thing results in unhealthy shame, then the next step might as well be a peti­tion for nudity. 
Somehow I'm guessing this would stop neither objectification nor sexual violence. As it is, the one-track attempt to get people to say the word more often can only damage what still remains of respect for girls as human beings. Having now maddened Michayla by my stubborn exclusion of the term as much as she maddened me by her use ofit, we're probably about even. It seems that what some would call an unhealthy embarrass­ment, I call a healthy respect. Most will probably say they don't need my stinking respect. They're right; they don't. It ain't worth much. But you know what? Too bad. They have my respect anyway.

Alcohol the cause of numerous social ills 
I am writing to honor Kelsey Robertson on.her deep and coura­geous commentary ("Consumption thought out," Apr. 8) on the problem of alcohol consumption that has rav­aged the campuses {or is it campi?) of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
While I agree completely with Robertson, I firmly believe that she should have taken it further. It is not just often I find myself disgusted at the behavior of good people under the influence; it is always. 
People should respect themselves as humans and intellectuals for I am sure that no intellectual has ever had a drink. No one should willingly sur­render body and mind to a liquid or video game or even an animal. Like Ms. Robertson, the "recreational con­sumption of alcohol is something I will never understand." Unlike Ms. Robertson, my problem is not with being awakened by "drunk girls shrieking in the hallways at 4 a.m." or even vomit on the sidewalks. 

My problem is when people talk about things like philosophy or poli­tics or life when they're drunk. Or when people give me hugs and tell me they love me. The worst is when people think they can actually dance. It's terrible. Shouldn't they know bet­ter? As for those "inconsiderate pigs" that compromise the safety and com­fort of you and me, I have a sugges­tion. They should be forced to listen to you read your Viewpoint letter aloud every single day of the academ­ic year. That will teach them to remember that the "world does not revolve around [them] and [their] drunken escapades"!

'30 RocK,' 8:30 P.M. 
So far this season: The "TGS" crew returns to work after the summer ofl'. but Liz still hasn't got­ten over her break-up with boyfriend Floyd. In a moment of panic and desperation, she buys a wedding dress she doesn't need and hits rock bottom. 
Jenna comes back with some extra weight after having to eat 32 slices of pizza a week starring in "Mystic Pizza: The Musical!" She loses the weight and a good story­line. Tracy's wife kicks him out of the house, but Kenneth helps the couple get baek together. Jaek starts dating a demoeratic con­gresswoman named C.C., but the star-crossed lovers struggle to stay together as C.C. is committed to her duties in Washington and Jack faees pressure at work and a pos­sible promotion. Jack chooses work over love and reminds Liz that she did the same thing. 
Jack has to give up his collection of eookie jars, Kenneth competes in a page-ofl', the "TGS" crew goes wild at Kenneth's annual house party, Liz tips ofl' her Middle Eastern neighbor to Homeland Security only to discover that he was just auditioning for "The Amazing Race," Uz dates a much younger man. and all hell breaks loose when Jack's mother decides to ruin the holiday spirits of the Lemon family. 
Stand-out-episode: "Rosemary's Baby." It's hard to pick just one stand-out episode, but a brilliant guest appearance by Carrie 
.·; Fiseher (complete with a "Star 
'.· Wars" referenee) makes this one of
,, 

the funniest episodes of an almost 
flawless seeond season. Fiseher 
portrays Liz's idol, Hosemary 
Howard, a eomndy writer from the 
urs 
sex and drug-ridden days of eome­dy sketeh shows who just doesn't belong in today's writing rooms. Meanwhile, Jack helps Tracy through therapy, and Alec Baldwin guarantees himself the Emmy after his one-man role play of Tracy's family. 
Stand-out character: Jenna. Jenna doesn't always have the greatest storylines. !leek, some­times she's even missing in episodes. But the "Jenna eomes baek fat" storyline was perfeet for the vain charaeter obsessed with her image. It's a storyline that eould have eome across as eruel, but instead it was just funny. Jenna inereased her eelebrity for accepting the fat and she even got her own T-shirt modeled after a truly stupid "Me want food!" idea. 
Tomorrow's episode: "MILF Island." While the "TGS" writing staff is obsessing over the season fmale of reality hit "MILF Island" (25 super hot moms, 50 eighth grade boys, no rules}, the Page Six eolumn leaks that a staffer on the show ealled Jaek a "Class A Moron." An inqui1>ition led by Jack's assistant Jonathan ensues. 
End of the season predictions: Jack loses the Chairman position to Devin Banks (after all, we can't have Jack Donaghy running so far away from "TGS") which would certainly guarantee more appear­ances by guest star Will Arnett. The Floydster leaves Cleveland and lunch at the Hock and Roll Hall of Fame with Little Richard to return to Liz. Kenneth the Page gets promoted beeause the page program technically only lasts two years, but he will refuse to surren­der his page jacket. Jenna reunites with ex-fiance David Blaine.

'THE OFFICE,' 9 P.M. 
So far this season: Jim and Pam are finally together -and they arc instantly boring. But while their young love blossoms, Angela and Dwight fall apart. It doesn't help that Dwight merey­kills Angela's eat, Sprinkles, and tries to replace it with new cat Garbage. Andy's speakerphone­barbershop quartet rendition of ABBA's ''Take a Chance on Me" for Angela couldn't come at a better time. 
Meanwhile, Kelly moves past Hyan and hooks her elaws into Darryl, who helps her to be less crazy. A jobless Jan moves in with Michael and quickly starts spending all the money he does­n't have. Ryan, who is now work­ing at corporate, launches Dunder Miffiin Intinity in order to bring Dunder Miffiin into thn digital age and increase sales. 
Michael hosts a Fun Hun for rabies, Jim and Pam spend a night at Schrute Farms, Dunder­Mifllin Scranton bands together to make a local ad that is ulti­mately rejected by corporate, Michael drives his car into a lake, and Jan and Miehael's rela­tionship becomes even more twisted during a company depo­sition. 
Stand-out episode: "Local Ad." It marked a refreshing return to the half-hour format after four tedious, hour-long episodes in a row and it gave us insight into Dwight's "Second Life." We also see Pam shine doing graphics and Jim get a tad jealous. "The Oflice" works best when it focus­es on the ensemble as a whole and in "Local Ad," we see the gang come together to make a commercial that really isn't all had. The episode is worth ing just to see Andy the lyrics to the "Kit

'SCRUBS,' 9:30 P.M. 
So far this season: Elliot and 

J.D. 
don't hook up in the season premiere, but Elliot realizes she doesn't want to marry Keith, and 

J.D. 
realizes that he needs to stop sabotaging his life. Kim gives birth to Sam, but J.D. doesn't love Kim so they end their relationship as a couple and begin their relationship as parents. 


Nurse Shirley appears during Kim's labor, looking remarkably like Laverne, who passed away last season. J.D. struggles with growing up now that he is a father, but Turk encourages him to keep some of his inner child. 
Dr. Kelso's real age of 65 is revealed and a board member tells him that he must step down as Chief of Medicine since 65 is the standard retirement age. Dr. Kelso wants the search for a replace­ment kept secret, Janitor gets a girlfriend, but we still don't know Janitor's name, J.D.'s brother is no longer a loser, and Dr. Cox is still Dr. Cox. 
Stand-out episode: "My Growing Pains.'' It's a standard "Scrubs" episode -goofy with a dash of sentimental drama. We see Turk and J.D. use their babies as pup­pel'l in the park and we find out about the existence of a third col­lege friend -Caramel Bear ­who disappeared after a prank gone wrong. After Dr. Cox chastis­es J.D. for not growing up, J:D. resists the temptations of Turk's many pranks. J.D. eventually gives in and we are treated to another appearance by "World's Most Giant Black Doctor.'' The episode ends on a low note -Dr. Kelso must retire. 
Stand-out character: Dr. Kelso. Every once in a while an episode hones in on the life of Dr. Kelso ­a character who at first seemed cold and heartless, but over the seasons has become increasingly multidimensional. He's the last person one would think would accept a gay son and even though he appears to hate his job, he real­ly loves it. That's why it is so heart­breaking in this season to realize that Dr. Kelso is mortal-his time at the hospital is rumiing out because he is being forced to retire. Can Sacred Heart survive without him? Maybe, but it sure won't be the same. 
Tomorrow's episode: "My Bad Too.'' Turk tries to learn Spanish to surprise Carla for the anniversary of their first date. Meanwhile, J.D. treats a burn victim and has to decide whether or not to allow the patient to attend his graduation. 
End of the season predictions: This could be the last season for "Scrubs.'' NBC didn't put the series on its fall lineup, but there's still a strong possibility that it will move to ABC since it is produced by ABC's Touchtone Television. But just in case this is the last season, here's what will happen. J.D. and Elliot will not get together. These two have never made a relation­ship with each other work and they are better together as friends. Elliot will reunite with Keith, but put marriage off. J.D. will either realize he loves Kim or he'll end up alone because he's too whiney. Dr. Kelso will retire but will be appointed to the hospital's board of directors. Dr. Cox will fmally tell 
J.D. that he's like a son to him. It will be weird. Turk and Carla will forever be both funny and adorable. J.D. and Turk's guy love will live for all eternity.

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Matt Stover, the Baltimore Ravens' veteran kicker, has begun a campaign to replace Gene Upshaw as executive director of the NFL Players Association by next March. 
Stover's action comes at a time when the union could be heading for crit­ical negotiations with the league on the collective bargaining agreement. 
"I feel that the board must begin to prepare for a change in leadership immediately," Stover said in an e-mail to the union's executive board and player representa­tives that was obtained Tuesday by ESPN. "I believ!'l we have the prop­er environment with our teammates and leader­ship within the board to execute the process of this selection." 
Union president Kevin Mawae of the Tennessee Titans said that Stover's opinion does not reflect the opinion of the players 
Upshaw, whose con­tract runs through 2010, has said he will not leave until the union gets through its latest negotia­tions with the owners, who are expected to opt out of their March 2006 agreement with the union next November. That would trigger a new round of negotiations. 
March 2009, the begin­ning of the last year with a salary cap if the con­tract is voided, could be a critical time in those talks 
The 40-year-old Stover, entering his 19th NFL season, said in a state­ment issued by the Ravens that it was not his intention for his e-mail to be made public. 
''I'm going to respect the process of our union leadership, executive committee and player reps. I choose to handle this matter privately," he said in a statement issued by the Ravens 
Mawae, elected last 
month as the union's new president, dismissed Stover's letter 
"Matt Stover's letter does not reflect the view of the entire executive committee or the board of player representa­tives," he said in a state­ment issued by the union. "The board is in the process of preparing for the possibility of a work stoppage and under­stands the importance of having Gene, with his experience and history, lead the direction of the NFLPA." 
Added former NFLPA president Troy Vincent: "It's absolutely ridicu­lous." 

IN BRIEF DrmPUaker to donate $10 per
stril{eout 
NEW YORK-Major league pitch­ers will soon have added incentive to strike out batters. 
Drugmaker Bayer AG will announce plans Wednesday to donate $10 to prostate cancer research for every strikeout during the regular season this year. 
Major League Baseball estimates the four-year partnership could add up to a little more than $300,000 per year. There were 32,189 strike­outs during the regular season in 2007, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. 
Bayer, based in Leverkusen, Germany, will give an additional $1 million to the Prostate Cancer Foundation if a pitcher sets a new record by striking out 21 batters in a game. 
Bayer's One-A-Day vitamins for men are marketed as a way to maintain prostate health. 
James to miss practice
for second day in a row 
INDEPENDENCE, Ohio -LeBron James didn't practice for the second straight day in order to rest his trouble­some back before the Cleveland Cavaliers begin their final push heading into the NBA playoffs. 
James, who has been dealing with back spasms for a few weeks, received treatment while his teammates pre­pared for Wednesday night's game against the New Jersey Nets. Cavs coach Mike Brown said Tuesday it's possible James could sit out. 
James was not available for inter­views. He was still on the massage table when the club wrapped up its post­practice media session. 
"We want him healthy in the playoffs," Brown said. "Yes, we want the fourth seed, but to get the fourth seed and have an unhealthy LeBron throughout the playoff run wouldn't do us any good. We've got to make sure that he's healthy and he's able to help us." 

Penn State wide receiver 
thrown off team 
STATE COLLEGE, Pa. -Suspended Penn State receiver Chris Bell was kicked offthe team Tuesday after univer­sity police charged him with threatening another player with a knife. 
The 21-year-old from Norfolk, Va., faces charges including terroristic threats and simple assault, both misde­meanors, after the encounter Monday night at a team dining facility. No one was hurt. 
"Chris Bell, who had been previously suspended from team activities, is per­manently removed from the team and will not be reconsidered to be a part of the team in the future," said a one­line statement relea._<;ed by Penn State athletics. 
Defensive end Devon Still told police he had spoken with Bell earlier Monday· and suspected that the backup receiver had taken a cell phone case from his locker, according to the criminal com­plaint. Bell denied the accusations.

Okur scores 22 points in Jazz's 77-66 vvin over Hornets 
Stoudimere leads Suns in 127-113 win over Grizzlies; Powell scores career high 18 in Heat's 95-88 win over Bulls 
Associated Press 
Mehmet Okur had 22 points and 17 rebounds to help the Utah Jazz clinch the Northwest Division and snap the New Orleans llornets' 11-game home winning streak, 77-66 on Tuesday night. 
Deron Williams had 16 assists and outplayed Chris Paul as the Jazz took a 20-point lead early in the fourth quarter and cruised from there, holding New Orleans to its lowest point total of the season. 
Peja Stojakovie scored 15 points for New Orleans, which shot a woeful 3-of-14 on 3-point­ers and 37 percent overall as its live-game winning streak eame to an end. David West had 14 points. 
Paul had a rare ofl' night, fin­ishing with nine assists and only four points on 2-of-11 shooting. 
Utah has won four straight games and seven of its last eight. Okur has lml the Jazz in scoring in the last three. lie scored all but two of his points in the first throe quarters on S-of-16 shoot­ing, with a pair of 3-pointnrs. 
Carlos Boozer, Andrei Kirihmko and Paul Millsap each srornd I 0 poinL'i for Utah, which shot 44 perennt and outn~bound­ed Now Orleans 47-36. 
Paul missed his first seven shots and did not seem~ until he hit a driving floater with 7:50 left in the third quartor. That started a 6-0 run that pulled the Hornets as close as 49-46. 

Okur then hit a pair of free throws and later made a 3 dur­ing a 19-4 run to dose the third quarter. 
When Millsap muscled his way in for a tough putback as he was fouled early in the fourth, the Jazz led 70-50. 
New Orleans held a 35-34 lead in a seesaw first half after Jannero Pargo's jumper midway through the second quarter. The Hornets failed to score for the rest of the period, however, missing their last 16 shots, and Utah took advantage with a 9-0 run. 
Okur, who had 15 points in the first half, scored four during the run and capping it with a 19-foot jumper, giving Utah a 43-35 lead at halftime. 
Suns 127, Grizzlies 113 
Amare Stoudemire had 2S points and 11 rebounds, and the Phonnix Suns bnat the Memphis Grizzlies 127-113 on Tuesday night despitn playing without an injurnd Shaquille O'Neal. 
Stoudomire shot 1 0-of-13 from thP field as the Suns won their eighth straight over the Grizzlies and moved a half-game behind thn idle Jlouston Hockets for the fifth spot in the Western Conference playoffs. 
Baja Bell scored 18 points for Phoenix, while Grant llill had 
17. Stevs Nash and Leandro 
Barbosa finished with 16 points apiece, with Nash handing out eight assists. Gordan Giricek added 14 points and Boris Diaw scorod 12. 
The Suns were without center Shaquille O'Neal, who sat out with a right hip contusion. O'Neal, who was injured in Sunday's loss to Dallas, was dressed in street clothes on the Phoenix bench. 
Rudy Gay matched his career high with 36 points for Memphis. Mike Conley finished with 19 points and five assists before fouling out in the closing minute, and Kyle Lowry had 13 points ofT the Memphis bench. 
That didn't matter because 
... 

Stoudemire dominated the inside against the Grizzlies. In the sec­ond half, the Suns added the outside shooting of Bell with help from Barbosa and Giricek, and Memphis never really threatened after Phoenix built the lead to double digits in the third period. 
Gay made it a bit interesting with 16 points in the fourth quarter, hitting a 3-pointer with 
2:34 left to pull Memphis within 114-106. But a 3-pointer by Nash put Phoenix back ahead by double digits. 
Heat 95, Bulls 88 

Baek in the NBA, Kasib Powell gave the Miami Heat the type of effort they've lacked most of the season. 
Powell scored a career-high 18 points, leading the Heat to a 95­88 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday night that snapped a seven-game losing streak. 
Ricky Davis and Chris Quinn each added 16 points as five players scored in double ligures for the !!eat, the day after coach Pat Riley was elected to the Hall of Fame. 
"We got in ·such a habit of playing with talent only and thinking that talent was going to take care of the lack of efl'ort," Hiley said. "These guys are just unadulterated. Effort is a big part of what our culturo is."

NCAA BASKETBALL Kansas vvorried about coach leaving for OSU . 
Associated Press 
Kansas coach Bill Self slept for less than an hour after the Jayhawks stunned Memphis in one of the more memorable fmals in NCAA tournament histo­ry, wrapping up their first national title in 20 years. 
The details of the Jayhawks' 75-68 overtime victory will soon be etched in Kansas lore. After Memphis missed a series of free throws, Kansas guard. Mario Chalmers hit a 3-pointer with 2.1 seconds left to send the game to overtime, where the Jayhawks overwhelmed the Tigers. 
Now Kansas fans may begin losing sleep over whether their coach is headed for Oklahoma State. Less than 12 hours after cutting down the nets, a bleary­eyed Self returned to the Alamodome on Tuesday morning and faced questions about whether he's interested in the job at his alma mater, which parted ways with Sean Sutton on April1. 
As he has for a week, Self said he plans to meet with Kansas officials soon about a contract extension. 
"What I'd like to have is like everybody'd like to have," Self said. ''I'd like to have some secu­rity. I don't know what even Kansas would remotely be talk­ing (about). We haven't even talked about that. When I say security, I mean years, so hope­fully that'll happen." 
Citing factors such as Kansas' rich hoops tradition, Self said, ''I'm not looking for more than what Kansas provides on a daily basis." 
The school gave Self a five­year contract extension last sea­son, increasing his annual com­pensation to more than $1.3 mil­lion with a chance to make another $350,000 each year if he meets incentives. 
But Self could likely command far more money from Oklahoma State, whose billionaire alumnus Boone Pickens, gave $165 mil­lion to the school's athletic department. 
Self said he hasn't met Pickens and wasn't familiar with details about Oklahoma State's pro­g.ram. But he drew a chuckle from reporters when he said, "From the outside looking in, it appears that they have great resources." 
Kansas fans have become accustomed to a certain amount of anxiety over losing a talent coach. Roy Williams flirted with, and eventually left for, his alma mater, North Carolina. 
Kansas followers exulted when their team defeated Williams and the Tar Heels in the national semifinals, but Williams turned up at the final wearing a Jayhawks sticker on his shirt.

totaling 12 hits, eight HBis, seVfm runs and two horne runs. Scherer also had three multi-hit games during the Eagles' swing through California. 
Taking the mound for the Irish against this impressive duo will be the one-two punch of junior Brittney Bargar (17-6) and fresh­man Jody Valdivia. 
Bargar won Big East pitcher of the week honors with a 5-0 reeord and a perl'nct 0.00 EHA while striking out 27 over 27.1 innings of work. 
Valdivia has come down some­what from her strong start of the s1mson, but the Irish ofl'ense and Bargar have lifted her, allowing tlw fn~shrnan to learn sonw valu­able lessons and work her way out ofjams. 
Senior second basemen Katie Laing took Big East Player of the year honors for the second time this season this week. 
Laing went I 0 for 19 on the wenk with 13 HBis, five runs, four home runs and one double for a .526 batting average and a 
1.211 slug1,ring pnreentage. Laing also stole two bases. 
The Irish will then begin their nnw era in newly constructed Melissa Cook Stadium against Hutgers and Villanova Saturday and Sunday.

sophomore co-captain Lisa Rubino defeated Leanne Schudder 6-1, 6-1; and No.6 freshman Laura Arnold finished 
· off singles for Saint Mary's with a 6-2, 6-1 win over Kristen Wolfolk. 
The Belles continued to domi­nate Olivet in doubles as they swept the division 3-0. The No. 1 pair of Gebert and Hurley won 8-1 over Mummaw and Utberg for their sixth win as a team, putting them at 6-7 this season. The No.2 duo of Rubino and Reed continued Saint Mary's streak with an 8-1 win over Gruber and Schudder. The No. 3 team of Kosinski and freshman Franca Peluso com­pleted the sweep with an 8-1 win over Griffes and Wolfolk. 
"It is a pivotal match for us this season, we're on par with them, and I think we can beat them," Rubino said. "It will be a close match either way with possibly some tie breakers and third matches that we're going to have to win." 
Saint Mary's will try to carry its domination in both divisions today, but may have some com­petition from junior Sammi Stille, senior Christine Garcia, and sophomore Danielle Werley, Hope's No. 1, 2, and 3 in singles, respectively. Stille went 2-1 this past weekend at the GLCA tournament at 
· Oberlin, Ohio, putting her at 8­6 for the season. Garcia is only at 3-10 for the 2008 season, but holds an 18-23 record for her career at Hope so far. Werley also went 2-1 over the week­end, putting her at 6-7 for this year. 
"A lot of the matches will probably be close, we have to work to get over the hump and win those matches," Lisa Rubino said. "I think we are ready to compete again, after having some time off. It was nice to get a break, but we are excited for the challenges ahead." 
Coach Rubino outlined the Belles goals for today's match, recognizing what his team needs to improve to win. 
"Our goal is to improve our consistency, and staying in the match mentally. It's going to be 
a. close match and we're going to have to win enough matches to beat them," he said. "Hopefully we have enough mental consistency to beat them at this point."

The Belles. finished third in the MIAA during the fall season but will try to use the momentum from their spring season success to push them to the top of the standings. 
In their last tournament, the Tri-State Invitational, thfJ Belles finished well, placing third out of ten teams. 
Tri-State, who finished second in the MIM in the fall, finished 11 strokes behind Saint Mary's in fifth place. 
In the fall, the Belles had to count on senior Katie O'Brien to single-handedly lead the team. 
Now, others have begun to step up and place well individually. 
Freshman sensation Rosie O'Connor has used the spring to show-off her improvement..<; from the fall season. O'Connor has shot near or better than O'Brien in the Belles' last two tourna­ments. 
Freshmen Emily Gore and Junior Perri Hamma have also been playing much better taking 11th and 25th respectively in the Tri-State Invitational.

expects it to have a special atmosphere. 
"It delinitely will have a post­season feel. They're in the· same spot we were in at this point last year," Louderback said. 
On April 9, 2007, the Irish were 20-1, in the midst of a 15-game winning streak, and had already defeated 
5 junior Georgia Rose, and No. 25 sophomore Samantha Murray. 
In addition, the Wildcats have sophomore Lauren Lui who, at No. 42, is their fourth best singles player. For com­parison, Notre Dame's singles attack, which is strong and has consistently been winning five or six points a match, boasts just two ranked players -No. 41 junior Kelcy Tefft and No. 122 sophomore Cosmina Ciobanu.

meeting of the Sunday season, the because Wildeats got Jay Louderback Louderback their revenge opted to have

with a 5-2 win. 
"It should be a great match and our kids are really excited," Louderback said. "They did a great job the last couple matches not looking ahead to Northwestern. They've talked a little bit the last few days, and they are def­initely ready for it." 
Louderback is fully aware of the elite competition coming into town but knows few teams are perfect. "They're really good at the top -their top three are all ranked nationally, and they're deep," he said. "They have been switching their doubles around, so I think winning the doubles point will be the key for us because our doubles [teams] have been really good the last half of the season." 
Northwestern's top three sin­gles players are nationally­ranked No. 3 Maria Mosolova, a freshman from Moscow, No. 
Tefft sit-out per 
NCAA rules for 
playing too many matches in 
the fall. 

The lineup shift moved soph­omore Kali Krisik up to No. 1 doubles alongside senior cap­tain Brook Buck and put fresh­man Denise Ellison on the court for the first time this dual season alongside junior Katie Potts. 
Sophomore Colleen Rielley and Ciobanu stayed together in ihe No. 2 slot, and all three pairs triumphed. Ellison also made her singles debut in the No. 6 hole, losing in three sets, 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (7-10), 1-0 (11­9). 
Louderback was pleased with Ellison's performance. 
"It was great for ·her to get her first match in. She played really well in doubles and just lost a close one in singles," he said. "l think a lot of that was just it being her first singles match, but it was great for her see what it's like playing out there." 
The shuffling also pushed Buck into No. 1 singles, and she triumphed easily 6-0, 6-1. The team is deep and even, but the prominent senior leader­ship of Buck is undeniable. 
"She played well in singles and did great in doubles, too. She and Kali IKrisik I had not played together besides one match in the fall, but [Brook] did great in both," Louderback said. 
The team's momentum has led to clinching matches early, but Louderback said the com­petition has been anything but weak and likes that his players keep the pressurn on all match long. 
"We've had a couple of matches recently that we've won 6-1 and 7-0 that were still good matches -Indiana, Iowa, and Syracuse. Especially in the Iowa match, we just played really well," Louderback said. 
The growing momentum has also coincided with the match­es starting to move outdoors. The Irish success outside serves as good preparation for the outdoor venues of postsea­son play. 
"All our singles players have looked good, and we've played so well in the doubles, too. The opportunity to get outside and play some outdoors matches has been good and will really help us," Louderback said. 
Wednesday at 3:30 at Courtney Tennis Center, the Irish will try to notch their first win in school history over the No. 1 team in the eountry.

By MICHAEL BLASCO 
Spons Writer 
Notre Dame eonduded its rng­ular season this week with a fourth-plaee finish at the Canes and Cardinal Classic at the 6210-yard, par-72 Don Shula Golf Club in Miami, marking the final tournament for the No. 25 Irish befon~ the Big East and NCAA tournaments at the Mid of the month. 
Notre Dame freshman So­llyun Park scored an even-par 216 for the event to finish tied for second overall, while the Irish carded a round-low 289 on Tuesday to slide into the top live. Notre Dame coach Susan Jlolt liked her team's efl'ort. 
"[The course) gave us an opportunity to shoot some good scores," Holt said. "It's impor­tant to get our confidence up heading into the Big East tour­nament." 
No. 27 Louisville, which opened the tournament Monday with a week-low 284, cruised to a comfortable first-place finish, its 7-over 871 was 13 strokes ahead of the pack. 
Furman University and Georgia State tied for second with 884, 20-over, while the Irish placed fourth with a 22­over 886. Tulsa rounded out the top-five with a 24-over 888. 
Louisville junior Cindy Lacrosse earned medalist hon­ors with a 4-under 212, four strokes ahead of Park and two others who tied for second. The top-two finish was the fifth of Park's young career, who has led the Irish in scoring six teams this season and has finished first overall twice. 
Fellow Irish freshman Katie Conway finished tied for 11th overall, shooting a personal sea­son-best 4-over 220. Holt attrib­uted the team's success to both preparation -in spite of the South Bend weather -and familiarity with the course. 
"We've been able to get out­side a bit here at home and it's the most we've been out this year and the team is putting up good scores," Holt said. "I am very familiar with the course there because when I was head coach at South Florida we'd play there every year for the Florida state collegiate champi­

Northwestern looking for 33rd straight win 
By MATT GAMBER Associate Sports Editor 

The road swing continues for No. 8 Notre Dame, and it won't get any easier tomorrow with a match-up at No. 1 Northwestern. 
The Irish (9-3, 2-1 Big East) have won thn first three games of a five-game road swing, including a 12-8 upset of No. 7 Duke last Thursday. The Wildcats (11-0) boast a slightly more impressive streak, though, as the three-time defending national cham pions have now won 32 straight. 
"We feel confident with our game plan and we've been working on it the last eouple of days," eoach Traey Coyne said. "I feel like we're in a position right now obviously playing to win, and in order to have that happen ... we're not going to completely shut them down, but we need to eontain some of their best offensive threats." 
The Irish do have the top seorer in program history on their side, though . .Junior attack .lillian Byers seored three goals against Duke to become the most prolifie goal­scorer in Notre Dame history, passing 2006 graduate Crysti Foote's 161 earner goals.
