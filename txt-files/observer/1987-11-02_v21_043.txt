ND raises 2nd highest development amount ever 
ByKIMBERLYTRENNER Senior Staff Reporter Notre Dame's Department of Development raised $45.8 mil­lion dollars in fiscal 1987, the second highest amount of money in the institution's his­tory. The figure is only topped by the $48.3 million raised in fiscal 1986 and is almost double the $24.2 million received in fiscal 1984. All of the money included in these figures are cash con­tributions, not pledges. "Notre Dame continues to rank high on the list of private universities in most fund­ raising categories," Joseph Sandman, Director of Develop­ment for Notre Dame. Recent rankings place us first in sup­port from parents, tenth in cor­porate matching gifts and seventeenth in total dollars raised, according to Sandman. Sandman attributes the suc­cess of the fund-raising to new development programs. "In the last four years since Dr. Sexton,-the Vice President of University Relations, · has taken over, we have imple­mented a number of new devel­opment programs which for the first time have given Notre Dame a comprehensive devel­opment program," said  Sandman. "Some of the pro­grams used for development are a strong annual fund pro­gram, a campaign once a de­cade and strong planned giving," added Sandman. Notre Dame is currently raising money for its $300 mil­lion campaign, 'Notre Dame: A Stategic Moment,' which was announced in May. It is the largest fund-raising effort ever undertaken by a Catholic uni­versity. At the end of fiscal 1987, a total of $216 million, or 72 percent, had been given or committed to the five year campaign. The money raised in this campaign will go towards  buildings, fellowships, scholar­ships and libraries. Regarding this year's fund­raising, Sandman said, "We expect to increase the amount of cash we are going to secure...We are shooting for a goal of $48 million." "We are definitely ahead of last year's rate,'' he added. Sandman cited several reasons for Notre Dame's tradition of generous support from alumnae, parents, corpo­rations and friends. "Our con­stituency endorses the mission of the university,'' he said. "What we do is not being pursued by other universities. We have a very strong under­ graduate program which we will not let suffer, unlike Har­vard, Yale and other great re­search universities." Sandman said that people also give to Notre Dame in or­der to help the University achieve its aim of being able to compete with other great uni­versities in the area of re­search. "We are striving towards excellence in graduate education and research,'' he said. "We know we have got to improve."

Many tourists seem to be blinded by cameraflashes 


A friend of mine loves taking snapshots. But she pulls out her camera at the most awkward times. 
Restaurant employees in at least three states fear our approach because she always hands her camera to a waitress and insists she take a picture of the five or six of us gathered around one side of our dinner table. And the flash and commotion bring stares from all over the room. 
Though the whole process annoys everyone involved at least a little, she does accomplish something important. She captures a memory, and that's the whole point of snapshot photog­raphy. But some people let flash photography blind them to the things they should be seeing. 
While in Washington, D.C., recently, I watched a bunch of tourists pile off a bus. They immediately began scurrying around taking snapshots. The scattered, lighted memorials of the mall in Washington, D.C., looked beautiful, but the pitch-black night guaranteed that none of the tourists' photos would come out. 
At the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a hus­band and wife stood in front of the statue of the three soldiers. The couple complained about the poor lighting on the statue. As the husband focused his camera, his wife told him to hold the camera vertically because the statues were tall. Neither commented on the realism of the 
figures or the deadness in their eyes. Neither walked behind the statue to see why the figures were looking off to the side rather than straight ahead. 
The figures were looking at the wall. 
No veterans wept at the wall that day. A fam­ily from the tour bus scrambled around with a list of six names a friend had given them. They didn't know anything about the people on the list. Their goal was to find the six among the columns of names etched into the wall and make pencil and paper rubbings of them. They worked as fast as they could. No one in the family paused to think about why the names were on the wall. Neither parent bothered to explain that those thousands of names were the names of dead people. 
The family members did try to take closeup photographs of the six names, something they might look at later when they had time. But no one took a picture of the whole memorial. In fact, the beauty of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is that it defies people who try to take its picture. 
Jim Riley 
News Editor 

As another visitor wandered toward the memorial, he found that trees and ropes prevented him from approaching the wall head­on. Ifhe'd had a camera, he couldn't have taken a picture of the whole thing if he'd wanted to. He was forced to start at one end of the wall and walk close to it where he could read the names. 
The wall started as a small triangle at his feet. But as we walked along the wall, the side­walk sloped downward and the wall became taller as the triangle of black marble widened. The handful of names at his feet became an overwhelming wall of names, and soon he had descended so low that he could no longer see over it. As he quickened his pace, the growing wall peaked and began to get smaller again. 
I watched him turn around as he reached the end of the wall. He gazed back in the direction of those thousands of names. And he saw dozens of nameless tourists, wasting film in the dark, taking pictures of things they had never really seen.

Radiation poisoning raises questions 

Associated Press 
ANGRA DOS REIS, Brazil ­The radiation poisoning of more than 200 people has raised serious questions about the government's ability to control its ambitious nuclear program, which includes the technology for atomic weapons. 
This vast nation of 138 million people has one atomic power plant on line -in the quiet fis­hing community of Angra dos Reis -and two more planned. But it has no site for safely dis­posing of nuclear waste. 
The navy minister has an­nounced plans to make fuel for atomic submarines, even though Brazil doesn't have any nuclear-powered subs. 
Last month's poisoning of 243 people in the central city of Goiania occurred just one month after President Jose Sar­ney proudly announced that Brazil had mastered the tech­nique of enriching uranium, a necessary step in building an atomic bomb. 
A scavenger took a capsule of the isotope cesium-137 from a partly demolished cancer treatment clinic. A junk dealer broke open the 500-pound lead casing and found about 3 ounces of a phosphorescent powder which he and others confused with catnival glitter. 
By late October, four people who had rubbed the cesium on their bodies, including a 6-year­old girl, were dead. Seven others remain hospitalized with little chance of survival. 
It was considered the world's most serious nuclear radiation incident since the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl reactor in the Soviet Union that took more than 30 lives. 
Rex Nazare, the president of the national Nuclear Energy Commission, said on nation­wide television the Goiania in­cident would not affect Brazil's nuclear program, which he declared safe. 
"Our conscience is clear," he said. 
But many people say Brazil's thrust into the atomic age is downright dangerous.

PARIS -A scandal that some reports are calling the French Irangate is brewing over the sale of munitions to Iran by a French arms manufacturer with the alleged complicity of high Defense Ministry offi­cials. 
According to articles pub­lished over the weekend in the local press, an investigating magistrate in Paris is seeking to have a Defense Ministry report on the sales declassified so charges can be brought against several people. 
What is known as the "Luc­haire Affair" involves the clan­destine delivery of 450,000 ar­tillery shells to Iran between 1983 and 1986 under the Socialist government of Premier Laurent Fabius.

Campaign launched 
Security Beat
against pornography 
Associated Press 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -The opening shots in a war against hard-core pornography -a $300,000 campaign including billboards, a newspaper insert and a TV program -have been fired in Kansas City by ac­tivists who say tHeir target is dehumanizing and dangerous. 
Their critics, however, say the group is using scare tactics 
and exaggerating the problem to arouse the public, and they raise the specter of censorshipdown the road. 
The anti-porn drive was a 
test, organizers said. A na­
tiona! group may take the cam­
paign throughout the country, 
depending on its evaluation of 
the Kansas City effort. 
The campaign launched over 
the past month by the National 
Coalition Against Pornography 
and its local affiliate urged 
people to Stand Together Op­
posing Pornography, or STOP. 
It featured 80 billboards, a two-
hour television program, direct 
mail pleas, a 12-page newspa­
per insert and a phone bank to 
take calls from financial con­
tributors. 
"If enough of us stand to­
gether, we can provide the sup­
port our public officials need to 
take on the pornographers and king public officials to enforce obscenity laws. 
"It is designed to communi~ cate with virtually every adult in the Kansas City area," said Chris Cooper, full-time direc­tor of the coalition's Kansas City branch. 
He called the group's fund­raising efforts during tne month-long campaign that ended Saturday "very success­
ful. , 
Cooper said grass-roots sup­port was one reason Kansas City was chosen for STOP's 
debut. He also said coalition of­ficials believed a large amount of obscene material is dis­tributed here, though he said the level may be typical for a city of a half-million people. 
The leader of the national or­
ganization, Presbyterian mini­
ster Jerry Kirk of Cincinnati, 
said the Kansas City results 
will be evaluated before other 
cities attempt a similar effort 
to depict pornography as not 
just offensive, but dangerous. 
But the campaign has drawn 
criticism for statements such 
as one that Kansas City faces 
an "epidemic" of pornogra­

Open your eyes to the problem of poverty 
As the cold winter months near, studens at Notre Dame can rest as­sured they will receive proper clothing, shelter and food. Yet, many of us fail to realize that numerous people are not as fortunate and lack the basic neces­sities to live a decent life. The time has come to ooen our eves. 
Rob Hahn 
guest column 
It has been over twenty years since President Lyndon Johnson declared his War on Poverty. Unfortunately, evidence shows that poverty has been victorious. Americans, on the whole, appear to be concerned. But let's face it. It's much easier to turn away from the problem, and that's what most Americans do. According to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., "the components of this economic revolution have been so complex, and the results so persuasive, that it is easy to overlook it." (welfare and poverty.) 
The problems surrounding the poor and welfare recipients exist. For exam­ple, speaking at Notre Dame a few weeks ago, economist John Kenneth Galbraith shed light on one of these main problems. Americans, according to Galbraith, go through a process of psychological denial, whereby convinc­ing themselves problems regarding the poor do not exist. In many instances, people's acknowledgement of poverty and welfare programs stops here at this psychological barrier. But for some, recognition of the problem goes a bit further where certain myths are en­countered. 
Welfare has had trouble succeeding because so many Americans are under the assumption that welfare recipients are too lazy to work or actually enjoy being on welfare. In reality, though, many of the recipients are unable to work for various reasons and do not like being on welfare. There is a definite need to educate these people as to how to help themselves. The welfare pro­gram has encountered more difficulties over the past twenty-two years. 
Within our government, where social programs are supposed to originate, there is an ideological conflict between Democrats and Republicans. Both the liberals and conservatives appear to show interest in welfare reform. But when the Democrats, long known for their social programs, look to redistribute our nation's income in an attempt to alleviate some of the prob­lems faced by poverty stricken individ­uals and families, they are faced with a Reagan Administration full of nice sounding welfare-related rhetoric, but also unwilling to cut military spending and raise taxes. A possible answer to begin to solve the poverty and welfare problems may be an outgrowth of this conflict. 
Let's open our eyes and see how this conflict can be resolved. A redistribu­tion of governmental funds poses as a plausible start to a solution. More money needs to be spent on social pro­grams, namely programs of welfare reform; less money need be ap­propriated to our military budget, spe­cifically nuclear weapons and Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) research. The focal point of Congressional and the Ad­ministration's concentration should not be on a military buildup, one that is by many standards too big already. Rather, we should work to provide everyone with suitable living condi­tions. 

The cold facts are apparent: One out of five children lives in poverty, two out of four black children and two of every five Hispanic children experi­ence the harsh effects of poverty. As Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., noted, we can "end child poverty by ending parental poverty." There is more to poverty and welfare reform than just children. Single women and minorities constitute another large percentage of those living in poverty. This is one rea­son for a greater need for aid to families with dependent children (AFDC), which has been seriously affected by cuts in the budget made by the Reagon Administration. With the facts evident, we must open our eyes to the problems and possible solutions. 
At the close of the 1987 Summer Con­ference on Peace and Justice Educa­tion, Fr. Edward Malloy, President of the University of Notre Dame, closed the conference by asking all Catholic colleges and universities to address the problems of justice and peace in soci­ety. This is exactly the type of aware­ness America's college and university students need. Mter becoming aware and receiving proper education, these students can, in turn, help the poor with different aspects of life. With this known, it is time to take action. 
Action can be taken locally to help welfare recipients, as well as those who lack certain educational skills. For in­stance, the Literary Council of St. Joseph County, Real Services, and Headstart are just a few of the many volunteer services in the South Bend area that aid many people who may either be receiving welfare or living in poverty. At the federal level, people can write letters to their Congressmen showing support for welfare reform bills currently in both the House and the Senate. 
To suggest there is a solution to com­pletely erase poverty would be incor­rect. There is a way to lessen these hardships and help people lead lives with a respectable amount of dignity. A means exists for everyone to become involved in the helping process. The problems of poverty will not simply dis­appear by avoiding the realities of the situation. So let's open our eyes and take action.

Reality absent from Doonesbury comics 
A general assumption, held in both intellectual and non-intellectual circles, has gone something like this: "Well, Garry Trudeau's comic strip "Doonesbury" can be tough, even vi­cious. But, shucks, he satirizes people and issues from all sides of the political spectrum. He plays no favorites." But in fact, although this would be con­venient for those on the liberal side of the political fence, it just ain't so. 
Kevin Smant 
guest column 
Think hack a moment. Who was it that had a news correspondent make a fictitious trip into Ronald Reagan's brain during the 1980 presidential cam­paign? Who in 1984 ridiculed George Bush as having put his manhood in a 
Doonesbury 
blind trust? Who recently had one of his characters ridicule the very idea of Jack Kemp running for president? Mr. Trudeau, of course, was the culprit each time. And a pattern clearly emerges. Trudeau regularly bashes those whom he considers conservative, yet conspicuously absent from his drawings are satires of Democrats. Don't Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale, Gary Hart, Joe Biden (especially him!) et.al. provide some satirical fodder? 
Of course, Trudeau's writings do not deal solely with politics. He manages to push his liberal agenda through other topics. Very recently he attacked USA Today, suggesting that its positive, colorful view of America encourages Americans to ignore poverty and the threat of nuclear war. (Apparently Trudeau hasn't seen the latest declining unemployment figures.) He once in­vented an elderly homeless woman, ap­parently subliminally urging more federal dollars for the homeless. (Never mind that recent studies indi­cate that estimates of the number of homeless have been vastly exagger­ated.) And he has portrayed busines­smen convicted of insider trading as cold, calculating, immoral criminals who deserve the equivalent of the gulag. (Strangely, the far greater num­ber of street criminals -muggers, pick­pockets, rapists, etc.-currently prowl­ing America's streets never face Trudeau's moral wrath.) 

The sad fact is that Garry Trudeau's world is one in which reality is decidedly absent. It is a world in which Ronald Reagan can do nothing right, and the Democrats nothing wrong; in which if only people were a little nicer to everyone else -especially in the form

of higher taxes and accompanying federal goodies -our problems would fade away; in which America's foreign enemies apparently do not exist and anyway mean no harm. 
Perhaps once upon a time Mr. Trudeau was indeed an independent commentator on American society. But throughout this decade he has been little more than a man churning out the Democratic Party's latest line. He is perfectly free to accept this role, of course. His position as liberal icon suits him well. But the last two presidential elections suggest that becoming a liberal icon also means sliding dan­gerously close to a position of ir­relevance. Say what you will, Garry. But nobody's listening.

a e 8 
Holy Cross Associates 
.More than 

MIKE NAUGHTON accent editor 
C
hile: In this small country of 12 million, poverty and political repression characterize the lifestyle of the masses. 
Chile: after a bloody military coup In 197.3, supported and orchestrated with the help of the CIA, General Agusto Plnoc­het came to power, overthrow­Ing and murdering the democratically-elected socialist president Salvador Allende. 
Chile: Under the military dic­tatorship of Pinochet for the past 14 years Chile has been the scene for an estimated .30, 000 political murders. .3, 000 people have disappeared and hundreds of thousands have been tortured or exiled. 
Chile: where poverty is so rampant that nearly .30, 000 Chileans are forced to rely on soup kitchens for their main meal. 
In this environment the Chilean Catholic Church has tirelessly worked to combat these economic and political human rights violations. The Congregation of Holy Cross has been In Chile since 194.3 when the first contingent of Holy Cross Priests arrived. During the past 44 years, the District of Chile has been vitally In­volved In the Chilean church In a variety of apostolates, espe­cially In education and pastoral ministry. 
The first Holy Cross Associate arrived In Chile in 1978. The Program has grown and ma­tured greatly since. Twenty-six Associates have completed their Involvement In the Pro­gram. At present, six men and three women are ministering in Chile and three more are In the first stages of their service. 
Three Notre Dame graduates who returned from Chile earlier this year, Joan Kellenberg, Lou Nanni, and Brigette Goulet, each display different motiva­tions, Impressions, and effects from their experience. 
Why did you choose to go to Chile? Joan: My reasons for wanting to go to Latin America, and 
specifically Chile, date back to 
my high school years. Due to my Christian upbringing and my family's belief that faith and action are Intricately linked, I was quite involved during high school In community service projects. As I entered Notre Dame, I became Increasingly aware, on an international' scale, of the disparity between 
the "haves" and..the "have­nets." After spending my soph­omore year op the Mexico foreign study Program, I returned to the states deeply shaken and moved by the knowledge that 80% of the human race live as "have-nots." Going to Chil~ was a natural step for me Itt terms of ex­panding my vision and experi­ence with the poor. 
Lou: I went to Chile as a Holy Cross Assocl~te, first and foremost btiause of a desire to grow in fc:dth and in service to others. I wanted to be more "God-centered and."other­centered" in my life, a.nd I feared the "1-centeredriess" that I saw so much of In the United States. I guess you could 5ay that I went to Chile not for some lofty altruistic reasons, but with a primary concern for my formation as a Christian and for my development as a caring human being. 
Brlgette: I went to Chile to simply learn, learn a new lan­guage, a new culture, a new way of being and a new way of looking at the world. I went to serve and was actually served. I went looking for peace and encountered people living In turmoil, In poverty with no run­ning water or electricity, some­times with barely enough to survive. I found peace in na­ture, in the mountains, and In

the faith of the Chilean peasant farmers. For the extremely harsh living conditions, their trust in God and the church was endless. 
What did you do In Chile? 
Joan: I was involved in a number of different activities. My first year was spent almost exclusively In our parish in Penalolen, a large shanty town area of 120,000 people located 

an 'eye-opener' 
on the east side of Santiago. I organized several small first aid classes In the chapels, cooked with 20 women who had formed an "olla commun" (a Chilean-style soup kitchen) to feed their families, and helped to organize several groupS concerned with basic home repair--the heavy \\'Inter ..............

I also coordinated a small group In our parish's family catechism program, working with a group of 10 single, divorced, or widowed mothers whose children were to receive their first holy communion. Finally, I sang and performed publicly with a small folklore group, learning to play Indigenous Instruments and to appreciate the wonderful latin american music.

The birth of a business: how Mateo's got started 
By SUSAN COENE Business Writer 
Does Hungarian Noodle Bake sound good for dinner tonight? If not, Mateo's Sub Shop, the newest South Bend at­traction might be a tastier al­ternative. 
Founders Matt Sowash and Tony Furjanic saw a ·need in South Bend and met it. 
How did it all get started? 
Matt Sowash, a native of State College, Pennsylvania, was a high school buddy of former Notre Dame football captain Tim Scannell. Sowash, in his frequent visits to Notre Dame, noticed the lack of a sub shop that delivered to the stu­dents. 
After his graduation from Penn State, the sandwich lover from the East came out to the midwest with a plan to open up his own sub shop. 
Last January he began the necessary research. Sowash created a portfolio of popula­tion information, traffic pat­terns in the city, the competi­tion and profit and cost projections. Everything was ready, all he need was money. 
That's where Tony Furjanic comes in. 
Sowash met Furjanic through Scannel and they soon became friends. 
Furjanic, at the time, was a middle line backer and later became defensive captain for the Irish. After graduating Furjanic signed with the Buf­falo Bills as an 8th round draft pick. 
Sowash realized Furjanic might have money available for investing. He presented his research findings and asked Furjanic to join the business venture. 
Furjanic quickly agreed. 
The establishment of Mateo's <Italian for Matt) was underway. 
The two then proceeded to the bank to get a loan backed financially by Furjanic. 
Sowash and Furjanic formed a corporation named SOJANIC. 
"A corporation as opposed to a partnership will allow us the flexibility to expand into other business fields," said Sowash. 
One possibility under consid­eration is real estate. 
Mateo's opened on July 16th in time for the Special Olym­pics. 
Those who've tried Mateo's can attest that they offer deli­cious subs. From classic hoagies to pizza subs to diet turkey breast subs (with light mayo! ) , Mateos offers a varied menu. 
The subs are packed with meat, unlike other sub shops who weigh their portions Sowash claims, "People want beef, not a lot of bread." For now management's main ob­jective is to offer value to the customer. They are not worried about the profit per sandwich. This is obvious con­sidering the generous size of the sandwiches and their reasonable prices ($2.50 to $5.00 depending on the length­7,14 or 18 inches). 
Mateos at this point is more concerned with volume and es­tablishing their product. 
Mateos' mainstay is their delivery services. Although it is not quite up to par yet, Fur-

Budget talks making 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -White House and congressional negotiators ended their first week of budget talks Saturday without an agreement but with indications that some of the pieces were falling into place. 
"We're making a little head­way," said Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., senior Re­publican on the Senate Budget Committee, after the hourlong session. 
Rep. William H. Gray III, D­Pa., said it was difficult for people to leave behind "ideological and political pos­tures" that they brought into the talks, but progress was being made. 
Earlier Saturday, House Speaker Jim Wright, who did not attend the talks, told reporters the Democrats were working to pare $6 billion off a mammoth spending bill due for House action this week. That would "demonstrate our good faith" toward deficit reduction, he said. 
Last week, Wright, D-Texas, forced through the House, by a single vote, a Democratic­drafted plan for $12 billion in tax increases plus some entitle­ment cost-cutting, also aimed at reducing the deficit. 
The speaker had to use some heavy-handed parliamentary tactics to squeeze out the vic­tory, and the ensuing Republi­can rancor resulted in a rare Saturday session, during which nothing was accomplished be­cause too few lawmakers were in town to form a quorum. 
White House chief of staff Howard Baker, Treasury Sec­retary James Baker and budget director James Miller attended Saturday's closed-door meeting with a bipartisan group of legislators. 
"We keep meeting. If we keep meeting, that's the way to make progress," Secretary 
janie states, "We're trying to 
improve our delivery 
procedures in order to provide 
speedier service to our custom­
ers." Delivery is their main 
hedge against their competi­
tion, namely Subway and The 
Yellow Submarine. 
Mateos' prime market is 
Notre Dame and St. Mary's stu­
dents to whom most of Mateo's 
advertising is directed. 
One of Mateos' other busi­
ness strategies is to receive the 
Observer every day and plan 
according to the dining hall's 
menu. "Business is pretty 
steady, but it does depend in 
part on that nights dinner," 
Sowash said. If it's goulash 
night, they expect a busy night 
and bring in an extra driver or 
two. 
"A couple weeks ago," relates Furjanic, "a fatty corned beef was served and we were swamped!" 
Another influence to sales is Notre Dame's performance on the football field. 
"When Notre Dame Plays well our sales increase," said Furjanic. He added, "The phones were really dead after our loss to Pitt." 
Furjanic reminisces, "I went to Notre Dame, and I know what it's like to go to the dining hall every night. I also know what it is like to scrounge to­gether ten bucks for a pizza that doesn't fill you up. Our goal is to give the best sand­wich for the best price." 
Mateos is a perfect example of entreprenuers putting ideas and money into profits. The result is inexpensive, quality food for students.

Baker said, declining further comment. 
The goal of the meetings is to come up with a deficit reduc­tion plan before Nov. 20, when the Gramm-Rudman law re­quires $23 billion in across-the­board spending cuts unless an alternative is enacted. 
The negotiators' minimum task at this point is actually slightly larger than the statutory $23 billion. Legisla­tion passed so far this year has slightly worsened the expected fiscal 1988 deficit. So, $24.8 bil­lion in deficit reduction must now be found to yield a net $23 billion for the year, which began Oct. 1. 
The automatic cuts, however, would still be limited by law to the $23 billion. 
The negotiations last week included possible freezes on spending in many domestic and military programs, except for selected high-priority items. 

Christmas gift ideas 
u Futrex Inc. has developed the latest method in measur­ing body fat. As physical fitness continues to enter into the high-tech age, the demand for an accurate body fat guage is rising. Through expanding a system used by the U.S. Agricultural Department, Futrex has developed a simple, relatively inexpensive body fat guage. 
The regular model, which sells for $300, is a infrared baton that is held in one's hand. When held up to the right bicep of a righthanded person (and vice versa), a certain amount of light penetrates the muscle producing a readout of fat content and muscle tone. The entire process takes ten seconds. Serious physical fitness buffs can purchase the deluxe model for $500 which prints out exercise and diet ideas.

Business Briefs 

u 1988 wil see China Business Machines Inc. introduce an electric typewriter that prints Chinese characters. The idea employed by CBM is one of minimizing the number of keys to 49 by using a computer program that copies the strokes of handwritten Chinese. This will allow a typist who knows Chinese to type at speeds that approach those of typing in English. CBM, led by M. Burdett Merryman in San Diego, will also soon produce a compatible word processor and ter­minal. 
u The recent drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average has commanded much attention from investors and non­investors alike. Many corporations believe that their stock is now a good buy. Several companies are buying back their own stock in order to take advantage of the low prices. Small investors may be able to follow the corporations' lead and purchase low price, high quality stocks. 
An investor should look at a company's earnings and po­tential before buying a stock on the weakness of its price. Some of the more notable companies announcing buybacks this past week include; Allegis, Bally Manufacturing, IBM, Morton Thiokol, and Pacific Telesis. 
u Advertising for Miller's Real Draft Beer has focused on how their beer is not heat pasteurized which supposedly kills the taste of beer. Some of these ads portray Budweiser bottles being heated on a stovetop or processed in a hot factory. Although not wishing to enter a beer war, the makers of Budweiser, Anheuser Busch Inc., will begin a line of com­mercials revealing that Miller Lite is heat pasteurized twice and has sugar added to compensate for the bitter taste re­sulting from this process. One fact that Anheuser Busch is not publicizing is that Miller Real Draft is brewed using a process bought from the Japanese beer company Saporo. So much for being made the American way.

NEW YORK -A confident Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya caught early pacesetter Pat Petersen shortly past the 14­mile point and coasted to vic­tory Sunday in the 18th New York City Marathon. 
Hussein, ninth in the 1985 race in his marathon debut and fifth last year, was timed at 2 hours, 11 minutes, 1 second. He became the first African to win the race. 
Priscilla Welch of Britain led all the way in easily capturing the women's title in an unoffi­cial 2:30:16. 
Welch, who will be 43 on Nov. 22, became the oldest women's winner in the New York City Marathon. The previous oldest winner was Miki Gorman, who was 42 years, 75 days when she won for the second consecutive time in 1977. 
For Hussein, 29, a former Western Athletic Conference steeplechase champion at the University of New Mexico, this was his fifth marathon and third victory. 
He won the Honolulu Marat­hon in 1985 in a course record 
2: 12: 08 and bettered it last year in defending his title in 2: 11:44. He also has won the Bay To Breakers Race in San Fran­cisco in 1984 and 1985 and was the first men's finisher in the 1986 Trevira Twosome 10-mile race in New York. 
Early in the 26-mile, 385-yard race through New York's five boroughs, Petersen tried to steal the race. The top Ameri­can finisher in the 1984 New York City Marathon when he placed fourth, and in 1985 when he was third, Petersen set a blistering early pace, opening a 35-second lead at five miles. 
Hussein reeled him in shortly past the halfway point. 
Petersen hung on to second place before being overtaken in the closing stages and placing fourthin2:12:03, behind Gianni DeMadonna of Italy (2:11:53) and Pete Pfitzinger (2: 11: 54), the 1984 U.S. Olympic Trials marathon winner. Tommy Ekblom of Finland finished fifth in 2: 12:31. 
Italy's Orlando Pizzolato, the 1984 and 1985 New York City Marathon champion, made his usual second-half charge, moving into third place at one stage before fading to sixth in 2:12:50.

Watson ends three-year skid with Nabisco Tournament win 
Associated Press 
SAN ANTONIO -Tom Wat­
. son, exhibiting the gritty deter­mination that once made him the game's greatest player, ended a three-year victory famine Sunday in the richest tournament golf has seen. 
Watson, the leader all the way, scrambled to a final­round 2-under-par 68 and a two­stroke victory over Chip Beck in the Nabisco Championships of Golf, the final official event on the PGA tour schedule this year. 
It was the 32nd victory of his PGA career -not including his five British Open titles -and his first since July 1984. 
The tournament carried a $2 million purse, plus another $1 million for the Nabisco Grand Prix of Golf, which also ended in this tournament. 
Despite finishing dead last in a 30-man tournament that of­fered the most prize money in tour history, Curtis Strange took the season's money­winning title with a record $929,941. 
But the . honor he wanted ­Player of the Year -eluded him. That went to Paul Azinger, like Strange a three-time winner this season. 
In a tournament that offered almost 10 percent of the total tour purse for 1987, the Player of the Year title turned on scoring average. Strange's 293 total for this event knocked him out of the Top 10 in scoring average and handed the title to Azinger. 
No one handed the title tn Watson, however. It was a grim, tight-lipped struggle with himself over the last few holes at the Oak Hills Country Club course. 

Armed with a four-shot lead, Watson, fighting the pressure of that long non-winning string, began to struggle on the 14th ' hole. 
He missed the green on the next four holes, bogeying the 16th. On the 14th, 15th and 17th he put his new-found confi~ dence in his putter to the test. And it was not wanting. 
At the same time, however, Beck began a run as he birdied the 16th as Watson bogeyed and moved within two shots of the lead. 
He birdied No. 17 and moved within one. 


Twins look forward to proVing season was no fluke 
Associated Press 
MINNEAPOLIS -Proving that their 1987 World Series tri­umph was not a fluke could be just the motivation the Min­nesota Twins need to repeat. 
"We'll be the underdogs again next year," said relief ace Jeff Reardon. "I'm sure we'll have to make believers out of some people, which is a good goal. It would be nice to go out and win 100 games." 
To do that, the Twins will need to improve 1987 road Twins owner Carl Pohlad, record of 29-52, the worst ever who purchased the club in 1984, for a first-place finisher. Their said that the club's gutsy char­regular-season home record of acter will keep players hungry 56-25 was the best in baseball for another championship. for 1987 and the Twins became "When you win the big one the first team ever to win all you get one of two things,'' Poh­four home games in a World lad said. "You get momentum Series. or you get complacent." 
''I really feel like we have To protect the momentum, it something to live up to," said will be important for contract third baseman Gary Gaetti, the negotiations to go smoothly MVP of the American League during the offseason, said playoffs. "This thing wasn't a pitcher Bert and first fluke." baseman

Associated Press 
Jim McMahon had to turn up the tempo Sunday to get his 24th consecutive victory as a starting quarterback for the Chicago Bears. 
McMahon, with the Bears trailing 28-14, went to a hurry­up offense in the second half and threw two touchdown passes to Willie Gault in the fourth quarter, leading Chicago to a 31-28 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. 
"I went to the hurry-up be­cause we know what we're doing and and it keeps the other team off balance," McMahon said. "I was happy because I started throwing right away. They had stopped our running so I decided to throw." 
49ers 31, Rams 10 
Joe Montana completed 21 of 30 passes for 294 yards and three touchdowns in San Fran­cisco's rout of Los Angeles. 
Montana marched the 49ers 80 yards to a score on their first possession on Tom Rathman's nine-yard touchdown run. After the Rams made it 7-3, Montana threw touchdown passes of 17 yards to Mike Wil­son and two yards to John Frank and Ray Wersching kicked a 22-yard field goal in the second period for a_ 24-3 halftime lead.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -With NFL rushing champ Eric Dickerson making his debut in an Indianapolis uniform Sun­day, the Colts weren't surprised at getting a 145-yard rushing day from his tailback spot. 
Thefactthatincumbentrun­ning. back Albert Bentley produced it hardly disturbed them or Dickerson. _ 
Acquired on Saturday from the Los Angeles Rams in ex­change for eight players, Dick­erson rushed 10 times for 38 yards and caught one pass for 28 more in a 19-14 Colt victory. 
"I was a little nervous but it went pretty good," Dickerson said. "I was surprised I got to play as much as I did. I felt like a rookie out there. I've got to learn a new system."

With five seconds left, Franklin's 34-yard field goal at­tempt failed, but the Raiders were penalized for being of­fsides. Franklin connected on his second attempt. 
Dolphins 35, Steelers 24 
Dan Marino weathered a shaky start in the rain and passed for four touchdowns and 332 yards, leading Miami over Pittsburgh. 
The NFL's all-time, top­rated quarterback completed 25 of 31 attempts, including scoring passes of 41 and 33 yards to Mark Clayton and 50 yards to Mark Duper that helped the Dolphins overcome a 21-7 halftime deficit. 
Part of Dickerson's problem is a basic question of odd and even numbers in the signal count. 
"In LA, even numbers meant you went to the left," he said. "Here, even numbers go to the right. I have to reverse them in my mind. 
"I didn't know the plays and I didn't want to mess up. I knew maybe two pass plays, maybe four running plays. I didn't want to be going the wrong way and bust a play." 
Dickerson entered the game on Indianapolis' second offen­sive series. He ran for five yards off the right side and then two yards over the left side on the next play. 
Twice in the second quarter, Dickerson produced long gainers. He turned a pass in the flat from Jack Trudeau into a 28-yard gain. 
Buccaneers 23, Packers 17 
Steve DeBerg drove Tampa Bay 84 yards for a touchdown to open the second half and threw a scoring pass to Gerald Carter a minute later as the Buccaneers held on to beat Green Bay. 
Seahawks 28, Vikings 17 
Dave Krieg passed for three touchdowns, including a key 27­yarder to Steve Largent early in the second half, and backup Jeff Kemp added a 28-yard scoring toss with 1:32 left as Seattle beat Minnesota.

"This team doesn't have the power that Purdue has," Lam­bert said. "Our blocking has improved, but it didn't mean a whole lot against this team (VI­C)."

Lambert was pleased with the defensive play of the team as well as the confidence level. 
"The team played with con­fidence, and that was the dif­ference," he said. "We finally got some defense in the back, that is important. Colleen Wag­ner played good defense for us. I was really pleased with that." 
Morin had 38 assists in her starting role for the Irish. 
"What I needed was confi­dence," Morin said. "I knew I was going to go out and do the job, so I got some confidence. 
"We have to have the team­work," she continued. "We weren't communicating for a while, but it's back and we're putting it together."

fighting than in playing hock­ey. The Irish responded by scoring twice on power play sit­uations and getting two goals to take a 5-4 lead. Windsor ap­peared to commit several other penalties during the game which were not called. 
"I'd have hated to be a ref­eree," Schafer said. "I hate playing Canadian univerisity teams or teams like this. There were a couple of high sticks in the head. For the most part, we practiced pretty good self­restraint." 
Senior center and captain Mike McNeill led the Notre Dame rally with two goals in the period. He eventually got the hat trick in the third period. 
In the third period, however, instead of holding the lead, the Irish let Windsor blow the game open. The Lancers ex­ploded for five goals in the per­iod to win convincingly, 9-6, and leave Schafer perplexed about the defensive breakdowns. 
"There were lots of errant passes and breakaways," Schafer said. "It wasn't so much a team breakdown as an individuals breaking down.''

Irish keep rolling, maul Midshipmen, 56-13 
No surprises in ND romp 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
Everybody in Notre Dame Stadium, including 11 Navy defenders, knew what to expect on the last play of the first half. 
But as was the case all afternoon Sat­urday, knowing what was coming and stopping it from happening were en­tirely different tasks for the 1-7 Mid­shipmen. 
Irish quarterback Kent Graham dropped back and threw the ball deep into the corner for Reisman Trophy candidate Tim Brown with no time left in the second quarter. And even a prevent defense couldn't stop another Notre Dame touchdown in a 56-13 Irish rout of the Middies, the 24th consecu­tive Notre Dame win over Navy. 
"Any time I can get the ball within a 10-mile radius of Tim Brown," Graham said, "I think he's going to get it." 

The 51-yard completion gave the Irish a 35-6 halftime lead, and marked the fifth time in five first-half possessions that a nearly flawless Notre Dame of­fense pushed the ball into the endzone. "I don't do anything on that play but run," said Brown, who left the game on Notre Dame's first drive to have a torn fingernail on his left hand stitched. "They (Navy) had four guys deep, but By STEVE MEGARGEE Pinkett, in a 44-7 victory over Penn side, Cal., has the only two 100-yard they were all in the middle of the field.
