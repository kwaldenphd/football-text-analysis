Roast beefthat went unrefrigerated for almost ten hours on a warm day was responsible for a salmonella poisoning epidemic that killed 26 patients in a northern England psychiatric hospital, a medical expert said Monday. Geoffrey Ireland, district medical offi­cer of the Wakefield Health Authority, said an investigation would have to be held to find out why the beef was taken out of cold storage. Since the outbreak more than two weeks ago, 26 elderly patients at the 900-bed Stanley Royd Hospital have died. At the height of the epidemic, 346 patients and at least 40 staff members underwent treatment. -AP 
Hurricane Diana, whirling 135 mph winds around its eye, slammed into North Carolina's southeastern coast yesterday night, with torrential rain and tree-bending wind that threatened to push tides up to 12 feet above normal. Thousands ofpeople fled to higher ground. At 8 p.m., winds were clocked at 100 mph at Yaupon Beach on Oak Island near Cape Fear. At nightfall the eye of the first Atlantic hurricane ofthe season was just off the coast, about 30 miles south-southeast of downtown Wilmington. The hurricane's storm surge ofhigh water was expected to coincide with a full moon high tide. "Hurricane Diana is now a dangerous hurricane," the National Weather Service said. "Further strengthening is likely." -AP. 
A 13-year-old Los Angeles girl has been charged with murder in the death ofa man who was shot and then cut into pieces and dumped in a trash bin, authorities said.

The press as a source of political decision-making 
Everyday, newspapers provide a variety of services for their readers. Information, entertainment and opinion are only a few of the things newspapers bring into our homes and offices daily. They can also pass the time during lunch. 
But this year newspapers can play an especially cru­cial role for their readers. With Walter Mondale and Ronald Reagan both running around the nation trying to get elected president, the front page allows the reader to follow the politicians on the campaign trail while the opinion page gives the reader insight into the rhetoric that gets thrown around. 
Without the daily newspaper, it would be very diffi­cult for the public to gaitl even the most basic under­standing of the Issues. Even someone so caught up in the busy world that he or she must resort to depending on television or radio to substitute for the paper is being cheated of the time and detail that is so important in devising political decisions. 
The limits of television and radio forbid the insight available in a newspaper. The nightly network news programs can only provide their viewers a few minutes on each candidate or issue. And radio news shows suffer the same drawback. Even paid political announce­ments aren't very lengthy and In recent years they have given up substance for glitter or mud-slinging. The Gary Hart/Walter Mondale A v~IIAable primary ads as well as the 
ReSource
$400,000 Reagan/Bush film shown at the Republican convention are two of the more obvious examples. 
Worse than this is the per­son who doesn't make any time at all to find out what is going on around the city, country or nation. Students can often find themselves in this situation. But it is a crime to exist in a world and not know what is happen· ing within it. 
While some papers are better than others at provid­ing an objective news section and a thoughtful opinion page, it is important for the American voter to utilize their local press, both on the front and inside pages, to guide or at least expand his or her political thought. 
Unfortunately, this is not always the case. In fact, the majority of voters defer from incorporating the inter­pretations ofothers in forming their own opinion. Many people use other input, such as voting for the man who agrees with them on one issue -or even which can­didate is more charismatic. 
It is a pity that people can decide who will mold their future on the basis ofwho kisses babies better. But it is a fact ofcontemporary political life.

OFFENSE 
It's no accident Dan McCullough 


News Editor 
Inside Wednesd 

Most every student, faculty and staffmember at Notre Dame is past the voting age ofeighteen. The intellectual level of thought here is much higher than other places in the country, so it follows that members of the Notre Dame community would not submit to such unintellec· tual political decision-making processes. But it ain't necessarily so. 
Some people who claim to be the most ardent liberals are actually the most narrow-minded. And many con· servatives wouldn't listen to a wordJesse Jackson or Tip 
O'Neill said if you paid them. 
It is so important to listen to and consider what everybody has to say · from the far left to the reactionary right. No matter what a per­son thinks he or she believes, it could only bene­fit him or her to listen to al­ternative positions. The best liberals are open to any and all opinion. And the most worthy conservatives don't flaunt their hawkishness. Rather, they hear everybody and digest everything in the formation of their own choice. 
The main thing is not to be a Republican or Demo­crat, but to be a listener and 
a chooser. And the place to get such input -the place where you will find both extremes, as well as the middle ground, presented in an intelligent context -is in the stories and opinions ofthe newspaper. 
The newspaper is one of the few forums where such an exchange of thought can take place in popular cul­ture. But before a voter walks into the booth and shuts that curtain, he will have taken the best advantage ofhis right if he takes a careful look at what he is doing. And the newspaper offers him that scrutiny. 
lbe views expressed in the Inside column are the views of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the editorial board or staff.

Club planning alcohol alternatives 
By CAROL CAMP 
Sent or StaffReporter 
Ever since the new alcohol policy was enacted, you haven't had any fun, right? There's no social life on campus, you say? Ifthe officers ofthe newly created Social Alternatives Club have their way, students will 

, soon have nothing but the North Dining Hall walls to complain about. Last April, Lee Broussard, Vince 
Pryor,  Kevin  Miller,  Phil  Buckin­ 
gham,  Mike  Muscara,  and  Cheryl  
Miller  decided  to  form  a  group  

which would plan innovative non­alcoholic campus events. Miller ad­mits the idea originally began as "a joke, but then we saw the potential for it and began coming up with Ideas." 

The group's objective, according to Buckingham, Is "to work around the alcohol policy. We feel that people are creative enough to come up with new Ideas, and we want to be able to try out the dltferent Ideas that people have." · 
Since this semester, the group has been planning a variety of campus events. So far, two dances are sched­uled for Haggar Center (SMC), Sept. 29 and Dec. I. Also, the classic cult flick, Rocky Horror Picture Show, will be shown at Stepan Center on Nov. 16 and 17. 
Other tentative plans Include: a campus-wide talent show, a Chicago Cubs trip, a T-shlrt sale at the Miami game, an lnterhall "Wacky Olym­pics" competition, and a dance In which dorms would be divided into three groups ofeight, each featuring 
a dltferent type of music. 
In order to plan successful campus events, the officers ofthe So­cial Alternatives Club need student input. The club's first general meeting will be Tuesday, Sept. 18 at 7 p.m. In the Uttle Theatre in LaFortune. All Interested students are encouraged to attend. 


Jury investigates labor secretary 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK · A state grand jury is completing an Investigation of alle­gations that U.S. labor Secretary Raymond Donovan's former con­struction company falsifled records In a federally funded subway proj­ect, it was disclosed Monday. 
A lawyer for Schiavone Construc­tion Co. said Donovan has been Invited to testify before the grand jury In the New York City borough of the Bronx. A prosecutor said the 
panel Is focusing on allegations of grand larceny, perjury, falsiflcation of business documents and tamper­Ing with public records. The Investigation was disclosed in a suit filed by the Secaucus, NJ.­based firm, which Is asldng for a U.S. District Court order barring Bronx District Attorney Mario Merola from seeking an Indictment of the com-


pany or Its officers. 

The suit contends the Investiga­tion was an unfair attempt to harass Schiavone and Donovan. U.S. Dls­trictjudge Leonard Sand promised a ruling on the request yesterday. 
Donovan was executive vice pres­ident of Schiavone before joining the Reagan administration. Two in­vestigations by a special prosecutor, Leon Silverman, into allegations

The store, however, does not keep records of Its customers' names. 
Donovan had ties to organized crime when he was at Schiavone found "insufficient credible evidence" of any wrongdoing. 
Donovan's attorney, William Bit· tman confirmed he met with prosecutors. "The only thing I can say Is that I have not been advised that Secretary Donovan is a target of the grand jury Investigation," he said. 
One of the photos delivered Mon­day was apparently taken after the Purdue-Notre Dame football game Saturday In Indianapolis. The photo depicts the bust with an ax, and a sticker attached in the shape of a voice balloon which reads, "Where's Gerry?!" 
A person speaking by phone from the South Bend home ofSobol's mot· her said last night that Sobol was In town Saturday and Sunday. 
Last May, Stanage told The Observer in an unpublished com­ment that he had heard the bust would "reappear" after the Purdue game. 
Interviewed last night In a physics lab on the fourth floor of Nieuwland Science Hall, Wilkins said Sobol "may have" stolen the bust. When asked why he had a stack of yester­day's Observers on the desk, Wilkins said he Is keeping them for a "scrapbook" for the physics depart­ment.

Mondale and Reagan trade tax attacks on campaign trail 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON President Reagan denounced Walter Mondale's deficit-reduction pro­gram yesterday as little more than a "tax increase plan," but Mondale renewed his challenge to the presi­dent to come up with a blueprint of his own to reduce the red ink. 
Budget deficits have soared to record levels in Reagan's term in of­fice, and the red ink is estimated to reach S1 72 billion for the current fiscal year. The president said the deficits would be $40 billion to S50 billion lower if Congress has ap­proved all the spending cuts he re­quested.

Program to increase rectors' dorm interaction 
By CAROL CAMP 
SentorStaffReporter 
District 2 Student Senator Pat 

Browne announced the creation of 
an "Improved Student-Rector Rela­
tions Program" at last night's Hall 
Presidents Council meeting. 
The program's purpose, accor­

ding to Browne, is to provide hall 
rectors and presidents with the op­
portunity to reevaluate the rector's 
involvement in their dorm's social 
life. 
Because of the new alcohol 
policy, Browne feels hall presidents 
should make an increased effort "to 
integrate their rectors further into 
hall social life." 
Rectors will be asked to fill out a 
questionnaire evaluating their in­
volvement in their dorm's social life. 
Next hall council members will dis­
cuss their rector's role and, working 
in cooperation with the rector, at­
tempt any necessary improvement 
in student-rector interaction. 
Browne said this discussion will 
be "a good opportunity to challenge 
the rector's opinions on how to im­
prove hall social life." 
In other business, Student Activi­
ties Director Joni Neal clarified the 
Office of Student Activities' conces­
sion stand policy. Neal explained 
that due to restrictions established 
by the Athletic Department, only 15 
concession stands can be awarded 
to dorms, clubs, and organizations 
on home football weekends. No 
more than three ofthese concession 
stands are permitted to sell non-food 
items. 
Neal assured HPC members that 

the lottery for the 1985-86 season, 
which is tentatively scheduled for 
the second week of April, will be 
well-publicized in order to avoid 
confusion. 
Also, World Hunger Coalition rep­

resentative Carol Fredrick asked hall 
presidents to encourage people to 
sign up for Wednesday lunch fast. 
Fredrick explained that the dining 
halls will give the WHC one dollar 
for every student who gives up his 
Wednesday lunch. The money col­
lected helps finance eight missions 
in India, Africa, and Bangladesh. 
Andrei Gromyko later this month, but Mondale countered that it was "pretty pathetic" for the president to wait until his re-election cam­paign for his first session with a senior Soviet official. 
While Reagan and his Democratic challenger clashed over the budget and U.S.-Soviet relations, their run­rting mates talked of abortion. 
"I will be judged by my maker," said Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, a Cath­olic who personally. opposes abor­tions but favors giving women the right to· choose, and has drawn criticism from her archbishop over the issue. 
Vice Preside~tt George Bush, cam­paigning in Charleston, S.C., said he personally favors permitting rape victims to undergo abortions, despite Reagan's support for a con­stitutional amendment to ban all such operations. 
All four candidates campaigned · even though the president never left the White House -as their aides ar­

Do you know someone who is dying lobe thin? 
Nearly one-third of the worlds population goes hungry because of poverty. And nearly 200/o of the young female population in the United States also starves-hut by choice. Because they're dying to be thin. 
Anorexia Nervosa. Bulimia. Two serious eating disorders. Illnesses that can affect people of all ages... and are most common among young women.

Soviet official replaced following heart attack 
Associated Press 
FRANKFURT, West Germany -A research institute said yesterday that Marshal Nikolai V. Ogarkov suffered a heart attack before being replaced as the Soviet Union's No. 2 defense official. 
There has been no official Soviet explanation why the 66-year-old So­viet chiefofthe general staffand first depury defense minister was relieved of his duties. He had been considered a possible successor to 75-year-old Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri F. Ustinov. 
The Frankfurt Institute for Soviet Studies said in a one-paragraph news release that Ogarkov "suffered a heart attack and was taken to the Burdenko Military Hospital in Mos­cow on the 3-4 September." 
The institute statement and spokesmen for the institute said they did not draw any connection be­tween Ogarkov's reported illness and his replacement by Marshal Ser­gei N. Akhromeyev. 
The official Soviet news agency Tass announced Sept. 6 that Ogarkov was relieved ofhis duties in connection with a new appoint­ment. Tass did not specify Ogarkov's new duties nor say why he was replaced by Akhromeyev. 
Spokesmen for the Soviet Fort'ign 
1 Ministry in Moscow could not be 
1 reached by telephone yesterday for 
1 
comment on the institute report. 
1 
In cases when Soviet officials arc 
,1 
replaced because they arc ailing, an official announcement generally gives that as the reason for the change in leadership. 
1 
On Monday, in an interview with ~ NBC, the 61-year-old Akhromeyev said Ogarkov would continue to "carry out responsible tasks in the military defense of the Soviet Union." He did not elaborate on Ogarkov's duties. 
One institute spokesman, who spoke on condition he not be identi­fied, said information about Ogarkov's reported heart attack was given to the institute's director, Nicolae Nor-Mesek, by a reliable source with access to such informa­tion. 
Nor-Mesek was not available for comment. His staff initially said he was at lunch. Later, the Institute tele­phone operator said he had left for the day. 
The independent Frankfurt in­stitute coUects, translates and dis­seminates information about the Soviet Union under private contract from the West German government and others.

Pope calls Canadians away from modern 'spiritual desert' 
Associated Press 
MONTREAL · Pope John Paul II, paCish priest for a day to this bustling northern metropolis, beckoned Canadians yesterday to leave the "spirirual desert" of the modern world and rediscover God. 
"Nothing can fill the emptiness of his absence!" the pontiff, wagging a finger, preached to more than 300,000 people in centralJarry Park. 
It was the biggest crowd ever as­sembled in this French-Canadian city. 
The pope, whose visit has stirred protests among feminists here, also took note of the expanding role of women in the liberal Canadian church. 
But he said nothing to alter his staunch defense of traditional church positions against women priests, divorce, artificial contracep­tion or abortion. 
One Montreal group scheduled a march late yesterday to demonstrate opposition to the pope's conserva­tive stands on such issues. 
Materialism and women were central themes on the third day of John Paul's 12-day Canadian tour. His evening schedule included a rally with Roman Catholic youth at Montreal's Olympi~ Stadium. 
Tens of thousands of Montreal's three million people jammed the sidewalks on a gray and drizzly day to cheer the pontiff pass in his bubble-domed popemobile. Catho­lic schoolchildren, given the day off, waved papal flags. 

Enthusiasm for the papal visit masked serious problems within Quebec province's once-powerful church. Today two-thirds of Quebec's Catholics do not practice their religion, evidence of the 
growing secularism of recent decades. 
On his first stop of the day, the pope told the Quebec clergy he was aware oftheir problems. 
"You have been witnessing ... a more materialistic, more selfish atti· tude to life," he said at a meeting with 3,000 priests and seminarians at St. Joseph's Oratory.

A stroll through downtown South Bend 
by Cat Francis 
features columnist 
D
owntown South B~nd. What is it? How does one get there? Does it have chocolate chip cookies? 
First things first. To get to down· town South Bend, the thrill-seeking student needs to either find a friend with a ear or take tht· bus. Confus· ingly enough, the bus this student should take is not dearly marked "Downtown South Bend." Instead, it bears the words "Scottsdale Mall." Throw all rational thought procedures out the nearest window and board this bus. 
The bus ride should take I 0 to I 5 
minutes. If you remain aboard the 
bus over an hour, something is 
dcfinitdy wrong and there is a 
more than small chance that you. 
are lost. In such eases, ask the bus 
driver or a friendly-looking fellow 
passenger for assistance. 
Assuming that you have made it 
to the downtown area and disem· 
barked, you will find yourself in an 
immense parking lot, filled with 
buses and various people waiting to 
gt·t on them. Yes, this is downtown 
South Bend. Turn and look at the 
Courthouse. '!be street between 
you and it is Main Street. Turn 
around. lbc street between you .and Oseo's is Michigan Street. 
Knowing thest· two streets, you're 
rt·ady to roll. 
When facing Osco's, north is to 
your left and south is to your right. 
Go one block south on Michigan. 
You arc now in Center City Plaza, 
one ofSouth Bend's major attempts 

at urban renewal. On your right IS 
Robertson's. Beyond Robertson's is 
a jeweler's, a candy store, and the 
Dainty Maid Bake Shop. The Dainty 
Maid Bake Shop has enough pastries 
and sweet gooey things to set a 
dentist up for life. Sometimes they 
will have displays ofcake decorat· 
ing in the window, where you will 
see cverthing from "Happy 
Birthday" to a Boy George motif. 
Across the way is a shop that sells 
futons. Futons are japanese mat· 
tresses which look a little like 
bedrolls but are amazingly com­
fortable. I bought a futon last year 
and have slept on it ever since. 'Ibe 
only problem with them is that any 
pets in the household will also like 
the futon, which they perceive as a 
giant pillow laid on the floor en· 
tirely for their delight. 
Ablock further south Is the Cor· nucopia, a vegetarian restaurant ·which has just recently added the heresy ofchicken and fish onto its 
menu. They carry Haagen Dazs ice cream and "natural" soda pops bearing names like Corr's Ginseng 
Rush or Mandarin Lime Soda. 
Another block south is Inwood's. Inwood's is a giant gold mit;~e of tacky things. Enter at your own risk. 
Return north. and one block past Osco's is Fannie May Candy and the French Market, which specializes in croissants. Another block takes you to the Morris Civic Auditorium, and the fountain and statue. South Bend opinion is divided on the worth of this statue, which depicts either a woman or a musical instrument, depending on how you look at it. 
Turn left on LaSalle and you'll wander past the Griffon Bookstore, which carries science fiction and fantasy, as well as an extensive line of wargames. Above the store is a set ofrooms which are used for playing wargames on Thursday and Friday evenings and Saturday after· noons. In the basement are walls lined with used books in a number ofcategories. One block further east is Stoner's Costume Store. The display win· dows are rowed with masks ranging from E.T. to Ronald Reagan. Besides the masks, costumes and stage make-up, Stoner's carries enough practical jokes to drive your roommate up the wall for the rest of the semester. 


In the course of your excursion, you will have noticed an immense glass building, across from the French Market. This is the Marriot Hotel. Southeast ofit is the South Bend Century Center. 
The Century Center is worth paying a visit. It holds the Studebaker Museum, which details a large portion ofSouth Bend his· tory and an Art Gallery. 'Ibe view of the St. joseph River is wonderful, and from the pier, you can see the way to get across the river and to the East Race, which is equally worthy ofa visit. 
A glimpse down Main Street, one ofthe "main drags" in downtown South Bend. 
Yep, God's still an Irish fan 
-------------------Irish have a good shot at havin' a better than
by Marc Ramirez 
average season this year, a sorta condensed version ofall those articles that appear on the features COlumnist sports pages around this time. And as 
1-------------------anybody will tell you, I am one of the world's 
S
o there we were, just sittin' around in 
front ofGate Three at the ACC, waitin' for 
football tickets about seven in the ol' a.m. 
And along come all the coaches in their cars, 
and finally along comes Gerry. 
Well, ofcourse he moseys on into the 
building sa yin' good morning to everyone 
because he is a great guy, and ofcourse 
everyone greets him bal·k even though we all 
wish we wert· back asleep in bed. 
"Waitin' for football tickets, huh?" he says, and we all nod a-; he disappt·ars inside the door. 
Well, tht·n this one guy decides to a<;k out loud, "Is it worth it?" And everyone kinda laughs thinkin' ol' Gerry hadn't heard until he sticks his head out the door and says, "It's worth it this year." 
Naturally everyone is pretty freaked out and I myself am sittin' there lookin' like I've just partaken in some very wild drugs or somethin', and I think, maybe this season won't be so long after all. 
Uut I know what you're sayin': you're sayin', hey, Marc, weren't you there? Didn't you see what happened in the Hoosier Buddy Dome last Saturday? 
Yeah, I saw it. I was there in some aisle miles from where I shoulda been, in front ofa rude Purdue fan who wa'i most likely a pupil of my good buddy Sir Obnoxious, and I saw what happened, and I know the final score and all that. 
But It don't matter. Because after a few hours ofpainstakln' thought, I'm going to tell you why I think the 
~----------------------------------------------------------------------------·-----­
premier authorities on sports. 
No, seriously. I am. 
Someone even told me I should stick to writin' sports. I was flattered, considerin' I 
hadn't written a sports article since the I I th grade or so. 
Anyway, I know that sayin' the Irish have a good chance ofwalkin' away with the top ranking isn't much different from anything you've been hcarin' for the last four years. Notre Dame's had enough talent in that time to be the L.A. Raiders' farm team, and why we haven't gone out there and beat the stuffings out ofeveryone we've played used to be a mystery to me. 
But you see, my keen sports insight has given me the inside lowdown on the situa· tion. Remember all that stuff you used to hear about God makin' Notre Dame number one, and how you started to figure it was all just a bunch of hogwash? Well, it ain't. Nope, no way, no how. God has been on vacation in Sedona, Arizona, that's all. But He's back now, and He promises tohelp Notre Dame win it this year, and to do that He has provided us with some very powerful secret weapons. 
lbere's this guy named Allen Pinkett that God sent down from Heaven who sniffs out the end zone like it was rubber glue and who on an average day can run arounp and under and past just about anythin' the opposin' team puts in his path. lben there's this dude named Chris Smith who has virtually no trouble blowin' over or through anythin' that gets in his way, and actually, lookin' at the display of muscles on this guy, I don't think I'd be out there givin' him much trouble either. 
Luckily, should these guys get a little tired and start forgettin' how to woosh or blow past people they can count on the front line to open up nice big gapin' holes to run through. Granted, every team the Irish play is gonna have some pretty big dudes up front on the defense, but these gentlemen are downrighthuge. Some of them are so strong they have muscles on their earlobes. Take Larry Williams, for example. The last figures I heard on this guy were somcthin' like 6-6 and 270, but I think that was referrin' to city blocks and tons. No, really. I had a class with him once and he barely fit behind his desk. 

However, should this massive front line start forgettin' how to bulldoze over people then it would be a very sad situation indeed, as you saw last Saturday. 
But then you got receivers like Alvin Miller and Milt jackson and joe Howard who remind me ofSnap, Crackle and Pop because they're always runnin' around somewhere and one of'em always seems to be open, but sometimes I think that once they get past maybe thirty yards from the line of scrimmage, they turn invisible and no one can see them anymore. 
On defense there is a linebackin' crew who I have decided I will hire someday to remove cars that take my parkin' space. I happen to reside a few doors down from Mike Gann, and ifhe wants to use the shower on the left, then who am I to stop him, that's the way I look at it. 
Ofcourse we've got our weaknesses, and perhaps a halfway inexperienced secondary that quarterbacks are naturally goin' to try to beat up on is the biggest, or maybe it's the fact that if one jolly good afternoon Steve Beuerlein suddenly goes down clutchin' any part ofhis anatomy like it needs to be replaced then we could be in for some serious trouble. 
Or maybe it's our special teams, or maybe it's the fact that those special teams arc coached by grad students, or maybe it's that 
ifAllen Pinkett decides to have an off day 
then maybe we don't stand a very good 
chance ofwinnin'. 
But with all that talent from all those high schools with all that intelligence, and all those coaches with all that experience, and all the hype and all the optimism, well, then, what happened? , 
Well, the way I look at it, two things. One, too many silly mistakes. Maybe some of them defensive dudes we play have been learnin' tactics similar to havin' football-seekin' missiles implanted in their hands, but we seem to cough up the ball an awful lot. And the penalties? Well, take away the openin' kickoff fumble and the twelfth man on the field that led to a Purdue teedee, and what do you got? 21-13, Irish. Or something like that. 
Second, we don't seem to have the ol' quality known as killer instinct. Personally, I never enjoyed playin' catch-up anythin' and I would be as sure as I could that ifI had a lead, I kept it to no one but myself until the next full moon. Let's blow some teams away and not worry about what they think. 52·6 sounded nice to me. 
Well, God was at the Purdue game and his head wao; hangin' just like anyone else's when our final hope wa<; snuffed out by a decent interception, and he says to me, Marc, I can't help mistakes because I help those who help themselves, and as for that ol' killer instinct, well, that's something y'all have to work out for yourselves because as you know, the sixth commandment says thou shalt not have killer instinct, hut ifit's Notre Dame, then it's okay with Me .. 
So good luck, and I wish you all the best, but I've got to return to Heaven to take care of more important things so you just start doin' some winnin' and I'll take care ofthe Hail Mary passes and stuff like that. You're still my team. Go Irish.

the ball into the penalty area for classmate Dave Miles, who collided with Neal when the keeper came out for the ball. Both players fell, and the 
midfielder Tom Daley arched the ball over Neal from about 30 yards out. Sophomore Bill Gross collected the assist on Daley's goal. 
The Irish began to collapse toward the middle of the field again, ball bounced into the goal before the defense could react. 
Despite the fact that the Irish played sloppily for much of the game, the Pilots were so out· matched that they never w~re in the contest. Notre Dame showered the Bethel goal with 38 shots, while the losers never even tested Irish keeper Dan Coughlin, who was credited with Notre Dame's first shutout of the season. 
Grace said he realizes that the changes in the lineup caused some of the problems for the Irish, but he still was not pleased with the way his team performed. 
The Irish, now 4-0 on the year, will travel to East Lansing, Mich., on Friday afternoon to take on the Mic­higan State Spartans. 

Florida cited in NCAA recruiting investigation 
Associated Press 

GAINESVILLE, Fla. · The Univer­sity of Florida received a 75-page of­ficial letter of inquiry from the NCAA tuesday detailing 107 alleged infractions committed by the school's football program. 
University President Marshall M. Criser said the university will prepare an official response to the aJ. 
legations  "as quickly  as  humanly  
possible."  
Criser  said  he  was  releasing  

copies ofthe NCAA's letter as well as transcripts of interviews with wit· nesses in the probe that started in December 1982. 
Among the charges leveled against Coach Charley Pell's pro­gram was that of illegal scouting of opponents' practices. The school president said he had directed offi­cials to forward letters ofapology to seven schools and added that he had 
volunteered to forfeit Florida vic· 
tories over six of them. 
Pell, saying that he assumed re· sponsibility for "mistakes and errors," made in the program, resigned Aug. 26, but requested to remain with the squad until the end of the 1984 season. 
Criser, who had left the door open to dismiss Pell at any time, would not comment on the coach's status yesterday. 
The university released approxi· mately 1,700 pages ofdocuments In· eluding transcripts of two taped interviews with Mike Brown, a former Florida graduate assistant who confessed to spying on oppo· nents in 1980 and 1981, and Sonny McGraw, one-time Gator recruiting coordinator. 
Both reportedly cooperated with the NCAA, which will not announce sanctions against the Florida pro· gram until after it receives a response from the Southeastern Conference school. 
"Let me strongly express our ' desire that the public understand that in many instances a witness only presents one version of an alleged happening and that the NCAA letter of inquiry arc 'charges,' however serious they may be," Criser said. 
"The university's position will be set out in its response to those charges, and I hope the public will await that response before reaching conclusions concerning the univer­sity, its athletic programs, or its staff." 
Criser said the letters of apology were sent to the University of Cali· fornia at Berkeley, Mississippi, Mis­sissippi State, Louisville, Florida State, Georgia and Auburn. 
He said he offered to forfeit 1980 victories over California, Missis­sippi, Mississippi State, Louisville and Auburn, as well as a 1981 tri· umph over Florida State. 
"Obviously this is a regrettable step, but I am convinced it is the only one permitted by the standards offair play," Criser said. 
"It is small consolation for our sister universities, but an honorable institution could do no less." he said. 
The school president said the existence of illegal scouting had been previously denied by the Florida coaching staff to NCAA In­vestigators and university attorneys. 
He said Brown's Interview was the first information received substan· tiating the spying charges. 
"This is a painful process for us all. It is a true test of our ability to wea­ther a storm of intense emotion and grim reality," Criser added. 
Pell took over the Florida pro· gram in 1979 and has led the Gators to four straight bowl appearances after a 0-10-1 finish his first season. 
The coach's letter of resignation said, "The mistakes and errors I made did not make the difference in the football program. Those mistakes and errors disgust and em· barrass me."

Being called upon at a crucial stage of the game, Figaro was faced with a Purdue team on the move and eyes focused on him as If he were wearing a scarlet letter "I" for inex· perlenced. 
"There was no doubt that we are Inexperienced at the outside linebacking position," comments defensive coordinator Andy Chris· toff. "But you can never expect In­juries to occur, and when they do, it throws you. Because ofthe inexperi­ence we had In there, we had to simplify our defense. And It wasn't so much as Purdue doing the unex­pected or us playing badly, but it was our lack ofexperience on the field." 
Banks echoes the same observa­tion about the play ofthe Irish. 
"You know, we really did rise to the occasion when we needed to," Banks says. "Purdue simply capl· talized on those times when we made our mistakes. But we never got down on ourselves. We played till the very end. We are all humans, and we make mistakes." 
Head Coach Gerry Faust agrees 
that there were too many mistakes, 
SObering AcMce·; 
cansavea 
Think Before You Drink Before You Drive ...~/ 
but thinks the problems can be solved, given some time. 
"We've got ten games ahead ofus, " explains Faust. "We've got to regroup, cut down on mistakes, and go from there." 
And mistakes there were on Satur­day. A lack of intensity and concen· tration seemed to permeate the Hoosier Dome throughout the bat· tie. The mistake seemed to be the biggest play ofthe game for the hish. 
For the outside linebackers In par· ticular,the Improvement will need to come in the form of better coverage of the running backs and opponents running short pass routes over the middle · both obvious weaknesses which must be cor· rected. 
But in all fairness, Banks is correct. These are just humans playing the game, and perfection should not be expected. That was all last week, and now that Figaro and Banks will have the opportunity to prepare fully for Michigan State, they should be ready. 
Expect to see a more motivated team on the field .in East Lansing, for the Irish do not wish to maintain their tarnished Image.

Notre Dame defeats Bethel despite sloppy play, remains unbeaten 
By PHIL WOLF 
AssistantSports Editor 

The Notre Dame soccer team travelled across town yesterday af­ternoon to take on the Bethel Col­lege Pilots on their home field. 
The entire game belonged to the Irish, who came away with a 4-0 vic­tory over ·their out-classed oppo­nents. 
Notre Dame head coach Dennis Grace used the game as an opportu­nity to give some playersgame expe­rience who had not yet played this season. He started several players at positions other than the ones they normally play, and he started many

ofhis second-string players. 
The patchwork Irish squad began to dominate play immediately in the game, but it could not finish its of­fensive attacks with goals for most of the opening period. It was not until nearly 20 minutes had elapsed in the game that Notre Dame put some points on the scoreboard. 
Sophomore Tom Bowsher scored off a Mike Carney corner kick at 
25:38 to put the Irish in the lead, 1-0. That score still remained at halftime, and Notre Dame could not score again until almost halfof the second period had gone by. 
The ball rarely crossed the mid­field stripe into Irish territory the entire game, but the Notre Dame team continued to have problems getting the ball in the Pilots' net. One reason for these problems was that the Notre Dame players were bunching up in the center of the field, bringing too many defenders in front of the goal. When Grace pointed this out to his players, they spread out and created several op­portunities for themselves. 
Senior captain Rich Herdegen got the ball from junior Bill Beasley on a breakaway and shot it past Bethel goalkeeper Rick Neal at 63:12. Just over a minute later, junior

Inexperience hurts Banks, Figaro 
By TRISH SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 

Assignment errors, mental lapses and simple mistakes -three vices in the game ofcollege football. 
Because the Irish committed those same blunders in Saturday's performance against Purdue, the Notre Dame football team could not be described as being too virtuous. 
The Irish performance against the Boilers has opened up the door to all kinds of negative comments. It was no holds barred as alumni, students, and press alike let their feelings be known. Unfortunately, a portion of this criticism has been fired at the 

TV controversy continues as judge issues injunction 
By MIKE SULLIVAN 
Sports Editor 

The college football television battle heated up even more when Federal Judge Richard Gadbois issued a preliminary injunction al­lowing the Sept. 22 Nebraska-UCLA and Nov. 24 Notre Dame­Southern Cal football games to be televised by network television. 
UCLA and Southern Cal, as well as the Big Ten and Pacific-! 0 conferences. had sued Notre Dame, Nebraska, ABC, ESPN and the College Football Association because of an agreement between the CFA (of which Notre Dame and Nebraska are members) and ABC that requires CFA schools to be televised nationally only on ABC and ESPN. These two games were specifically mentioned because they were "crossover" games between members of the CFA and its rival coalition·of the Big Ten and Pac-1 0. 
The plaintiffs had argued that UCLA and Southern Cal should be able to decide whether the game was televised or not because they were the home teams. They claimed that the CFA-ABC contract, which did not allow Notre Dame or Nebraska to be televised on the other major network -CBS -hurt their schools financially because they were being denied television appearance money. 
"CBS intends to televise both games," said Peter Lund, the execu­tive vice president ofthe network to USA Today. "They were on our schedule because they were home games for the Pac-1 0 teams. Now we will fall back to determining the financial arrangement." 
ABC has not determined ifit will bid for the games. 
play ofthe two outside linebackers ­Robert Banks and Cedric Figaro. 
Forced into a pressure situation two weeks prior to the Purdue encounter, Banks was called upon to fill the void left by the injured Mike Larkin. 
A sophomore letterwinner, Banks spent the majority of 1983 on speciality teams and didn't see major action until last season's finale against Air Force, when he filled for the injured Mike .Kovaleski. Banks was listed as a second-string player heading into the fall, until Mike Larkin went down with torn liga­ments. 
Banks was expected to just flow into the starting assignment, even though he had only just over a week to prepare. With such pressure on him, Banks still managed to wrestle down nine Boilermakers on Satur­day. But he is the first to admit that 
there were  mistakes made on  the  
field.  
"Nothing  happened  which  we  

weren't prepared for," offers Banks. "But we made mistakes, there were mental lapses on everyone's part." 
Also thrown into a baptism of fire was freshmen Cedric Figaro. With no college game experience behind him, Figaro was called up from the ranks after senior tri-captain Mike Golic left the game with a shoulder injury. Figaro was also behind junior Rick DiBernardo, who injured his wrist in the preseason, and was also unavailable.

Losing to Purdue: It's wrong 
Chuck Freeby 
Sports Writer 
Irish Items 
Hello again, everybody! It's wrong. It's wrong when a team as talented as Notre Dame is unable to win against teams such as Purdue. Allen Pinkett said it best after the game when he said the Irish beat themselves. Yes, Purdue looked good, but most ofthat is because the Irish were so bad. Steve Beuerlein said afterward he still feels Notre Dame is a better football team than Purdue, and he's probably right. However, Notre Dame wasn't the better team on Saturday and it's wrong. Something is definitely wrong. 
It's wrong when your secondary is abused the wayJim Everett and his receivers did it on Saturday. Everett had a field day and he cer­tainly can not be considered one of the game's premier signal­callers, especially when you consider he almost didn't start on Saturday. Some people point to inexperience in the deep secondary, but each of the starters has at least one varsity letter at his position. So, there's really no excuse. 
It's wrong when the same type ofcritical mistakes plague the Irish week after week. A penalty for too many men on the field resulted in a Purdue touchdown rather than a field goal. An ineligible receiver penalty stalled one Irish drive, while a fumble on the Purdue three­yard line halted another chance. The frustrating part is this is the same thing that has troubled Notre Dame for the last few years. Good teams do not make those mistakes, and the Irish were not a good team on Saturday. 
It's wrong when a critical moment results in confusion. On Steve Beuerlein's last interception, the sophomore quarterback was forced to call his own play in the huddle. Apparently Faust and offen­sive coordinator Ron Hudson did not give Beuerlein a play to call when he went onto the field following the Purdue punt, so it was up to Beuerlein to make a decision. To borrow a line from Strother Martin in the movie "Cool Hand Luke": "What we have here is a failure to communicate." It was funny in the movie. It's not funny now. 
It's wrong, however, to simply blame Beuerlein for the loss, or any other individual for that matter. Sure, certain plays stand out in the football game, and the last interception is one that everyone remem­bers. However, let's also remember that Beuerlein completed 13 out of 20 passes for over 200 yards. It would be unfair to make him wear the goat's horns for this game. 
It's wrong because the most important factor to be considered, and one admitted by Faust himself, may be a lack of preparation by the Irish for what Purdue did on the field. The Irish weren't prepared for some of the motion in the Purdue offense, or the stunting on the Purdue defense. True, it's the first game ofthe season, which makes it tough to scout the opposition, but the Irish also had nine months to get ready for Purdue. All good scouts remember the motto, "Be prepared." The Irish weren't prepared, and they paid for it. 
It's wrong to give up hope, but after talking to some people, Satur­day's game ran their patience to the limit. True, there's I 0 games left, which is plenty of time to turn things around, but time is a precious commodity right now to this class ofseniors. They have heard three years ofpromises, but they are still waiting for those promises to be delivered. They want some wins, and they want them now. 
It's wrong when the second game of the season becomes a must game for the Irish, but t~at's the predicament the Irish find them­selves in after the loss to Purdue. Yes, Notre Dame can probably lose as many as three games and still go to a major bowl, but now they only have two losses left. Look at the teams coming up on the schedule: Michigan State, Missouri, Miami, Air Force, LSU, and Penn State. Those are six very tough teams, and the Irish have to beat four of them to go to a major bowl. 
It's wrong ifyou expect the Spartans won't be fired up this week. Last year, after the Michigan State game, a lot ofpeople dismissed the Spartan upset as a fluke. The Spartans return 42 lettermen from that team who would like nothing better than to kick the Irish while they're down. They have plenty oftalent, too, including quarterback Dave Yarema and fullback Carl Butler .. Yarema threw for three touchdowns in last year's win, while Butler ran 18 times for 98 yard" and another score. 
It's wrong when people have to consider Notre Dame an under­dog, but many people put the Irish in that position this week. After last week's game, you can't really blame them. Add to the poor Irish performance the doubtful status of Larry Williams (sprained ankle) and Mike Golic (shoulder injury), and it's no wonder Irish eyes aren't smiling. 
It's wrong...and the sad part is...it's true. 
Pick ofthe Week ...It would also be wrong not to mention that coach Joe Piane and his Notre Dame cross country team will begin the 1984 campaign this Friday when the Irish take on Ohio State and Northwestern on the Burke Memorial Golf Course at 4 p.m. 
This marks the 1Oth season as head coach of the Irish for the diminutive Italian cross country mentor, and he is looking to co­captainsJim Tyler and Bill Courtney to set the pace. It should be an outstanding opener to the season for the Irish harriers, and you'll want to be there.
