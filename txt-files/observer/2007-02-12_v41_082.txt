1 Qlassics' stirs quiet controversy 
Former Queer Film Festival undergoes second name change in two years to avoid conflict 
By MARCELA BERRIOS 
Assistant News Editor 
While Saturday's "Qlassics: Reimagining Sexuality and the Self in Recent American Cinema" marked the fourth year and second name change for the former Queer Film Festival, this year's event came and went rela­tively quietly -and that, said organizers and FTT professors, is what the University wanted. 
Film, Television and Theatre professor Jill Godmilow said this year several faculty mem­bers in the College of Arl'i and Letters ques­tioned the use of the words "gay" and "lesbian" in last year's title, "Gay and Lesbian Film: Filmmakers, Narratives and Spectatorshlp." 
"There's an attempt to disguise [the former Queer Film Festival] as another academic event and not one specifically gay and lesbian because the University is embarrassed by it," said Godmilow, who has served as a faculty advisor to students organizing the annual gay and lesbian film screenings since they began in 2003. "The ultimate goal is to make it go away and if every year they keep imposing restric­tions on it, eventually they will strip off its iden­tity and it will be lost." 
College ofArts and Letters Dean Mark Roche did not return Observer phone calls Sunday. University spokesman Don Wycliff said he was unaware of any discussion surrounding "Qlassics." When asked about any connection between the event's name change and the clos­ing statement on academic freedom University President Father John Jenkins issued last April, Wycliff again said he hadn't heard of "Qlassics." 
Last year's "Gay and Lesbian Film: Filmmakers, Narratives and Spectatorshlp" marked the first name change to the Queer Film Festival. In winter of 2005, talks between the FTT department and a University commit­tee on academic freedom created by Jenkins focused on the words "queer" and "festival" and sought to portray the event in a more aca­demic context. 
When "Qlassics" coordinator senior Patrick Wall contacted the Office of Arts and Letters and the FTT department this January seeking sponsorship for the film screenings, he said

State wages rise, campus sees little change 
Student workers may get future salary jump 
By EVA BINDA 
News Writer 
The Indiana House of Representatives voted Jan. 31 to increase the state's minimum wage incrementally from $5.15 per hour to $7.50 per hour by Sept. 1, 2008 -a move that will have "little impact" on the University's staff and student employees, said a member of Notre Dame's Department of Human Resources. 
"We review our salaries every year and adjust them to be competitive with the market," said Human Resources Manager of Compensation Violet Bloom. 
Only one pay level is current­ly below $7.50 per hour, she said. 
Kathy Stopczynski, chair of the Staff Advisory Council, said she "really hasn't heard too much discussion on this [mat­ter]," especially since the wages in her own department are cur­rently above minimum wage. 
Stopczynski also said this topic has not been brought up at Staff Advisory Council meet­ings. 
Nick Krafft. leader of Notre Dame's Campus Labor Action Project (CLAP), which aims to secure a "living wage" for all campus staff members, said thls legislative move is a "good thing." However, he said he would like the administration to "take a harder look at these issues. We just hope the admin­istration will continue to work with CLAP towards making

Student robbed on Bulla Rd. 

Police continue their search for suspects 
By KATE ANTONACCI 
News Editor 

Police are searching for two white college-age males who allegedly robbed a male stu­dent early Saturday morning, officials said in an e-mail. 
The man was walking back to campus alone when he was approached by two men in a teal Chevrolet Suburban at the corner of Bulla Road and Twyckenham Drive on the east side of campus. 
"The suspect used his vehi­cle to block the student's path, threatened to harm the student and demanded money from him," the e-mail said. 
The suspects, who remained in the vehicle and displayed no weapon, took money and clothing from the student. 
Following the incident, the student proceeded to walk west on Bulla Road until he saw a Notre Dame Security/Police patrol car and reported the incident. 
NDSP, as well as city and county police, searched the surrounding area but did not locate the suspects, the e­mail said. The suspects allegedly drove west from the scene on Bulla Road and then continued south on Leahy Drive. 
The first suspect is

The Inaugural Notre Dame Eating Disorders Conference, "Eating Disorders and the Campus Culture," concluded Saturday after three days of discussion about a topic that "needs to be discussed," said organ­izer and Notre Dame graduate stu­dent Ali Wishon. Whlle Wishon said attendance was "a little disappoint­ing," the first of what she says will become an annual event was a suc­cess, crediting the "wonderful quality of speakers."

INSIDE COLUMN 
Dog days of college 

During winter break, I was cleaning out my bedroom closet when I made the discovery of a lifetime. 
Better than my saved box of notes I exchanged with my friends during mid­dle school, more noteworthy than my high school yearbook and cer­tainly more enter­taining than my elementary school journal. 
My discovery revealed the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's class regis­ter -more com­monly known as the "dog book" ­containing the sen­ior snapshots of my classmates. 
To some, this phrase might seem as foreign as a sunny day during a South Bend winter, but for those of us who experienced the "prehistoric" Facebook-free life, the "dog book" con­jures memories of fun, friendship and -more commonly -sheer embarrass­ment. 
I am not sure if this class register still exists, but I can be certain that ­thanks to Web sites like Facebook -it does not have the same impact it once did. 
The sad thing is, the virtual vice flails in comparison to the glory the dog book once held. 
The 8 x 11 blue paperback does not give participants the option to change their mug shot on an hourly basis ­what you see is what you get. 
You cannot add that Dave Matthews Band quote to symbolize your feelings of lost love, you cannot supplement your serious pic with a "**Gettin' LOCO in AcApUlCo**" album and you certain­ly cannot make others wonder about an inside joke posted on a friend's wall. 
With the dog book, everything remained a mystery. 
When the dorm room phone rang on a Friday afternoon and "John Doe" asked you to the Dillon SYR, you quickly looked him up in your trusty dog book and took what you could get ... maybe. 
Feeling bored with some friends? Rank the best-looking students of the opposite sex. 
And who can forget panning through the pages to figure out whom exactly you met at that dorm party the night before. 
Maybe being a part of the "dog book" generation has made us a little gutsier (not knowing the relationship status of a crush), maybe it made us a little less judgmental (maybe he just took a bad picture) or maybe it just made us all a little more bizarre (extending an invita­tion to a total stranger). 
In any case however we looked ­skinnier, fatter, mulleted or hairier ­during the summer or fall of 2002 will be forever immortalized in the book that is a classic example of the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's freshman tradition. 
So here's to those of us who look ugly, hot, scary, nerdy or just plain crazy in their high school senior portrait. It is time to sit back and laugh because the dog book does not forgive with "recent­ly updated profiles."

LOSANTVILLE, Ind. -A cat found half-frozen in a water trough is recovering, but may lose his tail. 
Melissa Jones said she found the cat Tuesday when she stepped onto her porch for a cigarette. His tail and hind legs were stuck in about three inches of ice. She and her husband used buckets of hot water to free hlm. 
"His little ears are droopy and purple and so are his lit­tle feet," Jones said, adding that his new nickname is "Droopy."

"It gave people the opportunity to see someone struggling with an eating disorder," Wishon said. 
"It was just sort of a stunned silence," Wishon said of the audi­ence reaction to the film. "The looks on people's faces were incredible. It was a very emotional event, especially for people who have loved ones who have suf­fered from eating disorders." 
About 200 people attended the showing of the film. 
Keynote presenter Roberto Olivardia, a Harvard Medical School scholar and eating· disor­ders expert, also received a posi­tive response, WIShon said. 
"I had several people who said that he was among the top, one of the best presenters that they have ever seen," she said. 
Student Senate gender issues co-chair Ashley Weiss, a confer­ence organizer, said Olivardia addressed many facets of male eating disorders, discussing the formation of body image ideals from action figures like G.l. Joe, which leads to disorders like mus­cular dysmorphia. 
"People were really ·interactive and responsive to Dr. Olivardia's presentation," Weiss said. 
Presenters and other experts at the event also complimented the organization and quality of the impressed] that Notre Dame is on the .forefront of this conversation," Wishon said. "Everyone that came was so impressed and said it is something that doesn't seem to be addressed elsewhere. 

"All of our speakers have been to many national conferences like this, and they all had positive things to say about the confer­ence," Weiss said. "People who do this for a living -going from con­ference to conference and study­ing eating disorders -were very [complimentary]." 
The conference drew graduate students in addition to the presen­ters' colleagues and other experts in the field, Wishon said. 
Notre Dame alumnus Ted Weltzin, medical director for eat­ing disorder services at Rogers Memorial Hospital in the Milwaukee area, was one such expert. Weltzin expressed interest in serving as an advisor for future conferences, Wishon said. 
Part .of the conference's goal, Wishon said, was to foster a better understanding of how the campus environment plays a role in the development of eating disorders -something she said was addressed by presenters. 
"The presenters were saying that campus culture is part of a larger problem," Wishon said. 
Planning has already begun for next year's conference, Weiss said.

Wages

Notre Dame a better place to work." 
A living wage is the hourly rate of income that a worker in a spe­cific area must make in a 40­hour workweek to support a family of four. To establish a liv­ing wage at Notre Dame, CLAP has suggested a minimum $12.10 per-hour wage, or $25,164 a year, for University employees. 
Unlike full-time staff members, Notre Dame's student employees may eventually see a pay increase as a result of the Indiana bill. 
Currently, determining the stu­dent minimum wage is "part of the greater budgetary process that the University goes through each year", said Joe Russo, director of Student Finance Strategies in the Office of 
Financial Aid. 
Students at Notre Dame have typically been paid well above the state minimum wage of$5.15 per hour, Russo said, and increases to the base salary are considered each year. 
The student minimum wage for the 2006-07 academic year is currently $6.75 per hour. This is considered the basic rate,

"Another increase is scheduled

Russo said while the move by the Indiana House has not imme­diately affected on-campus stu­dent employees, the University budget cycle for 2008-09 will .likely "take into account any changes to the minimum wage 
law."

Portugal faces abortion referendum 
USBON -Portugal was deci<ling in a national referendum yesterday whether to discard its strict abortion law, a battle that pits the Socialist gov­ernment against conservative parties and the Catholic Church. 
The center-left Socialist government wants to grant women the right to opt for abortion during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. 
Portugal, where more than 90 percent of people say they are Catholic, has one of the most restric­tive abortion laws in the European Union. The procedure is allowed only in cases of rape, fetal malformation or if a mother's health is in danger, and only in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. 
In 23 other EU nations, abortion is permitted within much broader limits. Women can ask for abortions up to the 24th week of pregnancy in Britain and up to the 12th week in Germany, France and Italy. 
Portugal's effort to change the law, though, has run into emphatic opposition from the influential Church, which wants to keep restrictions in place. 
At midday, turnout was low, with fewer than 12 percent of eligible voters casting ballots. The sin­gle question on the ballot asks voters ifthey want to allow abortion up to the 1Oth week. 
Afganistan beset by foreign fighters 
KANDAHAR -An estimated 700 foreign fight­ers are operating in a southern Afghan province where Taliban fighters overran a town earlier this month, the provincial governor said Sunday. 
The foreign fighters _ from Chechnya, Uzbekistan and Pakistan _ are operating in three volatile areas of Helmand province, including Musa Qala, which Taliban fighters have controlled since Feb. 1, Gov. Asadullah Wafa said. 
He said the government was conducting nego­tiations with tribal elders, urging them to pur­suade the fighters to leave. 
NATIONAL NEWS ­
Iran's involvement in Iraq discussed 
WASHINGTON -The Bush administration is haunted by the history of intelligence blunders about Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction as the United States tries to document that Iran is providing lethal help to Iraqi fighters. 
Government officials familiar with the Iran dossier's documents and slides, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the materials still were classified, said they make a compelling case about Iranian actions in Iraq. 
Among the evidence the administration planned to present are weapons that were seized over time in U.S.-led raids on caches around Iraq, said one military official. Other evi­dence includes documents captured when U.S.­led forces raided an Iranian office Jan. 11 in Irbil, a city in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq about 220 miles north of Baghdad, officials said. 


Bush proposes cuts to fuel consumption 
WASHINGTON -President Bush asked Congress to help solve "one of the great chal­lenges facing our generation" by approving proposals he says will cut U.S. gasoline con­sumption by up to 20 percent over 10 years. 
"Every member of Congress who cares about strengthening our economy, protecting our national security and confronting climate change should support the energy initiatives I have set out," the president said Saturday. "We can leave behind a cleaner and better world for our children and grandchildren."

Iraq resolution vote expected soon 
Democratic Congress to pass measure expressing 'disapproval' of Iraq war 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Even before they cast symbolic votes against the Iraq war, newly empowered congres­sional Democrats are clam­oring for a chance to limit and eventually end U.S. involvement in a conflict that has killed more than 3,000 troops. 
"Will I vote for a nonbind­ing resolution? Yes, but it's insufficient," says first-term Rep. Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania, author of one of more than a dozen com­peting proposals that would impose a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops. 
"I think eventually without a question that we will have the House move to that posi­tion," the former three-star admiral added. "The country is already there."

Korea talks stall over energy aid 
Associated Press 

BEIJING -International talks to persuade North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program verged on foundering Sunday over the coun­try's demands for energy aid, and would end after one more day of negotiations, envoys said. 
A day of meetings and an unscheduled nighttime session by the negotiators from the United States, China, North Korea and three other countries failed to achieve much progress, envoys from Japan and South Korea said. The six envoys agreed to recon­vene Monday. 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State 
Chris  Hill  said  the  talks  had  
snagged  on  the amount of energy  
assistance  Pyongyang is  to  be  

awarded as an inducement for dis­arming. But he said that a deal could still be reached Monday, which would be the final day of talks. 
"The situation remains severe," Japanese envoy Kenichiro Sasae told reporters late Sunday. He added that North Korea offered no new proposals. 
South Korean envoy Chun Yung­woo said the sticking points touch on vital interests of many of the parties. "It's not a situation where 
a breakthrough is in sight," Chun said. 
Negotiators had hoped that the talks would concrete steps by North Korea to dismantle its nuclear programs in more than three years of negotiations and especially since Pyongyang's suc­cessful nuclear test in October. 
Pressure for a breakthrough was high, in part because the United States has said it would be point­less to continue the often inconclu­sive negotiations without progress. 
"Because this round could be the crossroads, today's talks took place in an atmosphere of height­ened tension," Sasae said.

Qlassics 
continued from page 1 
several faculty members -whom he would not name -asked him to avoid using "gay" and "lesbian" in the title. 
Working against the clock with a reduced staff of student organizers, Wall agreed to another rename. 
"After some discussion, the stu­dent organizers, myself included, freely chose to use a title that we created that didn't have the words lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans­gender in it," Wall said. "We decid­ed to do this because the event date was already so near that we didn't think we had enough time to debate with faculty members over the title." 
FIT chair Peter Holland referred Observer phone calls to FTI pro­fessor Pamela Wojcik. 
Wojcik, Wall's faculty liaison, said the University wanted to avoid the controversy that has traditionally surrounded the annual event, which was held Saturday in the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center. 
"The University administration is trying to allow the event without ruffiing feathers," she said. "The organizers were, in fact, still not allowed to use the word 'queer' and they were dissuaded from using the words 'gay' and 'les­bian."' 
Wojcik declined, however, to name individuals who expressed concern with the title. 
Wall said when the student organizers suggested to the FTT department and College of Arts and Letters a name that included "LGTBQ" -lesbian, gay, transgen­der, bisexual and questioning -in the title, "certain faculty members asked if we could come up with a different title that didn't use those words so as to avoid the kind of controversy and outside criticism that arose last year in response to the old title, 'Queer Film Festival."' 
Wall said he then met with sever­al professors to discuss a name change, which he said was a sug­gestion, not an order. 
"No one wants to say, 'We won't let you say this,' so they were say­ing, 'We would feel much more comfortable if you don't succinctly use these words," he said. 
After he agreed to a new title, Wall said he sent letters to other Arts and Letters departments requesting sponsorship. 
"Qlassics" organizers received financial support from the FTT department and the Gay and Lesbian Alumni of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's (GALA-ND/SMC), as well as endorsement from the his­tory department, the gender stud­ies program and the Hesburgh Program in Public Service. 
The departments and groups that sponsored past Queer Film Festivals and last year's Gay and Lesbian Film: Filmmakers, Narratives and Spectatorship include the FTT department, GALA-ND!SMC. the English depart­ment, the anthropology depart­ment, the history department, the Counseling Center and the gender studies program. 
Wall said he didn't think the name change request came from "the administration or the Main Building" but rather from faculty members in departments that worry about the response of the alumni. 
"I think some of these [Arts & Letters] departments are really worried about the criticism they may receive from the more conser­vative alumni," Wall said. 

Despite the success of last spring's Gay and Lesbian Film: Filmmakers, Narrators and Spectatorship -which broke attendance records from prior Queer Film Festivals -only three students joined Wall's staff of event coordinators. 
Wall and seniors Ishira Kumar, Lisa Goepfrich and Alisa O'Connor worked since December to rally sponsors and Arts & Letters departments to endorse the Qlassics film series. 
In addition to the department sponsors mentioned earlier, Wall said he also received a generous offer from AllianceND -a gay and lesbian support group on campus, unrecognized by the University ­to help promote the film series. 
Junior Stacey Williams, AllianceND secretary, said she was concerned when she didn't see any posters advertising the upcoming film event. 
Though AllianceND was "not in a position to help financially," Williams said the organization jumped to help publicize the screenings on campus. 
"We definitely offered to help with getting the word out," she said. "I sent out a few e-mails to the Progressive Student alliance Listserv, which is pretty extensive, as well as the Feminist Voice Listserv -groups we thought would be attracted to the film festi­val." 
Wall again said the rushed and understaffed situation in which he, Kumar and Goepfrich organized the event made it difficult to pro­mote the film series. 
However, he said the attendance increased as Saturday progressed, and the speakers were engaging. 
"Overall, I'd say the event, though certainly scaled down from last year, was still a success and hopefully accomplished its mission to create an academic space in which to connect with these impor­tant films and the issues they raise," he said. 
This year's event wasn't as big of a production as past gay and les­bian film festivals, Wall said, partly because it wasn't organized as early, and partly because of the theme. 
"Rather than focusing on the newest films and biggest filmmak­ers, we decided to focus instead on movies we considered LGBTQ clas­sics," Wall said. 
One of the featured films was Godmilow's "Roy Cohn/Jack Smith," two semi-biographical Broadway monologues contrasting two AIDS-afflicted, homosexual 
· men in the 1990s. 
She directed famed homosexual actor Ron Vawter before his death in 1994 due to AIDS-related com­plications. 
Wall said he hoped students attending the Qlassics film series would see "Hoy Cohn/Jack Smith" and understand some of the issues faced by homosexuals, which he said were relevant in the Notre Dame classrooms as well. 
"Student<; here are w1easy deal­ing with homosexuality," Wall said. "They struggle to reconcile their desire to be kind to other students and their belief that there is some­thing wrong with homosexuality ­and so our solution to th0 problem is just to ignore it completely and pretend it's not an issue on cam­pus."

IN BRIEF 

Cronkite: Media values profit over truth 
NEW YORK -Pressures by media companies to generate greater profits are threatening the very freedom the nation was built upon, former CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite said Thursday. 
In a keynote address at Columbia University, Cronkite said today's journalists face greater chal­lenges than those from his generation. No longer could journalists count on their employers to pro­vide the necessary resources, he said, "to expose truths that powerful politicians and special inter­ests often did not want exposed." 
Instead, he said, "they face rounds and rounds of job cuts and cost cuts that require them to do ever more with ever less." 
"It's not just the journalist's job at risk here. It's American democracy. It is freedom." 
Cronkite said news accuracy has declined because of consolidations and closures that have left many American towns with only one newspa­per. And as broadcasters cut budgets and air time for news, he said, "we're all left with a sound bite culture that turns political campaigns into political theater." 
The former anchor urged owners of media com­panies -newspapers and broadcast alike -to recognize they have special civil responsibilities. 
Businesses struggle with dating womers 
NEW YORK -Most small business owners have to deal at some time or another with employees who date, fall in love and probably break up: It's pretty hard to prohibit workers from becoming romantically involved, but own­ers can take steps to ensure that a relationship doesn't get in the way of getting the job done. 
Problems can arise no matter how the rela­tionship turns out or even if the relationship never gets off the ground. So human resources consultants say all companies should have a policy on dating and relationships among co­workers, and to be sure that employees are aware of it. 
There are two very critical reasons for formu­lating such a policy. Relationships can affect productivity, and not just that of the dating co­workers. Even more serious is the fact that workplace affairs of the heart have the poten­tial of turning into sexual harassment suits against an employer. 
But many HR experts say that realistically, such policies can't outright ban dating.

With all the recent excitement over this year's top-1 0 recruiting class (kudos to Coach Weis) and the talent that it brings to our football program, many couldn't help to still discuss the one (or three) that got away. However, I'd like to shift focus away from football for just a couple of minutes and talk about the one that really got away, the one that would undoubtedly make waves at Notre Dame like never before. 
Scrolling through the New York Times magazine online last Sunday, I felt intense frustration as I read one particular article. This artiele wasn't about American and Iraqi deaths incurred in Iraq by roadside bombing, the Iranian nuclear program, or the recent arrest of several Muslims in Britain accused of plotting to kill an Islamic member of the British armed forces. The article was about Tariq Hamadan, a man who could certainly shed light on these aforementioned, all too commonplace, topics. Reading through the article one gets a great sense of admiration for his eloquence and his constant efforts to "bridge a divide and bring together people of diverse backgrounds and world views." Although Ramadan comes from a genealogical tree that has its fair share of Muslim extremists (his grandfather founded the Muslim Brotherhood) he has chosen a different route: modera­tion and practical application of Islamic faith to the world we live in. While he decries neoliberal economics as inher­ently unjust and states that global capi­talism is the "abode of war," these inflammatory statements aren't simple empty statements tailored for the FOX news ticker but rather a provocative means of entering into a dialogue. As opposed to Ann Coulter, Tariq Ramadan doesn't exude controversy as a means of being controversial; he simply has strong, meaningful opinions that war­rant intense scrutiny and discussion in today's social and political climates. 

These meaningful, well-articulated opinions are now discussed at Oxford where he is a research fellow. 
He was supposed to be here. 
However, this wasn't a case of his reneging on signing day. Quite to the contrary, his children were enrolled in South Bend schools, his furniture had all been shipped here, his visa was in 
.order and he was fully prepared to begin teaching at the Kroc Institute. However, as the New York Times maga­zine article articulates, about $900 that he donated to charities led to the revo­cation of his visa. Nine-hundred measly dollars which he had donated to two different aid organizations that help Palestinians are, according to the U.S. State Department, the reason that he's not here. This money was given to charities that, at the time, were not on any blacklist and continue to run legiti­matoly and without scrutiny in Europe. However, at some point after his dona­tion, the United States decided that it was giving money to Hamas, the radical and violent Palestinian group. Despite the ex-post facto nature of the blacklist­ing, the present administration, in its infinite wisdom, decided to bar this valuable and much-needed voice from entering our country and teaching at our University. 
Heally? Nine-hundred dollars donatnd to two legitimate charities whose activi­ties weren't yet called in to question is enough to keep Tariq Ramadan away from America and its students? 
I don't buy it. 

What we have here is yet another iteration of the U.S. administration's desire to ignore and obstruct voices of dissent, even if that dissent is entirely well-founded and academic. Tariq Hamadan has an important place in American society and an invaluable role to play in this country's academic institutions. Due to the heroic and insightful efforts of those at the Kroc Institute such as Professor Scott Appleby, we almost had one of the most prominent Islamic voices right here on our campus. We almost had the oppor­tunity as students to be consistently challenged in our world views and our view of Islam in modern society. We were a simple visa away from being able to comprehend the issues that plague Muslims in Europe and the Middle East as well as, at an ever­increasing rate, those who reside in the United States. The Bush administration will have none of it. 
Barring one prominent and contro­versial scholar from entering our coun­try isn't the cause of our issues; it's a symptom. It shows us that the level of education, the prevalence of discourse, and the tenet of free speech that mil­lions have fought for and sworn to pro­tect, both in the courts and on the field of battle, aren't as high of a priority to this administration as we'd like them to be. As the next generation of leaders, we must be vigilant of those who would limit our access to controversy and attempt to curtail any serious discus­sion of issues which divide societies across the globe. 
We deserve better and we must demand better.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
A call to teach and change the nation 
We all are so very fortunate to call ourselves part of the Notre Dame community. 
We all have received excellent educations, and will likely have great success in whatever it is we choose to do with that education. I issue to you a challenge: use your education to create more educated, inquisitive people ready to take on the world. In sum, more people like you. 
In the beginning, Teach For America (TFA) was an idea nothing more than an undergraduate senior thesis about a national teacher corps. The basic idea was that an excellent education can be utilized to change children's lives-to give them new opportunities to meet the challenges associated with poverty. The key to this new life is an education. 
I was first reached by an amazing TFA presenter that spoke to a group in O'Shaughnessey in fall 1992. She spoke of the need to fill teaching positions in under-resourced, under-fund­ed schools throughout urban and rural areas in the United States. It was if she was speaking directly to me. Me, a Latina woman fluent in Spanish, who had an excellent education and many opportunities in life. Could I provide opportunities for children who had few? 
I answered the call and applied. "What about law school?" said my parents. I told them that a TFA experience would pre­pare me for law school. I told them I wanted to go to law school in order to provide legal services in the public interest. Except what did I know about what was needed in the public sector? I wanted to live it and learn how I could best serve the greater community that gave me so much. Fortunately, I was accepted in 1993 and my parents begrudgingly accepted my decision. 
I had tbe privilege of teaching wonderful bilingual kinder­gartners in inner-city Houston. Make no mistake, this job was not easy, and struggles are exceptionally difficult to stomach when one is used to success. The TFA experience is not for the weak or meek of heart, but for those who hear the call to serve in the classroom. Many tears were shed, many sleepless nights were spent pouring over books and acquiring materials for "my babies." But in the end, the efforts were well spent. My five-year-old students could read, write, add and subtract. A full quarter of my class could multiply. But my greatest achievement was getting one of my most neglected students to go from being unable to hold a pair of scissors, to being able to read sight words in one year. Miguel, wherever he is in the world, can read. I had a hand in making sure this one child is literate, and not illiterate. 
I do know where Lizette is today. She writes me during the holidays and lets me know about her activities and school. She sent me pictures of her quinceanera (traditional coming-of­age birthday celebration). She is now 17 and in the National Honor Society. 
As for me, after TFA I did go to law school, and am now a practicing criminal defense attorney at the Federal Defender's Office in Buffalo, N.Y. I see the difference that literacy makes every day, especially when I speak to a client that is illiterate. Would this person be sitting before me in chains if he had learned how to read? Would she have had more options in life if there had been someone who cared enough to give her opportunities to succeed? 
As I present a case before the judge in federal criminal court, I remember my students. They were my first audience, where I learned to communicate a message, to make my point. As I speak to a confused and scared client, or to a client's dis­traught family member, I remember the lessons my small stu­dents taught me about speaking softly to those who raise their voices to defuse a tense situation. 
More than 10 years ago, I was privileged to give two years of my life to the children of Houston. In the beginning, Teach For America had great goals and ideals, with the hope that the face of education could be changed. More than a decade later, those goals are being met one teacher and one classroom at a time. Now there is a new generation of children that thirst for the knowledge that will bring them a bright future. 
llow will they achieve this amazing education? Who will lead these children with oftentimes few resources and few role models down the ardent path of learning and achieve­ment? Who will counsel them through the failures and strug­gles that accompany any new endeavor that requires effort? Can you guide the future leaders of the community and nur­ture their desires to make things better? Can you grow the skills and abilities that they will need to succeed? 
Can you give two years of your life to create an indelible mark on a child? Can you change the future for the better? Can you help build the foundation of communities by prepar­ing those who will lead them? 
The final deadline to submit applications is Feb. 18. It can be found at www.teachforamerica.org. As a fellow Notre Dame alumnus and TFA alum. I ask you: Will you answer the call?

'BABEL' ASTOUNDS As TALE OF HUMANITY 
By TAE ANDREWS 
Assistant Scene Editor 
Editor's Note: This is the first in a five­part series on the 2007 Oscar nominees for Best Picture. 
As a film, "Babel" is very similar to last year's "Crash," which also involved a very convoluted and unlikely plot that tied together many different people from differ­ent walks of life. Also like "Crash," "Babel" is a film centered around the basic human­ity that ties together people, regardless of how different they might seem. 
"Babel" features Brad Pitt, who takes some time off from his typical routine of Hollywood star-glitter in such films as "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" and "Ocean's 12" to roll up his sleeves and get his hands dirty with some real acting. In doing so, he confirms his status as a legitimate actor with some real chops instead of being just a pretty face. Replete with a graying beard and some gristle on those chiseled features, Mr. Pitt does a good job of portraying Richard, a haggard husband trying to save his wife after she's shot while vacationing in Morocco. 
What may surprise most viewers is that 
Babel 

Director: Alejandro Gonzalez Ifiarritu Writer: Guillermo Arriaga Starring: Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Gael Garcia Bernal, Boubker Ait El Caid Pitt is not actually onscreen during much of the film. While his headshots are nice to splash on movie posters and marquee headlines, the story actually revolves around six different families with compli­cated and coincidental relationships. Cate Blanchett plays Pitt's estranged wife Susan and spends much of her time in "Babel" knocking on death's door and squirming in anguish as she is shot relatively early on in the movie. 
Boubker Ait El Caid plays Yussef, the young son of a Moroccan goatherd. When he is given a rille to shoot marauding jack­als, one thing leads to another and he and his brother end up shooting a tour bus con­taining Richard and Susan, which sets the whole Rube Goldberg-type plot in motion. 
While Richard and Susan are gone vaca­tioning in Morocco, their children are left in their San Diego home under the watchful eye of their nanny, Amelia, played by Adriana Barraza. After Amelia decides to take the kids to her son's wedding down in Mexico, the trio runs into trouble as they try to return to the country. On the other side of the globe, Rinko Kikuchi plays Chieko, a deaf-mute Japanese schoolgirl who is experiencing the advent of her teenage sexuality but is frustrated by her inability to communicate with young men -or them with her. 
The Kevin Bacon-esque game of six degrees of separation links the plot togeth­er, but what director Alejandro Gonzalez Ifiarritu is getting at is the underlying humanity, which ties all of humanity together. Extremely well made, "Babel" features beautiful sprawling shots of the Moroccan countryside and interesting and artistic editing. It's a tad long, clocking in at over two hours, but it's worth the extra film reel. 

Ifi.arritu, of previous fame with his 2003 hit "21 Grams," weaves a clear motif of communication throughout this sprawling and beautiful film. Whether it's the lan­guage barrier Richard faces in his time of crisis in Morocco, or Chieko's inability to communicate with the world around her, Ifiarritu is focused on fmding what exactly it is that gives people their sense of self. In addition, he clearly has a lot to say in terms of his political message, given the portrayal of the American government in the film as it deals with the international politics of securing Susan's rescue in Morocco and the Mexican-American border dynamic. 
Appropriately enough, "Crash" managed to make like its own title and crashed the Oscar party en route to scoring Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay awards, beat­ing out previous frontrunner "Brokeback Mountain." With a little luck and some Academy love, Ifiarritu may fmd himself lifting a trophy with a golden man for this well-made and beautiful film.

MEXICAN DIRECTORS TAKING HOLLYWOOD BY STORM 
By MARTY SCHROEDER 
Assistant Scene Editor 
American directors have long dominated Hollywood and the Academy Awards. Foreign directors have had difficulty mak­ing inroads into the upper echelons of Hollywood. Granted, there are notable exceptions such as Ang Lee from Taiwan and Michel Condry from France who made "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," respectively. However, this year marks a paradigm shift inside the highest awards of American (and many would argue world) cinema. A group of Mexican directors has taken Hollywood by storm-a group simi­lar to the French New Wave of the 1960s. Not similar so much in filmmaking style, but similar in bringing creative talent and amazing films from outside of the United States. 
Alejandro Gonzalez lnarritu 

Born in Mexico City in 1963, Alejandro Gonzalez Ifiarritu entered movies by study­ing filmmaking under Ludwik Margules and directing under Judith Weston. During the 1990s, he worked for Mexican TV com­pany Televisa and became one of their youngest directors. Moving on from Televisa, he set up Zeta films, which focused on advertising and short films. 
His entrance into the world of feature filmmaking came with "Amores Perras." 

Written by longtime accomplice Guillermo Arriaga, the film was nominated in 2001 for the Best Foreign language film and brought lfiarritu to fame. This fame mate­rialized itself in the invitation to direct the film "21 Grams" and work with famed Puerto Riean actor Benicia del Toro. This film garnered high critieal praise from art film circles and del Toro and Naomi Watts received Academy Award nominations for their performances. The success of this film translated into the current nominee for Best picture, "Babel." Regarded by many to the this years frontrunner for Best Picture due to its Golden Globe win, "Babel" has marked Ifiarritu's entrance into the inner eireles of Hollywood directors and his first definite mainstream success. 
Guillermo del Toro 

Del Toro rose to Hollywood fame through a different path -he began his career by directing big budget comic book films such as "Blade II" and "Hellboy." Instead of mov­ing closer and closer to Hollywood, del Toro began his career there and has moved fur­ther and further away while still retaining the credibility and fame he built up. Moving away from comic books this year, del Toro released the almost universally critically acclaimed "El Laberinto del Fauno [Pan's Labyrinth]." The favorite to win the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, "Laberinto" has stolen the hearts of view­ers around the world with its story from civil war-era Spain. 
Alfonso Cuar6n 

The third member of the Mexiean direc­torial trinity, Alfonso Cuar6n entered fea­ture filmmaking with "Solo Con Tu Pareja [Only With Your Partner]"-a dark come­dy about a playboy businessman who con­tracts HIV It was very popular in Mexico and garnered him some attention not so mueh with the American public but with the industry. His big break in the American film scene came with the provocative "Y Tu Mama Tambien." This was made in Mexico with a Mexican cast but was a smash hit in the American art-house circles. Producers noticed and gave Cuar6n the helm for the third installment in the Harry Potter series, "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban." Cuar6n was criticized by "Potter" fans for not following the book religiously. However, many critics regarded this film as a drastic improvement over the previous two "Potter" films. 
Following this was his latest effort, "Children of Men" starring Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and Sir Michael Caine. He, more so than the others, has had massive success both with Spanish and English lan­guage films. 
All three of these directors represent the filmmaking talent and creativity from Mexico. In an age when Hollywood can do little more than make sequels, these men are making some of the most creative and highly acclaimed films of the year. From the fantasy of "El Laberinto del Fauno" to the grittiness of "Children of Men" to the epic sweep of "Babel," these three men promise that the Mexican cinema is alive and well and American directors could cer­tainly learn much from them.

lsc~&fb:Rol 
Eddie Murphy needs to re-find inner comedian 
In case you missed it, "Norbit" was the top movie at the box office over the week­end. "Norbit," as in another movie where Eddie Murphy plays multiple roles, again donning a "fat suit" to play a character that interacts directly with his normal, thin self. Call me a Debbie Downer, but the repeated trend of Murphy playing numerous roles within a film reeks to me of the death of his comic ability. 
Gone are the days of Murphy's standup rou­tines, his "Saturday Night Live" career and the "Beverly Hills Cop" movies. In other words, gone are his funny days. The movie "Coming to America" ­while entertaining-started the trend of Murphy playing multiple roles in the same film, most notably the African prince Akeem. By all accounts, this was a good movie, and Murphy showed a fair amount of acting versatility in the various roles he played. 
It seems that he liked doing this so much, he wanted to play more than one character as often as he could. He did it again in Wes Craven's "Vampire in Brooklyn." You've probably seen the DVD cover at Blockbuster and laughed as you passed it by. It highlights Eddie Murphy looking like one of the most inept vampires of all time while holding a swooning Angela Bassett. Most critics panned the film and Murphy's attempt at portraying multiple characters when he couldn't even get one of them right. 

One would think Murphy might have stopped trying the multiple roles thing after this flop, but the next year, he starred a whopping seven times in "The Nutty Professor." This was another film that was mildly entertaining, but each of Murphy's characters seemed at times so similar, that you couldn't help but wonder why Sherman Klump needed such a large, neu­rotic family when they were all nearly identical anyways. 
"Bowfinger" was another film in which Murphy played two characters, and while it wasn't awful, it was quirky enough for many people (this writer included) to dis­like it. The greatest insult occurred when Murphy reprised his seven roles in "The Nutty Professor II" and managed to make all seven characters even more similar than the first go-round. "The Nutty Professor II" seemed to have been pro­duced solely to give Murphy a chance to act as different characters in a desperate attempt to show the world that he was still funny. 
Aside from "Shrek," most of his following movies disproved this point, most notably "Showtime", "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" and "The Haunted Mansion." After the "Mansion" flop, Murphy stayed away from starring roles for nearly four years, until "Norbit." 
To digress, recently Murphy earned an Oscar nomination for "Dreamgirls," but in this film he is both serious and a support­ing actor -two facets of acting where he is on unfamiliar ground. Perhaps this is tl1e sign of a new Eddie Murphy, an unfunny, serious Eddie Murphy, which would be a shame since he used to have such a knack for comedy. 

He tried to revive that knack with "Norbit," but the movie is just plain unfun­ny (blame the high ticket sales on Murphy's popularity because of "Dreamgirls," not the quality of "Norbit"). He has returned to his ways by playing three characters and once again wearing a fat suit as one of them. 
The idea of a fat suit is inherently funny when an actor does it one time, much like Ben Stiller did at the end of "Dodgeball." However, Eddie Murphy has now done this 
... 
so many tin1es, people eome to expeet him to wear the fat suit in multiple roles in his new films. 
Lets hope that it doesn't come to that. Lets hope that Eddie Murphy rediscovers his comic self and doesn't go down the potentially devastating road of 'The Nutty Professor III: Thee Times the Klumps."

LEGENDS REVIEW 
Ben Kweller heats up frigid night at Legends 
ByTAEANDREWS 
Assistant Scene Editor 
Word of mouth is a funny thing. From the absence of posters and general lack of official fanfare, Ben Kweller might have thought he was sneaking in the back door as his tour bus pulled up for a pit stop in South Bend last Friday night. However, like a game of colle­giate "Telephone," news of Kweller's impending arrival spread across cam­pus, resulting in hundreds of Domers making the journey across a frigid cam­pus to Legends. 
And so concert-goers found them­selves huddled and shivering outside of Legends last Friday night an hour before Kweller took the stage. However, despite the cold, anticipation built to . the point of bursting as the muffled sounds of the band soundchecking and rehearsing onstage reached the frozen ears of those waiting outside in the Siberian tundra that was Notre Dame. A lucky few managed to wait indoors, which opened shortly after 10:30, offer­ing a blessed respite from the sub-zero temperatures. 
It was worth the wait. Greeted with raucous cheers and excited applause from the moment he stepped onstage, Kweller flashed a youthful grin and clearly fed off the crowd's energy as the night went on. Dressed in a Where's Waldo-esque striped T-shirt, a corduroy jacket, and a tight-fitting pair of women's jeans, the cherubic-faced crooner looked every bit the face of boyish rock rebellion as he sang onstage with his carefully-groomed curls bouncing every which way as he rocked all night long. 
With lyrics that range from silly to sweet, the best part of Kweller is that he manages to switch between ener­getic rock anthems and simple but sweet love ballads. Sometimes he even manages to do both in the same song, as he did while playing "On My Way." Starting off with a simple "boom-chika" strum reminiscent of Johnny Cash, Kweller dropped lyrical gems such as, "I wanna kill this man I but he turned around and ran I I'll kill him with karate that I learned in Japan" before finishing on a softer note with lyrics such as, ''I'm in love with someone I who's as pretty as a flower I her life gives me power I so I'm buying her a ring." In addition, Kweller played hits such as "I Need You Back," "My Apartment" and "The Rules." He also showed off his sweeter side, just in time for Valentine's Day, with songs such as "Believer" and "The Rules." 
That's the essence of mop-topped rocker -his ability to capture the fun and spirit of rock 'n roll and then shake things up with a varied array of differ­ent-sounding jams. 
Whatever he was doing, it was work­ing, as the crowd went along with every song he sang. Legends was filled to capacity, and the Kweller-crazed and uninitiated alike jammed out in unison as the audience turned into a sea of bobbing heads sprinkled with the occa­sional mosher jumping up and down and screaming along in unison to every lyric with as much passion as Kweller himself. 

After the band left the set, the stage didn't remain dark for very long as the audience immediately roared with thunderous applause and call for an encore. Kweller didn't make them wait for long, coming out for a solo bit in which he showed off his musical versa­tility, playing a cover of Garth Brooks' "Friends In Low Places" and Roger Miller's "Chug-A-Lug," which set off a round of restaurant-rocking choruses of "chug-a-lugs" and "hi-dee-hos." Finally, Kweller gave the audience what it had been waiting for all night, pulling his band back onstage for a rendition of his signature anthem, "Wasted and Ready," which set off the crowd like a powder keg. Good luck trying to quell that audi­ence and silence the energy of the old and new fans alike. 
Ben Kweller's playing at Legends is appropriate enough for a burgeoning rock star, as he is quickly blossoming into one of the most loved, especially here on campus.

NBA 

Pavlovic nets 21 as Cavs down Lakers 99-90 
Dwyane Wade scores 26 in Miami victory 
Associated Press 
CLEVELAND Sasha Pavlovic scored 13 points in the fourth quarter, picking up the slack for LeBron James, and the Cleveland Cavaliers shut down Kobe Bryant in the final minutes for a 99-90 win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday. 

Pavlovic, suddenly a major cog in Cleveland's offense, fin­ished with 21 points, Zydrunas Ilgauskas 17 and Anderson Varejao 12 -11 in the fourth -as the Cavaliers improved to 20-7 at home with their second straight solid effort. 
James had 18 points, eight rebounds and five assists, but he deferred to Pavlovic and others down the stretch, and Cleveland's supporting cast came through. James was outscored 25-7 by Bryant in the second half, but the All­Star forward got to crown the Cavs' win with a soaring dunk in the final seconds. 
Bryant scored 36 points to lead the Lakers, who went 3-5 on an eight-game swing through the bitterly cold East. Bryant scored Los Angeles' first 14 points in the final peri­od, but with Larry Hughes guarding him, he didn't score again in the final 3:39 after making two free throws to tie it 81-all. 
Vladimir Radmanovic scored 12 points and Lamar Odom 11 for the Lakers, whose bench was outscored 46-15. 
Varejao made two free throws for the Cavs -the NBA's worst team from the line -with 3:20 to go and James followed by making a pair for his first points of the second half to make it 85-81 with 2:59 left. 
The Lakers, who led by three points entering the fourth, got within 86-85 on Smush Parker's jumper before James drove and passed to Varejao, who sunk a 17 -footer to put the Cavaliers ahead by three. 
On the Lakers' next trip, Hughes slapped the ball out of Bryant's hands and it was picked up by Pavlovic, who raced to the other end and was fouled by Parker while making a layup. Pavlovic, who came in averaging 14 points in his last six games, completed the three-point play to put the Cavs ahead 91-85. 
With the Cavs paying extra attention to Bryant, none of the other Lakers stepped up and when Varejao made a three­point play with 4 7 seconds left the Cavaliers were up 93-87 and on their way to a second straight impressive victory after beating Miami on Friday. 

Bryant made seven free throws and outscored James 11-0 in the third period when the Lakers overcame an 11­point halftime deficit to take a 6 7-64 lead. Cleveland went 4­of-25 (16 percent) from the field in the quarter with James missing all five of his attempts. 
Hughes hit a 3-pointer and rookie Daniel Gibson, who challenged Shaquille O'Neal on a drive to the basket Friday, made a three-point play as the Cavaliers outscored the Lakers 9-1 to take a 52-41 lead at halftime. 
James, who earlier this sea­son drained an 80-foot, buzzer­beating 3-pointer in Boston, dropped one from 55 feet at the end of the first half but the shot was disallowed because it came just after the horn. 
Heat 100, Spurs 85 
Once Dwyane Wade got rolling, things seemed almost easy for the Miami Heat. 
Wade -virtually silent offen­sively for the first three quar­ters -had 18 of his 26 points in the final period and the Heat held San Antonio without a field goal for more than 7 min­utes down the stretch on the way to beating the Spurs on Sunday. 
He was 3-for-9 from the field entering the fourth, then hit 7­of-10 shots in the final 12 min­utes, falling two points short of matching the Spurs' offensive total in the stanza by himself. Miami outscored San Antonio 31-20 in the fourth. 
"It was a great game until Dwyane Wade decided to take over," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. "And then it was over." 
Shaquille O'Neal had 16 points in 25 minutes; he didn't play in the final 15:44, partly because he's still coming back from knee surgery, partly because the smaller lineup the Heat used did well enough to not necessitate his return. Jason Kapono added his first career double-double, 13 points and 11 rebounds. 
The win was Miami's fifth in its last six games and pulled the Heat within one game of the .500 mark again; Miami (25-26) can get there Tuesday when it hosts Portland in its last game before the All-Star break. 
"We're just trying to continue to get better," Wade said. "If anyone knows basketball, they understand that we're not going anywhere, that we've been having a lot of injuries. But we're getting it back. That's our whole focus, to keep

Mickelson ties Pebble Beach 
record with 5-shot win 
PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. -Anyone 
worried that Phil Mickelson was emo­
tionally scarred by that U.S. Open col­
lapse can relax. 

Mickelson finally got his season on 
track Sunday by closing with a 6-under · 66 under surprising sunshine to. tie the tournament record at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am and win by five shots 
for the 30th victory of his career. 
Mickelson overcame a double bogey 
with a lost ball early in the round with 
three birdies in a four-hole stretch along 
the ocean, turning a tight race into 
another runaway. He matched the 
largest margin of victory at this tourna­
ment, winning by five shots over Kevin 
Sutherland (71). 

It was the 11th time in 15 seasons that 
Mickelson won on the West Coast Swing, 
and the timing couldn't have been better. 
He had started his season slowly, allow­
ing the conversation to linger on his gaffe 
last summer at Winged Foot. 
Yates' 2 on Daytona 500 front 
row 

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -Robert Yates Racing went from skid row to the front row, emerging from the darkest season in team history to take the Daytona 500 spotlight. 
At least for a week. 
David Gilliland and Ricky Rudd won the top two starting spots Sunday in qualifYing for the Daytona 500, putting Yates back on the racing map after a horrendous season. 
"There was a time last year when I felt like I maybe was the problem, and wasn't in love with it and really wanted to leave (racing)," Yates said. "I could have walked out of here last year. I want this next year to get this thing up, get the sky that was falling on us, get it up." 
That dark time saw Yates lose his drivers, a sponsor and both of his crew chiefs in a tumultuous year that saw the once-proud team collapse to the point that Yates was convinced he was dying. 
Noble Court on pace for 
Kentucky Derby witfi win 
ARCADIA, Calif. -Noble Court made a big move to the front approaching the stretch and then fought off a late challenge by Law Breaker to win the $150,000 San Vicente Stakes for 3-year-olds Sunday. 
The victory kept Noble Court on the Kentucky Derby trail, with his next start set for March 1 7 in the San Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita. 
A surging Law Breaker ran out of room at the wire, losing by a neck for trainer Bob Baffert, a three-time Kentucky Derby winner whose other promising 3-year-old, E Z Warrior, was back in the barn with a sore foot. 
Baffert won the San Vicente last year with Fusaichi Rock Star. 
Noble Court covered seven fur­longs in 1:23.12 under Corey Nakatani, aboard for the third time in the colt's four-race career.

Havlat leads Blackhawks over Blue Jackets 
Dallas rocks Colorado, Red Wings roll Flames 
Associated Press 
COLUMBUS-Martin Havlat is playing well. It's no coincidence that the Chicago Blackhawks are, too. 
Havlat had a goal and two assists and. the Blackhawks scored three times in the open­ing period and then held off the Columbus Blue Jackets 5-4 on Sunday. 
"I feel I'm playing the best hockey I've ever played, for sure," said Havlat, acquired along with Bryan Smolinski from Ottawa in a blockbuster deal last summer. "That's my goal every year -to be better than the sea­son before." 
Havlat has seven goals and three assists in a six-game goal streak. 
Peter Bondra and Smolinski each had a goal and an assist and Patrick Sharp and Martin Lapointe also scored for the Blackhawks, who have won five of their last seven games. 
A few Blue Jackets fans chant­ed "We want a re-fund!" in the third period -before their team came back with two goals to almost force overtime. 
Anson Carter, Ron Hainsey and David Vyborny each had a goal and an assist and Alexander Svitov also scored for Columbus, which dropped behind the Blackhawks into last place in the Central Division. Brian Berard and Rick Nash each added two assists. 
Down 5-2 with less than 11 minutes left, the Blue Jackets drew within one on Vyborny's rebound goal with 3:58 remain­ing. They almost tied it with just under 2 minutes left when goal­tender Nikolai Khabibulin stopped Vyborny's shot from the high slot. 
"Khabibulin played fantastic and he saved us at the end," Smolinski said. 
Before a national television audience -a first for the 6­year-old Columbus franchise ­the Biackhawks dominated at the outset. 
Outshooting the Blue Jackets 15-3 in the opening period, they scored three times in a span of 3:38. 
"We started· poorly again," Columbus coach Ken Hitchcock said. "We have some competitive issues that we have to deal with." 

At the 9-minute mark, Cam Barker's slap shot from the left point glanced off Radim Vrbata in the slot and resulted in a big rebound that Sharp netted from the edge of the right circle. 
Just over a minute later, Havlat passed to the back boards to Tuomo Ruutu, who saucered a centering pass that Smolinski converted for his 12th goal. 

The Blackhawks, who have outscored Columbus 12-4 in the first period of their six meetings this year, made it 3-0 on their next shot. Havlat ended up with the puck at center ice after a giveaway by Berard. Havlat skat­ed past defenseman Rostislav Klesla, who hooked his right arm as he went past, and swooped in alone on goaltender Fredrik Norrena, whose new two-year contract was announced just before the game. Havlat skated to an abrupt stop at the left goal mouth and then reached back to flick the puck past the goalie. 
"It was a tough game -the sixth game of a road trip," coach Denis Savard said. "There were little, wee mistakes we work on every day-we'll fix it. Part of it is not focusing on what we need to do in our coverage. It's going to happen. It's a young team. Tonight fatigue might have set 

in." 
Norrena was replaced by Pascal Leclaire, who had missed the last 21 games because of knee surgery. 
The Blue Jackets cut the gap to 4-2 with a pair of power-play goals. 
Anson Carter's centering pass for Nash went off his stick and to Hainsey for a one-timer with Columbus on a two-man advan­tage. 
After Lapointe's wrister on a rush made it 4-1, Carter scored on a jam shot off Vyborny's nifty pass through the crease. 
In the final period, Bondra scored off a rebound of Havlat's shot from the high slot, with Svitov answering with a wrist shot from the right dot and Vyborny closing the scoring by going high over Khabibulin's shoulder to set up the wild fm­ish. 
Detroit 7, Calgary 4 
Henrik Zetterberg had two goals and two assists, lifting the Detroit Red Wings to a win over the Calgary Flames on Sunday night. 
Joey MacDonald his first career win in goal as the Red Wings outshot the Flames 50-20. 
Detroit also got a goal and an assist each from Tomas Holmstrom, Mathieu Schneider, and Jason Williams, and Pavel Datsyuk, and Johan Franzen also added a goal each. Nicklas Lidstrom and Dan Cleary each had two assists. 
Roman Hamrlik had a goal and an assist for Calgary, and Alex Tanguay, Jeff Friesen, and Mark Giordano also scored. Miikka Kiprusoff stopped 11 of 14 shots before being replaced by Jamie McLennan. 
Detroit chased Kiprusoff with three first-period goals. 
Zetterberg opened the scoring with a wrist shot from the high slot after Kiprusoff misplayed the puck behind the net. Datsyuk put in the rebound of Holmstrom's shot for his 17th goal, and Schneider beat Kiprusoff with a slap shot from the point 1:10 later. 
Kiprusoff was then pulled. The Red Wings outshot the Flames 17-5 in the period. 
The barrage continued in the second period. Zetterberg got his second goal of the night and 26th of the season, on the power play, before Calgary got going. 
Tanguay capitalized on a turnover in front of the Detroit net by Franzen and beat MacDonald just 42 seconds later for his 16th goal. 
But Williams and Holmstrom both scored in the middle period. 
Dallas 7, Colorado 5 
Even without All-Star goalie Marty Turco finishing games, the Dallas Stars are winning and making up ground in the Pacific Division. 
Jeff Halpern had a goal and two assists in a victory over the Colorado Avalanche on Sunday, when the Stars set a season high for goals and were involved in a 12-goal game for the first time in more than nine years. 
The Stars' scoring surge came a day after their 1-0 victory over division-leading Anaheim when Mike Smith started instead of

Belles edge Hornets in late 1110111ents 
Lipke's free throw with seven seconds remaining seals victory 
By DAN COOPER Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's point guard Bridget Lipke hit her second free-throw with seven seconds remaining, which ended a sec­ond-half Kalamazoo surge and gave the Belles a 62-60 victory Saturday at the Anderson Athletic Center in Kalamazoo, -Mich. 
Kalamazoo (3-19, 2-12 MIAA) entered the game on an eight­game losing skid, winning only one of their previous 14 games. Saint Mary's (10-11, 9-5 MIAA), on the other nand, had won four of its last five and appeared on a roll before Saturday's scare. 
The Belles jumped to an early lead but struggled down the stretch. 
The Hornets ended the game on a 14-4 run before Lipke's free throw gave the Belles a 62-58 lead. Though junior Kalamazoo guard Therese Demres hit a layup with one second left, Kalamazoo didn't have time for another score. 
"It was senior day [for 
Kalamazoo] and they played with emotion," Saint Mary's coach Jennifer Henley said. "They are a scrappy team, and we couldn't put them away."

"I think we have a few things left to fine-tune," Coyne said. "But I think this exhibition has given us the extra push and renewed our commit­ment for this year." 
Notre Dame also received news Friday that Ohio University had canceled its women s

Irish rally to defeat Wisconsin 5-2 
Team fights off early deficit to beat Badgers 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA Sports Writer 

Wisconsin was looking for its second upset of a ranked team this week against No. 9 Notre Dame Sunday, but the Irish had other plans. 
Notre Darrie bounced back from early deficits to fight off the Badgers 5-2. 
Wisconsin -still high from its upset of No. 10 Miami -had the Irish on their heels from the beginning, taking the doubles point for the early 1-0 lead. Nolan Polley and Moritz Baumann won 8-6 against No. 11 Sheeva Parbhu and Ryan Keckley in No. 1 singles. Stephen Bass and Andrew Roth 
__[____~ 

beat Michael Dierberger and Michael Muskievicz 8-3, but the Badgers locked up the doubles point when Jeremy Sonkin and Lachezar Kasarov secured an 8­5 victory over Brett Helgeson and Barry King. 
"It was a set-back at [No. 1] and [No. 2] doubles for us, but hopefully only a temporary one," Notre Dame coach Bobby Bayliss said. 
The singles matches that fol­lowed were just as close as dou­bles play, but Notre Dame was able to pull away with victories in five out of the six matches to win the overall contest. 
Helgeson and King both fin­ished off their opponents in straight sets. Helgeson defeated Baumann, 6-4, 7-6 (3), to gar­ner his sixth-straight victory, while King battled against Dierberger to come away with the 6-3, 7-5 win and improve to 5-2 in dual action. 
"[Wisconsin] didn't quit at all, they didn't check out at point when they got behind -they made us really earn it," Bayliss said. 
Second and fourth singles proved to be a little bit more trying for Parbhu and Keckley. Parbhu dropped his first set 5-7, but rallied for nearly perfect 6-0 and 6-1 wins in the second and third sets for the victory. 
"As the match went on [Parbhu] got better and better, and in the last two sets he was nearly flawless," Bayliss said. 
Keckley also dropped his first set 4-6, but fought back to win 6-2 and 6-3 in his second and third matches, respectively. 
Bayliss said Keckley showed a lot of poise. Keckley suffered from back spasms in the second set and had to take a medical timeout to be attended to by a trainer. He came back from his injury and never looked back to take his sixth-straight match win in dual play. 
Bass saw little trouble at No. 1 singles as he took the first set 6­1 from Sonkin. Bass again jumped to the early 1-0 lead when Sonkin dropped out of play due to a back injury. 
Wisconsin's only singles point came during No. 6 singles when Felipe Bellido dropped the first set 5-7 to Roth, but picked up his game to win 6-4 and 6-3 in 
the  second  and  third  sets,  
respectively.  
Although  the  Irish  left  

Madison with a victory behind them, Bayliss said he would like to see the team step up its play in the coming days. He said that the team will try to focus on doubles and net play to prepare for upcoming matches in the USTAIITA National Team Indoor Championships. 
Bayliss expects to see a strong .showing from the Badgers throughout the rest of the sea­son as well. 
"[Wisconsin] is a very much improved team," he said. "l can see how they beat Miami, and they will definitely get some good wins along the way."

Barlow replaces center D'Amico as starter, scores 13 in victory 
By BILL BRINK Sports Writer 
For the first time in 2 7 games this season, Notre Dame changed its starting lineup -inserting freshmen guard Ashley Barlow for cen­ter Melissa D'Amico. 
The move proved effective, as the Irish beat DePaul 78-70 Sunday night at the Joyce cen­ter. 
Notre Dame (16-8, 7-4 Big East) fell behind early, trailing by as many as six points four dif­ferent times in

remaining in the half, the Irish put together a nine-point run and took a 22-19 lead with under six minutes remaining. Notre Dame held the lead for the rest of the game. 
Notre Dame started four guards to counter DePaul's smaller, quicker lineup. D'Amico and center Erica Williamson saw just 24 min­utes combined. 
"We wanted to go small," Notre Dame head coach Muffet McGraw said. "I thought in the Louisville game we had a stretch with Crystal [Erwin] at the side and our small team in and we looked pretty good and I thought defensively that would be a good thing to try. 
improve­
ment," she 
said. 
Barlow scored 12 points in the second half and played tight, aggressive defense. On one play, she ran the length of the court and broke up what looked like an easy fast break layup -knocking the ball out of bounds and flying into the cheerleaders in the process. That play resulted in a turnover on the inbounds pass and a Notre Dame fast break. 
Barlow wasn't fazed by her first start, even though the game was televised on ESPN2 and drew a crowd of 7,579, the second largest of the sea­son. 
Notre Dame's quick lineup led to opportunities in transi-And I think it was pretty suc­cessful. I think Erica [Williamson] did a pretty good job when she was in there but the small team really helped." 
The Irish were more intense and physical in the second half, led by guard Charel Allen who finished with 25 points and 13 rebounds -her third double-double of the season. 
"When the refs let us play, why not go after a loose ball, dive for a loose ball and go after the rebound?" Allen said. "And that's w~at I did. They weren't calling anything so you just have to go with the flow." 
Barlow had a rocky start, accumulating two fouls in the first six minutes of the game and scoring only one point in 
the first half. 
"It was 
tough to come tion, which also allowed the 
Irish to control the game. 
"I thought that's where we broke the game open," McGraw said of the team's transition play. "They looked a little tired after they ran us in the first half, and we were able to get some steals, force some turnovers, and that got our running game going." 
Notre Dame forced 23 turnovers while only turning the ball over themselves 17 times. 
"Ashley got a couple of steals and we got our hands on the ball," McGraw said. "We're pretty good at turning the ball over. Most teams turn it over at least 20 times against our defense, and that really gets us going." 
The Irish defense was much tougher in the second half, holding Quigley to three points and one shot attempt. 

"In the first half, the shots were coming easier," Quigley said. \ 
Blue Demons coach Doug Bruno felt that his team's loss resulted not from lack of exe­cution, but because of Notre Dame's disruptive defense. 
"Notre Dame did a great job of defending us and making us confused offensively," he said. "That resulted in our turnovers in the first half. We really were hard-pressed all game to find a rhythm offen­sively and that's to the Notre Dame defense's credit." 
Allen's 13 rebounds were a career high, surpassing her previous best of 10. This was her seventh game with 20 or more points, five of which have come in the past eight games. The win moves Notre Dame into three-way tie for fifth in the Big East conference.

No. 1 Notre Dame (24-5-4, 18-3-3 CCHA) allowed Nebraska-Omaha to create some last-moment heroics of its own Saturday night when the Mavericks erased a 2-0 Irish lead with two goals in the last five minutes of the third period. The Mavericks (13-13-8, 10-10-4 CCHA) pressured throughout over­time in the second game, but the score ended tied 2-2. It was the fourth meeting between the two teams this season, with Notre Dame win­ning the series 2-1-1 after a split on the road in Omaha earlier in the year. 
The tie will slow Notre Dame's ability to clinch the CCHA regular-season title. The Irish need to take three points out of their next four games to eliminate third­place Michigan and fourth­place Michigan State from the race, while second-place Miami sits in front of the Michigan schools because it has played two more games to date. For the Mavericks, the tie was crucial as it allowed them to remain in a tie for fifth-place with Ohio State -and in position for a key first-round matchup against last-place Bowling Green. ·

to land a few. 
In the first period, Brown had the best seat in the house, even though that's not much to brag about at the Joyce Center. The first save he had to make wasn't until Mavs' defenseman Dan Knapp got off a desperation shot from center ice as the horn blew. In fact, the first Irish goalie to touch the puck was backup Jordan Pearce, who made a nice glove save when an errant pass was deflected into the Notre Dame bench. 
That was the second time this season that an Irish opponent was held to one shot on net in a period -the first was in a 3-0 shutout against Army Oct. 27. The Black Knights tallied up a whopping seven total shots in the contest. Low numbers like those have become the norm at Notre 

Dame; the last time a team regis­
tered higher than 20 was Mia:r~i 
more then two weeks ago. · Brown currently owns the 
NCAA's top goals against average 
at 1.72 and the third best win­
ning percentage (.817), while 
ranking only 12th in save per­
centage. A lot of the credit for 
those numbers goes to his team­
mates who have consistently 
eliminated rebound chances and 
odd man rushes with physical 
play throughout the season. That 
extra support has catapulted 
Brown into the national spotlight in his senior year, making him a 
media favorite as well as a lead­ing candidate to nab hockey's 
highest honor -the Hobey 
Baker. He would be quick to tell 
you that those honors are as 
much of a reflection of the team 
as on his own personal success. 
However, Irish coach Jeff Jackson and Brown both agreed that seeing a steady diet of 30 when he roofed a loose puck into the open left side of the net. 
The Mavericks struggled in the first period to generate any offense, getting their first shot of the game off with one second left in the period -a long dump-in from beyond the blue line that Brown easi­ly handled. 
"We weren't getting much offense because [the Irish] were doing such a good job defensively against us in the first two periods," Mavericks coach Mike Kemp said. 
Brown stopped 34-of-38 shots faced during the week­end, while Dupont made 49 total saves.

shots a game may have made those impressive stats even bet­ter. Facing a constant flow of action during a game is easier for a goalie than staying mental­ly focused in between spurts of offense that add up to the 15-20 shots he has been seeing on an average night this year. 
That doesn't mean that the Notre Dame defense will slack off in the last two weeks of the regular season. Brown and Jackson are both more than happy with the formula that has earned them a 24-5-3 record and a first round bye in the CCHA playoffs. And as for the stats, the only one number they need to be concerned with is No.1.

HOROSCOPE 
CELEBRITIES BORN ON THIS DAY: Kelly Rowland, 26: Mike Shinoda. 30: Jennifer Aniston, 38; Burt Reynolds, 71 
Happy Birthday: You can dream all you want but actions speak louder than words. You have to be willing to take on whatever task is necessary if you want to get ahead personally or professionally. You may make a few mistakes along the way but that will be better than not making any decisions or progress at all. Your numbers are 9, 15, 19, 25, 38. 47 
ARIES (March·21-Aprill9): Don't look at the obvious--use your intuition and you will find out that there is a lot more going on behind your back than you realized. Getting angry and upset won't help. Be smart and talk to the right people to protect yourself, your assets and your future. 5 stars 
TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Relying on others will only lead to disappointment today. Make your own arrangements and take the initiative. If you surround yourself with positive people, you will get positive results. 3 stars 
GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Don't worry so much about the things you can't change. You may have to rethink one of your relationships. Don't let your emotions steer you in the wrong direction. 3 stars 
CANCER (June 21-July 22): Make some changes around your home. A move, renovating. redecorating or just setting up new rules to live by will tum out well. The more you do to improve your emotional and physical situation, the better you will feel. 3 stars 
LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): You'll attract a lot of attention today if you get out and participate. Today should be about having fun but be honest about your intentions. Someone could turn into a pest if you are too friendly. 5 stars 
VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Don't take things so literally or criticize others today or you will end up in a scuffle over nothing. Sudden changes in the way someone views you will probably leave you perplexed. You can make amends by doing something nice. 2 stars 
LIBRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): Travel, visit friends, do things with children or socialize. Attend an event that can offer you a new way of seeing things or grabs your attention as a new hobby or interest. You will be entertained and enlightened. 4 stars 
SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Keep moving, don't look back and do everything in your power to finish what you started. This can be a perfect day for love, networking. socializing and getting back to doing the things you love the most. 3 stars 
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): You have to follow through and do what you feel is necessary but don't do so at someone else's expense. Be fair and make sure you deserve what you are going after. Don't overreact or exaggerate. 3 stars 
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Spend the day puttering about, finishing off odd jobs. You'll be surprised how much you get accomplished and how much you please the people around you. You can formulate a game plan for future prospects. 3 stars 
AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Your charm will lead to a proposal or offer that will be difficult to turn down. You may not realize how much you can actually do to help others. Take the lead and you may spare someone from making the same mistakes you made in the past. 4 stars 
PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Don't be too eager to share your thoughts. Someone is likely to twist them around and use them against you. Hang on to what you've got--this is not the time to lend, borrow or share. 2 stars 
Birthday Baby: You are an inventor and a person with a passionate eye. You are helpful but able to remain detached. You are reliable and worldly. You like to think big but that often gets you into trouble.

Last-second leap 
Deeth sparks late win Friday before Mavericks force 2-2 tie Saturday 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Wrirer 

Irish center Kevin Deeth took it to Nebraska-Omaha goal­tender Jeremie Dupont, then he took it to the student section in the last seconds of Friday's 4-2 win over the Mavericks at the Joyce Center. 
Deeth capped a six-goal third period between the two teams with a backhand wraparound goal past Dupont with 10 sec­onds left in the game to give the Irish the 3-2 lead. It was Deeth's second goal of the night, and the freshman cele­brated by jumping into the glass in front of the Notre Dame student section, where he was mobbed by teammates. 
"It's kind of a joke on the team, something we always talk about doing," Deeth said of the game-winning leap. "To quote [right wing linemate] Ryan Thang, he says 'Taking it to the band.' I kind of go a little bit more toward the student sec-

Hobey Baker candidate must stay sharp even as pressure remains light 
Any goalie in the nation would be thrilled with the opportunity to suit up for Notre Dame. From front to back, the Irish smother opposing offenses by playing tough in their own zone and controlling the puck. But for Hobey Baker candidate Dave Brown, his sup­porting cast can quickly become an Achilles heel. 
Brown faced 22 shots in Saturday's 2-2 tie with Nebraska­Omaha, more than half of which came in the last eight min­utes of regulation and the five minute overtime period. The senior was as cold as ice when the Mavericks finally clicked, scoring both of their goals in the last 4:12. It was like stepping into the ring with Mike Tyson after nine rounds of Sock-N-Boppers against Sister Mary Grace-he's probably going

Men, women slice up Duke Duals 4-0, 4-0 
By KEN FOWLER 
Sporrs Ediror 
Flat tires can slow Notre Dame, they just can't stop the Irish. 
After arriving in Durham, N.C., seven hours before Friday's 9 a.m. start of the Duke Duals, Notre Dame start­ed sluggishly but rebounded to dominate the rest of the tour­nament. 
The No. 4 Irish women and No. 5 Irish men each went 4-0 in team bouts over North Carolina, Duke, Johns Hopkins and Air Force. The team col­lected five of the six cups pre­sented to the best team in each weapon for both men and women. 
"We expected that we can win but it's always good to be sure and get this result," Irish coach Janusz Bednarski said. "Of course it was not easy in some certain cases." 

The Notre Dame men, who competed Friday, arrived at their hotel a little before 2 a.m. that day because of mechanical trouble at O'Hare International Airport. 
The men's sabre team lost five of nine matches against the Tar Heels to kick off the competition, but the foilists' recovered with a 8-1 perform­ance against UNC. Coincidentally, the foilists' 5-4 loss to Duke cost the Irish the cup in their weapon, which went to the Blue Devils. 
Irish coach Janusz Bednarski said once the sabres got their adrenaline going, they found their rhythm. The group went 7-2 against Duke and Air Force and 9-0 versus Johns Hopkins. 
Sophomore Bill Thanhouser's 10-2 mark lead the way for the unit, and senior Matt Stearns finished 9-3. In the epee, junior Greg Howard went 8-2 while

Louderback rests key players versus short­handed Louisville 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Wrirer 
Notre Dame was able to rest key players while put­ting a short-handed Louisville squad to rest 6-1 Friday at home for its first Big East win of the season. 
"This was good, especially coming back after the [ITA National Team Indoors]." Irish coach Jay Louderback said.
