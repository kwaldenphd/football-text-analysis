Flu vaccinations suspended 
Shortage affects Notre Dame, Saint Mary's health centers 
By KATIE PERFY News Writer 
The suspension of a manu­facturing license for a major influenza vaccination provider caused both Notre Dame's University Health Services and Saint Mary's Health and Wellness Services to announce Wednesday they will be unable provide flu shots for students and staff this flu season. 
The Chiron Corporation ­Notre Dame and Saint Mary's only source of the influenza vaccines -said Tuesday it would be unable to supply its product this season due to problems in one its chief pro­duction facilities, University spokesman Matt Starin said in a statement. 
According to a statement from the Chiron Corporation. the Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency placed a temporary suspen­sion on the company's license to produce Fluvirin, Chiron's trademark vaccine for influenza. Consequently, Chiron was unable to manu­facture the vaccine for the 2004-05 season. 
A large dependency on the Chiron Corporation to supply flu vaccines nationwide has led to significant shortages, especially on college campus­es. Universities across the country have contacted the Centers for Disease Control in an attempt to purchase flu vaccines from other universi­ties who may have surpluses of the vaccine, University Health Services Director Ann Kleva said. 
"Everyone is clamoring. We have to be considerate to the whole population of the United States," Kleva said. 
At the present time, Health Services has been unable to obtain the vaccine from another source, but the department will continue its efforts, said Kleva. 
The University will also con­tact federal and state officials about other sources of the flu vaccine, Starin said. Health Services is currently trying to acquire a supply of "flu-mist," which is a nasal form of pro­tection against the virus, from the product's distributor. 
Health Services is also working with the South Bend Clinic to mitigate the effects of the shortage. At the present time, the clinic has 17,000 doses of the vaccine that will be made available to high-risk persons only, said Kleva. The clinic has defined those eligi­ble as individuals aged two through 64 with chronic ill­nesses such as lung and heart disease, diabetes and asthma. If and when the University obtains any vaccines from other sources, they will be granted to students on the basis of risk-level. Those stu­dents more prone to influenza will receive immunization prior to low-risk students, Kleva said. 
Kleva also noted the Notre Dame community has a "sub­stantial" population of high­risk individuals. However. although she was concerned

INSIDE COLUMN 

Out of the ordinary 
In the middle of first semester I have 
perfected my daily routine. I attend my 
morning classes, eat lunch, come back to 
the room and check my e-mail, then 
head out for an afternoon workout. 
On Tuesday, I

overnight summer­
to-winter season 
change. Water bottle and CD player in 
hand, I bee bopped out of Le Mans and 
towards the library green. 
And then I saw it. 
Rows upon rows of small, white, wood­
en crosses decorated the usually bare 
green, resembling the white crosses of 
fallen U.S. soldiers. Some of the crosses 
were pulled out of the ground. Had a 
beautiful autumn backdrop not accom­
panied these crosses, this would have 
been the most eerily somber cemetery I 
have ever seen. 
As I approached, a sign hung between 
two trees hit me like a punch in the 
stomach. It read, "l\vice the population 
of Saint Mary's is killed everyday by 
abortion." 
The little white crosses forced my gaze 
upon them as I continued walking down 
the sidewalk toward the gym. I tried 
unsuccessfully to tear my gaze and 
thoughts away. It was very unsettling to 
keep walking, and very disturbing. But 
that's the point. 
It was unrealistic to banish the words flashing across my mind, words that wept for the three aborted babies repre­sented by each cross. 
Props to the NO Right to Ufe Club for their em>rts in abortion awareness. If your intent was to hit individuals like myself with a ton of bricks in the stom­ach and to open our eyes to the statistical realities of abortion, you did a damn good job. I can honestly say that a club banner has never had as much impact on me as those crosses did on Tuesday. 
But, the question is, after the crosses have been removed from the green, will that scene still bear weight on my soul? And the honest answer is, probably not. But it should, and the answer to abortion laws in the United States will never be found until the scene of the somber little crosses stays on our minds every single day. 
We can take the easy route and con­vince ourselves tl1at abortion laws are out of our control, an issue handled by our political leaders. We can pause and reflect and for a moment see ourselves rallying to change these statistics, but then continue on our way hoping that someday someone else will be able to do this. 
That is the wrong attitude to have. 
We are the future leaders of this coun­try but we don't have to wait until we are sitting in an oval office for our voices to be heard. If any issue is going to be chal­lenged, our voices have to be persistent. Awareness of issues cannot be limited to one forum, one rally, one week. Our voic­es can be strong if we exercise our right to use them. Uke the little white crosses and the babies who lay beneath, I believe that our voices and actions founded by our passion for humanity, justice, and all that is good will change the world if we have persistence.

Engel discusses hit show­
,Saved by the Bell' producer speaks at ND 
By ]EN ROWLING News Writer 
Professionalism. perse­verance. and passion are the key qualities for a person to succeed in show business. a field where the next great thing is lurking around the cor­ner. said Peter Engel, pro­ducer of the hit television series, "Saved By the Bell." 
Engel spoke at Notre Dame Wednesday about his experiences in televi­sion production, including work on the shows "Hang Time," "The Last Comic Standing," "USA High," "California Dreams" and "City Guys." 
"If you don't love it, have a passion or zeal [for it]. you shouldn't be in it," Engel said. 
Engel discussed his nat­u raJ passion for stories and drama. which he believes is essential for success. 
"Everything l saw would trigger an idea," he said. 
According to Engel, ideas for production are inspired by reading and the passion to learn more about the world. 


Tb.u:Nd8i9t Ootobar , 
"Most movies come out of the 'New York Times,"' he said. "Learn more about your world, enlarge your vision." 
He stressed the need for perseverance and dis­cussed his early experi­ences at NBC. 
"No one is going to sweep you up," Engel explained. 
These qualities allowed Engel to produce the hit TV series, "Saved by the Bell," which aired for 11 years. 
"Every kid in 85 coun­tries knows Zacli, Screech and Kelly," he said. 
Engel attributed the show's success to the unique cast. 
"It was like lightning in a bottle -you only catch it once," he said. 
For the first time in tel­evision history, characters were being played by actors of the same ages. 
"The only thing the Middle East could agree on was "Saved by the Bell," Engel said. 
The producer also dis­cussed today's reality shows and the creativity he believes is lacking in many of them. 
"Television today has changed," Engel said. "I don't really like reality shows. I don't even like my own reality show -I don't find it creative. Scripted shows are about telling a story."

SENATE 

Students talk about ICEs 
By AMANDA MICHAELS Associate News Editor 

The long-debated subject of teacher course evaluations was again discussed at Wednesday's Student Senate meeting, as Alumni senator Vijay Ramanan, former stu­dent body president Jeremy Lao and stu­dent delegate to the Academic Council Jeremy Staley presented a Course Review Resource as a solution to the TCE problem. 
Three years in the making, the proposal sets forth a plan for a Web-based resource that provides both professor-provided infor­mation about courses -like syllabi and descriptions -and student feedback about classes. 
The student responses would be com­piled from a form handed out in addition to, but separate from. the normal TCE assess­ments. The collected data, in theory, would be posted on the official Web site so it could be viewed in conjunction with the objective facts about the courses. The distinction from official TCEs -used by administra­tion for tenure assessment, among other things -is aimed at alleviating faculty and administration concerns about publishing important and possibly sensitive informa­tion. 
"The idea is that you'll have access to course information like syllabi, reading lists and student feedback in a format that is more official than NDToday.com," Staley said, in reference to the popular online teacher evaluations not sanctioned by the University. "Students will have access to important, helpful information before they register for classes so they can make the best decisions." 
Staley added that the majority of Notre Dame's peer institutions already have simi­

Jar systems in place. 'There is such a great precedent with what other universities are doing," he said. 
The proposal was sent to the Office of the Provost Wednesday, though they are still early in the process, said Lao. 
"What we're looking for right now is stu­dent support to show us that they want this system," Lao said. "And in the future, if it is approved, we'll need student support to make sure it works effectively." 
Concerns about the proposal included the added time burden to the already lengthy TCE process, the honesty of student responses and the ease of access to the Web site for both students and professors. 
Ramanan said the hassle of a longer eval­uation could be a problem, but that the time needed to fill out one extra page of brief questions was relatively negligible. 
In response to the question of putting the survey online rather than physically includ­ing it with the TCEs, Ramanan said stu­dents were more likely to respond, and to respond honestly, ifthey were given time in class to do so. 
Because the proposal is in such a prelimi­nary stage, no official timetable has been worked out yet. Ramanan, however, said he hoped at least part of it would be up and running by next semester. 
"We want the most representative, com­plete and accurate assessment of courses," Ramanan said. "So we're going to approach this the right way, and take all the necessary steps to make sure it suc­ceeds." 
Senators responded favorably to the pro­posal, but cannot vote to approve it until next week's meeting.

Despite frequent communica­tion between the University and the government since, no con­crete reasons have been revealed to Ramadan or to Notre

While critics have accused the scholar of promoting militant Islam and anti-Semitism, sup­porters maintain he has always taken a moderate, respectful stance. 
For his own part, Ramadan expressed hope for a second chance.

Nobel Peace Prize announced Friday 
Associated Press 

OSLO, Norway -The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to someone in the Middle East three times, and the Middle East is still in flames. Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar got it in 1991, and is still under house arrest. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev won in 1990, then ordered a bloody crackdown in the Baltic Republics as he sought to save the Soviet Union from col­lapse. 
One of the big questions sur­rounding Friday's announce­ment of this year's prize is, will it go to those who tried to achieve peace, or to those who actually achieved it? 
Although there are plenty examples of the Nobel honor­ing a peace effort that became a spectacular failure, there have been clear-cut winners of this avidly watched 103­year-old international honor. 
Three prizes went to South Africans, and eventually apartheid gave way to a peaceful multiracial democra­cy. The 1996 prize was shared by East Timor independence and democracy activists Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo and Jose Ramos-Horta. and three years later East Timor was independent of Indonesia. 
"The East Timor people give us credit for their independ­ence. Maybe too much credit," said Geir Lundestad, the non­voting secretary of the awards committee. 
"Ramos-1-Iotra told me that no one (in foreign govern­ments) would even see them before the prize. He said he was sleeping in railroad sta­tions because they had no money. After the prize, they got in anywhere." 
The prize, awarded each October by a committee of prominent Norwegians in Oslo. often brings a rush of reaction and debate. praise and condemnation. joy and fury, delight and scorn. 
Many of the favorites among this year's record 194 nomi­nees are associated with efforts to curb weapons. of mass destruction, at a tinw when their threat seems more palpable than ever. But as Lundestad points out. thB Nobel is "not a magic wand that creates peace. It's a loud­speaker and microphone for the laureates. especially those who are Jesser known. It's a door opener." 
Sometimes it goes to house­hold names, like former President Jimmy Carter (2002). the Dalai Lama (1989). and sometimes to lesser known figures, among them Iranian human rights cam­paigner Shirin Ebadi (2003) and Joseph Hotblat and the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs (1995).

Ki\BUL, Afghanistan -Campaigning for 1\fghanistan 's first direct presidential elec­tion· ended with a burst of violence weanesday as attackers set off a bomb in a failed effort to kill interim Afghan leader Ilamid Karzai's vice presidential running­mate. 
Despite persistent violence, the United Nations declared this hard-luck nation ready for Saturday's vote, a historic experiment with d·emocracy after more than two decades of unrelenting ruin. from Soviet occupation to civil war to the repressive Taliban and the thunderous U.S. bombing campaign that ended their rule.

There were hopeful signs, meanwhile, that talks may produce a cease-ffre agreement with a Shiite militia headed by radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr-although residents of his stronghold Sadr City reported explosions in the area late Wednesday.

Bad weather hampers navy rescue 
Associated Press. 

LONDON -British ships battled through rough weather on Wednesday to reach a Canadian navy submarine with 57 crewmembers on board that was drifting in the Atlantic after an electrical fire that officials said was more severe than originally thought. 
A British frigate pulled alongside the HMCS Chicoutimi and dropped off medical staff to help treat crewmen who suffered from smoke inhalation. 
"This was a major fire" said Commodore Tyrone Pile, commander of the Canadian Atlantic Fleet, adding the fire damaged the com­manding officer's cabin and an elec­trical equipment room on a separate deck. 
The vessel -one of four second­hand subs that Canada recently pur­chased from Britain -was drifting in heavy seas toward Ireland and it was unlikely its engines could be used to steer the boat to shore, Pile said. 
The diesel-powered submarine, which was on its maiden voyage as a Canadian vessel, sent out a distress call Tuesday after an electrical fire broke out on board. Britain's Royal Air Force sent a search-and-rescue helicopter to the sub, some 115 miles northwest of Ireland. 
Nine of the 57 crewmembers suf­fered minor smoke inhalation, Canadian officials said. They did not need to be evacuated, and the vessel surfaced safely, although its engines were shut down as a precaution. 
The Chicoutimi, formerly called HMS Upholder, had been turned over to the Canadian navy on Saturday and was on its way from Britain to the Canadian port of Halifax. · 
Pile said the crew had sufficient provisions on board. 
"Well, they've got emergency light­ing on board, it is probably going to get a little bit cold, but they have suf­ficient blankets and other means to keep warm on board the submarine," Pile said.

Personal names for companie~ 
NEW YORK -In casting about for a name for their new companies or products, entre­preneurs often decide to use their own. 
And it can work -look at the success of Ben & Jerry's and Dell Inc. But before you order your new firm's letterhead, you should think about some of the ramifications -good and bad -of sharing your name with your company. 
Craig Newmark's business started as a hobby back in 1995, when he began e-mailing friends a list of "what I thought were cool events" in the San Francisco area. As the group of recipients grew. people started refer­ring to it as "Craig's list." 
When the hobby started turning into a busi­ness. Newmark thought of changing the name to sf-events. But he decided to make it craigslist -"if I call it that, it's going to stay personal and quirky." 
Newmark sees many pluses in having his name on craigslist. which has evolved into a Web site with real estate and job listings, per­sonal ads. chat rooms and other services in big cities across the country and in Britain, Ireland and Australia. 
Changes made at Robert Mondavi 
OAKVILLE, Calif. -With its famous Mission-style bell tower and elegant arched entrance, the Robe-rt Mondavi Winery looks every inch the Napa Valley landmark it has been for four decades. 
The company plans to sell the luxury side of the business. including the Robert Mondavi Winery in Oakville, and use the money to build its $15-and-under brands like Woodbridge, which face stiff competition from Australian imports and domestic brands like California's Two Buck Chuck. 
Mondavi company officials cast the sale as a chance to put the luxury business back in pri­vate hands and away from shareholders' short-term expectations. They believe there's more room for growth in the cheaper, high­volume "lifestyle" brands and expect to realize $400 million to $500 million from the sale, which would be used to develop the lifestyle business.

Oil prices climb to new high 
Stocks rally late Wednesday despite predictions of a poor third quarter 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Stocks enjoyed a late-day rally Wednesday, finishing high­er despite a new record price for oil and gloomy third-quarter outlooks from several companies. Volume was relatively light as investors awaited the gov­ernment's jobs creation report at the end of the 
.week. 

With rising energy costs threatening to dent con­sumer spending and corpo­rate profits in the period ahead, oil and jobs have competed for the attention of traders on Wall Street. Many were looking ahead to the Labor Department's September employment report. due Friday.

Turkey gets conditional approval for EU entry talks 
Associated Press 
BHUSSEL.'i. Belgium-In a his­toric move that could extend Europe's borders to the edge of the volatile Middle East, the European Union recommended Wednnsday setting mostly Muslim Turkey on a course lor full mem­bership in the prosperous 25­nation bloc. 
Hdlecting widespread misgiv­ings, however. the 30-member EU executive commission set tough conditions to prevent Turkey from backtracking on sweeping democratic and human rights reforms. 
"This is a qualified yes," said Europnan Commission President Homano Prodi. "Our position is a positive one. but also a prudent, cautious one." 
French President Jacques Chirac said talks with Turkey could last 10-15 years "at a mini­mum." 
Such caution rellected unease throughout a prosperous and mostly Christian continent about union with a poorer Muslim nation that could be a source of unwelcome migrants. Europeans carry a deep historical memory of the Ottoman Empire, out of which Turkey was formed after World War I. as a hostile power that once ruled swaths of Europe to the gat!~s of Vienna, Austria, and Jell bnhind a legacy of corruption.

Campaigns exchange barbs over VP debate 
Bush continues Cheney's debate criticism 
Associated Press 
CLEVElAND-President Bush offered a sharp if familiar critique of his rivals on Wednesday. picking up where Dick Cheney left off in the vice presidential debate while defending the war in Iraq and their economic policies. Democratic vice presidential candidate John Edwards was poised to answer the criti­cism in the battleground state of Florida. 
"In less than a month you'll have a chance to vote for Dick Cheney and me," Bush told cheering supporters in Wilkes­Barre. Pa. ''I'm looking forward to com­ing down the stretch with a positive, strong message." 
Bush assailed Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry as he usually does in campaign appearances, accusing the Massachusetts senator of wavering in his support of the war on terrorism, favoring scores of tax increases, and sending mixed signals to allies and ene­mies. 
Bush even offered an explanation for thr scowls and grimaces he displayed during the presidential debate last week in Miami when Kerry criticized nearly every action the president has taken on national security, taxes, education and health care. 
"You hear all that'you can understand why somebody would make a face," the president said. 
Bush and Kerry meet again Friday night at Washington University in St. Louis to take questions from voters. In the vice presidential debate Tuesday night in Cleveland, Cheney and Edwards traded jabs over jobs, judgment and Iraq in what largely was a hard-fought draw. 
"America saw two very different visions of our country and two different hairdos," Bush said to laughter. "I didn't pick my vice president for his hairdo, I picked him for his judgment, his experi­ence." 
Cheney and Edwards headed for Florida, a battleground worth 27 elec­toral votes. Cheney was appearing in Tallahassee, Edwards in West Palm Beach. 
The Bush camp claimed that a strong performance by Cheney helped break momentum that appeared to be going Kerry's way, but Democrats said Edwards more than held his own. 
"I thought it was another win for the Kerry-Edwards team. I thought John Edwards showed real strength, convic­tion. he was in command of all the facts, in control of the debate," Democratic Party chairman Terry McAuliffe told AP Radio on Wednesday. "I think the bur­den was on Dick Cheney to try and knock it out of the park. He did not do that." 

Post-debate polls were split. Cheney fared best in an ABC News poll of a 
Republican-leaning group of registered voters who watched the debate, with 43 percent giving Cheney the edge, while 35 percent said Edwards won. The Democrat was viewed more positively by 178 undecided voters polled by CBS News: 41 percent thought he had won and 28 percent thought Cheney had won. 
The candidates, seated at a table with­in a few feet of each other at Case Western Reserve University, tore into each other repeatedly. Cheney, an expe­rienced debater, and Edwards, a fresh­man senator from North Carolina who made millions of dollars as a trial lawyer, gave as well as they took. 
Edwards responds to Bush's critiques 

Associated Press 

·wEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -Sen. John Edwards, answering President Bush's blistering criticism of Democrat John Kerry, contended Wednesday that the Republican was "completely out of touch with reality" about the Iraq war and the economy. 
"He won't acknowledge the mess in Iraq. All you have to do is turn your tele­
vision on," Edwards said. "They still don't recognize that there's any problem with jobs and the economy" despite rising health care costs and record job losses. 
"You can't fix these problems until you recognize there is a problem," the Democratic vice presidential candidate told a sign-waving audience in a ware­house at the Palm Beach County conven­tion center. "They're in denial. They're in denial about everything." 
Earlier, in a speech in Pennsylvania, Bush accused Kerry of waffling in his position on the war on terrorism, pushing for higher taxes, and sending mixed sig­nals to allies and enemies. 
"In the war on terror, Senator Kerry is proposing policies and doctrines that would weaken America and make the world more dangerous," Bush said. On the economy, he added, "My opponent is a tax-and-spend liberal; I'm a compas­sionate conservative." 
Edwards responded to Bush's critical assessment of Kerry while the Massachusetts senator stayed off the campaign trail to prepare for his second debate with Bush on Friday in St. Louis. 
The North Carolina senator said that after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks Bush chose to "divert the attention to Iraq" instead of "finishing the job of killing the man who masterminded the attacks," Osama bin Laden. 
"These are the men who think their experience and value is so important for the American people," Edwards said. 
Noting that the Bush's advisers had billed Bush's speech as a major address on foreign policy and the economy, Edwards said: "The problem is, of course, when you got the same old tired ideas, the same old false attacks, the same old tired rhetoric, there are no new. ideas. There are no new plans." 
"This president is completely out of touch with reality and it showed again in his speech today," Edwards said. 
Steve Schmidt, a Bush spokesman, countered, "Their defeatist rhetoric is not consistent with the reality on the ground in Iraq." 
The No. 2 on the Democratic ticket made a beeline for hurricane-ravaged south Florida a day after debating Vice President Dick Cheney in Cleveland. Cheney was campaigning in Tallahassee in the northern part of the state that put President Bush and him in the White House in the disputed election four years ago. 
In West Palm Beach, Edwards said that Cheney "struggled with the truth" during the debate on several issues, including when the Republican denied linking Saddam Hussein with the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. 
Asked who won the debate, Edwards told reporters "the American people" because they saw clear contrasts between both tickets. 
The senator was heading to Greensboro, N.C., later Wednesday before traveling to New York City for television interviews Thursday on "Live With Regis And Kelly" and "The View."

The power to 'declare' war 
"I faced the kind of decision that comes only to the Oval Oflice," said President Bush. "Do I forget the lessons of SeptPmber 11th ... or do I take action to defend our coun­try? Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time." 
Campaign rhetoric on both sides 

Charles E. Rice
implies that the decision for war or peace belongs to one man -the President. The framers of the Right or Wrong? Constitution saw it differently. On August 17, 1787, they debated whether to give Congress the power to "make war." James Madison and Elbridge Gerry successfully "moved to insert 'declare,' striking out 'make' war; leaving to the Executive the power to repel sudden attacks." Roger Sherman said, "The Executive [should] be able to repel and not to com­mence war." They left what Justice Robert Jackson called "a zone of twilight,'' with concurrent powers in the President and Congress. The balance is hard to strike. 
The War Powers Resolution of 1973, for example, imposed probably unconstitutional time limits on the President's use of force. Presidents have put forces into combat more than 200 times. Congress has declared war only five times. The last time Congress debated and decid­ed whether to go to war was in 1917. 
The President takes an oath to "preserve, protect and defend" the Constitution, while other officers swear only to "support" it. Presidents usually seek Congressional approval before major military action. But no President has admitted that he must do so. 
President Clinton bombed Serbia despite the refusal of the House to authorize it. In the Gulf War, the Afghanistan campaign and the Iraq War, Congress gave a blank check to the President. In 2002, Congress authorized him to use the armed forces "as he determines to be necessary and appropriate ... to defend ... the United States against the ... threat posed by Iraq." The Resolution of September 18, 2001, understandably did not even identify the enemy. It authorized the President "to use all necessary and appro­priate force against those nations, organizations or per­sons he determines planned, authorized, committed or ordered the ... attacks ... on September 11, 2001, or har­bored such organizations or persons." 
In the ongoing war against what the 9/11 Commission called "Islamist terrorism,'' who will decide, for example, whether to use force to prevent Iran from achieving nuclear capability? The citizen, lacking information, must give a benefit of the doubt to the justice and wisdom of a decision to use force, whether made by Congress or the President or both. Congress, however, has a duty to inform itself and to participate in, or perhaps control, decisions to initiate a major use of force. 
The President needs flexibility to fulfill his duty of defense. But if Congress continues its habit of authorizing the President to use force as he thinks it "necessary and appropriate,'' Congress may find itself reduced to a merely advisory and funding role. Can there be a situation today in which Congress must go beyond authorization and must itself decide whether to use military force? Was House Speaker Thomas Foley right when he said the Gulf War resolution had "the moral legal, constitutional, prac­tical consequences of a declaration of war"? Maybe the best we can do is the current pattern of ad hoc coopera­tion. But the issue compels attention in light of the current expansive concept of defense. 
"The wisest use of American strength," said President 

lETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Rebuilding Ratzinger 
Professor Kristin Shrader-Frechette's column, Science Watch, published last Friday both contained a large number of errors regarding the teachings of the Catholic Church and promoted a shallow understanding of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger's statements on Catholic voting. 
First. to state that John Kerry stands with Catholic doctrine 80 percent of the time and George Bush 20 percent of the time assumes that all issues of Catholic doctrine are equal in weight. Cardinal Ratzinger made clear in his statement regarding voting that "Not all moral issues have the same moral weight as abortion and euthanasia." Ratzinger argued that issues such as the waging of war may warrant "diversity of opinion even among Catholics," but that such diversity is not possible "with regard to abortion and euthanasia." Furthermore, John Kerry has made it clear that while he personally considers himself a Catholic he does hot believe in forcing his views upon peoples of other religions. One must then conclude that although Kerry advocates some positions that are in line with Catholic doctrine, he does so not out of faith and right reasoning, but by the use of his individual conscience. Can a rational Catholic voter then really place his trust in this sta­tistie knowing that Kerry is not guided by the Church, but only by himself? 
Professor Shrader-Frechette writes, "Catholic doctrine requires the primacy of conscience. It requires informing one's conscience but prohibits ever violating it." To use this statement in the context that the professor does is a misunderstanding of what this doctrine states. The Catholic Chureh has always defined an informed con­science as being one informed by the doctrines of the Catholic Church. The Catechism of the Catholic Church clearly states that a conscience not informed in this way can be erroneous in judgment. According to Church teaching, the belief that personal conscience overrules Church teaching is a heresy. Indeed, rule-following has never dominated Catholic morality, only the recognition that to define good and evil based on individual conceptions is not to truly love God, whom we know through communion with Christ's Church, but rather is to worship a god invented by man. 
Finally, Professor Schrader-Frechette ignores the arguments set forth by Pope John Paul II in his Gospel of Life that in order to take any of the life issues seriously, one must first respect life in the womb. If one cannot respect life at conception, how can one begin to defend life issues such as welfare and pollution rights? Perhaps this is why Professor Schrader-Frechette is able to make a utilitar­ian argument at the end of her piece, "One million three-hundred thousand U.S. abortions are a tragedy. But so are the slow deaths of 18 million U.S. children. And the 1 million deaths of children in developing nations," that implies the lives of 19 million children are more valuable than 1.3 million children with relative ease. Catholic doctrine asserts the value and dignity of every individual. Putting forth arguments such as the ones found in Science Watch will not help to create a culture of life, but will plunge us even fur­ther into the culture of death. 
Christopher Brophy junior Keenan Hall Ocr. 4 
Bush, "is to advance freedom." He sees the liberation of Iraq as "a watershed event in the global democratic revo­lution." He views "our commitment to the global expan­sion of democracy" and specifically our helping Iraq to build a "democratic country in the heart of the Middle East" as a way to "defend our people from danger." To prevent "rogue states" from acquiring weapons of mass destruction, he pledges, "we will not hesitate to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by acting preemptively." 
This new doctrine of seeking security by advancing a "global democratic revolution" and by preemptive military action to prevent presidentially defmed "rogue states" from getting WMDs is a presidential creation. And it is light years removed from the framers' quaint idea of "leaving to the Executive the power to repel sudden attacks." 
These remarks are not intended to focus criticism on President Bush, for whom I will vote. And Senator Kerry's multiple positions are no less dubious. The point is that, whoever is elected, it ought to be agreed that the decision to initiate major conflict, including separate phases of the "war on terror,'' must involve seriously the elected repre­sentatives of the people who will fight that war. Elbridge Gerry was from Massachusetts. But he still got it right when he said he "never expected to hear in a republic a motion to empower the Executive alone to declare war."

With much interest I read the Oct. 4 story about the demonstration of the students with orange armbands, the purpose of which was to contest "Notre Dame's No. 1 Princeton Review ranking for intolerance of 'alternative lifestyles."' The beginning was really promis­ing. I thought that possibly I would find a real openness to a variety of lifestyles, such as celibacy for the Kingdom of God; or complete self-denial for the sake of the poor; or virgini­ty until marriage and full fidelity after the wedding; or perhaps a life dedicated to pro­mote justice among the rich and the poor without love for tyrants; or even a manage­ment career that, against the stream of biological reasons such as race is a monstrosi­ty. 
Homosexual behavior, however, is not a bio­logical fact. One can accept that probably a small percentage of homosexual people have a biological root of their drives. But a sexual drive or desire is not an action. Married and unmarried people feel sexual desire towards persons that are not the legitimate spouse. But, we are not mere animals, utterly unable to control our passions. To indulge in such desire is, thus, for anyone, a sin. 
What Catholic faith teaches is that sexual pleasure is ordered toward procreation, and procreation must take place within an

spaces that should be shrines of alterna­tive thinking. The curious thing is that it is doing so under the banner of "tolerance." Judges, the press, and liberal colleges are denying to Catholics and other minorities the right to organize themselves in health institu­tions -to live according to their Faith-and in educational or Academic institutions -to fully understand their Faith and propagate it. The argument is that life in society has demands that cannot be overlooked for rea­sons that are proper of a particular group. "Public order" demands a complete submis­sion of every minority. "Tolerance" would be, thus, a requirement of public order. 
According to liberal ideologues, Catholics have to accept homosexuality as a "normal" way of life. Why? This is not clear, but the issue is compared with the acceptance of the civil rights of the African-Americans. Here you have a complete confusion of every juridi­cal or ethical concept. To "discriminate" means to give unequal treatment for reasons that are not relevant. To deny civil rights for 
This is not only a matter of Faith. It is also a matter of natural reason. Indeed, one can find very nearly the doctrine of the Church in a passage in Plato, a man who especially in his old age was able to stick to the truth of reason amidst a very corrupted society: Laws, VIII, 838 ff. To exclude "homo­sexual marriage" is not discrimination because "marriage" is an institution that is intrinsically ordered to procreation. Some people might not agree with this. It is a tradi­tion proper of the Western world, however, that political power does not control the spir­it, represented by the Church and by universi­ties. Thus, even if the general corruption of society leads to the acceptance of giving the label of "marriage" to homosexual unions, the traditional freedom and tolerance of the Western world should allow institutions of the spirit to disagree with the state of affairs.

Third time not a charm for Ben Folds 
By JULIE BENDER 
Scene Music Criric 
No matter how the music scene changes, Ben Folds continup,s to remain a presence just bnlow the surface of mainstream popularity. I lis brand of piano pop combined with witty lyrils nnver fhlls to charm. and his stage pres­ence is akin to what a Bruce Springsteen live show would be on piano. lli'i energy and stam­ina i1,rnite his pimto, and the audience fhlls right in step with Folds until he finally packs it in and leaves the stage. 
We haven't seen a tiill-length release from Folds since 2002's "Ben Folds Live" -17 tracks of Folds and his traveling piano. 2003 brought us two live-song EPs. "Sunny 16" and "Sp!~ed Graphic." neither of which is his best work. but both have superb moments of Folds' trademark balladeering. These two EPs con­tinued Folds' musical theme used on the tour fhnn which "Ben Folds live" was recorded ­no other instrumentation beyond vocals and piano. 

Speaking on his Web site about his decision to release his latest music via the Internet and on five-song EPs. Folds said, "Part ofme thinks I'm an idiot for 'wasting' this recording on lim­ited release [EP's], but I'm really into this method of recording and releasing quickly and making it all about music." 
Folds has certainly proved he's "all about music" by continuing to tour and release songs just below the radar of radio and M1V And now Folds has done it yet again with the third and final release in his EP trilogy, "Super D." 
Unlike the other EPs' "strictly piano" sound. "Super D" ventures into a new musical arena. Piano still remains at the forefront, but Folds includes drums, horns and even strings on many of the tracks. Despite these additions, however, the ending result is not up to the quality of work most fans are used to with Folds. 
The first song on the EP is a cover of The Darkness' "Get Your Hands Off My Woman." Folds slips into an angry falsetto during the chorus of this song, singing with venom not heard since "Song for the Dumped," released when Folds was still with his trio, Ben Folds Five. The song is "heavy metal on piano," as Folds describes it on his Web site, and the result is a somewhat startling rejection of his former piano pop sound, but will make a great live tune for shows. 

"Kalamazoo" and "Adelaide" are two of the weakest songs on the EP. "Kalamazoo" is a song Folds formerly used on demo tapes. Here it is reworked in what starts as a meandering lounge number that slowly increases tempo, adding drums, bass and strings. "Adelaide" uses spinning piano and a thumping beat that stay in sync with the vocal track. Despite the catchiness of the chorus, the song fails to make an impression. 
"Rent a Cop" is the one song on the album where Folds showcases the wit and talent that mark his previous albums. Proving no one is safe from Folds' sharp scrutiny, the song humorously thumps along to a supposedly true 



Green Day releases political 'rock opera' 
By MICHELE JEFFERS 
Scene Music Critic 
Om of tho most notnworthy as(JI~Cl'i of the eampai~-,rn trail thi'i election season lies with tlw 1~agerrwss of rock musicians to step up and voice their political opinions through albums and concert tours. 
(;men Day, a band that has mmainnd at thn fi>rdi'<mt of the altcrnatiw music scene since the mid-YO's. has aL'io taken it'i turn at the political microphone. Four years since the n~InasP of their last full-length album. the mnrnbl~rs of Grcnn Day went to the fi)Cording studio with a renewed alacrity and a clear intention of fully exercising their First Anwndmont right. The band's deep frustra­tions and <mger with the BtL'ih administration and the Iraq War inspired them to create something different and explore another dinumsion of their talents. 'llms, in thn vein of Pink Floyd's "The Wall" and The Who's 'Tommy," the band has written "American Idiot" as a "rock opera." It is always a risk for an establi'ihed band to step outside the line, but Green Day upheld passion and sincerity over playing it safe. In an MTV interview Billie Joe stated, "I think the problem vvith a lot of rock bands or pop groups or whatever is that they're so afraid of damaging their precious careers. For me, I think it is something that can enrich mine: 'Yeah, I supported thL'i. This meant a lot to me."' 

The album wastes no time getting to the point, and opens with "American Idiot." The song's catchiness and ability to stand-alone has contributed to its wide spread radio play. However, it serves as an effective prologue to the rest for the album, hooking the listener into it with its barb towards the general igno­rance that results from mindlP.ss allegiance to the media. 
The second track. "Jesus of Suburbia," is a nine-minute opus, conta.ining five cohesively transitioned parts. It is here that the protago-nist of the opera identifies himself: "The Son of Rage and Love I The Jesus of Suburbia." This self-identity is continuously being developed throughout the album. 

The most polemical track on "American Idiot" is definitely "Holiday." Armstrong's tal­ent for songwriting is blazoned through the song's powerful lyrics: "Zieg heil to the President Gasman I Bombs away is your pun­ishment I Pulverize the Eiffel Towers I who criticize your government." While these lyrics vilify President Bush as a cruel despot, it is the protagonist who feels that he bears unjust censure just because "[IIe) beg[s) to dream and differ from the hollow lies." 
"American Idiot" lowers the intensity with slower songs like "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" and "Give Me Novacaine." "Wake Me Up When September Ends" is a beautiful ballad written by Annstrong in response to his father's death. It creates a sentimental moment of repose to reflect on "Becoming who we are I As my memory rests I But never forgets what I lost." Coming full circle, the sec-story of a greasy mall security guard: 'Til be hanging at the check out I 01ecking out your girlfriend I Figure out how she's going to lit all of that I Butt into that underwear -yeah," sings Folds, tongue in cheek. ofcourse. 
The closing song on the EP is a tributP to the late Ray 01arles. In an effort to "tip the hat to the man," Folds covers 01arles' song, 'Them That Got." Romping piano marks the charm­ing little number recorded live in a perform­ance from two years ago. "I don't know the whole thing, but I like it," says Folds as tho final chord trails off amidst cheering. 
Although Folds has good moments on Suptw D-especially with the last two tracks-over­all, the EP does not live up to expectations cre­ated from other work in his musical repertoire. Nonetheless, it's a nice complement to the other EPs in the trilogy. and reveals the direc­tion Folds may be heading with his next full­length album, due out in 2005. 
Contact Julie Bender at jbender@nd.edu. 


ond to last song is another five-part opus called "Homecoming." 
It is a ditncult task to adequately describe Green Day's latest venture because each song is made richer through the operatic charac­ter's odyssey through faith, disillusionment and even acceptance. "American Idiot" does have a specific political message and is proba­bly not for those who can not stomach a sidl) of liberalism witl1 thdr Cheerios, but regard­less of one's political leanings, the album can resonate with anyone who feels that the stall~ of things, internally and externally, are not quite right. In 16 years this is Green Day's only album to debut at No. 1, showing that risky decisions can also be the smartest. In fact. Green Day is in thn initial planning stages of turning this concept album into a full-length 
Jilm. Gmen Day will be on tour this !all with New Found Glory and Sugarcult.

Interpol trumps lofty expectations 
By MATTHEW L. SOLARSKI 
Scene Music Critic 
New York City's favorite sons have returned at long last with what is by far the most anticipated indie release of 2004. Make no mistake: "Antics," the follow-up to 2002's milestone debut, "Turn On The Bright Lights," proves itself every bit as scintillating, inspired, and mystifying as its esteemed predecessor. 
The new album opens with some of the warmest electric organ chords this side of Procol Harum's "A Whiter Shade of Pale." On this introductory track, entitled "Next Exit," lead vocalist Paul Banks delivers an ode to his beloved home city, proclaiming his hopeful 
Antics 
Interp:>l

intent to "make this place a heart I to be a part of I again." The song sets the mood for the remainder of the album, and one can almost see the night-lit city coming into focus on the horizon, as an approaching car and its sartorially-savvy occu­pants, brimming with all the promise of a nascent Friday night, drift past the strobe lighting of the overpasses. On this fateful night, however, sumething sinister lingers upon the air of the great city. 
"Evil" immedia~ely follows, ostensibly a love song, but darker undertones emerge in the final verse. It springs to life in much the same manner as "Obstacle 1" from Interpol's previous effort, as Banks advises with his trademark orotund delivery: "Leave some 
shards under the belly I lay some grease inside my hand I It's a sen­timental jury I And the makings of a go o d pI an . " T h e crime t h.e me carries through many of "Antics"' songs, manifested in such titles as "Narc," "Not Even Jail," and "Public Pervert" and in pithy, enigmatic lyrics. In "Slow Hands," a fast-paced standout, frantic gui­tar and bass dance about lines like "See the loving that surrounds me I dissipate in a violent haze" and finally, "We spies, intimate I Slow hands, killer." 
Both the new record and its pre­cursor exhibit a decidedly noctur­nal vibe. Where "Bright Lights" took listeners deep into the dying hours of a long night, ultimately setting them adrift with the bril­liant "Leif Erikson," "Antics" her­alds the coming of a new night, rife with new adventure, new con­frontation, and new peril. The record concludes with a gorgeous new recording of a well-known B­side, "A Time To Be So Small." Like "Leif Erikson," this dark lull­aby resolves little and unsettles more than it lulls -a fitting finale for an album so keen on precarious mystery. 
The band manages, most uncan­nily, to put together music that strays considerably frqm comfort­able verse-chorus-verse conven­tions and abounds in cryptic, occasionally downright ominous, lyrical imagery. Yet all the same, 
one cannot help but find the sound endearing in much the same way as that of significantly more liter­al bands like the Cure and the Smiths. Interpol thrives upon dialectics like these, crafting songs, which are unconventional but somehow accessible, dark and yet simultaneously uplifting, pat­ternless and yet instantly memo­rable. 
Interpol boasts two secret weapons that are hardly secrets but certainly no less formidable for it: bassist Carlos D. and gui­tarist Daniel Kessler. The former lays out rhythms like so many rail ties, achieving at once the relent­less heart of John Henry and the taut, mechanistic precision of the steam drill. Carlos injects enough twists and turns into the track to provide the Interpolocomotive ­brought to life by Kessler's crisp, chiming, evocative guitar lines ­with a diverse and altogether com­pelling journey across these dan­gerous, moon-drenched, sonic landscapes. 
"Antics" does not depart signifi­cantly from the distinct style established on "Turn On The Bright Lights." 
So then is it more of the same? Perhaps, but when the same is this good, one can never quite have enough.

Stone releases soulful second album 

By BECCA SAUNDERS 
Assistant Scene Editor 
ThP title pretty much says it all as far as the mood and direction of Joss Stone's newest album, "Mind Body & Soul." 
Stone's second album is not a huge deviation from the tones of her first album, "The Soul Sessions," which just became popu­lar early this year. The music is generally soft with some upbeat tracks. but through it all Stone's strong voice is wonderfully compli­mented and showcased. 
Stone said that. "For me, person­ally. 'Mind Body & Snul' is my real debut album." Stone co-wrote 11 of the 14 tracks on "Mind Body & Soul." and the maturity of her voice is abundantly apparent. Whether a fast track or a slow melodic tune, Stone's voice penetrates the ear of any listener, proving there are truly talented female musicians who are actually popular and selling records. There is something almost indescribable about Stone's voice; it is powerful and addictive. She seems to sense the exact moments to go soft, fast or any direction it allows. The voice of Stone is the most exciting part of "Mind Body & Soul" an-d is simply addictive. 

The songs on "Mind Body & Soul" are also generally interesting and memorable. While there are fast and slow songs with hints of differ­ent levels of blues, jazz and pop that surface in the songs on the album, more variety in song genre would make for a stronger album. Stone is a terrific musician who is immensely talented, but as one lis­tens to the album, many of the songs have a very similar sound. On the other hand, that sound is terrif­
ic. As such, the strength of the 

album is apparent, but as one lis­tens to the addictive voice of Joss Stone, it is inevitably thought that it would be nice to see all that her voice could do in songs that are more different from one another. 
One of the catchiest faster songs is "Don't Cha Wanna Ride," with a soft yet quick beat supporting its playful lyrics. Stone sings, "I know you got the Hummer for the sum­mer, baby I But I got your number, baby I I got your number ... A car this fine don't pass your way every day I Don't cha wanna ride, baby?" While the lyrics are less than impressive, the song itself is fun and memorable. A softer song is found in "Jet Lag," with hints of an almost reggae beat that is appeal­ing to any listener looking for a softer yet funky kind of beat. 

There are not necessarily any classic tracks on "Mind Body & Soul," but there are not any that are especially bad either. They all generally flow into each other. mak­ing Joss Stone's "Mind Body & Soul" a terrific album to have playing in the background of any chill scene. Overall, the album is good music with a strong voice singing lyrics that are questionable in quality. All the shortcomings are made up for by Stone's addictively smooth yet strong voice. "Mind Body & Soul" may fall into the category of back­ground music, but Stone's voice and the future of her career certainly do not and will not.

Rodriguez leads Yankees to comeback win 
"This team never gives up," 
Rodriguez said. "When we fell 
behind in the 12th, we felt like 
there was a window of opportu­
nity with Nathan going out for 
his third inning. If we can just 
get some guys on, we can tie it or 
win it." 

Sheffield was intentionally 
walked before J.C. Homero 
replaced Nathan. 

With the outfield drawn-in, Matsui hit a liner directly at right fielder Jacque Jones that appeared to be too shallow to score Jeter from third. 
But Jeter took oft' for the plate, and Jones' throw didn't have much on it. First ba$eman Matthew LeCroy, who entered as a pinch-hitter in the 10th, relayed the ball to the plate, but Jeter slid in safely. 
"I didn't care, I was going no matter what," Jeter said. "Sometimes you have to force guys to make plays." 
Astros 9, Braves 3 

The Houston Astros opened this postseason without a bit of concern about the past. 
No wonder. 

They had Roger Clemens on the mound and a powerful lineup that took the burden off the Killer B's. 
Picking up where they left off in the regular season, the wild­card Astros routed NL East champion Atlanta in Game 1 of the NL division playoffs -a major step toward winning their first postseason series. · 
Clemens continually pitched out of trouble against the Braves, while Brad Ausmus, Lance Berkman, Carlos Beltran and Jason Lane homered for the Astros, who set a franchise record for runs in a post$eason game. 
"I don't think we'll look back," Clemens said. "There's such a dii'ferent cast of characters on this ballclub." 
The Astros are 0-for-7 in the postseason, losing three of their last four series to the Braves. Much of the blame fell on Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell :....-the heart of the "Killer B's" for more than a decade. 
Bagwell finally came through with his first postseason extra­base hit, an RBI double tHat put the Astros ahead for good , in the third inning. But he and Biggio played a secondary role in beat­ing the NL East champion Braves. who hardly looked like a team that won its 13th straight division title. 
"I enjoy being a part of the offense," said Bagwell, who came in with a career playoff average of .174. "But this it not about me and my postseason struggles." 
The Astros carried over their 
momentum from the regular 
season, which they closed by 
winning 36 of 46 games to claim 
an improbable wild card. 
"You don"t play like we did the 
last month and a half without 
team being a capital "T," said 
Biggio, a .130 postseason hitter 
coming into the series. 
"Everybody contributed." 
Game 2 is Thursday at Turner Field, with Houston sending 20­game winner Roy Oswalt to the mound against Mike Hampton. If the visitors win again, they"ll have two chances to wrap up the series at Minute Maid Park. where Houston has an 18-game winning streak. 
The Astros trailed 1-0 when 
Ausmus led oft' the third with the 
first of Houston's three homers 
off Jaret Wright, sparking a four­
run inning. Bagwell's RBI double 
was followed by Berkman's two­
run homer into the Braves 
bullpen. 
Beltran knocked out Wright in the fifth with another two-run homer. 
Clemens showed the effects of a stomach virus that kept him from making his last start of the regular season. The Hall of Farner-to-be walked six -all in the first four innings and the most he's given up in a game since 1998. 
But Clemens displayed plenty of grit in winning a Game 1 start for the first time in his storied career. The Braves stranded nine runners in the first four innings. 
''I'm going to be a little hard­headed and pitch to my spots," Clemens said. 
Red Sox 8, Angels 3 
Pedro Martinez did his part, the bullpen did theirs and now the Boston Red Sox arc heading home with a big lead in the AL playofts. 
Martinez rebounded from a wretched September by pitching seven effective innings and Manny Ramirez hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly that sent the wild­card Red Sox over the Anaheim Angels for a 2-0 edge. 
With two wins at Angel Stadium, the Red Sox will try to sweep the best-of-five matchup on Friday at Fenway Park. Bronson Arroyo can put Boston back in the AL championship series when he starts against Kelvim Escobar. 
Angels reliever Francisco Rodriguez, who won a record­tying five postseason games two years ago to help Anaheim win the World Series, threw a wild pitch that set up Ramirez's sacri­fice fly in the seventh for a 4-3 lead. 
Boston broke it open in the 

ninth. Ramirez doubled, Trot 
Nixon hit an HBI single and 
Orlando Cabrera lined a three­
run double off Brendan Donnelly. 
Martinez lost his final four 
starts last month. But a day al'ter 
Curt Schilling won with 6 2-3 
innings, Martinez went even a bit 
longer. 

He gave up three runs and six 
hits, striking out six and walking

batters and left after 116 pitches. 
Mike Timlin took over in the 
eighth with a one-run lead. gave

struck out Vladimir Guerrero. 

Red Sox manager Terry 
Francona then summoned Mike 
Myers. who struck out Garret 
Anderson. Next up, Keith Foulke 
relieved and fanned Troy Glaus 
to end the inning. 

Foulke finished up in the ninth 
for a save. 

Rally Monkeys were every­

on the scoreboard and in the 
stands. But the Angels couldn't 
score after the Bed Sox took the 
lead.

third. Ramirez then fli1~d to cr,n­
ter, easily deep enough to scorP 
Damon. 

Rodriguez threw another wild pitch in the eighth, putting run­ners at second and third with two outs. But he retired Damon on a grounder to end the inning. 
Guerrero's first postseason hit -a two-run single with one out in the fifth -put the Angds on top 3-1. Anderson followed with a liner that first baseman Kevin Millar caught before stepping on the bag for an inning-ending double play. 
The Red Sox tied it in the sixth 
on Jason Varitek's two-run 
homer aftr,r a two-out single by 
Millar. Varitck struck out in his 
previous two at-bats against 
Bartolo Colon. 

The Hed Sox took a 1-0 lead in the second when Hamirez drew a two-out, bases-loaded walk ofT Colon. It could have been worsP for the Angels, but with David Ortiz batting and the bases still loaded, catcher Jose Molina picked oil' Bellhorn at second. 
The Angels tied it in their half on an HBI single by rookie Dallas McPherson before Martinez pitched out of a two-on, no-out jam. 
Colon allowed seven hits and three runs in six innings while walking three and striking out three. He threw 114 pitches. 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -The New York Yankees waited all season for that huge hit from Alex Hodriguez. 
Boy, did he deliver just in time. 
Hodriguez hit a tying double in the 12th inning, then Derek Jeter dashed home on llideki Matsui's sacrifice fly and the Yankees bailed out Mariano Hivera with another improbable postseason comeback, beating Minnesota 7­6 to even their series at a game apiece. 
"Alex had a little trouble set­tling in here, but when you do this at Yankee Stadium in a post­season game. especially coming from behind. God only knows what it's going to do for him," New York manager Joe Torre said. "You couldn't get a bigger hit." 
After falling behind in the 12th on Torii Hunter's home run. the Yankees responded with a cham­pionship-caliber rally. No sur­prise, because New York set a major league record with 61 comeback wins during the regu­lar season. 
"We never doubted ourselves," Gary Shellield said. "We've done this all season. There's no reason to think we couldn't do it again." 
Con~y Koskie keyed the 'I\vins' eighth-inning comeback with a tying double against Hivera, who blew a save in the postseason for only the third time in 33 chances. 

Game 3 in the best-of-tive AL series will be Friday night at the Metrodome, with Kevin Brown starting for the Yankees against Carlos Silva. 
Jeter, Rodriguez and Sheffield homered earlier in this game, and it went to extra innings tied at 5. It stayed that way until Hunter against Tanyon Sturtze, who had worked 2 2-3 hitless innings to that point. 
But Joe Nathan was running out of gas. too. The 1\vins' closer had made 43 straight appear­ances without going more than one inning, but manager Ron Gardenhire sent him out for a season-high third inning in hopes of finishing it. 
"He was still throwing 94, 95, 96 mph," Gardenhire said. "It's a little disappointing. I probably left him out there too long. I did­n't like our options." 
After a strike, Nathan walked Miguel Cairo and Jeter on eight straight pitches with one out in the 12th, bringing up Hodriguez, who hit only .248 with runners in scoring position in his first sea­son with the Yankees. 
lie's making up for all that in October. A-Rod hit a ground-rule double to left-center on Nathan's 49th pitch, tying the score at 6 with his fourth hit of the game. It gave him three HB!s, and made him 6-for-10 in the series.

Playing, with God 

by Fr. Dan Parrish, CSC Director of Freshman Retreat Ei: Rector of Zahm Hall 
Touchdown: Notre Dame; getting an IM from your best friend; going to your first dorm dance; finally beating your roommate at NCAA2005 (isn't the Matchup Stick a great addition?); buying a Foodsales 'Za at 3 am; hanging out with God. 
If you made a list of the most fun things to do at ND, would you include time spent with God? Many people consider 'time spent with God' as serious, quiet, intense-anything but 'fun.' Maybe we should reconsider how we approach hanging out with God. 
In Matthew 18:2, Jesus says that unless you turn and become like children, you will not enter the Kingdom ofHeaven. What does it mean to become like children? After spending an afternoon with my nephew and niece, Ben and Emily, I can assure you that it involves a lot of imagination, simple games and just playing around. Everything children do becomes a game, and they do it over and over and over. Maybe that's what God wants of us adults too -to stop worrying about our lives, to stop stressing about our prayer and just be like children. 
I think our faith life, our journey with God, should be fun. We only get one shot at this life, so let's enjoy every minute as much as we can. A great dorm Mass should be like beating Stanford-by three TDs. Saying your nightly prayers should be like getting a phone call from a friend you haven't talked to in a long time. Here at Notre Dame there are many opportunities for us to move out of that serious, studious, hard-working mode and remember what it is like to play and goof around like we were kids again. There are also many ways that we can start looking at our relationship with God in those terms. The most important ingredient in having a more "fun" relationship with God is to surround ourselves with really good people, the kind who make you laugh every time you see them. Then find a way to incorporate God in whatever you are doing. 
Lucky for us that Campus Ministry also provides so many amazing ways to have fun with God. Our retreat programs are one of the best ways to start kickin' it with JC. Many retreats are offered throughout the year at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, and you will regret it if you never try one out. Currently, applications are being accepted for the Notre Dame Encounter (for all ND/SMC students) and the Freshman Retreat (for ND/SMC Freshmen). Go out on a limb and sign up for one of our retreats, or one of the many other programs Campus Ministry offers. You just might be surprised at how much fun you have.

SWIMMING 

Phelps entered in 6 events 
Olympian will swim in 25-meter pool 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Michael 
P.helps is attempting a racing 
schedule nearly as ambitious as 
what he did at the Olympics. 
But this time he won't be swim­
ming as far. 
Six weeks after winning six gold medals and two bronzes in Athens, the teenager will swim six events in a 25-rneter pool at the World Short Course Championships that begin Thursday. 
The whole world knew Phelps was chasing Mark Spitz' record of seven gold medals at the Olympics. lie just missed, but still left Greece as the biggest star of' the games. 
"He really put himself out there. lie made a statement and took a risk," Australian coach Leigh Nugent said. "He put him­self under enormous pressure. For someone to do that and come up with the goods shows what they're really made of." 
This week, Phelps isn't sure what he can accomplish. 
''I'm just going in and have fun," he said Wednesday. "Just having an opportunity to swim in front of our horne crowd is the most important thing. There's going to be a lot of good, screaming fans." 
Phelps met plenty of shrieking teenage girls during his post­Olympic "Swim With the Stars" tour. which took him around the country with fellow Olympians Ian Crocker and Lenny Krayzelburg. 
"Every single town we went to there's a standing ovation. tons of screaming fans. smiles on kids' faces. It's all been incredi­ble," he said. "Lenny said, 'It's kind of like aqua Beatles.'" 
Simply walking around became a diff'l~rent experience. 
"Sometimes people would give me looks or come up to me and ask. 'Are you Michael?"' he said. "They'd stop at that and I liked to joke, 'My name is Michael, what are you asking?"' 
This week, the local newspa­per is urging readers to call in and report any sightings of Phelps away from Conseco Fieldhouse, where temporary competition and warmup pools were built over the floor used by the NBA's Indiana Pacers. 


The 19-year-old from Baltimore smiled at the prospect of being gossip column fodder. 
''I'm here to swim," he said. "They can see me walking from my hotel and back to the hotel. That's about the only two things they'll see me doing.'' 
Teammate Amanda Beard, whose provocative layouts in men's magazines have caused a stir, noted Phelps is turning up in celebrity magazines. 
"I see this boy inside, his hot bod," she said, jabbing a blush­ing Phelps in the arm. "It does­n't happen in swimming very often. I hope it's not an every four years' thing." 
Coming so soon after the Olympics, Phelps acknowledged he's competing in the five-day meet mostly to support its first staging in the United States and plug the sport. 
"People think of swimming as a once every four years' sport," he said. "We swim every single

day and we compete in major meets every year and the rest of the public needs to see that.'' 
Phelps has limited experience in short course meets, having competed in his first one in 1999. "He did absolutely terri­ble," coach Bob Bowman said. 
But he was 6-for-6 at last year's short course World Cup in Melbourne, Australia, and just missed setting two world records. 
Phelps is entered in the 200­meter freestyle, 200 butterfly, 100, 200 and 400 individual medleys and 800 free relay. The pool is half the length of what he usually swims in, giving him less space to maneuver.

Simms replaced Johnson after 15 plays of Tampa Bay's 10-6 loss to Seattle on Sept.

"There's still time to do great things this season," Clayton said.

No problems for Sheffield 
Yankee did not know he used steroids 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Yankees star Gary Sheffield will not be penal­ized by the commissioner's office after his admission that he unknowingly used a cream two years ago that contained illegal steroids. 
Sports Illustrated reported in this week's issue that the New York outfielder was supplied a cream by BALCO, the California lab at the center of a federal probe into illegal steroids distri­bution. 
Sheffield said he applied the cream on his surgically repaired right knee in 2002. He was not told it contained an ille­gal steroid, the magazine said. 
Under baseball's labor deal, players with major league con­tracts were each tested once for steroids this season. A provision allows more frequent testing if used. another steroid called "the a joint management-labor panel clear" for two months, the net­of physicians finds "reaso_nable work reported Tuesday.

CLEVELAND -LeBron James had a good reason for missing practice Wednesday. He became a father. 
The Cavaliers star guard and his longtime girlfriend, a 19-year-old Akron woman, had a baby boy Wednesday. No other details were avail­able. 
James left the team's train­ing camp in Columbus to be with her and his new son. He was expected to rejoin the team Thursday as he prepares for his second NBA season. 
During the team's media day Monday at Gund Arena, James wouldn't comment when asked "if he were about to become a father. He has always been guarded about his private life. 
Fatherhood should fit James 
well. The reigning rookie of the year, who turns 20 in December, is most relaxed when he is among children. ·This summer, he donated money to refurbish basketball courts and youth community centers in Akron. He has also donated supplies to the city's 
schools. 
James·was raised as an only· 
child by his mother Gloria, 
who was estranged from 
James' father when he was a 
youngster 
"That's my main goal, to try 
and be a better father than 
the one I had," James told the 
Akron Beacon JournaL "I did­
n't know him. I didn't know 
the situation he was in." 
Another father figure in 
James' life, Eddie Jackson, is 
serving a three-year prison 
term for mortgage and mail 
fraud.

Thomas predicts Williams won't come back 
Associated Press 
DAVIE. Fla. -With running back lUcky Williams ready to n~vr.rse dirnrtions and come out of n~tinmwnt, his Former Miami Dolphins teammates were mixed in their reaction Wednesday. 
l>nl'ensivn nnd David Bowens said he would like to see Williams rPjoin the Dolphins, in part because they're 0-4. But Pro Bowl linebacker Zach Thomas said he doubted that help from Williams is on the way. 
"lin will not be playing for the Dolphins," Thomas predicted. "lie's got too many things with the fans and too much with the media. and that's the reason he ran· from it in the first place. lie wouldn't come back here." 
Thomas might be right. Gary Ostrow. an attorney who has n~presentnd Williams, said the 2002 NJiJ. rushing champion hopes to receive clearance from the league to play again before the Oct. 19 trade deadline so he can be dealt by Miami. 
Williams asked the NFI. for a lwaring to clarify his status fol­lowing reptHLted violations of the league drug program. The Dolphins say their understand­ing is·lw must serve a suspen­sion for tlw rest of this season. and the NFL has declined to comment. 
"It's very murky water. and Hicky has askr.d for a clarifica­tion," Ostrow said. "lie would like the option to play for anoth-· 
r.r team." 
Contributing to Williams' change of heart about playing was an arbitration ruling Sept. 24 that he must repay more than $S.6 million to the 

Dolphins for breaching his con­tract. There's also the $3.5 mil­lion salary he has done without while traveling the world. 
He's expressed an interest in playing for the Oakland Haiders. Their coach is Norv Turner. who was Williams' offensive coordinator during his two seasons in Miami. 
"The Haiders would fit Hicky's personality better anyway." Ostrow said. "But he may not have many options other than going back to the Dolphins. How many teams are going to have an interest in him other than Norv. who has a relationship with him?" 
Whether Miami would wel­come him back is uncertain. lie caused a lot of resentment by retiring in July, shortly before training camp. The Dolphins haven't won a game since he left. and at 0-4 they're off to their worst start in 38 years going into Sunday's game at New England. 
"It has been very difficult," coach Dave Wannstedt said. "The guy was 65 or 70 percent of our offense. I don't think we would have redone our whole offensive line and started from scratch if we knew we were going to have to start from scratch at the running back position." 
In the days following Williams' retirement, center Seth McKinney called it selfish and stupid. Williams in turn dis­paraged McKinney's blocking. Williams said players had no respect for Wannstedt, and even poked fun at the coach's mus­tache. Defensive tackle Larry Chester said Williams was act­ing like a bitter girlfriend and owed the team an apology. 


Given so much baggage, would the Dolphins embrace Williams' return? 
"There are really two lines of thought, and I'm kind .of debat­ing between the two," guard Taylor Whitley said. "You can either say, 'To heck with the guy. While we've been going 0-4 here. he's been out having a good time.' Or we can say, 'Hey, we need the help. Come on back."'

So Bowens would like to see Williams return, and he thinks some teammates feel tho same way. 
"At 4-0 it would be a different story than being 0-4," Bowens said. "If we were winning. I'm sure people would be a little bit more negative."

SANDY LANE BEACH, Barbados -Tiger Wooos married Swedish model Elin Nordegren at an exclu· sive resort in Barbados dur­ing a sunset ceremony that reportedly cost $1.5 million. 
The wedding, held in a white-netted pagoda deco· rated with red roses, took place Tuesday evening as the sun painted a spectacu· Jar array of colors across the sky. 
"Elin and Tiger want to keep this as a family thing," the bride's father, Thomas Nordegren, told The Associated Press by tele­phone from the resort. 'Tm sorry I can't give you any more information." 
Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley and Oprah Winfrey were among more than 120 guests seen by an Associated Press reporter perched on a hill overlook­ing the club house of the Sandy Lane resort and golf course, which went to extraordinary lengths to shield the ceremony from journalists. 
The Barbados Daily Nation quoted unidentified sources as saying that the event cost $1.5 million. Woods reportedly imported 500 red roses for the cere­mony. 
The rock group Hootie and the Blowfish per· formed, witnesses said. before fireworks lit the night along Barbados' west coast. The couple spent their wedding night on a yacht, which was named "Privacy." 
As the sun rose Wednesday, a rainbow arched over the yacht and the couple sailed ashore on a skiff. They were accompa· nied by the bride's identical twin sister, Josefin. 
Nordegren, 24, met Woods three years ago while she was the nanny to the children of Swedish golfer Jesper Parnevik. 
At .the ceremony, Nordegren wore an off. 

white sleeveless gown, according to the witnesses, while Woods, 28, wore a beige suit. 
Charles Barkley, second from right, arrives with Michael Jordan at the coun­try club of the luxury resort that hosted Tiger Woods' wedding. 
Woods' father, Earl, arrived at the resort about 3 p.m. in a silver Rolls­Royce. At the reception, he cried after giving a speech, the witnesses said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Earlier in the day, the couple appeared to be adhering to the tradition of not seeing each other before taking their vows.

IN BRIEF 
~ud!!e allows Furcal to play 
m pfayoffs 
MARIETTA, Ga. -Atlanta Braves shortstop Rafael Furcal was cleared Wednesday to play in the postseason despite a probation violation on a drunken-driving charge. 
The ruling came hours before the Braves opened their divisional play­off series with the Houston Astros. 
Furcal must remain in home con· finement for the rest of the season. He has to return to a hotel if on the road, Judge David Darden said. 
Darden sentenced Furcal to 21 days in jail to be followed by a 28· day in-house treatment program. The judge delayed the start of the sentence until the day after the Braves' season ends. 
Furcal also must blow into a portable breath-testing machine when called by a monitoring service affiliated with the probation depart­ment. The machine, hooked up to a cell phone and video camera, will relay the test results to officials. 
"Don't take it lightly," Darden said. "The court is concerned a second violation might indicate he has a problem with judgment with regard to alcohol." Cassell's agent says pointguard will report to camp 
MINNEAPOLIS -Sam Cassell and the Minnesota Timberwolves appar· ently are back on good terms. 
Cassell's agent said the point guard would report to practice Wednesday after skipping the team's media day and the first day of workouts. Cassell, 34, was unhappy about not getting a contract extension. 
Charles Tucker, Cassell's agent, said his client would be at the team's camp in Collegeville in time for an afternoon practice. 
Tucker wouldn't comment when asked if the Wolves did anything to address Cassell's unhappiness, other than to say Cassell "has a better understanding" of the team's plans for him iri the future. 
Cassell's contract calls for him to be paid $5.65 million this season and $6.1 million next season. 'BiJ! Dog_' still has some bite

After a season plagued by injuries and a bad attitude, Glenn Robinson recognized it was time to get seri­ous, get in shape and get ready to prove he still has some bite in his game. 
After only two days of training camp at Duke, Sixers coach Jim O'Brien has already singled him out as one of the team's standout play­ers. 
"I think sometimes when you have a guy that has had the type of career that Glenn has had, you've got to throw out certain years," O'Brien said. 
Last season was one to toss out as Robinson missed a career-high 39 games because of a league suspen­sion, sprained ankles and elbow sur­gery. He averaged 16.6 points.

As the postseason rapidly 
approaehPs, Badin (3-1) and 
Welsh Family (:{-0-l) an~ part of 
a group of tPams jockeying for 
tlw top spol<; in the Gold I .eague 
standings. 
"It's a n>ally, rPally dosP race," 
Badin captain and quarterback 
StPphaniP !Ieath said. "Them an~

and Wnlsh Family has just tlw 
onP tie. This game is really 
important for us." 
Tlw Whirlwinds will be looking 
to rebound from thfdr disappoint­
ing tie with lloward on Sunday. 
"We had a breakdown on 
Sunday and it was a reality check 
for us." W1dsh captain Mary

We need to improve on both 
sides of tlw ball." 
Badin fully expects that Welsh 
will eorn1~ prnpan>d to play. 
"They weren't happy with their 
last performance, so I know they 
are going to bring the int~>nsity," 
I Ieath said. 
H1~ath cites both the 
Whilrwinds' nxplosive offense 
and the team's stingy defense as 
reasons for concern. 
The Bullfrogs, however. will fall back on their potent aerial attack. Heath has developed quill> a rapport with Badin's sta­ble of talent11d receivers, particu­larly Erin Diminick and Meg Charlebois. 
Welsh will have its hands full trying to slow the Badin passing game. Both teams believe that defense will det~>rmine the out­com~> of tonight's game. 
"The key is defensive execu­tion," Prendergast said. "We know we have the tools. Wn have the athl;;ticism. We just need to executn. 
!Ieath feels the Badin defnnse must creatn turnovers and pre­vent the Welsh ofl'ensn from get­ting into a rhythm. Tlw captain is conlident lwr tnam can slow the Whirlwind attack and come out on top.

Both teams arc coming ofT sluggish ofl'ensive performances; the two tnarns combined for sevnn points in their gamns on Sunday. 
OfT Campus (0-4) will need to improve on both sides of the ball as they have suffered two lop­sidml defeats in a row. Captain Lauren Blum r11alizes h11r team's weaknesses. 
"Our team has reached a plateau," Blum said. "We need strongnr play on both sides of the ball to bn>ak through this week." 
Th11 tnam has struggled to find its stride in iL'i initial season. but Hlum !i~nls lwr team can build on its unity to win its first game tonight. Slw and receiver Megan Furman will be critical to spark­ing the n>eently struggling Off­Campus oll'ensn. 


RICHARD FRIEDMANfThe Observer A Lewis wide receiver evades a Lyons defender Sunday. The Chicks play Off-Campus tonight In the Gold League. 
Lewis (1-2-1) comes into the game striving for consistent play as it has had an up and down season. The Chicks are corning off a scoreless tie against a proven Lyons team on Sunday. Captain Sheila Dawes will look to continue to lead strong defensive play tonight against Off-Campus while quarterback Meg Bustin will look to jump-start a Chick offense that has scored only 19 total points in four games this season. 
A low scoring defensive slugfest is to be expected tonight as two hungry teams with disap­pointing records look to earn a much-needed win. 
Pangborn vs. Howard 
Tonight's interhall matchup between Pangborn and Howard pits two teams who have recently regained respectability among the women's interhall ranks. 
After four years of futility in which the Phoxes won just one game, Pangborn has reasserted itself into the women's interhall mix with a 26-0 victory over defending champion Badin and a 14-7 upset of Lewis, last year's runner up. These wins give the Phoxes a 2-1 record, putting them in good position to make a playoff run. 
The Ducks of lloward have had similar troubles of late. beginning the season with two shutout loss­es and an 0-3 record. With a game against top-ranked Welsh Family looming, a fourth straight loss seemed inevitable, but the resilient Ducks played the No. 1 team to a 13-13 tie on the strength of a last-minute goal line stand. 
With these impressive perform­ances behind them, both teams have newfound confidence in their abilities and a bright out­look on their seasons' outcomes. At 2-1. the Phoxes are likely can­didates for playoff contention and Howard -despite having yet to register a victory -remains in postseason consideration. When asked if the Ducks could usc the momentum from their impres­sive performance to get the two wins necessary for a playoff bid. Duck captain Callie Whelan sim­ply responded, "Totally". 
"We're just having fun now," Whelan said. "We played 'cap­ture the flag' at practice". Whelan hopes that the freshman, who constitute the majority of the starters, will be mature enough to help carry the team to victory on tonight against Pangborn. 
The Phoxes are equally opti­mistic about their chances in tonight's match, hoping the ride the momentum from two impres­sive victories. Whatever the result, tonight's game will feature two tough teams with newfound hope and excitement. Game time is set for 7 p.m.

Farve feels better, but Pederson m_ay be done 
Associated Press 
GREEN BAY, Wis. -Brett Favre skipped practice Wednesday, still feeling the effects of a concussion to go along with a softball-sized bruise on his left leg and a loose left shoulder. 
And he's the healthy one. 

Backup quarterback Doug Pederson has a cracked bone in his back. a broken rib and a torn muscle in his side, all the result of Keith Washington's wicked sideline hit Sunday in Green Bay's loss to the Giants. 
We're getting old." said Pnderson, a year older than Favre. who turns 35 next week. "'We are getting old and we're fragile and that's the thing that even Brett real­izes. I mean, he's no spring chicken, either."' 
Favre has been knocked out of his last two games. but while he prepares for his 213th consecutive start (including playoffs) Monday night against Tennessee. Pederson is preparing himself for a possible trip to injured reserve. 
On Wednesday evening, Favre's brother-in-law died after crashing an all-terrain vehicle on the player's proper­ty in Sumrall. Miss. 
Casey Tynes, 24. the brother of Favre's wife, Deanna, was riding the ATV without a hel­met when it flipped, Lamar County Sheriff Danny Rigel said. Tynes suffered head injuries. was transported to Forrest General Hospital in Hattiesburg at 6 p.m. and was 
pronounced dead 20 minutns later. Deputy Coroner Handy Beck said. 
The Favre family did not irnmediatnly issue a state­ment. 
Pednrsorlt who has a broken transverse proenss, a small bone ofT the vertebrae wlwm muscles and ligaments attach to the spirw, said he'd consid­er retirement after tlw season if he's placed on lit

Favre went back in two plays later and threw a touch­down pass on fourth down. which turnnd out to be his last play of the game because he couldn't answer doctors' questions correctly and had memory loss. 
"I remember it all now," Favre said Wednesday in his first public comments since the injury. "Probably toward the end of thn game it all carne back to me.... I didn't remember anything at l"irst. It's probably a good thing I didn't know it was fourth down. Maybe I would have been a little more cautious. 
"Then again, I'm glad I did what l did. If you're going to come back in for a play, that's the way to do it."

make a major focus for us. We have to complete drives," Irish coach Tyrone Willingham said. "That is one of the big differ­ences on good offensive teams, [and] that is not just about yardage." 
The Irish gained 536 total yards against Purdue on Saturday and finished with 16 points. But, more importantly, Notre Dame rushed for just 76 yards on 36 carries. 
In its five games, Notre Dame has only won the three times it has rushed for over 100 yards. Establishing a solid running game is just as important as fin­ishing drives, and on Saturday against the Boilermakers run defense, the offensive line never got a strong push. 
"It's that same old good and bad [on the offensive line]." Willingham said. "We've done some good things. To be able to throw the ball as many times as we did Saturday and produce the yardage that we produced, you have to have some good things in our protection.

Willingham said. "Sometimes they do some good things that make it very difficult for you to do your best at certain areas." 
But Notre Dame has struggled rushing the ball against unlikely opponents. While the Irish gained 135 yards on the ground against a Michigan team that gives up 47.2 yards per game, Notre Dame rushed for a mere 11 yards facing a BYU defense that surrenders 113.2 yards per game. 
·When the Irish tried to rush the ball against Washington to run out clock in the second half of a blowout victory, the line could not get a push and Notre Dame had to punt. The Irish fin­ished with 146 rush yards, while Washington has given up a much greater 227.2 yards per game over the course of the season. 
Against Purdue, the Irish had no answer in the running game. Now, coaches must prepare the line to face a Stanford defensive front that gave up only 99 rush yards to USC in their last game. The front includes imposing 6­foot-2, 320-pound n~e guard Babatunde Oshinowo, who has 11 tackles. 
"Well, I don't think it's just him. I really think it's their entire defense [that] is aggres­sive," Willingham said. "They are doing a great job because the stat that you mentioned is quite impressive. I think they have

Willingham faces former team 

By PAT LEONARD  Associate Sports Editor 

Stanford holds no grudges -at least none that are visi­ble. 
During the 57-7 Cardinal home loss to Notre Dame last season, critics gasped when the Irish attempted a fake punt in the fourth quarter. Punter D.J. Fitzpatrick threw 14 yards to Chinedum Ndukwe on fourth-and-17, and the Irish turned the ball over. 
Stanford junior center Brian Head said he and his teammates not only have turned the page on that play -they also are not phased by facing their former coach. 
"I think about all of our opponents in pretty much the S<J,me way," Head said. "To me, it doesn't make much of a difference that we're playing against coach Willingham. I just want to go out. there and beat them in their house." 
Willingham expects the attitude Head exudes. 
"Even though some of the [Stanford players] were recruited by myself, hopeful­ly they have some fond mem­ories of our rel'a.tionship," Willingham said. "But when the game starts, I'm quite s u r e t h at t h e y will f o r g'e t who is on the other side and see only Notre Dame and see only that they want to defeat Notre Dam()." 
Willingham said he does not expect a game like last season's blowout. 
"Stanford is coming to town probably the best that 
we've seen them in the last 
two years," Willingham said. 
"They are coming in here a 
very confident team. They 
have got one loss, that one 
loss to co-national champion 
USC, and they took them 
right down to the wire." 
But Willingham would not 
rule out using the same fake 
punt-in any situation. 
"If we were to get the same rush which we had, we've had it twice this year in games, and if we are that sit­uation where we're not backed up on our goalline and the percentages are not favorable, we'll try to com­plete [the play again]." 
Injury report 
Running back Hyan Grant and wide receiver Maurice Stovall are not listed as starters on the Notre Dame depth chart this week. Darius Walker is listed as the starting tailback, and Matt Shelton is penciled in as a starting wideout along with Rhema McKnight. 
Willingham said at the beginning of the week that the statuses of both Grant and Stovall were unknown. 
"We'll see as we progress through the week," Willingham said. "Tuesday is usually our first day when we have an opportunity to really see him on the field. We start to evaluate today to pace them on the week and see where they are at." 
Walker has filled in for Grant and takeri the majority of snaps in the backfield, with Marcus Wilson seeing the field along with Walker against Purdue. The Irish,

though, could use Grant's leadership and physical tal­ents to compliment Walker, and vice versa. 
"Ryan Grant has a leader­ship presence, he has a per­formance presence and he has an experience pres­ence," Willingham said. "And all of those things you count on in a play in your system: that players around him feel very comfortable. with what he adds to our football team. His running style is that of a slasher, so therefore, he can do things that some of the other backs can't do."

Stadium record. For most of the season, the offensive line has given Quinn time to throw in the pocket. 
The offensive line lost only left tackle Jim Molinaro and oft­injured guard Sean Milligan to graduation after last season, when Notre Dame rushed for 4.0 yards per carry. This season, the starters -left tackle Ryan Harris, left guard Bob Morton, center John Sullivan, right guard Dan Stevenson and right tackle Mark LeVoir-entered the sea­son more experienced and more familiar with one another. But a seven-sack, 76-rush yard per­formance against Purdue had coaches giving the Boilermaker's defensive line credit for neutral­izing the Irish at the line scrim­mage. 
"Some of it has to be the guy that you're playing across from,"

cess if we have our 
ground game with us," Willingham said. "But if not, if it's not there, we have to find another way to be successful." 
There may not be another option. While Quinn picked apart Purdue's secondary, Notre Dame is 0-7 in games which Quinn throws more than 40 passes. 
"The only time that a team wins when it passes for a lot more than 300 yards is when two teams pass for 300 yards," Willingham said. "Usually when you're throwing the ball that much that many times, ... it doesn't mean that you win and we are aware of that. That's why the run game -the addition of the run game -is so important to.what we do."

Hornets sting Belles in tough MIAA contest 
Kalamazoo snaps 
·Saint Mary's three­game win streak 
By JUSTIN STETZ Sports Writer 
The Belles got stung Wednesday night when the Kalamazoo Hornets beat them in three games. Saint Mary's came into the match with high expectations and on a three-game winning streak. But Kalamazoo proved to be too much for the Belles win­ning 30-27, 30-20 and 30-22. 

The Belles played hard in the first game, but fell short in a close match. They were unable to overcome an early deficit as the Hornets picked apart their defense and held back Saint Mary's offensive threat. 
In the first meeting of these two teams, Saint Mary's had a similar experience as Kalamazoo prevented a come­back by improving throughout the match. 
Michelle Turley was one of the few bright spots for the Belles. She finished the game with a balanced game of 10 kills on offense and 13 digs on defense. Shelly Bender provided some help for the team by collecting nine kills to go along with her 10 digs.

The loss drops the Belles to 4-6 in the MIAA and 4-9 on the season. 
However, first-place Alma knocked off Adrian College putting Saint Mary's in a tie for fifth place.

After sitting out the beginning of the season with a nagging leg injury, Kevin Goldthwaite is back in action for the Irish and was named Big East Defensive Player of the Week on Monday. 
"I think whenever you lose a player of Kevin's stature ... whenever somebody like that goes out, you lose something," to improve offensively and defensively in such a tight division as senior Michelle Gary said earlier in the week. Hope College has drawn near­er and is within striking dis­tance of the Belles. 
Now the Belles must regroup from their loss and prepare to face Calvin College Friday. Calvin is in second place in the league and has already defeated the Belles earlier this season. The Knights are 8-1 in the confer­ence and will provide the Belles with a good measure­ment of their progress.

Back on the ice 
Team takes to the rink against No. 4 Minnesota-Duluth 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
lie's lost his two leading scor­ers from last season. and three defensernen from last year's NCAA tournament team have also graduatl~d. 
This year. his team is opening its regular season with a two­game series at the Joyce Center against No. 4 Minnesota-Duluth. who made it to the Frozen Four last year before losing to even­tual champion Denver in the semifinals. 
Irish coach Dave Poulin. are you insmw? 
"I think it's a tremendous challenge," Poulin said. "What better way to start a season? When you look at last year and our NCAA run, one of the rca­sons we got there was the strength of our non-conference schedule. 
"There's only going to be two freshmen on defense [tonight]. so it's not like we're going to be throwing guys out there who have never played before. And we've got great goaltending backing us up." 
The Irish open this season 

with a defense that features only one senior in Joe Zurenko and one junior in Chris Trick ­the rest are sophomores and freshmen. 
That's a far cry from last sea­son, when graduated seniors Tom Galvin, Neil Komadoski, Brett Lebda and T.J. Mathieson combined for 486 career games on Notre Dame's blueline. This year's returning defensemen -Zurenko. Trick, and sophomores Wcs O'Neill and Noah Babin ­have played 201 career games. 
With such a young defense, Notre Dame will look to its goalies to step up even more than last year -when the Irish netminders combined for a 2.42 goals-against average (GAA) and a .923 save percentage. 
Sophomore David Brown and senior Morgan Cey enter this season as two of the best goal­tenders in Notre Dame history. Cey, barring a complete collapse this season, will annihilate the Irish records in GAA, save per­centage and shutouts. 
Brown, meanwhile, only had one of the best years in the country for any goalie, much

Irish look for more shutouts 
By KATE GALES Sports Writer 

In physics. the formula for momentum is simple to calru­late. It's harder for a soccer team to figure out the bPst way to utilize individual tal­ents, but the Irish am finding their stride and riding their momentum al'ter thn~e straight shutout victories into tonight's matchup against conference-rival Pittsburgh. 
"We're making progrPss every ganw," Irish roach Bobby Clark said. "You'w got to tak1~ something from PV~>ry game and try and move on a little bit." 
The No.9 Irish are 7-~-1 overall and 3-1-0 in confer­ence play, having recently posted victories against formi­dable foes Villanova and Boston College. 
"It's one of the strongest conferences in the country for soccer." Clark said of the Big East. "You've got to keep play-

Schedule released for 2004-05 season 
Irish to face two top-10 teams, nine NCAA qualifiers 
By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN Sports Editor 
The Irish will tip off a 2004 season that includes two top­10 teams and nine NCAA qualifiers from last year with the Preseason Women's National Invitational after two exhibition games against Premier Sports (Nov. 3) and the Hoosier Lady Stars (Nov. 
6). 
The schedule, released Wednesday, has the Irish play­ing 13 games at the Joyce Center, where they were unde­feated last season. 
The Preseason WNIT is filled with tough teams, including NCAA Elite Eight participant Duke, Pac-10 co-champion Arizona State and Ohio State. 

"With the schedule we have lined up, we expect to be test­ed right from the opening tip this season," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said in a release Wednesday. "Playing in the Preseason WNIT will give us a good indication of where we stand early in the year and it will help to pre­pare us for the other strong teams that will come later in the season." 
Notre Dame is scheduled to be on national television four times, including contests at Connecticut, last year's Big East champions and against Purdue, ranked No. 9 to end the year. Both will be on ESPN2. 
This year's schedule will be a tough one for the seasoned 2004-05 Irish team. led by
