Alumni I I all dished out a ban on the installation of satnllitl' television in its dorm rooms fol­lowing an incident Associate Vice President for Hesidencl' Life William Kirk said cost the University "several thousand dollars." 
Andrew Breslin -the Alumni llall resident assistant where the problem arose -said the incident involved both the lire protection system and the satel­lite systems erected by the stu­dents in his section. 
"The exact cause has not been discerned directly, but tlw smoke alarm system in Alumni was damaged significantly," Breslin said. "The satellite hook-ups may have played a part in the damage as wires were run near current smoke alarm wires, [but[ this has not been ascertained." 
Breslin said the control boards connecting Alumni to the Notre Dame lirehousn also faced significant damage, how­ever the exact numerical value of this clamagn was not J'nleased to hall stall'.

Dear Diary 
I've kept a journal since I was in the fourth grade. Now that I am nearly twenty years old, the note­books fill up half a bookshelf in my bedroom.

Editor
ize how quickly things can change. 

When I was ten, I wrote about how much fun my friends and I had on the school bus. I wrote about my favorite books and family vacations. And I spent many, many pages writ­ing about Matt Peppercorn -the 'hot' eighth-grader who I loved from afar -behind glasses, braces and a shy smile. 
In high school I wrote about new friends, old friends, lost friends. I wrote about getting my driver's license -and getting in my first car accident -and laughing with friends until I could hardly breathe. 
Senior year I thought a lot about the future. The thought of change was frightening. I filled pages with questions: What college should l go to? What if I miss home too much? How will I say goodbye? 

Despite the wobbly transition from home to college, Notre Dame was clearly the place for me. Within a few weeks I realized that beneath the Dome, things have a way of working themselves out for the best. 
I wrote that down, too. 

Last year's journal was filled with 'firsts': first day of classes, first SYR, first college final exam, first beer, first football game as a student, first time calling a one-room triple home. 
These days I write a lot about how the time is flying by. I look back at old entries and realize how quickly friends are made, seasons change, memories created before we even have time to realize it. 
Journals, at least mine, prove that the things that worry us most end up being just fine in the end. We might hit the bottom, but we bounce back, somehow. 
When Matt Peppercorn didn't notice me in fourth grade I thought the world was going to end. It did­n't. 

When I got a C in religion in sev­enth grade, I was sure I would never succeed in high school. I did. 
In hindsight, I realize how unim­portant so many things I spent pages worrying about really are. The stuff that keeps them captivat­ing is the big picture. It's just about a life slowly unfolding. 
Lots of the pages are uninterest­ing. But I wouldn't take back a sin­gle word. They teach me to cherish the special moments, to find a story worth telling about each day. 
But I'll stick with providing brief synopses of my journals. God forbid they ever get published.

Briton finds venomous centipede In house 
LONDON -Aaron Balick expected to find a tiny mouse rustling behind the TV in his apartment. Instead, he found a ven­omous giant centipede that somehow hitched a ride from South America to Britain. 
"Thinking it was a mouse, I went to investigate the sound. The sound was com­ing from under some papers which I lifted, expecting to see the mouse scamper away," the 32-year-old psy­chotherapist said Wednesday. "Instead, when I lifted the papers, I saw this

He trapped the 9-inch­long creature between a stack of books and put it in a plastic container.

Pollee find shooting is only a movie 
ST. PAUL-A gory scene staged for a low-budget hor­ror movie proved a little too realistic for police. When officers were called to the Dayton's Bluff neighborhood overlooking downtown Sunday night about a possi­ble shooting, they found a parked car with what looked like brain matter and blood on the front seat, dashboard and windows -but no vic­
tim. 

Police began knocking on doors and found Lance Hendrickson, the car's owner. He was OK. 
The scene had been staged by Hendrickson, 23, and his friends for their hor­ror movie, "Summer School," he told officers.

While no date has been assigned for the beginning of construction on the new dorms, Firth said the University is now dealing 
· with "the nuts and bolts" of the project. Poorman said construction was contingent on how long it takes to raise the money through a capital campaign. Another long-term goal is Hesidential Scholars, which Poorman described as a "real simple, low maintenance" pilot program being tested in St. Edward's and Welsh

"We've gone from the big

"Gambling has become a huge issue on college cam­puses," Poorman said. "We're beginning to see the hints of gambling problems. And since I teach undergrad­uates,· I think it's safe to say there's probably a significant gender divide on this issue." 
While he did not classify Notre Dame students' gam­bling habits as a crisis, Poorman said he hoped to follow the lead of other uni­versities and "try to be slightly ahead of the issue." 
The Stepan Center is yet another aspect of Poorman's plan. lie said he wants to see the easily recognizable build­ing replaced with "a more serviceable facility." Soon, he expects to have "a very pre­liminary rendering of what the building might look like." 
Poorman was also quick to praise Student Government representatives, especially student body president Dave Baron and vice president Lizzi Shappell, for their ongoing dedication and hard work on initiatives like the Gender Relations Center, the TRANSPO deal, the NDBay acquisition and the upcoming inaugurat}.on for University President Father John Jenkins. 
"These people have not been sleeping, I want you to know," Poorman said. "In seven years, no administra­tion has hit the ground run­ning as well as David and Lizzi." 
And the University is run­ning right alongside them. When Poorman came to the end of his outline, he seemed to be searching for some­thing more to add. 
"I guess other than that, there's not much going on," he said, laughing.

access and some light. 

"All the windows [of the hotel] are gone, but we are in the inner core and will probably be OK but wet in the end," the pair wrote Monday. "The building shook a few times when it was hit by something, but EMT have inspected and feel we are safe here still, or at least safer." 
Later Monday, after the eye of the storm had passed, Zachman and Chambers wrote again to assure colleagues of their safety and expressed gratitude. 
"There is major debris in the street, lots of windows broken, trees uprooted, a few crushed cars that we can see," they wrote. 
The hotel staff had been "mag­ical" toward its stranded guests, the women said, and had pro­vided food. 
Saint Mary's Italian depart­ment chair Nancy D'Antuono, who spoke with Zachman by phone at 5 p.m. Tuesday, said the two women had been instructed to fill their bathtub with water before the storm hit and to use it for hygienic pur­poses. 
"They are hardly in the most elegant circumstances," D'Antuono said. "They were in good spirits, they were just tired of the heat, the worry, and the inconvenience." 
They hoped to be able to leave the city soon either by plane or bus by Wednesday morning, the women said. 
The situation grew increasing­ly dire, however, when two lev­ees, designed to protect the New Orleans from ocean swells, gave way Tuesday flooding 80 percent of the city. 
Images show11d hurrieane vic­tims wading through ehest-deep water on the famed Canal Street. Aggressive looters broke windows and stole ofT with goods, often in plain sight of police oflices and state guards­men, the Associated Press reported. 
Early Wednesday, Zachman and Chambers wrote and said they were still unable to leave the hotel. 
"The llood waters keep rising, so things aren't all that great," they wrote. "We probably won't get out for a few more days. There was one road out last night, but it may or may not be there this morning. Yesterday we almost got out, but the buses were flooded. It is hot and smelly but we arc still eating." 
In their last communication with the College Wednesday afternoon, they said they did not anticipate being able to leave any time soon. 
"It is looking like it will be a long time [before we can leave!," they wrote. "The water contin­ues to rise and we are pretty low on the evacuation list." 
Joe Miller of the psychology department said students in Chambers' class were being instructed to keep up with the work assigned to the syllabus. If she has not returned by Monday, he said, other professors will cover her classes. 
Various professors were filling in for Zachman until she returned, Spanish professor Isis Quinteros said.

campus and you are maybe one of only a handful of guys walk­ing around with a campus full of girls. You get stares, and I'm sure most of the girls are won­dering why I'm there." 
Sylvester, a history major at Notre Dame, is also a social studies secondary education student at Saint Mary's. He decided to enroll in classes at the College when he realized Notre Dame does not have an education certification program which would allow him to become a high school teacher when he graduates. 
Sylvester has taken six cours­es at Saint Mary's, and said after taking so many he feels more "comfortable" in the all­female campus environment, 
"I definitely feel outnum­bered, but I wouldn't say over­whelmed. Most, if not all of the women that I've met [at Saint Mary's] have been easy to talk to and get along with. I proba­bly get stared at a lot walking around campus, but not so much in class," he said. 
Senior Shane Larson, who has taken anatomy and is cur­rently enrolled in a biochem­istry course at the College, also said that while men "get used to" the shock of all-women's classes, being a man in all­female science classes does not usually present any hardship. 
"There aren't any real chal­lenges, except that you will be noticed by all the students and the professor at all times, so you have to prepare yourself and have pride in your work always," he said. 
Larson said he chose to take classes at Saint Mary's because the College has "a good anato­my program and labs that help teach the material well." He also said he gets mixed reac­tions to his taking classes at the school, including misconcep­tions about the curriculum at Saint Mary's. 

"A lot of people think its funny [that I'm taking classes at Saint Mary's] and many ND people think that the classes at SMC are much easier than ones offered at Notre Dame," he said. "I feel that the academics at SMC are the same as that of Notre Dame." 
Larson also said the faculty plays a key role in his class­room experience at Saint Mary's. 
"I like the faculty at SMC, they are very approachable. intelli­gent people andterrific teach­ers. They care about you learn­ing," he said. "Teachers [at Saint Mary's] want you to retain the material after the class is over a bit more, so they often spend more time on the concep­tual aspects of the class." 
Senior elementary education major Eric West -who will be the first male to graduate from the program in the past eight years -said the classes at Saint Mary's have "a completely different format" than those at Notre Dame. 
"There is a lot more group work with projects and presen­tations, especially with regards to education," he said. 
West said he likes the class­room dynamic at Saint Mary's, and not just because he is sur­rounded by women. 

"I like the smaller, more per­sonable classes," he said. "It works well, especially for teach­ing education classes. The pro­fessors really get to know each of the students and get involved not only in classwork, but also their lives during the time in college." 
However, West also said he feels that by not being able to study education in a mixed-gen­der environment, he may be missing elements of the class­rooms he will be teaching in. 
"I feel like I miss out on some of the more male aspects of teaching, especially in today's society where you hear about allegations from students about teacher misconduct," he said. "I think males in education are held to somewhat of a higher standard. This aspect is missing from a lot of classes -but it can be picked up in field work and by asking questions." 
All three men said they would recommend taking a class at Saint Mary's. 
"[Taking classes at Saint Mary's is a] great opportunity to grow as an individual and gain confidence. They have a lot of classes that we, at Notre Dame, don't have or offer," Larson said. "I have a higher opinion of SMC having taken a class there twice now. I never really saw the campus before and now realize how nice it is." 
West said it was the people at Saint Mary's that made his experience at the school worth recommending to others. 
''I've met my 2 best friends at SMC and have had countless experiences that I will remem­ber for the rest of my life, as well as be able to take into the classroom when I become a teacher," he said. 
Sylvester said he believes not just men, but women from Notre Dame should take a class at Saint Mary's. 
"I think the opportunity to go over to SMC is very unique and more people should be informed of the program. I would recommend taking class­es over at SMC to anyone, both guys and girls from ND," he said. "It not only offers an opportunity to maybe broaden your horizons and outlook, but if you are passionate about something like education, or dance, or something else, you can use SMC as a resource."

Ne-w Orleans tnayor: thousands dead 
Engineers continue to repair levees; evacuees leave Superdome for Houston

NEW OHLEANS llurrkane Katrina probably killed thousands Qf people in New Orleans, the mayor said Wodnesday -an esti­mate that. if aecurate, would make the storm the nation's deadliest natural disastnr since at least the 1906 San Francisco earth­quake. 
"We know there is a sig­nificant number of dead bodies in the water," and other people dead in attics, Mayor Hay Nagin said. Asked how many, he said: "Minimum, hundreds. Most likely, thousands." 
The f'rightening estimate came as Army engineers struggled to plug New Orleans' breached levees with giant sandbags and concrete barriers, and authorities drew up plans to dear out the tens of thou­sands ol' people left in the Big Easy and practically abandon the flooded-out city. Many of the evacuees -inducting thousands now staying in the Superdome ­will be moved to the Astrodome in Houston, 350 miles away.

Health threats grow for New Orleans hurricane victims 
Associated Press 

As a public health catastrophe unfolded Wednesday in New Orleans, hospitals in the Crescent City sank further into disaster, airlifting babies without their parents to other states and strug­gling with more sick people appearing at their doors. 
Dangerous, unsanitary condi­tions spread across the city, much of which now sits in a murky stew of germs. 
The federaJ government declared a public health emer­gency for the Gulf Coast region, promising 40 medical centers with up to 10,000 beds and thou­sands of doctors and nurses for the hurricane-ravaged area. 
In a stunning example of how

"We're getting kind of at the end of our rope," with a skeleton staff of doctors and nurses who have been on duty nonstop since Sunday, Voss said. 
Officials were trying to evacu­ate 10,000 people -patients, staff and refugees -out of nine hospitals battling floodwaters or using generators running low on fuel. About 300 people were stranded on the roof of one two­story hospital in the New Orleans suburb of Chalmette. ·

lifted Wednesday to hospitals in Houston, Baton Rouge, La., and Birmingham, Ala. Many were hooked up to battery-operated breathing machines keeping them alive. 
Their parents had been forced to evacuate and leave the infants behind; by late in the day, most if not all had been contacted and told where their babies were being taken, said hospital spokeswoman Katherine Voss. 
"We actually encouraged them to leave. It would just be more people to evacuate if there was a problem," said Dr. Vince Adolph, a pediatric surgeon. 
Helicopters had to land on the 
their regular chemotherapy or radiation treatments. 
"We have thousands of people who are getting ill ... our hospi­tals need to be prepared to take care of the incoming sick," said Coletta Barrett of the Louisiana Hospital Association. 
Only about 150 patients were able to be evacuated Wednesday from all nine New Orleans hospi­tals, said Knox Andress, an emergency room nurse in Shreveport, La. He is regional coordinator for a federal emer­gency preparedness grant cover­ing the state and is involved in helping place evacuees in other hospitals. 
"We're ready for patients and we can't get them. We just can't get them out," he said. 
The government said dozens of medical disaster teams from nearby states were moving into hard-hit areas. 
"We've identified 2,600 beds in hospitals in the 12-state area. In addition to that, we've identified 40,000 beds nationwide, should they be needed," said Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt. 
Storm survivors, particularly in New Orleans where floodwaters remain, face a cauldron of infec­tious agents, public health experts said. 
"You can think of floodwaters as diluted sewage," said Mark Sobsey, a professor of environ­mental microbiology at the University of North Carolina. 
Whatever infections people carry go into sewage and can be expected to show up in floodwa­ters. That includes common diar­rheal germs including hepatitis A and Norwalk virus. 
"We are gravely concerned about the potential for cholera, typhoid and dehydrating diseases that could come as a result of the stagnant water and the condi­tions," said Leavitt. . However, officials at the feder­al Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health experts said cholera and typhoid are not considered to be high risks in the area. CDC officials suggested Leavitt was simply mentioning examples of diseases that could arise from contami­nated food and water. 
Some experts said worries about catching illnesses from being near dead animals or human bodies are somewhat overblown. 
"People who are alive can give you a whole lot more diseases than people who are dead," said Richard Garfield, a Columbia University professor of interna­tional clinical nursing who helped coordinate medical care in Indonesia after the tsunami. 
Mosquito-borne diseases may start to emerge within days. West Nile virus and dengue fever are both potential risks following a situation like the one in coastal Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. Officials also cited carbon monoxide poisoning risks to people using generators and stoves.

IN BRIEF Grand jury indicts drug companies 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -A federal grand jury indicted three businesses and 11 people Wednosday in an alleged conspiracy to sell $42 million worth of counterfeit, stolen and illegally import1~d prescription drugs, includ­ing the popular cholesterol drug Lipitor. 
The 57-count indictment named Kansas City-based Albers Medical Distributors Inc., Lexington, Neb.-based Med-Pro Inc., and Springfiold, 111.-based II.D. Smith Wholesale Drug Co. 
According to the indictment, the defendants acquired the drugs from a number of sources, repackagea them in counterfeit bottles and then sold them through wholesalers and retailers, often using fake documents to hide their origins. 
Food and Drug Administration agent Larry Sperl said ollicials had no reports of ill health effects from the drugs. More than likely, the fakes simply didn't provide the benefit the patients expected, he said. 
Airlines cancel southern flights 
ATLANTA -Some major carriers have canceled flights to the New Orleans and Gulfport, Miss., airports -popular destina­tions for tourists, convention participants and gamblers -until at least next week, increasing financial pressure for the airlines as they also deal with potential fuel short­ages. 
Daily jet fuel production nationwide has been cut 13 percent because of damage from the hurricane to Gulf Coast refineries, aecording to Jack Evans of the Air Transport Association. 
"What it means is there is less fuel essen­tially," Evans said Wednesday. "Carriers are having to take measures to conserve fuel at airports where they are low and tanker in l'uel when serving some destinations on the East Coast." 
Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, meanwhile, has rnopnnnd to allow humanitarian flights in and out during daylight hours, but oflieials are unsure when commercial service will resume there. The uncertainty has raised questions about the financial impaet on the airlines that in particular serve that airport.

PHILIPPINES 


Legislators end impeachment 
Associated Press 
MANILA -President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's congres­sional allies dealt a major blow Wednesday to efforts to oust her, using their dominating majority -and the opposition's absence -to toss out all three impeach­ment complaints against her. 
Opposition legislators cried foul and warned that the coun­try's third "people power" revolt loomed. They watched the events unfold on TV, like the rest of the country, after walking out a day earlier from the House justice department committee hearing on the complaints. 
But despite clashes between riot police and anti-Arroyo demonstrators outside Congress that injured 11 protesters, there was little sign that allegations of Arroyo rigging last year's elec­tion were generating the emo­tions -or masses -that fueled the peaceful ousters of dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 and Arroyo's predecessor, President Joseph Estrada, in 2001. 
"I hope the public will receive it favorably," said pro-Arroyo Rep. Rodolfo Antonino. "If the opposition claims that this was railroaded, it was not railroad­ed. They were the ones who walked out." 
The opposition did indeed claim it was railroaded, saying the committee hearing was a well-orchestrated sham. Pro­Arroyo lawmakers claimed the opposition was using its own theatrics, calling the walkout a desperate, premeditated attempt to trigger street protests. 
Opposition spokesman Hep. Francis Escudero said the impeachment charges are now on "life support," adding: "Our country is now on life support because the issues would not be foreclosed." 
The opposition held slim hopes of still getting 79 signatures ­one-third of the House of Representatives -that are needed to send the case directly to the Senate for trial. It claims it is six signatures short. 
The committee vote culminat­ed two rancorous days, starting with Tuesday's walkout. The opposition claimed the case was being killed unfairly, without getting a real hearing, on the strength of the administration dominance in the House. 
Arroyo's allies first voted to exclude two of the three impeachment complaints, including one crafted by the opposition accusing her of three major offenses, including betray­al of the public trust. 
That left the original com­plaint, which is widely consid­ered to be the weakest -and which the opposition claims was crafted two months ago by Arroyo allies as a safeguard against possible impeachment. Only one impeachment charge can be flied against an oflicial in a year. 
After rejecting suggestions that the complaint was legally 
faulty, the committee voted 49-1 that it could it not be pursued legally, in part because it would require using illegal wiretaps as evidence. 
Pro-Arroyo lawmakers broke into applause, some shaking each other's hands. 
The opposition fumed. 
"This is the saddest day per­haps in Congress," said leftist Hep. Teodoro Casino. "This so brazen. The people have no other choice but to take to the streets because that is the only place we can resolve all these questions raised here." 
TV video showed police push­ing back rain-soaked protesters with fiberglass shields and hit­ting them with wooden trun­cheons, including women sprawled on the road. A protest­er, blood oozing from his head, was escorted away by compan­ions. Some demonstrators fought back with stones. 
Popular televangelist Eddie Villanueva, a failed presidential candidate, urged the opposition to exhaust constitutional means of pressing the charges against Arroyo, but warned that people would have no recourse but to take to the streets if the charges were dismissed on a technicality. 
"If they kill this -the fight of principled lawmakers -today or tomorrow, in front of God and history, it's justified for the Filipino people.... They could not be stopped from going to the court of the streets," Villanueva said. 
FRANCE 


President calls for 
changes in capital 
Associated Press 
PARIS -President Jacques Chirac said France must build more public housing and reno­vate crumbling apartment buildings, an urgent response to three fires that recently burned through run-down Paris lodgings and killed scores of African immigrants. 
Police, meanwhile, were preparing to evacuate the cap­ital's most dilapidated apart­ment buildings and havens for squatters this week. 
At a Cabinet meeting, Chirae told Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin to draw up plans to renovate run-down apartment buildings -a response to the blazes that killed a total of 48 people since spring, most of them African immigrants. 
"Faced with this situation, we must act," Chirac said, in comments relayed by govern­ment spokesman Jean­Francais Cope. "What's urgent is to ensure the safety of peo­ple living in precarious hous­ing." 
The latest fire occurred Monday as flames swept through a dilapidated building in central Paris, killing seven people, including a 6-year-old boy. His desperate mother threw him from a fifth-floor window. 

The tragedy highlighted the plight of growing immigrant populations and the precari­ous conditions in which an estimated two million people live in France. 
The blaze began on the sec­ond floor of the building which, according to police and city officials, housed 40-60 people from the Ivory Coast ­about half of whom were ille­gal immigrants. Authorities say they believe the fire was accidental. 
On Friday, another blaze in a Left Bank building killed 17 African immigrants, including 14 children. Four months ear­lier, a fire in a budget hotel killed 24 people, mainly immi­grants. 
Officials were quick to pledge action after the latest fire. 
"Money is not an issue in this affair," Housing Minister Jean-Louis Borloo told France-Info radio. "We just have organization problems, problems with speed. This takes time, and it's complex." 
In a commentary in the daily Le Monde, Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe Delanoe suggested Monday's disaster could have been avoided because the building was ofli­cially classified as "irreparably unlit" in July 2002.

O'Connor's departure leaves the court evenly split in anotll­er area: al'lirmative action. She supported it in some instances. In his Reagan-era writings, Roberts seemed unsympathetic to what he called "quotas."

"When P.eople say there will be seismic changes in affirma­tive aetion and religion, I think that's just smoke," Garnett said. "I don't think there's much room for change. There's room at tho margins in dose eases."

PUERTO RICO 


Alleged terrorists demand trial through hunger strikes 
Associated Press 

SAN JUAN -Scores of detainees have started a new hunger strike at the U.S. prison for terror suspects in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, demanding to be put on trial or released, human rights lawyers said Wednesday. 
Many have been held more than 3 1/2 years without charge or access to lawyers. Most were captured in the Afghanistan war, suspected of tics to al-Qaida or the ousted Taliban regime that sheltered the terrorist network. 
The hunger-striking detainees allege the Pentagon reneged on promises to bring the detention camp into com­pliance with Geneva Conventions if they ended a hunger strike this summer involving up to 200 of the 500­plus detained men from some 40 countries, the New York­based Center for Constitutional Rights said. 
The military said only 52 prisoners were involved in the first strike. An attorney with the center, Gitanjali Gutierrez said the Pentagon "hid evi­dence of the hunger strike and prisoner abuse from visiting senators and the public." 
"Prisoners are now prepared to die in an effort to receive a fair hearing and humane treatment," Gutierrez said. 
Spokesmen for the detention mission at Guantanamo could not immediately be reached for comment. Several tele­phones in the public affairs office there rang without 
response. There was no imme­diate response to e-mail mes­sages. A Pentagon spokesman referred a reporter to the mili­tary's Miami-based Southern Command, which said com­ment could come only directly from Guantanamo. 
Detainee Binyam "Benjamin" Mohammed al-Habashi said the military promised that if they stopped the June-July hunger strike "they would bring the prison into compli­ance with the Geneva Conventions." 
That strike ended July 28, but nothing had changed by Aug. 11, said Mohammed, an Ethiopian refugee detained in Pakistan in 2002. 
Mohammed said some 150 detainees began refusing meals at the beginning of August and were joined by another 60 on Aug. 11. He told his lawyer he had planned to start his fast Aug. 12, 
"I do not plan to stop until I either die or we are respected. People will definitely die," he said.

RUSSIA 
Falllilies lllourn losses, afraid of future attacks 
Russian people remember terrorist school siege 
Associated Press 
BESIAN-Anhruished relatives of children killed in a school siege a year ago said Wednesday the government has failed to learn from the tragedy and they warned persistent corruption has left Hussia vulnerable to similar attacks in the future. 
"If this isn't corrected, there will be another terrorist attack like Beslan," said Susanna Dudiyeva, whose son was among morn than 330 pnople killed. "We urn lighting for the truth." 
I h1r commenL<; came on the eve of ceremonies in a burnt-out gymnasium decorated with stum~d animals to mark the first anniversary of the hostage-tak­ing, which bngan Sept. 1, 2004, on the lirst day of school.

There was no way to immedi­

was shot. But some people in it 
appeared to be those blamed by 
Russia for carrying out the 
attack, and the summer-like 
 baekground in the footage lends eredence to the belief it was shot in months just prior to the raid. 
Thousands of Ossetians were expected to be in Beslan for the commemorative ceremonies that begin Thursday. But Putin was unwelcome "since he is responsi­ble for what happened in Beslan," Dudiyeva said. "He is the guarantor of our freedom 
and our security and therefore, the

Critics also allege that corrup­tion may have contributed to the apparent ease with which the more than 30 heavily armed attackers made their way to the school. 
At School No. 1 's gymnasium, where more than 1,100 people­mostly childrnn -endured near­ly three days of heat, thirst, hunger and fear. color photo­graphs of the victims hang on bullet-scarred walls alongside faded graffiti begging victims' forgiveness. 
Dying carnations rested on windowsills next to burned tim­hers and mildewed stufl'ed ani­mals. The remnants of the roof, which collapsed on vietims on the last day of the siege, were eov­nred by mntal and plastic to shinld against rain. 
Thn militants who comman­deernd the gymnasium demand­nd an nnd to Hussian military presence in Chechnya. The attack ended Sept. 3 when Hussian forces stormed the school after explosions were lward inside. More than half the hostages who died were children. 
"The government is supposed to guarantee our lives, take msponsibility for our lives, and they haven't, so we're taking responsibility," said Dudiyeva, head of tho Beslan Mothers' Committee. Hcpresentatives of the group will fly to Moseow on Friday to mnet Putin and address grinvanees, she said. 
Also, a video obtained Wndnesday by Associated Press Tnlovision News shows notorious Chnehen warlord Shamil Basayev -who has claimed he master­mined the attaek -and several other fighters at their forest eamp apparently preparing for the raid. 
One seetion shows a man known as the Colonel, who allegedly led the raid, as an inter­viewer asks if he is longing for Allah. lie responds yes. Another frame shows a lighter in glasses. a beard and dressed in fatigues 
Russian special 
forces acted "abominably" in the seizure's final hours, when most of the hostages died. Some witness have said tank fire, flame-throw­ers and sniper bullets killed far more people than the hostage­takers did. 
"As a man, as a father, as a resident, as a leader, as an Ossetian, we all should feel guilt." Mamsurov said in an interview with foreign journal­ists. 
Zalina Guboreva, 42, called for officials to be held responsible for the attaek that killed her mother and her 9-year-old son. 
"We've had awards, we've had promotions.... But not one pun­ishment," she said. "The whole month we've been unable to eat, to drink, to sleep. It's even worse now. My son was my entire life." 
Another mother. 41-year-old Emma Kisayeva. said Putin should resign. "The man who failed in Moscow, who is to blame for the death of so many people, should not be the president," she said. "Enough is enough. They are ordinary people and should be held responsible for all their mistakes and their crimes." 
Basayev claimed Russian seeu­rity serviees enabled the hostage­takers to travel unhindered through the region and that a Hussian double agent had been among them. 
In the statement posted Wednnsday on the KavkazCenter Web site, Basayev said top secu­rity officials in North Ossetia opened a safe route Aug. 31 for rebels to rcaeh the regional capi­tal. Vladikavkaz. The alleged double agent was supposed to have gained Basayev's confi­dence and then led his men into a trap as they were en route to seize government buildings in Vladikavkaz on Sept. 6. 
Instead. the militants seized the school. Basayev said. 
Basayev's claim seemed designed in part to stoke already strong distrust of top government offieials in the volatile region that includes North Ossetia and Cheehnya. 
NORTH KOREA 

Show-serves as Kitn propoganda 
Associated Press 
SEOUL -North Koreans are flocking to their capital to view performances of a mass gymnastics event that is the highlight of government prop­aganda efforts aimed at inspiring support for the Kim dynasty. 
Some 300,000 people have traveled on special trains and buses to watch what the North calls a "mass game" that opened Aug. 15 on the 60th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japan's colo­nial rule. 
With 100,000 performers, the event features synchro­nized acrobatics against the backdrop of an entire side of a stadium being used as a mosaic where children turn colored pages in books to form giant pictures and ani­mation. 
Before it closes in mid­October, an estimated 10 per­cent of the country's 23 mil­lion population are expected to have seen the show. 
Experts say this year's per­formance is the largest such spectacle in three years. causing North Korea watch­ers to speculate whether the show could signal a major policy announcement -as they apparently have in the past -or whether it is simply intended to shore up support among citizens who have suf­fered years of starvation. 
The performance might be a prelude to a ruling party convention, said Jhe Seong­ho, a professor at Seoul's ChoongAng University. His view mirrors long-running speculation that the party 
could meet for the first time in 25 years when it celebrates its 60th anniversary -and that ruler Kim Jong II eould designate his successor. 
"Convening a party conven­tion this year would be mean­ingful as the country is facing various internal and external hardships," Jhe said. 
In 2002, North Korea put on a similar-sized show to mark the 90th anniversary of the birthday of founding North shambles. Sinee the mid­1990s, the country has rnlied on outside handouts to feed its people. Activists elaim more than 100,000 North Koreans are living in hiding in China after fleeing their hunger-stricken eommunist homeland. Sinee 1998, about 5,500 North Koreans have defected to the South.

centrally con­trolled economy for the first time, phasing out its decades­old food rationing system. The measures caused massive inflation that has exacerbated the country's food crisis. 
Other experts and South Korea's government, howev­er, said the new show is sim­ply a morale-booster aimed at rallying North Koreans around Kim Jong II. 
"Through the festival. the North wants to boost the morale of its people living in difficult conditions," a South Korean official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive relations with the North. 
North Korea's economy is in 

"greatest monu­mental masterpiece" that was "completed under the ener­getic guidance and eare of leader Kim Jong II." When staged in 2002, the perform­ance "caused a great sensa­tion all over the world." the North's Korean Central News Agency said. 
North Korea claims about 70,000-80,000 foreigners watched the show in 2002, although the South's estimate is about 20,000. 
The "mass game" perform­ances are one of few areas in which the impoverished North far surpasses other countries -even putting Olympics' opening cere­monies to shame.

The new gateway on Notre Dame Avenue may remind you of the entrance to a national cemetery. But it also reminds students that their University has lots of money, including the 19th largest endowment and a tuition that rises with the best of them. 
This year, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 
2.5 percent. Notre Dame tuition, room and board (TRB) rose 6.6 percent, from $37,100 to $39,552. Spending from the $3 billion Endowment covers one-sixth of the University's total expenditures. But student tuition and fee income pro­vides nearly 60 percent of the University's operating revenue. Since 1999, TRB increased by 39 percent, while the CPl increased by only 16 percent, but the University increased its financial aid by 151 percent. Notre Dame, through its excellent Financial Aid office, commits to meet the finan­cial needs of every student, but that generally includes the student's com­mitment to take loans, whether feder­al or private. A loan is "financial aid." 
A 2005 Cato Institute study conclud­ed that increases in federal financial aid enabled universities, beginning around 1980, to expand their research and building programs, rely­ing on federal loans to pass the costs on to students. As federal1oan avail­ability rose, the major universities raised their tuition, then lobbied for increased federa1loans, then raised tuition, and so on. The loan burden deters non-wealthy students from attending universities that play the tuition game. "At the most selective private universities across the coun­try, more fathers of freshmen are doc­tors than are hourly workers, teach­ers, clergy members, farmers or

members of the military combined." N.Y. Times, April 22, 2004, p. A1. 
Notre Dame is far from the worst offender. But it has used federal loan programs to expand its plant and to pursue Research Greatness while shifting the cost to students through tuition rises beyond the inflation rate. During the past 18 years, 27 new buildings were erected and 20 major renovations of other buildings took place. The end of the building binge is not in sight. The inevitable high-rise parking garage will symbolize Notre Dame's conversion to a crowded urban-type campus. We lack empirical evidence of any ability of our leaders to reject any big donation for any building project. 
In 1978-79, when Notre Dame first proclaimed itself "A National Catholic Research University," the Notre Dame TRB was $5,180. Adjusted for infla­tion, using the CPI, the 1978-79 total, in 2005 dollars, would now be $15,420. In real money, the TRB is now more than 2-1/2 times what it was when Notre Dame began its pur­suit ofResearch Prestige. In 2004-05, the average need-based University scholarship, given to the 44 percent of undergrads who qualified, was $16,740, bringing the total amount a scholarship student had to pay by cash, loans or work, down to $20,340, or $4,920 more than the 1978-79 TRB in real money. 
The primary historic mission of Notre Dame was undergrad education in the Catholic tradition, with research in an essential, complemen­tary role. Research, especially in the sciences, is an important part of Notre Dame's mission. But the research enterprise ought not to be the tail wagging the dog. 
Our leaders act in what they see as the best interests of Notre Dame. Any criticism here is of policies, not per­sons. But the burden of loans, required to finance the research enterprise, tends to compel Notre Dame grads to forego graduate edu­cation or community service and to defer marriage. It can make it difficult for those who do marry to remain open to having children. 

Notre Dame has been criticized at times for aping the Ivy League. Princeton, however, has a policy that Notre Dame ought to emulate. Princeton informed its incoming class of 2009: "Since ... 2001-02 ... no Princeton aid student has been required to take out a loan to pay for his or her education. The amount that a student normally would have received is replaced by increased Princeton grant. Our 'no loan' policy was a bold step in the opposite direc­tion from a national trend whereby student loans had grown to ... 60 per­cent of all aid and a typical student was borrowing nearly $20,000." Princeton's TRB is $38,297. In 2004­05, 608 students, or 52 percent of the Princeton freshman class, received scholarships averaging $26,100 for a total scholarship aid of $15.9 million. Students can obtain loans to cover unexpected expenses. But the basic aid package is "no loan." 
Princeton is not Notre Dame. It is smaller, with 6,836 students, includ­ing 4,678 full-time undergrads. Its endowment in 2004 was $9.9 billion, 3 times Notre Dame's. Notre Dame, however, has a unique ability to bring huge sums cascading into its coffers for special purposes. Notre Dame, as a Catholic university, should take the lead to enable its grads to serve the common good, and the good of their families and the Church, without a disabling student debt. To a regret­table degree, Notre Dame is investing instead in bricks, mortar and ostenta­tion. Notre Dame has a higher pur­pose. Our leaders ought to consider the Princeton approach.

Solidarity at Notre Dame is more than just a word 
I am sure that for many of us the hap­piness of being baek together for a new academic year at Notre Dame has been compromised by the death, suffering and destruction that is currently affect­ing so many people in Louisiana, Mississippi Father Richard and Alabama. The Warner situation afl'ecting the people of New Faithpoint Orleans is especially dramatic because of the many poor people who are probably most directly affected by this tragedy. 
Foremost in our thoughts and prayers, of course, are the families of our students, their friends and many of our alumni. We are mindful, too, of the Alliance for Catholic Education teachers who live and teach in areas af'f'eeted by hurricane Katrina, and the students, colleagues and families they work with in such a selfless way. 
Our Notre Dame Community always linds ways not only to remember people affeelt~d by violence and loss in our prayers, but also by sharing our finan­cial resources with them. In past years, we have assisted people affected by the tsunami in Asia, floods in Bangladesh and hurricanes in Haiti. We know that our gift is surely small, and even inade­quate, in the faee of such need, but we understand that to act with solidarity and compassion for those who suffer enables us to deepen our own sense of discipleship in imitation of Jesus, whose heart was always touched by anyone affected by illness or rejection -espe­cially the poor. 
This weekend, all monies collected in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart and donations that have been made to the Basilica through the "poor box" will be sent in their entirety to Catholic Relief Services, the ACE communities, and to Holy Cross ministries in the south and southeast. 
I have asked the rectors to take up a special collection at the residence hall Masses on Sunday night that will be used in the same way. 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Double standards 
As I watch news covnrage of the al'hmnath of llurri1:ano Katrina, I ean 't holp but think of last Dneernbnr's l<;unami. Like the nat­ural disa.'itnr that ravished the coastal arnas of Southeast Asia, I lurrieanc Katrina has reminded us of the incredible power of Mother Natum. With or without warning, first-and third-world nations alike arc unable to escape natural disa.<;ter. While the offects of both events arc largely the same -destruetion of proporty, eco­nomic downfall, poor sanitation, loss of human life (all of which have the grnatest elli:1et on the poor)-then~ is one striking dif­fimmen in the aftnrmath of llurricane Katrina: the global com­munity is silnnl. 
Now, it seems to me that after thn l'>unami. there was a groat deal of talk about being united in our humanity and coming together with thn eommon goal of saving human livns. Are rosidonl'> of the Gulf Coast not human? Perhaps thny an~ lowor down, as Michael Moore, Green Day and the Holling Stones would have us believe: they are Amorican. 
Why does the world (led largely by the United States) dive in to aid the victims of the tsunami, and yet remain sidelined during our disas­tnr'! Granted, tho U.S. is not a third-world eountry and already has mueh of the infrastructure needed to pull off a massive disas­ter relief e!Tort, yet I have not 
heard report of a single foreign dignitary ofl'ering his/her condo­lences of our loss. Whole commu­
nities are underwater, people arc still stranded on roofs or in attics, the chance of disease from the standing water is likely and yet the global community looks the other way. 
When the U.S. donates money and manpower to disaster relief efl'orts, the U.N. responds with crit­ieism: the U.S. was too stingy with its pledges, wasn't timely in fulfill­ing the pledges, or some other load of baloney. What ever happened to, "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth"? No one should ever be criticized for giving. Yet this is the · response the U.S. has grown aecustomed to from the interna­tional community: damned if we do, damned if we don't. 
The apathy of the global commu­nity to our disaster is utterly insult­ing to the donations of individual Americans last December. If disas­ter bothered the world in December, why not now? I don't expect a massive global contribu­tion to the Katrina relief effort, but is it too much to ask for acknowl­edh'lllent of our loss, or at least a break in the anti-Americanism? 
Sarah Harward alumna class of 2005 Aug. 31 
Act with respect 
As a 1994 alumna, I write to any of our students who will attend the Pitt game this Saturday. and particularly the ESPN College Game Day broadcast. 
In 2000, when Game Day chose our Nebraska game as its site, I was on set during the broadcast. At the close of the show, Lee Corso predietably slammed on the silliest Cornhusker hat imagina­ble, indieating his pick for the game. Unpredietably, one of our students­green T-shirt and all -threw a plastie beer cup at the stage. It sprayed beer all over Craig Fowler, and he was visi­bly upset. I was humiliated minutes later to be introduced as a Notre Dame graduate, and absolutely furious that one of our own would act so disgrace­fully. 

It is an honor that ESPN chose us, yet again, as their showcase game this Saturday. Treat those men with respect, or this time may be the last. 
Stephanie Joyce alumna class of 1994 Aug. 31 
I know that you will pray for this spe­cial intention and be generous with your donation, and I thank you in advance for your assistance. 
Finally, and on a different topic, I want to offer a word of welcome to the first year students who have joined us for the first time within the past few days. After a full week of class, it proba­bly feels like you have already been here for a long time. But I know that for many of you it is the fulfillment of long held dreams, and for all of you it will be an opportunity to enter into the many­faceted and wonderful realities that makes Notre Dame a family and an out­standing Catholic educational institu­tion. We really are a community of believers and a community of scholars. 
When you get a chance, read the plaque that is in front of the statue of St. Joseph alongside the Old College by St. Mary's Lake. The words contained there are from a letter of Father Edward Sorin, Notre Dame's founder, to Father Basil Moreau, the founder of the Congregation of Holy Cross, shortly after his arrival here. Three things to note are that Notre Dame was placed under the patronage of Mary from the moments of its founding; the Eucharist has always played a special role in the lives of Notre Dame students; and because of these two realities, Notre Dame has been blessed by God and will continue to "be one of the most power­ful means for good in this country." Although Father Sorin did not know it at the time, the University of Notre Dame was then only the latest in a series of missionary efforts on these grounds for over two hundred years before he came with the Holy Cross brothers, and all of these efforts were dedicated to Mary.

Maintain perspective 
On the morning of Monday, Aug. 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the mouth of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of up to 140 miles per hour. The potential for such a major catastrophe had not been seen since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. And such worries were justified -Katrina tore through the Gulf Coast, ripping apart buildings and flood­ing numerous areas beyond a livable state. 
Even now, Katrina's effects are still being felt by many in the Southeast. A flood levee in New Orleans suffered a breach the size of a football field, causing floods of up to 20 feet throughout the vast majority of the city. Most of the beachside property of Mississippi cities Biloxi and Gulfport has been either destroyed or severely damaged. President Bush has declared the states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama federal disaster areas. And at this very moment, lives continue to remain in peril. 
The numerous branches of the news media, including news channels such as CNN, MSNBC and Fox News, as well as several larger newspapers like the Chicago Tribune and New York Times, are quick to look past the well-being of their fellow human beings. Instead, they hastily jump into how Katrina will affect the stock market, how oil rigs that have been put out of commission will escalate gas prices, and how Katrina poses a "threat" to the economy. 
It is appalling, even downright disgusting, that today's news media publicizes the "major issues" so heavily to earn the largest piece of the ratings pie, doing so by overlooking the catastrophic damage done to the Gulf Coast and its population. While people are suffer­ing, even dying, due to Katrina, the media argues about the most miniscule of issues that are vaguely related to the storm. I lind this frame of mind immoral, seeing economic and political issues are being placed ahead of the safety of those in the Southeast. 

Now, I'm not saying that these issues shouldn't be talked about at all. I understand that political ramifications and economic issues will be of a high priority at any given time. However, this is not just any given time. This is a time where states of emergency have been declared by state governments across the Gulf Coast. This is a time where relief efforts are most needed. This is a time where humanity should be united, not divided by issues that pale in eomparison to the value of human life. Most importantly, this is a time where people are dying, and we should not hesitate to help them by any means possible. 
The media seriously needs to re-evaluate its priorities. When one places the cost of gaso­line ahead of the sacredness and value of humanity, something is obviously wrong. There is no good reason to even consider doing this. Certainly, ratings are vital to the success of a network or publication, yet this is no reason to overlook and cast aside people who are suffering at the hands of a natural disaster. There is a time and a plaee for everything; now is the time to help those in the disaster area, not bicker over economic problems caused by the disaster. 
Please keep those living in the Southeast in your prayers, and also pray that the news media will see the light and be more sensitive to humanity's well-being.

Staind's latest effort retreads beaten path 


First full album shows Arcade Fire's potential 


By BOB COSTA 
Scene Criric 

When Limp Bizkit front man Fred Durst ushered Staind onto the national music stage in the late nineties with inclusion on the Bizkit-fronted "Family Values" tours and albums. he made Staind lead singer Aaron Lewis a hero to angry nu-metal fans who saw the band as the second coming of Alice in Chains. 
The subsequent success of Staind's breakthrough album "Break The Cycle" in 2001 yielded not only an expanded fan-base and radio hits ("It's Been Awhile" and "Outside") but also numer­ous copycats in the alt-metal genre. Since then. radio has been proliferated by Staind rip-off's like Nickelback, Puddle of Mudd and 3 Doors Down. That's enough maudlin lyrics and 
heavy guitar riffs posing as serious alternative rock to make Eddie Vedder puke. 
Yet on Staind 's recently released album "Chapter V." the band does nothing to revitalize a genre that was really just a revitalization of grunge. Staind sticks to the same formula used on "Break The Cycle" and their 2003 album. "14 Shades of Grey." Even with a wife and two children, Lewis sounds like the same disgruntled twenty­something reading out of his diary. Lewis' lyrics are extremely personal, and the man keeps grudges with old lovers like Nixon kept enemies -he can't seem to let go and embraces the chip on his shoulder. It fuels his music, but at times truly limits the band from moving past the wallowing of their vocalist and songwriter. 
'rhe album's third track, "Paper 
Jesus," is a brooding and heavy nu metal nugget that you'll only enjoy if you can handle the repet­itive thrashing of Staind's detuned electric guitars. which pulsate with fury rather than rhythm. It's a nice break from the rest of the album, which sometimes seems like "The Aaron Lewis Band" instead of a cohesive rock outfit. 
Another factor that diminishes the power of "Chapter V" is that it is just too slick in its production values. This is a band that gained notoriety for releasing a live and acoustic song ("Outside" featuring Fred Durst) to the radio that was gritty and sweltering in its own simplicity. 
At their core, these guys can't bal­ance being Metallica-lite or Nirvana gone metal. They need to be raw. surg­ing through albums and concerts with a miserable intensity. That intensity is heard on certain tracks of "Chapter V." specifically the ballad "Take This" and "Schizophrenic Conversations." a swelling rocker that positions Lewis in a comfortable lyrical position -talking to himself. 
Lewis is a talented vocalist. a fact that even the limited range of his song­writing can't diminish. On "Everything Changes," Staind fans will want to raise their cell phones or lighters dur­ing a show. The band turns down the volume for a bit, letting Lewis sing instead of yelling to be heard over the noise. Since "Chapter V" is presumed to be just the fifth chapter in not only Staind 's career but in the never-ending saga of Aaron Lewis' depression. fans can only hope by the next chapter. the man finds some redemption. 

As music fans witness acts likr Limp Bizkit. Papa Roach and Cold fall out ol' relevance. one has to wonder wlwthPr this may b(' tlw last of Staind. "ChapU~r V" is an a Ibum mad P for t hI' t r u <' bP!ievns in nu-mPtal angst. II' you don't buy into thr precnpts of' th< genre, the album is just an unoriginal take on onP man's sorrow and rprog­nizable thrPe-chord changes.

"Funeral," the first full-length album from the Montreal indie rock band. Arcade Fire. reveals the unusual sound that has won the band a huge following around the world. 
The innovative band uses a variety of instruments and a large number of multi-talented members to make songs that fuse many different types of music. The album is varied. interesting and unexpected. and it. unlike many albums. gets more enjoyable the more that you listen to it. 
The title of the album comes from the fact that several band members experi­enced the loss of family members while making the album. The themes of loss, love and redemption are prevalent in songs like "Une annee sans lumiere" and "In the Backseat." The album's information is even set up to look like the program from a funeral. 
Arcade Fire manages to make the somber themes that pervade their album sound hopeful and uplifting 
while still providing a vivid sense of the emotions about which they sing. 
Songs like "Rebellion (Lies)," "Crown of Love" and "Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)" reveal the soaring choruses, diversity of instruments and building crescendos that makes Arcade Fire stand out from other bands. 
Some of thP songs arr fantastic. but others still sound a littlP rough and seem as though they might bn better suited for live performances. Even with a few weak songs, the album as a whole is still enjoyable and shows a huge amount of potential and enthusi­asm. 
"Funeral" was released in September 2004, and has slowly grown in popular­ity thanks to word of mouth and Internet downloads. While not entirely embraced by the mainstream, Arcade Fire has managed to break out and gain a loyal following. The band has even had the video for their song, "Rebellion (Lies)" appear on MTV2 and were also a featured band on the sta­tion's Web site. Fans can get more information about the band from their Web site, www.arcadefire.com, which features lyrics, photos. biogra­phical informa­
tion  and  tour  
dates.  
Arcade  Fire  

formed around marrind coupl<> Win ButiPr (gui­tar. vocals. bass guitar. keyboard) and Hegine Cha­ussagne (key­board, accor­dion, xylophone. vocals. drums) and eventually solidified its cur­rent lineup in 2004. The band grew to include Hichard Parry (guitar, percus­sion, upright bass. keyboards), Tim Kingsbury (guitar. bass). Will Butler (pr.rcussion. guitar. bass guitar). Sarah N<~ul'r.ld (violin) and .Jnrr.my Gara (gui­tar. drums). 
The band uses a widr. varir.ty of' instruments, and thr.y frequently switch playing duties while performing. They are known for their innovative use of percussion during live shows and use helmets and other unusual objects to achieve a unique sound. 
Arcade Fire has toured around the 

world. and the band was recently invit­ed by U2 to open their Novernb<~r shows in Montn~al. 
Ov1~rall, "Funeral" is much liv1~liN and rnorP optimisti(' than tlw titiP would lr.ad vou to bPliPV<'. and it r<'V<'als a grnat·dPpth of' I'Pr.ling and passion with­in tlw band.

Strong sophomore album cements rapper's status 
By TAE ANDREWS 
Scene C:ririt 
Most rap songs can be sorted and placed into dil"fPrent Jeopardy-like cate­goriPs. I'll take Glorification of Drug I>Paling for 500. piPaS('. Or maybe it'll be llorniridal FirParm Hntnrprise for 200. 
Following Ttwsday's rPinasn dati', hip­hop aficionados can take "Late lll'gistration," for $9.1)9, which, despit1~ its rhronologirally-rhaiiPnged title, show!'d up right on tim!' aftl'r a sumnwr of anticipation. 
;\l"tl'r last yl'ar's n~lnasc of his· first album, "Tiw Collnge Dropout," the answl'r to the question, "Who breaks the hip-hip mold'!" became, "What is Kanye Wl'st"" 
Yes, despite being J\WOL from univer­sity this senwster, the big man on cam­pus is back with his sophomore album, "Late Hegistration." Known for his fresh approach to the rap game, West's inven­tiw bnats and quirky lyrics combine to makn him one of rap's biggest stars. 
Whiln not quite as good as "The Colh~gn Dropout," this is due more to WPst's twing a victim of his own success than any shortcomings on the part of his s1~cond album. The same cross-genre rollaborations. fresh sounds and idiosyn­cratic lyrics -basically, everything that madn his last album so great-are hack. with rww tracks fnaturing, among others, /\dam Levine of Maroon 5, H&B singer Brandy and the rapper Common. 


The eclectic essence of West is evident in the remix of his first single, "Diamonds from Sierra Leone." The track is a strange lyrical amalgamation in which he combines a guilt-ridden jewP! infatuation with a running stream of "who's-the-man" hyperbole. /\II this is v o i c !' d o v n r a s tiHl d i Iy inc rnas i n g crescendo of frenetic chimi~s and Shirley Bassny vocal sampiPS. 
In his first VPrsn, Kany1~ spits social commentary on thP human rights abuses in the South African diamond trade. The second verse is West's testament to his own staying power, as he boldly affirms the continued presence of Hoc-a-Fella Hecords as a force in the industry. 
Of course, having Jay-Z on the remix certainly helps. Jay-Z. the artist formerly known as The Best Happer /\live, shows that he is clearly restless in retirement, as he shows up on the track and steals it wi_th macho lyrics such as, "How could you falter I When you're the Hock of "Gibraltar I I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water I This ain't no tall order I This is nothin' to me I Difficult takes a day I Impossible takes a week." 
West, the self-described Louis Vuitton Don, expresses his love for his wardrobe throughout the album. His conspicuous consumerism makes it difficult at times to tell if he's rapping or reading from name-brand clothing label catalogues. 
Despite all the flashy material­ism, West keeps his feel-good vibe and tongue-in­ch£>ek humor alive as he did on "College Drop­out" to let you know that just when he starts to get too serious, he's just clown­ing, baby. 
West is a mas­ter craftsman on his productions, using the entire 
audio palette disposed to his talented fingers. The overriding musical theme of the album -his ability to pair slamming new-school beats with feel-good, oldie vibes -shines with songs such as "Gone," a track featuring Consequence and gangsta rapper Cam 'Hon and "Addiction." 
As he did on "College Dropout," West again collaborates with actor/singer Jamie Foxx on the song "Gold Digger," where Foxx showcases some of the soul­ful vocal talent he put on display in his role as Hay Charles in the 2004 film "Hay." 
A key element of hip-hop that has been missing in recent years is its emphasis on social justice through social commen­tary. West remains unafraid to use his CDs as a soapbox on which to expound his Western philosophy, as he does on "Crack Music" (featuring Tlw GamP), a song decrying the devastating nffncts of the drug trade. 

Despite his penchant for tooting his own horn, this is what makes Wrst tlw "Crown Prince of hip-hop" -his ability to temper his audio arrogance with self­depreciation via fun, stream-of-con­sciousness lyrical flow. 
All in all, "Late Registration" is a good album and a sound second effort by Kanye West, thereby proving the old adage, "Better late than never."

Phillies blast four homers off Pedro in win 
Hermida grand slam not enough; Pettitte dominant for Astros 
A..sociatcd Press 
NEW YOHK The Philadelphia Phillies overpow­nred Pndro Martinez and rnmairwd on top in the NL wild­card raen. 
Chase Utley hit two of Philadelphia's four homers off tlw Nnw York Mots' aen, Brett Myers pitehod seven strong innings and tho Phillios bounced back from an oarly deficit for an S-2 victory Wednesday night. 
Hyan Howard and Mike l.ioborthal also connoetecl for Philadelphia, which stopped a thrnn-gamo skid and sent New York to its fourth loss in 12 gamos. The l'hillies (71-62) lwgan the day tied with Florida atop the wild-eard standings. 
Martinez ( 13-(>) had a 2-0 cushion at stnamy Shea Stadium and a duuH:e to push the Mots alwad of Uwir NL East rivals ­but he couldn't do it. The four homo runs lw gavo up matched a eamor high, sot twice in con­sncutivo starts for Boston in .Jurw 11JIJS. MartinHz gavo up livn runs and eight hits in seven innings, dropping to 1-3 in his past sovnn starts. 
Mynrs (12-6) allowed six hits and struck out sovnn, improving to h-1 in his last 10 starts. Tie has yinldod only three runs in 14 innings at Shea this season, going 2-0 in two starts. 
One night after blowing a lead, Ugueth Urbina struck out two in a perfect eighth to pre­serve a 5-2 advantage. 
Bobby Abreu added a two-out, two-run double ofT Heath Bell in tho ninth, and Pat Burrell had an HBI single. 
Philadelphia's Kenny Lofton made two over-the-shoulder catches in deep center in the sixth, saving at least one run. 
With the score tied at 2, Lieberthal led off the seventh with his 11th home run. Utley added a two-run shot to center for No. 21 on the year and his third multihomer game this sea­son. 
Cardinals 10, Marlins 5 
Florida's Jeremy Hermida became the first player in more than a century and only second ever to hit a grand slam in his first major leaguA at-bat, con­necting in the seventh inning off the St. Louis Cardinals' AI HeyAs in the Marlins' loss Wednesday night. 
The only other playHr with a grand slam in first major league at-bat was William "Frosty Bill" Duggleby, who did it for Philadelphia at home against thA New York Giants in the sec­ond inning on April 21, 1898, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Elias was not able to determine whether Duggleby was a pinch hitter. 
Hermida, an outfielder whose contract was purchased from Double-A Carolina earlier in the day, was just the third player to hit a slam in his first game, join­ing Duggleby and San Francisco's Bobby Bonds. Hermida batted for pitcher Brian Moehler with Florida trailing 1 0-0 and connected on the third pitch he saw in the big leagues. 
He swung at a fastball, took a ball low, then homered over the right-field wall, a drive estimat­ed at 373 feet. 
The 21-year-old Hermida moved briskly around the bases after the horner, yet after returning to the dugout and slapping hands with several delighted teammates, he did not acknowledge long, loud cheers from the sparse crowd that remained -missing the chance for his first career curtain call. 
Bonds, the father of seven­time MVP Barry Bonds, made his major league debut for San Francisco dn June 25, 1968, and homered against Los Angeles, Elias said. Bonds grounded out in the third inning at Candlestick Park, was hit by a Claude Osteen pitch in the fifth, then homered off reliever John Purdin. 
Only a few thousand people in the announced crowd of 20,656 remained to Hermida's hit. The Marlins' top pick in the 2002 amateur draft and the 11th pick overall, he remained in the game as Florida's lel't fielder to start the eighth inning. 
Astros 10, Reds 0 
Andy Pettitte allowed four hits in seven innings and Brad Ausmus drove in four runs as the Houston Astros beat the Cincinnati Hods on Wednesday night. 
Pettitte (13-9) struck out four and walked one, improving to 10-2 in 14 starts since June 20. The left-handHr lowered his EHA to 2.50, tied with Washington's John Patterson for third best in the National League. 
Jason Lane hit a two-run homer for the Astros, who remained a half-game behind Philadelphia in the NL wild-eard race. 
Brandon Claussen (9-9) lost for the Jlrst time since July 23 against Milwaukee. He had gone 5-0 in six starts sincn, tlw longest win streak by a Heels piteher this snason. 


Claussen allowed only two hits in the first four innings bnl'orn thn Astros bunched livn consne­utive hits to scorn four runs in thn fifth. 
Lance lkrkrnan led oil' with a double and Lane hit his 20th homo run for a 2-0 lead. Chris Burke and Adam Evorntt each singlnd and Ausmus drove them home with a double to right­center. 
Ausmus tried to streteh the hit to a triple and was ealled out on a dose play at third, which man­ager Phil Garner argued. 
Claussen lastnd 5 2-3 innings and allowed four runs on eight hits .

TENNIS 
Several big names advance easily at U.S. Open 
Strong wind gusts and intermittent rain mark day at the Open 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Heat and humidity are expected at the U.S. Open. Ditto for the airplanes that scream overhead on their way to and from nearby LaGuardia Airport. 
But a gusting, swirling wind is something else. 
"I don't think I've even prac­ticed in these conditions," fourth­seeded Kim Clijsters said Wednesday. "It was so tough out there today." 
Gusting up to 36 mph, the wind picked up anything that wasn't nailed down. Plastic bags and hats danced across the courts, and the wind played tricks with even the simplest of shots. 
The only thing that held steady was the draw. Top-seeded Maria Sharapova needed only 49 min­utes for her 6-1, 6-0 victory over Dally Randriantefy, while Clijsters notched another straight-set win -7-5, 6-0 ­over Colombia's Fabiola Zuluaga. Wimbledon winner Venus Williams beat Maria Kirilenko 6­1, 6-3. 
Lleyton Hewitt broke Albert Costa three times in the final set to close out a 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 first­round victory. Gilles Muller couldn't follow up on his stun­ning upset of Andy Roddick on Tuesday night, losing in doubles with American partner Robby Ginepri. 
"It was so windy today," Sharapova said. ''I'm really glad I had a piece of chocolate cake last night, otherwise I would have been blown away. It made me heavier." 
Two-time champ Serena Williams and French Open win­ner Rafael Nadal took the court for the evening matches. 
The first two days of the Open were steamy, with several play­ers struggling. The wind made temperatures Wednesday more pleasant, but brought a new challenge. 
"The wind was definitely a test today," Venus Williams said. "It's easy to fumble and easy to self­destruct in those kinds of condi­tions." 
Added Hewitt, "It was one match you just wanted to get under your belt, get into the tournament and get back into 
·-. 
the locker room as quickly as possible." 
Hewitt had won five of his pre­vious six meetings with Costa, but the two haven't played each other since 2002. No matter. Hewitt raced out to an early lead, dropping only two points as he took the first three games of the first set, and Costa never recov­ered. 
The 2002 French Open winner had only two break points the entire match, and couldn't con­vert either. Hewitt, on the other hand, converted seven of 11 breaks, including three in the last set. He had 23 winners to Costa's nine, and only 17 unforced errors. Costa made 35 errors, double-faulted flve times and had no aces. 
"Today was really, really diffi­cult," Costa said. "I just confmed my rhythm and he was much more confident with the wind, for sure." 
Costa has now lost in the first round at his last five Grand Slam events. He missed Wimbledon with a knee injury that required surgery, and the 30-year-old said after the match that retirement is an option. 
"I want to finish this season and then decide," he said. "If I fmish, I fmish altogether. I can't play only on clay." 
It doesn't seem to matter where Clijsters plays these days. Victories in her last two tourna­ments gave her six titles already this year, best on the WTA Tour. She improved to 51-6 with her win over Zuluaga. 
If she keeps playing this way, Clijsters might finally break through for her first Grand Slam title. 
"Even when I was injured last year, when I started playing again, you get motivated," said the Belgian, who missed the Open last year after wrist sur­gery. "It motivates you to work hard because you know that those girls, they're working every day hard to get back, to be strong. 
"I knew I had to put in twice the effort if I wanted to come back. It's not just one player. It's the whole group that keeps you motivated and hungry to play tennis." 
A day later, the Open was still buzzing about Roddick's loss. 
A champion here only two years ago, Roddick looked as if he was going to cruise to an easy victory over Muller. He was up 5­2 in the first set, and had a chance to serve it out at 5-3. Instead, Muller broke him, then held his own serve. 
Suddenly, it was Roddick on the defensive against the left­bander. 
"I just felt like the whole time, I was trying to find something as opposed to just having it," Roddick said, still looking dazed an hour after the match ended. "Twenty-four hours ago, I was really optimistic about my prospects here. I'm in a little bit of shock right now, to be honest. 
''I'd give anything to go back four hours right now." 
Heaping insult onto the sting of the loss, it was Roddick's 23rd birthday Tuesday. 
"I don't really remember a loss where I've, umm, felt this bad afterward," he said. 
Maybe somebody really did take his mojo. It was the first time Roddick had gone out in the first round since his Open debut in 2000. 
Roddick was seeded fourth and is one of the world's best on finals at a tournament in Los hard courts. Muller, meanwhile, Angeles last month, only to turn is ranked 68th, playing in his around and lose in the quarter­first Open and can, by his own finals in Washington three admission, get a little "crazy" weeks ago. during matches. He beat Nadal But he never got flustered at Wimbledon and reached the against Roddick.

"In tlw past. I knew I was only going to play orw or two s11ries a garnn. Thnrn's not too much pros­surn on you wlwn it's like that," Shorklny said. "This is dill'erent. You know..twnrything is going to lw on you. 
But Shorkley's gratnful team­matns haw his back, determined to make his first -and only ­snason as tlw starter a mcmo­rablt orw. 
'Tm playing this whole s1mson for him," safnty (;rng Blue said. "I don't want pnopl11 to look at him as tlw wason wn losn." 
Shockl11y won his tnammates' implacablt1 rnspnd by dedding to stay at (;norgia li1r his nntire eol­lngt1 cawer, nv1m though he spent most of it barking up David Cn1mw. 
Many other players would have transf(Jrred -after all, Shockley was one of the nation's highest­rated quarterbacks coming out of high school -and the thought did cross his mind. 
In the nnd. Shockley ehose to play for the Bulldogs. Or, most accuratnly, he aeeepted one sea­son as a redshirt and thn11i others as a sparingly used second­stringer behind Greene. 
'That man has my rnspect for staying here," Blue said. "fie carnd about the program. fie carnd about his tnarnmates. We're going to light for him all thn way." 
Shockley will be under intense seruliny the entire season. After all, Greene was the winningest quarterback in rm~jor-college his­tory, leading the Bulldogs to their f'irst Southeastern Conference title in 20 years and three straight Top 10 linishes. 
If the Bulldogs fail to maintain that level of success, Shockley will surely get mueh of the blame. I In got. a tastf1 of the high stan­dards he'll be expeeted to meet in the final regular-season game of 2004. 
Crnenn went to the beneh after spraining his thumb on a lirst­quarter touehdown drive against (;norgia Tech. Shockley took over and directed the Bulldogs to a 16­0 lnad at halftime. 
But he struggled after the break, and Gnorgia Teeh got back in the game with 13 straight points. llaving eornpletod only 5 of I 6 passes _:_ and getting booed by tlw home fans -Shockley went b;u:k to the beneh. 
Sorn thumb and all, Greene led tho Bulldogs to a field goal that sealnd their 19-13 vietory. 
"You try not to worry about what people are thinking,"

"The fans will be fine if' I go out and play a good ballgarne," Shockley said. "I just don't want to do anything to lose the game. Take earn of the ball -that's the big thing -and just be consis­tent." 
There's another faetor that eould rear its ugly head. Shockley isn't the first blaek quarterback at Georgia, but he knows that some fans might view him difl(Jr­ently than they would a white QB. 
'There are people who look at you differently," Shoekley acknowledged. "Tiwre are stereotypes: you're not as smart as a white quarterback, you're not as fluent running the ommse. But that all goes out the window if I'm perlill'ming well. A'i long as we're winning, what can tlwy say'?" 

In his brief appuaranees ovur the last thmu years, Shockley has eomo across mainly as a running quarterback who provided a ehangn of pam to the slow-footl'd Greenu. 
Shockley plans to show tlwrn's a lot more to his game. 
"I don't think a lot of' pnopl11 have a rnally good sensn at all," he said. "They know I ean run, .­but that's all they see sometinws. They don't see when I throw tho ball well. Tlwy'll gnt a ehaneP to see this game. I'm going to run the ball, throw tho ball, do IWnry­thing a quarterback needs to do." 
Shoekley said. "But you want people to appreciate what you're doing." 
Those boos didn't set well with Blue. 
"The Georgia Teeh game really hurt my feelings," Blue·said. "I couldn't believe how people were talking. I dissociated myself from some people after that game. They were saying this and that about him, saying he eouldn't be a starting quarterback. 
"Lnt me tell you this: ILl. can play ft)(ltball. He's a great passer. lie's a groat runner. But people want to judge him off that one game." 
Shockley knows the best way to keep the faithful off his baek.

INDIANAPOLIS -The Indianapolis Colts expected linebacker Kendyll Pope to make a contribution this year, but they'll have to wait at least one more year to see him on the field. 
The NFL on Wednesday suspended Pope for one year after another violation of the league's substance­abuse policy. Pope missed all but two games in 2004 because of a hip flexor injury. 
"We'll do as much as we can to help Kendyll get through this, but it's a situa­tion where he has to satisfY the league," coach Tony Dungy said. "It's not a situa­tion I've dealt with many times." 
Confidentiality rules pre­vent league officials or the Colts from divulging the substance found in Pope's urine sample. 
The Colts put Pope on the reserve-suspended list Tuesday, but the punish· ment wasn't announced until Wednesday. The Associated Press left a mes­sage seeking comment at the office of Pope's agent, George Mavrikes. 
With the suspension beginning immediately, Pope cannot practice or play with the Colts until next August. The length indicates Pope has tested positive for a banned substance, such as 

IN BRIEF 
Finley signs deal with San Antonio Spurs 
PHOENIX -Prized free agent Michael Finley has decided to sign with the San Antonio Spurs. 
Phoenix Suns president Bryan Colangelo said he was informed of the decision by Finley's agent Henry Thomas on Wednesday. 
"Of course we're disappointed, but to Michael's credit, he didn't just take the money," Colangelo said. "He talked about a chance to win, and ultimately he decided to play for the NBA champions." 
The Spurs did not confirm Finley's decision. Spokesman Cliff Puchalski said the team had no comment. Thomas did not return a message left on his cell phone. 
The 32-year-old shooting guard was courted by Miami, Phoenix, San Antonio and Minnesota. Each team sent representatives to Chicago to make a pitch to the veteran guard. Miami was considered the favorite, illegal drugs or alcohol, at least three times since leav­ing Florida State. 
Indianapolis took Pope in the fourth round of the 2004 draft. 
Colts coaches thought Pope fit well in their defense, which favors speed over brawn. Despite missing most of last season and being slowed again during training camp by a shoulder injury, the Colts liked what they were seeing from the second-year player. He had three tackles last year. 
Indianapolis projected Pope as a solid contributor who could add depth to a young linebacking corps, and Pope appeared to be making progress. 
"I thought the kid had a chance to help us," defen· sive coordinator Ron Meeks said. "I feel bad. I really hope he can come around for us." 
Teammates agreed. 
Defensive tackle Montae Reagor said Pope added a physical presence to the Colts' small linebacking group. Middle linebacker Rob Morris, a former first round pick and former starter, said Pope added quickness. 
"I saw him helping us out a lot on special teams and on the defense," Cato June said. "lie's a playmaker. Unfortunately, whatever happened, we're there for him."

ATLANTA-If Terrell Owens has another falling out with the Philadelphia Eagles, he's got his own business to fall back on. 
T.O. has muscled into Atlanta's thriv­ing R&B and hip-hop scene with Dirty South Studios. No, the five-time Pro Bowl receiver isn't getting behind the mike, a la Deion Sanders and other forgettable athletes-turned-singers. Get this, Owens prefers to stay in the background when it comes to music, providing a place where artists can lay down their own tracks. 
"It's an opportunity for artists to perfect their craft," Owens said in an interview with The Associated Press earlier this summer at his studio. "They're getting their grind oh, and I respect that. I want to help them be 

successful." Wells sorry for comments made towards Selig 
BOSTON -Boston Red Sox left-ban­der David Wells apologized Wednesday for comments he made this week criti­cizing commissioner Bud Selig for his handling of baseball's steroid problems. 
"I understand that I was wrong in my statements about these issues and for that I apologize," Wells said in a state­ment issued by the players' association after Wells met with baseball officials. "Now that I have had this opportunity to sit down and discuss the issues, I better understand the procedures that go with steroid testing." 
Wells lashed out at Selig after losing his appeal of a six-game suspension on Monday, saying the commissioner "isn't doing a thing" about steroids. The pitcher, who called Selig an "idiot" in a spring training interview with the Hartford Courant, accused Selig of retaliating for his past comments in handing out the latest suspension.

While Anastasio will once again take care of kickoff returns, a new face-fresh­man David Grimes-will be returning punts this season. 
"I think he's got good speed -he's an agile guy," Polian said. "Obviously, he's a receiv­er, so he's got ball skills. All of those attributes will help him be a punt returner." 
While the selection of a freshman to return punts on national television in his lirst college game raised several eyebrows, Pol ian doesn't believe Grimes' inexperience will be a factor. 
"It wouldn't matter if it was David or anyone else back there, when it's the first game, you're always nervous -whether it be a fifth-year senior or a freshman," Polian said. "No matter how much pressure we put on these guys in practice, you can't recreate the pressure you feel on a game day. We try to create as many high-pressure situations as we can, but ultimately, when the lights go on, it's a little bit different. It's part of the deal."

Harris family safe after Katrina hits hometown 
Irish kick returner's family OK in wake of devastating storm 
By HEATHER 
VAN HOEGARDEN 
Sports Writer 
Two days before his first 

game with the Irish, former 
walk-on defensive back and 
starting kick returner 
Brandon Harris has had other 
things on his mind this week. 
The New Orleans native has 
family where Hurricane 
Katrina hit, a storm reportedly 
has claimed thousands of 
lives. But everyone is okay, 
Harris said Wednesday night, 
saying his family evacuated 
before the storm. 
''I'm not sure what the sta­

tus of our home is right now," 
Harris said. "But my parents, 
sister and grandmother are in 
Shreveport and they'll know 
pretty soon about our house." 
Harris said although he doesn't know about his house, he is most concerned with his family being all right. 
"It's on the west bank," he 

said of his house. ''I'm not 
sure what that area's like now, 
but I heard there were some 
problems with the levee sys­
tem breaking. I don't know if 
the levee broke by our house 
or what the water level is 
around there, but I'm hoping 
my house is OK. But most 
importantly my family is OK. 
My sister was telling me [it] 
may be a couple of weeks 
before they can go back." 
Harris said he will continue 

to try to keep his mind on 
preparing for Pittsburgh the 
next few days. 
"It's pretty tough," he said. 

"I just have to stay focused ­
keep my mind on what I'm 
doing." 
Dress list finalized for Saturday 
Irish head coach Charlie Weis said Wednesday that he had finalized the list of players going to Pittsburgh, filling out the 15 spots he said were open for players to earn. However, since Notre Dame is independent, the Irish can dress as many players as the coaching staff deems neces­sary. Weis said it would be about 70 for Saturday's game. 
"We've filled up the bus," 

Weis said. "Those guys knew

that the only way they were going to get on the bus is if the tempo was picked up. We had enough guys to go to the game without them, but we've filled the bus." 
At least five of the 15 spots are filled by freshmen, Weis said. He also said he is taking four players from the scout team after initially wanting to take two. 
"I leave some travel spots for the scout team players of the week," Weis said. "The 
chances they play in a game are very, very small. But I think if a guy goes and busts his butt all week, he deserves to travel just as much as those guys playing every down." 
Designing in advance 
Weis said he figures out what plays he is going to run before the game, although he doesn't script too much because it makes it harder to adjust to the defense. 
"I don't script 25 because I don't think you can stick to 25 plays," Weis said. "I think that if you script to 25 it doesn't give you a chance to react to what they're doing and all of a sudden it's halftime and you haven't made any adjust­ments. 
"I try to keep it to about 15. And there's times when it's not working I don't get through those 15 either." 
Under the lights one more time 

Tonight the Irish will prac­tice from 7 to 9 p.m. under the lights of Notre Dame Stadium. It will be their last practice before the season opener. 
"[Tonight's] going to be tone it down and key it up before the game," Weis said. ''I'm not out there to kill them tomor­row. I want there to be no excuses to how fresh we are."

against St. John's. 
Scoring goals is no recent discovery for the Texas native. 
In two seasons at Allen High School, Hanks scored 47 goals. And while with the Dallas Texans club team, the freshman earned two USYSA Golden Boot awards. 
She was also the leading scorer on the Under-19 National team, scoring 22 goals in 30 games. 
Hanks could not be happier about how this early part of the 2005 season has gone, both from an individual point of view and also how she has worked with her teammates. 
"It's just awesome to get what I've got so far and gotten done," Hanks said. "But I couldn't have done [so well] without my team­mates. So I have to thank my teammates for everything they did for me too." 
-
Hanks is also excited to be part of such a strong team that has achieved so much already, but she realizes the added pressure that it puts on her to live up to expectations and perform well on the field. 
''I'm really excited that I came here and got to join the national championship team," Hanks said. "It also puts pressure on you to continue to do well, and hopefully repeat. 
"Its awesome but its also nerve racking as well, I still have roles to step up to." Such roles 
so as long as we 
can both work together and stuff, and with the other forwards then it will be better." 
Despite Hanks' accomplish­ments early on this season, Hanks, who joined the team last spring after training with the 
U.S. Under-19 team last fall, feels that she has adjusted well to playing with the Irish. While she still has a lot to learn, she is com­fortable with the progress she has already made in the young season. 
"I think I've adjusted pretty well, I mean obviously I still have a lot to improve on and a lot to learn but I think from a transi­tion point of view I've done pretty well," she said.

legs during the two overtimes. The forward then recorded two shots on goal against the Wolverines. 
Besler did not see action against New Mexico, but entered the Michigan game at the beginning of overtime. The midfielder made the most of his opportunity, finding Ian Etherington for the game winning goal and his first col­legiate assist. 
The strong early play of these freshmen came as no surprise to Clark. The coach knew entering the year that he had a talented group of newcomers. 
Traynor starred at Francis Howell North High School in St. Charles, Mo., earning all­state honors his junior and senior year. Clark has been extremely pleased with Traynor's poise in his first two games. 
"Jack's just very calm and very cool," Clark said. "He makes good decisions with the ball. He's just a smart player." 
Like Traynor, Dike also gar­nered all-state honors in his senior year of high school at Edmond North High School in Edmond, Ok. His most impressive performance may have come in the state cham­pionship game of his junior season. With his team trailing 1-0 
size gives him a 
distinct advan­tage at the forward position. Clark agrees with the fresh­man's assessment. 
"He's fast and he's strong," Clark said. "He gives us something that maybe we haven't had up front -a big strong attacking threat." 
Not to be outdone, Besler also enters Notre Dame with a stellar resume behind him. He led Blue Valley West High School in Overland Park, Ks. to the 2005 state title and received all state honors. StudentS portS occer. com named Besler the 16th best midfielder in the nation for last year's senior class. Clark liked his strong and heady play against Michigan. 

"Matt came on and was brilliant actually in the game against Michigan," Clark said. "He played smart and sensi­ble soccer. It was great to see him get the assist on the win­ning goal." 
But the early success has not come easy for the fresh­men. Each player has had to deal with the significant jump in level of play from high school and club soccer to the collegiate game. 
"It's a whole different game," Dike said. "You've got to play faster. You've got to think quicker. It's not club soccer anymore." 
Besler echoed Dike's state­ment, saying he didn't realize how significant the adjust­ment would be. 
"Obviously everyone says it's bigger, stronger, faster, but you don't really realize it until you get up here," Besler said. 
The three players are pleased with their early accomplishments, but remain focused on team goals. The Irish coaching staff expects to receive continued strong play from the trio along with con­tributions from the four other members of the freshman class -defender Kyle Dagan, midfielder Cory Rellas and goalkeepers Andrew Quinn and Luke Seibolt. 
"If we're going to win the national championship, we are going to need eighteen players that are going to con­tribute, not just eleven," Clark said.

Fresh and kicking 
Kerri Hanks netted 
seven goals in herfirst 
two games this year 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN Associate Sporrs Ediror 

In the first two games this sea­son, Notre Dame dominated its opponents 11-1 and 6-0. Not sur­prising, considering the defend­ing national champion Irish return 13 out of 15 starters. 
What is surprising. however, is that much of that offense in the first two contests came from a player who was not a part of last year's squad. 
Freshman Kerri Hanks scored seven goals in the first two games, and because of that. she does not need to worry about being the new girl any longer, 
Then again, to those who fol­low the Irish program, that's the last thing Hanks has ever been. 
The Notre Dame forward recently was named the Big East player of the week after her weekend series in Vermont. She was also named the Soccer America player of the week, as

Frosh set the pace for Irish 
By KEVIN BRENNAN 
Sporrs Writer 
Bright Dike appears out of place on the soccer field. Notre Dame's speedy six­foot-one inch, 195-pound freshman forward looks 
better suited for the grid­iron than

Irish focus on the details 
Coaches predicting special teams will make impact at Pitt 
By MATT PUGLISI Associate Sporrs Ediror 

With all the focus on new Irish coach Charlie Weis. an offense loaded with return­ing starters and a defense ­particularly the secondary ­riddled with inexperience, special teams have been lost in the fray as the Irish get ready to kick off the season Saturday night in Pittsburgh. 
"I told everyone from the time I've gotten here how important I've felt the role of special teams were at this place," Weis said at the end of training camp. 
Leading the Irish special teams unit against the Panthers will be running back Travis Thomas. 
"The runaway choice by the coaching staff for the 

special teams captain was Travis Thomas, and he'll become a tri-captain for the first game against Pittsburgh," Weis said. "He's playing on all of our cover­age teams, he's done a great job, showed a lot of tough­ness, and I think that he exemplifies what I've been looking for in special teams players." 
With all the changes sur­rounding Notre Dame foot­ball, Weis will be sticking ,with many of last season's key contributors. 
A year after D.J. Fitzpatrick hit 11-15 field goals and posted a 41.8-yard punt average, he will once again handle the kicking and

Young Belles squad looks for leadership 
Loss of seven seniors offset by welcome return of head coach 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 
The greatest threat most col­legiate athletic teams confront does not come from the oppos­ing sideline or bench. It comes from within. It is the loss of 
senior lead­ership and experience that comes with the end of every sea­son. 
With the departure of seven sen­


iors from Orr last year's team, the Belles must come to grips with this fact and rely on new leadership and an influx of young talent. The women will look to improve on a solid 10-6-1 record (9-6-1 in MIAA play). 
Seniors Carrie Orr. Shannon Culbertson and Maura Schoen arc set to lead the charge, joined by six key returning juniors. Underclassnwn will have to play a large role in propelling the Belles to victo­ry. 
Sophomores Sarah DuHrec and Justine Higgins will cou­ple with incoming freshman Lauren !linton, Whitney Fron and Mandy Thomson to set the pace for a new season. 
"We have a very young team. so basically we're going to have to set a whole new tone," Orr said. "The leadership is going to be spread out a lot more evenly. The underclass­men are really stepping up." 
The Belles are shifting their game-plan drastically from last year. In order to generate
