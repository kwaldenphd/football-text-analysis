Observer editor Bach resigns Publication suspended 
The Observer is suspending publication with this edition ­but it is not dead. 
Observer Editor Dave Bach resigned late yesterday evening. He cited as reasons for his resignation the difficulties in putting out a quality newspaper with the limitations and pres­sures placed on the present staff. 
Bach pointed out that The Observer needed professional help in training writers and other personal. He also felt that the paper had grown too fast and that the pressures of daily publi­cation had limited the ability of upperclassmen editors to direct and counsel underclassmen. 
Observer Publisher Guy De Sapia pointed out that The Ob­server has been forced to con­tinue to publish five days a week in order to avoid financial disas­ter. 
De, Sapia pointed out that editors in the past two years have not been able to evaluate the question of the frequency of publication on its merits. The decision was always based on the need to publish five days a week in order to attract the adver­tising needed to survive. 
Meeting late last night, the editorial board of The Observer decided to suspend publication until the faculty advisory board of the paper could meet to give the staff advice on procedure. 
The editorial board pointed out that the following problems would have to be solved before publication could resume. 

First, the advisory board will have to select a new editor for the paper. The position is open to any student from St. Mary's or Notre Dame. Application can be made by submitting a state­ment of intent to: The Observer Board of Directors, Box 11 , Notre Dame. 
Second, consultations will be 

THE OBSERVER was born on November 3, 1966. It was published sporadically twice a week for the remainder of the year. Twelve editions in all 
Under Editor Pat Collins, THE OB­SERVER began to assert itself in its second year. It came out twice a week, then three times a week. The last two weeks of the year under newly-appointed editor Bill Luking the paper began daily publication. 
Under Luking, THE OBSERVER pub­lished daily during the 1968-69 school year. 
It also published football specials on the Saturday's of home football weekends. The paper has not missed a daily publication date since that time. It also inaugurated basket­ball and hockey program specials for hom,e games last year. 
SMC OC housing approved 
by Kate Cassidy The Saint Mary's College Stu­dent Affairs Committee last night passed an off-campus hous­ing policy giving juniors, seniors or students over 21 the right to move off campus in the coming year. The exact proposal of the Committee reads as follows: "-Any student who is a junior, senior, or over 21 has the right to live in off-campus housing by making application with the Director of Housing. The parent's permission must be pre­sented to the Director of Hous­ing at the time of the application if the student is under 21. -If however, the junior, senior or student over 21, who has already registered a room on campus decides to move off, she cannot do so until her bed is filled. -Responsibility for the con­dition, location, and legal as­pects of the housing will be assumed by the student ( or the student and her parents if the student is under 21 ). The add­ress of the off-campus residence must be registered with the Di­
rector of Housing." 
Debate centered around the question of the protection of the college in the event that too many students would decide to move off-campus, and dorms were not filled to capacity. 
The Committee finally decid­ed to preface the bill when it is presented to the Student Affairs Council with the assurance that the policy will be re-evaluated next year. 
made with members of the Notre Dame Department of Communications Arts and with other officials of the university to determine whether profes­sional aid can be obtained in helping to set up the staff. Ef­forts will also be made to obtain academic credit for Observer person ell. 
Third, a decision would have to be made as to how frequently the paper will be published. 
Fourth, efforts will be made to establish a sound financial basis for the paper in order to eliminate frequent concern over the paper's ability to publish for financial reasons. 
An executive committee of

Currently The Observer suf­fers not only from staff and professional journalistic pro­blems but also from its lack of financial stability.

The VOICE -Thursday, October 17, 1966 
"The VOICE was created to act as a medium for the expression of student thought and activity. It sought no more than to shed a true perspective on Notre Dame and its student body, a perspective filled out with the humor and insight that only partici­pation brings." 
"To find the men to put out the paper once a week had been hard enough. The strain of twice weekly publication made it almost impossible to find enough good men to cover the news of Notre Dame. As a result, The VOICE often went to press the final product of a small group of dedicated men. 
This was caused not only by the burden of frequent deadlines, but also by the lack of training available for the members of the staff. Dedication is a virtue that can carry a venture only so far." 
"In spite of the magnitude of these obstacles, The VOICE has still managed to exist. It didn't always appear regularly ­lack of money, news and newsmen often necessitated dropping an issue. The amazing thing to many of its cynical followers was that The VOICE would always come back." 
"Men interested in doing something for Notre Dame put all they had to see that Notre Dame produces one of the best collegiate newspapers in the country. 
a student's account to obtain the necessary funds. The Observer had hoped to obtain between $1Q,OOO and $12,000 from the fee. Although this sum would be enough to enable The Observer to continue to operate it is not enough to allow The Observer to obtain the equipment needed to put out a 
daily paper that looked pro­fessional. 
De Sapia contrasted The Ob­server's financial aid from the university with that which The Scholastic receives. The Scholas­tic,· which is an official univer­sity publication receives an an­nual subsidy of $58,000 from the university. The sum comes out of tuition fees collected. Part of the sum goes to financial aid for the editors of the maga­zine. 
De Sapia pointed out that half the sum which The Scholas­tic receives would be more than enough, when coupled with ad­vertising revenue to allow The Observer to operate safely. 
He noted that currently no

The new salute to the flag at football games is an attempt to show "more than just one facet of the world community.," says Dave Krashna, Student Body President. The new ceremony was inagurated last week to make the salute a true affi;ma­tion of devotion. 
Rev.. James Burtchaell, Pro­vost, emphasized that the new procedure is not intended to exclude the ROTC from the presentation, but rather to in-elude people and groups who are equally deserving of the honor. Krashna told of his reluctance to make the military aspect the sole object of the ceremony. 
According to Fr. Burtchaell the idea has met with the ap~ proval of the ROTC, and, over­all, there have been no objec­tions form any side.

Both Burtchaell and Krashna hope that the new procedure with emphasize not only the significance of the occasion, but also the fact that the flag repre­sents more than its traditional association with the military. 
The Editorial board wishes to apologize to any members of the staff who could not be contacted last night to be informed of the decision. 
Members of the Executive Committee can be contacted for information about the paper. The paper's business offices will be open as usual.

SL C fails to act on Judicial Code 
by Greg Pudhorodsky 
The Student Life Council met last night in the Center for Continuing Education in an un­successful effort to redesign the Burtchaell Proposal for resub­mission to the Board of Trus­tees. The Burtchaell proposal, which concerns the estab­lishment of a student Judicial Code, was defeated in the spring session of the Board of Trustees. 
The substantial extent of the meeting was spent in discussion of a recommendation by Profes­sor Edward Vasta that "the final disposition of all cases (that come before the Judicial Board) are subject to Presidential re­view." Vasta continued that the added amendment should pro­vide that if "the President or his delegate disagrees with the final disposition of any case that they should meet with the judicial body last involve<l m the case." If disagreement persisted that fmal decision would rest with the President. 
As originally written the pro­posal gave the Dean of Students the right to appeal a student's case after a private trial. Such an appeal could follow whether the student was found guilty or in­nocent of the offence. Vasta argued that "a Code which in­vites a student to seek private trial from his adversary would app~ar to mock justice." 
The discussion which followed the proposal was ex­tensive. A few of the members of the Council expressed the view that despite the fact that 
any judicial decision which lacked the Administration's backing would be weak and de-

Muskie in Senate race 
AUGUSTA (UPI)-Maine's senatorial contest is regarded as a step toward the White House for Sen. Edmund S. Muskie. 
How big a step depends on his margin of victory over his Re­publican contender, Neil S. Bishop, self styled "dirt farmer" turned high school teacher. 
Muskie, THE Democrat's 1968 vice presidential nominee, is expected to defeat Bishop for a third term. There are no "ifs," "ands" or "buts" about that, in the reasoning of the pros. The big question is: by how much? 
The size of the vote Muskie gets could bear heavily on his presidential aspirations for 1972. Going into the November elect­ion, the 56 year old Muskie is rated a frontrunner for his par­

REFLECTIONS 
On Msgr. John J. McGrath 
In the current push for student participation in campus government, the vital relationship between the faculty and the administration often takes. a background position. 
Several SMC faculty members were asked for their evaluations of Msgr. John J. McGrath's two-year administration, and for their opinions as to what qualities the new president of SMC should 
possess. Sr. Franzita Kane, of the English department, said that Fr. McGrath tried to tackle the problc~m of the relationship of Catholic colleges and univer­sities to the religious orders that sponsor them. She said that he had an interest in clarifying the situation in terms of both canon and civil law, and that he prepared a document to be used as a guideline for this clarification. 
Sr. Franzita said·that Fr. McGrath believed in 
the principles of the American Association of 
Univeristy Professors (AAUP) including those wn­
cerning student rights and academic freedom. He was a leader in the movement to clarify these issues on the campus. "He was optimistic that the Christian community was the way to proceed." 
Fr. Raymond Runde, C.S.C., a faculty member 
in the education department and a close friend of 
Fr. McGrath's, said that the late president favored 
a more open curriculum and the all-college major 
and that he saw a distinction between the kinds of 
education that should be provided for men and 
women. 
He also believed in a concensus of opinion in 
order to act, but Fr. Runde added that some 
problems required a single decision. Fr. Runde ~:aid 
that Fr. McGrath opened the concept of the 
community working together and cited his eff<>rts 
to get students on various administrative 
committees. 
He added that the late president had a healthy 
rapport with Notre Dame and that he and Fr. 
Hesburgh were able to talk on a "man-to-man" 
basis. 
"He had no concept of caste," Fr. Runde 
observed. "He would tell a student what he would 
tell the faculty. He couldn't say anything he didn't 
believe...he couldn't bring himself to pretend."' 
Fr. Runde said that, if given the time, Fr. 
McGrath would have made St. Mary's a financially 
independent institution and would have obtain1~d a 
high quality faculty. He said that the Monsignor 
enjoyed being president of the college and that he 
"liked the girls and was proud of them." 
He commented that the new president should 
he__ aware of the academic situation and faculty 
;>roblems and have the courage of his convictions. 
He added that a member of the clergy would be better equipped to deal with the religious order and with Notre Dame than a lay president. 
Dr. Anthony Black, chairman of the SMC faculty assembly and a member of the history department faculty, described Fr. McGrath as having a "genuine sense of Christianity." 
"He was an orthodox Catholic theologian, which is not found here or at Notre Dame with great frequency." 
Dr. Black said that Fr. came to the college presidency at a moment when "we needed a man who could take an independent position ...he was a positive factor in our existence." 
Dr. Black pointed out that the late president was faced with a situation of transition --between the religious orders and the colleges and between SMC and ND. 
He said that Fr. McGrath had no time to make many specific moves and that his contributions were not as measurable as, for example, the erection of a new building. 
Dr. Black added that he did take a stand when necessary because "the buck stops there" -at the college presidency. 
"He was a victim of his times...and limited circumstances." 
The new president, Dr. Black commented, should be "committed to the idea that there is a place in the 20th century for an undergraduate liberal education in a Catholic framework for 
·women." 

Dr. Mark Bambanek, of the SMC chemistry department, observed that the Monsignor e:;ta­blished the concept of community at St. Mary's­"he got the wheels moving." 
Dr. Bambanek said that the late president was scholar and that he was "forced to spend time on things he liked less. The administrative and finan­cial end of it was part of his job. 
"He liked people and had planed this fall to go back to the classroom." 
Dr. Bambanek commented that Fr. McGrath was faced with what the chemistry prof calls "academic inertia," a resistance to change because change is not always identified with progress on the college campus. Fr. McGrath was confronted with outright opposition by some faculty members when he worked to include students on commit­tees, Bambanek said. 
"He tried to benefit the whole school. There was bound to be disagreement. 
"He was possibly the most human college president I have ever known, with all the connota­tions of human weaknesses and human strengths.

Wake Up, Hanoi 
:::::::====================================::::::===================:::::::::::::::::::::::: 
Walter s.c.:t 

Frank Borman's return from his round the world jaunt. and his 
subsequent report to the Senate raises up once more the· issue of 
American prisoners held in North Vietnam. The International Red 
Cross is not allowed to visit them; there are many wom~n in this 
country who are in limbo concerning their loved ones; and rumor 
has it that their treatment makes the tiger cages at Khe Sanh seem 
like a minimum security prison by comparison. Regardless of what 
position one takes concerning the American role in Southeast Asia 
these are_ people; and people, regardless of their criminality o; 
whatever must be treated with a certain respect for their humanity. 
'!he Senate unanimously agrees, however, that there is very little 
which can be done -unless students do it. The moral imperative for 
students to take an action wherein they inform Hanoi that any 
movement in the improving of treatment of prisoners will make the 
peace effort more credible should be obvious. Washington seems to 
be convinced th.at a letter writing campaign from Hanoi's closest 
allies in this country would have to do some good. 
I say let's take them up on it...but with a new twist. Students 
should write Hanoi. But they should do it at the most opportune 
time possible -now before the elections. 
From here, they should canvass Middle Class America with 
petitions saying something to the effect that we respectfully request 
that Hanoi improve the treatment of American prisoners. But, here's 
the rub. 
We do it for peace candidates. The whole effort should be 
extremely partisan to get doves and other liberal elements into 
Congress. 
How can John and Jane Middle Class America backlash against 
clean cut students who are circulating "tell it to Hanoi" petitions? 
At the same time that these are being circulated we distribute 
literature and campaign for the candidates who will' get at the root 
of the fact of these prisoners. 
. We are not only going after the immediate problem-prisoners of 
war, at the same time, we are going to the root of the problem ­
American involvement in Southeast Asia. 
This type of activity educates the voters about student's attitudes ~hows that students are willing to make a show of goodwill, and rna; JUSt counteract Spiro, John and Martha Inc. 
Obviously, if Hanoi would show it's bit of goodwill say on 
November I or so by releasing, at large, the names of some prisoners, 
the result could be best described as trading letters for votes. 
From there, John Mitchell and Spiro Agnew can take their incindiary, backlash-provoking, radiclib rhetoric and cram it into whichever orifice of their bodies they feel it would enter easiest. 
The point is to tell it to Hanoi when America is listening. 
******** 

lobbying at large: 
those people who oppose the Princeton Plan because students "would be used" are engaged in paternalistic dreaming. Let the students learn for themselves. 
Those who say the University should not become political should read Machiavelli who says that war is the extension of politics. From there, let them cut off all the University's ROTC programs, war research, etc. 
Those who claim such a move is arbitrary should look at our spring calendar where we have a spring break for no reason. At least here is _the possibility that the time will be used as a furthering of the education for those who get involved in the election process. _ See you at campaign headquarters.

Homesickness 
Observer s.,~ate Phantom 
I suppose that it's reasonably safe to assume that a multitude of you studious beings are plagued by the old ailment of homesickness. This dreaded affliction is not reserved soley to the freshmen. The upperclassmen also suffer from this disease. The only difference is that the upperclassmen like to brag about having this "communicable disease," while the freshmen don't even know what one is. Knowing how you snivelling fools feel, I believe I ought to clue you in on a few of the known cures fc>~ your malady. 
One of the most common medicines is a sim1>le little thing that requires little or no intelligence, which should thrill the majority of you. Simply rip all of your name tags out of your wardrobe and then sew them in backwards. This bit of idiocy will frustrate you when the realization strikes, that you will have to tear all of them out again and sew them back in properly. This little exercise of appendage agility should take you anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 years, depending on the seriousness of your illness and 
your stitching ability. 
A more advanced cure for the more advanced sufferer is one of the old family 
favorites. All you do is go out and marry the first girl yousee. What could be easier? Since I enjoy this job, 1 won't tell you what could be easier. Anyway, now that you're married, you have someone to do your home cooking, type up your papers, and sew your nametags back into you clothes after you've torn them out. The only problem with this solution is that some guys read the cure a little too loosely."...the first girl that you see. ." Consequently, some nearsighted fellows have married female armadillos, girl-type groun1 sloths, and, in one strange ca~~. a female king penguin. Some guys just won't learn to read caretully. Everyone knows that a king penguin can't sew. 
For extra-quick relief, you can call the overseas operator and ask her to connect you with the piers in Lisbon, Portugal. When someone answers, you calmly inquire as to how the sardines are running. As soon as he begins to answer, that's your cue to hang up. The only drawback to this antidote is that it will cost you between $35 and $429.67, depending on whether you desire to know the quality of the blue crab meat, in comparison to prior years. 
For the super-intelligent homesick victim, there is a real cerebrum-cruncher. All you have to do is to count from 1 to 10 in Lithuanian. That might sound extremely simple, but just see how long it takes you to get a hold of an Elementary Lithuanian book. Once you find the text, it's all downhill. Of course, you run the risk of being nominated as a candidate for the booby hatch, for walking around in public and 
coon~g~ml~lOinW~an~,m~~q~~~dasa¢~o.
The last gasp is perhaps the best. Go home. See the fam. Have anything you want to eat. Go over to your HTH's house and mess around. The only stumbling block is that you most probably can't have girls in your room, or hootch on your breath. I guess that's what home is really all about.

Are you already discouraged about the quality (or lack of such) of the food at the Huddle, the cafeteria, dining halls, etc? Are you on an acid trip -with your own excess stomach acid? Do you get brownies from home -· an use them for diamond utters? Is intravenous feeding looking more attractive to you with each passing day? C'mon now, it isn't the food as much as the atmosphere on campus which gets you down! You have an all-American city at your disposal, a cultural watershed calculated 
o stimulate your mind. It's full of goodies -if you know where to look for them ­which will make your digestive tract sing out, in four part harmony, no less. 
Eating American style is something which every NO man worth his Bromo should try, and our Observer resident gourmets (who eschewed Huddle burgers and sacrificed countless continental breakfasts) set forth recently to choose those places which best portrayed Americana at its hearty best. Here they are, the creme dela creme of River City; bon appetite to you all. 
ARCHIE'S BAR & GRILL (13467 Peptic Avenue). They have a big door handle about four feet above the welcome mat, and if you can open the door, they'll serve. Except when the ABC makes its quadrennial trip to Archies; then you'll be carded. No worry, though. Archie has 20/1000 vision and can't tell a 9 from a 6. One more thing -you must speak up loud enough to be served, for Archie's hard of hearing, too. 
BLACK AND BLUE AVENUE (100 North Mishmash Ave.). The ultimate in "status" in town; even the water costs $1.00 a glass and up. Don't even attempt to read the menu (which is written in algebra anyway), just slip the waiter a $50 tip and ask him to bring him "the usual." What the hell, you're there to impress people, not to fill your greedy belly. 
PIZZA SHACK 12 Uust one mile. off campus -the Purdue campus, that is). This is the only eatery endorsed by an Interhall Frisbee team. Once a m_onth, they order a batch of pies "to go", which are about ten times as unbreakable as the toughest plastic known to science. Whatever pies are left over at month's end are used to make 6-ply snow tires to fight the eternal Indiana winter. 
DREARY'S BREWERY (318 Slurry Boulevard). You've seen the Big "D" in town, perhaps you've even drunk some (probably when you had no beer and had to settle for Dreary's). When you're 21, you can take a free tour of the plant in town where the stuff is brewed. Watch how they use genuine water(?) from the St. Joe River, marvel as they use neither hops nor alcohol, and gape at the sump pump they hand you when you buy a keg of Big "D". The brew is cheap, too; you've probably heard the old expression "a beer tastes on on a Dreary's budget." Such extravagance! 
BURGER BARON (1864 Platinumwood Avenue). This chain of drive-ins was recently awarded the Sinclair Lewis Memorial Trophy for most original substitutes for-meat in their burgers. The competition was rough, as seventeen other chains laced their wares with everything from rat tails to mucilage. But the Baron, an old KP man from way back, outdid them all. (Rumor has it that he's slated to be next manager of the North Dining Hall). He seldom gets complaints from customers and uses his credo to explain it: Dead men tell no tales.

Heavy place, childhood's end. The beginning urges of adolescence are hard on us all. "How many seven year olds want to run away and join the circus?" our reporter asks. I can only guess at the number of people who want to run away and join the circus; I would say nearly everyone who is trying to keep a sense of perspective in a world where a rah-rah little football college in Indiana is seen as "childhood's end" when it is obviously childhood's finest hour, (the happiest years of your life, and don't knock it until you're out on your own trying to feed your kids and put them through four years of blissful isolation). Anyone trying to maintain in a world of doom-wailing prophets who must find cause for deep concern in a place where the deepest thing on campus is the library reflecting pool (and that's nearly always empty.) But don't worry. The circus is dying. In another fifty years, even if we haven't killed

Letters to Uncle Bass 
Dear Sir: 

I would like to object to the article which appeared Monday which tabbed John Barkett as a prospective candidate [or SBP next March. It is not that I dislike John, or object to the fact that he may be running next spring. I do think it is a bit early to start naming people, since this year's government has barely been given the chance to get off the ground, but that is not my purpose here. 
What I must object to is the author's not soveiled attack on Phil McKenna. As a former co-worker, and as a friend, I can 
a pseudo anything. Many. things Phil might have been, but he was not, and is wJt artificial in any way. 
What your correspondent saw as "pseudo-philosophy" was, in fact, a sincere_ concern about the quality of the Notre Dame experience, the goals of the University and Student Government, and the means which adminstration and students used to achieve those goals. I did not always agree with Phil, but I never questioned his sincerity or his dedication to principle. 
The McKenna admininstration was different than any of its predecessors-­and will probably be different than any that follow--and because it was different, it was misunderstood. Out of that misunderstanding came criticism which began almost as soon as he took office, and continued until the day he stepped aside. 
McKenna said in his campaign certain things which all candidates say. The biggest difference was that he lived up to them. He did what he said he was going to do, to the surprise of even some o[us who worked with him. 
Phil's administration was much like the man himself-quiet and thoughtful Rossie's term was characterized by a great activity, but Phil's was a more subdued year. Not that many things weren't accomplished-the establishment of black 
concentrations, the new tighter budgeting system, the increased commitment to minority recruiting, the establishment of a strong community relations program under Student Government, and the first real steps towara co-eaucanon-a study to see what it will entail to reach that goal-were all promised in McKenna's 
platform, and all these promises were delivered upon. StiU, it was a relatively quiet year. It 
took over 40 pages for McKenna to write his platform, and would take nearly that long to describe all [o what was done last year both to the University and to those of us who worked with Phil. For Phil's real contribution was in the way he strove to change attitudes, to make people 
· question where they were going and how they were going to get there. If that sense of questioning never got beyond Morrissey Hall and LaFortune, it is as much the fault of we who worked in Student Government as of McKenna himself. 
I do not want to make this a "Why we should apologize to Phil McKenna because he is such a great guy" letter. So, rather than continue in the vein I've been in, I will conclude very simply. Phil McKenna laid the groundwork for much of the change which we shall see at this University in the next five years, and shook a lot of people out of their previous molds. J am proud to be Phil McKenna's friend, and I am sorry that other people in this University did not get to know him as I did. But most of all, I am distressed that this misunderstanding has led to yet another public maligning of Phil McKenna and I hope I have cleared up some o[it. 
Steve Novak 
No one in his right mind would deny McKenna's sincerity. The contention of the "correspondent" wasn't that 
McKenna UiCin · t want to be _a philosopher, or that he didn't think he was a philosopher, but that he thought he was a philosopher and really wasn't. ONe doesn't become a philosopher by constantly suffering the existential dread. One doesn't become a philosopher by jumping up and down every time one runs across injustice. One doesn't become a philosopher by smoking a lot of cigarettes every time a crisis arises, or by crying. One doesn't become a philosopher by "walking naked at the beginning of the road." Somewhere along the line Mr. McKenna mistook Dionysius for Diognes. He didn't travel any road. He tripped. Right at the beginning.

"He gave people more of a realization that this is their college. They had a part in St, Mary's from the day they walked on this campus -including parents. That will never die." 
Dr. Bambanek said that the new head of SMC should have "vision as an academician" and should be able to see "where St. Mary's as an academic 
· institution should be moving and changing." 
He added administrative ability as a criterion for selection but observed that, although St. Mary's is a business, the product -education -is intangible. 
Dr. Richard Hutcheson, chairman of the SMC philosophy department, found one of Fr. McGrath's greatest contributions to be his efforts to improve the faculty and faculty salaries. 
Dr. Hutcheson commented that SMC needs a president soon "in these critical times." He said that the new president should be a "legitimate scholar in a legitimate academic field with a variety of academic experiences and an acquain­tance with a variety of academic institutions." 
He added "presence and poise" to the list of qualifications to aid the new president in dealing with Notre Dame, alumni and other outside organizations. 
Dr. Bruno Schlesinger, humanistic studies chair­man and a member of the presidential search committee, feels that Fr. McGrath had little time in which to make many changes at St. Mary's. "His second year was overshadowed by what we know now to be grave illness." 
In Dr.. Schlesinger's opinion, Fr. McGrath was "less at home in academic matters" and his training as a lawyer was helpful to him in his efforts to improve the overall structure of the college in the form of community government. 
"He followed the general course of engaging many avenues of cooperation (with Notre Dame) while retaining overall independence." 
Dr. Schlesinger said that the new president should be a man of "proven administrative ability. ..clearly a man of strong academic background.. .with an understanding of students, faculty and the world of books." He added the desirability of a charismatic quality that would make the new college head "more than a functionary, more than an official. 
"It's a lot to be asked." He observed that Fr. McGrath "restored con­fidence in the college at a difficult period" and 
"realized that students, faculty and administration should be gathered" to govern the college to­gether.

Fr. William A. Toohey, Director of Campus Ministry; and the Admissions Committee met with Dr: Peter Grande, Director of Admissions. Many of the admin­istrators are new, and James Cooney, secretary of the board said, "The board was enthusias­
· tic of the grasp these people had of their positions and their pro­grams." 
On Friday the board met with David Krashna and discussed his ideas. Cooney stated that the 
board was leased with the er-

period' with Krashna in which the topics ranged from drugs on campus to social life and co­education. 
Regarding coeducation, Cooney said that he felt that the 
·board would be in favor of continuing the present program as far as was feasible in the eyes of the administrators of both colleges. He also said he had been instructed to develop a better relationship with the SMC Alumnae Board on matters of mutual concern. 
The Executive Committee of the board also selected the re­ceipt of this year's Sorin Award, to be announced at a later date. 
Cooney stated that the major concern of the board was the use . of drugs on campus. Cooney said_ that they are concerned because after the student has been given a great deal of personal responsi­bility, he has become ego-centric and has not developed a concern for his fellow student. The board said that they could not under­stand the reluctance of the stu­dent to leave his own sphere to turn in offenders. 
The board also heard Fr. James T. Burtchaell, University Provost, speak on continuing education and Fr. Thomas E. Chambers, Director of Student Housing, speak on the function of the residence hall in the total picture of university life, said Cooney. 
He also said that since 40% of the 44,000 alumni which the board governs had graduated since 1960 and 60% since 1950, the Executive Committee enter­tained a motion to include younger men in the board. A decision will be given in January, and Cooney said it had a "good chance" of passing.
