Student lobby for ntajori~y age 

by Terry Keeney Staff Reporter 
Student Body Vice-President Dennis <H-Man) Etienne and former Student Body Treasurer Mike Marget have met with In­

, diana college student leaders to form a student lobby. 
The purpose of the student lobby, according to Etienne, is to be a political arm of and or college students in Indiana. 
"The lobby will concern itself with matters of consequence to college-age students," explained Etienne. 
The immediate aim of the lobby smd the primary' goal of H-Man's ocfforts is to lower the age of majority to 18. Such a change would also lower the drinking age from 21 to 18. The lobby will also deal with other youth-oriented legislative issues. 
Despite the rejection of a bill to lower the drinking age to 20 earlier this year by the Indiana legislature, Etienne is hopeful that the new student lobby will effect the passage of the 18-year-old bill sometime next session. He cited the fragmented student lobby for the original bill as the reason for its rejection. 
"With all the different peopole down there in Indianoplis the legislators pr.obably got fed up with all the lobbying for the same issue by an essentially homogeneous group." 

· Etienne believes that, under the ne~ student lobby, efforts to lower the drinking age will meet with I success due to the coordination of 
r lobbying.

The educational lobby will acquaint college students across the state with methods of lobbying and teach them how to mobilize a lobby.

James Zafirau, a grad student in educational Administration will seek the vice-presidential position in the GraudateJ Student Union, not the presidential position he previously considered. 
This new development occured after The Observer published the background and platforms of all the candidates in yesterday's paper. Zafirau has mailed a statement on his switch and his new platform ideas to all the grad students. The election for GSU office is Friday. 

The lobbying arm, comprising two representatives from each member college, will meet twice each year to determine the issues and methods of lobbying. A registered, professional lobbyist inay be hired during the months t.he legislature is in session. 
In addition to the bill to lower the prinking age, the lobby will en­(lorse passage of the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, the landlord-tenant bill, and the proposed state aid to non-public colleges. 
The student lobby is still in the provisional stages and has yet to establish a permanent structure. Dennis (H-Man) Etienne is Secretary of the current tem­porary executive board of the lobby.

A large clock in Lyons' first floor corridor slowly inches to 9:12 as I arrive, not really knowing what to expect. There are a lot of Farley and Breen-Phillips guys both before and behind me as I heave open the heavy wooden door and am greeted by a small group gathered just around the corner of the foyer. 
Moving closer, I see that they're gathered around a set of maps for Lyons Hall and a list of 2'J:l names. Counting nine green marks drawn through some of the names on the list, I noted that least four are friends from Farley, and vaguely remember hearing someone say that so-and-so and so-and-so are moving off-campus because they got such high lottery numbers. 
The small crowd moves jinto a medium-:;'"''U ,me dS more people from 1Farley, Breen-Phillips and Lyons jcin fnen.is. ~-ow mumbling can be heard from the crowd, occasionally ':>rea :inb r;n intelligable speech: 
"We'll go for this 'T' Joe; it's better and if we clon't get it it'll be the same all the way up." 
"Hey! we can take over the whole damn fourth floor!" 
Gone are the accusations of "pimp!" and "unfair" heard only yesterday and the day before concerning the method the pick numbers were determined. No mention is made of the half-hearted attempt at a "boycott" of the room picks. There are no bad feelings towards either the Lyons side or the Farley-BP side; there is nothing but the normal excitement of the annual Grand Central Station-esque tension of room picks. 
"We'll have four guys .... " 
"I'll go for 131 with Pat..." 
"Two-sixteen!" 

The small-to-begin-with Lyons corridor quickly fills up in an­ticipation of the start of the ritual. Movement becomes limited at the core around the map, and in the fringe areas, students begin pacing, mumbling arithmetic to themselves. I make my way through an in­creasingly dense pack of sweating bodies, high numbers and pointing fingers. 
"There's been a change, there's been a change!" some guy comes shouting through the crowd, adding that a room has been made an RA room and is therefore not on the list anymore. He is greeted by a few moans and curses. 
Gary Caruso makes an appearance and quickly proclaim~ himself the organizer of the pick by suddenly beginning to read the riot act, and. the consequences of not conforming, to the mass of unlistening students. He calls for the first name on the list and disappears into a small room with three students. 
"A triple! A triple went first!" slowly begins to sift through the crowd upon the emergence of three grinning guys, followed by a fourth who makes a large green X across a room on one of the maps. Some more guys come in the front door and the crowd is blessed with a cool breeze. 
All thoughts of rebellion against Fr. Riehle and the University are lost in the suddenly-exploded excitement. Lists of room choices replace petitions as the rule of "Thinkjof Number One" takes hold of the students in the corridor, producing a hundred quickie rna th majors and probability equations. Mental curves go up and down as rooms begin to be slowly ticked off and names begin to be buried under hard green slashes. 
"Who the hell's got pick numbe:-twenty?" 
"Who the hell cares? What did he take? What did he take?" 
"Where're you going?" 

"Hell if I know! Whatever I can get!" 
But though the numbers are getting higher and more and more 
relieved expressions appeared, the crowd refused to thin out enough to allow passage, even to the door of the pick room. The press of the crowd gets more and more vicious as guys fight to get back to the now blue,red, green and smudge-marked map to trace the progress of the pick. 
I check my watch and remember deadlines and realize that I must leave. I slowly make my way through the crowd for the last time and make it to the door. The smell of nervous hopes pervades the area as I push open the door and the pick continues. 
"What room went?" 
"348., 

"Aw, goddammit, I wanted that one!" 
"Boy, did I get pimped!"

COMMENT 
April 12, 1973 Page 4 

-P.O. Box Q-
Circle Unwound 
Editor: 
In your recent editorial entitled "The Circle Game," 4-11-73, I became very disgusted with some of the statements that you printed. The first of these is your statement that the vote of the hall councils on the constitution was in compliance with the student vote for Jim Clarke (30 percent) in the recent SBP election. This is not correct since eleven halls voted for the constitution and only eight against. 
And, in fact, there is a good chance that the constitution was misrepresented to some of the eight halls voting no, since six of the eight presidents involved are new to the HPC and unfamiliar with the HPC's workings and potential. 
Secondly, you stated that after all the constitutional work, the people <politicians, as you term them) have finally realized that the students " ... don't care how the government is organized, but just that there is one." But, in fact, what lies behind this quote is exactly what gave birth to a.ll of this constitutional work for the first place, and forms the skeleton behind almost every constitution that was presented. 
Thirdly, you made it sound as if the people <politicians again) involved in these constitutions worked solely for their own personal satisfaction. I, for one, am well into the "senior slide" and would gladly have slid right by this constitutional madness, but I felt obligated to the students in my hall to help the HPC where I believed I could. Therefore, I do believe that the people I have worked with, H­Man, Pat McLaughlin, Kevin Griffin, Jim Clarke and myself acted strictly in good faith to the student body to help them to make this place as great as possible. Your statement, "The politicians have had their fun. They've argued constitutions and executive power and legislative checks to their heart's content..." was un­fair. 
Sincerely, 
Paul Tobin 

That Stanford Pride 
Editor: 
Ever since coming to Notre Dame, I've heard references to Stanford as being a so-<!alled "bad" hall. Frankly, I am a little sick of this tirade which has no longer any basis in fact. 
Stanford has had its problems in the past because of a lack of public space and no real flexability in rooms <Stanford is all doubles). Until the stay \hall system was introduced Stanford was made up entirely of Freshmen so con­sequently Stanford did not have any real leadership. Two years ago Stanford graduated its first sizeable senior class. 
My main reason for writing this is Pentegil 's quote in Monitor stating that he allegedly heard some Stanford residents in the dining hall saying they would no longer do anything for Stanford. I find this hard to believe, if only because of the fact that the Ad­miral has his port of call in the south dining hall and all the "animals" from the Stanford "zoo" eat in the north. 
Frankly, the Admiral and the rest of the people who think as he does can go right ahead and un­derestimate Stanford and the people in it. Someday, they will all wake up to find that Stanford passed them up long ago. Finally, hall spirit is fine, Gentlemen, and if you can get someone to write an article about how wonderful you are, more power to you, but don't try and BS me by trying to say something's wrong with my hall.

President 
Editor: I am not sure exactly what Michael Desposito is advocating in his letter of attack on Father Toohey on April third. He claims .f.ather Toohey lacks a function in expre~sing his opinion on "Viet­n~. Mr-. Nixon, and abortion," since these are not "relevant topics" oi '!part of everyday life" here at Notre Dame. Perhaps Mr. Desposito is unaware just how these topics do affect our everyday life. All he needs to do is to ask any student attempting to receive financial aid for graduate study or trying to land a respeetable job, but finding it most difficult due to the Administration's policies. Or maybe he could talk to fellow students who have freinds or close relatives who have suffered greatly because of Mr. Nixon's policies on Vietnam and amnesty. Surely Mr. Desposito can see how trivial parietal hours and such seem next to matters of deep importance to the entire nation and to every individual student at Notre Dame. Mr. Desposito seems to believe that a university community should be isolated from the

"outside world" and concerned only with its own matters. How ridiculous! It would only be sense­seless and degrading for Father Toohey and other men of his "influence and prestige" to limit themselves only to what happens at Notre Dame. There seems to be enough people here concerned with parietal hours and being forced off­campus, but not nearly enough involved with the national issues.

Confessions 
Editor: 

Now that my role lin the so-<!alled 
constitutional game is over, I 
would like to explain my personal 
motives for my actions during the 
last five months. My hope is that 
people will tend to finally believe 
them now that I no longer 1have an 
involvement withiStudent govern­
ment politics. I do suppose that my 
opponents will still refuse to 
believe my sincerity, but there are 
a few students who deserve an 
explanation. 
I would like to mention, that in 
January Chris Singleton and I decided not to actively seek the office of SBP. We found however, that. certain \people were playing political games that greatly in­volved the both of us. We decided to have some fun ourselves and make everyone think that we were running, but then we would not campaign for the office. However, on the day before the campaign started, Chris and I camE:. to the conclusion that the games people were playing with us and the ones that wewere in turn playing with them were in actuality harming the average student, who was in­terested in living in his dorm again next year and interested in a decent social and academic life. 
With the hope of ridding student government,of these absurd games we presented a plan which would attempt to minimizelthem.We also realized that we, ourselves, had become so involved in these political games that we would have to forfeit our own participation in the new system. 
We took our plan to the students 
in the election and madetherun-off. 
In the run-off we were swindled from a victory by another political move by the losing candidates. Because of this I became more intent to go ahead and present my plan to the students in a more sober 1 way than had presented itself in the election. However, our plan to rid student government of these trite games ended in failure to the same forces that want to continue to play these games. It was much easier for them to get eight halls against the plan than for us to get fifteen in favor of it. The closeness of the ratification vote, itself, is a tribute to the actual soundness of the plan. 
With this note of my personal feelings, I can no longer justify my participationin suchla system that we ~re and .viii be left with because of the defeat of my system of government I thank everyone who saw the same absurdities and foolishness as I did for their strong wpport of my views. 
Thank you, 
Jim Clarke 



the apri I fool 


There are times when I think I could have made it as a street preacher in Gomorrah. There are days when I think I could have been a faith-healer in the Ozarks, nipped by serpents, saved by grace. There are moods when I want to but a revival tent, pack Darby O'Gill and myself onto the backs of mules, and the two of us would become the wandering gypsies of Jesus, evangelizing the heathen. There are nights wehn I feel I have the courage to mount a soap box in Times Square and hurl the thunderbolds of redemption at the pimps and harlots. On April mornings, there is nothing I cannot do. I can stand at the foot of the Cross, a faithful witness to the Lord's suffering. I can be lifted onto the nails of my own crucifixion out of love for the Lonely Figure on the central Cross Who cried, "Today, thou shalt be with me in Paradise,.. I can even raise the dead to life through a fierceness of love that costs the dark angel all his victories. 
Because it is nearly Easter, I imagine I can do all these things. These are the fantasies induced by the euphoria of spring. Ifl were a\rogue,l might collect my fantasies from Playboy, If I were a moonbeam, I might dream of being a star. But since I am a cleric, my need is to become a super­priest. My urgencies lie in doing God's errands better than anyone else has ever done them ; and in the secrets the heart tells to the mind, there are murmurs of messianic longings. 
self-image 

But in all the stories I know of myself, the self-image is either shabby or ridiculous. 
A. Saint Mary's Athletic Program? It may be lilard to believe, but this spring will bring th~ debut of one new team, while two esJablished ones continue. The St. Mary's F~ncing team posted a winning 3-2 record ~fs year and is looking forward to next yEiar; both the tennis and golf teams are warming up for their first spring of com­Ptttition. 
tennis team 

The tennis team was established last 
O~tober and has played only two meets so 
far ,losing to Kalamazoo College but beating 
the Notre Dame women's team. The 22­
number team has been practicing at the 
Mi1'hawaka Raquet Club while awaiting 
spring and the completion of the resurfacing 
of flhe courts near McCandless Hall. 
The resurfaced courts will allow the team 
to host other woman's teams from the 
Michigan and Indiana area, including 
Kalamazoo, Valparaiso College and 
Once in a restaurant in Greenwich Village, a young man dressed in the toggery of a motorcycle rider came face to face with me in a passageway to the restroom; wor­(l)essly and without hesitation, he spit in my eye. It was not my eye that had offended him, I was sure of that; it was my collar. My impulse was to go after him, pick him!Up by the scruff of the neck , and say, "You young son of a bitch! How dare you insult the church! How dare you think that I will not defend the priesthood that 1\love!" I think I shold have shaken him until his bloody teeth fell out; and then I should have set his backside on the ground and preached Jesus to him until his ugly cyncism was as thoroughly dislodged as those bloody teeth. 
Instead of manhandling him, I went back to my table and drank Manhattans. 
Graham and Grifftn 
I don't think Billy Graham, in similar circumstances, would have gone back to his table and drunk Manhattans. That is why Billy Graham gets to eat breakfast with Nixon in the White House. That is why I never get invited to the White House; but to tell you the truth, if I were to eat breakfast with Nixon, I would really need those Manhattans first. 
Graham has courage, if not taste. Griffin has his drinks mixed with bourbon and agnostic spitters go unrebuked u; the restaurants of Greenwich Village. "0 What a life, 0 priest of Jesus Christ!"

M)ichigan State. If the recommendation of tl~e Planning Committee for Campus Life and Recreation is accepted, the team will get an indoor facility including a gym, swimmingpool and recl"eational center. 
lrne new facilities will enable the college to,oompete in intercollegiate competition in basketball and volleyball; they will also give St. Mary's students an opportunity to play handball, paddleball, creative dance, and free movement. The facilities will help expand the St. Mary's Physical Education program. 
golf team 
The Saint Mary's golf team will make its debut on April 28, when it travels to Purdue for an 18-hole tournament against Purdue and other Indiana schools. Organized this year by Nell Freewin, the team is presently under the direction of Sister Kathy Reichert and consists of Livy O'Neill, Janet Schleismann, Jane Rupp, and Nell Freewin. 
;tool three paces away sat a lady who was obviously drunk. I paid not attention to what she was doing until finally, she leaned over and siad: 
"What is your name?" 
.. "Robert," I said, in my slavishness to the truth. "Robert," she said, "what do you do?" "I am a teacher," I said. "Robert," she said, fixing a watery, gin­
crossed eye upon me, "What do you.teach?" 
"English," I replied. 
For a while she sat there, silently sifting the implications of this heady news. Then she said: "Robert would you move your stool over here and help me with my speech and diction?" 
One wonders how Cardinal Newman would have handled this situation, or Paul of Tarsus dealing with the Second Corinthians. 
One can imagine the situation now: old Paul, out without his phylacteries, in some cheap dive in Asia Minor. Some boozy dancing girl leans over and says, "What do you do?" 
"Oh," says Paul evasively, "I'm a book writer." --meaning, of course, that he writes epistles for the Bible. 
the dancing girl 
The boozy dancing girl reflects for a moment, then says, "Could you help me make a selection from my book-of-the· month club?" 
Only it could never happen that way. St. Paul and Cardinal Newman never wan­dered into bars for a nightcap. One cannot imagine Newman talking to a boozy dancing 
Both Rupp and Freewin have competitive golf experience behind them. 
The team was organized to provide an opportunity for intercollegiate competition, but it is also open to beginners. Informal golf classes are held at 4:30 p.m. each Wednesday in Angela Hall, with Sister Kathy Reichert instructing all of the golfers and placing a definite emphasis on having fun. 
fencing team 
The St. Mary's Fencing team started out on a high note when the merger between St. Mary's and Notre Dame was proposed, getting both the use of ACC facilities and extra coaching help from the Notre Dame coaches. When the merger fell through and the facilities and extra coaching help were lost, the team voted not to give up and made arrangements to use Angela Hall at SMC. 
.The team attempted to hold regular practices in Angela's gym despite in­terference from cheerleaders, pick-up basketball games, karate classes and tennis lessons. They used outdated equipment found in Angela's lockers, got occasional help from members of the ND fencing team, picked up some cast-off uniforms, and headed for their first meet as St. Mary's fencers. 
The meet, held at Tri-State against a powerful Cornell team and fledgling Indiana and Tri-State teams, was the team's first loss. At the time Cornell was rated fourth in the country, just coming off of a win against MSU's men's team and easily defeated the poorly equipped and ragged fencers. It was a long season and the team finished with a 2­4 record. 
bright future 
The team's future brightened this year when St. Mary's furnished the team with better facilities and financial aid in the form of emergency funds for equipment, gas, housing, meals, and travel expenses. The team responded with a winning 3-2 record, bringing its total record to 5-6 against teams like Cornell, Vanderbilt, Indiana, Tri-State, Case Western Reserve , Harpeth Hall and Culver. The team consists of Cathy Schoendienst, Joan Bonifert, Sally Fischer Chris Rosinski, Sue Krakora, Nan .Lauer Judi Offerle, Cindy Rebhold, Karen Valdisserri, Ann Werner and R.J. Hosinsk1 Coach. 

girl. Paul might have talked to1t1er; but he would have told her to be silent in the churches, and he would have sobered her up on\J_esus Crucified. 
The lady with the diction problems heard nothing of Jesus from me. Instead, I ended by playing th(,'"Ani!iversary Waltz" for her on the jukebox. The song was her choice, not mine. As far as I was concerned, we had nothing to celebrate, certainly not an anniversary. But I think if I had been apostolic, we should have had something religious to celebrate, and that is the sadness of the story. 
euphoric daydreams 
I do not really think, despite the euphoric daydreams induced by April, that I am one of the the Christian heroes. I know I am not. 
If I were, young man and woman, I would become honey with zeal, like a prophet that has fasted too long in the desert. In all your trials and triumphs, I would remind you of God's love. My words would constantly invite you into the shadow of the Cross which stretches between a dark earth and a black heaven, and I would show you the face of the Lord. Then you would understnad your true worth, which is totally in­dependent of grades, or med school ac­ceptances, or successes in the dating game, or the triumphs of Clearasil nver acne. 
As it is, l know wen your failures as a Christian. But your love and friendshipihas given a dignity to my lif~that it never had before, and for that I thank you. 
And remember: Darby and I never said we didn't love you.

$300prize offered to dance marathon winners 
by Tom Mirabito Staff Reporter 
A $300 first prize has been of­fered by student government to the couple who dances the longest time and has the biggest donation in the first annual Multiple Sclerosis Dance Marathon. 

Jim Roe, chairman of the event_, said, "Many people have been misinformed as to the nature of this dance marathon. It is not 48 hours of straight dancing, each couple gets a half-hour break after every four hours of dancing and are allowed four hours of sleep both nights." Roe felt the way the llow many couples will last long marathon is set up most of the pnough to look this tired? 

couples will be able to dance the entire time. 
When referring to the $300 prize money Roe stressed the fact that each couple should find out how this money is to be divided if they are being sponsored by a group or individual. Roe said, "This is strictly an event sponsored by student government and is in no way connected with An Tostal." 
Steve Jeselnick, chairman of the An Tostal Committee, echoed Roe's sentiments. "'The dance marathon and An Tostal are very definitely two separate activities." 
Jeselnick and Roe both felt that since these activities were being held for different reasons they should not be included in the same program. Jeselnick said, "An Tostal is traditionally a weekend in spring that is set aside so that students can enjoy themselves. The marathon on the other hand conflicts with this in that itis for a very worthy cause and not for the enjoyment of the students." 
Roe added that the response to the marathon is starting to pick up. 
"A lot of people in South Bend are interested in becoming contestants and as of right now we have five couples definitely signed up with a total of close to $1000 in pledges. We encourage any hall, club, or university organization to par­ticipate in this contest," Roe said. 
The dates of the Marathon are April 27, 28 29 in the LaFortune Ballroom. On Saturday night Scum of the Earth will be playing. 

Anyone interested can register in the student government offices or call7668 and 6111. The registration fee is $10. 
Pit to be dug for AnTostal's volley-ball tourney in the 1nud 
by Bob Quackenbush 
Volleyball-in the mud? 
"Yes indeed," says Mike Hansen of the AnTostal Committee. "Sunny Saturday's volleyball championship will be playedin the slipperiest, slimiest, grimiest pit of squishy, oozing mud to be found on campus. Absolutely no competitor shall escape unsoiled." 
"Sunny Saturday" is April's last, and, as part of Notre Dame's annual An Tostal celebration, features a multitude of events. The First Annual Volleyball-in-the­Mud Tournament final is one which Hansen, its administrator, promises will be a favorite. 
Yesterday, Hansen, an Alumni 
Hall Senior, released the rules for 
team registration, which follow: 
1. 
Each team may have six members. 

2. 
Teams may ne all male, all female, or mixed. 

3. 
Students and faculty from both ND and SMC are eligible to par­ticipate. 

4. 
Each team must submit a nickname. 

5. 
To register or acquire ad­ditional information, call 1178 


Hansen said the finalists will be determined through single­elimination tournament play.· He qualified single-elimination as "losing two of three games to fifteen points against an individual opponent." He added that In­terhall rules would be adapted for use in the tournament. 
To obtain optimum playing conditions, a cross-section of soil samples from about the campus was examined. According to Hansen, "We tested for such qualities as the mud's adherence to skin and clothing, its caking ability, and, of course, its slip­periness. Our experimentation revealed the soil of the An Tostal field itself, midway between Notre Dame and St. Mary's to be most suitable." 
A pit, willsoon be constructed on 
the An Tostal field.·The pit will 
range in depth from six to twelve 
inches and will host the finals.

Hansen encouraged as many students as possible to enter the tournament,noting that three had registered already. Actually, he said, registration begins as soon as six people can decide upon a name

Debators place third 
Sixty of the best novice debate teams i n the country competed for national ranking this past weekend at the Ballarmine Novice National Invitational in Louisville Ken­tucky. 
Sophomore Jeff Rajehel and Dave Hayes both in their first year of collegiate debate advanced to third in the country only to be stopped by Wake Forest. 
In the preliminary rounds, the Irish gained a 5-1 record, defeating teams from Catholic University, Shepherd College, Emory, Wooster College and Abilene Christian College. The University of Ken­tucky lost to the Irish in octofinals, while the College of Will iam and Mary met the same fate in quar­terfinals. The team lost to Wake J<'orest in the semi-final found in a split decision. The third place ranking put Notre Dame ahead of some of the strongest "debate" schools in the country, including Michigan, Augustana, South Alabama, Virginai, U. of Penn­sylvania and U. of Massachusetts. 
The weekend was also a good one for Notre Dame's freshman debaters. Bill Hillstrom and Nancy Brenner took first place in debate at the Rock Valley College Debate and Forensic Tournament in Rockford Illinois. Their colleagues, Terry Salazar and John Walovich, followed with third in the debate division. Salazar also placed second in Impromptu Speaking, which was part of the Forensic Competition. 
The varsity debators also ended their regular season with victory. Seniors Jack Keeney and JohnBorkowski finished their season with a 3rd place at the Citadel Invitational, held in Charleston, South Carolina on Feb. 23-24 . With a 4-2 record in preliminary rounds, Keeney and Borkowski defeated Tulane in thE: quarterfinals only to lose to the tournament winners, West Georgia, in the semis. Kenney and Borkowski, along with senior Brian Kelly, will receive awards as being the top three debaters on the 1972-73 Irish Squad.

Marketing students enter 
Y Jayar Dally 

This week marks the completion ,of Notre Dame's tQird entry in Ford Motor Company's · Pinto Project, which -has studies atnumber of different aspects in regard to design of a marketing plan for the Pinto in South Bend. 
For the past three years, Ford along with YouthMark Inc. has sponsored this project, which enables marketing students· and professors from across the nation to combined the theory of the classroom with the design of an actual marketing plan. Two years ago, when the project was first held, Notre Dame won one of the $1000 regional awards. 
Eight Notre .Dame Marketing 
seniors took the project as a· 
special course in Marketing 
Strategy designedsolelyaround the 
Pinto contest. The students are 
Margueritte Crane, Jayar Daily, 
Kevin Hickey, John McEleney, 
Steve Petrucci, Die Rusnak, Dave 
Woods, and Jim Zagate. Dr. Davi 
Appel served as faculty advisor. 
The project at Notre Dame this 
year began in October. 
Because of the size and com­
plexity of the Notre Dame entry 
this year, Dr. David Appel's 
marketing research classes were 
used during the first semester to work on nine specific questions that the project investigated. The questions were the following: 
Marketing research students were divided into nine groups, each doing extensive research, both secondary and primary, in the area assigned.South Bend Demographics and History of Tansportation. The purpose of this study was to find out the demographical characteristics ofconsumers in South Bend as 
comparedwtih the U.S. and also to 
study the evolution of tasnportaion 
in the United states. 
Product Perception and 
Preference. In developing a 
marketing strategy for a product, 
an important area to consider is 
product perception, according to 
the Pinto researchers. To discover 
these perceptions in regard to the 
Hot Line needs help 
by George Brown 
Staff Reporter 

"The users of the Hot Line crisis­intervention service will be many or few depending on how well it is known and supported," stated Fr. David E. Schlaver, Director of volunteer services for the University of Notre Dame. 
The Hot Line crisis phones have been established since September 1, 1972 to provide information, referrals or advice for callers with personal problems. 
Schlaver stated that the Notre Dame-St. Mary's chapter of the Mental Health Association is convinced of the need for this service. "This group provides the majority of the volunteers for the Hotline," he continued. 
Rick Figiola, coordinator in charge of training volunteers for listening at the Hotline, explained the training procedures for each volunteer. "The training is in­formal, " he stated. "Most people who apply expect a classroom situation, but gain their experience in role-playing situations and training situations." 
"What we try to convey, " 
Figiola commented, "is the art of 
listening at the training sessions as 
well as at least 6 hours of listening 
at the phones along with an ex­
perienced volunteer. If the training 
team feels the applicant is ready to 
take on a regular shift at this time, 
he does so." 
Most of the calls received con­
cern drug problems. Most who call 
need someone to talk with to help 
them handle the effects of the 
drug," stated Figiola. If the case 
is serious, a Drug Abuse Rescue 
Team can be sent out to help. If 
more counseling is needed than 
can be given on the phone," he 
continued, "we try to give them a 
proper referral."

service per seek. Seventeen part time professional stand-by listerns are on call two or three nights each month. The latter group represents such agencies as the welfare dept, probation dept, mental health center, Northern Indiana Drub Abuse services, Big Brothers and school counselors. 
Six basic training sessions were provided last fall for new listeners. 
Basic training consists of 18 hours training in the art of listening; crisis intervention; specific in­formation on various problems such as alcohol and drugs, sex, 
(e.g. venereal disease, birth control, prlblem pregnancy, homosexuality), suicide, child abuse, marital and other relationships. In addition there is instruction in interviewing techniques and evaluation of situations necessary for making good referrals. Training is done by the Hotline Director, the training staff, and representatives from Planned Parenthood and Family and Children's Center. 
On-going training sessions are provided for volunteers who are already manning phones. These include sessions in Suicide and Drugs, Transactional analysis, Problem Solving and Personal Growth Experiences. 
Hotline works very closely with 
its referral sources to promote the 
services of existing organizations.

Pinto. 

From all of these ,projects ~e, research teamaccumulirted the fmdings to design a marketing strategy for the Pinto in the Soutli Bend market. Some of the findings from these projects include: 
Salesmen often times fail to emphasize the factors that con· sumers ,really consider to be im­portant in the purchase of a sub­compact. The salesman seem to 1concentia-te their selling on the price of the vehicle while the consumers feel that economy oC _ operation is the most important feature of the subcompact. 
The test drive is very iinportant inthe selling !process. In every case the consumers feelings towards the Pinto improved after the test drive. 
Subcompact owners are very interested in the "after sales" offering of the dealer and want to be able to rely on the dealers for dependable servide. 
Three of the factors besides economy of operation, that sub­compact owners like are: style, sportiness, and dependability. 
Judging· of the projects takes place in New York City in early May and the results will be an­nounced by May 12. This year a total of ten regional $1,000 awards will be given and one $5,000 national award.

It is difficult to resist thinking about how baseball can be transformed from an outdoor sport designed to be played only in favorable conditions to a sport performed either inside or under the worst inclement weather. Notre Dame is certainly not the ideal location to attempt to participate in the "nationa I pastime", and it is at times like these last few days when a baseball player considers changing sports. The beseball team has looked toward the start of the home season with great anticipation and con­fidence. 
It will be the beginning of a very successfull campaign, and it is a disappointment to have the Michigan State games postponed after having already been deprived of two potential victories over Hillsdale last week. We do have 26 scheduled games remaining, including a Sunday doubleheader with Xavier this weekend, though, so there isn't any need to be overly mournful of our cancelled games. 
Actually, there is reason for some cautious optimism in regard to the Notre Dame baseball team. Wemanagedto squeeze in two games during a cold and snowy weekend in Wisconsin, and although we only split the doubleheader, jVery much improved over our performances in Tulsa during vacation. We received excellent pitching from Mike Riddell and Riel{ Eich and hit well considering the adverse playing conditions. 
The NCAA tournament invitation 1is the goal of the baseball team, just as post-season competition is the ambition of every other Notre Dame representative. The NCAA tournament gives a team the opportunity to match their abilities with the best from across the country, and it is a great incentive to a team that happens to start the season with a mediocre record since all past performances are forgotten with the start of post season competition. The greatest encouragement to the baseball team is the fact that we have yet to play any of our District IV playoff rivals. The NCAA District IV tournament will consist of four teams-the winner of the Big Ten conference, the winner of the Mid-American conference, and two independents from the area. We are just beginning to play the teams that will make up the NCAA tournament. We will directly encounter Xavier, Cincinnati, Detroit, and Illinois State-they are our primary competition. 
We will meet the best teams of the Mid-American and Big Ten con­ferences and it will put the Irish in good position if we can do well with these teams, especially those that end up winning the conferences. We will have no competition with the teams that we met in Tulsa, so that our 2-8 record on the spring trip should have little effect on our NCAA chances. The important consideration is that we play well the remainder of the season, which will. once aszain, bring me to a plea for fan support. 
We have six home encounters with teams that will be vital to our NCAA consideration. We play independents Xavier, Detroit, and Cincinnati as well as Mid-American power Western Michigan and small college op­ponents Butler and Valparaiso. We must win these games, and fan support is essential. Notre Dame teams are well known for being amazingly difficult to beat at home. This is because of the greatness in fan support which drives the performers to play to the best of their abilities at all times We won every single home game that we played in 1.970 !ind received an NCAA bid. We can repeat this performance a gam this year with the help of the loyal Notre Dame fans.i 
Any fans taking the time to watch an ND baseball game will not be disappointed. The atmosphere is definitely better than that of the classroom, especially with this season's addition of Notre Dame "bat girls'. Likewise, the fan can even bring his own "refreshments" if he (or she> desires. The weather has not dampened the enthusiasm of the Notre Dame baseball team and I am hopeful that it will not effect the fan en­thusiasm, either. We will play a home game this spring, most likely this Sunday afternoon against Xavier. It could mean the start of a successful campaign heading toward the District IV tournament bid, with the possibility of an eventual spot in the College World Series.

Little T' -watches improveznents 
by Vic Dorr Sports Editor 
The cold didn't make any dif­ference. Neither did the wind. Neither did the fact that the workout was stretching itself to the two-hour mark. Mike Townsend, Notre Dame's defensive co­captain, was enjoying himself while he practiced. 
The junior defensive back was bounding around in the deep secondary, reacting when he missed a chance at an in­terception, and reacting even more when he made off with an errant pass. 
Townsend, who last year paced the Irish deep defenders with 10 interceptions, had good reasons for his high spirits. His first stolen pass of the afternoon's scrimmage session was one of them, but the defensive squad he was playing with was the biggest reason. 
l<'or the "Little T" is one of seven starters who return from last year's defensive platoon, and as the co-captain for the coming campaign, he's getting as much enjoyment as he can out of wat­ching his squad develop. 
Prior to the start of spring prc­tice '73, ND head coach Ara Parseghian viewed the early workouts as a base for "offensive refinement and defensive im­provement," and Townsend, already, can see that developing. 
"We're only about one-quarter of the way through spring practice," he said, "and after break we'll be about half-way done. The snow has gotten us down this week, but we're still in pretty good shape. Most of the offense is back, and the defense too, and right now the offense is gradually improving. The defense is still ahead at this moment, but defense doesn't take as much timing as offense does, and it's usual for us to be ahead at this time of year. By the end of practice, though, the offense will be where Ara wants it to be." 
But Parseghian's plans for his defensive team sometimes fall short of being completely en­joyable, even for a guy like Mike Townsend. This year, those plans involve a lot of learning, a lot of familiarization, and a lot of changes. 
"We're working on quite a few new things," admitted Townsend. "We're using a lot of combination defenses, and a lot of defenses that involve playing one side zone and one side man-to-man. There's a lot of learning involvedtlere, because we played mostly zone last year, and I've never seen anything like this before in college ball." 
The hoped-for effect of the 
revamped style of defense is in­creased quickness and pursuit, and the defensive co-captain is con­fident of that effect coming about. 
"We are going to be quicker next season," he said. "Instead of being big, we're going to be quicker and faster. When a team tries to run around end on us next year, there are going to be more than one or two gusy out there-­there are going to be six or seven. 
"No team is going to beat us on quickness alone this sea soP." 
Along with learning the new formations and alignments, Townsend is also watching as the Irish coaches try to replace the four missing members of last year's defensive team. Two linebackers, a rover-back, and a defensive tackle graduate this May, but their replacements, according to Townsend, are already feeling at home with the number-one defensive team. 
"I think the new guys are working out fine," he said. "(Mikel Fanning is good at tackle (although the race for that slot will be clouded in September, when Steve Niehaus returns to action), learning--and enjoying

Greg Collins is doing well at linebacker-he probably could have played last year--and Gary Potempa, he's one of the hardest hitters on the team. I mean, that man kills. Bob Zanot is just a freshman, but he plays like a junior or senior, so I don't think we'll have to worry about the changes that much next year." 
One thing the Irish gridders have had to worry about this spring is 
South Bend's weather. It's been almost exclusively bad during the first weeks of spring practice, and has already cost the ND squad several filmed scrimmage sessions. But, says Townsend, there's no question about making up the lost time. 
"We have lost a lot of time to the weather," he laughed, "but it doesn't make that much dif­ference. On the days we do practice, Ara will make sure that we get in shape for spring ball." 
And even on those days, Mike Townsend will still be watching,
