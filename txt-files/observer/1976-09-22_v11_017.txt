'A noble task' 
KINSHASA, Zaire -Henry A. Kissinger, reported carrying the word to black African leaders that Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Stnith has accepted the principle of black majority rule, was welcomed here last night as a man with "a noble task." The secretary of State flew here from Dar es Salaam, where Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere--declaring himself no longer "gloomy" about the prospects--quoted Kissinger as saying Smith has accepted the principle of a power transfer to Rhodesia's black majority within 18 months to two years.

Carter doesn't abort stand 
WASHINGTON (AP) -With missionary zeal, but without suc­cess, Jimmy Carter has been trying to convince antiabortion demons­trators in his campaign crowds that their views and his are not all that different. 
Like his critics on the issue, the Democratic presidential nominee is a declared for of abortion. He promises to do everything he can, short of changing the U.S. Consti­tution, to minimize the practice. 
But the placards and the chants continue because Carter will not 
endorse . a constitutional amend­ment to forbid abortion or to let the states do so. 
President Ford now favors an amendment that would give the states the constitutional right to pass laws of their own to control abortion. 
The abortion issue is a nagging one for Carter, who has no room for maneuver on the subject. Carter says he'll just have to weather it. 
"I wish that I could agree with you on everything, but I don't think 
. it is right for me to ch,nge my position just because this_ is an election year," Carter told a group of antiabortion pickets in an airport crowd in Bismarck, N.D., last week. Often, he speaks directly to the demonstrators, telling them he sympathizes with their position against abortion, if not with their 
prQposed constitutional remedy. 
"I see that you're concerned for the unborn,'' he told an antiabor­tion picket in Cleveland. "You're absolutely right. I'd do everything I can as President to hold down the need for abortion and I'll work with you on it... " 
Entering his Phoenix hotel. Car­ter went out of his way to shake hands with a small cluster of supporters, and walked into a predictable argument about abor­tion. A bright red sign that said "Abortion Is Murder" advertised the presence of his critics. 
"You'd have a lot of people to vote for you if you'd change your mind," a woman said. 
"Well, I'm not pro-abortion," Carter said. "You are pro-abortion," she snapped back. "No, I'm not, Ma'am," Carter replied. 
In Phoenix, Bismarck, and at other stops along Carter's route, the antiabortion protesters have held their own rallies and news conferences in advance of his arrival, to draw attention to their protest and to turn out their pickets. 
"I see the demonstrators over there and I sympathize with your right to let your views be known," he said at one stop. "I think abortions are wrong. I think

SBP Gassman speaks to HPC 
byTom Byrne Senior Staff Reporter 
Student Body President Mike 

Gassman appeared at the weekly 
meeting of the Hall Presidents 
Council and discussed upcoming 
plans for the Student Body Con­
gress. 
''The Congress is going to meet 

next Wednesday night in LaFor­
tune auditorium," announced 
Gassman. "The reason we waited 
was the budget hearings on Sun­
day. We'd like to have a rundown 
to give everybody then." 
The student government budget hearings will determine how the approximately $85,000 collected through the student activities fee is distributed among the campus clubs and organizations. Among the groups seeking funds Sunday will be the HPC. 
Gassman expressed hope that the Congress would allow for smoother operation of the various groups on campus. "Maybe we can avoid scheduling conflicts," he said, adding that the agenda would largely involve a "discussion on activities.'' 
HPC chairman J. P. Russell indicated afterward that the Con­gress ''had a lot of potential if it's done right.:' He noted that the project would only be worthwhile if it provided sufficient time and an atmosphere for meaningful dis­cussion. 
Budget committee appointed 

The council moved to form a budget committee-to determine how much each hall would receive from the funds obtained at the student government budget hear­ings. The presidents on the 6-member committee, determined by lottery, are Nancy Siegler of Breen-Phillips, Tom Denten of Pangborn, Terry Philbin of Grace, George Velcich of Cavanaugh, and Mike Doyle of Morrissey. The committee is chaired by HPC executive coordinator Keefe Mont­gomery, who is also president of Stanford. 
Russell told the council that he would go to Sunday's budget hearings hoping to receive "a little more than last year." The HPC was allotted $7700 for the hall life fund in 1975, and according to Russell about $300 allocated to the halls was not spent. 
"I'm going in with the pitch that we'll use everything we ask for," he said, and remarked that this HPC was a "new group." 
The budget committee will con­sider requests for_money from all the halls, with preference given to special projects, such as reno­vations. Russell added that the funds should be used for "some­thing permanent,'' such as a rug or television set.

SLC discusses coed life 
by Joe Gill 
Staff Reporter 

The initial meeting of the Stu­dent Life Council (SLC) opened yesterday with a discussion of the recently-created committee on coeductional life instituted by Fr. Burtchaell and its relation to the SLC Campus Life committee. 
The SLC committee last year conducted various studies in this area, and a few members felt the particular concentration of the SLC was overlooked by the formation of the new committee. 
Mike Casey, newly-elected SLC chc.irman, said he was "unhappy that the SLC wasn't recognized in this area. Hopefully, they'll work with our committees." 
Student Body President Mike Gassman said that he "personally felt it was a slight toward the SLC, especially since the students on his committee (Burtchaell's) are not from the SLC." "Fr. Burtchaell's committee was set up separately," Gassman said, "and it should have been set up through the Council." 
Dean.of Students James Roemer felt "optimistic that their commit­tee and ours could work together and be very productive," and commented that the different back­grounds of the members of both committees would be effe<:tive together. 
North Quad Representative Ed Van Tassel suggested contacting Fr. Burtchaell and finding out how his committee will be working, and Casey indicated his agreement. 
In other deveopments, Roemer proposed that the first tern min'!.tes 
of each meeting be designated as an "executive session," in which only members of the SLC (inclu­ding the SBP) would attend. The rest of the meeting would then be open to the public and the media. The motion was voted on and passed. 
The four Standing Committees of the SLC will be continued this year, consisting of Capus Life, Planning and Policy, Rules andRegulations, and Off-Campus and Community Relations. Casey said the "groundwork is being laid and dis 
cussed in the individual commi­ttees and will be brought before the Council at the next meeting." 
Van Tassel was elected Vice­Chairman and Brother Just Pac­zesny was elected Parliamentarian.

In Africa

Kissinger hopeful Hall director, Diane Benjamin, 
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania ­Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was reported yesterday to be carrying the word to black African Leaders that Prime Minister Ian Smith has accepted the principle of rule by Rhodesia's black majority within 18 months to two years. 
Tanzanian President Julius Ny­erere told reporters that Kissinger had revealed Smith's position dur­ing a 90-minute meeting after the secretary flew here from Zambia on his mission for racial peace in southern Africa. 
Kissinger left for Kinshasa, Zaire, after the meeting. 
Nyerere said he was no longer "gloomy about prospects for a Rhodesian settlement" and awaits a public statement from Smith's regime-expected Friday-that ac­cepts terms for a settlement. 
In Salisbury, the Rhodesian cap­ital, Smith spent 3112 hours outlin­ing to his cabinet the proposals offered to him at his Sunday meeting with Kissinger. Smith said the cabinet would study the plan--"even sleep on it, even dream on it"--before deciding its position today. 
He added that the final decision to accept or reject would emerge after a scheduled briefing Thurs­day of his caucus--50 members of · the 66-member parliament. 
Besides a commitment to black majority rule within two years, the British-American plan put before Smith calls for a constitutional conference in Geneva; the broaden­ing of the Rhodesian cabinet to include black nationalists, and a $2-billion fund financed by the United States, Britain, South Africa and other nations to compensate whites who leave Rhodesia and to help develop the country under black rule. 
"My mood is better," Nyerere said at news converence after his meeting with Kissinger. But he added a note of caution: "Life is full of imponderables. And Smith is an imponderable." 
Rhodesia, a land of 270,000 whites and some 6 million blacks, was a British colony until the Smith regime unilaterally declared its independence in 1965. Brita;n has refused to make a political settle­ment agreeing to the independence until provision is made for majority rule. The British are also demand­ing that Smith renounce the unilat­eral independence declaration and agree not to filibuster during the negotiations between Rhodesia's white and black nationalist parties.

The Saint Mary's student body will eventually re:ap the benefits of the college's new recreationaf facil­ity which is now under construc­tion. However, many residents of the north side of McCandless Hall feel that they are paying the price for everyone else's enjoyment. 
"When we first got back, the noise and dust that the construction caused was a real pain," said Maureen Rothfuss, a fifth floor resident. "They woke us up at seven every morning with the sound of bulldozers and pounding. Also,. the dust was terrible. It bothered our eyes and dirtied the room.

Alumni summer ho:tel 
.program termed success 
The first Notre Dame Alumni summer hotel was termed a suc­cess by Alumni Director John Cackley, and plans for expansion of services in 1977 are underway. 
The project originated as a means of providing a service to alumni and utilizing vacant campus buildings. Last February plans were announced by the ND Alumni Office which afforded former stu­dents the opportunity to r~turn to . campus fur a visit at a time other tha:; class reunions or a major athletic event. Lewis Hall, a four­story undergraduate women's resi­dence hall. was selected for use. 
Noting that the operation "defin­itely did not show a deficit," the alumni director said he expects an increase in the number of hotel occupants next summer because of the positive feedback he has re­ceived. Approximately 5000 alumni and their families took advantage of the opportunity to stay in Lewis Hall between June 14 and July31, 1976, Cackley said. 
A profile of the summer visitors shows good cross-representation of alumni from all classes. The eco­nomical rates offered attracted many recent alumni and their children, Cackley added. 
An alumnus and spouse shared a double room for $10 per night. Two children were placed in another double room for an additional $3, resulting in a fee of $13 per night for a family of four. Many families offour, however, took advantage of the special rate of $60 for seven nights, the alumni director stated. Golf, tennis and swimming were available at the regular guest fees. 
In the original plans, summer visitors were given the option of participating in two summer work­shops to be directed by ND faculty members. These workshops would have discussed some of the major issues confronting the United States and the world community, Cackley explained. Neither semi­nar was held because of the poor response from alumni guests, he said. 
Cackley stated that there is a proposal under consideration by the Alumni Association which would expand the summer pro­gram. Continuing education programs may be directed by the CCE staff, and improvements n daytime activities for children are expected. 
The Alumni Association first third floor resident, explained, the expected completion date for "We're up at seven o'clock any­the facility is the week of March 24. way, so it doesn't bother us. It's When questioned about how much just a good thing they don't work

The Navy Nuclear fbwer ~gram is a total systems approach to problem solving. Admiral H. G. Rickover implemented this program to train intelligent men to address complex problems through knowledge and understanding rather than rote compliance to set procedures. This is the most selective and highest paying Engineering specialty in the Navy. In addition to full pay and benefits, it includes a $1,500 bonus for completion of Nuclear Power School and a $20~-ooo four year continuation bonus .. 
The Navy needs some very special Notre Dame Graduates who aren't afraid to find out how good they are.

Republican senatorial nominee, Richard Lugar, called! for a cam­paign that "speaks to the highest ideals of Indiana citizens" at a fund-raising dinner in Indianapolis last week. 
In his speech at the "Dick Lugar Victory Dinner," the major fund­raiser for his Senate bid, Lugar said, "Certainly, given the raw material we have to work with, the temptation presents itself to devote much of the campaign to exposing and condemning on1! breach of integrity after another. Junkets, 'triple-dipping' of expenses, illegal contributions and refusal of airline se!l.rches might provide more exci­ting speech topics than full eplploy­ment, care for the elderly, quality education, or protection of the environment." 
'-'But, I sense the voters I am meeting each day seek and expect better things from us," he contin­ued. ''They seek a positive alternative to the unethical politics of the past.· We offer one. They seek constructive proposals for rejuvenating the private economic sector, and creating lasting jobs. We are suggesting such proposals. They seek persons with the vision to look forward to new energy sources, unquestionable national defense preparedness, and a more humane and effective federal gov­ernment, which re-emphasizes per­. sonal liberty. We are demonstra­
ting both that vision and the 
dedicated energy needed to reach 
higher ground.'' 
Lugar's appeal for ethical politics and constructive, forward-looking action comes at the end of a month of political wrangling between the two senatorial condidates. ,Accusa­tions have been flying thick and fast from all sides.

The American Conservative Uni­on recently labeled Hartke, "Mr. Special Interest.'' 
James C. Roberts, executive director of the Conservative Union, called on Hartke to return at least 20 per cent of the more than $300,000 he has raised thus far for his re-election campaign, according to a story in the Fort Wayne News Sentinel. He said Hartke solicited and accepted money from the railroad industry while serving as chairman of the subcommittee for surface transportation dealing in rail matters. He also received money from utility interests while introducing legislation favoring those interests.

\Night Controller -Don Roos EdHoriai Association convention, Hartke said there are newspapers in the state, which own television and radio stations, who are concer­ned that he might seek to force divestiture of the broadcast proper­ties. 
Hartke said that he has been trying "to get the message across" that as the man in line to be chairman of the Senate Communi­cations Subcommittee (if re-elec­ted), he could seek such legislation as a response to what he considers "irresponsible" journalism. 
Asked if his statement could be considered a "veiled threat," Hart­ke replied, "It is not veiled." 
Indianapolis Mayor Richard Hudnut sent Jartke a letter reques­ting that he cease making "unfoun­ded and misleading" inuendoes that "would lead people to think that I am very critical of the former Mayor of Indianapolis, Richard G. Lugar." 
· The dispute between Lugar and Hartke camps continues over Indi­anapolis employment and unem­ployment figures. Hartke forces are still demanding that Lugar withdraw a current television com­mercial. 
The controversy arose over Lu­gar statistics claiming that he brought Indianapolis 8,000 new jobs annually during his eight-year term as mayor. Hartke supporters provided U.S. Department of labor statistics to disprove these figures. They also cited the fact that unemployment figures more than doubled during this time, in an effort to discredit Lugar's claim to have boosted' employment. 
"To avoid tne possibility of further dispute, the language will be amended to say 'thousands of new jobs per year' ,--an irrefutable claim," said Mitch Daniels of the 
Lugar campaign staff. 
Lugar said the advertisement claim of 8,000 new jobs was based on figures showing an average of 442,400 job-holders in 1967 and an average of 497.000 in 1974. a storv in the South Bend Tribune on Sept. 13 reported. However, the average 1975 employment only rose bv 4,000 jobs, dropping the eight-yea'r average gain to 7,325 rather than 8,000, lugan noted.

Fullback Jerome Heavens: 
a young man on the run 
by Patrick Cole 

With only 13 games under his belt at Notre Dame, Jerome Heav­ens has already put himself in the school's all-time individual record book. 
Last season, Heavens rushed for 148 yards against Georgia Tech in 18 carries setting a record for most yards gained in a game by a freshman. On four occasions, he gained over.100 yards placing him second behind the legendary George Gipp who gained more than I 00 yards in five games during one season. He shares this honor with former Notre Dame great, Wayne Bullock (1974) and Marchy Schwartz (1930). 
By the end of the season, many Notre Dame football fans were surprised to find Heavens as the leading rusher on the team with 
.. 
756 yards in 129 carries again setting another all-time record for a freshman. And this record puts him ninth on the all-time single season rushing list. And don't forget--he was only a freshman when all this happened last season, and he has three more seasons to go! Going into the third game of this season against the Northwestern Wildcats this Saturday, Heavens continues to lead the team in rushing with 166 yards in 46 carries 
(3.6 yards per carry average). Naturally, he has become a regular starter at the fullback slot. 
"I'm taking it in stride," the explosive runner from East St. Louis, III. said about his position. "I feel comfortable about starting, but anything can happen. There's people behind me like Willard Browner and Steve Orsini. But it is a happy feeling to be starting." 
Last season, Heavens alternated at fullback with Jim Browner who now starts at strong safety. Heavens admitted he wanted to alternate at times. "But it got to the point I wanted to play," he stated. "Any athlete wants to play and make the first team." Yet Heavens felt that by splitting time at the position, the coaches could get both backs the experience and help the team by using the skills that Browner and he had to offer. 
Being able to play in his first game was a most memorable experience, Heavens remembered. 
Yet he felt more relaxed about this season. "The first game against Boston College opened up on national television--1 really didn't know what to expect. However, with the Pittsburgh game, I felt more comfortable about playing," Heavens indicated. 
Despite his outstanding fresh­man season, he was occasionally haunted with fumbles. "The first time I touched the ball in my college career, I fumbled," he stated. "I don't think the problem was nervousness as much as it was a lack of concentration on my part. So then I started thinking, 'I have to hold on to the ball.' But there are still other things you have to be concerned about when you run with the ball." So as he gained more knowledge about playing, he be­came better at hanging onto the ball, he said. 
Heavens, an economics major, attributes his abilities to his high school coach and his relatives. He told that during his junior year in high school, he concentrated more 
Oregon Student football tiX 
on running the ball instead of blocking. 
"So in the latter part of my senior year, my coach stressed blocking," he said. "Yet I had a lot of relatives who were in sports, who made me want to be involved in sports. From them, I picked up some tips, and I picked up a lot of things naturally.'' 
And Heavens' name became a natural choice for athletic recogni­tion at Assumption High School in .East St. Louis. He won a total of eight letters in football, basketball, and baseball while captaining the football and basketball teams in both his junior and senior years. In football, he received all-district and all state honors in his junior year. He was a consensus All-America choice as a senior. 
"In high school, you were sup­erior over a lot of people," Hea­vens pointed out. "Here at Notre Dame, people are bigger, faster, stronger, and sometimes smarter so you have to figure out ways to beat them." Therefore, Heavens has set some 
goals for the coming season.  He  
hopes  the  team  can  win  the  
national  chmapionship,  and  he  

doesn't think it is out of reach despite the early loss to Pittsburgh. 
He would also like to catch more passes, but his personal goal is probably the same of any running back in the country. 
"I would really like to gain over l ,000 yards," Heavens revealed. "But if I'm called on to catch more passes then it is a sacrifice I'll have to make. But my main goal is to improve my overall game." 
Many fans would question whe­ther Heavens needs to improve his game since he is one of the speedier fullbacks in Notre Dame history. Alre.ady.he is known for the long run m hts young career. Against Georgia Tech in 1975,

Dantley signs 
BUFFALO AP -Adrian Dantley, who led the U.S. Olympic basket­ball team to a gold medal in Montreal this summer, signed a multiyear contract with the Buffalo Braves Tuesday. 
Dantley, a 6-foot-5 forward who needs nine credit hours to be graduated from Notre Dame, was the Braves' first-round pick in the National Basketball Association draft last spring. 
Neither he nor the Braves would disclose terms of the contract. However, it was believed the pact was fot five years and could pay him in excess of $100,000 a year.

Saurs captures Notre Dame Open 
by Tom Desmond 
Sophomore Tim Saurs captured the 1976 Notre Dame Open golf championship with a six-over par, 290 total for four rounds. Saurs outdistanced fellow sophomore Dave Richert by six shots, Richert firing four consecutive 74's. 
Saurs, recently named the Nor­thern Indiana-Metropolitan Illinois Golf Association's "Golfer of the Year" for his age group (17-19), took the lead at the 36-hole mark with a sub-par 70 and was never headed after that. 
Four players tied at 298 for third place. Varsity golf team captain Rich Knee, senior Bob Belmonte and freshmen Jay Bryan and John Lungran played off Monday even­ing for the third place trophy. 
It was a par four on the third sudden death hole that gave Minnesota Junior Amateur champ­ion John Lungren sole possession of third place. All four players parred the first two holes but it was Lungren's putter on the third green that claimed the playoff. 
The Notre Dame golf team will open its fall season this Friday afternoon at 2:30 with a dual met against Western Michigan. Coach Noel O'Sullivan will field three squads, a total of fifteen players, 
against  the  Broncos  on  Notre  
Dame's  own  Burke  Memorial  
Course.  

The Irish will then travel down­state to the Golf Club of Indiana on Sunday to prepare for the Indiana Intercollegiate Golf Championship to be held Monday and Tuesday of next ~eek.
