INSIDE COLUMN 


Notre Dame needs some 'play time' 
With all the con­struction going on around campus I'm surprised Notre Dame has not yet found space for the 

one structure we truly Alison Cocks need: a playground. Editor-in-Chief 
Sure, a $33 million classroom complex and an extra gold structure or two are 
probably helpful in achieving the Univer­sity's newest goal: to become a REALLY GREAT research institution, but a play­ground would help to resolve a more impor­tant issue: morale. It's a rare individual who can take himself seriously while playing "Red Ught, Green Ught" in the sand pit. 
After all, short of actually living together in the SAME DORM, what could possibly re­duce tensions between the sexes more than an opportunity for girls and boys to throw sand at each other? 
It works at age three when Susie Snowflake invites everyone to her birthday party except one or two people. Three-year­olds never invite fifty of their closest friends to analyze lost invitations in the Huddle. In­stead they form an army, douse some pony­tails in some dirt and forget the whole thing. 
I also have visions of 'King of the Hill' contests on the $10 million gold-plated jun­gle gym replacing the student body elec­tions. 
The candidate who pushes the opposition off the jungle gym the quickest, without the aid of table tents, skywriting, or hopelessly dry campaign slogans wins the FRED line, a corner suite in LaFortune and the right to be harassed on a daily basis by Observer reporters. 
It could also do wonders for weekend sto­ries. Instead of "Oh boy, I got really WASTED last night and puked in the glove compartment of the taxi and mashed with my Assistant Rector in our 24-hour lounge," we'd hear, "I sat in a swing and pumped so hard I could see the stars, and then I jumped off and I was so dizzy I couldn't stand up for two minutes." It would be an excellent venue for the an­nual snowball fight too. Instead of breaking windows in the Administration Building, students could aim their missiles at a tree­house with a replica of the Dome on top. Cynical readers are probably asking what use a playground could be in inclement weather (i.e. most of the year). No problem. Stepan Center is vacant once again, since Sacred Heart has re-opened. I can't picture the University holding serious functions in a building that looks like a golf ball, but with a little sand and some equipment, Stepan could actually earn its keep. If nothing else, it could provide the most creative justification ever for raising tuition. I might even swallow it. 
The views expressed in the Inside Column are those of the author and not necessarily those of The Observer.

The Associated Press on Sept. 22 erroneously listed the number of confirmed AIDS victims in Indiana as 456. The State Board of Health says that as of Sept. 1 there had been 891 confirmed in Indiana. The lower figure was cited by Dr. Howard Hess of Indianapolis, head of a state task force on AIDS, in discussing the group's yearlong study of the disease. 
A new survey shows Gov. Evan Bayh and Sen. Richard Lugar are neck-and-neck when its comes to their personal popularity among Hoosier voters.

The poll, which surveyed 802 registered vot­ers on Sept. 10-12, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, was com­missioned by the Indianapolis Star. The survey said most voters are satisfied with Bayh's job performance.

ALA kicks off national Banned Books Week 
CHICAGO (AP) -What do Dr. Seuss, Stephen King and the editors of Webster's dictionary have in common? Theirs are among the scores of books banned or challenged in the past year, the American Library Association said Monday in launching Banned Books Week. 
"We need to bring to the at­tention of American public the fact that our First Amendment rights are under attack," said Judith Krug, director of the association's Office for Intellectual Freedom. 
A Webster's Dictionary edi­tion was challenged in the Up­per Pittsgrove Township, N.J.. school district because parents objected to the definition of sexual intercourse as "the sexual joining of two individuals," said Paul Whitman, secretary of the school board. 
The 1986 dictionary -an edition edited especially for teenagers -was removed from fourth and fifth grade classrooms last fall, but continues to be used in upper levels, he said. Whitman said 
Adrianne Moore takes part in a candle lighting ceremony held at Dag Hammarskjold Plaza in New York on Sunday to demand that world leaders work to prevent the deaths of 40,000 children a day. 
he didn't know what portion of the definition provoked the challenge. 
"The Lorax" by Dr. Seuss' was challenged in a Laytonville, Calif., school district last September. Parents working for a local logging company said the book portrayed their industry negatively. 
The book remained on the second-grade required reading list after the challenge. but teachers voluntarily moved it to an optional list the following spring, said Superintendent Brian Buckley. 
Stephen King's "The Stand" was restricted to ninth-grade students with parental consent at Whitford Intermediate School in Beaverton, Ore. after some parents objected to violence and sexual language. Another King novel, "Christine," was pulled from the library at Washington Middle School in Meriden, Conn., after a parent complained about offensive passages.

CINCINNATI (AP) 
Potential  jurors  in  an  
obscenity  trial  involving  
Robert  Mapplethorpe's  

sexually explicit photos were asked Monday whether they look at Playboy magazine or attend arts fund-raisers. 
Many questioned during the first day of jury selection said they'd seen such adult magazines as Playboy, Pent­house and Hustler, but said they didn't subscribe. None acknowledged having taken an art class or attending a fund-raiser for the arts. 
The Contemporary Arts Cen­ter and its director, Dennis Barrie, were charged in April with pandering obscenity and displaying nude photos of chil­dren. The photographs were from the exhibit "Robert Map­plethorpe: The Perfect Mo­ment." 
The seven-week exhibition 
of photographs by Mapplethorpe, who died of AIDS in March 1989, attracted a record crowd of more than 80,000 people to the gallery last spring. 
About 150 gay-rights and anti-censorship demonstrators protested the trial outside the Hamilton County Courthouse from mid-morning through the noon hour Monday. They sometimes disrupted traffic, but there were no arrests. 
The charges are both misde­meanors. If convicted. Barrie. 43, faces a possible fine of $1,000 and six months in jail on each count. The gallery could be fined $5,000 on each count. 
A panel of eight jurors and two alternates will be chosen to hear the trial in Hamilton County Municipal Court. Jury selection was expected to con­tinue through Tuesday, with testimony lasting into next week. 
A pool of 50 prospective jurors was assembled Monday, but attorneys got less than 
halfway through questioning the first group of eight. "Would you avoid a homo­sexual art display?" the 
gallery's attorney, Marc Mezi­bov, asked one prospective juror. 
"I wouldn't put out money to see homosexual art," the man 
responded.  
Mezibov prospective testimony  also jurors will deal  told that with  

Mapplethorpe's homosex­uality. 
Prosecutor Frank Prouty asked prospective jurors whether they had seen Playboy, Penthouse or Hustler magazines and whether they had taken art classes or at­tended an arts fund-raiser. 
Judge David Albanese asked all 50 prospective jurors if they had any personal contact with the art community. One person said she was a member of the Contemporary 
Arts Center, and three said 
they had seen the exhibit. 
Protesters outside denounced the trial as homophobic intimidation.

Oil prices peak as world tightens sanctions on Saddam 
(AP) -World leaders opened a U.N. General Assembly session Monday by condemning Iraq as a warlike state for its invasion of Kuwait, as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein vowed to fight for "a thousand years" to keep the oil-rich emirate. 
While the world body pre­pared to tighten sanctions on Iraq, the economic repercus­sions of the Persian Gulf crisis spread and strengthened. 
Oil prices peaked at $39.20 a barrel and settled at a record $38.25 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, where oil futures have been traded since 1983. Gasoline and home heating oil both topped $1 a gallon. The International Monetary fund, meanwhile, moved to help poor countries whose economies are being devastated by the conflict. 
The stock market in New York fell to a 14-month low Monday, battered by rising oil prices and trouble in the banking industry. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 59.41 points to 2,452.97.

Deficit hits record high 

WASHINGTON (AP) -The White House and congres­federal budget deficit jumped sional negotiators are trying 
$52.8 billion to a record $241.7 billion in August, but could be reduced before the fiscal year ends Sept. 30, the Treasury Department reported Monday. 
The 67 percent surge over the comparable 11 months of 1989 boosted the spending imbalance well over the record of $221.1 billion posted in fiscal 1986. The August total, however, fell short of the one-month record of $53.3 billion set last March. 
"We used to have years that were that bad," economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch said of the August deficit. 
The department said about $25 billion of the August deficit reflected a shift of payments normally made in September such as military pay and Social Security checks to the previous month to avoid Labor Day weekend delays. 
"This will affect September's results by $25 billion as com­pared to last year," it said in a statement. 
Still, without the $25 billion early payment, the deficit so far this fiscal year would have totaled $216.9 billion. The deficit in September 1989 was $6.1 billion. 
The Bush administration had forecast a $218.5 billion imbalance for all of fiscal 1990.

to reach agreement on reducing the deficit by $50 billion in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 and $500 billion over the next five years. 
Without an agreement, the White House estimates the fis­cal 1991 deficit will total $232.3 billion. 
Revenues in August totaled $78.5 billion, up 3.1 percent from the comparable month in 1989. But the receipts were offset by $131.2 billion in outlays, a 33.5 percent gain over August 1989. 
In addition to the early pay­ments, the spending bill in­cluded $2.6 billion for the Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency charged with bailing out the savings and loan industry. The S&L bailout cost $3.2 billion in July and $37.8 billion so far this year. 
The government hopes to regain much of the bailout cost by selling real estate, loans, securities and other assets from failed thrifts. That would help reduce the deficit in future years. 
"It's just a continuation of the trends we've been seeing," Steinberg said. "Receipts are not that strong because the economy is weakening." 
Revenues for the first 11 months totaled $928.6 billion, up 4.2 percent from the first 11 months of last year. Spending during the period totaled $1.2 trillion, 12.8 percent over the comparable period of 1989. 
As usual, the biggest spend­ing categories were the mili­tary, Social Security and other programs of the Department of Health and Human Services and interest on the national debt. 
Military spending totaled $27.8 billion in August and $269.2 billion so far this year. It is projected to total $290.2 billion for the entire fiscal year. 
Social Security payments amounted to $41.2 billion for the month and $244.2 billion for the year. They are projected to total $244.9 billion for the year. 
Other HHS payments, including Medicare and Medicaid, totaled $18.3 billion in August and $179.7 billion for 1990 so far. They are projected to total $192.4 billion in fiscal 1990. 
Interest on the national debt amounted to $18.9 billion for the month and $247.6 billion so far this year. Such interest is projected to total $261.1 billion for the entire year. 
Bush's son faces judge for costing taxpayers $1 billion 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi­dent Bush's son Neil goes be­fore a judge Tuesday in Denver for a rare public hearing that could lead to his being barred from working for a bank or savings and loan. 
Federal regulators have ac­cused Bush, 35, of conflict of interest in his former role as a director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association, a Denver thrift that failed in late 1988 at an estimated cost to taxpayers of $1 billion. 
The hearing before an administrative law judge is the centerpiece of the government's complex proceeding against Bush, which has taken the form of a paperwork battle since the Office of Thrift Supervision filed the charges in February. 
The OTS is seeking an order against Bush, an oil and gas developer, to effectively bar him from working for a bank or a savings and loan. The agency contends that Bush failed to adequately disclose to Silverado his business relationships with developers Kenneth Good and Bill Walters, two big borrowers from Silverado who defaulted on their loans. 
Bush could have avoided a public hearing by agreeing not to dispute the conflict-of-inter­est charges, as other S&L offi­cials have done in nearly all such previous cases. By fighting the government, he has taken the case out of attorneys' and regulators' offices into a public forum. 
"The swords are drawn," Bush's attorney, James Nes­land, said recently. 
Bush plans to testify in his own defense at the hearing, which is expected to continue through most of the week. 
Although such a public hearing is almost unprecedented, the participants don't expect any fireworks or courtroom drama. In fact, Nesland said, "This is going to be an ex­traordinarily boring hearing." 
That's because it will mainly be a replay of written testimony already submitted to the administrative law judge, Daniel Davidson. Regulators and outside experts will be cross-exam­ined on that testimony by at­torneys for the two sides. 
The judge won't issue an opinion for some time.

I just turned 21 this past August 31 and one of the places where I was feted and sated at was The Commons. It's a friendly bar which can be found, for those underage peo­ple cannot get in there and thus, do not know its location, directly across from Bridget McGuire's. It was a memorable evening, for those I was with. And at one point during the night, while I was pensively downing a Prairie Fire, I re­membered something a man said to me in that very bar just two years ago. 
He was an older man, all alone at a barstool, but by no means in a stupor. He did have a beer in hand, but he quaffed it at his leisure-"nursing it," as some might say. His task at hand was not getting drunk. In fact, he really didn't seem to have a task at hand. The gospel he preached, however, when one was forced to get near him to order something from the here-because I could do bartender, was, "It's just so nothing but nod-and more

to have to do. But I realize that those who don't really follow the news, who are simply read­ing this to pass the time at lunch, in order to have some­thing to mutually rip on with the person across the table, will have no reason to continue reading unless they believe there's some reason to follow the news. Here goes. One should follow the news-in newspapers, magazines, on ra­dio, and/or on television, for, at a minimum, utterly selfish, practical reasons. If one is aware of the events which daily affect and change the globe, the nation, the state and the local­ity in which one lives, he can shape his actions on a local level so as to secure the best future he can for himself, his family and his friends. Conversely, the uninformed in­dividual unnecessarily gambles, to a greater degree, with his future. 
I once again apologize for placing this primer in front of adult eyes, but I felt the need to do so after entering a dorm bathroom recently to find each of four empty stalls with a newspaper on it floor. Three were turned to the Sports sec­tion; the fourth section was un­intelligible, as it was being used 
· to soak up water from a toilet whose bowl overflowed. All four were "USA Today." Now back to our show. Like I said, I like to stay relatively in­formed; I think it's a necessity. But reading straight through The New York Times these days is even more dizzying than it used to be. First of all, it would take hours to accomplish such a feat. We do have to live our 
lives, and not endlessly deter­mine, through weighing new in­formation. how to live them; hence, graduation. Secondly, even if one could somehow allo­cate enough time to read every­thing everyday, he could never have the necessary historical background to put these myriad news bites in context, to judge these editorials intelligently and objectively. As communications and economies expanded globally in recent years. we unpreparedly became inun­dated with new information. And the fact is that much of this new information is not ex­traneous; it is vital to be under­stood by our citizenry so they may make wise political choices for America and wise personal choices for themselves. 
That guy in the bar, that wise man, knew this. He said it, too. He didn't simply pass it off the instant it crossed his mind with a tired shoulder shrug. He ac­knowledged it, and it really dis­turbed him. It certainly is a disheartening task these days to try to keep informed when we have less "leisure time" to do so than ever before and when hundreds of events and business transactions-most beyond any deep understanding to the average guy-spiral out­ward each day, for the most part out of our control. I guess it's just a matter of gleaning the papers for those few articles with which we feel a connec­tion, upon which we feel the possibility of acting locally to affect change for the better. It's what we really must do to act responsibly, for our own sake and for others. Because it's even more disheartening to think of living in this complex global village without a clue­informationally unarmed, and dangerous.

DIAL F-R-E-D! 
New suggestion line attracts offbeat grievances 
STEVE TANKOVICH 
Accent Writer 

In its first year of existence, the FRED line is bringing an in­teresting new aspect to the Notre Dame community. The FRED line, NO student gov­ernment's latest method of gaining input from the student body, is bringing in important suggestions and comments for possible improvements by stu­dent government. 
ND students who dial x3733 (F-R-E-0) are welcomed by a short, recorded message which requests that they leave their suggestions, along with their name, address and phone num­ber so that they can be con­tacted later. The use of an an­swering machine in this process enables the service to be of­fered 24 hours a day. 
At regular intervals, the mes­sages are replayed by student body Vice-President, Fred Tombar. Fred takes down the messages on a suggestion form, which is designed to facilitate the referring of suggestions to the appropriate department for action. Then, student body Secretary, Nicole Farmer, makes sure that the suggestion forms are sorted and given to the proper department coordinator. Nicole also occasionally assists in the taking of messages. 
The first weeks of the FRED line's existence brought a steady stream of calls into the student government office, which is located on the second floor of LaFortune. According to Fred, there were originally about 20 calls a day. Numbers have now begun to level out at about five calls daily. Of these five, three or so usually can be recognized as "helpful" or "very helpful. II 
Most of the useful sugges­tions thus far have been re­ferred to the student life de­partment. The department covers women's concerns, minority concerns, campus improvements, and student services, as well as campus security and the areas of alcohol, food, and health. Numerous students have responded in the areas of student service and campus improvement. There have also been significant ideas expressed about security. In fact, the new lighting being developed in the 02 parking lot can be linked with the FRED line. 
Yet, along with the Mhelpful" calls, the line has also received a great number of calls which, although not necessarily discouraged by student government, have created a certain FRED line mystique. These calls, ranging from the abstract to the obscene, make up the more bizarre half of the FRED line. 
The FRED line's bizarre calls have provided student government with entertainment and an abundance of ideas which would probably not arise at even the greatest of brain­storming sessions. They have also provided criticism of everyday elements of the university from interesting perspectives. And as a service to some students, the FRED line has managed to serve, from the viewpoint of student body President, Rob Pasin, as "almost a 976 number " or a "Dear Abby." People have mourned about football ticket sales, as well as problems oc­curring in relationships. 
Some specific examples of bizarre calls may shed light on the mysterious side of the FRED line. They also will serve as testimony to the ingenuity of the student body. While some of these calls were possibly in­tended to be serious, it is highly unlikely that they all were. 
Looking at the structure of the academic year, one student commented that classes should not be held on Mondays or Fridays. Another felt that classes should start later in the year so that students would have time to build their lofts. 
The area of campus im­provements brought yet an­other interesting request. Apparently nighttime waders through the Hesburgh reflect­ing pool were shocked to dis­cover that, upon emergence from the water, their legs had turned blue. It was suggested that the dye presently used in the pool be removed to avoid further incidents. 
Some socially conscious sug­gestions have been made. For example, a student requested that the gold in the dome be melted down and the proceeds used to feed the hungry people of the world. 
The mention of bizarre calls to the FRED line would be in­complete without the mention­ing of the line's regular caller. This caller claims to be, incred­ible as it may sound to political science majors, to be the high ranking official which leaked the Watergate scandal, "Deep Throat." This notable official, now a resident of Pangborn Hall, has observed various in­justices occurring on the cam­
pus grounds. 
One of "Deep Throat's" ob­servations was made at the South Dining Hall. Note that this observation has been summarized to remove what seemed to be suspiciously off­color details. Much to a stu­dent's dismay, he was only al­lowed to remove two pieces of fruit from the cafeteria instead of three. The third piece of fruit was confiscated by a cafe­teria employee. The official was also rudely kicked off South quad during a pickup baseball game. 
MDeep Throat" has expressed great confidence in Fred. One of the official's messages closes with "Fred, I believe you, I trust you, and I know you can do something about this." There are rumors of a possible plot by MDeep Throat" to place Fred in power as President, although details are uncertain. 
Among the really bizarre calls, Fred and Rob have re­ceived interesting propositions. Supposedly the line is helping them to gain dates, as well as hear from admirers. One fe­male in the office uses the line to make comments about Rob's physique. 
As a final note, the student government seems pleased with the response to the line. And what about the origin of the name? Well, apparently Fred never knew about the name un­til it was installed, and there­fore he had no way of knowing what would hit him.

Notre Dame stumbles in Rl volleyball tourney 
By ROLANDO DE AGUIAR Sports Writer 
Entering the Rhode Island Tournament last weekend, the Notre Dame women's volleyball team needed a boost in order to catapult itself into the toughest part of its schedule. Unfortunately for the Irish (5-5). the weekend did not prove to be the springboard coach Art Lambert had hoped it would be, as the team came away with only one win. The weekend did not start off well for the Irish. Facing Sherbrooke, a team from Canada, the Irish found trouble. After losing the first game 15-9, Notre Dame staged a short-Jived comeback, taking the second game 16-14. However, the Irish were put away quickly in the third and fourth games, 15-10, 15-13 by the Vert & Or. On a bittersweet note, the loss was not added to the Irish record due to the international standing of the match. Notre Dame looked better in the second match of the day against Syracuse, which posted a 28-9 record in 1989. The Orangemen (9-7) went down easily in the first game, 15-10, but stormed back to take games two and three, 15-8, 15-9. Notre Dame rolled in the 
fourth game, 15-6, and fought for the fifth game, winning 16-14. The match was highlighted by 17 kills by sophomore hitter Jessica Fiebelkorn and the 50 assists 
set  by  freshman  Janelle  
Karlan.  
. In  the  weekend's  closer  

against the University of Rhode Island, Notre Dame came out strong, but fizzled. The Irish put URI away in the first game, 15-10. Rhode Island took the second game, 15-11. Notre Dame came back in the third, 15-13, but then the host Rams (6-4) took control, winning the fourth and fifth sets, 15-9, 15-10. "We didn't do enough," said Coach Art Lambert, who was hardly pleased with the team's performance this weekend. "We have to im­prove our blocking, which did not exist." Notre Dame will host Penn State and Miami (Ohio) on Friday and Saturday, respec­tively. During the weekend of October 5, the Irish host the Golden Dome Classic, which includes such strong teams as Hofstra, Oklahoma, and Louisiana State. "We are beginning the teeth of our schedule," said Lambert. "The teams in our early season were only . 500 
teams. We've got some seri­ous thinking to do, and some

"They (MSU) took advantage 
of a mistake and made it stand 
up," said Petrucelli. "It's tough 
to win when you don't score 
any goals." 
Notre Dame's frustration be­
came apparent when Head 
Coach Mike Berticelli and 
Petrucelli were both given red 
cards for arguing with the ref­
eree at the 85-minute mark, 
forcing them to leave the game. 
Assistant Coach John 
Stollmeyer was left to coach the 
remaining five minutes. 
The Irish then traveled to 
Milwaukee, Wis., to face the 
Marquette Warriors Sunday 
afternoon, hoping to erase 
some of the bad luck that had 
plagued the team ever since it 
shelled Valparaiso over a week 
ago. 

That good-luck leprechaun 
must have been exhausted 
after helping the Irish football 
team past Michigan State, 
because he certainly didn't 
follow the soccer team from 
East Lansing, Mich., to 
Milwaukee. 
The Irish, starting freshman 
Matt Fitz in goal after he re­
placed Peter Gulli in the second 
half of the MSU game, played 
well in the first half against the 
Women

1:04 left in the game, as her shot deflected off a Spartan defender and into the opposite corner of the net, well beyond the reach of the Michigan State goalie who had fallen and could not get up. 
"When Tasha scored her goal, we were really at that point where we'd had so many chances that everybody on the field felt like we were going to get one sooner or later," noted Petrucelli. "Michigan State is probably the best Division I team that a Notre Dame team has ever beaten. This was really a great victory for our program, and the kids are excited about it. 
"If you look at the history of this program, Notre Dame lost to Michigan State 4-0 last year. But this year, we really played well and deserved to win that game." 
Key to the Notre Dame win, aside from the entire defensive unit, were Strawbridge and Roemer. In her last three games, Strawbridge has scored five goals, including a crucial tally against Saint Joseph's and the game-winner against Michigan State. Roemer, meanwhile, has provided a tremendous spark off of the bench. 
"I think we have to recognize that since her injury, Tasha Strawbridge has really come on," reflected Petrucelli. "It has been a big difference for us the way she has come off the bench and lifted the team. 
Warriors. 
Going into half time the game was a scoreless tie, but it didn't take long after the intermission for that to change. Just 25 seconds into the second stanza, a barrage that would last until the closing minutes of the game began. 
At the 45:25 mark, the Warriors' Josh Norman took a pass from James Daneher at put it past Fitz to notch the first score for Marquette. Eight minutes later, Jay Spatzek got into the act, scoring the first of his two unassisted goals after 
53:54 had passed in the game, to make the score 2-0. 
Fitz and the Irish defense were able to buckle down for over 30 minutes, hoping in vain for the ND offense to get the game back within reach, but ul­timately Marquette broke Notre Dame's lines and put the game away. 
Spatzek again beat the Irish defense and scored at the 85:02 mark to seal the fate of Notre Dame. Then, to add insult to InJury, Marquette's Matt Breines added an unassisted goal with just under three min­utes to play to make the final score 4-0 in favor of the Warriors. 
With those two losses, the Irish capped a week in which 
The same is true of Marta Roemer, but without the goal production. Marta has changed games and covered up for us when we have made mistakes." 
Also instrumental in the Irish win was forward Susie Zilvitis, who did not score, but provided a tremendous distraction for the Michigan State defense. 
"I thought that Susie Zilvitis was dangerous all weekend," stated Petrucelli. "Sometimes people do not see her contribu­tion unless she scores goals. She draws attention to herself because every time she gets the ball the other team goes into a panic. Just having Susie on the field creates scoring chances for us." 
On Sunday morning against Marquette, Notre Dame again put on a first-class perfor­mance, but could not finish the pesky club team. The Lady Warriors drew first blood early in the matchup, but the Irish quickly proceeded to tie and dominate the game. Alison Lester had the lone goal for the Irish, while Zilvitis was awarded an assist. 
"We played very well against Marquette," said Petrucelli. "I was concerned after the Michigan State game that we would come out flat. We started slow and gave up a goal early that we probably shouldn't have given up. From then on, we played very well. 
"We totally dominated every aspect of the game. We had shots hit the post four times, went one-on-one with the goalie three times without scoring and Marianne Giolitto missed a penalty kick. Still, for 
"I never said we were the number-one team," he said.

they played four games in seven days. Notre Dame now has until Friday to rest, regroup, and solve several problems before it faces last year's NCAA co-champions, the Indiana Hoosiers. 
One of the most pressing of the problems for ND is the lack of offense. After scoring six times against Valparaiso, Notre Dame's offense has deserted it. The Irish have now gone three games and eight days without posting a score. 
Another question mark for the Irish is at goalkeeper. Freshman Matt Fitz replaced junior Peter Gulli after the lat­ter surrendered only one goal, on a penalty kick, in Friday's game. Fitz did not allow an­other goal against Michigan State, but was rocked for four goals in the Marquette game. 
"It was a tough stretch of games, especially since we were losing," said senior co­captain Danny Stebbins. "It's been a hard season. We've kind of been unlucky, but you make your own luck. A couple days of rest and practice, and we'll come together. 
With the way things have been going for the team, they'll take any kind of luck they can get, even if it isn't from the leprechaun. 
most of the game, we totally 
dominated." 
Once again, the Notre Dame defense saved the day, holding Marquette to less than three shots. 
"Margaret Jarc, Marianne Giolitto and Stephanie Porter have totally dominated the midfield in the last three games," said Petrucelli. "Those three players dictate how we will play. If they play well or decide that they will work hard, then everybody does the same. Michelle Lodyga has also been very solid in goal." 
Going into the weekend's ac­tion, Notre Dame was ranked tenth in the midwest region. Michigan State, on the other hand, had been ranked sixth. All things considered, recent performances by the Irish have significantly enhanced Notre Dame's push for regional prominence. 
"I think that we're really starting to play well," ex­claimed Petrucelli. "Our brand of soccer is an attractive style right now. We're playing to­gether very well, and I think that we're exciting and fun to watch. Everybody who is play­ing is playing very well and the bench is doing a great job for us. We have made great strides from the first day of preseason to now. 
"Looking at the past, I don't think that anybody can match what we've done so far. Marquette beat Notre Dame 3­0 last year. We believe that we can play with anybody and I think that we have shown that on the field." 
A look at the Irish schedule ­the toughest in the country ­shows that the last two weekends could become the rule rather than the exception. 
"I can't control the future," 
Holtz said. "I just take it." So far, he likes what he

Clemens given 
O.K. to pitch 

Friday against rival Blue Jays 
BOSTON (AP) -Boston's Roger Clemens, sidelined with a sore right shoulder since Sept. 4, was given medical clearance to pitch on Friday against the Toronto Blue Jays. 
"He plans to throw on Tuesday and he's looking forward to pitching on Friday," Dr. Arthur Pappas, the Red Sox' doctor, said Monday at a news conference at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester. 
"Roger feels he has pitched through more than this in the past," Pappas said after exam­
.. ining the two-time Cy Young Award winner. "Roger wants to pitch and he feels he can pitch Friday night." Pappas, an orthopedic spe­cialist, emphasized that there is nothing seriously wrong with Clemens' right shoulder. "There is no problem with his rotator cuff," Pappas said. "There is no structural damage within his shoulder." Clemens, 20-6 with a 1. 98 earned run average, was stricken with severe tendinitis on Sept. 4 when he lasted just 5 1-3 innings and had an eight­game winning streak snapped by Oakland. After daily medication to re­duce inflammation and fluid buildup in the front of the shoulder, he aired out his arm last Tuesday, throwing 80 pitches in the bullpen in Baltimore. 
Detmer 
continued from page 16 

his performance in big games and his ability to bring his team team from behind. On Sept. 8 Detmer completed 38 of 54 passes to lead Brigham Young to a 28-21 triumph over Miami, which was the top­ranked team in the country at the time. And on Sept. 15 he rallied the Cougars from a 29-7 deficit against Washington State, throwing three touchdown passes in the last 15 minutes of a 50-36 BYU victory. 
Vaughn has not exactly been racking up the yards against a bunch of slouches, either. His 201-yard performance came against a top-ranked Notre Dame team which gave up only 117 yards rushing against the entire Michigan State team on Saturday. And UCLA, which is having an off-year, is still al­ways a decent team. 
Some of the credit for Vaughn's success will go to a Michigan offensive line which may be the biggest and best in the country. Likewise, a portion of Detmer's success will be credited to the sophisticated passing attack of Brigham Young coach La Veil Edwards, and a weak Cougar schedule.
-
Virginia quarterback Shawn Moore, who was a preseason favorite just like Detmer, might sneak into the race, too. Moore has completed 53 of 7 4 passes for 831 yards in four games this season, but he will play against an even weaker 
-
schedule with the Cavaliers than Detmer will this year, and he will almost certainly end up with inferior numbers. 
So if Vaughn and Detmer continue to perform like they have in the first few weeks of the season, it will be difficult to give the Heisman to another candidate. It will also be dif­ficult to choose between them.

Notre Dame both lucky and good in early going 
Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz sat alone in the lockerroom after the Irish had just rallied to defeat Michigan State 20-19 on Saturday afternoon. 

Greg Guffey 
Sports Editor 

His eyes were fixed straight ahead, somewhat oblivious to the congratulatory words thrown his way. His expression looked like he couldn't believe what had happened the past two weeks. At times, he looked like he was waiting for the players to leave so he could clean the lockerroom, not like the coach who had just won his second consecutive close game. 
When the talk turns to war at the next family reunion ­his father was in the Pacific theatre and his uncle in the Battle of the Bulge -Holtz can say that he participated in two in September of 1990. 
He looked battle-weary, but he was victorious. And in war, that counts for something. 
"I don't think anybody has any idea what it's like to be the football coach at Notre Dame," Holtz said. "Every week, big games, big opponents." 
In the past two weekends, Notre Dame has overcome fourth-quarter deficits to post big victories. The Irish were behind 24-14 to Michigan two weeks ago, but came back to win 28-24. They were down 19­7 to Michigan State and came out with a 20-19 triumph. 
Those victories have led many to call this one of the luckiest teams ever. Sometimes, it is better to be lucky than good. But the Irish have been both. 
"We've been lucky but we've had some bad luck too," Holtz said. "Good luck and good things happen to those who play hard." 
As each week passes, the Irish solidify their position at number one. The target on their chest grows at a propor­tional rate. 
"It's getting harder," said Irish linebacker Scott Kowalkowski. "Everybody is shooting for us." 
Says tailback Ricky Watters, "How can we relax after two games like that? We haven't had a complete game yet."

Men's soccer team loses to Michigan State, Marquette 
By RICH KURZ 
Sports Writer 

The leprecha.un that has been following the Notre Dame football team, guiding it to last­minute victories the past two weekends, obviously hasn't had time to follow the men' s soccer team. 
The Irish (2-6-1) dropped two games over the weekend, losing to Michigan State 1-0 Friday night and getting battered 4-0 by Marquette Sunday afternoon. 
The Michigan State game was played on a wet, muddy field that had been torn up by the women's game that immediately preceded the men's game. The playing conditions were definitely to the Spartans' advantage. 
"It (the field) affected us," said Assistant Coach Chris Petrucelli. "They were bigger and faster, and we were smaller and quicker. It slowed us down." 
Regardless of the field condi­tions, the final box-score on the game indicated the parity of the two teams. The Irish had only two shots on goal while the Spartans managed only four, leading to two saves by MSU goalkeeper Pat Trese and three saves for Notre Dame (two by Peter Gulli and one by Mike Fitz). Furthermore, Michigan State had only two corner kicks, while ND had just five. 
In a game in which the two teams played as evenly as Notre Dame and Michigan State did Friday evening, a single break for one team determines the outcome of the game. And this was one such game. 
Unfortunately for the Irish, the break went to the Spartans. A handball in the goalie's box by aND player led to a penalty kick for Michigan State with just under 10 minutes left in the first half. Carl Hofinger hit the shot in the lower left corner of the goal, scoring what proved to be the deciding goal. 
No matter how the Irish tried, an offense that has been anemic since the Valparaiso game simply could not put the ball in the net, making the Spartans' lone goal the decid­ing score.

Irish women defeat Spartans,tie Warriors 
By DAVID DIETEMAN 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame women's soccer team (5-2-1) trounced Michigan State and tied Marquette this weekend, helping itself to a good measure of success in midwestern regional action. 
On Friday, Notre Dame capi­talized on two deflected balls ­one with 1:04 remaining in the contest -as it tromped the Spartans 2-1. Oddly enough, the Irish football team would pick up on the women's "deflected ball motif', as well as its "last­second victory motif" to sneak past the Spartan football team 20-19 barely 24 hours later. 
"We played an excellent game," remarked Notre Dame head coach Chris Petrucelli. "We were playing on the road against one of the top teams in our region, and for the most part, we dominated them. 
"It was a scoreless tie at the half, but we really felt like we were in control of the game at that point. It has been said that we were lucky because of the deflected balls, but lucky or not, we were the better team." 
The Irish wasted little time converting their control into goals in the second half, as ju­nior midfielder Marianne Giolitto scored at the 47:34 mark. The shot by Giolitto, which was the first of several

has instead turned the tailback position into an exclamation point under new coach Gary Moeller. 
Vaughn, who gained only 11 yards on 10 carries last season as a freshman, opened the season with a 201-yard performance in a 28-24 loss to Notre Dame on Sept 15. He improved on that Saturday in his second game of the year, gaining 288 yards on 32 carries against UClA Both of those games were seen by a national television audience; Vaughn has achieved nationwide attention in a hurry. 
Detmer, meanwhile, was expected to live up to the tradition that former Cougar quarterbacks Jim McMahon, Steve Young and Robbie Bosco had laid out for him. As a sophomore last season he broke or tied 13 NCAA records. In last year's Holiday Bowl, a 50-39 Cougar loss to Penn State, Detmer passed for more yards (576) than any other player ever has in any bowl game. 
The San Antonio native has been sensational this season as well. Saturday he completed 26 of 38 passes for 514 yards and three touchdowns in a 62-34 win over San Diego State. That brought his season totals to 129 of 189 (68.3 percent), and 1,755 yards (439 yards per game).
