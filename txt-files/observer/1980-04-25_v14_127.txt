WASHINGTON (AP) -The White House announced early today that a daring military 
·effort to rescue American hos­tages held in Tehran was aborted because of "equipment failure." A collision of two U.S. 
aircraft on the ground in an 
Iranian desert resulted in the deaths of eight crewmen, the. announcement said.

~ebUeasksforrevarnp 
of CLC at Board meeting 
by Pam Degnan News Editor 
Describing the existing student government structure as "incredibly decentralized", Paul Riehle, student body president, called for a revamping of the structure and questioned the validity of the Campus Life Council(CLC) at a Board of Commissioners meeting held last night. -Riehle stated to the seven out of nine board members who were present at the meeting that "there is no central unit 
· where student government comes together." He furth6 added that student government must be structured as to make it ·'more accountable to students.'' 
Frustration and apathy characterize student government on this campus, according to Riehle. ­
"Student government is so nebulous that so many students don't know what's going on, and as a result they really don't care," Riehle said. 
Another board member commented that student apathy does exist due to the ineffectiveness of administrative policies. "Students see only the failures of student government and therefore are turned off'', he said. 
On the validity of the CLC, Riehle commented that 3/4 of the student body do nor understand the differences between the CLC, the HPC and the Board of CommissiOners. He added that the CLC is an "ineffective" organization and should be either restructured or dissolved. 
Riehle's proposal to restructure student governmep.t includes setting up a constitutional convention, early next fall, to allow the students to choose their type of representation. . 
According to the newly-elected president, an 'ideal' type of government would feature a student senate that would be the main body of student representation and which would be solely responsible for the allocation of fu,nds. 
~ T d like to see many more pe0ple enthused about their student g<wernmeot. But no one seems to know what's going on." Riehle concluded. ­

Powell said the injured per­sons are expected to recover.

"The United States continues to hold the government of Iran responsible for the safety of the American hostages. The United States remains deter­mined to obtain their safe release at the earliest possible time."

Iran threatens closure ofPersian-Gulfarea­
by The Assoczated Press 
Iran threatened yesterday to cut off the West's vital Persian Gulf oil lifeline if the United States mines Iranian ports. 
"We shall close the Persian Gulf at any price," Foreign Minister Sade~h Ghotbzadeh said in an mterview with Iranian radio and television. 
He did not say just how the Iranians might try to halt the supertanker traffic out of the gulf; which accounts for some 60 percent of all world oil exports. But if they succeed­ed, it would abruptly cut off 10 percent of the United States' oil. and higher proportions for Western Europe and Japan. 
The threat came as the Iran­ians edged closer to the Soviet Union economically in the face of growing Western pressure to win the freedom of the U.S. Embassy hostages. 
The Soviets confirmed they would open their highway sys­tem to increased Iranian traffic if President Carter orders a blockade of Iranian seaports; and they announced they were resuming suspended negotiat­ions to buy Iranian natural gas. The war in rebellious Kurdis­tan raged on, meanwhile. A Turkish newspaper report told

In Tehran, the 50 American hostages spent their 173rd day in captivity. 
President Carter said last week military action would be the next U.S. option if econom­ic and diplomatic pressure by America and its allies did not lead to the hostages' release. The principal tactic under con­sideration is a sea blockade, most likely by mining Iranian ports.

Navy has had to scrounge for air-to-air missiles to arm its warplanes aboard carriers sta­tioned near the Persian Gulf, Pentagon sources said yester­day. 
"We've had to draw from other areas and put most of our eggs in the Indian Ocean basket,'' said one source who asked to remain anonymous. 
Asked about reports that planes on the carriers Nimitz and Coral Sea were shott of Sidewinder, Sparrow and Phoenix missiles, the Navy said it deploys its forces ''with sufficient munitions, including missiles, to perform their assigned operational mis­sions." The Navy would not elaborate beyond that state-. ment. 
However, Pentagon sources said there is an overall shortage of missiles used by jet fighters for air combat because the Carter Administration has for 
several years held down money requests to Congress for such weapons. 
As a result, these sources said, the Navy did have a munitions problem in the

The Carter administratoin has proposed increasing its purchase of Sparrow missiles for the Navy and Marine Corps from 240 this year to 770 in fiscal 1981. But it plans to cut back its buy of Navy-Marine Sidewinder missiles from 320 to 220 and to keep its procurement of Phoenix weapons at a low level of 60 next year. 
The new Sparrow and Side­winder missiles will be improv­ed and more effective models, experts said.

From Cuba 
Refugees pour into U.S. 
KEY WEST, Fl11. '-t\P) -The "freedom float" flotilla brought hundreds more refugees from Cuba to the United States yesterday as the State Depart­ment indicated it was reassess­in~ its. stern stand against the mtgrauon. r  
State Department spokesman Thomas Reston said the Coast Guard was under instructions to broadcast warnings that picking up the Cuba immigrants was illegal. Immigration officials have said boat owners could be fined or charged with smuggl­mg. 
But Reston also said that because of the large number of boats involved, ''we will have to attempt to assess it as we go along, taking into account the humanitarian concerns and the law.'' 
White House Press SecretaryJody Powell also said the administration was assessing ''how to deal with that fairly rapidly changing situation.'' 
-About 300 refugees bad ar­rived in Key West by late afternoon, bringing to about 
1,300 the number who have 
landed since Sunday, when Cuban President Fidel Castro told exiles in Florida they could pick uf. relatives at the port of Marie, gateway-for the boatlift. 
The offer came two weeks after more than 10,000 Cubans jarrimed into the Peruvian em­bassy in Havana, seeking safe passage out of their Communist homeland. 
On .Wednesday, Castro's government expanded his boat-lift offer, saying anyone who wanted to leave Cuba could go to Marie!. For each relative picked up, exiles reportedly must take four other refugees. 
The expanded offer reportedly touched off frenzied efforts by thousands of Cubans in Havana to contact relatives in exile. 
The usually easy-going island city of Key West was chaotic, with exiles flashing fistfuls of money to boat captains, buying passage for relauves. 
Larry Rodriguez, Key West's director of public safety, said one woman carried a suitcase stuffed with $75,000 as she sought to charter a boat. 
Harried U.S. officials specu­lated Castro's announcement could trigger an exodus of hundreds of thousands. A stern statement from Washington said the boatlift was undermin­ing international efforts to evacuate the estimated 9,500

Boat operators have ignored State Department reminders that bringm~ illegal aliens into the country ts a crime. 
"I understand there are a thousand boats off the Cuban coast," said Rodrigues. "We're talking about maybe 14,000 people."

'Tower wars' may end

SeU Lock Storage ot McKinley
due to recent incident 
by Tim Vercellott StaffReporter 
The recent "tower wars" were a subject of discussion at a 
meeting of the Grace Hall council last night. According to Paul Rafferty, Grace Hall pres-

idem,  no  judicial  action  has  
been  decided,  "due  to  the  
recency of the matter."  
Rafferty  pointed  out  that  

occurrences such as those of Wednesday night could have implications for the towers. "The rock throwing incident may lead to the end of tower wars," Rafferty explained. 
According to Rafferty, the "wars" are not indicative of any hard feelings between 

'Flanner and Grace, they are simply manifestations of hall enthusiasm. "There is no hatred between Flanner and Grace, but at times people will band to~ether for the sake of hall spint,' · Rafferty said.

(EDITOR'S NOTE · The writer filed this dispatch after three weeks' of travel inside Cambodia.) 
by Denis D. Gray Assoczated Press Writer 
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (Ap) -Great believers in ma­gic, soothsayers and the stars, Cambodians say a Buddhist prophecy promises that a young king imbued with reli­gion will one day liberate them from ''the men who came from the East.'' 
. The Easterners are clearlv the Vietnam( ·se, who now dom'­inate this shattered land. Buc the young king has yet to appear on the horizon. The people are being steered toward a future that for now at least they have no power to change. 
The prophecy has gained such wide curre:ncy in Cambod­ia that i-t reportedly has been discussed by Communist offi­cials at political education courses. But the offirials have their own interpreta,twn: the king represents the triumph of revolution, the end of all cycles of political change in Cambod­ia, the "irreversiblf·" march tbwards a socialist, pro-Viet­namese, pro-Soviet society. 
While the United States and most other non-communist countries still talk about'coali­tion governments, the return of onetime leader Prince Nrodom Sihanouk, and a neutralist, internationally sponsored solu­tion in Camb')dia, this march. continues, however haltingly.

An astonishing voter turnout and the need for two subsequ­ent runoffs highlighted Samt Mary's class and hall elections yesterday, according to Mary Mullaney, SMC Election Com­missioner. The class of '80 will hold a run-off between the BeckmanIKras /WelshI Murray ticket and the Hill/ O'Brien/Stoll/Boyle ticket.

constitution, general elections for a government and major policy statements on such is­sues as land reform and agri­cultural organization. A Cam­
. bodian Communist Party, with solidly pro-Vietnamese Com­munists at the helm, may also be unveiled, but building the party and the Communist state has not been easy. Much of the country's educated class was eliminated during the 1975-79 pre-Chinese commun­ist regime of Prtmier Pol Pot, and many of the survivors have either fl~d or do not appear eager to embrace the commun­ist way. 
"People thought there would be a change of direction after the fall of 'Pol Pot but instead there was only a change of drivers," is a phrase currently making the rounds. 
But unquestionably the single most overwhelming fact m today's Cambodia -oversha­dowing anxiety about commun­ism, fear of long-term Viet­namese domination and even the daily struggle for rice -is the bloody legacy of Pol Pot. 
Talk of coalition govern­ments and even the immediate withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, whidi appear uniformly resented, elicits shudders of fear. Pol Pot, still in the jungles leading a guerrilla ar­my, is still diplomatically re­cognized by most of the world. 
One fear expressed among Cambodians willing to talk to foreigners is that Pol Pot woL~;ld not change his policies that resulted in so much death if he could again wield power

In the hall elections, a run-off in LaMans is needed for the Breslin ticket which received 49 percent against the 47 percent the Margargle ticket obtained. Pam Herbstand and Ann Yaegar won the Holy Cross officer election with 50.9 per­cent of the vote against the Sullivan ticket with 28 percent of the vote and the Madorian bid with_ 12 percent. 
President and \ice-President for McCandless are Scanlon and Toomey, who received 51 percent of the vote, against

The motives of the recent crackdown on the local bars have been questioned by stu­dent leaders. When police were asked if they were receiv­ing pressure from the mayor's office Police Chief Michael Borkowski replied, "Yes, defin­itely." He quickly qualified his answer, however, by saying 
· ~hat Parent is sim(>ly respond-mg to the -complamts of area residents about the bars. 
"The suggestion that the mayor's office is operating under some design is without factual base," Hill said. "We just want to make thin~s better for everyone, includmg stu­dents." 
An interesting aspect of the current crackdown on the bars is a law known as a "controlled use ordinance." This ordin­encc places certain restrictions upon establishments whose patrons are "controlled," that

adult bookstores, and X-ratea theatres are regulated by a section of the law which prohib­its the opening of such estab­lishments within 1000 feet of another bar. 
The implication in this case is that if a bar is closed by the ABC, and it is located within 1000 feet of another bar, the bar cannot be reopened. Thus, if Corby's is closed, it cannot be reopened because it is within 1000 feet of another bar, Bridget McGuire's. 
"The purpose of this ordin­ance i~ to prevent concentra­tions of bars and bookstores in one area," Hill said. "How­

--.«ver, the bars on Eddy Street were all .. opened before the ordinence was enacted, and thus not affected,'' he explain­ed. "But it is true that if one of those bars is closed, it probably could not be reopened," he concluded.

An Tostal Boycott 
Two nights ago, the "Sorin College" _plaque 
which has hung over the porch of Sonn Hall 
was kidnapped and is now bein~ held hostage 
by an unknown party. Reactions from hall 
members ranged from ~oder:'ltes wh? urge~ 
calm negotiation, to reacnonanes who Immedi­
ately wanted t? begin burni~g . other ND 
residence halls m random retaltanon. After 
much debate the moderates won out and the 
following sanctions were taken: . 
First, Sorin will boycott the upcommg An fostal festivities and will refuse to send a chariot team to the chariot race this weekend. The decision to boycott was a difficult one, especially ~ince the ~<?rio squad was victorious in last year s competition. One ~ember of th_e ~hariot team remarked that whtle he and h1s counterparts had been training ceaselessly for the enure semester, "there are some things you have to place above athletics. 0'-:lr hall is of a singk mind that until the plaque 1s returned we're not going to compete in campus-wide activities.'' 
Second if the plaque is not returned by tomorrow' at noon, Sorin will ask all other residence halls who sympathize with the Sorin position to boycott the finals of Bookstore basketb~ll on Sunday afternoon. "I think if we· are really the-extremely close school that everyone seems to think we are, we should have no problem getting the other halls to go along," rem~rke~ one Sori!l resident. . 
Third Sonn w11l reduce Its representation to the HPC, CLC, and other campus organiza­tions. At the same time, Sorin will demand that other dorms reduce the number of their representatives who visit Sorin_. St_udy. and discussion groups currently held m Sonn w1ll be cancelled. All off-campus residents who have outstanding bills at Sorin food sales will have their bills immediately i_mpo~nded. Pla'?-s ha_ve been made with offic1als 10 the Umvers1ty Student Accounts office to charge the accounts of those individuals with the outstanding bills. These monies would be subsequently trans­ferred to Sorio. 
A fourth step which is under consideration is a blockade by Sorin reside'?-ts of ot_her resident halls. This could be done m a vanety of ways which Sorin officials refused to disclose. "Let's just say that it wouldn't be pretty," one source said. He noted this step would be a last resort, <:topping short of all-"ut hostilities.

One  R.A.  went  on  to  list  what  the  
consequences  would  be  if the  other  dorms  
refused to back Sorin up.  .  

"We'd probably start with cutting off delivery of food sales pizzas to the women's dorms we have been serving in the past. Next would come the dissolution of the Sorin pep rally and that would probably be followed by a general boycott of campus social events. A final step I hope will be avoided, is the option we have of cutting off admittance to our game room. It's no secret that members of the ND/SMC community come from as far away as Carroll Hall to use the Space Invaders machine. But if all else fails, we'd have no choice," he said. 
Of course not all hall members are united behind the decision to boycoti: An Tostal. One resident scheduled to compete in both the mattress race and the egg throwing contest vowed that he would compete as an indepen­dent no matter how the situation may worsen. "I've traint'd too hard and too long to let something like the plaque being vandalized hold me back now," the resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said. ''The price of eggs at the huddle has gone out of sight and I've been breaking them in practice at the rate of a dozen a day. It's myself not my hall for whom I compete," he added.  At a press conference late last night Sorin 
R.A.s announced that measures would be taken to prevent any Sorin resident from competing as an individual. "At seven tomorrow the doors of Sorin will be sealed and nobody will be allowed out. In fact, we will be holding our own An Tostal in our spacious party room which will be converted into a triple next semester. All residents will have a chance to compete," they stated. 
What will this mean for the future of An Tosral and campus stability. in general? One can only guc:ss. As it stands now it does not look like the plaque will be returned before An Tostal swings into full gear today. Unless the senseless terrorists who stole the plaque return it soon, Sorinites predict that the situation may get out of hand. 
''We can only hold the reactionary element of the dorm back for so long," one influential resident stressed last night. "If we don't get our plaque rt"turned soon, the reactionaries may prevail."

Crime affects all 
Dear Editor: 
April 21st's edition of The Observercarried a front-page article by ] ohn M. Higgins on off-campus crime. The article reflects the outbreak of concern due to two recent murders. Despite the fact that· the two victtms were both non-stu­
. dents, the emphasis of concern is focused on the student body. 
With regard to the problem of crime and what students can do to protect themselves, Hig­
' gins quott~s Brother Edward Luther as having said that a key solution would be for students to consider ''themselves as part of the neighborhood, rather than as temporary residents." He then goes on to say that " Luther also recommends es­tablishing a good relationship with neig~bors ~s a , ~ood tool for deternng cnme. · Luther· appears to be advocating a greater community spirit here. 
This attitude is reinforced by 
oft~.Campus Commissioner Mark Kelley -"A big problem is that students don't see them­selves as residents of the neighborhood." .... "We're try­ing to get them more interested in the neighborhood as a neigh­borhood and not just as a place to live for a year.'' Admirable sentiments you might say, and 
not  just  in  regard  to  crime  
prevention.  
To  achieve  such  goals,  a  

greater unity of purpose and life between students and non­students should be provoked. 
However, Luther and Kelley after such a good start, both go on with statements that would seem calculated to provoke resentment and disunity. Luther -''One problem we have is that the police don't make any distinction if a stu­dent is the victim of crime." Kelley: "Students must report incients to both the South Bend police and Notre Dame securi­ty. We need something con­crete to bring to the police. We can't just tell them that there's a lot ofcrime." 
Why not, Mark? You want a community spirit, and then you ask for preferential treatment for students in the face ofone of the grossest aggressors on com-

munity spirit -Crime, especi­ally murder. Do you want a community spirit that just forms the students, an artificial community? 
In the April 22nd edition of The Observer there is another front page article on crime, this time by Mark Rust. To quote Rust: ''The extent of student victimization is hard to pinpoint since the police have not kept statistics which indicate a vic­tim's student status." More preferential treatment being advocated. 
Rust later on states that neither of the murder victiq~s was a student. So what1 Makes death easier to take, huh? 
So there's a m~eting fo'r off-campus students tomorrow? 
.And no indication that non­students might be welcome. Well instead oflooking for ways you can have preferential treat­ment, why not look for ways that the students and non­students would act together. For example don't tell there is too much crime affecting stu­dents. Join forces with non­students and just leave i at there is too much crime affect­ing everybody.· Who know~, it could start a trend? 
Something else tha1 could, and should be called for, is that if any students c~n offer any information of anything suspi­cious on either of the murder nights, to come forth and do so. I was disgusted not to find this or similar suggestion in either of The Observer articles. If a student had died mobilization would have been on a huge scale. Death is death, murder is murder, violence is a lie. Do you people want communitY or are you the new Aryan race?

ND Prof Uncovers lEA Scandal 
Bdit,Jr's Note: 1!1 December, 1979, Notre Damt Professor Richard S. Newfarrl.'er :mel associates Barbara I::pstein am/ Kurt Rudolf Mz'row published a re_tJort exposing the oligopolzstic .lctititie:: ofthe Interna­tional Electn'cal.1ssociat/on, :z group offifty jive Europeau ar. d j,zpanese firms attempting to control the in­ternational market for hea'Y elec­m·cal equzpment through pn.ce-fix­ing and bid n'gging. 

Professor Richara' Newfarmer 
The international cartel is generally thought to have gone the way of the dinosaur-a once almighty beast brought to extinnion by 'he anti· trust legislation adopLc..: bv the in dustriahzed nations during the post· war period. However, the secrecv that has traditionall{ enshrouded the esoteric world o i·1fernational trade tends to emasculate these anti-trust laws and, in fact, inter­national cartels continue to exist. In a report published in December, 1979, The Continuing Cartel: Report on the International Electn'cal As­
sociation, Assistant Professor of economics Richard S. Newfarmer, member of the Notre Dame faculty since 1977, .and associates Barbara Epstein and Kurt Rudolf Mirow have exposed the activities of one of the most successful and effective of these cartels: the International Electrical Association (lEA) which through price-fixing, bid-rigging and ( market allocation earns nearly two billion dollars worth of sales a year in heavy electrical equipment. 
The lEA dates back to 1930, when six European and 2 American firms 
(International General Electric and Westinghouse Electric International) negotiated an agreement allowing firms bidding on electrical projt·cts in certain areas of the world to dis­cuss prices and terms of trade. 
A formal agreement was signed in Paris later that year outlining the firms' principal objective: regulation of exports to those regions of the world covered in the agreement­
i.e. those regions of the world that either did not have a com­petitive domestic industry, or were outside the traditional markets of member firms. In addition to these tight market allocations, technology transfers were severely prescribed. 
From this agreement, tht lEA was formally established in 1936 with a membership of 30 producers. Mem­bership declined after World War II when the US Federal trade Commis­sion used antitrust legislation to force American firms to withdraw. How­ever, with the entry of the six major 
Japanese firms in the !at~ sixties, cartel membership surged: current­ly, membership stands at 49 West European and six Japanese firms. The lEA is headquartered in Lau­sanne, Switzerland. 
Newfarmer learned of the exist­ence of the lEA four years ago while studying corporate behavior m South America. 
"I was doing n~search in Brazil in 1976. At that time, a Brazilian businessman (Kurt Rudolf Miro'V) complained to me of predatory beha­vior on the part of multi-nationals.'' Mirow claimed that a multi-national cartel was ganging-up on indepen­dent producers of heavy electrical equipment. (Heavy electrical equip­ment wi'uld include such items as turbines and large generators.) While Newfarmer found the allega­rions interesting, he thought it high-· ly ~mprobable that such a cartel could exist. 
The discovery of a 1948 report by 
the US Federal Trade Commission 
detailing the activities of the lEA 
mo fified Newfarmer's skepticism. 
Tht· FTC report "gave me some 
comprehensive idea of how firms 
collld get together at the internation­
al level. I was very surprised." A 
report by the United Kingdom Mono­
poly and Restrictive Practices Com­
mission, published in 1957, further 
documented the cartel's postwar 
activities. 
None of this evidence, however, supported Mirow' s claim that the cartel was still active. It was only when Newfarmer began to corres­pond with Barbara Epstein, vice­president of the consulting firm Horace . DePodwon Associates and author of a 1971 book on collusive arrangements in the electrical e­quipment industry, that he began to find evidence indicating recent cartel activity. 
A major breakthrough occurred in 1977 while Newfarmer was working with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in Geneva. At thitt time, Newfarmer obtained copiesfM cartel contracts--contracts that provided de­fini~e ~evidence of current arrange­ments. Useful as these documents were, they did not reveal anything about the practices employed to perpetuate these arrangements. 
That information did not come until nearly two years later, in May, 1979, when a former lEA employee, un­happy with the organizauon's activi­ties, leaked several packets of intern­al memoranda to Mirow, who gave them to Epstein and Newfarmer in a meeting later that month. 

From May to December, working out of South Bend and New York, Newfarmer and Epstein met ten times to read over lEA documents together and prepare lists of ques­tions. 
"Every once in a while," New­farmer recalled, "somebody would come up with a brainstorm, and eventually, we were able to piece together the activities of the cartel." Sources inside the industry provided answers to technical questions, and by December, the economists were able to publish their findings. 
The report, paid for by Newfarmer and Epstein themselves, is unique in its descrjption and analysis of the 

market allocation and pricing dis­
cnmmation by which the cartel 
maintains its superior position in the 
international market. 
The high barrier to entry in the 
electrical equipment industry--costly 
research and development, high le­
vels of capital investment, and a 
highly specialized labor force--pro­
tects this superior position by keep­
ing the number of firms in the 
industry small, thereby facilitating 
the establishment and control of 
special agree_m_en_ts_ withint t~~ in­
dustry and mm1m1ztng compeunon. 
The lEA scored a major vicory when the six Japanese joined the cartel. "The Japanese," pointed out Newfarmer, "beginning in the early six'ties, became an .extremely-pro­competitive force in the international economy.'' The entry of thejapan­ese considerably strengthene lEA's market position by eliminating an important source of competition. 
Two impc.rtant agreements bind 
lEA members to its provisions. The 
Tendering and Contracting Agree­
ment establishes the general rules by 
which the lEA sets prices and holds 
meetings among member producers 
prior to tendering on any specific bid. 
It also outlines procedures to deal 
with breach of cartel rules and 
methods df limiting competition. 
The Export Notification Agreement (Agreement X), the central compon­ent of the cartel, requires members to notify lEA headquarters in Lausanne if they rec_eive inquiries from pro­S_{>ective buyers or decide to submit a b1d on a particular project. In this way, lEA firms can know which members are bidding on which projects and can meet before the tendering date to come to an ar­rangement. ­
Market allocation plays an impor­tant role in lEA activities. Newfar­mer discussed how these allocations evolved. ''Essentially, they were allocated historically along traditional spheres of influence ... allocation at the margins was very intense.'' Elaborate licensing agreements helped to perpetuate these traditional divisions. Extensive re-allocation took place after World War II along what Newfarmer labels "the God­father model of economics": the biggest, lowest-cost firms received the biggest market shares. 
These agreements have had an insidious effect on non-producers of heavy electrical equipment, particu­larly Third World countries. Devel­oping countries paid 129.3 percent of the reference price (the reference price is a sort of manufacturer's suggested retail price) on orders purchased from the cartel, as oppos­ed to the 99.6 percent paid by importing developed countries. 
Several factors account for this differential: the existence of anti­trust legislation developed coun­tries more frequently accept bids from only one company), and the difference in negotiating skills. 
Kate Farrell 

The artificially high costs of lEA 
products aggrev~te the chronic prob­
lems ofmany Th1rd World countries. 
Over-priced imports increase balance 
~f pa~ment deficits and fuel domestic 
mflauon, thereby widening the in­
come gap between the developed and 
developing 'nations. 
lEA activities potentially threaten the United States as well. In 1974, the lEA formulated ''Agreement Y'' whereby member firms report the value of the orders received from American bidders to Lausanne. Newfarmer explained this new inter­est in US markets. "The historical spheres of influence are breaking down, which leads to excess capacity and cross-penetration of markets. '' 
Since the US represents 50 percent of the world market for heavy electrical equipment, the lEA under­standably is interested in establish­ing an American foothold. In addition, the decline of the US dollar has made operations within the US mor_e profitable for foreign com­pames. 
The possibility of direct cartel activity having a significant impact in US markets is still relatively remote; a far more dangerous devel­opment is the threat to US export markets. In the last twenty years, many US electrical equipment firms have lost ground to European and Japanese competition, and in their report, Epstein and Newfarmer note that th~ US share of exports to countries within the lEA market area has fallen. Decline in exports contributes to the US balance of payment problem as well as domestic unemployment. 
What action has been taken in the wake of the revelations of the Newfarmer-Epstein report? The report received widespread press coverage, with major articles appear­ing i'l the Washington Post, the German newsweekly Der Speigel, and the Financial Times of London. 
·More concretely, watchdog agen­cies and committees of the US government--the Federal Trade Com­mission, congressional committees, the Justice Department--are investi­gating cartel activity in the US for possible breaches of anti-trust law. 
The success of these investiga­tions, however, is problematic; un­less it can be proved US markets have been adversely affected, no legal action can be taken. 
Newfarmer thinks that even if charges are not brought against the lEA, its effectiveness has been considerably weakened. "It's my feeling that despite its track record of success, the key to the cartel is secrecy, so the more publicity, the more 'sunshine' we can put on the cartel, the more difficult we can make its survival."­

[continued from page 11) 
Security forces stress basic ~afety techniques that are meant to prevent confrontations between rapist and student. Glen Terry h_as encouraged groups like the so~ to speak to _students and secunty personnel alike. Security also provides escort services to t_he .edges of the Campus, although they complain tha_t the ~emand for ndes someumes makes it difficult for them to comply 1rt1m~d1ately to all requests. Rakow estimates Security handles 15-20 calls a mght. . 
One problem Rakow claims he faces often enough 1s t~e rumor of a rape 
that never happened. Certain suspicious acts have m the past been 
misconstrued as sexual assaults and later proved to be false. 
How suct:essful has this new campaign been? According to Security, no on-campus assault has been reported since November. Its continued effectiveness depends on the joint efforts of both students and Security to ::ombat rape.

A new breed of Yankees 
CHICAGO-In the transient world of athletics a world where stars come and go like sun~hin'e on a South Bend spring day, a few constants have managed to survive. Players and teams that remain enamored in the mind and soul regardless of records or ·:alendar year. 
Legends? Perhaps. But there aren't too many. In fact, there are only a few. . 
Like the New York Yankees; the standard of excellence in profe">sional baseball. The Boys trom the Bronx. The Pinstripes. The Yankees have a list of nicknames as long as the list of all-stars that have played on their roster and they've won more world championships than maybe any five teams combined. 
And, along the way, they've picked up quite a following. Not only in New York, but around the world. The old timers that remember seeing the B.a~e clobber one or Gehrig standing o~ deck wamng to do the same thing. The mtddle-aged men who watched because their fathers watched and saw DiMaggio and Mantle and Berra and Whitey Ford. My father always talks of DiMaggio. He says there never was a player like him. He says there never will be. And I thought about all of that when I went to Chicago to see the Yankees play the White Sox. 
I guess I was excited, like the first time I saw Joe Namath play or that day I walked into Notre Dame Stadium for the first time. Sports will do t~at to you if you are willing and can ignore the vmegary cynics that insist it's only a game. Hey, I'm gonna see the New York Yankees for the first ume and it's gonna be great! 
And what a perfect place . for a memory. Comiskey Park sits on the south side of Chicago only a few blocks away from the police-patrolled home where Mayor Richard Daley ran Chicago for so many years. A quaint little neighbor­hood, it bears no resemblance to the streets where Bad, Bad Leroy Brown wreaked havoc in the old Jim Croce song. You don't even need a baseball game to have a good time at Comiskey. There's picnic grounds, and center field bleachers, and even an old time sing-a­long with Harry Caray during the seventh­innmg stretch. Now I can hardly carry a tune, but I belted out the chorus of' 'Take Me Out ot the Ballgame" like a member of the Vienna Boys Choir. Harry is even better than Mitch Miller. 
But it was the Yankees I'd come to see, and maybe I expected too much. Where was DiMaggio and_ Mantle? Aren't Maris and Casey Stengel here? And the Pinstripes! Aren't they supposed to wear Pinstripes with , the button-down shirts and the fancy "NY" emblazoned on their chests? 
These Yankees wear double-knit designer 
uniforms made of (What?) polyester?~ But 
that's the way things are now. A sign of the 
times, no doubt. 
In DiMaggio's place is Reggie Jackson. The 
Yankees raised DiMaggio. They brought him 
up, gave him a glove, told him to make great 
catches and home runs, and he did. Jackson, 
on the other hand, is a different story. While 
DiMaggio was home-grown, Jackson is a foster 
child. The Yankees bought him, gave him a 
glove, told him to make great catches and hit 
home runs, and he did. Sometimes. At other 

Frank .LaGrotta 

times he dropped routine at called third strikes, and complained to anyone with a pencil or a microphone that he was trying, the others .were not. 
DiMaggio talked too much with his bat. Jackson talks too much with his mouth. But Reggie has one thing over Joltin' Joe; he looks much better in polyester. 
Then there's Rich Gossage. 
"Crack!" 

His warm-up pitches sound like gunshots when they hit the catcher's mitt. 
"Thud!" 

Bullpen catcher Johnny Oates squints his eyes 
and flinches on every pitch, like a kid caught 
with his hand in the cookie jar who knows he's 
about to get slapped. 
''Pop!'' 

Goose Gossage makes it all look easy. The 
Yankees are sure lucky to have him, huh? And 
the Pirates, who had him before the Yankees. 
And the White Sox, who had him before the 
Pirates. His fast ball smokes ,Jike-another 
Pinstripe pitcher of 20-year vintage. 

Whitey ford won the Cy Young Award for the 
'!ankees_ m 1~61. Goose Gossage might win it 
10 1980 JUSt ltke Sparky Lyle dtd in 1977 and 
Ron Guidry did in 1978.· Ford started and 
finished his career with the Yankees.· Lyle 
departed the year after he won the award. 
Guidry is unhappy with the money he's making 
and says he might want to leave when he 
becomes a free agent. 

If Gossage wins it, I wonder where he' II go 
next? 

But· anyway, the stands at Comiskey were 
pretty much empty because of the 30-degree, 
.weather but the. 6,000 contained (at least it 
seemed like) as many Yankee fans as home­
team rooters. My dad said it would be that 
way. He said the Yankees have a following 
wherever they go. 

So when the White Sox and the Yankees went 
into the 13th inning, tied at three, the crowd 
pretty much split in their loyalties. It caused 
quite a few arguments and even a few 
''call-in-the-security-guards'' fights. 

I_n the 13th, in the Yankees loaded the bases 
wtth two men out, and catcher Rick Cerrone 
came up to the plate. Cerrone, the replacement 
for the late Thurman Munson, is a youngster. 
Yankee fans know that. In fact, when he came 
to the plate in this critical situation, a New York 
supporter stood up in front of us and yelled to 
the crowd: 

"Now we'll see if this kid is a real Yankee." 
C~rrone struck out on four pitches and the 
Ch1cago rooters berated the old fan unmerci­
fully. 

"_Guess Cerr~me isn.'.t a ~eal Yankee," they 
ch.1ded sarcastically. He JUSt don't belong on 
thts team.'' 

Unfortunately, neither do most of his team­
mates.

"Well, maybe a little," he finally concedes. 
Crable's exceJ?tional athletic ability earned him varsity let­ters in three sports at Moeller High: football, basketball, and baseball. And anyone who has been watching this year's Bookstore Basketball Tourna­ment can attest to the fact that Crable is no slouch on the asphalt. His team, ''The Ass­assins" (which also includes footballers Tony Hunter and Nick Vehr, along with Scott and Curt Bailey), advanced to the "Sweet 16" before falling to Jayne Kennedy on Wednes­day night, 27-25, in overtime. The defeat, though, was no fault of Crable's -he scored eight points on 16 shots and pulled down key rebounds in the overtime.

Tracksters travel...again 
by Matt Huffman Sports Writer 
The much-traveled Notre Dame track squad is on the road again_. This weekend, howe:v~r, will feature two separate Itin­eraries for the squad. On Friday, April25,the prestigious Drake Relays will be attended by Heasf Coach Joe Pi?.nt; and half the Irish squad. Assistant Coach Ed Kelly, himself a former Notre Dame trackman, will rake the remaind'er of the squad to the Ball Statt> Relays 
in Muncie, Ind. on Saturday, April 26. . · 
The Drake Relays will feature nearly all relays and only a few individual events. The two­mile relay will be on the weekend slate, ordinarily the event is not part of the outdoor agenda. 
The relay addition is all the better for Coach Piane's team because of the Irish' outstand­ing two-mile relay team. In 1978 the Irish finished second at the Drake event. The 1980 edition of the team will feature 
· three of the four runners from the '78 squad. Joining Seniors Jay Miranda and Pete Burger and junior Chuck Aragon will be iunior Tim Macauley. Fifth-year assistant Kelly will lead the rest of the team to Muncie. A field of 20 teams is expected, including Northwes· 
Moeller High, Crable was the starting center c;n an overshad­owed basketball team, and he averaged about 16 points a game. 
"I wasn't too bad, actually," he says modestly. "I only played one year, th<?ugh. Aft~r that, I played on a city team m Cincinnati.'' 
Crable also played three years of varsity baseball, play­mg ''just about everywhere,'' as he puts it. "I was a pretty decent hitter (he hit well over .300 for his career), ami they 
had to find  a place for me in  
the lineup.  I played outfield,  
first  base,  shortstop,  second  

base, you name it." .. _ Crable was also a promismg 
young pitcher in his sophomore 
year, but hun his arm, thus 
ending his pitching l·areer. 

But Crable's best sport, by far, is football. And, barring any unforeseen injury, Crable. will don the now-familiar #43 green jersey and take his position at middle linebacker when the Irish open the 1980 campaign Sept~mber 6 against Purdue at Notre Dame Stad­IUm.

[continued from page 16] 
"We weren't what you'd call 

top-ten material,'' laughs the 
redhead, "but we had a great 
time playing." 
The next year, Short joint d Brian Kilbane, Jerry Ander­son, Paul Riehle and tourn­ament commissio~er, Leo Latz, to form a team called Com­missioner Fatz. It was this team that made it to the ''Sweet Sixteen'' and came close ro upsetting the vaunted TILCS of Dave Batton. 
"We were the 'underdog in ~very game," re~alls -.Short, 
·and that made It twtce as 

much fun. The crowds love the 
underdogs in this tournament 
so we had a big following that 
showed up for every game." 
Of course, the Chumps also play in front of a packed house every time they take the court. But now the shoes are on the other feet. 
"Now we're the favorite aud everyone boos us," he says. 
Everyone, that is, except the loyal group of Chumps fans that incliide Short's ~irlfriend, Amy Verardi who joms Hanz­lik's girlfriend, Mary Beth Horne, on the sidelines for every game. But the girls are in the vocal minority. 
"I wish I could play with the guys on this team, and that we could be the underdog for a change,'' suggests Short. 
But he knows that's impos­sible with guys like Bill Hanz­lik, Tom Sudkamp, Chris Muhlenkamp and Rusty Lisch on the roster. Not to mention himself, something the modest Short rarely does. 
"Hey, those guys are the players," he emphasizes. "I'm JUSt out here to have a good time." 
Forget it, Short. The Chumps' secret weapon ain't a secret anymore.
