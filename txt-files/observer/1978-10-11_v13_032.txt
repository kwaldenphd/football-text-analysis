Cease -fire remains intact 
BEIRUT, Lebanon [AP] -An hour-long shootout between Syrian· troops and Christian militiamen and outbreaks of sniper fire yesterday failed to undermine the three-day old cease-fire in east Beirut. Worked out in Damascus by President Elias Sarkis and the Syrian President Hafez Assad, the cease-fire took effect Saturday after 10 days of savage fighting that Lebanese police said left 1,300 dead and 2,000 wo-unded.

IJleporter ordered to jail 
HACKENSACK, N.J. [AP] -New York Times reporter Myron A. Farber refused again to surrender his files on a murder defendant, and a judge ordered him to jail on Thursday unless Farber changes his mind. Farber has served 27 days for refusing to surrender his files on Dr. Mario Jascalevich, the surgeon accused of murdering three patients at Riverdell Hospital in Oradell, N.J., in the mid-1960s. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last Friday that both Farber and the Times are for the time being subject to whatever penalties Trautwein sees fit to impose. The high court has yet to consider on its merits the appeal by Farber and the Times of their contempt citations.

Approved 86-4, the Senate bill includes reductions for virtually all individuals, with benefits tilted toward those. with incomes under $50,000 a year. In addition, it contains major tax cuts for investors, which the Senate refused by a lopsided margin to scale down, and for businesses.

Hall President's Council (HPC) Chairman Chuck DelGrande an­nounced that Dillon Hall has won the Rockne Trophy for the period ending Sept. 26. 
This is the first time in history of the Rockne Trophy that Dillon has been recognized for the award. 
In addition to the regular fresh­man orientation schedule, Dillon included a hall freshman orienta­tion publication, a hall party for all freshmen, a dance primer with Lewis Hall and a scavenger hunt. The hall also carried out its annual pep rally prior to the Missouri game and sponsored happy hours, tailgaters, a pool party with Regina Hall at Saint Mary's and a section football championship. 
Former hall presidents award the trophy monthy to the hall that shows originality, a number of activities and success in campus or hall service. 
Honorable mentions have been given to Walsh and Pangborn Halls for their activities during the past month. 
Clarification 
To clarify yesterday's article in the Observer, the proposed amend­ment to the Disciplinary Proce­dures which would allow parietals violations to be considered by hall J-boards affords students the choice of having their cases consi­dered by the hall J -board or rector. As in the case of all hall offenses, violations of a very serious nature may be heard by the rector or the Dean of Students.

Campbell to speak 

Mid-East lecture series begins· 
by Gregory Solman 
John C. Campbell, long recog­nized as one of the world's leading authorities on the Middle East, inaugurated a new lecture series for the Institute for International Studies with the first of three lectures on "The Great Powers of the Middle East,'' before a crowd of about 100 at the Library Auditor­ium yesterday. 
"The Soviet Union didn't push it's way into the Mideast it was invited there,'' remarked Campbell on the Mid-1950's alignment of the Middle East with Soviet Russia. 
For Campbell, yesterday's lec­ture represented a return to the Notre Dame podium after an interum period of over twenty-five years. Then, as a representative for the Department of State, Campbell came here faced with the "fierce assignment" of having to defend the U.S. foreign policy of aid to Yugoslavia. At the time that he was speaking, the Tito regime was holding a Catholic archbishop (shO later became a Cardinal) imprisoned. 
Campbell started his lecture by making reference to his perspective on the Camp David summit, but said he should' 'refrain from further comment" until possibly the third lecture. 
However, Campbell did term the Camp David summit "A great success for the president and the foreign service officers who also attended." 
"I still have doubts about the summit," related Campbell, "And tht;mgh President Carter has raised his public opinion up a notch, the problems of getting a political settlement still remain." 
"Carter couldn't get rid of this

Back in 1893, the· girls who attended St. Mary's Academy wore simple white uniforms and were forbidden to wear jewelery. A­mong the items they were required to own were three black aprons, three sets of underflannels, 12 pocket handkerchiefs, two pairs of 
. shoes, two pairs of gloves and a 
~ dressing gown. The students in those days had a ten-month scho­lastic year that commenced on the first Monday in September and lasted until the last Wednesday in June. Their curriculum consisted of the basics (math, biology, chem­istry, history, literature and philo­sophy) augmented with such courses as astronomy, geology, bookkeeping and domestic econo­my, with etiquette instruction twice a week. 

tiger by the tail even if he wanted to" continued Campbell, "And if what has now started fails, then we're back in a more difficult situation. The faces may change-­we may not have the present government of Israel and President Sadat to work with." 
The topic of Campbell's first lecture was entitled ''Dulles and Khrushchev,'' and dealt with the first of three periods of recent Mid-East history that ''each ended in a conflict." 
Today, Campbell will speak on the 1960's period that was climaxed by the Jewish Six-Day War of 1967, and tomorrow, he will lecture on the late 1960's and early 1970's period that ''came to a boiling point" with the October War. of 1973. 
Campbell, currently director of studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former region specialist in the State Department from 1942 to 1945, . explained that he will approach the lectures from the perspective of the "personal­ities that shaped the issues," not from the standpoint of "disem­bodied policies." 
The "personalities" on which Campbell spoke yesterday were Eisenhower's Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, described by Campbell as ''a curious combina­tion of Wall Street Lawyer and prominent moralist of the Presby­terian Church," and former Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, termed "a man of humble origins,'' who made his way up the Soviet power ladder by "knowing how to handle himself throughout Stalin's bloody rule. 
Campbell described how the fledgling Republican Administra­tion developed its policy on the Middle East, how Dulles tried to court the emerging nations' favor, and how the Arab States came to a1tgn. therose1ves wtt· h the sovtet · Union, leading to the war over the Suez Canal in 1956.

Groups receive funds 
by Sue Wuetcher Senior Staff Reporter 
Four organizations which were 

not allocated funds at the original 
Student Government Board of 
Commissioners meeting on Oct. 1 
received funds at an Oct. 5 meeting 
of the board. Student Government 
Treasurer Beau Mason said that 
the decision regarding these organ­
izations was delayed so that the 
board could give further stutiy to 
the requests. 
The Class of 1979 was allocated $500. Mason noted that this was the first time that any funds were given to a class, although the Freshman Adivsory Council receiv­ed money last year. 
"Jerry Castellini (Senior Class President) came to us and request­ed money," Mason said, adding, "We felt it would benefit a lot of people." He stated that this allocation would set a precident and expects all class officers to make requests next year. 
Right to Life was allocated $250. Mason remarked that last year Right to Life received $500. "Someone appealed, saying that Right to Life was a political issue. He didn't agree with the cause and objected to his tuition money being 
given to the organization. "We rescinded the funds," Mason said. This year the board decided to 
give Right to Life $250 strictly for 
educational purposes, according to 
Mason. "It's a pretty touchy issue. 
I don't know what's going to happen. If there's an appeal, we will reconsider the decisio.n,'' he noted. 
The board budgeted $200 for the first semester costs of a black student-oriented newspaper. Ac­cording to Mason, "This-is kind of on a test run basis. We want to make sure the organization is performing up to standards." He added that if all goes well more funds will be allocated. 
The fourth organization to re­ceive a delayed allocation was the Elderly Emergency Relief Fund which was given $150 to purchase shovels for use in snow emergen­cies. 
In additon, Ombudsman's ori­ginal allocation was increased by $200 for thepurchaseof a telephone recorder. 
Mason stated that since the meeting there has been one appeal. The Celtic Society received no funds and has appealed the deci­sion. Mason said that a meeting will take place Sunday night to discuss the appeal.

~··· 
i 
CWCAGO [AP] • A leading surgeon says he has developed a treatment that could make human organ transplants much safer by reducing the need for large doses of rejection-fighting drugs. 
Dr. Thomas E. Starzl of Denver said that his treatment calls for the massive drainage of white blood cells and antibodies that fight foreign elements in the body, including transplanted organs. 
In the past, transplant patients frequently have been bombarded with drugs to fight off rejection. 


Such drugs often cause dangerous side effects when given in large doses. Many. persons have not been given organ transplants because the side effects would kill them. 
''The large reservoir of untrans­plantable renal kidney patients which have come to plague every 
major transplant center would become accessible to treatment," said Starzl, chief of surgery at the University of Colorado • Medical Center and .the first person to successfully transplant a liver.

ESTABLISHED 1925 • MEMBER: NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, INC. 
Starzl, who has performed about two-thirds of all the world's liver transplants, said the treatment-­called thoracic duct drainage--also can "greatly enhance" liver, pan­creas, heart and lung transplants. 
He said that the treatment does not eliminate the need for the rejection-fighting drugs, but allows doctors to reduce substantially the amounts given. 
While the white blood cells are being drained, the patient receives injections of other antibodies to protect the body against infection. 
Starzl said in a recent interview that the treatment is ''a very significant step. 
"Don't call it a breakthrough because that gets peoples' hopes to high," he said, "but I think it is very significant.'' 
Starzl said that he first tried the treatment when he ''faced seem­ingly insurmountable ... problems with one of our liver recipients.'' The drugs made the patient vul­nerable to an uncontrollable infec­tion. 
Starzl placed the patient on the 
treatment for 71 days, begin!lmg two months after his transplant, and the patient .fully recovered. The doctor has now used the treatment on· a total of nine liver transplant patients, seven of whom 
are alive wittJ follow-ups of one an one-halfto six and one-half months. 
He said that 20 kidney transplant 
patients also received the treat­
ment and more of the kidneys 
remained functional than would 
have been expected under the old 
method. 


'Check-point' guards ND library 
by John G. McDermott 
A new electronic security system, operating on a radio­frequency principle, was installed "in Notre Dame's Memorial Library 
this past summer. 

Called "check-point," the sys­
tem cost $20,000 but, according to 
George Sereiko, assistant library 
director, "will pay for itself in time 
and money saved." It was in­
stalled to check the rising trend in 
stolen library books at Notre Dame. 
According to an article in the Aue:. 9. 1976 issue of the Chronicle of Higher Education, "stealing and the mutilating of books has become a major problem on most campuses." The article points out that in many universities where the check-point system has been installed, such as Stanford, Stony Brook, Berkeley and Tufts, "the n~mber of books stolen has de­creased substantially.'' 
The latest inventory taken esti­
mated that 4.5 to 5 percent of the 
Notre Dame book collection is 
missing. "With an average book 
costing $15, and with book prices 
going up each year, it adds up to a 
great deal of money," Sereiko said. 
Under the check-point system, library books are electronically tagged. If someone tries to get past the inspection desk with a book that has not been properly checked out, an alarm goes off, and the turnstile locks. 
"I would hope the system will 
make the students more conscious of the fact that books do have to be checked out," Sereiko said. 
If a student is caught with a book that has not been properly checked out, Serieko said that he will usually give the student the benefit of the doubt. "Sometimes students are in a hurry to get to class and I can understand their accidentally packing a book away with their other books," he notP.d. In such a case, the student will be asked to check out the book. 
"But if a student deliberately tries to steal a book, he will be reported to the Dean of Students. 
The  library's  function  is  not  to  
discipline  the  students,"  Sereiko  
said.  

Too many bike thefts-
NO intensifies security 
by Ray McGrath Staff Reporter 

Notre Dame Security is intensify­ing its effort to curb the number of bicycle thefts on campus by stop­ping and questioning people riding off campus on bicylces which are suspected to be stolen. These new tactics have already resulted in the apprehension of one alleged thief, and the recovery of two bicycles over the weekend. 
However, Arthur Pears of Cam­pus Security noted that students will continue to have difficulty protecting and recovering their bicycles until they become more conscientious about registering and locking their bikes. 
The consequences of failing to lock a bicycle on campus are obvious if one considers the num­ber of bicycles stolen during a year. 
DOONESBURY 
"The system is designed to help us more thoroughly detect and control the flow of books leaving 
the library.  It will  improve  the  
services  by  making  more  books  
available  to  the  students,''  he  
added.  

When sufficient funds have been raised, the check-point system will be installed in the other depart­ment libraries. However, Serieko pointed out that no library em­ployee will lose his job because of the new system. 
"Although it is too early to evaluate the system, we are assuming it will work out satisfac­torily based on the reports we have received from other libraries that use the same system," Sereiko stated. 
Pears remarked that many stud­ents do not realize the problems involved in claiming an unregis­tered bike. He pointed out that both Security and regular police forces require that a claiment prove ownership tp recover their bike. He specified that a student must know the serial number of an unregistered bike to claim it. 
Bikes can be registered on campus by students at Room 121 of the Administration Building bet­ween 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. on weekdays. Registration costs only a dollar, and is good for all 4 years a student stays on campus. Free winter storage is also available for students who register theeir bikes . 
Upon registration, the registrat­ion number i_s placed in a nation­wide Computer Guide, which allows a stolen bicycle recovered anywhere in the country to. be returned to its owner .

Evidence of conspiracy 
Yazjian discusses JFK's death 

by Ruth Kolcun Harvey Yazjian, member of the Assassinations Information Bureau (AlB), discussed why President Kennedy was shot and "Who Killed JFK," the title of his two-hour lecture last night in the library auditorium to over 40 people. Yazjian used movies and slides to present evidence of an intricate assassination conspiracy. "We would have had a different 
Vietnam policy if Kennedy had lived," Yazjian said. Kennedy wanted to re-evaluate the Vietnam 
war, according to articles in the National Archives and the New York Times in October and Novem­ber, 1963 issues, he said. 
Kennedy had a working relation­ship with the CIA, according to Yazjian, who said that the gang­land influences-which he equated with anti-Castro advocates-and the CIA, wanted to kill Castro, but Kennedy did not. "In 1963, the CIA and anti-Castro advocates wanted to change foreign and domestic policy. They did not ask you or me. They just did it and then covered it up." Yazjian showed slides that implicated the CIA and anti-Castro advocates in an assass­ination conspiracy. 
Kennedy died Nov. 22. 1963 in Dallas. Yazjian mentioned other anti-Castro conspiracies. He sug­gested that those who want to know more about the conspiracies read "Hoffa Wars," by Dan Moldea in the current issue of Playboy Maga­zine. 
Yazjian questioned why there was not a written or tape-recorded p9lice of Oswald's interrogation. He asked why the WC and the AlB overlooked the 70 witnesses 'who said they saw a shot fired and smelled smoke coming from a "grassy knoll" along the critical route down Elm St. He showed pictures of spectators running towards the grassy knoll after the president was shot. At the same time. police stopped several men in the area who showed secret service badges. There were no secret service in the area, Yazjian pointed out. 
Y azjian showed a picture of one spectator carrying a black umbrella in the grassy knoll. He said that the umbrella was open on that left hand shooter; Oswald was right handed. 
Y azjian showed an enlarged press photo of the crowd and the convertible presidential limousine, in which a man resembling Oswals was standing in the doorway of the Texas School Book Depository at the same moment he was allegedly firing from the sixth floor window. The Warren Commission Report explained that the man was Bill Lovelady, another depository employee who resembled Oswald. Yazjian noted the Commission cannot explain why the man in the doorway and Oswald were wearing identical articles of clothing. 
Yazjian questioned why there was not a written or tape-recorded police report of Oswald's interroga­tion. He asked why the WC and AlB overlooked the 70 witnesses who said they saw and smelled smoke Y azijian asked how Lee Harvey Oswald could have killed JFK when there was no sign of nitrate from firing on his body after a paratin test. He asked why the Warren Commission (WC) and the AlB did not question how Oswald could have used the bolt action rifle when the scope was grossly out of adjustment. He also added it was a sunny, 68 degree day at the time the first shot was fired. Robert Lewis Wit testified at the Senate Hearing that he opened the 

135th anniversary 

umbrella "to protest Kennedy's politics. The umbrella was a sign of appeasement like Prime Minis­ter Neville Chamberlain when he returned from the Munich confe­rence.'' 
WC and AlB did not question any concealed medical evidence. Y azjian asked why Doctor J.J. Humes burned his notes after the partial autopsy of Kennedy at Parkland Hospital? He questioned why Colonel Fink of the Air Force-a surgeon-was told by military brass "not to go any further." Yazjian also charged that Kennedy's brain, which was removed but never 
sectioned off and  analyzed,  was  
later found to be missing.  
Y azjian  aksed  how  could  the  

bullet that pierced Kennedy's back could be undeformed and have not weight loss after enteri.ng Governor Connelly's back, wrist and thigh? Yazjian siad that the bullet myste­riously appeared on a stretcher at the hospital where Kennedy was taken. 
Yazjian posed many questions. He said, "Senate hearings are just the tip of the iceberg. We saw what they wanted us to see and heard what they wanted us to hear. We'll see the final findings. 
His lecture was part of a two day symposium on assassination spon­sored by the Student Union.

A Great Vision of Texas 
Every Friday night fur the last twenty years, the old shit-kickers around San Antonio have pulled out their thirty-beaver Stetson, buffed up those Tony Lama boots, picked up Suzy June, and opened up the road-gills on their Chevy trucks heading out for Floore' s Country Store in helotes. Free dance! Live music! :Wne Star Beer thirty cents a shot! Willie Nelson played Floore's. Jerry; Jeff played Floore's. For four or five hours we're jumping the scene doing the Cotton-eyed Joe, the bunny hop. all kinds of waltzes and two·steps. In the dark under the trees, you can see couples touching the backs of each other's bands! Asign painted on thedancehall wall reads: $100 FINE FOR PUBLIC FlGHTING.

I shudder at the thought of writing about Neil -Young! Anyone familiar· with his work knows what I mean. For ten years now he has maintained the reputation of being as gloomy, mysterious, eruptive and rebellious as any rock artist in the business. He is also widely considered one of the most talented. How do you capture this elusive, many-faceted figure in words? 
I'm not sure. Probably a good place to 
start, perhaps the. only place, is with my 
experience of him. 
About ten years ago, a friend of my sister brought over some album by some guy I had never heard of and, at the time, I didn't want to hear of either. But one of courtesy I sat and listened. The music was from a premier solo album entitled Nell Young. After a few tortuous minutes ·of 

I! • patient listening, I could bear it no longer and burst out laughing. Who are they? Call it pre-adolescent myopia, if you will; but there were good reasons to be inflicted with it. I mean, there were the Beatles, the Birds, Donavan, and countless other greats of the· that era to listen to. Although now Buffalo Springfield is recognized as one of the most innovative and avant-garde groups of the day, back in those days, they were relatively unknown. The members of the band had to wait for their tum in the limelight which didn't really occur until they had split up. Jim Messina and Richie Foray combined their talent to make up the vital farce of early Poco, and later went their separate ways, Messina linking up with Kenny Loggins and Furay with Chris Hillman and J.D. Souther. Stephen Stills teamed up Crosby & Nash to form the eminent Crosby, Stills, & Nash. Young went on his own, played with Crazy Horse for a while, and later joined up with Crosby, Stills and Nash to form on of the most potent musical forces of the late sixties. Such were the beginnings of Young•s career. 


The problem with Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young was that all-stars usually don't stay together long. Sure, there's all the stories about how Young was impossible to work with and how he bashed Stills' teeth in during a rehearsal, how he plagued CSN&Y with difficulties, but for now, let's not listen to all the gossip. Let"s listen to the music. 
The song that turned my attention to Neil Young was ''Only Love Can Break Your Heart" from After The Gold Rush. It was one of his few songs that ever made it to the top-forty charts and into the restaurant juke boxes. His voice was high and sweet, the acoustic guitars and background percussion smooth an softly rhythmic. Adn the words, oh, the words ... 
Only love can break your heart 
Try to be sure right from the start 
Yes, only love can break your heart 
What if your world should fall apart? 
The music, the lyrics, something, grabbed me. It compelled me, as it did many 
one of his weaker efforts. I
others, to run out and get his previous solo releases up to that date, Nell Young, the one I laughed at a year earlier-·oh well, tastes change--and Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere. If that did not attract some eager ears to Young's magic at sound, Woodstock and the release of Deja Vu did it. 
It dQesn't really matter though; what is important is that Neil was rapidly moving to stardom by 1971. "Southern Man," with its rol!gh and rugged guitar sound and its biting criticism of vestigial racism in the South, won rilany restless and indignant hearts. Today, many are still crying out as Young did, "How long, how long?" And the outrage so many felt over the Kent State shootings, Young capsulized in what became a banner song of the sixties movement, "Ohio-". 
Thus, when Harvest came out it was an automatic smash. Featured were "Old man" and "Heart of Gold," two nicely done tunes in which Young conveys with honesty and simplicity his deep yearning to love and be loved. 
Old man take a look at my life, I'm a lot like you. I need someone to love me the whole day through. Oh, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true. 
(from ..Old Man") 
• 

I want to live I want to give I've been a miner for a heart of gold. 
(from ..Heart of Gold") 

Ironically, but not surprisingly, many familiar with Young's work consider the 
don't know what Young thinks about the music. but he has been clear in expressing his feelings about the peak stardom he received with Harvest. Commenting on ''Heart of Gold,' • he said that ''...this song put me in the middle of the road. Travelling there soom became a bore so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there." (Jacket notes from Decade.) 
It was sometime after 1972 that Young entered what he calls "a long, dark period." His release efforts for the · next two years included a movie and sountrack album called Joumey Through the Pll8t and three-L. P. s, Time Fades Away, 
Tonight's the Night and On the Beach.  He  
was quite erratic during those years.  He  
took  a  beating from  the  critics  for  his  

cinematic endeavor, which was hopelessly subjective for almost any audience. 1lme Fades Away was just plain poor, even by his own standards, apparently--nothing from it appears on the retrospective, three record set Decade. But On the Beacb contains some of his finest output. With his back to the wall, Young seemed to generate some of his most poignant lyrics. In "Ambulance Blues," for instance, he lashes back at the critics with incisive and typically bizzare style. 
So all you critics sit alone You're no better than me for what you've 
shown . With your stomach pumps and your hook and ladder dreams, .We could get together for some scenes.

I · guess it must be something of a comment on the American system of education that nine out of ten people, upon discovering that my male progenitor is a grade school principal, will respond with the peculiar mixture of horror and fasci­nation usually reserved for horned toads that bleed from the eyes. Nearly all of them will ask one or both of two questions: 
a) "Did you go to his school?" and b) "What's it like?" l never attended school under my father, which is not to say he didn't have a deep and colorful influence on my educational processes. The answer to the second question is a bit more complicated; to give the general public a clearer picture of what it's really like to be a principal's kid, I'll have to back up some twenty years and begin, as the cliche goes, at the beginning. 
In all honesty, I have to say that I wouldn't be here if it weren't for the profound and mysterious workings of the Detroit Board of Education, which saw fit to bring my parents together in a grade school on the city's east side. My mother taught third grade at one end of the first floor; my father dispensed history and discipline to the junior high at the opposite end of the second floor. When the wind was right, everyone at·Giton Elementary, including my mother, could hear the authoritative ring of my dad's voice as he attempted to instruct his students in some of the finer points of behavior modification. 
This almost stood in the way of my parents' early relationship; my mother wasn't sure that she wanted to raise children with a man who thought that the Board of Eduction was a two-by-four with a handle. When they were married over Easter vacation the following spring, Dad's ability to project his voice had already marked him as a young man of promise. The fact that he could make himself heard at the back of the auditorium was probably as instrumental to his promotion as his degrees in history and education. When Mom and Dad returned from the honey­moon, the junior high gave them a shower in the gym. One of the major challenges of my parents' young married life was trying to figure out what to do with the eighty-six potholders that the sixth grade arts-and­crafts class had given them as wedding presents. 
Some three months later, when the school nurse diagnosed Mom's morning sickness for what it was, my parents were faced with another problem. According to school policy, a teacher was supposed to resign upon the first discovery of imminent parenthood. Mom, whose tolerance for such idiocy is nil times the square of zero, decided to stick it out. When I was born, some three weeks after she had finished up the winter term and resigned, the principal (a fastidious lady whose one desire in life was to see the death penalty instituted for chewing Dubble-Bubble) was the last to know. " 
The earliest memories I have of my parents are somewhat dimmed by the flow oftime, but I do have a few recollections of those days that, for me at least, are a clear indication of the extent to which Mom and Dad had been prepared for parenthood by their classroom experience. Dad used to peer into my crib and declare, "You can say whatever you want, but I know this one's a history major." My bedtime stories were chapters from Grant's Strat­egy at Gettysburg; by the time I was six months old I had battle fatigue. Mom, who has an M.A. in English, countered by 
NEIL YOONG... 

reciting T.S. Eliot as she changed my 
·diapers. As I grew older, and more little humanities majors were added to the family, my mother and father embarked on the task of socializing us. No drill instructor eve~ elicited the prompt, total, and unquestioning obediance that Dad did at seven a.m. of a schoolday morning, clipboard in hand, gym whistle in mouth, rousting us out of bed with the same clarion tones that had helped to propel him to the principal's office. As we went about our morning tasks, Dad was there with our progress charts, grading us on bed-making pajama-hanging, and tooth-brushing. When we were disobedient, mischevious, or otherwise intractable, we were told, "I hope you realize that this will affect your Behavior and Attitudes mark for this quarter." We were the only kids on the block who had to raise their hands to go to the bathroom. Birthday parties, too, were always something of an embarassment; even up to graduation from high school, Dad always made girls and guys line up on opposite sides of the room. Equally exciting were the once-a-month tornado drills, in which we spent half-an-hour huddled under the ping-pong table in the basement with our hands clasped under our heads. When we neared puberty, and it became. necessary to instruct us in the facts of life, my father brought home the Walt Disney growing-up-can-be-fun films. Our discussion periods afterwards were somewhat less than scintillating..."Now, are there any questions?" 
"Yeah, are pimples optional or manda­tory?" 
Sex education was, I suspect, a lot easier for my dad than it is for most parents. He simply brought home a few biology texts, assigned pages 33 through 67 to be read for Monday and questioned us afterwards to discern our reaction. Somehow, I don't think that "Gee, that's really grrroosss" was the expected response. 
Our academic life reflected, to a certain extent, the parental influence. Schoolwork was not any the less burdensome for us; attempts to engage scholastic aid were always met with the same warm response: "What's the matter? Didn't you read the chapter?" From personal experience, my parents had conceived a strong antipathy for kids whose doting elders had been duped into filling in workbooks for them. Once I did get Dad to help me with math; at t~1e end of our three-hour help session, he was more confused than I was. Once I did the rest of the evening trying to puzzle out the intricacies offourth-grade fractions and cursing the "g*d-d*mn*d new math." 
The benifits we kids derived from our early exposure to academia were of a more practical kind. Long before my classmates had caught on, I knew that teachers, like parents, were human beings. That may not seem to be a very profound discovery, but it was a definite advantage in the days when my contemporaries believed that nuns never went to the bathroom. It took until seventh grade for most of them to realize that a teacher had remarkably little say in whether you went to hell or not. I t also took them a painfully long time to learn that throwing spitballs wasn't a mortal sin. Teachers were, and are, as open to manipulation as the next person. I knew, for instance, that when my Dad meted out a five-thousand word essay on "Why I Must Not Talk In Class," he never looked to see more than that the front and back page were covered before committing the penitential masterpiece to the garbage. 
All you really needed were two hastily scribbled pages and a lot of blank filler in between. There were distinctions, though. 
You could get away with things with a lay teacher that you couldn't sneak past a nun. Yep, there was a world of difference between the sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, who did their student teaching in the inner city, and a graduate of Daisy Chain U., whose most challenging courses, according to my father, were ''Shoelace Tying 404'' and ''Psychology of Nosebleeds". An IHM would not only peruse every paragragh of your five-thou­sand word essay, but give it back to you to do over if you'd written only four thousand ,nine hundred and ninety-nine words. 
Substitute teachers were always fair game. Once the more knowledgable among us had found out her alma mater, whether she had her master's or not, and how long she'd been teaching, we were ready to roll. We had one poor lady hornswoggled into believing that recess was from nine to three. Our long-term plan for making it rain in the lunchroom was realized that day. Even the toughest nuns, like Sister Rocka Gibralta, could be handled if you played your cards right: and Sister Rocka was no pussycat. The walls of her classroom were lined with trophies for shotputting, alligator wrestling, weight­lifting, and beer-barrel throwing. Depend­ing on the degree of your offense, you stood either to be drop-kicked for ninety­three yards or to have your spine twisted into a likeness of Jimmy Durante's profile. Getting on her good side required a"little more effort than usual, but it was worth it, the alternatives being what they were.

Tonight's the Night was equally forceful, "one -of my strongest and longest lasting albums," Young says, "concerning my obsession with the ups and downs of the drug culture." It was spooky and fearful and full of despair, but it also received commendation from RoUlng Stone as one of the five best albums of 1975. 
Recent years have witnessed a continu­ation of this qualitative crescendo of Young's work. Two albums of his own have appeared, Zuma and American Stan and Bars, and one with Stephen Stills entitiled Long May You Run. He has been consistently reaching the extremities of his artistic expression, contrasting the harsh and raw sound of his electiric rock and roll ("Cortez the Killer," "Fountainbleau", "Hurricane") with the soft, gentle, more rhythmic style of his acoustic music ("Through My Sails", "Midnight on the Bay", "Will to Love"). It is a contrast he has possessed from the beginning. In ··wm to Love", he indulges in a calculated 
. and brutal confession of his own inadequ­cy, loneliness, fear, and finitude. The metaphoric self-portrayal he uses is that of a salmon swimmingupstream. struggling against life and death perils ("Through nets, by hooks and hungry bears"). Yet amidst these fears and anxieties emerges Young's eerie, whining, moaning r("',olve.

You could easily waste twenty minutes of 
class by getting her started on her last trip 
down the Amazon, where she routed an 
entire tribe of hostile pygmies single­
handedly. By using similar tactics over the 
years, my cohorts and I were often able to 
escape the jaws of compulsory education 
more than once. 
I owe to my parents the fact that I didn't become just another stuffed head on Sister Rocka Gibralta's trophy room wall. I knew the rules before I started the game, unlike the other poor devils in my class. I knew lots of otherwise intelligent, assured individuals who were reduced to gibbering idiots when it came to dealing with Miss McGillicuddy, the assistant principal; who went to pieces on a glance from any of the powers that were. I knew that the only difference between them and us was a few years and a space in the faculty parking lot. 
That's the only thing that distinguishes a principal's kid from any other. The next time you're in class, look around for one. Chances are she or he will be sitting off to one siQ.e, in the sun if possible (glare makes it hard for them to see what you're up to), muttering to her or himself, "Where'd this fool pick up his certificate­in a crap game?"

Circuit Court judge refuses to close abortion clinic 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. [AP] • A St. Joseph Circuit Court judge refused yesterday to issue a temporary restraining order closing the Women's Pavilion Abortion Oiinic in South Bend the state charged was operating illegally without a license. 
However, Judge John W. Montgomery also refused a motion by the clinic to dismiss the state's complaint. 
He said there was neither enough evidence that the state was right to close the clinic nor enough evidence that the state was wrong to dismiss the case. 
A hearing was scheduled for Oct. 19 at which the state will have the chance to convince Montgomery to issue an injunction closing the clinic. 
In denying the restraining order, Montgomery said the state failed to show that the clinic's operation was causing "immediate and irrepar­able injury, loss or damage." 
Registration of Pitt banners required 

All students desiring to display signs on the field at the Pittsburgh will be required to present them for approval before the game. Stu­dents must bring signs to the Student Government offices located on the second floor of LaFortune, between 3:30 and 5 
p.m. Friday or 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. Saturday. 
A special pass will be issued to students with acceptable signs. Specific details on what type of signs will be accepted, and at what gate students will meet to take signs on the field will be given at these times. 
Fireworks display scheduled to light. up Homecoming weekend 
by Leslie Brinkley 

A fireworks display should set off Notre Dame's Homecoming week­end this year if Student Union secures permission to blockade the roads around Stepan Center this Friday evening. In addition to fireworks, Homecoming Week activities include movies, contests, and a dance. 
Student Union also lotteried 150 Homecoming packages which in­cluded tickets to the Neil Young concert, the football game and the Homecoming dance. Packages are no longer available. Due to the lag in sales, Student Union dismantled the 100 extra packages they had acquired and returned the tickets to the ticket offices. 
Joe Guckert, Chairman of the Homecoming committee, expected the $45 packages to sell more slowly than last year's package for the USC lottery which he termed a "mad scramble." 
Following the Pittsburgh pep rally at 7 p.m. Friday, tireworks are tentatively planned to be set off near Stepan Center.. At present, the purchase of the fireworks and the proper insurance have been arranged by the Homecoming Committee of the Student Union. The committee is now hoping for the necessary permission for block­ades on Juniper Road and other nearby streets so that the fireworks may be set off as scheduled. 
Guckert is satisfied with the responses of students to homecom­ing week activities such as the free showings of "My Fair Lady" and the Marx Brothers film on Monday night. Many correct guesses were submitted for another event, the hidden panther contest. 
Concerning the cancellation of the Homecoming King and Queen contest, Guckert commented that "people definitely did over re-act. There are more important issues to 
worry about on this campus, such as students' rights." Guckert added that the king and queen idea was included this year 

on the basis of student sugges­tions. He said that he did not expect such strong reactions against the contest. 
Homecoming mums are being sold in the dining halls until Thursday and will be delivered to rooms with messages attached on Friday afternoon. 
Tickets for "The African Queen," Saturday night's semi­formal Homecoming dance, are also on sale in the dining halls this week and can be purchased at the door. 
Mums are one dollar spiece and dance tickets are selling for six dollars per couple, which include hors d'oeuvres, cheese and punch. A cash bar will be open to those over twenty-one. Guckert said they expect a crowd of 900 people to attend the annual dance in the ACC. 
Trying to plan a variety of activities throughout Homecoming week this year, Guckert concluded that "as long as people enjoy the events, we're happy." 
Attorney General Theodore L. Sendak filed suit Aug. 28 on behalf of the Indiana Hospital Licensing Council, seeking to close the clinic. 
He said the licensing council assumed that the Women's Pavil­lion is an ambulatory outpatient surgical cneter. The council con­tends that the clinic fails to meet licensing requirements for such centers and thus should be closed. 
Montgomery said before th~ clinic is ordered closed, the council must prove it is subject to state licensing law. 
The Women's Pavillion has con­
tended that applying licensing 
requirements to the clinic would be 
unconstitutional under the U.S 
Supreme Court decision preventing 
the state from regulating clinics 
performing abortions during the 
first three months of pre~nancy. 
Sophomore class to award free t-shirt and pass
A free T-shirt and pass to all class functions will be awarded to the sophomore who submits the best usable booth theme sugges­tions by Friday at 4 p.m. to the Student Activities office. Students should include their names and phone numbers with their booth ideas. 
For more information call Joe Lohmuller (6755) or Amy Peczkow­ski (232-7131 ). Students interested in helping with architectural design or construction should contact Gus Hinojosa ( 1047). 
''The room I had was really quite grand, with magnificent tapestries and painting," said Carberry. "The chairs were done in red pinch and gold leaf. I was afraid to sit on them, so I used a fold-up chair. There were also two air condition­ers but I only used one." 
Others were billeted in tiny cubicles of splendid partitioned Renaissance rooms with names like the Room of the Signatures-where papal decrees are signed-the Room of the Mysteries and the Room of the Sibyls, where in 1503 Pope Julius IIimprisonedCesare Borgia, the Italian Renaissance adverturer and son of Pope Alexander VI. 
Carberry said that a loud electric bell, "like you hear in a high school for changing classes." summons the cardinals to the Sistine Chapel at 9:30a.m. and 4:30 p.m. for the voting. It is the only jarring note in a world of sonorous prayers, soft conversation and light footfalls.

Campbell called the Eisenhower Doctrine, the 1958 policy doctrine on intervention into foreign nations, as "the climax" of the United States' lost prestige and standing in the "Mideast. "The Eisenhower Doctrine spoiled any possibility that we would ever recover from what had happened in 1956. · · Campbell concluded his remarks on the Dulles/Khrushchev Era by refering to the "black picture" that had been painted by the end of the crisis. "Everything Dulles had done had turned against him," he said, "and everything that Khrushchev did seemed to go in his favor." "The end result." concluded Campbell, "was that the Soviet Union gained tremendously, while the losers were the British, the French, the U.S. and Israel." Professor George A. Brinkley, acting director of the Institute for International Studies, introduced Campbell and remarked, "We hope that this first series will be so successful and distinguished that the University won't be able to resist in the future." 

Lane lectures on King 
Mark Lane, legal counsel for James Earl Ray, will lecture to­night at 7 p.m. in Washington Hall on the assassination of Martin Luther~.ing, Lane claims that he has am."~ <;ed conclusive evidence showing t:ts client to be innocent and that a conspiracy existed to kill King. 
Lane is the author of six books, including the international best­seller, Rush to Judgement, which dealt with the investigations of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. He is a former member of the New York State Legislature and was Kennedy's New York City cam­paign director in 1960. He has taught law at Catholic University of America and has lectured exten­sively at colleges, law schools and universities. 
Federal Judge Fred Nichol, who presided over the Wounded Knee trial where Lane's investigative work won a dismissal for his Indian clients. called Lane"the best inves· tigator in America today.'' Lane is now director of the Citizens Lorn­mission if Inquiry, a Washington­based group lobbying for full and open Congressional inquiries into the killings of Kennedy and King.

Carter may veto $ 30 billion tax cut 
WASHINGTON [AP] -President Carter said yesterday that he won't hesitate to veto a $30 billion tax cut bill being considered by the Senate; but could accept a compro­mise that comes closer to the $16.3 billion House version. 
Carter told a nationally broadcast news conference that he will meet today at the White House with Sen. Russell Long, D-La. and Rep. AI Ullman, D-Ore., the heads of the tax-writing committees, to try to work out a compromise he can sign. 
"Hopefully, the three of us can agree on an acceptaable package,'' the president said. 

Carter said that he would accept a bill that is fair and progressive and combines "the best elements" of the Senate and House measures. 
On other matters, the president conceded that it is now "unlikely" that · Congress will approve his proposal to create a new federal Department of Education before it adjourns this weekend. 
And he hinted that conclusion of an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty could depend to some extent on the speed with which the Israelis move to end their military government in the occupied West Bank and to 
ND East Gallery presents 'Sculpture from the East' 
"Sculpture from the East" con­tains a selection of Oriental Reli­gious sculpture from the perma­nent collection. It is now on exhibit and will remain in the East Gallery in O'Shaughnessy until November 26th. The pieces are primarily bronzes from India, China, and Japan, representing Eastern artis­tic trends from the fourth and seventeenth centuries. 
One of the finest pieces in the permanent collection, the Dancing Krishna on a Lotus Pedestal, is a sixteenth century bronze from southern India. This figure of the youthful deity reveals the vital spiritual tradition of Hinduism, as well as the preferences of the artist for his own local traditions. 
Another interesting piece on dis­play is the female deity, sculpted from sandstone. She represents the Cambodian Khmer Civilization, and may be dated approximately twelfth or thirteenth century. She is of the Ankor-Wat style. 

The Amida Sculpture is dated early seventeenth century. A large gilt lacquer wooden figure of Amida, of the Fujahara style, sits comtemplatively upon a lotus base. 
. The public is cordially invited to view these treasures and many others. The exhibit may be considered a visual introduction to Oriental Aesthetics. Gallery hours are: weekdays. 10-4:45 p.m.; weekends 1-5 p.m.; Saturdays of home football games lOa.m.-1 
p.m. and 4-Sp.m. . Also Thursday evenings from' 7-9p.m. p.m.
