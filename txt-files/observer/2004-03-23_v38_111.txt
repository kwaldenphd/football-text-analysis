Hehir wins Laetare Medal 
By KATE GALES 
News Writer 

The University of Notre Dame's Laetare Medal was awarded to Father J. Bryan Hehir, president and treasur­er of Catholic 
Charities for t h e Archdiocese of Boston on Sunday. 
"Father Hehir has been exem­plary in min­

istry, schol-Father J. 
arship and Bryan Hehir administra­tion alike," said University President Father Edward Malloy in a press release. "In honoring him and his service, we wish to refresh our vision of and renew our commit­ment to a just and compas­sionate society rooted in the dignity of all people." 
"Father Hehir is a great example of service and dedi­cation to the church and the people of God, especially the poor and people in need," said Father Peter Jarret, counselor to the president. 
The Laetare Medal is the oldest and most prestigious award given to American Catholics. It was established in 1883, with notable past recipients including President John F. Kennedy, novelist Walker Percy and Catholic Worker founder Dorothy Day. 
"We just thought it was time [Hehir] was recognized for his incredible dedication and work," Jarret said on behalf of the selection com­mittee. 
Hehir was ordained in 1966 and was appointed to his cur­rent post of president and treasurer of Catholic Charities last January. Prior

Members discuss constitutional revisions 
By KATIE LAIRD New~ Writer 

Members of the Council of Representatives met Monday to discuss new revisions to the Student Union Constitution that will be voted on next week. 
Possible changes range from the opening of new positions and the setting of a universal meeting procedure in student government that will follow certain guidelines outlined in Robert's Rules. 
A rough draft of the constitu­tion was passed out, and COR members discussed the effec­tiveness of the new changes.

Ah, yes, I think I'm finally getting a sense of what it's like to live in Zahm Hall. 
For the next week, or so I'm told, schoolwork is to be pushed aside in Pasquerilla West and section activities take top priority. 
With the movie Jaws as my section's theme, we stress over SYR dates as we try to figure out how to make limbs hang from the ceiling and whose blood to splatter on the dan­gling swimsuits. 
It's a perfect mix. 

Such is the nature of PW's Queen Week, a tough-as-nails competition (well, not really), combined with enough laughs to keep me going through Easter break. 
Ifyou're lucky enough, you might just get to see throngs of girls sun­bathing in front of the Rock, working out at Rolfs in prom dresses, building human pyramids in the reflection pool, or doing the Macarena with a security guard at Reekers. 
You only wish. 

Sure, these events are a little cheesy and call to mind summer camps of years past-or was that FroshO?­but, I have to admit that I love them all. 
If being handcuffed in the back of an NDSP vehicle or taking a dip in Rolfs pool with all your clothes on doesn't lead to quality bonding, I don't know what will. And there will be pictures as proof lest we ever deny our crazy stints as Purple Weasels. 
Every dorm has their signature events and it's this enthusiasm and dorm spirit that sets Notre Dame apart. 
My friends at state schools often don't know the people who live a floor below them and they couldn't imagine going to dances with the rest of their dorm. 
Sure, we are all a little SYR-ed out after months of these things, but, seri­ously, we should be grateful. We get the chance to dance our hearts out with 50 of our best friends and noth­ing-not DuLac, not boys who are too white to dance and definitely not a desire to break out of our Notre Dame "bubble" -should get in our way. 
So if you happen to see purple faces at Subway or girls in facemasks and curlers at South Dining Hall, relax. 
We'll be "grown up" soon enough and our professional lives may not allow for us to be such goofballs. College is a great time to live it up, both at parties and doing random activities in the middle of the quad early in the afternoon. 
Personally, I couldn't ask for a bet­ter ride.

Wells Fargo CEO Invents fictional band to motivate employees 
ST. PAUL -Most likely you've never heard of a band called Dick K. and the Revolving Loaners. 
It is also doubtful you have seen Center Stage play. 
But if you work for Wells Fargo & Co. in the Midwest, you may have. 
Center Stage is a real band, made up of Wells employees who play at company events. Dick K. and the Revolving Loaners is a fictional group -"led" by Wells Fargo CEO Dick Kovacevich and including out as a hip singer and the other execs in business garb, singing or playing instruments. 

"We wanted something fresh and fun," said region­al president Jon Campbell in Minneapolis, who over­sees the eight-state Midwest region for Wells Fargo. "It's always been part of our values to have fun, but we slip sometimes with all the other things we have to do." 
The timing for something new seemed right since Campbell last year added new employees in North Dakota and South Dakota to his group, he said.

The communications campaign was designed by Wells Fargo to make work fun and to reinforce Wells Fargo's mission to its more than 28,000 employees in eight Midwest states, including Minnesota. 
The yearlong campaign centers on the fictional "Rock the Stagecoach" tour of the fictitious Revolving Loaners. The bank's corpo­rate logo is a stagecoach. A poster for the "tour" fea­tures Kovacevich decked

Welsh Family wins contest 
Dorm with greatest energy reduction awarded cash 
ByJOE TROMBELLO 
Assistant News Editor 
In the dorm energy conserva­tion contest held last month spon­sored by the Students for Environmental Action, Welsh Family Hall reduced their total energy output by 8,310 kilowatt­hours as compared to February 2003. This was enough to secure the dorm first place and a $100 cash prize, according to club co­president Virginia Kelly. 
Kelly said the total amount of energy reduction by all dorms was nearly 42,000 kilowatt-hours, an amount she called "pretty signifi­cant." 
Badin and McGlinn took second and third places respectively. Dorms were judged on the total amount of energy reduced last month as compared to February 2003. Kelly said the club had orig­inally planned to judge the win­ners based on per capita energy consumption, but said that these figures were not provided by the Notre Dame Power Plant. 
Some dorms experienced an increase in energy consumption, a factor that Kelly attributed to a variety of factors. Differences in energy consumption habits of peo­ple who reside in each dorm and dorms that might have increased the number of residents could not be directly assessed by the con­tests. Overall, however, Kelly said that she was very pleased with the student response to the contest. 
"I hope students just learned to be aware of [the energy that they are] using ... and the simple things that are really painless to decrease energy consumption," she said. 
Kelly said she heard through word of mouth that some dorms were making a particular push to notify residents, including provid­ing information about the contest in their stall notes and getting the word out to other residents in their sections. 
Chau Nguyen, the environmen­tal commissioner from Welsh Family Hall, said that she and other residents specifically pushed energy conservation for the con­test. Although she said she contin­uously promoted conservation by making signs to remind residents of ways to reduce their energy use, she said she made a special effort in February. 
"We really emphasized it," Nguyen said. 
Nguyen notified residents of the contest through hall council and also encouraged residents at the meeting to spread the word to other people in their sections. She made signs and even placed index cards on radios in each section's restroom to remind residents to turn off their radios when they were done using them. 
"I feel like there is always some­thing you can do to improve," she said. "The little things will help make a difference." 
Nguyen said dorm residents fre­quently would leave radios, lights and their computers on when not in use. actions that she tried to encourage residents to reduce. Nguyen was surprised, but pleased, that her dorm won the contest. 
''I'm still really surprised and proud," she said. "I just [didn't] think we'd make that big of a dif­ference in one month and con­serve that much energy." 
Nguyen said the money would be put back into the environmen­tal committee and would possibly be used to partially fund the events they have planned for Earth Day. She said that as a freshman, she strove to become active in campus life and believes that serving as her dorm's envi­ronmental commissioner was a good way to get involved. 
"I always wanted to be involved [and] do something in the dorm," she said. "I wanted to be more aware of it [energy conservation] for myself and thought it [being environmental commissioner] was a good way to be more active," she said. 
The club has several events planned for the remainder of the semester, including a panel dis­cussion on the environmental poli­cies of the 2004 presidential can­didates that will probably occur on Earth Day, April 22, as well as a neighborhood clean-up and tree-planting day that will proba­bly occur in late April.

for a successful week's Alcohol 
argument to establish a mandatory, semester long social awareness class that teaches students about racial, cultural and religious diversity. The class would also address other topics. 
"We decided we're going to spend the six weeks [remaining in the semester] to come up with . . . a plan of action so the next group of CLC members will take this on as a priority next year," Lao said. "Our 'pie in the sky' goal is to have a course that is a semester long and [that] each student will have to take." 
Lao also informed members about progress being made on the group's efforts to follow up on concerns regarding the qual­ity of the campus' appearance. 

Lao sent Father \1ark Poorman, vice president of Student Afl'airs, a letter voicing CLC's concerns about campus appearance prior to spring break. Poorman followed up, promising to contact James Lyphout, vice president for 
Awareness Week. the first such event sponsored by student government. The week featured T-shirt and cup give-a-ways and a drunk driv­ing simulator. 
"I would consider it a success considering it [was] the first year," Lao said. "We hope it will be built on for next year." 
Brother Jerome Meyer. Knott Hall rector and CLC member, commented on the feedback he received from the dorms. 
"It had good reaction in the halls," he said.

was whether or not future COR meetings should be closed to the public. 
Emily Chin, the student body vice-president, explained that closed-door meetings are more effective. 
"The dynamic of the group totally changes . . . it's so much more productive," she said. "People are more open." 
Student Union Board presi­dent Charlie Ebersol disagreed. 
"Most of you people are pub­licly elected officials ... [We] are representing a constituen­cy ... they should know," Ebersol said. "Closed doors 
equal deception.  Period.  It's a  
bad, bad idea."  
James  Leito,  sophomore  

class president, agreed with Ebersol, saying, "I am willing to speak my mind whether The Observer is here or not." 
Members also discussed cre­ating a main government Web site with links to Senate, Hall Presidents Council, Office of the President and the Student Union Board. 
A new position entitled the Student Union Web site 
Osco 
continued from page 1 
Osco and the students' insur­ance companies. 
"[The account] was being used beyond the purpose for which it was intended," Creary said. "[It became] too much for us to manage." 
Creary emphasized the fact that students will not be paying more for prescriptions under the new policy, and their insurance companies will still be covering the same costs. The change that will most affect students is the need to bring a personal insur­ance card to Osco when present­ing a written prescription and to settle co-payments directly at the pharmacy when the pre­scription is filled. Students can also pay for their medication when they receive the prescrip­tion and then file independently with their insurance companies. 
The policy toward Osco is thus very similar to the ones the pharmacy has with other drug­stores in the area. 
Administrator would be in charge of updating and main­taining the Web site which would include minutes, events and other activities of various student government meetings. 
The proposed constitution states that the Web site will "facilitate communication and collaboration among student groups" and "effectively publi­cize all student group events and programs to the student body." 
Director of Student Activities Brian Coughlin explained that currently there is the Under the Dome Calendar sponsored by Student Activities. However, it has not been in service for the past couple of weeks due to a corrupted server. 
"Unlike the University calen­dar, with the Under the Dome Calendar, anybody and any­thing can be on it," Coughlin said. 
COR plans to meet twice more this week to discuss sev­eral more revisions to the con­stitution. The meetings will take place Tuesday at 10 p.m. and Thursday at 7 p.m. The final changes will be made in next week's meeting. 
Contact Katie Laird at klaird@nd.edu 
Students' option to fill any pre­scription at the campus pharma­cy during operational hours remains unchanged. In these cases, pharmacy charges can still be put on a student aGcount. but individual students are responsible for filing their own insurance claims. Creary said that these different pharmacy options allow students to choose which plan works best for them. 
"Students are welcome to use any pharmacy off campus," Creary said. "Prescriptions can [also] be picked up [at UHC Pharmacy] 24-7 as long as they are called in ahead of time." 
Creary said that graduate stu­dents may be more affected by these changes than undergradu­ates because older students are more likely to have their own medical insurance rather than coverage under their parents' insurance. 
Creary also said it is unlikely an emergency account like the one with Osco will be estab­lished again.

Iraq 
continued from page I 
more time devoted to reporting ·that news. Cable news stations like CNN, Fox News and MSNBC presented nearly 24-hour cover­age of the conflict and the events leading up to it, and a prolifera­tion of internet news sources offered different perspectives that challenged America's main­
stream media coverage. 
At the same time, Sieber said, 
the public was forced to take the 
initiative and consult multiple 
sources if it wanted to obtain 
truly balanced news. 
"It's very important for every person to pay attention and not just get their news from one source," he said. Coverage In 'real' time 
The media coverage of the Iraq 
War also differed from previous 
conflicts in its ability to provide 
information on events in 'real' 
time, according to Jack Colwell, 
an American Studies professor 
and columnist for the South 
Bend Tribune. 
"People are seeing instantly what is going on and they're reacting instantly as a result," he said. "They're not waiting for several days for dispatches to arrive to the United States." 
In past wars like Vietnam, Sieber said, reports on battles were often presented two or three days after they occurred due to the lengthy filming, edit­ing and transporting process. He added that today the presence of so-called embedded journalists and new technology allows the American public to get up close and personal with the conflict 
. and watch aspects of a war from 
their living rooms never before 
seen. 
"I think it's going to be some­thing that's looked at as a 'must' in the future," Colwell said. 
At the same time, however, Sieber cautioned that instant coverage often provides exces­
sive detail that does not always contribute to the bigger picture. 
"The nice thing about [the older system] was you had two or three eyes or gatekeepers to look at it [and evaluate its impor­tance)," he said. "Now you've got a reporter corresponding from the back of a ... tank in the desert of Iraq. It's riveting; it gives you a perspective of what it's like but what does it really tell you about the overall con­flict?" 
News media making news 
Perhaps most interestingly, coverage of the Iraq War was characterized not only by news of the conflict but also by conflict created by the news media itself. 
Celebrity journalist Rivera drew the ire of the U.S. military early in the war when he motioned for his cameraman to film the ground as he drew a map of Iraq in the sand and out­lined the movements of American troops. The reporter subsequently announced that he would continue his coverage of the war from Kuwait. 
The BBC also came under fire in January after a judicial inquiry criticized its journalistic integrity when it used false infor­mation to accuse the British gov­ernment of "sexing up" knowl­edge of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. When the news reached the public, it led several top editors to resign and forced the organization's board of gov­ernors to publicly apologize to British Prime Minister Tony Blair. 
"It's something you don't expect from ... the BBC," Colwell said. "It's [problematic] when you have one of the most respected news agencies involved in something like this." 
Both he and Sieber, however, agreed that the incident alone would likely not have long term adverse effects on the public's perception of the media. Biased coverage? 
To some critics, however, the event provides further proof of 

the existence of biased media 
coverage of the conflict, though 
the direction of the perceived 
bias depends upon who is asked. 

In an article posted on the Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) organization's Web site, for example, the trade magazine Editor and Publisher accuses The New York Times of downplaying anti-war senti­ments. 
Additionally. a study by the University of Maryland's Center for International and Security Studies concluded that media coverage of the war failed to adequately challenge informa­tion provided by the Bush administration. 
"Too many journalists acted as virtual stenographers for the current administration, in effect validating President Bush's link­age of terrorism, Iraq and weapons of mass destruction," Susan Moeller, director of the study, told Ascribe Newswire. 
At the same time, the Bush administration has leveled its own criticisms against the media, charging that it exces­sively dwells on negative aspects of the campaign while routinely ignoring its positive benefits. 

"[This war has produced1 fewer casualties and less destruction than probably any war in history," Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said in August 2003. "Each setback in Iraq is repeated and repeated and repeated [in the media] as if it were 10 or 20 setbacks." 
Colwell, however, defep.ded the media's overall coverage of the war and said that the presence of complaints from both sides is a good sign. 
"The news media has really called it as they see it," he said. "I think maybe that [the two­sided criticism] is a good sign. If you're going to get complaints, it's nice to get complaints from the two extremes."

Pakistanis uncover terror tunnel 
WANA, Pakistan -Pakistani forces discov­ered a mile-long tunnel leading from a besieged mud fortress to a dry stream bed, and said Monday the secret passage may have allowed top al-Qaida suspects to escape toward the Afghan frontier. 
The revelation came as Pakistani authori­ties began DNA tests to identify foreign ter­rorists killed in the weeklong offensive in South Waziristan, where thousands of troops have been battling hundreds of die-hard mili­tants. 
Forces first found a tunnel connecting the heavily fortified compounds of two tribal eld­ers -Nek Mohammed and Sharif Khan ­who have been leading supporters of some 500-600 foreign terrorists, said Brig. Mahmood Shah, chief of security for the trib­al areas. 
Afghan troops battle warlord 
KABUL, Afghanistan-Shouldering ammu­nition belts and rifles, newly U.S.-trained Afghan soldiers deployed by the hundreds to the western city of Herat on Monday after some of the fiercest factional fighting since the fall of the Taliban killed a Cabinet minis­ter and as many as 100 others. 
Forces loyal to Herat's governor, powerful warlord Ismail Khan, claimed to have retak­en control of Herat by daylight Monday after tank, rocket and gun battles raged following Sunday's killing of Khan's son, Aviation Minister Mirwais Sadiq. 
A militia commander, who admitted responsibility for the killing, was missing Monday, after Khan's forces retook the com­mander's division barracks and captured 150 of his men.

Bush admin defends terror record 
WASHINGTON -The White House is dis­puting assertions by President Bush's former counterterrorism coordinator that the administration failed to recognize the risk of an attack by al-Qaida in the months leading up to Sept. 11. 2001. 
National security deputies worked diligent­ly between March and September 2001 to develop a strategy to attack the terror net­work, one that was completed and ready for Bush's approval a week before the suicide airliner hijackings, the White House said in a statement Sunday. 
Mobster sentenced to six years 
BOSTON -A former lieutenant to fugitive gangster James "Whitey" Bulger who helped authorities unravel his gang's cozy relation­ship with the FBI was sentenced Monday to six years in federal prison, including time served. 
Kevin Weeks, a one-time gravedigger and lookout for Bulger's Winter Hill Gang, has already served nearly five years, meaning he could be released by the end of this year with good behavior. 
Before he was sentenced, Weeks stood to address the court, saying he decided to coop­erate with investigators to give closure to the families of the gang's victims.

Gypsy moths bug state officials 
AUSTIN -State wildlife officials are plan­ning an aerial spraying campaign in south­ern Indiana this summer to combat a gypsy moth infestation that threatens to spread to the Hoosier National Forest. 
The Department of Natural Resources said the tree-eating moths have been detected in northern Scott County, about 50 miles south­east of Bloomington. 
If the pests manage to travel about 50 miles west, they would reach the Hoosier National Forest and could cause a serious problem because the forest has so many trees for the moths to devour, said DNR spokesman Russ Grunden.

Palestinians bury Hamas leader 
Thousands mourn Yassin after airstrike; militants pledge retaliatory attacks 
Associated Press 

GAZA CITY -Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians chanting "Revenge! Revenge!" flooded Gaza's streets Monday to bury Barnas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin, who was assassinated by an Israeli missile. As ordinary Palestinians seethed with anger, militants pledged unprecedented retaliation -including threats against the United States. 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and many world leaders condemned Monday's killing of Yassin, the most prominent Palestinian targeted by Israel in 3 1/2 years of fighting. The Bush adminis­tration said it was "deeply troubled" by the attack and that it had no advance warning.

use of graphic anti-abortion 
imagery to post-abortion coun­
seling. The conference was co­
sponsored by the Student 
Activities Office and the Knights 
of Columbus. 
One of the speakers was Vicki Thorn, the founder of Project Rachel, a Catholic ministry that offers counseling to those affect­ed by abortion, including women who have had abortions. Thorn founded the ministry in Milwaukee in 1984, and it has since spread to more than 110 dioceses across the country. In her remarks, Thorn discussed the psychological and physical problems women often face after abortions. 
Thorn said women who have abortions frequently encounter emotional problems following the procedure, a phenomenon Thorn attributes to the natural bond between a mother and her fetus. 
"By the fifth week, there is an infinite number of messages from the mother to the child through the cells," Thorn said. "The messages begin at concep­tion." 
She said post-abortion women are three times more likely to commit suicide than women who have never been pregnant, and six times more likely than women who have given birth. 
Thorn added that women under the age of 18 who have abortions run a higher-than­normal risk of developing breast cancer. 
Daufenbach said Thorn's remarks brought realism to the pro-life cause. 
"It's important to be cognizant that there are people around us that have been affected by abor­tion," she said. 
Saturday morning, attendees heard an actress by Mark Harrington, founder of the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform. In his remarks, Harrington defended the use of graphic, vio­lent images of aborted fetuses, saying they can help to spark discussion about life issues. 
That evening in South Dining Hall, pro-life advocate Randall Terry spoke to attendees about activism in the anti-abortion movement. Terry is the founder of Operation Rescue, which con­ference literature described as "the largest peaceful civil dis­

obedience movement in 
American history." He also ran 
an unsuccessful campaign for a 
New York Congressional seat in 
1998. 
However, Terry's participation 
at the conference raised contro­
versy, even among Right to life 
officers. Operation Rescue has 
staged sit-ins around abortion 
clinics, preventing would-be 
patients and medical personnel 
from entering. As a result, 
courts have fined Terry and his 
organization; however, he has 
resisted paying, claiming the 
fines are unjust. 
Right to Life vice president 
Lauren Galgano said that Terry's 
invitation was a cause for con­
cern among potential attendees 
from schools other than Notre 
Dame. Attendees came from 
Michigan State University, the 
University of St. Thomas and 
Ball State University. 
"I took a lot of heat from kids 
at other schools," Galgano said. 
"But he feels that he's being 
unjustly persecuted." 
Daufenbach said the week­
end's events were successful. 
"We were all so happy with the way [the conference] turned out," Daufenbach said. "It was great." 
Galgano agreed, saying the conference will lead to stronger pro-life sentiment at Notre Dame. 
"I was really encouraged by the number of students that came to the talks, as well as their enthusiasm," Galgano said. "We have a very strong core group of people who are ready to be leaders." _ 
"The more activities we do, the more people come and show their support for the pro-life movement." 
One of those activities will be held Apr. 22-24 in Washington, D.C., when students from the Right to llie Club will participate in Operation Witness. The event is a large protest meant to counter pro-choice demonstra­tions held that day. Pro-life organizers have received per­mits to assemble on sidewalks along the pro-choice parade routes. 
Galgano said Operation Witness is projected to be a huge event. 
"We're sending about twelve people, and they're shooting for a few hundred thousand," Galgano said.

Pastors rally against gay marriage 
Associated Press 
ATlANTA-From the cradle of the civil rights movement, sev­eral hundred black pastors are voicing their opposition to the gay marriage movement and rhetoric that equates it with the struggle for racial equality. 
The pastors rallied late Monday at an Atlanta-area church where they signed a dec­laration outlining their beliefs on marriage and religion. They are pressing for a state constitution­al ban on gay marriages, which will be considered again by the Georgia House as soon as this week. 
Many black clergy say they are offended by the gay rights move­ment's claim that their struggle is the same as the effort for equal racial rights. 
The declaration, which was to be presented to legislative lead­ers later in the week, said same­sex marriage is not a civil right, and marriage between a man and a woman is necessary for the upbringing of children. 
"This is neither a hate nor a fear issue," the statement said. "People are free in our nation to pursue relationships as they choose. To redefine marriage, however, to suit the preference of those choosing alternative lifestyles is wrong." 
Bishop Donn Thomas of Messiah's World Outreach Ministries said the civil rights movement "was a positive free­dom for African-Americans to experience our capabilities as men and women created in the image of God." 
"The homosexual lobby is seeking a negative freedom root­ed in the sexual revolution, and it's a negative freedom from the restraint of morality," Thomas said. 
The rally is important because the black pastors are taking a stand on such a difficult issue, said Randy Hicks, president of the Georgia Family Council, which helped organize the event. 
"They're making an appropri­ate statement about what mar­riage is and what it is not," Hicks said. "These men and women can certainly be characterized as compassionate and caring, and they are concerned about things like discrimination." 
More than 600 people rallied last month outside the Georgia Capitol, saying a constitutional amendment would violate their civil rights. 
They held signs reading "Marriage is a civil right not a religious rite" and "We say no to marriage segregation." 
"How do they figure that it's not a civil rights issue?" said the Rev. Paul Turner, a gay pastor from Atlanta who helped organ­ize last month's rally. 
"This is just a way for those conservative leadership in the black community to say, 'Look, this isn't a matter of civil rights because we're black and we did­n't have a choice in being black.' And they think gays do, and that's not true," Turner said. 
Same-sex marriage is already illegal in Georgia, but supporters of the ban say the constitution needs to be changed to make sure a judge does not direct Georgia to recognize gay mar­riages performed in other states.

Walgreen profits jump in Q2 
CHICAGO -Another quarter of soaring pre­scription drug sales lifted Walgreen Co. to a 17 percent profit increase in the second quarter -the latest evidence that rapid expansion is paying off for the nation's largest drugstore chain. 
Walgreen's earnings came in slightly below Wall Street's high expectations Tuesday and its stock fell 2 percent. But the Deerfield, IlL­based company continued to report strong pharmacy results in particular, with prescrip­tion sales jumping 19 percent over the previ­ous year's total to account for 60 percent of all sales. 
Carnival merger propels earnings 
MIAMI-Carnival Corp. & PLC, the world's largest cruise company, reported a 60 percent rise in first-quarter earnings Monday because of its marger last year, the addition of several new ships and a strong recovery from the slowdown caused by terrorism and the Iraq war. 
The Miami-based company reported net income of $203 million, or 25 cents a share, in the three months ended Feb. 29, compared to $127 million, or 22 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. That beat the 22 cents a share estimate of Wall Street analysts sur­veyed by Thomson First Call. 
Revenues doubled to $2 billion from $1 bil­lion a year ago, with $749 million in new rev­enues coming because of Carnival's merger with Britain's P&O Princess Cruises PLC, com­pleted last April. 
Home Depot to launch Net registry 
ATLANTA-Home Depot is going the way of retailers like Crate & Barrel and Macy's by offering an online gift registry. Industry observers see it as a way for the Atlanta-based company to enhance its relationship with cus­tomers, even if it isn't a boon for the bottom line. The initiative will be formally launched Tuesday. 
The home improvement chain says it is banking on its research showing that more people are getting married later in life, per­haps for a second time, and already have small appliances, fine china and cutlery.

Snite store goes out of business 
Art museum shop had been plagued by low customer traffic, space pressures 
By MATT BRAMANTI Senior StaffWriter 
The store in the Snite 
Museum of Art has discon­
tinued business after sev­
eral years of lackluster 
results, said Ann Knoll, 
associate director of th~ 
museum. Last week, the 
store held a closing sale, 
discounting inventory up to 
75 percent. 

The store sold art prints, 
books, decorative items 
and gifts. 

Knoll said it was difficult 
to pin the store's failure on 
a single issue. 

"It was several factors 
that came together at the 
right time," Knoll said. 

Those factors include declining sales, which Knoll blamed on a lack of foot traffic to the store.

SPAIN 

Four are charged in Spain bombings 
Associated Press 
MADRID -A Spanish judge charged four more suspects early Tuesday with terrorism and mass killings for alleged roles in a string of railway blasts that killed 202 people. 
The charges against the three Moroccans and one Spaniard followed hours of interrogation and brought to nine the num­ber of people charged in the March 11 terror attack. 
The court action came as out­going Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar defiantly declared that he has no regrets over sup­porting the Iraq war, adding that his successor's plans to likely pull troops from Iraq would weaken the international coalition against terrorism. 
Aznar's party suffered a sur­prise defeat amid charges that he had provoked the bombings by backing the war. 
"I am going with my head held high and proud of the job I have done," he said in an inter­view with the TV station Telecinco. He also accepted some of the blame for his party's loss. 
Judge Juan del Olmo charged Spaniard Jose Emilio Suarez, accused of providing explosives for the attacks, with 190 counts of murder, 1,430 counts of attempted murder, robbery and collaborating or belonging to a terrorist organization. 
Moroccan Abderrahim Zbakh was charged with all those same offenses except robbery. Officials said he left the court­room in tears. 

Mohamed El Hadi Chedadi and Abdelouahid Berrak, also Moroccans, were charged with collaborating with or belonging to a terrorist organization. 
The judge ordered a fifth sus­pect, a Moroccan, released for lack of evidence. 
Besides the nine suspects for­mally charged, four others are being held but haven't been formally accused. 
The charges stop short of a formal indictment, but suggest the court has strong evidence against the suspects. They can remain in jail two years while investigators gather more evi­dence. 
Court officials said the latest suspects were arrested early Monday, three who were picked up in Madrid's Lavapies dis­trict, a multiethnic neighbor­hood where chief suspect Jamal Zougam ran a cell phone shop. 
Suarez, a former miner, admitted helping Moroccans still at large obtain explosives but said he did not know what the dynamite would be used for. All three Moroccans denied involvement in the attacks. 
Chedadi, the brother of a sus­pect jailed in Spain in 2001 on charges of being part of a Spain-based cell that allegedly helped plan the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, denied any involvement in the Madrid attacks and said he learned of them that same morning while watching car­toons at home with his chil­dren, court officials said. 

World population census released 
Fewer births, more AIDS deaths slow growth 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON The world's population growth is slowing because women are having fewer children and more people are dying from AIDS, especially in Africa, according to a Census Bureau report released Monday. 
The report forecasts there will be nearly 9.1 billion peo­ple by 2050, a nearly 50 per­cent increase from the 6.2 billion in 2002. However, the growth rate is slowing signifi­cantly. 
The global population grew 
1.2 percent from 2001 to 2002, or about 74 million people, but growth will slow to 0.42 percent by 2050. That's far below the peak growth of 2. 2 percent between 1963 and 1964. 
The projections are gener­ally in line with separate forecasts from the United Nations and private researchers. The 2050 world projection is slightly lower than the 9. 3 billion forecast in a previous bureau report on the topic in 1998. 
Bureau officials warned that such forecasts are based on two factors that could change: fertility rates in developing countries and the AIDS epidemic. 
Generally, in the United States and Europe, women are having fewer children, while fertility rates remain high in India, parts of Africa and some other developing countries, said Carl Haub, a demographer with the Population Reference Bureau, a private research group. greatest impact in developing

In 2002, the world's women gave birth to an average of 
2.6 children over their life­time. The bureau projections assume that the fertility rate will drop below two children per woman by 2050. 
Meanwhile, AIDS has killed more than 20 million people since the epidemic began two decades ago. 
Twice that many people now live with HIV, the virus that leads to AIDS, and bar­ring major medical break­throughs most of these peo­ple are expected to die within the next 10 years, the bureau said. 
AIDS continues to have its

"Population control efforts make no sense in the face of the AIDS epidemic," Mosher said. 
Still, the bureau report said the trend could reverse if AIDS edu~ation programs are expanded successfully in developing nations, and pointed to positive signs in Thailand, Senegal and Uganda, nations in which the AIDS epidemic appears to have been stemmed. 
The report also predicted the continued increase in the world's older population. In 2002. people 65 and older made up 7 percent of the population, but that age group will comprise nearly 17 percent by 2050.

Gypsies await war reparations 
Associated Press 
MUNTENI -Things quickly got out of hand. Dozens of Gypsies clamored to meet with human rights activists who are helping them win compensation for being forced into slave labor under Romania's Nazi-allied regime during World War II. 
Windows broke and heated words were shouted before the crowd realized a mistake had been made: The visitors in town were journalists, not lawyers come to document their claims for compensation. 
That a rumor could nearly touch otT a riot underscores the tensions simmering in Gypsy communities across Romania as people wait for money -or at least some news on whether they qualify. 
The program, paid for by the German government and private industry, is the first to compen­sate Gypsies, or Roma as they also are known, for their suffer­ing in the Holocaust. Payments are only now starting to arrive. 
Those waiting -like Diamanta Stanescu, 77. who lives in the nearby village of Liesti, 140 miles northeast of the capital, Bucharest -fear they may remain forgotten. 

Sitting with 15 other members of her clan in a room in the gloom of a single light bulb pow­ered by a car battery, she wept at the memory of a youth lost in wartime concentration camps. Her father, a brother and a sister were killed -shot by German soldiers near a river in Ukraine. 
"We left as beautiful as roses and we came back naked, starv­ing, and full of mud," she said. 
Stanescu was among the 25,000 Gypsies deported by the Nazi-allied Romanian authorities to what was then the German­occupied part of the Soviet Union. Tens of thousands of Romanian Jews were also sent to the camps. 
Most of the deportees died, mainly from hunger and typhus, but executions and other brutali­ties also took a heavy toll. 
The Gypsies were used as slaves by the Nazis and their allies, forced to work on farms, fix roads, dig trenches and fell trees behind the front lines. 
About 5,900 Romanian Gypsies applied for compensation, says the International Organization for Migration, which handled appli­cations for non-Jewish victims in most European countries.

Chasing Harvard 
When I chose to come to Notre Dame, two main attributes influenced my thinking: its Catholic foundation and its prestige. 
In my Jesuit educated, black CathoHc 18-year-old mind I figured this Kamaria Porter University would be an adequate fit for my intellectual Breaking the curiosity and social 
Habit 
concern. These past two years have marginally refuted those hopes, yet I held onto the future benefits, the excellent education and good reputation Notre Dame stood to deliver. Yet, even that vision is not a definite possibility. 
I am not one of the wealthy students. The contribution of generous benefac­tors and substantial sacrifices by my family allows me to attend this school. Mounting tuition makes me apprehen­sive about my ability to complete my study here comfortably without heaping amounts of debt or disadvantage to my loved ones. 
Tuition of prestigious universities climbs higher each year across the board. Yet, my disgust at the 6.9 per­cent tuition hike here stems from the revelation of a better and more just way for low income students like myself to access acclaimed college programs: the Harvard way. 
Last month, Harvard announced a new financial aid and admissions initia­tive to ease the burden of low-income students, increase economic class diver­sity and improve its local community relations. Harvard students from incomes under $40,000 will pay nothing towards tuition and others with incomes falling between $40,000 and $60,000 will receive a substantial increase in financial aid. 
Admissions department will vigorous­ly recruit excelling low income students who would normally never consider Harvard based on tuition. 
Lastly, to revitalize their position in the Boston community, Harvard will institute the Crimson Summer Academy for outstanding high school students from low-income families. The program will offer these students academic sup­port, mentoring and encouragement to make college a reachable and useful goal. Not only is this delightful program free, but Harvard also will pay for the student's transportation costs, medical insurance and meals, provide a stipend to cover forgone summer wages and reward completion with a $3,000 schol­arship to any university. 

Through this decision, Harvard is rec­ognizing class as an important aspect of a student's academic persona and breaking down barriers for a pool of eager and widely neglected students. 
In many discussions with profession­als here, I have gotten the sense Notre Dame harbors some Harvard envy. Who could blame it for striving to be the best? Yet, as a Catholic institution, Notre Dame ought to fill its own authen­tic niche, which I feel is currently lack­ing in many parts. 
Christianity in general, and Catholicism in particular, has rich work­ing and lower class origins. The New Testament, the foundation of our faith, depicts a new world order and the process by which we can achieve it. The Gospels call Christians to be bearers of goodwill, advocates for peace and pro­moters for economic justice. The revolu­tionary message of Jesus attracted fol­lowers from the underside of society ­women and the poor flocked to this ide­ology based on the dignity and beauty of all humanity -not on property and wealth holdings. 
Catholicism all over the world reaches out to the poor and oppressed, and not only with spiritual relief. People of faith immerse themselves in struggling com­munities, becoming one with the poor and working alongside them to bring about changes in power structures, evi­dent in the extraordinary lives of Archbishop Oscar Romero and Dorothy Day, two of the greatest example of the Catholic existence. 
When administrators resist pleas for certain programs by asserting the need to maintain the Catholic nature of this institution, I say it is rhetorical non­sense. A school with a sizeable business school, ROTC program, un-unionized workers and a wealthy apathetic stu­dent body seems pretty secular to me. 
I say, put your policies where your mouth is and make this University a beacon for Catholic Social Teaching and the Christian mission in the world. which ought to be highlighting instances of injustice. campaigning against war, eradicating poverty and cooperating with organizing drives for worker's rights. Things like the Preferential Option for the Poor, radicalism and Conscientious Objection say Catholicism to me, but certainly not to Notre Dame. 
I call the University to adopt a finan­cial aid program like Harvard's, to give lower income scholars a chance to study here. Economic downturns may shake our $3 billion-plus endowment and merit tuition hikes, but I call you to think of what a faltering and unfair economy does to low income families with zero assets. There is no compari­son with the level of damage experi­enced. 
Without help, an entire class of Americans is denied access to schools like Notre Dame. To allow this to hap­pen is an atrocious sin and a rejection of our Christian calL So, let's chase Harvard on this one because leveling the field, easing the burden on the poor and promoting justice is such a Catholic thing to do.

The views expressed in this column are those ofthe author and not neces­sarily those ofThe Observer. 
I would like to thank all who participated in "Gay, fine by me" and attended the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender (GLBT} Issues forum last week. As a student leader from a peer institution, I was delighted to be a part of such a great series of events. I believe that both "the shirt" cam­paign and the forum represent something that many at your University are willing to begin talking about. This truly is a wonderful starting point that will allow the University to first serve those who need i.t most. 
I would like to quickly address a correction to a misprint in The Observer as well. I truly appreciate the support and converge that the staff has given to the past week's events, but I would also like to correct a quote that was printed. In the article regarding the forum, it states that I said that "justice comes from recognition." I stated, which was also the theme of my address, that "acceptance comes from recognition" Again it is a small misprint and I still believe that the entire staff of The Observer did a wonderful job in covering the event. 
I would also like to congratulate Joe Dickmann, mem­hers of the panel and the GLBT/Allied community for their commitment, hard work and love that was put into these events. All who participated have truly strived to make the spirit of inclusion a reality when others have lost sight of its goal. I believe that open discussion events like the forum will help make your university a meeting place where all can feel welcomed. 

As I stated in my address, acceptance is found in recog­nition. As members of the Catholic community all should look to the teachings of Christ and tradition of the Catholic Church as the foundation. From this support and love of all, especially to the least of those among us, acceptance can become a reality. Only through you, as members of the student body, can true inclusion be realized. Thank you again for your warmth, compassion and hospitality.

Perusing Parisian culture 
Well, it's been a long time since I've last written. Right now, we are enjoy­ing our Easter vacation: six weeks of relaxation from tutorials {yes, six; I'm somewhat embarrassed myself). But this long break affords us interna­

Oxford 
muds as myselO 
and I wanted to 
tell you about my adventures in Paris. 
Now, a few weeks ago my parents decided to make the trip here to England to visit Oxford, London and then Paris, and so I accompanied them to France. 

The first real snag hit when we tried to enter the Metro, the French rail sys­tem. I will admit that one of us was pick-pocketed, but in order to protect the innocent (or in this case, perhaps not-so) I won't mention any names. The sting was actually pretty clever. What happened was that, as one of us was passing through the turnstile, a man came from behind and stopped the turnstile from fully turning over. Then, once it had clicked into place, and the person was struggling to move it forward, the criminal reached into his/her pocket, took the wallet and took off the other way, leaving the per­son caught in the turnstile. C'est la vie, eh? 
Well, other parts of Paris were a lit­tle more friendly. Notre Dame Cathedral lived up to its reputation Notre Dame sweatshirt, and I fully expected meeting a few Darners there; thankfully I was not disappointed. 

We also visited St. Chapelle, a glori­ous little Gothic church 
each depicting a different book of the Bible. 
We then visited the Louvre, which houses such treasures as the Venus de Milo and the Mona Lisa. Thankfully we visited on a Wednesday evening, when the lines were short: a suggestion for all of you future travelers is to visit the touristy stuff on weekdays. Oh, and 
Mona's "enigmatic smile?" Well, her 
smile really is unique: Leonardo pur­
posefully painted it to appear vague 
and hazy, and the longer you stare at 
it the more possible emotions can be 
read from her face. 
Who could forget the Eiffel Tower? The Eiffel Tower is to Paris what the Dome is to Notre Dame: they both are so unforgettable, so grand that they define their relative areas. You can see the Eiffel Tower from anywhere in the city: during the day it stands as a sym­bol of progress and industry, and at night, when its huge lighthouse beam sweeps the sky over the city, it serves as a beacon beckoning people to the home of so much art and culture. 
And the food: France is famous for her desserts, and she did not disap­point. The chocolate and Nutella crepes, the soft ice-creams, the pas­tries for breakfast were all so rich, so fresh, uggh ... and now it's back to British food. 
I hope you all enjoyed your trip to Paris; I know I enjoyed reliving the sights and smells. Now where can I get a Nutella crepe around here? 
Geoff Johnston is enjoying his break by traveling and reading. He hopes that the seniors are able to enjoy every minute of their last semester under the Dome. Go Irish! Contact Geoff Johnston at gjohnsto@nd.edu.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Shirts advocate respect, love for homosexuals 
Espousing ascientific defense 
In response to Gus Zuehlke's March 22 the­ological argument against the "social promo­tion of the homosexual lifestyle," which is "counterproductive to the true interest of homosexuals," and "results in monstrous" human behavior, I provide a simple scientific response (although I am aware that theologi­cal arguments are strictly irrefutable): there is overwhelming experimental data that social pressure and coercion cannot alter the sexual orientation of a homosexual. Homosexuality is not a disease that can be cured either by Mr. Zuehlke's preaching or by any other medicine or physician. 
In fact, as Chandler Burr states in his book "A Separate Creation: The Search for the Biological Origins of Sexual Orientation," homosexuality is no more a disease than human handedness. Inferences about the genetic origin of both of these behavioral traits have always resulted from empirical observations, because neither the gene for human handedness nor the gene for homo­sexuality has been discovered. 
Burr provides evidence, showing that there is a striking similarity between the trait of human handedness and homosexuality: both have a majority and minority orientation (right-and left-handed, and hetero-and homosexual people, respectively); the minori­ty orientation is much higher in males than in females for both traits (there are 100 percent more homosexual men than there are les­bians); age of first behavioral appearance of both traits is two years; there is an elevated rate of minority orientation in families with other ·minority-oriented members; the minor­ity orientation seems to be maternally inher­ited, implying aX-chromosome linkage. 
But the most striking statistically deter­mined fact suggesting the genetic determina­tion of homosexuality consists in the follow­
ing: if one of two monozygotic (identical) 
twins is homosexual, his or her sibling has a 
50 percent chance of being homosexual as 
well (12 percent in the case of human hand­
edness, meaning that there is more indirect 
proof that homosexuality is genetically deter­
mined than human handedness is). And yet, 
we intuitively agree that human handedness 
is a genetic product, while strongly oppose 
and refuse to admit the notion that homosex­
uality is simply a genetic variation. 
One can argue that homosexuality is a dis­
ease in a Darwinian sense, since homosexu­als cannot actively reproduce and have off­spring. However, since our society does not ·sanction biologically sterile individuals, why 
would it have to sanction gays? 
Ongoing studies and research on the heated topic of homosexuality, such as Burr's, incline me to disagree with St. Paul's centuries-old description of homosexuality as a punishment from God. It is not a disease, it does not inhibit a person from working or performing any other social function, it does not make people commit more crimes or other illicit acts. And finally, it is not chosen, much in the same way that human handedness is not cho­sen. So why, then, call it "monstrous" and why not accept a homosexual lifestyle? 
It is high time that we stop basing our arguments solely on theological constructs (which in this case engender nothing but unfounded discrimination), and cease ignor­ing the current scientific developments, which scream at our faces: "We are all human, and we are different. Learn to live with it." 
Hristo Hristov JUnior Stanford Hall March 22 

Christians are called to 
love, not condemn 
In response to Gus Zuehlke's March 22 letter, "Wearing of Shirts is Sinful," in which he quoted St. Paul to the Romans, I would like to respond with several other quotations from the Bible. 
From 1 Corinthians 13, arguably the greatest chapter on Christian love in the Bible, "If I speak in human and angelic tongues but do not have love, I am a resounding gong or clash­ing symbol. And if I have the gift of prophecy and comprehend all mysteries and all knowledge; if I have all faith so as to move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing ... So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love." 
Mr. Zuehlke, I wore that shirt on March 18. I have friends as well as family members who are homosexual, and I have never stopped loving them, despite the fact that I understand the Bible says they are living a life of sin. 
Before disparaging them, however, I fulfill my Christian duty to love them as myself, to treat them equally and to respect their choices, whether or not I agree with them. As Christians, we are taught to love others above all else, and I believe that's what many of the students and faculty were demonstrating with their shirts. On a campus of 85 percent Catholic back­ground, and undoubtedly much higher Christian percentages, 1,600 people in shirts can't be a mistake, a fluke or an inten­tional uprising against the \Vord of the Lord. 
It is our duty as Christians to love one another in the same way that Jesus loved the adulteress in John 8, when he addressed her tormentors saying, "Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her." 
When he was left alone with the woman, he asked her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?"The woman replied in the negative, and Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you." 
Mr. Zuehlke, are you without sin? Because I think that every­one in the shirts realized that they weren't.

Quentin Tarantino's breakthrough movie asserts the fast-paced and violent style that would become his trademark, complete with snappy dialogue and erratic storylines that all eventually converge in the last moments of the film. The film follows the exploits of a group of criminals put together to pull off the per­fect crime. None of them know who the others are, as they are known only by monikers like "Mr. Pink," "Mr. White" and "Mr. Blonde." But when their caper goes awry, they realize that they have a police informant among their ranks. The most famous and most disturbing part of the film is the

"indie" films having debuted at Robert Redford's Sundance Film Festival. It truly shows that a good movie doesn't need to cost a lot.

Now a major star of cinema and the tabloids, Irish actor Colin Ferrell got his start playing a young soldier from Texas in director Joel Schumacher's Tigerland. Ferrell plays Roland Bozz -a soldier in constant battles with his commanding officers. His refusal to follow orders and his tendency to overtly help his fellow trainees escape using his knowledge of the military system gets him into trouble. The other soldiers soon turn against Bozz because the consequences of his actions fall on them as well. When his unit is sent to Tigerland, a camp in Louisiana that closely resembles Vietnam War scenes, he is forced to assume a new mantle of leadership. 
The movie deftly combines concerns about the war with the ethos of the military, and this movie proves that Ferrell has what it takes to be a star. He completely car­ries the movie, and he portrays ·

Even if you have never seen Casablanca, it is more than likely you have heard of it, or at the very least have seen it quoted or parodied at some point in your life. It has become more than just a movie -it has become a classic, and a part of our collective conscious as a society. The film follows Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), a cyn­ical American ex-patriot who owns a bar in pre-World War II Morocco. The bar has become a haven for people fleeing the nefarious forces collecting in Europe. He is a man, who in his words "sticks his neck out for nobody." 
But his continence changes when the woman who broke his heart, lisa (Ingrid Bergman) arrives in Casablanca. 


Casablanca 

Director: Michael Curtiz Year : 194 2 
She has come with her new love, Victor Lazlo (Paul Henreid), who is a Czech resistance leader fleeing his pursuers. In the midst of a difficult love triangle, Rick must choose between hjs own desires and the lives of others who depend on his decisions. 
The film captures an atmosphere of desperation and isola­tion that marks the people who live in Casablanca, and reveals that in the scope of war"... the problems of three people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world." The movie has everything going for it including great dia­logue, a great story, fantastic cinematography, elegant cos­tumes and perfectly cast actors. The special edition also has original trailers. It also includes a documentary about the movie's origins and information on the film's far-reaching effects on other movies. Casablanca achieves a kind of cine­matic perfection that films rarely achieve. Age does nothing to diminish enjoying the story or the impact it will make.

Hollywood loves to make mob movies, but it is rare when one distinguishes itself from the pack and strives to be more than a mere Godfather rip-off. Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas earns its own merit by taking the often mythologized world of the mafia and putting it in the harsh perspective of reality. The film follows Henry Hill {Ray Liotta) through three decades 
of life in the mafia, revealing the effects of the lifestyle on himself, his fellow mobsters and his family. Hill rides the peaks and valleys of mob life, living from one job to the next, all of which ultimately takes a huge toll on himself and those around him. Hill must ultimately turn to being an FBI informant to avoid prison or the victim of a mob hit, and living a normal life proves to be the hardest challenge of all. 
The portrait Scorsese paints is not a flattering or particularly glam­orous one. He shows the tenuous nature of' the business and lifestyles that the men leave, as well as how it can devastate families and friends. The movie is full of great performances from Liotta, Robert De Niro {as Jimmy "The Gent" Conway), Joe Pesci (as the homicidal Tommy DeVito, which won him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar) and Lorraine Bracco (as Hill's long suffering wife, Karen). Scorsese vividly presents the violent and desperate lives the men lead in the mafia. hut also the sense of family and power that attracts them to the lifestyle. It is a long film that 


requires patience and commitment to watch, but it is deeply moving and interesting, as well as an example of great direction. Goodfellas

Chocolat attempts to throw a new light on the season of Lent by showing the need to balance self-denial with a spirit of joy. This film will be somewhat painful for anyone who may have given chocolate up for Lent, but it does provide an optimistic view of the 
season. 

The film follows Vianne (Juliette Binoche), a free-spirited wanderer who opens a chocolate shop in a secluded French village 
during Lent. The town turns its back on the non-conforming woman, but her open and accepting mind helps some of those suffer­ing under the fac;ade of perfection and con­formity that the town constructs. Judi Dench plays an older woman estranged from her daughter who finds comfort in chocolate and secret meetings with her grandson. Lena Olin plays a married woman who finds the courage to leave her oafish husband and venture out on her own. Included in the supporting cast are Alfred Molina, Carrie Anne Moss and Johnny Depp. 


The townspeople learn to be more accepting and less rigid from Vianne's unique ways, and she, after a lifetime of wandering, finally joins a community and finds love. The film lags in parts, and is occasionally a little heavy-handed with the allegorical elements of the story, but it is nonetheless a charming and funny story. 
Saving Silverman is one of those movies that is so unabashedly dumb and silly that you just have to laugh in spite of yourself. It follows the exploits of three best friends, Darren Silverman (Jason Biggs), Wayne Lefessier (Steve Zahn) and J.D. McNugent (Jack Black), who have known each other since childhood and perform together in a Neil Diamond cover band. Their friendship is torn apart when Silverman starts dating the catty and controlling Judith {Amanda Peet). Silverman's two friends concoct a plan to kidnap Judith so that they can set their friend up with a past love of his from high school who is about to become a nun. 
Centering a comedy around a kidnapping, which is a tragic and dangerous undertaking, makes it hard to suspend belief enough to laugh at some of the jokes. The movie adds a few scenes and storylines that really aren't necessary. A more streamlined story would have helped the movie out. The actors in the film really deserve a better film, because all of the actors, particularly Peet and Black, are skilled in comedy. The film definitely has some funny moments. The cast works surprisingly· well together, but the movie as a whole is kind of a stretch. 
Saving Silverman is OK, but it could have been better. There are certainly a lot better Saving Silvermanrtesyofwww.anmoviephoto.comdumb comedies out there.

HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS 
'Hoosiers' game is now 50 years old 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Indiana 
high school basketball traded 
tradition for trophies in 1998 
when it scrapped the tourna­
ment format that produced the 
most famous shot in Hoosier 
hoops history. 
Now, 50 years after Bobby Plump's last-second basket lift­ed tiny Milan over big-school Muncie Central, the tournament is split into four separate class­es. There's almost no chance the state ever will go back to the open-class tourney. 
"They put the emphasis on getting a trophy, and now you're a champion. But you're a champion of what?" Plump said. 
"I don't want to take anything away from the student-athlete. It's still great if you're a cham­pion of 90-some schools. But you're not the champion of the whole state." 
When the 380-plus-member Indiana High School Athletic Association changed the tour­ney format, more than 80 years of tradition was abandoned in favor of separate playoffs, based on school size, to placate the state's smaller schools. That produced more champions, but it all but assured there will never be another Milan Miracle, a David-and-Goliath triumph for the heavy underdog. 
Plump and other traditional­ists are still aghast. 
"I haven't given up on trying to change it back, but I have no authority to change it," said Plump, whose high school team was the inspiration for the 1986 movie "Hoosiers." 
"The IHSAA holds all the cards.... They own the basket­ball, they own the goal, and they make the rules," he said. "How can anybody penetrate that? It's unfortunate they can't see what it has done to the stu­dent-athletes." 
Plump, the 1954 Indiana Mr. Basketball, formed a group of single-class supporters in an unsuccessful attempt to sway the IHSAA vote leading up to the format change. 
He and other opponents of the switch from a single playoff to four separate classes argued that the divisional format robbed the athletes of the chance to compete against the

state's best and watered down a 
tournament known throughout 
the country. 
In 1990, before the restruc­
turing, more than 40,000 peo­
ple watched Damon Bailey's 
Bedford North Lawrence team 
win the championship in the 
RCA Dome -a national record 
for a high school game. 
Attendance and revenues have 
plummeted since the change to 
separate classes. 
Total boys attendance at all 
four rounds of the tournament 
dropped from 786,024 in 1997, 
the final year for the single 
tournament, to 440,914 last 
year, a drop of 44 percent. 
Profit to the IHSAA plunged 51 
percent, from $924,016 to 
$448,405, over the same span. 
Girls attendance and profit, 
much smaller than the boys to 
begin with, dropped 23 percent 
and 36 percent, respectively. 
"I just loved it when we had a 
one-class tournament and there 
was a possibility of a Milan, but 
that is just not even realistic in 
this day and age," said Priscilla 
Dillow, former athletic director 
at Indianapolis Ben Davis. one 
of the state's largest schools. 
"Yes, you might have one every 
50 years, but the bigger schools 
have so many more extras." 
Dillow was on the IHSAA 
board of directors and sided 
with the majority in the 12-5 
vote for separate classes eight 
years ago. With Milan's 50-year 
anniversary and a recent regu­
lar-season rematch against 
Muncie Central, the subject of 
class basketball has again been 
widely discussed. 
Dillow said she would vote the 
same way now. 
"When I voted, I was repre­senting my district, and we did a district polling to see how the principals felt. And in my dis­trict it was 60-40," she said. "I think you'd still find just about the same split. Now, so many teams have experienced suc­cess, I can't imagine them going back." 
Merrillville athletic director Janis Qualizza, the only current board member who voted against separate classes, also said she would vote the same way. 
"I had good reasoning back then, and my reason's the same," she said. "We had the best state tournament in the country, and I couldn't see any reason why we shouldn't con­tinue that tournament." 
That's what Plump felt in 1995, as the push toward sepa­rate classes gained momentum. He formed a group called Friends of Hoosier Hysteria, which enlisted such basketball icons as John Wooden, Oscar Robertson and Bob Leonard to lobby on behalf of the tradition­al tourney format. 
Acting on a study committee recommendation, the IHSAA board approved the plan in April 1996, splitting more than 380 schools into four separate classes based on enrollment. In 1999, after two years under the new system and several failed attempts in the state Legislature to force at least a public referendum, the IHSAA board voted again to keep the separate classes. 
That's the last time the IHSAA has considered it.

Despite dropping their last two matches at the Blue/Gray National Classic, the Irish may be playing their best tennis of the season. Ranked at No. 35 with a 10-7 record, Notre Dame boasts three solid doubles teams. Senior tri-captain Luis Haddock is ranked No. 14 when playing with freshman Ryan Keckley and No. 29 when play­ing with senior tri-captain Matthew Scott. Keckley is also ranked No. 44 when paired with junior tri-captain Brent D'Amico.

The rest between today's match and the two tournaments the Irish played in early March plays to Notre Dame's favor. The Irish were forced into a difficult situation earlier in the season, as top players succumbed to injury and were exhausted by a tight schedule. 
Michigan (8-1) is coming off a 6-1 win over Ball State on March 
13. Nationally, Michael Rubin is ranked No. 46 in singles play for the Wolverines, and freshman Ryan Heller has posted an unde­feated record playing at No. 3 and 4 in the dual-match season. 
The Wolverines lead the all­time series with the Irish 40-23, although the Irish posted a 5-2 victory in last year's meeting. 
The match will be at 4 p.m. at the Varsity Tennis Center in Ann Arbor, Mich.

Belles drop four games over the past weekend 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN 
Sporrs Writer 
Dropping back-to-hack double­headers wasn't exactly what the Belles had in mind coming off their 5-4 spring break trip to Florida. 
But that is exactly what they got over the weekend, losing a pair each to Rose-Hulman on Saturday and Saint Mary's of the Woods on Sunday. 
"We don't want to play catch up anymore. Once we begin to start playing aggressively from inning one, then we will be a much more successful team," coach Anna Welsh said. 
Traveling to Rose-Hulman after a Friday cancellation against Goshen, the Belles lost 4-1 in their first game and 4-3, in eight innings, in the second. Kate Sajewich lost the first game, giv­ing up nine hits and striking out four. 
In the second game of the dou­ble header, Libby Wihelmy gave up nine hits and struck out four. Katrina Tebbe went 3-for-3 with an RBI and a run scored. 
On Sunday, Saint Mary's was defeated by Saint Mary's of the Woods 6-5 in the early game and 5-3 in the second game. Bridget Grall gave up six hits and walked none in the loss. Grall also went 2-for-4 at the plate, driving in two runs. 

In the Belles' fmal game of the weekend, Sajewich pitched again, giving up seven hits in five innings. Laura Heline doubled for the Belles and drove in two runs. Erin Sullivan went 2-for-3. 
Welsh attributed the losses to the team's failure to get anything going until late in the game. 
"We had good comebacks over the weekend, however we waited until the later innings of the games to start hitting and playing defense," Welsh said. "In order to reach our goals on the season we are going to make adjustments to help us get prepared to have a better start in the frrst inning." 
The Belles were supposed to play Goshen on Thursday, but inclement weather postponed the game until Friday. Goshen then cancelled Friday due to a lack of players because of a team illness. 
Saint Mary's has one more tune-up game before league play begins on Saturday against Alma. The Belles travel to Purdue­North Central for a Wednesday afternoon contest.

Associated Press 
DENVER -John Lynch is a Denver Bronco. 
The five-time Pro Bowl safety agreed to terms with the Broncos Monday as Denver continued to revamp its defense, also signing defensive end Raylee Johnson and agreeing to terms with defensive tackle Luther Elliss. 
Lynch played his entire 11-year career with Tampa Bay, but the Buccaneers released him last week. The five-time Pro Bowler was a key part of Tampa Bay's Super Bowl team two years ago, but was scheduled to make $4.2 million next season. 
Lynch, 3 2, can play either safety position, although he has played primarily free safety throughout his career. 
Johnson, who spent his first 11 seasons in San Diego, signed a three-year, $3.3 million contract that includes a $1 million sign­ing bonus. The 33-year­old is expected to split time with Reggie Hayward at right end, helping com­pensate for the loss of Bertrand Berry, who signed with Arizona. 
The Chargers released Johnson earlier this month to save salary-cap space, but tried to re-sign him. He also visited Baltimore. 
The Broncos have added Pro Bowl cornerback Champ Bailey in a trade with Washington, signed defensive end Marco Coleman and re-signed middle linebacker AI Wilson. 
Elliss spent his first nine seasons with Detroit and was a Pro Bowler in 1999 and 2000, but was released by the Lions on March 2 in a cost-cutting move. 
Lynch struggled with neck problems last season with the Buccaneers and had surgery to remove bone spurs in January. He chose Denver over the New York Jets, coached by close friend Herman Edwards. 
Johnson has 26 1/2 sacks the past three sea­sons, but missed the final seven games last year with a foot injury.

Saint Mary's sweeps Adrian 9-0 in MIAA contest Saturday 
By RYAN DUFFY 
SportS Writer 
Senior Jeannie Knish was able to sum up her team's perform­ance in Saturday's match against Adrian in one word: domination. 
"We expected to dominate, and we pretty much did," said Knish, who played a big role in the Belles' 9-0 dismantling of Adrian in its first conference game of the year. "We worked really well as a team. I mean, the girls were some of the nicest we've played with, and they really played hard, which I real­ly respect. But we were just all really on our 'A' game, and it showed." 
Knish certainly backed up her post-game talk, beating Laura Kelley 6-1, 6-1 from the No. 1 spot for her second win of the year and first in conference.

squad followed suit, giving up only 19 points across the board. While most matches take upwards of five hours, the Belles had finished taking care of Adrian within a speedy three hours. 
Sophomore Kristen Palombo also played strongly, defeating Liz Filipiak from the No. 2 spot in consecutive sets, 6-0, 6-0. No. 3 singles player Kaitlin Cutler continued her stellar season, taking down her opponent 6-1, 6-0, to improve her overall record on the year to 8-1. 
No. 4 singles player Kris Spriggle also moved to an over­all record of 8-1 after winning straight sets 6-1, 6-0 over Heather Fraser. At the No. 5 spot, sophomore Kate Bowler posted a· 6-2, 6-1 victory over Karen Kruisenga to match her teammates' success. 
"It was a great start to our season," said No. 6 singles play­er Miranda Mikulyuk, who took down Lyndsey Davis in straight sets, 6-4, 6-0. "It's always help­ful to our mentality as a team to get a conference win. I thought that we all played strongly. Each of us played our best game. 
"They're a nice team, but they're not actually our strongest competition. No mat­ter the opponent, it's always good to start a season out with a win." 
Although happy with the vic­tory, the team was also looking forward to its next game against conference rival Hope College. 
"We all played well, and we're really looking forward to our next match," said Knish. "We gave 100 percent in this match, and we plan on giving 117.5 percent in our next match." 
After demonstrating their skill in the six singles matches, the Belles showed a similar pen­chant for winning in their dou­bles matches. Knish and Bowler, who make up the No. 1 doubles team, defeated Adrian's No. 1 tandem of Kelly and Cindy Kruisenga 6-2, 6-1 in straight sets. 
The other two doubles teams followed in form. The combina­tion of Cutler and Spriggle took down Adrian's pair, Liz Filipiak and Heather Fraser, 6-1, 6-1, to improve their doubles record to 7-1 on the year. In the No. 3 doubles spot, Palombo and freshman Grace Gordon were easily victorious over Adrian's Karen Kruisenga and Davis, 6­0, 6-1. 
"It was just all around a good day," Palombo said. "It was the first match where every single flight won, and we were very happy about that. Because it was on a Saturday, a lot of the parents showed up to watch, which was great. We're all very happy about how we've started the season, and we're looking forward to our game against Hope."

"That's been our mindset the entire time. We wanted to get to the NCAAs, that was our goal the entire time, its why you've worked so hard, and if you're going to go, why celebrate on just going? I think we have a very good chance to win, if we play well."

F~ 
McGraw has led five of her last seven teams into the Sweet 16 and this year's team has the ability to go far. She has as much experience as any coach and has been down this road before. McGraw has built Notre Dame into a national power.  Notre Dame plays defense first and offense second. The Irish hold opponents to just 58 points a game and play especially effective perimeter defense. They won't score a ton of points, but they usually don't need to.  Notre Dame got 28 points and 24 rebounds combined from Batteast and LaVere Sunday. With Borton not 100 percent, those two will be keys again today. Batteast will be the best player on the court again.  Duffy and Severe ran the Irish offense well in the first round. But Duffy and Joyce com­bined to make just 2-of­18 3-pointers. Those two need to shoot bet­ter for the team to have success today.  Notre Dame routine­ly uses eight players and all can be effec­tive in different ways. Borton, Joyce and Erwin may all be needed to make con­tributions at some point during the game.  The Irish have a much stronger bench that should help down the stretch. MTSU is stuck with its starters for the most part, even if they tire during the second half.  
This is the second team under Smith to make the tourney. She has never coached a team past the first round and has much less experience than McGraw. She is a tal­ented young coach but has not yet built a proven program.  MTSU also plays tough defense, allowing just 58 points a game. They're a more athletic team than Southwest Missouri State. The Blue Raiders are led by Holmes and Horton. who average nearly 30 points a game between them.  Horton and Stovall are the two inside forces for MTSU. Both scored in double fig­ures against North Carolina. Even though she's justa freshman, Horton took over the game against the Tar Heels.  Holmes leads the team in scoring ­averaging nearly 16 points a game -and can shoot the 3­pointer well. McOinic is one of the best defenders the Irish will see this sea­son and could be matched up-on Notre Dame's best shooter dur­ing most of the game.  MTSU used six players in its last game and really don't have much of a bench. The Blue Raiders will play their best five and substitute occasion­ally.  MTSU is this year's Cinderella and they have a confident mind­set heading into the game. If they can hang around early, then the Blue Haiders will gain even more confidence about beating the Irish.

pressure, and hung out on to a 6 7-62 victory. Middle Tennessee State's demeanor down the stretch of its first-round game impressed McGraw. 
"They play with great emo­tion, but also were very poised when North Carolina made their runs [Sunday)." McGraw said. 
Meanwhile the Irish needed an extra period to stop a determined Southwest Missouri State team. Forwards Jacqueline Batteast and Courtney LaVere combined for 28 points and 24 rebounds as Notre Dame outscored Southwest Missouri State 10-6 in the extra five minutes. Guard Megan Duffy added 16 points for the Irish. 
McGraw said Notre Dame's experience of playing close games was critical for the team Sunday and for the rest of the tournament.

"We didn't really swing the bats as well this past weekend as I would really like to see," he said. "But I attribute that to the fact that we didn't play during the week. When we start playing these mid-week games, I think we're really going to get into a groove swinging the bat and some good stuff is going to happen to us here in the future." 
Shortstop Greg Lopez, who proved one of the most consis­tent Irish hitters over the weekend by going 4-for-8 with a home run, leads the team with a .379 average. 
On the mound, Mainieri expects to start senior Joe Thaman against the Chippewas. Thaman, the left­handed converted first base­man, is 1-0 on the season with a 2.31 ERA over 11 2/3 innings pitched. 
The Chippewas enter the game with the Irish having won two of three from Illinois State. 

Central Michigan is batting .310 as a team on the season and average eight runs a game. 
The Chippewas are led at the plate by infielder Jim Geldhof with a .412 batting average, 22 runs scored and a slugging percentage of .676. First base­man Kurtis Wells leads Central Michigan with 25 RBis and boasts a .388 batting average.

court just prior to tip-ofT. 
Or he could have noticed the 
waves Thomas gave to dozens of 
family members who live in Fort 
Wayne, many of whom were 
watching Thomas play live in an 
Irish uniform for the first time. 
The Billikens, still in the locker room, didn't see the confidence Thomas exuded either. Then again, by the way Thomas was able to score at will in Notre Dame's 77-66 win Monday, it didn't seem like they were on the court for most of the game, either. It wasn't really fair that they happened to be the team standing on the tracks when the Thomas express roared past. 
Legendary among his team­mates for the way he religiously pops in Michael Jordan high­lights on road trips, Thomas car­ried the Irish past Saint Louis by stepping into the zone himself to turn in a spectacular perform­ance which included 12-of-20 shooting from the field, includ­ing 6-of-11 from 3-point range, and zero turnovers. 
Sure, it took him a while to get rolling-but Brey thought it was because the Irish point guard was deliberately trying to take it slow. And when the Irish walked into the halftime locker room trailing 26-25, the entire arena collectively wondered when the Irish would get going. 
The Irish never really did get going. Just Thomas. But that was more than enough 
Switching between driving to the basket to draw fouls and draining long 3-pointers, Thomas single-handedly picked apart the Saint Louis defense by scoring half of Notre Dame's sec­ond-half points. In a eight­minute span in the middle of the second-half, Thomas scored 21 of Notre Dame's 30 points­including 11 straight -to turn a two-point deficit into a 15-point blowout. 
Just how good was Thomas? On the play where he scored his 33rd and 34th points to set a career high, Thomas started with the ball at the top of the key, dribbled three steps to his left, launched his body toward the Irish bench and the ball toward the Irish basketball hoop. 
Thomas ended up on his back on the floor. The ball ended up in the hoop. 
"We always talk about MJ 
moments," Thomas said. "I had 
a little MJ moment when I hit 
that fadeaway shot. It kind of 
felt good." 
In typical Thomas fashion 
after the game, he dismissed his 
impressive scoring performance 
in favor of criticizing his 
defense. And the last thing on 
his mind before he went to sleep 
Monday was the ninth free­
throw attempt he shot-· the one 
that rattled out of the rim and 
the one that would have made 
him the first Irish player in over 
a decade to score 40 points in 40 
minutes. 
"That's what I'm going to be 
thinking about all day," he said 
with a half-chuckle about the 
only free-throw he missed in 10 
attempts. 
It's hard to tell who takes 
more criticism -Thomas, for a 
style of play that alternates 
between spectacular and spo­
radic, or Brey, for letting 
Thomas play with almost reck­
less abandon. 
But nights like Monday show Thomas' true greatness as a basketball player, where he sim­ply takes his team in his hands, interweaving Notre Dame's des­tiny with his own. And when Thomas makes the kinds of shots he did against Saint Louis, defenders, fans and teammates can only shake their heads in disbelief. 
"Everybody wants me to coach him like Jimmy Chitwood. He's not Jimmy Chitwood, he's a unique talent," Brey said, evok­ing images of Hoosiers in a bas­ketball-starved state where only the Irish are playing. "There's an example of a guy who has to have some freedom to play, the textbook stuff doesn't always go with this young man." 
By the time Brey pulled Thomas from the game with 
45.6 seconds to a standing ova­tion, the Irish point guard had all but ensured the Irish would move one win from making the NIT's Final Four. 
"That," Brey said, "has to be one of the great performances he has ever turned in an Irish uniform." 
And to think, his career isn't over yet.

hit back-to-hack 3-point goals, putting the Irish up 46-41. Saint Louis' Anthony Drejaj then missed two free throw shots'after being fouled by Chris Quinn and the Billikens would never recover the lead. 
The Irish defense was strong throughout the contest, espe­cially against 3-pointers by only allowing one during the entire game. 
Against Iowa in the first round of the NIT, Saint Louis shot seven 3-pointers, which helped the Billikens recover from an 18-point first half deficit. 
"We defended the 3-point line, they didn't shred us from there. We could absorb the twos because ... [Thomas] was scoring enough to absorb the twos," Brey said.

Thomas, electric atmosphere spark victory 
Irish advance to NIT quarters with win over St. Louis 
By SCOTT BRODFUEHRER Senior Staff Writer 
FORT WAYNE, Ind. -Listening to the roar of the crowd as the Irish came on the court, no one could tell that the team wasn't at the Joyce Center. From the band to the PA announcer to even corny timeout promotions. this was essentially a home game. 
Notre Dame fed on this ·"home" energy throughout the game, recovering from a sluggish first half where they trailed Saint Louis by a point to beat them by 11, with a final score of 77-66. 
"That's one of the best atmospheres I've ever been in," Irish coach Mike Brey said. 
"To come out and look up and you've got green shirts all the way to the ceil­ing. There's no question that motivated our kids and our kids were excited to play." 
Chris Thomas led the Irish to victory, picking up a career-high 39 points and playing a key role in the turning point in the game. 
With 12 minutes remaining in the sec­ond half, Jordan Cornette and Thomas

Thomas pours in 39 points as Irish defeat Billikens 77-66 
FORT WAYNE, Ind. -Chris Thomas was jacked. His head coach was worried 

Over an hour remained before tip-ofT and the Irish junior bounced around his team's warm­up line, uncharacteristically throwing down pre-game dunks to the delight of the Irish crowd. 
Each display of athleti­cism simultaneously elicited a roar from those in the crowd and a grin from the player who just slammed the ball through the hoop. 
But Mike Brey noticed the unusual energy emanating from Thomas, and pulled him aside in the locker room. Calm down, Brey essentially told him, and let the game come to you. 

"How stupid was I," the Irish coach said after the game where Thomas lit up Saint Louis for a career-high 39 points­27 of which came in a second-half blitzkrieg that sent the Irish to the NIT's third round. 
Then again, Brey should have seen how Thomas gazed around the Fort Wayne Coliseum, immersing himself in the roar the Irish received when they sauntered onto the

Middle Tennessee State may have been the No. 13 seed when it defeated No. 4 seed and 12th-ranked North Carolina in the first-round of the NCAA Tournament Sunday, but don't tell Muffet McGraw that. 
To McGraw, the Blue Raiders victory was no fluke. 
"I honestly think that the best team won that game," McGraw said. "I thought Middle Tennessee played much better as a team and played · 
well together." 
Notre Dame looks to end Middle Tennessee State's Cinderella run in the NCAA Tournament at the Joyce Center tonight in a second­round matchup that sends the winner to the Sweet 16 in Hartford, Conn.

Irish open home season today 
By CHRIS FEDERICO Senior Staff Writer 
After five weeks and 15 straight games on the road, the Irish are rP-ady to return to Notre Dame and the comfort of Frank Eck Stadium for their home opener today. 
Notre Dame (13-2) will host Central Michigan (6-1 0), as the Irish kick off their 2004 home season. 
"It's going to be really great to finally be home at Eck Stadium after being on the road for five weeks," Irish coach Paul Mainieri said. "Our first 15 games have been on the road, so hopefully we'II be able to play at home [today]. There are a lot of people on this team looking forward to that." 
The Irish, who split a pair of games with Southern Illinois over the weekend, have climbed as high as No. 6 in the most recent Collegiate Baseball Newspaper poll. The most recent Baseball America poll has Notre Dame ranked 13th. 

For an Irish team that began the season with some unusual­ly hot hitting, the bats cooled off somewhat during the weekend series with the Salukis. In the two games, the Irish batted just .231 as a team and scored only nine runs. 
Mainieri says he attributes the lack of Irish ofTense to the fact that the team had not played a game in a week before meeting the Salukis last Saturday. He hopes that the return to playing mid-week games and seeing action on a more consistent basis will return the pop to the Irish bats.
