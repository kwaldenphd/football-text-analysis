Social psychologist says feminism isn't only a woman's issue 
By CLIFF STEVENS 
News Staff 
Social psychologist Sister Joan Chittister told a packed auditorium last night that "women across the world were bought, sold, enslaved, made poor, raped and beaten by rule of thumb while we sat here tonight." 
Citing figures aimed to show the lack of women in the upper ranks of the educational system, business world, government and church, Chittister called for change in these institutions. 
She said female orientation is a "cop-out" goal rarely pursued in conjunction with obtaining higher church positions for women. 
"Feminism is not a woman's issue; all of us are less human because this society and this church are sexist," she said. 
The issues of poverty and hunger are connected to feminism because two-thirds of the hungry and three­fourths of the poor are women, ac­cording to Chittister. 
She also said sexism, racism and militarism " ... are of a piece with sexism as the cornerstone." 
Chittister said the dominance of men who "own, administer, shape and control" society has led to an 
'Hoopster Hysteria' to benefit SB charity 
By REGI RICHTER

Using the Notre Dame in­signia, a thesaurus and a little ingenuity, four Notre Dame business students have organiz­ed "Hoop Hysteria," a small T­shirt selling venture which now has developed into a major fun­draiser for South Bend's Logan Center. 
Stanford Hall residents John Sullivan, Tom McHugh, Mike O'Grady and Dan Tanczos said they tossed around different ideas before opting to enter the T -shirt salesmarket. All ideas, however, were based on the theory that "anything with the Notre Dame insignia can sell," the students said. 
Sales began at the start of the basketball season, after obtain­ing the help of a designer, Lenny Hanlock, and a thesaurus to "find a catchy phrase," Sullivan said. 
And as the Irish basketball record rose, so did sales of the T -shirts, which read "Destina­tion Dallas" on the back. 
Realizing their endeavor could be bigger than originally

interpretation of the world which assumes male superiority. 
She said this view includes and 
"untenable" Christian theology not 
based on the Biblical teachings of 
Jesus. 
Jesus was a feminist, and that's 
the best-kept ecclesiastical secret of 
all time," said Chittister. 
Jesus ignored sexist Jewish tradi­tions through His acts, she said. One example Chittister cited from the Gospel was His public teaching and speaking to women. She said that no good Jew of the time would have done the same. 
Chittister also said that Biblical studies have revealed "hanky­panky" present in the English translation of the Bible which ad­vance the notion of male superiori­ty. 
"Plato said that women were created from the wicked men as punishment for being irrational," she said. 
Chittister said that Thomas Aquinas regarded women as "car­nal" while he thought " ... redemp­tion required reason resisting car­nality." 
The modern marrigae ceremony reflects this view, she said. "It's man and wife, not man and woman as in person instead of property."

"It's a matter of principle," Rossow said. ''They're not harming anyone, and they have the right to be heard on their student station." 
Rossow said she had an idea the firing was coming after a meeting with Cafarelli Friday. "They just couldn't allow someone who defied them to remain in office," she said. 
During the meeting, she said, Cafarelli gave no logical reasons for why the announcement should be discontinued. 
Cafarelli said last week that the University administrators banned the group's announcements because ''there has to be some concern for the interests of the institution relative to what goes out as part of our programming." Cafarelli could not be reached for comment yester­day. 
"I think the announcement should stay on the air. It was wrong for the administration to force it to be removed," Pesta said. 
But in order to avoid further con­frontation on the matter, Pesta siad he suggested the compromise fine arts guidelines. He said the new rule doesn't make the announce­ment's removal an arbitrary action, and will allow him to remain with

International students at ND bring new customs and diversity 
Walking across the quad, it's not uncommon to hear voices speaking in an unfamiliar language. Ex­otic clothing can at times be seen around campus. "Strange" customs are observed by some students. 
The people who exhibit these unfamiliar traits are part of a unique and richly varied presence at Notre Dame: the international students. They come from as far away as Malaysia, or as close as Mexico. But they came for many of the same reasons -they desired a quality education at a prominent university, and they took the risk of experiencing a culture sometimes radically different from their own, in order to learn more about the world they live in. 
On a campus that sometimes appears stifling in its homogeneity -white, Catholic and middle-class ­the international students bring in a fresh breeze of diversity. Many of them speak English with difficul­ty, and their struggles to learn give friends and room­mates both amusement and a smattering of another language. 
Many also have different religions, which can be eye-opening for those raised in Catholic schools all their lives. Hindus and Moslems are especially numerous among Notre Dame's foreign students, and there are few better ways to get acqainted with some of the world's major religions. 
Foreign students also can give a personal perspective to world events. From knowing several Filipinos on campus, for instance, I have been able to follow the recent events in the Philippines with a closeness and a real interest that I otherwise wouldn't have had. 
In history and government classes, foreign students often add a dimension of reality by raising their hands and, speaking from experience, making knowledgeable comments about the situation in some faraway country. 
The presence of these students is a rare opportunity for American students. Few other places than univer­sities have such a high concentration of foreigners. 
And the opportunity is growing. This year, there are 436 foreign students at Notre Dame, almost a 20 per­cent increase over last year. There are also 44 foreign students at Saint Mary's. And the numbers promise to continue rising. 
Most of the international students here are graduate students, but many are undergraduates. They are represented in almost every department and major. 
Father Theodore Hesburgh, University president, has announced his commitment to increasing this enrollment even further. If possible, he said he would like to bring in students from the Soviet Union and other communist countries (there are already 55 Chinese students here, as well as others from Eastern Europe). 
This would be an unparalleled experience for American students, who could see and hear first-hand

about societies and mental outlooks completely unknown to them. 
The biggest event of the year for international students, the International Students' Organization Festival, takes place Friday in Washington Hall. In this annual extravaganza, the students from around the world have a chance to publicly display their diverse cultures. Dances, songs, and even a kung fu demonstration will be presented in shows representing 20 different nations. 
Of course, being at Notre Dame is not always fun and games for the foreign student. Especially for those from Asia and Africa, culture shock is in­evitable from the extremely different customs, social conventions and even climate. As we all know, classes at Notre Dame are hard enough with a perfect understanding of English. 
For those hearty souls who are so intrigued by other nations that they are will~ng to actually immerse themselves in a foreign society, there is no shortage of places to go. Semester-abroad programs in such varied places as Mexico, England, Austria, France, Egypt, Rome and Israel, plus organized trips to China and the Soviet Union among others, speak for Notre Dame's international interest. 
Getting to know a foreign student is an invaluable experience. From knowing Filipinos, I have learned not only some of the nuances of Asian culture, but how to say "How are you?" in Filipino, and even the wacky Filipino sense of humor.

"A Family Celebration of Life" is the theme for the second community-wide Charity Ball, scheduled for May 2 at the Athletic and Convocation Center. 
The ball, part of a large-scale campaign against world hunger by a joint effort of the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's communities, will work toward this year's goal of $10,000, according to Saint Mary's commissioner Meg Heffernan. 
Featured speaker at the event will be Notre Dame football coach Lou

According to Heffernan, the pro­ject involves the efforts of more 300 E. Colfax 
than 30 Notre Dame and Saint at the River 
Mary's students. 
Since last semester, Notre Dame 
commissioners Pat Collins and 
Karen Povinelli have been meeting 
weekly with Saint Mary's commis­
sioners Kathy Hartweger and Hef­
fernan. Others involved include 
representatives from each dorm, 
who help publicize the event, Hef­
fernan said. 
Although the specific use of the 
proceeds will not be determined un­
til the end of this week, she said 
Catholic Relief Services has been 
instrumental in helping the com­
mission determine a worthy reci­
pient of the funds. 
Proceeds from a similar event last year were forwarded to agen­cies supplying grain and other foods to Ethiopia. 
"We're looking not to feed for a day but hopefully to invest funds in economic interests," said Heffer­nan. 
The Charity Ball commission plans for Holtz to kick off the event at halftime of the champion­ship game in this year's Bookstore Basketball tournament. On the 
night of the dance, scheduled 
events include a cocktail party for 
seniors at Saint Mary's and a VIP . reception in the Monogram Room of the ACC. 
Dorm representatives and com­
missioners are currently working 
on other activities to take place the 
week prior to the dance to promote 
awareness of world hunger, Heffer­
nan said. 
The event will be semi-formal, 
featuring a live band and a D.J. to 
provide a variety of music for 
guests. Hours for the dance are 8 
p.m. to 1 a.m. 
Tickets are $5 per person or $8 
per couple, and also will be made 
available for faculty members 
through each department and the 
alumni office. The ACC and the 
Saint Mary's alumni office will also 
be distributing tickets to the com­
munity. 
Students can purchase tickets 
through their dorm representatives, 
Heffernan said. 
"It's the end of the year and we realize that not everyone has money to give," she said. "But we want to make this an event that people want to come to." 
Notre Dame ends boycott of Campbell 
By MEG EGAN 
News SUI// 
Notre Dame's almost three-year boycott of Campbell Soup Company products ended officially on Feb. 21, said William Hickey, director ofUni· versity Food Services Tuesday. 
"We have received notification from the Office of Student Affairs that the Campbell's boycott Is offi­cially over, and we are now per­mitted to visit salesmen from Campbell's," Hickey said. 
In 1980, and again In 1983, Notre 
Dame students voted in a referen­
dum to suppon a boycott of 
Campbell. Suspension of the: boycott 
occurred Feb. 21 in response to an 
agreement signed by Campbell's. 
The agreement grants union recognition to the Farm Labor Or­ganizing Committee, and ensures improved working and living condi­tions for farmworkers. 
1be boycott's end will not neces­sarily mean a new Influx of Campbell's products products to the dining halls, however, Hickey said. 
"Whatever products that will fit into our program that we were deprived ofas a result of the boycott we will resume buying -such as V8 Juice," Hickey explained. 
"We're not going to drop Heinz just because Campbell's is now aut· horized," he said. 
Hickey said he did not know the significance of the University's par­ticipation to the boycott's outcome. "I .know that Campbell's people were anxious to be on an authorized list at the University." According to Hickey, Campbell's wants to con­tinue to promote itselfas a reputable company, not a boycotted one.

Rep. Pepper opposes mandatory retirement 
WASHINGTON-Rep. Claude Pep­per, a vigorous 85-year-old who declares that "agism is as odious as sexism and racism," sought to enlist public support yesterday for his proposal to outlaw mandatory retirement of American workers at any age. 
Presiding at a televised House hearing, Pepper said the bill he has introduced with 50 House co­sponsors is intended to extend to every American -with a few excep­tions -the right enjoyed by federal employees to "be as old as Met­huselah and continue to work, ifyou can do the job." 
Pepper, D-Fla., said he probably would be dead today ifhe had been forced to retire at age 65, three years after he was first elected to the House in 1962 following a Senate career that began nearly a half­century ago. 
Despite two hearing aids, triple­focus glasses, a pacemaker in his chest and two plastic valves in his

Pesta said Rossow's removal has caused problems because she has completely divorced herself from the station. As a senior, he said, the station was counting on her to helpt train new personnel being hired and elected for next year. 
McDaniel said, "I think that it is a purely informational announce­ment. I'm very disappointed in the administration's intervention." 

Since Rogers chose to disregard the announcement when he took over temporarily, McDaniel said, WVFI~AM has had no problem with the administration since the resignatino.

expected, the four decided they 
should find a charity where the 
profits could be donated. 
Logan Center was chosen because it has been designated this year's special project the men's basketball team. 
Calling themselves "Students for Logan Center," the four said they decided to set a $1 ,000 goal toward the . purchase of a wheelchair for Logan Center resident Faith Acrey. 
Sullivan said the group plann­ed to supplement its $1,000 fund-raising with $500 donated by Logan Center. $1,500 would be added by Carey's Medicaid plan to complete the final pay­ment toward the $3,000 wheelchair. 
But sales were higher than ex­pected, McHugh said, and the group was able to pay for Logan Center's $500 portion of the payment. 
After the South Bend Tribune featured the "Hoop Hysteria" fundraiser in a mid-February ar­ticle, Medicaid immediately ap­proved its part of the donation. 
Sullivan said the article also prompted a flood of phone calls to Logan Center, most from people wanting to contribute to the cause. 
'We hope enough money will be raised to buy at least one, if not two more wheelchairs," he said, referring to how the caller' donations would be used. 
Sullivan, McHugh, O'Grady and Tanczos said they all agree the experience gained from the sale was valuable. 
'We really enjoyed being able to do the service for Logan Center," O'Grady said. 
"It was a great chance to do something fun, while still help­ing others," added Tanczos. 
Although sales of the T -shirt have slowed with the Notre Dame home schedule coming to a close, "Hoop Hysteria" T­shirts will continue to be sold by the "Students for Logan Center" as the Irish beging the NCAA tournament this weekend.

S. African controversy, violence continues 
Associated Press 
JOHANNESBURG -Prominent whites joined anti-apartheid groups yesterday in angry response to a report that police fired into a black crowd without provocation the day before, and to banning orders against two black leaders. 
"A culture of(black) resistance is being born before our eyes," said Frederick van Zyl Slabbert, a white politician. "I say there cannot be any peaceful change in South Africa. We are caught up in violence." 
Police said the crowd of 2,000 people outside a courtroom in Kabokweni township Tuesday refused to disperse and got out of control. A teen-age boy was killed and 80 people were wounded. 
Another boy was killed by police gunfire in the township later Tues­day. 
Yesterday, a black man was speared to death in the KaNgwane homeland adjacent to the township, and three blacks were injured by stone-throwers outside Kabokweni. 
Police said a black officer was killed early yesterday in Alexandra township near Johannesburg, scene ofbloody rioting last month. 
Enos Mabuza, chiefminister ofthe KaNgwane homeland, demanded a full investigation ofTuesday's shoot­ing. "Most of the pupils who were interviewed at the Themba Hospital had birdshot wounds on their backs," he said. 
Kabokweni is near White River 155 miles east ofJohannesburg, near the Mozambique border. 
Albertina Sisulu, president of the anti-apartheid United Democratic Front, called the shooting "an act of cowardice." 
The Progressive Federal Party, the main political opposition, said it had begun its own investigation. Slab­bert resigned as party leader and member of Parliament recently in the beliefthat the legislature will not reform the race policy that gives South Africa's 5 million whites privilege and denies rights to the 24 million blacks. 
Police said they fired tear gas and then birdshot at the crowd that gat­hered outside the small courtroom in which black youths were facing 
riotc,es. An '. cial statement said a 14­year-q d was shot dead and 80 people were wounded, and a 15­year-old was killed and another youth wounded in later shooting. 
election campaigns and S10 million to other U.S. candidates. 
The letter provided no documentation to support the claim and there was no independent verification. It also did not say that any money actually was paid or that any U.S. official agreed to accept it. 
Salonga said he received the letter Saturday from former banker An­tonio Gatmaitan, who said it was written by 14 Filipino bankers whom he refused to identify. 
In Washington, White House spokesman Larry Speakes said he was unaware of any such influence­buying scheme by Marcos. 
Aquino met for more than an hour with 61 top generals and regional military commanders at Camp Aguinaldo, where the revolution that put her in power Feb. 2 5 began. 
A videotape of the meeting showed Aquino telling the officers, "I'm sure the Filipino people will be forever grateful to you." 
It was apparently a reference to the military's role in installing her. The military officials who led the revolution backed Aquino's claim that she won the Feb. 7 presidential election even though Marcos was declared the victor by the Marcos­dominated National Assembly. 
ChiefofStaff General Fidel Ramos, who was Marcos' deputy military commander before he defected to support Aquino, said all the officers "pledged our support and loyalty to the commander-in-chief." 
Earlier yesterday, Aquino met with her full Cabinet. The ministers put off a decision on whether to declare a revolutionary govern ment, assigning the matter to a com­mittee.

U.S. envoy sent to C. America 
A88odated Press 
WASHINGTON President Reagan, trying to bolster his case for military aid for Nicaraguan rebels, sent special envoy Philip Habib to Central America yesterday and said critics who claim the United States is not interested in a negotiated settle­ment "are making ridiculous noises." 
Habib's three-nation itinerary does not include a stop in Nicaragua. "You don't go where you're not invited," Reagan said. 
The Nicaraguan embassy in Was­hington, however, said Habib was welcome in Managua "if the admin­hority to visit Nicaragua for talks with the Sandinista regime "ifanyth­ing comes up that would show that there might be any prospect or any profit in doing that." 
istration  honestly  wants  to  
negotiate."  
Reagan said Habib has the  aut­ 

After conferring with Habib, Reagan met privately with about a half-dozen congressmen to try to win their votes for sending S70 mil­lion in military aid and S30 million worth ofnon-lethal assistance to the Nicaraguan rebels. 
At this point, the administration says it faces an uphill fight to win the money. The Democratic-controlled House is scheduled to vote March 19 on the package, while the Republican-led Senate is tenr.&tively scheduled to vote the next day. 
There was renewed talk on Capitol Hill about a compromise on the package. However, presidential spokesman Larry Speakes said, "We're not interested in anything short of getting the president's pacakge approved, without restric­tlons." 
Yet, Reagan did not rule out the possibility ofa 60 or 75-day delay in delivering aid, to give negotiations another chance. "We're continuing to talk about all possibilities like that," Reagan said. 

Indiana professor accused by AlA 
A.88oc1atedPress 
INDIANAPOUS · A conservative group is accusing a professor at In­diana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis of promoting leftist ideologies in his class. 
Accuracy in Academia, es­tablished last August as part of the Washington-based Accuracy in Media, reports on perceived leftist bias and inaccurate information in classes and campus lectures based on letters from college students. 
The group intends to make profes­sors more careful about what they say and how they document their facts, said Les Csorba, the group's ex­ecutive director. 
Victor Wallis, the first IU profes­sor to be targeted by the group, allegedly promoted socialist views by assigning his class to read the socialist weekly, "In These Times." 

A student in Wallis' comparative politics class submitted a letter com­plaining that the professor did not analyze the weekly or offer opposing opinions. 
"All he does is expound on his par­
ticular ideology," the student said in 
his letter to the conservative group. 
Wallis said he requires occasional readings from the weekly but said the class analyzes issues in the publication. 
"It (the accusation) is not going to alter what I'm going to say In class," said the associate professor ofpoliti· cal science. 
Wallis said he does not want to release the accusing student's name until he deals with the situation next week after spring break. 
Troy Wright, a student in Wallis' class, said the professor lets students ask questions about the weekly and encourages discussion of all view­points. 
"He lets us draw our own conclu­sions," Wright said. 
Wallis said he assigned the weekly to expose the students to a view­point they would not find in a com­mon publication.

Speaker series appreciated 
Confusion about the changing roles of men and women in the 1980s may trouble col­lege graduates today as they attempt to reconcile traditional family lifestyles and values with new roles for both sexes in society. 
Students from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, many with traditional backgrounds, may have particular problems with current role readjustments. 
The junior class at Notre Dame has taken positive steps to educate and inform students of choices available to them today; choices other than traditional male/female roles. 
''The Quiet Revolution: A View of Changing Views and Lifestyles," the speaker series initiated and coordinated by the junior class, comes to a close today with Gloria Steinem's lecture ''The '80s: The Second Wave." 
Steinem's talk follows three other lectures by influential women well-known for their views of the current roles of men and women. 
John Gormley, Flanner hall representative to the junior class, said he saw a need for such a series on both campuses, and initiated the series, after consultation with junior class officers. 
He and other co-sponsors were able to attract speakers such as Jean Kilbourne, an expert on sex stereotyping in the media; Phyllis Schlafly, well-known conservative leader and opponent of the feminist movement; Sarah Weddington, the lawyer who won the 1973 Roe vs. Wade case which legalized abortion; Sister Joan Chittister, ad­vocate of women's rights in the Church; and Steinem, a leader of the feminist move­ment and editor of Ms. magazine. 
The speaker series has enjoyed an enthusiastic response thus far from the students, faculty and staff. The popularity of the lectures have indicated the worth of the series, and the need for open discussion of these topics at both schools. 
The junior class, Gormley, and the co-sponsors on the two campuses are to be com­mended for a well-run, well-organized week of interesting, invigorating and thought­provoking programs. Undoubtedly, the views of some of the speakers were not com­patible to many of those attending. 
But the participation indicates that Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students are will­ing to open themselves up to other views on roles they soon will be assuming in society. 
Thanks to Notre Dame's junior class, students will be that much better prepared to understand and appreciate the different options available for both men and women after graduation.

'Wilson Awards' highlighted 
It's award season again, with the Emmy's now awarded and the Oscars coming up, we have plenty of opportunities to recognize those we feel have done a good job over the past year. Now it's my turn. i hereby an­nounce the first pseudo-annual Wilson Awards. They are not necessarily awarding achievements, but just things I want to recognize -good or bad. So here they are: 
William Wilson or to tear the pages 
The Keep Your Chin Up Award goes to Ryan White, Kokomo's fourteen year old AIDS victim. He has been kept out of school for over a year, and was finally readmitted but on his first day back a local judge issued an order keeping him out of school again. This poor kid is getting a bad deal. 
The Social Commentary Award goes to Sting for his song "Russians." At last so­meone is telling it like it is. 
The Boredom Award goes to South Bend radio stations. One trip to Chicago will ex­plain. 
The Turkey of the Year Award goes to Ronald Reagan. He still wants to increase defense spending while cutting social pro­grams -including financial aid for college students -despite Gramm-Rudman. 
The Last Guy I Want For My Chief of Police Award goes to U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese, who believes that people aren't arrested unless they're guilty. Oh my. 
The Concert of the Year Award goes to George Winston for his "A Seasonal Celebration" concert last December at Chicago's Auditorium Theatre. This Win­dham Hill pianist has talent. Lots of talent. 
The T.V. show of the Year Award goes to 
Doonesbury

two shows: "Cosby" and "Miami vice." These shows made watching TV fun and ex­citing. Producers, take note. 
The Man of the Year Award goes to Bob Geldof. Enough said. 
The Philanthropist of the Year A ward goes to Mrs. Ray Kroc, for her six million dollar donation to Notre Dame to establish an institute for peace studies. It's nice to see money spent on peace instead of war for a change. 
The Fireside Chat Award goes to Presi­dent Reagan and Soviet President Gorgachev. They finally sat down to talk last November, let's hope it becomes a habit. 
The Big Expectations A ward to new Irish coach Lou Holtz. He's got a lot of people ex­pecting some big things from him, and here's wishing him lots of luck. 
The Last Guy I Want for my Election Commissioner Award goes to former Philip­pine President Ferdinand Marcos. One might want him for a campaign manager, though. 
The Business Decision of the Year goes to the Coca-Cola Company. The old coke is now the new Coke and the new Coke is now the old Coke ... can i have aginger ale? 
The What Are We Gonna Do With This Thing? Award goes to South Bend's ethanol plant. 
And finally, the Less-Than Intelligent Per­son of the Year Award goes to anyone who, during the winter months, doesn't clean off their windows, brake lights, or back up lights, insists on turning through snowy in­tersections at no less than thirty miles per hour, and doesn't wear their seatbelts, regardless of the season. 
William Wilson is a sophomore govern­ment and international studies major at Notre Dame and a regular Viewpoint colum­nist.

P.O.BoxQ 
Another ND student 
voices his complaints 
Dear Editor: 

With regards to you, Bill Healy, I can keep quiet no more. In Wednesday's Observer you are quoted as saying that "only" 48 percent of the students who voted "at all" chose divestment. Your conclusion is that ''the stu­dent body doesn't overwhelmingly support divestment." 
Let me ask you, Healy, who voted you in­to office? The students. Did they over­whelmingly support you? Did you garner 100 percent of the vote? No. But this is a democratic society, right? The majority wins. 
I feel the need to explain these simple dynamics to you, Healy, because you seem to have forgotten them. Whether divestment garnered 100 percent or 5 percent, the fact is the majority of the students on this campus want divestment. And therefore you, as SBP, must support that majority voice. For hasn't it been you, Healy, who in your deity­like wisdom have made decisions all year by claiming you are ''the voice of the students"? Since you claim you are that voice, live up to it. Don't just hand in the figures to the Board of Trustees and disassociate yourself from the issue of divestment. The students want it: they've shown this. 
You've been a constant disappointment and embarrassment as SBP this year. Your motives have been all too clear -why rub elbows with the students when elbow­rubbing with the administration and trustees can get you so much further? You're shallow as the width of a dime, Healy. Your actions are pompous and arrogant. Come back down to earth, Bill. We're waiting here for 
you. Mike English Senior 
Fresh air enters offices of student government 
Dear Editor: 

I am writing in response to Katy Ken­nelly's March 10 article, "What a mockery the elections indicated." Kenelly, I have many problems with your rash article. First of all, you state that in the voting in of Mike Switek and Don Montanaro for student body president and vice president, the students used "childish mentality"; however, this childish mentality that you say was used, was used by 52 percent of the students who were concerned enough or able enough to vote. I don't think this 52 percent appreciates your calling their vote "childish." 
Second, in your article, you ask, "How can the administration be expected to take seriously anything that next year's student government states?" I ask you, "How seriously did the administration listen to this year's student leaders, or any individual or group efforts attempting to change policy?" Maybe our new leader's efforts and new type of ideas will influence the administration. 
In your article, you once again knock the "bright, concerned individuals" of Notre Dame by saying that they elected two jokers. Mike Switek and Don Montanaro appear to be a breath of fresh air to the conglomera­tion of student offices. Montanaro said he wants to bring the smiles back to students' faces. These two individuals appear to be creative and willing, at least 52 percent of the voters support their capabilities. Kennelly, I don't know if it is sour grapes, but you should have thought more before you knock­ed 52 percent of the voters and also the men

Student crime destroys student's faith in ND 
Dear Editor: 
In the past two days, two events have caus­ed n_te to lose faith in what I still cosnider one of the most honest groups of people I'm associated with -the Notre Dame student body. The first was the stealing of my wallet from my locker inteh Rock Sunday during the five minutes I showered, when I stupidly and trustingly left the lock off. I just assum­ed nothing would happen, since I had never even locked the locker I used until Sunday. In addition to my drivers license, social security card, military ID, bank card and pictures was a measly $2. 
Much worse than this though, was a theft which occurred at a party at my house Mon­day night. Being a Monday night party, it was relatively small and most people there kncrw each other, although there were some my, housemates and I didn't know. A friend of mine was taking pictures with her Olym­pus OM-10 camera, when she put it down in a corner to protec it. It was from this protec­tive corner that someone stole it. Also stolen from previous parties have been a tap and a California Ave street sign, which I can't replace. It would be greatly appreciated if these articles were returned to either our house or to lost and found. Of course, no qQestions will be asked. 
These are not break in burglaries, but thefts from basically under the noses of peo­ple. I think it's a shame that within the great community of students we have here, a per­son cannot leave a locker unlocked or put a camera down in a friend's house. Please help restore my faith.

Congratulates students on outstanding actions 
Dear Editor: 
Alumni, parents and friends in the Milwaukee area have been fortunate to have a number of Notre Dame athletic teams routinely visit to compete against Marquette University. We have enjoyed watching the competition and meeting the student-athletes at post-game parties. This past weekend, the men's basketball team staged another great victory, similar to others that have made this series with Marquette such a great rivalry. 
Equally impressive, however, was the con­duct of the rather large contingent of Notre Dame students who came to Milwaukee for the game. A reporter for the Milwaukee Journal attended the Notre Dame club of Milwaukee Basketball Party and interviewed a number of Notre Dame students as well as others. His observations, published the following day, provided a very positive im­age of Notre Dame fans, particularly in 
regard to  sportsmanship and public  man­ 
ners.  
A  number  of  alumni  separately  com­ 

mented how the visiting students were so well-mannered, in spite of an over-capacity crowd at the party. Congratulations are in order to all the visiting students for their display of the true Notre Dame Spirit!

Worst abuse in nine years at Notre Dame 
As an alumnus of the University and presently working within its administration. I have withheld public comment on the deal­ings of the student body president. Given my position, I have felt that it was not my place to be openly critical of what should be an im­portant extension of the undergraduate stu­dent body. With recent events, however, I can no longer remain silent. These recent events include the publication of "We the People." Those sixteen pages of self­congratulatory drivel are indicative of the greatest abuse of student interests I have seen in my nine years of association with Notre Dame. 
John Fitzpatrick guest column 
After graduating in 198I, I spent two-and­
one-half years as a volunteer with the Holy 
Cross Fathers in Kenya. I returned to Notre 
Dame in 1984 because I was grateful to Holy 
Cross and Notre Dame for my profound ex­
perience abroad that I wanted to give 
something in return. I thought the greatest 
thanks I could give would be to put my ex­
perience to the service of students here. With 
service to students as my only reason for be­
ing here, I am scandalized to see something 
as self-serving as the Healy administration 
and to see such a wanton waste of students' 
money as "We the People." 
Under the first signs of pressure during the recall campaign, Bill Healy spent over three­hundred dollars of student funds on a full­page ad in The Observer to defend himself. he must not have considered this to be suffi­cient because he then spent a wad of adver­tising a public forum at which he could de­fend himself in person. The first issue of "We the People" was quick to follow. That could not ~ave cost under two-hundred dollars. Afte'r that came the onslaught of ''Students Serving Students" posters. At Christmas, he sent cards on high-quality sta­tionery to staff heads around the University and God knows where else. 
All these things were not uncovered by in­vestigation. These are things I have bad to confront simply by opening my door and looking outI It boggles my mind to think of all the other possible instances where he might have thrown away money. And whose money did he think he was using? His own? I thought Republicans were supposed to be fiscally conservative! 
Now Healy is listed as the managing editor of "We the People." The lastest issue con­tains two large pictures of Healy, a lengthy interview with him, and fifty direct references to him by name or position. I dare not count the number of times he is referred to, by himself or by others, through the use of personal pronouns. For this his office us­ed sixteen pages of card-quality paper with double stapling, twelve pictures, two ink col­rs, and a run a surely 3,000-plus copies. This is an obscene misuse of what what must have been thousands of dollars. 
Students have many reasons to be up in arms about that publication. Women students should be especially outraged. Are we to infer from the picture of "all the presi­dent's men" that there are no eager and talented women here who are worthy of be­ing included in the "inner circle?" It is very fitting, though, that he would be identified with a phrase that symbolizes a president who got caught abusing his position. Are the "quotable quotes" supposed to be amusing? Most of them are blatant pot-shots at Healy detractors. And how can a person who has spent thousands of other people's dollars on self-promotion have the audacity to demand yet again that The Observer open its books? 
Certainly hard work by students on cam­pus projects should be gratefully 
acknowledged, but where in over ninety 
column-inches of ''The Year in Review" do 
we see any progress on real student issues? I 
do not think Healy has a good enough 
understanding of Notre Dame to recognize a 
real student issue if it slapped him in the 
face. He has registered the same progress on 
parietals, the alcohol policy, and student 
dissatisfaction with campus social life as 
every previous administration -zero. That 
could be expected. What other issues, then, 
did he engage which addressed the real life of 
this community? 

The most pressing issue might well be the 
composition of the student body. One of the 
most common student complaints is that 
Notre Dame is too homogeneous. Since I 
was a freshman, I have heard students 
describe, ad naseum, the greatest problem 
with this place-"Almost all persons here are 
from well-off, sheltered, conservative,'male­
dominant, white, Catholic backgrounds. 
And if that isn't enough to make them close­
minded and socially inept, they all went to 
single-sex high schools." Indeed, students 
here are uniform even to the extent that his 
universal, definitive account is almost 
always qualified by something like, "But that 
does not describe me." 
What did Healy do, personally, to ad­
vance the cause of diversity? Was it 
something he embraced enthusiastically? For 
all the attention "We the People" gives to 
work on minority student concerns, Healy 
did not even turn out any members of his ad­
ministration for the recent Unity Rally -an 
event intended to affirm those precious few 
students who do lend this place a little diver­
sity. In fact, Healy was to be seen surveying 
the turn-out with a smirk on his face as he 
made his own way to the Cashier's Office. It 
is all too clear that this is an issue of little 
value to him. 
Another issue which he failed (actually, refused) to grasp was that of divestment. How could he ignore its importance? Does he not read a newspaper and see that there are daily reports of escalating violence and repression in South Africa? Does he not hear or read about the growing number of people who believe that U.S. corporate presence there does more to support the racist regime than to dismantle it? Does he not have enough contact with the outside world to know that divestment is one of the hottest campus issues nation-wide? He says there is not enough interest here. Is he so new to Notre Dame that he can not recognize in­terest when he sees it? Only one other issue in the past ten years has drawn enough interest that he can not see the significance of a referendum? The last referendum (the NO­FLOC boycott of Campbell's), while never enjoying overwhelming student support, was so significant that when Campbell's finally capitulated, it took out a half-page ad in The Observer in an attempt to regain the good grace of "another great tradition: Notre Dame." 
What was Healy's response to the divest­ment issue? He fired from his cabinet the two students most responsible for bringing the issue to the attention of the student body and Board of Trustees. Then, at a rally on the Administration Building steps which was covered by all the local media and even the Chicago Tribune, he accused these two of "personal attacks" on certain members of the University administration and Board of Trustees. His right to select his cabinet is not at question here. What is at question is his right to impugn, in the most public forum possible, the character of two fellow students -and this without defining what he meant by "personal attack" and without substantiating that such ever occurred. He owes them a public apology. 
Healy would not take up the divestment issue, but he did call for the referendum on it. Because it was only with the demands of the recall petitioners that he agreed to put off the vote until spring, one assumes that originally he had called for the referendum only to deny pro-divestment forces the time to conduct an awareness and education cam­paign. When that referendum did pass in favor of divestment, he gave the indication that he would do no more than pass along the results to the Trustees. Referring to the 58 percent voter turn-out, he said that the 48 percent portion for divestment did not give the Anit-Apartheid Network a "claim to be representative of the students as a whole." 
He must not have had his brains turned on when he said that because, by the same logic, neither he nor his hero Ronald Reagan have any right to the offices they hold. Last year Healy ran a close race with a candidate who had been disqualified! Even if he had taken 100 percent of the votes cast, he still had no claim to represent the student body when less than 45 percent of students voted in that election. Healy's hero, in 1980, got only 27 percent of all possible votes! 
Healy must be completely ignorant of his position here. Not only did he fail to grasp what were the real issues, but he tried to eliminate the primary body where students could raise such issues! Whether or not it should be a senate as ours is presently struc­
tured, the student still need an entirely stu­
dent forum where all students are 
represented -a place where student issues can 
be raised, student positions formulated, and 
studetn strategies for promulgation of those 
positions mapped out. Such a body may not 
be the most efficient operation, but it is cer­
tainly the most legitimate. The student 
government administration has no right to 
that domain, and neither it nor the CLC fit 
its requirements. 
In the end, it is ironic that Healy was so 
enthusiastic about the Switek/Montanaro 
win. The election of such a non-conforminst 
ticket seems a clear repudiation of Healy's 
style and of his "reign." 
Having observed the cases presented within this article, I believe that Bill. Healy has attempted to take ''the best student body in the world" for a ride. Healy may be laughing all the way to law school, but the election of Switek/Montanaro indicates that many have become wise to Healy's kind of politics. Certainly many people within the Notre Dame community will remember Bill Healy for what really went on this year.

.,.O.Box Q 
Gertie Wimmer wrong on the value of life 
Dear Editor: 

"And in this particular case, the girl's life, 
and the life of everyone else involved, would 
be made easier if she chose to abort the 
child." 

"Yes, she would be committing murder .. 
one to save herself and her well-being." 
The preceding quotes were taken from Fri­day's guest column by Gertie Wimmer. Although I felt a few of Wimmer's arguments were on shaky ground (especially her rejection of adoption due to the "hurt" inflicted on the unplanned child and mother), I wish to address her rationaliza­tion of abortion. 
Wimmer, in her tirade against the Catholic Church's stand on artificial birth control, stumbled into the abortion controversy. As an affirmed ''pro-choice, not pro-abortion" advocate, Wimmer states that abortion is "noble." Abortion (in those ''necessary" cases) is life self-defense and, since self­defense is no crime, murder (Yes, Wimmer does call abortion murder.) is not wrong. Why is it justifiable? "It cannot be wrong if that is the choice you make," she says. 
Wonderful! If I have a choice to make in my life, and it involves my ''well-being" or how to make my life "easier", any choice I make is okay, according to Wimmer, because I am acting in self-defense. After all, isn't any burden or inconvenience a threat to our comfortable way of life? 
Don't you see the implications of this thinking, wimmer? Example 1: A family has a mildly handicapped child. Or, maybe a simple, yet costly, operation is needed to save a normal newborn's life. Using Wim­mer's logic, the child is a threat to our well­being since he or she requires extra financial and emotional care. Well, abortion is justifiable murder, so why no infanticide? Don't even consider the happiness the child may bring to the family -he or she is a burden. · 
Examply 2: An aging parent's health is deteriorating. The co~t of medical care is hurting financially, and the. family is ex­hausted emotionally. The parent is now a threat to our easy life and well-being. Abor­tion is justifiable murder, so why no euthanasia? If Wimmer sees abortion as an act of self-defense, could not one extend this line of thought to infanticide and euthanasia? 
We trivialize human life when we quantify it and give it meaning only when it fits into our neat little plan. Man's quest for the ideal world with no problems or inconveniences has helped put us on the "slippery slope." Where we will stop on this slope, or if we will at all, is up to us. I only hope that when we grow older, our children do not look on us as burdens or as threats to their well-being, but as human beings who have the most impor­tant right, the right to life. For without it, what other rights do we have anyway?

It's possible to have fun and run the government 
Dear Editor: 
When I first arrived at Notre Dame last August, I knew very little about life here and practically nothing about the people. From my brothers, who go to highly respected schools in the East, I received the impression that all schools were filled with easy-going, relaxed, friendly people who, together, wanted to ease the tension of studies and make life a little more bearable for everyone. However, after Monday's montage of Mike Switek/Don Montanaro hate letters, I found that Notre Dame does not live up to my ex­pectations. 
Perhaps the letter writers are upset because they voted for the losing ticket or that now they will not get the cabinet posi­tions promised to them during the campaign; nevertheless, it was a fair election and Switek and Montanaro won. Now that the Crayola Guys have the power people are taking cheap shots at them, unwilling even to give them a chance. I wonder if such people care to know that the two men they refer to as "clowns" have already begun working diligently with current student government leaders in an honest effort to· effect a smooth transition into their administration. 
They will undoubtedly be ready to take the helm on April I, and will surely be able to run an effective student government. It may be hard for some people around here to believe, but it is possible to smile, have fun, and be efficient all at the same time.

The F·A·C·T·S of DUI 
LEICESTER CHEONG 
features writer 
WbatisDUI? 

Driving under intoxication in In­diana is defined as driving with a blood alcohol concentration of 
0.10 percent. That may seem like a small percentage, until you con­sider that a BAC of only 0.30 per­cent will cause death, and that most people will pass out after a BAC of 
0.17 percent.  
DUI is not a minor offense in In­diana. It is a midemeanor, unless the intoxicated driver injures or kills someone. In that event, DUI becomes a felony. 
Tbe facts 

Last year, four out of every 10 fatal accidents in South Bend were alcohol-related. In 1984, it was six out of every 10. 
One out of every 10 drivers on the road will be legally drunk on Friday and Saturday nights between the hours of 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. 
One out of every two Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related auto accident sometime during their lives. 
Drunk-driving collisions is the 

number one cause of death among 
15-to 24-year-olds in America.

traffic accidents. In Indiana alone, an average of one person dies every hour in a drunk-driving crash. 
DUI Symptoms 

By the law, a suspected drunk driver can only be pulled over if the police officer has probable cause to suspect him of DUI. Otherwise, all evidence obtained that way would be void in court, even if the driver is indeed legally drunk. Each of the following actions can constitute probably cause: 
 
Taking too wide or too narrow turns. 

 
Swaying of car along a straight road. 


e Stopping short or long of stop signs, traffic lights, etc. 
 Not having headlights on. 
 Driving on the center road line. Driving on the extreme right of 
road. e Persistent abrupt braking. 
 Disregard for traffic signs. e Overspeeding or unuerspeeding. e Unsteady or abrupt turning. 
Police officers in Indiana are in­structed and trained to detect the following tell-tale DUI signs on a suspect who has been pulled over: 
 Odor of alcohol on driver's 
breath and clothes. e Watery or blood-spot eyes. 
e Slurred and unsteady speech patterns. 
 Unsteadiness in producing driving liCense and registration. 
e Unsteadiness in stepping out of the car. 
 Difficulty in looking straight at the officer. 
e Driver is hastily lighting up a cigarette or ingesting a chewing gum immediately after being stop­ped. 
 Difficulty in standing straight. Shivering or shaky ha1,1ds. 
To further confirm his suspi­cions, the officer has the right to order the driver to perform a sobriety or field test on the spot. 
If the driver does not perform satisfactorily on this test, the of­ficer will offer him two options under the implied consent law: to accept taking a breathalyzer test or to refuse one. 
If the driver accepts, he will be 
taken to the South Bend county jail 
on Main Street to be tested. If he 
fails the test, he will be arrested. if 
he passes it, he will have the right to 
lodge a complaint against the ar­
resting officer or even file a law 
suit. 
Refusal to take the breathalyzer test results in immediate arrest and more severe consequences than ac­cepting and failing it. Breathalyzer .-quipment is high-tech and .3 98 percent accurate. 
Medical aspects of drinking 
A popular myth is that an ex­
perienced drinker will have to drink 
more to hit a 0.10 BAC as com­
pared to a tee-totaler in the same 
time period. This is a fallacy. The 
subject here is tolerance. An ex­
perienced drinker's body would 
have "gotten used" to the effects of 
alcohol over a period of time. This 
person is then said to have a high 
tolerance for alcohol, which means 
that his body will no longer sense 
the alcohol's presence as well as 
before. However, the alcohol con­
tent is still there, and thus he'll be 
just as drunk as before even though 
he may not detect it. A breathalyzer 
test will. 
Tolerance, then, is a measure of 
how well the body will accept 
alcohol. It is not a measure of how 
well the body can fight off its ef­
fects. A seasoned drinker who has 
had six straight Martinis will be ex­
actly as biologically drunk as a 
non-drinker who has had the same 

Students speak of their experiences with alcohol 
P.A.CIMINO 
features writer 

For almost two years now, Notre Dame has possessed a rigid alcohol policy which many students claim has stifled social life, and forced students to have other ways to have fun. 
The committee recommending the policy also suggested programs to educate students about what alcohol can do to their lives if the drug is not handled reponsibly. This week, active and campus-wide education has .begun, with Alcohol Awareness Week. It exemplifies the beginning of efforts to get students interested in finding out about alcohol. 
This effort is being made by Notre Dame students; specifically the student government Alcohoi Concerns Commission, the Student Activities Board, and the Aroudn the Corner Club. Part of the novel­ty of the program is that during discussion sessions, students who have had experience with alcoholism have been able to talk with students on their own level in a relaxed, person-to-person manner. One such person is a former alcoholic named Kristen. 
Kristen was introduced to 
alcohol, she said, at a young age. 
"My parents owned a bar and I 
started drinking at around 11 or 12 
(years old)," she said. "It gave me a 
chance to emulate older people and 
feel grown up. I thought I was cool 
and I drank in a secretive way." 
Kristen continued to drink and 
had experiences with drugs until 
she realized that she was no longer well and had lost control of her life. "I was feeling so confused. I did not know how I felt physically and I ultimately scared myself into action when I found myself party­ing alone for days," she said. 

Then she admitted herself into a detoxification hospital, and since kicking alcoholism Kristen said she has been fine. "I now feel physical­ly great, it's wonderful," she said. 
While at the detox center, she was counseled on alcoholism and learned how to fight it and live a normal life. Now she is extremely · glad to see that she can be of help to others, she said. 
At Saint Mary's, alcohol educa­
tion is well under way. The College 
has classes for students to take con­
cerning the drug and also have a 
''We want to speed up the process so they can get help as early as possible.'' 
Kristen 
very successful awareness week. "Students there are very m­terested and Notre Dame's alcohol was a wonderful <>rrnn,n), 

amount. The only difference is that he would not feel the effects as vividly as the non-drinker . 
Another popular belief is that food will lessen alcohol's intox­icating effects. Not true. Food will only slow down, not decrease, the intoxicating process. 
Cold showers and hot coffee have always been praised for their fast curing powers over drunken­ness. However, only time will sober a drunk up, nothing else. 
The major body mechanism that gets rid of alcohol is the liver. The fastest rate that the liver can break down and excrete alcohol is 0.015 
percent of the BAC per hour. That rate is equivalent to half a beer per hour. So even if you drank only one beer every hour, you BCAC will build up faster than your liver can dispose of it. 
So tben  
Now that you know the facts, 
consequences and statistics, there is 
no excuse for getting arrested for 
DUI. 
Having a drink is not wrong. 
Even having one drink too many is 
not a crime. But driving after 
drinking is a crime punishable 
under the laws of Indiana. Besides, 
not doing it saves lives.

Perseverance WIDS out 
Kempton overcomes obstacles 
By NICK SCHRANTZ 
Sports Writer 
Centers throughout college basketball are breathing a sigh of relief as Notre Dame center Tim Kempton approaches the end of his career. 
Players such as Jack Haley of UCLA, Tom Copa of Marquette, and Ed Young of Dayton have gone head to head with Kemp­ton several times, and each time they have come away bettered and bruised. The Irish center plays a physical brand of basketball which intimidates opposing players but often goes unnoticed by students and fans. 
Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps is one per­son who will miss Kempton's presence next year and knows his true value to the team. 
"Tim Kempton does a lot of things for this team that go unnoticed," Phelps stated. "He sets screens, makes good passes, gets good position for rebounds, and plays fine post defense. 
"I thought Tim would have a pretty good year, and he really showed what he can do against Dayton and UCLA. When he plays with concentration and intensity he plays as well as anyone on the team." 
It's the little things Kempton has done this year that many fans haven't noticed. Kemp­ton showed his passing ability by placing se­cond on the team with 61 assists. Also, he shot 55 percent from the floor and 74 percent from the line to demonstrate his consistent shooting touch. 
While Kempton's point totals aren't overly impressive, his important role on the team. was recognized at the team's banquet Mon­day night when he was named the Role Player of the Year. And though he is ex­pected to play good defense and grab re­bounds, Kempton also has had several games in which he was noticed because he scored plenty of points. 
Kempton scored eight points and grabbed II rebounds in an overtime loss to BYU in January. Several days later he got the Irish back on the winning track by pouring in 20 points and getting 10 rebounds in a big vic­tory over UCLA. 
The Bayville, N.Y., native played well after that, especially in games against NCAA Tournament-bound Utah and highly-ranked Syracuse. He saved the best for last by mak­ing 14 marks in both the points and rebounds columns in a 69-55 win over Dayton in the home finale. 
Kempton agreed with his coach concerning his style of play that shows up only in the standings, not in the statistics. 
"People notice the scorers, but I try to be a role player that contributes to the team in other ways," Kempton explained. "Reboun­ding both offensively and defensively helps the team because we need the ball to start the break, and to keep the other team from scor­ing easy baskets inside on second shots. I try to play good defense, and I also handle the ball in pressure against a press or half-court traps." 
Kempton has enjoyed a senior year in which he has played well and the fans finally have appreciated his efforts. However, this was not always the case, as injuries during his sophomore and junior years hampered his play and caused the fans to turn against him. 
"I had a stress fracture in my lower left leg as a sophomore, and then one in my lower right leg as a junior," Kempton stated. "Sometimes I could only practice for 20-25 minutes, or not at all, so my timing was off. It was sore, and at times I couldn't play. 
"My experience with the fans has really helped me mature, but it was disheartening at times. It made me a better person, and it showed me how to deal with adversity and pressure. I was trying to do my best, but I think some of the fans were as frustrated as the athletes because Notre Dame sports were in a down time." 
Phelps knew that Kempton was hurting, but many of the fans seemed to forget his in­juries. 
"In his sophomore and junior years he was bothered by the stress fractures, and then he did some things that were negatives," Phelps explained. "I feel that some people were un­fair to him, but I think he handled it with class and poise." 
Though Kempton's scoring averages have dropped since his freshman and sophomore years, when he poured in over 10 points per game, the Irish have improved each year. 
Notre Dame lost in the first round of the NIT during Kempton's freshman year, and then was runner-up in the same tournament

Chuck's guide to 
the tournament 

Chuck Freeby 
Irish Items 
Hello again, everybody! 
"March Madness is ready to begin again. 
While the chosen few has become the chosen slew of 64 teams, the NCAA tournament still remains one of the most exciting and un­predictable events in sports. Few games, if any, can be considered easy, and there is certainly no clear-cut favorite this season. 
One thing is for sure, however. Notre Dame will play Arkansas­Little Rock at 10:37 p.m. Friday in Minneapolis, and that's all that really matters to most Irish fans. Still, there's plenty of details fans should know, so we're devoting this column to being a Notre Dame fan's guide to the NCAA Tournament. 
If you're going to Minneapolis . it's likely that you'll want to drive. Air fares are a little expensive to the Twin Cities, and with spring break only two weeks away, everybody is counting their 
money. 
The drive is only about nine hours, although weather is somewhat unpredictable this time of year. Take the Toll Road to 1-90-94 in Chicago. Follow I-90 through Rockford, Ill., to Madison, Wis. At that point, get back on 1-94, which goes right into Minneapolis. Signs will tell you how to get to the Metrodome, but the 5th Street exit is your best bet. 
The next thing you need are tickets, and they can be purchased ahead of time. Ticket packages are $36 and $45 and can be pur­chased on your credit card by calling the Metrodome ticket office at (612) 333-5577. Don't be surprised if things don't run too smoothly. The Metrodome has hosted only one other basketball game before, and that was when the 1984 Olympic team played a group of NBA all-stars prior to the Olympics. Therefore, it could be a learning experience for all concerned. 
Looking for things to do in Minneapolis? Well, the Chamber of Commerce was happy to tell me that Andy Williams has two shows nightly at the Carlton Celebrity Room through Friday night. However, if you think Andy might be· a bit much for you, the popular musical "A Chorus Line" is playing in town. 
Of course, many students will be looking for the hot night spots. Suggested hangouts are Saturday Night Jukebox, a local sports bar that plays a lot of music from the '50s and '60s; the popular Seven Corners area, which is across the interstate from the Dome and full of good bars; or First Avenue, which was featured in the movie, "Purple Rain." Say hello to my good friend, Prince, while you're there. 
One other word of advice. It's not necessary to remind people in Minnesota that Lou Holtz is the new football coach at Notre Dame. They already are aware of that fact, and thry really don't like hearing about it too much. 
If you're not going to Minneapolis .. you will be able to see the first-round game on TV. WNDU-TV (Channell6) will televise the contest, even though that means "Miami Vice" will be pre-empted. 
Should the Irish get past Arkansas-Little Rock, CBS holds the rights to the second-round games. It's a good bet that the local CBS affiliate, WSBT-TV (Channel 22) will be showing the Irish game as CBS tries to show different games to different areas of the country. 
What to watch for in the tournament . 
1) Fewer upsets. The presence of a 45-second clock isn't going to allow a lesser team to just bleed the clock. Therefore, while there may be some surprises, don't look for any of the top four seeds in the region to lose in the first round. 
2) Loosely-officiated games. Officials tend to hesitate to blow the whistle a little during the tournament because they don't want to lose the game for a team. This could be an advantage for te~s from the Big East and the Big Ten. which are used to the poundmg_ underneath. lt also should benefit Notre Dame, which hkes to play a physical game, too. 
3) At least one team with seven losses or more will reach the Final Four. This really doesn't require much of a crystal ball. Of the 64 teams in the tournament, 37 have seven losses or more. That is par­tially a display of the parity that is found in NCAA basketball these days and partially because there are so many dog teams from bad conferences getting automatic berths. 
Hopefully, all of this information will help you enjoy the tourna­ment a little more. So sit back, root for the Irish and let's see if Digger does Dallas.

the following year. Last year the Irish advanced to the seeond round of the NCAA Tournament before losing by a point to North Carolina. 
Kempton has improved over his career, but he sees his progress in relation to the progress of the team. 
"I feel I've matured as a player, but I see improvement in a team respect," Kempton stated. ''We've had four great classes, and now we're peaking for the tournament. I recognize basketball in a more goal-oriented, team capacity now. 
"As an individual, I understand the game more now. From the statistics I know it's hard to see the progres­sion, but I feel more confident in my whole game because I know more aspects of the game, instead of just one or two." 
While the Irish have been good for several years, this is the first time they have had all the pieces in place for a bid at the national champion­ship. 
"This team has a specialness and family character that make the dif­ference betwt;en good teams and great teams," Kempton explained. "We've recruited some super guys in the last four years, and everybody gets along because there are no egos or selfish players. 
"From the coaches to the players to the managers, we all know our roles and what it takes to be a great team so we can accomplish our goals." 
Despite the problems with injuries and the fans, Kempton looks back fondly on his years here as gradua­tion approaches. 
"I'm definitely happy I came here," he stated. "The decision was between here and Duke, and I have no regrets at all. It's a super situa­tion, and I've met a lot of nice peo­ple. 
"It hasn't always been perfect, but neither is life," Kempton con­

Not just a tournament 
Notre Dame sees impact of making NCAAs in its non-athletic areas 

ment. Last year, for example, NCAA­champion Villanova reported about a 15­percent increase in the number of applica­tions received. 
While the Notre Dame admissions depart­ment does not expect such an increase because the University already enjoys a great deal of exposure, Valdiserri recalls an effect on admissions at Saint Mary's College a few years ago because of tournament play. 
"I remember about five or six years back when we had a very good team in the tourna­ment," he says. "The announcers would oc­casionally mention Notre Dame/Saint Mary's. We heard from the staff at Saint Mary's that the number of applications in­creased for the next year. When the team does well, everyone benefits." 
Notre Dame women's head basketball coach Mary DiStanislao sees the team's success in the tournament as an opportunity to strengthen all University programs. 
"Being in the NCAAs definitely helps," she says. "We can point to other programs and say, 'This is the success that can be had.' Sure it helps women's basketball, but we're talk­ing about something much larger. Every department in the University takes pride when one of our teams succeeds." 
One department that has its hands full dur­ing tournament time is the Sports Informa­tion Department. Putting releases together, scheduling interviews and distributing infor­mation is a large job to tackle in the few days between the tournament selection and tomorrow night's opening game for the Irish. 
"It's definitely a hectic period for us," says Notre Dame associate sports information director John Heisler. "The biggest problem is that we are restricted on time. We have to try to get to as many people as we can in the time we have. There are a lot of people who 
want  to  know  about  the  team,  ticket  
availability,  interviews  and  various  other  
things."  

So while the team is busy practicing, review­ing game films and discussing strategies, the behind-the-scenes people are working diligently to try to keep pace with this busy period. Success does not come easily. 
One thing is for sure, however. You won't hear anyone complaining. 
here, and I think he11 do well in the 
NCAAs."

The dreams of Duck and Digger were shattered, however, as Williams' shot rimmed out and Duke's John Harrell came away
3-2in NCAA 
with the loose ball. Harrell then canned two free throws to forge the 90-86 final score. Notre Dame would not get to the final game, but it had gone to its first-ever Final Four. Duke proceeded to fall to Kentucky, 94-88, in the championship game. 
Actually, Notre Dame, which had reached the Final Four with vic­tories over Houston, Utah and DePaul, had no right to harbor any dreams. After all, Duke was the team led by Tinkerbell. Gene "Tinkerbell" Banks, a silky-smooth freshman who today displays his talents in the NBA, canned 22 points and used his magic to keep the Blue Devils in control when the Irish rallied in the second half. Also sparking Head Coach Bill Foster's Duke squad was guard Jim Spanarkel (20 points) and center Mike Gminski (29 points). 
The Irish were keyed by a balanced scoring attack that included 16 points from Williams, 11 from Tracy Jackson and 10 apiece from big men Bruce Flowers and Dave Batton. In addition to their con­tributions, Phelps got clutch performances from Bill Laimbeer (seven points, 10 rebounds) and from a freshman by the name of Kelly Tripucka, who added 12 points and hauled down nine re­bounds. Guards Rich Branning and Bill Hanzlik, meanwhile, kick­ed in eight points each. 
Although Notre Dame's dream had ended on the hardwood of the Checkerdome, that team still had helped to write a new chapter in Irish basketball history. And their dream was one that kept a lot of fans wide awake with excitement in 1978.

Fans may remember last seeing Kiel toss the pigskin brietly for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. An 11th­round draft choice, Kiel did show some promise for the Dues, but was cut in 1985 after suffering a relapse: ofCrohn's disease.

Stevenson returns to site of last victory 
~dPrcss 
GLENDALE, Calif. -Jan Stephen­son, returning to the site ofher most recent LPGA victory, tackles what may be the toughest course on the tour in the 1250,000 GNA-Glendale Federal Classic beginning today. 
Stephenson won the tournament 
last year with a 72-hole score of 290, 
2-over-par over the venerable Oak­
mont Country Club course. 
That was the highest winning score of any LPGA tournament last year, and the only eventwon with an over-par total. It also was the first women's tournament at Oakmont. 
Stephenson took the victory with cards of 70-73-72-75 over the par­72, 6,328-yard course that opened 60 years ago. There was only one round under 70 over the tree-lined course that severly punishes mistakes, a 69 carded by Vicki Fer­gon. 
Stephenson, predictably, likes Oakmont. 
"It's nice to come back to nice thoughts," she said. "The fairways are great, the greens are ideal for putting. I expect scores to be lower this year, and I think an experienced player will win because it's a very competitive course. 
Relay

tern, wno also will be running at Na­tionals. 
Notre Dame's relay is led off by McNelis. An 800-meter runner for most ofhis career, Nobles will try to position himself at the front of the pack. 
"I'll try to use my excitement to to give me more energy running," said McNelis on his strategy for this weekend. "There's always a chance of being too pumped. I'll just try to get out and lead without killing myself." 
He will hand the baton to Nobles. Previously a 600-yard runner, Nobles ran several impressive BOO­yard races last year to crack the two­mile relay lineup. 
"I try to move us into the lead if we are behind," said Nobles. "If McNelis finishes in front, then I try to open up a bigger lead." 
This strategy bodes well for Van Wie, the third runner. 
"I like running out in front," Van Wie said. "Rob just makes things easier for me." 
Finally Tyler runs the anchor leg. The former cross country co-captain thrives on the competition and strategy ofthe last few laps. 
"I feel 1 can run with any of the competition," he said. 
IRISH ITEMS-To understand the unbelievable ability of some of the athletes racing in Oklahoma City this weekend, Piane said that the qualifying standard for the mile relay was faster than the world record time on a 200 meter indoor track...Nick Sparks, who was a part of the relay that broke the outdoor record last year, has missed the entire season due to a foot injury.

Zoeller brings high hopes, injuries to defend title at Bay Hill Classic 
A88oclated PreM 
ORLANDO, Fla. · Fuzzy Zoeller, who capped his comeback with a victory in this event a year ago, has some high hopes and a tender back as he opens defense ofhis title in the S<;OO,OOO Hertz-Bay Hill Classic. 
"I'm still learning aboUl it, still learning to Jive with it," he said of the back problems that, a year ago, threatened to end his career. 
"There's some scar tissue problems and, later on, there'll probably be some arthritis," Zoeller said before a practice round on Ar· nold Palmer's Bay Hill Club course. 
Zoeller, however, was optimistic about his chances in the chase for a J90,000 first prize here, as well as for the rest ofthe year. 
"It really helps, makes the year a lot easier, when you get off to a good, fast start," said Zoeller, a former Masters and U.S. Open cham­pion who won at Pebble Beach early this season. 
"You look at your list of(leading) money-winners. Almost all of them got off to a good start out West," Zoeller said. 
And, despite some nagging problems with the back, Fuzzy said he was optimistic about his chances in the tournament that begins today. 
"After winning here last year, I have a kind of special feeling about this tournament, this course," he said. "I have a pretty good record on this course (four finishes in the top 
I 0 in seven starts)." 
"I'm playing pretty well, hitting a lot ofgood shots. I was playing very well in Hawaii (before he was forced to withdraw). 
"And I played well last week (in the Dorai-Eastern Open). I just had · one nine-hole stretch that wasn't so good, so everybody is saying, 'Oh, you're playing bad again, huh?' 
''That's not it at all. I just wasn't making any short putts." 
Zoeller was not alone with his back problems. The tournament host, Arnold Palmer, also was having some difficulties. He said he was "not 100 percent" but would be among the invitational starting field of 114.

Southeast has eight teams on win streak 
BATON ROUGE, La.,-It's an excit­ing prospect for everyone, said Louisiana State University coach Dale Brown. Each ofthe eight teams here is just a six-game winning streak from the peak of college bas­ketball. 
"lbat's really not a lot of games," said Brown, who knows as well as anyone the difference between regular-season victories and tourna­ment victories. His team snapped a 10-game post-season losing streak this year in the Southeastern Confer­ence tournament -a streak dating back to the Final Four in Philadel­phia in 1981. 
Brown is one of three coaches in 
this portion of the NCAA tourna­
ment's first round who has taken a 
team to the Final Four. 
Rollie Massimino led Villanova to 
the national championship last year, 
beating Dana Kirk's Memphis State 
in the opening round of the Final 
Four. 
. It's the seventh straight cham­pionship tournament for Villanova, the fourth straight for Memphis State and Purdue, three in a row for LSU, and two in a row for Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech. 
At the other end ofthe experience 
spectrum is Marist, enrollment 
2,700, making its first NCAA tourna­
ment appearance ever, and Ball 
State, which made its only NCAA 
playoff appearance in 1981. 
Marist, the smallest school in the 
opening rounds of the Southeast 
Regional here, has the most cos­
mopolitan roster: 7-foot-3 Rik Smits 
of Eindhovan, Holland; 7-0 Rudy 
Bourgarel of Abymes, Guadeloupe; 
6-11 Miroslav Pecarski of Nova Sad, 
Yugoslavia; 6-7 Peter Krasovec of 
Budapest, Hungary, and 6-6 Alain 
Forestier ofParis. 

"We just capitalized on our assis­tant coaches having played and coached professionally in Europe," said Marist coach Matt Furjanic. "We've gotten something from Europe we can't get here -the players above 6-8." 
Marist, 19-11, meets Georgia Tech, 25-6, at 12:07 p.m. (Central) in the opener of a four-game first round. Georgia Tech wound up the regular season ranked No.6. 
Virginia Tech, 22-8, meets Vil­lanova, 22-13, at 2:37 p.m. in the second game of the afternoon ses­sion. 
Memphis State, 27-5 and ranked No.12, meets Ball State, 21-9, in the openinggame ofThursday's evening session at 7:07p.m., and Purdue, 21­7, meets LSU, 22-11, in the finale at 9:37p.m. 

Purdue coach Gene Keady won­dered what he had done to offend the NCAA computers that decide which team is playing where. "Two years ago, we had to go to Memphis State. That's fine to do it once, but I think once every 1 0 years is enough to go and play on somebody's home court," he said. 
Hrown said he sympathizes, but knows of only one way to make it truly fair: "play it on a neutral court ­Saturn." 
Each of the 64 teams in the playoffs gets S167,000 just for making it that far. The 16 that lose in the second round earn S334,000, and the eight that leave after the round of 16 take home S500,000 per team. The four losers in the Final Eight take home S668,000, and each team in the Final Four makes S835,000. 

Each participating team is re­quired to by 250 tickets for the opening rounds of the regional tournaments. Memphis State asked foe another 1,750 books of tickets, and Villanova for a minimum of 750 more.

Notre Dame baseball takes on big challenges 

ByJOHN COYLE 
Sports Writer 
No one can ever accuse Larry Gallo of taking the easy way out. As head coach of the Notre Dame baseball team, he schedules some of the top baseball schools in the na­tion, despite being at a recruitirtg disadvantage. 
Baseball is not considered to be a major sport at Notre Dame. The Irish home games do not draw large crowds, and there is not a great

amount of money put aside for baseball scholarships. Combined
quarter of a game against the Chicago Bulls at the 
with the weather patterns in South 
Pontiac Silverdome. 
Bend, these conditions make it dif­ficult for Gallo to draw some of the 
top prospects. 
"We have to work with what we 

have, not what it could be," said 
Gallo. "When I recruit, I tell the 
players don't come here to play 
baseball, come here to be a student 
and then you can play baseball." 
Gallo takes a much different view 

ofbaseball at Notre Dame than most, 
and he is confident that he can at­
tract the kind oftalent that is capable 
ofplaying against top competition. 
"It might be a minor sport in the 

eye of the general public, but to us 
it's a major sport," said Gallo. "The 
players and I take baseball very 
seriously and believe we can com­
pete with anybody." 
Gallo believes firmly that hard 

work can make up for some of the 
talent inadequacies the Irish may 
have. The sixth year head coach 
stesses the fundamentals to make 
the most of the players' potential. 
Improvement through what he calls 
"looking beyond the next step" is his 
key philosophy. 
"You have to look past the next 

step," said Gallo. "You can't be con­
tent with where you are. It's better 
to strive ahead even if you fail, be­
cause you can learn even from 
failing. 
"The greatest reward I get from 

coaching is seeing the kido; improve. 
I try to encourage them and push 
them hard because most do not 
realize how far they can go and what 
they can attain." 
As if the level talent the Irish play 

is not enough, there is often an extra 
incentive for opposing teams to 
defeat them according to Gallo. 
"A lot ofpeople do not draw a line 

between the football and basketball 
teams and baseball. When they see 
those Fighting Irish uniforms they 
don't care whether the ball is white, 
brown or orange, they are out to 
beat Notre Dame." 
The Depauw Tigers will be out to 

defeat the Irish this weekend as 
Notre Dame travels to Greencastle 
for what they hope will be, weather 
permitting, a four game series. 
Gallo sees the series as an oppor­

tunity to try different players at dif­
ferent positions and to get a look at 
some more pitchers in game condi­
tions in preparation for some of the 
more important games coming later 
in the season. 
NFL decision doesn't affect network T.V. 
NEW YORK -The NFL's decision 

to use television replays as a limited 
officiating aid will not affect the way 
the networks telecast the games. 
That was the opinion of Terry O'Neil, the executive producer for NFL broadcasts at CBS; Chet Forte, who directs Monday Night Football for. ABC, and Ted Nathanson, the coordinating producer for NBC's pro football games. 
"Our own broadcast standards are 
more demanding than what the 
league has laid down In Its decision," 
said O'Neil, who was at the NFL 
meetings in Rancho Mirage, Calif., 
when the league decided to use 
replays on calls relating to posses­
sion and turnovers, to determine If a 
runner or receiver is in-bounds or 
has broken the plane ofthe goal line, 
and on forward and backward passes 
in the backfield. It also will be used 
on easily detectable infractions such 
as too many men on the field. 
"When there is a controversial play, we will continue to show it on replays to give the viewer the full picture. I don't foresee any dif­ference in how we cover the game because of it." 
The Observer Thursday, March 13, 1986 -page 18 
Bonny

400.425 and 413.7. She dove all her qualifying touls in eleven-dive meets. "It's easier to qualify with eleven dives," Bonny said. "You can blow a dive and still get the points. My goal this year was to qualify, but now I'd like to get into the finals of the regionals this weekend." 
In the competition, ap­proximately 40 divers will each do five dives, at which point the field will be cut to 32. The remaining divers will then finish their com­plete 11-dive program. The top eight finishers will re-do all 11 dives for placing purposes. 
Of those eight finalists, the top four in the low boards and the top six in the high boards will go on to Arkansas for the Championship. 
"11tere probably will be 2-6 divers there who will absolutely amazing," Bonny said. "They're the ones who try out for the Olympics or have dove under the very best diving coaches in the country. After them, it will be a dogpack. HI can get into the finals, I'U be very happy." 
Welsh praised Bonny for the season she had this year. 
"Her performance this year has been superior," he said. "She's re-set all our university records · low boards, high boards, dual-meets, you name it. She's had a really excel­lent year." 
Television 
continuedfrom page 20 
like we just went through. Our value would continue to deteriorate. Our ratings have gone down noticeably. 
"All ratings are down, but we are back in the pack now. The Notre Dame-Air Force football game was one of the lowest ratings game of the year, that is for all games televised on Saturdays last season. 
''People can buy spots cheap unless the ratings go up." 
So, what must Notre Dame do to keep one step ahead of the falling sports advertising demand? What is the key to Notre Dame's television future? 
Corrigan summed up the answer in a very consice, matter-of-fact formula. "Success and winning lead to higher ratings, and higher ratings lead to bigger money." 
Today, the average American may tune in to up to 10 basketball games on any given Saturday in the month of February. 
Advertisers are looking to other types of programming for their products, as Miller Brewing Co. spokesman Steve Forsyth was quoted as saying in the Feb. 24 issues of Sports Illustrated. 
"Sports programming used to be a bargain compared with prime time," said Forsyth. ''Now it's as expensive ·or more. We are using MTV, late-night shows like David Letterman and some comedy pro­gramming to reach our target au­dience." 
For these reasons, professional sports teams are likely not to find any contract raises from the net­works. Ultimately, this may lead to lower salaries for players. 
Major horse races, auto races, other post-season college football games such as the Peach and Fiesta Bowls and regular-season college football packages may fall by the wayside due to the commercial spots. 
Advertisers are simply not will­ing to pay the big bucks any more. A good example of the trend away from big time sports to other adver­tising avenues is witnessed by the car manufacturers. 
They have found that women are increasingly participating in the car b1.1ying decision, so car makers are targeting their ads for places other than televised sporting events.

Notre Dame relay at NCAA meet, pursues elusive all-American status 
By PETE GEGEN 
Sports Writer 

They knew they would be here. Ever since the two-mile relay team broke the school outdoor track record in that event last year, they set their sights on this milestone. 
Tomorrow Notre Dame's two­mile relay team will run in the NCAA Indoor Championships. Jim McNelis, Robert Nobles, jeff Van Wie, and Jim Tyler will run against the top ten relay teams in the nation for a shot at the title of all-America. 
"I told them that back in Septem­ber," said Piane, "(that) they are very talented, and their best marks showed that they were capable of making it." 
Tomorrow the team will run in one of two preliminary races. The top three from each heat, plus the next fastest time from either heat, will run in the finals on Saturday. The top six finishers in Saturday's race will be honored with the title of all-America. 
"All-America status is what we've worked on for four years," said Nobles of the importance of this race. 
The Irish qualified for Nationals at the Terrier Classic in Boston. Their time of 7:24.84 was presumed to be the best in the nation until word came of a race in which both Auburn 

John McNelis 

and Houston Baptist ran under 7:23. Both teams will be present at tomor­row's race, as will Penn State, which many consider the team to beat. 
Piane said that it took spectacular individual performances for several of the teams to qualify. His team, however, ha5 been a model of con­sistency over the season. For ex­ample, at the Terrier Classic the splits for each runner were all within a one second spread. 
"They had a workman-like perfor­mance at Boston," he said. "No one ran out of their minds, in fact only Tyler set a personal mark in that race. 
"They did what they needed to do to get here, but their times were not close to their personal bests. They are capable of running better, and hopefully they'll do it this weekend." 
The two-mile relay ran twice prior to qualifying in Boston. At the Western Michigan relays, the foursome captured first, but their time of 7:29.8 was two seconds short ofthe qualifying standard. 
They recorded the exact same time at the lllini Classic, despite McNelis' fall on the first lap. The spill cost the team four seconds and a second place finish to Northwes­

Notre Dame football telecasts cut, follows trend of decreased revenue 
By KEVIN HERBERT 
Sports Writer 

Due to the rapid expansion of cable TV and court rulings leading to decentralization of college sports telecasts, the days of only one or two games a day are seemingly gone forever. 
Notre Dame has already felt the effects of the fall in demand. For the first time in 15 years, delayed replays of Notre Dame football games will not air on television. 
TCS, a company which owned the right to these games, decided not to prepare the replays because no market exists for them. 
A glut of sports of television to­day and new advertising alter­natives like MTV have caused the advertising demand for sports events to fall considerably. 
"Sure Notre Dame has felt the ef­fects, everyone has," said Notre Dame athletic director Gene Cor­rigan. "The value of our syndicated basketball and football games is decisively lower than a few years ago. 
"There is not much that we can do about it. One option we have is to not televise at all. We could do this to try to create a great demand for our product. 
"However, everyone else will continue to broadcast, and if our teams do not win, then the demand may not rise enough for our plan to work. 
"Notre Dame sports is still desirable," he continued. "Our basketball season really helped. In 
the  right  situation  we  still  have  
good ratings."  
Notre  Dame has  its  onw  syn­ 

dicated network, TEN, through which the Irish consistently reach the public. 
"Peripherally and superficially we are syndicated with Syracuse, Pittsburgh and Boston College, but we are probably better off by ourselves," said Corrigan. 
"This year and next year we gave the networks all they could stomach. They telecasted 10 foot­ball games in 1985 and are planning to show 10 more in 1986. After next year, we are going to review the marketplace and plan accordingly. 
"We may decide not to televise anymore, to televise less or to keep the same pace. The decision will be based upon the pulse of the market and the results from the past couple of years. 
"Traditionally, Notre Dame has the highest ratings in college foot­ball. In fact, Notre Dame holds the mark for the highest single regular season game ratings in both basket­ball and football." 
The 1974 Notre Dame vs. UCLA basketball game and the Notre Dame vs. USC football game in teh early 1 970s hold the regular season record game ratings in their respec­tive sports. 
"These last five years were really bad for us," said Corrigaq. "We do not need to have five more years

Irish diver goes home to be in NCAA meet 
By KATHLEEN McKERNAN

Andrea Bonny is going home this weekend, but she won't be taking an early vacation. Notre Dame's top diver will test the waters in the NCAA Diving Regionals starting tomorrow in her hometown of Columbus, Ohio. 
"I'm so excited," Bonny said. "My older sister is flying in for the com­petition. A lot of people I know are going to be there. I'm really excited and really nervous." 
The butterflies are understan­dable, notwithstanding the site of the competition. Neither Bonny nor Irish head coach Tim Welsh has ever been to this type of meet. For that reason, Welsh hesitates to assess Bonny's chances .. 
"We don't know what will hap-; pen," Welsh said. This is a new ex­perience for both of us. The competition is very elite, however. All the Big 10 divers will be there." 
In order to qualify for the meet, a diver must compile a certain amount of point totals. On the one­meter board, a diver needed to score 240 points in a six-dive and 390 points in an eleven-dive meet; for the three-meter dives, the point to­tals increase to 250 and 410, respectively. 
Bonny first qualified for the zone meet jan. 25 at Fordham with scores of 391.27 and 436.57 which, at the time, were school records. Bonny since re-set and re-qualified against Oral Roberts, with point totals of

ND's "other" Tournament team faces big test 
How's this for a prediction? In a post-season tourna­ment final game on March 22, Notre Dame and Duke will tip-off against each other. 
Just another one of the thousand predictions you've heard this week about the men's NCAA tournament, right? Another example of somebody who all season long couldn't tell the difference between David Rivers and St. Joseph's river now getting in the act with an emphatic and confident call, right? 
Well, wait. Don't go throwing your money down the drain of your neighbor's betting pool yet. I'm talking about the other post-season tournament in which Notre Dame is involved. It may pale in comparison to the party they're throwing in Minneapolis tonight, but the National Women's Invitational Tournament is getting set for a bash of its own beginning next week. 
And this tournament, held ~arch 20-22 in Amarillo, Texas, means as much if not more to the Notre Dame women's basketball program as the annual NCAA free­for-all means to Digger Phelps' team. 
"I think it's good to get some experience playing post­season basketball. That's the big thing," said Irish head coach Mary DiStanislao, whose team will be seeded No. l in the tournament. ''You know, there are a few programs in the NCAA tournament now that got their start winn­ing the NWIT. And a real immediate example is the (Notre Dame) men's team going to the NIT finals two years ago. They built upon that, and by the next year they were an NCAA tournament team." 
A rise to the elite echelon of basketball powerhouses certainly has been the ambition for the Notre Dame women's program ever since it was conceived nine years ago. The team has developed steadily since then, finishing 21-7 this season and winning the undersized North Star Conference championship for the second con­secutive season.

But over the past two seasons the Irish have been snub­bed by the NCAA when it came to handing out invita­tions to its post-season competition. The only difference this year is that the NWIT, a less-publicized tournament similar to the current NIT in the men's division, offered Notre Dame a chance to participate. 
Although the folks in Amarillo apparently feel this competition is top-notch -a parade and several other town festivals are planned -the tournament itself is, at least financially, on a plane below their NCAA counter­part. In fact, all expenses for Notre Dame's trip reported­ly will have to come from the Notre Dame budget. This fact, however, did not faze the administration when it got the call from the NWIT committee. 
"The administration is very much behind the decision to go," said Assistant Athletic Director Brian Boulac. "The indication was that the team members wanted to go and we felt that, as far as the program goes, it would be good for development and getting respect. The women's tourney does not make much money, but it gives our team a chance to compete in post-season competition. And that was our final objective." 
For the Notre Dame women's basketball program, which has already had a great deal of money soaked into its development, the NWIT is certainly a big deal. 
As for the opening prediction, top-seeded Notre Dame might very well find itself up against rival Duke. Although the Irish must first get past U.S. International next Thursday, and then the winner of the Fresno State -Idaho contest, the Lady Blue Devils are seeded No. 2 in the other bracket and are expected to make the cham­pionship round.

Speaking of golden opportumues, a former Notre Dame quarterback will be fighting for one last shot in the NFL this summer. Blair Kiel, the 1983 graduate who had a promising but often stormy and unfulfilled career for the Irish, recently signed on with the Indianapolis Colts.
