Cubans fight in Angola 
LUSAKA, Zambia--Cuban troops with the Soviet-backed Popular Front MPLA in Angola's civil war are playing an ever greater part in the command and fighting, a report from the embattled west African country said yesterday. 
Another report quoted National Union UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi saying his pro-Western faction is preparing fallback positions as part of a west-east defense line across the middle of Angola. This would be to block the MPLA's southward drive toward the trans-Angola highway.

Blood drive scheduled 
by BID Stejskal Staff Reporter 
After a successful effort last semester, the St. Joseph County Red Cross, working through stu­dent coordinators from N.D., is planning to hold another campus blood drive. The drive will run from Jan.27 through April 29, with thirty-four days scheduled for the halls to donate blood. 
The drive will be conducted in the same manner that was initiated last semester. Student represent­atives will canvas the members of their halls, drumming up volunteers and arranging the donor schedules. 
On the assigned days, a Red Cross Blood Services team will be set up in the campus infirmary to handle the student donors.

Mock convention '76 gets underway 
The 1976 Mock Political Conven­tion Campaigns for the office of President get under way today January 26 at 11 :30 a.m. with the opening of Campaign Central in the main floor of the LaFortune Stu­dent Center. 
The purpose of Campaign Cen­tral is to offer the ND-SMC community in general and the convention delegates in particular the opportunity to find out more about the Presidential candidates. The focal point of the campus campaign will be the issues. All student representatives have re­ceived campaign literature political issue fact sheets from their respect­ive national headquarters and their items will be available for study by the general public. 
On February 2, ''Candidates at a Glance" will begin its display. This display consists of a large chart presenting each candidate and his stand on 12 major issues. This format will allow one to quickly compare and contrast the candidates and will serve as a catalyst for thought which will hopefully move interested people to further involvement and support of one particular candidate. A quick look at campus campaigns finds us with: 
Senator Birch Bayh--Recently, Bayh has brought himself into serious contention by winning labor support in New England and liberal support in New York. The Indiana Senator, known most for his fight against the Carswell and Hayns­worth Supreme Court nominations by Richard Nixon and as the principal participant in drafting the 25th and 26th amendments. Re­cently he finished second in the Iowa caucus. Presenting Senator Bayh's stand on the issues to the campus is Wendell Walsh. a junior government major from South Bend. He and his campaign team welcome the questions, support, and help of all interested; the phone number is 234-0741. 
Senator Lloyd Bentsen·-The 
Texas Senator seems to be content 
with occupying the middle ground 
on the ideological continuum for 
this year's race. His strategy is to 
be the compromise candidate after 
the front runners fade. He has 
shown great concern for domestic 
affairs, introducing a bill to 
encourage investment and opting 
for a gasoline tax to conserve 
energy. The Notre Dame Bentsen 
for '76 Committee is forming 
around the efforts of Mark Till, 
Tom Adolph and Pascal Piazza. 
These gentlemen from Houston, 
Texas, are eager to get underway 
with the proceedings and welcome 
questions and assistance from all 
interested parties. Contact 283­

P. 0. Box Q 
Man of Integrity 
Dear Sir: 
This letter is prompted by The Observer article pertaining to Professor Charles Rice of the Law School and comments reported concerning his recent Torts exam­ination. 
I do not speak as a 'defender' of Professor Rice. He is more than capable of defending himself, if such be necessary. I speak because I believe an unjustice is being done to someone I know very well and admire even more. 
One of the premier law teachers in this country, Professor Rice is a man of exceptional ability and uncommon courage. Moreover, he has an abundance of something that is always in short supply--inte­grity. He is, most assuredly, not "a reed swaying in the wind." 
It is reported that there were some twenty failures on the Torts examination. What is the teacher to do when confronted by a performance that does not meet his standards? Pretend that it does? In a school dedicated to the pursuit of justice that would be the worst kind of mockery. 
I have been informed of collect­ive efforts, including among other things a direct appeal to the President of the University, to force a change in the grades. One may be certain that Professor Rice will not be intimidated by these or any other improper pressures. He is professionally responsible. Such efforts would be better directed toward seeking his counsel and advice as to how the deficiencies mi~ht be corrected_. 
Edward J. Murphy Thomas J. White Professor of Law 
One of the Best 
Dear Editor: 
First of all I would like to state that 1 know of no fairer or more ethical a man than Dr. Rice. If there is one professor in the law school that would be most willing to listen to your problems or to help you out, it would be Dr. Rice. 
I have had Dr. Rice for three courses. He is a demanding instructor, but there is a reason for this. He realizes that in order for a law student to become a lawyer he must pass a very difficult bar exam. Unless a student applies himself diligently Ito his courses in law school, he won't pass the bar. 
Dr, Rice's tests have always been very difficult, but never unfair. I always had the feeling that if heally worked in Dr. Rice's courses, I would do okay. 
Dr, Rice is a teacher both in and out of the classroom. His impec­cable personal life is a good example that I'm sure has inspired many a future lawyer's life ­including my own. He is one of the few professors who treats the students as equals and is willing to sacrifice a great deal of his own spare time to help the students. 
I just wanted it known that not all of the students in the law school share the views of those who were interviewed in Wednesday's paper -some of us think that Dr. Rice is the best professor in the whole law school. 
Bob Mohan 
Reflects On Prof 
Dear Editor: 
In the article "Law Professor Counters Charges" in the January 22 edition of The . Observer. there was made the implications that those who received poor grades in Torts could not adapt to the heavy workload in law school. 
I, as a student who received a "D" in Tort, strongly disagree with that implication. I can handle the work load and my grades give evidence of that. I will not be bothered with the grade of D in tort. When my other grades are compared with the D grade and in the light of the fact that there were 52 (!)

Don't Count St. Mary's 
Dear Editor: 
Your article "Admission Policy Reviewed" was good because the question of the quota for women was brought up. I've been wonder­ing for years how many women will finally be established at N.D. 
There was a particularly interest­ing point though. Sister Miriam Jones stated that "a student body composed of 40 percent women ... ( as in most co-ed universities) would mean we would have 3,000 women. .. should we balance the number of women with that of St. Mary's?" 
I hate to sound unconcerned, but what does the number of women at St. Mary's have to do with the number of women admit­ted to N.D.? I should think the admission of an individual to N.D. should be totally independent of the number of persons attending another institution! 
If other institutions manage to get along with a 60-40 ratio, N.D. should be able to do so also. 
Sister Jones and Admissions Committee: Please don't set a quota dependent upon the number of women at St. Mary's.

Casey came into the room and threw his books down on his desk. "Whew! I just got back from town. Those Right-to-Life people .... " He looked up and saw Obie lying on the top bunk with his long legs propped against the ceiling and his hands resting curiously on his stomach. With his undershirt pulled up half-way, Obie was making a bridge over his navel with his index fingers. He seemed oblivious to Casey's presence. 
"Those people," Casey went on, "they're out there with their placards and armbands. Pro-Life ... ,"Casey humpffed. "I couldn't believe this one sign. It was red, white, and blue, with a Revolutionary soldier and a big 1776, and said:'Protect our Unborn Patriots'. Patriots! Fetuses aren't even people! 
Obie gave no response, but continued to concentrate on the bridge over his navel. Casey came over and looked at Obie's bridge. 
"What's up, Obe?" 
"Oh, I was just thinking." 
"I guess!" Casey laughed. "What about?" 
"About when I was a kid .... " 
"Yeah? How old?" 
"Oh, about two or three." 
"Hey, you can remember back that far? TWO years old?" 
"Months." 
"Huh!" Casey sniffed and took a quick look around the room. "Man, are you high?" 
"I'm serious!" Obie said. 
"So am I!" 
"Case', you know I don't do that .... " 
"Well, then, what are you talking about.. two months! Nobody can remember that soon after being born." "I mean before I was born, Casey. I mean two months in the womb!" "Give me a break!" Casey roared. "Hardly a week into the semester and you've flipped out already. Be real!" Obie sat up slowly, calmly. His face grew very sober. "Case'," O'Brien raised one eyebrow,"want to hear about it?" "Get out of here." Then Casey smiled. "Sure," he mocked, "tell me all about your intra-womb experience!" 
"What do you want to know?" 
"What the hell do you mean, what do I want to know? How should I know what I want to know? I've never been inside a womb before ... " Casey felt stupid. "I mean, that I can remember." 
"Well," O'Brien said, "I can. Every detail. It was super!" 
"Like heaven," Casey was sarcastic. 
"Almost"O'Brien continued, "Nice and warm. Really comfort­able. A little dark,though. Couldn't read at all." "Read!" "Well, it was either read or sleep. After all, no one was around to talk to .... " 
"And you couldn't ... read?" 
"Not for a while. My baby blues weren't developed until the third month .. and even then they weren't open." "That's too bad." "Yeah,but after being an English major for three semesters, 
really don't think I missed all that; much." 
Casey unwrapped a Mars Bar and munched slowly, obviously 
now interested. "Hey, Obe," he made smacking sounds, "how 
about your stomach? When did you get that?" 
"I guess around the eighth week .. I woke up one morning and 
had this overpowering urge for a cheeseburger. About the same 
time, all of my organs started popping up." 
"Even your ... uh ...." 
"Yeah, that was all taken care of, Case'. But, boy, was I scared 
for a while! Right after I was conceived, I had to sit around for a 
whole week waiting to find out whether I'd be a boy or a girl! Talk 
about anxiety! Just think! If things had been different we would 
have broken parietals last night!" Obie puckered his lips. 
"O'Brien, you've a warped mind!" 
"You love it! And that reminds me. Guess what comes first, 
brain waves or the heart beat?" 
"Heartbeat, obviously." 
"You remember!" 
"No, I read it somewhere," Casey reported. "The heart starts 
pumping around the eighteenth day. A little over three weeks later, 
the brain waves begin to register." 
"Right you are! I got my first brain waves at 6:30 P.M. on the forty-third day." "6:30?" Casey was incredulous. "Eastern Standard Time." "Well,"Casey pressed, "what did you think?" "About what?" "I mean, what was you very first thought?" "My first thought? Let's see. Oh, yes. Where the hell am I?" "Profound." "Well, what would you say if you suddenly found yourself in 
some stranger's womb?" 
"I never really thought about it," Casey admitted. Then he added, "Hey, Obe. I just thought ofsomething really heavy. When did you get your soul?" 
O'Brien closed his eyes and said nothing for a long while. At last, he turned to Casey and smiled, "You know ,Case', I can't remember ever being without it!" 
Neither said a word, but sat quietly until Casey cleared his throat. 
"Obie," Casey said softly,"l'm glad you made it." 
"Me, too, Case'."

Clearly the trend toward non-ac­ademic jobs is strong. Lewis Solomon, executive director of the Higher Education Research Insti­tute notes that betwen 1980-85 the size of the college-aged group will decline by 25 per cent. Although colleges and universities expect more adult part-time students, it takes four to six part-time students to fill the space of one full-time undergraduate. Fewer professors will be needed. This trend indi­cates that Ph.D.'s will need to look to other professions and that graduate schools should reappraise their placement procedures

Moments later it can be awesome and menacing, however, desolate and disenchant­ing to the unwary visitor. For the Fighting Irish hockey team it was both this weekend, as Coach Lefty Smith's charges continued to excel on Friday only to come up short on Saturday, though this time not by much. Minnesota-Duluth was the oppo­nent, and Notre Dame proved its resiliency in game one of this hard-fought series before a highly partisan throng in the spanking clean Duluth Arena. With memor­ies of their previous outing, a 10-3 lambasting at the hands of Michi­gan, still haunting them, the Irish set out to prove to themselves and their fans season was a long way from being over, new-found convincing.

Inspired Irish ruin BruInS again, 95-85 
by Bill Brink Sports Editor 
Sure. It happeru; every year," right? Notre Dame beats UCLA in South Bend. You can turn the channel to'Star Trek' as long as you're watching reruns. 
Before the game even began the crowd had a ten-point lead on the Bruins, and when it was all over, so did the Irish as they soundly whipped UCLA 95-85 before a madhouse crowd of 11,345 in the Notre Dame ACC Saturday afternoon. 
The victory was the Irish's third in three years over the Bruins here in South Bend, beginning in 1974 when they pulled off a spectacular 71·70 upset and continuing last year when they topped UCLA 84-78. In both games the frenetic crowd that shook the ACC gained a reputation for giving awesome inspiration to the Irish, and Saturday was no exception. 
"You can feel it for this game," said jubilant Irish coach Digger Phelps. "These students are unbelievable. They really psyched up at the rally Friday night, and they psyched us up today. We were very uptight and we needed a big win." 
"The crowd makes me do things I don't think I'm ordinarily capable of doing, "added ND All-American Adrian Dantley, who did his thing will enough and often enough to score thirty points, tying him with UCLA's Richard Washington for scoring honors in the game. 
But if A.D. got a lot of help from the crowd, he also got a lot of help from his teamates, most notably from two non-starters, Toby Knight and Don "Duck" Williams. Knight, removed from his starting role for the first time this season, pulled out of his slump by scoring ten points

In fact, the whole Irish team played well. Dave Batton, cold from the "I'm proud to be a part of this," for there was exactly 3:22left in the Hawkins and second place on the outside in the first half, began to drive around his defender and up to said Phelps. "We've got great UCLA-Notre Dame game two years all-time scoring list. The loss set the basket, a move which earned him eight second-half points and a kids. They listen and they do whay ago when the Irish began their UCLA's record at 14-3, while game total of twelve.
