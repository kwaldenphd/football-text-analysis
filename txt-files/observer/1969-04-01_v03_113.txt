Ideology, Tactics studied  Radical Studies Program 
A Radical Studies Program has now been set up as a new course of the Free University. The program includes the Ideo­logy, Independent Study, and Tactics of Radicalism and has been introduced to the Free University by Junior Tim Me­Carry. 
Marxism and Christian Radi­calism will be studied as part of the Ideology of radicalism. The Course on Marxism will be a survey of classical Marxian poli­tical thought, with consideration of neo-Marxian, revisionist, and Maoist ideology and will be taught by a South Bend member of the Communist Party. Chris­tian Radicalism will include a study of Christian radical thought and action in the twen­tieth century.  
The University in Society and a course on South Bend, Indiana will be taught under the heading of Independent Study. The Uni­versity in Society is a coordi­nated program into research of social, political, and economic interests and connections of Notre Dame and its administra­tive elite. 
Students will work individual­ly for the most part, in areas of particular interest to themselves. The course on South Bend will involve individual and small group investigation into the so­cial and economic structure and relationships of St. Joseph coun­ty and its city. 
A study of the Tactical Group will be the main attraction under the Tactics of radicalism. This program will survey the physical and tactical aspects of both non-violent and violent direct

The management of Louies offered to build an addition to the present building to be used for the Senior Bar, provided they sign a five year contract. Crawford pointed out the advan­tages of keeping the present sight far outnumber the pro­posed bar at Louies. The reason the bar was moved to the Alum-

ni Club was because of the "trouble that arose frequently at off campus bars." ·Moving the bar back off campus would be "just inviting trouble to return." 
The class officers hope that it will influence the decision of the University on whether to turn the Alumni Club over to the graduate students or not. 

Another reason for not moving the bar is the amount of profits that have come out of the pres­ent sight since it opened in January. A similar outcome next year along with the business the football season brings should greatly benefit the class. He also

action. It will include the keep­ing of order and defense against hecklers and police harassment, and self-protection in physical civil disobedience situations. 
The program will hold an open house every Friday at 8:00 PM at the St. Francis House. On many occasions a significant Ca­tholic radical will speak. This Friday will be the first meeting of the Christian Radical Course. 
One of the more important aims of the Radical Studies Pro­gram is to set up a course in Women's Liberation. This course will consider differential pay, problems of discrimination against women, and male supremacy. 
Students who can be contac­ted about the Radical Studies Program are Don Hynes, John Kraniak, Laura and John Dotson, George Koszis, Fran Maier, and McCarry. 

Breen -Philips vandals captured 
A group of disorderly stu­dents who ransacked the base­ment lounge of Breen Philips Hall early Sunday morning were apprehended yesterday. 
Both the Hall President and the Hall Judicial Board Chair­man refused to disclose the names of the students. "We ex­pect reparations to be made for the damage," stated John Knorr, Chairman of the Hall Judicial Board. Payment to the respect­ive companies for the new equip­ment will be made either by the students involved or through Hall funds, he added. 
A juke box ten days old was battered by a pool cue. Many 
On April 12 there will be a twenty-four hour, nationwide peaceful vigil to express Amer­ican student opposition to the 
scheduled to start on each col­lege campus at nine o'clock in the morning. 
When contacted by the Observer, a representative of the coordinating committee said that he realized that Notre Dame records were destroyed and frag­ments of glass fouled up the machine. A pool table, pur­chased three days ago was also damaged. The pool cues were broken, the felt was torn and one of the brackets was cracked. Several hall lounge chairs also failed to escape vandalism. 
Beer cans and litter were scat­tered all over the basement floor. Some were also found outside on the ground by the north side of the building. 
It is not known whether the students who were caught will be tried by the Hall 1udicial Board or the Campus Judicial Board. 


Vietnam Peace Vigil April 12 
and several other colleges would be on spring break April 12. He urged Notre Dame students to contact colleges near to where they will be and to participate in their vigils. 
He also said that it was impor­tant that each person who op­posed the war make an indivi­dual effort to participate in the vigil, in order to give it the desired national impact.

Last Thursday night a strange embarrassment came to an end. The 1968-69 basketball season concluded with an A wards Ban­quet in the Monogram Room of the Convo Center. Two of the finest ever to play bail at Notre Dame bowed out, a superb soph­omore was selected as junior captain, and the 20-7 season's record was praised. 
For the student body, how­ever, the past season will be remembered for what it didn't accomplish. With the entire '67-'68 first team back and with the arrival of several outstanding sophs, the Irish seemed ready for a high NCAA finish. 
But something went wrong along the way. Little teams like Butler were bludgeoned, rather than finessed, to death. Excel­lent performances against St. John's and Utah State were 
balanced by terrible ones against Illinois and Michigan State. Creighton moved the whole thing to the edge of the cliff and Miami of Ohio pushed it over. 
It is hard to find fault with a 20-7 season, especially when it is the best in recent years. This year's Irish out-shot, out-scored and out-rebounded their oppon­ents. Few teams in the past have posted back-to-back twenty-win seasons. Yet these facts were small recompense for the hopes held by the students. From the autumn of 1967 when the first optomistic reports radiated from the Fieldhouse until the autumn of 1968 when TRUE Magazine picked NO No. I, expectations of greatness grew. And when 
greatness waned and died, the students placed the blame on the man they felt responsible-John Dee. 
The whole spectrum of unpopularity-from the "Dump Dec" signs on doors to the boo­ing during game introductions­must seem bewildering to a man who has done so much in his coaching career. John Dee pro­duced winning teams for the University of Alabanta and for the Denver Truckers of the 
Industrial Basketball League . 
When the old America Basket­
ball League folded, one ol tlle 
teams on top was coached by 
John Dee. 
At Notre Dame, Dee has 
helped to build basketball pres­
tige through his recruiting. He 
went to the NIT last year with a 
team that wasn't given much 
chan cc of finding Madison 
Square Garden, much less win­
ning any games. Playing with 
two guards who were second 
string this year, the Irish cap­
tured third place after losing the semi-final in ovcrti111e to the eventual champion. 
During the past season, Dee 
was saddled with an incredible 
number of injuries: Meehan, 
O'Connell, Carr. Bob Arnzen 
played the entire season on a 
fault heel. Sid Catlett missed frosh ball and the chance for a year of valuable playing 

experience. In spite of these factors, Notre Dame students continued to boo Dee and the moves he made. 
In the opinion of this writer, Dee was castigated because he failed the students' imag" of a great coach. Reflect if you will, and decide who you believe is a great coach and why. John Wooden just won his third straight NCAA championship with help from Lew Alcindor. Wooden is not a great coach only because of that. He has won two other titles, one of them with a pint-sized team (tal­lest man was Keith Ericson at 6-5). That bunch of maniacs demolished teams with a Wood­en specialty-a blitzkrieg gently labeled "zone press". 
On the other side of the coun­

try, Jack Kraft of Villanova 
bedevils foes with a complex 
zone defense. Tennessee's Ray 
Mears has been the only coach 
to effectively shackle "Pistol" 
Pete Maravich, using a "Chinese" 
defense. and Tony Hinkle has 
driven ND fans batty twice a 
year since Creation with his 
wonderfully patterned, ball­
control offense. 
To the fan with these images 
in mind, John Dee fails to come 
acrtoss. His teams play an aver­
age man-to-man defense. There 
is no regular press, no sophisti­
cated zone. His offense empha­
sizes individual play with oc­
casional "swing it" from the 
bench. One seldom sees a pick or 
a set play. The student begins to 
wonder whether Dee is coaching 
or merely taking statistics. 
So the stmli>nt complains, 
says Dee is incompetent, says he 
wins the majority of his games 
because of the skill of his play· 
ers. Justified criticism? Hardly. 
Yet Dee has clearly disappointed 
many among the student body. 
Perhaps this past year was 
simply one of adjustment for 
John Dee. For what must h::tve 
been one of the few times in his 
coaching career, Dec was faced 
with a glut of talent. Perhaps he 
was tempted to leave this talent 
alone instead of sharpen it. 
At Notre Dame, the ju,ry is 
still out in the case against John 
Dee. He has a chance fo':' a 
favorable verdict before he 
leaves in two years, but it is up 
to him. Next year he faces re­
building problems and another 
rough schedule. 
This reporter urges John Dee 
to do some serious thinking this 
fUmmer and some serious coa~:h­
ing this fall, to polish his ball 
players instead of watching 
them, to install an offense which 
mo~es toward a goal instead of 
waiting for a mistake in the 
defense. 
John Dee has had an excellent 
coaching career. This writer 
would like to see him end it at 
Notre Dame in cheering instead 
of booing.
