THE INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER SERVING NOTRE DAME AND SAINT MARY'S 
ND and SMC stage 'protest for life' at local abortion clinic 
Demonstrators remain peaceful 

By KELLEY TUTHILL and 
L. PETER YOB 
News Writers 
A group of 40 to 50 
protesters, composed mainly of 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's 
students, picketed a local clinic 
yesterday where abortions are 
regularly performed. 
Protesters quietly moved aside as cars attempted to en­ter the clinic parking lot and people attempting to enter the clinic could avoid the picketers by walking around them. 
"We would like to make the community aware of what is going on at this clinic," said Mike Sheliga, a graduate stu­dent who helped to organize the protest. 
The group wanted to make the South Bend community aware that abortions are per­formed locally and show the groups support for legislation that "would protect the lives of all human beings regardless of age or condition of depen­dency," according a press re-
Lithuania attempts to avoid future Red Army aggression 
VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (API ­Lithuania's government backed down Wednesday on one of its hottest points of conflict with the Kremlin, a plan to establish its own border guard. saying it wanted to avoid clashes with Soviet troops. 
It also told citizens not to re­sist if Soviet officials try to seize their weapons. 
Hed Army troops refrained from occupying Lithuanian buildings or rounding up more Lithuanian military deserters, a day after the first violent con­frontations in the standoff with the republic. 
However, the Soviet military stepped up a W<tr of words against Lithuania, complaining of increased attaeks on soldiers and accusing it of a campaign to discredit the.Soviet army. 
President Vytautas Lands­
bergis of Lithuania said his government suspended its plans for the border guard for fear of sparking clashes with Soviet troops. 
"At present, establishing border points would be step­ping up confrontation," Lands­bergis told a news conference in the Lithuanian capital, Vil­nius. 
Lithuanian officials said they had pushed for the border guards in hopes of winning formal recognition from for­eign governments of their March 11 declaration of inde­pendence. 
Landsbergis said even discus­sion of the subject had pro­voked conflicts with Moscow. and he said there had been re­ports of Soviet troops trying to control the roads between Lithuania and Latvia, the neighboring republic. 
Gorbachev ordered the sign­up for the border guard halted as soon as it began. In the same decree last week, he ordered Lithuanians to turn in their weapons and said those not surrendered by Wednesday would be confiscated. 
Landsbergis said he advised Lithuanians not to resist if So­viet authorities came to seize their hunting guns. At the same time, he said citizens should treat the officials as uninvited guests. 
This is in keeping with the Lithuanian strategy of refusing to obey "foreign" Soviet law while avoiding violent conflicts. 
Only about 1,000 of the 30,000 guns registered in Lithuanian have been turned in to local police, said a Lithua­nian Interior Ministry official. 

Student rights bill delayed in CLC 
By MONICA YANT 
Assistant News Editor 
The Bill of University and Student Helations will be re­ferred to a task force after the Campus Life Council (CLC) de­cided yesterday that further 
evaluation  is  needed  before  
voting on the do cument.  
"I  think  it's  a  good  docu­ 

ment." said Student Body Pres­ident-elect Rob Pasin. "but it needs snme work." 
The CLC will meet April 18 to discuss the recommendations of the task force. A formal re­view of the bill has been sched­uled for Sept. 1. 
Pasin said he hopes the task force will be comprised of cer­tain CLC members, members of the Student Government Legal Department, a law student, and a representativE' from Student Affairs. 
John Goldrick. associate vice presidPnt for Hesidence Life, 
could not attend the meeting 
due to prior commitment, ac­
cording to student body presi­
dent Matt Breslin. Jeff Shoup, 
assistant director of Residence 
Life, represented Student Af­
fairs at the meeting. 
"Enough people saw some in­
herent flaws with [the bill) that 
it really could not have been 
voted on today or rushed 
through," reported Breslin. 
He said that some CLC mem­bers may not fully understand the articles within the bill. "All they know is that the idea is good, but they need some time to develop their opinions." 
Argument at the meeting, which drew a capacity crowd of students to Montgomery The­ater, centered on Articles II and III of the bill. Article II states: "A student has the right to be judged by one's peers. Students will comprise at least one half of the panel at administrative hearings." 
In reference to the statement 
about judgement by peers, Megan Hines defended Article II by saying, "It is more fair, more equitable that students play this role in the policy­making process." Hines is co­author of the bill and executive coordinator of the Legal De­partment of Student Govern­ment 
Hines stressed that although the bill would give students the right to be judged bY their peers, they would also have the right to relinquish that right. 
The article also deals with distinctions between hall of­fenses and University viola­tions, specifically the role of hall judicial boards in handling violations of dormitory rules and "first offenses of University conduct violations in which the community affected is more significantly the dorm than that of the University." 
In Article Ill, the issue of

lease. 
The student protesters were 
instructed not to speak to peo­
ple walking into the clinic, ac­
cording to Sheliga. He said that 
this type of peaceful demon­
stration does not use the same 
tactics as Operation Rescue. 
One of the regular "sidewalk counselors", a non-student, shouted to a woman as she walked into the clinic and said "Jesus loves you!" several times. He also said "that man is a very dangerous man in there," as she entered the clinic. 
Sheliga said that abortion is not an issue of women's' rights, but an issue of human rights. "We have not come here to be arrested or to "harass", rather we have come to exercise our right to protest the killing of innocent human beings, and to try to offer help for both women and unborn children," according to the

Yaroslav Prokopovich. He said local police were refusing to hand them over to the Soviet Army as Gorbachev ordered. 
In Moscow, the commander of Soviet paratroopers alleged there had been an increase in attacks on soldiers since the independence declaration. 
The state-run news agency Tass said Col. Gen. Vladislav Achalov reported "a noticeable increase in incidents of provo­cation against soldiers and armed attacks by groups of young hooligans against both individual soldiers and military sites." 
He listed three recent attacks in Kaunas. Lithuania's second­biggest city. Two of the cases involved "hooligans" throwing stones at military guards, he said. 
Vilnius was calm Wednesday.

In a continuing show of force, 
Soviet paratroopers guarded 
the republic's Communist Party 
headquarters, which they seized 
Tuesday, but removed their riot 
gear and no longer carried au­
tomatic rifles. 
The military presence did lit­tle to intimidate Lithuanians. Some took their children to the party headquarters to show them the soldiers lounging in­side. 
The Ukrainian popular movement "Rukh" threw its support behind Lithuania's new government and urged rallies to support its independence. But Tass said the Ukrainian government asked local author­ities to ban the rallies. 
Later Tuesday, Soviet author­ities closed Lithuania to foreign journalists, diplomats and businessmen.

Fans should strike back in lockout 
"Take me out to the lockout. Take me out to the strike. So what if the fans give us grief or slack? I don't care, cause they al­ways come back. n 

As a lifelong Red PAUL PEARSON So~ fan, I have gotten Ass'st News Ed't 
qmte used to suffer-1 • 1 or 
ing and disappoint­
ment. 
However, I don't think that anybody 
should be put through something like this. 
For those of you who have been stuck in 
the Library for the past month and a half, 
the baseball players' union and the team 
owners have had another disagreement 
about money. To resolve this, spring train­
ing was delayed 32 days. Only the supposed 
"wisdom" of the people involved has allowed 
baseball to start again. 
I have taken this lockout a little person­
ally. Because I now live in Florida, I was 
looking forward to going home and seeing 
some Red Sox games during Spring Break. 
However, I never got that chance. 
Instead, I got to pick up my local paper, the Tampa Tribune, and read stories like the one about the kid who had saved up his money for 5 years just to come down to Clearwater, Spring training home of the Philadelphia Phillies, to watch his favorite team play. 
His dreams might have been crushed, but 
lP.t'.-. look on thP. hri11ht .-.iriP.. At lM1.st hP. 11ot to enjoy some sunny weather while he was here. 
I refuse to defend either side on this lock­out, which reminded me too much of the baseball strike of 1981. All that was really settled this time was that grown-ups who play childhood sports can still act infantile when they put their minds to it. As Buffalo Springfield once sang, "Nobody's right if everybody's wrong." 
Now, the lockout is over, and once again the fans are supposed to just roll over and just root for the home team as if the players did nothing wrong. However, do you think it is right that these people, who now make a minimum of $100,000 a year, to act like greedy, money-grubbing, spoiled brats every time they want more spending money? 
I mean, my father now makes less than any member of the Red Sox, but you won't see him walking off the job every time he wants a raise and doesn't get one. He has more integrity than that. 
Here's what I propose: turnabout is fair play, right? Let's organize a fans' strike! Fans would boycott baseball games to give them a taste of how it feels to have your summer plans destroyed. It doesn't have to last forever, of course. 
It should last just long enough to scare the owners and players. Just enough to get the fans' message across: "We're mad as hell at you, and we're not going to take it lying down anymore."

The state Hungarian carrier Malev will resume flights of Soviet Jews to Israel, suspended last week after it received terrorist threats from Palestinian extremists. Israeli officials expect up to 750,000 Soviet Jews to emigrate in the next decade as the result of re­laxed rules in the Soviet Union and tighter entry quotas in the United States. The prospect angers Arab leaders, who 
fear Palestinians will be displaced by the influx.

An Anderson woman testified Wednesday she didn't file a wrongful abortion complaint earlier against Dr. Pravin Thakkar be­cause the Frankton physician had threatened her life. During a Madison Circuit Court hearing, Carmen Hertzinger claimed she became pregnant by Thakkar and he performed the abortion with­out her consent on Oct. 28, 1983. An investigation by Madison County police led to Thakkar's in­dictment by a grand jury last November. 
A historic mural that includes robed members of the Ku Klux Klan should remain un­covered on a classroom wall, an Indiana Uni­versity commission recommended Wednesday.

The controversial panel is a section of "The Hoosier History," a mural Benton painted for the 1933-34 Chicago World's Fair.

Physicist tests 'cold fusion' claim 
BOSTON (AP) -Cold fusion equipment used by a University of Utah chemist who claimed to harness the power of the sun in a lab jar didn't produce any nu­clear energy, said a physicist at the school who tested the appa­ratus. 
"We did not see a peep," said Michael Salamon. who mea­sured the nuclear output of cold fusion gear in the lab of Stanley Pons for five weeks. 
"There was not an iota, not a sniff. of conventional fusion oc­curring. We saw no neutrons or gamma rays that could be at­tributed to a fusion process." 
His findings appear to be an­other blow to the already widely questioned announce­ment last March of a revolu­tionary new source of energy. 
But one backer of cold fusion said the new findings fail to prove anything because Pons' equipment was not working properly when Salamon tested it. 
Salamon said his measure­ments, published in Thursday's issue of the British journal Na­ture. were made at Pons' invita­tion. He conducted the tests last May and June, about two months after Pons and Martin Fleischman of the University of Southampton in England an­nounced they achieved fusion at room temperature in simple laboratory equipment. 

Pons did not return telephone calls for comment on the re­port.

State is 'giving up' on city schools, say critics 
MILWAUKEE (AP)-A plan to give state money to poor parents so that their children can attend private schools could be a national model, sup­porters say. But critics say the idea suggests that people have "given up" on city schools. 
The Legislature last week passed a bill that would give as mueh as $2,500 to each of nearly 1,000 low-income Mil­waukee students to help them leave the public sehools and en­roll in non-sectarian private schools. The average yearly tuition at the academies is $3,200. 
The experiment would affeet about 1 percent of the city's estimated 97,000 students. The state funds used would be de­dueted from the city's school budget. 
Gov. Tommy Thompson said he will sign the bill into law by April 27 but will wait to see the results of the Milwaukee pro­gram before deciding whether the school choice plan should be expanded statewide. 
U.S. Education Undersecre­tary Ted Sanders. who praised the experiment, said the plan could provide a form for re­strueturing U.S. schools and give options to parents whose choices have been curtailed by their income. 
But a spokesman for the na­tion's largest teachers' union denounced the plan. "It could lead to racial, educational and economic isolation of students. Those children left behind will feel the impact," said Howard Carroll of the National Eduea­tion Association. 
Milwaukee's school superin­tendent, Robert Peterkin. also opposes the plan, saying it would drain resources from depleted inner-city sehools and reverse two deeades of city and suburban school desegregation achieved through voluntary busing. 
"The concept that the eom­petitive market place will magi­cally make the public school system improve is simplistic," said Peterkin, who gained na­tional attention in integrating Cambridge. Mass. schools. 
Peterkin nevertheless has said he won't challenge the program in court. 
Plans that allow parents more choice on where to send their children to school have gained momentum in the last five years. 
Minnesota and Iowa were among the first to offer tax credits to parents sending their children to private schools. Wisconsin's voucher plan would be first in the nation to directly provide government funds for the purpose. 
Parents not more than 75 percent above the federal poverty level -an income of $12,000 for a family of four­will be eligible. Those who al­ready send their children to private schools are not. 
The bill would take effect for the next school year. Eight Milwaukee-area private schools have agreed to accept students.

"Who is Hobinson?" one gunman shouted in English. The missionary said without hesitation: "I am Robinson." 
According to Mrs. Hobinson, two gunmen ordered her to take the children into her bPd­roorn, where one assailant tied her to a chair.

The party and its militia have carried out numerous raids on Israeli targets, including an abortive suicide truck bombing in southern Lebanon on April 21. 1985. 
Another claim of responsibil­ity came from thfl Lebanese Na­tional Resistance Front, an al­liance of 12 leftist factions that includes the Communists. It did not specify which faction killed Hobinson. 
It accused Hobinson of 
"seeking to establish an Israeli 
settlement on Lebanese terri­

Tutwiler said she had no in­

I Zulu violence erupts in 'Valley of Death'
l
t• Police and soldiers keep patrol 
JOHANNEStlURG, South Africa (AP) -Rival Zulu fac­tions battled with guns, clubs and knives Wednesday in Natal province, setting scores of homes on fire and forcing hun­dreds of villagers to flee into the countryside. 
Soldiers and police patrolled Natal in an effort to quell the violence, which broke out Tues­day and has killed at least two people. 
"The whole so-called 'Valley of Death' is covered with blue smoke. I saw 120 homes burn­ing at the same time in a radius of (15 miles)," said journalist Khaba Mkhize after flying over the Edendale Valley near the provincial capital of Pietermar­itzburg. 
From 1,000 feet up, Mkhize saw crowds of more than 1,000 gathering in streets and bodies lying in fields. 
Police reported two deaths and 25 injuries since Tuesday but expected the figures would rise. Local reporters, who did not want to be named, said up to 14 people had been killed. 
As night fell, officials and monitors reported 1,500 people fleeing the townships with their belongings loaded onto trucks. 
Army units and extra police were deployed after some 2,000 Zulus supporting the Inkatha party went on rampage with guns and knives against sup­porters of the rival United Democratic Front. Observers and police say the violence was sparked by the stoning of Ink~tha buses that drove through UDF areas after a rally Sunday. 
Inkatha is fighting the UDF for control of the region. Both groups oppose apartheid, South Africa's system of racial segregation. However, Inkatha supports separate states for different tribes or ethnic groups, while the UDF wants a black majority government rul­ing all of South Africa. 
Police said officers used shotguns and tear gas to dis­perse mobs attacking and burning houses. Maj. Piet Kitching said the army would patrol all night along major routes in the 120-square-mile area where fighting was re­ported. 
"It almost looks as though the whole area is burning," said Kitching. 
"In a field, on one side of a hill a battle was raging, we could hear the guns," said Peter Kerchhoff, of a Pieter­maritzburg peace group. "On the other side, we just heard the weapons being fired amongst the trees. Masses of people were watching the con­frontations and masses of peo­pie were ... trying to go to the rescue of other people in con­flict on the hill." 
Kerchhoff said dirt roads leading to townships were blockaded with tree trunks, boulders, rubbish and burning tires. He said people were flee­ing Caluza township, where much of the fighting was cen-

tered. Houses were burning in several townships, and many of those fleeing carried with them pieces of furniture, he said. 
As his group drove through the crowds taking four injured to the hospital, Kerchhoff said, "People were saying, 'Please, we need guns."' 
Several residents and local journalists said they saw some police giving lnkatha fighters ammunition, supporting them in the battles, and refusing to confiscate their weapons. Township residents welcomed the army's arrival, said Mkhize, the journalist. 
A 13-year-old boy in a house in Caluza said over the tele­phone: "The police is coming and shoot the people. A heli­copter is up there." 
The boy, who could not be identified because of safety concerns, said his father had left the house "because of the war" and "I am running away now." 
Kerchhoff said he saw young and old men fighting on a dis­tant hilltop with sticks, clubs and machete-like knives called pangas. Among the Inkatha fighters, Kerchhoff said he saw men in blue uniforms, but he could not be sure they were po­lice. 
One of the injured he trans­ported to a hospital claimed to have been shot in the shoulder by police officer, Kerchhoff said. 
Police did not respond to the charges, but photographers took pictures of white security policemen, riot squad officers and local black police in the company of armed Inkatha men near Caluza. 
Hundreds of people have been killed in black factional fighting in recent weeks in Natal. Nearly 4,000 have died since 1987 as the Inkatha movement and UDF fight for control of the region. 
The groups have ignored re­peated appeals from Nelson Mandela and other black lead­ers to end the fighting.

"We are not here to counter­demonstrate," said one escort, "we are here to support pa­tients." 
The escorts were present as part of a project initiated by the St. Joseph County National Organization for Women (NOW), according to one escort, but she added, "not ev­eryone involved is in NOW." 
The escorts said that abor­tion is only one function of the clinic. The administrator and employees of the clinic would not comment on the protest. 
Feedback from patients in the past has indicated that 
situation easier for women, 
according to the escorts. 
They said that at least four 
to five women had crossed the 
picket line during the first hour 
of the protest. 
"I am happy with the number 
of protestors," said Cindy Sim­
mons, president of the St. 
Joseph's County Right to Life. 
She said that St. Joseph County 
is a large pro-life area. 
A law student who was 
protesting agreed with Sim­
mons. "It is good to see at 
some level the ideas of Gandhi 
and Martin Luther King-of 
peaceful, nonviolent protest to 
change laws. It is good to see 
activism," said Jim Hogan, a 
Law student. 
The students, faculty mem­bers and other members of the South Bend community marched in a circle carrying signs. Some people carried rosary beads and said prayers such as the "Hail Mary" out loud. 
Some signs simply stated "Choose Life" and "Notre Dame loves life." Others had pictures of fetuses and contained mes­sages such as "Abortion is murder" and "Selfishness

Freshman Andrea Ca­

vanaugh, a protester. said "I 
know abortion is wrong and 
it's time to take a stand." She 
said that she has participated 
in protests before, both in 
South Bend and at home in 
California. 
She said she sometimes wor­

ries about getting arrested or 
suffering personal injury, but 
that "it is worth it to save a 
baby's Iife...As Catholics, it is 
important for us to take a 
stand." 
The escorts, however, said 

that they believed protesters 
were blocking women's' access 
to the clinic. According to the 
escorts, a legal injunction ob­
tained earlier, which prohibits 
harassment of women seeking 
to enter the clinic, was being 
violated by the picketers. 
'This protest does not violate 

the injunction," claimed Sim­
mons. She said that First 
Amendment rights guarantee 
the right to "legal, lawful 
protesting." 
According to Simmons, 

protestors cannot harass peo­
ple, block entrance to the clinic 
or raise their voices to the 
point they can be heard inside 
the clinic. She said that this 
group did not violate any of the 
above injunction rules. Sim­
mons added that protesters are 
not allowed to take note of li­
cense plates or film people who 
come in or out of the building. 
"If we really violated the in­junction, [the clinic administra­tors) would have the cops here. I'm sure [the administrators) already called the cops and they wouldn't come," said Simmons. 
According to the escorts, a small group of pro-life coun­selors are present in front of the clinic whenever abortions are being performed, about three or four days per week. 
Simmons said that at least two "Sidewalk counselors" are at the clinic every day abortions are performed. 
Tracy Cabello, a resident of South Bend and a "Sidewalk counselor", stands outside the clinic every Wednesday from 4­6 p.m. She said that as a pro­life counselor she talks to the women as they go into the clinic and offers alternatives to abortion. 
Cabello said she refers women to the Crisis Pregnancy Center in South Bend which of­fers housing, medical care, adoption referral, and financial and emotional support. 
She said that she has always been active in the pro-life movement writing letters and stuffing envelopes. Cabello said she became a counselor so she could take "a more active role" in the movement.

After eight years, man wakes up 
MADISON, Wis. (AP)-Medi­cal experts said Wednesday they were puzzled by reports that tranquilizers revived a man who had spent eight years in a vegetative state. 
"This is so bizarre," Dr. Catherine Bontke of the Insti­tute for Rehabilitation and He­search in Houston said in a telephone interview. "It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't fit anything I know." 
But the patient's doctor warned that the case was an isolated one that should not be automatically applied to similar cases. 
"It makes me nervous that people are going to see this as a possibility" for treating such patients, said Dr. Andres Kan­ner. a University of Wisconsin neurologist. 
"I think we are getting ex­cited prematurely," he told a news conference. "Every patient is different. Why this happened with this patient, we don't know." 
Since the case was reported Tuesday, the university has re­ceived inquiries about it from around the world, said Univer­sity Hospital and Clinics spokeswoman Priscilla Arsove. 
Kanner reported Tuesday that a 45-year-old man was awakened after being injected with Valium during a routine dental procedure March 12. The man has been awakened several times since, Kanner said. 
The patient, a former airline 
pilot, was injured in a car acci­
dent 10 years ago. He was in a 
coma for about three months, 
then improved, but lapsed into 
a vegetative state about eight 
years ago, Kanner said. 
The patient, whose identity 
was withheld at family request, 
was being cared for in a nurs­
ing home when the drug was 
administered, the doctor said. 
The patient is being observed at the hospital. and doctors are experimenting to find the dose of tranquilizers that would al­low the man, who is married and has children. to leave the hospital and return home. Kanner said. 
When medicated, the man can remain fully conscious for up to 12 hours at a time, the neurol­ogist said. On the day he was first revived, the man was able to walk, talk and perform com­plicated math calculations, Kanner said. 
When not treated with the medication, the man returns to the vegetative-like state, Kan­ner said Wednesday. 
The patient remained in that state Wednesday at the hospi­tal, while doctors experimented with oral administration of the drugs, he said. But that proce­dure so far has not had the same effect as when they were injected and the man woke up. 
Doctors plan to continue ex­perimenting for a few weeks and, if no progress is made, they will re-evaluate the situa­tion. 
Continuous injections of the tranquilizing drugs "has its risks," including depression of the respiratory system or the heart, Kanner said. 
A vegetative state is different 
from a coma because vegetative 
state patients have sleeping and 
waking patterns, often open 
their eyes and sometimes utter 
words, experts said. 
Kanner said Wednesday the 

man was in a "vegetative-like 
state" rather than a "true veg­
etative state." 
The man had some reactions that would not be characteristic of someone in a permanent vegetative state, Kanner said. For example, the man would sometimes pull his arm away when someone tried to give him an injection, he said. 
Experts said the man's reac­tion should stimulate research and cause doctors to re-exam­ine some of their patients, but it probably wouldn't have a significant immediate effect on medical practices. 
"It must cause caregivers to be more eautious," said Dr. Richard Foa of Washington, a member of the American Academy of Neurology's Ethics and Humanity Subcommittee. "But an anecdote like this wouldn't alter my practice." 
Foa said the vegetative state has been studied in recent years as specialists try to narrow its definition. 
Usually, a persistent vegeta­tive state patient is given that prognosis after six months to a year. Many doctors believe the condition justifies the removal of life-support systems, Foa said. 
"The immediate question that arises is, 'Was this individual 
properly  diagnosed?'"  Foa  
said.  ·  
Still, the Madison  case  will  

raise questions when doctors consider withdrawing life-sup­port systems, Foa said. "But it shouldn't lead to fundamental changes in the care given," he said. 
Kanner said Tuesday that one theory is that benzodiazepines, such as Valium and barbitu­ates, inhibit certain nervous system functions and may have blocked the effects of the vege­tative state.

College girl murders infant because of 'inconvenience' 
TAMPA, Fla. (AP)-A college student accused of drowning her newborn in a dormitory toilet murdered the child be­cause he was an inconvenience, prosecutors said Wednesday in opening arguments. 
Tears rolled down the cheeks of 18-year-old Claire Moritt as Assistant State Attorney Joan Richardson denied the defense's contention that Moritt had gone temporarily insane. 
"This is a girl who chooses to deny or replace those things she feels are unpleasant," said Richardson. "When she could not wish this baby away, could not deny it -she killed it." 
If convicted of first-degree murder, the Hillsborough Community College student from Hollywood would auto­matically be sent to prison for life, with no chance of parole for 25 years. 
The jury also could decide Moritt is guilty of a lesser de­gree of homicide. 
In graphic detail, attorneys recounted how the early morn­ing darkness of Oct. 23 was 
punctuated by the  cries of a  
baby  in  Moritt's  high-rise  
dormitory suite.  

When the cries continued, roommates pounded on her bathroom door and demanded to know what was. wrong. Moritt replied she was not feel­ing well. 
Once inside, they found Moritt naked, on her knees and sur­rounded by blood. They took her to the hospital and returned to find the 6-pound. 9-ounce baby boy, swathed in a sheet, face-down in the toilet. 
The prosecution called two of Moritt's dormitory suite mates, who described helping their bleeding friend down three flights of stairs to take her to the hospital, and returning to find the baby. 
Prosecutors characterized the defendant as an upper middle­class child who was spoiled and preoccupied with what others thought of her. 
"Claire is not unlikll women you hear about who .. . give birth to healthy babies and throw them in a trash dump to get rid of them," Richardson told the jury. "But she didn't make it to the trash dump.

Economic growth in the final 
three months of 1989 followed 
increases of 3.7 pPrcent in the 
first quarter, 2.5 percent in the 
second and 3 percent in the 
third. The 3 pPrcent gain for all 
of 1989 was the smallest since 
a 2.7 percent advance in 1986 
and followed increases of 4.4 
percent in 1988 and 3.7 percent 
in 1987. 
"Nothing in the report hints 
at a recession," Sinai said, "so 
the focus has to be, does slow 
growth continue or does it 
accelerate? The first half (of 
1990) probably will be more of 
the same, between flat growth 
and 2 percent." 
The latest survey of top economists by Blue Chip Economic Indicators projects growth of 1.7 percent this year. That would be the poorest performance since economic activity declined 2.5 percent in 1982 during the last recession. 
The Commerce Department attributed its final GNP revision to an increase in final sales and a decrease in inventories.

reinforcing Sinai's belief that the economy will grow sluggishly, "occ ~s ion ali_Y flirting with recessiOn, until inflation gets down low enough to permit the Fed to lower interest rates." 
The Federal Reserve forced up interest rates last year in its light against inflation. \~hile inflation has not decltned significantly, however, the Bush administration and many economists have urged the Fed to ease its credit policies to stimulate the economy. 
The various changes left the GNP expanding in the fourth quarter at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.17 trillion. 
"High inventories tend to lead to cutbacks in future production," he noted. "It doesn't seem to be the case that inventories are going to lead to a slowdown in the economy." 
Another plus was a 9.6 percent increase in exports compared to a 2.2 percent gain in imports. Services were up 5.9 percent. 
While overall personal consumption expenditures rose

. I Challenging Church's 
t 
positions is consistent with Christian faith 
Dear Editor: 
For a person who claims to have been "blessed with special powers of discernment," Jon Beane, in his article against the ordination of women (The Observer, March 27), reveals very little insight into the sub­ject and juvenile understanding of the Christian faith. He claims to know that "it is very unlikely that at this time ... God will wish there to be women priests." 
I, too, am a Catholic, and though I do not claim to know the will of God, I trust that the women who feel called to such a vocation are women of faith. 
I It is very unfortunate that 
I 
Beane characterizes these women as "not very prayerful
1 
people" and believes that
':If 
"most" of their intentions stem from a feeling that they have
1: 
been denied, as women. "the 
iff possibility ... to attain personal i holiness." r If this were indeed the case, f the argument that "anyI Christian can attain to personal sanctity in this life, whether re­I ligious of lay, male or female," would suffice to teach them to be "humble." However, l believe one of the earliest fundamental truths we learn as Christians is that we are equal and all called by Christ, as Beane says, "to come to him." 
There is something much more special about the Catholic faith, and I hope that Beane's future experiences as a Catholic will show this to him. We be­lieve in the Church's faithful­ness to God, but we also believe in the integrity of the individ­ual. The "living voice of Christ" is not only present in the Magisterium, as Beane points 
DOONESBURY 
out, but it is also present in each of us as individuals. It is this spirit that we are to culti­vate throughout our lives, and each of us, singularly, will be held responsible for whom we have or have not become. 
To suggest that "the Church was founded in order to change people, not for people to change it" sounds as if Beane believes we are to be passive in this relationship with our spiri­tual guide. If we are not to question our faith, how can we claim to really believe in it? It is God's offer of freedom to choose faith and forgiveness, I think, which is the greatest sign of His love. I hope Beane will 
take  time  to  examine  this  
blessed gift.  
Many  women  who  are  dis­ 

turbed by the Church's sexism do believe in the " truthfulness and love of the Catholic Faith." They do not want to leave their Church, but they want to see it respect God's calling of women as leaders of His people. It is admirable to be open to the Church's wisdom, but it is more Christian to consider that souls are not "irrevocably lost" by questioning the human tradi­tions and interpretations of this institution. Maybe the "real tragedy" is not that "intelligent and industrious" people whom the Church "requires to be Apostles" are pushing for the ordination of women. Perhaps the tragedy is t~at people like Beane fail to see that these faithful individuals are re­sponding to God's call. 
Cathy Stacy Howard llall March 27, 1990 
By Terry Ehrman 

This past Saturday marked the one year anniversary of the Exxon Valdez calamity in the formerly pristine Prince William Sound. This accident fueled (pardon the pun) the en­vironmental fervor of the day. 
We all quickly blame Big Oil, Big Money and the inebriated Captain Hazelwood for the eleven million gallon rape of the Arctic. Yet I wonder whether we all do not deserve much of the blame as well, considering we, the mobile society; we, the people who continue to drive cars whose efficiency does not transcend 35 percent, create the demand for this oil. In light of our hypocrisy, I suggest that, as Earth Day 1990 ap­proaches, we all consider our personal contributions to the effrontery of the earth and, equally as important, how each of us can ameliorate the dismal situation. 
In the next few weeks, as Earth Day 1990 draws near, the media will inundate the airwaves and newspapers with environmental matters; thou­sands, perhaps even millions, of people will purchase Earth Day t-shirts as a means of solidarity to the day; and people will be impassioned to pick up trash around the neighborhood or college campus. But then what? When April 23 arrives, will people still have that same en­vironmental passion as they re­turn to work and to other per­functory activities? What about Nov. 23? 
Humans, like every other ob­ject in the universe, adhere to Newton's first law of motion, 
i.e. an object in motion tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force. In our case, these "external forces" are internal psychologi­cal forces such as ignorance, indifference and indolence. 
But we cannot afford to re­main inactive when perdition is the fruit of our passivity. Perhaps perdition is too strong a word tor our current envt­ronmental dilemma, you say to yourself? But I wonder how the twenty people who died in 1948 at Donora, Pennsylvania due to effects from sulfurous smoke output feel about "perdition." Or what about the estimated 2,000 Americans who die every year due to cancer attributed to polluted air? Or the 20,000 cancer cases estimated by the National Academy of Sciences to arise annually from pesticide contamination of food? Ask those in Times Beach, Missouri or Three Mile island or the thousand people displaced from Love Canal what they think. 
Need I continue? 
Earth Day 1 served as a catharsis for a nation frus­trated and embroiled over is­sues like the burning Cuyahoga in Cleveland, the paucity of life in Lake Erie and the oil spills of the Torrey Canyon tanker and offshore rig, the Santa Barbara. As a consequence of the first Earth Day, which in-eluded the largest street demonstration since the end of World War II, the Clean Air Act and the EPA arose before the end of the year. On that April day twenty years ago, students sentenced V-8 cars to death with sledgehammers; New York mayor Lindsay banned cars from 5th Avenue; and people tore their gasoline credit cards in half. 
Yet, on that same day, US Interior Secretary Walter Hickel announced his approval for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline (not exactly environmentally neutral) as ford, General Motors and others continued to produce the very cars the stu­dents demolished so vehe­mently. I wonder if the same disparity will exist on April 23 this year? 
Since Earth Day I, advances have been made, such as the partial recovery of the Cuyahoga and Lake Erie (Erie more so than the river), but more than one thousand cities fail to comply with the Clean Air Act standards. And what of the EPA's 1970 pledge to reduce air pollution in five years by 90 percent? Lake Erie waters may not contain the exorbitant mercury levels they once did, but you cannot exactly enjoy the waters. The Presque Isle beaches have been closed as a result of direct human effluent discharges emanating from the amusement part at the top of the hill leading to the peninsula, as well as from infamous medi­cal syringes. 
And what else has happened following the growing concern fostered by Earth Day 1970? Over the past twenty years, the number of endangered species has risen from 92 to 539, while pesticide sales have leaped from $5 billion to $50 billion. Instead of talk concerning lead, mercury and the possible dearth of oxygen for respira­tion, one now hears of acid rain. dioxin, CFC's and ozone holes, and of global warming. The spills of 1989 (all of which occurred in a three month pe­riod), Prince William Sound, Narragansett Bay, the Delaware Hiver and the Houston Ship Canal awaken echoes of the Torrey Canyon. 
What has really changed in those twenty years? What will we all do differently our second time around? Will we carry on the necessary activity to effect meaningful changes for many decades to come, or will we, like children a few days follow­ing Christmas, shift our atten­tion to other areas? As I look at the sevcritv of the situation, I hope we, as a species, have the ability to alter our lifestyles so that environmentally sound activities become habit and not just a passing phase.

ND student on TV's 'Price is Right' 
St. Ed's junior wins big on game show 
MARC JOHNSON 
Accent Writer 

"Joe Blow come on down! You're the next contestant on 'The Price Is Right!'" 
How many times has this fantasy passed through the wide expanses of the mind of the armchair gameshow con­testant? How many times has a contestant guessed the wrong price of a floorwax when the answer was completely obvious? If these mistakes have proved frustrating to the home viewer, Steve Hurd's display on the "Price Is Right" can be nothing but in­spiring. 
Stt,ve Hurd had the good fortune to traw~l to San Diego for Spring Break, but ht~ had no idea how fortunate this trip would actually be. This junior from St. Ed's and his roommate Sean Geary spent most of their time in the San Diego area. but they also travelled to Los Angeles. While in Los Angeles, Sean suggested that they attend a taping of "The Price Is Hight." but Steve was skPptical. Sean had attended a previous taping and insisted that he had had a good time. Steve finally agreed. 
''The Price Is Hight" is taped twice daily at 2:15 and 6:15P.M. After having discovered that the first taping was full, Steve again had to bP convinced that the experience was worthwhile. Sean persuaded Steve to wait four hours for the next program. and he was most pleased that he did. 
Steve and Sean did make the second taping and soon discovered a major misconception that many have of "The Price Is Hight." Although most contes­tants look very surprised upon the announcement of their name, they have a good idea that they were chosen based on the earlier actions of the producer. 
Members of the audience are questioned in groups of ten beforn they enter the studio. Steve was the object of many mon~ qut~stions than the others in his group. "After we went into the studio. everyone kept tPIIing me that I would be on. so I wasn't very surprised," Steve said matter-of-factly. 
I lurd did indeed hear the call to "come on down" after only three other contestants had correctly bid on a variety of items. Steve made the most of his opportunity and bid correctly after only one item was presented. "I had no idea how much a stove cost, but I turned to the audience and just decided to bid $850." The actual retail price was .... $910. 

Steve suddenly found himself face to face with the legendary Bob Barker. In the presence of such an awe-inspiring ligure, Steve observed only one thing "Bob had just an incredible tan." · 
He could not dwell on Bob's eomplexion for long because Steve was immediately presented a car whose price he had to estimate. The name of his game was 'Temptation;" and Steve did not give in to it easily. He had to choose the four digits of the car price from four three digit prices of different merchandise. His guess was $8930, and the actual retail price was .... $8910. 
Steve was upset, but he recovered quickly, for the Showcase Showdown and the Big Wheel awaited him. The Big Wheel is covered with money values, and the contestant must obtain a value as close to one dollar as possible without going over it. Hurd spun eighty­five cents on his first spin, and declined a second. The next contestant spun seventy-five cents on her first and just missed twenty-five cents on her second. The other contestants all received worse values, and Steve Hurd was in the Showcase Showdown competing for many fabulous prizes. 
Since his score was the higher of the two finalists, Steve had the option to pass or play on the first showcase. He did not find the patio furniture, piano. and washer and dryer to his liking and passed. His female opponent bid $9,500. 
While waiting to bid on his showcase, Steve learned of the second misconception of "The Price Is Hight." The bidding on the second showcase does not proceed immediately, for the scenery and prizes must be rearranged. During this break Steve and the other contestant determined that her bid was far too low. 
When Steve saw the prizes in his Showcase he was very pleased with his selection. He bid $18,000 for a set of golf clubs, a barbecue grill, a trip to Cancun, and a ski-boat. 
After Steve's bid Mr. Barker decided the winner with his usual dramatic flair. His competitor bid $9,500 for a Showcase whose actual retail value was ... $13,000. Steve bid $18,000 for a Showcase whose actual retail value was ... $20,704. The crack mathematical staff quickly determined that Steve Hurd was our Showcase Showdown winner. 
Sean jumped out of the audience and danced with Steve for a matter of minutes. "We made complete idiots out of ourselves," said Steve, but after winning as much as he did, he is most definitely entitled. His winnings will be converted into cash, and even after the removal of $5,000 in taxes, Steve plans to purchase a new car. 
Steve Hurd does not want your envy and he does not want to open a loan office. What does he want? "Alii want is to be believed," he said with a sigh. His parents didn't believe him, and many of his friends still don't. Believe his story because it really did happen. Maybe there is hope for the rest of us. How much does a box of Minute Rice cost? 
Community of Caring aids youths throughout country 
ANDRE' BARRETT 
accent writer 
During the past spring break, ten Black students from tlw University of Notre Dame were involwd with a program known as tlw Community of Caring. This program. set up by the KPnnrdy Foundation. and im­plementnd in inner city schools. has been establislwd for tlw purpose of helping this nation's youth. 
Thr goal of this program is to dramatically decrease such things as tnenage pregnancy, drug and alcohol problPms, and family problPms. The way in which this is done is through the cn~ation of a community that fosters valw~s such as care. respect. responsibility. family, and trust. The job of the Notn~ Dame students was to evaluate. by observing middle and high school kids. how the aforementioned goals were bPing accomplislwd. and what could be dorw to lwlp the pro­cess along. 
ThP Notre Dame students wPn• split up into fivP pairs and sent to five different eities across the nation. Jennifer Jennings and Azikwe Chandler went to Kansas City, Missouri; Traecy Wilson and Eric Griggs went to Sacranwnto, California; Carla Garda and Jan Searc·y werlt to Long Beach. California; 
Edwlon Jackson and Steve group was the children's rela­tionships with their teachers, parents. and peers. Other very important points raised were the importance of the partici­pation the h'achers with the children. tlw amount of funding for schools, the foeus of the program. and the effectiveness of the teen forums (where stu­dents can come together and freely discuss any topic without fear of reproach). 

As one of the ten Black stu­dents, I found a great need for good, strong role models. Many times these kids do not have a stable home life. They have no one to help them with their problems. The only answer, as far as they an~ concerned, is to hit the streets. For this reason, they need someone who they can trust and respect. They need someone like a teacher or administrator to be more than a teacher or administrator. They ne!'d someone to be a friend and care, someone who can show them that it is possible to overcome adversity. 
Hopefully, a program like this, in an updated and improved form. ean be implemented in South Bend and Chicago schools in the near future. We all need to show a little coneern for our youth. If these kids cannot overcome the troubles and burdens of today's society. what is the chance that then• will be a tomorrow?

page 12 The Observer Thursday, March 29, 1990 
lark's Rebels get nod from fellow Final Four coaches 
DENVER (AP)-UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian, one of five coaches to win 30 NCAA tour­nament games, would prefer one little old national champi­onship. 
And two of his Final Four colleagues believe he'll get it. 
"I think Tark has a tremen­dous basketball team," said Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson. "We got a chance to play them· earlier in the year (losing 1 01-93). They've got a nice front line and good guards, and they've got that wild man, (Moses) Scurry. He scares me." 
Georgia Tech coach Bobby Cremins came away impressed after UNLV's 131-101 rout of Loyola Marymount in the West Regional final. 
"Particularly after the Loyola game, I feel you've got to favor Tark's team," Cremins said. "But there might not be any fa­vorite with how close the games have been." 
In Saturday's semifinals, the Razorbacks (30-4) meet Duke (28-8) and UNLV (33-5) takes on Georgia Tech (28-6). 

During a conference call Wednesday, the four coaches of the Final Four teams discussed the weekend's matchups. 
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski saved his praise for fellow-ACC team Georgia Tech. 
"Bobby Cremins said all those nice things about me earlier and then he goes and picks someone else," Krzyzewski said. "I think he should do it. If 
not, the people of Atlanta should string him up." Tarkanian was the most diplomatic. 
"I don't think there's a clearcut favorite," Tark said. "If you took a poll after our game with Ball State, I don't think anyone would have picked us. I think it's about as equal a tournament as you'll find." 
But Tarkanian said earlier that "if we play real well, there isn't a team we can't beat." 
Tarkanian has a 31-15 tour­nament record while coaching at Long Beach State and UNIX The other coaches in the 30­victory club are John Wooden (47), Dean Smith (43), Denny Crum (32) and Adolph Rupp (30). 

The discussion then turned to the high altitude. 
"I told our kids we'd be play­ing inside," Richardson quipped. "I remember when the Olympic team played there, some players were gasping for air.

league-low 94 home runs. 
Toronto Blue Jays 

The Blue Jays finally found the right manager and the right ballpark. Spurred by sellouts and Cito Gaston, Toronto re­covered from a 12-24 start and outlasted Baltimore in the stretch. 
This year, the Blue Jays could draw 4 million at the SkyDome. Still. they might rather play at Fenway Park, where they've beaten Boston 17 straight times. 
Toronto does most things well, none of them great. Dave Stieb (17 -8) heads a staff that led the division with a 3.58 earned run average. Jimmy Key (13-14) should bounce back and John Cerutti (11-11, 3.07 ERA) was better than his record indicated. Todd Stottlemyre (7-7) is a compe­tent fourth starter. 
Tom Henke (8-3, 1.92 ERA. 20 saves. 148 strikeouts in 151 innings) is the closer in a bullpen full of competent mid­dle-relief and set-up men. Jim Acker (1.59 ERA in 14 games) and David Wells (7 -4, 2.40 ERA) are good and Duane Ward (15 saves despite a 3.77 ERA) throws hard and will get better. 
George Bell, at 30, is the last remaining member of what was once projected as baseball's best outfield. Like him or not, he can hit {.297. 18 home runs, 104 RBis). Fred McGriffs 36 homers led the league and Kelly Gruber (.290, 18 HR) is solid. Tony Fernandez doesn't want to lead off and with a .291 on­base average. no one should force him. Mookie Wilson (.298, 12 stolen bases in two months) became the rage in Canada; At 
34. he can still play. provided Junior Felix (46 RBis, 18 steals in a platoon role) doesn't keep him out of the lineup. 
Watch rookie John Olerud. He was being touted as the next Babe Ruth. at least as a pitcher who can play every day, and is in line to be the Blue Jays' des­ignated hitter. He has recovered from a brain aneurysm and scouts say he's for real. 
Milwaukee Brewers 

Free agent Dave Parker lends his bat to an offense that al­ways comes down to Robin Yount and Paul Molitor. But, can the Brewers solve their two omni-present problems -in­juries and fielding? 
Yount (.318, 21 HR. 103 RBI) beat out Ruben Sierra for the MVP award and continued his march toward 3,000 hits. At age 34. he should get there next season and after that. maybe 4,000? 
Molitor (.315, 27 SB) and Parker (97 RB!s for Oakland) are good. Rookie outfielder Greg Vaughn (26 HR. 92 RBis in 11 0 games at Class AAA Denver) might be a rare Milwaukee prospect who pros­pers and could squeeze out Rob Deer (26 HR. 158 strikeouts in 466 at-bats). 
APPhoto 

All in all. it doesn't sound that spectacular. The Brewers aren't, but that shouldn't stop them from contending in the East. 
Baltimore Orioles 

From the minute they rallied to beat Roger Clemens on opening day. it was a special season in Baltimore. The Orioles tied the 1967 Chicago Cubs for most victories (87) after a t"oo-loss season and showPd the fourth-greatest im­provement in major league his­tory. 
A wild pitch from up-until­then brilliant rookie reliever Gregg Olson in Toronto on the final weekend stalled Baltimore's bid to go from worst to first. Now. the ques­tion is whether the Orioles can stay at the top. 
A dominant trend in baseball during the years is that teams that make tremendous strides in one season are likely to fall back the next. So it might be for the young Birds.

An NCAA berth is well within Notre Dame's reach. This weekend's tough meets at Miami of Ohio and home against Wisconsin are crucial to Irish tournament hopes. 
"Miami beat us the last two years. We're probably slightly better than they are on a neu­tral court, but this match will be played outside at Miami. As for Wisconsin, that could pos­sibly be the most important match we play all year."

City of Oakland up in arms over Raiders' possible retum 

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) ­Passions are rising in this city divided by money and football. 
Football fans clamoring for the return of the Raiders are pitted against parents demand­ing money for schools. Politicians are faced with a voter revolt. The proposed $602 million deal with Raiders boss AI Davis, so certain two weeks ago, is now filled with doubt. 
Don Perata, the Alameda County supervisor quarterback­ing the drive to bring the Raiders back. says the deal would be killed if opponents. who joined Wednesday with a powerful voter group, succeed in putting the issue on the November ballot. 
That would suit the anti­Raiders just line. 
Davis, meanwhile, is keeping his options open and listening to proposals from Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum officials about a deal to stay there. 
A dogged and angry group of Oakland residents have formed "Voters Against the Raiders Contract" in an effort to gather 20,000 signatures to put the is­sue on the ballot. 
The group got a boost Wednesday when it joined with the East Bay branch of Voter Revolt, the statewide group that mounted a successful bal­lot campaign in 1988 to lower auto insurance rates despite the insurance industry's $60 million effort to light the mea­sure. 
"If they are able to obtain the necessary signatures to put this on the ballot this fall, and if the city moves to delay action until after the November ballot, then I'm ready to get off the train," Perata said. ''I'm not ready to pr0long this for another six months." 
Perata said that if the refer­endum drive is successful he would recommend that the county drop out of the deal rather than get involved in a le­gal light over the NFL team, which moved to Los Angeles following the 1981 season. 

Perata said Davis won't be willing to wait for more talk. 
"What you're really talking about is killing the deal." Perata said. "It's not to modify it. It's not to send negotiators back to the table." 
Jack Murgia, the East Bay di­rector for Voter Revolt, said he'd rather see the issue go to a vote than simply die out. 
But, he added, if Perata "drops out and the deal falls apart, I'd say the will of the Oakland voters is being upheld." 
''I've never seen an issue that has been so lopsided, and this is lopsided against the deal," Murgia said. "People are against this even more than they were against the insurance industry. More than 90 percent of the people we've talked to 
Umpires disagree, put off return 
PORT ST. LUCIE. Fla. (AP) ­The agreement to return major league umpires to exhibition baseball games fell apart Wednesday when the two sides could not agree on an arbitra­tor. 
Originally, Judge Stanley Greenberg was to consider the umpires' protest over the rescheduling of games without their input following the end of the spring training lockout. 
But management went to U.S. District Court Wednesday, ask­ing Judge Norma Shapiro to disqualify Greenberg for undis­closed reasons. Judge Shapiro refused the request and when the two sides went back before Greenberg, he disqualified him­self at management's request. 
That sent the two sides back before Shapiro, who tried to get them to agree to another arbitrator. Among the 20 names suggested were former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth and former U.S. vice president Walter Mondale, but the two sides could not agree. 
The umpires and baseball are due back in Shapiro's court­room Thursday morning, when management will pursue its re­quest for a preliminary injunc­tion to prevent the work stop­page. 

Minor league umpires have been working spring training games since Monday, replacing major league umps in the dis­pute. 
The arbitration agreement, reached earlier this week, called for the regular umps to take over games Friday. With the new dispute, that now ap­pears impossible and the minor league umps are expected to continue working the spring training games.

Notre Dame men's tennis blanks Indiana in important road match 
By KEN TVSIAC 
Associate Sports Editor 

Notre Dame men's tennis coach Bob Bavliss seemed shocked at the ease with which his squad defeated Indiana on Wednesday in Bloomington. 
"With all the youth we have on this team, I'm surprised at the score," Bayliss said of a 6-0 Irish victory over the Hoosiers. "This was more than I had ex­pected. They beat us here (at Notre Dame) last year by a score of 5-4. We are a different team now, but nonetheless we were as impressive as we have been all year." 
Bayliss' team lost only one set in six singles matches against the Hoosiers. Indiana elected not to play the three doubles matches since the match was already decided and they did not wish to risk injury to any of their players as the Big 10 sea­son gets underway.

feated Gunnar Salumna 7-5, 6­1 at first singles to lead the way for the Irish. while senior Walter Dolhare won his second singles match over David McCallum 6-4. 6-4. 
Notre Dame was at a disad­vantage because the Hoosiers elected to play the match out­doors since due to weather conditions they have been able to practice outside more than the Irish. The fresh air didn't hamper Notre Dame's play one bit. 
Freshman Chuck Coleman scored a 7-6, 6-2 victory over David Russell at third singles to lead the Irish youth movement in the singles matches. Classmates Mark Schmidt (fourth singles) Andy Zurcher (fifth) and Ron Rosas (sixth) rounded out the Notre Dame victory column. 
"These freshmen are experi­enced players," said Bayliss. "We're a reasonably talented team, but I just h&d no idea

blow that plunged Notre Dame below both Penn State and Columbia for a third place finish overall. Although the Irish men's foil squad also finished fifth a day earlier, the epee fencers had to participate in the last phase of the competition, a mental factor that caused the epeeists to feel they had let the team down. 
"The other teams felt dis­appointed that we (the epee squad) didn't do any better, so we felt kind of responsi­how we would hold up over the course of the season." 

The 22nd-ranked Irish have held up to the tune of an 18-3 record. One of the main reasons for this is that they have found compatible combinations on their doubles teams. 
"None of the teams we work with now are the ones we em­ployed this fall," said Bayliss. "I wasn't pleased with our dou­bles teams then, so we did some switching, and it worked out. 
"At first singles, Mike Wallace and DiLucia comple­ment each other well and are very aggressive. Mike actually has the quickest hands on the team, and he's at his best when he has to react quickly and his instincts take over. People know about David because of his singles play, so they try to volley towards Mike when they have a chance, and that's the last thing they should be do-

ble," said Beshin. "With our taking the gold and the bronze in individual epee, we erased that whole mindset and put the epee team back in good standing." 
Being an underdog in the individual competition, Beshin surprised a lot of people. He fenced approxi­mately 16 opponents in his drive to win the gold medal. 
"The whole day I was a lit­tle apprehensive, because in the first round I didn't do so well," said Orange, N.J., na­tive. "In the second round I got into a good flow, but in the final round it seemed like the majority of the crowd didn't expect me to win." 
Beshin deposed of team­mate Calderhead 5-4, 5-2 be­fore getting to the final bout. In the joust for the gold medal, Beshin had to beat Dan Nowosielski from Princeton, brother of Notre Dame sabreman Leszek Nowosielski. Beshin elimi­
nated the Princeton ace 5-4, 5-2. 
"Since I was such an un­derdog, a lot of people were on my side," said Beshin. "When I got the first few touches, I got a lot of confi­dence and managed to win. It was one of the best expe­riences of my life." 
His coach, Michael DeCicco, told him before the match to go in and have some fun. 
"lie (DeCicco I just told me and David Calderhead to have fun with it. After the match, he told us that by go­ing in and having fun we could win the gold and the bronze, and that made him happy." 
This was Beshin's first NCAA tournament competi­tion, which make his ac­complishments that much more of a surprise.. Last year hfl chose to sit out and concentrate on academics. 
Irish golfers take off for Bluegrass state in 25-team golf tournament 
ByRICHKURZ

Lexington, Ken., is the next port of call for the Notre Dame men's golf team. It's travelling to the Bluegrass State to take part in a tournament hosted by the University of Kentucky. Twenty-five teams are expected to compete in the two-day, 54­hole match. 
This tournament, like the spring break trip to Florida, was scheduled as part of a master plan designed to move Notre Dame up to a higher level of competition in NCAA golf. While the field at Kentucky won't be as strong as the one the Irish faced in Florida, it is nevertheless above the caliber of the MCC foes the Irish are used to dominating. 
The field reads like a Who's Who of midwestern academia. Schools from Wisconsin to

Capping off six days of NCAA Fencing Championships, Notre Dame sophomore Jubba Beshin took first place in the indi­vidual men's epee competi­tion and sophomore team­mate David Calderhead took third. 
These achievements came on the heels of Notre Dame's relatively disappointing third place finish in team competition. Moreover, the men's epee squad has been considered the team's weakest link in a strong drive for the NCAA team title. 
"This was great especially for the epee team," said Beshin. "We've been known as the weakest team and we weren't expected to do so well at the NCAA's."
