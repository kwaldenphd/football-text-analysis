Joyce speaks at ND night 
by Tom O'Neil Editor-in-Chief 

Universal Notre Dame Night came to the Monogram Room of the ACC last night. 
Sponsored by the Alumni Assoc­iation, the activity intends to promote the "spiritual character" of Notre Dame, according to Fr. Edmund Joyce, University Vice President, and guest speaker for last night's event. In honor of Notre Dame, dinner celebrations of this type are conducted throughout the world during a three-month period every year. 
The evening began with an informal reception before the din­ner and concluded with the pres­entation of Notre Dame's Award of the Year, presented to Jerry Ham­mes, a prestigious citizen of the South Bend -Mishawaka commun­ity. 
Fr. Joyce, in his address to the dinner crowd, traced the history of Notre Dame, and, in particular, the financial problems the University has faced historically. 
"It costs the University $60 million to operate today," Joyce explained. "As administrators, we are forced to deal with the constant rise of prices and the increase involved with operating a private university. We cannot be forced to pass that onto the students who enroll here." 
"Private education no longer has a favored place in society," he continued. ''The federal govern­ment and independent corporations

Persons encountering probelms with the vending machines of campus are encouraged to notify the Vending Department according to Dean Winter, vending manager. 
With the machines, there are many things that can go wrong, Winter noted. The machine may reject or steal your coin, it may not give you the correct change, the wrong product may be recieved or the desired item to be purchased may not be available. 
"The policy of the vending operation is to return any money that the vending machine has accepted without giving a product in return," Winter indicated. He emphasized furthermore, that the vending department strives to pro­vide the products the consumer wants and to provide products of high quality. 
If you have been short-changed or have any suggestions to improve vending, Winter encourages those to call 8888 or write to the Manager 
of Vending in the  North  Dining  
Hall.

are putting their money elsewhere, and considering the falling birth rate, education will become more expensive in the future." 
Joyce offered no solution to the financial problems the University may face in the future, but confess­ed confidence in the continued financial stability of Notre Dame. 
Near the conclusion of his ad­dress, Joyce commended the sup­port of "The outstanding people" in attendence last night and cited the "spiritual character" of Notre Dame as a reason for their dedi­cated support. 

''If it had to be summed up into one word," he noted, "Notre Dame could be said to have charisma." 
The continued successes of the Univeral Notre Dame nights throughout the world were cited as evidence of a growing concern about the University world-wide by another member of the event. At present, there are over 100 similar celebrations elsewhere throughout the world, the first of which was conducted in Gary, Indiana on March 15 with Fr. James Burt­chaell, Provost ofthe University, as the guest speaker.

Food, beverages, waitresses now offered at Nazz 'deli' 
by Joe l.opina 
Staff Reporter 

The Social Space Committee of the Student Life Council revealed plans for a delicatessen-style res­taurant opening in the Nazz on April I. 
Food will be served from 9:00 
p.m. to 12:00 a.m. on Wednesday through Saturday for the remainder of the semester. These hours will serve as a basis for the schedule next semester. The delicatessen will include waitresses at tables serving an array of sandwiches, snacks and various beverages with live entertainment. 
"Our special attraction will be the 'Nazzwich,' a sub-sandwich served by the inch with a maximum of 22 inches," said Kathy Van Effen, a member of the Social Space Committee. "It will be good for large groups." 
The food will be prepared by the Huddle staff, but nothing on the menu is available in the Huddle. A variety of food will be offered at various prices. ''Thanks must go to the University Food Service for their help in choosing the bill of fare," stated John Reid, a member of the Student Life Council (SLC). 
The restaurant is designed to bring people out of their dorms as an alternative to off-campus drink­ing activities. Plans for the future include an extension of operation hours to seven days-a-week. The first month of operation will be experimental. 
Comments and suggestions are welcomed by the Student Activities Office on the first floor of the LaFortune Student Center or by calling 7308. 

Economic index is still favorable 
by David Wallace Associated Press Writer 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The government index designed to predict future economic trends climbed for the fourth consecutive month yesterday. but at a slower rate than the previous month. 
The increase of eight-tenths of one percent for February indicated sustained economic growth in the next few months. but at a more modest rate. 
The February gain compared to a 
I.S percent advance in January. That figure was revised downwarc from the 2.2 percent originally reported. 
The index is compiled by the Commerce Department from a dozen individual sensitive statis­tics. Eleven of the 12 were reported in time for inclusion in the monthly computation. and eight of those p,)inted upward. 
The major upward intlucnce came from a higher percentage of firms reporting ditticulty getting fast deliveries. Slower deliveries arc considered a sign of increased demand. The preeentage of firms saying deliveries had slowl~d increased from 42 percent in Janu­ary to SO percent in February. 

The index also showed indica­tions of economic growth in thesr' statistics: lower layoff rate in manufacturing, higher wholesale prices for key commodities, a faster formation of new businesses. high­er stock prices, a larger money supply after adjustment for intla­tion, a greater volume of orders for manufacturers of consumer prod-ducts and ;~ larger numbet· of building permits issued. 
The upward forces more than made up for the downward fon:t·s exerted bv a shorter work week. a snwllcr ~olumc of eontrach and orders for production facilities. and a ~lower rate of growth in the volume of cash and securities which can quickly be converted into cash held by eonsumcrs and busi­ncsscs.

Would you belieue holy orders for WOMEN, too? 
The earth-shaking issue 
of equal rights for women 
in matters of the Church. 
EDITOR'S NOTE: This Is the final part of a two-part article. 
''It's much deeper than hearing· voices in the ear," said Sr. Mary Walden of Ft. Worth, Texas. who fl'l t so called. "It is a deep '>piritual conviction. Thatcall i~.so tkep you cannot not respond. 
Bonding together not to "de­fine" church but "to be" church, lav and women religious agreed that the success of the conference proved ordination to be a signifi­cant issue. Instead of allowing the ta'>k Ioree which had organiz­ed the meeting to self-destruct, the women approved the designa­tion of a national group to keep the is'>UC alive. This is to be done through a constant dialogue with the bi... hops and the people in the 
pew. 
"It has been difficult for the church to accept the idea of lay ministers. They arc SL'l"n as invading sacred space," believes Sr. Hughes. "It is the same on the ordination movement. The people need time to explore the issue." Ordination will eome not through a "wild revolution" hut through a "peaceful on-going dialogue." 
"It is our duty to keep this dialogue alive.'' .'>he added. Dr. Josephine Ford, professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame disagrL'l·d with this mild strategy and advocated a more agressive call to action. 
"The general atmmpherL' of the confer­ence was gentle, unthn:all'ning, prayerful. The strategcms discu....sed were mostly what not to do and in the end we should he nunlikt·, good girls. mcl'k and mild. I think the time has come to take an aggressive approach.'' 
William Storey, also a Notre lhmc tl!l'ology professor agreed that women '>hould he "adamcnt" hut should he careful not to isolate the regular parishoncrs. 
"Women arc not asking for piddly L'Oilcl·ssions. I think it gratuitously in-.ulting that women arc not rccogni~.cd to be official readers at the mass. Women won't gl'l a L·hangc standing around wi-.hing 'wouldn't it he nice'!'. But only through patient insistence will the move­ment gain respect." 
Storey advocated dialogue with the hislw.ps as a mclhod of insistl'ncc which will causL' "the male authority structure within the church to numhll'." 
SOCIAl. AND TltEOWGICAt TENSION 
The real tTUX of the ordination move­ment is that its theological roots complicate the is,ut· hevond that of sexual discrimina­tion. No ont: can daim a right to ordination as om· would daim a right to equal pay or equal joh opportunities. 
.. It would Ill' a mistake I hl'lievc to rnlun· the questiou of the ordination of \\Oill<'ll to <lllL' of injustice," Al'l'hhishop lkmadin assnll'd. "It would be correct to do thi~ onlv if ordination were a (;od-gin·n right ;,revery individual; only if .'>llllleholl' one·..., human potential could not he fulfilkd without it." 
Svripture and tradition, lhcu, must be ,. ~ plornl to dl'!ermilll' w hl'l her there are tht·ologil'al rea~on~ why women should he deuicd <'lltrv. Fr. John Gallen, Direl'lor of the Nolr<· · Dame Murphy Center for I.iturgi,·al Research stressed that the ordiuation liturgic~ must be examined. The liturgics arc the documents written ovn the church's 2,000 year history pertaiuing to the sacrament. 
"The ordination issue is not solely a social one," <.lallen aflirmed. True, one half of the mystkal body has been denied entry into the priesthood. But. using the same reasoning. one half of the population has been prevented from having babies. What should we do? Alter the chemistry of nll·n? Just so, there may be solid theological reasons to prevent women from entering the priesthood," he added. 
Gallen personally believes the liturgics pose no rcal'impcdiment t9 women's. entry into the priesthood. The qualifications described emphasize a "spirit of holiness" resident in the eandidatc along with wisdom. maturity, and cxamplic behavior. 

"There are no anatomical distinctions." 
he affirmed. But although there arc no 
explicit restrictions regarding gender there 
nwy he other difliculties. 
"The ordination liturgics arc a tradition but they may have to he qualified by other aspects of tradition," Gallen cautiously added.

Those theologians moved by the wo­men's issue have delved into Scripture and diseovercd that women surround .Jesus from I he nadlc to I he cross even when men like l'l'ln flee from a real lest of fait h. Women arc also the first to receive the l't'lltral mes.~age of the He.~UITL'l'lion. 
Not only do the advocates of ordination marshal biblical evidence to support the importance of women in witnessing the institution of the church. The fundamental Christian message docs not delineate the sexes. To allude to the gender of those who bring the message is to unjustly limit ih intended meaning. 
" 'In Christ there is neither male nor female, "Sr. Karen Stepien of the task force quoted Galatians. "For this reason, I personally believe that there is no charac­teristic. once having been made unimpor­tant by rebirth in Christ, which renders any person unlit to exercise the fullness of the priesthood which was initiall'd through Baptism." she emphasized. 
The fad that women were not among the twelve chosen apostles was a funetion of the social conditions of the time, the proponenh of ordination stress. Women in the .Judaic faith were considered "un­clean" because of the menstruation pro­cess. This mentality through the centuries has excluded women from kadcrship roles. 
"Women were thought to be essentially passive not active, emotional not intellcc­t(::d, destined to contribute to human ctf~J'tmwnity through reproduction and not production," asserts Sr. Margarl'l rarlcy a leading speaker at the ordination confcr­L'nt·l'. 
The pric~thood connotes leadership. Farley argues. When the dwrch is viewed as an institution. the priest is "govenor"; when viewed as a servant of the people. the priest is "mediator". In both old and new conceptions of church the priest is still fundamentally a leader. 
To deny onlination would not only affirm that women arc ''incapable of leadership,'' Farley believes, but it would also "perpe­tuate an unjust pattern of relationships between women and men" in the commun­ity of God. 
RIGHT TO TEST VOCATION 
Advocates of the ordination movement agree that people may not have a right to ordination, as Bernadin stressed, but that they do have a right to test the vocation to which they feel called. In this sense the issue becomes one ofjustice which calls for a break with customary tradition. 
"There are two types of tradition," said Professor William Storey of the University of Notre Dame. "There are those traditions rooted in scripture and those based upon customs. The Spanish Inquisition was a tradition. The popes have been shown through the ages to be good at breaking customs. Why don't we do it again and allow women to enter the priesthood?'' 
Sr. Patricia Hughes of the conference task force agrees that the issue is one of injustice. 
"To deny the testing of one's vocation catagorically is an injustice," she affirm­ed. "Basil' humanity involves being able to be of service, as Christ said in Mark's gospel: 'I came not to be served but to serve others.' In denying one a manner of service is in effcet to deny his or her humanity." 
The urgency 1f permitting women to celebrate the sacraments, she believes, is underlied by the fact that "God is calling". 
"The church is a structure which administers to the call of the kingdom and it docs this through an ordained ministry.'' 
Sr. Anne Carr, who spoke on "The Church in Process" at the ordination conference, believes that intrinsic to the idea of a sacramental priesthood is that "the grace which it mediates cannot be hoarded or claimed. It is given freely and is received freely." She reeognizes the ordination movement as being a sign of "generosity and freedom of Christian grace". 
TRANSFORMATION OF THE PRIESTHOOD 

Women, however, are cautious about entering the present priesthood. The chureh itself is eurrcntly examining how the model of a powerful hcirarehical elite can be transformed to one that is service oriented, one in which the priest is a facilitator of eharisms. 
"I think any woman wanting to enter the present priesthood is nuts," said Storey. "Many priests feel that they are trapped in an elitist system." 
The change would be one in whieh priest and bishop are "instrumental in bringing out the talents of the group; come down to the same level as the group." believes Dr. Jospehinc hml, theology profcsor at the University of Notre Dame. In such an environm-ent both priest and the people would undergo a learning experience togdhcr. 
If women would he allowed to enter the priesthood. it would be liberating for priests in general, Storey emphasized. "Women who advocate ordination have already transeendcd one stereotype-­women subordinate to men. It will be unlikely that they will enter a system which views the bishop's power as absolute," he added. 
Women feel the eall to a transformed mini~try. witnessed Sr. Hughes at the ordination l'tlllferenee. "They arc not dying to put on a Roman collar and live in a rcl'lory. They have no desire for power and it is without this desire for power that they will transform the ministry." 
The movement to ordain women marks a growing awareness hy women of their role in the chureh. Women demand that the church recognize their human call to be of service. The church ean no longer remain silent hut must examine scripture and tradition for reasons why women should be denied the blessing of ordination. And this can only be accomplished through dialogue between the bishops and the people; "a painful proeess," as Archbishop Bcrnadin acknowledged. 
"We must remain in dialogue, even if the dialogue docs not seem to be leading to mutually satisfactory solutions. At all times we must he ready to hear what others arc saying--really sayi.ng."

The buses leave from behind Nieuwland Science Building at Notre Dame and from the LeMans Hall parking lot at SMC. Other stops will be at Madeleva Hall, the Grotto and at the Notre Dame power plant. 
During classes, the buses will take a new route. The buses will go from the ND Library to the LeMans parking lot and back, while stopp­ing at the Main Circle, the ROTC Building, the Grotto and Made leva. These buses will make three trips each way, every fifteen minutes after the start of the class period. 
At night and on weekends the bus leaves the ND Library Circle at fifteen minutes after and before the hour. It leaves the LeMans parking lot at the hour and at the half-hour. 
There is a new route for all night and weekend runs. The bus will go from the east side of the Library Circle to the Main Circle and down Notre Dame Ave. to St. Mary's. This bus does not travel within the Notre Dame campus at any time. At SMC the bus stops at Holy Cross

Reagan acquires television time 
NEW YORK (AP) . Ronald Reagan finaly gained assurance yesterday of the half-hour prime network time he sought for a nationally televised presidential primary campaign speech, re­portedly at a cost of $100,000. 
The National Broadcasting Co. said it would make an exception to normal policy and offer the Republ­ican presidential candidate 30 min­utes at 10:30 p.m. tomorrow. On the other side of the cam­paign fence. live Democratic presi­dential aspirants converged on New York City for a locally televi­sed debate on "Who is Responsible for the Citics"--a prime issue in the tinanciallv stricken city.

AAUP bargaining poll taken here 
An opinion poll conducted among members of the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Associa­tion of University Professors shows strong support for collective bar­gaining. 
A key question asked in the poll was "At this point, as a Chapter member or affiliate, do you favor an effort on the part of the Chapter to offer itself as a collective bargaining agent?" Seventy-six members (64 percent) answered "yes." There were 35 (25 percent) "no" answers and eight absten­tions. 
Ninety-four percent of the AAUP Chapter members polled indicated a need to poll the entire faculty for their opinion on the collective bargaining issue. James E. Robin­son, professor of English and president of the Notre Dame AAUP Chapter, said such a questionnaire to be distributed to all the faculty is being prepared. 
The Chapter will meet Wed., March 31, at 7:30 p.m. in the Library Lounge to decide the final shape of the questionnaire and to discuss such issues of academic governance and financial situation that may be relevant to a need for collective bargaining at Notre Dame.

Savoie, past executive vice­president of the American Institute of Certitied Public Accountants. spoke to the group of business students and faculty of the recent corrupt business practices uncov­ered by investigative agencies. Although he later named Gulf Oil Co. and Lockheed as specific examples, Savoie said, "All of business has been tarnished by a gu illy minority." 
He went on to say the public has demonstrated it will not tolerate unethical business practices and one of the most important tasks in business ethics today is to reestab­lish public confidence in industry. 
He proposed two options, both of which have certain limitations. 
The first, according to Savoie, is to allow businesses to establish their own ethical codes and enforce them themselves. This might not be the best way, however, Savoie said, because the competitive nature of business might lead to doubts as to whether the bus­inesses would act on ethics or self-interest.

The second alternative Savoie discussed is federal governmental regulations, which he opposed because such interference by out­siders unfamiliar with the problems and practices of the industries would be undesirable. 
Savoie proposed a third alternat­ive that would be initiated by businesses that took "alert, timely and responsive action" in the tield of ethics. 
Quoting economist Peter Druck­er's theory that the sooner an element recognizes and initiates regulation the bigger role it has in framing the legislation, Savoie leaned toward cooperation between business and government in estab­lishing ethical standards. 
Savoie admitted such formalized standards are not going to be initiated in the near future. For the present time, he said, he places the burden of responsibility on the individual company's top manage­ment executives whom he said are in the best position to insure ethical business practices. 
When presented with the situat­ion in which his competitors use illegal or unethical practices to obtain sales, Savoie said, "I would gladly lose the business" before engaging in similar abuses.

The weather was damp, but the spirits weren't as Notre Dame officially started preparation for their 91st grid campaign this fall with the opening of spring practice yesterday afternoon at Cartier Field. 
After being led onto the field by Dan Devine, the squad huddled around the head coach as he delivered a pep talk. Following Devine's remarks, the team was led in calisthenics by co-captain Willie Fry and Mike Banks, substituting for co-captain Mark McLane. The team then broke down to the defensive and offensive units for individual workouts.

As expected, Jim Weiler was working out at the tight end spot and Ted Burgmeier was in the defensive secondary. Last season, Weiler played as a running back while nurgmeier played split end. 
But the surprise of the year's first practice session was the shift of Jim Browner from fullback to the defensive secondary. Browner, last season's
