Another sign of a sluggish economy surfaced Wednes­day as the Commerce Department said that U.S. factories in August sustained their sharpest monthly drop in orders for durable goods since last fall. Some government and private economists said the four percent decline in orders for such big-ticket items as automobiles, machinery and appliances was a disappointment to hopes for an up­turn in business activity. But prior to the release of the figures, Mar­tin Feldstein, the president's choice for chief economist ti>r the White House, told a Senate Committee' that the economy "now seems about ready to recover." The 42-year-old Harvard professor, speaking at confirmation hearings on his nomination to become 
chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said the recovery should be slow rather than one which "rapidly overheats and fails to persist." The Commerce Department said the August decline in durable goods followed a 2.5 percent rise in July and was the biggest monthly drop since the 8.6 percent nosedive in Octobr 1981. While new orders for defense goods leaped I7. 3 percent in 
August, there were declines in orders for primary metals, such as steel and aluminum, transportation equipment and household goods. -AP 
Cable Car No. 7, the one Humphrey Bogart rode in the movie "Dark Passage," ended its last run before a cheering crowd today as San Francisco's creaking, clanging landmarks halted for a two-year renovation. At 4:55 a.m., seven minutes later, city officials and veteran cable splicers pressed the button shutting down the giant greased wheels inside the Cable Car Barn. The final ride of the Powell Street car was a boisterous early morning affair accompanied by honking cars and trucks, whistling fans and nostalgic gripmen and conductors who wanted to be there when the famed car r~n once last time. Gripman Joe Baptiste, a native San Franciscan who first hopped on a cable car when he was "just a kid," rang the bells for all they were worth when the Powell Street car ended its run. "I'm glad this car was the last one," said veteran conductor Michael Joseph McClure, who was among 75 or so employees along tor the ride. "When Bogart rode it in 'Dark Passage' it was No. 507. Now it's just 
No.7. He got offthe car and called Lauren Bacall and told her to meet him in Peru." The city marked the beginning of its S'58.2 million overhaul of the century-old system with festivities that began early Tuesday. -AP 
NCPAC, the National Conservative Political Action Commit­tee is getting a cool reception in the Indiana heartland, even from the congressional candidate who stands to benefit most from the ultraconservative group's actions. NCPAC returned to Muncie, In­diana, Tuesday for the first time since the 1980 senatorial race, when conservative attacks on former Sen. Birch Bayh, D-lnd., helped <rOP sen. Dan Quayle get elected. Now, NCPAC has targeted Rep. Philip R. Sharp, D-Ind., as a big spender whose liberal record is out of sync with 1980s economics. Sharp's opponent ti>r the 2nd District con­gressional seat would rather NCPAC stayed away. "I would prefer them not to come in," Steve Nix said Tuesday. lie is campaign manager ti>r Ralph W. VanNatta, Sharp's Republican opponent. "It's generally known that Hoosier voters make their own decisions, and they really don't need other people to come in and tell then how to vote." Nix, a campaign aide to Quayle in 1980, said then that Quayle would have preferred to do without NCPAC in Indiana. Sharp aide john Sparks criticized the committee, saying, "They come in, cut and run. They are not responsible to anyone, and that's the kind of thing we are alarmed about, whether it's from the left or the right." -AP 
Phllippine troops raided a Communist hideout, killed a long-wanted guerrilla leader and captured three suspected dissidents, one of them a priest, authorities said Wednesday. The constabulary int(>rmation office said EdgarJopson, 35, was shot and killed while trying to escape in Davao City, 605 miles southeast of Manila. Officials saidJopson headed the National Instructors Bureau, a propag:mda group of the outlawed Communist Party. He went un­derground shortly after President Ferdinand E..\llarcos declared martial law in 1972, they said. The constabulary said troops also captured Orlando Tizon, a Roman Catholic priest, and two suspecn; during the raid. -AP 
Trade between India and the Soviet Union he­tween 1980 and 1985 could double from the previous tlve years and reach the equivalent of about $12.6 billion, Commerce Minister Shivraj Patil said from New Delhi Wednesday. Agovernment spokes­man said last week that-Indo-Soviet trade during 1981 totaled about S3 billion, slightly more than it imported from the Soviet Union that year, but normally the trade between the two nations is about even, he said. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is currently on a week-long 
offial visit to the Soviet Union. -AP 
Composer Henry Mancini, who won Oscars

It was the I,754th brass star to he cemented into the Hol­lywood Boulevard sidewalk honoring movie, TV and recording ar­tists and technicians, said Hollywood Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Monique Moss. The star sits in front ofa parking lot in the 6800 block of the boulevard, she said. Mancini, 58, scored such films as "Breakfast at Tiffany's" from which the "Moon River" theme came,_ "Charade" and "The Pink Panther" series after attaining al­most mstant fame with the "Peter Gunn" televi•'0n theme in 19'58.

Selective Service and the Right 
Whenever college students engage in arguments 

concerning political ideologies (a pasttime which all 
collegians are required to do), labels are always hurled 
around like so many senseless words. Those who 
condone a strong national defense, are against abortion 
and for school prayer are called Conservatives. George 
Will is their hero. Liberals are those people who wish to 
take money away from the defense budget so they can 
give it to those who need it to get abortions. The 
American Civil Liberties Union champions their cause. 
Then there are those that are MOR (middle-of-the­
road) and of course the ever popular ultra-extremists. 
And we all sit in our little labeled boxes shouting in­
vectives at each other. each trying to he heard over the 
screams of the others. 
It is a rare occassion when an issue arises where 

members within a certain box suddenly tlnd them­
selves at odds with each other. But there is currently a 
highly volatile issue being heatedly debated across the 
nation, not just between conservatives and liberals, but 
also within the conservative camp itself The issue; the 
Selective Service System. 
For you who need a label to work with, I'm a con­

servative. And as a loyal, practicingconservative, I am in 
favor of young men register­
ing· with the Selective 
Service. Before all you 
liberal radicals and unfaith­
ful con-servatives start 
writing me hate mail, read 
on. There's plenty more to 
get vicious about. 
The idea for this column 

came about from reading yet 
another in an endless, 
boring line of ridiculous 
human interest stories about 
brave young men who have 
refused to register with the 
Selective ~en·ice. Not a day 
goes by without a major 
newspaper or magazine 
pre~enting the saga of someone who would rather pick daisies and sing John Denver songs than sign his name to a blue and white card. I'm sick of reading about these guys. This column is a response to their childish and self-serving ways. 
This particular story im:olvnl Benjamin Sasway, the first American indicted li>r draft law violation since 
I 1P5. 
There is certainly nothing wrong with standing up for what one believes to be right. Revolutionaries have made our country the great, free nation it is today. It take pt·ople of courage and an idealistic vision of the future to stand up to the seemingly omnipotent govern­ment. But beti>re you start sympathizing t<>r Sasway, consider some of these intelligent quotes. 
"Frankly, I don't think it makes any sense to guard against oppression and slavery from the outside by oppressing and enslaving our own people." Ben may be just a bit confused. I registered three years ago and the only oppression I've suffered is from the Notre Dame administration. But if Ben is right. then I'll he the tlrst to call t()r the return ofslavery. If slavery m..:ans free room and hoard plus a monthly salary then let's bring it hack.

The answer to this country's anemic unemployment situation is at our finger tips. Slavery will not only employ all those without a job, hut our armed forces will be fortified as well. 
Sasway has more profound comments to make. "And, moreover, 1think that this is an important decision -to kill or not to kill. It's a fundamental decision that we ought to have the freedom to make." 
Either Ben is dabbling in hallucinogenic drugs or he's extremely stupid. The army isn't handing out M-I6's to 18 year-olds who register. The registration tis being used to create a pool ofeligible men in the very unlikely event that the draft will be reinstated. Even if the draft is brought hack, you still have the freedom to choose not to kill by obtaining conscientious objection status. CO 
is a very honoqble way of expressing one's personal or religious beliefs against taking the life of another in combat. As a CO, you can still serve your country while fulfilling your obliga­tion in the service. 
The statements made hy this misguided young lad are typical ofthe ones appearing daily in the media. They reveal a combination of naivete and self­righteousness. Sasway and the thousands of others across the nation who have deliberately failed to regis­ter exude the selfishness of spoiled brats who are handed everything in lite on­

ly to resist as soon as it appears that they may have to give something hack. They are reaping the rev.·ards of the free societv we are blessed with in the U.S. but are not willing to' do what is necessary to preserve that freedom. 
And there it is; a true conservative's view ofselective service registration and the people who fail to abide by it. Many of you probably disagree with the views I've presented here, hut I enjoy one great advantage over you. (leorge Will agrees with me and George Will is always right.

The rest of the third weekend of regular-season games also appeared to be a victim of the walkout. 
Even if games for the next two weeks are wiped out, the NFL will receive the money it normally would have received from the three networks which televise games, said Art Modell ofthe Cleveland Browns, who is a member of the league's television committee.

Jim Heffernan, the NFL's director of public relations, confirmed that all three networks would pay the league for at least two weeks even if no games were played. 
The league's decision to call off

Israeli an Phalangbt officer~ met 
to choose target~ and go over opera­

that Phalange otllcer~ wanted an

driving force behind the Beirut 
~icge. personally gave his nod (0 the 
Christian militia's mbsion into the 
camps. Nobody know~ the religion 
of the people killed, hut the camps 
were predominantly Moslem. 
Sharon now -says that during 
meetings with the rightist Christian 
militia, "it was emphasized that 
the action was against terrorists and 
that the civilian population must not 
he harmed." 
Then the militiamen moved into 
the camps, which blend into each 
other in a sprawl of low-slung 
houses and narrow lanes. Israeli sol­
dier~ held positions on hills to the 
west. 
"In the beginning they killed with 
knives. so as not to make noise."said 
Yahia llassam Salame. a survivor ~>f 
Chatilla who~e HO-vear-old brother 
was killed. Salame-said the killing 
started at I0 a.m. Thursday. 
By I I a.m. Thur~da)·. sniping began in the streets. "Anvhodv who crossed the street. the\· killed. him." Salame said. -
Samir Ayyoub, a Palestinian who is a sociologist at Beirut Arab t'niver­sity. said he had talked to about I0 survivors, including several who !led to his home about a mile from the camps. 
"Early Thursday. they heard people moaning and crying," he recounted. 
Israeli soldiers heard the gunfire, 
hut assumed it just meant the 
militiamen were meeting resistance 
from PLO t1ghters, several govern­
ment sources said. 
A !-year-old girl, who said her 
name was Amal, escaped with her 
mother and sister through side 
streets to Acca Hospital. She gave 
this account ofthe carnage: 
"people began to cry, 'They are 
slaughtering them, they are 
slaughtering them.· We began to 
believe it when they started bring­
ing in the wounded, with bullet 
wounds shot from close range. We 
he-ard that armed men had lined up 
~0 men against a wall and shot 
them." 
Friday. it turned out, was also a 
day of random horror. 
At dawn, the t1rst militia -forces 
emerged from the camps, telling Is­
raeli officers that battles were heavy. 
But Israeli units began to hear 
rumors that civilians also had been 
killed. 
Afew civilians escaped to tell tales 
of mass murder. No one seemed to 
pay much attention. 
Later that Friday morning. Sept. 
I-. four do«.:tors left the Acca llospi­
tal with a white tlag and tried (0 en­
ter the Sabra camp. A grenade killed 
three ofthem and wounded a fourth. 
Reporters who tried to enter the camps during the day Friday were turned away by J?halangist militiamen. They could hear gunt1re coming from inside the camps. 
Militiamen stopped women from leaving the (.'amp. One woman waved a passport or identitv card and shouted, "Lebanese, Leh;nese." .But they turned her hack also.

At about ~ p.m.. Jame~ Pringle. a reporter for !'liewsweek magazine. asked a militiaman outside the camp what was going on inside. and Pringle said the man replied. "Well. we're slaughtering them." 
An Israeli colonel across the street said the Israelis were not going into the camp. Asked about the pos­sibility' o.f militiamen getting out of hand. he replied: "I hope that doesn't happen." 
No one knows l(>r sure whether the Haddad militiamen. from an Israeli-hacked fiefdom in south Lebanon. were involved in the mas­sacre. Haddad, a renegade Lebanese army ofi1cer. is a Greek Catholic whose militias are predominantly Christian hu·t include some .\los­lem~. 
Survivors said that some assailant~ wore the uniform of Haddad's men and spoke with southern Lebanese accents. hut hoth brad and Haddad denv that Haddad was involved.

decade  of violence  that  has  torn  
their country apart.  
A  middle-aged  woman  said  ~he  

was rapnl by Christian militamen as she re-entered the camp to search for her mother. She said one soldier grabbed her on the street and took her into a house near hers. 
"There were four soldiers there," she said. "They said take off your clothes. The t1rst one said, 'Let them do what they want to you and you'll he OK.' They raped me. Please don't use my name, because of the dis­honor." 
The woman said ~he was spared after she showed her Lebanese pas­sport. But she added that 26 of her Lebanese relatives were killed, including her mother and her father, 
who was found dead on his bed with 
his wheelchair beside him. 
Samir Azuh. a young Lebanese. 
said he was arrested by Haddad's 
forces on friday. While he was being 
questioned. he said. "One man tried 
to run away. They brought him hack, 
put him up against a wall and shot 
him in the head." Azuh was released. 
Sometime during the day Friday, tractors moved in and began bulldozing bodies under the rubble of exploded buildings. [o,raeli sol­diers remained outside the camps. 
Friday night, the eve of the Jewish New Year, was a time li>r rellection rather than celebration in theJewish faith. Israelis went to synagogues. others prepared ti>r a three-day holiday. · 
In Beirut. Jewish soldiers wor­shiped on the hills overlooking the refugee camps. still unaware that a ~laughter of stunning dimensions had happened under their noses. 
Earlier Friday. \1ajor (;en. Amir

mand. ordered an immediate halt to 
the operation through the Phalange 
liaison officer. Sharon said Wednes­
day. But. Sharon added. "it was not 
known then what was being done" 
in the camps. At 6:50 p.m.. Sharon 
said, the Phalange commander 
agreed that all his militiamen would 
leave tht· camp by Saturday morn­
ing. 
But survivors said the militia con­
tinued to kill families and butcher 
children and int;mts. Even horses 
and dogs fell victim. 
In the morning. the Phalangists 
left the camps and the Israelis or­
dered their troop~ not to enter "so as 
not to link the Israel Defen~e Forces

Sharon said. 
There was no one to stop repor­

Dramatic twist 
Allied takes over Bendix 
BY ROBERT BURNS 
AP Business Writer 
Allied Corporation agreed to buy Bendix Corp. on Wednesday, then said it wanted Martin Marietta, too, in a $2.:\ billion package deal that further complicated one of the most complex corporate merger battles ever. 
Bendix agreed to the takeover by Allied to avoid being bought by Marietta, which was scheduled just hours later to begin buying as much as halfof Bendix's stock under terms ofits Sl.5 billion takeover bid. 
Moments after the Allied an­
nouncement, Bendix disclosed that 
four of its directors had resigned 
Wednesday night. The four said in a 
statement they quit because "it was 
difficult for us to fi.mction effective­
ly." They gave no further explana­
tion. 
Late Wednesday, Judge Harrison Winter of the 4th li.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals in Baltimore refi.1sed Ben­dix's request to block Marietta's stock-buying, to begin at midnight EDT, upholding a l '.S. District judge's ruling earlier in the day. But Allied's higher bid appeared to give Bendix the edge in the takeover battle. 
Earlier this week, Bendix had bought 70 percent of Marietta's stock under terms of its S1.7 billion takeover bid. With the appeals judge's ruling, Bendix and Marietta could end up owning a majority of the other's stock, and what that means for Allied's offer wasn't known. 
Allied chairman Edward Hennes­sy said Bendix had agreed to be taken over, and that Allied then would also own the Marietta shares that Bendix bought on Monday for about S 1.2 billion in cash. Allied said it intended to buy the remaining Marietta shares after consummating its merger with Bendix, but it did not say what those extra shares might cost. The S2..~ billion 
proposal was not broken down. Marietta had planned to huv about 
11.9 million shares, or just o~·er half of Bendix's stock. But Wednesday evening, Marietta said Bendix shareholders had withdrawn about 
1.2 million of the shares thev earlier had submitted under the Ma~ietta of­fer and that it expected most of the 
4. 5 million shares of the Bendix employee stock plan to he withdrawn by the midnight deadline. That would leave just over 9 million shares, even if no other shareholders were enticed awav before the deadline by Allied's high­er bid. 
William Agee, the Bendix chair­man, said the agreement in principle with Allied involved Allied paying about S I. I billion in cash for I :\.I million Bendix shares, or S85 a share. Allied, a diversified energy concern, would acquire the remain­ing shares by exchanging securities valued at about S7:\ per Bendix 
share, Agee said.

Summt:r computer camps for gifted students have been around for years, but it is generally ack­nowledged that Denison Bollay 29, a computt:r consultant from Santa Barbara, Calif., and founder of Com­puter Camp Inc., put together the first program that combined sun­shine with digital fun. 
His first camp opened in Santa 
Barbara in 1980; in addition to the 
three he now operates, he plans to 
inaugurate one in (ireat Britain next 
year. 
Bollay's Santa Barbara camp is a typical one. In a screening proce­dure as trying as those required at tennis camps, new campers are tested on the day they arrive and are assigned levels (from beginning to advanced) based on the results. 
They are encouraged to learn at least one computer language ­BASIC, PASCAL, LISP. or LOGO-as well as to take a course in a related topic, such as electronics, robotics, artificial intelligence, games and 
simulations, even computer ethics. 
Recognizing that even the most precocious of campers need to ab­sorb the increasingly complex rudi­ments of computer science, Atari is offering sessions that last for four weeks, twice as long as the other 
camps. 
One unti>rtunate drawback to 
these camps, however. is that the ex­
pensive equipment and highly 
trained, well-paid staffs have placed 
the cost of two -let alone four ­
weeks at computer camp out of

On the Media 
Which, of course. brings us to the second half ofthe opening query. 
Indications are that the main culprit in the case is -no surprise if you really think about it-money. 
A startling paradox was presented in a na­tional newspaper last week. On page one of the Lifestyle section was a feature on the boom in the arts in America. On page seven of the same section was a piece that announced the death ofCHS Cable. a prime source ofcul­tural programming. 
In the last week. new music halls have opened in Haltimore. Toronto, New Orleans -even Peoria. They are an indication of a trend toward a greater acceptance of the arts hy average Americans-a trend confirmed hy

Just over a year ago, CHS began offerring an ad-supported cultural channel to cable viewers. The venture was reportedly the pet project of CHS Chairman WilliamS. Paley. the man who once suggested that all three net­works set aside prime time blocks for cultural programming. Hv last week. CHS Cable reached S million homes. In 90 days. it will he gone. 
"CHS got itself into a hopeless tlnancial situation," according the Larry (irossman. the president ofPHS. "1fthere "''ere a large enough audience ( ti>r cultural programming). and if costs were low enough. it would already he on commercial television." 
That's a weak argument. for years. televi­sion executives have maintained that they simply "give the people what they want... In reality, however. they make decisions solely on the has is of tlnancial tally sheets. 
The history of television broadcasting is lit­tered with incidents in which advertisers. not the public, dictated network decisions. And CHS virtually doomed its cable venture to failure from the start hy making it rdiant on the support of advertisers. These are not the times to rely on the generosity of corporate America -nor governmental America, for that mann. 
In 19HO. the t'ederal government spent S600 per capita annually on defense. Another S I .~0 ti>r every man. woman. and child in the country were spent on education. At t the same time. ~o cents per person were spent on the arts. With Reagan budget cuts. the 19H2 tigure

Ironically, the decision to drop-the arts project came just tive days after Paley, the one network believer in cultural TV, announced his retirement. 
Now. the company has an excuse never to try again. PBS. who's toying with the idea of a pay service via satellite, can justil)· dropping their project.

ND volleyball 
Senior Pagley lends experience 
By MIKE SULLIVAN 
.\j}()rts Writer 
The 19H2 ~otre Dame women's 
volleyball team is the most ex­
perienced ever in terms of com­
petitive volleyball action. hut it b 
also the youngest team ever.

Despite the success and praise that seems to have come to him so quickly, Larkin knows that there is still a lot of learning and adverse situations that he has to face: 
In the learning facet he admits that his pass coverage reading may need some improvement. He has, however. already received an educa­tion about t;lCing adverse situations.

Northwestern sinks to top 


It was a week ofstartling upsets, as teams across the country, inspired hy the first of the weekly rankings, struggled valiantly to lose. 
As a result, no fewer than six of the ten teams ranked in last week's poll were victims of disappointing vic­tories. 
But some things never change. Northwestern 
thought that losing to lowly Miami (Ohio) might he a difficult task. Wrong. The Mildcats never led in the game, and turned in a tine performance -losing to the Redskins, 27-1 ~. 
That makes .H straight games Northwestern has lost. The Big Ten schedule, in which the Kittens are always so successful, is pushed hack another week this time, as Northwestern goes after No..">5 -facing never tough Northern lllinois. 
In last week's spectacle, the Mildcats came up with just over nine inches on every running play. 252 inches on 2"' carries, to he exact. Northwestern coaches were disappointed, however, as the Kittens failed to rush for negative yardage. That's the first time this season that has happened. 
In Oregon, the Ducks had a truckload oftrouhle, t1nd­ing yet another innovative way to lose. Against Fresno State, Oregon came up with two safeties -though one was intentional on the part ofthe Bulldogs -and lost. 
"Breaker, hreaker. Those ducklings done it again, how 'hour it! You got it good huddy, they lost to Fresno, 10-4." 
The "Washington's Farewell Address" Award, presented annually to the game that doesn't want to end, goes to an epic Yankee Conference clash. Last week in Orono, Me., the Black Bears of Maine and the Rhode Island Rams hattled to a 21-2 J tie at the end of regulation time. Under new conference rules, ties are

Women's tennis 
Irish blank DePaul Blue Demons 
By DAVE STANG 
Sports Writer 
The Fighting Irish women's tennis team whipped an outmatched DePaul University team 9-0 yester­day at the Courtney Tennis Courts to raise their season record to 5-1. The BlueDemm.s( 2-4) were never even close as Notre Dame won every match in straight sets. 
Sophomore Laura Lee playing in place of the resting Susie Panther at No. I singles defeated Michele Ewars 6-0, 6-2. No. 2 Mary Colligan demolished Bonnie Salata 6-I, 6-0. Lisa LaFratta won 6-1, 6-0, over Lisa Parenti at No. .3. 
Cathy Schnell, playing No. 4, over­whelmrd Chris Molek 6-4, 6-2. Camille Cooper had an easy time with Linda Hahes 6-I, 6-4, and Lisa Gleason took adavantage of her chance to play singles hy downing 
Jamie O'Connell 6-I, 6-1. 
The douhles teams fared just as well with each duo hreezing to vic­tory. Leading the way was the No. I team of Colligan and LaFratta who heat DePaul's hest, Ewers and Parenti 6-0, 6-1. Winners at No. 2 were Greta Roemer and Schnell 6-0 6-I over Salata and O'Connell: Finishing off the team sweep was Louisa De,\lello and Gleason who overpowered the team of Molek and Tauras 6-2,6-0 in a very quick match. 
Coach Sharon Petro agrees that the team has inproved, "We are het­ter tnan last year, nut tt shan.! to tell how much hy killing the weaker teams. Hut unlike in the past, we keep concentrating against the easier teams, and that makes me hap­py," she explained. The coach was especially impressed with the play 
of Camille Cooper and Lisa LaFratta, whom Petro said "has improved im­mensely, even since the beginning of the year." 
The young Irish are becoming markedly more confident and relaxed ;m the court with each vic· ton·. The women have a tough match coming up Saturd.ty morning against Purdue, who finished t1fth in the Big Ten last year. The match starts at 9:00 at the Courtney Tennis Courts. 
Got brotherly revenge 
Larkin tills linebacker role 
By LOUIE SOMOGYI 
Sports Writer 
Like many people, sophomore linebacker Mike Larkin prohahly doesn't like to say "I told you so." Last Saturday night, though, he greatly wanted to emphasize a per­sonal belief. 
"My brother enrolled as a fresh­man this year at Michigan," he points out. "He had a chance to come here on a football scholarship this year, but he opted to play basehall for Michigan instead. 
"I wanted to show him that he should have come here," he says, smiling. 
The younger Larkin may someday well become a major force for the powerful Wolverine basehall team, but for now it is his older brother 
who is enjoying his role as a new 
blossoming force on the Notre 
Dame defensive unit, one which 
limited Michigan to 41 yards rushing 
in .36 attempts. 
His team-leading I I tackles against Michigan was outstanding in itself, hut was made all the more im­pressive when you realize that for most ofthe fall he had been nursing a secondary shoulder separation. 
"I started doing some real practic­ing the week before the Michigan game," explains the 6-1, 209-pound Larkin, "hut I was preparing myself mentally all along hy watching things like their game films to he prepared. 
"I wanted to play the Michigan game more than any other game this year because of the way they had embarrassed us the previous year on national television." 
Tri-captain and fellow linehacker Mark Zavagnin was certainlv one who was not leery ahout the ~opho­more making his starting dehut despite minimal practice time in the 
tall. 
"He's just a natural talent," praises the senior All-America prospect. "I knew and the coaches sure knew from his spring practice perfor­mances that he would he a very intr­
icate part of our defense especially with his great quickness." Linehacker coach George Kelly echos the praises. 
"Mike is extremely quick and we rely on it deeply for such things as the blitz. But he can also he pretty physical on that field when the situa-

Logan Center game: Saturday's highlight 
"" 
Saturday night, Gerry Faust's foothall team showed the world that things were hack to normal. 
It wasn't just that the Irish made Michigan, a team which had embarrassed them in 198I, look like a had Pop Warner team. But in defeating a highly regarded opponent, the players and coaching staff exhihited character and determination, attrihutes that Notre Dame has made its trademark over the decades. At­
trihutes that were conspicuous hy their ahsence in 198I. 
Earlier that afternoon, I8 haskethall players and a host of hehind-the-scenes saints showed that win or lose, the important thin~s at Notre Dame never change. 
Assemhled under th• north dome of the Athletic and Convocation Center were the greatest hasketball players in Notre Darr.e history. Two were throwhacks to the Austin Carr , ra: Sid Catlett and the very man many claim gave de ACC (Austin Carr Coliseum) its name. The rest wt re Digger Phelps' hoys, along with Moose Krause, " ho coached one team. All owned Notre Dame degr.:es. 
Granted, a couple of names out of the past -Tom Hawkins, Bob Arnzen and CollisJones, to name three­weren't suited up. But the fans were treated to the school's Nos. I, 2 and 4 all-time scorers in Carr, Adrian Dantley and Kelly Tripucka. They also saw the top nine players fom the I 978 Irish, the only team in the school's history to reach the Final Four. as well as four of the starters in what arguably was college basketball's greatest moment, the 71-70 victory that snapped UCLA's never-to-be-matched 88-game winning streak in I974. 
If somebody could have bottled the nostalgia that permeated the ACC, which in its brief, 14-year life, has hous<:d more of what Digger calls "moments" than any other snake pit in the country, Congress would have to enact an obscene windfall-profits tax for the Bookstore. 
The players never forget, and if any of them had the mistaken notion that some of the fans might have, that was taken care ofduring introductions. 
Once the game started, the fans held their breath when Dwight Clay, a little more roly-poly,perhaps, hut no more bashful, loaded up in the right corner. And when the ball snapped through the nets, the crowd ex­ploded, relieved that Clay was no less deadly now than 

when he terrorized the iikes of UCLA and Marquette. 
But for all of Gary Brokaw's outside magic and John Shumate's inside magic; for all of Duck Williams' line­drive swishes and Adrian Dantley's French pastry; for all of Dave Batton's top-of-the-key jumpers and Kelly Tripucka's song-and-dance, the real show started at halftime. 
That's when two teams from Logan Center, which was the henetkiary of this day's wonderful generosity, trotted onto the floor. You can rest assured that the emotions generated in the ACC during those 10 minutes exceeded those found later that night in Notre Dame Stadium. And that's a mouthful. 
The kids put on a show. Not in a relative manner, and not all things considered. That wa~ entertainment. 
And the fans were just as fahulous. If they had heen lured into their seats by the prospect of watching a galaxy of Notre Dame haskethall stars, that was quickly forgotten at halftime. No doubt Digger would like to have such loud and lively tans next time he hrings fair­field into the ACC. 
But the moment of the day, and I do mean day, came at game's end. The audience let loo~e with a prolonged standing ovation, while the Notre Dame players, reappearing on the court to start the second half, mingled with their thrilled counterparts from the Logan Center. If there was a dry eye in the house, it helonged to someone who had the poor judgement to he in the restroom at the time 
"To me, that just shows what people are like at Notre Dame," said Phelps, who, along with Special Projects Director Jim (;ihhons and Assistant Athletic Director Roger Valdiserri, provided invaluable assistance to co­chairmen Brokaw and Shumate. 
Phelps' former players, who realize how important 
Logan Center is to him, made the day possihle. But eight ofthem with NBA contracts-Dantley, Tripucka, Tracy Jackson, Orlando Woolridge, Bi .II Hanzlik, Bill Laim­beer, Bruce Flowers and Tohy Knight -made a remarkable sacrifice. Each of them signed a waiver, releasing his NBA team of its obligation to honor the contract in the event of an injury during the game. 
For Knight, who flirted with NBA stardom with the New York Knicks hefore succumbing to severe knee prohlems over the past two seasons, the gesture nearly bordered on the foolish. 
"I told Tohy that if he felt anything at all, to get out of there," Phelps said. "But he just smiled at me and said, 'Coach, I'm all right.' 
"I was really nervous ahout him, hut he played his heart out-they all did." 
After the game, the players' jerseys were auctionnl off, with Tripucka's bringing in SHOO, and Woolridge's going for S520. 
The event's founding fathers will sit down in the future and determine where to go from here. 
''I'm afraid to do it every year," Phelps said. "The patrons paid S2'; a seat, and you'd hate to put the hite on them every year. Mayhe we'll try and do it every second or third year. 
"The guys want to do it every year. They all thought it w;ts great. And then at hreaktast Sunday morning they started telling war stories." 
Phelps also took a little time to reminisce on hi~ I I years at Notre Dame. 
"It's hard to believe they've all come and gone." he said. "I'm starting to ft:ellike ,\loose. But it goes to show that people who have heen a part ofNotre Dame basket· hall can come hack here and he a part of~omething like this, just like the National Championship ti>Otball teams." 
Based on the on-the-court success of hi~ team~. there is no denving that Phelps has huilt one of the nation·~ elite baskethall programs. But this was a day to put things in a different perspective. 
"You've got to he proud that, a~ successful a~ the\· are. the players are still human enough to re.alize that not everyone is as hlessed as they are. and then go out and do something about it," reflected Phelps. 
It would take a lifetime of I 0-1 ~season~ to era~e that kind of a program.
