Jack Ford visits ND-SMC; talks on issues, problems 

Barbara Breitenstein Senior Staff Reporter 

Campaigning on behalf of his father, Jack Ford visited the Notre Dame-St. Mary's community yes­terday and talked with students in an hour long question-and-answer session in Stepan Center last night. 
Answering often pointed ques­tions from the audience of over 1000 students and guests, Ford covered such campaign issues as forced busing, the Nixon pardon, the jobs situation and energy. 
Ford stated his intention was to "speak for my father," but "dif­ferences between us exist, as they do between father and son," he said, and he often included his own opinions when answering. 
The questioning opened with the accusation that ''Ford hides Nixon crimes." Jack Ford replied, "1 assume you're talking about the Nixon pardon," which he called "a very cold, pragmatic decision" for the "better future of America."

Emphasizing "total concern" on the part of the Student Body Congress. Student Body President Mike Gassman and Special Projects Director Tom Soma have proposed the continuation of the removal of dining hall wastes by George Brown. 
The resolution, affirmed by over 60 student government officials at the meeting of the congress Wed­nesday night, calls for either the reinstatement of Brown's old waste removal orocedure, or some comp­
rimise which will still allow the pig sity will not have to compromise farmer to collect garbage after the their sanitation standards in order dinner meal. to reinstate Mr. Brown's service." After weighing the sanitary and Calling the proposal "a. viable

sincere effort is made, the univer­be continued,'' he added. 
The measure states that "any other decision'' besides some con­tinuation of Brown's service ''would be in opposition to the moral character of this university.'' Among those listed as supporting the resolution were Gassman, Stu­dent Body Vice-President Mike 
, Casey, HPC Chairman J.P. Rus­sell, all class officers, and every hall president. 
The proposal was personally presented to Price by Gassman and Soma am! a copy was sent to University Presiroent Theodore Hesburgh, prefacd by a letter calling the measure a "unified student request." The stand marks the first-major product of the Student Body Congress since its inception last spring and repre­sents the culmination of student concern over the issue thus far. 
The controversy arose earlier in the 'month when Price announced that Brown would no longer be allowed to haul away dining hall garbage to feed his pigs. Soma and

the matter but had arrived at an impasse. 
Ford said his father had to 
"strike a balance" in dealing with 
Vietnam draft resisters and desert­
ers, in consideration for ''those 
people who lost sons forever.'' 
One student questioned Ford 
extensively on his stand on abor­
tion, which Ford said is "not a 
political issue." After several pres­
sing questions, Ford asked if the 
student would mind letting him 
answer someone else's question. 
But, Ford told him, "You have 
stimulated me so that I will dig into 
it a great deal more." 
Ford also discussed opening up the job market, particularly for college students. "We have a unique situation," he explained, ''because there has been a massive acceleration of two groups into the job market, and that's women and those young people who have decided not to go to college.'' 
"For specifically college stud­ents,''' Ford continued, ''when you look at it, the area that probably offers the greatest career opportun­ities is in the private sector. There. people have the opportunity not to just work for the sake of work, but in the career er field they choose," he said. 
Jobs in this "private sector," would be "jobs for the future," according to Ford, while public works jobs would cost the taxpayer $25,000 per job and last "at the whim of the legislature's initia­tive." 
"It's not a single problem," Ford said. "but a whole combina­tion of factors that mesh in a complex manner." 
Ford spoke at length on the energy problem. In response to a question about President Ford's energy policy and strip mining, Ford replied, "The administration proposed a 16-point program that dealt with the maximization of present available resources. About five or six of the 16 passed, so of course. we were left without a comprehensive energy program." 
"We have given this special interest," Ford explained, "but it will take time to initiate such a program." 
"As far as strip mining goes," he continued, "I believe we can minimize the ecological damage of strip mining if we're careful, until we do have solar energy and geo-thermal production. But, I would rather see us use strip mining instead of nuclear reac­tors.'' 
Ford said he believes those forcing busing "have lost the purpose of what they were trying to do," and said court-ordered busing "does not necessitate quality edu­cation." He said the money now used to pay for gasoline and bus drivers should be used to upgrade the facilitks available.

She also pointed out that the dictionary contains definitions of common, four-letter vulgarisms besides the words with offensive slang connotations. 
Supts. Larry W. Crabb says "seven or .eight copies" of the dictionary were restricted for use by college-bound 12th grade pupils at 550 student Hanover Central High School. 
"I don't see it as necessarily permanent," Crabb said of the board's decision. But he said he'll abide ·by it unless the three mem­ber policy committee he serves on comes up with a different recom­mendation. 
''Part of the problem is there's a lack of written board policy in this whole area." added Crabb, ex­plaining that the committee is going to turn its attention to the issue of censorship as a "priority" matter. 
If we would have had a clear policy adopted publicly, we prob­ably wouldn't have had this prob­lem." 
Until that time, Crabb said the dictionaries will be stored in the principal's office. 
A 93-signature petition asking the board to rescind its order was presented this week. a move that Cedar Lake resident. Barbara Sack described as only a "small protest . .. just to let them know we didn 't approve of the way they were doing things.'' 
"I have one girl who's a senior," said Mrs. Sack, "and they think the whole thing is ridiculously silly." 
"I don't know what kind of a person looks in the dictionary to find dirty words. Before it was just a dictionary, but now someone's made it into a dirty book."

I couldn't even think of words to say to her, though I knew afterwards what those words should have been. I should have said: ''If you want anything, just whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you?

movie called "To Have and Have Not". I cot!ld have said them to her: me, the ex-kid from the fishing village in Maine, saying to Lauren Bacall: "If you want anything. just whistle."

I left the theatre humming the "Merry Widow" waltz. and walked up to Broad­way; and down through Times Square, there was a choreography to the traffic on the sidewalk, as though pimps and prositutes and passers-by were waltzing wgether in perfect rhythms. It was a lovely evening in New York, and the world was lit up for old Lauren and me. At 47th Street, an electric sign flashed a greeting from Castro Covertible, and we were winked at by some theatre bulbs on the Palace marquee. ~

For me. the ballet was over. the dancing had ended. There were no merrv widows. except the ones we hear of in a ~-altz, and the Beautiful People had all gone home.

Jack, the president's son, campaigning in loco parentis 

EDITOR'S NOTE: The following interview with Jack Ford, the president's son, was conducted in two parts by OBSERVER editor Thomas O'NeU. Some of the questions were asked in a closed press conference, others were asked at the fund raising reception held at St. Mary's. They have been combined here and presented in interview form. 
OBSERVER: Do you see any inconsistency in your father's pardon of Richard Nixon and his refusal to pardon draft dodgers? 
FORD: Well, I take a little different point of view than him in terms of the amnesty program and draft dodgers. I'd like to see continuing efforts in that area. I think it was a tremendous gesture on the part of my father, even if it only gave one person the opportunity to come back and rejoin their family or just come back to the United States. I think we have to consider the program a success because it helped that one person. I would like to see it a little more expanded. In the case of the Nixon pardon, I think that was a very hard, cold, pragmatic decision. We had gone th~ough about two years of total stagnation in the federal government and it just got to the point where we had to say what we had to say, that we're going to address ourselves to the problems that really affect the quality of life and the people in this country, the standard of living, and the economic and social situation which was beginning to fester in this country, or are we going to recriminate ourselves and suffer for another possible two years in terms of the whole Watergate affair? As President. and as a man who felt responsi­bility to 214 million other people in this country. the quickest and most expedient course in trying to get this country off dead-cellter and start to address ourselves to some of those problems was basically the rationale behind my father's pardon of President Nixon. I think it's been success­ful to that extent. I think Leon Jaworski agreed first of all that he could never get a fair trial here in the United States, and that the needs of the country were better served by putting the possibility of the trial behind us or out of the picture as quickly as possible. Even Senator Humphrey agreed with that and said that the time was right and that it needed to be done. I think

people who have a good· understanding have generally tended to agree. 
OBSERVER: The role of relatives in a political campaign bas always been a dubious one. At present South Bend bas Mondale's brother, Carter's aunt Sissy, and yourself. Do you have hesitations about saying "I think this, but my father says this"? 
FORD: I don't have any hesitations at all. You know, one thing that's probably, in­terms of our family, been really tremen­dous is that whether it's been my statements or my mother's remarks or so forth, the first guy to stand up and support

us and say "I brought them up to think and speak for themselves" is my father. He's encouraged us to do exactly that, and I think that shows a great deal of character on his part as a human being, beyond the fact that he's President and he's trying to get elected and all those other factors. I like the idea of a man who can put those considerations above his own personal considerations ... 
OBSERVER: Don't you have trouble 
articulating an issue that doesn't include your own opinion, but rather your father's? 
FORD: I don't have any reservations. I'm here to talk about his opinions and his points of view and I'd rather try to dwell on those and stay away from my own opinions because mine have very little relevance, I think. in terms of problems this country faces. 
OBSERVER: In your brother Mike's interview with the Boston Globe this week he said that the President's children might be relieved if your father didn't win re-election. What is your own feeling on that? 
FORD: Well, I think, as a son to a father there's no doubt that your personal selfish desires are that you don't want him to be president. You see the guy being up at five o'clock in the morning as you stumble in that night. Other times he is up all night on things like the Lebanon evacuation and that kind of thing. When you look at it in the terms of the father-son relationship, you say "Who needs it?" But again you have to temper it with the fact that somebody does have to be president. So let's have the best. 
OBSERVER: Your brother Michael also said that your father wouldn't be all that upset if he lost the election in November. 
FORD: I don't think the presidency obsesses him. maybe in the sense that it has some of the past presidents. I think this is a good difference. I think it's a very 
important difference that we get away from that idea of obsession with the office, that maybe some of our past presidents have had. And maybe if it took having the president obsessed, then we have to admit that there might be some small flaw in our electorate process that lets mavbe the ambitious man instead of the be~t man bl I the president. , 
OBSERVER: Many politkal t;xperts arel saying that it's important for both leading presidential candidates to court the Catho­lic vote. Is your visit to Notrl' Dame-St. Mar_y's part of that courtship? 
FORD: I've campaigned at a great many places in Indiana and all around the United States and Notre Dame is one that I hadn't got to in the primaries. 
OBSERVER: What do )'Ou think of the Pla)'boy interview with Carter? 
FORD: The press does have a tendency to overreact. to jump on single isolated words or phrases and what not. but at the same time he said it. not me. 
OBSERVER: Do you think that's Indicative of anything deeper? Of some hidden sentiment beneath his e\·angelicalism? 
FORD: It is something that makes me a little uncomfortable. Where does that separation between church and state and all those issues come to bare'! Really. I don't think that he's made that verv clear to the American people. I'm a little uncomfortable about what he saYS. not that he's a religious man. but the way he manages to intertwine a great deal of his campaigning and his politics. 
OBSERVER: What do you see as Carter's most vulnerable area in terms of the issues? 
FORD: I think it's his own credibility. 
OBSERVER: Thank you, Mr. Ford.

On a fourth and S play from the 6-yard line Badin's defense stop­ped Farley.

On the next play Erin Burns bolted from the line of scrimmage and outdistanced the Breen-Phillips de­fense to score a 37-yard touch­down. The extra point was no good. 
Breen-Phillips appeared to have tied the game when Beth Conlisk scored on a 60-yard touchdown pass from Kate Sarb. But the play was called back because of a clipping penalty. 
Lewis' second touchdown was set up on a controversial play. Nanci Kelly returned a punt 43 yards to move the ball to the Breen-Phillips 21-yard line.

The Notre Dame varsity baseball team will again attempt to open its fall schedule this Sunday with a doubleheader against Indiana State at Notre Dame's Kline Field. 
The Irish were rained out of four contests last weekend at Bradley and Indiana State. On Saturday Notre Dame jumped to a 1-0 lead in the first inning on a lead-off single by sophomore shortstop Rick Pul­lano and an RBI ground-rule dou­ble by senior captain Stan Bobow­ski. Starting pitcher Mike Bobinski held Bradley scoreless in the bottom of the first before the field was ruled unplayable due to the steady downpour.

Sports Writer 

A few weeks ago a federal court judge, ruling on the case of former Redskin Jim (Yazoo) Smith, ruled that the National Football League's system of drafting graduating college football players was illegal. Despite many mher court rulings on the subject of player mobility there have been no drastic changes of the present system of allocating talent. 
The drafting system that the judge struck down was one that allowed teams to select, in an inverse order of the previous season's standings. players who had completed their college eligibility. Each team picked one .player for a designated number of rounds. While football was the first sport to adopt this method, all professional sports in American use it today. 
The players selected in the draft could negotiate with only the team that had picked them. Those eligible players who had not been selected could barter with whomever they pleased. 
From the owners point of view this is quite equitable. Teams that drafted poorly often played poorly. Astute selections. however. turned teams from patsies to contenders. Mr. Art Roonev's Pittsburgh Steeler organiza­tion is an example of this. Pitt"h··· 3h went frum-cellar dwellers in 1969 to Super Bowl champions in 197S by stockpiling young talent. Draft choices were a marketable 
commodity. 

How many trades have been made for the infamous 
"undisclosed draft choice"? George Allen continues to 
patch his Redskin troops by obtaining veteran players for 
draft choices. Differences in the level of talent of the 
various teams is attributable to the ineffectiveness of ,the 
general managers of some teams. not an inequality in the 
system. 

From the players point of view however. the drafting system is anything but equitable. Since r.p'.. ·m owns 
the rights to a drafted player. there IS no cOinpetnve 
bidding. Granted, the players are earning a good living. 
but they could receive more in an open market situation. 
But money is only one consideration. Players would 
prefer to try teams where they could, first of all, make the 
team and. possibly. start. What player would relish the 
thought of having to surpass a Jack Lambert or a Chuck 
Foreman to win some playing time? Another problem is that 
players are often selected by teams far from the player's 
home area. Not many ballplayers from a warm climate 
would prefer playing in the colder climate. Also. if a player 
is drafted and he refuses to report. how long is he bound to 
the team that selected him? Until recently these problems 
were shunted aside. 
How does one modify the system of selecting talent so 
that both owners and players are satisfied? One way wou1u be to allow more than one team to draft any player. Baseball is experimenting with a version of this when they conduct their free agent draft. Each free agent will be drafted by up to 12 teams and the player can make his choice. One problem with this is that the resulting higher salaries will cause an increase in ticket prices. Chicago Bear General Manager Jim Finks believes that an open market will lead to off-season roster limits to prevent a great imbalance in talent. 
One proposed answer that may be suitable for all sport~ is a draft the way it is now with a time limit given to thL· drafting team for holding the right to any player.
