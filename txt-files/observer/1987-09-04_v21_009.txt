NO sets new policy to curb DUI offenses: 
on and off campus 
By KENDRA MORRILL Senior Staff Reporter 

In an attempt to curb alcohol­related accidents, the Univer­sity has instituted a new policy to deal with Notre Dame stu­dents caught driving while in­toxicated. 
The policy sets down sanc­tions ranging from forfeiture of parking privileges to suspen­sion from the University. 
The details of the policy are explained in a letter to students from Father David Tyson, vice president for Student Affairs. 
Alcohol-related accidents in the last several years involving students both as victims and drivers prompted the new policy, the letter said. 
The policy was recommen­ded by an ad hoc committee of students, faculty members and administrators, the letter states. 
The policy will apply to ar­rests occurring both on and off campus. 
On campus arrests will be conducted by Notre Dame Se­curity, who will file the arrest reports with the state aut­horities and with the Office of Residence Life. 
When driving in locations off campus, students cited for a DUI offense "can expect the matter to be handled by the ap-

Forest fires continue to rage 
Associated Press 
Scorching temperatures and steady winds fanned a plague of fire across parts of six West­ern states Thursday, consum­ing hundreds of thousands of acres of brush and timber and threatening California's tower­ing sequoias. 
Jack Wilson, director of the Boise Interagency Fire Control Center, called the situation "extremely critical, primarily in California and southwest Oregon." 
"In the national park situa­tion, we're very fearful that they might get into the giant sequoias, which are an ir­replaceable resource," he said. 
California, Oregon and Idaho bore the brunt of the fires. By mid-day Thursday: 
-12,975 firefighters were bat­tling 1,116 fires which had burned more than 204,000 acres in California. 
-3,500 people fought fires totaling 52,000 acres in Oregon. 
-600 firefighters contended with 23,000 acres of range and forest fires in Idaho.

spawned by late-summer thun­derstorms. 
"It continues to be a critical situation," said La Von Perez of the U.S. Forest Service in Cal­ifornia. "The forecasters say we're not going to get as many lightning strikes today, but they said that yesterday, too, and we had more than 1,400 ad­ditional strikes and we are ex­pecting winds of 20 to 35 mph, and they tell us it will not begin to cool until the weekend." 
An estimated 8,000 persons were evacuated from nearly a dozen rural communities in California, more than half of them in Tuolumne County near the northern entrance to

propriate local civil author­ity," the policy states. 
According to Tyson, there is "no official communication be­tween the police and the Uni­versity." The Office of Student Affairs could learn of off campus DUI arrests through a medium such as Security Beat, which is a matter of public record, he said. 
A student whose blood alco­hol level is above the legal limit will be cited or arrested. 
The University will revoke parking privileges for a stu­dent's first offense. Convicted students will also be required to participate in an alcohol edu­
cation program.  
Students  will  face  a  one­ 
semester  suspension  for  a  

second offense. 
To be readmitted to Notre Dame, offenders must receive clearance from the University alcohol counselor. 
Students who are readmitted will forfeit all driving and parking privileges on campus. In addition, offenders may be required to participate in a con­tinuing alcohol counseling pro­
gram. 

If death or mJury results · from an alcohol-related acci­dent; the offender may be sub­jected to additional sanctions, Tyson said.

Pilot hangs out plane to survive wild ride 
Associated Press 
PORTLAND, Maine -A 
pilot who clung to the rear 
stairs of a small plane after 
a door opened in flight says 
he was "thrilled to see the 
sunrise" after landing safe­
ly, but declined to say any 
more Thursday about the 
freakish accident. 
"There was no mechani­cal fault with the door," and the plane was returned to service, Steven Mason, sales manager of Eastern Ex­press, told a news confer­ence Thursday. He said the company was investigating the possibility that it had not been properly closed. 
Henry Dempsey, 46, of Cape Elizabeth, the pilot who lay on the stairway door, suffered only scratches on his hand in the bizarre accident, after which his hands had to be "pried off" the plane's stair railings. 
Dempsey declined all in­terviews but said throu h

the company he was still stunned by the "harrowing experience." 
Dempsey was piloting a 15-seat Beechcraft 99 tur­boprop, with no passengers aboard, from Lewiston, Maine, to Boston early Wed­nesday evening when he heard a rattle in the back of the plane. The twin-engine commuter plane was being flown to Boston to be used for a flight from there, Mason said. 
As he walked back to check on the noise, the aircraft hit some turbulence and he leaned against the stairway door. The door, which is hinged at the bot­tom, fell open and Dempsey was partially sucked out of the plane. He grabbed the railings and lay upside down on the stairs as the plane traveled at 190 mph at 4,000 feet. 
"He was partly in the aircraft and partly out," said Mason.

In Brief 
Bill Cosby may be TV's top funnyman, but back in high school in Philadelphia he kept his wit hidden from all but his friends, says an old classmate. "He was primarily interested in track and field then," said James DePreist, who went to Philadelphia Central High School with Cosby. DePreist, the conductor of the Oregon Sym­phony Orchestra, said Cosby recently called him to ask if the orchestra would perform the theme song for Cosby's hit NBC show next year. DePreist said the theme music by Stuart Gardiner will be recorded in Portland. -Asso­ciated Press

Me go on a diet? Go hungry? Fat chance! 
Back off. I am on a diet. 
I am not kidding. I am grumpy and ag­gravated because I am h~.mgry; and when I am hungry, do not mess with me. 
This all started at the beginning of this week when I finally admitted to myself that I need to start cutting down on my usual voluminous food consumption and start trimming down. Of course, I came to this realization after I woke up Monday morning and could only see my "love handles" in the mirror one at a time be­cause of their overwhelming size. 
Despite my desire to slim down the old carcass, realizing the need for and committing to a diet did not come easy. I am one of those people who loves to eat. I like candy and cake and chicken patties and burgers; I especially like cheese popcorn (as most everyone who works with me knows) in the late hours of the night. 
On top of this love for food, I like to have a beer or two on the weekends with friends. I'm 21, mind you, but I think the weight that I gain from my trips to Senior Bar will be more harm­ful than any South Bend citation for '!minor in a tavern." 
Because I work a great deal and jog whenever possible, I have been able to keep my weight relatively stable, even though I love to eat. Grabbing a late night pizza or burger has never been a real problem. Stuffing down a bag of cheese popcorn while working at night or gul­ping down a doughnut in my office during the day I could handle. 
But recently things have changed. For the worse, I might add. 
My middle is getting middler and my tush is getting tushier. I have a spare tire that could fix a tractor and an appetite King Henry VIII would be ashamed of. In the light of my personal growth (to speak euphemistically), I have decided to cut down and lose some of this burlap baggage before my girlfriend steps in and demands a reduction. 

I must confess that as an avowed hater of diets, I, of course, tried to take the easy way out one month ago. I signed up for an appoint­ment at Body Reflections, a new salon in town that specializes in "figure correction." If anyone's figure needs correcting, mine does. 
So I went to this place and was wrapped in Ace bandages soaked in aloe from head to toe. Yes, I did have a cute wrappist; and yes, the trip to the figure correcting salon was very relaxing. But, NO, my figure was not correct after my trip to the spa. All I got from my aloe wrap was a smooth skin and a humiliating chuckle from someone who saw me come out of the place. 
Kevin Becker 

Editor-in-Chief 


At this point, I have reduced myself to eating soups and salads at meals; a hungry sniff of the air has replaced my diving in for seconds of the "fast fare" selection at lunch. I still drink Diet Coke, but I no longer use it to wash down potato chips or cheese popcorn. 
And the temptation does not stop at meals and the dining hall. While working at the news­paper late at night, seeming hoards of pizza and burgers are paraded past my salivating mouth by those graced with the gift of skinni­ness. A bag of fries for him; a slice of pepperoni for her; and no weight gain for either one. Why do I have to be the one who looks at food and gains weight while others can lose weight just by expending the energy it takes to chew? 
I guess it is one of those unanswerable mys­teries, one of those things that I just have to live with. 
But do me one favor as I sit here and wallow in my misery. Do not come up to me, staring at my belly which is well hidden under my col­lecti_on of bag9y shirts, and say, "My God, Kevm, you don t look that fat. Why are you on a diet?" 
Making this hungry person more miserable may just lead to having your face chewed off.

Police to try new special drunk driving solution 
Associated Press 
ANDERSON, Ind.-Madison County authorities are using modern science to battle the problem of drunken driving, giving repeat offenders an op­portunity to avoid jail and the loss of their driver's licenses by having Breathalyzer mac­hines placed in their cars. 
"We need local solutions to 
1 ease overcrowding in the jails and prisons, and we think this program can be an effective one," said Madison County Deputy Prosecutor Tom Clem, who has investigated the use of a similiar program in Califor­nia. 
The first Breathalyzer was installed in an offender's car Thursday and Clem expects three more to be installed in the near future. 
Madison County Judge Larry Robbins said he agreed to the unique sentence after discuss­ing it with Clem and the defense attorney for the of­fender. 
The program allows those charged with drunken driving to have an alcohol measuring machine installed in their ve­hicle. In order to start the car up, the device requires a breath test. If the person's alcohol level is above 0.3, the car won't start. 
"In this case the defendant needed a license to earn a living," Robbins said. "It seems to me the intent of legis­lation involving drunk driving The offender isn't required to is to keep the offender off the install the device, but it is road or modify their behavior. available to those willing to pay This program seems to meet for the expense of installing the needs of the public by and renting the equipment, keeping a driver off the road if Robbins said. his blood alcohol level is too high. "This is a real good system. 

It has been thoroughly tested 
"It also saves the taxpayer in California and the program money by keeping (offenders) is in operation there," Clem out of jail and allows them to said. "I have four people being keep working, contributing to offered it as an alternative, in­the economic benefit of their cluding the one who had it in­families." stalled today.

NTSB flight investigation cites Delta pilots at fault 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Delta Air Lines pilots who flew their plane off course across the North Atlantic and nearly col­lided with another jet made no attempt to verify their location and had no oceanic charts showing their assigned route, investigators disclosed Thursday. 
The National Transportation Safety Board also said a Canadian investigation into the July 8 incident determined that the Delta jetliner actually came within 30 feet of colliding with a Continental Airlines jumbo jet after flying 60 miles off course. 
Previously, it had been esti­mated that the two planes had come within about 100 feet of each other 31,000 feet over the North Atlantic. The two planes were carrY.ing nearly 600 people. 
The NTSB, expressing con­cern about the failure of the flight crew to verify its flight path across the Atlantic, sent an urgent recommendation to the Federal Aviation Adminis­tration to make such verifica­tion mandatory. 
It said flight crews should be required to use at least two techniques for verifying a plane's computerized route before takeoff and employ at least three other verification technques during flight. 
Currrent FAA advisories to airlines recommend, but do not require, that flight crews make en route verification of naviga­tional data during cross­oceanic flights where aircraft are not covered by ground­based radar. 
In the case of the Delta flight, the safety board said the crew "did not plot their present or predicted positions upon cross­ing waypoints, or perform other (flight) track verification priV'eciures while en route."

Alcoholic explains trials and triumphs 

This conversation took place at the end of my freshman year: Dede:Gary, if you're going to play "Pass-Out," your're going to have to drink. Gary:No, that's okay, I don't want to drink. Dede:Come on, one little drink won't hurt you! Gary:Yes it will -in more ways than you can imagine. De de: Look, the drink isn't even that strong. There's more orange juice in it than Schnapps. Gary: I don't care how much is in it, I'm not going to drink anything with even a little Schnapps in it. Dede:Not even a little sip? 
y:ary:No. Dede: (with a smile on her face) Then I'll give you a choice; either you drink or you leave. Gary: (to everyone in the room) Goodbye, I'll see all of you later. 
Gary Gerlacher 
guest column 

I had called her bluff, and I stood up as I prepared to leave. When she saw that I was serious about leaving, she apologized and invited me back. I sat down again, and the game continued, but it just wasn't as fun anymore. Everyone was really uncomfortable with what had just taken place. 
I was happy and content though, be­cause I had won another battle in my war against alcoholism. Yes that's right, I'm an alcoholic, and a recover­ing one. I have not had a drink since the end of my senior year in high school -since February 14, 1986. 
Conversations like the one above take place quite often these days, in fact too often. But I've learned how to handle them. When faced with the choice of drinking or walking, I walk. This has not always been the case though. A year and a half ago, my answer could have been quite different. 
In fact, let's go all the way back to the beginning, to the start of my senior year of high school. Remember that year, the one that is supposed to be one of the best years of your life? I do -it was the worst year of my life. 
It started off great. My friends and I were having fun at school and at the big parties on the weekend. I was cap­tain of a soccer team that won a State Championship. I aced my SAT's and

got accepted to Notre Dame. Every­thing was just perfect. 
Then one day, my mother dropped a bomb on me. I was told by her that she is an alcoholic. At first I was shocked as you can imagine. Then I said, "Hey, it's okay. You were an alcoholic, and now the problem is over." I was never more wrong in my entire life. 
The problem weighed heavily on my mind, and it eventually became too much for me to deal with, and I cracked under the pressure. I went to see a coun­selor1>sychiatrist-shrink (whatever you want to call her) that dealt with the children of alcoholics. Her name was Kathy. 
Kathy and I spent many painful hours together talking about by past. My al­coholic parent was never one that used to beat me or abuse me when she was drunk. But the more Kathy and I delved into my past, the more I found that I had suffered emotionally and psyc­hologically as the child of an alcoholic. 
Well, one thing led to another, and after a great deal of painful counsell­ing, I came to realize that I was also an alcoholic. Admitting this to myself was the most painful thing that I have ever experienced. 
At this point, I completely cracked up. I just couldn't deal with everything, and the pressure got to me. I remember one day not too long after this that I skipped school to go skiing all day. It was an outlet for all of my anger. 
All day long I though about how un­fair life was, and I have never been more upset in my whole life. On the way home, I almost made a big mis­take. I was crying uncontrollably with anger, fear and rage. I sped my Camaro up until I was doing over 100 MPH. Then I was ready to just let go of the wheel. It seemed like the quickest and easiest solution to the problem -and it would have been. 
But it was the wrong solution. I realized this at the last moment, and I got the car under control, and drove home safely. That night I dropped the bomb on my parents -that I was anal­coholic. Now began the real battle. 
It wasn't that easy though. I started going to more counselling and less school. I couldn't deal with the pre­ssures of school and my drinking prob­lem at the same time, so I chose to concentrate on my drinking problem. 
Even more importantly though, I had to give up my friends and my social life. I stopped going to parties and after school events with them. I never gave them an explanantion for my actions, and for that I am sorry, but at the time it was the only thing I could do. 
But my family, Kathy, and a very special friend--MBS--stood by me all the way. They gave me the support that I needed, and eventually I was able to accept my identity as an alcoholic. 
Over the summer, I continued coun­selling. As I became more sure of who I was, I started to enter back into the social scene -but with a new set of friends. I went to a few parties, but not that many. 
When I was asked why I wasn't drink­ing, I would make up excuses like: "I'm driving," or "My parents caught me last week," or whatever. Anything I could think of to avoid the truth. 
The summer ended, and I was done with my counselling. I had resolved everything I needed to and was able to at the time. Now it was time to start over again with my new life at Notre Dame. 
Looking back, I realize that I had already left behind almost everything. All of my old· friends were no longer friends. They weren't enemies, but they weren't friends. All that I really had to look forward to was the future. 
My obvious problem was this: How would I handle the explanation of my alcoholism to my new roomate and friends? Kathy and I discussed this at length, and we decided that the best approach was to be honest from the beginning. 
I got my chance the second night here. All the Dillon freshmen went to a drinkfest--one of those things where anyone · who can still stand straight hasn't had enough. I went to it with my roomate and the two guys who lived next door. We arrived, and then the beer arrived. 
The moment of truth. I took my three new friends aside and laid it on the line for them -I was an alcoholic and I didn't drink anymore. I only gave them a lim­ited explanation at the time because of the circumstances, but it was enough. 
Luckily, the three accepted the fact right there. If they hadn't, things might have been much worse. But they turned out well. A few nights later, we had a long talk and I explained everything to them more fully. They accepted it. 
At the time of the party, however, it made me feel great. I had told them who I was and they had accepted it. Later that night, another freshman, Dave, forced me into the conversation of drink or walk. I had enough confi-

dence, however, to look him in the eye, and tell him that I was not going to drink. It was only through the support of my new friends that I was able to say this. 
So the year progressed. The rest of the guys in my section soon learned that I did not drink. They didn't learn the details, but they did not bother me about it. It was my choice whether or not I wanted to drink. 
Later in the year, I met a couple people who had also experienced al­coholics in their lives. These people replaced Kathy and MBS. My discus­sions with them became my outlet for pressure. 
This is very important to an alcoholic at Notre Dame. In case anyone out there has not noticed, drinking is the number one outlet for academic and social pressure at Notre Dame. I also need an outlet, but it cannot be drink­ing. My discussions were my outlet. 
On the other hand, I met some people like Dede. They harrassed me, and tried to pressure me into drinking. They thought I couldn't drink when in reality I could probably drink them under the table. But my not drinking was too much for some people, and they left me. 
This is fine by me. I have met quite a few girls this year who have lost in­terest in me because I don't drink. This is fine with me -it is their decision. 
But the next time you have an urge to do that, take a look at things from my point of view. I went through a lot of pain and suffering to get where I am today.·I refuse to relive that experience just to prove to someone that I can drink. Let's just say that I can drink (very well in fact), but I choose not to do so. 
So the next time you are at a party and someone doesn't want to drink, don't resort to peer pressure. Respect my decision not to drink just as I respect your decision to drink. I'm an alcoholic, and I always will be. But right now I'm beating the battle against alcoholism. With just a little help from all the people out there, all the other alcoholics and myself will be happy that you have made our battle just a little easier to win.

Letters to a Lonely God 


Ann Marie is family , of course: in my regard for her as an uncle, I am dazzled. She's an Estee Lauder girl, going to work at a fantastic Manhattan address, dressed to the teeth like a model. A New Yorker arti­cle last year told Mrs. Lauder's story: Ann Marie is part of the glamour of the cosmetics em­pire, in which Mrs. Lauder is a ruling monarch. At the annual Christmas party in the Waldorf­Astoria, Estee Lauder girls are treated only to champagne. They are furnished with sets of silver bells, which they jingle as an alternative to clapping. 
Three years ago, Ann Marie was a senior at Campus View, after living three years in Pasquerilla East. She kept steady company with an athlete in her class. Were they in love? Ann Marie never told me. A year after graduation, she be­came engaged to the boyfriend back home, who must have worried about her finally

eniors considering their post graduate options seem to be deluged with deci­sions these days. Should I get a job right away? What kind of job am I interested in? Should I forego life's conventionalities and live in the wilderness as a hermit? Should I go to grad­school? 
For those seniors considering the grad-school route, there are a number of opportunities available to win post-graduate scholarships, thus ridding a student of one of the most riveting of all senior questions: How am I going to pay for it? And for those Seniors possess­ing the right amounts of qualifications and fortitude, some of the most prestigious

doll with sawdust for a heart? God forbid; but who can ex­plain her--who can tell you why? Fools give you reasons; wise men never try. A friend of mine who worshipped her from afar used to send her red roses. Ann Marie was too much of a lady to hurt an admirer's feelings; but she asked me to discourage this young man when he wanted to send her bottles of wine. 
How much did she let the fellow on her right hand see of what his rival on her left hand was proposing? Not much, I suspect. She was a Notre Dame woman of whom much was expected; she was as honest as she could be without causing pain. If the Domer was hurt when she finally said goodbye, she wept because she couldn't make it easier for him. 
As the priest at the wedding. I will become emotional at the sight of Ann Marie, stunning in a bridal gown it took a year to 
academic awards in the world may well be in reach. 
Associate Dean of Notre Dame's College of Arts and Let­ters, Nathan Hatch speaks very enthusiastically about Notre Dame students' chances of ob­taining any number of post­graduate scholarships, al­though he acknowledges the need to be realistic when a stu­dent considers applying for one of the more distinguised awards. 
"You have to see it in per­spective," said Hatch. "Most graduate education is funded by individual universities. Usually, if someone is inter­ested In grad-school, 98 per cent of the time he or she will simply apply to a university to receive a fellowship or a graduate-assistanceship there." 
Still, Hatch points out. there are always a number of out­standing students each year who are qualified to obtain the premier national and interna­tional fellowships. 
"The competition for (the Rhodes and Marshall) makes getting into an Ivy League school seem simple," said Hatch. "The odds are In­credible, even for someone with exceptional talent and ac­complishment. That is not to say that someone shouldn't apply. Two years ago we had two students from Notre Dame win Rhodes Scholarships, which is a great accomplish­ment." 
Both of these scholarships are for study in Great Britain. There are .32 Rhodes and 28 Marshalls awarded annually in the United States. Rhodes Scholars study at Oxford, while

make. In a family of eight children, she is the only daughter. What can I tell her parents in the homily, to keep them cheerful on the day their radiant child leaves their home for the husband of her choice? When a father walks down the aisle to entrust his daughter to another man's keeping. quiet dramas take place that the wedding guests are unware of. One bride told me: "for years, whenever I dated, my father handed me a dime: 'Phone me, honey, if you need help.' During the wedding march, he said: 'Give me back my dime. From now on, your husband gets the phone calls for help."' 
Ann Marie and her mother are best friends; their friendship will deepen in the years ahead; but how long does it take a father to under­stand that he has not lost a daughter, but that he has gained a son? Ann Marie's par­ents, Bob and Ann, have a right to be proud: they have raised eight children; all of them, with their parents' help, are college graduates: two of them are lawyers, one is a Ph. D.; the others have good jobs. With Ann and Bob, their children came first. though that meant self-sacrifice year after year; incurring debt. and being there with whatever help the kids needed, a plane ticket. tuition, or a pat on the back. 
I have watched the children growing up. Each, in different ways, is wonderful; the country will be better for having them as Americans; the Church will be stronger, if they stay faithful to Christ. Ann and Bob should be blessed, because in a cen­tury busy inventing new forms of death, they dedicated them­selves to making an Investment In life. 
I am close to Ann Marie, one of the three siblings graduating from Notre Dame. I felt so honored when, as a student. she came by to show me her party dress, or to bring me cookies, or to reassure me, after her father had his heart attacks, that her mother was staying strong under the bur­den of stress. She used to let me see through her eyes what the campus was like for a coed. Her four years were over in the twinkling of an eye; after she left I dreamed of ways of getting her back. as a law or graduate student or as the Estee Lauder representative to South Bend, Indiana. 
Notre Dame was a part of Ann Marie's life that I helped them with; while she was here, I had a small part in Bob and Ann's parenting. We were so proud of her as an alumna, when she brought her gifts of goodness and beauty to the world capital of glamour, to show New York the special class a Domer from an Irish home has, to grace the day and the marketplace with. 
At the wedding. I hope to rise to the occasion with words that show love and apprecia­tion, not only for the bride and groom, but also for the families who helped prepare them to be spouses. As Ann Marie's uncle, close to her fa­ther, I should be careful not to say more, or less, than he wants me to say. To tell the 
wedd;n~ 
truth, it would be easier to turn the ceremony over to Jack's uncle, a Jesuit not apt to be­come maudlin In a way which would embarrass his relatives. Jack. the groom, and his bride­to-be, Ann Marie, both want me to receive their vows. I would hurt their feelings if I tried to hide in the pews. 
I really am shy about putting my thoughts into words. It is an honor to be part of someth­Ing as fine as this wedding. As an old hand at performing marriage services, I have rarely felt so close to the human love through which God's love is mediated. How can I make It clear to my family, in a way that will please them, that their kind of bonding Is holy? That word, "holy," could embarrass them; without It I am tongue­tied. All love Is of God; in loving each other, all of them have been obedient to the will of Christ; for people like us, religion doesn't get much bet­ter, or more explicit, or purer. The more I stress this, the more they will consider that I'm being glib and trite. 
Perhaps in her undergradu­ate years here, I should have encouraged Ann Marie to elope with her Domer, so that later, she wouldn't see me taking pratfalls as a clumsy-tongued preacher on her wedding day in Jersey. Of course the best man won. Here's three cheers for Ann Marie and Jack! I wish I had another niece like Ann Marie, whose hand the Domer could win: he was a good man too. He will be, I'm sure, one of the unseen guests at the

The Mellon Fellowships are for further study in any of the Humanities disciplines. About I 20 Melions are awarded each year to college seniors or recent graduates who are plan­ning careers of humanistic teaching and scholarship. Hatch readily advises qualified students to pursue the Mellon Fellowship. "Notre Dame has a

very good annual record for our students receiving Mel­Ions," said Hatch. "We've had two or three students win them for the past few years." 
Hatch encourages students who feel they are qualified to apply for these or any of the number of other more readily available post-graduate scholar­ships. But Hatch also warns that seniors need to decide soon if they plan to apply, as many of the application dead­lines are fast approaching and early completion may increase chances.

when the Irish host the Bul­
ldogs of Drake. Game time is 
7:30p.m. 

This is not the first time 
Notre Dame has played under 
the lights at home. Several 
matches have been played on 
the astroturf field of Cartier, 
with the last night match being 
played two years ago against 
Michigan State. But Grace, 
who does not like the artificial 
turf and dim lighting, did not 
allow night games last season. 
Krause field is covered with 
the natural stuff, and the light­
ing is far superior to that of 
Cartier. And Grace is excited. 
"When you play under the 
lights, it adds to the excite­
ment," says Grace. "It could 
be the same two teams, wea­
ther conditions, etc., but when 
you put it under lights, it gets 
the adrenaline flowing." 
An expected increase in at­
tendance also should help to 
pump up the players. After­
noon games on Alumni Field 
were poorly attended. Students 
either had classes or 
homework conflicting with the 
game times, and the Irish soc­
cer fans in the local South Bend 
community often had their own

games to play at the same 
time. The night games, though, 
are expected to increase the at­
tendence of both factions. 
"We should draw very well 
this year," says Grace. "We 
have a couple of Friday night 
games in front of football. 
Hopefully the campus and the 
community will come out and 
support us." 
But Grace realizes that night 
games are not the only draw 
needed to bring the crowds out. 
"Everything is going to be 
dictated on how well we do," 
he says. "No one is going to 
come out and watch a losing 
team -period. And we've got to 
win playing good teams." 
A look at the schedule shows that of the top 10 teams in the Great Lakes region preseason poll, the Irish play five of them -all at home. Indiana, ranked fourth in the region, will play a day contest at Krause on Sun­day, Sept. 13. The Hoosiers refused to play Notre Dame at home at night. 
Michigan State, ranked ninth in the region, will face the Irish on Friday, Sept. 18. That game has been designated as the Krause Field Dedication Game, with a halftime cere­mony honoring the former Notre Dame Athletic Director. 
Later in the season the Irish host Bowling Green (sixth in the region), Wisconsin 
(seventh) and Marquette (third). Missing from the schedule

this season are Akron (first in 
the region), runner-up in last 
year's NCAA tournament, 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee (eighth) 
and in-state rival Evansville 
(second). In place of the mis­
sing regional foes, the team has 
scheduled away matches with 
national powers such as UCLA, 
San Diego State and South 
Carolina-Spartanburg. 
Talk of an NCAA tournament berth for the squad still takes on a future flavor. With the way the selection process is ex­ecuted, the Irish, who are ranked tenth in the preseason poll, would most likely have to earn a first or second ranking in the Great Lakes region to get the bid. Still, it is not an impossible dream for this season. 
"Anything can happen," says Grace. "If we can win those home games we have, and if some other teams knock off some other teams, yeah, it would be a possibility. 
Before the expectations for this season's squad get too high, it must be noted that just four seasons ago an NCAA bid was an impossibility for the Irish soccer squad. Notre Dame's schedules were padded with small colleges and the teams lost to the major powers more often than they won. Since Grace has taken over, though, the program has grown rapidly. Just as it has outgrown Alumni Field.

CINCINNATI -An apparent rift has developed between Cin­cinnati Reds owner Marge Schott and leaders of the team's baseball operations, in­cluding Manager Pete Rose. 
Batting coach Billy DeMars, who has told the Reds he is leaving, is said to be the first victim, but not the last. 
First-base coach Tony Perez has replaced DeMars, whom Rose hand-picked in 1985. 
"It didn't come from me " said Rose, when asked who h~d first suggested that Perez take over at least part of the batting coach job. 
DeMars, who reportedly is paid about $80,000 a year as one of the major leagues' best-paid hitting coaches, announced last weekend he was leaving when the season ends after General Manager Bill Bergesch asked Perez to help work with some of the team's hitters. 
Bergesch said that he had ap­proached DeMars about giving up some of his role to Perez. "At that point, he didn't feel that they both should be working with hitters, so he just said let Tony do it," Bergesch said. 
"It can't help. It can't help," Rose said of the timing of the

In one of the best musical comedies produced in Europe during the early 1930's Clair pioneered a new music/sound film style, adding several dance sequences. The light-hearted, fast-paced plot centers around a man who wins a huge lottery, on­ly to discover that the winning ticket is in the pocket of a jacket that he has just ~tiven away. 
PLAYTIME (1967) Color, 108 min. Directed by Jacques Tali, France 
TUesday, September 8, 1987 9:00 pm A group of American women 
tourists, accompanied by Tali's comic Mr. Hulot character, con­front the complexities of life in 
ultramodern Paris. Tali's satire on the uniformity of city living is considered one of the most visually inventive films ever made. 


Batting coach change marks beginning of Reds' rift 
DeMars matter in the season's final month. "I would think that if someone was going to dis­miss a coach, they would con­sult with the guy who hired him. That's the way I would operate." 
DeMars had been Rose's bat­ting tutor in Philadelphia and Montreal, and has been given credit for the development of numerous hitters, including Tim Wallach, Larry Bowa and most recently, Eric Davis. 
The Columbus Dispatch re­ported that Cincinnati center fielder Eric Davis had gone to Schott to say that Perez had helped Davis with his hitting more than DeMars_ 
Rose, like DeMars, believes that Schott may have been be­hind the decision. 
"She seems like she has never liked Billy because of the money he makes," Rose said. "He's the highest-paid coach in baseball, if I'm not mistaken. He should be. He's reached the top of his profession." 

Schott, reached by telephone Wednesday at her office, denied any role in the DeMars matter, then abruptly hung up the phone on a reporter. 
"I've got nothing to do with it," she said. "Other than that, I'd rather not comment. Goodbye." 
Larry Doughty, the Reds' scouting director since 1982, also is threatening to leave the team, reportedly over a rift with Schott over her effort to curb expenses incurred by Doughty's scouting staff. Ber­gesch is trying to persuade Doughty to stay.

teams last year, is also a pos­sibility at center, as is fresh­man Jim Kinsherf who has been practicing at center. With Rokich injured, walk-on senior Dom Prinzivalli has been back­ing up Spruell at right tackle. 
Even with the line's depth 
problems, their work together this summer should help the linemen open up holes for the young running backs and give quarterback Terry Andrysiak enough time to get the ball to his targets. 
"Coach Yelovich has done an excellent job with us since the start, and tries to give us any advantage," said Lanza. "The unit came up this summer. 
There was conditioning by the team as a whole, and we prac­ticed running plays on our own, and offensive line drills. 
"Offensive line is not a glorified position. We get a lot of satisfaction seeing all the at­tention Tim Brown and the run­ning backs get because we know if they are getting notoriety, then we're doing a good job."

Grace will go with the same starting lineup he used against the Ramblers. Randy Morris and Tiger McCourt will lead the attack at forward; Joe Sternberg, Rolfe Behrje adn Kurt Roemer will control the 
midfield; John Guignon and Steve LaVigne will play the double stopper; Dave Augus­tyn, Steve Lowney and Danny Gordon form the back line; and Dan Lyons will start in goal.

At first glance, it may look like an ordinary calculator, but the Casio solar CM-100 is anything but. It's an extraordinary software tool that's as useful in programming an ApplerM as it is a mainframe IBM:M 
The key to the CM-100's incredible flexibility is Casio's adjustable bit-size selector which can be set to suit any size com­puter up to 32 bits. And its block display which can, by scrolling blocks of 8 digits at a time, display up to a 32 bit word. 
But there's much more to this pocket -size powerhouse. It can do base conversions from binary/ octal/decimal/hexadecimal modes and can store in its memory numbers in any base. It also has Shift, Rotate, Arithmetic Shift and Boolean functions that include AND, OR, XOR and NOT. 
Perhaps what is most extraor­dinary about the CM-100 though, is not how much it can do, but how little it costs to do it. The CM-100 is the only calculator that'll let you do all your software figuring for less than you'd figure to pay for an average ($25.00) textbook. 
The more you work with com­puters-whatever their size-the more you need a CM-100. Whether you're a student or professional, it's the one piece of hardware that will make designing your software easier.

NFL Draft back on 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-The NFL's con­
troversial supplemental draft 
of Cris Carter and Charles 
Gladman, postponed for a week 
to give the athletes a chance to 
regain their college eligibility, 
is on again for Friday. 
No appeal was made in either 
case. 

The draft, which college offi­
cials complained would en­
courage athletes to break the 
rules in order to turn pro, had 
been acceded to "reluctantly" 
by the league under threat of a 
lawsuit. 

Carter, an All-American 
wide receiver from Ohio State, 
has admitted taking $5,000 in 
loans and another $1,800 later 
from agents Nor by Walters and 
Lloyd Bloom. Gladman, a Pitt 
running back, was declared in­
eligible for refusing to 
cooperate with an inquiry into 
the agents.

ND soccer faces Drake at Krause Stadium 


Irish meet Dogs under the lights 
By PETE GEGEN Assistant Sports Editor 

Drake will be the opponent as the 1-0 Irish soccer squad opens its home schedule at Krause Stadium tonight. 
This match will also be the season­opener for Drake, which is beginning only its second year of soccer. Last year the Bulldogs posted a 5-10 record. 
The Bulldogs return nine of 11 starters from last season's squad. The twothatgraduated,however,happened to be the leading scorers on the team. Sophomore Geoff Elfstrum, a for-· 
wardmidfielder, is the top returning scorer with three goals and three as­sists. Sophomore wingback Peter Platt leads the returning starters with four goals last season. In goal for Drake will be sophomore Mike Jensen, who al­lowed an average of 1.7 goals a game last year. 
The odds would appear to be against a young, inexperienced squad opening its second season ever, away from home at the opposing team's first night game at a new stadium. But given Notre Dame's lackluster performance against Loyola Tuesday, the team isn't about to take anything for granted. 
"Loyola did to us what we usually do to other people -put pressure on us and caused turnovers," said Irish head coach Dennis Grace. "We've got to play

Irish offensive line digs deep 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
With four fifth-year seniors returning this fall, the offen­sive line would not appear to be much of a concern for Notre Dame. 
But while the line is long on experience, it is short on depth, making offensive line coach Tony Yelovich thankful he still has a week to prepare for the season opener at Michigan. 
"We're on schedule to a cer­tain degree, but we're not where we want to be," said Yelovich. "We still have a lot of work to do in the fundamen­tals." 
A glance at the first-team players certainly does not make the line look like a weak-

Volleyball team sets weekend sights on Hoosier Classic 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
With first-game jitters hope­fully out of its season, the Notre Dame volleyball team heads south to Bloomington this weekend for the annual Hoosier Classic. The four-team tourna­ment will feature the Irish, In­diana, Purdue and Ball State. 
In last year's tournament, which was played here at Notre Dame, the Irish defeated In­diana in the first round before losing to eventual tournament champion Purdue. Returning ten players from last year's 33­7 team, the Irish swept three games from Southern Illinois in their opener last weekend and should challenge to win this weekend's clash. 
Notre Dame will open the tournament tonight with a 7:30 
p.m. match against Indiana in the Intercollegiate Athletics Gym. 
"Indiana is a vastly im­proved team from last year," said Head Coach Art Lambert. "They had some good talent there and are starting to put it together well this fall." 
If the Irish win that contest, they will face the winner of the Ball State-Purdue matchup at 7:30p.m. on Saturday evening. A loss would match Notre Dame up with that game's

loser at 5 p.m. on Saturday. 
The Irish have never defeated Big Ten power Purdue in regular season play, but did defeat the Boiler­makers in a match during the off-season last spring. That vic­tory should give Notre Dame some confidence should they reach the finals with Purdue. 
"That win should give us more confidence," said Lam­bert. "We still need to rid our­selves of mental errors and work on sustaining concentra­tion. That's what we have been working on this week in prac­tice. Volleyball is a quick game and it's important to stay on top of what is going on." 
Rapid growth spurs move 
By PETE GEGEN Assistant Sports Editor 
On the far eastern border of the Notre Dame campus next to that land known as "Off-Campus" lies Alumni Field, the home of the Irish soccer team over the years. 
Though a far walk from any point on campus, students have made the trek to catch Notre Dame soccer stars such as Kevin Lovejoy, Rich Herdegen and Sami Kahale play against national powers and local weaklings. 
But this large soccer field, which hosted Notre Dame's historic 4-3 upset win over nationally-ranked St. Louis in 1981 and a 1-1 tie with second-ranked Akron but a year ago, will no longer host collegiate soccer matches. The Notre Dame soccer program has been growing ever since Dennis Grace be­came the head coach three-and-a-half years ago, and it has outgrown its home. 
The team has relocated to the newly­constructed 5,000-seat Krause Stadium. With lighting for night matches and stands on both sides of the field, the Irish soccer program is now ready for the big time. 
"It's a beautiful facility," says 
Grace. "We are very fortunate." Grace and his squad will open the 
home season in this stadium tonight 
see KRAUSE, page 11 


in trenches 
"They've shown tremendous leadership, and they've set good work habits on the field," said Yelovich. "They have tre­mendous goals both academi­cally and athletically. And they both have GPA's well over 3.0." 
At the other line position, right guard, sophomores Jeff Pearson and Dean Brown are competing to take the starting slot vacated by Shawn Hef­fern's graduation. Pearson is currently working with the starters, but either one could end up on the first team. 
Behind the first string, however, the Irish have en­countered some problems. Right tackle Pete Rokich, who missed the entire 1986 season with back troubles, has been bothered with a sprained ankle. 
At center, sophomore Steve Huffman quit the team, and sophomore Jim Dadiotis, still awaiting word on his academic eligibility, has not practiced with the team during the fall. 
"We're just too thin in that respect," said Yelovich. "We've made a lot of strides, and we have a lot to improve. We're not where we expect to be." 
Junior Marty Lippincott, who saw action on both the offensive line and defensive line last year, will probably back up Rehder at left tackle. Sop­homores Tim Grunhard ana Ted Healy could back up Freeman at left guard. Grun­hard, a snapper on special

ness for the Irish. Left tackle Tom Rehder, left guard Tom Freeman, center Chuck Lanza and right tackle Byron Spruell all are back for a fifth year at Notre Dame. The four seniors all started together on the line last year. 
"We know each other's moves, strengths and weaknes­ses, and the fact that we played together last year will definitely help us out a lot," said Spruell. 
The respect shown for the senior starters was made evi­dent in the selection of Lanza and Spruell as the Irish co­captains for the 1987 season. 
"Coach Holtz likes the offen­sive linemen to be leaders," said Lanza. "It's kind of ironic that we were selected captains because it fits right into his scheme." 

According to Yelovich, Lanza and Spruell have ad-

justed to their roles as linemen and captains with ease.
