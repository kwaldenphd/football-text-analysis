Investor Buffet to speak at Joyce Center today 
ByJASON McFARLEY 
News Writer 
Organizers expect a talk today at Notre Dame by world­famous businessman Warren Buffett to attract several thou­sand people. 
The talk, 
A Conversation with Warren Buffet." is free and open only to Notre Dame students. faculty and staff. It is at 11 a.m. in the Joyce Center arena. 
At Buffett's request. the event also will be closed to all news media. except The Observer, and no one may record his comments. Anyone attending the speech must show a Notre Dame identification card at the door. 
"[The restrictions are] for the benefit of the academic atmos­phere of the event," said Mary Hamann. manager of adminis­tration and operations in the Mendoza College of Business, the sponsor of the event. "Mr. Buffett wants to be able to speak freely and at times off the cuff and not worry about his words immediately going on the news." 

Buffett, often called "The Oracle of Omaha," is well­known as the world's most suc­cessful stock market investor. He is chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., an Omaha, Neb.-based firm with holdings in excess of $2 billion. 
Buffett's 90-minute appear­ance will include a brief open­ing statement from the 70­year-old entrepreneur followed by a Q-and-A session with the audience. 
Officials expect between 1,500 and 2,000 people to attend the event, according to Hamann. Organizers originally considered holding the event in the 325-seat Jordan Auditorium but eventually set­tled on the Joyce Center arena, which holds more than 11,000 people. 
"We believe there is a lot of interest in Mr. Buffet and want to make sure that everyone who wants to attend can attend," Hamann said.

Sisters of the Holy Cross, administrators, students and faculty were gathered for the discussion bringing a sense of community to the discussion. Steadman involved the audi­ence by allowing everyone to reflect on their own definitions of violence and non-violence and then sharing their defini-

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 



Group holds final meeting of the year 
By SARAH NESTOR 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's Board of Governance held its last meet­ing of the year today as many students came to request funds for conferences and projects. 
Megan Gamble requested $300 for her senior theatre comprehensive "The Most Massive Women Wins" because she is expected to cover the cost of the production. The Board decided to allot her $100. 
Alison Ashley and Kristen Carrigen, Justice Education Club officers. also requested funds for two students, Laura Porto and Elizabeth Dezenzo, to be participants in the "Catholic Social Teaching Internship" this summer. They asked for $1,500 as a group but since it is only for two students the Board decided to grant 
them $600, the maximum 
amount any individual student 
can request.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Eulogy for a fallen comrade 
Although l only got to know you in one night, in that time period, we shared each others deepest secrets and hidden aspira­tions. Both of us grew in the wisdom we had 
to offer each other and I  
knew we would be  Justin Krivickas  
friends for life. But that  
was not meant to be. Like a baby taken away from its mother's bosom, I  News Copy Editor  
admit I wailed when I  

couldn't be near you anymore. 
Your only flaw was that you happened to be a bar. Yes, a bar, not the building I am too young to enjoy but the tangible counter and all its glory. 
You came to me while I was volunteering for Christmas in April, and I will be damned if I ever forget the day. You were being dis­carded like a soiled overcoat, but I spotted you like a diamond in a rough while you sat in a backyard patio praying to the sun God and hoping for a savior. I do not claim to be the one who became that liberator and saved you from the clutches of a garbage truck, but once your life was placed in our hands and into the back of a Dodge Caravan, you whis­pered to me and I became entranced on your black coating. 
Once bathed and given new finery, you stood in our room perched like a gargoyle surveying a new den, watching over and pro­tecting the revelers within. We treated you like a God although it was us who should have been your God, and we danced around your enclave like a tribe performing a cere­monial rite to appease your holiness. 
A gift that kept on giving. you bequeathed to us a nylon kite and a dated letter from 1978 which we planned to laminate and give immortality to by pasting on the surface of your sleek finish. 
Until the hour of five, we basked in your glory and showered you with praise and spent time planning out your college career for the next three years. Through housing textbooks by day and necessities by night, you were going to be the haven for every lewd joke imaginable and becoming a sanc­tuary for all mankind to congregate. Yet, it was not meant to be. 
When I awoke at the hour of two, your fate was already sealed and a sentence handed out. Please do not be angry with us. We worked hard to obtain a stay of execution, but all efforts were thwarted. Deportation precedings were underway, and there was nothing we could do. I ate one last meal on your counter top, hands extended on your padded armrest and feet firmly implanted against your footrest and wept. 
Although you had only been with us for 14 priceless hours. what you gave me will never be forgotten, I will carry my head high knowing that you are still out there somewhere waiting for our reunion. Perhaps someday we will meet again. All I know is that you have gone to a better place: Turtle Creek. 
God bless you and all your future patrons, and may you spread the love that we shared together to others forever and ever. You will be missed by all of us you helped to enlighten.

BROWN UNIVERSITY 
Students join protest in Washington 
PROVIDENCE, R.l. 

A contingent of about 60 Brown University students joined the thousands of protestors who convened Saturday in Washington, D.C.. to oppose globalization, the Israeli invasion of Palestine and U.S. military involvement in wars abroad. Members of a variety of campus groups rode a bus and cars to the capital to par­ticipate in the protests, participating students said. The protest attracted an estimated 75,000 people, according to Washington, D.C., police estimates. The protestors said they were objecting to an array of actions, includ­ing Israel's occupation of Palestine and the policies of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The students said the rally was very peaceful, especially in comparison to the violence that has marred other anti­globalization protests since Seattle in 1999. An informal student group called A20 Mobilization organized the transportation from campus to Washington, D.C.

Feingold demands global AIDS fund 
MADISON, Wis. 
Members of the Student Global AIDS Campaign met at the University of Wisconsin-Madison this weekend for the 2002 North Central Conference, highlights of which included speakers Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and Olympian Isaac Menyoli. The SGAC, part of a nonprofit organization called Global Justice, seeks to end global AIDS through wide-spread education about the disease and persuasion of the U.S. government to take an active interest in the subject. Feingold said he was "astonished" by the activism of the student generation. According to Feingold, who spoke to a crowd of about 100 Saturday afternoon, attitudes in Congress are changing in regards to the AIDS epidemic as a result of "dedicated grassroots efforts." The conference was partly to familiarize stu­dents with the organization and its cause. In addition to speakers, the conference included workshops on improv­ing media relations and lobbying congressional offices.

Associated Press 
PARIS 
With words of shock and shame over Jean-Marie Le Pen's stunning showing, French political leaders of all stripes tucked away their differences Monday and threw support behind President Jacques Chirac in an attempt to thwart the extreme right's bid for power. 
"It is the honor of our country that is at stake," said Dominique Strauss­Kahn, former finance min­ister and spokesman for defeated Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, explaining why he would 
support the conservative 
Chirac. 
He was joined by a host 
of other defeated presiden­
tial hopefuls and their 
allies, all still not quite 
able to believe that Le Pen, 
a man who once called 
Nazi gas chambers a 
"detail of history," had 
outpolled all but Chirac in 
Sunday's first round to 
advance to the presidential 
runoff. 
At a news conference 
Monday, Le Pen declared 
himself "the candidate of 
the French people against 
the candidate of the sys­
tem." . "The French by their 
sovereign power decided to shake up our current system," he said. 
Le Pen's second-place finish was a crushing blow to the political left and to Jospin, prime minister for the last five years, who declared the results a "thunderbolt"and announced his resignation from politics. Jospin had been universally expected to advance to the May 5 runoff against Chirac. 
The results brought thousands of anti-Le Pen demonstrators into the streets of France's major cities Sunday night, with police in Paris using tear gas to disperse marchers heading for Chirac's Elysee Palace. 
Spontaneous demonstra­tions continued Monday, especially among the young, in Marseille, Strasbourg, Paris, Toulouse and other cities. "F like fascist, N like Nazi," some cried in Lyon, playing on the initials of Le Pen's National Front party. 
PoHs predict Chirac will crush Le Pen in the runoff. Still, that wasn't enough to blunt the shock waves reverberating through France. 
"NO,"cried the leftist daily Liberation on its front page. "The shock" was the headline of Le Parisien.

The Justice Department has charged Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th hijacker, in federal court with six counts of conspiracy to commit mur­der and other crimes. Allegedly, he took flying lessons to participate in the Sept. 11 attacks. On that day, he was in jail for visa viola­tions. Attorney General John Ashcroft is seeking the death penalty. 
The government has constitutional authority to pros­ecute Moussaoui in a military tri­bunal for violation of the laws of war. In trying Moussaoui instead in federal court for violations of ordi­nary criminal law, the government is bound by the procedural limits on such prosecutions. It is not certain that Moussaoui will be convicted and it is less likely that the government will obtain the death penalty where the charge is conspiracy rather than actual commission of the murders. 
Does the restrictive teaching of Pope John Paul II on the death penalty apply to this case? The Catechism puts that teaching in the context of "pre­venting crime." If the government had prosecuted Moussaoui in a military tri­bunal, it might be argued that the papal teaching does not apply in such a tribunal which applies the "laws of war" outside the usual criminal process. In a just war, the state has authority to kill intentionally, subject to the restrictions of proportionality and non-combatant immunity. Since the government, however, has prose­cuted Moussaoui in the ordinary crim­inal process, John Paul's teaching applies. 

John Paul II reaffirmed the tradi­
tional teaching that the state has 
authority to impose the death penalty. 
He has given us a new development of 
the teaching as to the use of that 
authority. 
"Evangelium Vitae" (EV) and the Catechism affirm that retribution, the restoration of the balance ofjustice, is the primary purpose of punishment in general. But, because of the impor­tance of the conversion of the sinner, neither retribution, deterrence of oth­ers nor any other reason can any longer justify, by itself, the use of the state's power to execute unless that execution is "the only possible way of ... defending ... lives against the unjust aggressor," that is, against this crimi­nal. 
Whether execution is such an "absolute necessity" depends on the ability of the prison system to confine this prisoner securely. That involves a prudential judgment. But the new teaching as to the use of the death penalty is universal and not a pruden­tial teaching. It applies everywhere and to all states. Nor can it be dis­missed as merely the Pope's personal opinion -he put it in the Catechism. 
Even under John Paul's teaching one could still argue for the death penalty in some cases: for example, if a life inmate, already in maximum security, murders another inmate, or where the state is unable to confine inmates securely. In a military tribunal case that teaching might not apply. Or it might be argued that even John Paul's criteria could justify execution of a terrorist leader if his continued exis­tence in prison would ·incite further terrorist attacks. 
On the other hand, the martyrization by execution of such a leader might have the same inciting effect. Or, could a clandestine terrorist be regarded as a spy and rightly executed pursuant to the laws of war? 
Whatever the answer to such hypo­
theticals, John Paul's teaching fully 
applies to all prosecutions under ordi­
nary criminal law, including that of 
Moussaoui. 
When Paul VI, in "Humanae Vitae," affirmed the immorality of contracep­tion, many liberal Catholics took a walk or began a sit-in schism. John Paul's teaching on the death penalty may become the "Humanae Vitae" of some politically conservative, orthodox Catholics, including Justice Antonin Scalia and Patrick J. Buchanan. Scalia argues that because EV "does not rep­resent 'ex cathedra' teaching ... it need not be accepted by practicing Catholics." Canon Law and the Catechism, however, agree with Vatican II that "loyal submission of will and intellect must be given, in a special way, to the authentic teaching authority of the Roman Pontiff, even when he does not speak 'ex cathe­dra."' 
John Paul insists that the power of the state is subject to the law of the Lord of life. He seeks the protection of society and of innocent life, not through homicidal acts of the state, but through a "cultural transforma­tion" building a "new culture of life," recognizing "the incomparable and inviolable worth of every human life" (EV, no. 95). I agree enthusiastically with his position. But even if a Catholic does not agree with it, he must support it because John Paul is the Vicar of Christ and not some Polish guest-worker in Rome. Under that teaching, Moussaoui should not be executed.

Sense of family provides stabilit)' abroad 
I just got back from my first vacation since l have been in Mauritania. I knew it was going to be great the minute I walked onto the Air France flight. It looked so clean and organized. The seats felt like 
absolute luxury, Maite Uranga
the food was great and there was actually the con­cept of customer !,ife in Africa service in action. The vacation por­tion of it involved mountains, trees, waterfalls, islands and ice cream. AH of-these Mauritania has little to none of -which made it won­derful. 
The flight back was one of those high­tech planes with individual television screens and choice of movie options of video games. As my plane left green and water, I played Tetris and suddenly 1 realized the enormity of what lays ahead of me. I tend to take mv life here week by week and sometimes· even day by day. For some reason, instead of next week or tomorrow ahead of me, I saw 17 months. 
Sev1;;nteen months is a long time when you are in your mid-twenties, especially here. Using averages and some guess­work, that involves 673 more trips to the faucet with my bucket, 342 more hours squashed in a bush taxi. 185 more days of waking up already sweat­ing, 1.5 more mysterious illnesses, 1,203 government forms and at least 22 lost letters. 
This seems like an enormous amount of stress and in many ways unnecessary. I could be working in a cubicle, sitting in a comfortable chair with the Internet, phones and printers at my fingertips. Food would be within walking distance and possibly even in the same air condi­tioned building. People would speak my language. My hours would be fairly cer­tain and my job defined. It is a hard choice some days between the chaos of Africa and the order of America. 
On top of this I have been in country for almost a year. In this time I have seen a lot of Mauritania, learned French and Pulaar to an extent, read 39 books. made some friends, provided a lot of cross cultural exchange and completed some small work projects. As I played Tetris in the luxury of economy cl~ss I concluded that leaving around my one 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Don't let objectivity overshadow sympathy 
I might ask why Todd Mobley felt the need to submit his April 19 letter ("View rape discussion fairly") consid­ering his point was already adequately stated by Memo Tijerna: that people should be "innocent until prov·en guilty." A valid point, although some­what obvious. Yes, there is a presump­tion of innocence in this country. However, it is unfortunate that it did not occur to either writer that Erin Kennedy's April 16 letter was a letter of sympathy and support and not neces­sarily an objective argument. 
Suppose you have a child who may have an incurable disease, and you have to wait 3 weeks for the test results to prove whether or not your child has it. Is that the time for a friend to say, "Well. I have to reserve judgment on your kid's future until after the test results?" Or is that when the friend should say, "Don't worry, I believe everything will be OK, your kid is going to be fine?" Even if the chances of the child being fine are 30 percent, that is not what the parent needs to hear from a friend, no matter how logical such a statement may be (though they may need to hear it from a doctor). There is a time for support, and there is a time for debate. I took Erin Kennedy's letter to be one of public support, not a call to remove the presumption of innocence. 
The presumption of innocence is important in our legal system, but it has limited applications in everyday exis­tence. Suppose your roommate comes back from Heartland one night and says that he was mugged, and as a result he is really shaken up. Do you tell him that since you don't know the facts you can't really say anything supportive? Do you instead say that because of the pre­sumption of innocence you have to assume that he made up the whole story? (But, of course, as soon as you get the facts then you'll make your con­clusion and tell him how sorry you are that he was mugged.) 
An abstract legal standard shouldn't prevent people from showing each other compassion or trust, neither of which need to be or should be defended logically. Doesn't saying that you trust someone necessarily mean that you support them in the absence of full knowledge of a situation? 
There is a time and a place for every­thing. In a court of law or hearing it is a time for standards of law and debate, in everyday life it is a time for compassion and support. Saying that you believe someone and trust them when they are going through a difficult time is invalu­able. Even if this were all an incredible fabrication, it would still be heartless to say that the alleged victim doesn't deserve any public compassion. In the latter instance she would still be going through a difficult time period, as would the accused. 
Finally, I might address Todd Mobley's assertion that if any student "quickly draws a conclusion" in this case, then that would be "nearly as damaging as the supposed incident itself." Thus, according to Mobley, if I were to draw a quick conclusion in this case, then the damage I cause would be comparable to the damage someone experiences when they are gang raped. 
It is most unfortunate that Mobley so casually trivializes the long-lasting emotional, psychological and physical trauma of rape, let alone an alleged gang rape. I will assume that in his exu­berance to write a letter to the editor he wasn't thinking properly when he proposed that an intellectual "conclu­sion" someone may make is "nearly as damaging" as a brutal physical viola­tion. Otherwise, I would have to say that his statement skirts the border somewhere between asinine and gut­less.

year anniversary did not seem like a bad option. 
The plane landed and the flight atten­dant made me get off the plane. Over the next few days I slowly readjusted myself to Mauritania. Instead of focus­ing on 17 months I readjusted to think­ing about it in a day to day mentality and also on the 11 months I have been here. The day before I planned to leave the capital for my site I stopped by my host family's house in Nouakchott. There were the usual smiles and level of excitement as I entered the house. They asked about my vacation, my family at home and other Peace Corps volunteers here. 
Then they told me my host gran.d­mother was there in the back room. Mauritanians never really come out with a direct reason for a situation or a spe­cific answer to a question. All they told me was that she was visiting. I immedi­ately knew something was wrong because she never even goes into the regional capital which is half an hour away. She would never make the six hour trip to Nouakchott just for a visit. 
I walked into the room and saw her lying on a mat surrounded by four of her daughters who live in various places in Mauritania and Senegal. She saw me walk in and smiled. We did the standard five minute greeting as if nothing hap­pened. One of her daughters told me she had been asking where I was for about a week and kept talking about me and trying to figure out when I would be back. 
My French is OK, but communicating medical terms and situations is not something I can do. All they kept saying to me in Pulaar was, "Our mother is tired." Without even thinking they included me in the "our." 
Suddenly the next 17 months did not seem as overwhelming as I realjzed I had a family. Seventeen months did not seem as dire as I held my grandmoth· er's hand and told her my parents in America said hello.

Sigh. Graduate students have been defamed again. Our characters have been maligned, our capacities questioned, our motivations doubted. 
But it was not Katie Hughes's clever April 17 Inside column that proffered these slanders most effectively; it was the lifeless responses elicited from the 1graduate student body itself. 
Katie's excessively witty column about TA culture demanded a sly, irony­saturated response. Apparently wishing to demonstrate a pervasive lack of wit, T As responded with straightforward indignation, straightforward refuta­tion and straightforward insult. It was as ifwe collectively wished to verify Katie's sentiment by example, showing how technically accurate yet dull we can be. 
For example, Katie referred to us as "bitter low grade giving pretentious TA," going two for three on the truth (we inflate our grades as much as pro­fessors). One TA responded with "bitter, sarcastic, low grade-receiving Katie Hughes." Now, copying your opponent's phrase and changing one word is not very clever. This would have been a good opportunity to invent a new, witty phrase, perhaps retaining the meter, something such as "grade-grubbing, pre-yuppie, anti-intellectual undergrad." 
Or, one might have graded the column, complimenting the wickedly ren­dered sarcasm but noting the grammatical mistakes: "theorum" (misspelled), "Nietche" (misspelled), "bitter low grade giving pretentious TA" (need com­mas and hyphens). 
In the summary comments, one could have proposed avenues for improve­ment, perhaps suggesting that Katie put down her skim-milk-frappa-whatev­er, remove the sideways or backward baseball cap from her boyfriend's head, and realize that the world is bigger than her conservative, Catholic, obscenely pampered, (almost certainly) homogeneously white, pre-med/business/law, alcohol-obsessed life. 
But, now, this is impossible. If I were to grade Katie's column, I would have to also grade the responses to it, and Katie would win the highest mark. Instead of refuting her, we simply proved her most incisive point: Notre Dame graduate students are just no fun.

CONCERT REVIEW 
Paul McCartney still has what it takes 
After 40 years in the musical spotlight, the former Beatie is still rockin' 
By JULIE BENDER 
Scene Musk Critic 
April 10 was the 32nd anniversary of the Beatles breakup. And not since then has a band sounded so good. On his Midwestern stop on his "Driving Rain" tour, Paul McCartney brought his British pandemonium to Chicago's United Center last Wednesday night. Playing a set list of over 50 percent Beatles songs, McCartney showed an enthused audience that despite his nearly 60 years, he can still twist and shout. 
Dressed casually in a red t-shirt and blue jeans, McCartney walked onto the stage and emblem of modesty and humility, despite the carnivorous roar of the fans. Pulling out his signature Hofner violin bass, McCartney started in a on a set of songs encompassing five decades of musical genius. From the early Beatles shakes and shim­mies, to psychedelic era anthems, to Wings rock, to modern day melodies, McCartney gave a taste of everything. 
For the opener, he broke into the often over-looked Beatles' classic "Hello, Goodbye." Singing it crystal clear. it was as though it was 1967 all over again. McCartney's voice has withstood the decades, and impres­sively he can still reach all the high notes in the harmonies he was once so well noted for. Next, ripping into the Wings song "Jet," McCartney had the audience up and dancing in no time. The performance only kept "Getting Better" as McCartney tooted through the eras with songs from both his early and later albums. 
Backed by a highly skilled band of mostly unknown musicians, the music was tight and stayed faithful to the original recordings. With excellent fills on "Maybe I'm Amazed" and "Sgt. Pepper's Reprise," Lhe drummer Abe Laboriel Jr. at times resembled Ringo with his head-bopping style. The guitarists Rusty Anderson and Brian Ray also showed immense skill in their youth. Anderson particularly displ~yed talent on the audience thriller, "Back in the U.S.S.R." and on the final number "The End." Paul "Wix" Wickens was tho man on key­boards. but also did an interesting stint with the accordion, dueting with Paul's guitar on the sweet "Mother Nature's Son." The backing band, with its members each showing talent and musicianship in their own right, also had a stage-chemistry and youthful vitality that made McCartney sing and play as though he were in his 20s again. At times, with black and white camera's fixed on McCartney, the audience felt as though they were in a time warp. The cheerful head bobs, the slightly moppy hair and that charming wink and smile can still make any woman in the crowd's heart flutter for McCartney, the "cute" Beatie. 
Perhaps the most exquisite part of the evening was when McCartney had the band leave while he played a solo set with just an acoustic guitar. Falling into an anecdote about how "In England we call girls birds" and connecting that to the race issued in Alabama in the '60s, McCartney told 
the story of the creation of the 

In memory of Sept. 11, McCartney also played "Freedom," which he per­formed live at the Super Bowl earlier this year. A large yellow banner unfolded behind him depicting the Statue of Liberty signed and doodled upon. The audience showed passion, waving flags and singing along with the chorus, as McCartney held up his guitar in a symbolic gesture of unscathed power and pride. 
The final song of the night was the much-anticipated "Hey Jude." The multi-colored "box" returned, and McCartney immediately launched into the powerful piano classic. The famous "Na Na Na Na" chorus at the end had the audience up out of their seats swaying with beer mugs and waving lighters in the air. McCartney stood up and conducted the audience first having only the men sing. then only the women and, for a powerful finish, everyone together. With a glis­sando, McCartney sat back at his piano and let out a series of screams and wails showing that his voice is still as rock 'n' roll as ever. 
Leaving the stage with a bow, McCartney returned minutes later to subdue an audience pounding for more. First slowing things down with "The Long and Winding Road," McCartney then rocked out with "Lady Madonna" and "I Saw Her Standing There," a song some claim is the best three-minute rock song ever written. For the second encore, McCartney strapped on his classic Gibson Epiphone and serenaded the audience with the beautiful "Yesterday." Next, McCartney traded his acoustic guitar for an electric and launched into a jam with his band on "Sgt. Pepper Reprise" singing, "We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band/ We hope you have enjoyed the show/ Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band/ We're sorry but it's time to go... " The perfect choice for the final song was "The End," which contained smoking guitar solos and a fantastic drum fill. 
McCartney blew a final kiss to the swooning audience and left the stage bowing as humbly as he had first entered. After a three-hour rock fest, McCartney showed that he is as youthful as ever.

beautiful song "Blackbird." The crowd fell silent as McCartney's natural guitar picking mingled with melodious tones of his voice. Fading out of the song with some falsetto. he continued on with a few more numbers like "Every Night" from his McCartney album and the 1965 classic "We Can Work it Out." 
Adding some puzzling humor to the night, mysterious men dressed in costumes such as an 18th-cen­tury wig and another with a Roman toga entered the stage car­rying what turned out to be a bril­liantly painted electric piano, which McCartney called a "box." Settling himself behind the instrument, he noodled around a bit before break­ing into Abbey Road's "You Never Give Me Your Money." As the audi­ence hummed along, McCartney fumbled the words a bit. but con­tinued to sing, ''I've forgotten the words and I won't remember them till the end of the tour!" making his mistake perfectly excusable and almost charming. Contihuing with the piano trend, he also played "Carry That Weight" and "Fool on the Hill," while scenes from the Beatles self-produced movie Magical Mystery Tour played on the screens in the background. 
Although less recognizable. McCartney also played songs like "Lonely Road" and "Loving J:llame" off his· most recent album Driving Rain, for which the tour is named. For other more recent songs McCartney switched lo a Spanish guitar and whistled into the song "Vanilla Sky," the title track he wrote for the Cameron Crowe film.

CONCERT REVIEW 
Pat McGee Band shines with passionate performance 
Byl.AUREN BECK Scene Music Cricic 
Pat McGee Band is well known for its mellow rhythms and lyrical bal­lads, but the band's Friday night performance was anything but sedate. 
The band mesmerized their audi­ence and set the tone for the evening after opening with a spirited, upbeat rendition of their hit "Girl from Athens," off McGee's 1995 debut acoustic album, From the Wood. 
McGee, a Virginia native, formed his sextet in 1996 as a grassroots rock group. The band has since earned a place in the spotlight with their 1997 independent album Revel, General Admission. a live recording released in 1999, and most recently, Shine, their first album produced by piajor label Giant Records, in 2000. 
Pat McGee Band has continued to develop its unique blend of classic· rock. country, pop and blues. and the band certainly showcased that sound on Friday. 

NELLIE WILLIAMS/The Ooserver The Pat McGee Band brought its ener­getic and innovative blend of rock, pop and blues to Stepan Center Friday night. 
From the bluegrass-laden "Can't Misc;; What You Never Had" to the melodic love ballad "Haven't Seen in a While," Pat McGee Band proved itself versatile and innovative. 
McGee looked and played like a born rock star: confident, composed, cool, but not too cocky. 
He was a true crowd pleaser, throwing Oreo cookies to the crowd, offering to stick around after the show for autographs and joking with his audience. "So this is quite a venue you guys have here," McGee face­tiously said of Stepan Center. His crisp. sensual lead vocals and transi­tions from acoustic to electric guitar fused well with John Small's bass and Brian Fechino's electric guitar for a rich sound. 
It was evident the band thoroughly 
enjoyed playing, so it only made 
sense that the captive audience loved 
listening. They begged to hear the 
band's classics but responded with as 
much enthusiasm to their new mater­
ial as well. Neither Pat McGee Band 
nor its fans lost their explosive ener­
gy during new, more intense and edgy songs like "You and I," "Never Around" and "What You're Missing." 
But the crowd went wild during hits like "Runaway." "Lost" and the appro­priately titled "Passion," driven by Chris Williams on drums and Chardy McEwan's amazing percussion. 
Piano virtuoso Jonathan Williams arguably stole the show with his sig­nature solo rendition of Marc Cohn's "Walking in Memphis." 
The exuberant "Rebecca," extended to include fast and furious jams, inspired incredible crowd reaction. Pat McGee Band used "Rebecca" to segue into covers of Bob Marley's "No Woman. No Cry" and John Mellencamp's "Jack and Diane," giv­ing both a more modern rock feel. 
McGee returned to stage solo for an acoustic encore performance of the mellow, passionate title track from the "Shine" album. 
The remainder of the band joined him to end the concert with the pow­erful. climactic "Hero," leaving the crowd energized and fully satisfied and confirming that Pat M_cGee Band has what it takes to make it big.

CONCERT REVIEW 
Yorn brings songs from the heart 
By DAVE FULTON Scene Music Cricic 
Unfortunately, musician is a term that gets thrown around much too loosely these days when radio puts out more cheese than a Wisconsin dairy farm. Being able to dance around on a stage while lip-synching to songs written by someone else falls far short of musicianship. 
However, on Friday night at Heartland. Pete Yorn showed that there are still some deserving of the title musician. His 70-minute ener­getic, intimate and honest set blasted a refreshing musical air over the near-capacity crowd. 
Backed by a four-piece band, the 27-year-old Yorn hit the ground run­ning. opening his set with a blistering version of "Black," tipping his hat to one of his greatest influences, Joy Division. The song was injected with Yorn's adrenaline-laden strumming giving it a faster. frenzied feel. From there, the show gained momentum like a non-stop train pulling out of a station. never slowing down until it reached its final destination. Not an easy task, as much of Yorn 's material consists of slower ballads. Yet, the singer/songwriter succeeded in the task with near perfection. 
His performances of songs from musicforthemorningafter, his debut album, were granted subtle alter­ations, maintaining their solid crafts­manship, while staying fresh at the same time. 
Where an acoustic guitar drives 
across more intimately than their stu­dio counterparts. Much of this was due to the fact that Heartland looks more like the big basement of a well­to-do friend, than a sprawling dance club. The small size of the venue as well as the rawness of the songs and the subtle, warm lighting, gave an almost campfire quali­ty to the bal­lads. 
On the other hand, "For Nancy," and "Life on a Chain" took on an added intensity that breathed new life into the songs. Yorn's confidence and experience showed through in the songs. After touring almost non-stop for the past year 
and a half 
since the album's release, Yorn has his live performance down pat. There was no flashiness, no 

"For Nancy." The song worked well as 
it slowly built up from Yorn strum­
ming and singing alone, into an 
exploding chorus of drums, bass and 
distorted guitar. The added synth 
never really fit into the song's sound­scape, yet at the same time, Yorn had enough sense to use it sub­tly. Th us even in bad judg­ment. Yorn made sure the song's overall quality would not be dam­aged. Much of the music's excel­lence comes through in the lyrics. Fortunately, the sound quality of the vocals matched that excellence. Despite the heavy, three­guitar ambush, Yorn 's voice always came through clear­ly over the instruments. All of his songs have a strong poetic quality 
sound cliche. 
With only one album of original material to play from, Yorn pulled out some covers and a B-side to not only fiH time, but also pay his dues. David Bowie's "China Girl" and The Smith's "Panic" fit perfectly with Yorn's own songs, as much of Yorn's own materi­al is strongly influenced by the British rock sound. The songs had an edgy aggressiveness that could have blown the roof off of the venue. Guitarist/keyboardist Joe Kennedy added melodic strums while lead gui­tarist Jason Johnson ripped at his gui­tar strings like a tiger attacking its prey. All of this was glued together by Terry Borden's nimble bass lines and Luke Adam's thunderous drum blasts. 
However, it was the softer moments of the show that were most effective. Yorn's solo performance of Bruce Springsteen's "Dancing in the Dark," followed by a delicate "Simonize" found Yorn at his best. Standing in total shadow at the microphone look­ing like a modern-day Jim Morrison with a guitar, he crooned the ballad with a raw, almost Dylanesque voice. Without the polish had by multiple studio takes. Yorn's vocals on "Simonize" and the beautiful "Lose You" turn into pleas, charging the songs with gentle emotion. 
A solo, acoustic performance of "EZ" had the capability of being the highlight of the night, but fell short due to no fault of Yorn. Instead the incessant chatter of audience mem­bers plagued Yorn's delicate picking and peaceful crooning. Yet. for those actually listening, the stripped down, 

most of the songs on the album, Yorn only donned the instrument once dur­ing the show. The omission of that element in the set gave the songs a more aggressive feel, yet failed to take away from their intimate value. 
Songs like "Simonize," "Lose You" and "On Your Side" actually came arrogant, rock star posing, instead there was a sense of personal enjoyment. Yorn clearly enjoys playing his songs to an audi­ence, slipping sly grins across his lips while violently strumming his guitar. 
Overconfidence might have been behind the added synthesizer line in 
to them in the same fashion as other singer/song­writers like Elliott Smith and Jeff Buckley. Despite the content of the songs often dwelling on loss, there is a beauty in the choice of words and expressions that give them an honesty and tenderness without making them 
solo performance proved a real treat.

BOOKSTORE BASKETBALL XXXI 
Bacchus loses after Graves goes down 
By TIM McKENZIE 
Sports Writer 
With only minutes left in the final half of the game, an ankle injury to former varsity basket­ball player David Graves caused 19th-ranked Bacchus to stop worrying about Bookstore Basketball and think about their teammate and friend. 
Bacchus went on to lose the game 21-16 to unranked oppo­nent What The Hell Arc Robster Craws?. 
"As soon as [Graves] was injured, we stopped caring about whether we won or lost -his health was more impor­tant to us than the game was and losing him really knocked the wind out of our sails," said Bacchus captain Nick Lambrecht. 
Bacchus could not have lost Graves at a more pivotal point, as they trailed 18-15. Though Lambrecht cited the Robser Craws' sportsmanship as they played the game 4-on-4, he also commented that his team cared more about Graves' health and no longer about the outcome. 
Five Notre Dame employees proved that they still what it takes to compete by winning a close game through determina­tion and team effort.

The public also expects Notre Dame to not only com­pete, but win against teams such as Florida State and Nebraska. despite the Irish not being able to recruit some of the country's top players because of their aca­demic standards. Notre Dame has turned away numerous outstanding foot­ball players because of poor Ed Smith, Pat McAllister, Ron Sulewski, Ryan O'Malley and Mark Yost. 
"As employees, we just want­ed to let everyone know that we're a part of Notre Dame," said Jones after the win. "We're here to show the young guys that we've still got it." · 
Houdini's Smith cited a num­ber of missed jumpers as his team's main shortcoming, but has no regrets about the game. 
"It was very physical and we played hard," said Smith. 
Despite a 21-19 loss to Heteroskedasticity. Bly and the Family Stone isn't focused on their loss and is already looking forward to next year's tourney to make another appearance. 
"We played well tonight," said Bly member Dave Goett. "Even though we were down Un the first half], we made two big comebacks." 
With a smaller and quicker roster, Team Bly and the Family Stone, made up of Alumni Hall's Dave Goett, Dave Finocchio, Paul Sifuentes. Ben O'Connor and Marcos Sosa. relied on tight pressure to steal the ball and convert on a num­ber of perimeter shots. 
Unfortunately, this momen­tum wasn't enough to carry Bly, as Heteroskedasticity used their size advantage to wear down Bly's defense. 
"We're all taller guys, so our game plan was just to pound it inside," said Skedastic player Ed Wasilewski. 
This strategy worked well towards the end, as Bly and the

Irish sweep Pirates, grab first place tie 
By CHRIS FEDERICO Sports Editor 
The Irish baseball team enjoyed quite possibly its best performance of the season this weekend as it claimed a three­game sweep of conference rival Seton Hall. The two teams entered the critical series tied for second place in the league. 
With the three wins, the Irish improved to 27-12 and 11-6 in the Big East while moving into a three-way tie for the conference lead with Virginia Tech and Boston College. 
"This was the best weekend we've had so far," center fielder Steve Stanley said. "We played as a team. The pitching contin­ued to be great, and our hitting was really coming along." 
The games were reminiscent of the Irish style of play lq5t sea­son, when Notre Dame would regularly get dominating pitch­ing performances from graduat­ed starting· pitchers Aaron Heilman and Danny Tamayo and the offense would provide enough support for the victory. 
"We don't have, right now, as dominant as a pitching staff as we did last year," Stanley said. "We've gone out each inning and have been mentally prepared to score nine or 10 runs if that's what it's going to take. I think our offense has really stepped up, and we've done a better job than we have in the past couple of years." 
In each game, the Irish enjoyed dominating outings from starters John i\xfo rd, Pete Ogilvie and Grant Johnson. Each of the three pitchers earned a win for their work, and none even trailed in a ball game after the second inning. 
In the opener Saturday, rains delayed the start 2 hours and 50 minutes, allowing only one game to be played and pushing the doubleheader to Tuesday. 
After falling behind 1-0, Irish catcher Paul O'Toole blasted a solo home run in the second inning to tie the game. 
Following a leadofT walk from Stanley in the fifth inning, left fielder Brian Stavisky hit an RBI single to put the Irish up 2-1, a lead they would never relin­quish. 
After adding an insurance run in the sixth, Notre Dame scored four more in the seventh on a grand slam from O'Toole. The homer was the second of the day for O'Toole, who had also hit a grand slam in the previous game against Toledo Wednesday. 
Meanwhile, the freshman pitcher Axford had cruised through six more solid innings of work after allowing a run in the first inning. In the eighth, how­ever, the youngster ran into some trouble by allowing a pair of leadoff hits, and then yielding two more walks with two outs. 
Senior J.P. Gagne came in to relieve Axford, and allowed a

Billmaier then squeezed in Sollmann with a bunt, and O'Toole added a single up the middle to score Stavisky for the 4-0 lead. 
The Irish added two more runs with two outs in the ninth on hits again from Stanley. Sollmann and Stavisky. 
The Irish get a break from Big East play this week, but are by no means in any position to relax. The team has a pair of mid-week games against Chicago State and Bowling Green Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. 
Later this weekend, the Irish will play host to Pac-10 power­house Arizona State. The Sun Devils are ranked as high as 14th in the USA Today/ESPN Coaches Poll and are coached by former Irish head coach Pat Murphy. 
"We feel very excited about these games coming up," Stavisky said. "We have a matchup between the previous coach and our current coach, and Arizona State is a national name every year in college base­ball. To get to play them in our park with our fans is going to be very exciting." 
The game today against Chicago State will begin at 6:05 at Frank Eck Stadium.

Notre Dame ended an insur­ance run in the sixth when Sollmann singled and then stole second. Right fielder Kris Billmaier then singled in Sollmann for the 4-2 victory. 
In the final game of the series Sunday, the junior right-hander Ogilvie pitched a gem of a ball­game, holding Seton Hall score­less for seven innings before yielding an unearned run in the eighth.

Relay competes with U.S. Olympic squad 
By DAVE COOK 
Sports Writer 
This weekend at the Mt. SAC Relays in Walnut, Calif., lack of preparation and a last minute line-up change proved to be a good thing for the Notre Dame women's 4x100 relay team. 
The distractions kept Tarneisha King, Liz Grow, Kymia Love and Ayesha Boyd from thinking about the team who was racing right next to them ­the United States Olympic squad. 
Their lack of nervousness led to a second-place finish of 44.3 seconds in the relay, a new school record. The time also places the Irish in the top 10 among 4x100 relay teams in the nation. 
"It was a nice distraction, because I think if we had thought about who we were run­ning against, Chryste Gaines, Inger Miller, these amazing Olympians who are practically our role models, I think we would have been really nervous and would not have done as well," said Grow, who runs the second leg of the relay. 
Due to the stringent rules of the meet, the Irish were only able to warm up for 40 minutes prior to the race, when they are used to at least an hour of warming up. 
"I felt before they called us out to the track that I was unpre­pared," Grow said. "I hadn't done as many strides as I usually do. I didn't feel that I was ready to go. So I wasn't even nervous to run against Team USA." 
A last-minute change was also made in the lineup. Kristen Dodd was replaced with Kymia Love after sprinting coach John Millar decided that Dodd was not well enough to run in the relay. 
Although the Irish came in sec­ond to the Team USA "A" squad, they were able to edge out the "B" squad by .03 seconds. 
Victories for the Irish at the Mt. SAC Relays came from Boyd in the 100-meter dash, with a season best time of 11.69 sec­onds, and Megan Johnson in the 1,500-meter run with a time of 4 minutes, 27.21 seconds. 
Although Johnson won her heat of the 1,500, women's dis­tance coach Tim Connelly was hoping she had raced in a more competitive field. 
"She wasn't in a heat where there were people at her level," Connelly said. "She led every step of the way, and most of the race she was 10 meters in front of everybody. I tried to get her into a better heat but they [the Mt. SAC officials] wouldn't switch her." 
Jen Handley ended up taking third place in the College 5,000, but Connelly was hoping she would be able to race in the faster Invitational 5,000. 
"She didn't get into the Invitational 5,000, so she ended up in the College 5,000 where she led most of the race," Connelly said. "It was frustrating not to get accomplished what we wanted to get done."

Gumpf to face alma mater 
By AARON RONSHEIM 
Sports Writer 
When the Notre Dame softball team visits Lincoln, Neb., to face the No. 4 Cornhuskers, head coach Deanna Gumpf will be returning to her alma mater. where she was named to the All­Big Eight Conference second team in 1991 and was a confer­ence honorable mention pick in 1989 and 1990. 
"Nebraska is a great place to be and a great place to go and play a game," said Gumpf, who graduated in 1992. "They are No. 4 in the nation right now and that is motivation in and of itself." 
The Irish are ranked No. 1 in the Big East. With their victories over Virginia Tech on Saturday Notre Dame, improved their record to 27-13 and 11-1 in the Big East. 
Gumpf and seniors Jarrah Myers, Jenny Kriech and Kas Hoagt all remember their last face-off against the Cornhuskers. In 1999 the Cornhuskers ended Notre Dame's season with a 4-3 extra-inning victory in the NCAA Region VI tournament final. 
"We lost twice during the sea­s on then again to them in regionals," Gumpf said. "So we have a score to settle." 
"[This] is a huge game," Myers said. "From my freshman year we owe them so bad. It is going to one game." 
Myers, who turned 22-years­old on Monday, celebrated her birthday a little early as she hit three homeruns against the Hokies. With her three home runs Myers passed 2001 gradu­ate Melanie Alkire and became the Irish career home run leader with 32. 
Against Nebraska the Irish will need Myers' offense, but also her defense to shut down the Cornhuskers' running game. The Cornhuskers have stolen 104 bases in only 129 attempts. 
"Nebraska is very aggressive team and if we take that out of their game then they are going to have to make some adjust­ments," Gumpf said. 
Opponents have only swiped Nebraska offense, Steffany 22 bases against the Irish this Stenglein (16-9) and Carrie season. Wisen (11-4) will have to keep

The final Irish runner at the Mt. SAC Relays was Lauren King, who raced in the fastest heat of the 1,500 taking fifth place with a time of 4:23.47. 
The mile relay team for the women was hoping to run an automatic NCAA qualifying time at the Mt. SAC Relays, but a fum­bled baton exchange ruined all hopes of achieving that goal. Despite the fumble, the relay team still finished in third with a time of 3:35.99. 
"We had trouble with the hand-off because we switched the order [of runners]," 
said Grow. "We weren't quite as prepared as we liked to be, but we still ran a pretty decent time." 
With Ayesha Boyd performing particularly strong the last sev­eral weeks, sprinting coach John Millar switched the positions of Floyd and Kymia Love in the mile relay, making Boyd the lead run­ner and Kymia the second run­ner. 
The Irish also competed in two field events at the Relays. Jamie Volkmer took seventh place in the pole vault with a vault of 11 feet, 5.75 inches, and Tameisha King took fourth in the long jump with a jump of 18-11.75. 
While the Irish were on the West Coast, several sprinters raced in the Pomona-Pitzer Invitational in Claremont, Calif. the Friday before the Mt. SAC Relays. 
The most notable of the races was the 400-meter dash, where Liz Grow took first place by beat­ing long-time rival Foye Williams. who races with the club-team Etobkoke Gladstone. Williams beat Grow earlier in the season at the Meyo Invitational, where she edged out Grow by .35 seconds. 
"It felt really good to get a little revenge," Grow said. "I knew if I focused on beating her, I'd run a fast time."

Finally home after an 0-6 trip to Chicago and Minnesota, the Indians improved to 7-0 at Jacobs Field this season and ended their longest losing skid in two years. 
1-<ryman and Branyan each

been moved into the starting 
rotation this season after pitch­
ing in relief a year ago. 
The right-hander, who defected from Cuba and lived in Costa Rica. didn't seem to be bothered by having to pitch in chilly temperatures that dipped into the 30s. He struck out a career-high seven and walked one. 
After giving up two singles in the sixth, Baez was replaced by Ricardo Rincon, who got Ray Durham to swing at his second pitch and bounce into an inning-ending double play. 
Jose Valentin's two-run 
homer in the seventh off David 
Riske got the White Sox within

Bob Wickman pitched the ninth for his sixth save. 
Kenny Lofton, who played nine seasons with the Indians, returned for the first time with the White Sox and went 1-for-3 and was thrown out trying to steal. 
Lofton got a nice ovation as he came to the plate in the first inning, but the warm welcome ended seconds later when Baez's first pitch zipped past his head. 
Fryman came in batting just .203, and grounded to third in his first at-bat before connect­ing for his first homer since opening day in the fourth to make it 2-0. 
Omar Vizquel singled, and one out later, was thrown out at the plate while trying to score on Ellis Burks' double. Shortstop Royce Clayton made a nice throw to catcher Sandy Alomar, who blocked Vizquel from touching the plate. 
With two outs, Fryman was given the green light and drove a 3-0 pitch from Buehrle into the left-field bleachers. 
Branyan, who teases the Indians by hitting long homers and then going into prolonged funks. was in a 5-for-31 slump with 11 strikeouts before he followed a leadoff walk to Milton Bradley in the fifth with his third homer -on an 0-2 pitch.

dropped seven in a row to 
Seattle. 
Jamie Moyer (3-1) coasted to victory behind the run support, retiring the first 10 batters he faced. He pitched seven innings and gave up five runs on seven hits and no walks. 
It was the first time Moyer had allowed more than three runs in a game this season. but he was pleased with the results. 
"I probably could have gone 
longer, but we needed to get 
some guys some work," said 
Moyer. "I think I had pretty 
good command tonight. I felt 
pretty good out there." 
Seattle battered Scott 
Schoeneweis (1-3) from the 
start. With one out, Cirillo 
homered and then Boone hit 
the next pitch for his fourth 
home run. 
"I don't know what it is that 
they're taking or what they are 
doing over there. but I want 
some of it," said Schoeneweis. 
"It was one of those nights." 
Schoeneweis put himself in trouble with one out in Seattle's big six-run third. He threw away Mike Cameron's comebacker for a three-base error and walked Sierra. 
Carlos Guillen hit an RBI dou­
ble and Dan Wilson was inten­
tionally walked to load the 
bases for Mclemore, whose 
slam finished Schoeneweis. 
In his last three sta,ts, Schoeneweis has allowed 24 hits and 19 earned runs over .15 innings. 
Trailing 9-2 in the sixth, the Angels came up with three runs on Troy Glaus' sacrifice fly and Garret Anderson's homer. Sierra homered in the bottom half.

The nationally-ranked women's water polo club won the Midwest Conference Championship this weekend at Rolfs Aquatic Center. In the most dominating individual perfor­mance ever achieved by an Irish team member, captain Lauren Kuzniar scored all seven goals in the finals to lead the Irish to a 7 ­6 upset of No. 3 Miami Ohio. Llz Parolin, who had found the back of the net five times in the semifi­nals, accounted for five assists in the finals. In avenging a loss last week to Miami. the IrL<;h claimed their second championship in four years. Brigette Alge was outstanding in goal, recording 15 saves in the finals against the Red Hawks. 
In the quarterfinals, the Irish defeated Washington University of St. Louis, 17-0, and in the semifinals, overwhelmed Grand Valley State, 14-1, to set the stage for an intense finals. With the championship goes an auto­matic berth to the National Championships, May 4-6, in Atlanta at Emory University. 
Gymnastics 
The Notre Dame Gymnastics Team was victorious over the weekend of April 5-6, at the 2002 NAIGC National Championships held at Ohio State. The women's team captured the fifth place tro­phy. 
On the women's side, the com­petition was close as they fin­ished just .025 behind a third place tie with Syracuse and North Carolina, and only a 1.1 points separated them from national champs Texas. The team included seniors Chrissy Dehmer and Katie Bonchonsky. junior Emily Smith, and fresh­men Caitlin O'Brien, Mary Blazewicz, Susan Jennings and Danielle Reyes. Both Smith and O'Brien finished in the top 10 all­around and qualified for event finals held during the second day of competition. At the end of the meet, Smith had become the 2002 National Bar Champion, and received fourth place on floor and fifth place on beam. O'Brien finished in fourth place on vault and sixth place on floor. Other top finishers included Blazewicz, who finished 16th on vault, 32nd on beam and 26th all-around and Bonchonsky who finished 30th on bars and 38th all-around. 
The men's team, led by Guido DiStefano, Pete Blouin and Tony Mrrabile. Pete will be leading the team next year as co-president and men's team captain.

Rob Bruggner's all-around play on offense and defense comple­mented the standout offensive combination of Jamison Klang passing to Cory Padesky as the ultimate club firushed runner-up to Illinois in the Sectionals. On Saturday the Irish swept four opponents. Augustana and Indiana B were dispatched quickly and then the Irish came from behind to defeat Ball State. Chicago fell in the quarterfinals. Two dramatic games were played on Sunday, as freshman Andrew Hochstedler gave the team a lift on both sides of the disc. After trailing Indiana A 8-4 at the half, the Irish stormed back to pull out a 15-14 thriller. The Irish started slow against ond half rally, the club tied the

Sailing 
The unseasonable weather of 
this past weekend \vreckcd havoc 
with the MCSA / Doyle Women's 
Dinghy Championship at 
Northwestern. Lake Michigan's 
7-foot waves created problems as 
boats tried to burst through the 
breakers to get off the beach. 
With jib windows breaking and 
blowing out, the Notre Dame 
boat did a cartwheel, bow first, 
resulting in a bent mast. Ohio 
experienced a violent capsize 
with waves kicking the boat as it 
went over, resulting in a broken 
mast in two places. A number of 
boats had jibs and mains blown 
out, while Northwestern cap­
sized, breaking the centerboard. 
Northwestern's rescue squads 
were exceptionally busy and per­
formed admirably. 
Amidst snow flurries, sleet, and 
bitterly cold winds, the race was 
held in Ann Arbor. The Irish 
placed eighth overall, highlighted 
by Nell Ryan's and Katie 
Brandes' fourth place finish in 
the A Division. Katie Roney and 
Katie Thompson finished eighth 
in the B Division.

Redwine and hurdler Selim Nurudeen. They competed at the Pomona Invitational on Friday and at Mt. SAC Sunday. 
Nurudeen placed 11th in the 400-meter hurdles and 12th in the 110-meter hurdles at 
Pomona before adding a sec­ond -place finish in his heat of the 110-hurdles at Mt. SAC. His speed and tech­nique were impressive at both meets, 
but he was slowed as he hit hurdles both days. 
"At Pomona in the 400-hur­dles he was really running well but he clobbered the 10th hurdle and had to fight just to stay up on his feet," sprints coach John Millar said of Nurudeen's 55.05 second mark at Pomona. "His time wasn't very good but he really looked like he was running well up until that point." 
Redwine finished in a tie for fourth-place in the high jump with a leap of 6-8 3/4 at Pomona and sat out the Mt. SAC meet. 
"He's progressively getting better and better with his heights each week," field events coach Scott Windsor said. "We adjusted his approach just two days before they left, so he adjusted very well. He's coming along really well."

SPRING FOOTBALL 

Pleasing the ·crowd 
High expectations for Notre Dame put pressure on football program to stay above the rest of college football 

By JOE HETTLER 
Assisrant Sports Edi tor 
With spring practice nearly complete, another football season looms on the horizon for the Notre Dame football team. As the season begins, the expec­tations of the Notre Dame football team will be where they always have been ­very high. 
Fans expect the Irish to not only win, but win convincingly. 
Notre Dame is supposed to be successful, while playing 
vice president of public affairs and com­munication, Notre Dame must attempt to please several different groups of fans. 
"I almost never talk about the public," Nanni said. "We talk about several dif­ferent publics. For example, how alum­ni might perceive Notre Dame football might be very different than our aspira­tional peer universities perceive Notre Dame football, or how ESPN viewers perceive Notre Dame football." 
Nanni also believes the expectations set on Notre Dame by the different 
groups of people 
are very clear­

"We're going to do it the Notre Dame way," Notre Dame Athletic Director Kevin White said. "We're going to do it from an academic performance stand­point, we're going to do it from a posi­tion that's the top of a sub-sector. We're going to make sure our student athletes graduate. We're going to make sure we attract the right kind of folks that are a great representative of this institution, and we're going to run a clean program, and we're going to win on Saturday as well."

represents the values, the integrity, and the strong appreciation for excellence in acade­mics and in world character across the board. They expect us to run an excel­lent football program across the board, on and off the field." 
Situations such as the alleged rape of a student manager by four football play­ers or the George O'Leary debacle put an incredible amount of pressure on Notre Dame to make sure public per­ception is not damaged.
