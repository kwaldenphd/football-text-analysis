Ford donates $6 111illion to Kellogg Institute 
Teaching, research, outreach in development studies to be incorporated through new program 
ByJOHN TIERNEY. 
News Writer 
University trustee W. Douglas Ford has donated $6 million to fund a new pro­gram in development that will focus on research ­including some in connection with Notre Dame's Millennium Development Initiative. 
The Kellogg Institute announced the creation of the Ford Family Program in Human Development Studies and Solidarity, which will be directed by Father Bob Dowd, an assistant professor of political science specializ­ing in African studies. 
The program is designed to reflect the mission of the University at large by "chan­neling the incredible power of the human mind toward service of God and the com­mon good," Dowd said. 
The new program will incorporate teaching, research and outreach in the field of development studies, Dowd said. It will allow stu­dent and faculty research in development studies to be "devoted to real problems experienced by real people," he said. 
The Ford Family Program is about to begin conducting a survey in conjunction with the people of Nnindye, a small village in central Uganda. Dowd said Notre Dame students will work with Uganda Martyrs University students this sum­mer to help develop and implement this survey. Once the survey is concluded, the Ford Family Program will work with the people of Nnindye to implement its results. 
"The Fords' gift allows us to transform the Notre Dame Millennium Development Initiative into a rather com­prehensive program that integrates teaching, research and outreach," Dowd said. 
The Ford Program plans to welcome the participation of Notre Dame undergraduates in all steps of its research. "We will always do our best to work with Notre Dame students to develop research

Braun, Reish spar in final debate 
Current VP focuses

on passzon, experzence 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY 
News Writer ~ 
Student body president and vice presidential hopefuls Maris Braun and George Chaimberlain highlighted their experience and passion for the job Wednesday in an attempt to differentiate them­selves from opponents Bob Reish and Grant Schmidt in the final debate before today's run-off election. 
Rnish and Schmidt emerged from Monday's primary with morn than 48 percent of the vote. Braun-Chaimberlain placed second with 22 per­cent. Today's voting -from 8 a.m. through 8 p.m. -will decide the next student body presidency. 
Braun, who is the current student body vice president, has built a campaign around several platform ideas as well as her experience this year working with the South Bend Common Council to alter sig­nificantly the proposed party permit ordinance. 
Braun said she wants to improve community relations by increasing security on campus. She believes that stu­dents would be more willing to go out into the community if they felt safer on campus. 
"The city ordinance proved that community relations are no where near what they should be," Braun said.

Fortner Irish coach aids Katrina victims 
By ELIZABETH KELLY 
News Writer 
On Wednesday, former Notre Dame basketball coach and current ESPN commentator Digger Phelps returned to his favorite place in the world -Notre Dame. 
In conjunction with the University's annual Ethics Week. Phelps delivered a lecturH entitled "Community Service: An Ethical Imperative," in which he shared his experience start­ing his own organization to build homes in New Orleans for victims of Hurricane Katrina. 
While watching coverage of Hurricane Katrina on the news, he saw footage of the famous 1950s rock-and-roll mustctan Fats Domino being carried out of a building during the evacuation process, Phelps called. Seeing Fats Domino on tele­vision amid the devastated city reminded Phelps of one of Domino's songs, "Walking to New Orleans." Listening to the lyrics, Phelps was inspired to help the dis­placed families in the New Orleans area. 
"I went out, bought the CD," Phelps said, "and when I heard the words, l cried." 
Phelps started his organi­zation, which he named Walking to New Orleans ­after the Fats Domino song that gave him inspiration ­by donating $90,000 of his own money. He then raised

Valentine's fever hits campuses 
Holiday to be celebrated with usual enthusiasm 
By ANN MARIE WOODS News Writer 
Despite a weekly high below freezing, sub-zero wind chills and near-blizzards, students and faculty will feel the artifi­cial warmth of February on Valentine's Day. 
Signs of the holiday are hard to miss at Notre Dame, with flower sales soaring at Irish Gardens, the florist shop in the basement of LaFortune. 
"We have every type of flower in, including orchids, and we have special Valentine's Day packages," general manager Ann Marie Szymanski said. While men dominate the customer base, female students are getting balloons or flowers for their friends, Szymanski said. 
For those who don't expect to give or receive flowers this Valentine's Day, students can enjoy the Glee Club's "Singing Valentines," plus a Valentine's Day dessert dinner at both dining halls tonight -and even the opportunity to find love at Legends' speed dating at midnight. Legends will pro­vide students with the oppor­tunity to meet other students.

Dungy delivers opening address 
Executive director of NASPA speaks to begin three-day conference 
By LIZ HARTER Assistant News Editor 
Saint Mary's third-annual Diverse Student Leadership Conference began Thursday with remarks by Gwendolyn Jordan Dungy, the executive director of the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA) in higher educa­tion. 
"Diversity is not some­thing that you Dungy are going to do just today, just this conference," Dungy said. "It is something that is being planned for this institution." 

College president Carol Ann Mooney outlined the College's plans for diversity in her strategic plan, "The Path to Leadership 2012," which was delivered earli­er this year. 

"Everything [that plan said] talked about empowering these women [who attend Saint Mary's] to lead," Dungy said. 
Part of teaching students to lead is helping them engage in their campus environment and become active in the national environ­ment, she said. The way students are engaging in the national envi­ronment is partly why this year's presidential primaries have become charged with such enthu­siasm. 
"Part of the excitement has to do with the fact that there is something different than what we have seen before in this election," Dungy said. "McCain is the oldest person who has run for president, and it's the first time we've seri­ously looked at a person who is a woinan or who isn't white [as can­didates for the presidency]." 
It also has to do with the fact that the nation is turning toward the idea of a "Newnited States of America," she said. 
"When a black male chooses [to vote for] a white female instead of a black male and when a woman chooses [to vote for] a man instead of a woman, it's different," she said, emphasizing how these ideas are new to the country. 
Right now, Dungy said, we are in the "best worst" times. There are a lot of problems in America, but there are also a lot of resolu­tions to past problems, she said. 
Dungy said students are the generation that she is most excited about. 
"This is the greater generation. ... Our hope is in you," she said. Students today want to heal the

INSIDE CoLUMN 

Be your Valentine 
Mnn and women of Notre Dame, 
Spring Break is nearly two weeks 
away. 
We all want to be tan, lit and beau­
tiful when we'n~ basking on the 
beach. 
Though
thn tan will Mary Kate Malone 
havn to wait for the sun, Assistant Managing achieving Editor 
thn perfect 
figure 
should be no problem. Holt's and the 
Hock are open seven days a week! So 
sign up for six boxes on the fancy 
Precor treadmills, climb the 
Stairmaster, beat everyone on Holfs 
tiny track, and crunch those abs 
harder than you ever have before. 
Spring break is coming, people. 
And as the good Notre Dame stu­
dnnts you are, you've got to be at 
your best. 
Hight? 
Wait. 
Set your Elliptical level down a few 
digits and listen up. 
You're beautiful just the way you 
arc. 
In the prefaee to her play, "The 
Cood Body," Eve Ensler urges every 
person on earth to do the one thing 
so many never will: Love your body. 
"Tell the image makers and maga­
zine sellers and the plastic surgeons 
that you are not afraid," she writes. 
"That what you fear the most is the 
dnath of imagination and originality 
and metaphor and passion. Then be 
bold and lovn your body. Stop fixing 
it. It was never br{Jken." 
Maybe Evn Ensler is just an idealis­
tic playwright out of touch with the 
pressures of college life and the pur­
suit of perfection at Notre Dame. 
But I'm inclined to believe she's on 
to something. 
Maybe it's time we stop lifting and 
twisting and crunching and pressing 
. . . and start loving ourselves. 
It's puzzling how eager Notre 
Dame students are to help the world, 
but how slow we are to take care of 
ourselves. We volunteer at levels 
unheard of at other schools. 
And when the day is nearly done -when we've served the poor, fin­ished our homework, ate a salad for lunch, spoken up in class, cleaned our rooms and snagged the summer internship, we head to the gym. Even with a growling stomach or a tired body. 
Because, God forbid, we fail at 
looking flawless in our swimsuits. 
But the perfect body is as elusive as a 4.0 at Notre Dame. Many want it, few have it, and those who do probably aren't much happier than those who don't. 
So on this Valentine's Day, I'm choosing to not work.out. Eve Ensler is keeping me from the frenzied aftnrnoon rush at Holfs. 
Though a part of me says I need the exercise, a better, bolder one says take a break. 
I'm going to take a nap and eat a deliciously unhealthy dinner. It's not laziness. It's care for the soul. Try it. I dare you.

College named to 
service Honor Roll 
By KATIE KOHLER Saint Mary's Editor 
The Corporation for National and Community Service has named Saint Mary's to the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for exemplary service efforts, especially regarding disadvantaged youth. 
"Our commitment to the educa­tion of the whole person, a commit­ment that has been with us since our founding, remains unwavering; but the focus on the development of each student is not individualistic," College President Carol Ann Mooney said in a news release. 
"We are always conscious that human beings live in community. As our Mission Statement implies, our commitment to education is not solely to or for the benefit of the individual student, but also for the benolit of the broader society." 
The Community Service Honor Holl is one of the the highest federal recognitions a college or university can achieve for its commitment to sPrviee-learning and civic engage­ment. Saint Mary's was one of 117 schools that received the "honor roll with distinction" award. Honorees were chosen based on several fac­tors including innovativeness of projects, percentage of student par­tidpation and the academic service­learning courses offered at the school. 
Four programs at Saint Mary's were recognized, said Carrie Call, director of the office of civic and social engagement. These pro­grams are under the umbrella of the College Academy of Tutoring (CAT) program where students mentor students from local primary schools and include the Read-to-a­Child program, Pen Pals program and teaching assistants. 
"For the CAT program alone, we had over 160 students involved in 2007, which is 10 percent of the student body," Call said. "This is very high for a single program. Our numbers are quite high actually, higher than many other institutions. While we would love to see the numbers grow, I still feel very happy and proud of where we are now." 
Chief Executive Office of the Corporation for National and Community Service David Eisner recognized Saint Mary's commit­ment to service and the correlation with the College's mission. 
"College students like those at Saint Mary's College are tackling the toughest problems in America, demonstrating their compassion, commitment and creativity in by serving as mentors, tutors, health workers and much more," Eisner said in a news release. "They repre­sent a renewed spirit of civic engagement fostered by outstanding leadership on caring campuses." 
The Community Service Honor Roll awarded six schools with "presidential awards," four with "special achievement awards," 117 as "honor roll with distinction" and 391 as "honor roll members." 
"There are three levels of recogni­tion: the Honor Roll itself, the Honor Roll with Distinction, which we won, and then the Presidential Awards," Call said. "I feel strongly that it [the award] reflects the 'heart' of the Saint Mary's student body." 
The President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll was launched in 2006. It is cosponsored by the USA Freedom Corps and the 
U.S. Departments of Education and Housing and Urban Development. 
Call hopes the enthusiasm for service at Saint Mary's will continue in corning years. 
"It's a nice recognition and I believe it shows we are living up to our Holy Cross tradition of educat­ing the mind and heart."

STUDENT SENATE 

Group discusses Catholic faculty 
Informing undergrads about hiring process key at meeting 
By CLAIRE REISING 
News Writer 
The Student Senate began implementing plans to inform undergraduates about the hiring and retention of Catholic faculty and to give students an avenue to voice their opinions. 
Carol Hendrickson, chair of the Academic Affairs Committee, said sophomore Kathleen Donahue and sen­iors Amy Meyers and Brian Boyd will speak at a town hall meeting next week and give different perspectives on the issue. The meeting will take place at 7 p.m. on Feb. 18 in Room 102 of DeBartolo Hall. 
Meanwhile, senators have been listening to student opin­ion by discussing the issue at Hall Council meetings with their dorms. Senators who discussed the issue said the majority of students they spoke with did not support the use of a quota to ensure a certain percentage of Catholic faculty at Notre Dame. Howard Senator Erdina Francillon said, most students she in her dorm did not feel Catholic faculty were crucial to spiritual life on campus. 
"Basically there was pretty much a unanimous agree­ment that faith at Notre Dame is exercised more outside the classroom," she said. 
Walsh Hall Senator Anna Arnberkar said she received a similar response. Although students would be concerned if there were no Catholic pro­fessors at Notre Dame, a pro­fessor's religion did not seem to be an important factor in the classroom. 
"The majority of people did-n't feel too concerned that we were losing the Catholic majority because they felt like our Catholic identity [comes from] outside the classroom, and a lot of students didn't know [which] of their teach­ers were Catholic," she said. 
Some senators recognized that alumni may disagree with student opinion and wish to maintain the tradition of having a Catholic majority among faculty. Lyons Hall Senator Kelly Kanavy said that alumni have often been wary of major changes at Notre Dame, such as making the University co-educational, and that students should still be open to new policies. 
"If you look back on the his­tory of ND, or of any college, whether it is about to go co­ed or is about to start accept­ing minority applicants, I'm sure the alumni were up in arms about saying it's not right, but that doesn't mean that objectively, it's not the right thing to do," she said. "I don't think that what they say should deter us." 
Although the senators reported that most students were not copcerned about a predominantly Catholic facul­ty, Hendrickson stressed the importance of listening to both sides of the issue at the town hall meeting. 
"It will be interesting to see what people's opinions are once they've heard a really good break down [of the issue]," she said. 
In addition to discussing student opinion about the hir­ing of Catholic faculty, the Senate passed a resolution supporting the installation of clocks in every classroom on campus. Hendrickson said that if both the Student and Faculty Senates pass the reso­lution, it will be implemented. 

Pasquerilla West Senator Megan Sennett said she met with Joseph Schellinger, the director of academic space management, who said it would be "very feasible" to install clocks in the older classroom buildings that do not have docks. 
Sennett added that the University would use a satel­lite clock system, connecting clocks in the building together and reducing the possibility of theft, because they will not work iftaken off the system. 
In other Senate news:

Multicultural Affairs Committee Chair Ninny Wan discussed the progress of one of her committee's main ini­tiatives, a cultural competen­cy requirement in the Notre Dame curriculum. Wan said, some academic programs reported fitting another requirement into their cur­riculum would be difficult. For example, architecture students are already required to spend a year abroad, and engineering students have room for only one elective.

Social Concerns Committee Chair Karen Koski said the Center for Social Concerns and the Kellogg Institute are hosting a sympo­sium entitled "Solidarity in Pursuit of Authentic Human Development" on Feb. 23. A pre-symposium event to inform students about the issues will take place Feb. 19 at 8 p.m. in the Dooley Room of LaFortune.

Tim Matovina, another theol­ogy professor, will moderate the discussion. 
Brett Perkins, director of stu­dent resources for Campus Ministry, said the event will be divided roughly into three sec­tions. 
Each professor will present a statement of his Church's cur­rent perspective on the eurrent relationship between Catholics and Protestants, followed by a summary of important doctri­nal beliefs of their faith and how they dilTer from that of the other faith. The last portion will be left open to questions. 
Perkins said he polled stu­dents from Catholic fellowship groups Iron Sharpens Iron (lSI) and Four:7 about which issues they wanted the professors to address during their summary of doctrinal beliefs.

Thompson, a local minister and member of BCM, said he wants professors to clarify certain issues that might often be misunderstood. 
"One main area of differenee between the faiths is the role of tradition, the role of scripture, and how the two interact," sai!d Thompson, who helped plan the event. 
Perkins emphasized the importance of understanding the differences and similarities between the two faiths. 
"How close are we to being one again?" Perkins said. 
Noll addresses that question in his book -"Is the Reformation Over?" -which examines the current state of affairs between Catholicism and Protestantism. 
Perkins said the event is a follow-up of the Prayer for Christian Unity events that Campus Ministry sponsored in January, where services were offered at the Basilica and fea­tured leaders of different denominations and different choirs. 
But this event, he said, is more scholarly and aimed at dialogue and understanding. 
"This is more of an academic setting," Perkins said. 
Perkins and Thompson sent e-mails to students and faculty belonging to Campus Ministry special interest clubs such as lSI and Four:7 to encourage people to attend. 
Thompson said BCM seeks to engage students from all faiths. Calling its weekly meeting "The Journey," BCM aims to focus on Jesus Christ rather than one specific doctrine of a certain faith. 
"It's like a metaphor for entering into a relationship with Jesus and seeing where he might take you," Thompson said. 
Thompson said BCM held a similar event last April.

Iran experiments with uranium 
VIENNA, Austria-Iran's new generation of advanced centrifuges have begun processing small quantities of the gas that can be used to make the fissile core of nuclear warheads, diplomats told The Associated Press on Wednesday. 
The diplomats emphasized that the cen­trifuges were working with minute amounts of uranium gas. One diplomat said Tehran has set up only 10 of the machines -far too few to make enriched uranium in the quantities needed for an industrial-scale energy or weapons progr.am. 
Still, the information revealed details of the state of Iran's experiments with its domestical­ly developed IR-2 centrifuges, which can churn out enriched uranium at more than double thn rate of the machines that now form the backbone of the Iranian nuclear project.

Obama announces economic plan 
JANESVILLE, Wis. -Democrats Barack Obama said Wednesday that as president he would spend $210 billion to create jobs in con­struction and environmental industries, as he tried to win over economically struggling voters. 
Obama's investment would be over 10 years as part of two programs. The larger is $150 bil­lion to create 5 million so-called "green collar" jobs to develop more environmentally friendly energy sources. 
Sixty-billion dollars would go to a National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank to rebuild highways, bridges, airports and other public projects. Obama estimated that could generate nearly 2 million jobs, many of them in the con­struction industry that's been hit by the housing crisis.

The National Weather Service reported 10 inches of snow in Maine at Auburn and Lisbon Falls, 8.5 inches at Fitchburg, Mass., and up to 6 inches in eastern New York state, where ice was up to a half-inch thick. 
The storm system had been blamed for at least 15 deaths since Monday. Combined snow and sleet accumulations could reach a foot in parl'i of northern New York.

Bushsigns stimulus package intolaw 
Legislation includes rebates for more than 130 million people, tax breaks for businesses 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The checks aren't in the mail, but they will be soon. 
President Bush signed leg­islation Wednesday to rush rebates ranging from $300 to $1,200 to millions of peo­ple, the centerpiece of gov­ernment efforts to brace the wobbly economy. First, though, you must file your 2007 tax return. 
More than 130 million people are expected to get the rebates, starting around May. Congress, Bush, the Federal Reserve and Wall Street are hoping the money will burn such a hole in peo­ple's pocket.<> that they won't be able to resist spending it. And the spending is sup­posed to give an energizing jolt to a national economy that is in danger of toppling into a recession if it hasn't already. 
Whether people actually spend the money remains to be seen. A recent Associated Press-Ipsos poll indicates most people have other plans. Forty-five percent said they planned to pay off bills, while 32 percent said they would save or invest it. Only 19 percent said they would spend their rebates.

IN BRIEF 
WfO denmmce China taxing practices 
GENEVA -The World Trade Organization on Wednesday issued its first official con­demnation of Chinese commercial practices, siding with the United States, the European Union and Canada in a dispute over car parts. 
The WTO found that China was breaking trade rules by taxing imports of auto parts at the same rate as foreign-made finished cars, according to a copy of the ruling's con­clusions obtained by The Associated Press. 
In the sweeping decision, the three-mem­ber WTO panel found against China on near­ly every point of contention with the U.S., the 27-nation EU and Canada. The panel found that Chinese measures "accord imported auto parts less favorable treatment than like domestic auto parts" or "subject imported auto parts to an internal charge in excess of that applied to like domestic auto parts." 
Its final message to Beijing: "The dispute settlement body requests China to bring these inconsistent measures as listed above into conformity with its obligations." 
Scientists developing alternate power 
BOSTON -Someday, your shirt might be able to power your iPod -just by doing the normal stuff expected of a shirt. 
Scientists have developed a way to gen­erate electricity by jostling fabric with unbelievably tiny wires woven inside, rais­ing the prospect of textiles that produce power simply by being stretched, rustled or ruffled by a breeze. 
The research, described in Thursday's edition of the journal Nature, combines the precision of ultra-small nanotechnology with the elegant principle known as the piezoelectric effect, in which electricity is generated when pressure is applied to cer­tain materials. 
While the piezoelectric effect has been understood at least as far back as the 19th century, it is getting creative new looks now, as concerns about energy supplies are inspiring quests for alternative power sources. 
Retail sales experience rebound 
Economists call unexpected increase a temporary blip, attribute to gas prices 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Retail sales posted a surprising rebound in January follow­ing a dismal December,· although much of the strength reflected rising gasoline prices. Economists saw the increase as a tem­porary blip rather than a sustained recovery. 
The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that retail sales rose by 0.3 percent last month after having fallen by 0.4 percent in December as retai1ers suffered through their worst Christmas shopping season in five years. The increase was led by higher demand for new cars and a big jump in sales at gasoline service stations that prima­rily reflected rising pump prices. 
On Wall Street, the bet­ter-than-expected reading on retail sales helped lift spirits by easing concerns about the severity of the economic slowdown. The Dow Jones industrial aver­age rose 178.83 points to close at 12,552.24. 
But the positive retail number did little to change the view of economists who Shoppers put aside worries about the economy to go to malls and auto dealerships in January, pro­are forecasting the econo­

Yahoo battles Microsoft for News Corp. 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO-Yahoo Inc. is discussing a possible Internet part­nership with media conglomerate News Corp.., its latest effort to repel Microsoft Corp.'s takeover bid or pry a better offer from the unsolicited suitor, a person familiar with the sit­uation said Wednesday. 
The specifics of the proposed joint venture haven't been worked out, according to the person, who didn't want to be identified because the talks are considered confidential. 
Both The Wall Street Journal and a prominent blog, TechCrunch, reported that News Corp. is interest­ed in folding its popular online social network, MySpace.com, and other Internet assets into Yahoo ­an idea that first came up last year. News Corp. owns The Wall Street Journal. 
News Corp. and a private equity firm reportedly would buy signifi­cant stakes in Yahoo as part of a 

complex deal designed to boost the Sunnyvale-based company's market value above Microsoft's initial bid of $44.6 billion, or $31 per share. 
A Yahoo spokesman said the com­pany continues to "carefully and thoroughly" evaluate alternatives that will enrich its long-term share­holders. Yahoo's board reportedly is to meet again Thursday or Friday to consider the company's next move. 
News Corp. spokeswoman Teri Everett declined to comment on the Yahoo talks. 
Yahoo shares climbed 31 cents to $29.88 Wednesday while Microsoft shares gained 62 cents to $28.96 News Corp. shares slipped 10 cents to finish at $19.93. 
Based on Microsoft's current mar­ket value, its cash-and-stock bid for Yahoo now stands at $29.50 per share, or about $41 billion. 
Yahoo rejected Microsoft's offer Monday, insisting that its Internet franchise is worth more money. Microsoft has held firm so far, call­ing its original "full and fair" while threatening to launch a hostile takeover attempt. 
"What's unclear now is whether Yahoo is just trying to get a higher offer or if the company really does­n't want to sell to Microsoft," said Peter Falvey, a technology invest­ment banker with Revolution Partners. 
Although News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch unequivocally said during a conference call last week that his New York-based company isn't interested in an outright acqui­sition of Yahoo, he didn't rule out the possibility of a deal involving MySpace. 
When asked whether he might renew the previous discussions with Yahoo about a MySpace alliance, Murdoch replied: "I think that day has passed, but you never know." 
A News Corp. stake in Yahoo might hinge on whether the two sides can agree on how much MySpace is worth.

Police hunt for psychologist's killer 
Man entered office and stabbed doctor repeatedly before escaping 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Police hunted Wednesday for a man who entered a psychologist's office with a bag of knives and a meat cleaver, hacking her to death so savagely that blood spattered the walls and floor and the entire room was torn apart. 
A colleague who responded to the victim's screams was seriously injured, and investi­gators were trying to determine whether the attacker was a patient at the clinie. Three knives were recovered at the scene, including a 9-inch knife and the cleaver, which was apparently bent from the attack, police said. 
Kathryn Faughey's office was in shambles: Furniture was overturned, shades torn and blood was on the walls and pooled on the noor. She suf­fered 15 stab wounds, includ­ing a gash to her head believed to be from the cleaver, police said. 
"The condition of the room was that of a fierce struggle," police spokesman Paul Browne said. 
Investigators do not know the name of the suspect. Authorities released a sketch of a balding, middle-aged man bdieved to be the killer along with surveillance videotapes of the attacker entering and leav­ing the building. 
He left behind two bags that contained bizarre clues, authorities said. 
A roller suitcase was filled with adult diapers and women's clothing, including blouses and slippers, and a smaller second bag was filled with eight knives, rope and duct tape, tools apparently not used in the attack, police said. 
Believing the killer might have been injured in the attack, authorities issued alerts to area hospitals and looked through Faughey's computer files for clues. They also examined sur­veillance footage to see whether he had been to the office prior to the attack. 
The attack rattled residents of the affluent neighborhood. They feared a violent slasher was in their midst. It also shocked the mental health care community and raised ques­tions about safety protections at therapist's offices. 
"Everyone in the building is very nervous, because we know that this person is loose. It's very frightening," said Linda Elliott, who lives in the building where the attack occurred. 
The attack happened Tuesday night in a 13-story apartment building on East 79th Street, in a bustling neighborhood just blocks from a major hospital complex, police said. 
The suspect, carrying the two bags and dressed in a three­quarter-length green coat, knit cap and gloves, breezed past the building's doorman, saying he had an appointment with Dr. Kent Shinbach, a 70-year-old geriatric psychiatrist who worked in the same office suite as the victim, according to police. 
The suspect walked into the suite waiting room, where a female patient was waiting to see Shinbach, and at some point went into Faughey's office and started to attack her, police said. 
It wasn't clear how long the 
struggle continued before Shinbach heard Faughey's screams and ran to help. The traumatized female patient, who was in Shinbach's office during the attack, was being questioned by authorities. 
The suspect apparently didn't recognize Shinbach when he opened the door and said, "She's dead," referring to Faughey, who was lying behind her desk, police said. He then attacked the psychiatrist, stab­bing at Shinbach and pinning him to the wall with a chair before stealing $90 and escap­ing through a basement door. 
Shinbach was in serious con­dition at New York Hospital with slash wounds on his head, face and hands. 
Blood was found on the base­ment doorknob, and police said the route outside from the first­floor office wasn't very obvious; it was possible the suspect knew where he was going. Surveillance tapes show the suspect deliberately leaving the luggage by the basement door before walking out. 
Shinbach screamed out to the street from Faughey's office for help, and the building doorman called 911 around 9 p.m., but by then the suspect had escaped. 
The attack sent shock waves through the city's large com­munity of mental health profes­sionals. 
"This is, I think, an extraordi­nary occurrence," said Sharon Brennan, a psychologist in Manhattan and a spokeswoman for the New York State Psychological Association. "It has had a shocking impact on the whole New York communi­ty." 


WJHY-FM owner settles concert case 
Company promotedfatal event where 110 died 
Associated Press 
PROVIDENCE, R.I. -The owner of a radio station that promoted a rock concert where pyrotechnics ignited a deadly blaze reached a tenta­tive $22 million settlement with survivors and victims' relatives, according to court papers filed Wednesday. 
The deal with Clear Channel Broadcasting is the latest in a series of settlements stem­ming from the Feb. 20, 2003, fire at The Station nightclub in West Warwick that killed 100 people and injured more than twice that many. 
The fire began when pyrotechnics used by the rock band Great White ignited flammable foam used as soundproofing on the club's walls and ceiling. 
Victims' lawyers sued Clear Channel, saying the rock radio station WHJY-FM promoted the show by running on-air advertisements, distributing free tickets to the show and having a disc jockey serve as master of ceremonies and introduce the band. 
Lawyers say the station knew or should have known that the concert it was adver­tising featured a band that regularly used pyrotechnics at its shows. They say the DJ, Mike Gonsalves -who was among those killed -had the authority to stop or delay the concert for safety reasons but failed to do so. 
Clear Channel Broadcasting is a unit of Clear Channel Communications Inc., the largest operator of radio sta­tions in the United States, and one of the brand-name defen­dants sued after the fire. 
The company has said in court papers that it had no control over what happened at the club that night and did not arrange, pay for or control Great White's performance. 
Clear Channel said in a statement Wednesday that it was saddened by the "tremen­
dous harm" caused by the fire. 
"While Clear Channel had no role in causing or con­tributing to this fire, we are pleased to resolve these claims and, hopefully, con­tribute in some way to a sense of resolution for the affected victims and their families," the statement said. 
The settlement requires the approval of all the plaintiffs and the federal judge oversee­ing the case, among other conditions, the court papers said. A Duke University law professor has been appointed to create a formula for the distribution of settlement money. 
The settlement also covers the radio station itself and Capstar Radio Operating Company, which is part of Clear Channel, according to the documents. 
The tentative deal brings to more than $70 million the total amount of settlement money offered to survivors and victims' relatives. Other defendants that have reached settlements in recent months include The Home Depot, a manufacturer of insulation material, a pyrotechnics maker and a TV station whose cameraman was accused of blocking an exit while filming the fire. 
Dozens of people and com­panies remain part of the case, including Anheuser­Busch, members of Great White and the state of Rhode Island. 
The three men criminally charged, club owners Jeffrey and Michael Derderian and former Great White tour man­ager Daniel Biechele, reached plea deals on involuntary manslaughter charges in 2006. 
Biechele and Michael Derderian were each sen­tenced to four years in prison, while Jeffrey Derderian was spared jail time and ordered to perform community service.

During what seemed like the 27th snow day of 2008 this past Monday, I found myself very tempted to invite my children to write this column for me. Stuck inside (again). unwilling to brave thn -17 degree wind chill Kate Barrett when there wasn't even enough snow 
Faithpoint
to play in, we engaged in a recurring conver­sation throughout the day about why they really need--excuse me, NEED -to have a Wii. "Please write (J50 words, plus or mir: us, on what it means to NEED something," I could have said. Of course, they would have immediately responded, "If we do it, can we get a Wii?" 
To tlwir credit, t.h.ey are remarkably tolerant of their parents' rPluctancc to evnn attempt to keep up with what they see as the basic NEEDS of any 21st century family (although our sev­enth grader is already hinting that when he gets to hi~h sehoul and will rnceive a cell phone he'd at least like "a rlncnnt one" -read, "not like yours and Dad's"). 
Smack in the middle of this first week of Lent, I have been thinking about both the gospel we heard last Sunday as well as the one we will hear this coming Sunday. They could­n't be more different: Last week, a hungry and vulnerable Jesus sparred in the desert with the devil, hurling scripture passages at him until he seemingly gave up and left. This Sunday we will find a dazzling, trans­figured Jesus on a mountain with Elijah, Moses, and the completely awestruck Peter, James and John. These two readings together quite fit­tingly kick off the season of Lent each 

year, and if, rather than simply read­
ing them passively, we engage our­
selves in how they speak to our lives 
and hearts, they ask us two critical 
questions for Lent: "Who am 1?" and, 
"What do I need?" 
"Who am !'?" I suppose, is an evolv­ing question -'perhaps it's better to ask ourselves, "Who am I becoming?" Either way, however, we can always at least begin to answer by going back to question No. 2, "What do I need?" Peter. James and John certainly would have asked themselves, "Who IS this Jesus?" after experiencing the Transfiguration, leading them natu­rally to wonder, "So then. now who am I? If I've given up everything else in my life to follow him, what do I need now?" .Insus himself' challenges us to ask ourselves, "What do I need'?" as we wateh him deflect all the "nends" the devil dangles before him. 
We would do well to hold both these readings in our hearts as we move through Lent (and beyond!). The devil told .Jesus, ".Just say the word and you'll have bread from these stones," but .Jesus could see the reality behind tlw "needs" the devil wanted to con­vince him to grab. They would lead him not to fullness of life with God, but to death. We also must examine if what we think we need leads us toward, not away from, our waiting, inviting Lord. The promise of easy results, allure, power, or status entice us toward illusions, like those shim­mering pools which continuously elude the grasp of the parched desert traveler, that remain nothing but false gods. 
Peter, James and John thought they knew .Jesus, but in the moment of the Transfiguration they saw him more 
fully revealed. !low could this event do anything els1~ but turn upside down not only what they thought of' him, but also their understandings of' them­selves'! The question, "Who am I becoming?" would have taken on a whole nnw light. And they, likll us, would find the answer to that ques­tion in the choices that made up their (and our) daily lives. What does it take to follow .Jesus, the more and more fully we understand him? As we become the people we are meant to be, what do we need? The apostles seemed to lind -as we might, too­that as they discovered who they w1~rc becoming, and the morn elosely they followed and imitated tho person of Jesus Christ, tlw loss urgent and numerous their otlwr nends became. 
So do my children really NEED a Wii'? No, no one dons. But for count­less eomplicatNI reasons, ranging from tlw plain old fun or it through to the ways millions of' marketing dollars ean make us f1wl likn our Wii-less lives are incomplete and inadequate, on some days t.lwy do believe they need on1~. Tho t.rieky part, as they l'igurn out their own answers to "Who am I'?" and "What do Inned'!" is to help them recognize how inseparable these two questions are, onn from the other, and the impact they have on our lives of faith. Maybe we get a chance to return to Lent every year so that we can continue to ask them of ourselves.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
I am writing in response to Mr. Caruso's article, ("Dissecting the Democratic Primary," Feb. 12), and as a student who eomes from a state that uses the caucus system in our nominating process, I implore him and his candidate, Hillary Clinton, to please stop crit­icizing our political process after it does not yield the outcome they desire. 
Over Christmas break, I went back to my home state of Iowa and was bombarded by mailings, telephone calls, visits to my home, and any other means necessary to convince me to caucus for Hillary Clinton. This I have no problem with, in fact, I rather enjoy it. What I do have a problem with, and what I hope and suspect is true in other caucus states, is when a candidate puts time and energy in campaigning and garnering cau­cus-goers, and then turns around and writes off the process and the people involved when they don't succeed as Mrs. Clinton has done. Mr. Caruso, and most notably Mrs. Clinton, claim that the primary 
Respect the educated 
In Gary Caruso's recent letter to the editor, ("Dissecting the Democratic Primary," Feb. 12) he discussed the constituencies of support for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. He described one pocket of support, the highly educated liberals, as "the upscale elite Starbucks... wing of the party." In saying this, he is marginal­izing part of Obama's support. I think it speaks volumes that a large portion of Barack's base is the highly educat­ed, but Caruso, being a Hillary sup­porter, dismisses this base entirely when he calls describes them as such. He does this, not realizing that he's insulting the liberal community of Notre Dame. 
As Domers, WE are the highly edu­cated, and we know what higher edu­cation looks like, because it looks like us. But Caruso implied that to be a highly educated left-leaning person, we are the coffee connoisseurs that hold conversations with the baristas behind the counter at Starbucks. Part of writing for newspapers is removing your own bias from your article, and Mr. Caruso didn't do this, and as a result he was disrespectful to those of us who do support Obama. 
Daniel Tostado freshman Dillon Hall Feb. 12 

In defense of caucuses 
process is superior and more "representa­tive" than a caucus because it is an ali-day process (which may actually be a valid argument) and it is in private. 
However, what they fail to mention (and often times misrepresent) is that a caucus does not force one to stand up and share an opinion, nor is it a negative way to run a pri­mary process. It certainly allows one to stand up and defend their candidate and share with others the reasons and grounds for why they have chosen a certain candi­date. IfMr. Caruso has attended a caucus, he would know that each candidate's con­stituency is given the opportunity to be heard ifthey want, and in the end, the col­lective group comes to a decision on which candidate is viable, usually based on the beneficial and legitimate reasons given by the caucus-goers. 
What primary-supporters like Caruso and Clinton fail to mention is the fact that a cau­cus is an efficient way to have issues heard, debated, and leaders subsequently chosen from the preceding discussion. What they fail to mention is that the privacy ofa pri­mary allows for voters to flip coins, blindly guess, or vote for candidates on the basis of hair, name, or other ridiculous qualities. While it is every citizens' right to vote and support a candidate for any reason they choose, this is the risk a private primary poses. I'm not claiming that primary voters are ill-informed and prone to voting on a whim, I'm just asking that the Clinton cam­paign and Mr. Caruso not write off caucus­goers that have already had their voices heard in Iowa, Nevada, Maine, Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, North Dakota, Washington, Nebraska, and Washington D.C., and those that will eventu­ally in Wyoming and Hawaii. 

Mrs. Clinton and her supporters have repeatedly made commimts about their opinion ofcaucus states, and since Nevada, she has all but ignored those states that 
Conservatism? 

In response to the Greg Yatarola's article ("Are you a fascist?," Feb. 8), I must say that I feel he is completely missing the point. You refer to conservatism as the opposite offascism, and in principle, you may be correct. In principle, con­servatism is, in a general sense, the advocation ofcaution regarding radical change. In the political arena, again in principle, it espouses limited government and decentralization. 
The rub here, unfortunately, is what policies the Bush administration has enacted under the banner of conservatism. You refer to those who compare our current regime to that of Nazi Germany as "morons," while criticizing liberal advocation ofgun control as Hitler-esque. You go on to claim that the only thing the "conservative" Republican party wishes to take away from Americans is the right to "abortion on demand." Ifonly that were the case. This Bush White House has fostered a culture offear and restricted more individual rights than any administration in the last half century. It has sold us on things like the Patriot Act, the restriction of Habeus Corpus, and torture of political prisoners in the names of "freedom" and "liberty." It has grown the size ofour (supposed­ly limited) federal government to record proportions, advocating spending north of $3 trillion in 2009, all while cutting the tax burden for the top 5 percent of earning Americans and saddling future generations with the bill. We were mis­led through (intentionally?) false intelligence into believing that Iraq was in pos­session ofWMD's and an immediate threat to our national security. Meanwhile, Al Qaeda continues to build support in places like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia with little to no diplomatic action on the part ofour government. 
All in all, over the last eight years our federal government has ignored domes­tic issues, fiscal responsibility, our dependence on fossil fuels and our global reputation in order to play Cowboy in the Wild, Wild Middle East. It is this foreign policy, not some fundamental hatred of "freedom," that has stirred up such a strong distaste for America around the world and especially in the Middle East. 
So in conclusion, Mr. Yatarola, I would ask that you take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Yes, there are ignorant people on the left, just as there are ignorant people on the right, and the "Bush is Hitler" pundits are, admittedly, more than slightly off the mark. You are correct in stating that conservatism is the political opposite of totalitarianism, but please, take a moment to look at the record ofthis president and the current size ofthe federal government, before you completely dismiss claims of Bush totalitarianism. 
Tim Flannery senior off campus Feb. 12 
have caucuses when campaigning. This is coming from the candidate who will likely fight tooth and nail to "have the voices of Floridians and Michiganders heard" when it comes time to tally delegates, nevermind the fact that she has already publicly said things to the effect that she doesn't really value the voices ofthe people in the 13 states and one district listed above. Instead ofdisparaging the process, the Clinton campaign should call it like it is: They simply haven't gotten the job done in a majority ofcaucus states. 
While I'm at it, could I request ofThe Observer some political parity? Could we at least have a couple other candidate views published in Viewpoint instead ofthe usual Clinton-Return-to-Glory-Fridays we get with Caruso's column? 
John Whitty sophomore Stanford Hall Feb. 12 

I'm no fascist 
Regarding Mr. Yatarola's article, ("Are you a fascist?," Feb. 8): I find myselfpersonally quite offended by some ofthe generalizations offered in his extreme argument that the modern left is a borderline fascist movement. In particular, his assertion that "abortion on demand is what's most important to most ofthe far left" is, to me, pigeonholing and generalizing to the extreme. 
I am not writing with a fistful ofmy own mud to sling back at Mr. Yatarola. Instead, I offer an alternate view ofthe left. In my view, American liberals, spearheaded by the Democratic Party, hold first and foremost the ideal oftolerance and respect. We believe that all individuals are important and that the differences between us are critical to the preservation ofour great society. I share Mr. Yatarola's annoyance with the constant invocation of Nazism and fascism -but I find it equally ridiculous from every quarter. To be honest, what frustrates me even more is the constant reference to abortion in every political stance and debate. 
Can't we move beyond these generaliza­tions? Let's respect the life ofall people by not putting them into little boxes and misconstru­ing their priorities. I'm sorry Mr. Yatarola's observations have led him to this extreme con­clusion, but the reality is much more reason­able. And to answer the question, no, I'm not a fascist. I'm a liberal.

Film, television vvriters back to work after 100 days on strike 
TV series prepare to resume production, but movie studios practice caution awaiting Screen Actors Guild negotiations 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -Writers have a reputa­tion as master procrastinators, yet they eagerly facnd the blank page Wednesday as Hollywood sputtered back to life after a punishing 1 00-day strike. 
One day after the Writers Guild of America voted to end the walkout, writers on idled TV shows were back at the studios, reviewing projects with executives or pes­tering their agents to set up meetings. Agents were pitching, producers were assessing how to resume interrupted proj­ects, and the little guys who keep the dream-factory engines running were just glad to be back at work. 
"It's back to school with all the trepidation of, 'Do you remember how to do your job? And did you forget the characters' name?'" said Eddie Gorodetski, a writer for "Two and a Half Men." "I want to forget all the strike stuff and just make people laugh." 
"We, like every other writer in town, have a million calls in to our agents and man­agers to see what's next," said Brian Sawyer, who with partner Gregg Rossen had sold a sitcom pilot to Fox before the strike began Nov. 5. 
Amid the relief, however, was caution: The Screen Actors Guild could go on strike after its contract expires June 30. 
"Heralding that the strike is over is a half­truth because we have the Screen Actors Guild," said producer Peter Guber, former head of Columbia Pictures, current chair­man of the Mandalay Entertainment Group and co-host of AMC's "Shootout." "The stu­dios, unless they're going to start produc­tion in the next 10 days so they can finish it befor~ June, aren't going to start the pic­tures. 
The strike reduced prime-time TV to reruns and reality shows and forced the late-night comics to write their own materi­al. For shows that went into reruns, pro­ducers and writers began meeting to figure out how much of the season they could sal­vage and how they would meet tight dead­lines to write and shoot new episodes. 
Dates were announced Wednesday for some series to return to the air. Among them were "How I Met Your Mother," "Two and a Half Men" and "The Big Bang Theory" on March 17; and "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" on April3. 
Rainn Wilson, a Writers Guild member and co-star of "The Office," said he was hearing that everyone on the show will report back on March 10 to shoot six more episodes. 
Early on, the strike was a hiatus from the daily grind for some. By Tuesday night's overwhelming vote to end the walkout, it was clear they were eager to get back to work. 
"The break has been long enough," Wilson said. "Everyone slyly around December was like, 'Actually, this is kind of cool.' Then it was January, February, you know, so we're ready to get back." 
Writers for "CSI: NY" were back in their CBS conference room in Studio City, tossing around ideas for two episodes they need to write from scratch in the next two weeks, about half the time they normally would need. 
"There's a fire, and it's clearly arson," said executive producer Pam Veasey, outlin­ing a story premise. 
Under such a tight deadline, the writing crew had little time to readjust to work after so much time off. 
"It was like we were all sent to a really weird summer camp for three months, but now we're able to come home," said "CSI: NY" writer Samantha Humphrey. Added colleague Peter Lenkov: "We want to deliver

He's kind of a very simple, very mun­black comedies pale grey in comparison. 
The great thing about the play is that there are literally moments where from one phrase of a sentence to the next you can actually be laughing hysteri­cally and just throwing up in your mouth a little bit. That's the kind of reaction I hope we can get out of it. You're laughing, but you're kind of guilty for laughing about it. What I would say to anyone coming to the show is don't be afraid to laugh, because it is supposed to be very funny. 
What have you enjoyed most about working with the·· St. Ed's Players? 
The cast that we have is really quite an all-star cast. It's . a lot of people who I've worked with before and people J. know from other shows and I respect them a lot from what they've done and I've seen their work in other things and it really is a great assembly of people. [It's a] very small cast, total cast and crew is about 10 people, that is all the people who work on it. I really like working with them, but no slight to them, but I think the real pleasure has been in the actual text of the play itself. I have been in three Shakespeare plays and there are parts of this that are bet­ter written than Shakespeare could have even written it. 
If you had to sum up the experience of "The Pillow Man" in one sentence, how would you describe it? 
It's been the best nightmare I have ever had. 
The play is scheduled to open on Valentine's Day? Is there any special or ironic reason for that choice? 
I think we derive quite a bit of irony from that [opening on Valentine's Day] because it's not really a date play and its not a very romantic play either, but I think if you come to see it you will notice some costume decisions that may or may not be coincidental with Valentine's Day.

Writers returned after guild leaders and producers came to terms on a key sticking point -compensation for shows and movies distributed over the Internet. Guild members are expected to ratifY the contract in voting over the next 10 days. 
Along with the 10,500 writers who walked out, the strike immobilized thou­sands of technicians, makeup people and other production workers. The Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. estimates the strike cost the local economy $3.2 billion in lost wages and revenue. 
"Hollywood labor problems can cripple this town. Everything depends on making films here," said Charles Griffin, an NBC sound technician out of work since December. 
With a much longer lead time, big-screen movie production generally carried on as usual during the walkout. Knowing writers were likely to strike, studio executives stockpiled scripts they felt were polished enough to put before the cameras without screenwriters there to make on-the-spot touch ups. 
That could raise some quality issues down the road for films hitting theaters this fall and into 2009 -or it might result in some improvisational gems from actors ad­Jibbing when a scene was not working. Unable to do rewrites themselves or even coach actors on dialogue changes, directors had to adhere to scripts or let performers wing it. 
Mousa Kraish, who has written four screenplays and directed two independent films but is not a guild member, worked as an actor on Adam Sandler's upcoming com­edy "You Don't Mess With the Zohan" and said the production stuck to the screenplay word for word. 
"It was difficult," he said. "We couldn't even improv." 
A few high-profile movies such as Ron Howard and Tom Hanks' "Angels & Demons," a follow-up to "The Da Vinci Code," were put on hold during the strike to await script revisions. That work now can resume, and development executives can move ahead with writers on scripts new and old. 
"There will be a flurry of activity. Whether it results in a flurry of deals is something else," said Larry Turman, a former produc­er whose credits include "The Graduate" and "American History X" and who now heads the Peter Stark Producing Program at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. 
"Agents, writers and studios are chomp­ing at the bit. It's no different than if you fast all day today, the next morning you'll be hungry. Everybody's hungry, but it doesn't mean everyone's going to get fed." 
Agent Toochis Morin, a partner in the Brant Rose Agency, said studios will have huge backlogs of "spec scripts" -finished screenplays writers shop around on the open market-to choose from. 
"In a way, it really benefits the studios. They'll be able to sit back and have the pick of what they want," Morin said. 
How long it takes before it's business as usual in Hollywood is anyone's guess. But screenwriter John Ridley, whose credits include "Undercover Brother," expects one constant to quickly resurface: That talent writers have for putting off work. 
"Writers, and I include myself, are the whiniest bunch of people on the planet," Ridley said. ''I'm sure the first day back, somebody's already saying, 'Where's lunch? Did anybody order lunch?' And the produc­ers are saying, 'Oh, they're whining about lunch again. We're back. It's really over."'

WASHINGTON Separated by only a few feet, Roger Clemens and his accuser were never fur­ther apart. 
There they sat, the star pitcher and his former per­sonal trainer, Brian McNamee, sharing a wood­en witness table Wednesday while speaking to Congress under oath and facing blistering ques­tions. For 4 hours, both men stuck to their versions of the he-said, he-said dis­agreement over whether McNamee injected Clemens with steroids and human growth hormone. 
Clemens insisted it never happened. McNamee insisted it did. 

His reputation and Hall of Fame candidacy poten­tially at stake -not to mention the possibility of criminal charges, should he lie -Clemens said: "I have never taken steroids or HGH. No matter what we discuss here today, I am never going to have my name restored." 
For some members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Clemens' denials rang hollow, particularly in light of a new account of his discussion of HGH use, revealed by his friend and former teammate Andy Pettitte in a sworn affi-
IN BRIEF Kidd-Mavericks deal nearing 
completion 
DALLAS -Jason Kidd appears headed back to where his career began, rejoining the Dallas Mavericks in the latest Western Conference megatrade. 
Kidd is the centerpiece of a pro­posed deal between the Mavericks and New Jersey. Various media reports say Dallas will send emerging point guard Devin Harris, veteran Jerry Stackhouse and reserves DeSagana Diop, Devean George and Maurice Ager to the Nets, with for­ward Malik Allen going from New Jersey to the Mavericks. 
The details still were being worked out, but Nets coaeh Lawrence Frank already was talking about life with­out his All-Star point guard. 
"I love him. lie's a very special per· son, but it's time for both him and the organization to part ways," Frank said before thP Nets' game in Toronto. 
davit. 

"It's hard to believe you, sir," Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., told Clemens. "I hate to say that. You're one of my heroes. But it's hard to believe." 
Clemens and McNamee by all accounts once good friends, rarely looked at one another. Seated between them was a third witness, Charles Scheeler, a lawyer who helped com­pile the report on drug use in baseball headed by for­mer Senate majority leader George Mitchell. 
Occasionally, Clemens stuck out his famous right arm -the one that earned 354 major league wins, seven Cy Young Awards 
page 15 
and $160 million-to jab a finger in McNamee's direction. Even when the pitcher gestured, though, he stared straight ahead. Just like the Rocket's mound glare. 
"I have strong disagree· ments with what this man says about me," Clemens intoned. 
Just like their stories, Clemens' Texas drawl was in strong contrast to the clipped cadences of McNamee, a former New York police officer. 
"I told the investigators I injected three people ­two of whom I know con­firmed my account," McNamee said. "The third is sitting at this table." 

Quinn denies alleged New 
Year's Day altercation 
CLEVELAND -Cleveland Browns quarterback Brady Quinn denied that he was involved in an altercation on New Year's Day in which a man claimed on an emergency phone call that Quinn made a slur at him. 
On a 911 call early Jan. 1, Seth Harris told Columbus police that Quinn was with a group at La Fogata Grill and that they were insulting gays outside the restaurant. 
"There's a group of football players, Brady Quinn from the Browns ... and he's trying to cause a fight," Harris told the operator. ''IIi<> friends are yelling at all o~. the gay people that are around here. 
Harris said he had a verbal exchange with Quinn. 
In a statement released Wednesday through the Browns, Quinn said he had dinner on New Year's Eve with lris t,rirl­friend and other couples but that noth­ing else happennd. 
Goodell stands behind 
decision to destroy tapes 
WASHINGTON -NFL commission­er Roger Goodell told Sen. Arlen Specter face-to-face that he doesn't regret destroying the Spygate tapes. 
"I think it was the right thing to do," Goodell said Wednesday after meeting for more than an hour with Specter, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary committee. Goodell noted that "we were the ones that disclosed" the New England Patriots' illegal taping of the New York Jets' defensive signals. 
"I have nothing to hide," Goodnll said. 
Specter, H-Pa., requested the meet· ing so Goodell eould explain his deci· sion to destroy the tapes and notes from the case, which go back to 2002. Patriots coach Bill Belichick was fined $500,000 and the team was fined $250,000. The Patriots also forfeited a first-round dral't pick.

DAYTONA BEACH -Tucked away in the back corner of the garage, far from the overwhelm­ing attention surrounding NASCAH's biggest stars, a world­class group of drivers went over­looked in their quest to make the Daytona 500.

Young golfers have tough benchn1ark 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -With two years left in his 20s, Sergio Garcia already has won 16 times around the world and seriously contended in the majors, including runner-up finishes to Tiger Woods and Padraig Harrington. 
"Sergio Garcia, he's a fail­ure. Really," Charles Howell III said in a voice hoarse from a commercial shoot and dripping with sarcasm. "The guy has had a hell of a career, but in a lot of people's eyes, he hasn't won a major, so he needs to hang it up and quit." 
Majors aren't the only problem, and maybe not even the biggest. 
It's Tiger Woods. 
Howell knows from experi­ence, part of a growing list of young players who arrive on the PGA Tour with high expectations and get buried under an avalanche of com­parisons with Woods. 
Howell, 28, won at Riviera last year by closing with a 65, getting into a playoff thanks to a late mistake by Phil Mickelson, and making three clutch pars to outlast Lefty on the third extra hole. 
It was only the second vic­tory of Howell's career, feeding the perception 
"At some point in 

that he's an is now 30, underachiever. time, it's going to be and while he

is blatantly unfair." 
Adam Scott took the trophy home from Riviera in 2005, although it wasn't an unoffi­cial victory because rain allowed for only 36 holes, and Scott beat Chad Campbell in a one-hole play­off Monday. Scott, 27, has five other PGA Tour victories in reputable places, such as The Players Championship, Tour Championship and the Deutsche Bank Championship. 
He has climbed as high as No. 3 in the world, yet get­ting to No. 1 can look next to impossible at times. 
"For me, all my life as a kid dreamt of being No. 1 in the world," Scott once said. "How am I going to live up to that dream? I've got to some­how figure a way to play bet­ter than this guy over a pret­ty long period of time." 
Garcia is making his PGA Tour debut this year at Riviera, trying to put behind him a season in which he was on the cusp of his first major until a bogey on the 72nd hole at Carnoustie, then losing the British Open in a playoff. 
Also at Riviera is Justin Rose, 27, who captured the Order of Merit on the European tour last year. Luke Donald 

to Q-school, was voted rookie of the year, has made the Presidents Cup team twice and is a regular at the Tour Championship. 
Howell is the defending champion at a tournament now called the Northern Trust Open, a strong field that includes eight of the top 10 players in the world, minus only Woods and Ernie Els. 
RiviNa is loaded with tal­ented young players, all of them held to a higher stan­dard because of Woods. 
"Tiger has skewed the bar to an extent where a lot-of times, the young players are judged on a little different scale, as opposed to being patient, knowing that in the peak of many careers, guys are in their mid to late 30s," Howell said. 
When he turned 30, Woods already had won 54 times worldwide and 10 majors, including the career Grand Slam twice over. No one before or after Woods came along has won so much so soon. 
"At some point in time, it's going to be unfair to compare Jack Nicklaus to Tiger Woods," Paul Goydos said earlier this year. "What he's accomplished is nuts. It's nuts. To even mention Tiger in the same conversation with young players and what they're going to accomplish 
Donald 
joked Tuesday 
that his U.S. schedule has him playing many of the same tourna­ments Woods enters. 
"Whether that's why I've only won two tournaments on the PGA Tour, I'm not sure," he said. 
The spotlight seems to shine on one newcomer every year, from Garcia to Howell, from Scott to Geoff Ogilvy, and others such as 
J .B. Holmes, Anthony Kim and now Rory Mcilroy of Northern Ireland and Jason Day of Australia. 
Scott said this would be an important year for the 20­year-old Day, a rookie on the PGA Tour, as long as the bar was set moderately. 
"Just to get himself steady out here," Scott said. "Not saying that he can't come out and win tournaments, because he c·ertainly has the ability, but a good, solid year out here would be great for Jason." 
Even now, that's what !lowell is trying to achieve. 
Scott made great strides in 2006 when he was consis­tently in contention, and that's where Howell was headed last year. He finished one shot behind Goydos at the Sony Open, and was play­ing well enough to win at Torrey Pines except that he was going up against Woods, who played a little better and won by two.

Zednik injury nearly fatal 
Panther players still refuse to wear neck guards despite wingman's accident 
Associated Press 
CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. -Even a neck guard may not have pre­vented Richard Zednik's near­fatal injury on Sunday. 
Just ask Jassen Cullimore, whose jersey was splattered with blood as he helped his Florida Panthers teammate off the stained ice. 
Cullimore has come close to having his neck cut open -and the veteran defenseman has the scars to prove it. But don't expect him, his teammates or other NHL players to start wear­ing neck guards because of Zednik's accident. Like helmet cages, neck guards are some­thing worn by junior and ama­teur players, not pros. 
"I've gotten skates up there," Cullimore said. "It's just some­thing that happens. You could wear a whole armor suit out, there but you're still going to have broken bones and stuff like that." 
Zednik was cut during the third period Sunday in Buffalo when Panther captain Olli Jokinen was upended and his skate swung up, hitting Zednik in the right side of the neck, nearly severing his carotid artery. He underwent emer­gency surgery and required five units of blood, and is recovering in a hospital. The accident hap­pened almost 20 years after Sabres goaltender Clint Malarchuk severed his jugular vein when an opposing player's skate clipped him. He also recovered. 
"Right after (Zednik's acci­dent) happened, somebody on our team said maybe we should wear neck guards," Los Angeles Kings forward Michael Cammalleri said. "I don't know if it would fly, to be honest with you, but there's been a couple of scary incidents and you never want to see that." 

The NHL always has had a macho culture. Goalies didn't regularly wear facemasks until the 1960s and helmets weren't mandated for incoming players until 11 years after Minnesota North Star Bill Masterton died from striking his head on the ice in 1968. Only a fraction of the players today wear helmet visors, even though their eyes are constantly threatened with sticks and pucks. 
So it's not surprising that NHL players don't wear neck guards, which are made of reinforced material like Kevlar or nylon, foam and Velcro. There are also hockey undershirts that include a neck guard -they look like a turtleneck. Some players, like Panthers forward David Booth, say wearing a guard is uncom­fortable and "chokes you." Others say they just give a false sense of security. 
"What happened a couple days ago, a neck guard wouldn't make any difference. The neck guard just comes this high, you know?" Jokinen said, gesturing about halfway up his neck. "If you watch what happened to Richard, the cut was a lot high­er. It's one of those things." 
Dave Fischer, a spokesman for USA Hockey, which governs amateur play in this country, said that's one reason the guards aren't even mandated at junior levels, although many players wear them. There is a concern, he said, that the guard can deflect the skate higher into the neck. A study on neck guards commissioned before Zednik's injury is expected to be fmished this summer. 
"There's no foolproof way to protect any part of the body from injury," Fischer said. 
The NHL said there has not been any discussion of mandat­ing neck guards. 
"Players are free to use them if they so choose," spokesman Gary Meager said in an e-mail. 
Paul Kelly, executive director of the NHL Player's Association, said it will take a closer look at neck guards. 
"The NHLPA will review this matter in detail and will contin­ue to ensure that our members are fully educated about all aspects of on-ice safety," he said. 
But there are a few players who say the league should do with neck guards what it did with helmets -require them for new players while letting current players choose. 
"If you start right now, the rule for newcomers, rookies, coming into the league, they have to wear it, it's mandatory, no one's ever going to com­plain," said Anaheim Ducks for­ward Teemu Selanne, who has ordered neck guards for his three children. "That's what Europe has done with their pro­gram. Nobody complains. You start wearing them in juniors, in mites. I tell you, it's going to save a lot of lives. Even if it saves one it's worth it."

pitcher told The Assoeiated Press in an interview from his home in Scottsdale, Ariz., on Wednesday. 
"I feel like I've been shown mercy in all of this," Herges said. "If I'm not standing there naked in front of the world with my big secret, I'd still be holding onto it, hiding it. It would still be eating at me. It's not fun by any stretch holding onto something like that, so secretive, so dirty. I'm grateful it's out there. I'm freed a little bit, a lot actually." 
Hockies first base coach Glenallen Hill, who was also implicated in the Mitchell Heport, and Herges broke their silence on the matter Wednesday by issuing written apologies for using perform­ance-enhancing drugs. They said they would work to make sure impressionable young­sters don't make the same mis­takes. 
They issued their statements on the same day Hoger Clemens and his former per­

That report eul­
minated a 20­month investigation by former Senatn Majority Leader Georgn Mitchell, hired by commission­er Bud Selig to examine the game's Steroids Era. 
In the report, former Mets clubhouse attendant Kirk Hadomski said llerges bought human growth hormone on two or three occasions in 2004-05, when Herges was with the Giants and Diamondbacks. 
"I just tried to get to the bot­tom of why I did it. Deep down, in my core, I'm not as good as I'd like to be. I'm flawed big­time," llerges said. "And I think the incredible amount of insecurity I have contributed to me basically not selling my soul but crossing that line."

Although Herges declined Mitchell's invitation to respond to allegations he used HGH, Hill, who played for seven teams over his 13-year career that ended in 2001, was required to meet with Mitchell because he's a club employee.

Giants prepare for 2008
School refuses female ref 
Officials investigating decision not to allow woman to call boys game 
season vvithout Bonds 
Associated Press 
KANSAS CITY, Mo.-Kansas activities officials are investi­gating a religious school's refusal to let a female referee call a boys' high school basket­ball game. 
The Kansas State High 
School Activities Association said refer­ees report­ed that Michelle Campbell was prepar­ing to offici­ate at St. Mary's Academy 
near Topeka on Feb. 2 when a school official insisted that Campbell could not call the game. 
The reason given, according to the referees: Campbell, as a woman, could not be put in a position of authority over boys because of the academy's beliefs. 
Campbell then walked off the court along with Darin Putthoff, the referee who was to work the game with her. 
"I said. 'If Michelle has to leave, then I'm leaving with her,"' Putthoff said Wednesday. "I was disappointed that it happened to Michelle. I've never heard of anything like that." 
The Activities Association said it is considering whether to take action against the pri-. vate religious school. St. Mary's Academy, about 25 miles northwest of Topeka, is owned and operated by the Society of St. Pius X, which fol­lows older Roman Catholic laws. The society's world leader, the late Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, was excom­municated by Pope John Paul II in the late 1980s. 
"/was disappointed it happened to Michelle." 
Darin Puthoff high school referee 
Gary Musselman, the association's executive director, said the organiza­tion will not make a decision until it confirms whether St. Mary's Academy has a policy of not allowing female ref­erees to work boys basketball games. 
If that is indeed 
the school's written policy, Musselman said, the associa­tion could decide to remove St. Mary's Academy from the list 
of approved schools and take away its ability to compete against the association's more than 300 member schools. 
St. Mary's Academy officials declined com­ment when con­tacted by The Associated Press on Wednesday. 
St. Mary's Academy is among 30 schools on the list that are not full association members but compete against schools that are. Musselman said St. Mary's Academy plays one or two games per season against member schools but has no 
more scheduled this school year. 
He said if removed from the approved list for next school year, St. Mary's Academy still would be able tci compete against approved schools that are not members of the associ­ation. 
Musselman said the associa­tion hopes to resolve the mat­ter sometime this week. He said he sent a letter to the school's principal, Vicente A. Griego, the day of the incident but has not heard back from him. 
Putthoff and other support­ers of Campbell said they believe state activities officials will handle the situation prop­erly. 
Campbell did not return phone calls seeking comment Wednesday. 
However, she told The

Associated Press 
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -The San Francisco Giants of 2008 are all about Matt Cain, Tim Lincecum and Barry Zito. Not to mention hard-nosed center fielder Aaron Rowand and a cast of youngsters eager to get their chance with nothing left to prove in the minor leagues. 
Barry Bonds, the hype of the home run chase and All-Star game, well, that's all history. 
"It's the post-Bonds era," Rowand said Wednesday after working out with his new team­mates. "We're definitely going to have fun. It's not Barry's fault. It's that he is who he is and there was a lot of atten­tion. That happens when you're one of the best players of all time and you're chasing a record." 
San Francisco will start life without Bonds when pitchers and catchers hold their first official workout Thursday. Players began trickling in Wednesday to get ready and take physicals. 
"It's on. It's time," second baseman Kevin Frandsen said, walking across 
sure the feel is going to be a lit­tle different without him because he's been there so long." 
Zito signed a $126 million, seven-year contract before the 2007 season that was a record deal for a pitcher before Johan Santana topped it this month. Zito then experienced his first losing campaign in eight major league seasons, posting career worsts with an 11-13 record and 4.53 ERA in 196 2-3 innings. It marked the first time he hadn't reached 200 innings since he was a rookie. 
Santana, the two-time AL Cy Young Award winner, received a $137.5 million, six-year con­tract from the New York Mets after they acquired him in a trade with Minnesota. 
Zito, who turns 30 in May, should be feeling much less pressure as he begins his sec­ond year in San Francisco. His struggles were a far cry from the left-bander's 23-5 Cy Young season of 2002 with the Oakland Athletics.

Swagger." "Do you have the spirit?" he hollered to a few teammates. 
After last season, manager Bruce Bochy spoke of the need for a new culture in the club­house and that "warrior spirit." 
There's nothing left of Bonds' stuff and Zito now holds down the corner locker where No. 25 dressed in the past. There were still a few questions floating around about whether the indicted home run king would sign with a club or not play at all, perhaps walking away with 762 homers to his name. 
"It seems kind of odd," said Cain, the right-hander at the front of a talented rotation. "For so long we've seen them build it around Jason Schmidt and Bonds. It seems kind of crazy that Tim and I and Zito are stepping into that role. It's a whole new experience. It came on a little quicker than we probably thought. It's going to be great to take that chal­lenge on." 
General manager Brian Sabean said all winter it would take an extraordinary offer to part with Cain or Lincecum ­all but calling them untouch­able -but he would always lis­ten. For now, they're staying put. 
San Francisco parted ways with Bonds after 15 seasons, with owner Peter Magowan telling the 43-year-old slugger in September he wouldn't be re-signed. 
"Bonds was just a pylon for this team," Lincecum said. "The team was built around him because he was such a big deal. Breaking records like that, how can you not be? I'm Kan. "I just happened to be the

because there 
was a micro­

scope on me. Even if there still is, I'm not perceiving it that way. It's all good now." 
He might not even be the Giants' opening-day starter this time around, and Zito insists he won't mind a bit. Bochy has several options and planned to sit down with pitching coach Dave Righetti to map out the schedule, probably announcing his opening-day starter Thursday. 
It sunk in Wednesday that this team was truly moving for­ward without Bonds. 
"I think we've had that feel­ing for a while," Sabean said. "In some ways you prepare yourself and in other ways you have to wait until you see it all play out." 
With Cain, Lincecum, Zito, Noah Lowry and probably Kevin Correia in the mix, the Giants expect to h·ave a deep staff in the pitching-heavy NL West. And a strong defense behind them, featuring catcher Bengie Molina, 11-time Gold Glove shortstop Omar Vizquel and newly acquired Rowand up the middle. 
The 23-year-old Cain went 7­16 despite a 3.65 ERA in his third major league season and reached 200 innings exactly. He is happy the Giants have shown such confidence in him and the hard-throwing Lincecum, who was 7-5 with a 
4.00 ERA in 24 starts last year as a rookie. 
"It feels good to know that we don't really have to worry about maybe moving," Cain said. "It's cool that Brian came out and said that verbally. We have a pretty good idea we're going to be here until some­thing crazy happens.

NCAA BASKETBALL 

Indiana coach investigated for 'major' violations 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -Kelvin Sampson's future at Indiana was in doubt Wednesday following the release of an NC..AA report that says he committed five "major" violations. 
According to the report released W11dnesday, the basketball coaeh and his assistants provided false and misleading information to univnrsity and NCAA o!licials. 
Tho allngations stem from a phone-call scandal that oecurred while Sampson was still under rncruiting restriction..<.; following a similar episode at Oklahoma. The NCAA rulml in May 2006, less than two months after Sampson took the Indiana job, that the Sooners machos made 577 illngal calls betwmm 2000 and 2004. 
The NCAA banned Sampson f'rom calling recruit.:; and making ofl~carnpus visit<.; f'or a year. 
In October, however, nnw alle­gations surf~tced after an internal review. 
Just five months after coming off of' probation, an Indiana inves­tigation found Sampson's staff made mon) than 100 impermissi­ble calls, and that Sampson had partieipatnd in at least 1 0 three­way ~~ails that worn prohibited as part of the sanctions during his probationary period. 
"It is regrettable, to say the lnast, that we are in this position, to rnspond to the allegations that havn bnon made about several of our basketball eoaches," athletic director Rick Greenspan said at a hastily arranged news confer­ence. 
''I'm personally, professionally and profoundly disappointed with even the hint of inappropriate behavior." 
Sampson declined to comment before the 13th-ranked Hoosiers hosted No. 15 Wisconsin on Wednesday night. 
At the time of the Indiana inves­tigation, Greenspan called the infractions secondary, although he said additional NCAA infractions could lead to Sampson's firing. 
On Wednesday, following the release of the NCAA report, Greenspan would not say whether the school planned to impose additional sanctions, but acknowl­edged Sampson's contract con­tains a clause in which he could be fired for cause if the NCAA rules Sampson committed major violations. 
Indiana has already forced Sampson to fi>rfeit a $500,000 pay raise and one scholarship next season. 
"I think thn sanctions we estab­lished on Oct. 3, we felt wern very significant and we felt very appro­priate fhr the information at that point in time," Greenspan said. "Any additional self-imposed sanctions would come out of a col­lective thought process and we have not made any decision on that." 
The NCAA saw the infractions as more serious than secondary violations.

two of nights from every night. They don't have a lights-out perimeter threat. They have hybrids that com­plement each other, and sometimes take over when necessary. See Barlow's 23 points against DePaul and Allen's 26 against Louisville for proof. 
The speed of the Irish fast 
break makes it necessary for every player to be able to score, regard­less of position, 

Bruszewski's and three of Williamson's. Five combined field goals from the post players. Not exactly stellar. 
It's a testament to the spread of talent on the team that Notre Dame still had 28 more points under the basket than Marquette and shot 64.3 percent from the field. 
"When you're shooting in the paint, you're probably going to do really well," Golden Eagles coach Terri Mitchell said. 
Gaines did what the Irish post players couldn't-she made high-percentage shots. 
Although she's known for her defense and assists ­she ranks seventh in time to time. It 
isn't just Gaines 
who played well; Schrader hit 7 -of-9 field goal attempts, and had 17 points and six boards. Allen scored all 13 of her points in the second half. But that doesn't surprise us. Schrader and Allen are supposed to score. Gaines isn't, at least based on past precedent. Right? 
She made us re-think our convictions. 
Notre Dame players have a penchant for hot streaks this season. For four games, from Jan. 2 through Jan. 16, Allen led the team in scoring and averaged 18 points per game. The next four games, Barlow 
did the same, 
averaging 18.8

take over when offensive necessary. Gaines has 
spotlight this week. She could be frus­trated with scoring only 6.8 points per game after averaging 9.4 last season. Who knows? Whatever the catalyst, the Irish better hope it sticks around. 
Truth be told, Notre Dame needs this unexpected offen­sive explosion from time to time. In a perfect world, the Irish could feed the ball to Williamson and D'Amico all day, and when their oppo­nents tried to double-team them, they could kick the ball out to guards Ashley Barlow, Charel Allen, Lindsay Schrader and Melissa Lechlitner for open looks. 
But life ain't perfect. Allen sat out most of the first half after two quick fouls and did­n't score a point until two minutes into the second half. The centers scored 15 points. Gaines did what she had to do for the Irish to win. 
The Irish don't have a go-to frontcourt presence to hold down the fort in the post for 20 points and 10 rebounds averaged 14 
points per game 
while scoring in 
double figures in each of the last four con­tests. Before that stretch, she reached double figures only three times this season. She's on a roll, and she kept it going by getting close to the basket and making the easy shot. After Wednesday's game, Gaines is shooting 
45.2 percent from field goal range. It's tough to do that when you're taking jump shots. 
Want ultimate proof that getting the ball inside wins games? Marquette made nine of its 13 3-point attempts tonight. The Irish took three 3-pointers tonight and made one of them. They didn't need treys. They needed, and got, the ball in the paint. Even if their guard had to do it for them.

enough to her," McGraw said. "We went to the box-and-one and, I thought, pretty effec­tively shut her down." 
Ellis finished the game with 18 points on 7 -of-15 shooting. 
The modified zone defense caused takeaways, which led to easy buckets on the other end. Notre Dame finished with 33 points on 24 turnovers. 
"We were really good on transition tonight," McGraw said. "We moved the ball, we threw it ahead, we got great shots. I thought ali-in-all the shot selection and the break was great." 
Marquette coach Terri Mitchell said she did not understand why the box-and­one was so effective against her team; she said Marquette had played against it much of the season. 
"Every Big East game has been a box-and-one. We see it every game," she said. "The bottom line is, if you screen and run the plays, the slips will be there and when Krystal has two defenders, someone's open so someone else has to score." 
The one Golden Eagles play­er able to take advantage of Notre Dame's defensive focus on Ellis was guard Courtney Weibel. The 5-foot-8 freshman came into the game averaging only 1.4 points per contest, but went 4-for-4 from beyond the arc and finished with 14 points.

Marquette in the paint 52-24, something McGraw said was more indica­tive of the guards' ability to drive the lane for layups than a particularly strong post per­formance. 
"It's a little deceiving in the paint because we were getting points from a lot of the guards," she said. 
In part because of its abun­dance of close shots, Notre Dame finished with a season­high 64.3 field-goal percent­age. Coming into the game, the Golden Eagles had not allowed an opponent to shoot better than 49 percent all season. 
"We're not going to win any ball games when we let a team shoot 64 percent," Mitchell said.

"We really needed to outre­bound them after getting crushed [in that area] by Pitt," McGraw said. "That was some­thing we talked about, how everybody was going to step up and do a little bit more." 
Notre Dame was stuck on 99 points for the last 3:20, but got the ball with 16 seconds remaining after a Marquette turnover. McGraw had guard Melissa Lechlitner use up the remaining time instead of try­ing for 100 points. McGraw said she did not want to run up the score on Mitchell, her close friend. 
"There was no way I wanted to get a hundred on them," she said. "I thought it would be in poor taste." 
Starting Saturday, Notre Dame begins a three-game road trip against at least two ranked opponents. The Irish start off with No. 21 Syracuse, followed by No. 5 Rutgers on Tuesday. They finish the road trip in Chicago against DePaul, who is not currently ranked but was earlier in the season. 
Notes: 
+ Notre Dame was select­ed as one of eight host site for the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament in 2009 and 2010. 
The NCAA announced last season that the Joyce Center would house the first two rounds of the 2010 Tournament. After the NCAA Division I Women's Basketball committee voted to increase the number of bost sites from four to eight in 2009 (revers­ing a decision made in 2005), it chose the Irish to host next year's Tournament as well. 
"Our women's basketball team has enjoyed tremendous success in the NCAA Tournament over the years," Athletic Director Kevin White said. "We believe this selection is a fitting and just reward for the hard work and dedication Muffet [McGraw]. her players and her staff have put in to make Notre Dame an elite national power in women's college basketball."

"Thflre 's not a lot of differ­ence from their No. 1 to No. 6 !singles playflrsl,'' Louderback said. "They'rfl a lot like us in that respect." 
None of Ohio State's singles players is nationally ranked, but the doubles pair of Angela DiPastina and Christian Keesey is No. :n in the country. 
"They have a grBat No. 1 doubles team that did great at the nationals," Louderback said, referring to DePastina and Keesey. 
DiPastina and Keesey upset the No. 1-seeded pair from Miami in the first round at the ITA National Championships in October before losing a close second round match. The Irish doubles team of Brook Buck and Keley Tell't won that event. 
Notre Dame's doubles attack will have to improve as the No. 1 pair of Buck and Tefft lost twice last weekend, with the Irish dropping the doubles point in all three matches. 
The Irish look to rebound and correct those weaknesses in front of their home crowd. The match with the Buckeyes begins a three-game home stand over the next four days. 
The Irish won their only home match earlier this year and feel they have an edge playing at home. 
"We had a pretty good crowd last time, and the kids are excited to play at home. I laving three in a row here will be good," Louderback said. 
The Irish look to increase their lead in their series against Ohio State at 3:.30 p.m. today at the Eck Tennis Pavilion.

Buckeyes to test squad at Eck Center 
Team prepares for three-game homestand 
By DAN MASTERTON Sports Writer 
After facing three top-15 teams last weekend, the schedule docs not get any easier for No. 14 Notre Dame (3­
4) when the Irish faee No. 47 Ohio State at home today. 
The Buckeyes are undefeated, though they have not faced any top­50 opponents in the dual season. Irish coaeh Jay Louderback knows that their perfect record is no acci­dent. 
"Ohio State is solid. They just have not played high-ranked teams yet," Louderback said. "They're well­coached, and we always have clean matches with them." 
The Irish lead the all-time series against Ohio State, 15-3, and have not lost to the Buckeyes in IX years. Notre Dame's dominance is represen­tative of the strength of the program, but Louderback recognizes that things could have gone either way. 
"We've been lucky and won some tight ones," Louderback said. "They've been good matches, and we've been fortunate to come out on top." 
This year's Ohio State team is deep. Its No. 3 through No. 6 singles play-

For a 5-foot-7 guard, senior Tulyah Gaines played awfully well in the paint. 
Of Gaines' 10 field goals Wednesday in Notre Dame's 99-76 win over Marquette, nine of them were layups. Gaines sliced her way to the basket all night en route to a season­high 22 points.
