Sometimes 'just downtown' is not just a few miles from campus 
At 10 a.m. on a football Saturday, three Notre Dame students hop into their green mustang for a few hours of bargain hunting. 
Broke, as usual, they decide to hit the resale shops in hopes of unearthing some cheap dorm furnishings and other 'fun' stuff. 
Since the game is at night, they are able to leave campus before the alumni descend and traffic pours in one way toward the Dome. They breeze downtown, their conversation a mixture ofstock South Bend com­plaints, gossip and laughter, and pull into the parkinglot of the St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Shop. 
Inside, they root through clothes, books and furniture, quickly filling a shopping cart with irresis­table bargains. 
"Check out this Chinese coat. Wouldn't this be great at like a Halloween party?" "Look at these jeans. Do believe we actually used to think these elephant legs were cool?" They stand, laughing at a pair of ridiculous pink plat­

While the mother fumbles through her purse, the weight of the two children on one end of the carriage upsets its precarious balance. The children topple onto the linoleum, and glass shatters as one of the students drops an armful of dishes in an attempt to rescue the baby. 
The student quickly grabs the child, more frightened

students stand and watch it pass, returning to their shop­ping only when the screams have rolled away. 
Finally, when there are no racks left to peruse, the three sort through their overflowing carts ofparapher­nalia and select the items they actually intend to buy. 
"Only $2 for this sweater? IfI wear it once it's worth the money." 
"Should I buy this skirt?" 
"Sure, it's only a quarter." 
As they stand in the checkout line with armloads of 'fun' stuff, the grey baby carriage pulls up behind them. The carriage is still crying, but they now see the baby boy who is the cause. His eyes are brown and slanted and his sweater blue and dingy. He and his sister wear clothes that are indistinguishable from those on the thrift shop racks. 
The mother lifts her child from the stroller and tries to sti.fte his screams with one arm and hold her pur­chases, mostly children's clothing, with the other. When the baby calms down, she hands him to the little 
and more money. 

Dad soon enters and shoves a tatooed arm into his Levis, somehow produc­ing the final quarter. As the carriage departs, the little red-head excitedly relates to the six-year-old how she fell over and her lip "was bleeding." 
The students pay for their bargains in silence and head out toward their green mustang. "So do you think the team will pull it off tonight?" one asks, tentatively. And they return to campus.

Campaign rhetoric on the rise 
Associated Press 
President Reagan said yesterday that Walter Mondale had confused the liberation of Grenada from "Communist thugs" with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, while his Democratic opponent accused the president of timing toxic waste cleanups to coincide with the ebb and flow of the campaign. 
Reagan campaigned in Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina, seeking to solidify his support in the region. Mondale, meanwhile, stopped at a toxic waste site in Missouri before heading to California. 
The president told students at the University of Alabama, "When we liberated Grenada from Communist thugs, we were being a good friend to our Caribbean neighbor." 
Reagan said Mondale initially criticized the military action, al· though more recently the Demo­cratic presidential nominee has said it may have been needed to save American lives. 
Continuing his anti-Mondale rhet­oric as the second presidential debate approaches, Reagan said: "My opponent, by the way, seems to have that liberation confused with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. 
He said that what we did in Grenada 
eroded 'our moral authority' to 
criticizethesoviets." The president cited statements by McCarthy. 
Saint Mary's plans on offering the option of lofts to dorm residents next year, although oniy lofts built from the kits sold by the College would be allowed. 
The board was surprised to hear that the cost for a loft is estimated at S160 per person. Commenting that supplies and labor lie behind the high costs, McCarthy said the cost brought in the problem of resale. "With the wear and tear taking place over the years, they just wouldn't sell for the same price." 
Lee Ann Franks, student body president, addressed the board, ur­ging them to attend the various stu­

Is the administration the students keeper? 
Very few of us have been unaffected by the alcohol policy, a document which rivals the importance of the Constitution for most stu­dents here. When it was created, the docu-

liability, and if it did, the liability was of sec­ondary importance in comparison with our own well being. The impression created was not unlike one ofSt. George rushing in to save the damsel from the fierce fire-breathing dragon with beer on its breath. 
Yet, over the summer, the interpretation changed. It changed with the sudden dismis­sal of a lar~e number of administrators with apparent disregard for their family and future. It changed with the installation of a new breed ofpresidents, vice-presidents and other officers. It changed with the addition ofa ple­thora of new directives to the alcohol policy. 
The name of the game is now liability. If, indeed, there ever was a concern for the stu­dents, it is gone. It has been replaced by a dol­lar sign. In an attempt to shield itself from the age oflawsuits, the University has forgotten its reason for existence. 
There was a time, not so long ago, when this school stood behindits students and said, "We are proud of these young adults. We are not ashamed to take credit for them." Somehow, this does not coincide with the recent mandate which demands that others take re­sponsibility for us during off-campus social events. Neither does it coincide with the en­ding of the football "tunnel" tradition by claiming that it is instigated by "nonstudent

r' 
whether it is funny. Do not forewarn or challenge. 
r 
For this reason, the same man thought Shakespeare's Mark Anthony

outrider 
shed them now." And Shelley was a bad poet when he wrote: "I fall upon the thorns oflife! I bleed!" 
I wish my teacher had got to Walter Mondale in his formative years. He seems convinced that the way to showleadership is to keep saying, "I am a leader -watch me, I'm leading." He had a number of ways of repeating this message in his Sunday debate with the president. "I'm standing up to the issue ... I think that's what leadership is all about." Or: "I've stood up and told the American people that that $263 billion deficit must come down." Or: "I am trying to provide leadership now ,before the election." He also kept telling us that the people know they agree with him -which is manifestly untrue, at least at this point. 
Mondale's is the Jimmy Carter school oforatory. The "I am good, I am kind" school. In the misnamed "malaise" speech, President Carter kept saying, "I am taking action" over and over -because he wasn't. 
So, ifMondale was so bad, what made most people thinkhe won? By default. Because Reagan was even worse. He was talking the same old nonsense, but for the first time he looked as if he were talking non­sense. It would be a nice point of debate whether Reagan was more ludicrous on the Constitution or on the economy. 
Speaking of the unborn, Reagan said they are "protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi­ness to all ofus." Oops, wrong document. He meant the Declaration of Independence -which is not a law guaranteeing anybody anything. Reagan could be impeached for unconstitutional acts, but not for un­declarational ones. The president has sworn a special oath to the Con­stitution. He should have more than a nodding acquaintance with it. Or at least something other than a glaring non-acquaintance with it. 
In his other appeal to the Constitution, the president said Democrats are trying "to hinder that part ofthe Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice ofreligion." The constitutional "part" he refers to­the First Amendment -says nothing about inhibiting religion. It says the states shall not "prohibit the free exercise thereof' -quite a differ­ent matter. 
But, in any case, how are the Democrats guilty of prohibiting the free exercise ofreligion? Reagan told us: "A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria, and a court rules they (sic) can't do it. And because it's school property." 
I defy the president to produce a single child ever prevented from 
saying grace if he wanted to. It is no big trick, you know. I have 
managed it in far more intimidating places than school property, and I 
roam the land unpunished for my pious temerity. 
What has been prevented is not the saying ofgrace oneself, but the getting ofothers to say it -and that does have constitutional implica­tions. Getting others to practice your religion is, precisely, a form of "establishment" when it is fostered by the government. It is safe to say that, in the entire history of this country, no child has ever been com­pelled by political pressure not to say prayers. It is just as safe to say that, in the past, some children did feel compelled by such pressures to go through forms ofprayer alien to them (whether they were Cat­holics in public schools, Jews, atheists or whatever). 
A self-proclaimed individualist such as Ronald Reagan should not have trouble understanding this. Everyone is supposed to make his or her own way in the competitive world. Why doesn't the president want everyone to say his or her own prayer? Nobody is stopping that.

elements" when it is clear that the students themselves are responsible. Apparently, we are no longer deserving of consideration, as no one wants to claim responsibility for us. Perhaps the next move will be to have faculty members sign documents which place the responsibilty for our education in their hands. One can never tell, after all, where lawsuits can arise and it is better to be safe than to delay the construction ofa new facility. 
Something is wrong here, very wrong. The "family" atmosphere which attracts so many to this campus is rapidly changing. Granted, I did not expect to find "The Waltons," but I did kind of anticipate "Eight is Enough." Instead, what I have found is not unlike Hitler's Ger­many. It is difficult not to picture the adminis­tration as simply loco rather than in loco parentis. Do they really know that we are out here? Does C.S.C. really stand for "Cash, Strictly Cash?" 
Given this situation, one conjures up rather gruesome pictures of the administration. One wonders what the reaction will be to the first tragic accident in which the University is protected from a major lawsuit. Will there be sadness or happiness? Will there be dancing under the Golden Dome? Will there be a champagne brunch, perhaps immediately after the funeral, in which the University's ac­countants relay the losses which will not be sustained to the treasury? It is, at best, frustrat­ing. 
Yet, while there are so many moves to place the burden of responsibility on someone other than the administration, a fundamental error is being made. Whether the law says so or not, and whether it removes a cent from our precious treasury or not, the administra­tion is still responsible for us. Does the phrase "Am I my brother's keeper" ring a bell? Whe­ther those who decree from under the dome like it or not, they are completely and totally responsible for us, for every last cell in o~r bodies and every last thought in our heads. All in all, it is quite a staggering responsibility, one which no directive can remove. It is cer­tainly something to think about while seated on the fifty yard line during football games. In fact, such a burdendoes not leave, directive or no directive. It descends and it remains. Sleep well, you who lead us.

College football's motto:Anything for the money 
This past summer the Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision affecting the lives ofmillions. Well, maybe not millions, but it was certainly one that touched the lives ofthousands ofcollege football fans across the 
Brian McKeon 
reflecting 
country. In its infinite wisdom, the Court decided to end NCAA control of football telecasts; as a result, you can now find games onat all hours ofthe day and, Ifyou have cable, on a variety ofchannels. 
What does this mean for us here at Notre Dame? You've seen the effect already. Only once this season has a home game in Notre Dame Stadium started at the customary 1:30 
p.m. In the old days (pre-decision), you could alwaysplanongettingup at about 10:00 in the morning, head out to Green Field, and be assured of a couple of hours of eating and drinking before the game. Now you can't be sure ofanything, because you can't be positive when the game will start. The other day I didn't get out of bed until 10:30 and was in­formed that I'd better hurry, or I'd miss the kickoff. 
"What's this? The game's not for three hours, it says so right here on my ticket." Sorry. Today's game is again carried live by ESPN, the same people who brought you Celebrity Billiards and other thrilling events. Kickoff this morning is at 11:20. "Brunch foot­ball," the ESPN announcers called it. 
"Brunch football?" What would Rockne say? What would Ara say? 
As usual, it's all in the name of the almighty dollar. Just because some cable network is willing to throw down a few dollars to show the game live, colleges all over the nation (ours is no exception) seem more than happy to move the start ofthe game. 
I understand that the revenue generated helps to underwrite the cost of minor sports. And I also realize that if we don't get the money, then that's cash out the window. But is the money really that significant? Think about some ofthe implications ofan early game. 
For example, what about the players? I'm not so sure they're able to play so early in the day. Air Force probably had some sort of un­fair edge over our players. I mean, being in the military, they're used to getting up early. Ifthe football players here are like the average ND student (as everyone claims), they complain about rolling out of bed for an 11:00 clac;s. They're supposed to play football at that hour? 
What about the student organizations sel­ling food at stands across the campus? This serves as a valuable fundraiser for many of these groups. How are they supposed to sell hamburgers and brats before 11:00 a.m.? Who's hungry for that stuff at that hour? Not too many people. 
Then there's your average fan who drives in on Satuday just for the game. Now they're forced to drive at strange early morning hours or, in the case of the Miami game, drive home late at night. 
How about the ND Band? The scheduling of 
games so early in the morning forces them to 
cancel their traditional pre-game concert on 
the steps of the Administration building. Is 
this longstanding tradition, which many 
alumni enjoy, to be sacrificed? 
Notre Dame it seems, with its national ap­
peal, ought to be able to dictate its own terms 
with a network like ESPN. The past couple of 
years they were so happy to show ND in any 
form that they re-played the games every 
week. ESPN has broadcast our games live for 
the past two weeks and will again this Satur­
day. Every time, the kickoff time has been 
moved to accommodate them. 
More and more, Notre Dame appears to be ·prostituting themselves in the name of a few lousy bucks. There was a time when Notre Dame believed that post-season bowl games would tarnish their image, so they just didn't 
go. Last year ND went to the Liberty Bowl, a so-called "minor bowl." This year a cable net­work decides when the football games will start. 
Where will it all end? Will we be in Shreveport, Louisiana for the Independence Bowl this December? Hopefully not. But, then again, who ever heard of a football game en­ding by 2:30? If the money's right, let's go. It's not New Orleans, but it's as close as we'll get this year.

Finnegan has been disappointed in the season so far, but is generally optimistic about the remainder of the year. 
"I want to make the best of the rest of this season," the senior says. "I think we can pull things together. We still have some chances to knock offsome pretty good teams. We have a great chance in the South Carolina game to get back on the right track."

Washington vaults into top spot 
Associated Press 
The Washington Huskies have become the fifth team to be ranked No. I this season in The Associated Press college football poll. 
Thanks to Washington's 37-I5 victory over Stanford while top­ranked Texas and No. 3 Oklahoma were battling to a I 5-I 5 standoff, the Huskies vaulted from second place to the top spot with 37 of 59 first­place votes and 1,13 5 total points.

had all year -an intensity problem," Grace explained. "We have people that don't work as hard as they should. We have people that don't know the price they have to pay to be successful." 
To make the loss even harder to swallow, the Irish learned yesterday that Evansville, ranked second in the region, lost twice over the weekend, once to number-three Akron. Notre Dame will play host to Akron tomor­row afternoon on Alumni Field at 4 p.m., and had the Irish been vic­torious over the weekend, a win in that game would have guaranteed them a spot in the NCAA tourna­ment. 
Instead, the Irish will be playing tomorrow only to save face and im­prove their 1 0-3-2 record.

out that we have a very scrappy club," Moran says. "We know that we won't score a lot of runs, so we are going to have to be more ag­gressive on the base paths and take that extra base. Since our pitching staJI is much improved from last 
t ~ 
year, any extra run could turn out to be the winning margin. 
"Our defense is strong up the middle and most likely, the corner postions will be platooned," con­
•t 
tinues Moran. "Our outfield hast plenty of speed, which will allow them to cover a lot ofground." 
Another strength for the Irish will be the depth on the bench. "Our bench is very strong be­cause of the talented first-year players we have," Moran says. "They know that they will be counted on during the more important spring 
season." The team will need to improve, and Gallo plans to work the team very hard during the winter and early spring. He knows that once the hitting comes around after more practicing, the road to the NCAA baseball will be easier. 
Texas not only fell from the top but dropped all the way to third place. Oklahoma jumped from third to second with 11 first-place votes and 1,072 points while Texas received four first-place ballots and 1,057points. 
"It's an honor," was the reaction from Washington Coach Don james, who had said he preferred not to be No. 1 this early in the season.
