THE WORLD TODAY 
Nixon Says Disaster Possible 
LOS ANGELES (UPI) Confident of victory, Richard M. Nixon 
Monday made a hastily scheduled visit to his Southern California 
campaign headljuarters and said only his election could avoid "what 
could be a diplomatic disaster" in the Vietnam peace talks. 
Standing on a chair on the back of a room crowded with 
volunteer workers, Nixon said the hopes for peace were "quite 
discouraging" because of developments in recent days. 
United Front: " ... It is clear that ifwe are going to avoid what 
could be a diplomatic disaster, it's going to be necessary to get some 
new men and a more united front in the United States of America," 
he said. 
The GOP presidential nominee said if he is elected, he would "put 
together those fragile hopes for peace that now seem to be 
hopelessly apart." lie said he was confident South Vietnam could be 
persuaded to attend the Paris peace talks. 
"I believe then, and only then, are we going to start down the .road that will end the war. And I pledge to you that we're going to have a policy that avoids more Vietnams." 
Tltleu Still Won't Go To Peace Table 
SAIGON (UPJ)-President Nguyen Van Thieu Monday reiterated his refusal to send a South Vietnamese negotiating team to the expanded Paris talks with the Viet Cong. "Nobody can force us to do that," he said. 
As Thieu addressed the mttion over radio and television, his aides predicted that 6,000 persons would attend a government sponsored rally at Saigon City llall Tuesday morning to stress South Vietnamese "self determination in political affairs."

Brademas Winding Up Race 
In one of the nation's key Congressional races, South Bend's liberal Democratic Congressman John Bradernas rates as a slight favorite over conservative Republican state senator Will Erwin. Both contenders spent yesterday campaigning in normally Republican Elkhart County, expected to be an area of unexpected Bradernas strength. 
Brademas is seeking his sixth term in Congress, and would under normal circumstances be a prohibitive favorite. However, two strong GOP counties, Kosciousko and Elkart, were added to his district and slightly Democratic LaPorte County taken away. Also, Richard Nixon, in spite of his popularity drop in the East, is expected to sweep Indiana by up to 300,000 votes, an 80,000 increase from his 1960 margin. 
Erwin's campaign, besides being aided by the new completion of the District and Nixon strnegth, has been exceptionally well-financed. The GOP hopeful was has hard at Brademas, accusing him of voting to aid nations supplying North Vietnam. Erwin himself is a prosperous farmer from the small town of Etna Green in the extreme Southern part of the District. As a member of the state senate, he has been a chief sponsor of mental health legislation. 
The campaign has seen heavy television spending by both Brademas and Erwin, with Brademas making ample use of his ties with Senators Edward M. Kennedy and Eugene J. McCarthy. The Congressman voted for McCarthy in Chicago and has made a considerable effort, especially successful at the South Bend campus of

The main issues involve hall life and regulations, including the right of an individual hall to determine its own parietal hours. 
Indiana University, to enlist student volunteers in a canvassing effort independent of the local Democratic organization. Students conducted a voter registration drive in September for the Congressman. A television program with Bradcmas talking informally to students was filmed in mid-September in the front lounge of Morrissey Hall and has been a keystone in the Brademas television campaign. 

Notre Dame faculty members have rallied to the side of Brademas, too, with more than I00 signing an add last night in the Soul h Bend Tribune. Many in the faculty have been moved by the endorsements of Brademas in national magazines including Life and Look, as well as glowing praise of the Congressman in the New York Times. 
Volunteers at both the Brademas Headquarters and Erwin Headquarters expressed confidence yesterday afternoon. However, South Bend Tribune political editor Jack Colwell and other observers have rated Brademas a very slight favorite. An 1:1khart Truth shoppers poll in areas normally Republican has  shown Brademas ahead. A major question is what strength former Alabama Governor George C. Wallace will draw among normally Democratic workingmen in Eastern European ethnic wards of South Bend. Indiana voting machines require that party levers be pulled when voting begins. If 
Wallace voters split their tickPts to overwhelmingly back Brademas the Congressman should win with ease. 

The size of the expected Nixon margin in GOP regions of the district also comes into question. The former Vice President carried Elkhart County 
by 7,000 votes in 1960, but Brademas was then able to withstand the Nixon margin by sweeping South Bend. If Erwin piles up large majorities riding along on Nixon's coattails, Brademas will need most of the Wallace factory supporters to win. 
The Brademas-Erwin race, while attracting national publicity due to the Congressman's prominence, has helped bring only one national canaidate, Senator Edmund Muskie, to South Bend. While President Lyndon B. Johnson, Senator Barry Goldwater, and Rep. William Miller appeared in South Bend in 1964, with Miller coming to Notre Dame, only Muskie has come to town this year. The Maine Senator spoke at Stepan Center September II th. Thus Brademas and Erwin have been left to battle it out free of help in the way of visits from members of the national tickets. Erwin has gone out of his way to identify with Nixon, and has blasted the ''J ohnson-Humphrey-B radcmas" administration. Bradcmas, by contrast, has steered clear of the Humphrey campaign while making expressions of party loyalty and warmly greeting Muskie during the Senator's stopover here.

The fact that people are irrational is one that raises an interesting 
problem for anyone who wishes to persuade others..That 
irrationality is little disputed by anyone who knows how easy 1t wa~ 
for Hitler to gain the support of millions of Germans. But exampl~s 
of that irrationality closer to home are seen in the effect of polls 111 
the United States. When pollsters announce that there is a surge for 
Hubert Humphrey, that announcement itself will help the surge. 
Why? Apparently people are subject to "bandwagon psychology" 
-hardly a rational criteria on which to base a vote. 
The question for any politician, or any other "persuader", is how 
to try to effect persuasion. Do you tell people what they want to 
hear, or do you tell people what they ought to hear?There are 
several courscsopen; first, you can lie to people and try to usc your 
statements only as means to the end of getting elected; second you 
can tell some of the truth to one group of people (who like that 
part) and you tell the other half to other people (who prefer that 
part). On no account do you lie, because that is immoral, and on the 
other hand on no account do you tell the whole truth because some 
of it is bound to alienate everyone to some degree; and third, you 
can tell the whole truth, because you think that is the only clearly 
moral thing to do. (Actually, come to think of it, there is another 
course which is more widely used than any of the above, i.e. saying 
nothing; but that I suppose is really part of the second alternative­
not telling the whole truth.) 

The whole question turns on the twin set of questions: how much of the truth can you tell and still win, and how important is winning? 
The answer to the first question really depends on the situation and beliefs of an individual, but in such cases as Barry Goldwater and Eugene McCarthy personal integrity and desire to tell the whole truth to everyone obviously hurt them politically. 
The second question is the one that really counts because it is the sort of question that ends up in a personal judgment on what end justifies the means. Is the end of getting elected important enough to justify telling people only the part of the truth that they want to hear? 
I'd like to suggest that you can tell the whole truth and still win; \but it's just not true that consistently. The fact is that popular, democratic government tends to produce (by a survival of the fittest process) leaders who are willing to compromise personal ideals of integrity to accomplish important ends. The fact is that people arc more easily persuaded by playing up to prejudices than by expounding logically and reasonably. The fact is that our ideal of popular, democratic government is just not that ideal because it puts into the hands of unideal people the choice between unidealleaders. 
The result of all these facts is that sometimes people tend to give up on the question of effectiveness versus absolute honesty, and that is where the danger lies. There wilralways be some doubt about the whole issue, but the danger only assumes its greatest proportions when people stop trying to find the answer that can't really be found. To a great degree the story of the Hitlers and Mussolinis and Lenins and all the others is the story of men who did stop worrying about the morality of means, and simply did anything to attain their ends. And if Americans don't stop and remember once in a while, that idealists who tell the whole truth all the time are doing something that maybe everyone should emulate, then they have forgotten one of those things that prevents us from doing something regrettable. 
of LOBUND research in the fields of microbiology, bacteriology, pathology, virology and dietary study forced the laboratory to cut across many college study lines and thus to become interdisciplinary. This year, for the first time, the instutute will be given its own budget, independent of other college funds and will be made responsible directly to the Office 
of Academic Affairs. 

LOBUND's germ-free laboratory is what interests most micro-biologists across the nation. Here, in a completely steril atmosphere, research investigators can inject a germ-free test animal with a virus or test an animal under various environmental conditions without the fear that 
test results are effected by disease already in the animal or by unsteril conditions. For example, LOBUND has made a significant contribution to cancer research when, under germ-free conditions, a test developed a cancerous growth, thus proving that a virus is definitely one cause of cancer. 
Director of LOBUND's varied research program is Professor Morris Pollard, Ph.D. Professor Pollard heads a staff of roughly 100 invesigators, technicians and graduate students, whose interests and education reflect the range of LOBUND research. The staff includes two M.D.'s, two D.V.M.-Ph.D's (Doctors of Veterinary Medicine) and the rest Ph.D.'s. Two visiting investigators, from Prague and Tokyo, are currently with the staff. Staff interests cover pathology, virology, bacteriology, physiology, microbiology, and radiology. To meet these wide interests, LOBUND will undergo some modest expansion.

MORE PERSPECTIVES 
Editor: 
Regarding Mr. Wolfe's column, "Perspectives": In the lecture entitled "The Bitter Pill" Fr. James Burtchaell made the point that it is not at all clear what is "natural" to man. At one time religious leaders condemned man's attempt to fly, because flying is not "the way we are". Clearly, any method of preventing birth where it would normally occur is, from one point of view, unnatural. Since Pope Pius XII in 195 I condoned birth control, and then specified which methods, namely rhythm and 
abstinence, were moral, Mr. Wolfe is on shaky ground when he condemns the unnatural. Fr. Burtchaell said that, to him, rhythm is the most unnatural method of all. Since birth control is sanctioned by the Church, a particular method cannot be condemned because it prevents birth, but the condemnation must come on viewpoint on this matter, may I suggest a couple of more fruitful areas for research. First of all, he could investigate the highly unpublicized side effects of the pill, information that is conspicously absent at "family planning" centers, as far as I know. Secondly, he could pose the serious question of motivation to middle class 
parents who feel the necessity to limit their families, as Fr. Burtchaell pointed out at the end of his talk.

WHERE'S THE PRIDE? 
tditor: 
When Pat O'Brien returned to du Lac last month, our tie with the heritage of Gipp, Rockne, and the Four Horsemen came the students are too busy to welcome home their Fighting Irish from the MSU game, the era when visiting coaches no longer fear the deafening roar 

from the Northwest section of our stadium, the era when the student body expects a 110% effort "from the team," but isn't willing to put forth a little second effort themselves to show the pride they all rave about, or the era when more 
S.M.C. girls than N.D. Men know the words to our Victory March. 
It is easy to philosophize about the reasons for this change. One could speak of the characteristics of the present-day college student with his emphasis upon individuality, freedom of thought and action, and self-rule, and with everyone so obsessed with "their own thing," tradition has been neglected, and enthusiasm is on its way out. 
Maybe it's time to realize that many schools achieve athletic and scholastic greatness, but from these others Notre Dame has distinguished itself by its 
great, all-out enthusiasm. 

What other school has such a loyal wild alumni? What school has a "subway alumni" or the likes of Pat O'Brien to preserve her immortals? 
Without a doubt, our Fighting Irish will come back and go on to an 8 and 2 season, but will the student body, the 12th man. bring back to reality the enthusiasm and pride so important to this great University? 
Thank you,
