Toss-ups, bonus questions, the buzzer and 
the bell all return to the airwaves whenCollegeBowl begins its third season on the CBS Radio Network the week of)an. 4, with a 26-game schedule featuring Art Fleming as host and Nelson Davis as an­nouncer. The CBS Radio Network version ofthe "varsity sport ofthe mind" revives the acclaimed game program which began on radio in the '50s and moved to television in the '60s. The CBS Radio COL­LEGE BOWL broadcasts will include 17 regular-season games and nine post-season match-ups from the National Championship tournament, highlighted by the title game. CollegeBowl is playedon more than 300 campuses across the country under the auspices of the Association of College Unions-International. Teams qualify for National Championship berths by winning one of 1 5 regional tournaments, or by capturing three wins in a row during several College Bowl"mini-weeks" where the games are taped for later CBS Radio Network broadcasts. The question-and-answer format ofCol­lege Bowl games pits two four-member teams in competition to score the most points in answer to questions .as asked by the m:>derator. Toss-ups, worth 10 points, are open to both teams, and 
the team responding correctly is offered a bonus question, for 20 to 35 points. The questions themselves are drawn from a wide range of subjects, including science, culture, the arts and history, .and are researched and authenticated by Time magazine. The Obseroer 
The University ofNotre Dame has added a 
sixth undergraduate foreign study program, this one for College of Arts and Letters students located in London, England. Since the es­tablishment ofa Sophomore Year Abroad Program at the University oflnnsbruck in Austria in 1964, Notre Dame has added programs in Angers, France, Mexico City, Tokyo, and Rome (architecture). Also, the Center for Experiential Learning has two small, culturally focused programs in Mexico. Some Notre Dame undergraduates are also enrolled in two programs run by Saint Mary's College in Rome 
and Maynooth, Ireland. The new undergraduate program will be located in Conannon House, the University's London facility, which houses the Notre Dame M.B.A. studentsstudying in England. Provost Timothy 0'Meara has appointed Edward W. Jerger Special Assistant to the Provost. He is charged with supervising the move into the Concannon House and with the sharing ofthe facility. The academic directors of the programs are Thomas Fern, Associate Professor of Art for the Arts and Letters program, W. Anthony West, Professor of Law for the Law School, and Raymond Powell, Professor ofAccount­ing, for the M.B.A. students. While in residence in London from Dec. 1981 to June 1982, Jerger will also examine the possibility of expanding Longon programs to include undergraduate science and engineering students.The Obseroer

A semester of Obs~rvation 


The closing days of a semester are usually a time of reflection for students. We all look back over the past f~ur months, and take stock of what we've done, and how we've grown as we inch closer to a degree. 
For many of us here at The Obseroer, this newspaper also figures into that personal inventory. After sixteen weeks oflate nights and enormous amounts ofcaffeine, I've begun to weigh the advantages and disadvantages ofworking as a news editor. 
For starters, this newspaper can take up a large amount of one's time. After awhile, section-mates have trouble recalling your name, and friends begin to leave notes reading "How are things going? See you at com­mencement!" Your roommate looks at you suspiciously as you return to the room late at night, and you know he's asking himself "Hmm, was that the guy I saw at room picks last year?" 
In addition, member's of this staff, like participants in 
an extracurricular activity, must try to strike a balance 
between The Obseroer and the classroom. This is .a 
struggle at times, and unfortunately, there are times 
when the scale tips in one direction, and something suf­
fers. 

Late nights, less time with friends, lower 
grades...there must be more 
to this job than that. Perhaps 
it's the fame. One reader, 
when I identified myself 
over the phone, replied 
"Jim? Jim Vercellotti? Yeah I 
read your stuff all the time 
Jim." Maybe it isn't the fame. 
The problem-solving that 
is part of this job may be 
what makes it attractive. 
Here is a sample of some of 
the unexpected hurdles that 
may need to be crossed 
during an eveningofediting. 

8 
p.m. -Areporter calls in to say that the energy con­servation lecture scheduled for 7 p.m. at Moreau did not take place. As a matter of fact, none of the good fathers there know anything about such a lecture. You calmly remind the reporter that the lecture was at Moreau Hall, not.Moreau Seminary. 

10:30 
p.m. -It's two hours past deadline, and one story has yet to come in. You call the reporter's room to 


find out where the story is, and her roommate tells you that said reporter is out on "freshmen date night." Somehow, that wasn't the story that was indicated on the assignment sheet. Two hours later, a very apologetic reporter returns your call, explaining that another editor had told her not to bother writing the story. All is not lost, however. The reporter had a great time on "freshmen date night." 
1 a.m. -The design editor reminds you that because the size of the paper had been increased by four pages during the course of the evening, you have two more pages of news to fill. Having exhausted the supply of campus and Associated Press news, you return to the wire to see ifanything new has come over since you last checked. Unfortunately, the most exciting things at this hour are the Joliet livestock prices. 
News Editor 
Insid~ Monday 
3 a.m. -One more headline to write. Headlines are written according to the space above the news story. What's a five-letter word for inflation? 
Yes problem-solving, when it is possible, makes this job challenging and enjoyable. With such a large or­ganization, however, there will always be problems. An important part of this job is the realization that try as you might to plug all of the leaks, there will always be one or two left over. This brings to mind Math 105, where we learned that asymptotes always approach, but never reach the axis. Perhaps that is a good way to characterize The Obseroer's news department. Perfec­tion may never be reached, but we try to push the department as close to perfection as possible. 
Working with reporters is perhaps the. most impor­._..,:-1:""" tant, and most satisfying part 
of this job. I've come to 
realize that news editors are 
here primarily to pass along 
the writing know-how that 
they picked up as reporters. 
Sitting down with reporters 
and reviewing their work af­
fords us the chance to make 
suggestions about one's 
writing style and interview­
ing techniques. It is reward­
ing to watch a reporter's 
progress over the course of 
the semester, and I like to 
think that we've helped in 
that progress. 
Also, many of our repor­
ters have written in the past, 
and from time to time, they 
teach me a few things about newswriting. 
In additon, there is nothing like watching a reporter eagerly tracking down a story. Seeing someone tackle an assignment with enthusiasm and tenacity reminds me of the reason ofThe Obseroer's existence. As it was written in the first issue fifteen years ~go, The Obseroer is here to "observe, remark, notice, comment and ad­here." Through our reporters, we try to live up to those lofty ideals. 
The challenge of improving campus news coverage, as well as the rewards of working with the reporters tend to balance out the late nights, the hours that could have been spent with friends, and the struggle to keep up with classes. When I start to doubt this, I think back to occasions when I am reassured that what we are doing isn't all for naught. From time to time someone will write or remark that "The Obseroer did a good job ofcovering..." At times like that, it's hard not to like this job.

"Discipline, the dcsirt to com­pete, and the willingness to pay the price" were.~ the ingrcdknts neces­sary to succeed, according to Landry, and McCoy said these "apply to about any activity you can think· about." 
Directing his thoughts primarily towards the military, he commented on the return of a respect for dis­cipline after years of n:bdlion in the 60's and ""O's. 
"I'm happy to say that in thcst·

But at least four downstream states are considering lawsuits to block the project, calling it a dan­gerous precedent. 
"Iflarge quanitities of water were removed, it could threaten naviga­tion on the river," Hamon said. "And every gallon of water you remove above the main-stem dams reduces electrical power generation." 
Officials believe other industrial 
projects are waiting to see how the 
ETSI deal fares. 

Two other companies have indi­cated an interest in an additional I 6. 3 billion gallons .of water, while Exxon says 651 billion gallons of Missouri River water could be available in South Dakota for its syn­thetic fuel operations. 
"There are many programs with their eyes on the river," says Roy Downing of the Iowa Conservation Commission staff. "If they're all ap­proved, the river could be dry by the time it gets to Iowa." 
Perhaps the most ambitious project so far is a plan under con­sideration by the interstate High Plains Study Council to siphon off more than 3 trillion gallons of Mis­souri River water to irrigte farmland in Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. 
"That's about what our winter flow is," says Donald Boyd, director 
of the Kansas City Water and Pollu­tion Control Department. "The Mis­souri River could run dry here in Kansas City." 
No federal agency oversees al­location of river water -and the . Reagan administration apparently opposes such regulation. 
Missouri Attorney General John Ashcroft has asked Interior Secretary James Watt to block the 
ETSI deal, but the secretarv is on record as supporting the project. "I think the governor Oanklow) 
pulled off a brilliant and creative suggestion," Watt said Oct. 15 in South Dakota. "I support it 100 per­cent. I think that's the way states ought to do it." 
"As long as there was enough water to go around, there was no at­tempt to allocate it," said Hamon. "But now that one state has said there's enough water to sell and get some benefit from, the sisters state~ are beginning to get serious about dividing the water so they don't lose."

The ickest way to get 




emergency money. 

These days a trip to the college book­store can reduce your available funds to some small change. Luckily, that's about all you need to make the one phone call that can replenish your depleted funds in a couple of hours. Here's what to do: 
1Call home. Report the situation, and tell the folks they can get emergency cash to you fast by phone. 
I.Ask them to call Western Union's toll-free number, 800-325-6000 (in Mis­souri, 800-342-6700), anytime, day.or night. They charge the money and ser­vil'Pi~ to thPir MasterCard* or VISA t card. A Western Union Charge Card Money Order, up to $1,000, will be flashed to the Western Union office or agent nearest your emergency. 
3.Pick up your money-usually within two hours-at the local Western Union office or agent. There are 8,500 nation­ally, except in Alaska. Conveniently, about 900 locations are open 24 hours. It's that easy. 
Be sure to remind your parents about our toll-free number. It's all they need to i back you up at the bookstore. · ~

Soundwaves detect breast cancer 
WEST LAFAYETIE, lnd: (AP) ­High-frequency sound waves used to take pictures of body organs might be ablt: to help doctors detect brt:ast cancer more accurately and without biopsies, according to researchers at Purdue University. 
Professor Avi Kak and graduate students in Purdue's School of Electrical Engineering are trying to improve ultrasound images so breast tumors 1..·an he diagnosed as malignant or benign. 
Ultrasound imaging has an ad­vantagl..' over X-rays because the patient is not exposed to potentially harmful radiation. says Kak. 
Ultrasound imaging doesn't work <lll objects that have hone or air hut the method is well suited to detect­ing breast cancer without surgery, a1..·cording to Kak. 
In ultrasound imaging, the pictures arc taken from sound waves which either bounce otl"an object or pass through the object. Kak is studying images based on sound waves passing through the object, a process which is callcll transmis­sion. The process of sound waves bouncing off objects is called echo imaging. 
Kak says the transmission process is better than echo imaging to distin­guish a malignant tumor from a benign one. 
So far, ultrasonic images based on echos have mostly shown the shape of llifferent tissues in the breast. Al­though a foreign mass can be seen,

in the past." 
Trimarchi replied, "What we are 
saying is that we want to try some­
thing and try it in this way." 
Vice President of Student Af­
fairs,Donna Perreault stated, "I am 
not convinced that you have given 
the present framework a chance. There is a lot of elasticity to work with in that framework." 
Members of the Board of Gover­nanet: will submit any amendments of the current proposal to Julia Trimarchi and further discussion of the proposal will continue next Sun­day. 
Other issues discussed at the meeting were a presentation concerning the athletic program conducted by the Directors, Erin Murphy and Tim Dillon, an an­nouncement for a Board of Gover­nance reception next Sunday, support for next semester's used book sale, and a report by Donna Perreault about the student leader­ship conference that some of the B<iard members attended over Thanksgiving Break.

the information alone makes it hard to tell whether a tumor is malignant or benign. 
Through work supported by the National Institutes of Health, Kak is developing techniques which will give hard data about different tissues in the breast. He uses a model of a female breast that is made up ofgels with properties such as sound con­duction that are similar to real breast tissue. 
Malignant and benign artificial 
tumors are inserted into the anificial 
breast. 

The breast model is suspended in a vat of water. A transmitter placed in the water-gives off high-frequeny sound waves as it moves across the tank. The sound waves, which are picked up by a receiver at the other end of the tank, are changed into elecronic signals. 
In a clinical setting, a woman would lie face down on a bag of water on a breast-scan table. 

Unanimous decision disbands Cambodian Communist party 
BANGKOK, Thailanll (AP) ­Cambodia's communist Khmer Rouge regime, driven from power by Vietnamese troops and Cam­bodian rebels in January 1979, has dissolved its Communist Party, the Khmer Rouge radio announcNJ yes­terday. 
The broadcast said the decision was made "unanimously" at a Central Committee meeting in Sep­tember but the annuncement was delayed until yesterday to gain time to inform party members. 
The Khmer Rouge had been un­der pressure from non-communist countries in Southeast Asia to enter a "loose coalition" with two non-communist Cambodian resistance factions to gain s t upport for a politi­cal settlement and withdrawal ofthe Vietnamese troops. 
Foreign ministers of the Associa­tion ofSoutheast Asian Nations -in­donesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand -are to meet Thursday in Thailand to dis­cuss a joint strategy for supporting a non-communist Cambodian opposi­tion. 
Led by Pol Pot, Khmer Rouge guerrillas ousted an American­backed regime in 1975 and then ruled for almost four years of tur­bulence and death. Soviet-backed Vietnam claims three million Cam­bodians perished under the Khmer Rougt. government. Western es­timates usually put the number at one million or more, with many dying during forced resettlement from cities to rural areas. The na­tion's population was estimated at 8 million when the Khmer Rouge took 
power.

Rodney earns respect at NO 

'Southern Comfort' 

Hill's losing battle 
I
n 1979 Director Walter Hill 
created quite a stir with the 
release ofhis second feature film, 
The Warriors. (Hill directed Hard 
Times in 1975.)Some critics praised 
the tilm for its choreographic treat­
ment ofgang warfare, deeming it a 
ballet ofurban violence. Others lam­
basted The Warriors as excessively 
graphic, a work ofpure physical 
violence withfew moral implica­
tions. Hill's third release, The Long 
Riders served to fuel the con­troversy over whether or not the director possessed any genuine 
talent. This film dealt with the legend ofthe]ames-Youngergangin a style best described as Philip Kauf­man (The Great Northfield Min­nesota Raid) meets Sam Peckinpaugh (The Wild Bunch). Were these the films ofan aspiring artist? Or merely the superfluous in­ventions ofan exploitive film maker? 
Walter Hill's latest effort, South­ern Comfort, makes it eminently clear that he is a fake. This is one of the most unintentionally funny movies ofrecent memory. As in his previous films, Southern Comfort provides a good degree ofsuperfi­cial titillation while lacking im­aginative substance. This time, however, Hill's vacuous direction removes all doubt as to whether he is a serious artist. 
The plot concerns a group of Na­
tional Guardsmen on maneuvers in 
the Louisiana bayou. The "Weekend 
Warriors" lose their bearings and 
unwittingly trespass into Cajun country. To complicate matters the supercilious guardsmen comandeer several Cajun canoes and attempt to ford a river. In the process the audience is tr~ated to a slow motion closeup ofthe squad leader having his brains splattered about the river, the product ofa skilled and ap­parently disgruntled Cajun trapper. The remainder ofthe film involves the platoon's attempt to return to 
civilization. Ofcourse the Cajuns have other ideas: 
The motley guardsmen represent a stereotypical assortment ofred­necks, regular military, and wise guy recruits. These characters come across as one dimensional, cardboard cut-outs; most ofthe dialogue consists of monosyllabic utterances which eventually begin to annoy any member ofthe audience who has made it through kindergarten. Hill might have made an innovative film had he eliminated the dialogue and allowed Andrew Laszlo's camera to convey impres­
. sions to the audience. Indeed, per­haps the only redeeming characteristic ofthe movie is the naturalistic, dullish green scenarios produuced by Laszlo. Yet every time a character speaks one cannot help but think that the next words will resemble those ofan old Monty Pyt­hon skit: "We're on film...." The players seem to be aware ofthe fact that they are appearing in a movie; a sense ofinsincerity permeates several individual performances. Accordiingly the texture ofthe film 
is irreparably damaged. Walter Hill does possess the ability to create adequate concep­
, tual metaphors. Unfortunately that talent is smothered beneath shallow dialogue and unnecessary camera shots. The analogy of U.S. involve­ment in Vietnam is obvioI us, but Hill does not know what to do with the analogy. The ambiguous conclusion ofthe movie serves to highlight the 

Pat Mulligan 
Movies 
director's difficulty. Hill appears -­
afraid to commit himselfto a resolu­tion. It might be argued that in the case ofsuch an analogue a resolution is uncalled for. However Hill's en­ding does not make that point clear; 
one can imagine Hill on the last day 
ofshooting turning to an assistant 
and asking, "So how are we going to 
end this?" 
The wistful contentions of Walter 
Hill enthusiasts fail to justify the in­
ept composition ofSouthern Com­fort. While the camera work sustains the audien t ce's interest throughout a good portion ofthefilm, the flaws in direction provide for numerous comical moments in a supposedly serious film. Walter Hill is not an aspiring artist. He is a two-bit com­mercial filmmaker whose im­aginative pretensions belie artistic shame.

Doctors are as dumb as the next guy 
D
octors should never talk to ordinary people about anything but medicine. Ifl were a doctor, I'd never go to another party where there were anything but other doctors present. 
When doctors talk politics, economics or sports, they reveal themselves to be ordinary mortals, idiots just like the rest ofus. That isn't what any ofus want our doctor to be. We want our doctor to be an intellectual giant who knows all about everything. We don't wanr him to be someone who has a lot ofpetty little theories about what's wrong in Washington or what play the coach should have sent in Sunday when it was third and nine on the 24. 
Saturday night I wa~ talking to a doctor at a party and he was telling me that .the nurses situation is getting desperate. "Young women just don't want to do that kind of hard work anymore," he said. "A lot of the good ones are quitting," he told me, 
~~~~tat~ee t~:: ~i!;e~~~~.?ut Another. thing, he said, was that a lot of nurses resented  mm!~t4&&iwr;.§;;;i(WiWi\,i1,\tt&¥iAndy Rooney  
doctors and often thought  
they knew as much about a  
patient as the doctor did.  
Well, first thing you know  

we were arguing about how little a nurse is paid compared to a doc­tor and how a lot of women ended up as nurses when they should have been doctors and vice versa. I won't teH you which side ofthe arguments I was on but neither of us distinguished ourselves. It was the kind ofconversation that makes me realize doctors are only mor­tal men and it's always a disappointment. I'm looking for a god in my 
doctor. 
Surgeons I meet worry me. When I get talking politics with a sur­geon who has done 150 open-heart operations, I usually wonder how he ever did it without killing the patients. It turns out he's just as dumb as I am. His opinion ofthe Reagan administration is the same as the one I heard last week from the man who runs the shoeshine stand in the station and I certainly wouldn't want the shoeshine man fooling around with my heart valves through an incision in my chest. 
Years ago my wife and I were spending the weekend in the-house­ofan old college friend ofhers whose husband was an orthopedic surgeon. One morning I started out the front door and the knob came loose. It just twisted around in my hand, so the doctor went down to the cellar to get a few tools. The doorknob was obviously on the critical list. 
All I could think, as I watched him attack the problem, was how. happy I was to be a houseguest and not apatient. He fussed with that doorknob for more than halfan hour before he got an ill-fitting set­screw in there to hold it. I'd give that doorknob another three days. Here was a distinguished surgeonwho had replaced the head of200 femurs with stainless steel balls that enabled patients to walk once again free ofpain in their hips, but he couldn't figure out how to fix that one lousy doorknob. What do you make ofthis? 
One problem medical men and women have is one we all share with them. To be really expert in our chosen field takes more than one type ofskill, and a person who as one, doesn't necessarily have others. The young medical student who masters the details of anatomy gets the best marks in his class is not necessarily manually dexterous. The dentist who has the ability ofagood cabinetmaker to put together perfect, tight-fitting parts that will hold together in a person's mouth, was not always -or probably even usually -the dental student who finished at the top ofhis class. 
Adoctor can't help it if he isn't born with dexterous hands, but if he also has a lot ofdumb opinions about the world, the least he can do is keep them to himselfso we don't get wondering about his hands.

H
ere I am in South Bend ­Whoopee, huh?" 
With these words, Rodney Danger 
field began his show at the ACC last 
night. Nearly 3500 people heard this 
comic spokesman of middle-aged 
America tell ofhis troubled life. 
Describing his genealogy, Rodney 
said, "I looked up my family tree and 
found out I was the sap. Aaah, I tell 
ya. I was able to trace my roots back 
by Mike Raab 
to a cesspool." Growing old also worries him. "I went by the cemetery the other day, and two guys with shovelsstarted running af­ter me." 
Much of Dangerfield's material came from his recent "No Respect" album. He dealt with personal sub­jects that most comics avoid, com­
plaining about everything from 
growing old to his sex life to his 
"good looks." 
"Once I stuck my head out the window and got arrested for mooning. Then the other day my doctor told me I was going crazy. I said I wanted a second opinion. He said, 'Alright, you're ugly too."' 
Rodney Dangerfield's real name is Jacob C-ohen. Born Jewish and poor in a Waspy section ofNew York City, he delivered groceries and wrote gags at the age offifteen, and by nineteen was playing the.Catskills at $12 a week. He then landed a job as a singing waiter at a Brooklyn club named the Polish Falcon, where he met another young comedian named Lenny Bruce. They spent their time together at a local drugstore, exchanging material and testing their entertainment wings. 
Dangerfield was still on the road 
playing small clubs when he met 
singerJoyce Indig. They were 
married, and Rodney, worried that 
the long weeks on the road would 
damage the marralge, dropped his 
comedy and took a job selling paint. 
Unfortunately, the marraige fell 
apart, and he raised the children 
himself. 
During the mid-'60s, Rodney put a new act together. His 1967 ap­pearanceon the "Ed Sullivan Show" launched him into a second career, and by 1969 he was a comedy star. Rodney then opened Dangerfield's, a nightclub in Manhattan's East Side, and since then, has sallied forth at his leisure. 
Jacob Cohen has come a long way from those early days in the small taverns, and now really enjoys him­selfon the stage. After his monologue, Dangerfield took ques­tions from the audience and described how he got no respect from his wife's cooking. "How can toast have bones in it?" he ex­claimed. "My wife's cooking is so bad ('How bad is it?' asked the crowd) that all the flies chipped in to buy a new window screen." 
Wcaring a white dressing gown, and appearing happy and relaxed in his dressing room after the show, Rodney said he"...enjoyed the crowd. You have great kids here." When asked what made him attempt a comeback after the years ofselling paint, he said,"I don't know. I just kind ofdecided to do it because I was getting older. Did you know," he said with a grin, "that when I 
retired the first time I was the only 
one that knew?" 
Rodney is out of retirement now 
and judging from the crowd's 
response last night, he's not the only 
one who knows. 
Mike Raab is a sophomorefrom Batavia, Illinois who doesn't get any respect either.

surprised I was playing," McNamara said. "I felt a little shaky at first, but after the first period I felt great." 
Miami's Steve Morris opened up the scoring at 4:51 ofthe first period with a powerplay goal that bounced off Irish defenseman Jim Brown's skate and into the Notre Dame goal. 
After a slow start that saw the Irish go five minutes without a shot on goal, Poulin tied the game on a tip-in of a perfrectly placed pass from linemate Bill Rothstein. But Miami winger Mike Kirwin put his team on top again at 12:12 of the period with a twenty-foot blast past McNamara's glove. 
Notre Dame'sJeffPerry ended the first period scoring at 13:38 by banking a goal line shot off Kodatsky's back to tie the game at 2-2. 
The Irish controlled the second period, outshooting the Redskins 1'5-9, but were unable to keep a lead. Chapman banged in his own rebound during a scramble in front ofthe net to give Notre Dame its first lead at 3:04 ofthe period. 
The Irish continued to put pressure on the Miami goal through­out the first five minutes but could not come up with another tally. 
Mike Norton tied the score for Miami, tipping a shot from defen­seman Kevin Beaton into the top of the net. Less than six minutes later, Miami took the lead for the third time, as Wheeldon capitalized on some shabby Notre Dame defensive play for a goal from close range.

Saint Mary's splits two in Goshen 
By DAVE WILSON 
Sports w·rtter 
Thc Saint Mary's basketball tt·am picked up a victory and a loss at the Goshcn Classic this pa'it weekend, boosting their rccord to 3-2 for thc young season. 
Tht: Belles will face the Irish 
tomorrow night at 7:30 p.m. in 
the ACC. Saint Mary's coachJerry 
Dallessio was asked to comment 
on the upcoming annual cla'ih. 
"Notre Dame has become a 
very big and talented team since 
moving into Division 1," he said. 
"They're good inside and they 
can rebound, so we're going to 
havc to concentrate on cutting 
offthis part of their game. 
"You have to remember that 
we're only Division Ill ourselves. 
We should give them a good 
game, but we can't expect too 
much." 
Friday night the Belles dropped a close contest to powerhouse Franklin, 63-58. Considering that the team was down by eleven points after 20 minutes, and by seventeen early in the second half, the final tally reveals little about the actual game. 
"We just had a lousy first half," 
said Dallessio. "They ran a fast-
paced offense, and we got caught 
up in it. That l·aused turnovers, 
and turnovers ruined our game. 
"I thought our defense was solid all the way, and we did get our act together in the second hal( but by then, we just had too many points to make up." 
Anne Armstrong and Lisa Schirz led the Belles in scoring with I4 points apiece, while Mis­sy Van Ort pulled down I I rebounds and Mary Baykss had 1 I assists. 
Saint Mary's returned on Satur­day' afternoon to destroy Tri­State University 74-49, their second viCtory over this op­ponent this season. This time Van Ort led in scoring with 1 7 points, while Armstrong helped with I 2 points, Schirz with 8 rebounds, and Bayless with 8 assists. Gretchen Meyer returned from the injured list to contribute 9 points. 
"It was a bigger victory than I expected," said Dallessio, "because we lost the night before, and we already beat Tri­State by 30 this season. Our defense was good again, and we were able to slow down our game and thus cut down on our turnovers. I hope we can be this much in control against Notre Dame on Tuesday."

At the Rock 
ND swimmers capture title 
By LOUIE SOMOGYI 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's swimming 
team opened up its 1981-82 season 
in impressive fashion this past 
weekend at the Rockne Memorial 
Pool. 
The Irish opened up by winning 
its own six-team invitational on 
Friday night and followed up with a 
61-41 dual-meet triumph over Ferris 
State on Saturday night. 
After losing some key performers 
from last year's squad. the Irish will 
he hard pressed to match last year's 
9-3 record and third place finish in 
the Midwest Invitational (the team's 
best-ever finish in the Invitational). 
Nevertheless, the return of 14 letter­
men and this weekend's perfor­
mance does provide optimism for 
senior co-captains Don Casey and 
john Gibbons. · 
"Coming into these meets we had 
some unanswered questions about 
this team," says Casey, "And I think 
we answered them positively. It still 
is early to tell how good we can be, 
but I would say that we are in the 
same league of competitiveness and 
talent as last year's team." 
Depth is the key word cited on 
this year's team of 31 swimmers. 
"We have events where there really isn't much seperatiot'l in talent between the first, second or third men in that event," notes Gibbons. "That is going to be a positive factor for us since we can keep pushing each other for better perfor­mances." 
Head Coach Dennis Stark agrees on the depth assesment as he states that the closc competition between team mcmber~ can lead to a very competitivc squad this year. Th~ position that he feels nc.eds morc work t()r now. thuugh, is the dt"pth in thc freestylc sprint~. 
The top position in the sprints is nothing to worry about. however, as the I<)HI reccpit:nt ol the first Ed· ward Krause "l\lalc Athlete of the Year" award at Notre Dame, Mike.: Shepardson, returns for hi~ st·nior campaign. Shepardson picked up from where he left off last year with first place finbhes in both the SO­yard (:22.2) and 100-yard (:49.3) freestyle events on Saturday. 
Other first place finishers for the Irish on Saturday included the 3:46 time posted by the 400-yard medley relay consisting of junior Glenn Battle, senior John Willalllowski, Casey and sophomore:: Al H.uding. The 200-yard freestyle was '·on by Harding with a time of I :46.6 while junior Gary Severyn won ZOO­yard individual medley wit .t time:: of2:02.7. 
Also, junior Louis Bow·rsox's time of2:07.09 in the 200-yanl back­stroke was tops in his event. Junior Paul McGowan· won the meter diving with 257.94 tota· :Joints while freshman teamm;. John Hirschfield took top honLi in 3· meter diving with 207.Y.i total points. 
What stood out in the .nind of Stark the most, however, was Casey's winning time of 1 '>2.26 in the 200-yard butterfly. Not only did it crush his previous best time of 
I:5 7.4 set last year, but as Stark said, "The very fact that he was able to swim below two minutes this early in the season is quite impressive. 
"AI Harding's effort in the 200 is also very pleasing," continued Stark, "The backstroke performances gave me encouragement too since we lost some key people there." 
Led by four first place finishes, the Irish were able to win the Notre Dame Invitational Relays on Friday night. The 94 team points by the Irish were enough to hold offsecond place Wisconsin-Stevens, which !icore~ 87 points. 
Sophomore Tim Jacob, Harding, Severyn and Shepardson took first place in the 400-yard freestyle relay, ... while thl· 400-yard individual med· ley relay winners consisted ofBattle, sophomore Mark Staublin, Casey and Severyn. Shepardson, Gibbons, freshman Tim Bohdan and Battle comprised the winning 200-yard breaststroke team, and Severyn, junior Mike Hilger (who had a fine second place finish Saturday in the 1000-yard freestyle), Jacob and Har­ding won the 800-yard freestyle relay. 
"It is too early to rate this team yet, but I feel that the question marks have been answered to a cer· tain extent," concluded Stark. 
The next meet for the Irish will be tomorrow at Western Michigan. The swimmers will not have another meet after that untilJanuary I 7.
