Notre Dame's alcohol'policy ap­pears to be spreading. 
Father David Tyson, vice presi­dent for student affairs and Father William Beauchamp, executive vice president, told the Board ofTrustees at a meeting held last month that other colleges and universities have expressed an interest in the Notre Dame Alcohol Policy. 
Beauchamp said, "Between 1 5 and 20 schools have inquired about our policy". Adding, "Schools began inquiring last summer before the im­plementation of the Notre Dame policy". 
The University ofCalifornia at Los Angeles requested a copy of the policy to assist in the formulation of a policy for its fraternaties. 
Saint Mary's College of Winona, Minnesota also studied the Notre Dame policy. Phil Shoemaker, vice president for student development

Bitter cold sweeps Indiana and nation 


Speclal to lhe Observer 
It was very, very cold this weekend, and no one who keeps records of such things can remem­ber a more bitter winter storm in Indiana's history. 
A blast of arctic air, dubbed an "Alberta Clipper" by the National Weather Service, unleashed severe cold and high winds which teamed up to cause many discomforts but few major injuries across the state. 
Yesterday's low in South Bend was 21 degrees below zero, re­corded at 9 and 10 a.m. Yesterday's high was 7 below, recorded shortly after midnight and at 10 p.m. last night. 
The wind-chill index yesterday morning was about 70 degrees below zero. The wind-chill index shortly after midnight yesterday was about 55 degrees below zero. 
In Kokomo, Ind., where it hit 26 below zero at 6:30 a.m. yesterday, it was the coldest recorded tempera­ture since records were started in 1892. 
A warming trend is expected this week. Highs today should reach 5 degrees above zero, according to weather serviCe forecaster Tom Ar­nold ofSouth Bend. 
Wind chill temperatures today will be about 30 degrees below zero. 
Low tonight is forecast to be zero, and highs tomorrow should be about 20. "It looks like a gradual moderation of temperature day by day," said Indianapolis forecaster Paul Henderickson. "By the middle of the week, about Wednesday, the highs should be back into the mid­20s."" 

Th~-Alberta Clipper also dumped . I about six inches of snow on Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. But the winds were mostly from the west, 1 causing the worst lake-effect snow to pass over Michigan. ~

"If the winds had been from the 

i
northwest (directly across and down Lake Michigan), we would have been buried," Arnold said. 
There was a 70 percent chance of more snow tonight and tomorrow, but most of the new snow is ex­pected closest to Lake Michigan. 
Even with the wind and cold, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's stu­dents tried desperately not to let the Alberta Clipper cramp their style.

Indiana state Sen. Edward A. Pease is spreading the word among his colleagues: don't dangle a participle and strike "heretofore." Pease has been known to take a red pencil to offending bills, just as he does to compositions by his freshmen students at Indiana State University. The 33-year-old attorney, who is working on a master's degree in English, has become the unofficial gram­marian of the Indiana Senate. He rewrites bills in committee to cor­rect grammatical flaws and occasionally takes the Senate floor to offer amendments that couch bills in clearer terms. Pease said words such as "heretofore" and "hereinafter" -staples of traditional legal writing -should be banished from the legislative vocabulary. "We have a tendency in the Legislature to be verbose. It doesn't need to be that way," said Pease. "It's important in any free society that the electorate understands its own laws. -AP

The nation will be commemorating the birth of an American who never was elected to public office. Other than Martin Luther King Jr., George Washington is the only American recognized by a federal holiday. 
On this sensitive issue, former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker declared that the Senate vote supporting Martin Luther King day was "proof positive that we in­tend to acknowledge and celebrate the nobility of our citizens." 
Baker's.is an ironic epitaph. Obviously Martin Luther KingJr. was not a member of the noble class. In fact, his life was a campaign against the medieval attitudes and laws of the American nobility. In his fights for civil rights and peace and against poverty; however, King ful­filled Webster's first definition of nobility for he both exhibited a magnaminous spirit and commanded moral worth and excellence.

"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere," wrote the civil rights leader from the Bir· mingham jail where he was imprisoned after conduct­ing a rally to desegregate the city's restaurants, hotels and department stores. 
In King's case, as praiseworthy as his cause, was rhe manner in which he fought for it.

Tuition, books, lab fees, college living expenses -all seem to be climbing relentlessly. Well, here's some good news from the Army. Today's Army College Fund is climbing too. You can now accumulate over $25,000 for college, if you qualify. 
What's more, you'll study, learn and become profi­cient in a useful skill. It could be a skill with so wide an application in both military and civilian life that it might help you decide what to take in college. 
If you're determined to go on to college, but you don't know where the money is coming from, pick up an Army College Fund booklet from your local recruiter. It offers several options you'll want to in­ve~tigate. Stop by or call:

Associated Press 
BOSTON · Abortion right~ sup­
porters picketed a Roman Catholic 
archbishop's house and kept vigil at 
clinics for a third day yesterday 
while opponents held rallies and car 
caravans in activities building up to 
the 12th anniversary of the Supreme 
Court's decision Iq:alizing abortion. 
Meanwhile, three men were ar­
rested Saturday in connection with 
eight anti-abortion bombings in the 
Washington, D.C., area in the past 
year. 
At least 24 such attacks have oc­curred since January 1984, and the National Organization for Women sponsored round-the-clock vigils that continued yesterday at ZS fam­ily planning centers and abortion clinics in 18 states to protest the vio­lence. Participants generally re­ported a quiet weekend without incidents. 
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the landmark court ruling. 
In Boston, about 40 pro-choice protesters marched outside the home of Catholic Archbishop Ber­nard Law, who last week offered the support of the Boston Archdiocese ­including medical and financial aid ­to any woman ofany faith who chose to keep her child rather than have an abortion. 
Braving 18-degree temperatures, the demonstrators chanted "Safe, le­gal, on demand -abortion rights across the land" and carried signs that read "Motherhood by choice, not chance." 
Law was not available for com­ment yesterday because he was on his way to Cuba with a delegation of 
U.S. bishops, said his secretary, the Rev. Joseh Scorzello. 
Across town at Boston's Faneuil Hall, about I,000 abortion oppo­nents, including Mayor Raymond Flynn, gathered to hear speakers at the 12th annual Assembly for Life. Outside, pro-choice and anti­abortion groups marched in sepa­rate circles and traded insults. 
More than 90 abortion rights supporters who were keeping vigil for a third day at the Fargo, N.D., Wo­men's Health Organization formed a human chain around the building, remaining outside for 4S minutes as wind chills dropped the tempera­ture to 40 below zero, said Lynn Wil­son, president of Citizens for a Real Choice. 
At the same time, abortion foes drove past the clinic in a "memorial car caravan" several blocks long, led by a hearse carrying a small white coffin. The caravan followed a rally outside the Cass County Court­house, said Susan Richard, president of the LIFE coalition. 
In Washington, federal officials announced Saturday that three men had been arrested in connection with eight bombings of abortion clinics and family planning centers Soviet spy satellites and trawlers sit­ting offshore to monitor the flight. 
NASA reported Saturday that the Defense Department is considering opening up the countdown to reporters when it reaches nine minutes before the intended liftoff, and a decision is expected today. The news media will be permitted to watch the launch from the press site. 
Launch time cannot be precisely calculated just by knowing when the countdown starts, because the count includes "hold" periods ofun­announced length during which the clock is stopped. 
The space shuttle Discovery will be carrying a sophisticated new spy satellite into orbit, sources have re­ported. They say it will be parked in stationary orbit 22,300 miles above the equator south of the Soviet Union. From this high outpost it will electronically eavesdrop on military and diplomatic communications in much of Europe, Asia and Africa. 
Commanding the flight is Navy Capt. Thomas Mattingly, a veteran astronaut who circled the moon on Apollo 16 in 1972 and commanded a shuttle flight iu 1982. The other crew members, all first-time space fliers, are Air Force Lt. Col. Loren Shriver, Marine Lt. Col. james Buchli and Air Force Majs. Ellison Onizuka and Gary Payton. 
The news media will not be able to monitor space-to-ground com­munications during the flight, which has been a practice for years, nor has the length of the mission been dis­closed. Reporters have been told only that they will receive 16 hours notice of Discovery's landing. 
Reporters have been informed by the Pentagon that after the satellite is released it will be boosted to higher orbit by a rocket type making its first flight since a similar stage failed two years ago. That failure, which sent a NASA communications satellite into an improper orbit, was traced to the overheating of a flexible seal in a nozzle steering mechanism. 
NASA also has announced the astronauts will conduct two non­classified experiments. One in­volves the study in weightlessness of diseased blood samples from six people with illnesses such as cancer, diabetes and hypertension. The 
other will see how weightless fluids behave in transit from one tank to another to provide data for satellite refueling missions. 
For NASA the secrecy is a new ex­perience after 24 years of conduct­ing an open information p. licy through 45 man-in-space missions. 
The Defense Dt.·partment will shift most of its shuttle missions starting in about a year to a more se­cure launch base the Air Force is constructing at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif.

25 states celebrate holiiday, but N D observance criticized 
By MIKE MILLEN 
SeniorStaffReporter 
Many hailed the U.S. Senate in its landmark decision to declarla national holiday in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. 
According to the Martin Luther King Center in Atlanta, Georgia, 25 states officially cele­brated the holiday this year. Some ofthe states chose to honor it on the 15th, while others will observe the holiday today. 
According to Notre Dame Assistant Law Li­brarian Granville Cleveland,·honoring King's birthday "is the decent thing for us as Americans to do." He sees the black leader as a man who "brought forth a consciousness of the wrongs being done to human beings. A leader ... who we don't have today, who went above and beyond the call ofduty." 
Cleveland said King deserves a national holiday, more than just statewide recognition. "He went national, and affected people all over the country. Martin Luther King did much more than any other leader in regards to civil rights," he said. 
Although Cleveland praised King, he was unhappy with Notre Dame's recognition of the holiday. 
When asked what he thought ofthe Univer­sity's observance of the holiday, Cleveland replied, "How much did Notre Dame do for Christmas? Just compare the two. What bot­hers me most is that I saw no symbolism of Christmas on the campus. and Notre Dame 
didn't do much for Martin Luther King." 
Cleveland hopes people will spare a mo­
ment to reflect on King. ''I'd like to see the 
students understand he came along at a very 
important time." 

Cleveland said King did much for blacks everywhere, citing the fact that "JesseJackson might not be where he is (today)." 
Chairwoman of the Black Cultural Arts Council Marsha Auls agreed, saying the "holiday was a good idea. King was a citizen without a position (in public office) who was abl,e to raise the consciousness of a nation." She added, "He made the non-white culture know they have a voice." 
Auls was unhappy with the University's par­ticipation in the holiday. "I don't see it (recognition of the event). It's more of a liberal idea, and Notre Dame is conservative." She would like to see "some sort of booth set up, so that students could get some informa­tion (about King)." 
Aul felt national recognition was necessary because "a lot ofstates would just think it was yet another person having to have their birthday celebrated." 
"It's not just a black student issue," she said. "He changed the social attitudes of an entire country." 
Charles Crutchfield, associate professor of law, thought the holiday to be "a good idea." He said, "The man was of such prominence. 
Can you name another Afro-American given a 
fede.ral holiday?" 
"I'm just sorry it took so long to recognize it 
and they (the U.S. Senate) had to have a fight 
aboUtt it." 
Crutchfield was critical of Notre Dame's ef­forts to recognize King, saying "We give lip service, but when it comes down to it, we're not :;incere. You only have to look around. Maybe our intentions are good, although sometimes you preach a lot but don't practice it." 
Crutchfield continued, "The average Notre Dame student doesn;t know too much about the man. A lot ofkids don't really understand .. . Martin Luther King except through history books." 
"I don't know too much about what the books say, but he (King) raised the conscious­ness ofa nation," Crutchfield said. 
Students around campus shared the opinion the day is worthwhile. Junior Dave Thomas said, "It's good to remember the per­sonality that brought about reforms in civil right". It's more important, however, to look at what he did than at the man himself. He has showed us that it is possible for different races to coexist." 
James Franklin, a freshman engineering stu­dent, agreed. "I think he should get a holiday because of what he did for both blacks and whitc:s. I don't feel Notre Dame did much (to commemorate King's birthday), but Notre Dame doesn't do much to celebrate anyone's birthday."

Fruits of King's work canno1t be ignored, says prof 
By CLAIRE KNEUER 
News Staff 
"I was very often the victim of racial dis­crimination," recalled Professor of Sociology Joseph Scott of the days before Martin Luther King Jr. 
Both Scott and Dennis Tillman, a freshman from Flanner, participated in the Black Cul­tural Arts Council's tribute to King onJanuary 17th. 
Scott recalled, "I remember prior to King the South was solidly segregated by law and custom. The North was segregated in housing, restaurants, bars and public places as a matter of the owner's preference. King's efforts mobilized black people to dismantle apar­theid such as in South Africa today. He worked to create more opportunity for advance­ment." 
"It is with great joy that I take my children to Bloomington, Indiana or Georgia as free in­dividuals without suffering the indignities of racism, going freely to restaurants, the Holiday Inn." 
Scott feels that the young blacks oftoday ­
" Would I even be at Notre Dame if it were not for the dedication of King and men like him? " 
the beneficiaries of the civil rights movement of the sixties and seventies -are unaware of how it all happened. 
"Free people have to be vigilant; they are about to lose freedom because they are not aware ofwhat they may lose," he said. 
According to Scott fewer blacks were ac­cepted for addmission this year and there are fewer than ten black professors teaching on the f1culty. Because there are black professors retiring this year there will be evenfewer next 
year. 
"Notre Dame has not been aggressive in recruiting black professors. If the younger ones leave it will return to an all white fac­ulty,'' Scott said. 
Scott explained that University president, Theodore Hesburgh has responded for the last 1ifteen years by saying he's working on the problem. 
Tillman, who wrote a biography of King for the Black Cultural Arts Council's tribute to King When asked how King had influenced his life Tillman responded: "King had a dream which is not yet fulfilled, there is still racism and discrimination in our country." 
Tillman said black Americans his age and younger tend to take civil rights for granted. 
"We were too young to participate. King was assassinated the day before my second birthday." Tillman said the civil rights move­ment has "lost the fighting spirit of the sixties." 
Many of the opportunities available to blacks are because of King, according to Til­lman. "Would I even be at Notre Dame if it were not for the dedication of King and men like him?" 
Tillman described how as a child his mother was run off the road while walking to school because she was black "King's life motivates me to remember what my mother and her parents went through and to remem­ber the price paid; the sacrifices and lives lost." 
Tillman added, "Nothing is free, nothing is given, everything must be worked for. Ifyour are black the work is twice as hard because you often have to prove yourselftwice."

~ time the set was turned on, my family saw no less than five such commercials per hour. Granted, there is growing support for the 
Dave Kroeger the same to you 
movement against drunken driving, but this is ridiculous. One is even tempted to go out and drive drunk just to annoy those who make the commercials. 
~ 
What is more, everyone seems to be jump­ing on the bandwagon. Senators, policemen, grocery store clerks, and my grandmother. Again. this is fine, but why these people and why now? It is all very well and good to be concerned about drunken driving, provided that one has the right intentions. This problem has always existed in our society. There has r always been laws against it. Why should every­one realize now that drunken driving is a ~ problem? Is it just a fad? Is it just a means to r ride public sympathy into an elected office? r 
Sadly, no one has really shown me otherwise. 
r 
Do not misunderstand. In no way, shape or
r 
form am I an advocate ofdrunken driving, but I would like to sec genuine progress rather
~ 
than just stricter laws. It worries me when I sec someone arrested for selling liquor to a minor during a sting operation. Such tactics seem to do little more than create crime, and when police officers are used in connection with the operation it creates a void in the nor­
mallaw enforcement ofthe community. What 
would happen if a bank were being robbed at 
the same time? I also worry about the recent 
court cases in which hosts can be sued for pro­
viding alcohol to their guests. I can just 
picture some housewife spooning gin into the 
unwilling mouth ofher husband's best friend. 
When will we learn from the past? Prohibi­tion failed years ago. Its skeleton will have little more success. Arrests do not change public opinion. They do not shape society. What the anti-drunken driving advocates have created is a reign offear. No one can trust an­otherfor fear ofattack. The entire atmosphere has become a game. Drink. Get drunk. Drive home drunk. Do not get caught. Whoops! Go to jail. Do not pass go. Do not collect 5200. 
If, indeed, the commercials are serious, then they will try to stop this farce. Chlmge the attitude ofsociety by changing the people from within. Teach that it is fine to drink, but that there are other ways ofgetting home than driving drunk. Only then can we achieve a so­lution. 
Is such a solution likely? I wonder, espe­cially in the case of minors. More often than not, parents are aware their children drink but are willing to overlook this as long as the kids are home in bed by morning. I shudder to think what would happen to most people if they called their parents to say that they had too much to drink and were staying over at a friend's home. Why? It is all part ofthe unwrit­ten set of rules we pass from generation to generation, rules we seem to value above life itself. Indeed, in the case of drunken driving, we just may pay that price.

Reasons to remember Martin Luther King 
Trying to ensure equality of treatment for all people in a heterogeneous society is the most difficult task most nation-building ar­chitects have faced. This process is challeng­ing enough to merit its successful practitioners the world's most prestigious award, the Nobel Peace Prize. While peace­making among diverse people is not easy, and while many pacific arrangements have vanished or been lessened in their impact, little can detract from the achievements of 
guest column 
world Otizens such as Mohanaas LJnan<l( Ralphe Bunche, Dag Hammerskjold, Bishop Desmond Tutu, and Martin Luther King Jr. 
It is no accident that both Rev. King and Ghandi have been recipients of this distinc­tion. King publicily credited the teachings of Ghandi as having been very influential upon his American brand of non-violent civil dis­obedience. When Montgomery, Ala. policemen took Rosa Parks from a public bus for refusing to move to the back, King responded with a peaceful bus boycott. After the brutal 1964 murder of three civil rights workers in Mississippi, King asked for addi­tional volunteers for the struggle, and when the city of Birmingham was on the brink of race riots after the bombing ofa black Baptist 
church which took the lives of four young 
black girls attending Sunday school, King per­
suaded the city to pray. 
The campaign at Selma, more than any other event, gave birth to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. By attracting to his movement racial slurs and violence, Americans were forced to recognize just how morally corrupt they could be. But more significantly, by using civil disobedience so effectively at Selma in 1964, King also demonstrated our potential, as a nation, for peaceful change. Brilliantly employing his Ghandian philosophy of non­violence, King presented the American people with portraits of both our worst and best selves. Martin Luther King, Jr. knew us better than ourselves. And despite those battles left unfinished, no one doubts the las­ting impact of a Civil Rights movement that was led by the Atlallta-born son of a school teacher and Baptist minister. 
At a time when peace is so rare a com­modity for so many people in the world, we remember King because he demonstrated, even when faced with the toughest odds, that peaceful change is possible. In the face of sometimes overwhelming evidence to the contrary, we remember King because he found in his religious faith, a weapon more potent than any his enemies could summon to deter him. We remember King because in a nuclear age, we are left with little choice but to believe and to dedicate ourselves to the memory of a man whose life and teaching were so demonstrative of the power oflove.

P.O.BoxQ 
Astounded by Father Hesburgh's position 
Dear Editor: 

During the Civil Rights movement, Father Hesburgh supported only that law which gave all blacks the civil right to vote, but now he would support a law that would give only some unborn babies the civil right to life. Prohibition of abortion during the last three months ofpregnancy would save slightly over 12,000 babies annually, but 1,488,000 would still be killed by abortion. 
We in the pro-life movement who were taught by Father Hesburgh are astounded by his position and theory of relative civil and moral values. The civil right to life for all un­born deserves the support Father Hesburgh gave to civil rights for all blacks. There was no consensus for black rights then and it took vio­lence, federal troops, federal marshalls and federal court injunctions to enforce this un­popular law. It was enforced because it was morally right, not because it was popular.

Belli's intentions in India are repugnant 
Dear Editor: 

It is a shame that many thousands of Indian people had to be the victims ofa major indus­trial accident. We can imagine the agony and grief felt by those affected and we sympathize with them. 
Clearly, the Union Carbide Corporation is at fault here, and must provide compensation to those affected by this unfortunate accident. Yet, is it not more unfortunate that one San Francisco attorney is trying to capitalize on the misfortune of these victims? Why should one American attorney have the right to ap­point himself representative for all of the casualties. What interest, other than profit, does Melvin Belli hold in India or the Indian people? It is clear to us that Belli is merely a glorified ambulance chaser, rushing to the scene of an accident, looking for a lawsuit. Melvin Belli does not belong in India. 
Leave the defense of the Indian people to the Indian attorneys. It is our beliefthat Belli's primary interest is the percentage which he will receive after a settlement has been made. The thought of this sickens us. We can only hope that we an: wrong, and that Melvin Belli docs have a conscience. But until we find out the truth, our prayers are with the Indian people.

Thanks to you, it works ... for me 
Marc Ramirez 
Strange Days Indeed 
E 
very so often it becomes necessary for a person to completely ignore the protests ofhis digniry, and his pride, and his self-esteem, in order to rectify situations which are utterly more important. This is one ofthose times. 
I know what you're going to tell me. You're gonna say, well, sure 
this may be a disastrous situation, but it'll only hurt you in the short 
run, you know. But since my life is a whole series ofshort runs, it often 
is a whole series ofdisasters. 
This isn't just a case of my car breaking down -no, I've already had 
my disaster there. I don't have a car. And it's not something trivial like 
not being able to get into anywhere but the Commons. I mean, I'll be 
21 in less than two weeks, but it won't matter because I have no ID 
whatsoever; no Notre Dame mug shot, no major bank card, no driver's 
license, no Playboy Club member's card, and no International Scrabble 
Players Association identification card. Some cruel, heartless thug ran 
offwith my wallet over Christmas break and I haven't gotten around to 
sniffing him out of the woodwork and thrashing him yet. But that's not 
what's bugging me. 
No, this is different. I need money, and I need it bad. 
I've tried everything. Could MARC RAMIREZ of301 HOWARD 
HALL be the winner ofTEN MILliON DOLLARS? I don't know, but I 
mailed my chance to win to Ed McMahon. Working at the dining hall 
just isn't something a second-semester senior is willing to undertake. 
And there's only so much you can borrow, so now even the Morrissey 
Loan Fund is after me, not to mention Texaco, Sears, the Columbia 
Record and Tape Club, and what few friends I have left. 
Don't ask me how this happened. The phone calls and the credit 
cards and the Christmas gifts just all caught up with me this time. I've 
thought ofpawning my watch or selling my memoirs, but there are no 
takers. 
I called home and asked for a few dollars, but you know how it is 
when you've got seven dogs and a cat and two fish and the Malibu is 
guzzling gas and all that heat is seeping quietly out through the cracks 
under the door. And my rich uncle has yet to introduce himselfto me. 
I thought ofsending out chain letters threatening people with 
violent deaths unless they sent me my needed funds and then sent the 
letters on their way again, but no one takes those seriously, and 
besides, I can't afford the postage. 
And I thought of taking a huge sign to the DePaul game and waving 
it on national TV, but the cameras never focus on the section I sit in, 
and even ifthey did the guys two rows down would always be in the 
way. Not to mention those yellow pom-poms and Tim Kempton's 
arms. 
But I just couldn't bring myself to do any of that stuff. 
However, it's time for me to swallow my pride, and not in the name 
oflove. It's time for the Hail Mary pass. So everybody go out, and I'll 
throw it long, and somebody catch it, and everything'll be all right, 
OK? I'm going to do something that, to my knowledge, has only been 
attempted once before on a major scale. Yes, you guessed it, I'm going 
to imitate my idol and yours,John Z. DeLorean. 
I'm not shy. I'm broke. I need your money, and I need it now. 
Obviously I have been through numerous rough times, and my 
confidence stands on shaky ground. I have fallen from the ranks of the 
mighry, and ifyou've ever fallen from the ranks of the mighty, you 
know how much it hurts. 
I'm not picky. I'll take anything. I will accept any contribution, no 
matter how small. Those ofyou with lots ofcredit cards can loan your 
extra onesto me for short periods oftime. A few dollars, a few cents-I 
don't care. ' 
You're open to ideas, I'm sure, so I took the liberty ofcorning up with a few. Write home and have your relatives send me money. Or the family dog. Be sure to describe me as a wonderful lad who will write every week and is willing to give up his first fathered child as interest. Or look at this as a possible tax ernernption. I offer you the opportunity to offer me, tax-free, millions ofyour hard-earned dollars in the form ofdonations and gifts, which you can then count offon your tax return at the end of the year. 
Checks an: accepted. I especially like the ones with the pretry pictures on them, like wildlife scenes, orDeGrazia paintings, or famous American monuments and national parks~ Ifyou are afraid of sending money through the mail, don't hesistate to come by my room, any hour of the day or night. No sizable donations will be refused. 
Otherwise, send your contributions to me, c/o The Observer, P.O. Box Q, Notre Dame, Indiana, 46556. Or send them to my room, 301 Howard. Or send them to a good friend of mine. Send them anywhere, but justget them to me quick. 
I understand that I'm asking a lot, but nothing is too much when we're all destined to be friends for life. Send your donations beforeJan. 22 and you'll receive your own special copy of these elegant Phoenix Suns 1984-85 schedules that I have scattered about my room. Certain contributors, selected at my discretion, will receive wallet-size glossies of my yearbook picture. 


Thank you all so much. And now that I've worked right through dinner, does anyone have a few bucks I can borrow for some food? 


An antidote to 'Fate of the Earth' 

Amy StepJitan 
Book review 
"Armageddon in Prime Time" 
by George Bailey is the sort 
ofbook Ronald Reagan would love. 
Bailey writes ofthe Arne rican 
media's obsession with bad news, 
depicts Soviet Communism as a 
failed experiment from which the 
nation and its citizens may never 
recover and endorses the Star Wars 
program. 
For those who suffered 
nightmares upon readingJonathan 
Schell's "Fate ofthe Earth," Bailey's 
latest effort could be an effective 
antidote. There are no "what if' 
scenarios in this book, n:~ graphic 
descriptions ofnuclear warfare or 
nuclear weapons. Bailey does not 
intend to scare the reader nor to 
tell what might happen. Instead he 
offers his views on current East­
West relations and how 1:he media 
affects these. 
Some ofBailey's vieW!· border on the absurd. At one point he con­nects the excessive use ofglass in modern architecture to 1:he rise of terrorism. In Chapter 3, he outlines how the the East/West break in the Christian church initiated current confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union. He also unceremoniously crowns Herman Melville as America's greatest au­thor. 
The book is at its best when Bailey addresses directly the role of the media in world relations. In the Soviet Union, he writes, had news is rigorously suppressed and the papers are filled with euphemisms and slogans. Westerners, however, seem to be addicted to b:1d news. Good news doesn't sell, ~:nd the picture Americans see on their evening news often is grimmer than the world it supposedly reflects. 
Although Hailey addre:;ses th.: effect of the press, advertising and propaganda on both the East and the West, he seems to brush off the first half of the book's title-Ar­mageddon. He writes that the "war scare is a Soviet ploy," and doesn't 
How Not to Study for an Orgo Exam 


seem to consider that the nuclear buildup he briefly describes could lead to nuclear holocaust. rle states repeatedly that the coming years will usher in some sort ofworld government, but gives no indica­tion as to how this might come about. 
Bailey is a journalist and the book reads like a series ofloosely col­lected editorials. Each short chapter introduces a new topic. In this 200-page book, Bailey discusses the probability ofa united Europe, the health conditions in the Soviet Union, the secularization ofthe American and Soviet governments 
Bebot 
and the influence ofMelville and 
Dostoevsky on their respective 
nations. 
The reader is deluged by a pot­pourri offacts and opinions, but is given few connections or explana­tions. Both the prose and the ideas tend to be disjointed and repetitive. The reader is left wondering what, if anything, all this means. 
"Armageddon in Prime Time" has much to offer; Bailey's views on both the Western and the Soviet press are sometimes insightful and the picture he paints oflife in the Soviet Union, although somewhat biased, is interesting to a reader not well acquainted with this subject. These bright spots, however, must be filtered from a jumbled mix of fact and opinion.

49er faithful celebrate win in S.F. streets 
Associated Press 

SAN FRANCISCO -Proud and excited 49er fans mobbed the city's streets last night, screaming, honking horns and pointing "number one" fingers skyward after San Francisco handed the Miami Dolphins a 38-16 Super Bowl XIX defeat. 
In the North Beach area just off downtown, a gleeful Mary Jane Gohde announced, "The 49ers were great and this calls for a massive con­sumption of fun and indulgence." Thousands of fans followed her wishes. 
Amidst a hail ofconfetti, celebrant Tom Fitz said the game, where the 49ers won almost everything from the opening coin flip to the last touchdown, brought the whole area together. 
"Here is an example of perfect strangers partying, just getting to­gether and having a good time and celebrating the Super Bowl champi­onship," Fitz said. 
Traffic in the neighborhood was jammed bumper to bumper and convertible tops were down in the cool, foggy night while cruising revelers shouted "We're No. I!" 
Officer Carri Lucas, a spokes­woman for San Francisco police, said most celebrants were peaceful. 
"Everything's fine so far," she said about 30 minutes after the game. 
About 90 minutes after yester­day's game, just five arrests were re­ported.

San Fr~tncisco rolls over Dolphins, 38-16, in lopsided Super Bowl win 
Associated Press 
STANFORD, Calif. -)De Montana, making a shambles of the quarter­back showdown with Dan Marino, shattered the Miami Dolphins' defense with his passing and scram­bling and led the Sa:1. Francisco 49ers to a 38-16 victory in Super Bowl XIX yesterday. 
Montana passed for three touch­downs, ran for another and set Super Bowl records with 331 yards passing and 59 on scrambles. He kept the 49ers totally in control, leading them to scores on five straight possessions in the second and third quarters to make the Dolphins, who had the National Football League's second-best record at 16-2, look like overmatched losers. 
It was the second Sup:r Bowl vic­tory in four years for the 49ers, who finished with an NFL-record 18 vic­tories against one loss. 
Montana was voted the game's most valuable player, matching the award he won in San Francisco's 26­20 victory over Cincinnati in Super Bowl XVI. 
He had exemplary help from Coach Bill Walsh's bag-of-tricks of­fense; from fullback Roger Craig, 
who caught two TD tosses and ran for a record third SCOre, and from a defense whose pressure on Marino 
n exceeded anything a Dolphin op­
~ ponent had been able to do in this : record-breaking season.

1» sacked four times. In two NFL

::l We did what we wanted to do, get­ting the ball inside, and getting the fouls. But where we shot 88 percent from the line last week, we didn't do that this week. We had our shots, but we didn't hit. That was the problem. I think we did a good job defensively." 
Rivers finished with a game-high 21 points, including 9-of-1 0 free throw shooting, and was the major reason Notre Dame was ~.ble to stay close. Tim Kempton added 13 points and seven rebounds, and Ken 

Montana scrambles, passes his way into 'Super' history 
18 games this season and not at all in two playoff games. 
The game was portrayed as a dream contest between the NFL's two best teams, but the 49ers were clearly better. 
And for this day at least, so was Walsh in his "genius" match with Miami's Don Shula. 
In fact, the game was competitive only in the first period. 
. Miami took a 3-0 lead on the first of three field goals by Uwe von Schamann, lost it on a 33-yard TD pass from Montana to reserve run­ning back Carl Monroe, then got it back again on a brilliantly executed six-play, 70-yard drive engineered by Marino. 
But that 10-7 first quarter lead lasted only until Montana got the ball back. By halftime it was 28-16, by midway through the third period 38-16. That was fine with most ofthe 84,059 fans in Stanford Stadium, just 30 miles south of the 49ers' home base at Candlestick Park. 
But there were other heroes besides Montana. 
His offensive line allowed him to be sacked only once and more often than not, he could have been in a rocking chair, looking around for receivers. When there were no receivers open, he simply took off. 
The 49er defense, meanwhile, did what few teams could this season 
Barlow had 12 points and six rebounds, but neither had the kind ofgame that was needed to give the Irish a victory. 
For DePaul, Corbin was stopped in the second half, and finished with 18 points, on 9-of-14 shooting, and six rebounds. The senior forward was named the winner of Notre Dame's Wendall Smith award as the outstanding player of the game. The award is named for the late Chicago sportswriter who died in 1972. 
Dallas Comegys added 12 points, all in the second half, while Kenny Patterson hit five of seven free throws in the second half to finish with 11. Kevin Holmes added 10 
oints and six rebounds for the Blue 
:mons. 

Notre Dame fell to 8-4 with the loss, but the Irish proved to a na­tional television audience that they

against Marino in a season in which he shattered NFL records with 48 touchdown passes and 5,084 yards. 
With few exceptions -once on that first-quarter drive in which the Dolphins operated twice without a huddle to keep San Francisco from running its multiple defenses ­Marino was forced to dump off rather than throw his customary deep patterns to the Marks Brothers, Clayton and Duper. 
Much of the credit went to a sec­
 

ondary that forced Marino out ofhis quick-release rhythm and forced him to hold the ball a second longer as Fred Dean, Dwaine Board and the rest ofthe defense poured in on him. 
For the 49ers, it was also a victory for balanced offense. 
San Franciso picked up 211 yards on the ground, with Wendell Tyler leading the way with 65 yards in 13 carries and Craig adding 58 on 1 5 runs. The Dolphins, meanwhile, could pick up only 25 against a 49er defense that gave up only one touch­down in three playoff games. 
Montana's 59 yards on five rushes broke the record of 3 7 set in Super Bowl XIII by Dallas' Roger Staubach and his 331 yards, on 24-of-35 pass­ing, broke the record of 318 set by Pittsburgh's Terry Bradshaw in Super Bowl XIV. 
Marino finished with 318 yards on 29 of 50. 
A 
can be competitive with a Top 10 team like the Blue Demons. 
"We did some things well today," noted Barlow. "We kept the game close and we had them down at one point. But we didn't do the things we had to do to put them away, then we got ourselves in the awkward situa­tion ofhaving to foul and hoping that they would miss the free throws."

hind by seven at the half( 40-33) and never could get closer than five the rest of the way. 
"Breaking the press -that was the key," explained Bruce. "We told the kids that if we could execute our half-court offense, we'd be in good shape. Detroit doesn't like playing defense for more than 1 0 seconds, and they really got frustrated when we made them." 
Once Notre Dame forced the Titans to play at its tempo, the Irish began to pass the ball inside to take advantage of their superior height. Forward Mary Beth Schueth scored four early points on layups and cen­minutes in the first half, she dominated the boards on both ends of the court, scoring 12 points and pulling down seven rebounds. Her performance boosted the Irish to a 35-24Iead. 
Detroit fought back when Botham sat down, however, and closed the lead to 35-31 with 1:23 left in the half. That was as close a:; the Titans would get. 
Botham picked right up where she left off before she went out, scoring nine more points and pick­ing up seven more rebounds to finish with 21 point:; and 14 rebounds, both career highs. 
"That's the most aggressive she's played all year," said Eruce. "She started out real well this season, then kind of slumped ofi She prob­ably just tried to do too rnany things. But she's been playing better in practice, so it doesn't surprise me that she played so well." 
With Botham making her pres­ence felt so much, and with Bates, Schueth and Trena Keys also scoring in double figures, the Titans never had a chance. Pack, who had picked up three quick fouls in tb e first half, fouled out with only four points and four rebounds. Although Titan guard Regina Pierce led all scorers with 26 points, Detroit never was closer than nine during the final 1 0 minutes ofthe game. 
"This was really a big win for us," said Bruce, who saw the Irish im­prove their record to 8-6 1-0 in the North Star. "Supposedly, they were the preseason pick to win the con­ference, but we beat them by 14 in their own gym. 
"We'll have to build off this game. Now the girls can see what happens when they are patient and control

ter Carrie Bates added three of her own to help the Irish offset some good shooting by the Titans. Detroit was able to move out in front, 12-11, when Cassandra Pack, averaging 1 9 points a game, hit a layup for her third and fourth points of the game. 
It was at this point, though, that the game became all Notre Dame's. When senior guard Laura Dougherty swished a 15-foot jumper with 13:11 remaining in the half, the Irish took the lead for good at 13-12. 
Seconds later, freshman forward Sandy Botham entered the game. A starter during the first several games this year, the 6-2 Botham had moved to the bench as her performance dropped off slightly. Against the Titans, though, she proved that she can contribute to the Notre Dame cause in a big way. In less than 10

Belles fall to 2-9 after 69-51 defeat 
By KELLY PORTOLESE 
Sports Writer 
'Ibe Saint Mary's basketball team lost to fellow NAJA conference member Franklin College Saturday afternoon, 69-S I, at the Angela Ath­letic Facility in the Belles' first home game in almost two months. Saint Mary's' record now stands at .2-9 after a split at the National Catholic BasketbaJJ Tournament in Dubuque, Ia. and a loss to Manchester over the semester break. 
"They just heat us on the boards and had better execution," said Head Coach Marvin Wood after the Franklin contest. "We hope to turn things around and bounce back." 
The Belles stayed with their oppo­nents throughout the first half. Freshman forward Donna Wolf en­tered the line-up I 0 minutes into the game and hit her first three shots while sophomore guard Kris Pan­telleria followed suit with a layup to pull the Belles within a basket -l 5­
13. The score then seesawed before 
Saint Mary's went to the locker room 
with a slim 28-27 halftime edge. 
Early in the second haJf, however, Franklin outscored its hosts, ll-2, and the Belles were forced to play catch-up baJI the rest of the way, never regaining the momentum. 
Wolffinished with 14 points on 7­of-1 0 shooting from the field. Fresh­man guard Tammye Radke paced the Belles with 12 points along with six assists. Pantelleria, senior for­ward Elaine Suess and freshman cen­ter Stephanie Duke added six points apiece to aid in the Belles' cause. Senior center Betsy Ebert led Saint Mary's in the rebounding category with five. 
Last Tuesday the Belles traveled to North Manchester, ln. where ac­cording to Wood, tht: Belles played "a sluggish game." Manchester earned a 64-54 triumph by capitaliz­ing on Saint Mary's' poor free throw shooting coupled with 27 Belle turnovers. 
"They (Manchester) were a lot bigger than we were and they just

Saint Mary's opened up against a Georgian Court team of NewJersey, who finished third in the tourney last year. The Belles played well and cashed in on 14 of 15 free throw at­tempts. But it was not enough as the Georgian Court, which featured an all-American, took advantage of the Belles Jack of height and simply overpowered the Belles on the boards.

Irish indoor track team shows promise in meet 
By NICK SCHRANTZ 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame indoor track team showed great promise in several events, especially the jump­ing events and middle length dashes, but weaknesses in other areas allowed the visiting University of Iowa Hawkeyes to defeat the Irish, 74-57, Saturday at the ACC. 
In the three jumping events (long jump, high jump, and triple jump) the Irish garnered .21 out of30 possi­ble points and captured first place in all of the events. Notre Dame jumpers swept all three places in the triple jump and also took first and third in the long jump. 
Senior co-captain James Patterson won both the long jump and triple jump, as well as demonstrating his versatility by also competing in the high jump and the 60-yard high hurdles. He triple jumped 48 feet, six and three-fourth inches, only a halfinch away from the meet record, and leapt .24 feet, six and three­fourth inches in the long jump. 
The outstanding individual effort of the meet was turned in by junior high jumper Lloyd Constable. Con­stable won the high jump with a leap of 7-.2, which was a new meet, ACC, and Notre Dame record. He won the meet with his jump of6-10, and then proceeded to clear the bar at 7-0 and 7-.2, which broke his own Notre Dame record of7-0 set in 198.2. Con­stable barely failed in his three at­tempts at seven feet, three and one-half inches, which is the NCAA qualifying height. 
Van Pearcy had an excellent day in winning both the 300-and 440­yard dashes. He Jed the field in the 440-yard dash the whole way and won in a time of 48.97. He later captured the 300-yard dash in a time of 31.38, good for seventh place on the all-time Notre Dame list. 
Two other Irish competitors scored in two events. Mitch Van Eyken placed third in the 440-yard 
dash and second in the 300-yard 
dash. Also, Joel Autry finished third 
in both the long jump and the triple 
jump. 
After the meet Irish head coach Joe Piane was disappointed with the loss, but was pleased with several of his performers. 
"James Patterson and Lloyd Con­stable did terrific in the field events, while Van Pearcy had the best per­formance on the track," Pianc said. "Chris Matteo (pole vault), Tony Ragunas ( 60-yard dash), Paul Duvair (880-yard run), Dan Garrett (two­mile run), Mitch Van Eyken, and Dan Shannon ( 600-yard dash) all did nice, respectable jobs for us." 
'Jbe two biggest surprises for the Irish were the performance~ of fn·shmen Duvair and Ragunas. Duvair barely nudgnl ahead of teammate John McNelis to capture second place in the 880-yard run with a time of I :S8.0S. Ragunas sprinted to a time of 6.58 in the 60­yard dash. good enough for second place. 
'Ibe Hawkeyes were strong in the shot put and 60-yard high hurdles (in which they swept all three scoring places), the pole vault, 60­yard dash, and I000-yard run. Iowa also won the 600-yard dash, 800­yard run, two-mile run, and the mile relay. lbe Hawkeyes opened up an early lead and then held on to win by their 17-point margin. 
Gary Kostrubala of Iowa set a meet record by winning the shot put with a toss of 55-I 0. Other fine Haw­keye performances were turned in by Dan Waters, who won the mile run and finished second in the I000­yard run; Ronnie McCoy, who tied for the win in the 60-yard high hurdles, finished second in the long jump, and was on the victorious m_ile relay team; and Pat McGhee, who won the 600-yard dash, took third in the 60-yard high hurdles, and anchored the mile relay team.

At a press conference last Thursday, Irish coach Digger Phelps reasoned that his team would have a legitimate chance ofupsetting lOth­ranked DePaul ifthe score remained in the 60s and 70s, as opposed to the

last meeting between the two teams which finished in the 80s and 90s. As it turned out yesterday, Phelps was right · the Irish had the chance to win; in fact, they had several oppor­tunities to pull out a victory, but things never quite fell into place as DePaul came out on top, 71-66. 
The Irish tried everything, from distributing yellow pompons to the fans, to a pre-game entrance through the student section, to new gold uniforms, but came up short on the scoreboard. 
The Blue Demons, who had lost three straight road games, were struggling coming into yesterday's game but used the ACC as a place to get things started again.

DETROIT · The Notre Dame wo· 

men's basketball team knew exactly 
what it had to do when it took on

vorite Detroit in hostile Calihan Hall 
on Saturday. 
Cut down on the speedy Titans' 
transition baskets. 
Control the boards. 
Avoid a large number of turn­
overs. 
Take advantage of the Detroit 
press. 
Very rarely does a game plan work exactly as it is supposed to, but it does happen every now and then. One of those times was Saturday when the Irish played a near-perfect game to beat Detroit, 76-62, and start out their conference schedule on the right foot. 
"I think this wao; our best overall performance of the year," said Assis­tant Coach Greg Bruce who is in his first year on Mary DiStanislao's staff. "The low number of turnovers, our dominance on the boards, our good field-goal percentage and our tough tt.·am defense · everything really went well." 
It wao; no secret that the Titans were going to try to turn the game into a track meet. Detroit coach Dewayne Jones had built the pro­gram around some smaller, quicker players who took advantage of their speed to force a large number of turnovers. The strategy had worked against the Irish la<;t year in Detroit when the Titans had forced a high­scoring game that saw Detroit beat Notre Dame, 8';-80. 
said DePaul coach Joey Meyer. "The only thing that can build up confi· dence is a big win on the road. It's been a long time since I could smile after a road game. It's hard to win at the ACC, but our guys showed a lot ofpoise." 
DePaul, 12· 3, got the big win they needed at Notre Dame's expense, but it didn't come easy. The Blue Demons put Notre Dame in in a big hole early, going up, 23-10, in the first nine minutes, but the Irish battled back to within two, 33·31, on two Donald Royal free throws with 2:32 left in the half. DePaul led, 37-33, at intermission, on the strength ofTyrone Corbin's 16 first­halfpoints. 
1be Irish kept battling in the second halfand finally took the lead, 48-47, midway through the half on a pair of David Rivers free throws. Rivers hit two more free throws a minute later to put the Irish up by three, but Corbin's !8-footer got DePaul going again. The lead then changed hands three more times before Marty Embry hit a tip-in with six minutes left to put DePaul ahead 
everything they could to help the guys on the court. 
But it didn't work. The Top l 0 team won, and the thinly clad fans were twice as cold on the way home as they had been on the way to the game. The campus was silent but for the crunch of the dry snow ·under­foot. 
So it wasn't one of those big Notre Dame upsets people have heard so much about. It.wasn't one of those unforgettable "Notre Dame Moments."_ But was the game a total disaster? No. 
Sure, the Irish had a good chance to upset the Blue Demons, but the fact is, the better team won yester­day. That fact shouldn't be too hard to swallow. Digger Phelps said he was upset that his team wasn't able to pull off the upset, but he didn't pretend that Notre Dame was the better team. 
 
"DePaul's a very talented team," Phelps poimed out, noting that the Blue Demons performed very well under pressure. "We're just strug­gling to get to where we should be as far as good enough to play in the NCAA tournament, and you're talking about a team (DePaul) that should be in the Final Four." 
Whether or not one agrees with Phelps that DePaul is a Final Four team, it would he hard to argue with his assessment of the Irish. A victory yesterday would have been a great boost for Notre Dame, and it would have improved the team's chances of getting a tournament bid, but the contest was not a "must-win" game for the Irish. Eventually, though, the games will present "must-win" situa­tions. The team will have to get to the point where it is good enough to beat the tough competition if it is to be in the championship tournament. 
So yesterday's loss becomes one of those games that coaches like to call "a learning experience." And the lessons the Irish learned from it are not all bad. lbey learned that they can stay with one of the best teams in the country. They know that they had several opportunities to put the game away, and they know that they worked hard for every chance they had. lbey also know that there still are 16 games left this season, and there will be other chances to beat some good teams. 
Now Digger Phelps and his team have to figure out why they couldn't pull it off yesterday. They have to fig­ure out what they can do differently in future games to come away vic­torious. 'Ibey have to make sure they play up to their potential. 
One thing Phelps always has had a knack for is getting the crowd fired 
· up. He borrowed Gerry Faust's "come-out-in-green-after-warming­up-in-white trick" for the Indiana game, and he gave it a twist yester­day, when the team also had gold uniforms to wear. He had hi!\ players enter the arena through the student section, hoping they might absorb some of the enthusiasm that flooded the ACC. He tried somethin~-t similar 
see IRISH, page 12 
to stay, 'i'i-54. Notre Dame had several opportunities to go back on top, hut couldn't convert. 
Overall, the Irish were hurt by poor free throw shooting in the second half ( I 1 of l 7 from the line), inconsistent field shooting all after· noon ( 40 percent), and lack of rebounding (DePaul had 12 more boards than Notre Dame). 
"I think we had plenty ofopportu­nities to win the game," said Phelps. "Especially when we went up by three. And we had plenty of oppor­tunities when we were behind, but we missed a lot of foul shots. But I think DePaul is a very talented team and did a lot ofgood things that they had to do under pressure. We had spurts to get them but we didn't, es· pecially in the first halfwhen we got back to within four, and also in the second half. I can't be upset with that. The only thing I'm upset with is the missed foul shots and when we had key scoring opportunities and didn't come through. That's some· thing you have to do in big games. 
see DePAUL, page 11 
In Saturday's game, however, the Irish never let the Titans get control of the tempo. They handled Detroit's press easily · so easily, in fact, that Jones finally decided to pull his team back into a zone defense. Unable to get their transi­tion game going, the Titans fell be­
