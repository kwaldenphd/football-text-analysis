Transfers last to get housing 
At times I've felt like Hester Prynne from "The Scarlet Letter." Instead ofa letter "A," I wear an imaginary letter "T" for transfer. 
At this late date in second semester, the awkward ad­justment period is a past concern for those who trans­ferred to Notre Dame last fall. 
Yet there are still many transfers, females in particular, who feel they're being neglected. They're on the long and seemingly hopeless waiting list for on­campus housing.  
They've been on the list since last summer when they received their acceptance letter and immediately called the housing office to assure a spot on the waiting list. 
I was told I should plan on being off campus for first semester. However, chances were good that I could be moved on second semester. 
Notre Dame's policy of guaranteed student housing for freshmen makes temporary O.C. housing routine for transfers. But after awhile, 
the so-called waiting list mester it's obvious there begins to feel like a sucker isn'f enough room. list. However, "We don't decide

year. That's a different tune for the housing office. Last year's melody was a bit more hopeful. 
Anger, frustration and exasperation are common feelings shared by many of the 80 who see the vicious cycle about to begin again. The first available rooms next semester will go to freshmen who have been in temporary housing. 
The next students to be housed will be leave-of­absence students. According to Evelyn Reinebold, director ofstudent residences, this is because these stu­dents are really Notre Dame students who have left for a period of time. 
'!ben come the three-two engineers, students who have been at another school for three years and have come to Notre Dame for two years of intensive engi­neering studies. 
Finally, any rooms that become available will be of­fered to those on the list. 
That's the process. 

Margaret McCabe 
Assistant Accent Editor 
It seems simple but those who were given hope of getting on campus feel cheated, a feeling strengthened by a trip to the Administration Building, home of the run-around. 
I discovered this on a recent visit there. The housing office only told me the facts: my housing number and ­no housing next semester. Further questioning had me packing off to the first floor where I could speak to Pat Leonardo, assistant director ofadmissions. 
I was curious as ~i> why so many females were being

with a bad taste in their mouths. 
Leonardo said, "Transfers should not come to Notre Dame with any expectation of getting on campus." lt seems they should find the other benefits offered worth the sacrifice ofhousing. 
The attitude that transfers are getting what they asked for and are more-or-less on their own just doesn't seem to be a good philosophy for a Catholic university. 
A transfer advisor may be just what the administra­tion needs ro avoid many complaints that the students present. 
It may be that students aren't necessarily unhappy off campus, just tired offeeling like numbers on a list. 
We're tired of feeling like "good business" deals for the University. Our willingness to snatch up beds pro­vides a certain amount of financial security. Maybe some of that security wiJI result in a new girl's dorm. 
Take heart oh weary dormless ones. Try to adopt the philosophy that many under the Golden Dome main­tain when it comes to transfers -you're alive and you attend classes at Notre Dame. Don't ask for much more than that.

Reagan sees nothing wrong with his visit to Nazi cemt~tery 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON President Reagan insisted yesterday there is nothing wrong with his plan to visit a German cemetery where Nazi SS soldiers are buried and said the young men interred there "were vic­tims, just as surely as the victims in the concentration camps." 
The statement touched off an­other outburst ofcriticism ofReagan and his German visit, with one jewish leader calling the comments "morally unconscionable and politi­cally outrageous." 
During an interview with approxi­mately 100 editors and broadcasters at the White House, Reagan said he could not do an about-face and strip the visit from his I 0-day schedule in Europe, asserting that would "look as if I had caved in the face of un­favorable attention." 
"I think that there's nothing wrong with visiting that cemetery where those young men are victims 
-of Nazism also, even though they were fighting in the German uni­form, drafted into service to carry out the hateful wishes of the Nazis," Reagan told the group. "They were victims just as surely as the victims in the concentration camps." 
Reagan announced earlier this week he would add a visit to a con­centration camp or a similar place as a means to quell the controversy and show his wish to honor the victims of the Nazi terror. 
A White House spokesman said Reagan aides Michael Deaver and William Henkel were returningfrom Germany and would meet with the president today to decide whether Reagan will visit Dachau or some other concentration camp site. 
The president said "that there is much to be gained" from the visit, because the German people "live in constant penance, all these who have come along in these later years, for what their predecessors did and for which they're very ashamed." 
Abraham Foxman, the associate national director of the Anti­Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and himself a Holocaust survivor, said, "I am flabbergasted at the con­tinued insensitivity and shocked at the lack of historical perspective." 
Rabbi David Saperstein, the direc­tor of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, said,"For the presi­dent of the United States to equate the soldiers who died in an attempt to subjugate the world to an uncon­scionable ideology, with those who were the tragic victims of the imple­mentation of that ideology, is morally unconscionable and politi­cally outrageou~'­
"It shows that he has learned nothing from the controversy of the past week," said Saperstein_ 
Meanwhile, Elie Wiesel, who was named chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council by Reagan, publicly called on Secretary of State George Shultz to ask the president not to visit the cemetery. 

Electronic billboards flash names in order to find children 
Associated Press 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. Forty electronic billboards began flashing descriptions of missing children along the highways offive states yes­terday in a stepped-up effort to lo­cate the nation's growing number of lost, runaway and abducted youngsters. 
"This has never been done before," said Carol Long, a volunteer for Child Keyppers' International, which organized the project. 
"We don't know how successful it will be, but we think it may boost our efforts to locate more" of the 825,000 youngsters reported mis­sing annually. 
A description of 16-year-old Bobbijo Neeley of Huntsville, Ohio, was the first one shown yesterday on billboards donated in Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois and Ala­bama. Billboards in Florida, Texas, New York and Missouri will be added during the next few months, said joanne Currier, the group's director. 
"The billboards have the potential to reach 150,000 people each day. If we can get just 10 of those looking for a particular car or license plate, we should be able to start sighting more children," Long said. 
"We've already used CB radios to get truckers to help us, but the bil­lboards will get the everyday person involved, too," she said. 
The billboards -plugged into a computer in Owensboro, Ky. -will flash descriptions ofyouths, the kind of vehicle they may be traveling in and possible routes, along with the toll-free numoer of the Missing Children Network in Dayton, Ohio. 
"The key to this program is quick­ness. The information can go on the boards within minutes after police reports are completed and the legal work is finished," she said. 
The billboards were introduced along with a series ofradio messages featuring country music artists warning children and parents how to guard against disappearances. A Nashville-produced album of safety rules put to music also will be dis­tributed for children through the 
U.S. Department ofEducation.

Britislt expel Soviet spies 
Associated Press 
LONDON -Britain yesterday or­
dered a Sovier diplomat and an 
Aeroflot official expelled as spies, 
but said it still hoped to maintain 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 
drive to improve relations with Mos­
cow. 
Given seven days to leave Britain 
were Capt. Oleg Alexandrovich Los, 
44, assistant naval attache since No­
vember 1982, and Vyacheslav 
Anatolyvich Grigorov, 37, a charter 
flight manager for the Soviet state 
airline Aeroflot since May 1982. 
Both are married and have children. 
The Foreign Office said Los, who 
has diplomatic status,"had been 
found to have engaged in activities 
incompatible with his status," while 
Grigorov "engaged in unacceptable 
activities." 
The phraseology is a euphemism 
for espionage. The Foreign Office 
gave no other details ofthe men's ac­
tivities. 
Thatcher's 10 Downing St. office 
made no comment on the expul­
sions. 
Guennadi Shabannikov, Soviet 
embassy press attache, said,"The 
embassy would like to make it ab­
solutely clear that this unwarranted 
action of unfriendly character is 
without any foundation what­
soever."

left to the group using the building. 
Mary Anne O'Donnell, director of student affairs, said there has been an increase in attendance at clubhouse parties. Problems have resulted from uninvited guests trying to gain entrance to the par­ties. 
Caven said some of these in­truders "are underage and some are not. The College is enforcing that policy," and any illegal drink­ing is occurring where it cannot be detected by the staff_ 
She said "No segment ofsociety is protected from alcohol abuse."

"The last thing I want to do is sound bitter," Gioffre said. "If we had lost, does that mean everyone would have written a letter to the paper saying, 'I donated all that money and we didn't win?' 
"No one knows how come Tommy Shaw was picked. I'm sorry that Bruce couldn't come or that Cyndi couldn't come. I don't feel like I should defend myself. The con­cert was never the focal point ofour campaign. When we found out that it was Tommy Shaw, anyone who asked was told." 
Although Gioffre did not partici­pate in the Feb. 28 conference call when Shaw was announced, she said she learned of the selection soon after. 
"The performer for the concert shouldn't be our primary concern," she added. "It wasn't meant to be a secret. Rather, we just said since it hasn't been a focal point of the cam­paign, why start now." 
Chip Rachlin, acquisitions direc­tor for MTV in New York, said, "This is a charity at the beginning and at the end. Perhaps you need to re­evaluate why you were contributing to this charity.'' 
Noyes of MS agreed: "The spirit of the thing is really getting lost here, and I feel really sorry about that." 
On Jan. 3, the campus chairmen met with MTV and MS officials in Chicago. "We made it really clear at that point that it wouldn't be a Springsteen or a Michael Jackson or that sort of thing," Noyes said. "Maybe some of the campus com­mittees got a little overzealous." 
Vandana Bhide, chairwoman of the campaign at the University of Wisconsin, said that at the January conference, MTV's National Market­ing Director Bob Friedman indi­cated the concert might be John Cafferty or the Fi:xx.

derstanding. "I think Tommy Shaw is a big 
name, yes, and so is his band. He's 
not a nobody," said Noyes. "MTV's 
not going to put anyone on the net­
work that's not somebody." 
Shaw embarked on a solo career 
after the 1983 release of Styx's Kil­
roy Was Here album. His first LP, 
Girls With Guns, was released last 
October, and videos from two ofthe 
songs on the album have appeared 
onMTV. 
Yet, McLaughlin of Purdue said 
MS could have made it clearer what 
kind of a group was being consid­
ered. "We were told at day one that 
it would be a hot group, somebody 
popular right now. We were told 
this all along. I hardly believe 
Tommy Shaw is the hottest group at 
this time," he said. 
But Shaw's backers -including his 
agent, his record label and MTV-all 
have faith that Shaw could develop 
into a "hot" act. "We think we will 
all be proven r1ight," said MTV's 
Rachlin, referring to the statement 
in the "MS Examiner" that MTV was 
committed to finding the hottest act 
for 1985. "We think Tommy's career 
will grow and develop, and he'll be 
around for quite a long time. Trust a 
pro. Tommy's a pro. I would like to 
hear from people after the show. It's 
easy to criticize now." 
"I wouldn't say he's in the top five right now. He's certainly well known from his work with Styx," said Stewart Murphy, a spokesman for A&M Records in Atlanta. Murphy said Girls With Guns spent several weeks in Billboard magazine's Top 100 last year, selling more than 200,000 copies. In South Bend, both Camelot and Musicland record stores carry the album. 
In Los Angeles, Shaw's agent Jerry 
Kramer also is high on the guitarist. 
"Tommy really shines on stage. He 
was very interested in doing it from 
the start." 
Kramer said that "approximately 
five or six weeks ago," Rachlin 
reached him at the Denver airport 
and told him about the joint project 
with MTV and MS. "We thought with 
Tommy Shaw being a Midwest rock 
'n' roll band, he would be perfect," 
said Kramer. 
Tommy Shaw's band includes Richie Cannata, saxophone player for Billy Joel; Bryan Stanley, bassist for Bryan Adams; Steve Holly on drums; and Michael Blair on keyboards. 
Rachlin said he used three criteria for chosing the appropriate group: availability, willingness to do a bene­fit concert, and freedom from obligations which would prevent taping the show. MTV intends to air the tape during the Memorial Day weekend. 
The search for a performer began in January, Rachlin said, and several big name groups were ruled out im­mediately because they wouldn't be on tour in April, 
But the performer who responded with the most enthusi­asm was Tommy Shaw. "MTV's opinion on this was that he was the right artist to go with. If you have someone there who doesn't want to be there, it's going to be painfully obvious. It could spoil a very good evening," Rachlin said. 
He said MTV first proposed John Cafferty, but MS officials turned down the proposal because of con­flicts with ano1ther Cafferty film. In February, Columbia Records Video taped a Cafferty concert at the Ritz in New York City and would notal­low another show to be filmed. 
MTV offered to buy the rights to the Columbia show and present it in connection with MS, Rachlin said, but MS officials insisted that the April concert be taped. 
The Fixx also had recently taped a show and could not perform for MS. 
"We were designing a program to give something back to the students. I really don't believe that the stu­dents who participated in all the events did it for the concert," said Noyes of MS, which plans to to ex­pand the second campaign. 
But Steve Smith, chairman at Mic­higan, advises, "If they are going to get 120 schools next fall, they are going to have to get one of the top five acts."

'!be Pine Ridge Reservation is the result ofa tragic history too long to be properly treated here. It can be summed up as subjugation and domination by the newcomers. White men reflected, and continue to reflect, an ignor­ance and lack of respect for the culture and integrity of the American Indian peoples. They were forced off their lands, and white men watched them be divided among others (an affront to their religious beliefs a.'> well as a deprivation). 
Government policy, in administrations as early as President Jefferson's, advocated ex­termination in ca.~es, and this was vigorously pursued against Plains tribes like the Sioux and those ofthe Southwest (at the cost ofover S1,000,000 per dead "Indian"). The remnants were confined to reservations administered by the federal government, despite their sov­ereign status, which is guaranteed and represented in treaties. 
Pine Ridge received recognition a.o; the home of 1960 Olympic I0,000 meter gold medalist Billy Mills and through the activities of the American Indian Movement, most notably a shoot-out with FBI agents at Wounded Knee. (Russell Means, a leader of the movement, spoke on campus last spring.) 
In spite ofsuch intermittent attention, Pine Ridge is a forsaken place which suffers from much more than neglect. The land is visibly inferior to that of farmers off the reservation. Most of it is infested by prairie dogs, which makes raising both crops and cattle impossible. Unemployment is between 85 and 90 percent. On other reservations the rate is much lower but still higher than can be found elsewhere. Those able to find employ­ment work for the tribe or work seasonally on road repair crews for the state. A great num­ber of yol!ths join the military, but most of 
 these return to the reservation after their duty is over. 
Life off the reservation is a difficult adjust­ment for most. After being raised in a removed and familial environment, they are confronted with prejudice and curiosity and must cope with foreign speech, habits and values. They are often unequipped for this challenge be­cause ofinadequate education and because of communication skills poorly suited to the dominant culture's requirements. 
The reservation may be the most com­fortable environment for American Indians, but it is not a healthy one. There is a high rate of alcoholism and substance abuse. Adults drink, and younger people also smoke mari­juana and "huff gas," inhaling ga.o;oline fumes from cars. The suicide rate on reservations is three times the national average, and the rate for accidental deaths is ten times greater than average. 
1t is not a very hopeful environment in which to grow up. There is a lack ofadult lead­ership. The older people are caught between worlds in a way; their old values are not respected by the dominant outside world, whose values they in turn reject. The older people who remember the traditions and the languages are dying off, and those remaining are not passing the knowledge along. The young grow up in a vacuum filled with the despair that comes with unemployment, sub­stance abuse, suicide, accidental death and 
even ..:orruption within the tribal govern­ment. 
In spite of all this, the people I met at Pine Ridge were hard-working; many were very gifted and all displayed the sense of humor that would seem to be essential for dealing with their situations. lbe Oglala Lakota, like other tribes, have made heroic efforts to preserve tradition and to provide hope and the proper training for their people. lbeir suc­cess is commendable, and these efforts con­tinue. While at times it may appear that many tribes like the Oglala Lakota are in danger of dying out, they will continue to preserve their remarkably strong identity a.~ a people. lbey have refused to be defeated in even the worst times. 
As members ofthe dominant society, we all bear responsibility for the treatment the American Indian tribes have received and for their present status. These nations have been subjugated to conditions comparable with many Third World countries. There are exam­ples oftribes which are getting along well, but they are too few. Instead of helping, our soci­ety forgets them, while our government gives them barely enough sovereignty to hang themselves. Remembering these things should cause us all to raise our eyebrows the next time we hear someone point to reserva­tions as examples ofsocialist failure, as former Secretary Watt once did. Their failure is our failure.

Communication contrasts mar Beaux Arts Ball 
While attending the recent Beaux Arts Ball, I began thinking about an unusual topic here at Notre Dame: communication. I was watch­ing communication occur hetween members of the Beaux Arts Ball Committee, who were taking tickets at the door, and members of 
Charles Boudreaux only solitaire 
Notre Dame Security, who were helping with crowd control. To observe actual communication between members of a stu­dent organization and campus authorities came as an unusual, yet welcome shock, espe­cially in light of the poor communication that occurred earlier in the week. 
Several days before the ball, the Beaux Arts Ball Committet· authorized its publicity people to paint sidewalks with various "red" cat<.·hwords in addition to the posters and table tents that were already up. 
This form ofadvertisement was, at the lt-ast, 
in questionable taste; given the "Pangborn" 
red-paint graffiti that occurred during the past 
year, painting the sidewalks showed poor 
judgment on the Committee's part. 
I believe the University's response also demonstrated poor judgment. University Vice President for Resident Life john Goldrick did meet with student representatives of the 
Doonesbury 
American Institute of Architecture Students and did allow the ball to run on schedule, both of which are points to his credit. However, he also refused to let architecture students clean up the paint themselves, although such an of­fer was made. 
I have to wonder if he understood (although he was told) that the paint used was water-soluble tempera paint. lbe situation became even more ironic when one considers that a similar paint job wa.~ done the previous day and the snow's washing it away neces­sitated a re-application. 
Rather than let the students clean it up themselves (a relatively painless and inexpen­sive alternative,) Goldrick deemed it a job for the Maintenance Department who, in turn, called in 20,000-pound water-spraying trucks. 
The spraying, which ran into "hundreds of dollars," is being billed in turn to the Beaux Arts Ball Committee. 
1cannot but help imagine what the ideal se­quence of communication could have been. Ideally, the student~ would have remembered the graffiti incident from last year and called Student Affairs to make sure that this advertis­ing alternative was admissable. Given that such a call did not occur, the administration, on finding the paint offensive, would have contacted the student president of the Ameri­can Institute of Architecture Students and ex­pressed dissatisfaction. The AlAS president would have then contacted the Beaux Arts Ball Committee. who would have told him or

her that the paint was tempera and they would 
take care ofit. 
Such a resolution could have ideally led to a set of guidelines for campus advertising. lbe paint would have been gone by morning, the Beaux Arts Ball would not have taken such a heavy loss, and, rather than appearing as the "big meanie" in the proceedings, the adminis­tration could have quietly resolved the prob­lem. 
As far a.'i matters actllally went, I believe that communication didn't occur. 
1can see no reason for the University's con­tracting with a commercial firm to remove paint that could have been removed by the students responsible for it. 
I cannot understand why the bill should go to a student organization in the first place; it seems to me that the University spent money unnecessarily and pa.~sed the bill to the AlAS, an organization ill-equipped to handle finan­cial burdens to which they never agreed. 
By allowing the Beaux Arts Ball Committee to take care ofthe matter, the lJniversity could have encouraged students to take responsibil­ity upon themselves; instead, it chose to finan­cially handicap the AlAS. 
I contrast the paint problem with the conduct of Notre Dame Security and Beaux Arts Ball Committee members last Friday. Se­curity and the Beaux Arts ticket takers worked together to keep the crowd under control. 
Security members watched side doors, helped to eject gate-crashers, and one officer 
Garry Trudeau 


even tried to open windows to provide a little 
more ventilation. No "incidents" were re­
ported and "Paint the Town Red" seemed to 
go off enjoyably for those who attended. 
In retrospect, I would hope that both the 
administration and the AlAS -and all student 
organizations, for that matter -would learn to 
communicate more openly. 
If the administration does not play the 
"heavy," perhaps students would be more 
willing to think before acting and check with 
the administration if questions arise. If stu­
dents think farther ahead, the administration 
will have less rea.~on to be frustrated. 

lbe Beaux Arts Ball is a valid attempt to pro­vide an alcohol-free social alternative on campus. In order to make the new alcohol policy work, the administration and the stu­dents nted to develop non-judgmental com­munication skills. 
'!be "heroes and villains" spirit must change if the campus is going to be a commu­nity. The object of community, after all, is to make life as plea.~ant and worthwhile as possi­ble for students and administrators alike. I plan to attend the Charity Ball this weekend; with luck, perhaps this fledgling social alterna­tive will not be handicapped by another mis­carriage ofcommunication.

There may even be some Roman Catholics here 
Many times in the past year I have been prompted to respond to individuals who ex­hibit fallacious argumentation and express in­accurate characterizations when raising 
John O'Callaghan guest column 
objections to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church on "contemporary" moral is­sues. 
Unfortunately, each time I begin to compose my response, a very strange phantas­magoria attacks me. My mind becomes befuddled with images of myself on a horse somewhere in Spain. I appear to be charging at, and retreating from, a windmill as I attempt to joust with its ever moving arms. 
The only cure I have found for this unfor­tunate condition has been a cold shower and a casual re-examination of my collection of "The Far Side" comic strips. 
I have of late, however, happened upon an explanation ofmy befuddlement. It is not with these individuals that I should debate, but with my "Many Catholic" Church. This heretofore unknown church seems to consist ofbelievers called "many Catholics" and is or­ganized into basic units or parishes called "some Catholics." It does not seem to be a sep­arate church, but actually a sect of the Roman Catholic Church in America. 
Just as an aside, I will refer in this column to 
the Roman Catholic Church in America. The 
American Catholic Church is a nonexistent 
creature. 

I am at somewhat ofa greater disadvantage· in debating with the teaching authority ofthe "Many Catholic" Church than are its members debating with the teaching authority of the Roman Catholic Church. This unfortunate cir­cumstance arises precisely because the Roman Catholic Church has a teaching au­thority whose appellations are the pope and the Magisterium. 
I, on the other hand, cannot seem to locate the headquarters of the "Many Catholic" Church, nor any "some Catholics" parishes. I have found no explications in encyclical form of the teachings of the "Many Catholic" Church and I have no idea in whom the teach­ing authority of the "Many Catholic" Church is centered. 
Is it possible that its teaching authority is centered upon people known as "many theologians"?! certainly hope not. The at­tempt to find "many theologians" who agree upon any particular interpretation ofCatholic dogma or even upon the distinction between dogma and theology is like the attempt to get certain Domers to take a shower between their athletic excursions and their excursions to the dining hall. 
Is it possible that the teaching authority of the "Many Catholic" Church is centered in any individual with whom I wish to argue? 
Now this is an i'Ilteresting question. For the 
sake ofargument, let us refer to such an indi­
vidual as Arius. (One can find an interesting 
discussion of Arius and the futurist fallacy in 
John Courtney Murray's The Problem of 
God.) Let us also suppose that Christ did not 
say to the apostle Simon: 
"You are Peter and on this rock I will build 
my Church" (Mt. 16:18). Let us suppose in­
stead that he said: 
"We the people ofthe Democratic Catholic Church, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tran­quility, and provide for the common defense, do ordain and establish this constitllltion for the Democratic Catholic Church." 
In addition, let us assume that in the recent 
elections 50 percent of the Roman Catholics 
in America, and 65 percent of those who 
voted, voted Arius into the office of District 
Pope for the United States of America. This 
voter turnout is certainly a good turnout for 
the United States, and 65 percent of the vote 
definitely constitutes a landslide victory. 
There are between 40 and 50 million 
Roman Catholics in the America so Arius can 
lay claim to representing approximately 1.7 to 
2.2 percent of the 750 million Roman Cat­holics worldwide. Even ifhe won 100percent of the vote in an election in which 100 per­cent of Catholics in the United States voted, Arius would still represent only 5.3 to 6.6 per­cent of Roman Catholics worldwide. I invite anyone to check my math for mistakes. 

P.O.BoxQ 
MS victim wants to give a perspective on disease 
DearEditor: 
As a survivor of multiple sclerosis I would like to send my thanks to all of you who worked so hard to raise money for the Na­tional Multiple Sclerosis Society. And, if you will indulge me, I would also like to elaborate on the definition of MS so as to impress on all of you the results ofyour efforts. 
MS is primarily a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. To understand this, picture yellow pac-men nibbling away at the myelinsheaths but leaving the axons in­tact. The broken-down myelin is then removed by scavengers and replaced by astrocytes and it is these cells that form the scarring and sclerosis. The scarring causes de­fective nerve conduction within the central nervous system. 
There it is. A definition so far removed from your world by the very words used to describe the disease. But it is not so far away. If you were born and raised in the northern United States, your chances ofcontracting MS are high, above 40 per l 00,000. The chances are greater if you are female, and the median age ofonset is thirty. 
For seven years before I was thirty, the only doctors I saw were for the purpose of the an­nual physical. I lifted weights and went to my aerobics class faithfully. Then, six months past my thirtieth birthday, I woke to find my legs numb and spastic. I thought they had wiped out polio. Could I have spinal tumor? Why couldn't I walk? 
I regained my walk within four weeks which was followed by another bout, this time more severe. The numbness ascended to the waist and the sensation of passing water was absent. Muscle spasms were so severe I would pray to die if only for some relief. I had no sense ofbalancesince the disease also affected the cerebellum. Fatigue was so great I would sleep an average of 15 hours per day. 
For others affected, visual acuity is wor­sened ifnot lost. Others are incontinent. Some cannot control the shaking whenever there is effort. And some never recover or experience the remission. 
I guess the worst part of having. MS is the slow realization that your body no longer can ~onform to the real nine-to-five world. Poten­tial employers are happy to see us help our­selves but not at their expense. 
What I am trying to say to all ofyou is MS is more than just a good cause. Although the concert will be your immediate reward, the one that will mean the most to me will be the one we have to wait for -a cure. And if the monies you have raised this year produce anything less, don't give up -do it again next year!

Some of different taste pick Shaw over others 
DearEditor: 

And the drum roll please... Hooray! It's not 
Madonna! 

We're talking Tommy Shaw here, granted 
not listed on the pop "top 5," but there are 
many students here whose musical interests 
transcend Billboard's top 40 list. 
We acknowledge that everyone's musical tastes differ, but anyone with undivided loyalty to Madonna and Bruce Springsteen, one who considers Shaw as the guy "whoused to play guitar for Styx," has questionable qualifications for writing such an article as Amy Stephan did. 
Shaw is not mediocre at best, just look at the 
recent success of his first solo album, not to 
mention the outrageous success of such Styx 
albums as Grand Illusion and Pieces of Eight, 
on which Shaw played a major part with sing­
ing, writing and guitar work. 
Shaw is a class act, Thanks MlV! 
Why don't people go see the concert, what 
the heck. it's free, right? You might even like 
it!

Students should unite over ND Credit Union 
DearEditor: 
In a world filled with poverty, sickness and war it is not surprising to find a bourgeois or­ganizational conspiracy dedicated to the oppression of the working class. Yes, once again, those imperialistic enemies of the people, those who control the Notre Dame Credit Union, have duped the masses by a con-
It is thus obvious that if we assume the "Many Catholic" Church consists solely of all the Roman Catholics in the United States, the teaching authority of the "Many Catholic" Church does not account for much of the teaching authority of the Roman Catholic Church. 
It boggles the mind to consider the fact that between 700 and 710 million Roman Cat­holics live outside the borders of the United States. There are Roman Catholics in Europe, Africa, South America, and Central America. There are Roman Catholics in the Far East, the Near East, and the Middle East. And yes its true, there are even Roman Catholics "huddled along our borders for warmth" in the Great White North · Canada! 
There may even be some Roman Catholics in America. This claim is somewhat dubious, however, since there are "many Catholics," myself not included, who maintain that there are "many Episcopalians" but few Roman Cat­holics in the United States. 
In conclusion, my opponents may or may not have been educated in parochial schools, but they need not be so terribly parochial when theysituate the Roman Catholic Church in the present temporal, social, political, and intellectual climate of the United States.

spiracy ofsilence. A conspiracy which strives 
to obscure the essence of the matter, which seeks to conceal the wood from the trees. But, as the English say, facts are stubborn things and cannot be ignored, for the simple truth is that members with a share draft balance ofless than S500 will be paying an exploitative ser­vice charge of S2 per month. 
Apparently the Notre Dame Credit Union thinks that a small notice of a "change" printed on page 2 ofits never-read newsletter is sufficient warning to its members. If you currently have a share draft account at the Notre Dame Credit Union and, like most stu­dents, plan on forgetting about it during the summer --take heed! Unless you've got S500 to leave the Credit Union for June, july, and August, expect to kiss S6 goodbye. As Marx would say, "Students of the world unite! You have nothing to lose but your dividend."

Theatre review 

Where do I go after graduation? What am I doing here? Does any of this really mean anything anyway? 'Ibis weekend St. Ed's hrings such douhts and anxieties to center stage in thdr production of"Moonchildren." 
'Ibe men ofSt. Ed's couldn't have timed their production more: perfectly: as the academic year draws to a close and a wave of confusion and cynicism is creeping across campus, hitting especially hard those who leave this haven of academia for the much dreaded hut seldom spoken of"real world." Moonchildren doesn't offer the audience ready-made answers, hut it does provide valuahle insight along with the comforting reassurance that you are not alone. 
The moonchildren are eight college students, mainly seniors, whom we watch as they prepare to make the plunge into adult life. Their landlord, Mr. Willis (Bill Casey), warns them near the play's close of"how things are out there." llnheknownst to him, the transition has already begun. Reality imposes itselfon the moonchildren in the

forms of war and death. The students also 
have much to lc::arn from their interaction 
with their typically hostile neighhors. 
'Ibe simple set, the kitchen ofa run-down student apartment, complete with a haunting Jim Morrison likeness, 1984 quotes, and a "God is groovy" hanner, transmits the princi· pie values held hy the group. lbe most pressing question is how these values will stand up to the inevitahle challc::nge they await. 
'Ibe VietNam war symholizes the "system" ofvalues this freespirited group abhors. When Boll (Fred Nelson) is drafted, "the system" doesn't even spell his name cor· rectly, and for the remainder of the play he answers only to "Job." Boll feels a strong enough conviction against the war to go demonstrate. He gets sidetracked on the way, however, and tells his girlfriend Kathy (Colleen Cotter) that he plans on trying to pass his physical so he can hecome an en· gineer in the army and then move on to "plastic suburbia." 
Bob's turnabout is an indication ofhow precariously balanced the entire value system of the moonchildren really is. Soon they will be forced to test their values to see ifthey can stay afloat in the real world. It's an all or nothing proposition though, for there'll be no lifeboat. This aspect is especially telling for our generation which is taking its place in a world under the shadow ofa nuclear disaster. 
Moonchildren is not pure drama though. Ughthearted fun is amply provided by the whimsical interplay between Mike (Doug 
Photos by Phil Deeter 
Regan) and Cootie (Joe McGrath). Their sarcastical wit and one-liners build upon each other in a way reminiscent of Hawkeye and B.J. Ruth (Robin McHugh) acts as the perfect referee, sometimes joining in their spoofs, but stepping in at the right time to remind them a jokecan go too far. The friction between Mike, Ruth, and Cootie produces an energy which is delightfully passed on to the audience. 
In all, the play's thought-provoking drama is lightly seasoned with laughs and tempered with with meaning. This delicate mixture combined with the overwhelming relevance which it has for our community makes Washington Hall the place to be this weekend.

Outfielder McGinnis has becoiDe unofficial Belles softball leader 

By KELLY PORTOLESE 
Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
Ifactions speak louder than words then Saint Mary's senior Teresa McGinnis has been very influential in her four-year career on the col­lege's basketball and softb~ll teams. 
"She's a quiet player, yet you feel her presence," says Saint Mary's head softball coach Scott Beisel. "Her personality blends well with the team and she'll always give you 150 percent." 
With seven returning seniors on this year's squad, no captains had been elected, but Beisel and fellow teammate Janine Adamo see McGin­nis as a unique type ofleader. 
"She's the silent leader of the team," says the sophomore catcher. "She gets the job done and shows others by example rather than having to tell them." 
McGinnis is aware of her role and accepts it graciously. 
"I try to work hard and do what Coach wants me to do during games and practices and try to be an exam­ple to younger players. Because I've never been the talkative type of leader I hope others have learned through watching me. I hope I have set a good example," comments the centerfielder. 
And McGinnis has done nothing but that lately. Over the weekend, the veteran merely batted five-for­five in one game, knocking in three RBis while collecting three stolen bases. She also had some fine run­saving defensive plays, often rifling a throw to Adamo to nab the runner tagging up. 
The Lexington, Ky., native is modestly pleased with the way she's been performing lately but is quick to give credit to her fellow teammates. 
"It's the best at the plate I've ever done. I'm just swinging level," says the 21-year old. "Defensively I'm happy with the way I've played. It's always nice to help the team out in a tight spot, but anyone on the team can do it. We've always had a lot of tough defensive players." 
Although there was no softball team for her to participate on at Lex­ington Catholic High School, McGinnis has eleven years ofsoftball experience behind her by playing in competive summer leagues, where she was a leftfielder. 
As a high school basketball player she earned the team's most valuable player award and was named all-city her junior and senior years. 
When it came time to look for col­leges, the biology major could have gone to school only a short distance from her home at the University of Kentucky, but she wanted to go away for college. 
"I wanted to go to a small school where I'd get individual attention. At a big school I thought I'd be lost in the crowd or just a number," reflects McGinnis. "My father and sister went to Notre Dame and I knew Saint Mary's had a good reputation academically. I also wanted the op­portunity to continue to play basket­ball and softball after high school." 
When asked to pick her favorite of the two sports, McGinnis has little trouble deciding. 
"I've played softball for so much longer. I think its more suited to me and I have always had a good time with it," she says. 
Mastering the rigorous schedule of a biology major coupled with playing on two varsity athletic teams is no easy task, but the LeMans resi­dent seems to have handled it rather well. 
"In some ways its made me more organized. A couple of hours a day it gets my mind off all the homework I have to do. I'm glad I've been able to use my time constructively. It has been tough keeping up with all the work, but I've never regretted playing," says McGinnis. "Sports have been a good part of my educa­tion. It's taught me a lot about working with people through good and bad. Sports have always been a part of my life. It's my way of being involved in the school." 
McGinnis has nothing but praise for Beisel, who she says has greatly affected her enjoyment of the game. 
"I think we're very fortunate to have him here at Saint Mary's. He knows a lot about the game and is a great coach. He doesn't put a lot of pressure on us. 
"One of the reasons I've enjoyed softball so much here at Saint Mary's is because of him. I think everyone on the team has a lot of respect for both him and assistant coach Sue Be­cker. It's a lot easier to go out and practice every day when you know they're behind us. We can enjoy practices. I can't say enough about them." 
With graduation just around the corner and a masters degree in biol­ogy or environmental science in the near future, McGinnis has one goal immediately on her mind. 
"My goal is to win the state tourn­ament. We (her six fellow seniors) did it as freshmen and it was a good experience, says the four-year starter. "This would be the perfect way to end four years. I think we definitely have the talent and experi­ence to do it. The spirit on the team is good and the teamwork that you need to be successful is there." 
Last year the Belles finished with a 25-5 record but could manage only one win in the double-elimination eight-team tourney. At present Saint Mary's is on the road to indianapolis once again with a 9-4 record on its side. 
"With last year's tournament in mind it should give us a little more incentive to win this year," predicts McGinnis. "Right now I think we're starting to play the way we're capa­ble of playing and it's coming at a good time. We have a lot of big games coming up,too." 
McGinnis looks for Franklin, the Belles' Sunday opponent to be tough as well as Butler, an NCAA Division I foe and visitor to the Belles' home field late next week. 
"This senior class has been a strong nucleus for our team. It's hard to find seven like that group," con­cludes Beisel. 
Capturing another state crown would be the perfect way for them to bow out and with the "silent leader" guiding the way the Belles' Class of '85 could leave Saint Mary's in the same grand fashion it entered.

ByJOANIE GIBLIN 
Sports Writer 
'Ilte Notre Dame Rugby Club started its home season last Saturday by winning two of three contests from the South Side Irish Club. The A team lost it's match, but the Band C teams came through with victories. 
The strong A squad started off against an older and experienced South Side team. South Side scored first with two penalty kicks. leading oil, 6-0. 'lbe Irish then came back with two successful penalty kicks by fullback Steve Schneider to tie the score, 6-6. 
Although the Asquad fought hard, South Side pushed ahead with an­other penalty kick to win the game. 9-H. 
Notre Dame club president Steve Schneider said he was dissapointed with the outcome of the game. 
"We made quite a few mental mistakes on the field, and had too many penalties, which really hurt us," Schneider said. "'lbere really were some good plays and we shoukl've won the game." 
Fortunately for the club, the Irish

Lately, that boat has been a sinking ship, as the Irish netters have dropped five of their last six deci­sions. It should be noted, though, that most of those losses have come to Big Ten competition, and that conference is certainly tougher than the Midwestern City, which has only three teams with ledgers over the .500 mark. 
'!be experience gained from playing those kinds of teams, along with the fact that the tournament scoring is ba~ed on idividual results should help Notre Dame, according to Fallon. "With the kind ofcompeti­tion we've had this year, the younger players are gaining some valuable experience. Hopefully, that will pay off this weekend." 
There's no doubt the Irish have some fine individual talent, and that could pay offwhen the coaches have their seeding meeting this after­noon. Every Irish player has a good shot at being placed in the top four, while senior Mike Gibbons has a fine chance of being placed in the top two of the number-two singles bracket. The Miami, Fla., native has an impressive l 5-4 mark entering the weekend's action, ranking him right behind Miguel Olvera of Oral Roberts. 

Other Irish players and their rankings in the latest conference standings are joe Nelligan at first singles ( I 0-10, 3 ); Dan Walsh at third singles ( 12-8, 3 ); Dave Obert at fourth singles ( 1 1-9, 3); Tom Grier at fifth singles (9-l0, 4) and Paul Daggs at sixth singles ( 12-8, I). 
In doubles action, the first tandem of Gibbons and Walsh is rated third with an I 1-7 mark, the second duo ofObert and Grier is listed second at 13-7, while Nelligan and Daggs top the third doubles group with a 13-6 mark. 
Position in the conference 
rankings does not necessarily indi­
cate where a player will be seeded, 
since most of the teams in the con­
ference do not face each other 
during the season. 
"I expect that Oral Roberts and 
Oklahoma City will get most of the 
top two seeds, because oftheir com­
petition and the way they have done 
in the past," comments Fallon. "If 
last year's tournament is any indica­
tion, though, the difference between 
the top four players in each division probably won't be that great." 
The Irish will get a nice respite on Sunday, thanks to some reschedul­ing. Notre Dame was scheduled to meet Indiana State on Sunday in Terre Haute, but they will be spared from having to visit that city until May 1. The match with Eastern Mic­higan originally scheduled for May 1 at the Courtney Tennis Center has been bumped to May 2. The starting 
time still will be 3 p.m.

hitting outdoors this spring and, as a consequence, hasn't quite reached his peak. 
So far this season, Nelligan has won the majority of his matches despite losing some very close three-set matches. Since he plays the No. l singles position, Nelligan sees the best the opposition ha~ to offer. 
Despite his success, Nelligan still feels he can get better, 
"I think my first serve has been im­proving lately," he says, "although I haven't played quite as well as I'd like to." 
This intensity is also evident in Nelligan's classwork in the difficult electrical engineering curriculum. His hard work has been rewarded by acceptance into two honary aca­demic fraternities: Eta Kappa Nu for electrical engineering and Tau Beta Pi for general engineering. 
Another aspect of Nelligan's per­formance this year has been his lead­ership role. Only Nelligan and senior Mike Gibbons are returning letter­winners. A$ a result, this year's squad is.very young and inexperienced. 
"Joe ha-; done a great job encour­

aging the younger players this year," comments Fallon. "He sets a good example and the other players try to mold themselves after him." 
Nelligan says he sees his role as captain in a slightly different light. 
"The most important thing is for the team to win," he claims. "I try not to let the younger players get down if they lose a singles match. I encourage them to go out and play their best in doubles." 

B squad did not meet with the same fate. Fullback Tom Reidy set the Irish on their way with a penalty kick, leading off 3-0. 
South Side then scored a try. but failed to make the conversion, put­ting the score at 4-3. Notre Dame's serum halfJamie Cantorna, who had a great day on the tleld, attacked then with another try for the Irish. A Reidy conversion put Notre Dame ahead. 7-4. 
Although South Side scored again, making the score 8-7, it couldn't outdo the feisty Irish team. Center Mark Weingartner finished off the game for the B squad with a try, giving the Irish the victory, 13-10. 
In the last match of the day, Notre Dame's C squad beat an unsuspect­ing South Side team, 18-I4. Marty Burke, wing, gave the Irish their first points of the game with a try, fol­lowed by a beautiful conversion by fullback Kevin Whelan. 
Notre Dame was ahead then, 6-0, when South Side scored with a try for four points, but missed the con­version. Whelan made a penalty kick, giving the Irish a score of9-6. 
South Side didn't give up yet, though, and put six more points on the board. With the score at I 0-9, South Side leading, Whelan brought the team back with a penalty kick, for a score of 12-I 0. 
South Side made a try to go ahead of the Irish, I4-l 0. Wing forward Frank Hardart put South Side out of the game, then, scoring a try. Whelan ended the game with a con­version, to give the Irish the I8-14 win. 
"As far as the B and C squads are concerned, we were really pleased with Saturday's matches," Scheniedeer said. "'!be whole team, though, played extremely well against such an experienced men's club. 
"We have quite a few new players, and certainly will benefit from having played such a strong op­ponent. Everyone played well and we're looking forward to a great season." 
The Irish A, B, and C teams, respectively, will take on the Battle Creek Rugby Club tomorrow begin­ning at I p.m. on Stepan Field. 
As it stands now, the Irish are l S­1I and heading into the Midwestern City Conference Tournament in St. Louis. Last year the Irish finished third behind Oral Roberts and Okla­homa City with Evansville finishing fourth. The Irish already have beaten Evansville in the fall season and played very tough against Oral Roberts. Oklahoma City also has lost some key players. 
"Hopefully, we can win the tourn­ament this year," Nelligan says. "I think we should at least improve over last year's performance." 
Individually, Nelligan says he 
thinks he has a good chance of win­ning the singles title based on past performance against some ofthe key players. 
After the conference tournament, the Irish have eight matches remain­ing. A key element in a seventh­straight 20-win season for Fallon's Irish squad will be the play of Nel­ligan. 
"Joe's match against Northwes­tern (last Tuesday) was his best of the sea<>on," Fallon says. "Hopefully, that match will push Joe to his peak and the team over the 20-win plateau."

HOW TO MEET WOMEN. 
You better learn this now: once you get out of college, it's gonna be harder to meet women. Here are a few places to try. How about the Art Museum? Wait, who are you trying to kid'? You don't know anything about art. And once she found out, she'll laugh in your face. The health club'? Nah, all you know how to do is sweat. And once she sees you in gym clothes, she'lllaugh at the rest of you. There's always the laundromat. But asking someone's advice on bleach is hardly a prelude to romance. You could try the old "get fixed up with the daughter of a friend of your mother" routine. But. since your mother is going to get ~-full report of the evening, how much fun are you going to have? And worse yet, if you brought her to meet your mother, and your mother liked her ... well, then. you'd real(v have problems. 
Little Caesars feels you shouldn't have to sertle these problems on an empty stomach. Here's a great chance to try out a "How 'bout sharing a pizza with me'?'' routine.

NCAA enforcement staff decides to 'get tough' on big rule-breakers 
Associated Press 
KANSAS CllY, Mo. · Schools could be forced to give up football or basketball for two years and the NCAA enforcement staff would gain far-reaching powers under a revolu· tionary series ofget-tough. measures approved Wednesday by the NCAA council. 
"We're instituting the athletic equivalent of the death penalty," said one observer who spoke on condition he not be identified. 
The proposals were drawn up by the newly created NCAA Presiden· tial Commission and will be put to a vote ofall NCAA schools at a special convention June 20-21 in New Or· leans. If adopted, most will go into effect at once. 
Jack Davis, president of1the NCAA, said in an interview that l:ite expects the measures to be be adopted. Each will require a roll call vote · meaning that every school's vote will be a matter ofpublic r~cord. 
Bill Hunt, head of the NCAA en· forcement department, said they are the most extraordinary steps taken in the war to clean up college ath· letics that he has seen since he joined the association in 1972. 
Essentially, the proposals will divide the NCAA rules into major and secondary infractions. 
Major violations, said Hunt, are those that show a repeated pattern of willful wrong-doing and give a school a clear competitive advan· tage. Secondary violations will be defined as things that are isolated or technical in nature and provide a limited advantage. 
In the past, secondary type viola­tions have usually resulted in a private reprimand or a public proba­tion without sanctions, said Hunt. But ifapproved in June, these sort of infractions could result in the permament ineligibility of athletes; forfeiture of games; prohibition of the head coach or other staff mem· bers from off-campus recruiting for one year; a 20-percent reduction in the number of scholarships the school can offer in the affected sport, and a fine ranging from $500 to 55,000. 
All penalties for secondary viola­tions would be at the discretion of the assistant executive director for enforcement, which since 1978 has been Hunt. Any decision by Hunt could be appealed to the NCAA In· fraotions Committee, which in the past has decided punishment in all cases. 
The minimum penalty for major violations would include all of the following: 
A 
two-year probationary period. 

The 
elimination ofall expense-paid recruiting visits to the school for one year. 

Requiring 
all coaching staff mem­bers in the affected sport to forego off-campus recruiting for one year. 


Requiring that all staff members who knowingly engage in or condone major violations be subject either to termination or suspension 


without pay for at least one year, or to be reassigned within the univer· sity to a position that does not bring him into contact with student· athletes for at least one year. 
One year of sanctions against postseason competition and televi· sion appearances. 
The so-called "gas chamber" penalties will come into play, said Davis, for "repeat violators" · when any major violation is fmmd within a five-year period following the start­ing date ofa major penalty. The min· imum penalties for repeat major violators would be: 
Prohibiting 
some or all "outside" competition in the spor1t involved in the latest major violation for one or two seasons and the prohibition of all coaching staff members in that sport from any coaching·activity for two years. An NCAA sttaff member said "outside" competition would include all competition above the intra-mural level. "They would not even be able to schedule NAIA schools," he said. 

Prohibiting 
the school from giving out any scholarships and prohibiting the coaching staff from any recruit· ing activity for two years. 

Requiring 
that the so:hool's staff members resign any position on any NCAA committee, including the Council or the Presidential Commis­sion. 

Forcing 
the school to relinquish its voting privileges in the NCAA for four years. 



Tulane University drops basket.ball in wake of point-shaving scandal

NEW ORLEANS · Tulane Univer· sity's board of administrators voted unanimously yesterday to end the 72-year old basketball program that this year caused the school itS worst embarrassment ever over charges involving fixed games, drugs and illegal payments to players.

Pro hockey playoff action heats up 
Associated Press 
The Quebec Nordiques surprised the Montreal Canadiens, 2-1 , in overtime on Mark Kumpel's goal in the opener of the Adams Division final in National Hockey League playoff action last night. 
Kumpel took a pass from Michel Goulet and snapped a shot from the right-wing boards which eluded goaltender Steve Penney at 12:23 of OT. 
"I was trying to stay wide ·on the play, Michel got me the puck and I got rid of it quickly," said Kumpel, the only American with the Nor· diques. "I knew the defenseman was coming up on me, so I just shot, looked up and it was in." 
Brent Ashton had given Quebec a 1·0 lead at 9:38 of the first period when he slapped a shot through Pen· ney's legs from just inside the Montreal blue line. Penney looked weak on that shot. 
Montreal during the regular season, three points behind the Canadiens. But Quebec was 1·6·1 against its archrival during the campaign. 
At Philadelphia, Rick Tocchet had a goal and an assist, Brian Propp set up a pair of goals and the Flyers blanked the New York Islanders, 3·0 as goalie Pelle Lindbergh registered 22 saves. It was the second time this month that Lindbergh has shut out the Islanders, who advanced to the Patrick Division final by rallying from a two-game deficit to win the last three against Washington in the opening round. 
"It probably was one of the best games for our defense," said lindbergh."It is nice to have the shutout but winning was most im· portant tonight. Mostly the team played well." 
The Flyers took a 1-0 lead at 4:10 of the second period when Propp stole the puck from defenseman Paul Boutilier and sent a backhand handed home the rebound to make it 2-0 for his sixth playoff goal. Ron Sutter's backhander lau: in the final period, on a setup by Tocchet, finished the scoring. 
In Chicago, the Black Hawks raced to a 3·0 lead, then saw the North Stars score six S[raight goals and coast to an 8-5 upset. Minnesota, which had a poor regular season and was fourth in the Norris Division, wound up 21 points behind second­place Chicago. But the North Stars swept first-place St. Louis in the opening round and surprised the Hawks with a four-goal second per­iod. 
Brian Bellows had a goal and two assists for his first points of the playoffs and Tony McKegney scored twice · once into an empty net with five seconds remaining.

New Rolfs Natatorium approaches completion after one year of work 
By MARC RAMIREZ 
Sports Writer 
Its stainless steel drainage troughs arrived just last week. 
Workers are busily painting its sides with a leakage-preventing sub­stance. 
And with the advent of warm spring weather. the project should be completed, according to ACC Manager of Operations Bob Loeffler, by late September. 
By the time it is done, the llniver­sity's Olympic-sized Rolfs Natatorium. slowly rising from the dust behind the northeast corner of the ACC, will feature an eight-lane, SO-meter pool, provide a tremen­dous boost for Coach Dennis Stark's 
swimming program, and alleviate some of the scheduling headaches suffered by Non-Varsity Athletics. 
"It will certainly mean a lot to the program," said Stark. "It will give us more water time for practice, give us more tlexibility. And hopefully it will entice other swimmers to come to Notre Dame who might not have considered it because we didn't have such a facility." 
NVA Director Dr. Tom Kelly is pleased with the project also. "It's a great plus for us," he said. "It in­creases the number ofthings we can do. We're very excited about it." 
As both programs stood before, they were a hassle, with only the Rockne Memorial pool to utilize. Stark's practice times had to be split three ways, between the men's and women's swim teams and divers. NVAwas forced to limit the number ofprograms it could offer in terms of both size and time, and many, such as co-ree water polo, had to be worked in wherever they would fit, often at inconvenient times. Trying to juggle these programs, in addition to swim classes and time set aside for student recreation, in the com­paratively small body ofwater in the Rock was no easy task. 

"!be natatorium will iron things out considerably. Along with pro­viding carpeted seating space for 400 spectators, it will feature movable bulkheads which can be used to divide the pool three ways. Two competition-size diving boards, as well as several smaller platforms, will be situated at the north end of the pool, where it reaches a depth of 16 feet. "This gives us more tlexibility," said Stark. "With the expanded facility, both the men and women, as well as the divers, can practice at the same time." 
Stark added that it is probable that Notre Dame will host the confer· ence championships in two seasons, after the rough edges inherent in a new facility have been evened out. 
Following preliminary studies of what other schools have done, Kelly anticipates growth in the number of recreational and service programs which the NVA will offer, such as scuba and small-craft safety courses. "There has also been some interest in sychronized swimming and wo­men's water polo," Kelly said. "But we're still in the planning stages. I've even talked to experts in aquatics about offering a program in hydroaerobics." 
For now, the building still is a skeleton of itself. Loose boards, wires and tools lie scattered everywhere. The roof is suspended from high-rising beams, and a person standing at the dirt-floored deep end of the pool can see concrete walls and the beginning of a storage area to the north; Courtney Tennis Cen· ter to the east; the shallow end and an instruction area to the south; un­derwater viewing windows, and the elevated spectator area, which will be reached via a spiral staircase at ACC Gate S, to the west. 
When the walls are finally leak­proof, a monumental tiling job begins, and in go the windows and lights, and then the pool is ready for the big test· the water. 
The project, which began in mid· April of 1984, is being overseen by Don Dedrick, physical plant manager. 
Chris Bona quitely helps out Irish; fellow golfers share his confidence 
ByJOHN COYLE 
Sports Writer 
Chris Bona is not exactly a household name around campus, but he is having one of the most suc­cessful seasons that any Notre Dame athlete has had this year. The tall blond-haired sophomore is quietly helping the Notre Dame golfteam to a winning season. 
Bona is a resident of Western Springs, lll., and is a finance major in the business school. He also is the second youngest of seven children and has been playing golf since the age of ten. Since he was a member of a family of golfers, it was inevitable that he too would be on the course at an early age. 
"My dad has played since he was a kid. My four older brothers just kind ofdragged me out there one day and threw me on the course," he says. 
A partial scholarship athlete, Bona is one of several players that Irish head coach Noel O'Brien is depend­ing on, ifthe Irish are to do well this spring. 
It isn't easy for the Irish to get ready for the spring season. They don't have the luxury of playing outside during the winter. The most 
NBA playoffs 
practice the Notre Dame golfers can get is hitting balls at the ACC. A trip to Florida during spring break gave them an opportunity to work out the winter cobwebs in preparation for a very difficult spring season. 
The Irish have had two dual meets here at Notre Dame and also played in a tournament at Purdue so far this young season. They have played a lot the last four weeks and should now be on top of their games. 
Bona said he believes that he has no one single strong point in his game. He possesses an overall confi­dence in his physical game but feels that he must spend equal practice time on every facet ofhis game. 
If there is a weak point in his play, it could be the mental aspect of the sport. Golfis a game that requires in­tense concentration and constant composure. Bona feels that one has to have a solid mental game ifone is to become an outstanding player. Golfcourse management is the most important thing that Bona has learned since he began playing col­legiate golf. 
"Once you progress in competive golf, you learn to work on the mental facet ofgolf. Since last year, I learned not to make matters worse when not playing well," explains Bona. 
A two handicap, Bona averages between 72 and 82 for an 18-hole round of golf. He is certainly dedi· cated to improving his golf game. During the summer, he plays six days a week, and throughout the year he is constantly looking for tips that might better his play. 
The Notre Dame golf team is par­ticipating in a four-day tournament this weekend in Northern Illinois. The 54-hole meet began yesterday with a practice round. The Irish will be competing against schools from the Big Ten, the Mid-American Con­ference and also some midwestern independents. 
In the past few years, the Irish have finished near 20th in 24-team competitions. This year, however, they have improved, moving into the top half, finishing near seventh or eighth. 
Bona said he believes that the Irish golfers are confident as a team and know they can do well. However, there are no seniors on the team, which still is relatively in­experienced. The Irish will need the experience Bona can provide ifthey are to do well this weekend.

breaks we get, and there probably won't be too many. 
"But we've had a real good, hard week of practices, and I think we're ready for Denison.'' 
The Irish are going to have to be ready ifthey are going to repeat last year's 1I-10 win over Denison that provided them with the boost they needed to take the conference title. In that game, which was played on Cartier Field, goalie Rob Simpson stopped 21 Big Red shots and attack­man Bob Trocchi had three goals and three assists. The win avenged an I 1-1 0 loss suffered the previous year on Denison's home field. 
Simpson and Trocchi are going to be important figures in tomorrow's game as well, but O'Leary also is going to be concerned with the play of freshman Tom Lanahan, who will be filling Grote's spot in the lineup, and attackmenJim Shields and Kevin Rooney, who will be trying to make up for the probable absence of McLachlan. 
No matter who is in the lineup, Notre Dame is going to have its hands full with Denison. The Big Red were 6-4 overall entering a game with Ohio State earlier this week in which they were heavily favored. 
Like the Irish, Denison has lost games only to teams from the East. However, the Big Red were able to come away with an 11-9 victory over Long Island's Stony Brook, a team which beat Notre Dame, 13­12, in double overtime. The only other common opponent is Lake Forest, which lost to Denison, I 5-6, and to the Irish, 9-2. 
"From what understand, Denison keeps playing better each week," says O'Leary, who is very lim­ited in how much he can scout an opponent. "They lost their high scorer from last year, but they've got a lot of young people who seem to be doing real well." 
Fortunately for Notre Dame, it, too, has been playing better of late. The offense that was sputtering ear­lier in the season has scored 49 goals in the last three games and has been especially effective against the weaker midwestern teams. 
Denison, however, is not one of those weak MLA teams. The Big Red, before last year, had dominated the 
MLA,  once  winning  the  title  by  
beating  Notre  Dame  in  the  MLA  
championship game.  

Now that there is no champion­ship game (the champion is picked by a panel ofjudges who look mainly at the teams' MLA win-loss records), there is no second chance for tomor­row's loser. Both teams have yet to play undefeated Ohio Wesleyan, currently No. 3 in the nation in Divi­sion III, so the loser will most likely find itself in a very big hole.

A Big Task 

Irish tennis team hopes to halt losing skid at SLU 
By CHUCK FREEBY 
!.ports Wri tt>r 

Winning isn't something the Notre Dame tennis team has been doing a lot oflately, but Irish coach Tom Fallon says he feels the time has come to turn that around. This weekend would be a great time to get back on the winning track, as Notre Dame heads to the Gateway City, St. Louis, Mo., for the sixth-annual Midwestern City Conference tennis champion~>hips today and tomorrow on the campus of St. Louis t:nivcrsity. 
However, the task ahead of the Irish looms as big as the Gateway Arch. as the Irish must knock off some powerful competition to bring home tht"ir first league crown. and Fallon knows this better than anyone. 
""Ibe favorites have co be Oral Roberts and Oklahoma City," notes the Irish mentor. who saw his squad tinish third to these two teams in la~t year's tourney at the Courtney Tennis Center. ..-Ibose two teams have won the title every year. so until somebody beats them, you have to keep putting them at the top. 
Nevertheless, Fallon believes his team ha~ a chance if it gets a few breaks. "We can be very competitive, and ifwe can get some upsets, we'll be in the running. Evansville is another team to watch, because they arc always in the top four, and so they're in the same boat we arc."

Joe Nelligan produces in high-pressure position 
By MIKE CARNEY 
Sports Writer 

As the weather takes a turn for the better and the season changes 
to spring, many a thought turns to baseball. getting a nice suntan and 
summer vacation. It also is a time for tennis, and hard-working Irish 
captain Joe Nelligan is well on his way to completing another suc­
cessful sea~on. 

'Ibe junior from La Grange Park, III., ha~ been playing the No. I or 
No. 2 spot for the Irish since arriving here as a freshman. One would 
think this would put a lot ofpressure on Nelligan to perform. and he 
ha~ responded successfully with a 37-28 cumulative singles record 
and an impressive 28-fl doubles record. 

Nelligan's success can be attributed to two major fuctors: his 
punishing serve and volley game and his intensity on the court. Irish 
coach Tom Fallon calls Nelligan "a good all around player with a lot 
ofexperience and maturity." 

Fallon goes on to say that the best part ofNelligan's game is his big 
first serve and excellent net play. llnfortunately, the weather has 
been an intervening factor this year and Nelligan hasn't gotten in as 
much practice ao; he'd like. 

"Joe's game depends on very precise shots which require a lot of practice," Fallon says. "He just hasn't been able to get in enough see NELLIGAN, page 14

Byrne's By-Products upsets Still Virtually Unknown by 9 
By BRIAN McCARTHY 
Sports Writer 
For the second day in a row a seeded team was forced to make an early exit from Bookstore XIV com­petition as Still Virtually Unknown was upset by Byrne's By-Products, 21-12. Still Virtually Unknown reached the final 32 lao;t year but fell victim to poor shooting yesterday, hitting only 12-of-40 from the field. 
The By-Products jumped out to a 7-3 lead to put their larger oppo­nents in a hole early. In the second half, the winners utilized sharp passes to get open shots and ag­gressive defense to cause several turnovers. AI Martin, John Murillo and Mike O'Grady contributed to Byrne's By-Products' balanced scoring. 
A large and vocal crowd turned out to see Tofu Vegetables I down Two Ionic, Two Doric and One Corinthian by a score of 21-18. Tofu Vegetables, a team made of five in­tense freshmen, offset Barry Spen-
Notre Dame lacrosse team heads to big conference game at Denison 
By MIKE SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame lacrosse team, 
which has had little trouble winning 
its first four games against Midwest 
opponents, faces a very important 
game tomorrow when it travels to 
Granville, Ohio to take on a tough 
Denison team. 
Although five games remain on the Irish schedule, the matchup against the Big Red is a crucial game for both teams as they, as well as Ohio Wesleyan, compete for the dis­tinction of being the best lacrosse team in the Midwest. Notre Dame currently is right in the thick of the 
Mike Stock builds up his tight ends and receivers 
By TRISH SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
Take the task of replacing an all­America tight end -not an enviable one in itself. But then, one by one, your top starters succumb to injur­ies. Before you know it, your starting quater-back is in another state recovering from surgery. Not the best of starts for the spring football session, but that is exactly what of­fensive coordinator and receiver coach Mike Stock is staring in the face with just two weeks of spring ball to go. 
"Our passing game is not par­ticularily well improved so far due to two main reasons," explains Stock. "First of all spring ball is for the fundementals so we are stressing the running game foremost. Secondly, due to our injuries, we've had to place younger kids into spots where veterans would usually be. Obviously, this limits your prog­

But as Stock is quick to note, this difficult situation does have it.-; ad­vantages. With the top prospects sit­ting out of the action the coaches have had an opportunity to see the underclassmen display their talents.

Spencer's team trailed by six at the half but managed to cut it to one at 17-16. The enthusia~m of the younger players payed off late in the game when a steal was turned into a fa~tbreak lay-up for the 20th point, ending their opponent's final threat.

Another seeded team, Red Barons, struggled early but eventually soured Sweet Lou's Wild Kingdom, 21-8. Sweet Lou's opened the game with good shooting to take a surpris­ing 5-4 lead. After settling down, the Barons took advantage of their su­perior height as Marty Roddy 
race with its 4-0 Midwest Lacrosse Association record, while Denison and Ohio Wesleyan also are unde­feated in four MLA games. 
"I would say that this is a 'must' win for us," says Irish coach Rich O'Leary, who is hoping that his team can successfully defend its MLA title. "Whoever wins this game will be in the best position to determine their own fate." 
Unfortunately for O'Leary, some things beyond his control -namely, injuries -have put the Irish at a dis­tinct disadvantage against the Big Red. Midfielder Tom Grote, who is currently fourth on the team in scoring with four goals and eight as­sist..~. will not make the trip and may miss more than a week because of soreness in a knee that he injured in the off-season. 


Additionally, attackman John Mcla<:hlan, who tied a school scoring record record with six goals and two assists last weekend at Wooster, sprained his ankle in practice on Monday and is question­able for tomorrow's game. 
"Without either of those guys. everyone is going w have to play a little harder." says O'Leary. "We can't make many mistakes, and we have to capitalize on whatever
