"Prizes · for Saturday's event winners are Distillery gift certificates,'' emphasized Chair­man John Rooney. 
''A total of $285 worth of these

tennis ball around the field. 

An ice cream eating contest is 
scheduled to follow the t, JCkey 
game. The first 25 people to sign 
up will compete to see who can eat 
a half-gallon of ice cream in the 
shortest time. 

A sack race, an egg toss and a

Off-campus SLC candidates outline platforms 
by Barb Langhenry 
Staff Reporter 
The Student life Council (SLC) elections are approaching with primaries scheduled for Monday. Tom Digan, John Kinney, Len Moly and John Steinman are contending for the off-campus representative spot. 
Tom Digan, a junior, states, "The SLC is currently discussing social space. I believe that there are more important things an<;! that the SLC should deal with things more fundamental to the stu dents." 
Digan continued, saying that he was not sure of the possibility of changing parietals, or instituting co-ed dorms, "but these things must get started."

The Student Committee on the American Future has organized a conferent·e entitled "The American Future: A Radical Perspective" to take place Mon., Feb. 23, Tues., Feb. 24 and Wed., Feb. 25. The conference consists of a series of lectures and panel discussions ''to revive the traditions of radical America and inspire a hope for the future."

Two poems on Greece followed, then Sarton asked, "I have six more poems that will take 20 minutes. Can you bear it?" A round of applause answered.

Digan cited the possibility of a student strike as an exhibition of students' power. "I wonder what the reaction of the adminstration would be," he said. "The SLC should be the thorn in the side of the administrlltion," he continued. 
John Kinney, sophomore, stated that he is most concerned with making sure there is a good means of communication between on and off-campus students. He said off-campus students are "left out and do not get the same and all of the necessary information." 
Kinney proposed the formation of an off-campus committee with a regular staff that would meet on a regular basis. This committee, he said, would integrate on the off­campus students by being open 
CILA and the Third World Fund will· sponsor the conference. Representatives of each of these groups compose the Student Com­mittee on the American Future which has organized the conference under the direction of faculty advisors including Fr. Claude Po­merleau and Dr. A. Peter Walshe. 
Walshe, director of African St­udies said, ''The conference is designed to recognize 
that there has been a long radical tradition in America." He pointed out. "Even the Constitution in its time was viewed as radical." 
Walshe beli~ves the American people should not forget about this radical tradition in 1976, but rather "build from that past a hope and direction for the future." 
Walshe stated the real tensions in present society are the result of a conflict between "America's hope for an egalitarian order and its economic injustices such as mal­distribution of income and unemp­loyment" 
Walshe believes these problems are coupled with an atmosphere of

and allowing both types of student to come and express their views. 
"The off-campus students are the most neglected and the SLC should make more policies concerning them," stated Len Moty , a junior. As an example, he said the university should look into ob­taining apartments in areas not so suspectible to crime, possibly on campus, but where parietals and rules are not involved. 
Moty stated the students should 
be more informed about what the 
SLC is doing. "They should also 
know that they can have a definite 
input by submitting a petition 
signed by SO or more students.'' 
Also featured in his platform are areas for students to gather in the early evening, like the Nazz and 
"psychological malaise" in a cul­
ture dominated by consumerism. 
He defined the core of the conference as asking "a very big question--What do we mean by the good life? What is our hope for the future?" 
Scheduled guest speakers for the conference are Harvey Cox, prof­essor from Harvard Divinity Sch­ool; Rosemary Ruether, professor of Histori~al Theology from How­ard University; Finley Campbell, director of Afro-American Studies at the University of Wisconsin; Lester Thurow, professor of Econ­omics from M.l.T.; Sheldon Gellar, assistant professor of Political Sci­ence at Indiana University; and Carl Estabrook, doctoral candidate in Historical Theology at Harvard. 
Advisor Walshe called these lecturers "speakers in the proph­etic tradition who will criticize the existing order and plot new direc­tion," which he feels is 'the thoroughly American thing to do.'' 
Walshe said the conference is not "an alternative ·to the official Bicentennial programs, but rather as a supplement" because "it looks to the future and not just the past."

SlF--Iast but not least 
stanley kunitz 
"His is the art of creating poetry for poetry's sake." Stanley Kunitz, the poet's poet with an imagination of the highest pitch, was born in 1905 in Worcester, Massachusetts. Graduating summa cum laude from Harvard in 1926, he received his masters the following year from the same university. Since this point Kunitz has distinguished himself not only as poet but as essayist, editor and translator 
Throughout these years of slow, careful production. Kunitz's poetry has been described as feminine and lyrical, full of tenderness and a delicacy of feeling. Yet it has been labelled savage and, more recently, marked by disturbing honesty. The poetry appearing in Intellectual Thin_gs (1930), his first book, is among the earliest to concentrate on the raw, solipsist self. It explores the self as it relates to the frustration and chaos of this age. These early poems are concerned with the unknown inner of infinite proportions. Passport to the Wars, published later that year, is concerned with the power of a mechanical environment over mind. This problem of corruption is constant in Kunitz's poetry where "under the pressure of one failure, energies that might have been concentrated upon service of human­ity of the love of God are dissipated in frustration and hysteria." Selected Poems 1928-1958 with its subtleties of perceptions won him the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1959. His latest collection is I~ Testing Tree (1970) 
Kunitz sees himself as a eitzen of the world and leaves moral responsibility to the individual in his writing. The human element emerges through imagery of earth, season, vegetation. Kunitz sees the self threatened and in " Night Letter" tells us "I suffer the twentieth century." The self must employ the act of writing to

When the endless servitude of woman will be overthrown, when she will live for herself and by herself, man  hitherto abominable,  having given her her release, she will be a poet, she also! Women wiD discover some of the un­known! Will her worlds of Ideas differ from ours? . She will discover strange unfathomable, repellent, delicious things; we shall take them, we shall comprehend them. Arthur Rimbaud-Lettre Du Voyant 
Patti Smith is a young poet who has emerged from the New York underground to become a major rock and roll star. Her first album, Horses, is a beautiful mixture of loud, agressive music and evocative poetry. The poetry is the most important aspect of her work. Though the musical influence of Lou Reed and much of the city's underground runs through much of her work it is of secondary importance. · The music would simply not be possible without the words and realizing this producer John Cale always keeps Patti's vocals in the foreground. 
Horses owes most of its poetic influences to Arthur Rimbaud, the revolutionary French poet who lived during the latter half of the 19th Century. Like much of Rimbaud's poetry, Patti's is often surreal­istic and hallucinatory. In songs like "Birdland" and "Land", disparate images merge in an evocative poetic landscape to create visions that suggest several mean­ings. Her poetic visions are parallel worlds in which one experiences a deranging of all the senses· a hallucinatory trip on words. Patti is able to do this by splitting reality in her songs between the real and the fantastic, dazzling one with her continual movement between them. 
Along with the continual flights from reality to fantasy, other motifs occur frequently in Horses. These include splitting of personality as a means of transcending reality ("Break It Up", "Birdland", "Land"), suggestions of les­bianism and homosexuality ("Gloria", "Redondo Beach"), death and rebirth ("Eiegie", "Land"), hope and despair, love and religion. The songs are thus so dense and complex that any attempt at a simple explanation in a 500 word review century experience. In more recent work there is a new open style. A separation of self becomes evident. 
In response to criticism that his poetry is obscure, Kunitz re-establishes the role of poet. ''A poet cannot concern himself with being fair to the reader. Time will tell. All poems contain a degree of mystery, as poetry is a discovery of one's hidden self.... Poetry is not concerned with communication; it has its roots in magic, incantation, and must be idealistic and selfish, independent of his audience, but "true to language --.true to man himself." 
In addition to his writing, Kunitz's works as editor include several collected bio­grap!-Jies and since 1969, the Yale Series of Younger Poets. He has lectured widely, including an extensive lecture tour of the Soviet Union and Poland under the auspices of the US-USSR cultural exchange agreement. He has translated and has filled the role of professor and poet-in-resi­dence on a string of American campuses. Kunitz is presently at Columbia University 
where he is an Adj\mct Professor of Writing at the graduate level. Kunitz gives his aim in teaching: "Essentially what I try to do is to help each person rediscover the poet within himself. I say 'rediscover' because I am convinced that it is a universal human attribute to want to play with words, to beat out rhythms, to fashion images, to tell a story, to construct forms.... The day is always in hili possession: what prevents him from using it is mainly inertia, the stultification of the senses as a result of our one-sided educational conditioning and the fear of being made ridiculous or ashamed by the exposure of his feelings."

would not only be ridiculous but an 
injustice to the artist. The songs/poems 
must be experiences as a step into a poetic 
consciousness that will not only reveal a· 
greater insight of the work, but an 
understanding of one's own consciouss­
ness. For in Horses Patti Smith's lyrical 
creations are glances into our own disor­
dered minds. The structures, tones and 
imagery often reveal a conflict between the 
poet's dreams And reality, joy and despair, 
love and death. Here the words and the 
way they are used function in counterpoint, 
the one diametrically epposed to the other. 
We find that our own minds work in very 
much the same way. 

The music however, is the element that draws the listener's immediate attention on first listening. Sparse yet forceful it contains most of the primitive elements of the New Y{)rk underground. This is not at all surprising when one considers the fact that Patti has surrounded herself with members of this circle. All of the original music on the lp was written or co-written by either Richard Sohl, Ivan Kral and Lenny Kaye of her band (Kaye the lead guitarist and a former critic for the Village Voice ), Alan Lanier, the keyboardist for Blue OysterCult or Tom Verlaine of Television (an avantgarde NY band already drawing comparisons with the Velvet Underground). Finally, the producer of Horses, John Cale, was an original member of the Velvets which has long been considered the most influential NY band. 
Two of the most interesting songs on the lp are Patti's interpolations of the rock classics, "Gloria" and "Land of a Thous­and Dances." In "Gloria," Patti turns a simple teenage love song into a sensuous clelbration of eroticism. With Richard Sohl's pounding piano backed by Kaye's monotonously churning guitar, Patti cuts into the song with a frenzied and passion­ate vocal. "Land", the most complex song on the album, starts with a story of a locker room assault. Patti is backed only by a repetitive two-chord drone on lead that grows louder as the confrontation leads to either an ambiguos murder or homosexual rape. As the boy "crashes against the locker'', he sees images of horses. This

Galway Kinnell, a contemporary Ameri­can poet and translator, will be reading at Notre Dame on Saturday, February 21, in conjunction with the Sophomore Literary Festival. His works have been widely published and he is well known for his dynamic style of presentation. 
Kinnell was born in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1927. He was educated at Princeton and the University of Rochester, and was a Fulbright Fellow in Paris in 1956-1957. He has been poet-in-residence at several universities since then and has won many awards and fellowships for his poetry, including a Guggenheim fellow­ship, the Cecil Hemley poetry prize, and the Brandeis University Creative Arts award. 
Kinnell has been active in political and social reform. In 1963 he was a member of the Congress for Racial Equality and a field worker with CORE. He was jailed for civil rights activities in Selma, Alabama. He was also strongly against the Vietnam war and was one of those active in the anti-war poetry readings of the 60's. 
Kinnell's outlook on life has been described as Sisyphean; that is, he feels man finds his triumph in the struggle of life, not in any tangible accomplishment. Reflecting this attitude, his poetry is 
· serious, almost grim; but there may be found in it elements of hope for the endurance of mankind. He concentrates on themes of nature, time and death and works with them to produce very personal and haunting poems. 
Although his early works were written in a traditional rhyming style, Kinnell has since stated his opinion that free verse is the only possible medium for an American poet. He has said that " ...the real value of getting rid of rhyme and meter is to throw the responsibility for the poem wholly on speech itself.'' Therefore, he doesn't agree with poets who arrange their poems on the 
page in unconventional forms. He feels this 
is nothing but a new device instead of the 
old ones, and that one cannot face the 
shortcomings of the poem's language with 
this camouflage. 
The Book of Nightmares, published in 
1971, is Kinnell's latest book. It is a series 
of ten interrelated poems and the subject 
of most of them is death. A review of The 
Book of Nightmares in Poetry magazine 
said, "(Kinnell's) nightmares are recoun­
ted here with an eye for awful detail." 
Compared to the mystical quality of The 
Book of Nightmares and Body Rags 
(published in 1968), The Avenue Bearing 
the Initial of Christ into the New World is 
varied in style. Avenue takes selections 
from 1946 to 1964. Thus it is possible to 
trace the development of Kinnell's style in 
this volume. 
In the title poem, Kinnell gives us a view of life along Avenue C on the Lower East side of New York City. He also gives us an insight into his view of God. 
Children set fires in ashbarreis, 
Cats prowl the fires, scraps of fishes 
bum. 
A child lay in the flames. 
It was not the plan. Abraham 
Stood in terror at the duplicity. 
Isaac whom he loved lay In the flames. 
The Lord turned away washing 
His hands without soap and water 
IJke a eommori houseUy. 
The Avenue Bearing the lriitlal of Christ Into the New World, as well as Body Rags and The Book of Nightmares are now on sale at the bookstore.

Next week's offerings from the networks start out strong but faulter pitifully by Thursday. For you blood-and-guts people, the master of police . bruitality, Clint Eastwood, will be again reducing the population in "Dirty Harry" on Saturday night on channel 16. It has been successfully argued that Clint Eastwood is the finest screen psychopath since King Kong and"'Dirty Harry"is state's evidence #1. ABC counters brilliantly with 
S. W.A.T. but for you fortunate people with cable TV,there is a respite in the form of a "Monster Concert", a PBS special with 20 pianists. The rest of the night is condusive to bar-hopping or tiddly-winks playing or whatever. Nice Errol Flynn movie at 2:10 
a.m. on channel 9 for you high-freaks out there. 
You can sleep late Sunday morning, that is unless you want to hear what Oral Roberts has to say or what some half-baked politician doesn't have to say. The good stuff starts later in the evening with a Jacques Cousteau special on whales (chan­nel 28, at 7) and comes to a head with the highly acclaimed movie, "The Last Detail" 
In it, Jack Nicholson and Otis Young are two Navy "lifers" that are assigned to take Meadows, a sweet, naive 18-year old to prison for slugging an officer. Deciding that the boy will need some memories to keep him going for his 8-year stretch, they show him the town. 'After 3 days and 180

Its release immediately finds Patti Smith at the vanguard of rock with Bob Dylan, John Cale, and Brian Eno; artists who are establishing important new directions in popular music. Horses is as masterful a work as Blonde on Blonde, the third Velvets lp, Layla, and Berlin. like those albums it must be considered as one of the finest rock and roll albums ever made .

Letters 
to a Lonely God I 
l I

it was a lovely way to spend an evening I I 
j 

There was a girl friend I had once: a warm, lovely girl, whose body always seemed to glow with light as though she had slept with the sun. Being shy, I never touched that body much, though I wanted to, but l always dreamed of the firmness I would find under my fingertips, as though my hands were playing with the shapes of ripened fruit. Her name was Jane, and l was in love with her, l guess; I hoped that she was in love with me. From the first moment I met her, I thought her a doll, because she had the kind of beauty that doll makers like to use as a pattern. There 
were blue eyes, of course, ·and there was the soft. braided gold of her hair which she wore in a crown like a princess. Her face was not the least bit like a flower, but it was so full of sunshine that golden chrysanthemums could have been her handmaids. Her nose needed freckles to be perfect, I always thought; I would have imported those freckles, if I could have; it was the least that a lover could do. But there was a war on, and girls' faces that season came only in peaches and cream. 
The year was 1943, and Jane worked after school as a Campfire Girl selling war bonds and stamos in a booth at Wool­worth's. Girls in those days were impor­
tuned in a popular song not to "sit under the apple tree /With anyone else but me"; "me" being some G.!. Joe off in the war-zones. But for two years, until I started college, I was the kid that Jane sat under the apple tree with, though, for a while, I suspected she would have pre­ferred me as a Marine she could have knitted sweaters for. On our first date, we attended a Frank Sinatra movie, and the big song was, "This Is A Lovely Way To Spend An Evening". Afterwards, we walked for miles on the summer grass of the Promenade and the Boulevard, and \ carried her shoes in my pocket as she went 
nShe belongs to the dream I had of being ordained; she is part of the mystery of my uocation." 

why can't women be ordained? 
For years lay women were content with the ·interpretation of their role in the Catholic church--sitting in the pew, running bake sales, directing the parish choir. Sisters obediently taught religious classes and visited the sick. But as a result of the feminist movement and the emphasis of the Second Vatican Council on personhood, 
womenare questioning these stereotypes. They want leadership positions in pastoral ministry and the sacramental rights which bless them. This growing awareness forsees women doning priestly vestments and consecrating bread and wine as the complete fulfillment of their role. 
To examine the scope of women's rise in the church, the Advisory Council of Women Students is sponsoring a panel discussion, "Women in Ministry" Sunday, Feb. 22. 8:00 in the library auditorium. Sr. Cathline Hu~hes of the Murphy Center for Liturgical Research will moderate the panel consisting of Dr. Elizabeth Fiorenza, Dr. Josephine Ford, and Dr. William Storey, associate professors of theology at Notre Dame, as well as Msgr. John Egan, director of the Center for Pastoral and Social Ministry. 
"Ordination will come about not through a wild revolution but through a peaceful on-going dialogue. It is our duty to keep this dialogue alive," says Sr. Cathline Hughes. Sr. Hughes attended the nation­wide ordination conference, "Women in the Future Priesthood Now" which was held last November in Detroit. She feels that women have the ''right to test" the vocation to which they feel called. 
"Women had more of a role in the .church of the Middle Ages then they do now," barefoot. It seemed so natural for her to be the barefoot child of summer; but for me, barefoot would have been merely clumsy; so I scuffed along beside her in my Tom MeAns', cursing the fate of having fat feet. It she felt like Ariel dating Caliban, she never mentioned it; and at the end of the walk, we said to each other: "If this is puppy love, what can the real thing be like?" It was, indeed, a lovely way to spend an evening; and in all the years afterwards, it has been my most perfect memory of the time when l was young, and the world was seventeen. 
commented  Dr.  Storey,  head  of  the  
Graduate  Progra m of Liturgical  Studies.  
  

I was thinking of Jane at quarter past four this morning as I trudged home through the rain with Darby from the Club O'Gill. Seven hours earlier, in a meeting with some Freshmen in one of their colloquia, a young man had asked me the question of myself: · 
"Why the priesthood?" 
I answered: "Why not the priesthood?" 
"Celibacy," he replied. 
If you have-wa.lked under a June moon with a girl who reminds you of noonday ...if you have smelled the perfumes in her hair, and you have almost touched with your fingertips the laughter and the caring in her warm flesh; and her hand touches your hand as though she thought your being shy and clumsy were signs and promises that you could be trusted not to hurt her, ever ... if you have known a summer walk when the sun has danced in the darkness, and the stars are singing of the lovely ways to spend an evening .. .if you have done some of these things, or all of these things, or none of these things, but others just as good ... then celibacy, by contrast, must always seem like a denial of life. 
These were my thoughts as I walked home with a soggy dog at four o'clock this morning. If the young man who ques­tioned me thought of celibacy as a denial of 
I I

Reverend Robert Griffin I 
life, he never said so. But my friends long ago thought of celibacy as a denial of life. and my family thought so. Whenever I 
spoke  of  the  priesthood,  their  instant  
objection  was:  "But  you  can  never  
marry."  From that day  to  this,  it  has  

always troubled me to be regarded as a juiceless, joyless vegetabl'j who rejected marriage. It makes me defensive, as though I were thought to be incapable of accepting a basic human arrangement 
intended for the fulfillment of flesh and blood, like some poor. pale ghost who grooves on incense instead of consumma­tions. 
In the excitement of entering a semi­nary, you don't really reject anything. You just accept the possibility of other arrange­ments. When you enter a seminary, you don't know if you're going to become a priest or not. You may hope to become a priest; you may say prayers that you'll be ordained. But others have prayed for the same thing: they left, and you may leave too. You may say: "I won't leave until they throw me out"; but you say it fearfully, knowing that better men than you are. have been sent packing. Ordina­tion, if it comes, is a special arrangement in which you trust God to be your portion and your inheritance, and He trusts you to be His witness in a discipline requiring you to be celibate, just as religious brothers and sisters are celibate. Marriage, too, is a special kind of witness, even for some ·priests in union with Rome. and it may be a better arrangement than celibacy even for the one who has chosen to be celibate; but both marriage and celibacy, under God's blessing, are roads leading home to the 
Kingdom. 
IfI write dithyrambs about girl friends in the moonlight, it is not as a declaration of "Me, tooism" to be included among the folks who are affirmers of life. Marriages as well as celibacy are made of sterner stuff than moonlight in my true love's hair. But I think that there is a romance that leads each one of us to his commitment, and all romance begins with a hungPr in the flesh for loving and being loved. 
I cannot begin to tell you what an honor it is, and has been, to be a Roman Catholic priest ordained into the membership of the religious community of the Congregation of Holy Cross. On the morning I was ordained, when the Bishop spoke the 
I 

I words: "I call you now not servants, but l friends," the joy in me was so intense, so 
I perfect, so overwhelming, that I thought I I was breaking apart inside. "I am a priest 
I 
j

forever," I kept thinking to myself; "a priest forever and ever and ever ... " I "Fairy tales can come true--It can happen to you--If you're young at heart," 
I 

says the song. Maybe being a priest I 
j

forever is a fairy tale; but it is a fairy tale that is as substantial in its beauty as the I berry brown feet of a girl in the summer I grass. Maybe the priesthood is a trick like I moonbeams that hope plays on the heart. I Maybe it is a boy's dream turned by age I into metaphysical longings. Maybe it's the I Arabian tales of Schcherezade turned I Jewish and come true for a Thousand and l One Nights. I 
But maybe--just maybe--the priesthood l is a gift that will be young for a thousand I years after the moon and the stars and the t-1 sun have fallen from the sky. 
I said goodbye to Jane in 1954 when I 
l 

went away to college. By then, both of us knew if we had lovely evenings to spend. 
l 

we would not be spending them together. I 
i I 
was already determined to become a priest, and she started going out with my best friend. Three years later, I went home to her wedding. The night before the j marriage vows were exchanged, we walked together for the last time in a summer 
1 
night. In the week I was ordained in 1954, 
~ 

she had her first child. It was a boy, but she didn't name it after me, as l hoped she might. By this time, you see, she had 
~ 

forgotten about not sitting under the apple tree with anyone else but me. I never forgot it. I haven't forgotten it yet, after nearly twenty-two years as a priest. 
None of those twenty-two years would have been the same if there had never been a girl so golden that I was afraid to touch her worth. She belongs to the dream I had of being ordained; she is part of the mystery of my vocation. 
I still feel clumsy when I think of her, as thought I were walking beside her on overweight feet. I feel clumsy when I write of her, as though I were treading on very thin ice. I would never write of her at all if a freshman, last night, hadn't asked me about the priesthood. I want him to know that the priesthood includes not only a man's best hopes, but also the memories of a dream he has never denied himself. 
"In the past, women served as deacones­ses and abbesses. Some abbesses were so powerful that they had jurisdiction over bishops." 
Having received a B.A. in philosophy from the University of Western Ontario, and an 
M.A. in philosophy and a Ph.D. in Medieval Studies from Notre Dame, Storey's prime interest is in the medieval history of the church and the development _ of liturgy. He disagrees with the Catholic Church's appeal to sacred tradition as a defense. 
"l don't understand the argument that just because women haven't been priests they shouldn't be," Storey said. He believes there are no theological reasons why women should not be ordained. 
"I conceive of the church as being an agent of liberation but in this instance it is an agent of oppression,'' Storey concluded. 
With an 'Ordain Women Now' button gleaming on her door the office of Dr. Josephine Ford is distinguishable from 
. other paculty offices in the library laby­rinth. Dr. Ford brings an English perspec­tive to this issue as she was raised in Nottinghamshire, England and received degrees from Nottinham University and King's College, London. As a student she became committed to the.women's ordina­tion movement and she remembers the exact date as if it were a moment of conversion. 
"On January 3, 1961 I was at a meeting of the St. Joan's alliance where I met a 70-year-old woman. During the conversa­tion she confronted me, 'Give me one reason why women can't be ordained.' At first I said they just shouldn't but as I continually reflected on it, I realized that all of my misgivings were emotional." 
Dr. Ford has been.. involved ever since. 
.. 

Among her seven books, and 70 some articles is a book on women in the Pentecostal movement. Published in 1969, Spirit In the Human Pel'SOn discusses the paternali§'t:ic way the church treats women and the handicapped without full minister­ial responsibility. ' 
By teaching at the University of East Africa in Uganda for two years, Dr. Ford became sensative to the religious restric­tions which "frustrate educated women in the third world.'' 
She attended the November ordination conference but believes that the strategims it discussed were not agressive enough. 
''The general atmosphere of the confer­ence was gentle, unthreatening, prayerful. We are expected to be good girls, meek and mild. I think the time has come to take an agressive approach," Ford believes. "We have a right to ordination." The button on her door attests to that. 
Dr. Elizabeth Fiorenza also attended the ordination conference and formally replied to one of the given speeches. 
"I argued that if women are to be admitted to the deaconate then they must also be ordained priests and bishops. They must be allowed to participate at all levels.'' 
Dr. Fiorenza's interest in the women's movement in the church was a concern of hers as a unversity student. She recevied her licentiate in Pastoral Theology from Wueburg, Germany and her doctorate in New Testament Studies from Munster, Germany. In 1961 herthesison lay women in the church was published. "It was at a time when there was nothing on the issue," she said. Besides her book, Ministry of Women and the Church, she has had feminist articiles published in Theological Studies and the International 

christie herlihy 

Journal Concilium. 
''The growing pressure to acknowledge women" has become a deep sincere interest in America, she notices. In the United States the issue is regarded as a theological one which involves deep pene­tration into Catholic doctrine. In Germany, however, the movement is viewed as concerning women's entry into positions within the church. 
Dr. Fiorenza is also credited with introducing a new course; "Women tn the Church" into Notre Dame's theology curriculum and she has plans for another course concerning women in the Bil?le. 
The ordination of women is a justice issue with which Msgr. John J. Egan, is well aquainted. Director of the Center for Pastoral and Social Ministry, Egan has taken an active interest in this issue and he attended the November ordination confer­ence. He is also chairman of the Catholic Committee on Urban Ministry (CCUM) which in its annual convention held last fall devoted discussion to the women's ordina­tion issue. CCUM invited Sr, Elizabeth Carrol, one of the leaders of the movement. 
Graduated from De Paul University and St. Mary of the Lake Seminary, Egan was ordained in 1943 and is currently a senior fellow of the theology department of the Institute for Urban Studies. 
In 1973, Egan was the recipient of Notre Dame's first annual Reinhold Niebuhr A ward for distinction in the area of social justice in modern life. 
The role of women in the church is a pressing issue today as Notre Dame's own theologians agree. The panel discussion ~unday should explore the diverse implica­tiOns of the movement from the Vatican in Rome to the· neighborhood parish Friday, February 20, 1976
