Inmates riot in English prison; deaths alleged 
MANCHESTEH, England (API -About 700 inmates rioted at a erowded 19th century prison Sunday, oecupying rooftops, smashing windows and setting !ires. At least 50 guards and inmates were injured. poliee said. 
Television newseasts carried uneon11rnwd reports that wit­rwsses had seen up to 12 bod­ins. A police spokesman said inmates brought out of Strangeways Prison also re­ported deaths, but that police would not be able to confirm this until they reached the cen­tor of the eomplex. 
The Home Office said no hostages were being held, and polkll said talks with prisoners were under way. There was no clear indication of the cause of the rioting at the medium-secu­rity prison. built in the Victo­rian era and now one of the most crowdlld in Europe. 
Home Office spokesman Charles Keseru said prison of­ficers regained control of one wing of the jail Sunday evening and found no seriously injured inmates. The office said 12 in­
jured  staff members  and  25  
inmates  were  taken  to  area  
hospitals.  

Hundreds of riot police sur­rounded the prison and a police helicopter hovered overhead as flame leaped 20 feet into the air from the prison gymnasium, where a fire burned out of eon­trot. 
Twenty-five firefighters under police protection battled the blaze as dense blaek smoke bil­lowed above the building. 
Fires also were reported to have been set in three cells and a classroom as large groups of inmates rampaged inside.

Breslin and Kinkopf assess past year as overall success

"It's been a smooth year and thank God for that," Matt Breslin, Student Body President for the 19R9-90 school year. said. rdleeting on Student Gov­ernment's past year. 
Breslin and Vice President Dave Kinkopf agreed that the past year has been an overall success for Student Govern­mnnt. 
One outstanding aceomplish­ment was the matching funds reinstatement, according to Kinkopf. The office of Student Affairs threatened to withhold matching funds to dorms after a snowball light broke out this past October. "Here is an ex­ample where we as representa­tives worked with the adminis­tration to correct what we felt was an [injustice against) the student body," Kinkopf said

The first of a two-part series. 

"We took the proper channels and we did our homework," Breslin said, crediting part of their reinstatement success to the "strong working relation­ship" Student Government has had with Student Affairs Direc­tor, Father David Tyson. 
Students are often skeptical about the effectiveness of Stu­dent Government, according to Breslin. The faet that Student Government was able to get the matching funds reinstated shows that "it does work," Breslin added. 
The founding of the National Association of Students at Catholic Colleges and Universi­ties (NASCCU) was another outstanding accomplishment, according to Breslin. 
"We never anticipated this success," Breslin admitted, re­ferring to the first annual NASCCU conferenee held at Notre Dame this past Febru­ary. "It went off without a hitch" 
The founding of NASCCU put Notre Dame students on a level of national awareness. accord­ing to Kinkopf. "That was cer­tainly one of our biggest ac­complishments." 
Breslin also pointed to Safe­Walk Escort Service as another major achievement, even though it was not on his origi­nal platform. "It was one of

In. other security matters, 
Breslin said that emergency phones would be placed in parking lots by next August. Similarly, Student Government has reeeived approval for in­stalling phones in academic buildings, although this has not yet been carried out. 
Student Government has con­tinued to enhance campus intel­lectual life with the Iceberg De­bates, World Awareness Week series, and Hall Fellows pro­gram, aceording to Kinkopf. 
The vice president also noted that Student Government's idea for a South Dining Hall buffet on parents' football weekend drew a crowd of over 1,000 people. "We hope that becomes a tradition." 
"Lots of little things" have been accomplished, Kinkopf said, pointing to lighting im­provements around campus,

"We didn't have complete suceess," Breslin admitted, noting the failures of the 24­hour lounge and the Fac­ulty/Course Evaluation (FCE) booklet. 
"There were so many things to accomplish-we had to set our priorities," Breslin said. "At the time, the 24-hour lounge was important, but when the security issues came up, [the 24-hour lounge[ didn't become a priority." 
"We really tried with the Faculty/Course Evaluations," Breslin added. "Unfortunately, the response wasn't there and we weren't able to get the booklet of IFCE results) out."

Weekend with moms builds friendships 
Saint Mary's Junior 

Moms' Weekend took place over this past weekend. It was a most enlightening ex­perience for both mothers and daugh­ters. At the 


Mother/Daughter Melissa Mass, Father Stella McAndrews :-vas ~u~te perceptive Assistant SMC Editor 
m pomtmg out the irony of the weekend coinciding with April Fool's Day. The question to be answered is "who are the real fools?" 
Most of us have spent the past three years presenting our mothers with our own cen­sored version of life in South Bend. 
In the many stories we have passed on, places such as the Library and the all night study lounge have been mentioned fre­quently. When they-call at 8 a.m. on a Fri­day, you explain the hell in your voice with an "all-nighter" at the computer lab, although you were nowhere remotely in the vicinity. 
As far as bars and parties go, you've con­vinced them that loud music, large crowds, and the smell of beer makes you nauseous. One of my roommates went so far as to convince her parents that our apartment at Campus View was actually a part of Saint Mary's campus. 
In order to maintain our angelic images. we began by making our apartment as pre­sentable as possible. It was no easy task; after hours of hard work the carpeting was no longer crunchy, cockroaches no longer roamed the kitchen at will, and most of the black slime had been removed from the bathrooms. 
However, as much as we tried, there was 
no conceivable way to camouflage the eight 
foot bar. We simply prayed that they would 
not notice. 
Our next task was censorship. Hours 
were spent discussing which stories could 
and could not be told in front of our moth­
ers. Choosing which pictures could be 
shown without tarnishing our images took 
even longer. 
Upon the request of some of the mothers, 
we were forced to take them to the local 
taverns. It was difficult to decide between 
the many classy joints South Bend has to 
offer. We knew we would be unable to hold 
on to our "all work and no play" images 
much longer. 
It proved burdensome to keep up the cha­
rade when the bouncer at the door called us 
all by name and didn't bother checking our 
ID's. We knew we were in trouble when the 
bartender winked and asked "the usual?" 

We knew our covers had been blown. The jig was up. Then a really funny thing hap­pened. Our mothers admitted to us that they had never been fooled by any of our act. We were the real fools. 
Suddenly we had reached a new plateau in our mother/daughter relationship: hon­esty. We crossed the line and were headed into the forbidden territory of true friend­ship. Where we go from here, only time will tell.

Dutch prison guards foil attempt by U.S. servicemen to rescue Air Force sergeant 
UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) -Dutch prison guards foiled an attempt by 12 Americans, including several servicemen, to seize a U.S. Air Force sergeant imprisoned on charges of killing his wife, television re­ports said Sunday. 
A Justice Ministry spokesman reacted by warning of "a seri­ous diplomatic conflict," ac­cording to Dutch television. 
Television reports said the in­cident occurred Friday after the Dutch High Court ruled that Sgt. Charles Short could not be extradited to the United States to stand trial on the murder charges. 
The 12 U.S. citizens, including several members of the U.S. Air Force, were waiting in several cars with U.S. license plates outside a jail in the central Dutch city of Utrecht, the tele­vision said. Short was due to return there from the High Court ruling in The Hague, 37 miles away, according to the report. 
Prison guards who saw the Americans asked them what they were doing, and the guards were told the men were waiting for Short to take him to the United States, apparently for trial, the report said. 
There was no immediate word of how the guards thwarted them or whether the Americans were armed. 
The television report quoted a Justice Ministry spokesman as saying, "The (12) Americans are way off the mark here. They should keep their paws off Short, or else there will be a se­rious diplomatic incident." 
The spokesman was not iden­tified in the report. A security guard at the ministry said no spokesman could be reached until Monday. 
The television report quoted Short's unidentified defense at­torney as saying the Americans were trying to mount "a little Panama." It was a reference to the U.S. invasion of that nation in December to topple dictator 
Manuel Noriega. 

Short was arrested on April 1, 1988, and accused of killing his Turkish-born wife, cutting her body into pieces and dump­ing the remains in plastic bags in Monnikendam, 56 miles from the U.S. Air Force base at Soesterberg. He was serving there with the 32nd Tactical Fighter Squadron. 
He was transferred to U.S. 
military police a few days later, 
but he was eventually handed 
back to Dutch authorities for 
trial. 

The High Court ruled Short's extradition would be illegal since he could be sentenced to death if convicted of murder by a U.S. court.

Soviet armored trucks unloaded in Lithuania 
VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (APJ ­Dozens of Soviet armored per­sonnel carriers, troops and support vehicles were unloaded Sunday from railroad cars near the capital of Lithuania and driven through the city's streets. 
Western reporters counted almost 30 armored vehicles be­ing unloaded near the Vilnius airport. Others rumbled through the city, their treads slicing into the asphalt, appar­ently on their way to a nearby base. Young, bare-headed sol­diers were peering out of the lookouts. 
The reinforcement of the Vil­nius garrison came in broad daylight when many residents were out for Sunday strolls to savor the spring sunshine. 
The move was the latest at­tempt by Moscow to persuade the Baltic republic to rescind its March 11 declaration of inde­pendence. 
Moscow has repeatedly said it will not use force to bring Lithuania back in line, but Sun­day's move increased Lithua­nian fears that the Soviets planned an assault to force Lithuania to renounce its inde­pendence. 
Since March 11, Moscow has sent personnel carriers and trucks already stationed in Vil­nius through the capital's streets, dropped leaflets con­demning the secession and oc­cupied Communist Party and government buildings. 
Before Sunday, the Red Army had an estimated 30,000 sol­diers stationed in Lithuania at several army bases, including at least one in Vilnius. 
On Saturday, President Mikhail Gorbachev issued two harshly worded statements ad­dressed to Lithuania's Supreme Council legislature and the Lithuanian people. Gorbachev urged the rebellious republic to cancel its declaration of inde­pendence and to enter into ne­gotiations with the Kremlin on the basis of the Soviet Constitu­tion. 
He warned that a refusal may

Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis rejected Gor­bachev's appeal Saturday night, saying the Soviet leader was demanding "impossible things." 
But Landsbergis told re­porters he would send negotia­tors to Moscow on Monday to try to set up a meeting with So­viet officials and that the 
Supreme  Soviet  would  also  
meet  Monday  to  consider its  
answer.  

In Vilnius, Lithuanian officials reported that a column of some 15 armored personnel carriers moved through the city in the early morning hours. A duty officer at the republic's In­terior Ministry said the vehicles rolled into a military base in central Vilnius just three miles from the Parliament building. 
Eduardas Potashinkas, an ac­tivist and Lithuanian TV editor, said many concerned residents had called the television and Lithuanian radio to report troop movements overnight. 
Western journalists reported that they saw some 30 to 40 armored personnel carriers, full support vehicles and sol­diers being unloaded from a train near the airport north of Vilnius at about noon Sunday.

Matheney murder trial jury selection to begin 
CROWN POINT, Ind. (AP) ­Prospective jurors summoned Monday for the murder trial of Alan Matheney faee a doubly daunting task: not only must they judge a man who faces death if convicted, the jurors must live sequestered out-of­town and separated from friends and family during Christian and Jewish holy days. 
Once a jury is seleeted, its members will be transported to South Bend, where the trial will be eonducted in a St. Joseph County eourtroom before a Lake County judge. 
The unusual arrangements are part of a ehange of venue granted Matheney, who is eharged in the beating death of his former wife while he was on prison furlough. 
Matheney is charged in the Mareh 4, 1989, beating death of Lisa Bianeo, 29, outside her Mishawaka home. The slaying occurred while Matheney was free on an eight-hour prison furlough during an eight-year term imposed for a 1987 as­sault on Ms. Bianco. Matheney and Ms. Bianco were divorced in 1985. 
At least 100 residents of Lake County were ordered to appear for jury duty before Judge James Letsinger, who will pre­side over the trial. 
The opening witnesses have been subpoenaed to appear Wednesday in the South Bend courtroom. If jury selection takes longer than two days, though, the lawyers' opening statements and the start of tes­timony would be delayed. 
In any case, the trial will probably last at least two weeks, court observers say. That schedule could interfere with jurors' observance of Passover, the week-long Jewish commemoration that begins April 10, or Easter weekend on the Christian religious calen­dar, which begins April 13 with Good Friday. 
During jury selection, the questions posed by trial attor­neys may be shaped by the death penalty and a likely de­fense of insanity. 
Prospeetive jurors in death penalty cases are routinely questioned about their beliefs in capitol punishment. In past Indiana cases, those who op­

pose it under any eircumstances are excused by the court from serving. 
Defense attorneys who con­tend their clients were insane when the crime occurred often ask prospective jurors their opinions of an insanity defense. A prospect who believes the de­fense to be simply a dodge to avoid conviction could be elimi­nated. 
The prosecution and defense in a death penalty murder case may eliminate 20 jury prospects apiece. The judge may excuse an unlimited number of people who have good reasons not to serve.

Former D.E.A. agent says politics are detriment to the war on drugs 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Mike Levine is angry. 
The longtime Drug Enforce­ment Administration under­cover agent contends the war on drugs is a sham run by "suits" in Washington who care more about their jobs than about winning the war or pre­serving the lives of agents on the street. 
Levine says they killed the better part of his last major case while needlessly putting his life and the lives of other agents in jeopardy. 
If the plan had been carried out, he says, agents could have arrested leaders of the Corpo­ration, which runs Bolivia's co­caine operations, and a major Bolivian money launderer in Panama while seizing at least 38 tons of cocaine at secret air strips in Bolivia. 
But it was not to be.

There will be a wake service held today at Holy Child Jesus Church in Canton, Miss. 
A funeral Mass will be celebrated Tuesday at St. Mary Catholic Church in Jackson, Miss., with burial at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tenn. 
Bowman was scheduled to receive the Laetare Medal, the oldest and most prestigious award given to American Catholics, at Notre Dame's May 20 commencement exercises. The award will be made for the first time posthumously. 
The award, named for the 
fourth Sunday in Lent, has been· 
awarded annually since 1883 to 
Catholics "whose genius has 
ennobled the arts and sciences, 
illustrated the ideals of the 
church and enriched the 
heritage of humanity."

The Associated Press contributed to this report. 
So a frustrated Levine, who retired from the DEA last year, wrote a book about his experi­ences called "Deep Cover." 
"The whole drug war has now become a political grab bag," Levine said in a recent in­terview. "All of these people (leading the war on drugs) have their arms in this grab bag for every reason you can imagine." 
The book focuses on a case ­Operation Trifecta -that ended in early 1988. It resulted in convictions and long sen­tences for several Mexican and Bolivian drug traffickers. 
But Levine says it could have done much more if bureaucrats had not stood in the way of his plan to buy 15,000 kilos (more than 30,000 pounds) of cocaine with $5 million, allowing him to penetrate the upper reaches of the Bolivian cocaine trade.

On a later trip, DEA headquarters insisted that the agents again conduct busi­ness at the Marriott.

Breslin and Kinkopf were both pleased with their overall administration. "It's been a phenomenal experience," Bres­lin said. "[Dave and I] worked so well together." 
"We'd like to thank students for letting us do this," Kinkopf said. 
Breslin agreed. "It was a once in a lifetime experience. I'm go­ing to miss it."

Bomb victim faces more treatment 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -Mau­reen Bower wishes the person responsible for the pipe bomb that maimed her young daugh­ter almost a year ago could sec the lasting effects of his cruel act. 
Erin Bower, 6, has been fitted with an artificial left hand and is attending school. Next month she will undergo a cornea transplant for her left eye, which also was damaged in the April 17, 1989, blast at a K mart department store. 
The person who put the bomb on the K mart shelf has not been caught. 
"I don't get down as fre­quently as I used to, but when we had to make the decision on the cornea transplant, it re­hashed all the garbage again ­that we were going to have to put her back in the hospital again, and we were going to have to limit her in her activi­ties," said Mrs. Bower. "That bothers me. I wish we didn't have to do that anymore. 
"That's when I started fre­quently wishing that this person would see what he has done. I got real upset with that person, and I usually don't think about that person at all. But when you have to relive all this again, it's tough," she said. 
Erin was shopping with her family at the K mart in Castle­ton when she picked up a tube of toothpaste. The tube ex­ploded. 
Federal agents remain opti­mistic they will crack the case eventually.

U.S. regains position as leading exporter 
Monday,April2, 1990 

money ecause o lack of space, limited inventory 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The United States regained its spot as the world's leading exporter last year after losing it to West Germany, the International Monetary Fund reported Sun­day. 
The IMF said U.S. foreign sales were worth $364 billion for 1989, compared with 
$341.4  billion  for  West Ger­ 
many.  Japan  was  third with  
$273.9 billion.  

West Germany, which toppled the United States from the No. 1 trade spot in 1986, and Japan both had trade surpluses, how­ever, while the United States still had a deficit of $128.9 bil­lion, down from $137.1 billion, according to the IMF's trade calculations. 
The deficit is due to the fact that the United States is also the world's greatest importer and its imports also grew rapidly, to $492.9 billion from $459.5 billion. 
The West German surplus, now the world's largest, amounted to $71.4 billion, and Japan's was $63.9 billion, the IMF reported.

South Bend 
By PATRICK NINNEMAN 
Business writer 
Timothy Roemer, a Demo­cratic U.S. Congress candidate for the South Bend area, dis­cussed pertinent business issues with the Notre Dame Council on Business Development last week. 
Roemer, who has taught Po­litical Science at American Uni­versity and has worked as an advisor on trade and military issues for Senator DeConcini of Arizona, spoke on topics rang­ing from campaign spending reform to education issues, but the main focus of the discus-
Four myths about the American economy today: 
(1) Japanese investment is viciously exploiting America. 
It's slowly beginning to dawn on some brighter souls on both sides of the Pacific that, if anything, the reverse is true. The more open (far from totally free) U.S. econ­omy has indeed attracted Japanese and other foreign businesses. As a result, American jobs are being cre­ated and American communities are gaining new tax revenues; for example, 13 "foreign" firms already are making television sets in this country-and Honda plans eventually to make more cars in America than in Japan. Such "exploitation" has in fact been a major continuing factor in our ability to avoid nationwide recession. 
Meanwhile, while Ameri­cans have prospered even while grumbling about such alien investment, it has started to occur to many Japanese themselves that a larger taste of such "foreign sion was America's new eco­nomic challenges. Roemer dis­cussed some of his concerns while also listening to the ideas of the students. 

Roemer stressed the need for strong leadership from our governmental leaders, particu­larly in light of the past year's events. In particular, he noted the decreased threat from the Soviet Union, and whether this renders a "peace dividend" for other policy areas and the economy as a whole. 
"We need to get back into a mode as a country that is strong based upon great prod­ucts, strong based upon com-
exploitation" might be help­
ful at home-and so, how­
ever painfully, markets there 
are slowly opening. Now 
that the Tokyo stock 
exchange has signaled that 
it may be human, after all, 
and the Japanese economy 
has proved capable of 
producing something other 
than nonstop miracles, 
Japan's consumers are 
asking more urgently why 
they don't have a wider 
range of products at more 
attractive prices. They 
worry, indeed, that too much of their prosperity is being single-mindedly exported. 
(2) Responsible politicians must soon set to work rais­ing the taxes that were slashed too deeply in the 1980s. 
That eminent economic analyst, Dan Rostenkowski, gets such a reverent hearing from the Washington press corps that few have exam­ined even his most basic premise. In truth, though, the notion that taxes were reduced excessively in the past decade is entirely with­out factual merit. Federal using different means of calcu­lating the trade imbalance, has put the 1989 merchandise trade deficit at $109 billion. 

Of six major countries, the United States had the largest increase in foreign sales, 12.5 percent, the IMF said. West German exports also rose, by 
5.6 percent to $341 billion. Since East Germany also is an important trader, a reunified Germany may take over the world's first place as exporter once again. 
As a group, the 22 countries the fund classifies as industrial increased their buying faster than their sales last year, with many of the imports apparently from the Third World. 
Led by the United States, they imported $2.2 trillion worth of goods in 1989, up 8. 7 percent. Their exports also rose, to $2.1 trillion , but that was an in­crease of only 6.5 percent -a widening of their overall trade deficit. 
But the West Germans im­ported only $270 billion dollars worth. 


area Congressional candidate advocates 
By Louis Rukeyser 
Tribune Media Services 
taxes at the end of the decade were as high as at the start, and when you add in the average citizen's state and local taxes you find that the beleaguered American taxpayer in 1990 will be pay­ing the highest taxes in the nation's history. Even when Western civilization was threatened by Hitler and Tojo, the average percentage paid in taxes didn't climb as high as it has this year. "Excessive tax cuts"? Baloney. Excessive eyewash. 
What the debate is actually all about is not insufficient taxes but shamefully unchecked government spending. The politicians are convinced that the route to endless re-election is through funding everybody's pet project and then so con­fusing people about taxes that they don't realize who is paying for it all. (Hint: Look 

peting successfully  with  the  
Japanese and Germans,"  he  
said.  

Roemer argued that prudent cuts need to be made in the de­fense budget, so more intellec­tual and monetary resources can be diverted to more effi­cient areas of the economy. Ed­ucation is one of the areas he mentioned that would help the economy in the long-term. 
"Our Head Start program re­ceives the same amount of money as it takes to build three Stealth bombers." he said. 
Roemer noted that if less money is spent on defense re­search more can be freed up to

9Ut a wall and made the . that ·continues for at least 
in the mirror.) Which leads us to: 
(3) Because of an "anomaly" in the 1986 law that should rightfully now be repaired, middle-income taxpayers are paying a higher percentage of their incomes in taxes than top earners. 

This one is based solely on congressional trickery. The premise is wholly false. In reality, and as you might ex­pect, the percentage paid in federal taxes is higher for top earners than it is for middle earners. 
The confusion comes from a sneak attack on both mid­dle and upper earners. The 1986 law theoretically established two tax brack­ets: 15 percent and 28 per­cent. Then, on the question­able premise that the bene­fits of the 15-percent bracket should be phased out as incomes rise, the law established a higher, 33-per­cent bite on middle-level in­comes-up to the point when these taxpayers would be paying 28 percent on all their income. No one, in fact, be spent in areas with greater commercial potential. 
"What are our brightest minds doing now? Do we need another MX missile or can we build the best super-collider in the world, or the best super­computer?" he said. 
One student noted that de­fense spending has given the 
U.S. the lead in some critical private sector areas, such as aerospace technology, and per­haps decreasing spending would weaken this particular industry. 
Roemer felt that some cuts would not weaken our lead in these technologies, saying, "We pays more than 28 pnrennt of his total income in federal taxes-and the highest earn­ers are far more likely to be doing so. 
Allegations to the contrary are not just untrue, they're the most blatant form of class-war demagoguery, de­signed to get us mad at "the rich" instead of the politi­cians who are keeping us from becoming so ourselves. 
(4) The long-term trends are dooming America's eco­nomic future. 
In the real world, the once­supposedly-ominous trade deficit has reached its lowest level in five years. The bud­get deficit is coming down, in both percentage and real terms. The American work­ing-age population in the 1990s will be the largest and most productive ever. The n~st of the world, from Moscow to Managua, stands now in open awe-and imi­tation-of the magic power of economic freedom. 
Hope now seems not vain but sensible: The marvelous miracles are greater than the maundering myths.

A serious shopping spree 
The art of bargaining in the Mexican markets, where 'pesos' don't equal dollars 
ROBYN SIMMONS 
accent writer 

Probably one of the most valuable skills you can acquire in Mexico is not the ability to eat spicy food (although is comes in handy,) but the art of regateando, 
a.k.a. "bargaining." 
Mexico is famous for its arts and crafts markets, called mer­cados in Spanish. Different cities are known for their handicrafts: Taxco for silver, Leon for leather, and Oaxaca for blankets just to name a few. Mexico City also has a wide variety of markets that feature everything from handmade blankets and pottery to generic sombreros with "Mexico" stitched on the brim. 
The more touristy a city is the more expensive the items will be. Acapulco for instance is so full of tourists that the Spanish language seems to take a back seat to English. There are plenty of shops and boutiques if you are willing to pay an arm and a leg, so your best bet is to wait until you can find a mercado with fewer gringos and lower prices. 
Just about anywhere in Mexico the vendors will try to overcharge their potential cus­tomers, so it is up to the cus­tomer to get the price down. The key to getting the price down is to speak as much Spanish as possible. In many of the more popular mercados, the vendors are bilingual. If a vendor starts speaking to me in English, I tell them that I wish to speak in Spanish, and all of the sudden the vendor is ready to bring down the price. 
It also helps to hesitate and pretend that you are going to look somewhere where the prices are cheaper. Sometimes the best way to get the price down is to offer to pay a price that is well below the original price and hope to reach a happy medium between the his price and yours. 
Based on personal experience, the best advice that I could give to anyone who is planning on shopping in Mexico is to wait before buying anything. On more than one occasion I have patted myself on the back for getting the price down and making what I thought was a good purchase, only to find the exact same item at another stand for half the price. It is more sensible to check out dif­ferent mercados (if you have the time) before making the final purchase. 
Probably the only place where shoppers cannot bargain is a regular department store. In Mexico, Sanborn's is one of the largest department stores. It and other department stores offers a wide selection of tourist-type gifts and souvenirs, but the handmade arts and crafts found at the mercados are cheaper and more authentic than aT-shirt that says "Greetings from Mexico" in English. 
Another interesting aspect about shopping in Mexico is the number of street vendors in and around the Metro (Mexico City subway system) selling ev­erything from toothpaste and candies to plastic flowers and underwear. The items are sold cheaply (and made cheaply) and the vendors stand by their wares chanting the prices as the Metro travelers walk by. Personally, I am wary about purchasing any type of food from a Metro vendor, but I did buy four Bic pens for only 50 American cents. I have a funny feeling that the vendor did not exactly get permission from the 
Bic company to sell their prod­uct. 
Outside of the larger Metro stations, vendors sell Walkmans, clothes, tapes-just about anything. Sometimes a vendor will get on-board one of the Metro trains and try to sell his product between stops. I have not tried my bargaining skills on any of the Metro vendors yet, because I know that I could get the same product with a warranty back in the States. 
A significant part of Mexico's economy is the tourist industry, so anyone who shops here should feel privileged that they are helping out the country ev­erytime they shell out the pesos to buy something. Looking back on all of the purchases I have made here so far, I think I have made a large contribution to Mexico's economy.

I say ignore the "experts" and root, root, root for your special team while they're still in the race. After all, Peter Gammons and Jimmy the Greek don't know anything more than the rest of us. Last year's stand­ings and stats mean nothing right now, when every team is at 0-0 and tied for first {and last) place. 
Success will ultimately de­pend, not on last year's num­bers, but on how new faces, un­foreseeable injuries and team spirit combine over the next six months. No one can actually tell which combination of play­ers will gel at just the right mo­ments this season, so don't get bogged down with all those numbers. 
After all, have you ever looked back in October to all those April predictions? They usually look pretty silly, some­times downright crazy. 
The best way to approach the upcoming season is to have some fun with it and hone for the best. Ignore the imbeciles who are predicting an A's dy­nasty. Anything can happen. Who knows?

It's not a joke: Musburger 'let go' 
DENVER (AP) -Brent Musburger, the primary voice of CBS Sports during the 1980s, was let go by the net­work Sunday in a move that shocked officials at CBS and other networks. 
Because the move was an­nounced on April Fool's Day and a day before the NCAA basketball championship game -which Musburger still is scheduled to broadcast -many television officials at first dis­missed it as a joke. 
A worker at CBS Sports' stu­dios in New York called The Associated Press insisting the announcement was not true, even while CBS Sports president Neal Pilson was discussing the move at the Final Four in Den­ver. 
"It is not a joke," Pilson said. "It's a difficult decision. It's never easy to deal with individ­uals with whom you have per­sonal or business relation­ships." 
Ted Shaker, executive pro­ducer of CBS Sports, said the network believed Musburger's work load was "too much" and wanted to give its other sportscasters more assign­ments. 
"We have a great group of young broadcasters. They're 
come October. The way the Dodgers will be playing ball this season, you can bet that the most exciting things to happen this year won't involve Pete Rose {pardon the pun) or natural disasters. 
So let's forget about those silly predictions {mine excluded) and let the ball players play ball. And if you happen to be a Mets fan, stay out of my way. The spit in my dorm room is waiting for you. 
our present and our future," 
Shaker said. 
Broadcasting the UNLV-Duke 

game will be the final CBS as­
signment for Musburger, whose 
5 1/2-year contract expires in 
July. 
"I was surprised, but it was a 

great run and I have a million 
memories, and I leave behind a 
lot of good friends," Musburger 
said in a statement read by 
Jimmy Tubbs, his personal 
assistant. "At this time, I'm 
going to take an extended vaca­
tion, and I'll be working again 
someday, somewhere." 
Musburger, who has been with CBS Sports since 1975, was scheduled to become the main voice for CBS' baseball coverage, which begins April 
14. He also was in line to be the host for the network's coverage of the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics. 
Pilson said negotiations for a new contract had been going on for several months between the network and Todd Musburger, who represents his brother. Pil­son said the Musburgers had

asked for a decision by Sunday. 
Both Musburgers were unavailable Sunday but Tubbs, Musburger's assistant for 5 1/2 years, answered questions. 

"It wasn't right out of the blue," Tubbs said. "He knew for a couple of days that things were not going well in contract negotiations. Negotiations had been going on and they just broke off." 
The first hint of the move 
came when CBS spokeswoman 
Susan Kerr read a terse two­
paragraph statement. 
"CBS Sports announced today 
that it had declined to renew 
Brent Musburger's employment 
agreement, which expires 
within the next few months," 
the statement said. "Brent's fi­
nal event for CBS Sports will be 
the NCAA men's championship 
game on Monday, April 2, 
1990." 
Kerr said it wasn't accurate 
to say that Musburger had been 
fired. 
"We just didn't renew his 
contract," she said.

Wisconsin edges ND netters 5-4 
By BOB MITCHELL Sports Writer 
Notre Dame men's tennis has been nothing short of fairy­tale. That is up until yesterday. Head Coach Bob Bayliss wit­
ranked Midwestern team, the Wisconsin Badgers, 5-4 at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
In a match that would have put Notre Dame in the driver's seat for a regional bid to the NCAA Tournament, the Irish dropped four of the five matches that were decided in the third set. 
"Wisconsin just played a little better than us, with the excep­tion of Chuck Coleman," said Bayliss. "We just didn't have it in the third set today. If you add all the games we probably won more than they did but un­fortunately that is not how you add up score in tennis. We didn't play a bad match but we certainly did not play our best match. We stumbled today but we will be back. It doesn't help us with regard to the tourna­ment but there are two ways to get in-a regional bid or in the top 16 in the national polls. " 
As a whole, the Irish truly we not at 100%, but freshman Chuck Coleman, who currently fills the No. 3 singles position, certainly did not miss a beat. Coleman captured the sole three-set victory for the 17th­ranked Irish against top re­gional competitor Joe Deer, 6­7, 6-4, 7-5. 
"In the last two days, Chuck has earned a lot of respect," said Bayliss. "His play was definitely a highlight for our team.Against Deer, Chuck passed and returned serve ex­tremely well. He hit at least 50 passing shots against Deer who is a very aggressive player." 
After singles play the match was knotted at 3-3, and it came down to three doubles contests where the Irish have prospered throughout the entire season. Yet the strength of the Irish

season faltered against the Badgers who took two of the three matchups. 
Notre Dame's No. 1 team, Dave DiLucia and Mike Wallace, earned the fourth point of the match by downing Brian Nelson-Joe Deer in two sets, 7­5, 6-0. However, the No 2 and No. 3 duos found themselves on the short end of the racquet as they fell to the Badger counter­parts. 
At No. 3, Ryan Wenger and Andy Zurkcr were shocked by the brother combination of Dave and Jim Mirzberhger in three sets, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3. With that loss the fate of the Irish was in the hands of Chuck Coleman and Walter Dolhare. And after taking the first set, the No. 2 team slipped in the second and third sets to Jack Waite-Dan Nabedsick, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 and subsequently the Bad­gers became the victors. 
"The No. 2 doubles match was hotly controversial," said Bayliss noting a number of close calls during the match. "We didn't play well at the end of the first set and we just couldn't pick it up enough in the final sets. The loss was a blow, but this team has too much character to let this loss affect us. It was probably the worst time to play, considering we had a match at Miami (Ohio) on Saturday but you have to make the best of the si­tuation. 
Notes: On Saturday. Notre Dame earned their first victory under Coach Bayliss against the Redskins, 5-1. The match was decided before doubles compe­tition, so the teams did not play doubles matches.

Hurley battling illness; teams gear up for final 
DENVER (AP) -Ailing Duke point guard Bobby Hurley was given the usual remedies and was ordered to bed on Sunday in hopes he will be recovered 
for  Monday  night's  NCAA  
championship  game  against  
UNLV.  

Hurley, weak from diarrhea, played 36 minutes but scored only three points in Duke's 97­83 semifinal victory over Arkansas on Saturday. 
"Bobby played sick," Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said Sunday. "We gave him some chicken noodle soup, or·ange juice, got him a humidifier and some medication and told him to go to sleep. We hope he'll be fine by tomorrow. 
"I think it's a combination of the change in climate -it's so much drier here than in North Carolina -and a bit of the bug. I'm sure he's a little ner­vous, too." 
The freshman guard makes Duke's offense go and is aver­aging 9.0 points per game, but he took only two shots against Arkansas. 
"I think he would have shot more, but when you have diar­rhea you worry about jumping up and down," Krzyzewski said. "Bobby gives us a lot of offense without putting the ball in the basket. He handles the ball so much and puts the ball in position to score." 
After watching Hurley against Arkansas, UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian had no idea he was ill. 
''I've seen Bobby on television, but he looks a lot in person than he does on TV," Tark said. "I really like him. But I don't believe if you stop Bobby Hurley, you stop Duke. They're too balanced. He's just one part of it." 
Lois Tarkanian, wife of the UNLV coach, found herself sit­ting in front of an adversary during Mass on Sunday morn­ing. 
"My wife came back to the hotel and yelled at me," Jerry Tarkanian said. "She said Mike (Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski) was sitting right behind her and was praying very hard." 
In keeping with the religious theme, Krzyzewski was asked during a press conference what tournament experience he had gleaned from serving as an as­sistant to Indiana's Bob Knight. 
"I knew I was going to get a disciple question on Sunday," Coach K said. "One of these days I'm going to be an apos­tle." 
Duke and UNLV were taking different practice approaches to the title game. 
Krzyzewski said his Blue Devils would skip practice on Sunday and instead meet in the team hotel. "I feel we need the rest," he said. He planned a leisurely walk-through workout Monday, possibly on an outdoor court near the hotel. 
Tarkanian said UNLV would practice for only one hour of its allotted 90 minutes Sunday. "It won't be real hard," he said. 'Tm sure we have some bumps 

"Tark the Shark,' towel-less this time, looks on as his Runnin' Rebels took advantage of a Georgia Tech 
letdown and advanced to the NCAA Tournament Final against Duke. 
and bruises from last night's game. It's important to keep the legs fresh, but it's also im­portant to do something. We'll shoot free throws for sure." 
Rebel guard Greg Anthony, called "The Senator" by his teammates because of his in­terest in politics, is vice chair­man of the Nevada Young Re­publicans. But his teammates don't share his political views. 
"I haven't converted any of them," Anthony said. "I've given up. They're lost causes." 
The parents of only two UNLV players are in Denver for the Final Four, a situation coach Jerry Tarkanian calls "unfortunate." In most cases. 
it was because the parents couldn't afford to make the trip. 
"We got calls from Xerox and Tony Roma's asking if they could help fly parents in, but we can't do that," Tarkanian said. "That would be a violation." 
Duke's preppie image con­trasts with UNLV's grittier reputation. Not surprisingly, the coaching staffs rarely find themselves recruiting the same type of player. 
"We're in different (recruiting) pools, I think," Duke's Mike Krzyzewski said, "although there are a number of their kids I'd like to have re­cruited. I can't remember me walking out of a recruit's door and Jerry walking in on a visit. Some kids may have had both schools on their list, however." 
"Schools with great aca­demics like a Duke or a Stan­ford have an advantage over us," UNLV's Jerry Tarkanian said. 
"Our '86 team had incredible pressure on it from the first day to the last day. This team wasn't expected to do very much," Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said in comparing his last championship-game team to the current one. 
"Our '86 team was tired throughout March, except for (Johnny) Dawkins and (Tommy) Amaker.

Quarterbacks tested in scrimmage 
Mirer, Kelchner, Poorman all get the chance to air it out 
BY FRANK PASTOR 
Associate Sports Editor 
Lou Holtz expressed great concern over Notre Dame's quarterback situation following Sunday's scrimmage in Notre Dame Stadium, its first of the spring season. 
And concerned he should be. 

For after announcing that he will start whoever can consis­tently put the ball in the end­zone, Holtz watched George Poorman lead the Irish offense downfield for its first score of the day on Sunday. 
Although Rick Mirer and Jake Kelchner saw plenty of action in the scrimmage, it was Poor­man calling the signals when tailback Dorsey Levens swept around right end, fought off several tacklers and out­sprinted the defensive sec­ondary for a 62-yard touch­down run. 
"We don't have a starting quarterback right now," Holtz said. "I look at how many times we put the ball in the endzone, and we've got to make better progress in that area." 
Poorman, who is expected to replace departing Pat Terrell at free safety, began working at quarterback during Saturday's practice to give the Irish a third arm at the position. Walk-on Lamar Guillory, who had been practicing with the Irish quar­terbacks during the first six spring dates, lined up at tail­back in Sunday's scrimmage. 
Raghib "Roc~et" Ismail scored the only other touch­down of the day on an eight­yard run up the middle in a fourth-and-one situation. The score was set up by Mirer com­pletions to tight end Derek Brown for 13 yards and Ismail for nine. 
Mirer, working primarily against the second-team de­fense, completed 13-of-22 passes for 102 yards. Kelchner connected on 8-of-9 attempts for 87 yards but struggled with the option game and was in­volved in a couple of backfield mix ups. 
"Our quarterbacks are young, so we don't have the right chemistry right now," Holtz said. "Rick's done some good things in practice, but it's what's done on the field that counts. 
"Jake threw the ball better today than in practice. He's a tough kid, but he's got to keep improving." 
Frey, Cubs not looking for big trades 
MESA, Ariz. (AP) -General Manager Jim Frey knows the Chicago Cubs have some ques­tions to answer, but it doesn't appear he plans to solve them through major trades. 
"Sure we have some ques­tions, but so do other clubs," Frey said. "I like the spirit of our club and I don't want to change that. We're trying to find out things. It looks like most of the guys are in good shape."
 
Two who aren't are outfielder Andre Dawson and catcher Damon Berryhill. Both are coming back from surgery ­Dawson on his right knee and Berryhill on a shoulder. 
"Dawson's situation has him and us tentative," Frey said. "The doctors seem to think he'll be all right in two or three weeks." 

Counting Poorman's three at­tempts (he completed two for 17 yards), the Irish quarter­backs put the ball in the air 33 times on Sunday, 21 more than the 12 passes per game Tony Rice averaged the past two sea­sons. 
Notre Dame's passing game did not go unchecked, however, as most of the completions were inside the 10-15 yard range. Split end William Pollard led all receivers with three catches for 32 yards. Tight end Derek Brown caught three passes for 29 yards. Ricky Wat­ters also pulled down three passes for 25 yards and Levens had three catches for 22 yards. 
One area that excited Holtz was the hitting displayed by the Irish defense. Rush end Scott Kowalkowski and nose tackle Chris Zorich each recorded sacks, and defensive end Shawn Smith stopped Kelchner short on a fourth-and-one run. 
"The hitting was good," Holtz said. "Our guys really fly around out there. This was not a place for people to test their courage. 
"Let's just say Alice in Won­derland didn't come by here to pick up people for her trip." 

Linebackers Demetrius Du­Bose and Randy Scianna paced the Irish defense with nine tackles apiece. Michael Stone­breaker and drop end Andre Jones each had seven tackles, while Kowalkowski compiled six, including one for a three­yard loss and a sack for minus­10 yards. 
Running backs Levens, Kenny Spears and Rusty Setzer were able to withstand the pounding and take advantage of Culver's absence to tighten the competi­tion at tailback. Levens amassed 108 yards on nine carries, Spears gained 68 yards on 15 attempts and Setzer car­ried the ball 13 times for 54 yards. 
"Levens made some fine plays," Holtz said. "Where we are at quarterback concerns me, but to see Spears, Levens and Setzer run so well is good." 
NOTES: Junior fullbacks Rod Culver (sprained knee) and Walter Boyd (sprained knee and ankle), both injured last week, walked the stadium steps during practice...They were later pressed into service as yardstick movers for the scrimmage.

Bookstore kicks off with Parts Unknown vs. Celebrity All-Stars 
By KEN TYSIAC 
Associate Sports Editor 
Bookstore Basketball XIX got underway Friday afternoon with the Hall of Fame game and continued throughout the weekend as preliminary round action began on Saturday afternoon. 
The Celebrity All-Stars won the Hall of Fame contest by a score of 21-2 in possibly the strangest basketball game ever seen on this campus. While All­Stars Derrick Johnson and Tony Rice were feeding each other alley-oops, their oppo­nents, Mr. Xl, Mr. X2, Mr. X3, Mr. X4 and Mr. X5 of Parts 

Unknown  Weight  Unknown  
fought  back  with  unconven­ 
tional methods.  

Parts Unknown, which wore ski masks and warmed up for the game by dunking oranges through a Nerf hoop, tried to rattle the All-Stars by bringing piglets, a rubber snake and a pizza onto the court. None of this fazed the All-Stars, .who were able to build a big lead and eat some free pizza as well. 

Parts Unknown made a last­ditch attempt at a comeback late in the game. Down 20-2, the masked marauders placed a wooden board over their oppo­nents' offensive goal. When Rice tossed a shot from half­court that knocked the board off the rim, it spelled disaster for Parts Unknown, which drove back to home school Ivy Tech when the game was over. 
Several games went to over­time in the preliminary round, including an intense matchup pitting The Boyz against 4 EEs and a Geek Business Major. Outsized and outmuscled, The Boyz were behind 11-5 at the half but rallied to tie the score at 20. In the end, though, the taller EEs were able to use their size and a 43-20 rebound­ing advantage to secure a 23­21 victory. 
"Our tallest guy was 5-l0, and their guys must have aver­aged 6-2," said the Boyz' Bob Mitchell. "All we could do was pass it around the perimeter and shoot from 30 feet. With four engineers and a business geek as our opponents, we thought we were in good shape, but when we saw them, we thought otherwise." 
Other overtime contests in­cluded a 22-20 victory by The Old&The Injured over Total age 190, Gonna's 22-20 triumph over Scarlet Pumpernickels and a 24-22 win for More Capital T over Jack's Lum_IJsters. 
If You Don't Let Us Win We'll Hit You Really, Really Hard Un­less You Are Bigger Than Us lived up to its name in a 21-12 loss to War Pigs IV: Game Overdue. 
"We didn't get into any vio­lence," explained John Stoj of the losing squad. "They were bigger than we were." 
"It was pretty a pretty brutal game, but we really didn't even breathe hard," said John Brezny of War Pigs, who with tongue planted firmly in cheek insisted that his club is a Sweet 16 caliber team.

lllini game proves to be a washout 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Droplets of rain accumulating into puddles in the infield of Stanley Coveleski Stadium on Saturday night did not bode well for Irish baseball action in the immediate future. 
The rain spoiled the show over the weekend for the Notre Dame baseball team, drowning prospects of a nationally tele­vised game with Illinois on Sat­urday night and a doubleheader with St. Louis on Sunday. 
The only game that escaped

the torrents was the Saturday afternoon contest versus St. Louis, in which the Irish de­feated the Billikens 5-0. 
In the game against Illinois, rain started falling almost with the first pitch. The two teams did manage to make it through the top of the second inning be­fore the game was called. 
"Getting rained out is very frustrating, but it happens to everybody," said Head Coach Pat Murphy. "We just need to stay focused, just roll with it. It just means we have more games to make up now." 
The disappointment at the rainouts was even more acute because the Irish were playing a nationally ranked team on ESPN. They had jumped to a 2­0 lead in the bottom of the first against Illinois, ranked 14th in the nation, but the game was not to be. Rain fell and the Irish lost a great opportunity. 
The games against St. Louis scheduled for Sunday were can­celled because the field condi­tions, due to excessive mois­ture, were unsuitable for play. Both Coveleski and Notre Dame's own Jake Kline Field

UNLV takes on Duke for tournament crown 
DENVER (AP)-It's Nevada­Las Vegas against Duke. Not only will it produce a national basketball champion, but it also could produce one of the highest-s~oring games in Final Four history. 
Between them, UNLV and Duke scored 187 points Satur­day. The NCAA Final Four record for points by two teams in one game is 197 by UCLA 
(108) and Wichita State (89) in 
the 1965 semifinals. Nevada Las-Vegas averaged 
93.2 points per game this sea­son, while Duke averaged 89.3 with a school-record 10 games of 100 or more points. 
Both teams feature big, strong front lines with fine shooting guards that pose 3­point threats. Although UNLV probably tends to run a little more than ·Duke, both teams are capable of pushing the ball up the floor. 
Perhaps the greatest differ­ence between the two teams is Final Four experience. UNLV has been to the Final Four twice, the last time in 1987. Duke has been to eight Final Fours, including the last three and four of the past five. 
"I don't know if we have an advantage because of being in the Final Four, but where our experience comes in is that we've been in tough games all season," Duke coacl\. Mike Krzyzewski said. "Our confer-

Baseball predictors spell doom for some 
The beginning of "Cheers" last Thursday night typifies what many of us will be doing as we approach the upcoming baseball season. 
Occupying their usual spots at the bar, the characters had been giving their expert predictions on who would win the 1990 pennant race when Fra­zier made a critical mistake. 


Chastising his friends who quite nat-By Chris Cooney urally had forecasted a Red Sox title, Assistant Sports Editor Frazier ridiculed them for "completely ignoring statistics, averages and most logic with their Boston chauvinism." 
''I'm going to do something crazy," said Frazier. ''I'm go­ing to go out on a limb and pick the. New Y?rk Yankee~. There! Now I bet I'm the first person m the history of this bar to do that." 
"No," the others replied, "actually, Steve picked the Yan­kees just a few minutes ago. Hey Woody! Is Steve still back there?" 
Woody then proceeded to roll out Steve, who ~as tied _at both his ankles and wrists to some form of torturmg device bearing a slight resemblance to a _spit: As the rest of th_e crew went to grab Frazier, the danng mtellect recanted his bold prediction. 
"Wait! You guys didn't let me finish my sentence!" he screamed. "I meant the Yankees would lose! They'll lose!" 
While roasting Yankee supporters on a spit strikes me as a heck on an idea, I think the scene raises another interesting point. . 
Since it seems that the professional baseball season will actually begin (albeit a week late) next Monday, prognostica­tors all over the country are busy compiling various data in order to preview the upcoming year and successfully deter­mine its champion. When the major publications pick all the same winners, it can get a little disheartening if your fa­vorite team isn't considered a contender. If you're, say, a Chicago White Sox fan, and everyone else is writing them off April 2nd, before the season even begins, you may wonder why you even bother being a fan. You're faced with either

Loch Ness-type monster topples 
'boats in Lake 
For weeks scientists from around the 
world have suspected that a prehistoric 
monster lives in St. Joseph's lake. Now 
with this startling, new, exclusive photo 
obtained by the staffofthe WNDN there 
is positive proofthat such a monster 
exists. 


LIZ AND ELVIS GIVE BIRTH TO 1MONK' IN VEGAS 
Notre Dame was rocked yester­day when Monk Malloy, university president, made his astonishing confession: "I am the love child of Elvis and Liz Taylor!" 
Monk called a news conference to announce his amazing origins after weeks of-controversy, started when Mary Elizabeth Ann Harriet Charlotte Esther Bertha Irving, an investigative reporter for Dialogue magazine, cracked the story. "I just thought that it betrays Notre Dame's rich Catholic heritage to have our president be the sin-stained progeny of an illicit union, especially between pagans like Elvis and Liz Taylor," she said. 
Monk's famous smooth moves and slick style are easy to account for now-apparently he was conceived 
during the filming ofViva Las Vegas! 
"Liz visited the set pretty often, and Elvis and Liz really hit off well-they must have, I guess," said Monk. Liz was able to hide her pre­gency-she was going through one of her famous "fat phases" at the time-and after Monk's birth he was given to a tribe of pygmies hidden deep in the Amazon jungle to raise. 
"Actually, that's how I got the nick­name Monk," Monk admitted. "They're all about 4' 6", and in their language, 'Monk' means 'the really tall, skinny, pale guy with big ears.'" 
Monk's amazing acumen as University President has also been explained-apparently he is regular­ly visited by Elvis' ghost, who gives him advice about University policy! All Monk has to do the summon dear old dad's spirit is rub one of the musical "Fightin' Irish" buttons that plays the fight song. 
In times of great need, Monk goes down to Graceland, to get back to his family roots. "Yeah, people thought that I was visiting alumni associa­tions all around the country, but screw them," said Monk. "All I have to do is set some plastic flowers next to dad's grave, and I feel instantly at peace." 
Now that his secret past has been revealed, Monk will step down as University president and go back to first great love-rock 'n roll! 
"I think I'll call my band 'Rockers in Collars,' with me as the lead accordian player and singer," said Monk. "I've already written a few songs, like 'You Ain't Nothin' but a Pagan,' 'Seminary Rock,' and 'Are You Celibate Tonight?' "

Dialogue Exposes Squirrel Spy Ring 
Don't talk to loudly while feedingthose adorable squirrels, they may be reporting everything you have said back to the Office of Student Affairs. 
Dialogue magazine, well known for their investigative journalism, has uncovered a secret police organization comprised of none other than the squir­rel population. 
Dialogue claims that the squirrels have been reporting on students for years after it uncovered a spy ring locat­ed on South Quad known as "Feed Me." While pretending to be feeding, the mis­chievous creatures have actually been memorizing subversive opinions voiced by outspoken students on campus. 
The squirrels reported back to Fr. Tyson's office by using a vast under­ground network of computers found in the steam tunnels. When asked by Dialogue if he knew anything about the Secret Squirrel organization, Tyson responded, "I think they're nuts." 
Apparently, the squirrels stalked what they claimed to be especially mis­chievous students around campus-even following them back to their dorm rooms

where they observed them from lofty tree branches. They have been known to report after-hours illegal activities to authorities in dorms which have large trees planted near to them. 
The squirrels confronted by Dialogue in the steam tunnels claimed they only wanted to be fed and "to spread peace and love through the Notre Dame com­munity." 
Tyson's office later issued a statement announcing the planting of 60 foot trees outside of Grace and Flanner halls to "beautify that section of the campus." 


Vision forces Trump to donate $40 mil to Notre Dame 
It was announced today that Donald Trump donated $40 million to build a Trump Tower luxury hotel and casino on the new DeBartolo "Mob" Quad. 
"We are happy, in the Year ofthe Family, to accept such a generous donation from a man who represents traditional family values, honor and honesty-in short, everything ND stands for," said University President Father Edward Malloy.

The last smoldering bricks of what used to be the band building give testimony to the power of the alien death ray which razed the building and sucked up scores of horrified onlookers. 
SPACESHIP BLASTS BAND BUILDING 
Band members returned dazed from wild ride 
By Ramses X. Tra 
Hundreds of Notre Dame students frozen in fear stood in awe as theywitnessed the abduction of old band building by aliens from outer space.
Scientists rushed to the scene by a top-secret division of the newlyformed international intelligence group, E.R.E.C.T., were startled by the events at Notre Dame. 
ERECT refused to comment at this time but said it would be holding a press conference later. They did, however, reveal that the spaceship 
was being reclassified from a UFO to a Unidentified Spermicidal Condom 
<USC). 
The recent rash of condom-shaped spaceship sightings prompted to for­mation of the USC category. Researchers said they would have sent the special super-duper, top secret USC investigation team but no one at Notre Dame could identify exactly what the spaceship looked like. 
The shape was, at first, only loose­ly described a long, round, and "sort-of" pointed. Students were unable to correctly identify it until investigators showed them pictures of previous sightings of the condom­shaped craft. Researchers stressed the importance of distinguishing it from other types of long and round UFO's such as the popular vibrator variety. 
Researchers were stunned by the surprising number of students that had never seen a prophylactic before. "It was turning into a sex ed class," doctors said. 
In addition to the spectators sever­al band members were questioned concerning their wild ride around the universe. The aliens inexplica­bly beamed only the tuba section aboard their ship, an action that still has scientsits baffled. 
Tuba players told of conversing with the aliens by playing music on their tubas. "It was right out of Close Encounters," they said. Several noticed Elvis, Mozart, and Beethoven playing tubas with the aliens. 
Musical experts later identified the tune as that of the USC fight song. "Beethoven must have com­posed that crap, the only guy who could like that song would have to be deaf," band members exclaimed. 
In an even stranger twist of events, ERECT was later forced to relin­quish control of the investigation to ND Security. "Now that the Berlin Wall has fallen, their borders are the most secure in the world. Have you ever tried to get on campus with a keg? They're even more secretive

SIAMESE TWINS SEPARATED 
Unnamed, sources have revealed a shock­ing secret about Notre Dame's hottest couple, Father Robert Griffin, C.S.C. and Ann 
Pettifer. While they've been busy oozing sexuality on the dance noor they've also been covering up their past together: Griffin and Pettifer are really Siamese twins, joined at the hip at birth and separated after five agonizing days in the operating theater. Griffin and Pettifer were reunited last fall when they were teamed up as performers of the hot and spicy Lambada dance. Their act won great acclaim from the students-both on and off the dance noor. "There was a kind of telepathy between them, an intimacy that transcended the spoken word. A kind of intimacy that exists between people of one heart, one mind and one 
soul," said Notre Dame stu­dent and diehard Lambada fan Melissa Smith, "And one body, too. I guess there was more to the chemistry between them than met the eye." 
The scandal rocked the Notre Dame campus and shattered the cult of follow­ers the two had gathered. 
"I'm just glad to have it out into the open. These past few weeks have been hell, worrying about whether members of the community, and especially our dear fans, would find out," said Griffin. 
Despite cries of incest, the two were adamant about staying together and facing the music. "We lost so many years together because of our cruel separation that we cannot bear to be apart for another moment," said Pettifer. "Of course we are sorry for the devastation we have wreaked on the num­ber of people who looked up to us as role models and placed their trust in us, but we hope they can under­stand that love transcends all barriers and cannot be denied." 
"Dancing in the face of such adversity will add new depth and unexplored pas­sion to our performance," added Griffin. 
"I don't know what got into them," said University President "Monk" Malloy. "It's bad enough that I have to deal with these fairies in dresses on my administra­tion who scream and run at the sight of a snowball. Now I have to cope with incest? I thought that was the one goddamn thing no one on this campus had tried yet." 
than we are." ERECT sources remarked about the transfer of power. 
Notre Dame Security denied the catastrophe and said that the entire investigation had been turned over to the Office of Student Affairs. "We wouldn't want the truth to get out 'cause that would give Notre Dame a bad name," confided Phil Johnson of ND Security. 
Under pressure from the NEWS, Fr. Tyson held a press conference to explain the situation. "I don't give a sh*% about the band building, all I know is they missed my office by only 200 yards!" Tyson cursed. 
Confidential sources revealed that Tyson has been receiving threats from the aliens for many years and may have been their target. In an effort to provide a getaway in the future, administration sources said that the extra $10 million from NBC would be used as a down payment on a Stealth Fighter.

Zorich to undergo sex change! 
'I've always wa~ted to be a cheerleader' 
The Office of Sports Information confirmed today 
what reporters have been gossiping about for weeks: 
Chris Zorich is undergoing a sex change operation 
by Swedish doctors at the infirmary. 
Zorich, the 6'1" 268 noseguard for the Irish football 
team became bored with his present identity during 
some of the less ex.citing games this year. 
Zorich's extraordinary playing ability has made him a necessary member of the starting lineup for most of the year, but during some of the less strenuous games this .year Zorich got a taste of spectating. Zorich was report­edly never happier than when he enthusiastically cheered on his fellow players during ND's blowout of 
SMU. 

"It was during that [SMU] game that I first got a taste 
of cheerleading, I knew then I wanted to be a ND cheer­
leader, after all the Miami player are the best cheer­
leaders in college football," Zorich said at a press con­
ference on Friday, " and with next year being the Year 
of the Woman and all, I just said why not see what it's 
like." 

The operation, scheduled for sometime next month at 
the infirmary will involve surgery and some "chemical 
changes" doctors say. "We like to call it a simple nip and 
tuck operation," said Edward Van Mannen, a Swedish 
specialist who will assist in the operation. 
Zorich hopes to continue playing for the football team, 
and cheering on the sidelines. " I'd like to play one-half 
out on the field and one-half on the sideline." 
Zorich's coaches see no reason why he can't do both 
next year, although they would obviously like to see 
more of him on the field than off. "Chris has been an 
outstanding contributor to the team this year, and they 
call him the human groundhog, so I guess he can do a 
somersault," said Head Coach Lou Holtz. 
Zorich expressed a desire to change the uniforms of 
the female cheerleaders to a tropical print that would 

Notre Dame siQns million-dollar ESPN deal 
Digger brings in the buCks to keep the basketball team off the air 

ESPN, in what is believed to be the biggest deal of its kind in his­tory, today agreed to pay the Notre Dame basketball program an estimated $35 million over the next five years to guarantee that none of Notre Dame's home games will ever be broadcast on television. 
"We felt it our civic duty to make sure that the nation won't have to watch Notre Dame lose game after game," said ESPN President Joe Smith. 
Controversy has already arisen over the proposed deal. Other mem­bers of the NCAA have protested the decision. In an announcement in Laurence, Kansas, the athletic director of Kansas University threatened to resume the Notre Dame-Kansas basketball contract if the ESPN deal wasn't called off. 
Several members of the NCAA, including DePaul University and Marquette University, said they felt the deal wasn't fair. DePaul head basketball coach Joey Meyer whined, "After all, we're every bit as bad as Notre Dame. Don't we deserve the money?" 
Notre Dame head coach Digger Phelps responded to the new con­tract, saying "Oh, goodie. People don't watch us anyway. At least we'll be able to continue recruiting high-quality players."

history, Notre Dame Security today Tuthill' announced the arrest 
-Rex Rakow

the fabled "Blue Jogger," who had been terrifying female Notre Dame students by touching them inappropriately. 
The identity of the jogger is even more shocking -Kelley Tuthill, former security reporter for The Observer! 
"I can't believe it was Tuthill all along," said Rex Rakow, director of security. Rakow did, however, point out that Tuthill carries a concentration in gender studies. 
"Maybe it was some sort of class project. Or maybe that's just what they're all into over there," Rakow continued. 
Security believes Tuthill may have used the jog­ging suit ploy in order to attract athletic football players who are reputed to make the sophomore's liver quiver. 
Zorro's New Look: A sleek, feminine figure 
expose a cheerleader's stomach "for a better tan line." 
The current cheerleading captain Don Gomez was both excited and mystified by Zorich's desire to join the squad, but claimed there would definitely be room for the popular campus figure. 
"I really am excited about Chris joining the squad. I'm just kind of worried about finding someone to lift and catch him," said Keilleen Phelan the other captain for the 1990-91 cheerleading squad. 
Zorich said Friday that he would be happy to "play the guy cheerleader if no one on the squad was strong enough." 
"The 'Hey, we're going to beat the Heck out of you' cheer might be a little more menacing now with Zorich on the squad," said fellow cheerleader Don Stager. 
Some People Think Gays are Crazy and Like to Wear Dresses 
Who's Crazy? 

Underneath their fool­ish C0stumes is sheer closemindedness. Dangerous closemind­edness. The Administration is wag­ing a campaign of total control over the Notre Dame students. And now they want you on their side. 
Gay people may wear dresses, but we're far less dangerous than the men pictured at left. Will you continue to wage a useless war against us? Or will you join us in saying the administration should "live and let live"? After all, we aren't the only ones in dresses.
