Iraq accepts Bush's offer to hold talks 

WASHINGTON (AP) -Iraq has accepted President Bush's offer to hold talks on the Persian Gulf crisis, the State Department said Wednesday. 
"We are engaged with them on dates and arrangements for the two meetings," the depart­ment said. 
Bush had proposed that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein send his foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, to Washington. Then, Bush said in making the offer last Friday, Secretary of State James Baker would go to Baghdad. 

In Buenos Aires, Argentina, Bush said any talks would be mandated by U.N. Security Council resolutions that have been adopted since the crisis began. 
"That means no concession of territory. That means freedom of innocent people that are held against their will. ... And that means the eventual security and stability of the gulf, although that's not specified by the resolution," Bush said. 
His comments eame before the State Department an­nounced that Iraq had accepted the offer to hold tai~s. 
Baker told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Wednesday that he would not negotiate with Saddam on the trip and added a new warning: "If force must be used, it will be used suddenly, massively and decisively." 
He said his meeting in Baghdad "will not be the begin­ning of a negotiation over the terms of the United Nations resolutions." Nor, Baker said, would he negotiate on subjects

Forum on registration offers answers, but attracts few students 
By MONICA YANT 
Associate News Editor 
If numbers are indieative of how tlw stud(~Jlt body fnels about tlw rngistration process, the attendane1~ at last night's open forum showed the admin­istration one thing: thP.y don't earn. 
Only eight students showed thn administration their con­eern by attending the Student <;overnnwnt-sponsored forum. But to Michael Loux, dnan of tlw Colll~gn of Arts and Letters, tho small number of those eoming out to voice UHlir opin­ion sent a strong message. 
"The unpredictability of this audienee is part of the problem: that it is very diffieult to deter­~ni.~ln wh.at the problem really IS, hll SaHJ. 
Loux was joined by Daniel Winieur, dean of Administration and Hegistrar and Bob Williamson, associate dean of Business Administration to an­swer student questions about the registration process and complications. 
''I'm extremely disppointed with the number of students who showed up," said Rob Pasin, student body president. "We've heard countless com­plaints about registration, yet when we give students the op­portunity to speak to the ad­ministrators directly responsi­ble for the entire system, only eight show up." 
Loux attributed many of the problems within the College of Arts and Letters to the large in­flux of students in the past seven years. Today there are approximately 2800 students in the college, while seven years ago there were around 1500, he said. 
Added to the problems of ov­erenrollment is the fact that the students have flooded two de-
Soviet political problems pose threat to Gorbachev 
MOSCOW (API -A newly formed bloe of conservative and liberal legislators demanded Wednesday that Mikhail Gorbachev impose a statfl of enwrgency and suspend activities of political parties and the parliaments of four re­publics. 
The legislators, calling them­selves the National Salvation Committee, all but called for a military coup to halt the na­tion's slide into chaos. 
"There are many fascist ele­ments emerging in many parts of the country, and this process should be stopped before it is too late," said Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party and a Salvation Committee spokesman. 
But Soviet President Gorbachev's main rival, Boris Yeltsin, expressed fierce oppo­sition on Wednesday to using the military to resolve the coun­try's political and economic cri­sis. He said catastrophe would result. 
The self-declared Salvation Committee includes the hard­line 'Soyuz' group of parlia­mentarians as well as the re­formist Liberal-Democratic Party. 
In asking army help to im­plement its plan and to enforce presidential powers, the group called the military "the sole force still resisting the disinte­gration of the state," the inde­pendent Interfax news agency reported. 
Leaders demanded shifting power to the committee if Gorbachev did not act, Interfax and the state news agency Tass reported.

partments in particular: English and Government. 
As if the disproportionate numbers of English and Gov­ernment majors wasn't enough to affect registration, the Aca­demic Council's decision four years ago to add to University requirements a literature or fine arts class and a history or social science course places more of the burden on these two departments, he said. 
As a result, Loux said that "students have a hard time getting the courses they need to graduate and to get what they want." 
He told the students in atten­dance that the situation will be rectified, but that it will take time. The long-term plan of the University is to add enough faculty to the College of Arts and Letters to the point where all students can be accommo­dated. 
The short-term solution in­volves increasing the number of visiting and part-time profes­sors, as well as increasing the number of courses offered. "We're going to do the best we can to meet the needs of the students," he said. 
The Registrar's office is also trying to meet the needs of stu­dents, according to Winicur. He listened to student suggestions for changes in DART, such as adding more phone lines and a period of polling students to gauge what classes will be most requested. 
Winicur said that the Univer­sity is exploring the possibility of increasing the number of phone lines for DART, but that it is "a matter of money" and technology. 

Suggestions to enlarge exist­ing class sizes are frequent, but not always feasible, according to Winicur. The lack of rooms with enough space to accom­modate large numbers of stu­dents limits the Hegistrar's of­fice from increasing the num­ber of studflnts per class. 
While the completion of the new classroom building in 1992 should provide some relief, Winicur said until then "we don't have very much leeway." 
Winicur explained the differ­ences between the registration process before DART and with DAHT. In the past, the process involved students listing their course selections and a com­puter compilation of how many students wanted each elass. "In most cases, courses were over­subscribed," he said, referring to situations in which 125 stu­

Creativity needed to stop Snowball Fight 
Patricia O'Hara--------­warned us about it. Ann Firth warned us about it. Rob Pasin pleaded with us about it. Fr. Tyson crossed his fingers and hoped it wouldn't snow in 
Portland. John O'Brien 
Despite all of the words and the letters Managing Editor and the threats and the warnings, the annual Snowball Fight took place. In fact, all of the talk served to hype The Fight better than any immature vandal could hope. So, it is obvious that there is going to be a Snowball Fight every year, no matter how hard Prof. O'Hara and Rex Rakow try to stop it. It would appear that the only option now is to try to control The Fight in order to limit the damage to people and property. In my infinite wisdom, I have devised several ways to make the first snowfall so darn fes­tive, no one will want to have a snowball fight. First, there would be Eskimo Lunch. Uni­versity Food Services would give us a gen­uine Arctic lunch, complete with raw fish, Eskimo pies and of course, snow. The din­ing hall workers could run around the place dressed like Eskimos giving out Eskimo kisses and tall mugs filled with whale blub­ber. Be careful. though-avoid the yellow snow-it's not a lemon slushie. University Health Services would encour­age everyone to stop drinking and smoking for one day. That's right, quit-cold turkey. Yuk, Yuk, Yuk (Get it? Cold turkey.) Student Government could organize a massive group of carollers that would go from dorm to dorm singing festive yuletide musical selections. "The Dillon Fight Song," however, would be notably absent from the playlist. Support Services would try to increase awareness as to who the chick on top of the 
Dome really is. They would add a Santa 
Claus suit and wig and prove that she is ac­tually Mrs. Claus. 
Monk Malloy, noticing he has a striking resemblance to Herbie the Elf from "Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer," would ice-skate across the frozen tundra of St. Mary's Lake singing "I'm such a misfit ... " 
The Student Union Board could sponsor a contest to see who can cross-country ski from Club 23 to Commons without getting the crap beaten out of them. No one would win. 
The women of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's would show that they, too are feel­ing the yuletide spirit of giving and give the Blue Jogger a festive kick in the crotch. 
Of course, all of my festive ideas could fall on deaf ears and the student body might re­sort to the traditional zaniness of the Snowball Fight. The only thing the Adminis­tration can do about it then is clear: collec­tively punish the entire Student Body. Why not? It worked so well last year.

African altitudes toward art and education have been dras­tically changed by European colonization, according to a panel discussion by a group of native Africans from the Notre Dame and South Bend commu­nities. 
Professor Sylvester Jbuot of IUSB spoke of how attitudes toward artwork have been changed by colonization. "Before colonization, people looked at art as a representative of God on earth," he said, "which united the ptlople." 
This unity was compromised with the onset of <~olonization. Because Europeans felt that the art was abnormal and sacrile­gious, "Africans began to look differently at the art, causing disunity." As a result, many pieces of art were destroyed. 
Educationally, colonization caused far more drastic results, said Guillaume Zoumlome, an ND graduattl studnnt and native of Senegal. Previously, education was informal "in the sensn that it is a lived experience, a fundamental nlement of cultural growth and sodaI activity." 
With colonization, wnstnrn nwthods rnplaced native tech­niqtws. Edur.ation became more formal. "removing students

from native traditions and so­ciety," said Zoumlome. 
This created a duality be­tween what was learned in the home and what was learned formally in school. "This causes ambivalence and internal stress," he said. 
Additionally, the actual sub­ject matter being taught changed with colonization. Motivated by a desire to domi­nate the beliefs of the individual and replace them with ones that furthered the colonization process, "westernized education taught African children just enough to make them useful." Zoumlome stated. 
The discussion group was headed by Christophe Kougniazonde, president of the Notre Dame African Students Association. He called for "Reforms in African education with a movement which reaches back to cultural roots." 
Today, a middle ground be­tween native culture and west­ern ideas has been achieved. Zoumlome stressed that, "While western technology is needed to benefit the countries, it is impossible to do away with African values." 
The panel met in the O'Shaugnessy Art Gallery, in conjunction with an exhibit of African sculpture, which opened Monday. The exhibit runs through December 30th.

United Nations discusses resolution 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -The Palestine Liberation Organization on Wednesday urged the Security Council to send U.N. staff to the Israel­occupied territories to help protect Palestinians. 
The United States, however, could veto any resolution calling for deployment of U.N. per­sonnel, appointment of an om­budsman or convening of an in­ternational human rights con­vention to help the Palestinians. 
Negotiations were continuing in efforts to devise a draft reso­lution that could be adopted by consensus, or avert a U.S. veto in defense of its Israeli ally. 
Soviet Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov told reporters he did not expect a veto but declined to discuss details of a possible consensus resolution. The council was to meet against Thursday and could vote on a resolution ·on protecting Palestinians. 
"I don't think there should be any question of a veto because we are working differently now ... on a consensus basis and that's a sign of the times." 
After more than three months of close cooperation and con­

sensus, he said, "the council now is not interested in scoring points or in passing resolutions that will be vetoed by the other members." 

The Soviet envoy commented after informal consultations among the five permanent members, including the United States, Britain, China and France. He said the council was "not interested in the resolu­tions, we are interested in so­lutions." 
Earlier Farouk Kaddoumi, the PLO foreign affairs spokesman, told the Security Council that it had a moral obligation to protect Palestinians from what he called Israeli crimes, like the shooting deaths of at least 19 Palestinians on Temple Mount on Oct. 8. 
He told the 15-member coun­cil that the United Nations should do no less for Palestinians under Israeli occu­pation than it has done for Kuwaitis under Iraqi occupa­tion. 
"We call upon your august council to establish a perma­nent presence of the United Nations and its personnel in the occupied Palestinian territories, 
r~:ltJpm fi£,~VH-OU0E:-MAU, 
in the context of an established mechanism, based on monitor­ing the situation and submitting periodic reports." 
His speech was delivered as the council continued an inter­mittent month-long debate about how to help safeguard the rights of Palestinians in the Israeli-held territories. 
lie also blamed the United States for protecting Israel "and its criminal practices." lie said that the contradiction between council actions in the casH of Kuwaitis under occupation and its inaction in the case of Palestinians "has come to jeopardize its credibility and prestige and to cast doubt on its potential to play its nCJquired role in our new world." 
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar told reporters Wednesday that he intends to send his special envoy, Jean­Claude Aime, to Israel to discuss the Palestinian problem after the council concludes its debate this week. 
Several draft resolutions cur­rently are in circulation and United States is meeting with various council members in an effort to find an acceptable resolution.

With over two weeks until the end of the semester, Loux re­ported that the College needs to find approximately 1200 spots, but that 2600 spaces are still available. 
While Loux acknowledged that students will not automat­ically take the spaces that are available, he said that the opening of new sections of classes and process of dropping and adding should help the sit­uation. 
Loux alluded to the "ten to two phenomenon" as a possible cause of many registration problems. Although he "made efforts to convince department chairs to offer courses at other times" than between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., those courses at "8 and 9 a.m. and 3 and 4 p.m. are still open." 
"The 'ten to two phenomenon' isn't just a faculty idiosyncrasy," he said, "it's students, too." If all students attempt to make their schedules between those hours, "it's going to be hard to get anything," he concluded. 
Diligence is perhaps the best defense for students having dif­ficulty registering for their classes, according to Loux. Although new sections of classes are being added and ex­isting class sizes are being in­creased, students "have got to be perseverate," he said. 
Approaching department heads for exemptions and con­tinuing to attempt to DART classes are just two options for students who are still facing in­complete schedules, according to Loux.

responsibility or we should find an alternative," said Vladimir Voronin, leader of the Sakharov Democratic Union and a committee member. 
He said in a telephone inter­view that the committee wanted a "strengthening of presidential power." 
"Once the state of emergency is introduced, everything will calm down at once," Voronin said. "I know those democrats -they will run away at once. It will be more difficult to pacify them when they accumulate too many weapons." 
The group wants suspension of the parliaments of Lithuania, Moldavia, Georgia and Russia, because they are seen as the strongest challenge to the cen­tral government, Zhirinovsky said in a telephone interview. 
Other committee members seemed inclined to suspend all legislative bodies. 
"If presidential decrees are not obeyed in a region, that re­gion's representative bodies should be dissolved, and a plenipotentiary representative of the central government should be sent to replace it," said Voronin. 
The Lithuanian parliament declared independence on March 11 and the newly elected non-Communist parliament of Georgia is moving in that direc­tion. Moldavia is split among opposing ethnic groups.

Daily News files lawsuit against striking workers 

NEW YORK (AP) -The Daily News filed $100,000 lawsuits Wednesday against eight people who face criminal charges of blocking the tabloid's distribu­tion. 
Among those sued was Joseph Martin, a truck driver for The New York Times who allegedly smashed his truck into a News vehicle driven by a replacement worker Nov. 3. 
The lawsuit alleged the re­placement driver suffered se­vere injuries in a subsequent assault by Martin. 
Theodore Kheel, spokesman for nine News unions that have been on strike for six weeks, called the lawsuits unfounded. He said the unions will chal­lenge them.

13HUSSELS. Belgium (AP) ­Negotiators involved in 107 -na­tion free trade talks reported failure Wednesday in their ef­forts to resolve a nasty fight over farm subsidies with some trade ministers suggesting the discussions are on the verge of brPaking down. 
"It is a stah~mate and it is se­rious," said a grim-faced U.S. TradP Hepresentative Carla llills. 
Oflidals said there would be anotlwr effort at a break­through Thursday. 
"High noun is tomorrow (Thursday)." said Canadian Trade Minister John Crobie. "If there is no change, then it is 
OVf~r." 
Thr. trade ministers emerged just before midnight from a two-hour meeting in which they sought in vain for a compromise position on the expensive subsidies that developed coun­trir.s pay to their farmers. 
An Indian official. Commerce Minister Subramanian Swamy, was pessimistic, saying, "It looks like they are heading for suspension." 
If the talks are broken off, even for a brief time, it would put the entire four-year effort at trade reform in jeopardy be­cause of the tight deadlines ne­gotiators had faced to submit a completed document to the U.S. Congress. 
The dispute pitted the 12-na­tion European Community against much of the rest of the world, including large farm ex­porters such as the United States. Brazil and Argentina. 
European officials had been expected Wednesday to agree to at least a modest expansion of their offer to reduce internal farm support payments by 30 percent. 
Instead, the Europeans emerged from their separate meeting saying they had de­cided to make no further offer

on farm subsidies until the United States made compro­mises on other issues. 
There had also been hope that the European position might change as a result of a meeting Wednesday night in Paris between German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand. 
But following that discussion, no new offer was announced. 
Crosbie described the mood inside the discussions as "somber" and said the meeting Thursday would determine whether there was any point in continuing the talks. 
"We are going to have to de­cide whether we are going to give it all up or not." he said. 
The farm subsidy fight evolved as the biggest stum­bling block to conclusion of the most ambitious round of trade liberalization talks ever under­taken. The negotiations, known as the Uruguay Round for the country where they began in 1986, had been scheduled to wrap up Friday after five days of marathon bargaining. 
But after three days the talks remained stalemated and some delegations talked openly about the possibility of giving up and going home. 

"The United States has got to recognize that this is a negotia­tion between equals, not a group of people to be pushed around in this way," said British Agriculture Secretary John Gummer. 
Otto Schlecht, Germany's deputy economics minister, said. "We have no reason to go to the Americans on our knees." 
Gummer said the Europeans had insisted on American com­promise offers in areas includ­ing trade in services, textiles and investment to be made at the same time that discussions went forward on the farm issue. 
He  said  the  U.S.  side  had  
rejected that proposa l.  
U.S.  officials  said  the  

Europeans were engaging in a desperate attempt to shift the blame for failure of the negoti­ations. 
"What is holding up the ne­gotiations here is that the European Community has not yet provided a proposal on agriculture," U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said. 
The European Community en­tered the negotiations offering to trim domestic farm support payments by 30 percent. The United States, supported by major farm exporting countries,

was seeking much deeper cuts of 75 percent in domestic supports and import barriers and a 90 percent cut in export subsidies. 
The trade talks, the eighth in a series of negotiations dating to 1947, offered the promise of lowering prices for consumers while at the same time boosting economic prosperity, especially in Third World countries with farm-based eeonomies. 
The United States has argued that without sufficient progress in agriculture, developed na­tions will not be able to win concessions from Third World countries to reform their trade practices including agreement on tough new rules to protect against copyright piracy, some­thing that costs American busi­nesses an estimated $60 billion in lost sales annually. 
Negotiators spoke pessimisti­cally about a failure of the talks, which many fear could trigger a rise of protectionism and global trade wars. similar to the events of the 1930s that were blamed for making the Great OPpression more severe. 
"Anyone who does not admit that the round is in deep crisis is just deluding themselves," said Australian Trade Minister Neal Blewett.

Earthquake fears begin to subside 
ST. LOUIS (AP) -Most stu­dents and teachers in the New Madrid Fault region were back in classrooms Wednesday after a two-day earthquake break called by officials responding to a scientist's prediction. 
New Mexico scientist Iben Browning projected a 50 per­cent chance for a major earthquake this week along the fault, which runs from Cairo, Ill., to Marked Tree, Ark. 
Earthquake experts scoffed at Browning's projection, which he based on tidal forces, but school officials throughout southeast Missouri and parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and Indiana canceled classes. 
Some school districts that did not cancel classes reported ab­sentee rates as high as 50 per­cent Monday. 
Things were pretty much back to normal Wednesday and most students were back in school. But Missouri's Scott County Central School District didn't plan to re-open until Thursday. 
"When you're going to have problems with your attendance, you might as well not have school," said Superintendent Ray Shoaf. 
Dick Hilburn, assistant super­intendent of schools in Kennett, said he didn't notice any linger­ing earthquake fears Wednesday. 
"If there are, I can't tell it," he said. "From what I can tell, things are going about like normal. Attendance is almost normal at the high school, which I think is a pretty good gauge." 
Some school officials blamed the media for exaggerating the earthquake scare. 
"I think they got snowed," Jim Mauk, business manager for the New Madrid County Schools, said of the media. "Browning made the projection, but he's not the one who hyped

Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., urged Baker at today's hearing to provide Saddam Hussein with "a way out" of the crisis. He suggested one approach would be to propose the World Court resolve Iraq's territorial claims against Kuwait. 
"If at all possible, make that a meaningful trip," Simon urged. 
Baker stressed that the U.N. resolution did not require. the United States to attack Jan. 15 or a day after. Without elabo­ration, Baker said diplomatic steps were being taken in the search for a peaceful solution. 
However, Baker insisted that Iraq must withdraw from all of Kuwait, liberate all foreign hostages and permit the restoration of the ousted gov­ernment. 
Bush, in making the offer to swap envoys, said Baker would not waver from the three de­mands. 
"The best way to get that across is one-on-one, Baker looking him in the eye," Bush said.

Marines discharge soldier who refused Operation Desert Shield deployment 
HONOLULU (AP) -The first Marine to refuse deployment under Operation Desert Shield was granted an administrative discharge Wednesday, Marine Corps officials announced. 
Court martial proceedings against the Marine, Jeff Paterson, were dismissed under the agreement. In return, Paterson will halt all legal ac­tion against the Corps stemming from its rejection of his request for conscientious objector status, said a military spokesman and Paterson's at­torney. 
Paterson had his rank re­duced from corporal to lance corporal under the agreement. 
In another disputn, a soldier whosn active-duty nnlistmont was extnnded without his con­sent because of the Persian Gulf crisis filed suit Wednnsday against President Bush and Army officials for breach of eon tract. 
Thn four-ynar activH-duty tour of Spnc. Sebastian Correa was to havn nnded Nov. 24. In early Septembnr h1~ was asked if he wanted to re-enlist; he declined. Two weeks later, Correa was sent to Saudi Arabia, and two weeks aftHr that he learned his tour was extended until December 1991. 
Paterson. 22, was accused of violating ordPrs following his rllfusal to board a plane for Saudi Arabia with his unit Aug. 
29. He also was charged with unauthorized absence Aug. 16, when he failed to report for duty. 
The Marines rejected his re­quest for objector status, saying it was based on political rather than moral considerations, saying they thought Paterson didn't oppose war in all forms and wasn't sincere in his beliefs. 
A statement issued Wednesday from Paterson's commanding officer at the Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station, Brig. Gen. Phillips, said it would be too disruptive and time-consuming to have officers deployed in Saudi Arabia give depositions in the Paterson case. Phillips also said he was satisfied that Paterson had admitted guilt in his dismissal request and that all lawsuits would be dropped. 
Paterson's attorney, Eric Seitz, said, "The government had legal concerns about what the outcome would be. The case has been a source of publicity and great embarrassment to the miiitary." 
Correa's tour was extended under a military program known as "stop-loss," intended to maintain troop strength during Operation Desert Shield. 
"We have researched the law thoroughly and we feel an au­tomatic extension can only be 
00. 

enforced when Congress has declared war or the president has declared a national emer­gency," Correa's attorney, Ellis Rubin, said before filing the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Miami. 
Defense Department spokesman Maj. Doug Hart cited a code section that over­rules all others and specifies that the president can suspend laws regarding separation as the basis of the Army's stop-loss program. 
Rubin said his client has a satisfactory service record and isn't seeking to leave the Army, just to change his status. 
Correa, 24, is an auto me­chanic with the 18th Aviation Brigade based at Fort Bragg, 
N.C. The lawsuit maintains his services aren't essential to the success of Desert Shield. 
In two other conscientious objector cases: 
-Pvt. Alfred Edwin Esquibel Jr., who refused to carry a gun to Saudi Arabia, was discharged Tuesday from the Army on grounds of fraudulent enlistment, said Bill Harralson, Army spokesman at Fort Campbell, Ky. He said Esquibel committed fraud when he joined the Army in January 1989 and indicated he was not a conscientious objector. Esquibel later filed for consci­entious objector status.

about nuclear power. 
Although they did little initial research, he said the "Simpsons" creators seemed to accurately represent worker conditions -the cafeterias, lunch pails and radiation warning signs. The writers placed Homer in a "sector" to illustrate an impersonal bu­reaucracy, then discovered some plants actually used that term. 
But Simon also said the tour also "changed a lot of peoples' minds. I think the facts are pretty powerful that it's a clean and safe and important source of energy. While some of the shows were in the works be­fore, we really backed off that as a source of comedy. No more three-eyed fish." 
But don't have a cow, Simpsons fans. 
The show will continue to jab the industry in its third season next year, but in a more re­sponsible way, Simon said. 
For example, Homer is to be­gin a dinner grace with this: "Thank you for nuclear power, which has yet to cause a single fatality at least in this coun­

try." Plans even call for Homer to avert a nuclear meltdown. 
"He's kind of asleep at the wheel and wakes up when there's an alarm, and doesn't know which button to press, so he goes eeney-meeney-miney­mo and hits a button and does avert a meltdown," Simon said.

WASHINGTON (AP) -The nuclear power industry is hav­ing a meltdown over "The Sirnpsons." 
The prime-time cartoon show's evil power-plant owner with overbite. the dozing em­ployees and a three-eyed fish named Blinky all have con­tributed to driving industry of­ficials into a critical mass. But more than anything, Homer Simpson has them glowing un­der the collar. 
The U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, an industry infor-

mation group, told the "Simpsons" producers in a February letter it was horrified to see nuclear plant workers portrayed as "bungling idiots." 
Top "idiot" on the council's list was Homer, father of the Simpson family and an em­ployee of the fictitious Springfield nuclear plant. Homer, perpetually in need of a shave, seems to care less about safety than about naps, dough­nuts and having enough tartar sauce for his fish sticks.

In various episodes, Homer gives away the plant's blueprints to a foreign exchange student, his boss tries to bribe a plant inspector with a bushel of cash, and three-eyed "Blinky" is found swimming near the plant. 
"I am sorry that the Simpsons has offended a lot of people in the energy industry," Executive Producer Sam Simon said in a Feb. 5 letter to Carl Goldstein, a vice president of energy group. "I agree with you that in real life Homer Simpson would not be employed at a nuclear power plant. 
"On the other hand, he prob­ably wouldn't be employed anywhere." 
After they exchanged a few more letters, Simon finally sug­gested he and other Fox Broadcasting Co. executives tour a real nuclear power plant. 
"We had no illusion that this was suddenly going to turn 'The Simpsons' into anything resembling real life, and it hasn't," Goldstein said. "But they were interested." 
In April, the group converged on the San Onofre nuclear power plant in San Clemente, Calif., 40 miles south of the Fox Los Angeles offices. 
"We don't have any Homers at our nuclear plant," said David Barron, a spokesman for San Onofre's owner, Southern California Edison, who accom­panied the producers and writ­ers. 
Simon said the tour showed that "The Simpsons" had been

Baby boomers in temporary slump 
NEW YORK (AP) -It is diffi­cult to convince someone whose house has been on the market for a year at progressively lower prices that, yes, there is still a market out there. 
Potential buyers are out there, say demographers, those folks who analyze population statistics and make projections from them. And when the mix of economic elements is right, they say, those buyers may spring into action. 
The explanation lies in a fur­ther examination of the baby boom generation that followed World War II, which some marketing people assume has by now made most of its biggest purchases, such as cars and homes. 
But, others now say, some of that bulge of youngsters hasn't completed its purchases, espe­cially homes. 
The initial impact of boomers had explosive results for hous­ing. In 1976, the total value of existing homes sold was $96.6 billion. Four years later, the value was $245.7 billion. 
Glenn Crellin, an economist with the National Association of Realtors, has traced the trail left since then as the boomers worked their way through the economy. 
The boomers were hurt by the two recessions in the first three years of the 1980s, but then came back strongly. Despite the recessions, more than 30.3 mil­lion units were sold in the decade, 11 percent more than in the 1970s. 
Prices rose even more. The median leaped from $55,700 in 1979 to $93,100 in 1989, and in many areas the appreciation was at a rate of 20 percent a year for a few years. Some houses tripled in price, some even quadrupled. 
A consequence of this was that some baby boomers were priced out of the market, but not permanently. Some still wait for the proper time: lower interest rates, lower prices and a better economic outlook. 
That's one part of the poten­tial market, but still another tends to be overlooked. 
In its entirely, the baby boom era lasted almost two decades, from 1946 to 1964, but as Crellin points out, it came in two distinctly different waves. 
In the first, which lasted 10 years from 1946 to 1955, births jumped from about 2.9 million a year to more than 4 million. As that part of the boom worked it ways through the economy it was easily traced and highly publicized. 
The second wave, which lasted nine years, was not as dramatic. The number of births no longer rose, but it seldom fell either. Births plateaued at a very high level, between 4.1 million and 4.3 million a year. 
Years later the two waves had this effect on housing: 
The first produced a sudden rise in household formation, which often can be equated with housing demand. It was very, very noticeable. The sec­ond produced no sudden de­mand, but it maintained de­mand at an extremely high level. 
Coors hits Indiana markets 
GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) Coors beer will be sold in Indiana for the first time early next year, the company says. 
Indiana will be the 50th and final state targeted for market expansion by the na­tion's third-largest brewer. 
"It's always been our pol­icy to expand Coors' market­ing territory only as rapidly as our brewing and packag­ing capabilities allowed," said Terry Nauslar, director of field marketing for Coors Brewing Co. .··. "With substantial capital itivijstments in our Golden. Shenandoah and Memphis operations during 1990, we believe we're now much bet­ter-equipped to meet the de­mand for our products by 
Indiana  consumers,"  he  
said.

Pennsylvania and Delaware, in 1988.

Cotton Bowl may decide national championship 
NEW YORK (AP) -Jim Brock got an early Christmas present this year -a Cotton Bowl that could produce the national champion. 
After years of drab games and declining television ratings, the Cotton Bowl landed a mar­quee matchup between third­ranked Texas and No. 4 Miami. If top-ranked Colorado and No. 2 Georgia Tech lose on New Year's Day, the Cotton could have its first national champion in 12 years. 
"I'd rather be lucky than good, and this year we were lucky," says Brock, the bowl's executive vice president. "Everything has fallen into place for us." 
Miami would have preferred to play Colorado in the Orange Bowl because that would have given the Hurricanes a clearer

HOUSTON (AP) -One of four defensive players, including 1989 finalist Chris Zorich of Notre Dame and Indianapolis native Moe Gardner of Illinois, will be named the winner of the 1990 Lombardi Award Thursday night as the nation's top collegiate lineman. 
Joining Zorich, who lost out last year to Michigan State linebacker Percy Snow, and Gardner are David Rocker of Auburn and Russell Maryland of Miami. 
Zorich. a 6-1. 266-pound nose tackle, had 57 tackles three sacks and 11 tackles for losses for the Fighting Irish this season and was named first team All-America for the second straight year. 
Gardner, 6-2, 258, missed the final game of the season against Northwestern with a fractured forearm but still registered 50 years at Miami. 
Although pro scouts projected Maryland as a first-round choice if he decided to enter the draft last spring, he chose to

COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -Darren Lewis didn't win the Heisman Trophy, but he did become a footnote to the sto­ried history of the award. 
He's college football's only 5,000-yard rusher who didn't win the coveted trophy. 
Lewis became the fifth 5,000­yard rusher in NCAA history in Saturday's 28-27 loss to No. 3 Texas, but he wasn't even in­vited to New York to participate in the Heisman Trophy presentation. 
Instead, he sat in front of his television and watched Brigham Young's Ty Detmer win the 1990 honor. Lewis finished ninth in the voting. 
"They made a good choice," Lewis said. "I went out and gave 110 percent and left it all on the field, so I am satisfied. I had a couple of bad games that probably hurt me. In the Heisman watch, one bad game can really hurt you." 
Lewis could take some solace in earning The Associated Press' All-America first team honors for the second time in his career. He was a first team pick as a sophomore when he gained 1,692 yards. He over­came a slow start in 1989 and gained 961 yards as a junior. 
Lewis has a chance Dec. 29 to 

the Holiday Bowl. But Lewis says he'll pass on the opportunity. 
"The Reisman voting is al­ready over and I give Ty Detmer all the credit he de­serves," Lewis said. "You have to play each game the best you can. 
"Just because we're playing against Ty Detmer it doesn't mean I'll try to open people's eyes and make them say 'This should have been the man.' I'll just play as hard as I can and let it go." 
Lewis wrote himself into the A&M and Southwest Conference record books in the season finale against Texas. Playing despite a bruised shoulder suffered in the second quarter, Lewis gained 150 yards on 25 carries and scored onJouchdown runs of 17, 12 an 31 yards in his final regular season game, giving him an SWC record 5,012 career rushing yards.

tackles, broke up eight passes. blocked a kick and got one sack. 
Rocker. whose brother Tracy won the 1988 award, had 75 tackles, seven sacks and six tackles for losses for Auburn this season. Rocker headed an Auburn defense that ranked No. 8 in the nation in total de­fense, allowing 272.9 yards per game. 
Maryland. 6-2, 273, led the Hurricane defense that ranked third in the nation against the rush, allowing 79.7 yards per game. He had 86 tackles and 10 sacks and was named to the All-America team.

and now is taking graduate courses in psychology, probably will benefit financially from remaining in school. He's been projected by a number of NFL scouts and general managers as a top-five pick next spring. Winning the Outland certainly provides him another bargain­ing chip. 
When he was given the tro­phy, Maryland, slightly choked with emotion, thanked his par­ents, coaches and a long list of others and said, "My freshman year, I never would have imag­ined I could come this far." 
A pudgy 317-pounder when he came out of Young High School in Chicago, Maryland initially made just one recruit­ing visit and got just one schol­arship offer -from Indiana 
State. 

But Miami stepped in late after a couple of recruits couldn't meet admission stan­dards and offered a scholar­ship. 
"When I first got to Miami, I just wanted to make an impact on the program. They (the Miami coaches) wanted me to lose weight and build up mus­cle," Maryland recalled, smil­ing. 
A soft-spoken, articulate player considered a leader by his teammates, Maryland was tagged "The Conscience." 
"I think he invented right and wrong. If you do something wrong, he's the guy who's going to scold you," Miami offensive tackle Mike Sullivan once said. 
"I guess I'm an ever-present, conscience kind of guy," Maryland said. "I always get after them (his teammates)."

attend the meeting, along with Phoenix mayor Paul Johnson, Tempe mayor Harry Mitchell, Phoenix City Council member Skip Rimza, Maricopa County supervisor Jim Bruner and a representative of the Phoenix Super Bowl '93 committee. 
"The notion was that it would be a good idea for Dennis to arrange such a meeting," Maynes said. "He's got a per­sonal relationship with Tagliabue." 
Maynes said the purpose of the meeting was to allow Arizonans to "share informa­tion with the NFL." Maynes de­clined to say where the meeting would be held, except that it will be at the Capitol in Washington and not in DeConcini's office. He said it would be private. 
Maynes said DeConcini's own position on the Super Bowl .is that he "always had the posi­tion that we should have a King Day and he obviously would like to see the Super Bowl retained in Arizona." 
NFL team owners are ex­pected to decide in March whether to move the 1993 Super Bowl. It is considered likely that they will follow Tagliabue's recommendation. 
Asked if there was any indica­tion that Tagliabue might change his opinion about mov­ing the Super Bowl, Maynes said, "I wouldn't begin to try and answer that one." 
Local officials have said the Phoenix area stands to lose about $200 million if the game is moved. 
In Washington, Assistant Education Secretary for Civil Rights Michael Williams said the Fiesta Bowl's offer may lead to discriminatory financial aid at the participating schools. 
Louisville and Alabama ac­cepted bids to the New Year's Day bowl game in Tempe, Ariz., despite protests at both schools. 
Fiesta Bowl executive director John Junker said an extra $100,000 would be added to each school's $2.5 million award from the bowl and would be earmarked for a minority scholarship fund or to endow a chair for minority students. 
"I commend your efforts at advancing minority opportuni­ties in education," Williams said in a letter to Junker.

Big trades rock baseball talks Purdue's Hunter cleared of 
Blue Jays, Padres, Mets, Twins and Giants deal wildly rape charge, may transfer 
ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -Tony Fernandez, Joe Carter, Fred McGriff and Roberto Alomar got traded in baseball's biggest deal in years, the New York Mets finally caught Vince Coleman and George Steinbrenner ripped commissioner Fay Vincent on Wednesday for the free agent that got away. 
On the day when owners ap­proved in principle a collusion settlement that will cost $280 million and set Gary Gaetti, Brett Butler and 13 others free, Toronto and San Diego pulled a stunner\at the winter meetings. 
In a move that came so sud­denly that it caused gasps when it was announced, the Blue Jays sent Fernandez and McGriff to San Diego for Carter and Alomar in a deal for four of baseball's best players.. 
"We thought we'd give you an old-fashioned baseball trade," new Padres general manager Joe Mcilvaine gleamed. "We're trading four All-Stars. It was kind of a gutsy trade on both ends." 
Toronto general manager Pat Gillick, once nicknamed "Stand Pat" because he never did made moves, agreed. 
"We don't make too many trades like this these days," he said, smiling and shaking his head. ''I'm sure it will be ana­lyzed from all angle." 
The impact: Carter, who has averaged more than 100 RBis for five years, will move into an outfield that expects to lose free agent George Bell, possibly to the Chicago Cubs. Alomar, 22, will fill Toronto's search for an all-around second baseman. 
McGriff, with 105 home runs in the last three seasons, will take over first base, a position that might soon be vacant when Jack Clark becomes a "new­look" free agent. Fernandez, 28, will replace Garry Templeton at shortstop. 
The irony: at last year's meetings, Carter was traded by Cleveland for Sandy Alomar Jr., the eventual rookie of the year; this time, Carter was traded with Alomar's brother. 
Meanwhile, other dominoes began to tumble. 
The San Francisco Giants, a day after signing Dave Righetti and shocking Steinbrenner, traded reliever Steve Bedrosian to Minnesota. Pittsburgh's championship pie again got sliced as first baseman Sid Bream signed with Atlanta. That cleared the way for Franklin Stubbs, who was con­sidering the Braves, to go to Milwaukee. 
Bill Doran decided to stay at home in Cincinnati. But Pat Tabler, baseball's best bases­loaded hitter, left the Mets for Toronto. And Tony Bernazard continued a recent trend of players returning from Japan and signing with Detroit. 
The flurry will likely last long beyond Wednesday's official end of the meetings. That's be­cause at high noon, owners agreed to settle three collusion cases -it will cost each club about $10.77 million and make Gaetti, Clark Butler, Dave Smith, Jack Morris, Danny Darwin and others "new-look" free agents. The players' union must also approve, and most everything could be set in a few days. 
The owners' vote was 25-1. Montreal's Charles Bronfman, in the process of selling the Expos, was the lone dissenter. His objection came a day after he made an impassioned plea to owners to stop the salary spi­ral. 
But an owner who wasn't at the meetings made the most noise by railing against a commissioner who wasn't there, either. 

Steinbrenner blamed Vincent -at home recuperating from a respiratory illness -for Righetti's escape from the Bronx, saying his worst fears had become a reality. Last summer, Vincent forced Steinbrenner to give up daily control of the New York Yankees; in September, Vincent denied Steinbrenner permission to handle free-agent talks. 
"If I were involved, this never would've happened. If I'm there, he doesn't get away," Steinbrenner said in New York. "I don't think this had to hap­pen." 
The Mets, though, felt they had to do something to replace Darryl Strawberry's 37 home runs and team-record 108 RBis that he took to Los Angeles. So they dipped into the free-agent market for the first time since 1980 and gave Coleman a four­year contract worth $11.95 mil­lion. 
"Regardless of the situation with Strawberry, we would've been interested in Vince Coleman," Mets general man­ager Frank Cashen said. "We knew we needed more speed and a leadoff hitter." 
Coleman, 29, stole an average of 91 bases in each of six years, all with St. Louis, and was suc­cessful 83 percent of the time. He was at his best against the Mets, safely stealing the first 57 times he tried against them. 
Coleman batted a career-best .292 last season and stole 77 bases. He is a lifetime .265 hit­ter with a chopping swing ­the move from St. Louis' artifi­cial turf to Shea Stadium's grass may hurt him. 
The signing further crumbled the core of the Cardinals' championship teams. They lost Terry Pendleton and· Ken

Dayley to free agency this win­ter and traded away Willie McGee last August. 
The Pirates, the new National League East champions, know the feeling. They lost R.J. Reynolds recently and now Bream is going to Atlanta for three years and $5.5 million. Pittsburgh could also soon lose free agents Zane Smith, Wally Backman and Ted Power. 
. "It tears your heart out a little bit to see when, in two weeks or so, you could lose six or seven players," Pirates manager Jim Leyland said. "We've come a long way since 1986 and it's a shame to see it happen." 
The Braves had offered a three-year, $5.4 million con­tract to Stubbs. Instead, Stubbs, who set a Houston record with 23 home runs by a left-handed hitter last season, got a three­year, $6 million deal from the Brewers. 
Stubbs, mostly a first base­man, will play right field, a slot left open when Rob Deer went to Detroit. 
"It's not his best position, but he can play there well enough," Brewers manager Tom Trebelhorn said. 
Doran drew interest from several teams, particularly Los Angeles, before deciding on the Reds. He was born in Cincinnati and traded from Houston to the Reds late last season. 
Doran got a three-year, $7.3 million contract to play second base. He probably will split time with Mariano Duncan. 
The Giants, with a surplus of relievers after signing Righetti, sent Bedrosian to the Twins for a minor leaguer and a player to be named later. Bedrosian, 33 on Thursday, will give Minnesota a chance to move converted starter Rick Aguilera from the bullpen into the rota­tion. 
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -Quarterback Eric Hunter, cleared in an investigation of an alleged rape, says he'll wait until Purdue picks its new foot­ball coach before he decides whether to stay with the Boilermakers. 
Fred Akers stepped down as Purdue's coach last Thursday, and a nine-member search committee is in the process of interviewing candidates. 
"Once the head coach leaves, there's always a chance that one might continue his career elsewhere, depending on who they bring in," Hunter said. "At this time I'm thinking of what's best for me. It depends on who they bring in and what he likes w do (on offense)." 
Hunter was the Big Ten Conference's freshman of the year in 1989. He struggled somewhat in 1990 when Purdue switched to the run­and-shoot offense. 
On Tuesday, Tippecanoe County Prosecutor John Meyers announced that a police inves­tigation had cleared Hunter of a complaint brought by an out-of­state teen-ager who said Hunter raped her in a hotel room on campus on Nov. 11. 
"The evidence, touching all bases, was very plain in my mind. There was definitely, clearly, no basis for charges," Meyers said. 
Hunter said Tuesday that he was glad the investigation was over. 
"I knew it was just a matter of time before it'd be over any-

way, because none of the accu­sations were true at all," Hunter said. "It was a tough time. It was definitely a learn­ing experience. Hopefully I'll continue to learn from it." 
The girl was visiting the cam­pus as part of a women's bas­ketball recruiting trip. 
Hunter said he wouldn't mind if the new coach scraps the run-and-shoot, but he would prefer a pro-style, or some other kind, of passing offense. 
"I think we definitely need to throw the ball a lot," he said. "You can't come in here and just run the ball, run the ball, run the ball. That's a big change in such a short time. 
"I think I can run any type offense, but I'd like to be happy when I'm running it." 
Whether the next coach keeps Fred Jackson on his staff or not could play a role in whether Hunter goes or stays. Jackson took over as Akers' offensive coordinator this past season and also was the quarterback coach. 
"I think that might be a real big factor," Hunter said. "Coach Jackson and I have been together through thick and thin, and tough times. I think he's a great coach, and if he would happen to leave and go somewhere else, that would hurt me." 
Hunter also seriously consid­ered Tennessee and Maryland when he was being recruited out of Hampton, Va., but he said he was undecided where he would transfer to if he does decide to leave Purdue.

Searching for sports excitement? Try hoops 
Now that the gridiron 
season is almost over and home football games have become a thing of the past, many Notre Dame fans are wondering how they can quench their weekly crav­ings for some type of sports entertainment. What will 


the Irish faithful do if they Chris Cooney cannot scream "We are Assistant Sports Editor N.D.!" and root their teams to victory at least once a week? Ah, yes, that's right. It's basketball season. Thank 
goodness we have one of the country's fastest rising squads, ready to meet their schedule's hefty challenges with an exciting, up-tempo playing style; 
experience and power underneath; and incredible overall chemistry. That's right, I'm not talking about the men's team. 
For too long the Notre Dame women's basketball program has gone largely unrecognized and undersupported. Tonight's game against Indiana is the perfect opportunity to change that. The Hoosiers are undefeated and SportsChannel will be on hand to film a tape-delayed national broadcast of the 7:30 
p.m. battle. 
Notre Dame is a good, potentially great, basketball team. Don't let their 1-2 record fool you. The squad just finished what was probably their toughest games this year, against two perennial NCAA-tournament participants, Stanford, the defending national champi­ons, and UCLA. 
The losing streak shouldn't last long. Mter going 23­6 last year, the Irish are priming themselves for an eventual NCAA bid. With six (count 'em, six) returning starters, Notre Dame has the talent and experience to win a lot of games this year. 
In addition, this year is the last chance hoops fans will have to watch Notre Dame's tremendous trio of seniors showcase their variety of talents. 
Leading the way is shooting guard Karen Robinson, one of the nation's most exciting players. Robinson has been called everything from "senior sparkplug" to last year's MCC Player of the Year, largely because of her ability to sink the crucial basket and single­handedly turn a game around. If you've never seen her, now is the time to catch the inspired, aggressive style of play that is averaging Robinson over 20 points per game this season. 
Forward Krissi Davis complements Robinson with tough performances underneath the basket. While a short frontcourt player at 5-9, Davis has grown in stature among her competitors, largely because of accurate shooting and consistent rebounding. Irish head coach Muffet McGraw has called Davis "the heart of the team" because of Davis' competitive nature and dedicated physical play. 
Rounding out the team captains is the versatile Sara Liebscher, who recently returned to the line-up
