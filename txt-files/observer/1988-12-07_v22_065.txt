INSIDE COLUMN 





Kids are being unjustly deprived of Heat Miser 
Speaking for myself, my friends, and, I 
believe, the vast majority of college students 
across the land, our lives in the month of 
December revolve around Christmas specials. 
This is unfortunate, in the fact that December 
also is the month of exams. These tend to dis­
rupt one's viewing schedule. This obviously 
creates a problem of priorities. 
It is really not fair or prudent of our Admin­
istration to schedule exams during Christmas­
special time. As altering the date of Christmas 
would be a bit difficult (especially in light of 
the Catholic nature of Notre Dame), it might 
be prudent of the Administration to consider 
rescheduling final exams. I would like to sug­
gest the formation of an ad-hoc task force to 
study the effects of this scheduling conflict. 
This year, the season began on November 28, 
with the Christmas special of Christmas spe­
cials, "How the Grincb Stole Christmas." This 
Doctor Seuss classic has reached cult status on 
campuses across this great land. Each year, 
academic life slams to a halt for one half -hour 
as students celebrate the great mystery of how 
that mean 'ole Grinch tried to steal Christmas, 
knowing full well that he would meet the ir­
resistable force of Cindy Lou Who, "who was 
no more than two." Indeed, one can almost cut 
the feeling of joy with a knife as the tremendous 
events laid out in the program caused the 
Grinch's heart to "grow three sizes that day." 
There are very few of us who could not relate 
that tale in precise detail. Indeed, as we 
watched it that night at The Observer, several 
staff members were able to rhyme along with the narrator for the vast majority of the pro­gram; sadly, I am not in the same class as these people. 
This proves an important point: we truly are a television generation. There is not a time in my memory that Christmas rolled around with­out the appearance of "The Grinch," "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, "Frosty the Snow­man," "Twas the Night Before Christmas," and the many others. Indeed, these programs are a harbinger of Christmas: without them, my entire annual schedule would be torn asunder. 
These specials are a symbol that the Christmas season has begun, more than sales or Christmas cards ever will be. Christmas pro­grams are one thing which students from all over the United States have in common, regard­less of where they are from. They are a vital part of our pop culture. 
Sadly, the television network executives do not see eye-to-eye with me on this issue. 

Matt Gallagher 
Assistant News Editor 



Some mean old Scrooge at ABC, CBS or NBC has decided that two important elements of our lives are simply not important enough to be worth the network's time: "The Year Without a Santa Claus" and "Santa Claus is Coming to Town." 
What happened? Where did these two cel­luloid classics disappear to? 
An entire generation of youth is being deprived of Mr. Heat Miser and Mr. Cold Miser, of the Buergermeister Meisterbuerger and the Winter Warlock. 
Two of the few stable elements of my child­hood have been yanked out from under my feet. It is just plain not fair. 
The logic behind this move by the networks escapes me. If any two programs could ap­proach a 100-share of the television audience, these would be they. 
So please--write your Congressman, your other elected representatives and, most impor­tantly, the presidents of the three major net­works, demanding that they restore these pro­grams to their proper place: on the small screen. Don't let them ruin the lives of the youth of America. 
Well, at least we've got "A Very Brady Christmas."

MIAMI-More than 90 top 
U.S. drug middlemen were in­dicted Tuesday based on evidence from a sting opera­tion in which an undercover FBI company sold traffickers radios, navigational beacons and other high-tech equipment. 
Tapes and other evidence from the operation led to drug indictments in Miami and Tampa against 93 people. About five tons of cocaine, 100 tons of marijuana and some heroin also were confiscated, FBI Director Williams Ses­sions announced in Washing­ton. 
"We believe that this case, because of the positions and large numbers of those charged and arrested, will have a significant impact on the ability of these cartels to continue to import drugs into the United States and abroad," the FBI director said. 
By Tuesday afternoon about half of those charged were in custody in various cities around the country, including Los Angeles, Boston, Houston, 
Tampa  and Miami, the  FBI  
said.  
The  17-month  operation,  

nicknamed "Cat-Com" for Catch Communications, was built around a Hialeah, Fla. company called RA Communi­cations &computers Inc. set up by the FBI. 
The company sold all types of communications and com­puter equipment, including cel­lular telephones, and even of­fered de-bugging services to its trusting clients, said Miami 
U.S. attorney Dexter Lehtinen. 
"The traffickers were hiring undercover agents ... to sweep their premises, unknown to them that the feds were check­ing to see whether or not the feds were bugging them," Leh­tinen said. 
William Perry, head of the Miami FBI office, said RA Communications sold state-of­the-art equipment to the traf­fickers and soon was arranging communications to allow the traffickers to talk directly by high-band radio to their smug­gling ships and their bosses in Colombia. 
The traffickers, whom Perry called "top-of-the-line" U.S. contacts for drug lords Pablo Escobar Gaviria, Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasquez and Jose Gon­zalo Rodrigues Gacha, soon were basing their smuggling operations out of the Hialeah company, unaware that cameras and tape machines were recording their conversa­tions. 

ITT receives large fine for using secret government information 
Associated Press 
BOSTON--ITT Corp. was fined $200,000 Tuesday for ob­taining confidential govern­ment information used to bid on $180 million in military con­tracts by treating Air Force of­ficials to golf games, sports and theater tickets and meals. 
The New York-based con­glomerate pleaded guilty in Oc­tober to one count of conspiring to defraud the government. The fine was handed down by

ITT admitted that an em­ployee in its defense technology division in 1984 and early 1985 spent about $15,000 and was reimbursed for illegal gifts to Air Force officials at Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, Mass. 
In exchange, ITT received copies of internal government documents with confidential procurement information on two Air Force programs ITT was interested in purchasing. 
The maximum possible fine in the case was $500,000. 
"It was a plea bargain situa­tion," ITT spokesman James Gallagher said. "We agreed to plead guilty to one charge of fraud, the government agreed to drop three other charges."

Edward Vincenzi, a senior marketing representative of ITT's Van Nuys, Calif.-based Gilfillan subsidiary, which spe­cializes in radar technology, 
pleaded  guilty to the same  
charge.  
He received  a  1-year  

suspended sentence and was placed on probation for one year. Vincenzi, who cooperated with federal authorities, had faced up to 35 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. 
Federal prosecutors charged that ITT gilfillan executives tacitly approved of attempts by Vincenzi to defraud the govern­ment and later tried to cover up his activities by destroying or concealing Air Force docu­ments.

After latest crash, B-52 bombers are grounded 
Associated Press 
MARQUETTE, Mich.-A B-52 bomber crashed on a runway and burst into flames during a training flight early Tuesday, injuring all eight crewmen and prompting the Strategic Air Command to ground its fleet of the aging planes. 
The grounding of about 260 B-52s was ordered as a precau­tion, said Maj. Suzanne Randle, public affairs officer for SAC headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Neb. 
She said she anticipates the fleet will be back in the air in 24 hours. "We don't lose many B-52s. It has been a super plane," she said. 
The B-52 broke into three parts about 1: 15 a.m. EST during practice "touch-and­go" landings at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base, said Sgt. Naomi Siegal, a spokeswoman at the SAC installation here. In a touch-and-go, the plane imme­diately takes off again rather

credfble," Mrs. McManus said, adding that several students have come to the hospital. McManus, co-captain of the varsity swim team last year, was visited by 10 of his former teammates Monday night. 
"Saturday when we arrived from Philadelpia, (the doctors) gave us no hope. He could be in this coma for six weeks," Mrs. McManus said. "The power of prayer works; he'll pull out of it." 
McManus, of Jenkintown, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia, is employed by Northwestern Mutual, a life insurance com­pany in Northfield, Ill. He lives in Chicago with two friends who are also Notre Dame graduates. 
"Pat had a lot of friends," said senior Susan Coene. "He was a leader to the swim team. They all looked up to him. They called him 'Crazy Pat.' He's just an all-around good guy." 
A Mass for McManus was celebrated Tuesday afternoon by swim team chaplain Father Richard Zang at the Fatima Retreat House, said Co­Captain Brian Vogel. 
"Pat is probably one of the most supportive people I've ever met. He'd always go out of his way to do anything for any teammate in the three years I spent with him," Vogel said. 
"He led more by example than anything else. I think-he reflected the Notre Dame spirit," said Vogel, adding that the swim team plans to visit their former captain on Friday. 
Vogel said the team first heard about McManus' acci­dent Saturday morning after the National Catholic Swim­ming Championships at LaSalle University in Philadel­phia on Saturday, which Mrs. McManus attended. 
An all-night prayer vigil for McManus will be held in the Alumni Hall chapel tonight beginning at 10 p.m. with a vigil Mass for the Feast of the Im­maculate Conception and en­ding with the 5 p.m. Mass on Thursday, Leveille said. 
"He's a very nice guy, very easygoing," said Leveille, who' knew McManus personally when he lived in Alumni. "His two roommates in Chicago are both Notre Dame graduates. It's really the Notre Dame fam­ily kind of thing." 
Mrs. McManus noted the Notre Dame family doesn't just include Pat's friends. His bro­ther David is an Alumni Hall freshman. Two doctors on the hospital floor where McManus is stationed are also alumni. A third doctor at the hospital was a varsity swimmer who graduated when Pat was a freshman, she said. 
"We're a big Notre Dame family and feeling bigger with all the support," Mrs. McManus said.

Krebs said that changing the library hours could be problematic if students do not realize that the hours have been extended. "I think if the library changes (the hours), they are afraid students won't know. Publicity has been a problem in the past," Krebs said. 
Lack of publicity would not be a problem this year, Krebs added. 
According to Krebs, students would have a voice in proposals to be forwarded to library per­sonnel after the Christmas break.

third flight for Atlantis and the longest of the three shuttle mis­sions that have been dedicated entirely to military purposes. 
Rear Adm. Richard Truly, a former astronaut in charge of the shuttle program, called the current flight "one of our most important missions. It's At­lantis' first flight after the standdown, and now you have two vehicles proven in flight. That's extremely important." 
While the mission was shrouded in secrecy, with no briefings by officials on details of its progress, U.S. and Soviet news organization reported the shuttle's classified payload was a powerful spy satellite. 
Sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity said Monday that the astronauts had successfully deployed the $500 million Lacrosse satellite 
during the weekend, and that it was operating well in an orbit that allows it to make radar pictures of 80 percent of the So­viet Union. 
The satellite is said to be de­signed to help American intel­ligence agencies monitor So­viet compliance with arms control treaties, and also to serve as the "radar eye" for the new B-2 stealth bomber. 
The astronauts also were believed to have conducted several experiments aimed at defining man's role as an ob­server in space.

Rangers get Franco in trade 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA --The Texas Rangers kept trading faces at baseball's winter meetings, getting Julio Franco from Cleveland on Tuesday, while the California Angels raised the already high stakes for free agents Bruce Hurst and Nolan Ryan. 
Philadelphia and Montreal 
did  business,  exchanging  
pitchers  Kevin  Gross  and  
Floyd  Youmans,  and  more  

teams courted Atlanta about Dale Murphy. 
But the Rangers, who had not made a trade at the winter meetings since 1983, continued to be the main attraction. This time, they sent Pete O'Brien, Oddibe McDowell and Jerry Browne to the Indians for Franco, who led all major league second basemen with a .303 average. 
A day earlier, Texas got Rafael Palmeiro--the second­leading hitter in the National League--in a nine-player trade with the Chicago Cubs and made another minor swap with the New York Yankees. 
"You don't come down here expecting to do anything. But we hoped to improve our of­fense, and we have," Texas general manager Tom Grieve said. 
Franco, 27, has batted over ~00 for three straight seasons. 

He hit a career-high 10 home 3.21 earned run average in only runs, drove in 54 runs and stole 14 games. He throws hard and 25 bases.

NEW YORK--Boris Becker has grown up, on and off the tennis court. 

After winning Wimbledon twice as a teen-ager, the West German wunderkind dumped his coach, moved to Monte Carlo and found that fame and fortune do not always lead to happiness and success. 
Becker slipped from No. 2 to No. 5 in the world in 1987, and was upset in the second round at Wimbledon. But he came back to win a tour-leading seven titles this year, including the season-ending Masters championship at Madison 

Square Garden. 
"I'm playing the best tennis I've ever played," Becker said after his dramatic five-set vic­tory over Ivan Lendl Monday night. "I think this is an indi­cation that I'm on the right track."

the Hoosiers would draw no closer. 
"The football team has set the pace," said Joe Fredrick of the fan support. "For a Tues­day night this place was pretty pumped up. The teams and the student body are very close here, but there is no doubt that the football team's success has an impact on us. We don't want to go 0-20 when they win the national championship." 
Joining Fredrick and Singleton in double figures were J a mere Jackson (12 points), LaPhonso Ellis and Robinson (11 each). Jones led the Hoosiers with 18 points.

"I'm at the stage of my career where I've learned a couple of lessons," he said. Asked what he's learned, Be­
cker  replied,  "That  nothing  
comes  easy,  on  or  off  the  
court."  

That was certainly true in the Masters final, which Becker won in a thrilling final-set tie­breaker. After battling for nearly five hours, Becker and Lendl engaged in a 37-stroke rally on match point. It finally ended when Becker hit a back­hand that hit the top of the net and fell over for a winner. 
"Physically, this was the hardest match I've ever played," Becker said. "I'm completely exhausted." 
The final point symbolized Lendl's frustrating year, one in which he lost his No. 1 ranking to Mats Wilander and failed to win a major title. Lendl came back from shoulder surgery in September to reach the Masters final, but his bid for a record fourth consecutive championship fell just short.

Notre Dame will look to get the ball underneath to Bunek, but if Marquette keys on her, Robinson may be called on to maintain an aggressive scoring attack.

Fredrick 
continued from page 16 
"Joe Fredrick took it over when it counted at the end," Irish coach Digger Phelps said. 
Fredrick shrugged off the praise, saying it was just his turn to be in the spotlight at the end. 
"We knew we have a lot of weapons," he said. "In the first game, it was LaPhonso Ellis and against Kentucky, Kevin Ellery. It just happened to be my turn. I was getting into the groove, and whenever I shot, I was confident it was going to go in." 
While Edwards was strug­gling, Fredrick had 11 points in helping the Irish to a 38-34 halftime lead. He made his case early, shooting five-of­eight with one three-pointer in the half. 
But it was Fredrick's play in the second half that keyed Notre Dame's first win over In­diana since 1984. 
When the Irish went to their slow-down offense, Fredrick was the one in control. Al­though it was not the uptempo style the Irish have been playing, Fredrick knew who should have the ball and made sure they got it. 
"We like to spread it out," Fredrick said. "We've got such great one-on-one players in Tim (Singleton), Jamere and myself. That's the fun part of our offense." 
The new uptempo offense opens up new opportunities for Fredrick and the other Irish guards. At times, it looked like some shots were forced, but that's due to the new offense. 
With the Irish outrebounding Indiana 43-27, Fredrick can take some chances from the perimeter. Notre Dame had a total of 20 offensive boards to offset any poor shot selection. 
"We know we take some bad shots," Fredrick said, "but our offense is so much looser this year." 
And Fredrick was definitely loose and relaxed after getting his first win over Indiana. 
"We wanted to show them there's more than one team in Indiana," he said.

Associated Press 
ANAHEIM--Rams quarter­back Jim Everett is thankful December is here, and not nec­essarily just because Christmas is coming. 
There wasn't much for Everett and his Los Angeles teammates to like about the past month--the Rams were zero-for-November. 
"Thank heaven December's here," Everett said after the Rams snapped a four-game losing streak with a 23-3 victory over the Chicago Bears Mon­day night. 
Take away November and the Rams look like one of the NFL's top teams. They were 7-2 heading into that month and thus are 8-2 outside November. Their good start and the win over the Bears has enabled them to remain in the playof( picture despite their four-game losing skid. 
The Rams need to win their last two games to have a real­istic shot at a playoff berth. 

The Rams' slump seem to consist of an avalanche of small details going wrong-­dropped passes, untimely penalties, missed blocking as­signments. 
"I don't know what was going on," said Everett, who com­pleted 17 of 31 throws for 251 yards and one touchdown in the win over the wounded Bears. "I guess it's just human nature. Our backs were against the wall and we figured we'd better do something." 
"We were in a huge slump. Now there may be some light at the end of the tunnel.' 
Some of the little things that hadn't been going right for the Rams seemed to go in their fa­vor in their Monday night matchup against the Bears. 
The Rams, for instance, got a helping hand in a roundabout way from the Green Bay Pack­ers. The Bears lost quarter-

NCAA error gives Sanders his fourth 300-yard game 
Associated Press 

LUBBOCK--A significant statistical revision Tuesday gave Reisman trophy winner Barry Sanders of Oklahoma Sate 75 more rushing yards in his record-setting effort against Texas Tech, NCAA of­ficials said. 
In Oklahoma State's 45-42 victory Saturday over Tech in Tokyo, Sanders originally was credited with 257 yards rushing on 42 carries, a performance that gave him 2,553 yards and broke Marcus Allen's rushing record of 2,342 yards set at Southern Cal in 1981. 
However, a review of the game videotape Tuesday revealed that two running plays were incorrectly credited as pass receptions by Sanders, said Steve Boda, the NCAA's associate director of statistics. 
The revision gives Sanders 332 yards rushing on 44 carries, the junior tailback's fourth 300­yard plus game of the season. He now has 2,628 yards. 
While the NCAA routinely makes small statistical adjust­ments several days after games end, Boda said, a change of such a magnitude is unprecedented.

Hard work and patience earn seniors an NCAA bid 
Paying your dues. 

It is the quintessential motivator for athletes who go through endless hours of practice. You pay your dues and the rewards will come. For teams, that reward is post-season play and championships. 
The Notre Dame volleyball team has paid its dues and was rewarded with its first-ever NCAA bid, then responded on Saturday night with a first-round trouncing of 36-3 Penn State. 
Now a member of the Sweet Sixteen, the 19-11 Irish travel to Champaign, Ill. this Friday to face fourth-ranked Illinois in the second round. 
There is no question to anyone around Notre Dame volleyball that the solid foundation for this team is the quartet of seniors--Zanette Bennett, Mary Kay Waller, Maureen Shea and Whitney Shewman. 
For these four, the winning has not always come easy. In the beginning, in fact, it did not come very often. During the 1985 season, the freshmen year for Bennett, Waller, Shea and Shewman, the Irish finished 12-21. 
"They paid a tough price that year," said head coach Art Lambert, who inherited a faltering pro­gram in 1984 and has compiled a 108-61 record. "They were basically thrown to the lions." 
There were a lot of bruises that first year. But time--as in a lot of court time in the Joyce ACC Pit--has healed those wounds. 
"The four of us came in with a lot of physical talent," recalled Shewman. "We were all good ath­letes, but not good volleyball players. Coach Lam­bert has really worked with us to use that physical ability to improve our volleyball talent." 
Brian O'Gara 
Irish Items 


Bennett, Waller, Shea and Shewman all saw start­ing action in their rookie campaign. What transpired--loss after aggravating loss--made the Irish hungry for success. But it seemed like a "maybe someday" dream. 
Welcome to someday. The Notre Dame volleyball program has arrived with a bang in the past three years. 33-7 in 1986. 30-9 in 1987. But no bid. Until now. 
"The four seniors have carried this program on their back," said Lambert. "None of them came in here with club volleyball experience. They had no one to pattern themselves after. Since they came in it has been so much easier for other freshmen who can look at these four and say 'That's how it's done.' A picture is worth a thousand words." 
Either Waller, Shea or Bennett sit atop every Notre Dame career list except assists. Waller, the most intimidating non-stop-smiler in college ath­letics, stands first in career blocks and service aces. 
Shea, the epitome of consistency, holds the record for career digs. Bennett, who inspired the 'Z' corner with her numerous booming spikes, has the most kills and best hitting percentage. And in most categories they are ranked one, two and three. 
What those three have contributed in numbers, Shewman has contributed in spirit and hustle. Only 5'7", Shewman has overcome the height disadvan­tage to earn a starting job as a freshman and senior and be a sparkplug off the bench in the middle years. 
Whatever the outcome of Notre Dame's effort in the tournament, the verdict is in. Notre Dame vol­leyball, thanks in large part to the leadership and play of Mary Kay Waller, Whitney Shew man, Zanette Bennett and Maureen Shea, is a program to reckoned with.
