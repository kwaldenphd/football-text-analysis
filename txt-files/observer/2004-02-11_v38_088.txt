Legends takes dating to fast lane 
By JEN ROWLING 
News Writer 
Legends set the atmosphere for Valentine's Day last night by taking a stab at match­making with a speed dating session for nearly 50 Notre Dame students. 
"ND is known as the campus with no dating, and Valentine's Day was around the corner, so it seemed to be a good idea," program coordi­nator Jonathan Jorissen said. 
Speed dating has recently become a popular phenome­non in large eities across the globe. and Jorisscn, following a suggestion from his sister, decided to try the idea on Notre Dame's campus ­despite its rep11ted stale dat­ing scene. 
Small circular tables adorned with Valentine decor arranged on the dance floor were the setting for the 27 male students and 22 female students who attended the IWCnt.

GRADUATE STUDENT UNION 

Members plan spring charity gala 

By AMANDA MICHAELS 
News Writer 
The Charity Gala, constitution­al changes and upcoming spring elections were the focus of Tuesday night's Graduate Student Union meeting -the first of the semester. 
The council discussed which local charity would benefit from the Charity Gala, an event to be held on April 16 on the 20th floor of the City Center. The three organizations eligible for selec­tion are the Center for the Homeless in South Bend, the women's shelter run through the YWCA of St. Joseph County and the Refugee and Immigration Services of Michiana, to which last year's Gala proceeds went. 
"Last year, we wanted to donate to an organization that might not get as much attention on campus ... and where even a small amount of money will make a big difference," said aca­demic affairs committee chair Tim Dale. "The woman I talked to [at Refugee and Immigration Services] told me that they could make even a nickel go a long way." 
A majority vote ensured that the Refugee and Immigration Services would receive $2 from every $5 ticket sold. Last year, approximately 200 tickets were sold, and organizers are hoping to see an increase to 250, so they can give the charity at least $500.

Queerfihn festival debuts 

University defends departments' decision to sponsor event 
By ANDREW THAGARD Associate News Editor 
The Queer Film Festival, a four-day event showcasing gay cinematography, debuts tonight at Notre Dame with the award-winning documentary "Jim in Bold" followed by a panel discussion featuring the film's producer. 
The festival -the first of its kind at Notre Dame -may seem, to some, out of place on the campus of a Catholic uni­versity, though it offers an intellectual opportunity for the Notre Dame community, according to University spokesman Matt Storin and Liam Dacey, the festival's organizer. 
"We arc an academic institu­tion that has a whole [range] of classes, seminars and con­ferences. and that is what we are all about," Storin said. 

The festival, which will fea­ture a series of film screen­ings, discussions and a writing workshop and will bring direc­tors, screenwriters and pro­ducers to campus, is not specifically sponsored by the University as a whole, but rather by the Gender Studies Program, the Gay and Lesbian Alumni of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's and the Departments of English and Film, Television and Theatre. 
"There is a difference between what the University ... does in a University-wide sense as opposed to what our academic departments do as part of their missions," Storin said. 
lie emphasized that the festi­val's aim is to promote aca­demic discourse and does not necessarily reflect the University's position or views.

Accounting majors assist needy with taxes 
By TERESA NOWAKOWSKI 
News Wrirer 
With tax season well under­way, accounting majors at both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's have an opportunity to apply their skills through a tax assis­tance program that began Tuesday and continues through April. 

Over 60 students participate in the program to aid the greater South Bend community in filing tax returns. Students who partic­ipate in this program have a pre­requisite tax class that they must take, in addition to 10 hours of training. They then are sent in pairs to sites around South Bend and Mishawaka, working with low-income families and students to file taxes free of charge. 
Professor of Accounting Ken Milani took over the program that was created almost 30 years ago by a law student and an MBA student. 
Milani says that it is a "win­win-win situation," where mem­bers of the community get their taxes done for free, students gain experience and interaction with people who may be outside of their social class and faculty get to see if the program runs as intended. 
Students are required to write reflection papers at the comple­tion of the program, several of which Milani says brings him to tears each year. 
Mark Bellatoni, a Notre Dame senior, said that he finds the most fulfillment in helping people obtain a refund.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Watch your mouth 
Anyone who knows me also knows the one pet peeve that stands out above all others in my book: When you say you're going to do some­thing, do it. 
This past week­end, I got a call from my best friend. At one point she halted the conversation to point out, "If there's one thing about you, I know that you always 

Annellese
keep your word." 
I take pride in Woolford the fact that I hold to my com­Saint Mary's mitments. Not Editor only do I recog­nize this trait in myself, but as others get to know me, they start to appreciate it as well. 
I don't care if it's something as simple as making a phone call that you said you'd make, or following through on a favor that you prom­ised to do-chances are, another person is counting on you. Then again, maybe that's just my own wishful thinking. 
Perhaps I'm naive to presume that others take commitments as serious­ly as I do. After meeting the people I have at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's during my four years here, I've finally realized that everyone comes from a different background and, hence, has a varied moral upbringing. Looked at one way, the fact that I'm just now recognizing these circumstances could be seen as pathetic. The light bulb definitely should have turned on a lot sooner. 
Another approach, however, pres­ents the question of whether or not it really is too much to ask that peo­ple keep their word. It's a safe bet to assume that the person on the 

r receiving end will expect it. After all, 
~ 
isn't it better to assume and live up 
to someone's expectations than it is 
to brush off commitment and risk 

r upsetting someone's feelings? 
The way I look at it-and I prom­ise this is the most philosophical side of me those of you reading this will witness -is that, if you can't hold someone to their word, what can you hold them to? With commit­ment comes trust. Therefore, when a commitment is let down, so is trust (and respect too, r might add). 
To say that everyone upholds their end of a deal 100 percent of the time would be terribly utopist of me. So what? Who's to say there's anything

f 
wrong with that?

! In my realm of friends, family and people I meet, I do expect everyone to stay as true to their word as I do to mine. It's as though, initially, they get a clean slate and I give them full respect without passing judgment. So generous, I know. But seriously, all I'm asking is that the next time you say you'll do something, keep in mind that there are still people like me who put a lot of worth in words. Actions speak louder. A little effort goes a long way.

Frenchwoman marries her dead boyfriend 
NICE, France-Dressed in a demure black suit, a 35-year-old Frenchwoman married her dead boyfriend Tuesday -a macabre exchange of vows that required authorization from the French president. 
Under French law, Christelle Demichel became both bride and widow as a result of the ceremony, which was per­formed at Nice City Hall on the French Riviera. 
The deceased groom, a former policeman identi­fied as Eric, was not pres­ent at the ceremony. He was killed by a drunk driver in September 2002. 

Demichel told LCI televi­sion she was fully aware that "it could seem shock­ing to marry someone who is dead," but said that her fiance's absence from her life had not dimmed her feelings for him. 
Hundreds of bats found In mall elevator 
COLUMBIA, S.C. Apparently store hours mean little to hundreds of bats that have flocked to an employee elevator at the back of a shopping mall near downtown. 
Roughly 350 of the noc­turnal mammals have been found so far, said Brian Berrios of Wildlife Solutions, which has been hired to capture the creepy creatures from the elevator's skylight at the Richland Mall. 
Mall management has shut down the elevator to keep the bats from spreading to the mall's shopping area, asking employees of a call center inside the mall to use cus­tomer entrances.

Actress and stand-up comedi­enne Geri Jewell began her lec­ture at Saint Mary's Tuesday by describing her life with an admirable vitality, only casually mentioning the fact that she has lived with cerebral palsy since birth. 
"I was born this way, so it's no big deal," she said. "You know what is a big deal to me? My hair."  
Despite her disability, a chronic condition affecting body move­ments and muscle coordination caused by partial brain damage, Jewell has maintained control of her life in every capacity she can. 
"I Ier life and her story are an amazing inspiration to every­body," said Frances Bruder, Students with Disabilities repre­sentative on Student Diversity Board. 
Best known as Cousin Geri in "The Facts of Life," Jewell was the first disabled person to be cast in a Primetirne series. She was cast in nine episodes of the show, meaning she had just nine weeks of work in four years. 
"Of course I was a token, I knew it," she said. However, Jewell did not let the typecasting discourage her. She instead rea­soned that if she made herself a public figure, she would eventu­ally break into mainstream entertainment. 
In addition to "The Facts of Life," Jewell has held roles in "I Love Liberty," "1\vo of a Kind," succeed in the tasks given to her. "Nice Dreams" and "Deadwood," Within her lecture, Jewell which will premiere in March on interspersed stories about the HBO. difficulty encountered when

Jewell graduated from high school and was left to the discre­tion of California state agencies. They tried to make her learn a variety of skills in a workshop, in a job at a switchboard and in a filing position, yet she could not complete any of them -simply because she was never interest­ed in what she was doing. 
"They never asked me what my interests were," explained Jewell about why she failed to Jewell insists that 
she "will go 200 yards to make someone feel com­fortable" around her, "but it's always a two-way street." 
"The only thing I can be responsible for is my attitude and what I believe about myself," she said. 
Jewell was the first in a series of guest speakers for Saint Mary's Disabilities Awareness Week. In addition to other pre­sentations and lectures, signs will also be posted around cam­pus illustrating the effects of dis­abilities and highlighting public figures that live with a disability on a daily basis.

Date 
continued from page 1 
Each participant attended eight five~minute dates. Couples sat at a table chatting during their time intervals and, when time was called, they rotated to their next part­ners. 
Every potential date had his or her own scorecard. and, after the completion of each date, they evaluated the peo­ple they met. If a person had potential, a "yes" was circled. Contrarily, if there was no interest, a "no" was circled. Legends coordinators collected the score sheets and distrib­uted phone numbers if two individuals checked "yes" for each other. 
After the eight dates were completed, participants were given time to mingle. Many students had positive com­ments about their evening. 
"Everyone I met was really nice," freshman Allison Smith said. 

Senior Dave Harmen expressed a similar opinion, praising Legends' efforts to enhance the social atmosphere at the University. 
"It was a valiant attempt to establish a dating scene at ND," Harmen said. "I haven't talked to this many girls since sophomore year:" 
Senior Sean MacCready agreed. 
"I decided to give as many ladies at ND a chance at me as possible," MacCready joked. 
Jorissen was pleased with the turnout and surprised that males outnumbered females. He said he believes the speed dating idea has potential and is considering separating nights by year of graduation. 
In response to the topic of dating, in general, at Notre Dame, many students expressed similar views, but opinions varied about the impact speed dating could have on the University social scene. 
"People hang out, have fun on the weekends, then give it a name," senior Liza Davis said. "They call it dating, but all it is is hanging out on the week­ends." 
She said she doubted speed dating would ever catch on as a highly influential social force at the University. 
" I feel it would be a fun afternoon, but then deteriorate back to Notre Dame," Davis said. "I feel the relationships and people I met would not be compatible" 
Sophomore Craig Brede said that the "majority of what goes on is just hooking up," and he also doubts speed dating could greatly change Notre Dame. 
" I don't think speed dating will work, but if you think it would be fun to meet people that way, more power to you," Brede said.

posed a change to the GSU's constitution that would serve to redistribute responsibilities among the chairs of two com­mittees. Under the proposed amendment, each of the two social committee chairs would take responsibility for either the fall or spring and summer social events, and each of the quality of life committee chairs would deal with either orientation or quality of life and diversity issues. 
The measure was passed unanimously, but must also be approved at March's meeting before the constitution can be amended for next year's GSU leaders. 
Post also announced the March 22 deadline for the sub­mission of application for candi­dates in the spring presidential and vice presidential elections.

Pro-Aristide fighters block roads 
CAP-IIAITIEN. llaiti -Armed loyalists of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide set up blaz­ing barricades Tuesday, vowing to attack rebels leading a bloody uprising that has spread to at least 11 towns and cost 42 lives. 
Brandishing pistols, bands of drunken youths manned barricades and threw rocks at passing cars in the northern port city of Cap-llailien. They said they were protecting the half-million residents of Haiti's second­largest city, a former Aristide stronghold where support has dwindled as poverty increases. 
Hoadblocks have prevented food deliveries to tens of thousands of hungry Haitians, the 
U.N. World Food Program warned from Gnneva, and fuel tankers also were blocked. Some gas stations have run out of fuel. 
France moves toward scarf ban 
PAHIS -France took a decisive step Tuesday toward banning Islamic head scarves in public schools, with lawmakers overwhelmingly backing the government's drive to preserve French secular traditions from Muslim fundamentalism. 
The ban on religious attire in classrooms, which also includes Jewish skullcaps and large Christian crosses, was approved 494­36 despite protests and criticism from around the world. The measure goes early next month to the Senate, where there is lit­tle opposition. 
The ban was expected to take effect in September. Applying the law could be the real test: Critics say it's .too vague and will inflame anti-French feelings among the nation's large Muslim minority.

Estimates rise in Church scandal 
The scope of sex abuse accusations against Homan Catholic clergy since 1950 appears to be much greater than previously estimated by victims' groups and the media. an Associated Press review of reports from dio­ceses has found. 
The U.S. church will make an unprece­dented, nationwide accounting of abuse claims and costs later this month, and some bishops already have started releasing local figures. The AP contacted dioceses across the country and found that 1,341 clergy members have been accused of molesting minors, with more than half the dioceses yet to report. 
Report: Atkins was obese at death 
NEW YOHK -The debate over Dr. Robert Atkins' popular high-fat, low-carb diet flared posthumously Tuesday when it was learned that Atkins himself was a bloated 258 pounds at his death. 
A city medical examiner's report filed after Atkins' 2003 death from a fall showed the 6­foot doctor was at a weight normally consid­ered obese. A physicians group that is highly critical of the diet released details of the report, claiming the Atkins diet led to weight and heart troubles for its 72-year-old cre­ator. 
Atkins' allies immediately disputed that.

The Islamic Society of North America said it does not want that controversy to hurt the campaign by the Alliance for Marriage. 
The society, representing several million people from 300 mosques and Muslim organ­izations, ended its affiliation with the alliance last month.

Plane carrying workers crashes, killing 43 
Associated Press 
SHARJAH -An Iranian plane carrying migrant workers back from a visa-renewing journey to a Gulf island crashed Tuesday while approaching the airport, killing 43 of the 46 people aboard and narrowly missing nearby homes. 
Three survivors of Kish Air's Flight IRK1770 were hospital­ized, two in critical condition with burns and fractures. 
Authorities recovered the Fokker-SO's cockpit voice and data recorders and hoped they reveal why the plane :-which had not reported any trouble on its final approach -crashed two miles from Sharjah airport and burst into flames. 
It was returning from the Iranian island of Kish, a favorite destination of foreign workers who must exit the Emirates and return to meet their visa requirements. 
The airline advertises cheap "visa change" excursions and its daily flights are packed with foreigners -particularly Indians, Pakistanis and Filipinos who make up the bulk of the Emirates' work force. 
According to a passenger list released by the airline, 25 of the 40 passengers were traveling on visa change package deals that included air fare and cheap hotels in Kish. 
According to the list, aboard were 13 Iranians, 13 Indians, four Egyptians, two Algerians, two Bangladeshis, two Filipinos, one Nepalese, one Syrian, one Nigerian and one Cameroonian. Six Iranian crew members also were aboard. 
One man, Yaqoub Nasir, who was listed as an Iranian, was from the Emirates, according to his family. 
Many Iranians traveling to the Emirates to shop or for business first fly from· Tehran to Kish, then make the 60-mile hop across the Gulf on Kish Air, which is significantly cheaper than a direct flight. 
Col. Saleh Ali al-Mutawaa, general director of Sharjah Police, said 43 of the 46 people aboard died in the late morning crash. Two men -an Iranian and a Filipino -were being treated at the coronary care unit of al-Qasimi lwspital, emer­gency room attendants said. 
Another man, badly burned on his face and body and with multiple fractures, was on a ventilator in intensive care, the attendants said. They did not give his nationality, but Al­Mutawaa, the police official, said two Filipinos and an Iranian survived. 
The near miss shook resi­dents. 
"I was sleeping when I heard what must have been the shriek of the engines, and then a very loud noise that was like a night­mare," said Hamza Ghareeb, whose house was only 100 yards from the wreckage. "My whole family ran out and we couldn't believe our eyes: There was a burning plane sitting in our front yard." 


Ghareeb said the smoke and fire stopped him and others from getting too close, and resi­dents feared the plane would explode. 
"All I could see was flames and smoke and bodies every­where," said Beatrice Manolo, a Filipina maid working in one of the homes in the area. 
Thirty charred bodies covered with red blankets lay in rows near the wreckage. The bodies were intact but burned beyond recognition; one was an infant, an Iranian girl.

IRS cracks down on tax shelters 
WASIJINGTON -The Internal Revenue Service announced Tuesday it had collected $170 million in taxes and penalties on money hidden offshore and has shared with state tax agencies information about 20,000 taxpayers using scams and shelters to avoid taxes. 
Both efforts stem from the agency's move to curb the growth of tax shelters among wealth­ier taxpayers -an agency priority -said IHS Commissioner Mark Everson. 
The IHS uncovered the money hidden off­shore by offering a three-month amnesty last year to taxpayers who came forward. More than 1,300 taxpayers took the offer to avoid criminal prosecution. Those taxpayers were required to reveal the person or company who sold them the offshore scheme. 
Viacom to dump Blockbuster 
NEW YOHK -Viacom Inc., the media con­glomerate that owns MTV and CBS, is getting rid of its controlling stake in the Blockbuster video rental chain and taking a $1.3 billion charg~ to reflect the declining value of the business. The charge put Viacom well into the red for its latest fiscal quarter. 
Ironically, the reason Viacom originally bought Blockbuster 10 years ago was for the large amounts of money it made, which Viacom needed at the time to finance its bid for Paramount in a heated takeover battle against rival suitor QVC.

OPEC to cut world oil output

Kerry's views resonate with Southerners 
Exit polls show Kerry attracted voters angry with Bush, eager for victory 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON John Kerry scored victories in Democratic primaries in Virginia and Tennessee on Tuesday by tapping into voter anger and dissatisfac­tion with President Bush, especially among those eager to win in November, accord­ing to Associated Press exit polls. 
The Massachusetts senator discovered the same hunger among Southern state pri­mary voters for victory in November and displeasure with the incumbent that he found among voters else­where in the country in a string of victories since the presidential contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. 
Kerry ran very strong among those who said the most important quality for a candidate was the ability to defeat Bush -claiming three·-fourths of the Virginia voters who said that quality was most important and almost two-thirds of Tennessee voters who want­ed to support a general elec­tion winner. 
None of hi-s rivals were even close among those vot­ers-about three in 10 of all Virginia voters and one­fourth of all Tennessee vot­ers. Kerry also ran strong in both states among voters who thought experience was the top quality. 
The economy and jobs were top issues in both states. And the ability to beat Bush was a quality many voters were looking for in both states. 
Michelle Darby, 34, a mar­keting manager for an insur­ance company in Roanoke, Va., said she voted for Kerry because she wants to see a victory by "anybody but George Bush ... electability." 
"I like what (Kerry) stands for," she said. "John Edwards is a little too young. (Howard) Dean's a crazy man. (Wesley) Clark's just, I don't know, there's some­
thing there I don't like." 
Kerry drew strong support from Virginia and Tennessee voters who said health care was the top issue -about one-fifth of-all voters. 
The economy and jobs were the most important issue for voters in both states ­picked by one-third in Virginia and slightly more in Tennessee. Kerry led with almost half of that group in Virginia compared to one­third for Edwards, a senator from North Carolina. 
In Tennessee, Kerry got four in 10 while Edwards got more than a third of those who saw the economy and

jobs as the top issue. 
The results come from exit polls in both states conduct­ed for the AP and the televi­sion networks by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International. 
The Virginia results of 1,256 interviews were sub­ject to sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, higher for subgroups. The Tennessee results from 1,920 interviews were sub­ject to sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, larger for subgroups. 
Kerry had the largest share of support from most voter groups in both states, but was especially strong among black voters, who made up one-third of the Virginia. electorate and one-fifth of the Tennessee electorate. 
Kerry had almost two-

thirds of the black vote in Tenn., said he voted for Virginia and about half of the Clark -but would vote for black vote in Tennessee. Bush in the general election 
The two Southern pri­maries gave Kerry's cam­paign fodder for the argument that he could attract black voters, a key Democratic con­stituency. But they made a less convincing case about his ability to attract Southern whites, generally a mod­erate to conser­vative-leaning group.

Edwards gave Kerry the strongest com­

Margaret Gerardin, a 41­year-old 
supporter from 
independent from Memphis, Norfolk, Va., said she decid­
ed at the last second to vote for Edwards because she feels like he is more in touch "with the common man." 
Kerry and Edwards tied among Virginia voters who said it was most important to have a candidate who cares about people like them, while Edwards edged Kerry among Tennessee voters who said that was most important. 
Clark showed more strength among Virginia and Tennessee voters who thought national security and the war in Iraq were top issues than he did among voters who picked other issues. 
Dean did somewhat better among voters in both states who said it was most impor­tant to have a candidate who stands up for what he believes.

Debate on gay-marriage ban brings lobbyists 
Gay-rights activists, conservative leaders converge on Mass. statehouse 

BOSTON Gay-rights activists. conservative leaders and media from around the globe conv1~rged on the Massachusetts Statehouse for a historic session Wednesday in which lawmakers will take up a constitutional amend­ment to ban gay marriage. 
As the hours ticked down, S1~nate leaders feverishly sought a middle ground, pro­posing a compromise that would ban same-sex marriage hut establish civil unions. 
"We should not engage in a divisive, all-or-nothing debate that may end by eliminating all rights for same-sex cou­ples," Democratic Senate President Hobert Travaglini and Hepublican Senate Minority Leader Brian Lees wrote fellow lawmakers Tuesday. 
The compromise prompted almost immediate criticism. including from House Speaker Thomas Finneran, who called it "highly inappropriate" to use an amendment to craft legislation or pass new law ­like one establishing civil unions. 
The gay-marriage issue has created an unprecedented spectacle at the Capitol: As many as 4,000 spectators and 300 media members are expected to attend the start of the constitutional convention. and a furious lobbying effort was already under way. 
Christian conservatives used a dolly to haul in more than 18,000 petitions signed by citi­zens from across the country urging lawmakers to pass the amendment. 
Meanwhile, children of gay couples traveled to the Statehouse to plead with the

will meet together to consider 
10 proposed constitutional 
amendments. The gay-mar­
riage issue is ncar the bottom 
of the agenda and might not 
get to a !'ina! vote for days. 
Another proposal on the agenda is an amendment that could require the state's judges to be elected rather than appointed -an issue that has taken on added sig­nificance because of the court's polarizing stance on gay marriage. 
If approved by thn Legislature during this ses­sion, the gay-marriage amend­ment would have to again be ratified by lawmakers during the 2005-06 session before it could wind up on the November 2006 ballot. 
The last time Massachusetts 
lawmakers in the heavily 
Homan Catholic state had a 
chance to weigh in on the 
issun of gay marriagn was in 
2002, when the constitutional 
convention was gaveled to a 
close before any vote took 
place. Ncar-brawls erupted 
among citizens who attended 
and raised voices were heard 
in the normally sedate cham­
ber. 
The Senate president at the time used parliamentary pro­cedures to prevent a debate or vote on the gay-marriage ban. Travaglini, who does not sup­port gay marriage but is in favor of civil unions, promised not to use such maneuvering this time. 
On Tuesday. lawmakers cir­culated proposed changes to the amendment. hoping to secure the necessary 101 votes among the 199 sitting lawmakers to get it passed. The proposed compromise establishing civil unions had critics on both sides of the issue. 
"We find that reprehensi­ble," said Hon Crews. presi­dent of the Massachusetts Family Institute. which oppos­es gay marriage. "We need legislators who will have the courage to take a stand to pre­serve and protect marriage as it is currently worded. Wn would encourage the legisla­ture not to cloud this with any other language at this date." 
Gay-rights advocates said the compromise docs nothing but camouflage a bigoted amendment. 
"At the end of the day, they're writing discrimination into the constitution and put­ting a fresh coat of paint on it." said Amy Hunt. director of the LGBT Aging Projnct, a state gay-rights group. 
''I've never seen like this." said Charles Hasmussen. spokesman for Finneran. a Democrat who supports the amendment. "And I'm told this building has never seen this kind of scrutiny from the nation­al media that anyone can remember."

S.D. 111ulls ban on abortion

PIERRE, S.D. -The House passed a bill Thesday that would outlaw most abortions in South Dakota, but opponents said it would do nothing but cost taxpay­ers money ifit becomes law. 
The bill, passed 54-15, would outlaw abortion unless a mother's life is in danger. It makes no exceptions for rape victims or women who could suffer perma­nent serious health problems by having babies. 
"When we're considering an innocent life, the health of the mother is not a substantial enough justification to take the innocent life," said Republican Rep. Matt McCaulley, chief spon­sor of the bill.

Canines compete for top dog at Westminster 
Associ~ted Preu 
NEW YOBK-With so many top dogs in town, any win at Westminster is a big deal. So it made perfect sense that Karen Mammano let out a playful yelp when the judge picked her American water spaniel. 
No mattnr that Shane was the only American water spaniel in the show. 
"Yeah. it was a little strange being out there all by ourselves," Mammano said after taking best of breed. "But hey, I'll take an automatic win." 
I lours later, thn competition got a lot tougher at America's most prestigious canine event. Of the 2,624 dogs entered, only a handful were left in the running for best in show heading into '1\Jcsday night. 
Josh, a bounding, shiny black Newfoundland, figured to be the favorite among the crowd of 15,000 or so at Madison Square Garden. Big dogs always attract a lot of attention, although a sprightly Norfolk terrier named Coco had been almost unbeatable on the recent show circuit. 
A primped, above-it-all Pekingese and a stylish, shaved standard poodle also earned their way into the final seven with group wins Monday. An lbizan hound named Bunny -she has a white patch in the shape of the Playboy symbol on her back ­was a repeat winner Tuesday night in the hound group and a Sussex spaniel won the sporting 
).,TfOUp. 
Josh spent part of the day nap­ping in his crate, kept cool by a pair of huge circular fans. His owners planned to take him on a long walk to relax. 
"We've got to get him out of here," co-owner Peggy Helming said. 
Mikimoto on Fifth, the poodle with purple rollers in his hair, pre­pared for the big night with a little entertainment. With his paws, he played pattycake with owner Karen LeFrak. 
Keeping a dog -and its owner and handler -calm on the big day can be a doggone difficult task. Along with more than a thousand dogs in the holding area, there is a crush of people strolling backstage to look at the pooches and buy a bevy of pet products. 
"It's not an ideal situation," admitted handler Bill McFadden, who guided a Kerry blue terrier named Mick to the best in show title last year. "Sometimes, you have to take the dogs down the ramp to stretch their legs. It's cool­er down there, and the fresh air helps." 
Just in case of an emergency, Westminster keeps veterinarians on call in a Garden office right behind the ring. The vets work in two-person teams in three-hour shills. 
"Most of the problems are stress-related," vet George Korin said. "We haven't had anything too serious." ­
Mark Salemi said the biggest trauma he recalled came when a Bernese mountain dog jumped out of its crate and caught a nail that bled profusely. 


Often times, the vets wind up soothing the nerves of the owners and handlers. 
"That can be a big part of it," Salemi said. 
One dog that missed out because of an injury was a low­chen named Napoleon. Three weeks ago, a pit bull-lab mix got into the family's backyard in Lawton, Okla., and broke its leg. 

Still, 8-year-old handler Rachel Skaggs, her brother and her mother came with Napoleon as special guests of Westminster. 
"He's a brat, and so am 1," Rachel said, holding her pet. 
"We're going to come back here next year." 
Mammano had it easy in the afternoon. Though five American water spaniels were entered, hers was the lone one that showed up. 
"I've never seen it at Westminster," said Mammano, a longtime handler.

A liberal's liberal 

Let's call a spade a spade here. John Kerry is a liberal's liberal. Barring a political meltdown even more embar­rassing than Howard Dean's "I Have a Scream" speech, the current Democratic fron­trunner will win his Joe Licandro party's nomination. But despite cruising his way to victory, 
The Licandro
this might not be a 
Non-Factor
good thing for a shaky Democratic party that can ill-afford for President Bush to capture re­election this November. 
Unlike Bill Clinton's meteoric rise from out of nowhere in 1992, there is just not an overwhelming sense amongst moderate Democratic voters who comprise the party's majority that Kerry represents their best interests. Clinton secured the Democratic nomi­nation by distinguishing himself as a centrist Washington outsider disen­chanted with the extremely liberal direction in which his party was head­ed. 
Kerry, no matter how hard he will try in the coming months to portray himself otherwise, is guilty of steering the ship in that extremely liberal direction. Americans for Democratic Action, the self-described nation's oldest liberal lobbying organization, gives Kerry a lifetime rating of 93 percent. That's considerably higher than any other candidate in the field. So high that lib­eral dinosaur Ted Kennedy, who has a rating of only 88 percent, actually holds the title as the conservative senator from Massachusetts. Anyone who can make Ted Kennedy seem conservative should be cause for serious apprehen­sion. 
This primary has not exactly been one of those difficult process-of-elimi­nation tests. Amidst an overly crowded field of political nobodys and light­weights, Democrats are choosing Kerry by default. Despite Time Magazine and 
U.S. News and World Report's best efforts to drum up support for Howard Dean by placing the not-so-good doctor on their covers virtually every week over the last couple of months of 2003, the former Governor of Vermont proved to be an arrogant blowhard. 
Reasonable Democrats knew the American people were never going to elect a chronic finger-pointing-at-the­camera, left-winged radical whose face grew so red every time he spoke that it looked like he was choking on a piece of rotisserie chicken. The campaigns of Carol Moseley Braun, AI Sharpton and Dennis Kucinich were jokes, and that's putting it nicely. 
Even though Madonna and other lib­eral Hollywood entertainers publicly endorsed him, General Wesley Clark lacks both the experience and the per­sonality to play with the big boys. John Edwards, a rising star in the Democratic party, is a respectable guy, but too overly ambitious. For an ex-trial lawyer who has yet to complete a full term as Senator, he does not hold enough political clout yet to be elected President. His best chance might be four years later. But as it stands now, Edwards, regardless of his political fate in the primaries, will fade into oblivion because he will not be defending his Senate seat in 2004. 

Thus, the Democrats will nominate John Kerry not for his charisma or any dynamic political agenda, but because, as his current campaign states, "I am the only candidate who can defeat Bush." That is a scary thought, not just for the radical right wing but for mid­dle-of-the-road voters like the majority of us. 
True to the liberal mantra, Kerry believes the government should coddle the dredges of society. He voted against mandatory prison sentences for drug dealers who sell to children. He 
If his past voting record is any indica­tion, Kerry is anything but tough. Despite sitting on the Senate Intelligence committee and being privy to highly classified information reveal­ing looming security threats to the United States, he has routinely voted for military and intelligence spending cuts throughout his time in office. Kerry was also one of only a few senators to vote against the first Iraq war. In 2002, he did an about-face, voting for the Iraq war resolution, but has repeatedly criti­cized President Bush for making the decision to go to war ever since. Kerry has justified this contradiction by say­ing he voted "to threaten the use of force to make Saddam Hussein comply with the resolutions of the United 
Nations," not necessarily to go to

the line of conservatism making dis­paraging remarks about the merits of affirmative action while vocalizing sup­port for school vouchers, as well. But these are issues for the Supreme Court to decide, not the United States Senate. And given that a liberal judge who would protect abortion rights would probably not strike down affirmative action or uphold school vouchers, Kerry's conservative talk is cheap. With the possibility of as many as four cur­rent Supreme Court justices retiring in the next four years, this next election will determine the social direction of this country. Voters should not forget the type of liberal, activist justices Kerry will surely appoint. 
While social issues will be critical in this election, no issue will take more precedence than national security. Judging by his comments on the cam­paign trail, Kerry does not seem to know where he stands. Kerry deserves the utmost respect for serving in the Vietnam War, but this does not auto­matically make him a better candidate than President Bush in this area. 
Not that their support should matter anyways. The United States should never have to ask another country's permission to defend ourselves. 
Most alarming, though, is Kerry's claim that the Bush Administration has exaggerated the terrorist threat to the United States. Does Kerry suffer from amnesia? Has he already forgotten the over three thousand Americans that tragically died on 9/11? Not only are Kerry's comments cruelly insensitive to the families of these victims, but they are also frighteningly naive. 
In the coming months, John Kerry will try to paint himself as a moderate to the American people. But we know better. He's a liberal's liberal, and our nation will suffer if he is elected President.

Bengal Bouts support Holy Cross Missionaries

But they could not have imagined that the largest single donation to their apostolate every year would be gen­erated by Notre Dame students majoring in pugilistic science. 
The Holy Cross Brothers, under Brother Alan McNeil, CSC, organized a Notre Dame boxing tournament in I 920 to support the Bengal Missions. With the encouragement of Knute Hockne, that program developed. In 1931, Dominic (Nappy) Napolitano organized the Bengal Bouts in the form in which they have continued for 74 years. 
In 2003, the Bouts contributed $44,000 to the Bengal Missions. This year. 143 boxers will try to beat that total. 
The student officers of the Boxing Club run the program under the supervision of Hich O'Leary and Dave Brown of the Club Sports office. The senior captains are Pat Dillon, Tommy Demko, Stefan Borovina, Billy Zizic and Tony Hollowell. The junior captains are Nathan Lohmeyer, Jim Christoforetti and Galen Loughrey. Each boxer is a fund-raiser, selling tickets and pro­gram ads. But the brains of the out­fit, and the key to its financial sue­cess, are the student managers, Kristin Boyd, Ashley Merusi and Rachel Anderson, who are taking the administrative and business end of the Bouts to a new level. 
This unique athletic phenomenon could happen only at Notre Dame. "The Bengal Bouts," wrote Chicago sports columnist Bill Gleason, "are as purely amateur as a sport can be." The head coaches are Chicago attorney Terry Johnson, Columbus, Ohio developer Tom Suddes and Pat Farrell, the University pilot. All are former Bengals champs. 
"We teach tradi­tional, stand-up style boxing," said Johnson, "the same way Nappy taught it for 50 years. We approach box­ing as a sport, not as a fight. The guys understand this and are dedi­cated to sportsmanship, cama­raderie and boxing for the mis­sions." 
In a workout led by Tom Suddes, the boxers count push-ups and sit­

lETTER TO THE EDITOR 
'Monologues' not what we need 

I am a woman. I have never been sexually abused but have close rela­tives and friends who have been. I have read the "Monologues:" With that said. upon reading the "Monologues," I was deeply offended and felt that my femininity was grievously degraded. I have been saddened to sec so many of my sis­ters in Christ promoting them as a means of empowering women. 
What is needed to combat violence against women in the world is a complete paradigm shift. We, as women and men created in the image of God, need to stop seeing women as objects, as mere products of negative experiences, or as a body part, and start seeing them as whole persons, as beautiful expres­sions of God's love. 
Then, and only then, will women start respecting themselves, not for the control they can have over their bodies, not for the pleasure they can give themselves, not for the power they can have over men, but because they are created and radi­cally loved by God. If we aim to eliminate all forms of violence against women, we should hardly employ violence as our means. The "Monologues" are violent emotional­ly, psychologically and spiritually. If we see women as having intrinsic, God-given dignity, then we should highlight that dignity and not do fur­ther damage to it. 
Even if the content of the "Monologues" was not violent, in many places where they are shown (although not at Notre Dame) some of the proceeds go to Planned Parenthood, which through its unqualified support of abortion and contraception completely under­mines the value and dignity of women in this country. Even though the proceeds from Notre Dame's show will not go to Planned Parenthood, an injustice to women ~nywhere is an injustice to women everywhere. 
I encourage all women on this campus to re-examine the way they view themselves and their sisters (and brothers) in Christ. We deserve better than the "Monologues." 
Let's look to the Blessed Mother for a monologue that is truly empowering.

ups by the hundred and Tom does every one of them himself (almost). "The Bouts are special," notes Suddes, "because you may end up in the ring with your best friend and after the final bell your relationship and mutual respect are stronger than before you put on the gloves." The assistant coaches, all volunteers, include Sweet 
C. Robinson, 
of the Berrien Springs 
police depart­ment, and former boxers Hyan Rans, Chip Farrell, 
Tom 
Biolchini, Jeff Dobosh and Roland 
Chamblee, a Superior 
Court Judge and four-time Bengals champ 
who may be the only active judge who also serves as 
cornerman in a boxing ring. 
Holy Mother Church is in the act with the chaplains, Fr. Bill Seetch, CSC and Fr. Brian Daley, S.J., who is also a coach. They both work out with the boxers. And the timer is Msgr. John Hagerty, appro­priately of Notre Dame parish in Hermitage, Penn. 
The primary emphasis of the pro­gram is safety. "We have never had a serious injury," said captain Pat Dillon, "and we aim to keep it that way." 
Dr. James Moriarity. University chief of medicine, closely supervises every phase of the program. EMTs are present at all contact practices. Trainer Jack Zimmerman, who is incidentally a published poet, car­ries on the exacting standard of care established by Jack Mooney, the head trainer for decades, who was literally Knute Rockne's paper boy and who. at 93 years young, still maintains his interest in his boys. 
The Bengal Bouts will be held in five sessions, all in the JACC Field House: Feb 25, Feb. 26, March 1 and March 3. all at 6:30p.m., and, in a return to an old tradition, the finals will be held on St. Patrick's Day, March 17 at 8 p.m. 
The money raised by the Bouts, said Mission Director Fr. David L. Schlaver, CSC, "enables many to earn a living, provide medical care and housing for their families and educate their children for life-and survival-in a difficult society." 
We hope the members of1he Notre Dame community will continue their strong support for this superb cause on this 150th anniversary of the Bengal Missions. We welcome you to visit the practices in the JACC Boxing Room any weekday from 4 to 6 p.m. You will be impressed. And maybe even surprised.

MOVIE REVIEW 
Hockey never looked so good 
By ANN FLIES 
Scene Movie Critic 
Considering the long history of sports films, new .movies in this genre must be extra special in order to catch the nyc of weary movie-going audi­ences. Miracle is special. 
Miracle is the true story of the 1980 United States Olympic llockey team. At a time when life amid Cold War fears was looking dismal, the hockey team was not looked upon as a bright spot. The Soviet Union's long-stand­ing tradition of gold medal victories at the Olympics was unmatched, while the United States was not even regarded as

Although the film as a whole is mag­nificent, a few weak areas stand out. Jim Craig's (Eddie Cahill) and Brooks's family dealings are basically the only personal struggles set out in the film, which may be because they are the only two who have a level of acting skill. Those actors playing the athletes arc good at the hockey portion of Miracle but sputter through portions that come close to the realm of drama. This is especially evident early in the film where a scene in a pub calling for a heated argument lacks any form of emotion.

As the plot unfolds, the audience watches the trials the team encoun­ters as the players learn what is involved in becoming a great team. Coach Brooks makes life even more difficult for the players with his rigor­ous training plan. Viewers are able to connect with the team as they endure 
during crucial 
moments. 

One of the truly outstanding quali­ties of Miracle is its ability to put the viewer into the action. The movement, energy and excitement of hockey are readily evident; a viewer was heard to comment that, "If you didn't like hock­ey before the movie, you will love it after." 
In spite of the fact that most viewers already know the outcome of the game, the natural momentum of the storyline keeps the suspense and excitement in place. The movie wisely reaches a crescendo with the Soviet Union game, where great camera placement captures every second of the action. Even those who are not appreciative of the game will find enjoyment in the memorable quotes and prevailing feeling of team unity. 

Overall, Miracle is an incredible

thrill ride echoing past movie favorites such as The Mighty Ducks, but with a more mature and intense twist.

DVD REVIEW 
Explosive finale for the 'Desperado' trilogy 
By MARK BEMENDERFER 
Scene DVD Critic 
Before I review Once Upon A Time in Mexico, it is my duty to enlighten the faithful reader why Hobert Rodriguez is the man. llis first film in the El Mariachi trilogy was filmed on a shoe­string budget. But it was good enough and showed enough potential that he got to do a sequel, called Desperado, an action smash starring Antonio Banderas and Selma Hayek. After that, he directed a variety of films ranging from the vampire western From Dusk till Dawn, starring George Clooney to the kid movie trilogy Spy Kids. 
lie was successful enough from all of those films that he got to direct the last part of his action trilogy, Once Upon A Time in Mexico. He was so successful from his previous films that he was able to snag some very big name actors for the movie and not just his regulars (Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Cheech Marin, etc.). 

both top-notch. Shots are heard nice and clear, along with any other sound worth men­tioning. Video looks ter­rific with no discol­oration or darkness ­it is a rather superior DVD. 
However, one of the best things on the DVD is on the special fea­

Rodriguez's latest movie is practically bursting with all the stars in it, including Johnny Depp, Enrique Iglesias and Willem Dafoe. Rodriguez knows what he does well, and because of that he gets what he wants. 
This leads us to the movie, Once Upon A Time in Mexico. For starters. you don't need to have seen the previ­ous ones to understand what is going on in this one, although it helps because you notice all of the returning actors, including ones that were killed in previous movies. It is also the deep­est one of the trilogy, which seems to contrast with its action based nature. Desperado was centered basically on the Mariachi character (also known as El). This time around, the number of characters almost seems overwhelm­ing, which they are on the first view­ing of the movie. It improves upon a second viewing, which is almost required as only the most astute movie watcher will catch everything in the movie the first time. For example, see if you can find the second charac­ter that Depp plays.

tures. It comes with all the staples, such as director's commentary, delet­ed scenes and such. Rodriguez also hosts a special feature called "Ten­Minute Flick School" in which he shares insights with aspiring direc­tors. 
The best special feature on the DVD, however, is titled "Ten-Minute Cooking School," starring Robert Rodriguez. In this little feature, the director shows us how to cook the slow roasted pork showcased in the movie and obsessed about by Johnny Depp's character. The four hours it takes to cook may turn off some, but others may be tempted into trying the recipe by Depp. 
This movie isn't perfect by any means. but what it does it does well.

Depp turns in an awesome perform­ance, Banderas blows away bad guys with style and Dafoe is great as a deplorable villain. It's the deepest one of the trilogy, but bear in mind, it's still an action movie.

Nets post ninth straight win under new coach 
Associated Press 
Even a little adversity isn't too much for the New Jersey Nets to overcome under new wonder coach Lawrence Frank. ·

This was probably the tough­

est one for Frank, who replaced Byron Scott more than two weeks ago. The Nets fell behind by 13 points after the first quar­ter and the 33-year-old coach scolded his team between peri­ods. 
"That's probably the most angry I've seen him," starting center Aaron Williams said. "You have to do that sometimes. We weren't playing the way we were supposed to play. That's his job." 
Frank downplayed his talk between periods, insisting he did a poor job of coaching in the opening quarter when the Nets fell behind. 
He shifted the credit to his team for picking up their play. 
"Our guys did a terrific job, mixing up man and zone cover­age," Frank said. "They really worked their tails off." 
Frank's 8-0 start is tied for the second best in NBA history with Pistons coach Larry Brown. It is one shy of the mark for best coaching start shared by Kurt Rambis (Los Angeles Lakers, 1998-99) and Buddy Jeannette (Baltimore Bullets, 1947 -48). 
Frank will get a chance to tie the record on Wednesday in a game against LeBron James and the Cavaliers in Cleveland. 
"He doesn't care about that," said Jason Kidd, who added 16 points, nine rebounds and nine assists in a gritty 43-minute per­formance. "He wants to win. he doesn't care about going unde­feated. He wants to win every time we go on the floor." 
Kenyon Martin added 13 points and eight rebounds and Kerry Kittles had 17 points as the Nets posted their ninth straight double-digit win and sent the Pistons to their fourth straight loss. 
"We're just flat out not getting it done," said Piston All Star Ben Wallace, who had 13 points and 12 rebounds. "We came out in the first quarter and played pretty decent. After that, every­thing was down hill." 
Chauncey Billups had 23 points and Richard Hamilton added 19 for Detroit, which made only 18 field goals in the final three quarters after mak­ing 12 in the first, when the shot

"We didn't have a lot of guys matching their energy. That's my responsibility," Brown said. "I never thought I'd have to coach effort. It seems to me in a lot of games, we have to coach effort."

About halfway through the second quarter; the Nets finally got some stops on defense and than got their transition game going. New Jersey closed the quarter with a 14-0 run and took a 46-42 lead. Detroit missed its final10 shots. 
Jefferson was outstanding in the run. He scored eight points and ignited the run with an ally­oop lay-in of a Martin pass that might have been offensive goal­tending. 
Kidd had 10 points in the third quarter when New Jersey opened a 71-62 lead. The Nets nailed down the win, holding the Pistons to five points in the final 7:30. 
Hamilton scored 11 points and the Pistons held the Nets to just 6-for-25 shooting from the field in taking a 29-16 lead after the first quarter. 
Lakers 98, Heat 83 
Derek Fisher caught a long outlet pass, then sent a back­ward, between-his-legs bounce pass to Gary Payton for an uncontested layup in the waning seconds. 
It wasn't the only thing Fisher made look easy Tuesday night. 
Fisher went on a personal 8-0 run over a 2:28 span of the fourth quarter, capping off his season-high 18-point effort and lifting the Los Angeles Lakers past the Miami Heat 98-83. 
Miami never led in the second half, yet clawed its way within one on three separate occasions -the last coming on Hafer Alston's 3-pointer with 7:17 remaining, a shot that brought the Heat within 78-77. 
Fisher scored the next eight, and the Lakers never looked back in recording consecutive wins for the first time since mid­January. 
"I had to wait for some oppor­tunities to come around," Fisher said. "I worked up a sweat and I felt good. I like playing here. I'm from Arkansas. Humidity is my friend. Once I got loosened up, I felt pretty good." 
Shaquille O'Neal had 25 points and Payton and Devean George each had 17 for the Lakers, who overcame an early 14-point deficit. O'Neal had 19 of his points in the second half on 9­for-12 shooting, saying he was sparked by a back-and-forth series with Heat reserve Malik Allen. 
A bit of jostling resulted in a double technical for both play­ers. and O;Neal scoring 10 points in a brief third-quarter flurry. 
"He awokened a sleeping giant. I know that's not a word," O'Neal said. 
Dwyane Wade had 19 points for Miami, which dropped its fifth straight-the team's worst slide since opening the season with seven consecutive losses. Miami (21-32) is now a season­worst 11 games under .500, and dropped two games behind idle Boston in the race for the Eastern Conference's final play­off spot. 
Lamar Odom narrowly missed a triple-double, finishing with 13 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists for Miami. Eddie Jones also had 13 for the Heat, which was outrebounded 44-37. 
"I take this loss on myself," Odom said. "''ve got to have a much better, much more pro­ductive game than that. I wasn't Lamar tonight. I let this one get away." 
The Lakers were again with­out All-Star guard Kobe Bryant, who missed his seventh game because of a lacerated right index finger. Ultimately, they didn't need him.

SALT LAKE CITY -Rick Majerus said Tuesday he will not coach the University of Utah again this season, ending his 15-year association with the school he brought to national prominence. 
"No. I won't come back this year, and I won't coach next year for sure," Majerus told ESPN. 
He also ruled out coaching Utah in the future. 
"They need to hire a coach," Majerus said. "I've divorced myself from this." 
Apparently, the decision was not Majerus' alone. 
"His doctor told him that under no circumstances was he coming back this year," Majerus' attorney, Bob Henderson, told The Associated Press. 
Majerus did not immediately return a phone message to the AP left through Henderson. 
Majerus left the team on Jan. 28 because of heart problems. 
He had said he would retire at the end of the season, how­ever, both he and the university left open the chance he would still return to coach this sea" son. 
Majerus has not told the uni­versity that he would not return, athletic director Chris Hill told AP on Tuesday. However, he said officials have been in contact with some of Majerus' closest friends. 
"We have every indication that is what he was planning," Hill said of Majerus' decision. "That fits in line with conversa­tions we've had." 
Assistant coach Kerry Hupp has led Utah (18-5) to a 3-0 mark since Majerus left. 
"We're going to leave every­thing the way it is," Hill said. "We've won three in a row, and we don't want to interfere with that success."

NFL asks for suspension of high school draft decision 
Associated Press 

-The NFL asked a judge Tuesday to suspend her c:!ecision to allow high school players into the draft, arguing that an onslaught of teenagers would harm the league, its athletes and college football. 
U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin issued her ruling last Thursday in a lawsuit by Ohio State running back Maurice Clarett, a 20-year-old sophomore who played just one season in college before trying to enter the draft. 
The NFL asked the judge for a stay while it appeals, saying a higher court may not be able to rule before the April draft. 
"Absent a stay, countless col­lege underclassmen, as well as high school students who lack the physical and psychological matu­rity to succeed in professional football. will be encouraged pre­maturely to declare themselves eligible for the NFL draft," it said. 
At issue is a league rule that a player must be out of high school for three years before he is eligi­ble for the draft. 
The NFL argued that fue rule is for the young players' own good: It is designed to make sure they are big enough and strong enough to play with the pros. 

The league said "immediate enforcement of the court ruling will encourage teenage athletes to overtrain -or worse -to use steroids or dangerous nutritional supplements in the hope of rapid­ly developing the strength and speed required to compete in the NFL." 
Scheindlin, however, said the eligibility rule violates antitrust law by denying young athletes the right to market their talents. 
The NFL has set a March 1 deadline for high school players and college underclassmen to apply for the draft, pending its appeal. 
The league said that without a stay, its 32 clubs will be forced to evaluate and interview a large number of prospective NFL play­ers. 
Those players then would sac­rifice their scholarships and edu­cation for an uncertain future, ultimately perhaps displacing NFL veterans. 
"There would also be corre­sponding serious, disruptive and irreparable effects on the college football programs that invested substantial sums in recruiting these players and fostering their athletic development," the NFL said. 
"Any veterans who lose their jobs "would have no remedy if tis court's ruling were ultimately reversed." 

The NFL said it will appeal Scheindlin's ruling to the 2nd 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals regardless of whether the judge agrees to suspend her ruling. 
The league cited what it called a "substantial possibility that the Second Circuit will have a differ-

ent view on the merits." 
Alan Milstein, a lawyer for Clarett, said the NFI.:s arguments were frivolous. "How are they irreparably harmed by letting Maurice in? I think it's ridiculous to even go through this," he said. 
Clarett led the Buckeyes to the 2002 national championship. He was barred from playing in the 2003 season for accepting 
Fresh Cuts! Red andWhite Tulips #F079 
improper benefits from a family friend and then lying to investiga­tors about it. 
Clarett has not said whether he would enter the draft because he still might want to return to col­lege. Ohio State would have to petition the NCAA to allow Clarett to return for the 2004 season, and it is unclear whether the school would succeed.

Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Purdue's 
unquestioned leader is about to 
return from a three-game 
absence, and it couldn't come at 
a better time for the reeling 
Boilermakers. 
Purdue coach Gene Keady said he expects forward Kenneth Lowe to play on Wednesday against Northwestern after missing three games with a sprained left elbow. 
Lowe was injured in a loss to Indiana on Jan. 27. The Boilermakers (15-7, 5-4 Big Ten) went 1-2 without him and have lost three of their last four games. 
"After the (Michigan) game, he felt like his progress was good enough," Keady said. 
Lowe participated in light workouts at practice last week and, depending upon how he looks before Wednesday's game against Northwestern, Lowe could start or come off the bench. 
His return is good news for a team that desperately needs some. The Boilermakers went to Bloomington on Jan. 27 play­ing for the lead in the Big Ten. The emotional loss sent them into a tailspin from which they have yet to recover. 
Mental breakdowns against Michigan and Ohio State, among others, have reduced the Boilermakers from Big Ten title contenders to a team need­ing a victory to get back on track. 
"We haven't had a lot of good things happen to us," Keady said. "This is a good thing. I hope he gives us a jolt, some positive reinforcement." 
The latest disappointment came Saturday when Courtney Sims tipped in a rebound with 
1.4 seconds left to lift Michigan over Purdue. Keady said a win in Ann Arbor, Mich., would have given the Boilermakers a solid shot at winning the Big Ten title. 
Instead, the loss has instilled a sense of urgency, starting with the game against the dan­"Now you have to win six in a 
-
row," Keady told his players. 
The first one, he said, will be no easy task. The Wildcats (9­11, 4-5) used an aggressive matchup zone defense to thump then-No. 14 Wisconsin 69-51 on Saturday. 
"We have a chance to run for 
the championship and we have 
to make a long run here." 
Keady said. "Our goal is to play 
that last game for the champi­
onship. We're worried about 

Northwestern and that's it, bot­-­
tom line." 
Leading the way for Northwestern is guard Jitim Young, who is fourth in the Big Ten in scoring with 18.1 points a game. He scored 17 in Northwestern's big win over the Badgers. 
"Young is one of the best war­riors in the league," Keady said. "lie's strong, understands the coach's offense. He does so many good things, just plays hard all the time." 
The Wildcats also run a ver­sion of the Princeton offense, a complicated motion o!Tense fea­turing screens and backdoor cuts. Combined with the unique matchup zone defense, it makes preparing for them a difficult prospect, which is only com­pounded by Purdue's injuries and suspensions. 

"Our kids understand they can beat us," Keady said. "They have great balance. We just respect the heck out of them. They have a lot of confidence after beating Wisconsin." 
Even though Lowe will play, he said he won't be 100 per­cent. Swingman Melvin Buckley is also nursing a sprained ankle and Chris Booker was recently ruled academically ineligible. 

Keady openly wondered this week why folks have the impression that the Boilermakers don't have the same personnel problems as other teams in the Big Ten, then added a little levity to his com­plaint. 
"Somebody needs to coach the announcers," he said. "We have three guys out, physically, and about 10 guys out mental­

"No matter who's struggling, who's doing well, both teams are going to be up for it. It should be a pressure cooker." Adding to the mix will be the likely appearance in the Manchester City lineup of mid­fielder Claudio Reyna, the U.S. national team captain. Howard and Reyna are among six Americans playing regularly in England's top league, joined by goalkeepers Kasey Keller (Tottenham) and Brad Friedel (Blackburn), defender Carlos Bocanegra and forward Brian McBride (both Fulham). Manchester United, which has won eight of the last 11 league titles, is two points behind unbeaten Arsenal. United also faces Portugal's Porto this month in the next round of the European Champions Cup. "Success is really determined by how much silverware you win at this club," Howard said. The recent defensive trou­bles at Manchester United coincide with a bitter off-field feud between manager Alex Ferguson and the club's major shareholders, Irish race horse owners John Magnier and J.P. McManus. · Among the deals under scrutiny is Howard's $3.6 mil­lion move from the MetroStars. A six-figure sum was allegedly paid to an agent who is a busi­ness partner of Ferguson's son, Jason. "My agent and I have said what we needed to say," Howard said. "Our slate is clean, we're sure of that." Howard will join the U.S. national team for an exhibition game in the Netherlands on Feb. 18. His performances for United have established him as a strong contender to beat out Friedel and Keller as America's No. 1 goalkeeper.

IN BRIEF 

Johnson falls to Expos in 
salary arbitration 
NEW YORK -Baseball owners improved to 2-0 in salary arbitration when the Montreal Expos defeated first baseman Nick Johnson on Tuesday. 
Kevin Millwood, who had been scheduled for a hearing Friday, set­tled his case with Philadelphia, agreeing to an $11 million, one-year contract, a raise of $1.1 million. 
Among free agents, Fred McGriff agreed to a minor league contract with Tampa Bay, and Seattle agreed to minor league deals with Terry Mulholland and Eric Owens. 
Johnson, acquired from the New York Yankees in December's trade for Javier Vazquez, will made $1.25 mil­lion instead of the $1.68 million he had sought. He made $364,100 last season, when he hit .. 284 with 14 homers, 47 RBis and 70 walks in 324 at-bats. 
Arbitrators Roger Kaplan, Jack Clarke and Christine Knowlton made their decision one day after listening to arguments in Phoenix. Last week, pitcher Chris Reitsma lost to Cincinnati. Fifteen players remain scheduled for hearings. 
Millwood, 14-12 with a 4.01 ERA for the Phillies last year, had been seeking $12.5 million while the team had been offering $10 million. 
McGriff, 40, would get a contract for the $300,000 minimum if he is added to the major league roster of the Devil Rays, his hometown team. He is nine homers short of 500. 
"We're going to give him an oppor­tunity to showcase his wares," gener­al manager Chuck LaMar said, adding that it will be difficult for McGriff to make Tampa Bay's roster unless the Devil Rays have injuries in spring training. 
McGriff played 3 1/2 seasons for the Devil Rays before he was dealt to the Chicago Cubs in July 2001. The hope is he will show enough this spring to attract interest from other teams. 
"I just need to play," said McGriff, slowed by groin and knee injuries last year. ''I'm getting more and more confident every day that I'll be fine." 
Indiana's Ewing deemed 
academically ineligible 

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -Indiana forward Pat Ewing Jr. will not play against Penn State on Wednesday because of his academic perform­ance. 
The school on Tuesday did not release any details of Ewing's t-ou­bles, but said that he would not travel with the team to Pennsylvania for the Hoosiers' game against the Nittany Lions. 
Ewing, a freshman and the son of former NBA star Patrick Ewing, is averaging 2.8 points and 3.3 rebounds in 20 games this season for Indiana (11-9, 5-4 Big Ten). He has started six games. 
Indiana coach Mike Davis issued a statement saying Ewing will be missed, but academics takes prece­dence.

On the more optimistic side, Monday's win could be the start of a number of positive factors working in Notre Dame's favor. 
First, the Irish finally got their big win. Before 

to is a 16-14 and 9-7 in the SEC Georgia squad from the 2000-01 season. During that season, the Bulldogs didn't have an excep­tional record, but played an extremely tough schedule, which led to finishing the regular sea­son with a No. 19 RPI ranking.

around and get the team in the right direction," Notre Dame senior co-captain Torrian Jones said. 
Jones and a number of other Irish players feel this win will propel them to getting hot for the rest of the season. That's a testa­ment to the attitude in the locker room, as the Irish had lost six of eight going into Monday night and just had a tough loss against No. 4 Pittsburgh only 48 hours earlier. 
"After that loss Saturday against Pittsburgh, you could just feel it," Notre Dame forward Jordan Cornette said. "These guys were like, 'We're on the brink.' We knew we had to crack sometimes." 
Second, that momentum Jones and Cornette talk about could help them pick up enough "RPI wins" over the next two weeks to make the Irish a factor on Selection Sunday. 
One team the Irish can relate 

could finish hot in those always impor­tant last 10 games of the season. 
In Brey's other three seasons, the Irish have gone 6-4. 6-4 and 4-6 entering the NCAA Tournament. This season, those marks won't do. 
The Irish haven't been very high in the RPI all season and have that glaring Central Michigan loss on their resume. But they do have a chance over the last three weeks of the sea­son to make a late postseason push. 
Brey knows the only way that can happen is one game at a time. 
"We haven't talked big pic­ture," Brey said. "I don't think we can talk big picture with the schedule we have coming up. We have to try and get guys healthy for Saturday.''

24.2 minutes per game are second only to Emily Creachbaum who clocks in at 
25.5 minutes per game. Miller also has 39 assists on the sea­son. 
Despite the plethora of emo­tions that are running through Miller's head with another los­ing season coming to an end. she has remained positive about her experience as a Belle. 
"I think we've improved a lot over the past year." said Miller. 
While the Belles have · ' improved since last season, it is no secret that Saint Mary's has struggled this year despite their growth. They have faced tough competition and strug­gled to put together strong first halves against solid con­ference opponents. 
But for Miller. she sees a team growing with each other despite the losses piling up in bunches, and the wins few and far between. 
"We're building, we're still building. Hopefully with this experience next year they'll be a lot better, they'll do great things next year." Miller said. 
Saint Mary's could. in fact. improve on their 6-15 record. going into Wednesday's game with Adrian. With the develop­ment of freshmen Bridget Lipke and Jessica Binhack, among others. and the contin­ued growth of sophomores Anne Hogan and Bridget Boyce, and juniors Creachbaum. Emily Pernotto and Maureen Bush, Miller could in fact be leaving a solid nucleus of talent behind her that could make a solid run in the MIAA next year. 
While the Belles' future is undetermined, Miller's is not. It seems fitting that Miller. the ­sole senior who has been responsible for leading a younger team on and off the court. plans on going into edu­cation. 
"I plan on teaching. I'm an education major so I'm teach­ing next year ... kindergarten ­through second grade," said Miller.

"I never played football. but I tried everything else," Walsh said. "I was never really pres­

 sured much by my father to play football. and hockey was the sport I really felt good with early on. "I really picked between hockey and baseball, and in my sophomore year of high school I decided that I wanted to focus on hockey and pursu­ing that sport full-time." Walsh graduated from Detroit Catholic High School in Redford, Mich., while also playing minor league hockey for Compuware Ambassadors of the North American Hockey League. He helped lead Compuware to the United States Junior A Championship in 2001-02. Walsh's exploits impressed Notre Dame coach Dave Poulin, who has used the NAHL as a pipeline for Irish players over the years. Walsh is one of six current Notre Dame players who have played in the NAHL, along with Rob Globke. T.J. Mathieson, Derek Smith. Chris Trick and Jason Paige. There was never any ques­tion that Walsh would wear the Irish uniform. "Notre Dame was always an easy fit for me," Walsh said. "Growing up with my dad who had come here, he really pushed me towards the school. But it was never a hard sell, because I always wanted to come here." Walsh expressed that he was impressed upon meeting Poulin for the first time and that the coach was a major reason Walsh decided to become a member of the Irish. "How could you not help being impressed by Coach [Poulin]?" Walsh said. "Especially for a kid who's aspiring to play in the NHL, you'd want to come and play for a guy who spent several years in the NHL." A major step toward that dream for Walsh happened at the end of his freshman sea­son, when he was selected by the New York Rangers in the fifth round of the 2002 NHL Entry Draft.

off on a good note. Young. but talented, the team is hoping to win the Big East and fare well in the NCAA Tournament. With a difficult schedule ahead, this week's tournament gave them needed experience early in the season. "It was a pretty good team effort," Isban said of their sec­ond place finish, "but. obviously. we have a ways to go." Their next event. to be hosted by USC. is not until the begin­ning of March. ·

ents. so I was happy that they were able to share that with me," Walsh said. "Especially when you consider how much time they had spent driving me to practices and games and things like that." 
Certainly one of the most impressive aspects of Walsh's game is that he also leads the team in plus-minus with a plus-1 0. It is very unusual for a player other than a defense­man to lead a team in that sta­tistic. 
"I've always considered myself a two-way player," Walsh said. "The defensive part is really where it all starts. If you take care of your defensive zone it will translate into good offense. I've been fortunate to play with two other defensive-minded line­mates [Andy Gill and Cory McLean] who are just as responsible defensively as I am. 
"That's one reason we've been so successful this season as a line." 
It's certainly one reason the Irish have been a successful team this season, as well.

Two-way threat 
Strong defensively as well as offensively, sophomore Mike Walsh has already become a leader for the Irish 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
Finally able to play consis­tently, Mike Walsh has been able to show what he's capable of this season. 
Walsh, a sophomore forward who is currently third on the Irish with 10 goals, has returned from a difficult fresh­man year to play a big role on this year's team. Walsh missed a total of 17 games his rookie year with a broken jaw and mononucleosis and was never 


quite able to get any in kind of offensive rhythm. 
"Playing­wis.e, it defi­nitely affected my develop­ment in mak­ing the jump to college and all the speed and everything that changes at the next level," Walsh said. "And also, with missing 

"Growing up and playing big games, I've always thought of myself as the kind of person who can be in the right position to score a big goal. "

so many games early in my freshman year, it kind of iso­lated me from being with the team and getting to know everyone right away because I'd be spending weeks at a time away from the rink." 

His one goal that rookie year was a sign of things to come, however, as Walsh notched the game-winning tally in a 3-2 victory over Lake Superior State on Feb. 21, 2002. This season, Walsh has made a liv­ing of scoring big goals. 
In Notre Dame's earlier 1-0 victories this season against then-No. 1 Boston College and then-No. 3 Maine, Walsh scored the only goal in each contest. 
"Growing up and playing big games, I've always thought of myself as the kind of person 
who can be in the right posi­tion to score a big goal," Walsh said. "The people that I play with [on the Irish] really do a lot of work, and a lot of times I'm lucky and the puck just bounces the right way at the right time." 
Playing well in big games 

runs in Walsh's blood. His father, Max, was a member of the 1963 Irish national cham­pionship football team. Despite this gridiron pedigree, Walsh

MEN'S BASKETBALL 

Brey hesitant with optimism 
ByMATTLOZAR Associate Sporrs Editor 
For all the optimism stemming after Notre Dame's 80-74 upset of No. 5 Connecticut Monday night, Irish coach Mike Brey knows better. 
Brey knows his team is 11:9, 5-5 in the Big East, currently sits around No. 60 in the RPI and still has its next four games
 aga1nst teams in the top 35 of the RPI. That's why Brey, at least right now, is being realistic about Notre Dame's postseason chances. 
"We haven't even talked about the bubble or getting to the bub­ble," Brey said. "Where we've been is can we work on this in practice today and try and get another league win. When the

Men finish second despite slow start 
By ANNIE BRUSKY Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's golf team powered its way to a sec­ond place finish at the Rice Intercollegiate after compiling the lowest team scores in each of the final two rounds. 
Finding themselves in ninth place after the first round Monday, the Irish answered by shooting 289 and 303 in the fol­lowing two rounds to tie with Denver for second place at 36­over par 900, only five strokes behind the tournament champi­on, Texas-San Antonio. 
The team had hoped to win the tournament, but the lack of prac­tice time due to the winter weather made their goal difficult to achieve. 
"I think we did well for having stepped out and seen grass for the first time in three months," freshman Cole Isban said. 
Sophomore Tommy Balderston came through with a strong per­formance and earned his highest placement ever as he tied for fourth place at 2-over par 216 (78-68-72) . 
Isban, a freshman, finished in eighth place with 5-over 221, the second top-1 0 finish of his young career. 
Sophomores Mark Baldwin and Scott Gustafson finished 33rd and 42nd, respectively, while freshman Shane Sigsbee placed 63rd. 
Yesterday's final round was even more impressive in that the team was able to carry Monday's
