Housing shortage_ forces transfers 0-C 
by Rily McGrath Senior StaffReporter 
According to Edmund Price, director of University Housing, all transfer and readmitted students who were given rooms on camJ?US this semester have been required to sign a disclaimer to "any housmg on campus for the fall semester of 1979 or any other period." 
This procedure is in compliance with one of the Campus Life Council's proposals, submitted last October, designed to alleviate the need for an off-campus lottery. 
Price noted that the University ''would be glad to house everyone, had we the spaces." However, the tendency for more students to choose on-campus housing for all four years has recently led to housin~ shortages each fall. 
The Student Residences' section of the College Bulletin are generally required to live on campus, and sophomores are guaranteed on-campus housing if they desire it. Junior and senior students are able to remain on campus "if space ts available," according to the guidelines. 
"Transfer students don't have a commitment from the University to provide housing," Price commented. Therefore, since transfer students have the lowest housing priority, they will be the first students required to move off camr.us if necessary. This will occur if fewer rooms are vacated voluntartly than are needed to house next year's freshman class. 
"We hope no one will be affected adversely," Price said, referring to the transfer students and members of this year's junior class. The 35 transfer students who have been given on-campus space this semester, although they will not be eligible for upcoming room picks, will be the first in line to receive on-campus housing for the '79-'80 school year if it is available. 
Although some individuals may be disrupted by the situation, Price points out th~t the goal of the University Housing office is to ''provide the best situation for the most students.'' This means making the best of a difficult situation. 

More students apply for RA positions 
byJohn Ferroli 
A number of Notre Dame resi­
dence halls are confronted with a 
large number of applicants for 
the 1979-80 resident assistant 
(RA) positions. A large and 
enthusiastic Junior class ac­
counts for the increase in the 
number of applicants, according 
to various rectors, who feel that 
this may complicate the selection 
process. 
Fr. Conyers, rector of Keenan, has received 46 applications for six positions, and he believes that "all of the 46 would make good RAs. '' Last year, Conyers re­ceived only 28 applications for the six jobs. "This year's Junior class is the largest--they are very involved and enthusiastic,'' Con­yers commented. 
Morrissey Hall will face a similar l?roblem with 33 appli­cants vymg for eight openings, com~ared with only eighteen applicants in 1978. Bro. Ed Luther, rector of Morrissey, stated that all of the applicants are outstanding candidates and believes the increase in applica­tions is due to the quality of the Junior class. "It is not just a housing or lottery problem,'' he added. 
The increase in the applications 
Sr. Marietta Starrie, who must select five new resident assis­tants for Lyons Hall from 32 applicants, said, "We're going to have to modify our selection procedure--but I don't know how yet." Starrie, who attributes the doubling of applications in Lyons to a larger Junior class, stated that she and her RAs "may have to look more critically at the

19 78 prices rise nine percent despite Proposition 13 slowdown 
WASHINGTON (AP)--Califor­nia's tax-cutting Proposition 13 helped slow inflation in Decem­ber, but consumer prices still rose 9 percent durin~ 1978, the second biggest leap m 30 years, the government reported yester­day. 
The Labor Department also reported that a typical American wage-earner fell behind in the race to keep up with inflation in 1978, as workers' real buying power declined 3.4 per~ent on the avera~e during the year. 
The tnflation rate for the year, fueled by sharp increases for percent. The year's biggest bargain was clothing, which rose only 3 percerlt. 

Excluding 1974, the last time consumer prices rose as much as 9 percent in a year was 1947. Pnces rose 6.8 percent in 1977, but wage earners increased their buying power in that year. 
The year-end consumefj price reP.ort affects the pay ofup to 2.6 mtllion workers, whose labor contracts provide for cost-of­living wage increases based on the December or fourth-quarter figures. 
The Labor Department said prices in December would have gone up 0.8 percent, closer to the average iriflation rate for the full year. 
Voters in California, the most populous state, triggered a na­tionwide tax revolt last June when they approved a referen­dum to slash property taxes by more than 60 percent. 
William Cox, deputy chief eco­nomist for the Commerce Depart­ment said the December figures were substantially influenced by Proposition 13. But he sajd the impact of the tax-cut on consu­mer prices would be limited to 
Snow, wind 
paralyze 


Midwest again 
(AP)--Wind-swept snows dealt another severe blow to crippled Chicago and paralyzed much of the Midwest yesterday while gale-force winds and tornadoes wrecked dozens of homes on Florida's Gulf Coast. 
In Nebraska, where cattle are dying of starvation, Gov. Char­les Thone signed an emergency proclamation dispatching Na­tional Guard helicopters and trucks to evacuate stranded farmers and open roads to get food to the stricken herds. 
Paul Saftie-, the mayor of Kenosha, WI, summed up the feelings of millions of storm­weary Midwesterners who a­woke to find a heavy blanket of snow on top of that left by a fierce blizzard a week and a half ago. 
"We had it just on the brink of being cleaned up, and now we have to start over,'' he said. "The men are tired, the ma­chinery is tired and I'm tired. I keep praying to St. Jude, the patron of hopeless cases, but he hasn't helped." 
A cold front pushing toward the Great Lakes region dumped 7 inches of new snow on Chicago, where 20 inches fell 11 days ago. Drifts formed by winds gusting to 40 miles an hour blocked roads and crippled o.Perations at O'Hare Interna­tional Airport, the nation's busiest. 
Many highways in Wisconsin and Illinms were impassable and many schools and factories were closed. 
"It's bad news," said John Burke, a spokesman for the Illinois Department of Trans­portation. ''Travel in the northern half of the state, for all practical purposes, is impos­sible and nearly impossible in the northern two-thirds.'' 
President Carter had de­
clared much of Illinois and parts of Wisconsin disaster area~ following the Jan. 13 blizzard, which left snow waist-deep in cities such as Milwaukee. But the deadline for federal aid for removing snow expired at mid­night as the new snow was falling. 
Wisconsin Gov. Lee Dreyfus on Tuesday had withdrawn National Guard men and eguip­ment that had been sent m to help open the roadways and tow away abandoned cars blocking the paths of snow plows. 
An all-time record high of 32 inches of snow was on the ground in Milwaukee, and Richard Cajeski, a supervisor with the Milwaukee Bureau of Sanitation, said it was the worst he has seen in 32 years with the city. 
"We're on a full-scale plow­

Senate panel investigates foster children in Jonesto-wn 
WASHINGTON (AP)--A con­~ressional panel opening hear­mgs on child abuse announced yesterday it is investigating whether as many as 150 foster care children were placed in the Peoples Temple before the mass murder-suicide last No­vember in G1,1yana. 
Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said that at his request the General Accounting Office is examining county foster care records in California and the list of the dead from Jonestown, the jungle commune founded by temple leader Jim Jones. 

''If names turn up on both lists," Cranston said, "it means the Rev. Jim Jones may have received hundreds of thou­sands of dollars in government child support and that some of those children died in the Jonestown tra~edy." 
Cranston satd one such death already has been verified. He did not identify the victim.

Kenneth Wooden of Prince­ton, N.] . , an authority on juvenile delinquency, gave the subcommittee documents he said show that the Peoples Temple and some of its mem­bers operated foster care homes for chtldren in California. 
''The late Reverend Jones was receiving from the federal government and the state of California $13 7,000 annually for the operation of Happy Acres, an institution for 13 young retarded persons," Wooden said. 
Cranston said his subcommit­tee had found that the "appa­rent misuse'' of federal child support payments to the Peop­les Temple might obscure an even larger problem. 
''Some institutions for handi­capped, abandoned or delin­quent children are apparently providing abysmal living condi­tions for children in return for millions of dollars in federal support,'' he said. 
"We have heard reports ot children being strung up by the arms and legs in iron cages, held in solitary confinement in leg irons and handcuffs, tear­gassed and placed as punish­ment in dormitories with older inmates who sexually abuse them," Cranston said. 

Cranston and Sen. Birch Bayh, D-Ind., have introduced legislation that would authorize the attorney general to initiate or intervene in actions on behalf of certain institutionalized indi­viduals -including children ­whose constitutional rights may have been violated.

Security tightens car regulations 

by Tim Sweeney 

Students wishing to bring cars on campus th1s semester will find it more difficult be­cause of stricter regulations adopted rec~ntly by the Notre Dame secunty department. 
Joe Wall, director of Campus Security, said yesterday that the changes were initiated in order to preserve the pedestri­an atmosphere of the Notre Dame campus. Wall, a former chief of police in a Chicago suburb, admits that his biggest concern is to make it poss1ble for students and staff to walk safely on the campus both day and night. 
Wall insists that strict regula­tions are necessary in order to protect students and the staff from the higher probability of accidents caused by allowing cars on campus. Students will not be permitted to drive on campus to go to the Rock, swim at the lakes, cash checks at the administration building, work on a motor vehicle, or drop a date off at his/her dormit<?r>:. Students who request permis­sion from the guards to drive on campus for any one of these reasons will be asked to park in

to recetve fellowship 

Thomas L. Shaffer, professor 
and former dean of the Notre 
Dame Law School, has been 
selected to receive a Lilly 
Endowment Faculty Open Fel­
lowship for the 1979-80 aca­
demic year. He is the fifth 
Notre Dame teacher to receive 
the prestigious award since 
1975. 

Shaffer will spend his fellow­
ship year studying lawyers' 
morals and will try to identify 
the sources of codes of moral 
behavior among lawyers. The 
study is timely because former 
Attorney General Levi is work­
ing with a committee to review
the American Bar Association 
code while outside critics are 
suggesting J?Ublic regulation of 
the professiOn. Shaffer be-
Jieves his historical approach to 
theological and humanistic 
sources and antecedents may 
shed valuable light on these 
important issues. 

J
Shaffer, an authority on es­tate planning, has written sev­era! textbooks and articles on lawyer-client relationships. He received an undergraduate de­ree from the College of St. oseph, Albuquerque. He was raduated cum laude from the ~otre Dame Law School in 1961, and served as dean from 1971 to 1975. the students J.ot and walk. 
Students with acceptable rea­sons, as determined by the guard at the gate, must give their license to the guard and receive a fifteen minute pass to drive on campus. Students who do not return to the gate in fifteen minutes risk being fined. Several students who were issued passes to unload after Christmas break have yet to return to the gates to pick up their licenses. 
Wall has also taken steps to prevent vandalism in the park­mg lots. His department has hired twelve students to patrol in the lots. The students have been issued walkie talkies, and are expected to correspond with the guards and foot officers. This new program began Jan. 
15. 

On campus, a three-way stop sign wil be installed at the intersection of Lake and Saint Mary's roads. Wall hopes that this will make it safer for joggers and other pedestrians to cross the intersection, which is probably the busiest on campus. He expressed confi­dence that the students and staff who drive past the inter­section will heed the signs once they are put up. 
To go along with the traffic signs, Wall has increased the foot patrol on Saint Mary's Road. There will now be one or two more officers patrolling the 
road at night. This action came in light of the several incidents 
of assault which have occurred 
recently on the campus. Wall recommends that students, es­pecially females, not walk Saint Mary's Road alone during the late evenings and early mor­ning hours. For those students who must walk home alone at night, the security office pro­vides an escort service home. An escort can be obtained by calling ND security at 4444, or by asking the guards at the gates.

600 graduation tickets available ; lottery planned for distribution 
byJohn 0 'Donnell 

This year, graduating students have been issued a limited num­ber of tickets for the commence­ment ceremony to be held in May at the ACC. 
A lottery has been developed to 
allow for the distribution of any additional tickets. According to Richard Sullivan, Universiry reg­istrar there are presently 600 tickets to be distributed through the lottery. 
Each baccalaureate graduate has been issued five tickets while each post-graduate has been granted four tickets. Of the 2125 students who plan to graduate in May, over 1400 have entered the lottery. The winners of the lottery will be notified through the mail shortly since the draw­ing has already occurred. Each winner will receive one additional ticket. 
Sulll'van mentioned that the 
lottery consisted of a completelyrandom shuffling and selection process. Each student who expressed an interest was repre­sented by a numbered ticket. Sullivan pointed out that the lottery determined who will re­ceive an additional ticket; it does not indicate any specific seating location within the ACC. Seating arrangements will be determined at a later time. 
The figure of 600 additional 
tickets is likely to change. "As

Dean's office will certify the graduating list within a couple of weeks. 
' 'There are still many variables involved, one being that some students may fail to attain the minimum number of credit hours required. for graduation." Sulli­van explained, adding, "As addi­tional tickets become available, we will periodically notify addi­tional winners." 
Other items also complicate the issue. The registrar will not know who the guest speaker will be for the ceremony until mid­spring. This is important be­cause a national figure will require special accomodations. This was the case in 1977 when 
A funher complication is attri­buted to the seating of faculry members. There is currently a discussion about whether the faculry will sit on the main floor with the graduating students. The problem, according to Sulli­van, is that there is no way of knowing how manr. of the 700 faculry members will attend. 
Since graduatin~ ceremonies becan in the ACC m 1969, this is only the second year that atten­dance will require a ticket. Last year's ceremony, which packed m excess of 14,000 people into the 12,000 seat arena, helped to bring about this guest limitation. Sullivan feels that this year's system of reserved seating will

Monsanto to aid Engineering 
The College of Engineering received two grants recently from the Monsanto Company's Aid to Education program. 

The Department of Chemical Engineering, under the chair­manship of Dr. Julius T. Ban­chero, and the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical En­gineering, chaired by Dr. Albin 
A. Szewczyk, each received an unrestricted award of $2,000. 

The St. Louis coml?any each year awards aP.proxtmately a quarter of a mdlion dollars to about 100 different universities where it recruits graduatin~ students for professiOnal post­tions. Roughly 75 per cent of Monsanto's recruinng is for chemical and mechamcal engi­neers. 
Since 1967, Notre Dame also has received $100,000 from the Monsanto Fund, whose award recipients include private colle­ges and universities. 



Chilean, Argentine officials seek pope's aid 
VATICAN CI1Y (AP)-On the eve of a week-long papal trip to Latin America, the Vatican said yesterday Pope J. ohn Paul II will mediate a Chtlean-Argentine dispute that had raised fears of armed conflict. Vatican observ­ers agreed the role was a "gamble" for the new pope. 
The poE_e left today ai 8 a.m. (2 
a.m. ESI) for the Dominican Republic on his way to open the third Latin American Bishop's conference with a ceremony at the basilica of Our Lady of Guadelupe in Mexico City. It is his ftrst trip abroad as po£e. 
The 58-year-old pontiff will travel to Puebla de Los Angeles, 80 miles from Mexico City, on Sarurday for the conference. He will visit Oaxaca on Monday, Guadalajara on Tuesday and Wednesday and then will fly back to the Vancan Thursday after a brief stop in the Bahamas. 
The pope met Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko for the ftrst time yesterday for two hours--one of the longest encoun­ters between a pontiff and a statesman in many years. The Vatican declined to disclose details of the meeting, but Vatican sources said the pope and Gromyko reviewed issues concernins peace in the world and religiOus freedom in the Soviet Union. 
The Rev. Romeo Panciroli, chief Vatican spokesman, announced the pope accepted the two South American countries' request to help settle the dispute over territory at the southern tip of the continent. 
Panciroli did not say when the mediation effort would begin. Italian Cardinal Antonio Samore shuttled between Chile and Ar­gentina last month laying the groundwork for the effort. The 73-year-old cardinal has said representatives might come to Rome for furure talks. 
Samore has proposed a demili­tarized zone for the disputed area. Chile would keep three uninhabited islands granted by a British arbitration team in 1977 and Argentina would get en­claves on nearby islan<Is and Cape Horn.

The Grapes of Wrath: Chronicle of Despair 
·And the Angel thrust in his sharpe sickle on the eanh, & cutte down the wines ofthe wineyards ofthe 
earth, and cast them into the great wine presse ofthe wrath ofGOd.'' -Revelation XIV.10 
The title of John Steinbeck's The The Grapes ofWrath echoes the imagery of the Biblical aP<>Caiypse. Like the "Battle Hymn ot the Republic," in which the vision of God's justice is suffused by the "glory" of Christ's transfiguring love and power--"As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free" --Steinbeck's novel points to the final triumph of the forces of righteousness. 
The meaning of this  'triumph'' seems ambiguous. The waste and emptiness of the "Dust Bowl" give way to the rotting fruit and disillusionment of California. The exploiters--the growers, bankers, and other vast capitalistic forces--con­tinue to oppress the journeying "okies" in the illusionary "promised land." Rather than allowing fruit to be picked, the _growers let it rot as children die of pellagra--a tragedy so ~reat that "weep­m~ cannot symbolize" tt. The torrential rams at the novel's end bring death and silent waiting. 
Nonetheless, Steinbeck persistently locates in the midst of the Okies' despair and suffering a sense of hope and promise. The new dispossessed and uprooted in America's ongoing pilgri­mage, like the tunle which recurringly symbolizes their tenacity as he crawls on, dragging din over life-giving seeds, his ''old humorous eyes looking ahead,'' will find an ultimate justice. Privile~ed bankers are not more real than ' the people,'' Steinbeck insists, and capitalis­tic power, great as it is, cannot withstand forever the rightful claims of the poor and common laborers. 
If a major pan of Steinbeck's vision has its origins in Marxist economics, its deeper roots remain Biblical and reli­gious. Man is an economic creature, but man is also a spiritual being, a soul, rather than an ~egate of glands, or a machine, or a ' consumer'' whose only function is to "maximize profits" and serve as fodder for gargantuan and faceless corporate structures. 
] im Casy, a former preacher, denies that God and]esus are indisrnsable to his vision: " 'Maybe,' figgered, 'maybe it's all men an' all women we love; maybe that's the Holy Sperit--the human sperit--the whole shebang. Maybe all men got one big soul ever'body's a part of.' Now I sat there thinkin' it, an' all ofa suddent--l knew it. 
I knew it so deep down that it was true, and I still know it.' ' His sentiment represents a kind of idealism which borders on the pantheistic. As with Casy's view that "sin" and "virtue" may not fmally be real or useful distinctions, the systematic and logical aspects of Casy' s conviction may be somewhat elusive--the forms of capi­talism, after all, seem evil through the novel just as the Okies are persistently heroic. But as a powerful and evocative vision of human solitarity and purpose, his perception defmes Steinbeck's OWI_l· The Grapes of Wrath points not to the victory of a vague abstraction called the ''proletariat,'' but to the perennial vtctory of the spirit and of actual individuals as they emerge from death and suffering. 

At the novel's end, Rose of Sharon, whose name is Biblical and, according to traditional exegesis, Christ-associated, suckles at her breast a starving and dying old man. Their mystical union becomes the consummation of Steinbeck's vision of suffering humanifY., perpetually redeemed in time but still seeking a fmal justice. Our own age, which presupposes irony in all things, would fmd the ending sentimental; others, who call the book "life-giving," seem closer to the truth. 
For Steinbeck, the presence of com­munal and transcendent love, even--or especially--in the face of hatred, social disintegration, and economic terror and oppression, is the most central fact of exJ.stence. In some fmal way, he s~gests, the grape ofwrath will come to frwtion in justice and mercy, and evil will be subsumed in a larger redemption. 
The shape of the promise has less to do with John L. Lewis or F.D.R. than with the incessant facts and long~ of our moral experience and imagmation. America is a nation rooted, as it were in dislocation and in pil~rimage: the frontier, Manifest Desttny, the search for the Kingdom of God in time and space. Exacdy forty years after its publication, Steinbeck's novel still at­tests to the tragedies, ambiguities, and glory which attend man's struggle to approximate on earth the necessary conditions of some form of absolute justice, whether such justice is construed as divinely revealed or as the apotheosis of man's moral imagination and vision.

Cool Hand Luke 
Lucas ] ackson, played by Paul Newman in the 1967 movte Cool Hand Luke, is a laconic, soft-spoken, wryly­grinning young man who is sentenced to a Southern chain-gang for defacing municipal property [shearing off the tops of parking meters while drunk). He quickly makes a name for himself among the prisoners by his mad escapades, which include the attempt to eat ftfty eggs in one hour and effecting of some daiing escapes. 
Father Hank Mascotte, a priest ex­perienced in dealing with prisoners and their problems, sees activities like Luke's as the efforts of prisoners to break the terrible, unrelenting routine which is endemic to prison life. This routine is one ofthe major ways in which the prisoners are gradually dehu­manized. 
Mascotte, the pastor of Saint Augustine's Church in South Bend, belongs to an Ex-offender Task Force in conjunction with the United Religious Community, a national and interde­nominational group. The task force works with prisoners at the Indiana State Prison of Michigan City, and sponsors a job development program for ex-offen­ders in order to help them fmd employment. Thou~h he has had no direct experience wtth situations like that of Road Prison 36 in Cool Hand Luke, 'Mascotte acknowledges many serious abuses in the modem prison. 
"Right now, it's about where the mental health system was, thirty or forty years ago-people who didn't fit into soc~~ty were yanked out of it and locked up, he says. 
He deplores the many ways in which prisoners are exploited by the system, mcluding everything from physical and psychological abuse by prison officials to the use of prisoners for <iru£ testing by pharmaceutical companies, for which the mstitutions, rather than the prisoners, receive compensation. 
However, Mascotte sees the real enemy of the prisoner not in the prison system, but in the uncaring and hostile attitude of the outside society. "Films like Cool Hand Luke are a romantic approach to the daily situation of the pnsoners," he says. "They have heroes like Luke to a certain extent, but they realize that acts of defiance and rebellion like his don't help to solve their problems. There are good and bad guards, good and bad prison administra­tors, but ultimately the society is to blame. People must become aware of the prison situation and act to change'

Reflections:The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pitttnan 
The inclusion of The Autobiography of Miss jane Pittman in the Social Con­cerns Film Series is especially appro­priate because it attempts to project the black experience in other than superfi­cial terms. This demercates the ftlm from others which have largely served to reinforce stereotypes, as in the case of the Blaxploitation ftlms. [Superfly, etc ... ) 
It is particularly noteworthy that both 
The Autobiography of Miss jane Pittman and Roots have attracted large audiences. This enthusiastic response differentiates these two ftlms from other progressive films examining the black experience. It is difficult to account for this phenomenon but it appears to be associated with the success of the writers,' producers, and directors at creating aesthetic distance [the psy­chological differentiation of a work of art from reality). This aesthetic distance results m part from the existence of a strong central character portrayed by a gifted artist, with which the audience can easily identify. Miss]ane Pittman, as portrayed by CicelyTyson,disp!ays an 
inordinate~ set of admirable human qualities such that her racial identity becomes a secondary consideration. A similar case can be made for the character, Kuma Kinte, in Roots. Unfortunately, a strong character of this type leads to the inadequate appre­ciation of the collective soctal context in which the human qualities manifest themselves. 
The success in ·creating-aesthetic distance also results from the nature of systematic degradation of Blacks which is chronicled. In the case of Roots, the system of slavery and debt peonage is depicted, while The Autobiography of Miss jane Pittman explores the era in which the "Separate But Equal" doc­trine was the law of the land. This historical focus, coupled with a hapJ?y ending where good triumphs over evil, allows the viewer to appreciate the brutality of the historical treatment of Blacks while not being forced to contem­plate the vestiges of the historicaf systems. 
In contrast, it was not possible for the viewers to achieve a comparable detach-v­ment while viewing the ftlm King; it is 

still difficult for most of us to achieve psychological distance from the turbu­lent events of the 1960s. As a result, there is a growing tendency to discount the continued hardship experienced by a disproportionate number of Blacks, other racial-cultural minorities, and women. There seems to be an emerging 
societal consensus that too much has 
been done already to right historical wrongs. The Social Concerns Film Series will have made a major contribu­tion to operationalizing the stated com­mitment of the University only if it is successful in creating an environment in which a renewed commitment to Social ] ustice can be nurtured. 
There are many themes in The Autobiography of Miss jane Pittman 
that are of contemporary relevance. Unfortunately, space limitations only permit me to mention one -the plight of Black females as it relates to the problems faced by black families. While viewing The Autobiography ofMiss jane Pittman may serve as a valuable introduction to the discussion of the problems facing black females, it may well overemphasize the importance of the Black matriarch. Additional initiatives beyond moviegoing will be required for an enlightened appreciation of the Black experience to emerge. In this vein, -it is hoped that the enthusiasm 
· and social awareness which the Third World Film Festival and the Social Awareness Film Series have ~enerated will be translated into (aY mcreased enrollments in courses which critically examine the issues which have been highlighted by the ftlm series and (b) an increased participation in e~erential learning e~eriences. There ts, how­ever, a contmuing need for faculty and administrators to develop other means of institutionalizin~ the burgeoning in­terest in social JUStice issues. It is only through the institutionalization of a concern for socialJ"ustice that students will be prepare to assume their responsibilities as we approach the 21st century.

~...But Dad, S ,

Gratuitious Violence 386 Is a Great Course ... ! UJear 
... 
An ancient family tradition decrees that every year, when the Yuletide season has come and gone, and Christmas bills take the place of Christmas cards in the daily mail, the heads of said family shall call for a gathering of the clan. After the father of the house gives the annual ''State of the Home" address, the meeting moves on to the real business of the day --that of the family zero-base budgeting sr.mposium. 
Each famtly member is called upon to list and defend various personal exP.enditures of the family funds. The grtlling that follows an individual presentation is ruthless; sibling rivalry reaches its fiercest heights when there is a possibility that funds previously alloted to skateboard lessons for Jane may be redirected towards Dick's one-edition-only beer can collection. As I went before the Board, I could sense, all too clearly, that the distin­guished members Had It In For Me. Things went smoothly e9ough until the bill for second semester came up for evaluation. 
"McBrien!" barked my father. (He tends to get a little formal during these sessions) "I have here a bill, young lady, for the amount of (peering over the top of his glasses) two thousand, five hundred, ei~hty-two dollars and seventeen cents. ' He glared round that circle of already hostile faces. "May I call it to the Board's attention that U. of State, which is among the top twenty educational institutions in the country, only charges one thou­sand, five hundred for tuition and housing combined. Moreover, U. of State is known throughout the world for the advances in medical scientific research carried out in its graduate schools and medical schools, and for its fine athletic tradition. "Go Blue!" He readjusted his glasses. 
''On-Campus housing is available to all students, although many opt to live in off-campus suburban apartments.'' He was, I well knew, coming in for the kill. 
"By contrast, Notre Dame, which admittedly also boasts a fine academic and athletic tradition, has inadequate on-campus housing, unspeakable off­campus housing, and a campus light­ing system that is woefully lacking---in view of all this, how do you, McBrien, justify this expenditure?'' 
I was really in a tough/lace now. Once before, I had save myself by whipping out a kazoo and playing the ''Alma Mater'', then making good my escape when the room was foggy with tears and nostalgia. Another time I had evaded the issue totally by jumping up and down shouting, "Golden Dome! Catholic Harvard! Fighting Irish! God, Country, and Notre Dame, not necessarily m that order!" 
But emotional rhetoric alone would do me no good now. The ruthless gleam in my younger sisters' eyes reflected their knowledge that seats for the Shaun Cassidy concert at Pontiac were $12.50 apiece. My very marrow chilled as I realized what I was up against. 
"In the first place," I began, "since the chairman is currently grossing three hundred and seventy-five a month from renting out my half of my old room to a family of six, with dos, I don't see how he has the gall to bnng up anything about housing." 
I was gropins for my next words, when suddenly mspiration hit. 
''And moreover, the housing situa­tion like all facets of life at Notre Da~e, is directed towards Building Character.'' 
"How's that?" my father suspi­ciously queried. "Don't think that I don't know about these things. They've got you kids stuffed in th~se halls six ways to Sunday, what wtth doubles becomins triples, study loun­ges being turned mto dorm rooms, and then, to top it all o_ff, two hundred juniors ~ettmg lottened off campus. I'm paymg to keep you in a friendly, secure hall environment, for Gods­sake, not a Cass Corridor housing project.'' 
"That's just where you're wrong, 
Dad,'' I was quick to reply. ''All these 
years, parents had the tdea that the 
on-campus housing system _was th~re 
to give students a creative soctal 
atmosphere, or somethin~ like tha_t.

Senior Arts Festival 
(Participation in the Senior Arls Festival zs strictly limited to members of the senior class-Features Ed.] 
A series of fiction readings, art 
showings and events in music and dance 
have been schedules for the week of 
March 28 through April 4 to celebrate 
the Senior Arts Festival. Co-sponsored 
by the Cultural Arts Commission of the 
Student Union and the Senior Class, the 
week is envisioned as an opportunity for 
and a celebration of the artistic talent~ 
and efforts of the Senior Class. 
The events of the week were ori~inally and especially designed to provtde an audience for the non-professtonal artist, the senior who has, for four years, refined a talent without, perhaJ?S, pur­suing an art major. the commtttee is, therefore, extremely interested in con­tacting students who write, paint , take photographs, dance, write music, art or direct, in an effort to fully represent the artistic community within the Senior Class, 
The Senior Arts Festival Committee consists of just this kind of non-profes­sional. The drama committee hopes to give an opporturtity to seniors who ~ve never directed a play, or whose acttng has been confined to minor productions. The fiction and poetry committees hope to give an audience to writers of all sorts whose exposure in the uni-:e~ity student publications has been ltmlted. The opportunity for art shows among th(' "unseen" seniors is a further effort at the creation of an opportunity and an audience. 
Readings for the week have been scheduled for the Rare Book Room, the Library Lounge and the Art Gallery. 
Dramatic productions will take place in the Nazz and in Washington Hall. During the entire week, ISIS Gallery will house various art work by seniors, while the Nazz, in the everungs, will host musical performers. There are many opporturuties for further events, and for students and artists to take part in these scheduled events. 
The committees are interested 10 hearing from stud~nts with .an activi!)' which they would like to be 10cluded 10 the week's events. Seniors are asked to join the committees-the work shown during the week will be chosen from among submissions by the committees themselves-every member will have a voice in the schedule of readin~s and showings. Parts in the dramauc and musical productions will be open to all seniors: casting will take place in about a week. Interested writers, artists, and musicians are encouraged to contact Kathy Ryan, Festival Chairman or Jerry Perez, Cultural Arts Commissioner, at the Student Union, 6244.

assaulted!" (foo late, I remembered 
that Mom subscribes to the Observer.) 
"I don't want to have to worry about

from the library some dark night." 
''But Mom, that just ties in with what I said before. You don't want all those girls growing up not knowing that they're potential rape victims, do you? Of course not!

"That's another thing---I don't like their attitude towards women," said my Dad. "An administration that goes around making sweeping generaliza­tions about women alumni being less generous than men, especially when those women haven't been out of school long enough to start ~arning any real money, doesn't have a very positive'" attitude towards its female students. I don't care how male its tradition is, either. Harvard had a male tradition, Yale had a male tradition, every blasted school in . the country used to have a male tradition. That's no excuse." 
"Well gee, Dad, the administration doesn't really mean all that. They know that there's still a lot of people out there with negative attitudes towards women. As a matter of fact, a lot of them seem to be Notre Dame alums. But they figure that, if they pretend they're running a sexist 
Marcia McBrien 

institution, then all their female grad­
uates will be prepared to deal with 
sexist attitudes in the outside world." 
''But what about the off-campus lottery?'' interjected my mother. "I've seen that neighborhood, and I certainly don't want my daughter living in an area like that." 
''But Mom, people get evicted from their homes every day. It's a fact of life. I mean, suppose someday I'm living in the middle of where they're going to put a freeway, and they tell me that I ve got to move. Would you want me to go to pieces over some­thing like that, simply because I've never had the expenence before? Besides, everybody ought to experi­ence slum life sometime.'' 
"Now wait just a minute," my dad interrupted. "All of what you've been saying sounds very plausible, Mc­Brien, but what about the young man living off-cam~us \\-ho was shot just before exams? ' (My father, unfortun­ately, had also been reading the Observer.) "I suppose that's part of this master plan? How can the University, in conscience, place off­campus students in a situaucn where something like that is likely to hap­pen?" 
"Dad, things are rough all over. Remember all those terrorist incidents in Europe, when they bombed the Louvre and stuff like that? Lots of people have their own guns now just to break even, statistically speaking. The University knows what's waiting for us out there. In the world that's coming, we'll probably all of us catch our share of bullets. We have to learn how to survive, for crying out loud. If you don't believe me, just look at my schedule for next semester." 
"lntro to Hand Grenades" my mother read incredulously. "Garage Can Raiding 202. Gratuitous Violence 
386. That's what you're taking?" 
"It's just like I said, Mom. They've started to incorporate some of the class offerings into the CCWP. Did you see my Homemade Explosives lab? That's sur.posed to be a really fun course.'' 
'I don't know about all this" she said doubtfully. "Is that--everything you've been telling us--what we're really paying for?" 
I don't know, Mom. I sure hope not. 
Trevor Rabin, Baby's 



Album Review 
Steve Navarre , 

With Head First, The Babys make the most of what they have to offer. There is nothing new or imaginative in this album. The songs themselves echo hundreds of rock tunes written in the past five years. There are imitations of almost every rock group imaginable, including such notables as Led Zeppelin, Bad Company, the Eagles, Styx, Deep Purple. Indeed, the list goes on forever. . The_Ba~ys are not, bY, any stretc~ _of the tmag10auon, extraordinary mustctans. The rhythm team of Tony Brock on percussion and John Waite on bass lay down a steady and sturdy beat. Wally Stocker's guitar riffs are solid but basic. John Waite also handles the vocals and does an adequate job. 
The real artistry is performed by "the man behind the dials.'' Ron Nevison, the producer, does a very slick perfor­mance on this album and one cannot help but tap his foot to the quite ordinary music presented on this disc. The songs never drag or veer off course. The various musical components are pack­aged to present a clear, crisp sound that never wavers throughout the entire work. 
The Babys don't try to prove their musical prowess and deserve credit for their good judgment. Instead they present an lP of solid rock and rol!. Uninspired, maybe, but soli-:! rock , nonetheless. Besides, who satd rcod: 
bands had to be visionaries?

The sad thing about Trevor Rabin's debut solo album is that it could have been a ~reat one. This is not to say that this isn t a ~ood album. Fans of such guitar-wielding rock and rollers as Jeff Beck, Robin Trower, and Ted Nugent will thoroughly enjoy this album. Nonetheless, it does have its downfalls. Many sonss contain slow-tempoed inter­ludes reminiscent of the Who but urtike the latter they don't work well here. Instead of providing a counterpoint to the thundering rhythm and screaming lead riffs, they merely tend to confuse the entire development of the son~. 
In "All I Want Is Your Love, ' for example, the tempo and energy of the song builds throughout the verses. Instead of exploding in a climax of shreaking Fenders, the song suddenly drops off to a chorus · of overdubbed voices meekly singing a repetitious and somewhat mundane refrain leaving the listener wondering what hapJ?Cned. 
Rabin ·handles all the mustcal chores excluding percussion, and he shows himself to be an extremely talented musician. His crisp guitar playing is quite similar to that of)eff Beck. Unlike Beck, however, Rabin s Telecaster does not dominate this album. Many other musical influences weave their way into this work producing a highly energetic if somewhat confusing IP. 
Trevor Rabin wrote and produced the entire album and a stronger effort on both ends to tighten up his music would have resulted in a better product. Nevertheless, this album is packed with good, hard, rock-and-roll.

BOISE (AP)--Lynnae Move says the courts are unfair in ruling she cannot raise her two young children because she is an epilep­tic. 
"My type of epilepsy is not violent, it would never cause harm to my children,'' the 24-year-old mother of 2-year-old Tanya and 4-month-old Bret said yesterday. "I don't thrash about. 
There 1s nothing really wrong with me." 
Mrs. Move's seizures of petit­mal epilepsy occur only at night, and only after emotional distress, says Dr. Michael O'Briend, a Boise neurologist. He testified that Mrs. Move's epilepsy would

not prevent her from taking care of her chldren. 
But District Judge Gilbert Norris granted custody of Tanya and Bret to Terry Move, 37, whose job as a mapmaker with the U.S. Geologic Survy forces him to travel in seven Western states. 
Norris, in his decision, said Mrs. Move could not act decisive­ly for at least 10 minutes after seizure. He said she also apparently lacked energy "to properly look after said children'' 
SMC sentor placement meeting set 
by PJ/en Buddy Saint Mary's Editor 
The Counseling and Career Development Center of Saint Mary's is sponsoring a Senior Placement Meeting today, 4 p.m. in Carroll auditonum in Made­leva Hall. The purpose of the meeting is to acquaint seniors with the process of formulating and maintaining a credentials file to be kept in the CDC office, according to Betsy Twitchell, CDC Director. 
Once the flle is established, it is a permanent ftle of the student's life experience and can be con­veniently forwarded to employers and schools upon request. The ftle contains a resume, recom­mendations and possibly a per­sonal statement. 
Twitchell said other aids of the CDC would also be discussed at the meeting. They include career counseling, notification of job vacancies and on-campus inter­views. Registration packets and Career Manuals will be available at the meeting. 
Students who are unable to attend are encouraged to call or stop by the CDC office in LeMans Hall. 

for a day after a seizure. 
Mrs. Move said the seizures, which last from 30 to 60 seconds, prevented her from being able to 
talk for  a  half hour afterwards  
and  gave  her  migraine  head­ 
aches.  

Mrs. ' Move's mother, Dee Cady, said the seizures began when Mrs. Move was 15. From that time until she was married at 20, Mrs. Move had experienced only two or three seizures, her mother said. 
The Idaho Supreme Court has suspended Noms' ruling while it reviews the case. Mrs. Move said the high court likely will take 10 months or more to decide. She has custody of the children while the case isjending. 
She file last October for a divorce from Move, who, she contended, used to grab her by the neck and throw her down on

their bed as she rose from a seizure, contrary to O'Brien's orders not to touch her. 
"It seems our marriage was setting them (the seizures) off," she said. "I was very emotional and couldn't do anything about what was happening. With Terry holding me down they were getting worse. ' ' 
O'Brien testified that since leaving her husband last October Mrs. Move had not had a seizure. 
The divorce is not final pending a property settlement. Meanwhile, she receives welfare assistance amountihg to $323 a month.
