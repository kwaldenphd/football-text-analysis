Rego stays ho01e after arrest threat 
By MYRA McGRIFF Saint Mary's Editor 
Cooper Rego will not travel to Notre Dame with the West Virginia football team Saturday, the former Irish running back confirmed in a statement Thursday. 
Rego said Notre Dame threat­ened to arrest him if he arrived on campus. 
"I received notification today from the University of Notre Dame that the institution will 
FAA head 
of security 
quits job 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
The head of security for the Federal Aviation Administration decided to quit after he was told to reassign air marshals to com­mercial flights carrying mem­bers of President Bush's Cabinet, a source with knowl­edge of the resignation said Thursday. 
Michael A. Canavan, named associate administrator for FAA's office of civil aviation security in December, said the marshals had been assigned to other flights that he felt could be more at risk of a hijacking, according to the source, speak­ing on condition of anonymity. 
Bush administration officials had wanted marshals on the planes carrying Cabinet mem­bers, who took commercial flights to demonstrate that air travel was safe and thereby encourage Americans to return to flying. 
It could not be learned whether marshals were trans­ferred to the planes carrying the Cabinet secretaries, or why Canavan felt other flights were more vulnerable. 
Canavan did not immediately return a message Thursday. Cabinet officers usually travel with their security aides. 
At the time, the FAA was rushing to hire and train air marshals, while temporarily using armed law enforcement officials from other federal agencies. A small number of air marshals had flown for years on 
U.S. airliners, but the program was sharply increased following the terrorist attacks. 
arrest me if I join my West Virginia University teammates at South Bend," Rego said. "This threat con­
tradicts the basic tenets of fairness as well as the under"­standing that I had with Notre Dame con­

s i s t e n t I y Rego f r o m January 1998 until [Wednesday] morning." 
According to Notre Dame alumna Kori Pienovi. Rego allegedly raped her and was banned from campus after an internal disciplinary hearing in 1998. No criminal charges were ever filed against Rego, and he transferred to West Virginia in 1998. 
Notre Dame did not make a public statement until Thursday if the University would uphold the alleged ban. While University officials declined to specifically discuss Rego's case, University President Father Edward Malloy issued a statement Thursday stating that when a student is permanently dismissed from campus for disciplinary reasons, the student is prohibited from returning to campus. 
"Should the individual come on campus -and campus adminis­trators learn of it -the person is required to leave immediately or face a charge of trespass," Malloy said. "There are no exceptions to this ban." 
Rego's coach also confirmed in a statement that Rego would not be traveling to Notre Dame Saturday, stating Rego requested permission not to travel with the team. 
"Cooper has made an extreme­ly mature and difficult choice based upon the best interests of his team," said head football coach Rich Rodriguez. "Until today, we have had every inten­tion of playing this game with Cooper on our team. Based upon his decision, that will not happen now."

Dreaming in dollar signs 

. College waits on $31.5 million for next steps in major building plan 

By NOREEN GILLESPIE 
News Writer 
Inside the Blue Mantle year­book office at Haggar College Center, editor Courtney Boyle affectionately refers to her clos­et-sized workspace as "our lit­tle hole in the wall." 
Smaller than most freshman dorm rooms, the Blue Mantle office has to squish close to 15 editors in an office space barely large enough to fit two desks. 
And there's one more prob­lem, too. It only seats six. 
"It's very frustrating trying to coordinate when people can work here," Boyle said. "Basically, only one section can work at a time." 
Boyle's made do for the past two years by scheduling staff meetings after-hours at Haggar when the staff can use the hall­way outside of the office to spread out page layouts and pictures. She and other editors frequently design pages on their personal computers in their dorm rooms, where they don't have to worry about space. 
But last year, Boyle became a little bit hopeful when she heard that the College's Master Plan, a multi-year construction project, included a plan to build her a new office in the newly­proposed student activity cen­ter. 
The Master Plan, first announced by the College in the fall of 1999, includes plans for a new student dining hall, new student activity center, new classroom building, new athlet­ic field, new parking lots and eventually, apartment-style res­idence halls. But even though the highly-touted plan has been talked about for more than two years, Boyle has little fa i t h she'll ever see t h e results. 
" I t won't be anytime soon," she said, looking around the office. "A lot of it is just talk. It's a great plan, but only if we're ever able to see what all the talk is about." 
The Board of Trustees will try and take the next step in the plan today when they convene to discuss the progress of the Master Plan. According to Keith Dennis, vice president of Finance and Administration, board members were sched­uled to draft financial require­
. ments for moving forward with the next phases of the plan in a finance committee meeting Friday afternoon. 

Step by-Step 
The next step in the plan wo·uld be the largest and most expensive construction since the construction project was proposed in 1999. The pro­posed $18.5 million dollar stu­dent center and dining hall is scheduled to be completed in two construction phases. Phase one would include construction

The CCC -what? 
So how many students do you think are in clubs? I'd bet at least half of the students at Notre Dame ar<' in at least one club. That's at least 
6.000 student.., participating in extracurrir:ular activities through clubs on both campuses. 
On Activities Night thousands of students stream through the JACC picking and choosing their plate of activities for the coming school year. The clubs, having prepared the previous spring for Activities Night, show their best and finest to get more students interested. 
Now, the clubs have offi­cers and members. They can plan activities and put up posters around campus (as long as they have been approved by Student Activities). 
So that's it. right? That's all ther~ is to being a club? 
Not exactly. 
What happens if your dub runs into prob­lems? \Vho do the officers go to with questions? The answer to that question is that they should go to the CCC. 
The CCC what. ..? 
The CCC, ofliciallv the Club Coordination Council. is an aid and advocacy for student clubs on campus. It has an office·in 314 LaFortune. right past all the dubs' mailboxes. 
To better help the clubs. it is split into live divisions: i\rademic, Athletic, Ethnir, Service/Sodal Action and Sp<~cial Interest. Each division has three representatives that are them to help clubs with planning and by answering questions specific to the ne<'ds of their division. HepresPntativcs have office hours Monday through Friday. 
So. that's what thev do? 
Tlw CCC has W('ekiy mPPtings on Monday nights in which are disC'ussed issues of conces­sion stands. upcoming.club activities. policies and budgeting. 
Conc('ssion stands? Budgeting? What does the CCC have to do with those things'? 
Thi~ CCC allocates money and concession stands to clubs each year. They do a spending review after fall break to see how the clubs are spending their money and to make sure they are sticking to their proposed budget from the year before. They also hear emergency appeals for unexpected expenses (each club can appeal once per semester). Then, during the spring semester is when things get busy for the CCC. During spring semester is wlum club registra­tion occurs. Clubs that want to remain in ac:tive status need to register and apply for funds Of they ne<'d the money). What the CCC has to do is go through each budget with the of1icers and determine funds for the next year's program­ming. The representativi~s take notes on organi­zation of the club, amount of programming, number of active members, and how specific the budget is. There are some clubs that come in with impressive plans for the next year and their budget comes within pennies of zero, but when the numbers in the budget are checked, they're off by almost $100. The dec:isions that the CCC makes based on the registration form and budget determine how clubs will have to structure their next year. It can't give everyone everything that they want. but it tries to be fair and rational in its decisions. 
The CCC is there for clubs, to support and help them.

Grade inflation dispute goes public 
CAMBHIDGE, Mass. 
The long-running disagreement between Harvard University's Kenan professor of government llarvey Mansfield Jr. and Dean of the College Harry Lewis regarding grade inflation took a very public turn this weekend, as the Boston Globe published private e­mails Lewis wrote to Mansfield. Lewis has publicly contested Mansfield's claims about grade inflation, particularly his assertion that it was caused in part by an influx of black students to the College in the 1960s. Lewis sent an e-mail to Mansfield on Feb. 12 claiming that his hands are tied in dealing with the problem. "As you know, I have nothing to do with faculty policy; [Dean of the Faculty) Jeremy [Knowles) has made sure of' that." Lewis wrote. Lewis' e-mail also blamed grade inflation in part on "a collapse of critical judgment in the humanities and some of the social sciences." Lewis said his Feb. 12 e-mail to Mansfield was explicitly pri­vate and "off the record." Lewis told the Globe he con­siders Mansfield a friend and was "disappointed" to find Mansfield had shared his e-mail with the press.

Documentary raises c~wareness of Taliban 
By SARAH NESTOR News Writer 
Students and faculty gathered at Saint Mary's last night to view the documentary film "Beneath the Veil." The documentary was filmed earlier this year and focuses on women living under the Taliban regime. 
Saira Shah, a freelance jour­nalist born in Britain of an Afghan family. produced the film. Shah brought two crew members, but she also went undercover by herself to truly understand how the Afghan peo­ple live. 
Shah's journey began in Pakistan and delved into the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan. RAWA is self-described as "an organiza­tion of Afghan women struggling for peace, freedom, democracy and women's rights in Afghanistan." 
The film showed the women of RA\VA risking death by defying the Taliban, educating women, going to beauty salons, and try­ing to awaken the outside world to the inhumanity of the treat­ment of women in Afghanistan. 
Shah said the film depicted "women trying to keep things normal. in a world gone com­pletely mad." 
The law of the Taliban system is there to protect the women, according to the Taliban, but it has actually driven the women into the streets to beg. The women are not allowed to work, so there are over 40,000 widows who have no means to make an income. Women are not allowed to go to male doctors, but women can't work as doctors. which perpetuates the problem­atic cycle. Afghanistan also has one of the highest rates of death at birth, and one in every four children dies. 
"There most be some future for women in Afghanistan. If that's a happy one, that's a dif­ferent question," Shah told CNN. 
The documentary also showed the life of tribal Afghans of the north and their resistance against the Taliban regime. The people spoke of the many civil­ians that have died because of the resistance and the Taliban's violence. The images included scenes of dead corpses, blood­stains and crying relatives. 
Following the documentary. philosophy professor Ann Clark gave a brief history about Afghanistan and its people. 
"There is a long history of competition for the rule of Afghanistan. It is a country with a mosaic of different ethnic groups and a tradition of civil war," Clark said. 
However, comments in the dis­cussion revolved primarily around the current events about Afghanistan and Sept. 11.

Bush leads Pentagon memorial 
Associated Press 
WAS! IINC~TON 
The nrnn who struck America one 
month ago "died in vain," President 
Bush said Thursday, plt~dging the mil­
itary will have "evPry resource, every 
weapon, every means" necessary to 
triumph in a worldwide war on ter­
rorism. 
"They will be isolated, surrounded, 
cornered until there is no place to run 
or hide or rest," he said of the al­
Qaida network and terrorists around 
the globe. 
The commander in chief spoke at a sombr.r ceremony at the Pentagon on a day of sunshine as bright as Sept. 11, the date of the deadliest terrorist attacks ever on American soil. The ceremony took place on the opposite side of the Pentagon from where ter­rorists struck one month ago, doom­ing 189 to their deaths. A separate observance was held in New York, where more than 5,000 perished in attacks on the \Vorld Trade Center. 
Bush also reCfiived an update from his Cabind on a broad range of gov­ern men l anti-terrorism activities. including the freezing of $24 million in assets of Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida network. "I want the terror­ists to know we're after them in all kinds of ways." he said. 
lie urged the Senate to pass his energy plan to make the nation less reliant on foreign oil. The Ilouse passed his package. but thP legislation has stalled sine(~ the Sept. 1 1 strikes. 
VicP Presidr.nt Dick Cheney did not attend the Cabinet meeting. In a sign of continuf'd concern over fresh ter-. rorist attacks. he has been staying at a spcur<' location outside the \VhiW IlousP. 
Hlsewhere, there were signs of recovery. After a swift drop in the days following the attacks. the stock markets stood near or marginally above their pre-attack levels. 
The Dow Jones industrial average was about 200 points below its close on Sept. 1O. having fallen 1.369 points after the attacks. The Nasdaq com­posite and Standard & Poor's 500 indexes traded within points of' their rinses of' a month ago. 
Inside the Pentagon, vvar planners ovf~rsaw the liv(i-day-old aerial attack on terrorist targets in Afghanistan. The skies deemed safe for round-the­dock bombing runs, ofticials said mil­itary targets were being chosen in part on the basis of information pro­vided by the northern alliance forces battling to overthrow the ruling Taliban militia. linked to bin Laden. 
But Gen. Henry Osman, briefing reporters at the Pentagon, said, "Coordination is probably too strong a word." Asked why, he said, "It's in the political side," a reference to the administration's reluctance to become too dose to any of the rival factions inside Afghanistan. 
Outside the Pentagon. machine gun­toting troops stood guard in camou­flage, providing security for a service that drew not only the president and first lady, Laura Bush. but also former President Bill Clinton. dozens of mem­bers of Congress, relatives of the attacks victims and a throng of thou­sands of guests. 
Similar ceremonies were held in New York, where the mighty twin towers of the World Trade Center crumpled after being hit by a pair of hijacked jetliners. There were more deaths that day when a fourth hijacked plane crashed in the Pennsylvania countryside following an on-board struggle between passen­gers and the terrorists. 

The hijackers ··were instruments or evil who died in vain," said the presi­dent. "The terrorists have no true home in any country or culture or faith. They dwell in dark corners of earth and there we will find them," he promised. 
· The Pentagon ceremony \vas a blend of prayer, hymn-singing and speech-making, and included a mournful honor roll of the dead. with names scrolled on video screens for the crowd to see. 
"We remember them as heroes," said Defense Secretary Donald H. Humsfeld. "And we are right to do so." 
Bush's own remarks blended words of praise for the dead, comfort for their survivors, and resolve for the fight ahead. 

Official: Airlines fail inspection 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON 
Inspections in the past week at seven of the nation's 20 highest-risk airports found most airlines are not complying with new federal orders to scan all checked baggage for explo­sives, the Transportation Department's inspector general said Thursday. 
The Federal Aviation Administration directed the airlines in a previously undisclosed order after the Sept. 11 airliner hijackings to make continuous rather than part-time use of their high-tech bomb-detection machines. 
"Despite a recognized need for heightened security. air carriers still are not fully utilizing these machines to the maximum extent possible." Transportation Inspector General Kenneth M. Mead told a Ilouse avia­tion subcommittee hearing. 
At the FAA's request. Mead would not disclose which airports or airlines were inspected. But last week, acting Massachusetts Gov. Jane Swift reas­signed the head of security at Boston's Logan Airport. where two of the hijacked airliners departed. 
FAA Administrator Jane Garvey said Thursday she had just learned of the inspector general's findings and need­ed to examine them further. 
"We need to know more about it," she said. "There's also a question ... if the term· 'continuous' is too ambigu­ous. We have required that it be con­tinuous and we are enforcing it." 
Officials told the subcommittee that before last month's FAA order. the million-dollar-plus bomb detection machines were used only selectively -largely based on responses to a computerassisted passenger profiling system and for passengers lacking proper IDs or failing a security quiz.

military experts said. 
The Americans face possible 
attack from Pakistanis opposed 
to the U.S.-led campaign 
against Osama bin Laden, the 
chief suspect in the Sept. 11 
attacks and believed to be still 
hiding in Afghanistan. 
Pakistan risks political back­
lash from Muslim militants at 
home and from Afghanistan's 
ruling Taliban, who harbor bin 
Laden. 
"The diplomatic aspects are 
much thornier than the mili­
tary," said retired Green Beret 
and CIA officer Michael 
Vickers. 
Getting troops and support as close as possible to Afghanistan is the Pentagon's goal. 
The closer the better, said retired Army Gen. Fred Woerner, former head of the 
U.S. Southern Command. 
But in using Pakistan for raids: "You'd be trading off the danger of political [threat] to the Pakistani leadership in order to achieve improved reaction time," for troops, he said. 
A month after the terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Pakistan acknowl­edged for the first time Thursday that American mili­tary aircraft had landed inside its borders and were using at least two air bases. 
But the issue is so sensitive in the Muslim country of 145 mil­lion people that the government issued a formal denial troops were there, while privately con­firming that they were. 
Islamic religious leaders sym­
pathetic to Afghanistan's 
Taliban rulers have denounced 
both the air attacks and 
Pakistan's support for the anti­
terrorism campaign and plan 
nationwide protests Friday, the 
Muslim day of prayer. 
"It's generally wise to limit the footprint in Pakistan," said Vickers. the former Green Beret now at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. "The areas that are the most useful militarily are the most volatile political­ly." 
Stationed at a distance is the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk. It's in the Indian Ocean and could provide a base for raids by small teams of special forces, although U.S. officials said they would also set up a forward base closer to Afghanistan. 
They would not say where. but U.S. forces have arrived in Uzbekistan as part of this month's deployments as well. 
One of the known Pakistani bases where U.S. forces are setting up operations was Pasni, 180 miles west of Karachi in the far south of Pakistan. 
The other was closer to its border with northern neighbor Afghanistan. It was Jacobabad air base, 300 miles northeast of Karachi. 
At least 15 U.S. military air­craft, including C-130 transport planes, have landed at Jacobabad in the past two days, Pakistani officials and witness­es said.

She also urged the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's com­munity to wear white shirts in solidarity at Saturday's foot­ball game. 
"I want to express my deep~ est thanks to the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's communities for supporting me," Pienovi said. "And when they win one for Kori let that mean they win one for all victims of assault."

New Plan 
continued from page I 
of the dining hall and some 24­hour space, and phase two would include construction of the activity center, which will include the travel agency, year­book and newspaper offices, bookstore, student government offices, coffee shop and post office. 
The construction of a $13 mil­lion dollar classroom building to replace Madeleva is also being proposed. While the original Master Plan aimed to renovate the current building, administra­tors decided last year renova­tions would be too costly, and decided on constructing a new building entirely. 
All together, the two projects have a projected cost of $31.5 million. As of Thursday, the College had collected $13 million in pledges for the student center and dining hall and $5 million for the academic building. 
'The fundraising track is mov­ing along fairly nicely, but we're not quite home yet," Dennis said. 
This weekend's board meeting will be critical to scheduling con­struction dates for the projects. The board will be asked to vote on both financial considerations, approve the schematic design for the classroom building and decide if the dining hall project can be bid to a contractor, Dennis said. 
"We have not established the minimum amount of pledges required before the project goes," said Dennis. "One of the things we are going to ask this week is if $13. million is enough to proceed." 
One consideration on the table would be to issue bonds midway through the project to finance construction, Dennis said. But no final decisions on financing will be voted on until the board's February meeting. 
The first phase construction of the dining hall portion of the stu­dent center and dining hall building will take 14 months, and Dennis hopes to have a groundbreaking date set in April. 
"Architecturally, we'll be ready by April," Dennis said. "We may not be ready financially." 

Waiting for bulldozers 
But while the proposed pro­jects face an uncertain ground­breaking date, the College has completed several steps in the plan. Last fall. the $750,000 Welcome Center was opened alongside the new Clubhouse near the campus' entrance. Regina Hall completed renova­tions to transform the cubicle­sized single rooms to doubles and quads. The College also put an addition on the facilities building and built an additional parking lot alongside Regina Hall. 
Still, dreams of the new class­room building and student cen­ter don't seem yet ready to be realized. In the basement of Madeleva Hall, where a signifi­cant amount of faculty offices 
are housed, some professors are frustrated with the cur­rent office configuration. 
Some departments have offices scattered about the basement and clumped close­ly together, and many offices experience frequent tempera­ture fluctuations. 
Jeff Breese, coordinator for the sociology department, has had three different offices in the basement. In one, the ceil­ing caved in. In another, the temperature was never con­sistent. 
"I had to have my space heater on all summer because it was so cold," Breese said. 
Mark Luttio, a professor in the religious studies depart­ment, shares his tiny office space with another professor. The situation is so bad. he tries to stay out of it, he said. 
"My office is incredibly small, so I don't spend much time down here," he said. 
In the new classroom build­ing, department faculty offices will be located closer together and classrooms will be bigger. But no date is set for the project yet because fundraising has lagged. 
"That fundraising is not as far along because the emphasis has been on the student center," Dennis said. 
To professors like Breese, that makes the new building little more than a dream. 
"It will happen ... but I'll know it when I see bulldozers," he said. 
Laying the first brick 
Even though the bond market is "the best it's been in 30 years," according to Dennis, the College is thinking carefully about using any investments on the project. And after Sept. 11, the economic downturn has raised some concern about fundraising potential. 
"It may have some impact on our ability to get more gifts ... it's a concern of ours," Dennis said. 
Still though, he remains opti­mistic that the project will move forward as planned, and the Board of Trustees will give the go-ahead to move forward today. 
"[These projects] are absolute necessities," he said. "Without them, we're at a competitive dis­advantage." 
But laying the first brick for the project still might be further away than planned. 
"We hope we can break ground on the activity center this spring, but a lot of dominoes need to fall into place,'' he said.

to uphold its rulings,
The University knew Hego could return to campus this Saturday. Notre Dame administrators should have contacted West Virginia officials immediately and told them that Rego could not return to campus for the game in 2001. 
But instead they waited. And while they waited, they put Kori Peinovi through even more pain. Peinovi is an alumna and no longer lives in South Bend. Hego's possible 
future victims will be more hesitant to come forward. 
Peinovi, like -anyone else who turns toNotre Dame for justice, should have confidence in the administration to uphold its promises. If the administra­tion tells a victim that it \viii punish an offender, that victim should not have to worry if the administration will go back on its vvord. 
In 1998, Notre Dame expelled and 
banned Hego from campus. Monday, when Denny Moore, Univfffsity director of public relations, spoke on Notre Dame's policy on banned students, he waffled on whether or not banned stu­dents who traveled to campus with a group were still banned. It shouldn't have taken three and a half years for Notre Dame to mako a definitive public statement on the general policy for all banned students , regardless of group affiliation. It is ridiculous that Notre Dame would even consider a different policy for banrn~d students based on their individual or group affiliation. 
If Notre Dame makes a promise, it should stick to its promises. Them shouldn't be months of' debate, specu­lation and stress for the victim. 
It's not just for the victim. It's nol just for Notre Dame. It's not just. 
Questioning America's unity 
Ilow united are we? Americans boast 
that they arc united against our nation's 
aggressors, but many of their actions 
have thus far been less than inspira­
tional. Each of us sees the same tlag with 
its stars and 
stripes. yet our def­
initions of patrio­
tism and freedom 
selfishly omit oth­
ers. 
Unfortunately 
nothing was more 
evident and disap­
pointing than last . Saturday's Notre 
Dame football pre­
game ceremony as 
well as as a 
Catholic mass last 
Sunday in subur­
ban Indianapolis. 
While sitting in 
Notre Dame Stadium last weekend, I was 
moved by the wondPrful tribute the 
University orchestrated for the young 
alumnae who lost her lifo in the World 
Trade Center. Permitting her parents and 
siblings to present the American flag for 
its lift above the stadium brought tears to 
my-eyes. While the announcer listPCI 
other Notre Dame alumni who foll victim 
a month ago, nobody thought to include 
more Americans who were Pittsburgh 
alumni and lost their lives on that fateful 
day. 
What does it mean to be united'? It 
requirns that each of us embrace the rest 
of' us. If we are truly living in a new era 
then we should change our thought 
process to be more inclusive. Had Notre 
Dame included its fellow Big East 
Conference school in the pre-game cere­
mony by merely mentioning the lost Pitt 
alumni, they would have powerfully 
made the statement that everyone at the 
stadium was an equal partner in our 
American family. 
A month ago in New York City emer­
gency response personnel -policemen, 
firemen, medical technicians and other 
good Samaritans -without hesitation 

sacrificed their lives to assist strangPrs. Thos(~ who assisted saw no African­American, Asian-American or llispanic. They saw no Jew or Christian or Muslim. They certainly did not see Pittsburgh or Notre Dame graduates. Hather they extended their hands to all in need in a city that represents just how much of a nation of nations our country has 
become. 
Service to others and freedom to live and worship as we please reminds us that ours is a unique and unparalleled society. It saddens me that I attended a suburban Indianapolis Catholic mass last week that included a General Intercession to pray f<>r our Christian politicians that they may have the \Vis­dom to lead our country. 
Dons that dioct~sn infor that Senator Joseph Lieberman, fornwr Vice Presidential candidatP and an Orthodox Jmv, is excluded from Catholic prayers or is unworthy of public service? Docs it mean that Catholics and self-proclaimed, self-righteous born-again Christians likP Jerry Falwell arc morn worthy to interact with each otlwr'? After all, this is the sanrn Jerry Falw·cll who blamed certain groups, including libPrals, gays, llollywood, womon's rights and abortion supporters for the attacks on our nation. 
Why is my patriotism and tolerance of nvlwything Falwell opposes any less American'! In his syndicated column. "My Answer," Reverend Billy Graham pub­lished a letter in which the writer, an immigrant, said that he had been in the United States for 10 years. He said that people in his school won't make friends and call him names. He concludes with, "I had heard this was a Christian nation and Christians were nice people, but it isn't true in my experience." 
Graham responded by saying that he was saddened by the letter but wantl~d to print it to remind all of us to bc kinder to people from different backgrounds. While being influenced by the Judeo-Christian tradition, Graham contends that we are not a truly "Christian" nation. He says not to judge Christ by a majority of people who may not foll()\,\' him nor think about him and what he should mean in their dailv lives. 
Gi·aham's logic could b< extendfid to our nation's current surge orstar-struck patriotism. Some blindly follow tlw presi­dent and somc blindly question every presidential decision. Both vimvs are equally American. I am embarrassed to mad this newspaper's lettors to the editor which include alumni p<~rsonally attack­ing students and vice versa over the questioning of government authority. It is reminiscent of my colleg,~ days during the Vif~tnam War when follow stud1mts died in Vietnam. Today's so-callPCI war on tnr­rorists is no diffonmt. 
Bill Maher, host of ABC's "Politically lncmTPct," said that. tlw Unih1d StatPs has bP(m covvards by lobbing cruise missiles. Maher and Falw,~11 am both oqually Anrnrican. What dilforentiatns them is that Malrnr advocatps a "livP and IPt livp'' philosophy while Falwell pwaches tlw "livP likP I tPII you b<~causP that is tlw cor­rect way to live" dogma. 
\,\'110 is more Christian? Probably tlw atlwist l\·1aher. \Vim is financially bmwlit­ing during this timP or u1H:<~rtainty and anxiPty'! Delinitdy Fal\wll. \Vim is morP American? Neither of' the two men. 
Until wn stop thinking of' our diffor­1~ncns and prnforencns. Wl1 \Viii continue to omit our football oppotwnts at prl'­game ceremonies and Pxclude non­Christians in our prayers. Being unit.Pd as a nation is a blessing we share and a bur­den <·mch of us must preserve and prott1ct in the freedom of our hearts. To do less would be to forsake last month's fallen brothers and sisters as well as to aban­don the principles we sePk to enshrine.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Two decisioµs, one administration, and a lot of questions 

Constantlv students and alumni usn this forum to co;nplain about many things that, whi!P they won't affoct world peace. consolP victims of oppression or feed the hungry, am the issues that face the Notre Dame communi­ty -on campus and beyond.

Yet I've somehow manag1)d to deal with these awful tribulations. However, two recent developments in the decisions of our morally conscious administration do cause me great d1s. trcss. 
First, witness tlw administra­tion's punishment of the ROTC al Notre Damn. Since when was it un-hip to be patriotic, espt>­ciallv at a tinw when America despPrately nrnids to show its tnw colors'!

which has been used since Ranger Challenge was created in 1987.) Sadly though, the

Army cadeL-; must train for the National Leadership Advanced Camp where they are evaluated and graded on their military devcl­opment. As well. they train for their collegiate competition Hanger Challenge, in which they participate against Hanger Chalh~nge teams from other universities. 
In this competition cadets in 9 and 5 person teams must perform land navigation, rifle marksmanship and 10-K runs with full j b equipment and rope bridging. It is 
each semester since HOTC was ~~'-iMl.llW.tl ments or that our student actors 
founded. Them was nothing out 
of the ordinary or different about 
that weekend's Pvcnts from pre­
vious ynars -battle drills in the 
woods, some land navigation, 
t1~arn building exercises and leader­
ship development. 
This year tlw HOTC f'aculty, S(~eking 
to give their cadets an (\XCeP,tional 
training opportunity, decided to liven-up 
tlw wet)kend by coordinating for our cadets 
to ride in Blackhawk Helicopters back to Notre 
DamP from their training site. These choppers 
were generously furnished by the Illinois 
National Guard. The cad<~ts relished the 
opportunity to 11y from LeMans Military 
Academy back to the field in front of Holy 
Cross College. At that point the cadets dis­
ntounted th,1ir choppers and formed up for a 
foot march back to Pasqucrilla Center, the 
home of Notre Dame's ROTC programs. 
Th11 American flag and Battalion colors were 
uncasnd as the cadet battalion proudly 
marched across U.S. 31, down Dorr Road, 
around I Ioly Cross Drive and down Juniper 
Hoad, finally arriving at Pasquerilla Center. 
NotrP Dame Security Police provided traflic 
control. which was greatly appreciated. As 
they crossed U.S. :~ I doz(ms of motorists 
bnepod their horns, waved to the cadets, 
shouted supportive words and shm.\1ed their 
patriotism. Furthermore, during their march 
across campus, several people cheered, waved 
and took pictures of the marching Notre Dame ·students. Morale amongst the cadets was 
extremely high; truly those students cxempli­
lied "(iod. Country. Notre Dame." 
Tlw high morale hit rock bottom when the 
battalion arrived back at its home. Notre 
Dame administrators had already called for a 
rrn~eting with the ROTC commanders to dis­
cuss the offonsive and unacceptable behavior 
displayed by the army cadets, specifically: 
marching, singing cadences and wearing cam­
ouflage -how atrocious! 
As a result of that meeting ROTC cadets are 
no longer allowed to sing cadences during 
runs around the lakes. They are no longer 
allowed to wear camouflage at their training 
periods on the campus proper. Also, the 
cadets are forbidden to utilize training aids 
like rubber weapons as they offend and scare 
too many students and administrators. 
and actresses not be given a the­
atcr to perform? Of course not. 
So why punish these Notre Dame 
student-athlete-leaders? 
At this point I wish to take issue 
with the moral majority that is our 
dear administration. In the Oct. 8 
Observer there is the article concern­
ing Cooper Hego and the alleged rape 
that transpired in 1998. 
Here is a person, maybe not formally prosecuted for rape, (as Notre Dame wouldn't dare allow such a spectacle to go outside the Dome) but who was punished as a result of some type of conclusive evidence to support the claim of Miss Picnovi. Yet this morally upstanding, patriotically-condemning adminis­tration of ours is seriously considering his return to campus, despite the ban against him. 
"As an individual, security would ask him to leave, as a group that is something different." This said by the director of Public Relations Denny Moore, the only Notre Dame oflicial who would comment on the impending episode. Yeah. good response -strength in numbers. I guess the HOTC programs just nned more cadets to join. 
I do not use this example to exploit the plight of Miss Pienovi. However. it does serve to showcase the often-contradictory policies of our administration in both instances. Especially because ROTC bailed out Notre Dame during the great wars and Miss Pienovi graciously gave of herself to increase sexual assault awareness at Notre Dame. 
The fact is this administration does an excel­lent job of living in its glass house while cast­ing stones at others. This university has a host of issues to contend with, however, no one of any real substantial importance is in tune with any of them. Perhaps if Mr. Kirk weren't spending all his time in the Green Field on Saturday mornings ticketing tailgating stu­dents who aren't affecting anyone but them­selves then maybe he'd have a better idea. The words "God, Country, Notre Dame" are engraved over a doorway at the Basilica. I now realize why those words do not hang over any door into the Golden Dome.

Sometimes doctors get very frus­trated when patients don't seem to get it. Take the overweight man with heart problems who will con­tinue to decline in health until he loses weight and lowers his 
cholesterol Stephen Carroll 
but he never 
listens. Take 
·the drug A Medical 
addict who Perspective 
shows up in 
the 
Emergency Hoom at least twice a 
week who will not kick the habit 
unless he gets put away and into a 
treatment program. And the list 
goes on... 
In each case the doctor provides compassionate medical care, often without passing judgment on tht~ patient. Do you know how hard that is sometimes? Sometimes I've come very close to shaking my patients and saying "What the heck were you thinking for ___ (fill in the blank), but I don't. It's not the doctor's place to do things like that, even if he wants to do so. 
I was working in the Emergency Room one day and a nurse asked me to do a 12 lead EKG, a job which I perform about a dozen times during a typical eight hour shift. As I wheeled the machine into the room, I see a man in his early 30's talking to his young daughter. "It'll be OK sweetie. Go outside with my friend while daddy gets checked out." The daughter hugs her dad and then leaves. 
The man is visibly anxious but otherwise looks line. I usually get to talking to the patient while I'm attaching the electrodes to their chest to put them at ease but I don't have to for this one. Before I can say anything he starts talking. 
"Man, I really messed up. I smoked a whole bowl of coke yes­terday and now my heart is rac­ing. I can't let my ex-wife find out or else she'll take away my daugh­ter. What will happen?" he asks. 
"Uh .. .l don't know. I'm sure you'II figure something out." ] said, stumbling over my words. I continue setting up the machine and I run the EKG in silence. 
In my mind I'm thinking, "What the heck are you thinking, doing 
drugs with a child in your house! 
Of course they should take your 
daughter away from you! Are you 
stupid or something? What if she 
finds daddy's cocaine stash and 
has some! Ever thought of that?! 
What if you shoot up one day and 
daddy ends up dead of a drug 
overdose, what will your daughter 
think then?" I envision myself 
shaking him up and down to drive 
home my point. 
When you choose to mess up 
your own life then what you do is 
your own business. When you 
endanger the life or future well­
being of a child it really gets to 
me. Of course I did not carry out 
what I was thinking but some­
times I think I should have. Yet I 
did my job-providing quality med­
ical care without passing judg­
ment or telling him what I really 
thought. 
What doctors often find is that you don't get to pick and choose the patients and problems you deal with. You learn that you will have to keep yourself from passing judgment on your patients or try­ing to unfairly coerce them into doing what you think is the right thing, even if it is in the patient's best interest. 
As far as the case I mentioned I never did find out what happened to the man or his daughter since my shift ended soon after that. That's the way it is in the Emergency Boom; you often can't follow your patient's care all the way to discharge. Standard proce­dure would have involved notify­ing social services but anything can happen from there. I can only hope that the daughter ended up okay and is not living with her father. Sometimes that is all you can do: hope.

going to be a challenge for her but it's one I think she's really looking forward to." 
Haney, who learned to lead watching Ivey the 'past two seasons, appeared confident as she described her role on the team. 
"One of the most important things for me is to be a leader on this team and to show the younger people what it takes to get to \Vhere we were last year,"llaney said. "I think that'll be my biggest role on the court, to show more than tell people what to do." 
Haney's leadership should prove cru­cial as the Irish adapt to a new, faster­moving offense. Tlw slow, half-court game in which the Irish exploited Riley's ability to score around the bas­ket and create shots for others is now history. This year's team will run and shoot, taking advantage of the ski1ls of junior Alicia Ratay, the team's new go­to player. 
"She is the person that we want to go to in situations where we really need to score,"McGraw said of the 6-1 Ratay, who set the NCAA record for 3-point percentage last season. "She's willing to accept that role and because of that she has the respect of the whole team." 
The defensive pressure on Ratay will be greater than ever before, as teams no longer have to put to defenders on the nation's best center. 
"I don't expect to get as many open shots as I did last year,"Ratay said. "Ruth got triple-teamed, she was a great passer." 
McGraw noted that Ratay spent the summer working out in the weight room and playing pickup games against male players to prepare for the season. 
One of the unanswered questions for the Irish is how the team will sort out its point guard position. Ivey played nearly 40 minutes at the point every game last year, not leaving until the game was well in hand. 
Sophomore Le'Tania Severe is expect­ed to eventually take over the position, but classmate Jeneka Joyce exhibited strong ball-handling skills. turning the ball over only 14 times in 403 niin utes. 
"[Joyce isl just so smart with the ball and has such a good head for the game,"McGraw said. "Le'Tania is not quite as poised right now but certainly has improved tremendously. I think both or them will see some time at the point. It will eventually be Le'Tania's job but I think Jeneka will kind of help her get started." 
Joyce was even more confident in Severe's abilities. 
"I think Le'Tania is going to be very good at the point,"Joyce said. "Nobody's seen her play because she's been hurt. She's in very good shape now. She had the whole~ off-season working on her game." 
In the front-court. junior Amanda Barksdale is expected to take Riley's starting spot at center. Barksdale was the team's Most Improved Player last season, ranking third in the Big East with l.7 blocked shots per game despite averaging only 8.2 minutes on the court per contest. 
Freshmen Flecky and Batteast com­pete for the power forward spot vacated bv Siemon. Batteast, a South Bend native, adds shooting skills and eventu­ally could replace Haney at the No. 3 spot. But right now, she will contribute on the boards. 
"I think the thing we're looking from her the most probably is rebounding,"McGraw said. "That's her greatest strength; it's our biggest weak­ness. That's going to be her role initially is to really help us out on the boards." 
Flecky, from Colorado, adds a shoot­ing touch to a fast game that has been compared to Siemon's. 
"She can step outside and play in the post," McGraw said. "She's somebody that's very aggressive going to the bas­ket. She's a good rebounder." 
The Irish open with a preseason game 
on Nov. 6 against the Ohio Girl's 
Basketball Magazine team at the Joyce 
Center.

very clear," said Brey. "To talk about that long haul of being consistent, we didn't understand it until it was in the bank last year." 
In Big East play last year, the Irish won 11 of 15 games, including an eight-game winning streak in January and February. 
This year's Irish are a different team, with different players and different expectations. But this y1:1ar's Irish are more experienced and they have the same goals. How that experience helps them will remain to be seen. 
"We've never been in this situation before," Graves said. "We've never won a championship, so we'll see how we rnact to it. I think we'll react very well."

Sporrs Wrirer 
With four total games and four playoff spots, wins during the regular season games in interhall football are crucial. 
In order to make the playoffs, a team needs at least two wins. Both Sorin 0·1) and O'Neill O· 
2) are shy of this mark. While Sorin has two games remaining during this final week, and thus the luxury of being able to lose one, O'Neill is facing a must win situation. 
"We have been focusing on offense." said O'Neill team member John Enterline. "That has been slow for us over the last few games." 
O'Neill plans to vary their plays. involving both passing and running plays. This means that tight end Kyle Johnson and backs Nate Schomas and Phil Irvine will all see a lot of action. 
"We have to mix stuff up a lit· tie," said Enterline, "and keep from running the same play over and over." 
As important as it is to focus on offense, O'Neill is also work· ing on defense. Sorin has scored 40 points in two games this season. "They have a good passing offense," said Enterline. "We know they can score points." 
These preparations are a key aspect of O'Neill's attack. But, an even larger part is their knowledge that this is a must win game. "Obviously, we need to win to get into the playoffs," said Enterline. "So we are going to play all out." 
The Otters don't need to worry about the playoffs as much. With only two season games thus far, Sorin's situation is not quite as immediate. The Otters cannot be eliminated from the playoffsin tomorrow's game, although a win could make a spot in the playoffs virtually secure. 
"This is going to be a tough game," said Enterline. "We arc just going to have to work our butts off."

Around this time last year. Keenan's in terhall footbal I team was hitting its stride on their way to the championship. 
This year the Knights hope to do the same. 
"Last year we were in the same boat," said co-captain and lineman Brian Morlok. "We lost to Dillon pretty good in the second week of the year, but we came back and got better each game and carried that into the playoffs then made it to the finals and won it all." 
For that to happen again this year. Keenan must first beat 2­1 Alumni. 
"We both try to play a power game," said Morlok. "Ir they run up the middle on us then they're going to be able to do whatever they want. \Ve have to establish our running game as well. We need our offensive line to step up this week." 
Alumni co-captain and line­man Nick Linstroth agrees that the team whose offensive line plays better should win the game. 
"This week W(~ just have to dominate the line of scrim­mage," said Linstroth.

Dutch ice Irish in season opener 
By MATT ORENCHUK 
Spom '~v'rircr 
Thursday night it was tlw Dutch vs. tlrn Irish in the north donrn of' the Joycf~ Center. But this wasn't Western Europ(~an socc1\r. lt was the home opener for the Notre~ Dame hockey team. The Union College Dutchman defeated the Irish 2­1 in the non-conforence opener for both teams. 
The Irish looked for a fresh start after last year's cam­paign. Notre Dame went 10­22-7 on their way to an 11th place finish in the CCIJA. Tht~ Irish missed the CCHA playofls last year for the lirst tinw since the 1995-9(> campaign. 
NotrP Dame head coach Dave Poulin pulled a bit of a surprise at the beginning of the game. Starting in net for tlw Irish was frf)shman Morgan Cey. Cey beat out Senior 
.Jernmiah Kimento and Junior 
Tony Zasowski in thP prnsea­
son to lw the Irish goaltend1~r. 
Thi~ first period was quiet for both l<'atns. Them were three penalties, one by Union Col legii, and two by Notre Dame. Neither team was able to score though. with Union holding a 13-6 shot advantage over the Irish. Penalties were a concern for Notre Dame all night. 
"\Ve addressed a lot of our concerns in the off-season," Poulin said. "Discipline was one of those areas. The people taking penalties on our team are the lcadnrs, and thev need to work on that." · 
The second started much like the first period. The teams traded penalties during the first five minutes of the period. It was a mistake by Ccy that lead to the first scoring oppor­tunity of the game for Union. 
\,Yith the teams playing four on four hockey, Cey came out of' the goal to try and pole the puck out of the Notre Danrn 
zone. 
Instead he poked it right to Union College defrrnsemen Dagenais. Cey was out of posi­tion, and Dagenais put the puck in the open net to give Union a 1-0 lead. 
Union struck again with 2:45 left in the second. A defensive breakdown gave the Dutchmen a thre1>. on two rush into the Notre Dame zone. Junior left winger Jeff' lluchins got the puck and was able to beat Cey to give Union a 2-0 lead. 
The third period saw Notre Dame increase the offensive pressure. The Irish took a lot of shots on the goal in an effort to get a score, out shooting the Dutchmen 7-2 in the first 10 minutes of the period. 
With 10 minutes left in the 
third, Notre Dame had a gold­
en opportunity to score when 
Irish defenseman Tom Galvin 
had a point blank shot right in 
front of Union goalie Brandon 
Snee. Snm~ canrn up with the 
glove save that not only kept 
the Irish scoreless, it also took 
away any momentum Notre 
Damp had built up in the third. 
The Irish finally broke through with just 51 seconds left in the game. David Inman was able to deflect a pass from Hob Globke past Snee tu cut the Union lead to 2-1. It was too little too late, and Union was able to kill off the rest of the time for the victory. 
"We had our chances offon­sively," said Poulin. "\,Ve tried to make the game too complex. We played our best when we made simple plays."

NOTRE DAME 
. Expectations remain high in 2001-02 
By MATT ORENCHUK 
Sports Writer 
Every team has f~xpectations. _ 
After fivn years of steady 
improvement with head coach 
Dave Poulin, the Irish were eyeing 
their first invitation to the NCAA 
tournament. 
Unfortunately, things didn't 
work out. 
A young defense coupled with 
an anemic offense doomed Notre 
Dame from the start. The Irish 
stumbled out of the gates, and 
quickly fell to the bottom of the 
CCHA standings. 
Despite last year's setbacks, 
Notre Dame's goal of reaching the 
NCAA tournament remains the 
same. 
Defensively the Irish have only 
one upperclassman, junior team 
captain Evan Nielsen. Notre Dame 
also returns four sophomores who 
all saw playing time last season. 
Leading that group is Brett Lebda. 
No only is Lebda a force in the 
defensive zone, he also had seven 
goals and 19 assists for the Irish 
last season, tying him for third on 
the team. Lebda did lead Notre 
Dame in penalties, and this is an 
area of concern for Poulin. 
"We have addressed a lot of our concerns in the off season," said Poulin. "One of those concerns is penalties. We cannot be a good hockey team if we take penalties." 
Offensively, the Irish lost their two leading scorers in departed seniors Dan Carlson and Ryan Dolder. Stepping into their shoes will be a talented group of wingers in ConnorDunlop, David Inman and Hob Globke. Globke and Dunlop missed time last sea­son while playing for the United States in the World Junior 
Championships. Inman is one of . . the assistant captains for the Irish. The· team selected juniors Dunlop and Nielsen as team rep­resentatives. But the coaching staff decided to name Inman as another assistant captain. 
"Inman definitely earned being 
a captain," said Poulin. 
In goal, the Irish have senior Jeremiah Kimento, junior Tony Zasowski, and incoming fresh­man Morgan Cey. Last year Kimento and Zasowski split play­ing time, with neither goalie stepping up to claim the starting spot. This season Ccy has looked impressive in preseason work­outs and earned the starting nod against Union College. 
Notre Dame missed the CCHA playoffs last year for the first time since the 1995-96 season. In order to return to the CCHA play­offs, and have a shot at making it to the NCAAs, thf~ Irish have to win some conference games ­early. 
"This season is going to go with how we handle adversity," said Poulin. "! am confident that we 
will be a good hockey team."

With just 5:29 remaining, Braun netted his seventh goal of the year off of an assist from Prescod. Braun, Notre Dame's leading scorer, has contributed a goal in every game the Irish have scored in. The solid Notre Dame defense recorded its sec­ond shutout of the year. The team got a strong performance from freshman goalkeeper Chris Sawyer, who earned his first col­legiate shutout. 
The victory starts the Irish off on the right foot on their push to make the Big East tournament. They improve to 3-2 in confer­ence play with the victory and travel Sunday to play first-year Big East member Virginia Tech. 
A win against the llokies would put Notre Dame into a much safer position heading into the home stretch of its schedule. The Irish have seven games remaining, five of which are against Big East opponents, including defending national champion Connecticut.

Katie McFarland, the Babes'

Cavanaugh vs. Farley 
Since the schedule came out, this game has been circled on the calendar for Cavanaugh's Katie Burdick and Farley's coach Irish .Thompson. They both work at Rolfs Aquatic Center and have been remind­ing each other of the impending match-up. 
"We've been talking some since the beginning of the semester," said Burdick, a senior wide receiver for the Chaos. "I've seem him scouting us so I know he is concerned." 
For Farley, the coaching staff has stressed that this game has intra-quad bragging rights on the line.

In their 13-12 win over

Chaos extended their unbeaten 
streak to four games. Since an

Chaos have used their defense 
to clinch a playoff berth. 
"The defense, except for the 
game against Howard, has held 
the other team to one touch­
down or less," Burdick said. 
"That helps the offense because 
it doesn'.t have to score on every 
possession." 
Senior safety Allison Dennhardt and linebackers senior Sara Elberts and junior Sarah Dreznes have led the Cavanaugh defense. 
Tuesday night, Farley picked up their first victory of the year with a 6-0 win against Off Campus. Farley looks to keep this momentum going in their final game. 
"We scored early in the first half and that gave us confidence for the rest of the game," said Cordes. "The offense had a lot more fun and started taking over the play calling." 
With the playoffs already clinched, the Chaos do not plan on just going through the motions in this game. They have some incentive to defeat the Finest.

ND CROSS COUNTRY 
Irish harriers travel to Pre-Nationals 
 No. 5 men face top competition in Greenville 
By KATIE HUGHES Sports Writer 
The front of the pack will be a little more crowded this Saturday for the men's cross country team. 
The No. 5 Irish head to the P r e ­National meet at t h e Furman C r o s s Country Course in Green­ville, S.C., and will face their toughest competition thus far. 
No. 1 Colorado and No. 2 Stanford are tentatively scheduled to be at the meet, as well as No. 9 Villanova, Duke, Wake Forest, Northern Arizona and Michigan State. At least half of the teams ranked in the t'op 25 will at the meet. 
"We're hoping as a team to come out with a win," said senior Ryan Shay. 
Seniors Shay, Luke Watson, Marc Striowski, Pat Conway and Sean Zanderson, as well as sophomores Todd Mobley and Mario Bird will run for the Irish. 

"Conway was sick last week, and Mario ran very well in his race," said head coach Joe Piane. 
The participating teams at Pre-Nationals will be divided National meet. 
Shay was battling a cold in last week's meet and was still trying to beat it as Pre­Nationals drew closer. 
'Tm hoping by Saturday to get better," said Shay. " I'm trying to get as much rest as possible, doing everything your mom tells you to do." 
Bird finished second over-
evenly into two heats based on the current 
 rankings. "Stanford a n d Colorado will not be in same heats, but that will be excellent competi­tion," said head coach 
Joe Piane. "Colorado 
"I'm hoping by Saturday to get better. I'm trying to get as much rest as possible. doing everything your mom tells you to do."

State has been running awfully well." 
In last week's Notre Dame Invitational, Watson finished first for the Irish, followed by Shay and Mobley. Striowski took fifth overall, and Zanderson finished 17th. Saturday, the Irish pack will have more to push them than each other. Watson and Striowski both finished in the top 10 in last year's Pre­on whether they will be able to get an at large bid to go to Nationals. The top two teams at regionals qualify automati­cally. 
"This meet has a lot to do with who gets at-large bids," said Piane, " But I'd like to think we won't need one."

. No. 24 women face first test as ranked team 
By KATIE HUGHES 
Sports Writer 

For the women's cross country team, early season mission No. 1 is accomplished. 
The Irish earned a No. 24 rank­ing after last week's victory at the Notre Dame Invitational and will send the same solid team to the NCAA Pre-National meet this Saturday at the Furman Cross Country Course in Greenville, S.C. 
Pre-Nationals will be the biggest challenge for the Irish thus far, and only the second meet in which the full team will run. 
Juniors Jen Handley, Muffy Schmidt and Jen Fibuch, freshmen Christi Arnerich and Lauren King, who won last week's meet, and sophomores Megan Johnson and Julie Schmidt, will run in Greenville. 
Last week the Irish crushed the 18 other teams in the field, led by a first place finish by King in her first collegiate cross-country race. 
King pulled away in the last part of the race to win by six seconds. A third place by teammate Handley and another top 10 finish by Johnson showed the team's speed up front. Arnerich finished 20th and Fibuch finished 24th. 
"Last week gave them a lot of 
confidence," said Johnson. "We were excited to be ranked, but we want to keep building on that." 
This meet will help the Irish reach their goal qualifying as one of only 30 teams to get a bid to nationals. 
When they run at regionals, the top two teams automatically go to nationals, but who Notre Dame beats at a meet like Pre-Nationals will determine where they will stand when it comes time to get an at large bid. 
"Our goal is to go there and beat people who are going to be auto­matic qualifiers [for the NCAA meet], or who will be among the top non-automatic qualifiers," said Irish head coach Tim Connelly. "We want to put ourselves in a position to get an at large bid." 
The Irish did not know specifical­ly who would be in their race, but the meet will include teams from No. 2 Stanford, No. 3 North Carolina State, No. 4 BYU and No. 6 Boston College. Two races will be run Saturday, in an effort to bal­ance the competition. 
"We don't know who's going to be in our race," said Connelly. "But we just wan.t to go down there and worry about being as good as we can. It's a really critical meet. Out of the top 25 ranked teams, 21 will be there."

MEN'S AND WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
Irish ballers tip off at midnight 
Men hope for life after Murphy 
. 
By ANDREW SOUKUP 
Associate Sports Editor 

arely two sentences into his first press conference of 
the 2001-02 basketball season, Notre Dame men's 
basketball coach Mike Brey answered the question 
everyone else was dying to ask. 
"I think the theme since last spring has been 'Is there life 
' after Troy [Murphy]?"' Brey said. "We really feel there is." 

. Defending champs start new season with three new starters 
By NOAH AMSTADTER 
Sports Editor 
When the 2001-02 installment of the Notre Dame women's basketball program put on their uniforms for media day and took the Joyce Center floor together for the first time last Thursday, they hardly resembled the squad that brought home 
Nobody denies that Murphy was the focal point of Notre Dame's success last season. Before he was drafted by the Golden State Warriors in the first round of the NBA draft, Murphy led the Irish to the Big East West Division champi­onship and a berth in the NCAA tournament -the first for the Irish in 11 years. 
But with Murphy gone, Brey feels that Notre Dame's three senior captains, David Graves, Ryan Humphrey and Harold Swanagan, as well as junior Matt Carroll, will provide the 
leadership the Irish need. Tonight at Midnight Madness in the Joyce Center, Irish fans will get their first glimpse at life after Murphy. 
"Once Troy made his final decision, we had time to fig­ure out what our team was going to be like," Brey said. "You have four guys who have played a lot of basketball and you have four guys who have won a championship. When you have older guys, you have a chance to be OK." In Humphrey, Graves and Carroll, the Irish have three players who averaged more than 29 minutes a game last season. And Swanagan will be responsible for guarding 
the opponent's top big man, a role he slowly took on as last year progressed. 
"People haven't seen how good we can he because we haven't been able to spread our wings," Graves said. "This year, it's kinda full throttle." 
But the departure of Murphy isn't the only void Brey is worried about filling. Point guard Martin Ingelsby, who led the Irish in total minutes last year, graduated in the spring. Brey 
is looking toward freshman Chris Thomas, who was a McDonald's All-American and Mr. Basketball in Indiana, to be the next Notre Dame point guard. 
However, Brey doesn't know how his young star will respond to the intense pressure he is certain 
to face. "It's not like we have to overanalyze this and wonder who's the point guard. He's the 
guy," Brey said. "I think what helps ...-11111!'!!11, Chris Thomas is those four guys up front. He's playing with four 
men. It's not like there's two freshmen up there. That's real­ly going to help him." · 
"Expectations are high for myself, and I think I've added those expectations to my mind," Thomas said. "Having the upperclassmen here is a key factor for us because it's not like I'm passing the ball to someone who doesn't know what to do with it. I'm passing it to guys who have been here, who have been through key games and the tournament and know what to do with the ball. If I give it up, I'm not going to have to worry about going to get it back like in high school." 
Beyond Notre Dame's starting five, Brey is concerned about depth along the front line. Along the bench, only Tom Timmermans and Jere Macura are taller than 6-foot-9. and neither saw significant playing time last year. 
"I told our guys, it's not that Coach Brey plays only plays six guys," Brey said. "You tell me how many are going to play. Six were all that were ready to do it last year." 
Brey also expects sophomore Torrian Jones to play a more important role this season. Last year, Jones was used pri­marily in defensive situations and as a backup point guard. But Brey expects that to change this year. 
"Torrian Jones really looks good," Brey said. "We certainly got him back in there, he delivered, and I think he learned a lot. I think he's a guy we can call on quickly on the perime­ter." · 
Brey also expects newcomers Jordan Cornette and Chris Markwood to contribute. Markwood, who sat out all of last season after undergoing knee surgery, will be able to relieve Thomas at the point. And Brey is excited to have Cornette, whom he describes as a quick defender who can guard any­one on the floor, big or small. 
"We're going to he a different team and I think our style of play is going to be different," Carroll said. 
But even if this year's Irish have a different look than last year's team, they still want to accomplish the same things they did last year. The Irish believe they are capable of repeating as Big East West Division champions and, if they play consistently in the Big East, will make it back to the NCAA tournament. 
"Ryan's never missed a tournament, and he's made that 
the NCAA championship last April. 
Missing was the imposing figure of Naismith Award winner Ruth Riley. Also graduated and missing were starters Kelley Siemon and Niele Ivey, as well as senior leaders Imani Dunbar and Meaghan Leahy. 
In their place, the six freshmen making up the women's basketball class of 2005 donned the gold for the first time. Forwards Teresa Borton, Jackie Batteast, Katie Flecky, Kelsey Wicks and guards Allison Bustamante and Jill Krause bring in a new crop of talent. And a new set of expectations. 
The Irish were predicted to be the 19th­best team in the country according to Athlon Sports, 20th-best according to Women's Basketball Journal. In fact, Llndy's didn't have the Irish ranked at all. For Irish head coach Muffet McGraw, the goals are still the same. 
"We want to get a first-round bye in the Big East Tournament and we want to host a game in the NCAA Tournament," McGraw said. "I think we have the same goals this year. Maybe instead of a No. 1 seed, maybe we're the 16th seed, the 16th 
see MEN/page 12 
team to get the home court. It doesn't really matter, our goal is to get that home court game." 
Leading the way for the Irish will be two veterans. Forward Ericka Haney, the lone senior on the team, averaged a career­best 11 points per contest last season. This season, Haney will be counted on to provide leadership as well as solid offense and rebounding. 
"That's going to be a real task for Ericka to lead a team with six freshman and two sophomores,"McGraw said. "It's

At first glance Saturday's matchup between Notre Dame and West Virginia appears to produce a similar pair. Both teams are struggling offen­sively, both head coaches have searched for a leader at the quarter­back position and both teams are looking for ways to turn a losing sea­son around. 
But Irish head coach Bob Davie thinks his team has the key to victory: momentum. 
"This week is especially important because we do have what amounts to some momentum right now ... I think this is a criticial stretch for us right now to get things back on track," the fifth-year head coach said. "I think our football team feels better about itself right now obviously after the win. It's a lot easier to coach coming off a win. Just momentum is a funny thing." 
Davie and the Irish hope that momentum is a big enough of a wave to ride out a 1-3 sluggish season start. 
Mountaineer head coach Hich Rodriguez is looking for that same spark. His 2-3 team is suffering through a two-game losing streak and is coming off its worst home shutout loss since 1963 -a 35-0 loss to Virginia Tech. 
Coming into Saturday's contest, both the Irish and the Mountaineers are laboring to put points on the score­board. The Irish, despite some posi­tive signs of point production against Pitt, dwindle at the bottom of the NCAA offensive rankings averaging less than 12 points per game. 
The Mountaineers aren't faring much better. Despite scoring a sea­son-high 34 points against Kent State, 
Rodriguez's team is averaging about 16 points a game. 
Much of the failure to produce points has stemmed from early season quarterback woes. The Irish have gone back and forth between last sea~ son's starter Matt Lovecchio and last season's backup Carlyle Holiday. 
But aftl1r Holiday's effective start at home last w«:)ek, Davie hopes the so called "quarterback controversy" is in the past. 
"I think first of all the reason we went with Carlyle is he's able to cre­ate plays on his own," Davie said. " ... I think you're going to see his devel­opment as a passer ... I don't really worry about him scrambling. In fact, we kind of encourage it because I think he has some amazing ability with the ball in his hand." 
Rodriguez is currently experiencing the struggle for a ball handler that the Irish hope they're through with. 
After a dismal performance against Virginia Tech last week, Rodriguez declared Monday that he is consider­ing replacing starter Brad Lewis in this Saturday's outing. 
"We've got to get better production and he quarterbacks have got to start taking charge more," Rodriguez said. "This week we've got three of them who have got to do it in practice. We'll see how all three of them do." 
Lewis has thrown seven intercep­tions and just three touchdowns. 
Those are numbers the Irish defense wants to capitalize on. 
"They're going to spread the field," Davie said. "They basically play 70 percent of the time with four wide receivers in the game. Obviously you're going to be in a lot of nickel, in a lot of dime." 
The Irish are hurting in the sec­ondary, with Gerome Sapp and Ron Israel at less than full speed. Clifford Jefferson, who sat out of the Pitt game

with an injury will return to the line­up but won't start. Vontez Duff will for the second game in a row start in his place. 
Injuries to the defensive unit aren't the only Irish impediments. 
Tony Fisher's status reamains a 
game-time decision. The senior tail­back suffered a knee and hamstring injury during last week's outing.

Vollers grows up 
Senior tackle once thought he'cl stay smaller-now, he is the biggest man on the team 
By MIKE CONNOLLY Sports Writer 
Kurt Vollers has grown a lot at 
Notre Dame. 
He's bulked up from the 240­
pound defensive lineman who 
enrolled in the fall of 1997 to the 
324-pound offensive tackle set to 
graduate this December. He's 
gone from someone who never 
lifted weights until his junior 
year of high school to a putting 
up 450 pounds on the bench 
press. 
But more importantly than the 
weight he's put on or the 
strength he's gained, he's grown 
as a person. 
"I was kind of a slacker my 
first couple of years here," he 
said. "I wasn't really into the 
football scene. It was just me." 
His father, John Vollers, saw 
the change in his son. Lou Holtz 
told John Vollers when he 
recruited his son in 1996 that he 
would grow as a person at Notre 
Dame. And that growth would be 
most apparent between his 
sophomore and senior years. 
"When he talks to his brothers 
and sisters, there is a direct 
reflection that wasn't there 
before," John Vollers said. 
Five years later, as the most 
experienced offensive lineman on 
the team, Kurt Vallers is a team 
player and in some ways a 
leader. 
"I've never really been the 
leadership type of guy," Kurt 
Vollers said. "I don't like follow­
ing others eithfff to tell you the 
truth. But I've never really been 
the one that goes out and makes 
sure everyone else follows him. 
But some of the positional coach­
es said this is something that I 
had to do. These are the shoes I 
am wearing so I have to walk in 
them." 
After Notre Dame started 0-3, 
Kurt Vollers took some huge leadership strides with the rest of the offensive lineman. In his final . season, he wasn't going to go out 
a loser. 
"The big thing for me was I 
didn't come back for a losing 
season and I am not going to let 
it slip to that," Kurt Vallers said. 
"I just want to bring a big season 
back and take all these guys with 
me." 
"Kurt Vallers has come a long 
way," head coach Bob Davie 
said. "Early on he fought acade­
mics, fought some maturity 
things that you go through and 
was injured. Now he's come on 
and been a real leader for us." 
Although he has grown a lot 
and learned a lot about himself 
and his abilities, there are still 
many areas where he doesn't 
know everything. And, in per­
haps the greatest sign of his 
maturity, he willingly admits that 
he doesn't do everything right. 
"Sometimes I am sure I don't 
do the right thing," Kurt Vallers 
said. "I am not the person [the 
coaches] want me to be but it is 
something I go out to practice 
and try to do." 
And when Kurt Vollers need 
advice and guidance for the 
things he doesn't know, he turns 
to one person: his father John. 
Father knows best 
Throughout his life, Kurt 
up· close & personal 
WITH KURT VOLLERS 

Kurt Vollers 
birthdate: April 4, 1979 hometown: Whittier, Calif. major: sociology favorite place on campus: dining hall 
a word to describe me on the field: nasty aword to describe me off the field: light hearted the best advice I've ever received: 
"Never say anything you wouldn't want to see in the paper the next day" 
I wish I could switch places for a day with: Jon Bon Jovi 
Vollers has listened to his father's advice. 
''I've always tried to go with what my father though was the best for me and it's always seemed to work," Kurt Vallers said. "I just keep going down this path." 
When Kurt Vollers was a high­ly touted high school prospect and major programs from across the country knocked on his door with scholarship offers, he turns to his father for guidance. With nearly every school presenting sparkling offers full of promises and praise, John Vollers helped Kurt Vallers look at what really mattered. 
"I would say the No. 1 thing when he and I talked about the different scholarship offers from different schools, one of the things we talked about was the quality of education he could get and the support of the alumni," John Vallers said. 
That narrowed the choices down to Notre Dame and USC. In the end, Notre Dame won out. 
"Of the two schools that were strongest with [alumni support], SC's [alumni support] was if you stayed in southern California [for a job] but ND was nationwide," John Vollers said. 
So the self-described "surfer­skater guy" took his father's advice and signed up for a col­lege hundreds of miles from the beach. But even though he'll admit Notre Dame was the best school for him, he looks forward to his return to California. 
"Two and a half more months," he said. "I'll be back on the beach. I don't know if I'll be surfing yet, but I'll get back on the board eventually." 
Now that he is at Notre Dame, Kurt Vallers still listens to his

Pittsburgh last weekend. 
father's advice -especially dur­ing the tough times. 
Some of the lessons he has tried to instill in his son over the years include the basics like the Golden Rule and basic tolerance for other people. But his most important piece of advice is to live for the moment. 
"Basically you learn from your past, you prepare for your future but the only thing you have con­trol over is right now," John Vollers said. "If the football team has several losses, you can't cry over them. You just have to be prepared for the next game." 
Since the Fiesta Bowl in January, that has been some of the most important advice John Vallers has given his son. But at the same time, Kurt Vollers already knew that lesson. 
"We started off with three loss­es but I am going to try to put those behind me until the end of the season," he said. "Maybe I will be pissed off about them later, but now is not the time." 
"I think he already knew [what to do]," John Vollers said. "I tend to reinforce it. I give him some analogies or stories or situations that I have been through in the past. Everyone goes through tough times at different times in their lives. This won't be the first. This won't be the last thing that is challenging." 
Stepping up 
Kurt Vollers' first public chal­lenge at Notre Dame came on Nov. 13, 1999. Starting tackle Jordan Black was down with an injury so Kurt Vallers was pro­moted to starting tackle. 
"We were in a bad situation that season," Kurt Vallers said. "A lot of people were down. I really wanted to go in there and show people that I deserved to go in there and be in that position. I hadn't done that previously." 
The promotion was thought to be temporary. Once the injuries healed, Kurt Vollers would be back on the bench. But he didn't want to follow that plan. 
"There was an·injury and peo­ple were like 'Oh well, you'll play this year but as soon as next year comes around, the injuries will heal up and you'll be back on the bench,"' he said. "I wanted to make sure that if I get a chance to get on that field. I am not com­ing off that field." 
Nineteen games later, Kurt Vollers is still starting and has never missed a start. But while Kurt Vallers is not a giant fixture at tackle for the Irish, he never wanted to play offense. When he came to Notre Dame, he wanted to stay small and he wanted to stay on defense. 
"Everyone said I was going to play otf ense in college but my big thing was that I was going to stay below 250 and be a defensive end," 6-foot-7, 324-pound Kurt Vollers said. 
Unfortunately for Kurt Vallers his genes were against him. His great-great-grandfather was close to seven feet tall while his great-great-great-grandfather was rumored to be more than seven feet tall. 
"We've got this picture of this guy sitting at a table and every­one else looks like they are midgets," John Vallers said. 
Thousands of calories a day and three and a half hours of off­season workouts four-five times a week quickly turned the slen­der freshman into the giant fifth­year senior of today. 
"It was hard work getting big­ger because I didn't want myself to," Kurt Vallers said. "Everyone else loved it except for me." 
The biggest thing Kurt Vollers missed on the offensive side of the ball was the glory. The aver­age fan doesn't really notice the offensive line until it makes a mistake. But defensive linemen · get to make tackles and cele­brate sacks. 
But now the more mature Kurt Vollers is more comfortable out­side the spotlight. 
"Only the people that count know [when he makes a good play)." Kurt Vollers said. "You aren't going to get the slap on the back from the guy at the bar but the people that matter know." 
Kurt Vollers knows. His father knows. And his coach knows. 
"Kurt Vallers is a guy that the upside was pretty high because of his body type, his quickness," Davie said. "It doesn't surprise me what he's done. Because he's matured, he's turned into a real­ly good football player."

COACHING QUARTERBACKS IRISH RUSHING IRISH PASSING 
Davie earned a huge win last week, but for the head coach of Notre Dame, the pressure never stops. However, his staff has been together for a while and it seems like they're genuinely working to turn this team around.  Last week, Holiday showed how much he had improved after a dis­asterous start at Texas A&M. He finished 10-for­13 passing and added a huge 67-yard touchdown run. The big question is if this young quarterback can stay poised when his team falls behind.  Fisher and Jones contin­ue to trade carries throughout the game., but Fisher's status is uncertain for Saturday. Last week, Holiday showed he can be a dan­gerous weapon running the pall.  So far this season, the longest completion the Irish have is a 19-yard pass. Rogers seems reluctant to call deep passes with a young quarterback. Instead he relies on short comple­tions needed to pick up key first downs.

their inexperience.  
Cobourne carries the entire weight of the Mountaineer rushing game on his shoulders. He averages 4.2 yards a carry and at 138 total carries, has the most carries of any Mountaineer running back.  Davie credits Rodriguez with inventing the spread offense. West Virginia often has four receivers in the game and they spread the ball around. However, most of their completions are short passes.  The Mountaineers don't have a dominant punter, a flashy return man or an awesome kicker. But they do have guys that get the job done. Rauh is 7-for-9 in field goals and Fazzolari averages 42 yards a punt.  Trying to win in Notre Dame Stadium is tough -very tough. And it's especially harder for a first-year head coach like Rodriguez who isn't expected to win Saturday by anyone in his program.

While the Mountaineers special teams unit is adequate. it can't change the game like Notre Dame!s can. The best big-play capability of the Irish lies in their return game -they have to be watched and they can always turn lose a big return.  It's a lot easier for Holiday to play whnn he's in front ofa friendly crowd. Playing at home is a tremendous advan­tage for the Irish team as a whole, arid it could make for a long day for Rodriguez.

Davie hit the nail on the head earlier this week-: The Irish team and the Irish have finally built some finally have what they were desperately missing in momentum. Look for the Irish running attack games past -momentum. Sometimes momentum is just to ground down the Mountaineer defense and what a team needs and West Virginia doesn't have the the Irish secondary to make some big plays for talent to overcome that this week. The Mountaineers are the second week in a row. coming off of their worst home shutout in nearly 40 years. West Virginia will come out sluggish and never

Wide Right. 
These two words made this interstate rivalry one of the favorites across the nation. In 1991 and 1992 Florida State lost its only games of the year to Miami on two last minute field goal attempts that went wide right. 
From 1995 to 1999, Florida State beat Miami five straight times, appar­ently erasing its fans' wide right nightmares. 
But last year, the night­
mare occurred again. 
Seminole kicker Matt 


Munyon kicked a 49-yard field goal that flew wide right and the Hurricanes won 27-24 in the Orange Bowl. 
But the Seminoles got the last laugh, just not on. the field. 
The BCS voted Florida State into the national championship game instead of Miami to play Oklahoma. The No. 2 Hurricanes are still upset, and they want pay­back this Saturday against the No. 14 Seminoles. 
Miami has the nation's second longest winning streak at 14. Florida State has a 54 game

unbeaten streak at Doak Campbell stadium, with the last loss being the 17­16 "wide righter" against Miami in 1991. 
The Hurricanes cruised through their first four games. One reason is an easy schedule. But there is no denying the Hurricanes have an awe­some talent level. Quarterback Ken Dorsey, a leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy. has thrown for 1,066 yards and eight touchdowns so far this year. 
The Seminoles have been limited by injuries this year, especially at wide receiver. They lost

"We don't have the depth we did in the past," Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden said. 
Seminole quarterback Chris Rix leads all fresh­men in the nation with 838 passing yards. 
On paper, the Hurricanes are a much better football team than the injury-plagued ­Seminoles. But if the Hurricanes think they can merely show up in order to leave Doak Stadium with a win, their national title hopes will be gone. 
Purdue at Michigan 
There is a three-way tie atop the Big Ten standings. Two of those three collide this weekend as No. 17 Purdue takes on No. 12 Michigan in the Big House. 
The Boilermakers look to improve to 5-0 for the first time since 1945. Purdue is still a passing team with an explosive offense. However, its defense is just as good, led by Akin Ayodele and Matt Mitrione along the defen­sive line. The defense gave up just 207 yards to Iowa last week. 
This week is homecoming in Ann Arbor. 
"The Homecoming is. supposed to he a guaranteed win," Michigan head coach Lloyd Carr said. "They are the best team we have played." 
Michigan already played No. 10 Washington and Illinois. 
Michigan has the worst-ranked pass defense in the Big Ten. They must tighten up against Purdue. The run defense and offense are solid. Quarterback John Navarre threw for 246 yards and running back B.J. Askew ran for 122 in a 20-0 whitewash of Penn State last Saturday.
