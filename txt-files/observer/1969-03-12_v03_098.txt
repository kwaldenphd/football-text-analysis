Monday the OBSERVER endorsed Phil McKenna. We would like to reiterate that endorsement, and urge the student body to elect McKenna SBP today. He has proven that he has the courage of his convictions in the past. We trust McKenna's judgment and admire his pcrseverence. 
lie has campaigned off campus this year, visiting students in their homes. But more than that he has an interest in their affairs and their almost non-existent part of the student body. He is interested in re-organizing the housing list and proposes to include a commissioner in his cabinet to deal specifically with the so-called "day dogs." 
lie has long been a supporter of hall autonomy and recognizes the place of the hall as the basis of community life. As chairman of the Hall Presidents' Council, McKenna was the prime author of the HPC' hall life report, from which the SLC report was drawn. We appreciate his dedication to student opinion in the past and have confidence in him in the future. 
His running mate Fred Dedrick has considerable experience in academic affairs, the most important part of a University community, having worked on it for two years and being a member of the Student Senate academic affairs committee. 
Further we arc extremely interested in McKenna's proposal of a University Senate. Though a long-range plan, it certainly deserves study and investigation now for implementation in future years. 
We ask the student body to consider that the Student Union President in a press conference admitted that the Pornography and Censorship Conference sponsored by the Academic Commission was a result of "poor planning." 
We ask you to consider McKenna's main 
opponent's proven recon.l and experience in student 
government (none). 
Finally we ask you to vote for Phil McKenna.

Ray enters Nashville prison for life 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (UI'I) Wearing chains and true to the silent code of a convict, James Earl Ray took the secrets of the slaying of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. yesterday behind the walls of the Tl·nncsscc State Prison when· nearly half the inmates arc blacks. 
Ray, who pleaded guilty Monday in exchange for a 99 year Sl'nlcncc, was taken from his Shelby County Jail cell in Memphis at 5:30a.m., rushed to a highway patrol barracks ncar the county line, then sped 200 miles to Nashville in an eight car caravan. 
Ray will spend the next six weeks undergoing a series of tests, and at the end of that time it will be decided if he will be kept in maximum security or integrated with the other prisoners. 
The deal in which the 41 year old Ray was permitted to plead guilty in exchange for his life left the King caSl' shrouded in as much mystery as ever. 
At one point in the brief trial, Ray seemed on the brink of saying a conspiracy existed in the King slaying, but he stopped short saying, "I don't want to add something ... that I haven't agreed on in the past." 

Pelllng warns Soviets of destruction 
!lONG KONG (UPI) Radio Peking yesterday warned the Soviet 
Union that any attempt to invade Communist China would bring 
"fatal destruction." It said the Russians "already owe the Chinese 
peopk blood debts" which must be repaid. 
The warning caml' as Red China delivered a sternly-worded note 
to Soviet authorities about damages inflicted on the Chinese 
embassy in Moscow by demonstrators. 
The l'ek ing note contended Soviet officials had organized the 
''lkspicabll'" massive demonstrations hy Russians against the 
embassy in Moscow last wel'k. The demonstrators, who numhcrl'd in 
the tens of thousands, smashed windows and hurled ink bottles at

SBP Poll Tighter! 
The third and final OBSERVER straw poll revealed still another narrowing of the gap between Student Body Presidential candidates John Mroz and Phil McKenna; the percentage difference has now dropped from five to two. As would be expected, the number of undecided voters has taken a sharp drop, while the number of Kendall supporters has remained 
the  same.  The  decrease  in  the

on demonstrations 
Saint Mary's College President Msgr. John J. Md;rath issued a statement to Saint Mary's students and faculty members yesterday outlining steps to be taken in the event of a disruptive demonstration on the campus. The statement resulted from a study by the Academic Affairs Council and the Student Affairs Council. 
Student Body President Therese Ambrusko stated that the Student Affairs Council had studied Father Heshurgh's state­ment, but "did not agree with him that the Dean of Students should have the right to immed­iately judge a demonstration dis­ruptive. At Saint Mary's, except in cases of extreme emergency, the Dean of Students docs not have that right. She must consult 

Rev. John McGrath 

with student and faculty repre­sentatives from thl' Student Affairs Council." 
Miss Ambrusko said "I con­sider burning or bodily blocking a passageway interference with the normal operation of the col­lege. I do not consider picketing or marching a disruption." Dr. Mark Bambcnck, a faculty repre­sentative to thl' Student Affairs Council, stated: "In my opinion, moral suasion is not disruptive. If somconl· stopped me physi­cally from l'ntning a huilding, I Morrissey, and also lead solidly

SMC Pres. on disruptions 
TO THE SAINT MARY'S COLLEGE COMMUNITY, 
As a result of serious study by both the Academic Affairs Council and the Student Affairs Council, the following policy regarding campus disruptions has been adopted. This policy takes full cognizance of the right to freedom and assembly. 
Any activity of a person or group of persons which constitutes a violation of the rights of any Individual or which interferes or Impedesthe normal operation of the community is hereby declared a disruption.
In the event of a disruption, the following procedure will be followed and enforced. The primary responsibility for judging a disruption rests in the hands of tho Dean of Students or i1er delegated alternate. In making this judgment, the Dean shall consult with student and faculty representatives from the Student Affairs Council. However, In cases of grave emergency, such as bodily harm being inflicted, property damage, or imminent danger thereof, the Dean Is empowered to act immediately. Once the decision has been made that a disruption exists, the Dean of Students shall notify the person or persons Involved that they are causing a disruption and must cease and desist. A Iter a IS·minute interval, those who have not ceased and desisted will be asked to properly identify themselves as members of the College community and are automatically suspended. Those who do not or will not properly identify themselves will be charged with trespass. If there is no movement to cease and desist after five minutes, any student under suspension will be expelled, any faculty member under suspension will be dismissed and treated as trespassers. All trespasserswill be dealt with by the civil authorities. 
All student appeals for suspension or expulsion shall be made to the Appellate Board according to the procedures established by the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities". Faculty members have recourse to the procedures as stated In the "Faculty Ma-nual". These appeals shall be judged within live (5) days.
The relationship between the academic community of Saint Mary'sCollege and that of Notre Dame University Is unique. Not only are cultural and social activities made available to the students and facultyfrom both institutions, but in recent years academic facilities, lectures, the use of libraries, etc. have been extended to all. The Notre Dame-Saint Mary's community is In many ways a single community. 
Saint Mary's College recognizes the right of the Unlver51tY of Notre Dame to withdraw University privileges from a Saint Mary's student or faculty member In the event of their participation In disruptiveactivities on University grounds. The method of withdrawing such privileges and any appeal from such withdrawal shall be controlled bythe procedures of the University of Notre Dame. 
It should be noted that "the Saint Mary's College community 
reserves the right to take action against a student who Is found to be a 
threat to the College community as a re~)Jit of her off-campus 
activities... 

Saint Mary's College has, In turn, the right to withdraw similar 
privileges of any member of the Notre Dame community who 
participates in disruptive activities on Saint Mary's grounds. fhe 
method of such withdrawal and appeals shall follow the procedure
outlined above.

In Alumni speaker series 


Hesburgh speaks at Alumni 
Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, University President, went to the grass roots last night as he met with Alumni Hall residents in their own chapel at 9:00 p.m. The meeting, which was the first of an Alumni-planned weekly series, consisted entirely of informal questions and answers, and covered a myriad of topics, both campus-wide and national. 
VOTE 
Snoopy for student body dog . Porky for student body pig On the Charlie Brown platform 
Father Hesburgh opened by commenting, "It's good to see so many of you in church," and proceeded by answering the first query, which concerned his now-famous letter on campus violence. "The press rather loused up its treatment of the letter," he said, "but the main reason for it was this: the members of the community wanted me to do something on the subject of academic disturbances, with the stipulation that it be something fair. The result was my letter, which lays out one of the ground rules demanded by the community." The President 
remarked that his form of action 
was only one of several possible 
methods, but that he felt it was 
the best one. 
Hesburgh stressed the need 

for increased enrollment of 
minority groups, stating that 
"The improvement of ghetto 
high schools is far more 
important than the lowering of 
our admissions standards." He 
did advocate, however, special 
tutoring courses for 
underpriveleged freshmen for as 
long as needed. He also promised 
better food preparation in the 
dining halls, with the additional 
promise that "If the food isn't 
better next year, l'll go over 
~very night and eat it myself." 
Regarding the question of 

co-education at Notre Dame the 
President hinted that a cl~ster 
system of girls' colleges will 
probably happen before the 
University goes "internally 
co-ed." Several students 
expressed impatience with the 
present social structure, 
however, to which Hcsburgh 
replied, "I definitely agree that 
female companionship is 
necessary here, but people (i.e., 
Barat College) who said they 
would deliver didn't deliver." 
Hesburgh also acknowledged 

that the parietal hours resolution 
passed by the Student Life 
Council would be coming before 
the Board of Trustees in ten 
days, and that it would be "an 
uphill fight. But 1'1 do what I 
can." 
The University President concluded by expressing his faith in Notre Dame: "It's got a great tradition, which I think will be preserved. Contrary to what many people think, this place is not going broke, pagan, or to hell." 
Author 
threatens to sue 
The Student Union faces a 

possible law suit as a result of 
the unscheduled second 
performance of Ladv Godiva 
during the Pornogr~phy and 
Censorship Conference. 
Ronald Talvel, New York 

author of the play, announced 
that he has asked his agents to 
file suit against the Student 
Union for royalties owed him 
and for punitive damages. 
Talvel claims that the Student 

Union owes him $160 in 
royalties for the second 
performance of /.ady Godil'a 
and for the unscheduled 
performance of another play, 
The Secret Ufe of Juanita Castro. 
"They (the Student Union) 

paid for the first performance," 
Talvel said, "but they refused to 
pay for the second and third 
performances." 
"They pretended that on the 

one hand they had no contract 
and on the other hand that they 
were not responsible for the 
performance," he said. 
Talvcl claims that since the 

Union brought the play to 
campus they were the producers 
and so arc legally responsible for 
any performances on campus. 
He says that the Union, 
therefore, owes royalties for the 
two unscheduled performances.

Racism? 

"Racism ('rii".siz em) a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race" (p. 704, Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary). 
The use of this particular word at Notre Dame, in the SBP election and elsewhere, is more bothersome than all those four letter words of Vaceline, Uranus, et al. The latter are simply somewhat obscene and a childish gesture of rebellion to shock readers and 
attract  attention  to  the  users.  The  former  is  much  more  serious  
because  its application  to  Notre  Dame,  as  an  institution  or as a  
community, is libelous and defamatory.  

The charge of racism, institutional or otherwise, is based on an erroneous notion of what the word means, the use of it being justified on two (inaccurate) grounds. First, the community is said to be characterized by racial prejudice, e.g. people in the next room talking about "niggers" and "chummy" whites deserting blacks at mixers. 
Second, the argument goes, blacks start out with an unequal educational opportunity and therefore any institution which docs not try to help equalize that opportunity significantly is institu­tionally racist. On this point Notre Dame is said to give only token support to the equalization of opportunity. 
It is proper to study the truth of these accusations, of course; but another question must be raised which goes beyond the truth of the individual charges. There arc students at Notre Dame who say "nigger" and avoid blacks at mixers, and Notre Dame's aid to blacks will not equalize opportunity for them overnight, or even this year. But what must be noted is that, even were they I 00% true. neither of these constitutes grounds for a charge of racism. It is debatable that many whites arc dislc·yal to black friends and it is dehatable that Notre Dame's admissions policy is unfair; these charges <trc bona fide expressions of opinion which deserve serious evaluation, though not necessarily agreement. 
The charge of racism, however, ought to be abhorred by any thinking individual, as being irresponsibly libelous, because the evidence on which the charge is based has nothing to do with a belief in the inherent superiority of whites over blacks. 
The question then becomes "why do people employ this particular word?" The answer is found in the usc which can be made of the overtones of "racism." It has connotations, intermingled, of Hitler, fascism, apartheid, a disproven, unscientific theory, the stereotype of the Southern "bad guy" who says "nigger" and admits that he uses it derogatorily. These connotations make the charge of racism particularly strong language, and justifiably so, for racism is a thoroughly evil belief. 
The word, then, because of these strongly derogatory connota­tions, can be used to degrade an opponent and make people fearful of saying things which may bring down upon their heads that charge. In fact, it is used at Notre Dame for that purpose -to degrade anyone who opposes any black dc.mand, no matter what the demand or the reason for opposition. In many ways, the whole usc is similar to the use of "communist" by Joe McCarthy in the early 1950's, when he tried to frighten people into acting a particular way by making extreme charges against so many people. There was a certain hysteria against opponents too, that is present now. 
The result is that anyone who opposes any black demand is ( H itlerian, a bigot, unChristian) ... a racist. Moreover, it has reached the point where anyone who says that Notre Dame is not a racist institution is ... somehow ... a racist.

"We came up over Memorial Day weekend, and the latest lists fiom the Off-Campus Housing cc," reported one graduate student. "We start­out the next day at about 8 o'clock, and by n my wife and !'were ready to give up. We saw dirty slum housing for from $85 to $95 a than I ever thought existed. Some were cd buildings without a single unbroken pane glass." The Off-Campus Commission maintains lists of vailablc housing for students which arc updated odically. They are compiled by landlords and coming to· the office and answering a uestionnaire about the facilities offered. owevcr, the Commission specifics that such a should not be construed by students as any ype of guarantee.

He added that the only criterion that the mmission mmy use to strike a listing is evidence that the landlord is discriminating by race or other standards. This is the only type of guarantee implied in a Commission listing.

hear of this apartment through a friend at school, and I grabbed it. Going through a realtor or the newspaper seemed to up the rents almost ten percent." There arc several apartment complexes for young marrieds in the South Bend-Mishawaka area but the rents here run in the neighborhood of $90 per month. They arc unfurnished, but they do have the advantage that they arc well taken care of and maintainance and other services are provided. University Village, about one-half mile north of the two campuses, has I08 units available for married Notre Dame students over 21. They arc managed by Mr. and Mrs. Robert Walters, who arc students themselves. But they arc hard to get into. "We begin taking applications in the spring," said Walters, "and we try to give preference to couples with children. We inform those couples that we have accepted around the first of May. From then on, it is strictly on a first come, first served basis." The apartments rent for $70 per month, plus utilities. Tenants arc provided with household appliances, but must bring other furnishings. The complex is University-owned and arc rather at­tractive. However, because of the over-21 rule and the long waiting list, most of the residents arc graduate students, although a few undcrgrads do manage to get in. Unfortunately, neither the colleges, nor the city have given any indication that there will be an expansion of student housing in general or married student housing in particular. South Bend docs not provide adequate housing for the large student population here, so it would seem that the institutions themselves would start a building program to alleviate the situation. Howcvl'f, the expense of such a project would be high, and few officials have given the subject much thought. "Housing is bad for all off-campus students," said Mike Phelps, "but for the marrieds, it's murder." The situation has assumed the form of a status quo without any change likely in the ncar future.
