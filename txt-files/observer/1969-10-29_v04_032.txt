, McKenna reports on important student issue 
by Don Ruane "When you elect someone ... you elect him for his insights and to be your leader and not just to do everything the majority wills all the time, is the philosophy I have tried to follow since I was elected'., said SG President Phil McKenna as he commented on his administration and some of the issues it has faced. One of the problems McKenna sees is the lack of understanding among the students in regard to what his administration has done. For this reason "Project Reach" has been instituted. "Project Reach" attempts to "reach down into he basic needs of students" by having members of the student government visit the halls to explain and answer questions on

In regard to the Board of Trustees, McKenna said that ttu: students will now havd representatives on the Student Affairs Committee. The number 
of  representatives  and  their  
power  has  not  yet  beert  
determined.  There  are  eight  

trustees on the committee and McKenna intends to propose that there be eight students, both graduate and undergraduate, placed on the committee. McKenna expressed optimism in the body when he stated, "I'm thinking it will probably be at least as effective as the University Forum and perhaps more so because it is a smaller body and it's a body that

exists for student affairs and there aren't five elements all coming together to talk." He is also hopeful that suggestions and explanations will then be carried to the trustees. 
McKenna has reservations about the University Forum because it is basically a discussion session and he feels that talk is not a substitute for positive action. McKenna also said that the presence of five elements on the forum would limit the number of possil-,le topics to be discussed. 
The progress of his administration has satisfied McKenna. He listed five basic reasons for this success:

GSU invites MBA, Law students 
by Bro. Patrick Carney 
Two new organizations have been invited to seat representa­tives on the Graduate Student Union according to Jim King, acting president of the newly formed organization. 
King stated that both the law students and M.B.A. candidates were issued separate invitations because, although they are grad­uate students, they come under different deans. All of the gradu­ate students who have joined the organization up to this point are

members of the "Graduate School" of which Fr. Beichner is the Dean. 
When asked his general im­pressions of the progress of GSU to date, King replied that he feels "it is progressing very favorably." He added that he hopes for "full participation within two weeks." 
At the group's last meeting, 21 out of 30 departments were represented by over 70 dele­gates. That session saw Constitu­tion, Procedures and Credentials, Agenda, Social, and Finance Committees formed. 
Copies of the first draft of the group's constitution have been distributed to the graduate stu­dents. Among other details, the document calls for every depart­ment to be represented by at

least one voting member with 
the larger departments being al­lowed one delegate for every· twenty grad students. Presently, all departments are in the pro­cess of determining who will serve in this capacity. 
In the meantime, King, a sociology major, has been meet­ing with Fr. Hesburgh and Stu­dent Body President Phil McKenna concerning representa­tion of GSU on the proposed University Forum and the Stu­dent Affairs Committee. Current plans are to seat two members on each of these boards. 
The role of the GSU in these 
two bodies will be among the topics to be discussed at the group's next meeting on Friday, October 31. Mr. King would also like to see some discussion on the proposal to have two separate Ph.D. degrees--one for teaching and the other for re­search. 
As he spoke of the coming meeting, the acting president stressed that GSU meetings are open to all graduate students aUhough only the official repre­sentatives may vote. He would like to see as many as possible attend Friday's meeting which will be held at noon in the Library Lounge.

The big show 

Way back last November, Richard Nixon was elected President ,)f the United States on what was generally considered 'to be a "law and order" campaign platform. Now we all know what law and order means--keep those filthy longhaired creatures off our T.V. screens, please don't let the Blacks burn down suburbia, and shades of Don Hynes, keep our red, white, and blue toilet bowl clean and shining. 
Now it's put up or shut up time for Mr. Nixon, and he's treating us all to the worst example of kangaroo justice since Huey Newton was sentenced to ten years in prison on the basis of contradictory testimony and conjecture. The Administration badly needed to make an example of someone, so why not pick eight leaders of dissenting groups and screw them all at once. Beautiful. Take three leaders of National Mobilization, the Acting Chairman of the Black Panthers, a student, the founder of SDS, and two celebrated founders of the Youth International Party, throw them all together, charge them with violation of a questionable law, build a case of fabricated evidence and everything will be o.k. again. Not only do you entertain the fr~ htened majority with a witch-burning, but you also remove eight very persistent thorns from your side. 
Of wurse, the right personnel have to be chosen to produce this extravaganza. The prosecuting attorney, Assistant Attorney General Will Wilson, has been 4uoted extensively on his attitudes towards such people as the Eight: 
"I think if you could get all of them in the penitentiary, you'd stop it. The ringleaders, I'm talking about." "In the area of balancing free speech against public order, my heavy leaning would be on the side of public order." "I'd call something a riot sooner than maybe other people might. Don't you think that's the attitude generally of this Administration?" Good boy, Will. 
But there has been one slipup. The only judge available to the Administration for the show, was a seventy-some year old tyrant who does more harm to the show than good. Not used to having such goings-on in his courtroom, Judge Julius Hoffman is destroying any semblance of legality which might have remained. His repressive methods of procedure are so obvious as to ruin the whole effect. 
For example, during the first two weeks of the trial, six attornies were cited for contempt, and two were jailed without regard for due process. The courtroom was stacked with prosecution sympathizers a Ia Democratic convention '6R (The Republicans learned fast). Over

In an exclusive interview with The Observer, Dean Thomas T. Murphy of the College of Busi­ness Administration announced major curriculum revisions to be implemented next Fall. 
The revisions call for 5 I of the 126 hours required for grad­uation to be centered within the business student's area of con­centration: finance, marketing, accounting, or management. Fifty-one hours will also be al­lotted to the humanities, social and physical sciences, theology, and philosophy. The remaining

We are experimenting now. We would like to be able to eventually run some stock prices AND an analysis of the

We want it to be student oriented, however, and be able to give Notre Dame's budding financial analysts and candidates for Boards of Trustees a chance to experiment with some of their ideas, and to be exposed to the criticism and comments of the rest of the community.

The Dean also revealed plans for expansion of the Business School enrollment. 
"It's very possible," he said, "that a balance might be struck sometime in the future that would be a little different in numbers than we have currently. We feel that our faculty, our facilities, and our organizational structure will enable us to have about 1200 students ... We are aiming to increase our graduate operation to 400, and we think our undergraduate number 
would probably be 800-900 stu­dents. 
Currently, the college has ap­proximately I050 students at the undergraduate level, with about 95 graduate students en­rolled in the Graduate School. Emphasis is on the integration of the two levels-graduate and un­dergraduate--as evidenced by the lack of two distinct faculties and facilities. 

Dean Murphy also indicated that the Graduate School has planned to institute a Master of Public Administration (MPA) program by 1972, and a Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) program by 1975. In addition, serious study is being given to the formation of spe­
cialized,  non-credit  refresher

As to pass-fail courses, Dean Murphy is optimistic: "I think we would favor a kind of pass­fail system. One reason why I personally would favor it would be to attract good students from other parts of the University who might not have the back­ground they think would be essential to take certain courses, but who would like the exposure to knowledge that comes from such courses." 

In regard to the content of business school curricula, Dean Murphy cited three major deve­lopments at Notre Dame. 
F i r s t, h e o u t I in e d out greater role the computer will play in business courses. The College presently maintains its own computer facilities and the Dean foresees the time when all business students will take at least one course in computer science. The method currently employed by the College is the systems or wholistic approach, as opposed to the "hardware" approach, largely because the former offers greater flexibility for the future executive.

We would also like to have on our faculty people who do involve themselves in public affairs." 
Dean Murphy summed up by saying: "In the past quarter century, the Business School has come a long way-from providing vocationally-oriented training to giving a more general education." 
Thiidly, future plans for the College provide for the increas­ing importance of international business, and include the possi­bility of a year of study abroad. An initial effort in this area as the 16-day Seminar of European Money Markets over Spring vaca-

number of students and faculty visited European financial ce~-­ters. This seminar will be contin·· ued again this year. In addition, a marketing seminar has been instituted, which will enable a first-hand view of the marketing procedures of U.S. firms on the continent, also over the spring vacation. Increased course offer­ings in the international area are also under serious consideration. 
On the involvement of busi­
ness students with the social and 
moral issues of today, Dean 
Murphy commented: "There 
probably is less of an activist 
attitude among business students 
here and elsewhere than among 
other groups of students." 
Nevertheless, he feels that 
business students are concerned 
with social issues: "I think gen­
erally our students are involved, 
but maybe it's a different kind 
of involvement." The Dean 
cited a number of cases of busi· 
ness students aiding the Urban 
League, the Logan School, 
VISTA, and the Peace Corps.
