Bengal Bouts a tie to time when Catholics were the poor 

Rumor has it the Bengal Bouts are doomed. 
As soon as MBA student Pete Culhane passed out Monday evening after a sparring match, the opponents of Notre Dame boxing had a field day. 
They cited last year's death ofKorean boxer Duk-Koo Kim and asked why civilized Notre Dame students should put their lives in the hands of an opponent wearing I 0-ounce gloves. 
They pointed to the tragic irony ofone man suffering possible brain damage to send money to Holy Cross missions in Bangledesh and clamored for the abolition ofsuch a brutal sport. 
Culhane was outweighed by a superior opponent, but as one observer put it, "Culhane was proud -he didn't want to admit he was outclassed." 
Culhane, stunned repeatedy throughout the match, was asked if he felt like going on each time he got hit hard. He continued, believing stopping the match would be a cop out. 
At first glance, some might wonder why the Ben· 
gal Bouts, which seem so sonal achievement, have dangerous, would continue been stripped of their 'sur· to be a part of Notre Dame viva! instincts and lead a tradition. relatively easy life. ~

There seems to be a deep significance in the bouts which does not exist in any other team sport, an exis· tential call to stay alive. 
It is this fighting spirit which was so characteristic of immigrant U.S. Catholics in the 19th Century. 
Once among the lowest rungs of U.S. culture, Italians and Irish literally had to fight to stay alive in the ghettos of New York, Chicago, Boston and New Orleans. 
Now among the highest rungs of that same social lad· der, Irish and Italian Americans have lost touch with what it meant to be the underdog. 
Tht. underdogs are now blacks and Hispanics, and it is they who must now tight to make it. 
At Notre Dame, however, a predominantly white es· tablishment school, the Bengal Bouts give at least lip service to the day!> when Catholic boys had to be rough and tough enough to fend off bullies.

fight -the opponents were bigotted Anglo-Saxon 
Protestants -just to stay alive. 
Catholics had little positions of power and few pos· sessions to lose, except their pride. And fighting was a simple way of proving one's manhood. 
Notre Dame students today, however, have more to lose than pride. Any trip to a dormitory room would confirm how much students here think of money,

Roemer emphasized that the 
liahilty qut·stion "is not tht· major 
concern of tht· University." 
"The role that alcohol plays in the 
life of studt·nts is our major con­
cern," Roemer said. Many students 
sent to his office arc thcrt· because of 
alcohol-rdatcd disciplinary 
problems, he said. 
Roemer addt•d he was "reluctant 
to second guess the PACE commit­
tee," which will soon make a deci­
sion on alcohol use at Notre Dame. 
However, he said if they ruled in 
favor of a dry campus, he would an­
ticipate some problems with en­
forcement at first, but eventually the 
studt·nt body would follow the new 
ruling. 
Rich Hunter, assistant professor of management at Notre Dame, and an attorney, cxpn·~o;ed many of the same ideas as Roemer regarding the possible liahilty ofthe University in a lawsuit. 
The "dry campus rule" is not a violation of one's due process as some students claim, Hunter said "There is wider latitude in private schools than in public schools. Whatever a private S<.'hool does is due process. It may not necessarily be fair, but it is valid. No one has a con~titutional right to drink," he said. 
Hunter expressed skepticism about tht· University's true motives for a dry campus." My opinion is that thb is all a ruse to accomplish by in­direct means what their real inten­tion is to remove alcohol completdy from this campus." 
lluntcr said tht· llniversity's dcsirt· to "legislate a philosophy on drinking hy legislating strict laws is ludil'rous. You can't change at· titudcs." 
"Would passing strict laws lead to a dry campus?," Hunter said. "Factu;tlly, no, bt'l'ausc the rules would lead them off-campus where thl'ir safety would be imperiled."

Hampshire, Hart vov.ed to "win others in the South . . . and else­where." 
But Hart is handicappt·d in the South. 
Few prominent Southerners have t•ndorscd him and he has little or­ganization in Georgia and Alabama. Things rnar he even worse in Florida, where he ha.~ convention dclcgatt·~ running for less than half the available slots. 
"lie's put very little effort into tnc state," said Kathr Kossman, ex­t•ctl!ivc director of the Florida Democratic Party. "But I assume he's going to have some momen­tum . . . there is obviously some excitement hcing generated." 
Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, who 
finished third in New Hampshire, 
pronounced the race open again. 
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, trying to 
build on a No. 4 finish, challenged 
Hart to come to Dixie and fight. 
"He can't stay in New Hampshire,"Jackson said. "He has to come to Super Tuesday. He's not or­ganized down here." 
Hart's New Hampshire victory not onlr alters the race in the South, it turns the Massachusetts primary "from a ho-hum election into a high stakes election," Massachusetts party chairman Chester Atkins said "It's the only place where Hart has an organization and can make a ;trong hit against Mondalc." 
Hunter mentioned several incidents 
where Notre Dame and Saint Mary's 
students were assaulted in the Five 
Points area off-campus. 

lluntt·r said he bdieves the Uni­versity also knows it is putting people into a dangerous situation, "unless they arc naive and believe that students will stop drinking." 
"Ifthe University is worried about drinking and driving, about students killing people, then they should make the campus vehicle free," Hun­ter said. He admitted, however, that the suggestion is "just a possibilty, but just as unlikely as a dry campus.

Nat'l Housing Service improves area residences with student help

Deadline to retract housing contracts moved to April 6 
ByJANE KRA VCIK 
StaffReporter 
Because so many students re­quested on-campus housing next year, the deadline for retracting housing contracts without forfeiture of the 5200 deposit has been ex­tended until rriday, Apri16. 
According to Father Michael Hep­pen, directorofstudent housing, the University ,,"can't accommodate everyone at this time who has sub­mitted a contract." 
This is not the first yt:ar tht: deadline has bet:n t:xtt:nded for this reason. Heppen said,"This is the same memo that'! have sent out for the last five years." 
Heppen said he doesn't think a housing lottery will be neccessary this year. "It depends on the number of people moving off-campus," he 

said. Refusing to comment on the eJi act 
•number of people who will have to move off-campus in order to avoid tht: lottery, Heppen said "The num­bers vary from year to year." He noted, however, that the numbt:r of people who need to move is about the same this year as in other years. 
Heppen said there is absolutely no connection bt:tween the extension of the deadline and the as of yet un· disclosed alcohol policy for next year. 
Heppen would no, comment on the fact that resident assistants being chosen for next year do not know what alcohol policy they will be enforcing. He said, "I have never had any conversations with the alcohol committee. I am not aware of what the thrust ofthetr thinking is."

Graduate student Jphn Kenned)', Jr., is a northwest neighborhood resident who has benlfitted from the work of National Housing Services. After one year in the neighborhood. he owns the duplex he lives in. 
NHS is a locally fundeq and operated organization in its sixth year working to revitalize South Bend neighborhoods. 
"You have to be around to feel it, but the neighborhood's whole sense ofdirection has changed," Kennedy said. 
He is seeing long-time homeowners reinvest in their property through NHS loans and financing programs after years of neglect. Renters also are taking steps toward home ownership and greater responsibility .in the community through NHS, he said. 
Finding adequate funding for neighborhood revitalization is not the greatest challenge facing Nation­al Housing Services, said Kennedy. Good people are the vital ingredient to the NHS program, he said. 
In the northeast as well as the northwest "target areas," Kennedy insists involvement of people who care is the essential factor in bring­ing about_ real change in the com-

munity. The kind of support on which NHS' success depends is per­sonal commitment -from both within and without the neighbor· hood. 
"Where one finds good, dedicated people," Kennedy t said, "money, or the lack of it, is never a primary obstacle." 
Zeroing in on the northeast neigh­borhood -a popular area for off-campus student housing Kennedy stressed the need for stu­dent participation. 
"NHS wants to turn the Notre Dame students living in the north­east section from a negative into a positive force,'' he said. "If they do not get students involved../ln it (NHS), it is not going to work.'' 
The area is by no means complete, he notes, but the direction has been 
· "very positive." Apart from the physical investment and rehabilita­tion of parts of the neighborhood, Kennnedy says there is a much more subtle metamorphosis taking place. 
Kennedy commends the efforts of NHS. He admits it is only a begin­ning, but is hopeful for the future of South Bend's neighborhoods. 
"They are an outstanding or­ganization," he says, "superb."

the Search Committee." 
O'Malley, along with San Diego 
Padres President Ballard Smith, led a 
pro-Kuhn group that had tried to 
keep Kuhn in office. But last August 
in Boston at baseball's summer 
meetings, Kuhn said he would no 
longer remain in contention for a 
third term. 
His job apparently could have been saved had he accepted a diminished role, but he refused, warning until the end that baseball needed a strong commissioner. 
Although the owners still must vote on Ueberroth, the Times said all 26 clubs had agreed in Boston last summer that they would approve any decision made by Selig's com­mittee. 
The Times also said Saturday's meeting in Tampa had been called in secrecy, completing a job the search committee had conducted in secrecy all along. 
Hadden, longtime aide to Kbhn and a specialist in baseball's njles and bylaws, refused to commen) on the report that he would act as com­missioner until Ueberroth was available. 
However, a source said Hadden would "function as an administrator or coordinator on behalf of the Ex­ecutive Council. Until Ueberroth is able to take over, they have to do something."

With a blue-chip point guard al­ready signed to join the team next year, Thompson will have quite a challenge next year for the starting spot. However, DiStanislao is confi­dent about Thompson's ability. 
"Vonnie's a real talent," says the fourth-year coach. "She's quick, fast, strong, and can really shoot the balL She has to learn to bear down and push herself to do the things she has to do to be a complete player -like play better on defense -but she's contributed a great deal to us in her first year." 
While Thompson was making 
great contributions early in the

and, by practicing hard, began to get more and more playing time. She has now become one of the most ef­fective rebounders on the team and has started four times this year. If there has been one good note to this c.therwise bad season, it would have to be Willis' improver11ent over the season. 
"In this year of ups and downs, Lavetta really has worked to be a consistent performer," says DiS­tanislao. "What's been wonderful is that my opinion of her hasn't changed this year. She is a consistent person, a hard worker, and has im­proved steadily." 
"Lavetta may not be the kind of person that catches your eye as a su­perstar, but she's the kind of player who makes the team better. She's a team player, she's smart, she plays good defense, and she's solid in her role around the basket. She's always pushing her limits, and that's impor­tant in any team." 
Her performance off the bench also has been important to the team in recent weeks as she has sparked the team in many wins. She has used her instinct for the ball to grab many rebounds (her average ofabout four per game is third best on the team), but her time on the bench early in the season has allowed her to pick up a lot oflessons. 
"(Sitting on the bench) gave me a chance to look at a lot of things," says the Wayne, Mich., resident. "I was learning a lot of things I needed to know. Still, you really need to play to grow into the game. I figured as long as I worked hard, l would play." 
By next season, Willis and Thompson will have a similar task ­fighting off the challenge of an out­standing recruiting class -and this year's experience should help them. Seasons like the one that is coming to an end are said to build character, and, with three seasons left at Notre Dame, the two still have plenty of time to pick up some ofthe wins that escaped them this year.

Do You Have What It Takes?

Federal judge rules against USFL 
to be 
Associated Pres.!! 

LOS ANGELES -A federal judge has opened the door to under­graduates seeking to play pro foot­ball, and Marcus Dupree apparently will be the frrst to walk through it and into the United States Football League. 
In a ruling made public yesterday, 
U.S. District Court judge Laughlin Waters said the USFL rule against college underclassmen constitutes a "group boycott" in violation of an­titrust law. 
It came out of a suit filed by for­mer Arizona punter Bob Boris, who -;ought to play in the USFL although his class had not graduated. 
He sued in August, six months af. tt·r liSFI. commissioner <hct Sim­mons madt· an exception to the It-ague's ruk in 19H3, its inaugural season, and allowed the New jersey Generals to sign Herst·ht:J Walker. the lleisman laureate from c;eorgia.

At second doubles arc Ghidotti and Najarian. All three doubles reams arc very balanced, and only a slim line separates this duo from rhe lop spot. Nelligan and Doug Pratt hold down the third doubles spot. 
"Wisconsin is a very tough ream with most of their guys back," said llartzcll. "Iowa will also be difficult. But if we play well in the top spots, and our lower matches hold wugh, we could beat all three tt:ams." 
"The goal for the ream is w win 20

Last year, after Dupree had dropped out ofthe University ofOk· lahoma, Simmons often said he would not allow a USFL team to sign him. Dupree later enrolled at South· em Mississippi, but when the NCAA ruled him ineligible for football this year, he dropped out again. 
He is not draft-eligible until 1986. But the USFL also has a territorial draft, and rights to current and for­mer Oklahoma players belong to the Generals. Trade discussions be· tween rhem and the New Orleans Breakers are underway. But Dupree acknowledged yesterday he is a day or two away from officially signing with the Breakers. 
The lEFL rule on underclassmen is similar to one used by the National Football League and the Canadian Football League. 
jay Moyer, counsel to NFL com­missioner Pete Rozelle, said rhe NFL would not change its rule. He srrcssed that Boris could be con­sidered "an exceprion" since he didn't bl·gin college until he was 21. 
The NFL is caught in its own legal 
tangle with tht: Los Angeles Raiders, whom it is trying to force to return to Oakland. The league says it plans to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court a federal appeals court decision upholding the 1982 move of the franchise. 
In his ruling on Boris' case, Waters said any immediate appeal "may materially advance the ultimate ter­mination of the litigation." john L'Estrange, Boris' lawyer, said, "We are going to oppose any attempt to appeal the decision and we are continuing our preparation for the trial in September." 
That trial will determine how much dap1age Boris suffered by his exclusion from the l.SFL last year. 
Boris would have finished his fourth year in college this spring, but left in the fall of 1982 and signed with Professional Sports Manage­mem Inc., forfeiling further college eligibility. 
L'Estrange said the liSFL waived its eligibity rule for Boris last November making him eligible to play chis season. He signed with the Los Angeles Express, was cut and then signed by the Outlaws.
