Professors study academic tracking 
By LIZ HOLTZ 

News Writer 
Academic tracking plays an important role in the way friends in high school influence each other's college aspirations and eventual attendance, according to a nationwide study completed by two Notre Dame faculty members. 
This finding is only one of a series that Maureen Hallinan, a White professor of Arts and Letters in sociology and the principal investigator of the NO study, and Richard Williams, assistant professor of sociology, have conducted regarding friendships. 
Data was collected from more than 20,000 high school students by the National Opinion Research Center in the U.S. Department of Education for the study. 
In the survey, one item students indicated was whether they were in an academic track or a vocational track. Hallinan said, "As expected, there are sharp differences between students in the academic and non-academic tracks with respect to college plans and attendance." 
One interesting finding in the survey was that students have higher aspirations and educational outcomes when they have a best friend in a different track, although the reason for this remains unclear. 
However. different track friends are less in­fluential than same track friends in shaping a

hypocrisy with Court ruling 
It is incredibly 
ironic that the United States, which hails it­self as the champion and promoter of democratic rights throughout the world, finds it reasonable to 

exclude itself from Sandra Wiegand honoring these rights 
in its dealings with Asst. News Editor 
foreign countries. · 
Last week the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment, which guarantees rights against unreasonable search and seizure, does not apply in foreign countries. American law-enforcement agencies will not be required to have a search warrant before searching private property in foreign coun­tries. In altering the amendment, the Supreme court has demonstrated once again that U.S. "ideology" can be disposed of when circumstances make it convenient. 
American politicians are fond of talking about the country's commitment to human rights, as if there were a moral basis for 
U.S. foreign policy which is geared toward the goal of universal freedom. But our ac­tions show that the real goal is more power (or sustained power) for the United States, regardless of whether we abide by our own ethics to attain it. 
The implications are great. We lose our credibility with other countries since our rhetoric and our actions are in direct con­flict. It is striking enough that the U.S. should feel it is qualified to make such a de­cision on its own, rather than through an international court or assembly. The Supreme Court addressed only the right of the U.S. to disregard the amendment; if an­other country did the same, we would cer­tainly call it a criminal action. The ruling implies that the U.S. considers itself on a higher plane than other countries, a plane where laws are unnecessary. 
The idea involves circular logic. We are disregarding the Fourth Amendment be­cause we think it will help us enforce the law. We want to cure all the evils in the world because we are morally superior to them, but because we are morally superior, we can disregard our own moral standards in order to impose justice. Regardless of how much we want to convict Manuel Nor­iega, the situation should not be such that we can send troops to a foreign country to extract a criminal by means that are illegal in our own country, then take him to this country for a "fair trial" by our legal sys­tem. The contradiction trivializes the Amer­ican judicial system, as well as our demo­cratic ideals. 

Checks and balances are very important to our law system, and we cannot assume that our law enforcement agencies will be infallible in deciding in what situations it would be responsible to conduct searches on foreign land. A search warrant is a check which helps ensure that our military does not have too much individual power in foreign countries.

Mikhail Gorbachev said sun­day that the breakup of the Soviet Union could be more devastating to his country than the ruinous Cultural Revolution that wracked China for 10 years. When asked by reporters if he could put up with the BaltiC republics declaring independence, Gorbachev 

said that trying to disentangle the na­tionalities of the Soviet Union after decades of living together would lead to trouble comparable to the upheaval in China that started in 1966.

The government of Jammu-Kashmir state in India offered Sunday to hold elections within six months in a bid to halt a Moslem uprising, and security forces launched new raids on suspected militant hideouts. Moslem militants boycotted November's national parlia­mentary elections and forced residents in Kashmir -part of Jammu-Kashmir state -to stay away from the polls. But Jagmohan, the top administrator of the state, said he had information that various militant groups were con­sidering giving up their arms and adopting the demo­cratic process to power. 
Nicaraguan rebels said Sunday they have taken steps toward demobilization and that President-elect Vio­leta de Chamorro should replace the Sandinista army with a civilian police force. The U.S.-supported Contra rebels said in a statement that they are in contact with leaders of the United National Opposition coalition, which upset the leftist Sandinistas in Nicaragua's Feb. 25 elections.

A rare medieval instruction for young pastors has been donated to Notre Dame's Hes­burgh Library by Astrik Gabriel, professor and director emeritus in the University's Medieval In­stitute. 
The book,"Manipulus Curatorum," published in 1493, was written by a Spanish curate, Guido de Monte Rochen, for the benefit of young pastors and includes treatises on the seven Sacraments and on articles of faith. 
This is the only copy of the book in an American collegiate library. The book joins the Library's collection of nearly 80 incunabula (books printed before 1501).

Andy Rooney returns to '60 Minutes' after suspension 
NEW YORK lAP) -Andy 
Hooney returned Sunday to "60 
Minutes" after a three-week 
suspension, saying he was wor­
ried he'd be wrongly remem­
bered as a racist for remarks 
he says he didn't make. 
Hooney was suspended by CBS without pay Feb. 8 but re­instated three weeks later. 
Back at his usual show-end­ing slot, Hooney said it was demeaning to defend himself because he had a long history of supporting civil rights. He said he didn't know how to apologize to homosexuals for a comment he made last year that he hadn't realized would be offensive. 
Staying at home made him worry about his legacy, he said. 
''I'd be known for the rest of my life as a racist bigot and as someone who had made life a little more difficult for homo­sexuals. I felt terrible and I've learned a lot," the 71-year-old Hooney said. 
"What do I say to defend my­self? Do I say, 'I'm not a racist.' That sounds like saying, 'I'm not a crook.'

"How do I apologize to ho­

with a remark I made that I 
didn't realize would hurt 
them?" 

Hooney began his commen­
tary by reciting a portion of a 
poem he remembered from high 
school in which the writer la­
ments the loss of his true love. 
Not working for three weeks 
since his suspension, he said, 
was like losing his true love. 
In his typical biting style, he reiterated that he has opinions that will continue to upset some people. "That's what I'm here for," he said, while also ques­tioning why he had become em­broiled in controversy. 
"In 1970, I wrote the show called 'Harry and Lena' for Harry Belafonte and Lena Horne. I like Lena better than Harry. Does that make me a feminist?" 
CBS News president David Burke suspended Hooney after The Advocate, a gay magazine, quoted him as saying that blacks had "watered down their genes" because the least intelligent among them had the most children. 

Friends

"This finding underscores the critical nature of track place­ment in secondary schools. Tracking leads to within-track friendships, and if students are incorrectly placed, the influence of their friends may result in their making inappropriate educational choices," said Hal­linan. 
The study found no evidence of a gender effect on the peer influence process. Hallinan said, "The difference between the influences of females and males is negligible and different sex friends are about as influ­ential as same-sex friends." 
However. the research reveals interesting differences in influ­ence by race. "Counter to

"But once formed, cross-race

Hallinan and Williams' analy­
sis of the National Opinion He­

T. Parsons theory of influence, which was expressed in a 1963 paper in Public Opinion. 
"Since friends, and especially close friends are perceived as trustworthy, a student is likely to believe their advice about the advantages or disadvantages of college," said Hallinan. "And the influence is likely to persist over a student's .secondary school career if the friendship tie continues."

Noriega is awaiting trial on drug charges in Miami, where he was taken after gaining refuge in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City days after U.S. invasion. He later surrendered to U.S. authorities. 
Two officers who were allied with Noriega have taken refuge in the Peruvian Embassy, and demonstrators Saturday hurled firebombs at the embassy in protest. 
There were no injuries or se­rious damage in the incident. 
U.S. soldiers and Panamanian police restored order. 
The protest was organized by widows of Panamanian soldiers slain in an Oct. 3 attempt to topple Noriega. They arc an­gered that Gonzalo Gonzalez and Heraclides Sucre, who are accused of killing coup leader Maj. Moises Giroldi, have been given refuge. 
Protesters also said they were concerned that the Panamanian government guaranteed safe passage out of the country to Noriega's family and several other Noriega associates. 
Giroldi's widow Adela said she did not know who threw the firebombs. 
"It was peaceful and the inci­dents were provoked by un­known pnople," she said.

Engineering seminar aids students 
By OLIVIA PORTER 
News Writer 
The Society of Women Engineers sponsored an infor­mational workshop for stu­dents interested in a career in engineering. 
The Saturday seminar con­sisted of three sets of 45 minute seminars that presented speakers from major corpora­tions such as Bendix, Amoco, and Arthur Anderson. The sub­jects discussed ranged from ef­fective job hunting to careers in mechanical engineering. 
Although many of the partici­pants were engineering majors, the workshop provided the stu­dents with optional career paths. A representative from Arthur Anderson discussed the possibility of using an engineer­ing degree to enter the consult­ing field. 
The issue of personal sacri­fices was addressed by a repre­sentative from the Amoco Oil Company who discussed ways to combine a successful career and a family. 
Despite the fact that the event was sponsored by the Society of Women Engineers, Christina Mueller, assistant chairperson, said that the workshop "was not just for women, but for anyone who wanted an insight of the various engineering fields."

Japanese/U.S. talks end friendly 
TOKYO (AP) Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu left be­hind friendly talks with President Bush and returned home Sunday to political reali­ties likely to dampen any post­summit euphoria. 
Japanese officials accompa­nying Kaifu said the summit in Palm Springs, Calif. could for­tify Kaifu's position as he tries to carry out pledges of eco­nomic reform. 
After his warm welcome in California, however, Kaifu faces a decidedly cooler reac­tion in Tokyo, where there is opposition to trade-related economic reform both in his Liberal Democratic Party and in the opposition-controlled upper house of Parliament. 
The summit, hastily arranged only a week in advance, had been widely expected to put Kaifu in the unenviable position of having to fend off criticism that Japan is dragging its feet in cutting its $49 billion trade surplus with the United States. 
But during their talks Friday and Saturday, Kaifu and Bush avoided detailed discussion of specific trade topics under ne­gotiation. 
Kaifu responded to Bush's request for substantive progress on both the Structural Impediments Initiative -talks aimed at attacking the trade imbalance indirectly through economic reform --and in other disputed trade areas with a pledge to "Do my best." 
"I told the president I am asking for cooperation and un­derstanding from my people, from businesses," and from in­volved government agencies, Kaifu told reporters in the United States. 
Among all three groups, Kaifu faces stubborn resistance to change and a tradition of cautious, slow decision-making that will hinder efforts to meet deadlines for progress on trade issues.

Efforts to arrest Philippine official result in 14 deaths 
Proposals include streamlin­ing Japan's byzantine distribu­tion system with its many mid­dlemen, hastening the opening of price-competitive large stores, and strictly enforcing anti-monopoly laws. 
Land-use reforms aimed at increasing space for much­needed housing and at cutting exorbitant land prices could eventually hit the real estate values underpinning much of Japan's enormous financial wealth. 
"The road is not smooth. We are dealing with things both societies have tried to rectify for decades," acknowledged Yukio Okamoto, director of the First North American Division of the Foreign Ministry. 
Many Japanese government and business leaders said Sunday they were happy with the results of the summit, and vowed to work hard to settle economic conflicts with the United States. 

MANILA, Philippines (AP) ­Officials tried Sunday to arrest a governor indicted in a recent coup attempt, but his support­ers defended him in clashes that left at least 14 people dead, including a general, au­thorities said. 
The trouble began early Sunday when officials sent to arrest Gov. Rodolfo Aguinaldo in the city of Tuguegarao were taken hostage in a hotel. Later, government forces stormed the hotel, leading to a series of clashes later in the day in the city. At least 10 people were re­ported wounded. 
Aguinaldo, a former lieu­tenant colonel, escaped, but of­ficials said Sunday about 200 of his followers had surren­dered. 
The military chief of staff, Gen. Renato de Villa, placed the armed forces on nationwide alert and ordered the military to capture Aguinaldo "at all costs." 
Scattered shooting was still reported /late Sunday in Tuguegarao, capital of Cagayan province 250 miles north of Manila. 
Col. Emiliano Templo told re­porters Aguinaldo's followers were believed to be holding some people hostage in homes near the hotel. 
However, Acting Gov. Melvin Vargas said 10 more Aguinaldo followers surrendered early Monday and released about 30 hostages they were holding at a pawn shop. It was unclear if other hostages were still being held. 
Troops blocked a major bridge south of Tuguegarao, stranding thousands of travel­ers. Templo said Aguinaldo's followers included his private army, government militiamen and army Scout Rangers. 
Marines were flown from Manila on Sunday to reinforce security in Tuguegarao, a city of more than 80,000 people. Philippine Airlines canceled flights to the city and schools were ordered closed Monday.

Local Governments Secretary 

Luis Santos and Brig. Gen. 
Oscar Florendo had gone to 
Tuguegarao to serve Aguinaldo 
with the arrest warrant. 
Before dawn, Aguinaldo's supporters surrounded the six­story Delfino Hotel and took Florendo, chief of the military's civil relations service, and three aides prisoner and trapped Santos and others on the sec­ond floor. 
About 3 p.m., government forces launched an attack. Florendo, 51, was wounded during the rescue and was dead on arrival at a city hospital, said defense spokeswoman Lourdes Ilustre. 
Santos, two mayors, two colonels and a navy commodore were rescued unharmed, offi­cials said. 
Casualty figures were incom­plete, but regional commander Col. Miguel Fontanilla said at least 14 people died. 
They included 10 killed during a clash at a checkpoint near a bridge, three in fighting near a gasoline station and Florendo at the hotel, he said. 
President Corazon Aquino said Florendo "was killed by one of the followers of sus­pended Gov. Rodolfo Aguinaldo . . . . The act of cowardice and treachery of Aguinaldo's fol­lowers will not go unpunished. 
"I call on all our people to continue to reject violence and uphold our constitutional democracy and the processes of law in a peaceful manner." 
In a radio interview at the hotel earlier Sunday, Aguinaldo said he was a "victim of injus­tice .... I don't mind dying as a villain." He threatened to take 
his followers into the moun­tains and become "a rebel." 
Aguinaldo was suspended in January as governor of Cagayan province for allegedly supporting the Dec. 1-9 mili­tary rebellion and had been holed up in his hometown of Gattaran, 45 miles north of Tuguegarao. 
Aquinaldo told a Manila radio station on Dec. 1 that he was sending tanks and artillery to the city to support mutineers trying to oust Mrs. Aquino. 
The governor was indicted· along with Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile and five others in con­nection with the coup attempt, the sixth and bloodiest attempt to topple Mrs. Aquino since she took power in 1986.

Residents protest Daley's airport 
CHICAGO (AP) -Windows of 
bungalows lining the streets of 
the city's industrial Southeast 
Side are starting to sport new 
signs -an airplane stamped 
with a red circle and a slash. 
The message: No airport. 
Mayor Richard Daley's plan 
to build a third metropolitan 
airport near the Indiana line 
has sparked heated debate 
among politicians in two states 
and across the neighborhoods 
that would be bulldozed and 
replaced with runways. 
Daley announced the $4.9 bil­
lion project two weeks ago, 
saying it represents jobs and an 
investment that would help re­
vitalize the area, site of shut­
tered steel mills and toxic 
dumps. 
But Indiana officials are fighting for a share of any new airport that might be built to alleviate congestion at Chicago's O'Hare International, the world's busiest. A bi-state committee already had been considering four possible sites. none in Chicago. 
And even in Hegewisch, a mixed industrial and residential neighborhood Daley's Lake Calumet Airport would dis­place, there is no consensus. 
"Why should we have to leave? Why should somebody tell us where to live?" home­owner Janet Chibicki said last week. 
But contractor James Amen­dola, a resident for 26 years, says there are any number of reasons to bulldoze Hegewisch for an airport. 
"I think it'd be really good for the area considering we got dumps on one side killing us. The water's contaminated. What have we got left? All's we

got left is people who got 
pride," he said. 

On one street. a block of 
white frame houses dead-ends 
with a view of a flaming 
smokestack at the LTV Steel 
yard. At the William W. Powers 
State Fish and Wildlife Area, 
picnic tables overlook oil tanks 
on the opposite shore of Wolf 
Lake. 

Under the mayor's proposal, 
5,510 to 9,360 homes would be 
replaced by runways in 
Chicago's Hegewisch and South 
Deering neighborhoods and in 
suburban Burnham and 
Calumet City. 

"It took everything we have to get this house, now they're going to take it away from us," said Mrs. Chibicki. She and her husband, Gary, saved 10 years before buying it for $64,000 in 1988, and she does not think they'll get a fair price for it. 
"I don't think anybody, even the powerful mayor of the city of Chicago, has the right to lit­erally destroy neighborhoods, when you have options 20 miles south or east of us," said Calumet City Mayor Robert Ste­faniak. 
No option has won federal support and even if Lake Calumet Airport i'S built, it would not open for about 20 years. 
The airport would cover 9,400 acres. compared with O'Hare's 7,700 acres. The city intends to pay for it with bonds, federal grants and ei­ther a $2.25 tax on travelers at O'Hare and Midway Airport on the Southwest Side, or state and local taxes. 
The city estimates the airport would create more than 200,000 permanent jobs and each year would inject $13.7 billion into the regional econ­omy. 
The city has pledged to reim­burse homeowners at fair­market value and to pay moving expenses and a relocation allowance, said Marj Halperin, Daley's deputy press secretary. 
Daley's announcement also spawned a political fight, be­cause it pre-empts the Illinois­Indiana committee that already had chosen four finalist airport sites, two in Indiana and two south of Chicago. 
Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., has enlisted the aid of fellow Republicans, including Senate 
Minority Leader Bob Dole, to fight Daley's plan. 
"The mayor's plan is clearly unfair to Indiana, which has played by the rules from the beginning in the selection pro­cess for that new airport," Coats said. 
He is trying to block $5.2 million the city requested from the Federal Aviation Adminis­tration to produce a master plan for the airport. 
Rep. Pete Visclosky, D-Ind., has accused U.S. Transporta­tion Secretary Samuel Skinner, former chairman of the Re­gional Transportation Author­ity of Northern Illinois, of fa­voring the city. 
"All I've agreed to do is not eliminate any choices," Skinner said last week after meeting with Coats and Dole.

Children barred from school because of custody dispute 
EVANSVILLE. Ind. (AP) -A tangle of residency and child custody laws keeps 11-year-old Nakiatra Collier and her 16­year-old brother, Antoine, at home watching television in­stead of going to school. 
The sister and brother from Detroit were barred from at­tending school in Evansville for the second semester on Jan. 2 when custody or guardianship was not granted to their aunt, Linda Collier. 
Nakiatra spent the fall semester at Thompkins School and Antoine attended Central High School 
Nakiatra and Antoine say they have been living in Evansville with Collier since August because their mother, who lives in Detroit, is unable to care for them. 
"Once the court made its de­cision (not to grant custody), .we were not able to keep the children in school," said Jim Trader, supervisor of student services for the Evansville­Vanderburgh School Corp. "If there is not a guardian or no one has legal custody of them, then we have no one to corre­spond with." 
Evansville school officials said the residency requirements are designed to keep students from switching to school dis­tricts where they don't have le­gal guardians. 
Collier said she does not want to send Nakiatra and Antoine back to Detroit because they were not cared for properly and were not attending school because of conditions in the Detroit school system. She said she is a sister to the children's mother, Violet Collier, who is a single parent. Attempts to con­tact Violet Collier wnre unsuc­cessful.

seared. They are here, and they are going to stay here," Collier told The Evansville Courier in a copyright story in Sunday's edi­tions. 
"At one time they thought they were going to be sent back to Detroit, and they eried like babies. This whole process is confusing to them," she said. 
It is confusing to adults, as well. Trader said that if stu­dents could enroll without guardians, the system would be flooded with people from other districts. 
"It is a very common prob­lem, and we have to keep stu­dents in the district where their guardian lives," Trader said. "Technically, the children are still Michigan residents, be­cause they have legal parents in that state." 
But Indiana Department of Education officials disagree with Trader's decision. State officials say Indiana's compul­sory attendance law requires students under age 18 who have been in the state for more than 30 days to attend school. It is a Class B misdemeanor to keep them out. 
"They should be in school," said Risa Regnier, an attorney for the state. "(If) it appears that a relative is providing a home for them, and is caring for them, then they are entitled to go to school." 
Vanderburgh County Juvenile Court Judge Robert Lensing, who has handled the case, said he has no jurisdiction to order the children back to Michigan. 
"We do not have the respon­sibility to take children from other counties," Lensing said. "They are supposed to go back to their mother or father. Many times children are sent here be­cause the parent doesn't want to be bothered." 



Claybrook is banking on the story of Charles Keating's Lin­coln Savings and Loan to per­suade voters to demand changes in the way congres­sional elections are financed. 
Public Citizen, the organiza­tion Claybrook leads, is among a number of self-styled public interest groups pushing Congress to accept public fi­nancing of the campaigns, with spending limits and significant restrictions on political action committee donations. 
A new poll conducted for Pub­lic Citizen shows a clear major­ity of the public, 58 percent, supports the concept of public financing -the highest level since just after the Watergate scandal. 
But the poll also found most voters know very little about the mechanics of public financ­ing and are skeptical that any financing system would remove the influence of political action committees formed by special 

That is where Claybrook hopes the story of Keating and the widespread problems in the savings and loan industry will help. 
The collapse of Keating's Lin­coln Savings and Loan will cost taxpayers $2 billion. And Clay­brook estimates that the $150 billion federal bailout of the S&L industry overall is costing each taxpayer about $1,000. 
The poll found overwhelming anger among voters who were told about five senators who in­tervened on Keating's behalf with federal regulators who were considering seizing Lin­coln because of questionable lending and investments. 
Keating and associates previ­ously had donated $600,000 to the campaigns of causes of the five senators. 
That anger, according to the pollsters, could provide Public Citizen and its allies with the opening they have always needed to persuade the public system should be overhauled. 
"The scandals surrounding the savings and loan industry, in particular, have created a political moment where voters are able to make the concep­tual link between campaign money and their own interests and quality of representation," the analysis from the pollsters said. 
The pollsters cautioned, how­ever, that while people are un­happy with the current cam-. paign finance system and in­creasingly skeptical of Congress, they will be difficult to mobilize. 
"The public, though increas­ingly unhappy with the current system, examines the issue through its larger political lenses, which do not focus easily on campaign finance as a political issue," the analysis said.

Debt excesses unravel, 
Henry Kaufman is an old-fashioned economist, but suddenly that begins to sound like a compliment. For 26 years as a leading official at Salomon Broth­ers, he warned with ever-increasing fer­vor against the national tendency to put everything on the cuff -even as Wall Street itself became a principal ex­ploiter of the pervasive mania for debt. 
Now, on his own for the past two years as head of the New York consult­ing and money-management firm that bears his name, Kaufman has what might seem the satisfaction of watching many deserving firms get their comeup­pance. Not only has the junk-bond em­pire of Drexel Burnham Lambert col­lapsed, but others such as Integrated Resources, Bank of New England, Cam­peau and countless S&Ls also have lost prominence. 
But Kaufman, characteristically, is neither gloating nor melodramatic. He is convinced that what he calls "the fi­nancial recklessness of the past decade" will result in tighter rules and dimin­ished influence for once-arrogant Wall Street firms, and he fears that this will lead to a less efficient allocation of capital generally. 
But he is not joining the frightening chorus that says these unraveling fi-

nancial excesses must inevitably lead to crash and depression for the American economy. 
When I asked him directly whether such a dire outcome was now unavoid­able, Kaufman gave a surprisingly up­beat response. He said he believed the odds were against either a crash or de­pression, or even decade-long "malaise," and that the 1990s could turn out reasonably well for the Ameri­can economy. But there would be some painful transitions along the way. 
"The problem in the financial system really is one of fragility," he told me, "and the difficulty is to determine what that fragility is. We have a series of fi­nancial institutions, particularly thrift institutions, that are in difficulty. That may be a cost of $300 billion to the American public. 
"We have other financial institutions 
significantly leveraged, with a consider­able amount of commercial properties which are not what they used to be. And 
economic progress to follow 
of course we have corporations very heavily indebted. Now, put that all to­gether, there is a serious restraint on the American economy that just can't be qualified." 
Despite such limits, Kaufman believes this "restraint" should stop well short of catastrophe. "It, however, will take considerable time to undo what was done over a decade or two," he said. "And this is one of the great difficulties here, to be able to absorb this pain. I suspect that it won't lead to a crash or a depression -that our government, the Federal Reserve, is going to be competent enough to put out the fires wherever they may be. 
"But nevertheless this is going to make some of our institutions invalid; they're going to be convalescent rather than being vibrant as lenders, and therefore will be an impediment to the economy and to our international com­petitive position:" 
In general, then, this is not the best outlook for a nation that long believed it could borrow trouble without ever paying the price. Yet, when I specifically asked Kaufman whether he foresaw, like Jimmy Carter, a decade of

focus. Congressional leaders have promised to bring campaign fi­nance legislation to the floor this spring. But no bipartisan agreement is in sight and both Democrats and Republicans bickering among themselves. Lobbyists for Public Citizen, Common Cause and other groups are increasingly skepti­cal that their proposals will be enacted. 
The groups are hoping that a groundswell of public support will improve their chances, and the Public Citizen poll contained evidence to convince them that a well orchestrated campaign could attract supporters. 
Most encouraging to the groups was poll data showing that 58 pl'\rcent of respondents favor the concept of public fi­nancing, the highest level of support since immediately after the Watergate scandal. 
Surplus in Social Security forces budget changes 
WASHINGTON (AP) Congress and the White House are all but certain to make changes this year in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduc­tion law, which has dominated debate over the federal budget since its enactment in 1985. 
If the revisions are major, it would be the second time in its short life that the legislation ­designed to gradually force a balanced budget -has been substantially altered. 
The changes will at the very least be forced by an issue that lawmakers have been fixated on in recent weeks: the gigantic surpluses accumulated each year by the Social Security trust fund. 
But with Gramm-Rudman's declining annual deficit targets scheduled to expire in fiscal 1993, when the budget is sup­posed to be balanced, there are other cross-currents as well. 
"malaise" for the American economy, he replied with a flat "no," adding: 
"I think the 1990s could be a reason­able one for the United States. The United States is moving from a position of superpower to a position of major power, where it's first among the major powers -partly because there is a de­militarization going on in the world. And as a result of that, we have the op­portunity to re-gear our fiscal policy very dramatically. 
"We can now pay attention a lot more to our infrastructure and to our domes­tic needs. And it was that buildup in military expenditures in the 1980s that contributed to some of the excesses in the economy. So, from my perspective, we are in the stage of undoing excesses -and we're beginning to be on the road back." 
A period of overdue transition, fol­lowed by renewed forward progress. This from the man often dubbed the Cassandra of Wall Street, " Dr. Doom." Henry Kaufman, who so unfashionably decried the explosive buildup of debt that was enriching so many of his Wall Street (and Main Street) colleagues, could be right twice.

The price of gas<>line rose ftom $2.15 a gallon to $2.93 a gallon. ihe prices for diesel fuel, kerosene, alcohol

The increase was the sixth since January, and happened 15 da.ys after a 48 percent price hike. Fuel prices have risen 281 percent this year. 
Conservatives want to extend the deficit targets into later years to hold down spending for domestic programs. Liber­als want to eliminate the tar­gets soon so that social spend­ing can expand, and they want to have the Pentagon budget and taxes play a greater role in cutting the deficit. 
"There are about 100 ideas in this place about how the pro­cess will be changed," says Se­nate Budget Committee Chair­man James Sasser, D-Tenn. 
The driving force for the changes is the ever-growing Social Security surplus, ex­pected to be $7 4 billion next year alone.

Gathers dies after collapsing at game 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -Hank Gathers, one of only two Divi­sion I players to lead the nation in scoring and rebounding in the same season, died Sunday night after collapsing during Loyola Marymount's West Coast Conference tournament game against Portland. He was 23. 
Gathers was pronounced dead at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital, where he was taken after collapsing with 13:34 left in the first half of the game. He died at 6:55 p.m. PST, a school spokesman said. 
As a junior last season, Gath­ers averaged 32.7 points and 
13.7 rebounds, joining Xavier McDaniel of Wichita State in 1984-85 as the only NCAA player to lead the nation in both categories. 

A 6-foot-7, 210-pound center from Philadelphia, Gathers was forecast as a first-round selec­tion in this year's NBA draft. He passed up the draft follow­ing his junior season. 
It was the second time this season that Gathers has col­lapsed on his home court dur­ing a game. 
On Dec. 9 against UC Santa Barbara, Gathers went to the foul line with 13:56 left in the second half, missed his first free throw, stepped away from the foul line and went down. He underwent several days of tests in a local hospital and returned after missing two games. 
Gathers passed those tests and began taking medication to regulate his heartbeat. Doctors suspected that an accelerated heartbeat may have led to the fainting spell on that occasion. 
Gathers convinced the doc­tors to cut back on his medica­tion, after which he felt his body strength improving. He turned the corner in the first 
week  in  February  when  he  
scored  44 points against  St.  
Mary's.  

After Gathers collapsed, a de­cision to postpone the tourna­ment was made by Conference Commissioner Mike Gilleran. 
Athletic Director Brian Quinn said that three physicians were worked on Gathers while he was placed into the ambulance and taken to the hospital. 
Gilleran, in his sixth season as wee commissioner, stated that there will be no conference games played Monday. 
Ferry may return to U.S. to play 
MILAN, Italy (AP) -Former Duke All-American Danny Ferry may join his teammate Brian Shaw in returning to the United States after a less-than­impressive season in the Italian basketball league, a sports newspaper reported Sunday. 
Gazzetta dello Sport of Milan, Italy's largest sports daily, said Ferry's poor performance in Italy could have sealed his decision to leave Rome and sign with the Cleveland Cavaliers, who hold his NBA draft rights. Ferry signed last year with Messaggero Roma for an Italian record $1.5 million. 

"Rome is losing Ferry," read the paper's banner headline. 
Shaw. signed by the Roman team along with Ferry last summer, has decided to rejoin the Boston Celtics at the end of the season. 
Messaggero, eighth in the regular season standings, is fighting for a berth in the Italian league playoffs in May. 
Messaggero. officials and Ferry could not be reached for comment on Sunday. 
The article quoted coach Valerio Bianchini as saying that Ferry, 23, had an extremely ex­hausting start in the Italian league "and is now taking a breather -he's going through a period of low energy." 
Gazzetta also reported that Messaggero already was nego­tia_yng for a replacement.

185-pound championship, won by Ricky Purcell when the ref­eree stopped his contest with Robert Urban late in the second round. Urban had scored well against Purcell, drawing blood from the defending champ's nose early in the second round. Two right uppercuts by Pur­cell then felled his opponent, and although Urban com­plained later, the officials stopped the fight. McCormick said that the referees made the 
right call.  .,  
"There's around,  not amateur  a or  fighter profes­ 

sional, who doesn't think he can continue. In amateur box­ing, if somebody gets hurt, the fight's over," said McCormick. 
There were many other fine matches. Brian Stokes won a split decision over Timothy Phelan in a .tightly contested 127-pound fight. Erik Milito used a strong right hook to score a split decision win over Mick Meyer at 138 pounds, And powerful Kurt Lauber outmus­cled Shane Hitzeman to win the 150-pound championship. 
Referee Terry Johnson was honored for his service to the Bengal Bouts in a ceremony be­fore the final bout of the night, as was founder Dominic Napolitano's widow, "Schatze"

Napolitano. Mrs. Napolitano received the prestigious Bengal Bout Award. given annually to the person who best represents the spirit of the Bengal Bouts. 
Jody Armetta, who. had al­ready shown his spirit in de­feating heavy favorite David Cane in the semifinals, earned his first title by winning a split decision over Colin Mullaney at 154 pounds. Defending champ Vance Becklund fought off a stubborn John Sordi en route to a unanimous decision at 158 pounds. 
Kerry Wate showed his strength in a 160-pound battle when he forced the referee to stop his contest with Chuck Moser at the 1:12 mark of the third round, and Jim Hawkins used his reach advantage on Norm Conley to score a unani­mous decision at 162 pounds. 
Kevin Max won a split deci­sion after a wild battle with Patrick Fay at 174 pounds, and Mike Ryan protected himself in earning the 180-pound title, using his jab and staying out of reach of the more powerful Chris Kiley as the Bengal Bouts were a rousing success once again. 
"It was a great tournament, we had a little bit of every­thing," said McCormick. "This was a first class boxing exhibi­tion, and everybody put on a great performance. When the University decides to do some­thing like this, they do it right." 

Report says Maryland 'blown away' by NCAA 
nounce the penalties at a news conference within a few days. 
David Berst, assistant execu­tive director for enforcement of the NCAA, said Saturday that he would defer all comment re­garding an announcement to university officials but would speak about the penalties once they were announced. 
According to the Sun's sources, there are a number of reasons why the program was hit hard. 
One source said the main rea­son was that the NCAA believed the university showed a lack of institutional control from the time it hired former coach Bob Wade without the benefit of a proper search, through the 18 violations committed during Wade's three seasons. 
Among the more serious vio­lations against Wade were pro­viding a leased car, cash pay­ments of $272 and rides for former Terrapins guard Rudy Archer before, during and after his one-season stay; giving free and discounted clothing to Alonzo Mourning and Brian Williams while they were being recruited; providing false and misleading information to NCAA investigators, and trying to get his assistant coaches to provide false and misleading information. 
Wade also was unavailable for comment. 
COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP)­The University of Maryland will be banned from postseason play this year and in 1991 un­der NCAA sanctions against the men's basketball program, a published report said Sunday. 
"We got blown away," an unidentified source told The Sun of Baltimore. The univer­sity apparently had expected only to be banned from post­season play this year. 
In addition, NCAA sanctions also include a ban from televi­sion next season, and the uni­versity also will likely have to return $479,000 for reaching the second round of the NCAA tournament in 1988, the Sun said. 
Other sanctions probably will include a reduction in scholar­ships and limitation on off­campus recruiting visits, the paper said. 
Under Coach Gary Williams, the Terrapins finished their regular season at 18-12 after Saturday's 89-74 victory over Virginia. An NCAA ban would not necessarily keep the Ter­rapins out of the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament. 
Neither Williams nor athletic director Lew Perkins were available for comment. Univer­sity president William E. Kir­wan has declined to comment on the matter, but the Sun said Kirwan was expected to an­

The Tigers hit their first four shots from the field. then went 8-for-26 the rest of the way to finish the half shooting 40 per­cent. Missouri shot 45 percent for the game. The Irish shot 61 percent for the game, led by Singleton, who hit all four of his shots, mostly fast break lay-ups, and Williams, who was 6-of-8. "Coach put me on the bench," Williams said. "And I knew when I got in that I had to con­tribute fast, while I got the chance. I knew we could beat them, but not as bad as we did." In the second half, Phelps again stuck with the lineup that was working. "I got the five guys who would say 'let's play together and get it done,'" Phelps said.

away again. We just were not going to lose." 
"Notre Dame was outstand­ing," said Missouri head coach Norm Stewart, whose team is now i6-4. "They were tremen­dous from the start. We've come through a tough confer­ence schedule, and we sched­uled this game for a reason. We wanted a chance to prepare for the NCAAs." 
Stewart started a different five in the second half. The sec­ond five lost four points to the Irish before the original starters were brought in. 
"Everyone deserves a chance to lose," Stewart said. "We weren't getting too much per­formance. In the second half, we played aggressively, but we couldn't score. There wasn't much hope at that point." 
Hope, and wins over Syracuse and Missouri, are what the Irish are living on in terms of post-season play. After consec­utive losses to DePaul, Georgia Tech and Dayton, the Irish needed Saturday's win to have a shot at impressing the NCAA Tournament selection commit­tee. 
"We've played every type of situation," Phelps said. "We've played 15 road games. We've played three Top 10 teams three weeks in a row, and won two of three. I think if you look at the power rating of our schedule, we'll be in the top 30 teams in the country."

team decided it didn't want to be the first in six years to be denied an invitation to the big dance. 
"It was getting to the point where if we lost, we were going to the NIT," senior co-captain Joe Fredrick said. "There's no use playing for 65th place in the country." 
In order to play for the top spot, the Irish need to keep that momentum going tonight against Kentucky and than again Saturday at De Paul. Those games will be the real test. 
For now, Denver has become secondary to just making the tourney. Make the tourney and everything else will fall into place. 
And this Notre Dame team is one that could make some noise in the post-season. Just ask Missouri, the number-one club in the nation until a loss to Oklahoma last Sunday. 
The Irish have proven they can play with anybody against Syracuse, De Paul and Georgia Tech. They took the final step ... in showing they can hold a lead against Missouri. 
This is a team that has experienced a lot of growing pains. They grew a foot on Saturday. 
The players say this team is still growing. How far could it grow in the NCAA Tournament? "As far as we want," Ellis said. 
Missouri might answer that 
Notre Dame could become a 
giant instead of a giant-killer.

on Sunday. 
Assess John Thompson the 

blame for Stephen Thompson's 
being in position to score it. 
The Georgetown coach was thrown out of a game for the first time in 15 years in the first half of the game at the Carrier Dome, an ejection that carried three technical fouls with it. That contributed di­rectly to 10 Syracuse points that helped erase a 10-point first-half deficit. 
"Basically what happened is that it's probably my fault more than the officials' fault," said Thompson, who was called for three technicals in succes­sion by three different officials after protesting a foul called on Dwayne Bryant. 
"I probably let my competitive juices flow and those of us who have competed understand that. I made a mistake and that's that." 
Overall, seventh-ranked Ge­orgetown (22-5. 11-5 in the Big East) lost the game as much as Syracuse won it, although it gave the Orangemen a tie for Connecticut for the confer­ence's regular season title at 12-4. No. 10 Syracuse is also 22-5 overall. 
On Saturday, Cornelius Holden of No. 21 Louisville set an NCAA Division I record when he shot 14 of 14 in a 73­71 win over Mississippi State. 
No. 2 Nevada-Las Vegas earned a share of the Big West regular-season championship by trouncing Fullerton State 103-85 but surrendered the top

gave ninth-ranked Purdue its victory and kept the Boilermak­ers (21-6, 13-4) a half game behind Michigan State. They meet the Spartans in the regu­lar-season finale next Sunday. North Carolina 87, No.5 Duke 75 
King Rice scored 20 points to lead five players in double fig­ures, and North Carolina spoiled Duke's hopes for a share of first place ACC and give Clemson the regular-sea­son title at 10-4. The Blue Dev­ils finished 23-7, 9-5. No. 18 Illinois 118, Iowa 85

The triumph improved Illinois to 20-7, 10-7 in the Big Ten. Iowa fell to 12-15 and 4-13. 
No. 21 Louisville 73, 
S. Mississippi 71 

Holden, a 6-7 sophomore, also was 4-of-4 from the foul line as the Cardinals came back from a 42-36 halftime deficit. He was fouled by Clarence Weatherspoon and made two free throws with eight seconds left to win the game, then clinched it with a steal.

Rollercoaster Irish trounce Missouri 98-67 

By THERESA KELLY 
Sports Editor 

The Notre Dame emotional rollercoaster started back on an uphill climb Saturday as the men's basketball team again established itself as a team that can beat anybody, as opposed to a team that anybody can beat. 
The Irish didn't just beat Missouri; they trounced a lack­adaisical Tiger team which came in ranked third in the country and left the Joyce ACC as quickly as possible. The final score: 98-67. 
"This is one of the great wins ever here," Notre Dame head coach Digger Phelps said. "''ll take them No. 3 any time. Winning by 30 points was a fluke because of the emotion-1 wouldn't want to play them 10 times, but when we needed it, we got it done." 
When the Irish needed it most was early in the second half, as they built up a big lead and bat­tled against the letdown that has plagued them in the past few games. 
The five players who kept the Irish, now 15-11, up and the Tigers down were not, perhaps, those you would expect: Scott Paddock, Daimon Sweet, Monty Williams, Tim Singleton and Kevin Ellery. all of whom have sat this season and watched other Irish players take center stage. 
But not Saturday. 

"Every guy on the court had seen time on the bench," said Singleton, who had three key steals in the Irish run. "But each guy contributed. This was the time to show what we could do. On the court, we were re­laxed, and it was a team effort. We knew this time, when we got the lead, we had to bury them from there." 
With a 20-point lead at the 
11:32 mark in the second half, the five, along with center Keith Robinson, put together a 16-2 tear that lasted until 6:35 re­mained to play, built an 85-51 lead, and iced Notre Dame's second win over a top-five team on national television. 
Included in that span were goaltending calls on two con­secutive trips down the court, two steal-and-scores by Singleton and two inside moves for Paddock for scores. The balance was evident during that stretch, and also on the score sheet, where five Irish players scored in double figures, led by Williams with 14, and three more players added nine points each. 
"It started with the Dayton game," Paddock said of Notre Dame's 97-79 loss. "Our backs were to the wall. We realized we didn't want to go out this way. Coach got us a great game plan, and we executed. Everything clirked. We've been knocked down a lot, but we haven't given in." 
Notre Dame's starting live of Sweet. Ellery, Hobinson. LaPhonso Ellis and Elmer Bennett played the first I 0 minutes of the first half, falling behind early but putting to­gether an 11-2 run to take the lead, and working to a 23-19 advantage bnfore Phelps began substituting.

Bell sounds on 60th Bengal Bouts 
Trainor's courageous comeback highlights final round 
By KEN TYSIAC 
Sports Writer 
It appeared that the 167­pound battle between between Chris Balint and Mike Trainor in the finals of 60th Bengal Bouts Friday night would end just seconds after it began in the north dome of the Joyce ACC. 
Balint twice knoeked Trainor to the eanvas with powerful right uppereuts early in the first round. and although Trainor managed to regain his senses and continun. a come­back victory seemed unfath­omable. 
"I knew he would come right at mP." said Trainor. "He just hit mP really hard. AftHr that, I just listened to my eorner man and my twin brother who I'd been · <lrking with for a while, and started to jab and move." 
At tlw end of the first round, Trainor turned the tide a bit with <:ombination to Balint's head. ;jAs the fight progressed, Balint seemed to tire as Trainor used a superior reach advantage to daze his oppo­nent, finally forcing a standing eight count in the third round. 
When final bell sounded, the crowd rose to its feet in appre­dation of Trainor's courage and Balint's strength in what was easily the best bout of the night. A unanimous decision by the judges made Trainor's im­probable comeback complete by awarding him a Bengal Bouts crown. 

"It was a elassic matchup," said boxing coach Sean Mc­Cormick. "The straight ahead fighter (Balint) versus a boxer with classic style (Trainor). Trainor started moving side to side, and that's what won the fight for him. I wasn't sur­prised at the comeback because he's in such great shape. Mike Trainor is just a terrific ath­lete, he's a tough kid with a su­per jab." 
Trainor and 13 other tough kids earned the right to be ealled Bengal Bouts champs on Friday night. For some. like 134-pounder John Manfredy. it was not a new experience. 
Manfredy, a fourth-year ar­chitect major who did not de­fend his championship last year because he was in Rome. had to defeat Derek Bartlett, a very formidable opponent, in order to regain his crown. 
"(Bartlett) was a very tough opponent, and he gave me the best tight I ever had. I tried to slow him down and get to the body, but he was moving around the ring pretty well," said Manfredy. 
Nonetheless, Manfredy held on to win a unanimous decision. 
Two-time defending 255­pound champ Brian Shannon pummeled Dave Prinzivalli, who was weakened by strep throat, on the way to his third consecu­tive championship. Prinzivalli came out strong, but tired midway through the first round and took a tremendous beating. Prinzivalli managed to finish the fight, but Shannon won by unanimous decision. 
In the 144-pound division, de­fending champ Doug Biolchini once again took his 10 stitches into the ring, this time against Lee Whitman, who controlled the early parts of the bout. But Biolchini's superior stamina showed in the end, and he came back for a unanimous victory. 
"(Whitman) came out strong," praised Biolchini. "The guy's a good boxer with a lot of heart. I think my stamina helped a lot, though. I still felt good, I had something left at the end of the fight." 
Controversy surrounded the

''I'm sure a lot of people thought we would lose by 30," Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps said. "And I'm sure when we had the lead. ev­erybody thought we'd blow it. But those are the things we've been working on." 
When the Irish took a big second-half lead against Missouri, they turned it into show time instead of fold time. 
And this show had many stars. 
Daimon Sweet and LaPhonso Ellis dunking early in the half, Kevin Ellery hitting the trifecta, Scott Paddock putting in rebound baskets and left-handed hooks. Keith Robinson scoring from inside and outside, Tim Singleton dunking twice including a reversal after one of his game-high four steals and Monty Williams slamming the alley-oop home to give Singleton one of his game-high eight assists. 
"It felt like we  were in practice out there,"  
Singleton said.
