By CLAIRE HEININGER News Writer 
For a sickness as personal and painful as an eating disorder, often the only people who can offer real help are those who have been there before. Jessica Weiner has been there before ­and before and before as she slipped in and out of her anorex­ia and bulimia -and proved on Wednesday that she was ready to help. 
Weiner, the author of "A Very Hungry Girl: How I Filled Up on Ufe ... and How You Can, Too!," gave a presentation about her own struggles with self-loathing and self-starvation, offering insight, strategies and a tri­wnphant outlook to sufferers of eating disorders. 
Coining the label "actionist," she described herself as someone who "looks at what we tangibly have in front of us today-not five pounds from now, not five years from now -I aim to take back the power that each individ­ual day can hold." 
Roughly 200 students packed the LaFortune Ballroom to attend Weiner's presentation, which was titled "Do I Look Fat in This?" Beginning with the first diet that her mom imposed on her at the age of 11, Weiner chronicled her fight against a negative body image. 
"For the first time, I saw my body as something I had to fix, to starve, to change," Weiner said. "It became a cycle of pain, of shame, of blame, of punishment and of restriction." 
Despite years of dieting, Weiner said that she still didn't believe she had a problem because she didn't match the size zeroes around her. 
"I was an in-between girl," she 
said. "I was never 5'10" and 89 
pounds. But that doesn't mean I 
wasn't sick." 
In addition to discrediting the hollow-cheeked, model-thin stereotype of an eating disorder victim, she also refuted the com­mon misconception that eating disorders only affect "snobby rich white girls who want to be skinny and pretty." Instead, she said we should replace that image with "someone from any race, gender or socioeconomic background ­just somebody in pain who does­n't know how to express it," she said. 
The low point of her own pain hit during her freshman year at Penn State University, when Weiner added drug and alcohol abuse to a harsh cycle of anorex­ia, diuretic bulimia and compul­sive eating. 
"I woke up every morning thinking, 'what am I going to do to destroy myself today?'" Weiner said. "I was suicidal. I had zero self worth." 
Her first major breakthrough, she said, came when she decided to throw up for the first time. 
"I remember seeing a sign hanging in the bathroom that said, 'Eating Disorders Can Kill,"' she said. "And underneath it a woman had written, 'Screw you I'm already dead."' 
Weiner said that it was at that moment she realized that eating disorders needed to be talked about. After joining a support group and hearing fellow women with eating disorders tell their painful stories of family trawna, abuse, poverty, divorce, self­mutilation and other "tortured secrets," she realized the release and empowerment that came from discussion and mutual sup-

Student reports rape 

SMC student claims rape after possible drugging 
By SCOTT BRODFUEHRER 
News Writer 
The St. Joseph County Family Violence and Special Victims unit is investigating a 21-year-old Saint Mary's student's claim that she was raped early Sunday morn­ing. 
The woman told police she suspected that a man placed a drug in her drink at the Linebacker Lounge on Saturday night or early Sunday morning, said South Bend Police Captain John Williams. 
Williams said he could not release a copy of the police report to The Observer, but confirmed details of the alleged incident. 
The woman said she went to the bar on Saturday night with a male friend and met his roommate there. While at the bar, she said the roommate bought and gave her drinks. 

The woman left the bar at 3 a.m. with her friend and his roommate and returned to their apartment, where she said they continued to drink before she was later given a pillow and a blanket to sleep on the couch.

when No. 5 West  
Virginia comes  

to town to battle the undefeated No. 2 Fighting Irish. 
It is an opportunity to come out and watch at Alumni Field on Friday night at 7 p.m. when the Irish will look to avenge last year's loss in Morgantown that assured the ending of their reign as Big East Champions. 
For students, entrance into the game is free. Even for everyone else. how often can you watch two teams near the top of their sport compete in your own back­yard for only a few dollars? 
Until last year, the Irish had never lost to West Virginia. It was the first time in team history that the Irish had not won the Big East Tournament Championship, let alone make the tournament. 
But this has been a new year for the Irish. 
Bolstered by a tremendous freshman class and returning starters coming back from injury, this team has dominated its first ten opponents to the tune of nine wins and one tie through ten games. 
The wins have come against strong opponents, including a scoring advantage of 40-5 that includes wins over such ranked teams as Wake Forest, Arizona State and Santa Clara. 
The game against West Virginia is also huge for the eventual NCAA selections. A win against West Virginia means the Irish will have the inside track toward gaining one of the top four seeds in the NCAA Tournament. 
What's important about the top four. you ask? It means home games all the way until the College Cup Final Four in North Carolina. 
Irish soccer has a tradition of excellence, having advanced to the National Semifinals six times since 1994, including one National Championship in 1995. 
Four times the Irish have played in the Championship game, with the most recent trip being 1999. With the No. 2 ranking in the country. this Irish team is looking to return to the heights of its predecessors, but they need your help. 
Cheer on the Irish this Friday night at 7 p.m. at Alumni Field. Help the Irish protect their 43­game home winning streak against Big East opponents by avenging their only loss to the Mountaineers in program history.

Chinese companies can't stop employers' marriages 
BEIJING -Marriage in China used to be a mat­ter for a man, a woman -and the couple's employers. No longer. 
On Wednesday. China eliminated a much­resented requirement for couples to obtain their bosses' approval before tying the knot, prompting thousands of couples to wed in what, for some, was also a celebration of the retreat of outside interference in their pri­vate lives. 
Couples lined up as early as 5 a.m. outside marriage registration offices. Restaurants and hotel banquet halls were booked solid in major cities, and Beijing's 
streets were clogged with flower-bedecked motor­cades. 
"Employers in work units used to have a lot of power over people, but now there's no need." said newlywed Wen Ying, who was having a late­night snack with her new husband and friends at a small restaurant near the Forbidden City, Beijing's ancient imperial palace. 
"We're really glad that this rule was canceled because it was a real hassle. It makes getting married feel even bet­ter," said Wen's husband, Liu Ping. Liu said the couple had planned to throw a formal banquet for their families, but were forced to postpone because restaurants were all reserved by oth­ers. 
Women beat the system, give birth In Michigan 
LANSING, Mich. Nearly two dozen women from the Middle East are accused of making brief trips to the United States to give birth, then defrauding Medicaid to cover the medical costs. 
Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox said Wednesday the 23 women flew to the Detroit area to deliver their babies and get emergency Medicaid benefits to pay for them. Within a few months, the women returned to their native countries of Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. he said. 
The Medicaid costs totaled $150,000.

Moore, Santoni kick off Theology on Tap 
By ANDREW THAGARD Assistant News Editor 
Notre Dame alumni Colleen Moore and Frank Santoni tackled the intri­cacies of the campus dating scene in the first installment of 'Theology on Tap" at Legends Wednesday evening. 
"Ever since Legends opened up it seemed like a great opportunity to bring people together," said Father J. Steele, who co-hosts the program with Father Kevin Russeau. 
Addressing a crowded room of about 100 students, Moore and Santoni focused on the two extremes of relationships at Notre Dame­random hookups and the "ring by spring" phenomenon, and said that there isn't much in between. 
'The only thing that is in the mid­dle is us wondering why nothing is happening," Santoni said. 
The two noted that not much has changed in this regard since their time as undergraduates at the University. 
"It's scary," Moore said. 'We grad­uated six years ago complaining about the [dating] scene. Really, noth­ing has changed." 
According to Moore, students are attracted to the extremes of relation­ships because they are well defined and focused on the individual. 
"Neither of the [extreme relation­ships] really leaves a lot of room for the other person and their needs," she said. 
The two offered a four-fold path to achieving healthier relationships. First, Moore and Santoni urged stu­dents to be "others" centered. 
'To do dating well is not going to be about you," Santoni said. "It's going to be about being in a relation­ship with someone else. God designs us with a need to connect deeply and authentically with other people." 
He also said that it's important to be open to exploring yourself, others and God and to be "present" minded. 
'Too often we're too caught up in our internal dialogue to pay attention to the date," Moore said. 
Finally, the two emphasized that successful dating is a mutual invest-. ment that requires self-knowledge. 
"Tilis whole 'dating in the middle' isn't an easy thing but it's very possi­ble," Moore said. "It's kind of in your hands." 
'Theology on Tap" is organized by Campus Ministry and takes place Wednesday evenings at Legends. The event was inspired by a similar concept in the Archdiocese of Chicago. Participants were provided with free snacks and non-alcoholic beverages. Students of age could purchase alcoholic beverages, but few chme to do so. 
"It's been in the works for a long time," said Courtney Schuster, a stu­dent coordinator. "It's a really awe­some way to bring people together in an informal setting to talk about real stuff." 
Next week's "Theology on Tap" will feature Bill Mattison and a dis­cussion on "How Far is Too Far?: Catholic Sexual Ethics."

because they had a conflict with the training. Currently, the only two reasons an RA may miss any part of training are personal ill­nesses or a death in the family. 
Several RAs were not permit­ted to fulfill their duties this year, as they had conflicts with the training schedule. 
Howard Hall Senator Brin Anderson said, "These people were chosen because they were the most qualified. To have someone else fill their shoes affects dorm life as a whole." 
The resolution will go before the CLC, and senators say they hope that it will incite the CLC to form a committee and recom­mend changes to the RA training 
Wednesday on a 

process to change the way the budget is approved within Student Government. 
Through the current process, the Senate approves the budget a few weeks after elections in the spring. This means that sen­ators who have only been involved with the Student Government process a few weeks have the responsibility of first understanding and approv­ing the budget. 
Student Body Vice President Jeremy Lao said that the reason behind the discussion to change the budget approval is to "take care of the inefficiencies of Student Government." He con­tinued that the problem was when the current Senate was new last spring, they "tried to make amendments to the budg­et. The [Financial Management Board] felt that they had appro­priated money in the most effi­cient way, and when the Senate suggested changes, the FMB was upset and felt the new Senate didn't understand the process." 
Within the next few weeks, senators will draft a resolution to give the responsibility of approving the budget to the Executive Cabinet. They said it is their belief that the Executive Cabinet has more experience in dealing with money appropria­tions, and that they better understand the issues involved in granting money to organiza­tions. 
The issue was taken up in the Executive Cabinet meeting held Monday. They are also in discus­sion, and in all likelihood will be drafting a resolution to accept budget-approving responsibili­ties within the next few weeks, after the anticipated Senate res­olution passes. 
In other Senate news: 
+ Senators approved Jan Vijayaraghavan as head con­troller of the Student Union Board. Nominated by board manager Charlie Ebersol, Vijayaraghavan served as a con­troller for the board last year. She fills a vacancy left in the head controller position.

dangerous statistic reflects those who have attempted to control their weight through dieting, says Valerie Staples, eating disorder specialist at the University Counseling Center. "Dieting is the number-one risk factor for devel­opment of an eating disorder, and depending on the survey you examine, the percentage of col­lege-age women who try to diet can be as high as 91 percent,n she said.

homogenous popu­lation and the high percentage of ex-varsity high school athletes on campus have also been named as factors that can push even a slightly body­conscious Notre Dame student over the edge, Staples said. 
While hesitant to label Notre Dame's environment as more conducive to abusive dieting and exercising than that of any other campus, Staples said that the stresses of university life can lead to many different Wlderlying self­esteem issues that are then mani­fested in a student's body image. 
"It's all about identity, self-con­fidence, empowerment," Staples said. "An eating disorder is some­thing much more comprehensive than just the food aspect." 
Kelly Shaffer, one of seven stu­dent leaders of the eating disor­ders student support group A llie Uncommon, agreed. 

"An eating disorder is just a symptom of a bigger confidence problem," she said. "It's really a reaction to societal pressures forcing us to strive for bodily per­fection." 
Following this philosophy, both Health Services and A Life Uncommon have designed strate­gies that incorporate more than just better nutrition into their programs for students who suffer from eating disorders. Although Health Services does ask every student -no matter how far the disorder has progressed, 
toward men­

tal therapy, both for individuals and for groups, Staples said. 
"Our group approach tries to give the student an accurate mir­ror ofthe outside world. We want to help them realize all of the quality characteristics about themselves that have nothing to do with their bodies," she said. "It is a very difficult step to take when an individual first comes forward, but these things are treatable. Talking in groups to people who are at other stages of recovery helps them to see the light at the end of the tunnel." 
Shaffer said that A Life Uncommon does not claim to be a professionally trained counsel­ing group, but that it also promis­es to offer this type of nonthreat­ening community healing. 
"When we're all honest with each other, we start to under­stand that it's not just about fixing the behaviors ... a healthy physi­cal pattern doesn't ensure that those feelings won't come back," she said. 
Kristi Peterson, another of the group's student leaders, empha­sized the spiritual side of the meetings. "You don't even neces­sarily have to have an eating dis­order to come," she said. "We just want girls on campus to see that they're not alone -there are people supporting you. We try to promote girls being united in their opinions of their bodies instead of going against each other in such a competitive way." 
While usually associated with female competition, eating disor­ders' effects on men should not be overlooked, Staples pointed out. 
"We need to do a better job of talking about this as an inclusive problem," she said. "Men's body issues can exist in a totally differ­ent way -the pressure to use supplements and exercise to beef up their appearance. Ifmales are brave enough to begin the dia­logue, we should be sensitive to their concerns as well." 
Staples said she was encour­aged by recent steps toward increasing awareness and more open discussion of eating disor­ders at Notre Dame. "This is why we're bringing Jessica Weiner in," she said. "Let's talk about it. You're not going to get judged or kicked out of school. We will wel­come people because there is hope."

woman said she woke up naked next to the roommate in his bed. 
Brent Hemmerlein, com­mander of the Family Violence and Special Victims unit, declined to state whether the accused is a Notre Dame student. 
"Right now I can't release that information. It is an active investigation ... it is an acquaintance situation, someone known to the vic­tim," Hemmerlein said. 
The woman told police she had never blacked out before 

and said she thought it was possible that the roommate drugged her drink. 
The alleged victim went to St. Joseph Regional Medical Center on Monday for a rape exam and to see whether she had been drugged. Hemmerlein said that the hospital provided some exam results to the victim, who gave them to his department. 
The police must obtain a consent form from the victim to obtain the results of the exam. How the investigation will progress depends on the victim's wishes, Hemmerlein said.

Rwanda retains coalition government 
KIGALI, Rwanda -The ruling party of President Paul Kagame won nearly three­fourths of the vote in Rwanda's first multi­party legislative elections since its independ­ence from Belgium in 1962, election officials said Wednesday. 

With all votes counted from Tuesday's elec­tion, the head of the electoral commission, Chrysologue Karangwa, said the five-party coalition headed by the Rwandan Patriotic Front won 73.78 percent of the vote, ensur­ing a majority of the 53 elected seats in the 80-seat lower house or Chamber of Deputies. 
Seats are apportioned to parties and inde­pendent candidates according to the percent­age of votes they receive, and the electoral commission on Friday will announce the number of seats for the RPF coaJition and two opposition parties that qualified for rep­resentation in the Chamber of Deputies.

Girl lives two weeks without mother 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -A 2-year-old girl left home alone for 2 1/2 weeks while her mother was in jail has been released from the hospital after being treated for malnutri­tion and dehydration, officials said Wednesday. 
The child, who survived by eating ketchup, mustard and dried pasta, was released late Tuesday from Wolfson Children's Hospital to the custody of the state Department of Children & Families. The agency granted temporary custody to her father, Ogden Lee, who is separated from the girl's mother and was not informed that she had been jailed. 
The little girl had been left alone since her mother, Dakeysha Telita Lee, was jailed Sept. 10 on charges of aggravated assault and petty theft, police said. The mother was charged Monday with child abuse and was being held Wednesday on $170,006 bond.

Now a healthy weight, Weiner said that an eating dis­order is not something that can be overcome overnight. "I'm a human being in the recovery process, not a product. I'm def­initely still ~erable, but I'm not in secret anymore." 
She encouraged listeners to stop wasting time and energy on the "language of fat" and to replace it with "the real stuff. Get rid of the judgment, banter and criticism and tell the truth." 
Weiner has been working as an activist since her gradua­tion from Penn State eight years ago. 
In addition to her nationally known programs on eating dis­orders, she has also counseled parents, teachers and children about alcohol and drug abuse as well as school violence and hate crimes.

"Simply put, the creative class doesn't migrate to a place character­ized by strip malls and chain outlets. They migrate to cities that are more exciting and diverse," he said. "Access to this critical mass of cre­ative thinkers is driving economic growth today." 
Haynes said the University's DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, along with increased support of the arts within South Bend, will encour­age members of the creative class to move to South Bend and fuel eco­nomic growth ofthe region. 
The University's long-term plan, in fact, envisions developing areas sur­rounding the facility, including mixed-use retail space on Eddy Street and new housing in surround­ing neighborhoods.

IN BRIEF 
Judge OK's suit against Enron 
HOUSTON -Current and former Enron 

Corp. employees will be allowed to proceed 
with a lawsuit that contends the bankrupt 
energy trader didn't meet its duties in admin­
istering the company's pension plan. 
In a 329-page order released Wednesday, 

U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon denied motions by Enron and its former chief execu­tive, Kenneth Lay, requesting the claims against them be dismissed. 
However, Harmon did dismiss claims that cited the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act against a number of other Enron officials, including former chief executive Jeff Skilling and former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. 
Move to regulate tobacco fails 
WASHINGTON-Talks in Congress to regu­late the tobacco industry broke down along partisan lines Wednesday, making it highly unlikely new restrictions would be imposed on the cigarette industry anytime soon. 
Democrats and Republicans on the Senate health committee have been trying for months to negotiate a deal that would give the Food and Drug Administration oversight of ciga­rettes. Late Wednesday, Sen. Judd Gregg, R­N.H., the chairman of the committee, sent Democrats a draft of what he said was his final legislative proposal. Democrats rejected the offer, saying it didn't go far enough. 
Class action denied against Monsanto 
ST. LOUIS -A federal judge has ruled against granting class-action status to a law­suit accusing Monsanto Co. and some of its seed-marketing rivals of plotting to control prices of genetically modified corn and soy­beans. 
U.S. District Judge Rodney Sippel's ruling, released Wednesday, thwarts a bid by attor­neys suing the companies to expand the 1999 lawsuit to include more than 100,000 farm­ers, not just the handful of farmers in the original lawsuit. 
Students organize charity tournament

could ever stop. 
Abroad

Sometimes I think that there is a conspiracy amongst the networks to pre-empt the possibility of satire by producing pro­gramming so morally grotesque as to defy caricature. Jerry Springer hosts a moral freak show, but you cannot satirize his show effectively because the satire would be indistinguishable from a regular episode. And what is the point of com­plaining that Jackass is stupid when the show wears its stupidity like an inane grin? 
Yes, it's easy to get depressed about the state ofTelevision. But things aren't as bad as they first appear. In fact, ifyou ignore the countless shows that aim to keep us watching by producing the ethical equivalent of a highway pile-up every week -and that's all you can do, ignore them-you might conclude, as I have, that we are currently enjoying a golden age of Television. For while some shows seek to attract viewers by pushing the boundaries of taste and ethics, some net­works have adopted a more innovative approach, commissioning programs which stand out because they are really very good. 
The lesson they finally seem to have learned is that they may not be able to compete with the film studios when it comes to explosions and special effects, but if they produce shows which are suffi­ciently well-written to reward second or even third viewings then they can earn their advertising revenues several times over before going on to clean up with video sales. 
So, while the average programs are in steady decline towards the lowest com­mon denominator -I'll defer to the math majors as to whether that's a mixed metaphor -the best programs have never been better. And if you don't have enough time to watch much television anyway, that works outjust fme. 
At the risk of incurring the wrath of fans ofThe Sopranos or Six Feet Under, I think the best show to appear in recent years is The West Wing, and I was delighted last week when President Jed Bartlett, Notre Dame's most accomplished fictional alumnus, made his much antici­pated return to America's screens after a lengthy summer recess. 
For four years the show has been writ­ten by Aaron Sorkin, who is also its cre­ator. Sorkin is an undisguised I.Q. fetishist, and everyone who works in the Bartlett Administration is not only intel­lectually brilliant, but endlessly witty and politically savvy to an almost telepathic degree. 
Bartlett himself holds a Nobel Prize in economics, has an encyclopedic knowl­edge of literature and can speak extempo­raneously in Latin when the mood takes him. It must have taken considerable restraint on Sorkin's part not to give him X-ray vision and the power of flight. 
The West Wing is sometimes criticized for its liberal bias, which is unmistakable. Sorkin's own liberal commitments are well known and doubtless influence his presentation of issues, but even if Sorkin's politics were more centrist I suspect that the show would have been pulled to the left by the demands of dramatic narrative. 
llberalism tends towards the heroic view of politics, the belief that the govern­ment could transform the world for the better if only the people in charge were clever enough, brave enough, good enough. Ilberals often complain about political corruption and ineptitude -and rightly so -but they are usually reluctant to view the failures of government as inevitable. Of course conservatives believe that leaders make a difference too, but they tend to be more pessimistic about what the state can achieve regardless of who is in charge. . 
The argument between liberalism and conservatism is partly a matter of history and partly a matter of faith. It would be foolish to pronounce on the political mer­its of the two creeds here, but there is no question which view makes for better sto­ries. llberalism is simply more inspiring. This explains, I believe, the longstanding paradox that the market-driven enter­tainment industry consistently produces drama well to the left of American popu­lar opinion. 
Even those who complain that Sorkin puts his thumb on the scales when deal­ing with most issues usually admit to being fans. In a climate in which a sneer­ing and reflexive cynicism often passes for sophisticated political opinion, there is something refreshing about seeing politi­cal ideas and idealism presented in such an intelligent, informed and articulate way. The quality of the dialogue allows the show to transcend any narrow politi­cal ideology. Sorkin's fictional president was never more clearly expressing the writer's own hopes than when he declares his ambitions for his presidency: 
"We're going to raise the level of public debate in this country, and let that be our legacy." 
Amen.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Questioning value of foreign study 
Can we stop the madness? Please? I've been at Notre Dame for six years now and have seen and heard all this before. I get it-you lived in some place different, didn't study, saw some people of a different culture-London, how exotic, especially with those quaint names they have for everything-hung out with college students from the United States in a new and sexually liberal environment and ate great food. 
Let me guess, it's bittersweet coming back to Notre Dame, but you ma~e memories that will last a lifetime. Did I forget to add the ktcker? The whole, "I gained a perspective that there is more out there than just Reekers, dorm parties and football." 
But what e~se is out there, and why can't you get it here? 
The commodification of the "study abroad experience" only serves to cheapen and streamline a supposedly exotic and eye-opening experience into something you apply for, enlist in, sign up for and then purchase, consume and use later. 
Ralph Waldo Emerson reminds us that traveling in this way-gathering up experiences, scenes and various treas­ures-is not only not fulfilling, but ultimately hollow. I encourage those that want to boost their GPAs to study abroad; I encourage those that want to drink deeply from life's cup to pray, ponder, read, ask and wonder. If you want gelato, grab some yo-cream and add water. It works every­time.

Support basic human rights 
I was both disturbed and dis­appointed by Katy Kemnetz's Oct. 1 letter. Specifically, Kemnetz seems to be promot­ing cultural relativism, which is basically the idea that there is no single "truth," and that the relevance of one's moral stan­dards completely depends on the society in which one is liv­ing. She fails to recognize the dangers inherent in such a the­ory. 
Evidence it should outrage the ethical conscience of people world­wide. And Kemnetz's depiction of so-called "cutting" is a flow­ery allusion to the despicable practice of female genital muti­lation. I am unwilling to accept such a gross violation of human rights on the grounds that I don't understand Tanzanian society.

"the Maasi tribes ... cut their women so that they feel no

If a Hindu woman does not throw herself onto her deceased husband's funeral pyre willingly, in many places she will be forced into the flames. This isn't a cute cultural discrepancy; this is murder, and 
on all issues. 
However, there are still basic principles of human rights that must tran­scend all nations. The intrinsic dignity of humankind cannot be denied simply because different parts of the globe chose to express their artistic, culinary, or religious sentiments in vary­ing ways. This is the universal "natural law" of which Locke spoke, which we are obliged to support, not only as Catholics but also as morally decent fel­low human beings.

certainly correct 
\1 

in noting that we have been very critical of particu­lar elements of Notre Dame's employment policies, PSA has also repeated­ly acknowledged the many positives associated with working on this campus. 
For evidence of this one need look no further than the current edi­tion of Scholastic in which Kate Maich com­mends the University for offering several fan­tastic benefits and maintaining a generally good work environment. Indeed, having spent considerable time interacting with employees, members of PSA would be the first to agree that many workers on campus are highly sat­isfied with their jobs. 
Haight accuses PSA of being blind to the charitable work performed by the University and the Congregation of the Holy Cross. I would suggest, however, that it is he who is blind to the possibility that injustice and sig­nificant room for improvement can exist with­in an institution that is otherwise a leading

force for good. His own experience notwith­standing, there are men and women working on this campus who struggle to make ends meet on what the University pays them. 
Furthermore, as B.J. Strew argues, Notre Dame's position on neu­trality and voluntary recogni­tion falls short of what we believe should be demanded of Catholic universities. These are issues that should concern us all. 
Particularly baf­fling was Haight's claim that PSA 
considers those in low-income situa­tions to be inca­pable of amount­ing to anything. I can assure him 
that nothing is far­ther from the truth and I would ask that he point me to 
anything that indi­cates otherwise. As an organization 
with several members from backgrounds similar to Haight's own, PSA is itself evidence of the equal capabilities 
of individuals from all walks of life. I am deeply insulted that Haight would perceive my involvement in PSA as being motivated by the belief that working men and women are inept and somehow in need of my help. On the contrary, I believe I speak for all of PSA when I say we are driven by the knowledge that an injustice to one is an injustice to all and that we are all called to fight injustice whenever and wherever it occurs.

The movie is called "Racing Stripes," an ani­mated story about a horse who over­comes prejudice and self-doubt to pursue his dream of running with thoroughbreds. 
Spade's plans for the future include more movies, stand-up and per­haps even a TV show. "I will prob­ably try to put a TV show together because I liked it," Spade said. "It was fun. I do one move about every two years. Movies are just tough. They're a lot of work. A TV show is just the right amount of work."

Celebrating 25 years of a Remarkable Man 
by Rev. Richard Warner, c.s.c. 
.Director, Office of Campus Ministry 
On October 16, 1978, the election of the first non-Italian Pope in over 450 years rook place in Rome with the eighth ballot election of the Cardinal Archbishop of 
Krakow as Pope John Paul II. While this event took place years before any of the under­graduates at Notre Dame were. born, his papacy has marked their lives as surely as it has hundreds of millions of people. 
During these years, the Holy Father has written more than SO major documents, and has.spoken the truth about matters related to Catholic teaching and discipline during an era ofdramatic advances in medicine and technology, The Catechism of the Catholic Church was approved and promulgated by the Holy Father with the prayer that "Catechesis will find in (this work) a genuine, systematic presentation of the faith and of Catholic doctrine (in) a totally reliable way..." 
At the same rime, he has spoken often on the need for richer narions to come to the aid ofthose who are poor among them and the poor throughout the world. He has traveled more than 700,000 miles in missionary journeys to just about every corner of d1e world. · 
People who know him describe him as a very sensitive and intelligent man with a pen~trating gaze and a knack for making people around him feel at ease. I had the extraordinary privilege ofcelebrating Mass with Pope John Paul II on several occasions in his private chapel. As I entered the chapel before the Mass began, he was seated in the front, deeply engaged in prayer as he had been for the previous hour. It was dear that all of us were in the presence of a holy priest. 
He has called, elected and appointed bishops from around the world to Rome for synods or discussions on topics ofspecial pastor.al importance. In recent yearsJ synod themes have been dedicated to the challenges and opportunities of the Church on the various continents. The Holy Father himself has promulgated rhese proceedings in special visits to significant places where he mer with leaders and members of rhe Church. 
PopeJohn Paul II will be remembered for the role he played in bringing about the downfall ofCommunism in the countries ofthe former Soviet Union and in Eastern European countries. He has been a strong advocate for peace and against war, including the recent war in Iraq. He has frequently called on the peoples of the Holy Land to find a way ro live in peace with one another. 
He has presided over the Catholic Church during a time of great gro·wrh in Asia and Mrica. The Chmch's social and economic activities around the world have increased dramatically.

football. The Irish would then play a limited football schedule against ACC teams (instead of the Big East teams Notre Dame 
currently plays) while it consid­ers full football membership. 
But Heisler and ACC com­missioner John Swofford quick­ly denied the rumors that said Notre 
Dame  was  on  
the  brink  of  
reaching  an  
agreement.  

"The thing 
you have to understand," he 
said, "is that Kevin [White] 
spends a great deal of time with 
all of these commissioners. Who 
knows what they all talk about." 
The ACC is looking to add a 
12th member because then it 
can host a lucrative conference 
championship game, which can 
generate over $10 million in rev­
enue. Their appeal to host a 
championship game, even 
though the league will only have 
11 members in 2004, was 
denied by the NCAA. 
Saturday, the prospects of 
Notre Dame joining the ACC took 
a huge hit after the league's nine 
current presidents decided that 
any school that joined the con­
ference must join in all sports. 
But while the topic of inviting 
Notre Dame to join the league 
never arose, one of the ACC 
presidents said that no new 
member would get preferential 
treatment. 
"What we talked about was 
the importance of affirming the 
principles on which this confer­
ence has been built, which are 
equity and full participation," 
said North Carolina State chan­
cellor Marye Ann Fox, who is 
also a member of Notre Dame's · 
Board of Trustees. "We affirmed 
that equal participation would 
be necessary." 
But if joining a conference 
means the Irish have to lose 
their football independence, 
Notre Dame will have none of it. 
Notre Dame has a $8.5 million 
television contract with NBC 
(which expires in 2005) and sells 
out virtually every home game, 
which Heisler said are both rea­
sons why the Irish are unlikely 
to consider giving up that inde­
pendence. 
"That's historically been important to the institution. That's been important to the institutional identity," Heisler said. "I don't sense that there's any sort of suggestion that we're prepared to do an about-face." 
Staying In the Big East 
Because of its eight-year affili­ation with the Big East, Heisler said Notre Dame is waiting to see what the conference's next move is. The league's school presidents -and its commis­sioner, Mike Tranghese -have stayed relatively quiet since they blasted the ACC for poaching Miami and Virginia Tech from the league. 

But last week, the Boston Globe reported that league pres­idents had settled on expanding to a massive 16-team conference by inviting Conference USA schools Louisville and Cincinnati for all sports and Marquette and DePaul for all sports except foot­ball. Assuming Notre Dame stays in the league, that would give the Big East eight football schools and eight non-football playing schools by 2005. 
That's not the only option, either. In early September,

Big East foe Georgetown. Its only loss came against St. John's, who opened the home stand with a 3­0 shutout ofthe Irish. 
Since the St. John's game, Notre Dame has built a six-game unbeaten streak and allowed just two goals. 
The shot totals tell the story of the Irish season. Notre Dame has out shot its opponents by almost a 2:1 ratio, with 138 shots to opponents' 79. 
The offense deserves credit for pressuring opposing defenses. Senior forward Justin Detter received some of that credit this Monday, being named Big East co-offensive player of the week. Detter scored one goal in each of the victories over Bradley and Georgetown. 
The offense, however, feeds off the midfield and defense. Notre Dame's defense has been superb up to the season's midway point. 
Just as left defender Kevin Goldthwaite heard praise last week, right defender Kevin Richards is being recognized for his efforts. Richards was named conference defensive player of the week on Monday. He plays on a defense that has allowed only six goals all season -three in one game -and that has a goals-against average of 0.61, ranking thirteenth in the nation. 
Now, the Irish will face a Syracuse team (2-5-2, 0-2-1) they have had great success against. Notre Dame leads the all-time series 6-2-0. The Irish and Orangemen did not meet last sea­son, but Notre Dame won the last meeting with the Orangemen by a score of 2-1 at Alumni Field in 2001.

Belles pound Kalamazoo 4-0 
Observer Staff Report 
The Saint Mary's soccer team had little trouble dispos­ing of MIAA rival Kalamazoo Wednesday afternoon, win­ning 4-0. 
Four different Belles scored, while goalkeeper Laura Heline had four saves for Saint Mary's, who now stands at 6­1-1 and 3-1-1 in the confer­ence. 
"We had some very good scoring opportunities from numerous players on the field," Belles coach Peter Haring said. "We were able to develop some nice attacks and get more people involved dur­ing the strikes towards goal." 
Jennifer Concannon was assisted by Carrie Orr on a 30 yard shot just outside the right box to put the Belles ahead early 1-0. In the second half, Concannon assisted the Belles next score, by finding Stephanie Artnak, who drilled home the second goal from 35 yards out. 

"Today [we] played a very consistent brand of soccer," Haring said. "The team was able to dictate the pace of the game and control the posses­sion of the ball throughout the majority of the match." 
The Belles put the game away for good when Ashley Hinton's shot from the left side of the goal, about 30 yards away. went through the net. 
Victoria Necroto finished off Kalamazoo with a header goal from Katie Noble.
