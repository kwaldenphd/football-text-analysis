Scholastic fate remains uncertain after meetings Monday 
By TRIPP BALTZ News Editor 
The fate of Scholastic, Notre Dame's weekly student maga­zine, remained in question after editors appealed to stu­dent and administrative leaders Monday night, accor­ding to Editor Maher Mouas­her. 
"If there is a substantial degree of control of Scholastic, most of the editorial board feel it would be difficult to con­tinue," said Mouasher. 

Five Scholastic editors, in­cluding Maher, met with Direc­tor of Student Activities Joe Cassidy at 7 Sunday night. Cassidy said he wanted to know whose decision it was to run the photograph. "All five were in on it, all five agreed on it," he said. 
Cassidy said he decided to suspend the magazine's opera­tions after the meeting. 
The conditions of the maga­zine's suspension also remained unclear, according to Mouasher. Director of Stu­dent Activities Joe Cassidy said the suspension was so Scholas­tic could "come to a better un­derstanding of what atmo­sphere they are operating under.'' 

He added, "they are not oper­ating in a vacuum." 
Cassidy said when the point is reached that both Scholastic and the administration have reached an understanding of their relationship, publication could start up again. 
Cassidy said Scholastic will

unanimously passed a resolu­tion supporting the editorial in­dependence of Scholastic at a Monday night meeting, Mouas­her spoke briefly with Vice President for Student Mfairs Father David Tyson. 
"Basically, he strongly rec­ommended we set up a dialogue with (Asst." Vice President for Student Mfairs) Sister (Jean) Lenz and <Asst. Vice President for Student Services) Father (Peter) Rocca," Mouasher said. 
Contacted late last night, Tyson said the decision to suspend Scholastic "certainly stands." He confirmed that Rocca will be handling the sit­uation. 
Cassidy said Tyson is leaving town today and will be gone for at least one month. Cassidy

Senate supports Scholastic editors with 2 resolutions 
By CHRIS JULKA Copy Editor 
The Student Senate unani­mously approved resolutions Monday supporting Scholas­tic's independence and urging Father Tyson to meet with Scholastic editors before leaving Notre Dame today. 
Director of Student Activities Joe Cassidy, who ordered Sun­day night's suspension of the magazine, was in attendance at the meeting to clarify ques­tions. 
Editor of Scholastic Maher Mouasher and other staff mem­bers at the student magazine appeared at the Senate meeting Monday night to pres­ent a four-page statement which objected to the suspen­sion on four different points. 
First, the action violated policy expressly stated in in du Lac, the official student guide to student life, the statement said. 
Mouasher cited a passage on page 25 of the guide which says, "Student publications should be free of censorship and ad-

"Clear­ly," said Mouasher, "the mag­azine was suspended because of administrative disap­proval." 
Second, the suspension oc­curred in the face of repeated assurances from administra­tion officials that Scholastic "would maintain editorial in­dependence and that this in­cluded no advance approval of copy by administration offi­cials." Mouasher said this in­dependence of Scholastic editors was reconfirmed by Tyson early Monday morning.

Scholastic issue provides forum for healthy discussion 
Censorship at Notre Dame. The issue is about as clear as the colorless, androgynous figures in artist Nick Antonakis' controversial work. 
But whether it's called censorship, check and balance, or simply conflict of artistic opinion, there are some clear facts about the suspension of Scholastic, the University's student maga­zine. 
Clearly, Scholastic's decision to print An­tonakis' sketch of an intimate scene between two people was a daring yet well-calculated move. And one which was designed to spark debate. 
The debate is much-needed. Lack of commu­nication between student media and the Office of Student Activities has caused a confusion about the roles and limitations of each group. 
Scholastic editors must have anticipated the take-charge reaction of Joseph Cassidy, direc­tor of Student Activities, when he saw the Feb. 19 issue addressing censorship. Even if the photo itself was not objectionable, it was the idea that Scholastic would be bold enough to print it that probably irked Cassidy. 
What Scholastic might not have foreseen was Cassidy's rash measure, however, of driving the staff out of its LaFortune office. And later, of installing new locks on the doors to prevent entry. 
In its vague role as "publisher," the Office of Student Activities has gone too far in its recent censorship actions against Juggler and Scholastic magazines. 
Cassidy states that "it is unrealistic to depict the Student Activities Office as censor since censorship is an external influence and the Stu­dent Activities Office, as publisher, is not ex­ternal." 
As an internal part of Scholastic, then, it seems that Cassidy and his staff have played a small role in the past writing, editing and decision-making of the magazine. Is it fair for the Office to now jump in and dictate what should or should not be printed? 
Cassidy may have kept Scholastic's staff locked out temporarily. In doing so, however, he unleashed a new wave of outrage at a serious threat of censorship at the University. 
The Scholastic staff knew that theoretically, 
Cindy Rauckhorst 
Senior Staff Reporter 

press in hel( 
Cassidy's office holds the same jurisdiction over Scholastic as it does over Juggler. 
So when backed into a corner, Cassidy seemed to have had no choice but to remain consistent with the initial decision which prohibited Juggler from publishing the work. 
Scholastic's article and editorial, however, dealt with the actual removal of Antonakis' artwork from the Juggler issue, a newsworthy event, and handled it as such. 
The decision to include the picture was made to facilitate an informed discussion of whether the work should have been banned from publication. 
There still are facts to be gathered and com­ments to be made. Healthy controversy and debate are the stuff of which universities are made. 
Locked doors and editorial limits on the stu­dent press are not.

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Su­preme Court said Monday it will decide whether the death penalty is a valid punishment for convicted murderers who committed their crimes before they were 18 years old. 
The justices agreed to hear the appeal of Oklahoma death row inmate William Wayne Thompson, convicted of a mur­der committed when he was 15. 
Thompson's appeal contends that executing teen-age killers violates the Constitution's ban on "cruel and unusual punish­ment." 
Of the more than 1,800 men and women on death rows nationwide, about 35 of them were condemned for crimes they committed as juveniles. 
Of the 69 U.S. prison inmates executed since 1977, three were killed for murders committed before they were 18. 
The high court attempted to resolve the same issue in 1982, in the case of Oklahoma death row inmate Monte Lee Ed­dings, but decided his case on other constitutional grounds. 
A decision in Thompson's case is expected sometime in 1988. 
Returning from a four-week recess with a flurry of activity, the court also: 
-Refused to use a case from Minnesota to reconsider its past rulings that let states re­quire some girls who seek abor­tions to get permission from their parents or a judge. 

-Agreed to judge the validity of a Virginia law banning the commercial display of some sexually explicit materials where children might get at them. 
-Rejected, in an Illinois case, a challenge to state laws re­quiring all front-seat occupants of motor vehicles to wear seat belts. The law was challenged as an invasion of privacy. 
-Said it will consider killing a 12-year-old lawsuit stemming from an armed confrontation between Indians and federal agents at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1973.

Freed Soviet prisoner vows to keep fighting 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW-Josef Begun came 
home from prison Monday to a 
hero's welcome at a snowy rail­
road station in Moscow, where 
he vowed to keep up the fight 
for Jewish emigration and 
human rights until all Soviet 
political prisoners are free. 
"Freedom for all prisoners of 
Zion!," the 55-year-old Begun 
shouted to dozens of friends and 
supporters as he emerged from 
the train that carried him to 
Moscow after more than three 
years in Chistopol Prison. 
His arms were raised trium­
phantly over his head and his 
mouth was open in a wide, gold­
flecked grin. But he looked 
tired and gaunt from a two­
week hunger strike and from 
what he called the "inhuman 
conditions" of prison. 
"I am insanely happy to be free," Begun said in Russian. "I see this is a certain sign that all political prisoners will be free in the nearest future. I will devote all my strength to see that this happens as soon as possible." 
Amid cheers and tears, friends hoisted him onto their shoulders and carried him down the platform as they sang the Israeli national anthem and the Hebrew song "Shalom Aleichem." 
One woman planted a big, red-lipsticked kiss on his right cheek. A man gave him a light blue yarmulke to replace the fur hat covering his prison­cropped hair. Begun's wife In­na, hugged his arm and his son, Boris, stood close by him. 
Friends tossed tulips and carnations at the Hebrew teacher, who until Friday was

"A lot of new evidence was admitted that had not been pre­sented before this hearing," Hannoy said. 
The hearing judge, Bill Coyle, executive secretary of the ABC, has taken the matter under advisement, and he will prepare a recommendation to present to the full commission, Hannoy said. He added that a full member vote will be taken at this next meeting. 
At Monday's meeting the full commission was not present, but, because of new evidence presented, Hannoy said Coyle the only prisoner still in Chis­topol under the law banning "anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda." 
Other such inmates were removed from Chistopol under a review of dissidents' sen­tences. Some were among the 150 dissidents who Soviet offi­cials say have been pardoned in recent weeks. 
Begun appeared optimistic about the release of political and religious dissidents and that Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms would lead to some liberalization of Soviet politics, culture and so­ciety. 
But he said without freedom for all political prisoners and free emigration, "the process of democratization will be just a lot of statistics and not real." 
Begun said he still wanted to emigrate to Israel, but aut­horities had made no promises. 
He was sentenced in October 1983 to seven years in prison and five years of internal exile for Jewish emigration activi­ties and for opposing restric­tions on teaching Hebrew. 
Begun became a symbol of the Jewish emigration move­ment. When he was not in­cluded in the announcement that Mm:mw was frPP.ing some 
imprisoned dissidents, five days of protests broke out in Moscow this month and Begun attracted world headlines. 
Plainclothes security agents broke up the last three demonstrations, kicking and punching protesters. 
Soviet officials have said all those released petitioned for a pardon and promised not to resume any activities deemed anti-Soviet. 
decided to hold another meeting with the full commis­sion present. 
Hannoy said several repre­sentatives from each side of the argument were present. "Several neighborhood resi­dents were present. Out of five, two spoke. All five were in fa­vor of the renewal," he said. 
Others at the meeting were the present owner, CTI Inc., and the prospective owner, Thomas Przybylinski. Accor­ding to Hannoy, none of these people spoke. 
Two South Bend police offi­cers spoke in opposition to the renewal as did the South Bend city attorney who read letters of complaints written by North East Neighborhood Residents, he said. 
The present owners of Corby's need the license renewal in order to sell the tavern.

Witness identifies 'Ivan the Terrible' 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM -A survivor quivering with emotion tes­tified Monday that John Dem­janjuk was the Nazi guard "Ivan the Terrible" who clubbed prisoners, gouged out their eyes and turned on the gas at the Treblinka death camp. 
"This is the man, the man sitting over there," Pinchas Epstein shouted in the court­room, pointing at the retired Cleveland auto worker and pounding repeatedly on the wit­ness stand. 
The outburst came minutes after he was asked to identify a picture of the guard in anal­bum of photographs. 
Epstein's parents, sister and two brothers perished at the concentration camp in Poland with 850,000 other Jews. He was the first survivor to testify at the trial of Demjanjuk, a native of the Soviet Ukraine accused of being the brutal guard who terrorized and gassed prisoners at Treblinka in 1942 and 1943. 

Demjanjuk, 66, denies ever being at the death camp and claims to be a victim of mis­taken identity. He listened without emotion Monday as his interpreter translated Epstein's accusations from He­brew to Ukrainian. 
The witness, 61, flushed and his voice shook as he said of Demjanjuk: "that's him sitting over there. Age has of course changed him but not so that he would become unrecog­nizable." 
Epstein pointed out a 1951 picture of Demjanjuk on the third page of the photo album and said: "This is Ivan as Ire­member him." 
"The picture is of an older man than the one I knew. Nevertheless, the round face, the very short neck, the broad shoulders, the slightly protrud­ing ears. This is I van,'' he said. 
.t:pstein escaped from Treblinka during a prisoner revolt August 1943 in which some reports said the brutal guard was killed. 
American defense attorney Mark O'Connor cross­examined Epstein about Ivan's appearance, that of a second Ukrainian guard, Nicholai, and about several Nazi SS officers at the camp. 
O'Connor has based his defense on the contentions that Ivan died in the uprising and that survivors' memories more than 40 years later are not ac­curate. 

Trial for alleged terrorist begins 
Associated Press 
PARIS -A Lebanese man ac­cused in the killings of Ameri­can and Israeli diplomats said at the opening of his trial Mon­day that he was an Arab fighter and denounced "Yankee ex­ecutioners" in his homeland. 
Georges Ibrahim Abdallah, 35, spoke for about 10 minutes in what appeared to be a rehearsed monologue when he was interrupted by Judge Maurice Colomb, who said Ab­dallah was beginning to repeat himself. 
When_Colomb asked whether an attorney representing the United States and the wife of one of the victims would like to respond, Abdallah objected and, raising his voice for the first time, shouted he should not be forced to listen to a "Yankee criminal." 

Abdallah was handcuffed and led from the courtroom, and the judge called a recess. 
Abdallah's attorney, Jacques Verges, later said Abdallah did not plan to attend the remainder of the trial because he refuses to subject himself to French justice and objects to the U.S. government's role in 
the trial. Verges said he would con­tinue to attend. 
The case is the first to be tried in a special seven-judge "terrorism court," set up un­der laws enacted last year. 
The trial is being conducted under heavy security. Two dozen gendarmes were sta­tioned in the courtroom, which provided room for 117 jour­nalists and about 70 spectators. Dozens of armed guards were stationed outside the court­house near Notre Dame Cathe­dral in central Paris.

Refugees escape U.S. crackdown 
Associated Press 
TORONTO -More than 4,000 immigrants from El Salvador and Guatemala have found sanctuary in Canada over the past three months, taking ref­uge not from civil war and poverty at home but from a 
U.S. crackdown on illegal aliens. 
"I like it here. It's friendlier. When you arrive, they shake your hand," said 20-year-old Alfonso Amaya of San Vicente, El Salvador. 
He lived illegally in Los An­geles for four years before fleeing to Toronto with one bro­ther and two sisters. 
Alarmed that thousands more might arrive, Canada tightened its open-door policy last Friday. It said that Central Americans wanting to come to Canada must remain in the United States and apply at Canadian consulates. 
The new system is applicable to refugees from all nations. Of­ficials said it is designed to dis­tinguish between genuinely needy cases and those simply seeking a better life and a way around normal immigration procedures. 
Before, Central Americans poured across the border by bus or took low-fare flights ­dubbed the Refugee Express ­from Newark, N.J., to Buffalo, N.Y., crossing the border at Fort Erie, Ontario, or in Quebec province near Montreal. They are from all classes. Most are Salvadorans who lived for years in the south-

west United States. Most don't speak English. They applied for welfare in Canada until they can find work. 
At the Canadian National Ex­hibition grounds next to Lake Ontario, a dormitory has been turned into an emergency hos­tel for 140 men. 
"Most of our existing hostels are inundated, putting up people on the floor," said John Jagt, Toronto's director of hos­tel operations. 
The influx, described as a "panic" by a U.S. embassy spokesman in Ottawa, was prompted by signing of a tough, new U.S. immigration act last November. 
The law offers amnesty to illegal aliens who can prove residence in the United States since Jan. 1, 1982. But it threat­ens millions of others with deportation as of May 5 and punishes employers who knowingly hire them. 
"This crisis is being caused by the United States. These people are coming because they're being fired from their jobs," said Nancy Pocock of the Quaker Committee for Refugees, helping to settle the newcomers in Toronto. 
Canada, a sprawling nation of 25 million people, has wel­comed 5.5 million foreigners since World War II. 
But 1,000 people a week ar­rived to claim refugee status in the first six weeks of 1987, com­pared with 1,500 for all of 1980. A backlash developed. 
"We will keep this country open to genuine refugees. But right now we have so many abuses that the government has to move very quickly with control measures,'' said Im­migration Minister Benoit Bouchard. 
He canceled a policy that au­tomatically admitted claimants from 18 communist and war-torn countries and al­lowed them to work, and he im­posed a transit visa require­ment for 98 countries. 
Bouchard said U.S. aut­horities agreed not to deport Salvadorans or Guatemalans awaiting Canada's verdict on refugee applications. 
"Every Salvadoran fears going back," said Dora Jimenez, who left three children behind with her par­ents when she fled her country in 1985, crossed through Mexico and Texas and ended up working in a laundry in Freeport, N.Y. 
"I was caught and held by guerrillas for eight hours," she said, apparently because she had a friend who worked at civil guard headquarters. 
"The only thing I ever knew about Canada was that it's big and cold. But I feel secure and calm here because I know I won't be deported." 
She spoke at a downtown Toronto hostel where 25 new­comers are staying. 
Many immigrants arrive without cash. Volunteer groups help them until welfare checks arrive. 
Those with families are taken to motels in a temporary housing program, Jagt said. 
Associated Press ST. LOUIS -Rep. Richard 
Gephardt  of  Missouri  an­ 
nounced  his  bid  for  the  
presidency on  Monday,  ack­ 

nowledging he is unknown to most Americans but insisting that sheer effort will catapult him to the 1988 Democratic nomination. 
The moderate Democrat, ac­companied by about 20 mem­bers of Congress including House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., and House Ways and Means Com­mittee Chairman Dan Ros­tenkowski, D-Ill., opened his bid with a call "to make America first again" with a reactivated national govern­ment. 
Gephardt said his campaign will center on trade. "The first task of national leadership is to remove the barriers that limit what people themselves can do," he told hundreds of cheer­ing supporters. 
The six-term St. Louis-area congressman became the first major Democrat to officially announce for president, with several others to follow suit this spring. 
Although Gephardt has been actively campaigning for the past year in states with early primaries and caucuses, he remains low in presidential opinion polls. In Iowa, for ex­ample, the latest poll showed him a distant fourth at 3 per­cent, behind former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart with 59 percent, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo with 14 percent and the Rev. Jesse Jackson with 5 percent. 
But Cuomo took himself out of the race last week, an action that encouraged Gephardt and other lesser-knowns such as Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden, former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. 
Gephardt's strategists said they hope a strong showing in early tests like Iowa and New Hampshire will give him a boost heading into a "super Tuesday" of Southern prima­ries and caucuses in early March. 
His schedule this week reflected that strategy, taking him from St. Louis to Iowa, fol­lowed by a swing through Texas and ending the week in New Hampshire.

NEW ORLEANS) -Officials in a predominantly white sub­urb dropped their vow to rebuild barricades erected last week on two streets leading to a mostly black New Orleans neighborhood, as the two towns agreed Monday to work to reduce crime in the area. 
"It's unfortunate that the ra­cial aspect of it was interjected into the picture. It was never a consideration in Jefferson," said Robert Evans Jr., head of the Jefferson Parish Council, which ordered the barricades built. 
He and New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy met briefly Monday and then told reporters that law enforcement officials from both parishes will work together to fight the robbery and drug traffic that Evans said were his only reasons for ordering the barricades up in the first place. 
Barthelemy, who is black, earlier had said the construe­tion of the wood-and-steel bar­ricades was illegal as well as racially motivated. The bar­riers were torn down Saturday by New Orleans workers, two days after they were put up out­side the city limits. 

The barriers were dubbed "The Berlin Wall" by some blacks on the New Orleans side. Evans said the barricades were meant to cut off an escape route for criminals who had victimized the neighborhood. 
Orleans Parish Council­woman Peggy Wilson, a white Republican whose district in­cludes the neighborhood, was cheered by about 15 blacks and a few whites who were demonstrating near the site of the barricades Monday when she told them the town had backed down. 
Mrs. Wilson said she was told by Barthelemy that Evans decided not to rebuild the bar­riers after the state highway department said they were ille­gal. 
The barriers again spot­lighted a racial rift between New Orleans, with a population about 59 percent black, and Jef­ferson Parish, where 85 per­cent of the population is white. 
In December, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Harry Lee an­nounced that his deputies would routinely stop and ques­tion blacks found in predominantly white neighbor­hoods. He rescinded the order less than a day later amid a firestorm of protests, threats of a black boycott and demands that he resign. 
Jefferson Parish residents were divided on the barricades. 
"I feel that it speaks of bigotry," said Nancy Bous­field. "I'm sick of reading in the newspapers that nobody on this side cares about the bar­riers. That's not so." 
"The barricades are not going to stop crime," said Aaron Duncan, 22, another white Jefferson Parish resi­dent. "There's crime everywhere."

Third, "Scholastic is a gen­eral interestnews magazine and cannot be expected to abide by the same policies re­garding a literarytfine arts magazine such as the Juggler,'' the resolution contended. "This distinction is a crucial one," Mouasher said. 
Fourth, said the statement, "if there are 'policies' of the Student Activities Office governing editorial considera­tions of Juggler and Dome, these have never been formally presented to any member of the Scholastic staff, nor are they printed in du Lac or any other University listing of regula­tions." 
After appending an adden­dum granting approval to an "alternative proposal to set up a board of journalism experts, approved by the Office of Stu­dent Activities and Scholastic editorial board, to meet and critique issues after publica­tion,'' the senate passed the resolution without objection. 
According to a letter issued by the Office of Student Activ­ities and signed by Cassidy, the suspension of the student mag­azine occurred because its editors "printed a photograph of an artistic work .... (which) was removed from the control. Student Activities may not agree with something and may prevent certain items from appearing in print," he added. 

Cassidy said he and Ceil Paulsen, assistant student ac­tivities director for facilities and programming, entered Scholastic's office and asked for copies of the controversial issue Thursday. He said he was told they were not yet avail­able. 
Mouasher, however, said a few copies of Thursday's edi­tion were placed in the Student Activities Office that day. He said the magazine was delivered according to the nor­mal circulation schedule. 
Sunday night Cassidy gave Scholastic staff members three and a half hours to remove per­sonal belongings from the 
Fall edition of the Juggler by the Student Activities Office . . . . Since the Scholastic is un­der the same policies as_ the Juggler and operated contrary to these policies, operations of the Scholastic will be suspended immediately,'' 
Mouasher prefaced the Scholastic editors' case with a description of the suspension. "We got a period of three and a half hours in which to clear our personal belongings out of the office," he said, referring to Sunday night's action, "after which the locks were changed on our office and our operations were suspended indefinitely.'' 
Saying he did not come to debate the issue, only to clarify questions, Cassidy said that by his interpretation, the suspen­sion was in accordance with du Lac because "the director of publications is not an external accessory.'' Therefore, as a function internal to the publica­tion, the suspension was not censorship, he said. 
Scholastic News Editor Frank Lipo said the very idea of Student Activities supervi­sion was objectionable. "A 120­year-old magazine has been faced with an ultimatum: either we let the Office of Stu­dent Activites set all schedules and check all flats, or we don't." Supervision would mean Scholastic is no longer a student magazine, he said.

This year has been very difficult for me. Many of my hopes have come crashing down. Hopes for the Campus Life Council as an effective body. Hopes that the students cared just enough to insist upon honesty in their campus leaders. Hopes that the administration could make tough, yet creative, deci­sions with more in mind than avoiding fiscal minuses. Hopes to recruit thirty talented underclassmen and sell them on the benefits of getting involved.

SMC office candidates deserve class support 
Dear Editor: 

There has been quite a bit of excite­ment at Saint Mary's concerning the class election results. The first run-off for junior class offices generated much enthusiasm and class involvement, as the percentage of students voting in­creased to get the election over with. Now there is a second run-off and class members as well as candidates are on edge about the prospective outcome. 
In light of this situation, I would like to commend the two opposing junior class tickets for their endurance and persistence in what seems to be an end­less battle. I would like to stress that these candidates are not taking part in a popularity contest. The results of this election will provide next year's junior class with the most experienced and effective group of people suited to be in office. They will be chosen specifi­cally by their peers to do the best job they possibly can. I ask the junior class of Saint Mary's to vote in Tuesday's run-off election, but more importantly, weigh the consequences of your deci­sion. 
I would like to wish both the junior class tickets good luck in their cam­paign efforts. The best ticket will win, with the unending support of the junior class.

'Bustllng. busy, and full of life, the capital's street markets 
are an Integral part of the London shopping scene." So says the "Quick Guide to London." But this pointed description does not justice in explaining the Incredible spectacle that 
-

springs up on the streets of London. 
There is nothing stateside to compare them to. They are similar, at best. to flea-markets or American county fairs. They differ immensely, though, in variety, character, and Intensity. Perhaps the only way to describe them is through the eyes of a first-time market-goer. 
Although most London tourists visit the markets, city residents also make them a habit. Butchers, green grocers, and bakeries abound, allowing the city-dwellers an opportunity to make their purchases of fresh goods at great bargains. 

Lisa Young 
The London Bridge 
Saturday is the main trading day at Portbello Road, a ten minute walk from our residences. Most of the canopies are set up in front of the street's shops, with a few branching off on side streets. It is a movie-like scene with vendors crying out their wares and shoppers pausing to look at each booth. As one wanders down Portbello road, away from the central area, the quality of the good declines. Near the end of the street are racks and tables filled with second hand clothing. 
Petticoat Lane Market is open only on Sundays and is probabl London's most famous market. Similar In appearance to Portbello, the atmosphere of Petticoat Lane Is much different. The vendors here are much more vocal and eager to attract customers. 
Both markets offer an astounding variety; everything from toothpaste to fur coats, buttons to dishes, lipstick to curio cabinets. Most goods do not have marked prices. Upon Inquiry of a price, and therefore Interest In the merchandise, the vendors seem Intent on talking customers into making a purchase. This leads to one of the most Interesting aspects of marketing: bargaining. 
Bargaining. too, can best be described through experience. It Is, by nature, an uncomfortable Idea for those of us who are not used to it. University Park Mall shopping habits do not prepare one for this foreign custom. The obvious problem is the lack of experience in knowing what to say and how to act. Afraid of offending the merchant. yet attemtplng to look at ease in this bargaining role, the question of price arises. What should I offer for this 20 pound sweater? It Is also difficult to talk a vendor's price down when It Is apparent that you are much better off than he. 
Having only traveler's cheques with me, I went to a Bureau de Change at Petticoat Lane to cash them. I signed my cheques and handed them to the cashier. He was very friendly and asked what 1 was buying. I told him he replied "Bargain with them. You have cash now; you can talk the price down." 
This confirmed things I had read about markets, yet contradicted my experience of the day before. I was Interested In a Scottish Wool blanket at Portbello and tried to bargain with the man. He would take, no less than the price marked and seemed almost disgusted at my offer. He muttered that he had already sold a dozen at the marked price that day. 
Another vendor elaborated on the fact that I was an Amerl· can, therefore rich, and that he couldn't accept my bargaining offers. It was not use explaining to him that I was a student. therefore not rich, and I truly couldn't afford the price he was asking. 
After many hours of shopping and countless attempts at bargaining. I was finally sucessful. Having found the object of my marketing pursuits, I offered the merchant five pounds less than the price he was asking. He shook his head and said out loud, "No, no," but then he pulled me very close. f1e mumbled something I couldn't exactly make out. but the glst of It was 
1 

that he would accept my offer. He didn't want other customers nearby to know that he would accept less than the quoted price. 
There Is much more to the market experience: the people, the colors, the language. But these, too, are difficult to put on paper. The only way to understand a market Is to experience it.

Don't panic: Volunteer 
LISA COLEMAN features writer 

D
uring february and March as business firms continue to Interview on campus many undecided Seniors begin to panic. 
Senior Post-Graduate Coun­selor at the Center for Social Concerns Mary Ann Roemer claims that post graduate volunteer programs are fre­quently the answer for graduat­Ing students who are not quite ready to launch a lifetime career. 
These one year programs offer a variety ofjobs In many different settings. 'The pro­grams give Notre Dame graduates the chance to do good for other people and to sample job areas they may want to work In later on," says Roemer. 
There are many Seniors who are panicking unnecessarily. They have had a great start In all aspects of their education. Now some want a chance to experiment with what they have learned and who they are before committing themselves to a career. 
Holy Cross Association 
"(I want to) cnannel all the energy put Into me Into some­thing good for others before choosing a career and becom­Ing more self-oriented," says Senior Marianne Herb, an English-french double major app!ylng to the Holy Cross As­sociates. 
The Center for Social Con­cerns has Information on a variety of programs to meet the needs of all who are Inter­ested. Here are just a few that will be on campus toward the end of february and early March. 
The Holy Cross Associates Is a one-year voluteer program with an emphasis on com­munal living. Located through· out the country In Portland, Oregon, Hayward, California, Colorado Springs, and Avon· dale, Arizona, volunteers partie· lpate In areas such as teaching. 
parish ministry, alcohol abuse 
centers, and shelters for the 
needy. 
Beyond this service to the 
poor, Holy Cross Associates 
devote themselves to a year of 
simple living. In each city, they 
pool all their earnings to rent a 
house and provide meals and 
transportation economically. 
Each volunteer receives only 
$60 a month for his own per­
sonal spending money, but the 
goal Is to live without the 
luxuries of wealth or material 
goods, even travel. Volunteers 
have found that this kind of 
simple living and sharing 
within the community of the 
household help them to live 
and work on a more personal 
level with the poor. 
Jesuit Voluteer Corps 
Jesuit Volunteer Corps 
workers spend a year of service 
In legal clinics, alcohol clinics 
soup kitchens and many other 
areas of need. This program's 
emphasis Is placed on work 
although participants do live In 
community. The Jesuit Volun· 
teers live and work all over the 
country and join with other 
volunteers In their regions for 
retreats and evaluations of 
their work. 
Channel Volunteer Program 
John Reid, a Notre Dame alumnus, heads the Channel Volunteer program. The pro­gram Is based In Seattle, Wash· lngton with locations along the West Coast. Like the Jesuit program, volunteers work as teachers and assistants In legal clinics and alcohol clinics. 
Public Interest 
Re.earch Group 
Many graduates prefer a pro­
gram that offers complete em· 
ployment. The Public Interest 
Research Group pays graduates 
to research and lobby for spe· 
clal Interests. 
"Our experiences both In job 
and community, have forced us 
to question the structure of 
society from many perspec· 
tlves," says a letter Roemer 
received recently from Tim 
Buckley, a 1986 Notre Dame graduate. Buckley Is spending this year In the Jesuit Volunteer Corp as a teacher In Portland, Oregon. "Beyond the socio· political Issues we face, com· munlty living makes us exam· lne ourselves and the ways we Interact with each other." 

One year of living. working and sharing talents and values puts a finishing touch on what graduates have been learning throughout their lives. This experience often provides the time needed to make a trans· action from student to full· time, working adult. 
Seniors such as Nancy Camarote claim these pro· grams really work to their ad· vantage. Camarote has applied to become a Holy Cross Associ· ate this year. She would like to volunteer as a teacher and hopes to receive a permanent position upon leaving the pro­gram. "(It's a) really good chance to grow and to see a different part of life by experl· enclng hardship," she says. "''ve been fortunate and gained a lot and want to give some of what I've been given back to others." 
Giving. sharing and growing are what these programs are about. Although work is often difficult participants appear to get out of each activity twice as much as they put ln. 
Roemer hopes that through these groups students will take advantage of the Christian values and commltmentsf that began In their families and have been nurtured through Notre Dame. 
"I was able to grow and to look beyond myself Into the hearts of others," says Patty Clsle, a 1985 Notre Dame graduate seems to sum up everyones feelings In her recent guest oolumn In VIew­point. "I was able to rebuild, to gain a strength and to better understand my Christian faith. I found out I have a long way to go but fortunately through my HCA experience, I learned to open myself up and leave room within for growth."

This drink almost stole the show in "Trad­ingPlaces,"butthecampusdininghallsstillrefuse to serve it for lunch and dinner. Or­ange juice must be too expensive for them 
to pay heed to Anita Bryant's slogans. Alex . VonderHaar 

or­ange ate has become saturated from oversupply. Students who have read about the four freezes in Florida over the past six years are probably wondering how this could have happened. Apparently, or­ange juice isn't just from Florida anymore. 
The extra production has come from Brazil, and one entrepreneur stood out from the pack, according to The Wall Street Jour­nal. Back in December of 1962, the Sunshine State lost millions of orange trees in a bitter frost. Jose Cutrale, Jr., then a struggling or­ange salesman in Sao Paulo, noticed an op­portunity to supply the lost juice. 
His company, Sucucitrico Cutrale, now owns 6.7 million orange trees. Cutrale's for­mula for success is "never take a holiday. Work for quality, quantity and competitive price." 
While Florida farmers resent his competi­tion, other Americans have been happy to help the Brazilian. Coca-Cola helped launch Cutrale's business, and now Coke buys all its Brazilian juice from him. American bank­ers, concerned about the nation's ability to repay its debt, love the boost that the crop gives to Brazil's export earnings. 
Brazil is now the world leader in the pro­duction of oranges. In 1986, the tropical na­of $100. The second prize of $50 and a $25 third prize will also be awarded. No specific leaders of the game can be de­termined until the game is of­ficially over and the portfolios are liquidated. 

"There are approximately 75 students participating in the game," according to Vizzini. 
The software package that was donated by a well-known brokerage firm and being used for the first time "has helped considerably in maintaining the smooth runnning of the game as well as saved the com­mittee time in comparison to previous years," said Vizzini. 
Last year's winner, Tom Meagher, said he qualified for the $100 prize by earning a 
tion made over 200 million 90-pound boxes, 
twice the output of Florida. Brazil trailed their American counterparts as recently as 1981. 
~utrale'~ product .s~ows up in cartons of Mmute Maid orange JUice. This arrangement is great for Coke because of the fickleness of the Florida crop. Sam Ayoub, a former Coke finance director, maintains that "Coke will never let him down because he has nerer 
failed to produce the goods." 
Since Minute Maid controls over a fifth of the $3.3 million U.S. market, most juice
drinkers here can thank Cutrale for satisfy­ing B:t least some of t~eir thirst. 
This great production, however, has had its drawbacks. Because the demand grew so rapidly over the last 20 years, farmers throughout the world planted more trees than today's slowly growing market can use. Even Jose Cutrale is feeling the squeeze from in­creased competition. 
But like any great businessman, he has exploited the tools at his disposal. He has been using government subsidies, cheap labor, and concessions from his suppliers to further his domination. For example, in addition to growing his own, Cutrale buys oranges from small farmers. The price he pays per box (90 pounds) has fallen to $1, down from $3.50 two years ago. 
American consumers have yet not reaped the full benefit of lower prices. Aldi's and Kroger's still charge 99 cents for half gallons of generic orange juice while the Huddle commands almost two bucks for the real Minute Maid. 
Wherever you buy your citrus, remember that much of it is coming from Brazil. Despite the glut, Cutrale remains confident: "I'm happy because I have more orange trees than anyone else in the world." 
return of 55 percent on his in­vestment. Last year's contest gave players $10,000 to start with and only one week to play the game. Players could trade as often as they wished at a table manned by the Finance Club during trading hours. Results were based on the ac­tual performance of corres­ponding stocks in the real stock exchange. 
Vizzini said this year's game "provided a great opportunity to learn about various types of investments as well as gain hands-on experience and a knowledge of how the stock market works at no risk to the student," said Vizzini. 
The game, which began Nov. 17, was open to all Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students.

Ski teams take sixth in Midwest Regionals 
Ending its season at the Midwest Regionals near Duluth, Minn., last weekend, the men's and wo­men's Ski Teams bOth placed sixth in their respec­tive brackets. 
Pat Eilers was the top finisher for the men's team, placing among the top fifteen in the giant slalom. Eric Kowalski, Joe Bride and Jeff Parker also turned in solid performances for the Irish. 
The Skendzel sisters, Kathy and Mary Beth, who had led the women's team for most of the season, continued to do the same thing at the regionals. Kathy Skendzel placed fourth in the giant slalom and seventh in the slalom, while Mary Beth Skendzel finished fifteenth in the giant slalom. Jane Heisel was another key contributor for the women's team. 
Neither team was able to qualify for nationals, as only the top three teams were able to advance. The men's team reached the regionals by placing third at the qualifiers, while the women's team received an at-large bid to the regionals. 
"I thought we skied pretty strongly. There were about fourteen or fifteen tough teams out there," said Kathy Skendzel. "We didn't qualify for nation­als, but we did very well overall." 

In last Friday's Indiana Intercollegiates at In­diana University, sophomore Theresa Rice of the Women's Track <!:Iub finished fourth in the 1000-yard run with a time of 2:41. 
Two of the runners ahead of Rice had NCAA­qualifying times, and Rice's time was about eight seconds off the NCAA pace. 

Steve Megargee 
Club Corner 
"She was the first underclassman to finish. It was outstanding," said Head Coach Dan Ryan. "She's beginning to blossom as one of the top middle dis­tance runners in Indiana. She's capable of winning anything between 800 and 1500." 
Notre Dame's will host the Notre Dame Invita­tional in the ACC North Dome this Saturday at 3 
p.m. The meet will include teams from Marquette, 
DePaul, Detroit, and Notre Dame. "We should do fairly well. Both DePaul and Mar­quette are very, very strong, and they'll be the favorites. It should be a very good meet," said Ryan. "We have some individuals who will do well. Theresa Rice should be in the hunt to win the 800, and Darlene Martin should do well in the sprinting events and shot put. We should do well in the shot put in general." 
The Men's Volleyball Club was brought back down to earth last Monday. Ball State, a varsity team ranked eighth in the nation, swept the Irish in three games. 
Notre Dame bounced back the next night to defeat Calvin College in four games, raising its record to 12-2. 
"The Ball State match was just ridiculous," said Club Secretary Steve Kranz. "They were a real strong team, and we just didn't show up. We couldn't do the basics right, and we got into all kinds of trouble. 
"We were ready to beat up on somebody, and we came back and played well (against Calvin). We jumped out to a big lead in the first game, and slacked off and lost it. Then we kind of took them apart in the next three games." 
Making a swing through Ohio this week, the Irish play at Ohio State on Thursday, at Ohio State­Marion on Friday, and at Miami (Ohio) on Satur­day. 

NDtennis drops two over weekend 
By SHEILA HOROX Sports Writer 
Until a youthful Irish wo­men's tennis squad gains expe­rience, it will have to take its bumps and bruises along the way as they did against Wis­conson and Western Michigan this weekend. 
Wisconson, a team ranked in the nation's Top 30, swept the Irish, 9-0, on Friday. Head Coach Michele Gelfman was not disappointed, however, in the team's performance. 
"Our kids played their hearts out this weekend," said Gelfman. "Wisconson had an extremely tough line-up, and we simply got beat by a better team." 
In the Western Michigan match, the score was tied at the end of the singles competi­tion, 3-3, but the Irish doubles teams dropped the remaining matches, resulting in a 6-3loss. 
Alice Lohrer, Natalie Illig, and Julie Sullivan registered the Irish singles victories. Loh­rer and Illig both pulled out close three-set matches, Loh­rer by defeating Mindy Severt 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, and Illig by defeat­ing Sonya Garshrek, 3-6, 6-4, 6­
1. Sullivan then took care of Karen Goldstein,7-5,6-3. 
In the three Irish singles losses, Stephanie Tolstedt came up short against Marla Whitfield, 7-5, 6-0, Tammy Schmidt lost a tough three set­ter to Jan Weigard, 6-7 (2-7 tie­breaker), 6-3, 6-4, and Resa Kelly fell 6-1, 6-4 to Sheri Birndorf. 
Notre Dame was without the services of number-one singles and doubles player Michelle Dasso, and according to Gelfman, her abscence put the Irish at a disadvantage. 
"Michelle's not being there really hurt us, especially against Western Michigan," said Gelfman. "With her I felt we could have won one or two more singles matches and it would have definitely affected our doubles teams." 
Gelfman has yet to play a match with her full starting line-up in tact.

the freshmen and sophmores. My responsibility is to play hard so that they will play hard. 
"And I think that the biggest help is Coach has confidence in my ability to lead the other players. It has given me a lot of confidence to know that she's behind me, in my corner." 
The career records do not mean much to Gavin, whose love of the game, unselfishness and competitive will to win are apparent. 
"It shows that I would rather pass than shoot the ball," she says. "To me, a good pass is just as good as two points. Ac­tually, I would rather have a nice pass than a jump shot. 
"I think the way the offense is set up is to have me pass the ball. That's probably why I was recruited, so that's the way (DiStanislao) set it up. In pre­vious years with Trena Keys, it was my job just to get her the ball. 
"I know that I should shoot the ball more, but being here the first two years and being told to pass, pass, pass, and coming in my third year and being told to shoot was an ad­justment that I haven't made that well yet. But I have put it up more this year." 
Aside from her offensive skills, Gavin is extremely quick and tenacious on defense according to DiStanislao. 
"I never really thought I had as many steals as I do," says Gavin. "I have to give credit to Diondra because I know if I go out on a limb and miss the steal, she is always going to be there to back me up. It is im­portant to know in the back of my head that I can go out and take chances to get the ball. 
"I try to cut off passing lanes. I am not a quick person, but I have quick hands." 
At the beginning of the season, Gavin looked forward to the challenge of playing Rut­gers and other Top 10 teams in the nation. But as the season wore on, so did the excitement of a difficult schedule. "I guess you have to play Top 20 teams to be recognized as a good team when you are sup­posed to have a good year," she says, "but that can be tough. It could have really been a dif­ferent story. 
"The freshmen have gotten so much experience that next year they will be better prepared for situations. With three seniors on the team, we will have a lot of experience. 
"We have to gain confidence in each other, which we are starting to do now. That mat­ters a lot. First, it has to start with yourself, you have to have confidence in yourself.'' 
Off the court, the sacrifices 
of a Divison I player are de­
manding but well worth it all 
to Gavin. 
"It definitely cuts down on 
my social life because the 
season starts in September and 
ends in March. It's hard to go 
out and get ripped every 
weekend when you know that 
you have to get up Sunday mor­
ning and go to practice, and I 
mean practice hard. 
"Academically, it hurts 
when you are travelling. It is 
difficult to get anything done 
on the road, reading on a bus 
gives me a headache. 
"It (basketball) is definitely 
worth it. Itis something I would

the playoffs get into full swing this week. Several key games are slated for tonight in both the A and B leagues. 
In the A-league, top-ranked Stanford and No. 2 Morrissey will clash at 8 p.m. (ACC Gym 2). The winner of this game clinches a spot in the A-league championship, which will be played at 6 p.m. on Thursday, March 3 in the ACC Pit. The loser enters the losers' bracket of the double-elimination tournament. 
Stanford (7-0, Big Sky Divi­sion Champs) and Morrissey (6-0, ACC Division Champs) drew first-round byes last week, while defending cham­pion Sorin (6-0, Big Ten Champs) defeated Dillon (4-2), 47-45, and Holy Cross (5-1) nipped St. Ed's (5-2), 45-43. 
On Sunday, Stanford downed Holy Cross, 63-55, and Morris­sey held on for a 41-35 victory over Sorin, setting up tonight's matchup. 
"This game will not be any different from any other game this season," said Morrissey coach Pete Kolettis. "Defense and rebounding are the things we do best and that's how we've won. And we can use ten people. I don't know if the other teams are as deep." 
In the losers' bracket, Dillon handed St. Ed's an early exit, 61-56, while Sorin and Holy Cross square off tonight at 7 (ACC, ct. 2) for the right to play Dillon on Thursday. The win­ner of Thursday's contest will battle the Morrissey-Stanford loser next Tuesday. The winner of that game will meet the Morrissey-Stanford winner for the A-league championship. 
In the winners' bracket of the 
B-league, only one game is 
scheduled tonight. Keenan (5­
1) will face the winner of last night's Grace-Dillon contest, with the winner advancing to a matchup with undefeated Sorin (6-0, Major Independents Champs). 

Sorin is 2-0 in the B-league playoffs, defeating Howard (4­2), 53-47, last week, and trip­ping Off Campus (5-l), 46-32, on Sunday. 
In other B-league action last week, Off Campus ripped Stan­ford (5-1), 72-47, Keenan trounced previously-unbeaten Cavanaugh (6-0, ECAC Champs), 62-40, and Grace (4­
2) edged into the final playoff spot by downing the Off Campus Hoobers (3-3), 50-42. 
"There are a lot of good teams out there this year,'' said Dillon B coach Charlie Elliott. "We've had some close games. I think we can play with anyone if we can continue to control the boards and our outside shooting (led by Mike and Bobby Raster) remains consis­
tent." , In the B-league losers bracket, Howard and Stanfo~d meet tonight, as will Cavanaugh am} the Grace­

Hand1cappe wrest1ers fall to IU, 41-9 
By STEVE 
MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
Before Sunday's dual meet with Indiana started, it was announced that Irish coach Fran McCann was being inducted into the In­diana High School Wrestling Coaches Association Hall of Fame. It was about the only good news the Notre Dame wrestling team received all afternoon. 
Indiana took advantage of three Notre Dame forfeits, two pins, one superior deci­sion, and a major decision to coast past the Irish, 41-9. The loss in Notre Dame's last home meet of the season dropped the team's dual meet record to 1-11. 
"We could have won more matches than we did, but we're not upset with the desire our guys have," said Assistant Coach Ricky Stewart. "It's kind of dis­couraging when you get out­manned." 

Senior Dave Helmer, in his last home match for the Irish, won on a major deci­sion, and 134-pound soph­homore Jerry Durso was the only other Notre Dame win­ner. Sophomore 126-pound Dave Carlin pulled out a draw in his match. 
"He (Helmer) wrestled well," said Stewart. "He hasn't done the things on the mat that he does in practice. Once he gets some confi­dence, he wrestles well." 
Notre Dame expected to forfeit the 142-pound match and the 190-pound match be­cause of injuries to Pat Boyd and Tom Ryan. The Irish ended up also having to for­feit the 167-pound match when Chris Geneser was forced to miss yesterday's meet. Geneser had a recur­rence of a knee injury that kept him sidelined earlier in the season.

the overall play of his squad, but feels the luck of the Irish just skipped past his team's doer. 
"It certainly wasn't all luck," said Smith. "I mean, we put 46 shots on goal, two of them directed at an open net, and we still only got three goals out of it, which just isn't enough. But one of (Lake For­est's) goals bounced in off of one of our defensemen's skates and another one was knocked in by a falling player after our goalie made a nice save. 
"Position-wise, we might have played the best series of hockey that we've had in the last two months, but we just keep looking up at that big black cloud over our heads."
