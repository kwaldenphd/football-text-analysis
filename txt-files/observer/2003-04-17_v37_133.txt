NDSP, 
jumped the fence, entered the Stadium and ran towards the field, according tu a St. Joseph County Police report. 
NDSP did not release the names of the other two sus­pects. Phil Johnson, assistant director of NDSP, said no arrnsl,; were made in the inci­dent but addnd that the sus­pect<; were handcu!fod for olli­cer sa!'ety. 
"!The officers were! investi­gating a serious incident," Johnson said. "It's not uncom­mon to secure pt)ople until you can lake control of tho situa­tion." 
Johnson said no one was injurnd in the incident and he 
was unaware of any damage or vandalism inside Lhe Stadium. 
After NDSP discovered the students had illegally enternd the Stadium, a county police K­9 unit was brought into assist in the apprehension of the bur­glary suspects -a practice Johnson called standard when a large area needs to be searched. 
According to the county police report, county officer Mike Banicki found Englehardt and Parziale hiding behind an ice 
machine in the north­eac;t section of the Stadium and arrest­ed the pair without incident. Meanwhile, the police 
report said NDSP officer Paul Becker spotted a third suspect who jumped from the 2nd floor of'the north wall ofthe Stadium. Officers chased the suspect and lost him. 
It was not immediately clear how the fourth suspect left the Stadium. But Johnson said the two suspects, who were not caught in the Stadium, were later identified through an NDSP investigation. 
Johnson said NDSP had for­warded the to the Office of Residence Life, adding that the case will not be referred to the St. Joseph County Prosecutor's otlice.

SMC n1ay punish for illegal n1usic downloads 
By NATALIE BAILEY 
Assistant Saine Mary's Editor 
Saint Mary's students may face disciplinary action from the College as well as the Recording Industry of America as a result of illegal MP3 downloading, according to College officials. 
Awareness of the illegal activity came from several cease-and-desist letters from the RIAA that said multiple Saint Mary's students were illegally downloading or shar­ing MP3s. Students became aware of the action in an April 10 letter from Keith Fowlkes, director of Information Technology. 
The letter stated that "the College is required to contact the students that are offering copyrighted sound recordings for download, notify the stu­dents of the legal order, con­firm that the students have ceased sharing copyrighted nies, and report back to the 
RIAA that the students are 
now in compliance with the 
RIAA's request." 
Kathy Hausmann, coordi­nator of Student Computing, posted a letter to the student body on the HcsNet Web page that concerns multiple stu­dents offering copyrighted sound recordings for down­load through applications like KaZaA, Morpheus. WinMX, AudioGalaxy, iMesh and Gnutella. 
"So far, students the HIM contacted Saint Mary's about have as few as 202 songs available for download and as many as 976," Hausmann said. 
According to Hausmann, the HIAA cited multiple IP addresses. All students the technology department has met with so far have been using KaZaA. 
The letter also warned stu­d ents using their network

What's your

passion? 
With Holy Week in full swing and the Passion story of Jesus echoing through churches across the world, I cannot help but reflect on the word "passion." 
What is pas­

tions. which also makes everyday events meaningful and worthwhile. Passion fuels our thoughts, actions and deepest desires. Without passion, what is left in the world? 
I imagine a world devoid of laugh­ter and happiness. A world without music and art. A world lacking every­thing creative and unique. A world missing any reason to live. 
So what then, makes me passion­ate? I'm passionate about people, both my friends and the people I never have a chance to meet. The massive collage of pictures on my dorm room wall testifies to this love. 
Music. I listen to music most wak­ing hours of my day. I'm addicted to buying CDs, l celebrate when my favorite bands release new albums and I'm always up for new music. 
Three words: Atlanta Braves base­ball. They have and always will be my team, so don't tell me how bad they are currently playing. I already know and I simply don't care. Yes, I do hate the Mets and the Yankees. 
I love computers. especially Web design. My computer dominates most of my free time. I am the proud owner of a dotcom address and unde­niably a geek. I've accepted and embraced my geekdom and even shared my skills with folks who wish they were as "cool" as me. 
James Bond films -in particular. when Sean Connery plays 007. British accents are the best and coupled with cheesy (Provolone or Swiss?), sleazy Bond girl names and high tech gad­gets and gizmos -not to mention beautiful cars -that make you wish you were a spy: who can't love 007? 
On a more serious note, my biggest passion is my faith -my Catholic faith. After all, it is the reason I left the amazing South for South Bend. No wait, scratch that, it was the awe­some Indiana weather. My faith is the reason I wake up and live my day. It is the source of all that I do or don't do. And if my passion for my faith isn't enough, then my passion for youth ministry certainly should be. After I graduate in 2006, I hope to be a youth minister for a dynamic Catholic high school youth program called Life Teen. 
Yes, I actually want to hang out with high schoolers. They are awe­some people with a lot to offer. I want to explore the wonders of God with them, while undoubtedly causing a little, okay a lot, of trouble along the way. 
I believe passion is a necessity of human life. It fuels my life. 
It is on that note then, that I ask you this: what are you passionate about?

To honor the memory or frnshman Chad Sharon. llrn Univ1irsity has helped to orga­nize the Chad Sharon Memorial Fund which aims to provide partial support f'or a Notre I>,unc undergraduate student. 
"I lalhd with the Sharons last wnPk. The hope is that we can 111ake it an nndow1id schol­arship," said Bill Kirk. assistant d iriictor of' StudPnt /\flairs. 
Kirk said that dnpnnding on how mud1 thn scholarship fund raises. it would nither support an nndowed scholarship or provide a set amount of funds to a specific number of North Damn students. 
Throughout tlw process, olli­cials have worked closely with St1vn and .lane Sharon, Chad Sharon's parents. in making plans for the memorial fund. Whik exact plans for the f'unrl are still being worked out. the University has received about $20,000 for the fund so far, said Kirk. 
t\s part of an effort to support thr memorial fund, the Computer Science Club raised funds lor tlm memorial at their yearly spring computer pro­gramming contest, said Joe Lammcrsfold, one of the event's organizers. Because Sharon was a member of' the club and had a strong interest in com­puLcrs, the club wanted to sup­port the fund.

The Student Senate unani­mously approved "Student Leadership" as the topic for for­mer Student Body President Libby Bishop's May report to the Board of Trustees. 
"This report will give an update on hall dances this semester [as requested by the Boartll, offer iin in-depth analy­sis ol' the structure and workings of' t.he Student Union and detail the findings of thf> Leadership taskforce of Campus Life Council," Bishop wrote in her let­ter to the Sfmate presenting her topic. She was unable to attend the Senate meeting in person. 
Senators also asked what information would be included in the report regarding in-hall dances. Jeremy Lao, student body vice president, said that Bishop would focus on statistical information. such as how many dances were held outside dorms, in other on-campus buildings or off-campus locations. 
The report will also include a list of problems residence halls faced this year because of the new dance policy, such as the lack of locations and insufficient funds. 
Senators expressed concern about whether or not they would know the contents of the report in advance. Because of this, Lao plans to ask Bishop to attend next week's meeting to answer senators' questions and present the information in her report.

OIT implements ~wireless network 
By MATT BRAMANTI 
News Writer 

In response to new develop­ments in technology, Notre Dame's Office of Information Technologies has been installing wireless networking across campus over the past couple of years. 
The wireless fidelity system, abbreviated as "Wi-Fi," uses radio waves to establish net­work connections without users having to plug their computers into a wall jack. 
Dewitt Latimer, chief technol­ogy officer. said that "Wi-Fi" ­or wireless fidelity-allows areas on campus to be net­worked quickly and cost-effec­tively. 
"It's definitely not expensive," 1.aitmer said. "It's one of those high-yield investments." 
Latimer said that the net­working initiative has been tar­geted at high-traffic areas on campus, including the llesburgh Library, Heckers and Lafortune, which offer connec­tions to hundreds of users simultaneously. 
"We're hitiing those areas that give us the biggest bang for the buck," he said. 
Latimer said that some acad­emic buildings have wireless access. including sections of' the Mendoza College of Business, Riley (fall. Fitzpatrick and Cushing Halls and the Law School. 
He said that OIT has been working in close consultation with University deans to plan further expansion. 
"Deans can come to OJT and recommend areas [to install wireless]," Latimer said. "They know their buildings better than we do, and they know where people congregate." 
However, the deans have had some reservations about the wireless system. "There are concerns among faculty mem­bers that wireless could be a distraction," Klimek said. "We're being very sensitive to the faculty's thoughlc;." 
Despite those concerns, OlT is continuing to expand the wire­less system. Tom Klimek, man­ager of network services for OIT, said that about 80 access points or "hot spots" are cur­rently in place, with another 100 planned for deployment this summer. Each hot spot can accommodate about 25-40 users within about 300 feet of the antenna, Klimek said. 
He added that the expansion of the wireless system is intend­ed to extend coverage over a wider physical area, not just to increase capacity. "We haven't run into capacity issues," he said. 
Latimer said that Off is working quickly to increase the network's coverage area and projects that some 250 acr.Ass points will be installed every semester. "That's about how many our staff can put in," he said. 
Latimer also addresser! con­cerns that wireless networks do not provide an adequate level of security for potfmtially sensi­tive data. lie admitted that wireless syst,ms are suscepti­ble to ha<.;king. but said that OIT has been working to pro­tect users· privacy and security 
"We're treating the wired and wireless infrastructure the same, as insecure," he said. "We usr, frncryption with any application that may transmit sensitive data." 
Ile also said that the OIT edu­catcs users on the system's benefits and drawbacks. ··we want to have ;L resource that helµs the user understand what wireless can and can't do," Latimer said.

ENGLAND 
WHO scientists confirtn virus as the cause of SARS 
Associated Press 
LONDON 

Exp<'l"imcnts in monkeys have con­lirmPd tlrn identity of the virus that caus­t~s sevnrn acutfl respiratory syndrome, the World Ilealth Organization announced Wt>drwsday, an important step toward dnveloping nnw drugs to combat the dis­ease. 
It will also help scientists trace the evo­lution of' thP virus and could help them dnterminn whether it jumpPd from ani­mals to humans. and if so. from which animals. TesL'i am under way in pigs and poultry to see how susceptible those ani­mals are to SARS. 
SARS, which emerged in China in November, has sickened 3,293 people in 22 countries and killed 161. 
Scientists have now determined it is caused by a new member of the coron­avirus family, so named because a crown shape is seen when the viruses are inspected under a microscope. 
Scientists had been almost certain the new form of coronavirus first isolated from sick patients March 21 by the University of I long Kong was the cause of SARS. But they could not say for sure until they had satistied what is known as Koch's postulates -four scientific tests that verify whether a virus causes a cer­tain disease. 

"The Koch's postulates have been ful­filled, so we can now say for certain that the new coronavirus is the cause of SARS," said Dr. Klaus Stohr, a World Health Organization virologist who is coordinating the scientists' work. 
The first test requires that the virus be found in all the sick people, but not in healthy people. The second isolates the virus from a sick patient and shows that it multiplies in a lab dish. 
The third step uses the virus from the petri dish to make a lab animal sick with the same disease as that seen in humans. The final step requires isolating the S!\HS virus from the sick lab animal and show­ing it can grow in a petri dish. 
A team led by Dr. Albert Osterhaus, the director of virology at Erasmus Medical Centre in Hotterdam, Netherlands, car­ried out the final two verifying steps. 
Early in the hunt for the cause of SARS, scientists found a virus belonging to the pararnyxovirus family in some patients. It was later determined tlfat this was the human metapneumovirus, which is known to cause respiratory problems in children, the elderly and people with weak immune systems.

HOTC graduates and recog­
nized Dustin Ferrell, a 2000 
graduate serving in the 
Marine Corps, who was 
wounded in Iraq when his 
unit was ambushed by Iraqi 
forces. 
Ferrell was awarded the 
Purple Heart, ihe nation's 
oldest military decoration. 
At the Pass in Review. the 
cadets assembled in ranks in 
full dress uniforms by the 
branch of the military they 
were a part of. 
An honor guard led the 
parade, followed by the 
units' leaders who carried 
the American flag, Notre 
Dame flag and flags of the 
military branches and the 
ROTC battalions. The ROTC 
students then saluted Malloy 
as they marched past him. 
The Great Lakes Navy 
Band played the military 
branches' respective march­
es and finished the ceremo­
ny by playing the Notre 
Dame Victory March, as the 
cadets retreated in forma­
tion. 
Cadets said they appreci­
ate the opportunity the 
review provides to show off 
their military professional­
ism to their civilian superi­
ors. 
"It's the culmination of a 
great semester and an honor 
to have Father Malloy here," 
said Air Force cadet Mary 
Ann Mazzarini. 
"It's a celebration of the 
accomplishments everyone's 
done throughout the year," 
Army cadet Brooks Hartnett 
said. 
Father Peter Rocca, one of 
the ROTC chaplains who 
attended the event, praised 
the cadets' work as "recom­
mitm en t to serving their 
country in the best way pos­
sible." 
Nine members of Pax Christi protested the Pass in Review. Mike Griffin. Moreau seminarian and a member of Pax Christi and the Catholic Peace Fellowship, criticized the presence of ROTC at Notre Dame. 
"The question at Notre Dame is who's in charge of the ROTC -the Church or the Pentagon?" Griffin said. "At a Catholic school, the church, not the Pentagon, ought to be iin charge of what students earn." 
Sheila Payne, a Pax Christi member, also explained the group's presence at the review. 
"Pacifism is not passive," she said. "We don't believe nothing should be done, we just believe war should not be done." 
Tom Peeney, president of Pax Christi, called for an end to the ROTC program at Notre Dame. 
"We feel that ROTC doesn't have a place on this cam­pus," he said, adding. "We're incremental about these things." 
Army Master Sgt. Scott Shippy responded to Pax Christi's statements, saying, "If that's their belief and their opinion, they're enti­tled to that. No serviceman wants to see war, but if it comes to that everyone should be behind the troops. They should be praying for the servicemen."

access to share unauthorized 
distribution of copyrighted 
materials that they are at risk 
of being sued for copyright 
infringement. 
"The problem is significant enough that the RlAA is ask­ing $150,000 in damages per illegally downloaded copy­righted song across the board," Hausmann said. 
While officials said this activity does not come as a surprise to IT, it cannot track students in violation of the Saint Mary's network usage policy. 
However, the HIAA can track any download to an IP address and then report the address to the college net­work it operates under. IT can then trace the IP address to an individual and take action accordingly. 
While the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act does not allow the College to release names without a court order. stu­dents acting illegally can be contacted by IT. 
IT policy involves disabling the network connection in violation and notifying the student through e-mail. The student then must attend a meeting with the the Network and System Administrator, Hausmann and Fowlkes. Once all illegal sound files are removed or disabled from the student's computer, the IT will contact the RIAA and restore the student's network access. 
The RIAA has said is work­ing under the precedent set by Napster, a file sharing and downloading system that was forced to shutdowrt. 
According to the RIAA's Web site, the No Electronic Theft Law sets forth that sound recording infringe­ments (including by digital means) can be criminally prosecuted even where no monetary profit or commer­cial gain is derived from the infringing activity. 
Punishment in such instances includes up to three years in prison and/or $250,000 fines. The NET Act also extends the criminal statute of limitations for copy­right infringement from 3 to 5 years. 
. Additionally, the NET Act amended the definition of "commercial advantage or private financial gain" to include the receipt (or expec­tation of receipt) of anything of value, including receipt of other copyrighted works (as in MP3 trading). Punishment in such instances includes up to 5 years in prison and/or $250,000 fines. Individuals may also be civilly liable, regardless of whether the activity is for profit, for actual damages or lost profits. or for statutory damages up to $150,000 per work infringed, the minimum penalty is $750 per song. So far, the RIAA has sued Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Princeton University and Michigan Technological University, who have students operating Napster-like sys­tems on their networks. The RIAA also sent letters to col­leges and universities warn­ing them to halt smaller-scale activity under their networks. Hausmann said the RIAA is most likely targeting college and university networks because students are always signed on to the network, making them easier to track, 'and the connections tend to be faster, making download­ing and file sharing from these servers easier.

While students are required to agree to the Acceptable Use Policy which includes a statement prohibiting the use of applications such as Napster, Gnutella, iMesh and others designed for down­loading and sharing multime­dia files, Hausmann said many students are often caught surprised and remorseful by the conse­quences of their actions. 
"This is an education issue. People don't know that there is something wrong with doing this and we need to let them know," Hausmann said. 
Saint Mary's junior Erin McGinty was alarmed by the e-mail. 
"The prospect of being sued makes you really nervous," McGinty said. "I can sec the RIAA taking measures to pre­vent individuals from down­loading and sharing files, but they need to focus on future prevention, not on punish­ment of past actions. Downloading is so easy to do and I think most of the time students don't think that what they are doing is illegal."

Laurie Muller, associate director of' Residence Llfe and Housing, said once HesLifc receives the case it will be reviewed and a decision will be made whether a confer­ence or a disciplinary hearing is necessary. A disciplinary hearing is generally used for more serious circumstances. 
Muller said the punishmnnt for trespassing in the Stadium included a wide range of' possibilities and depends on the circum­stances and whether the sus­pects had previous ResLife records. 
Johnson said trespassing offenses in the Stadium were not common, but added that they do occur on occasion.

PJitorial
"selection" committee supposedly responsible for picking the man in btrccn wanted John Bisanz and Mike Macaluso to figure out who was going to be standing on the Notre Dame Stadium turf on Saturdays this fall. 
Following the rigorous tryout process, Macaluso, the current varsity lep­rechaun, and Bisanz, the current Olympic leprechaun, learned the results of the point system used to evaluate lep­rechaun candidates. The margin, accord­ing to the cheerleacling coach, wasn't close -Macaluso had won easily. 
But the committee, because both men are seniors and because Bisanz could sents its very essence. 

Yet had Bisanz and Macaluso decided to split mascot duties, that single identifiable face would have been split in two. 
That prompts questions like who would have played the role of the leprechaun on SportsCenter spots? Or at the pep rally before the biggest game of the sea­son? Or stood on tho sidelines al a bowl game or an NCAA Tournament site? 
Because the selection committee didn't decide, Macaluso and Bisanz had to. And because Macaluso had the job a year before and had left tryouts as the leader, he got the job. 
One might also question how much impact a tryout could have when there was a full year of games available for evaluation. Macaluso, for example, was often booed when he walked on the court and even dodged bouncy-balls students sent his way at one of the last football pep ra!Hes of the season. Bisanz, mean­while, had raw emotion that energized sparse crowds at some of the lowest­attended sporting events and didn't need T-shirts to get fans on their feet. 
Irish fans may blast Macaluso for lack­ing the energy of previous leprechauns. They should criticize the selection process that gave Macaluso a second straight year as the varsity leprechaun. 
Macaluso and Bisanz shouldn't have had to work out some arrangement that would determine who was going to serve as Notre Dame's mascot. N'ter all, the NCAA never gave the Irish a shot to play in the Final Four because. it took pity on senior Matt Carroll. 
If the committee truly believed Macaluso was the best candidate, they should have made it clear without leav­ing any room for discussion. But when the selection committee couldn't make a choice, they erred by giving the pair the choice. 
15 things I hate about Notre Dame

I've been thinking a lot about what to say in my final column. I've decided that, rather than blather

Here We Go
talk a bit about the things I am not Again going to miss. So I present here, for your edification, my top 15 list of things I am not going to miss about Notre Dame. 
1) December. 
2) Each and every member of the Notre Dame Security/Police, particularly the ones that are mean to me when I try to get on campus. 
3) The nine hundred handicapped spots in the JACC parking lot. You'd think that we have frequent wheelchair conventions over there with the sheer number of handicap spots. 
4) January. 
5) The brother-sister McFadden news anchor team on Channel 16. 
6) Meeting people who pronounce my home state as "Or-e-GONE." Particularly the people who then argue with me when I tell them how it is actually pronounced. 
7) February. 
8) Local commercials. The South Bend area has definitely spawned the worst commercials I have ever seen. The 1-800­Safe-Auto commercials spring to mind. 
9) The geese and swans on the lakes. I am terrified of all birds larger than ducks. Ijust don't feel that birds should be that large. I also don't feel that they should have that large of beaks. 
10) March. 

11) Good-hearted people who write me serious responses to facetious columns. Allow me to take this moment to clarify ­at least 65 percent of what I've written in these pages has been sarcastic. (I'll give you a hint -I'm not even being serious right now) I appreciate people's willing­ness to let me know what they think, but it's sort of depressing to receive e-mails from people that utterly miss the point. 
12) Speaking of people who miss the point -I won't miss my parents' weekly responses to my columns either, which more often than not involve the words "Honey, I guess I just didn't get it." 
13) That time after Easter every year when it snows. 
14) The fact that the humidity is fre­quently higher than the temperature in August. 
15) Hesburgh library. There is some­thing about Hesburgh that sucks all the moisture out ofme. Every time I go the library to do research, after about ten minutes oflooking for journals, I am tired, confused, frequently hungry and always thirsty in a way that no amount of drinking fountain water can solve. The only way to solve the problem is to leave Hesburgh, at which point I magically become hydrated again. 
I've been trying to come up with some parting advice for everyone. So far the best advice I can come up with is that if you're not terribly happy on campus, try moving off. It's the best thing I ever did. 
I don't want to give the sappy, high­school yearbook advice about treasuring every moment and loving it all. I think lhat if we all took the time to appreciate every moment of our collegiate time, we'd probably get about half as much done as we do. The rest of our time would have to be spent appreciating. 
So here are my four pieces of advice. 
1) Be nice to the people who work in the dining hall, especially the students. After all, they handle your food before you see it. 
2) Do things that make you happy. Try to avoid things that do not make you happy. 
3) Don't be afraid to admit that some­times Notre Dame does not make you happy. 
If you arc a gung-ho Notre Dame per­son, that's great. But ifyou aren't, remember that it's okay not to be. Notre Dame isn't the real world and when you get to the real world, you'll find people like you. In the meantime, you'll have benefited by both learning more about who you arc and by learning how to sur­vive in a place where you are surrounded by people who aren't like you. 
4) Do not feed the squirrels -they will follow you. 
So, with that, I leave the pages ofThe Observer for good. Thanks to all the folks at The Observer who have put my column into print for six of the last seven semes­ters. Also, thanks for never putting in a picture of me, or in any way identifying me. I appreciate that I can still walk into The Observer's office and no one there knows who I am. 
So, as a departing senior, I leave the Observer Viewpoint pages to Joe Muto, the only columnist besides myself who I ever read. Take good care of them, Joe. Maybe the people who didn't get my columns can now start writing to you.

I haw b1cn nrniving these unwanted e­mails l\ir a long tinw now. but it is only in rt\f"l'lll months that I havn started to rcctiivo an e-mail every morning which 
bears the legend, "re: Your 50 pounds ol' Lob1,ter". These e-mails originate from a company that promises me that I am absolutnly entitled to 50 pounds of absolutely free lobster with absolutely no st.rings attadwd, guarantmid.

Al Gore never actually claimed to bave invented the Internet. He said that when he was in Congress he look the initiative in creating it, which was a rather self­aggrandizing way of referring to the fact that he was responsible for some legisla­tion which helped to turn the Internet into a revolutionary commercial force. And with the elnctronic commerce came the eloctronic junk mail, oflering all the annoyance of the real thing at a fraction of the ecological cost. 

All of which brings us back to my 50 pounds of lobster. Now I have been assuming that, despite the vigorous assur­ances to the contrary. if I were to elect to receive Lhc lobster l would incur some kind of hidden cost. Perhaps I would be required to send 50 pounds of lobster to three other people along with instructions that they should do the same. or maybe I would be charged $130 for shipping and handling. 
I have assumed that there must be some such catch because elementary economics tells me that any business which was in the habit of" sending 50 pounds of absolutflly free lobster to people who had absolutely not asked for it would absolute­ly go out of business, guaranteed. But that sort of thinking just shows how out of date J am. In the New Economy there has been no shortage of people willing to invest in companies which are no more likely to make a profit than they are to make an actual product. 
But the Internet has its benefits too. Speaking as a lifelong insomniac, the Internet Movie Database is a godsend. In the days before the Web I could stare at the ceiling !ilr hours while trying to rnmcmber the name of the actor who starrnd opposite James Belushi in Oliver Stone's (deservedly) little known TV minis­rrios Wild Palms. Now, thanks to the won­der of the Database I can find out in a few seconds that it was David Warner and use the time l have saved to read opinions about the show written by people who I don't know and who seem to be incapable of ending a sentence without using one or more exclamation marks. This is progress, of a sort.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
A closer look at the people of the Middle East 
Ignorance comes ftom rulers 
Although John Lille's /\pril 11 col­unrn was not we!l-dPlivcred. I find it dislwarlening that thn responses it has garnered thus far have nol l'ocuscd on thP main point of it and. worse, yet, even criticiwd The Obsfrvcr for publishing it. There is validity in the argument that the vast majority of the Middle Eastern com­munity, through no fault of their own, is ignorant. 
By vast majority. I mean the com­mor1 people of' the Middle East and not tho small 1wrC<\lltage of the edu­cawd upper-class who completely control the resources, education and opportunities of tlwse countries. It is this small pt1rcPntage that is to blanw, !"or 1.lwy haw usnd religion, foar and ninsorship to satisfy their gnwd and deprive the population of' cducalion and the opportunity for a bettPr lifo. In doing so, not only have tlwy betrnytid thr.ir own pcc1plc, they tuw<\ also tl11cr<ms1\d the progress or Wchnology and civilization in thnsc countri,~s. sonrnthing a nrnmber of' acad(\lllia such as !Jr. Bualuan knows. 
Unfi1rtunatP!y. tlw rulnrs also con­trol tlw media and look Lo the scape­goats 111' Isra.t!l and Llw Unit11d States to hl1111w 1hr llw condition of' their p(opl1\. II' you bdii,ve thn !\nrnrican m<'dia dons not giv11 a very broad vi1w of' the world, you should take a look at nrnllia within the Middle East Ewn those who sep through this pro­pagamla still have nowhere to turn; no citizen of Syria without a penchant for being slcmed to death would pub­licly protest his government. 
/\!though I am for the war in Iraq, I would be infuriated to see no one opposing it. That would be a failure of democracy. and I'm glad the anti­war protesters have the courage to oppose the majority. Similarly. Lille's column. while inflammatory. has a good point. and to suggest that The Observer shouldn't have published it is lunacy. Censorship only leads to ignorance and if you want that you can go live in the Middle East. 
Though unfortunately Litle fails to realize this. being an "Arab" has absolutely nothing to do with the argument he makes. Many other eth­nicities have suffered enforced igno­rance at the hands of an oppressive government as well. America is living proof" that all people, regardless of" ethnicity, can succeed when given the education and opportunity. Were it not lilf the brilliant and hard working Arabs, Africans, Europeans and oth­ers who make up America. we would not b( where we arc today. I hope for the sake of all of the great Middle Eastern people that America contin­ues to clean uµ the mess that a few grPndy leaders have created in that pm-t of tlrn worl<l.

Terrorism is not a part ofIslam 
I was reading an article in The Observer, and I decided to express my point of view about the Middle East and the Arab commu­nity living there. Being Turkish has given me a chance to see the Middle Eastern world through a different perspective. I grew up in a city that is very close to the Turkish bor­ders ofSyria and Iraq. I have friends who are Turkish, Arab and Kurd. These people are "modern" people and aware of their religion. 
If you look at the Arab world in the Middle East, especially in Iraq and Iran, you see a world lacking both education and the ability to improve one's awareness of their country and the world. It is true that the Middle East Arabs don't know much about world issues. but it is not because they want to ignore what's happening. It is because they are taught things without the facts. These people are the victims of dictatorship, which bans them from having televisions. radios and for­eign publishing, so that they can be easily brainwashed and taught to hate the United States. 
It is wrong to blame Islam !'or acts ofter­rorism. Islam is not about putting women in black garments or having greasy. long­bearded men. It is definitely not about terror­ism. Islam is a religion which respects all kinds of people. Islam cannot be used "as a weapon," and it docs not promote the idea of building terrorist groups to kill people f'rom other religions. I find it wrong to see all Muslims as ignorant and violent. I am sure you are thinking that if Islam is not about ter­rorism, then why is this group of Muslims threatening innoceut people and trying to terrorize the world'' It is because these men arc misinterpreting their religion for their own benefits. They hate the United States because as they misinterpreted their religion, since the Middle Ages. Many countries in the Middle East have been improving according to the world's development after the Middle Ages. In my tenth grade history class. I saw a picture of the Afghan people in the l 91 Os, and I was surprised to see that these people were dressed in modern clothing. It is a fact that having leaders who enforced ideas of violation, oppression and terrorism forced their citizens to be involved in terrorist attacks or to be indifferent about what is happening in their own country. 
In high school, I was told not to judge peo­ple as ignorant or uneducated because of their physical appearances, what they believe or where they come from. I have seen a lot or people who dress in expensive clothing and have had a good education. These people try to show off their intelligence by making com­ments about countries in which they do not completely know the history, geography or the people. I believe that there are things that exist in this world that lead some people to become overly ambitious for bnnelits. 
It is a law of nature: there have always been bad people and good people. !\s human beings, we should show that we have brains by finding ways to deal with these bad people other than fighting or killing ourselves like animals. It is also a law of naturn that states once one starts killing. innoc1mt pmiplt arn going to die. It does not maUnr if you have the most. developed technological wnapons. 
A country can only be saved by il'i own peoplo since it needs to bo f"ed by its own cul­ture, religion and traditions.

MOVIE REVIEW 

'Journey' is inspirational but incomplete 
By BJ STREW Scene Movie Critic 
After Frederick Douglass, it was all downhill for the chiasmus. 
~evertheless, amateur filmmaker Eric Saperston gives it the old college try. "Sometimes you take a trip, sometimes the trip takes you." What a wildly novel insight. Give us a break -a Deadhead who decides on a whim to endow his little vanity project (following the Grateful Dead, working in Aspen, filming it all) with some weight, that elusive element that might elevate it from little-vanity­project to serious-documentary? 
This is stale inspirational drivel in the vein of Lifetime movies and Deepak Chopra books. It lacks the focus that might have imbued the film with poignancy and, at least, pertinence. Instead it's a run-of-the-mill superficial musing on the meaning of life -oh, and with the truly original "journey" metaphor. Attempting to lend this hoary metaphor big-name credibility, Saperston invokes the sunny, all-American experi­ences of Jimmy Carter, a few Fortune 500 execs. insipid musicians and so on. 
Hendrik Hertzberg was right: Jimmy Carter is "a far better ex-President than he was a President." Let's not forget that the Nobel laureate toasted the Shah of Iran. hugged Brezhnev, was "best friends" with Marshal Tito, identified with Ceausescu's human rights views, lauded Kim II Sung and penned speeches for Arafat -the guy loves his dictators. Just who needs to dispense wisdom to our benighted Generation Y. 
Or, wait; maybe this apathetic genera­tion needs to hear from a soda magnate. The quondam Coke president, Donald Keough, who donated money for Keough Hall, delights viewers with perhaps the most riotously corny "wisdom" the film offers: "We're sort of brought up in our society to believe that being vulnerable is a sign of weakness -it's a sign of strength." Someone slap that gem on an AudioBook, and pronto1 
Seeing Saperston in Ken Kesey's old International Harvester bus, it is tempting to wish that the "trip" in question were less literal and more lysergic. Come on, it's Ken Kesey. But no. Saperston does some­thing far more heinous: using Kesey's "Are you on the bus?" motto to close a sales talk. It real­ly is excruciating to watch this director per­vert the Merry Prankster's words with

Jane is an aging hippie record producer who slill hangs out with rock stars half her age, drinks and smokes pot constantly.

She is the free spirit that represents everything that the uptight Sam and Alex are not.

And, why is it that the only way to be a free spirit is to be sexually promiscuous and do lots of drugs? Why can't anyone come up with any better ideas?

Flyers 3, Maple Leafs 2 (30T) 
The Philadelphia Flyers need­ed three overtimes to put a win­ner past Ed Belfour. 
Mark Hecchi scored his second goal of the game with 6:06 remaining in the third overtime period to give the Flyers a series­evening 3-2 victory Wednesday night over the Toronto Maple 
Leaf's. 
Bcllour made 72 saves before Hecchi's wrist shot from the l"accoff cirde hit the goalie's stick and barely trickled over the goal line as the Flyers evened the best-of-seven Eastern Conference playoff series a 2-2. Game 5 is Saturday night in Philadelphia. 
"Eddie Belfour battled tremen­dously hard. He was great tonight," Hecchi said. "l was just trying to get it on net." 
Jeremy Roenick also scored for the Flyers. 
"That was two hockey games," Hoenick said. "Eddie was awe­some. Eddie gave that team a chance to win the hockey game. They almost did, but we were very fortunate." 
Travis Green and Mats Sundin scored for the Leafs, who were without leading scorer Alexander Mogilny. Clipped under the jaw by a stick two nights earlier, Mogilny was advised by team doctors to sit one out. He'll be re-examined Thursday. 
The Flyers outshot the Leafs 75-38, setting a Philadelphia playoff record for most shots on goal. Belfour's total saves was one short of the playoff record New York's Kelly Hrudey set when the Islanders beat Washington in four overtimes in 1987. 
"The shots seem to be an incredible number," Toronto coach Pat Quinn said. "Eddie's a trooper, Ile put us in a position to win but we didn't do it." 
Toronto, which beat Philly in double overtime on Monday night, played its third-longest game in franchise history and longest since 1943. 
It was the second-longest game in Flyers history. 
'This was a must win for us," Philadelphia captain Keith Primeau said. "We're even instead of going home down 3­1." 
Philadelphia won despite going 0-for-8 on the power play, falling to 2-for-21 in the series. 
Michal Handzus almost won it for the Flyers in the first over­time, but his shot rolled over Belfour's pads and through the goal crease. 
Philadelphia goalie Roman Cechmanek made 36 saves. 
He robbed Darcy Tucker in the second overtime with a kick save. 

NBA 
Jordan ends career with loss to Sixers 
Associated Press 
PHIL.ADELPHIA 
Michael Jordan sat on the bench, smiling and joking with teammates as the sellout crowd chanted, "We want Mike! We want Mike!" 
Though he didn't want to go back in, Jordan wouldn't dis­appoint the fans in the final game of his NBA career. 
Jordan pulled off his warmups, received yet anoth­er lengthy ovation, went back on the court, and was pur­posely fouled by Eric Snow. Fittingly, Jordan made his final two shots -both free throws. 
One of the greatest players in NBA history, Jordan then exited for good with 1:44 remaining in the fourth quar­ter of Washington's 107-87 loss to Philadelphia on Wednesday night. 
Another standing ovation followed, this one including the coaches and other play­ers. Jordan flashed his famil­iar wide smile, waved to the crowd and took a seat on the bench one last time. 
"It's time to move on," Jordan said. "It's easier to accept that because physically I know it and feel it." 
Jordan finished with 15 points, four rebounds and 
four assists in 28 minutes ­drawing several adoring ova­tions from a Philly crowd notorious f'or its boorish behavior. 
The fans did boo. but only when they thought Jordan wasn't coming back into the game. He went to the bench with 4:13 left in third quarter, and didn't return until 2:35 remained in the game, 
With the Sixers ahead by 21 points and 9 1/2 minutes left, the chants of "We want Mike!" started. The chant grew loud­er as the period progressed with Jordan remaining snat­ed, and fans ignored the game to stand and stare at the Wizards' bench, wondering why Jordan wasn't playing. 
"The game didn't merit me going back in," Jordan said. "Obviously, they wanted to see me make a couple of bas­kets. That was very, very respectful." 
While the fans implored Jordan to return, Wizards coach Doug Collins pleaded with him. 
"Ile really didn't want to, but I said, 'Michael, please, you got to go out there, "' Collins said. 
Jordan's final points almost looked scripted, with Snow fouling him in the backcourt for no apparent reason except to send him to the line.

DAVIE, Fla. 
Linebacker Junior Seau joined the Miami Dolphins after passing a physical, completing a long-anticipat­ed trade with the San Diego Chargers. 
The Dolphins sent a con­ditional 2004 draft choice to San Diego in return for Seau, a 12-time Pro Bowl selection. 
"The truth is Junior Seau needed the Miami Dolphins more than the Miami Dolphins needed Junior Seau," Seau said. "This organization is doing every­thing possible to commit itself to winning a ring." 

Dolphins coach Dave Wannstedt lauded Seau's passion, talent and profes­sionalism as he introduced the new linebacker at a news conference . 
"It's a great day for the Dolphins, a very positive day for the Miami Dolphins," Wannstedt said. 
Seau flew from California to Miami on Tuesday after agreeing to a restructuring of his contract, which runs through 2005. The contract maneuvering addressed a $2. 7 million bonus Seau was due to receive Tuesday from the Chargers. 
The Chargers last month gave the 34-year-old Seau permission to seek a trade. 
Seau opened his remarks by paying tribute to former Chargers general manager John Butler, who died last week of lung cancer, and thanking the city of San Diego. 
"I want them to know I wish them well, until Oct. 27 ," Seau said, referring to the date when San Diego will play host to Miami in a Monday night game. 
Seau has spent his entire 13-year career with the Chargers, his hometown team. In Miami, he's expected to replace Derrick Rodgers at outside line­backer. 
The trade, which had been in the works for sever­al weeks. is the first major deal for the Dolphins since a dismal December col­lapse. The team had seven Pro Bowl players, including NFL rushing leader Ricky Williams and sack leader Jason Taylor, and still failed for the first time in six years to make the playoffs. 
Seau hasn't led the Chargers in tackles since 1999, and he started a career-low 13 games last season because of an ankle injury that required post­season surgery. But he was attractive to the Dolphins because they're in the mar­ket for better veteran lead­ership following a succes­sion of late-season failures.

Irish travel separate ways 
By HEATHER 
VAN HOEGARDEN 
Sports Writer 

After finally getting to run together last week­end, the Notre Dame mon's and women's track team will split up once a~ain. 
Most of the runners will take a short trip to Indianapolis, but for the rest of the Irish sunny Walnut, Calif. awaits, with the Mt. San Antonio College Relays this weekend. 
While the nucleus of the Irish travels to California, the majority will compete in the Indy Invitational in Indianapolis on Saturday. 
Walnut's Mt. SAC Relays has been one of the premier meets during the outdoor season. It is well known worldwide as it attracts athletes from top universities, independent organizations, and around the world. 
The Relays, in their 45th year. will take place in Hilmer Lodge Stadium, which features a state-of­the-art track and field facility. The meet will fea­ture only the best; in order to compete. an athlete must meet qualifying standards for their event. 
On the women's side, Jennifer Handley and Molly Huddle look to make some noise in the 5,000-meter run. Handley is seeded 13th, with a time of 16:28.55, while Huddle is seeded 171.h in another bracket. Lauren King is the last distance runner for the women and will compete in the 1,500 meters, an event in which she took fifth last year. 
In the field, Jaime Volkmer is seeded eighth with a distance of 13-5 1/4 in the pole vault. Volkmer, who took seventh at the Mt. SAC Relays last year. also holds the school record in the pole vault. 
Stacey Cowan and Emily Loomis will compete in the high jump for the Irish. Cowan is seeded eighth (5-9 3/4), and Loomis is seeded 13th (5-10 1/2).

Notre Dame proves to be the best choice for Lunke 
 Lunke looks to lead Irish to Big East Championship 
By ERIK POWERS 
Spores Writer 
Senior captain Brandon Lunke plays in his final Big East Championship this weekend when second-seeded Notre Dame 
h o s t s Georgetown. St. John's, Rutgers, Seton Hall and top­seeded Virginia Tech at the 

Warren Golf Lunke Course. A tournament victory would clinch a berth for the Irish in the NCAA Championships. A Big East Championship would be a fitting end to Lunke's long and successful career. "I began golfing at the age of three or four," Lunke said. "I would play at night with my dad and older brother. I started play­

_,;. 
ing competitively at the age of eight. I was in summer tourna­ments at the age of 10." 
Since then, golf has remained a game that Lunke excels at. During each of his four years in high school, Lunke was a mem­ber of the varsity golf team, selected as an all-city golfer in his hometown of San Antonio, and reached the state tourna­ment. Lunke also played on fifth­place team at the AJCA Justin Leonard Team Challenge. He shot a 64 in the first-round best ball. contributing to his team's first-round lead. As a reward, he and his team earned chance to play with Leonard. 
Texas, as well as several out­of-state universities, recruited Lunke during his senior year. He chose Notre Dame for both ath­letic and social reasons. 
"When I took my visit. I liked the place and people," Lunke said. "I wanted to get out of Texas, to make a fresh start in life. The team was in a rebuild­ing stage, and r thought that I could make a contribution." 
Lunke wanted to contribute to the team immediately, but his playing time was limited as a freshman. George Thomas, men's golf coach during Lunke's freshman and sophomore sea­sons. allowed Lunke to compete in only one tournament. Lunke excelled at that tournament, fin­ishing in a tic for 14th at the Treasure Coast Classic. But he still could not crack Thomas's top five. 
.. It was a little frustrating," Lunke said. "I felt that I could do well if given a chance. But Coach Thomas decided to use older, more experienced players." 
Lunke earned a place in Thomas's lineup the next year. As a sophomore, Lunke finished second among Irish golfers (39th overall) at the Legends of Indiana tournament, 61st overall at the Minnesota Invitational, tied for 23rd overall at the Wisconsin Invitational, and took 27th over­all at the Big East Championship. 
The Irish changed coaches for his junior season, hiring current coach John Jaskinski. Lunke's secs a big difference between Thomas and Jasinski. 
"Coach Thomas was a great guy. He knew a lot about the game," Lunke said. "(But] we wanted to become a top team in the countrv. Coach Jasinski was exactly what the team needed. He's a really good person." 
Jasinski decided that the Irish needed Lunke as well, and the junior played in nine of 12 tour­naments. Lunkc was at his best when he tied for 21st at the Tillinghast Invitational, tied for 29th at the Johnny Owens Invitational and tied for third at Michigan's Wolverine Invitational. 
This past fall, Lunke estab­lished himself as the team's senior leader. Lunke has partici­pated in more tour­naments 

Helping the team's six fresh­men, four of whom usually accompany Lunke on away tour­naments, is a full-time task. But Lunke enjoys the responsibility and is comfortable with being surrounded by the team's youth on road trips. 
"They're a pretty mature, good group of guys. It's been fun to sec the group developing," Lunke said. 'Tm the only senior

I feel that I've gotten better." 
After the golf" season is over, the future is an open fairway for Lunke. Lunke is a finance and history double major. But he might not enter the business world directly after graduation. 
"I might take a little time off in order to work on my game," Lunke said. "I might play golf for a while and give [a professional career] a shot. This is the time that I can do it." 
With the season almost over and graduation looming on the horizon, Lunke cannot believe that his time at Notre Dame is almost gone. He has mixed feel­ings over the end of his career. 
"It's amazing how fast it goes," Lunke said. "It's been happy at times, I've been upset with it at other times. Golf is interesting. It's not a team game. but in col­lege it's a team sport.· 
The 24th Big East Championship runs from April 21st to 22nd at the Warren Golf course. The Irish begin the first 36 holes of the 54-hole tourna­ment Monday at 8:50 a.m.

Irish look to continue April success over weekend 
ByMATTLOZAR Asxociate S pons Editor 
The month of April has always been nice to the lrish, but for the third straight year, it has been really nice. 
Having won 12 straight games in April, Notre Dame looks to extend that streak today, hosting IUPU-Fort Wayne in a non-conference doublehead er. 
The Irish have won 76 percent of their games all­time in April. In 2001, the Irish compiled a perfect 23-0 record while last year the Irish went 24-1. According to Notre Dame coach Deanna Gumpf, the reasons for the success in April aren't too sur­prising. 
"It has been a good month in the past and so far so good this year," Gumpf said. "We have had a month and a half of games already. get to play at home and can play games consistently. In April we get some momentum." 
Prior to April, the Irish started the year with one of the country's most challenging schedules. For the second straight year, the Irish played the defending national champion in the month of February. During the first five weeks of the season, the Irish played five ranked teams. The rigorous schedule allows the Irish to see where they rank against the best in the country and leads to their impressive April records. 
"It helps tremendously. Everyone has their own opinion, but I think we get prepared for the rest of our year," Gumpf said. "Once we play the toughest teams in the country, we know what it takes to beat them." 
The formula during the current 12-game win­ning streak has been simple -receiving steady output from each of the three aspects of the game. 
On offense, shortstop Andria Bledsoe is the hottest of the Irish hitters with a .395 average, two home runs, 14 RBIs and three stolen bases over the past 12 games. Five other Notre Dame hitters join Bledsoe with an average of .300 or above during the winning streak. 
With the bats producing more than enough runs, the Irish pitching staff hasn't needed all of them. The staff has allowed 11 earned runs over the past

Ryan sacrifices personal success for her team 
By LISA REIJULA 
Sports Writer 
It may sound cliched, but there are some athletes who play not for individual glory or a perfect record, but because of their love for the game and their team­mates. 
Saint Mary's senior co-captain Elisa Ryan is one of those athletes. 
Ryan, a native of' St. Paul, I.Vlinn., has spent four seasons playing for the Saint Mary's tennis team. She grew up playing tennis with her father, who played for the Army. 
"My dad was sort of a coach for me, and my childhood was spent playing ten­nis," said Ryan. "My friend Charlie and I would play everyday on the clay courts in St. Paul." 
Enrolling at Saint Mary's in the fall of 1999, Ryan also played basketball her freshman year. In addition to the athletic opportunities Saint Mary's offered, she picked the school because it was rela­tively close to home and had a highly­regarded Home program. 
"I knew I would be able to get playing time on the tennis team, as opposed to being a practice player at a Division I or II school," said Ryan. "I immediately felt comfortable with everyone and the coach." 
After deciding to concentrate solely on tennis her sophomore year, Ryan won MIAA conference titles at both No. 6 sin­gles and No. 3 doubles. The next year, as a junior, she again won two conference championships, this time at No. 5 singles and No. 2 doubles. She is playing at those same spots this season as well. 

"She hates to lose," said Saint Mary's coach Dee Stevenson. "She's very tena­cious and never gives up." 
Proof of Ryan's determination was her three-set comeback victory in the Belles' match against Hope College on April 15. After dropping the first set, Ryan over­came two match points to take the sec­ond set and stay alive in the match. 
Comebacks are nothing new for Hyan, a right-hander who underwent her third wrist surgery this September, on her dominant hand. 
"This has been a physically painful season," said Ryan. "My doubles partner Uunior co-captain Kaitlin Cutler] and I have had a lot of injuries, but we love it so much that we get through it. She's gutted it out for me this season because I'm a senior." 
The Belles have lost two conference matches this season after not dropping a single contest the past two years. The Belles have relied on Hyan's leadership to stay confident. 
"The win is really not what it's about. but it's the effort that we all put into it," she said. "We're not used to losing and
