Nixon Rebukes HHH 
ERIE, Pa. UPI -Richard M. Nixon said Tuesday Vice President llubert H. Humphrey possibly damaged the Vietnam peace negotiations in Paris by "confusing" Hanoi about the United States' position with his bombing halt proposal. 
The Republican presidential candidate said Humphrey's statement Monday night was his "fourth and possibly fifth different" stand on the issue. lie called on Humphrey to "clarify his position and make it clear that he is not pulling the rug out from under our negotiators." 
Noting Humphrey's contention that he would take a risk in stopping the bombing of North Vietnam, Nixon said: "I would respectfully submit that the risk is not his. The

PARIS UPI Hanoi Tuesday night dismissed Vice President llubert llumphrey's qualified promise to halt U.S. air raids against North Vietnam as a statement that was too conditional. 
Vui Nhan, a spokesman for the Hanoi delegation to the Paris talks on Vietnam, said Humphrey was speaking "in the conditional" in his Salt Lake City speech Monday. 
Humphrey pledged he would order a complete halt to bombing of the North providing the Communists gave evidenc~ of "willingness to restore the Demilitarized Zone between North a11d S1.'1.1lh Vietnam." 
North Vietnam's special adviser to the Paris talks, Le Due Tho said there was "absolutely nothing new" in Humphrey's statement. 
"It is always the same demand of reciprocity which we reject," Tho said. "Candidates often make nice statements and when they are elected do something completely different." 
Tho said there was no difference between the U.S.

The Big Brother Program will hold its first meetin of the year tonight at 7:00 p.m. in Room 27H of the Engineering Building. 
The program, run in conjunction with the Catholic Social Service of South Bend was started two years ago and activated last spring by Paul Ramsey. 
The purpose of the program is to provide delinquent and preГdelinquent youths of the South Bend area with the guiding companionship of an older person. Many of them have been such companionship since they come from broken homes. The students in the program work on a one to one basis with the boys. The aim is not primarily to help the boy with his work in school, but merely spend some time with him in the sort of activity an older brother would. 
Support for the program is growing in South Bend, and

Editor: 
As a member of the Notre 
Dame student body, was 
extremely disheartened and 
dissatisfied with some of my 
colleagues on Sunday afternoon 
at Washington Hall. Despite the 
Student Union Academic 
Commissioner's plea to the 
audience for respect and 
maturity at the appearances of 
our guest speakers, many 
members of the audience were 
guilty of insolent behavior. 
The wa !k-out before the commencement of Senator Strom Thurmond's address was in accordance with the constitutional right of free speech; however, the hooting and hollering to gain attention later in the program and the inane and sarcastic quesГtions proposed to the seГnator (as those concerning James Brown and Senator Thurmond's imagination), selfishly wasted not only the Senator's time, but also wasted the time of interested students who might have proposed more constructive, meaningful, and informative questions if time had permitted. 
I feel that the rational majority of students on this campus should unite to discourage this type of primitive activity. Those of us at Notre Dame who believe that it is necessary to extentl respect and among people at Notre Dame doing related work. Members of the program will probably receive some guidance from the faculty of the Sociology Department and Psychological Counselling Service. 

Approxiamately forty Notre Dame students are presently in the program. T1e meeting tonight will include recruiting and some discussion of the backgroundof the program. People who cannot attend the meeting tonight should contact John Garvey in 317 Holy Cross or call him at 3170.

Editor: 
I feel compelled to comment on the incredible rudeness to which Senator Strom Thurmond was subjected during his recent appearance on campus. I violently disagree with what the Senator said, as did many members of the audience; but this disapreement is no excuse to mock the man \ ith tasteless and irrelevant questions. The gentle man who asked the se~lator where he got his vivid imagination was merely showing two things: that he was not well enough informed to ask an intelligent question, and that he had not the con mon sense to realize what an ass he was making of himself. Mr. Rossie's question concerning the 

Senator's stipend, although it may be relevant to the Abe Fortas debate, was tasteless in the extreme since the connection was not explicitly made. Senator Thurmond made a fool out of himself by the answers he gave to legitimate questions. It is sad indeed that the Senator could not continue his own self-destruction at the hands of an intelligent student 
body, but rather was built up by the personal attacks he was subjected to.
