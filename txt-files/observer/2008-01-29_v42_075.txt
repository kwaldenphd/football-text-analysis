Funds complete for building project 
Spes Unica Hall will ultimately be the most expensive construction project in College's history 
By NIKKI TAYLOR 
News Writer 
When the 2008 fall semester begins at Saint Mary's this August, students will attend many classes in a building completed after the most expensive construction project in College history. 
Spes Unica Hall is a new aca­demic building currently under construction on the northeast side of campus. Fundraising for the building has recently been completed, and the build­ing is set to open for classes in the fall. 
The total cost of the project is $19.2 million, making it the most expensive construction project in College history. The building was entirely paid for in donations, without putting to use any other college funds, said Saint Mary's spokesperson Gwen O'Brien. More than 600 donations came in from faculty, staff, alumnae, students and friends of the College, she said. 
College President Carol Ann Mooney said the opening of the building will allow continued growth at Saint Mary's. 
"This building represents our future -a future that will see us ever more ambitious and ever more widely recognized for the excellent education of women," she said. "I am most grateful to our donors for their commitment to our mission and vision." 
The building's name, Spes Unica, is Latin for "our only hope" and refers to the cross of Jesus Christ. It is the motto of both Saint Mary's and the College's founding order, the Congregation of Holy Cross. 
The name was chosen by one of the significant donors to the project, O'Brien said. 

"A number of names for the academic building were con­sidered; however, when the name Spes Unica was consid­ered, it spoke to our mission," said Shari Rodriguez, vice president of College Relations. 
Ground was broken on this 65,000 square-foot building in the fall of 2006. Spes Unica will house 13 of the 20 academic departments at Saint Mary's, as well as the Center for Academic Innovation, the Center for Spirituality and the Center for Women's

College of A&L sells o-wn course packets 
Professors seek alternatives to limit costs for course materials using electronic reserves 
By CLAIRE REISING 
News Writer 
Students can buy Arts and Letters course packets this semester directly through the College of Arts and Letters in Decio Hall, though professors may still sell packets through the Hammes Bookstore. 
Some professors are also trying to help students save money by placing materials online on e-reserves, as an alternative to selling hard copy packets. 
Last semester, the College's decision to consolidate course packet distribution by selling all packets through the Bookstore met with dissatis­faction by students who found the packets significantly more expensive than previous semesters. 
Robert Becht, director of Finance and Administration for the College of Arts and Letters, said that with the new arrangement, the College of Arts and Letter's copy organi­zation Design, Copy and Logistic (DCL) Services can sell course packets itself and still allow students to buy them at one location and pay with their student accounts. Instead of selling course packets at multiple locations throughout campus, all of DCL Service's packets are now sold in a Decio Hall conference room. 
"We made the decision to bring the retail sales back to our [operations], and it made

Dining hall theft still ra111pant 
12,960 spoons, 216 trays missing in 2007 
By KATIE PERALTA 
News Writer 
It's not everyday that students 
walk out of South Dining Hall 
carrying long wooden tables and 
chairs back to their dorm rooms, 
but missing items from both 
campus dining halls have added 
up during the 2007 calendar 
year. 

Notre Dame Dining Hall man­
agers reported that losses of 
plates, utensils, bowls and cups 
have been similar to losses 
experienced in prior years, said 
Dave Prentkowski, director of 
Food Services. 
Some of the most frequently 
pilfered items are glasses, silver­
ware and bowls, said Mary Ann 
Sobieralski, head monitor at 
South Dining Hall. Since stu­
dents have been able to bring 
their backpacks into the dining 
hall, monitors do not see many 
students taking items, she said. 
The policy of students being 
able to bring their backpacks 
into dining areas has been in 
place for about five or six years, 
said Marc Poklinkowski, general 
manager of food services at 
South Dining Hall. Food Services 
has no plans to discontinue 
allowing bags in the dining halls. 
It is impossible to monitor 
everyone in dining halls, since 
South Dining Hall alone can 
accommodate between 800 and 
900 students at one time, 
Poklinkowski said.

Stanford Hall111ourns loss ofbeloved 'Honey' 
By BRIAN McKENZIE 
News Writer 
Two weeks before they returned to campus, Stanford Hall residents were notified through e-mail about the loss of dorm dog Honey. 
Honey, a golden retriever, was 15 years old. 
Residents were affected by the loss of Honey, who was described as a "comforting presence" by Assistant Rector-Dan Sathre. 
Stanford Rector Father Tom Gaughan said Honey was "very gentle and people-friendly." 
"She was like a little person with a tail," Gaughan said. He jokingly listed Honey on the duty-board as an RA. 
"She's always on duty, always looking out for the guys here," he said. 
He said that he planned to keep up Honey's plaque for the year. Gaughan adopted her when she was nearly eight-years old, and she passed away at the age of 15 years. 
"We spent seven years, nine months and one week together," Gaughan said. 
He said that he wanted Honey's memory to encourage adoption, especially of older dogs. Priests at Notre Dame have been unable to get permission to adopt new pets since 2001, Gaughan said. Pets like Honey, who was adopted in 1999, were grandfa­thered in under the old rules that allowed pets. 
"If that policy changes [againl, I would be open to adopting again but I. don't foresee that happening soon," Gaughan said.

Thank you, trailblazers 
When I was a kid. I had a paper route. 
Like most paper boys, I quickly learned that I could deliver 
papers more efficiently if' I didn't walk baek to the sidewalk and just went straight from door to door through peoples' yards. 

This worked Chris Khorey great l'or eight-months out of' thn year. Except Sports Editor l'or thn house with the stupid waist-high brick wall that I either had to walk all the way around or vault over with a sack full of' news­papers on my back. But I digress. 
At any rate, Pight months out of' tho year. I had prntty f'rnn rnign across tlw front yards of' thn neigh­borhood. But when Michigan winters hit, my path was suddenly blocked with snow. 
But not l'or long. 
For thn first coupln days after the snow fell. I would put on my snow pants and. trudge through the route. I madn absolutely sure to walk over thn sanw route every day. 

After a f'nw rnpntitions, the snow was packed down so much that I didn't nend snow pants any more. Evnn whnn it snowed again, there was still a trench that I could walk through, leading from door to door to door with minimal snow coverage. A coupln times, I watched the mail man follow my "paper boy trail." 
I'm sure I wasn't the only kid that ever did this. So why does this merit an inside column'? 
Because I want to thank everyone that does it at Notre Dame. Last Friday, I walked from DeBartolo to the Pasquerilla Center. I cut across Library Quad at an angle without walking on a sidewalk -and with­out getting my feet wet. 
There are countless places across campus where this is possible ­another one of my favorites is the angle between the north end of O'Shaughnessy and the front door of Riley. They're shortcuts without sidewalks, but without snow either. 
Shortcuts like these are even more essential with post-football construc­tion season heating up. I live in Siegfried -almost one-third of my dorm is surrounded by fencing where the new esc building is going up. I already have to walk around that construction site to get any­where -if I had to restrict myself to just the sidewalks on the rest of my wak across campus, I'd never get to class on time. 
When the snow first fell, brave pio­neers were willing to endure wet ankles and calves and trudge through that snow. And whereas my trail helped out me and maybe one other person, their trails serve hun­dreds -maybe thousands. 
You are true heroes, paper-boy­trail makers. And I, for one, thank you.

Sytnposiutn applies Aquinas to Iraq vvar 
By SARAH MAYER 
News Writer 
At the 11th-annual Saint Mary's symposium on Saint Thomas Aquinas on Monday, Timothy Renick, a theologian from Georgia State University, spoke about lessons Aquinas might teach about the current war in Iraq. 
The College holds a sympo­sium each year on Jan. 28, the feast day of Aquinas, to honor excellent teaching. Aquinas, a 13th-century Dominican, was a scholar who taught theology and wrote the famous work Summa Theologica. 
Renick opened by speaking about the current situation in Iraq. 
"On May 1. 2003, President George W. Bush walked off the 
U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln with a banner behind him that read 'Mission Accomplished' and stated how major combat opera­tions in Iraq have stopped," he said. 
Henick then cited several sta­tistics. In March and April of 2003, 138 Americans were killed. Since then, 3,854 have died. He said that, according to the Washington Post, 655,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed in the war as of last week. 
After giving background on Iraq, Henick incorporated the teachings of Aquinas. According to Aquinas, "War is only to be entered as last resort." 
Henick said Aquinas would only approve of a war with cold hard evidence that it is just and necessary. 
"According to George W. Bush, the United States had enough history and facts to believe that [Saddam] Hussein posed a great danger to the United States," Henick said. "He continued to say that Bush insisted Hussein was harboring chemical war­fare and keeping him on the loose was a risk the United States just could not take." 
But, Renick said; Aquinas would take issue with this as a justification for war. 
"According to Saint Thomas Aquinas, just speculation that the weapons were in his posses­sion were not enough," he said. 
Henick brought up the fact that since St. Thomas Aquinas lived in the Holy Homan Empire, he was constantly surrounded by the Crusades. 
"If Aquinas has not left a his­torical teaching on Christian versus Christian war with any evidence of opposing it, then we can conclude that there was suf­ficient evidence for the fight­ing," Renick said. 
He concluded that Aquinas would only approve of warfare in the "rarest of circumstances" and would still find it risky.

Revue tickets snapped up 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 
All free tickets for this year's Keenan Hevue were distributed in 20 minutes, said Revue direc­tor John Siegel. 
"There were a bunch of peo­ple [in line] to get tickets early. It was really good to see that peo­ple were so interested in the show based on past year's shows," Siegel said. 
The Keenan Revue, now in its 32nd year, is a long-standing hall event that has notoriously poked fun at various aspects of campus life. It will run this Thursday, Friday and Saturday. 
"When our producer Peter Viganali and I talked about what we wanted for the show, we [realized] that we are more like caretakers for the Hevue than we are making our own show," Siegel said. 'The Revue is a big tradition for our dorm, and so it's the job of the producer and the director to organize every­thing and get it ofT the ground." 
Free tickets for the annual comedy show were distributed at the Joyce Athletic and Convocation Center starting at 4 
p.m. last Thursday. Students eager to get tickets started lin­ing up around 2 p.m., Siegel said. Sales also took place at Saint Mary's beginning at 2 p.m. on Thursday. 
Although all three perform­ances of the Keenan Hevue sold out, tickets to Thursday and Saturday performances were the first to go. The remaining Friday tickets were gone within the twenty minutes. 

Revue sales for the past two years have boasted selling out in around twenty minutes or less, Siegel said. 
There were about 1,300 tick­ets available for each night of the show. 
Keenan Hall advertised for the show sales using posters around residence halls, classroom buildings and dining halls as well as on Saint Mary's College. 
According to Siegel, everyone 
who waited in line "I would say this is Weber, has got­was able to get ten adventur­

turn anyone away," he said. 
In addition to ticket.c; given out last Thursday, Keenan residents also receive four tickets they can distribute to their own dis­cretion. Additional tickets are reserved for faculty members. 
This year's Keenan Revue, called "The Night of the Living Revue," takes its inspiration from horror films. 
The two-hour show will be performed at the O'Laughlin Auditorium at Saint Mary's. 
The Hevue has been per­formed at O'Laughlin for the past 30 years because it is the best venue for the size of audi­ence that the Revue attracts, Siegel said. Other venues on Notre Dame's campus are either too large or too small, he said. 
"There will be a lot of danc­ing, Harry Potter stuff, zombies, and some poking fun at the rec­tresses," Siegel said. "We also have some synthesizers which we are very excited about." 
All skits for the show are cre­ated and perfarmed by Keenan residents and were fmalized last Sunday. The show includes about 90 Keenanites including performers, dancers, and peo­ple working behind the scenes. 
"Our chore­

usual. And the skits are really strong. This could be one of our best Hevues yet." 
Keenan residents are prepar­ing for the show for the next three days at Saint Mary's to get the acts ready for Thursday night. 
Siegel said he is very enthusi­astic about this year's Hevue. 
"Since [the show] is a movie theme, I would say this is the 'Empire Strikes Back' of Keenan Revues, instead of the 'Phantom Menace,"' Siegel said. "It should be a very good show this year. We are very excited about it."

Packets

more logistical sense to cre­ate one point for the students to come to," Becht said. 
Last semester, DCL Services produced course packets and sold them through the Bookstore to make shopping more convenient, he said. 
"The rationale for switching to the Bookstore was that so the students could purchase the text books and course packets all at the same time and so they could purchase the course packets through their student accounts," Becht said. "It was a coopera­tive venture through the entire campus." 
For some students, howev­er, the disadvantage of higher prices for course packets at the Bookstore outweighed any additional convenience. In a survey conducted by the Student Senate last October, more than 67 percent of stu­dents said they were "very dissatisfied" with the 
course packet prices. 

"Within Lthe College on Arts & Letters, they took it very seriously and encouraged DCL Services to stop selling in the Bookstore," Bant said. 
This semester, while DCL Services has -stopped selling though the Bookstore, faculty still have the option to pro­duce their course packets through Tichenor Custom Publishing or FedEx Kinkos and sell through the Bookstore, Becht said. 
Students may find, however, that Bookstore prices are not as high as they were last semester. 
Daniel Skendzel, director of Administrative Services for the University, said the Bookstore changed its policy of pricing course packets in order to rnake them more affordable for students. While the industry normally marks up copyright costs and pro­duction fees, the Bookstore has agreed to stop marking up copyright costs, he said. 
"The Bookstore has been very willing to work with the campus and students," Skendzel said. "Students should have seen· a price

Anthropology professor Susan Blum said she uses e­reserves because she believes

"''m not will­ing to use course packets anymore because of how exorbitant they've become for students," Blum said. 
Blum said that in addition to saving stu­dents the price of a course packet, e­

reserves give professors more room in planning what read­ings to use for a course. 
"E-reserves is [a nice sys­tem] because it's flexible, and we can add things as we go," Blum said. 
Instructors in the College of Arts and Letters are not the only ones who considered alternatives to Bookstore course packets. Last semes­ter, accountancy professor Jim Fuehrmeyer tried placing PowerPoint slides on Concourse. He found, howev­er, that despite the lower price of the electronic option, most students preferred to save time by buying the course packet. 
"There's a cost to me for everything I do myself," Fuehrmeyer said. "What's the cost of my time? When could you better use the time that goes to copying and printing ... PowerPoint presenta­tions?"

would support 
using e­reserves as "a primary means of access to course material," and 18 percent were neutral about the issue. Bant said he feels that saving money is more important than the con­venience of having a printed course packet. 
"Although it might be inconvenient for some, it's more inconvenient for people to pay $50 to $100 to buy a course packet that you could find online," he said. 
Instructor Christin DePouw, who uses e-reserves in her Education, Schooling and Society classes, said that although e-reserves can save money and are environmen­tally friendly, professors should decide which method best works for them. 
"I think it depends on the class," she said. "I think it's up to the professor to decide." 

Becht said the choice to use e-reserves or a printed course packet is a "pedagogical deci­sion" and the faculty will be able to choose what to do. 
"Our primary business is to support the faculty and the College," he said. "If that requires us to help support faculty in making the transi­tion to e-reserves, if that's what they want as a teaching tool, then we do provide scan­ning capabilities."

Post-election violence rises in Kenya 
KISUMU, Kenya-Thousands of machete­wielding youths hunted down members of Prnsident Mwai Kibaki's Kikuyu tribe Monday in western Kenya's Rift Valley, torching homes and buses. clashing with police, and blocking roads with burning tires. 
Witnesses described seeing two people pulled from cars and stoned to death, while another was burned alive in a minibus -the latest victims of a month of escalating violence triggered by a dis­puted presidential election. The death toll has soamd over 800. 
Kibaki has said he is open to direct talks with opposition leader Halla Odinga, who is from the Luo tribe, but that his position as president is not nogotiable. Odinga says Kibaki must step down and only new eleetions will bring peace. 
Gunmen end five-hour standoff 
PESHAWAR, Pakistan -Gunmen held dozens of studenl<; and teachers hostage for five hours at a school in northwestern Pakistan on Monday, but authorities allowed the captors to flee without pun­ishment to avoid bloodshed, a tribal negotiator said. 
None of the hostages were hurt. But the standoff underscored the government's fragile grip on Pakistan's borderlands near Afghanistan, where crime is rife and security forces are struggling to contain rising Islamic militancy. 
Kidnapping for ransom is common in Pakistan, particularly in the northwest, and police said the gunmen were criminals seeking profit rather than militants. 
The mounting violence has contributed to the growing unpopularity of President Pervez Musharral', who was on his last stop Monday of a European tour.

Iraqi reinforcements, along with helicopters, tanks and armored vehicles, converged on Mosul for what Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki pledged would be a decisive battle against al­Qaida in its last major urban stronghold. 
California precipitation subsides 
LOS ANGELES -Skies were clearing Monday over waterlogged California after a week of downpours and heavy snowfall that led to ava­lanche and traffic deaths but only minor flooding and slides. 
Highways closed because of heavy snow in the Sierra Nevada were reopened Monday, including a nearly 130-mile stretch of U.S. 395 just north of Bishop to the Nevada state line, state officials said. Interstate 80 through the Sierra between Sacramento and Reno, Nev., also was reopened Monday but chains were required, according to a Department of Transportation Web site. 
The storm produced wind approaching 40 mph.

TERRE HAUTE, Ind. -A man who spent more than two decades in prison for the slaying of an 89-year-old woman walked into the Vigo County Courthouse shackled to three other prisoners and walked out a free man after a judge agreed with prosecutors that DNA evidence exonerated him. 
Vigo Superior Court Judge Michael Lewis ordered the release of David L. Scott on Monday during a brief hearing. 
"Mr. Scott, you're free to go," Lewis said. Scott nodded his head as the judge ordered his release.

Bush delivers State of the Union 
President addresses economic concerns, urges bipartisan cooperation 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Bush, focusing on gnawing recession fears as went before Congress with his final State of the Union address, said Monday that Americans are troubled about their eco­nomic future and lawmakers should urgently approve a $150-billion rescue plan. 
On Iraq, always a main topic of his annual addresses to Congress, Bush said last year's U.S. troop buildup is succeeding after five years of a long and ·costly war that has claimed the lives of 3,940 members of the U.S. military. "AI-Qaida is on the run in Iraq and this enemy will be defeated," Bush said. 
With his approval rating near its all-time low and less than a year remaining in his presidency, Bush lacked the political clout to push bold ideas before a hostile, Democratic-led Congress. Offering modest plans, Bush proposed a $300 million "grants for kids" program to help poor children in strug­gling public schools pay for the cost of attending a private school or a better public school outside their district. 

The White House urged lawmakers, particularly in the Senate, to resist any temptation to enlarge the economic-stimulus plan that he and House leaders agreed a bipartisan solution to save Republicans from Wednesday saries have been hit hard, on last week.

tor ol" Zahm IIall accompanied the 
choir. 
The purpose of the abbey is to allow living without distraction, Nava said. The Folk Choir brielly experienced monastie life at the doisten~d monastery, where the monks pray out loud seven times a day. 
"It was fascinating to observe a contemplative lifi~style," said sen­ior Midmd McKmma, who joined the Folk Choir his sophomore y1mr. "It is a unique way of finding our vocation and a part of our Catholic tradition that not many an~ exposed to." 
The retreat was a profoundly religious experinncn for some attendanL'i, Nava said. 
"Finding God in the silence is the gift of Gethsnmani to the stu­denL'>," Nava said. 
The students participated in prayer and sang Gregorian chant with the monks and othnrwise kept sihmt on the abbey grounds. 
"Wn hope students can make it to the abbey," said Nava, who said he was pleasantly surprised to sen the eagerness of students to enter into the sih~nce and les­sons of the retreat. 
"I enjoyed observing the way Trappist monks live their every­day lilil," junior Mary McLaughlin said. "The monks accept others into their homes, lives, and wor­ship." 
McLaughlin particularly enjoy1~d walking the local trails in the pleasant weather the group enjoyed. 
"Gethsemani is beautiful, quiet, and peaceful," McLaughlin said. "And it is nice to be with God, nature, and friends." 
The retreat, planned by stu­dents and Nava, included talks from five students and Karen Kirner, associate director of the Folk Choir. Father Chrysogonus Waddel, a renowned musical composer, presented a guest lec­ture to the choir. The Folk Choir also performed a concert for the monks in the church of the abbey, which currently houses 65 Trappist monks. 
Also invited to the choir concert worn members of the surround­ing towns of Bethany, Nazareth, and Bethlehem. French religious missionaries, who founded the abbey in 1842, established a strong Catholic community in the arna of the abbey, Choir Director Steve Warm~r said. 
The Gethsemani Abbey shams a close history with Notre Dame, Warner said, noting that Father Badin was a missionary in the same region of Kentucky. Badin's remains are buried beneath the historic Log Chapel on campus. 
The choir had the opportunity to rnflect and listen as individuals, Wamer said, and it helped to replenish the group. 
"It was a great experience at the start of the semester, especial­ly as a senior to examine my faith life and reflect on the things I have done during my time at Notrn Dame," McKenna said. 
The Folk Choir provides the music for Sunday Mass in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart at 
11 :45 a.m. The choir also per­forms at special University litur­gies and tours around the United States and other countries. At the end of the spring semester, the group will perform in Scotland and Ireland. 
The choir is composed mostly of undergraduate students, although a fi~w graduate students join them each year. Auditions for upper­classmen are held in May, and freshmen can audition during ori­entation week each August.

Mormon leader dies at 97 
Believers mourn the death ofChurch ofLatter-day Saints's president 
Associated Press 

SALT LAKE CITY 
Thousands of believers were in 
muurning Monday following the 
dnath of Gordon B. Hinckley, the 
humble head of the Mormon 
church who added millions of 
new members and labored long 
to burnish the f~tith's image as a 
world religion. An announee­
ment of his successor was not 
expected for days. 

I linckley, the 15th president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, died Sunday of complications arising from old age, church spokesman Mike Otterson said. lie was 97. 
In a statement, President Bush praised Ilincklcy as a "deeply patriotic man." 
"While serving for over seven decades in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Gordon demonstrated the heart of a servant and the wisdom of a leader. He was a tireless worker and a talented communicator who was respected in his com­munity and beloved by his con­grngation," Bush said. 
The church presidency is a lifetime position. Before Hinekley, the oldest church pres­ident was David 0. McKay who was 96 when he died in 1970. 
Ilinckley, a grandson of Mormon pioneers, was presi­dent for nearly 13 years. He took over as president and prophet on March 12, 1995, and oversaw one of the greatest periods of expansion in church history. The number of temples worldwide more than doubled, from 49 to more than 120 and church membership grew from about 9 million to about 13 mil­lion. 
Dozens of mourners gathered Sunday night outside Mormon church headquarters to honor Hinckley. College students sang hymns by the light of their cell phones. On Monday, Kelly Ford, 28, of Kaysville stared at a painting of Hinckley in the church visitor's center as a snowstorm swirled outside and recalled how he took time to speak to teens. 
"He was a complete optimist. ... l-Ie talked about our potential and what the Lord expects of us," Ford said. "He was the greatest optimist I've ever known." 
Hinckley became by far his church's most traveled leader in history. And the number of Mormons outside the United States surpassed that of American Mormons for the first time since the church, the most

Hinckley worked to show that his faith was far mmoved from its peculiar and polygamous roots. Still. during his tenure, the Homan Catholic Church, Southern Baptist Convention and United Methodist Church ­the three largest U.S. denomina­tions -each declared that Mormon doctrines depart from mainstream Christianity. 
"The more people come to know us, the better they will understand us," Hinckley said in an interview with The Associated Press in late 2005. "We're a little different. We don't smoke. We don't drink. We do things in a little difl"erent way. That's not dishonorable. I believe that's to our credit."

IN BRIEF 
Iran's gasoline black market thrives 
BANDAR ABBAS, Iran -Each day, the boulevard in this port city derisively dubbed "OPEC Street" is lined with dozens of vendors selling plastic jugs of black-market gasoline to desperate driv­ers who haggle over the price of a tank­ful. 
Iran is the world's fourth-largest pro­ducer of oil. But its government imposed gasoline rationing last year in hopes of trimming extensive government subsi­dies. That has created a booming black market across the country -feeding Iranians' discontent with the economic policies of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. 
In the capital Tehran and other cities, the black market thrives around gasoline stations and mostly at night as drivers looking to buy fuel approach others who have high gasoline quotas, such as taxis or vans. 
CEO departs from Sears Corporation 
CHICAGO -Sears Holdings Corp. abruptly announced the departure of president and chief executive Aylwin B. Lewis on Monday, leaving a management void at the top of the department store chain controlled by Chairman Edward S. Lampert as it tries a high-stakes restructuring to reconnect with customers and reinvigorate slumping sales. 
Lewis was an executive at fast-food chain Yum Brands Inc. and had little retail experi­ence when he was hand-picked by Lampert in 2004 to run Kmart and later Sears. W. Bruce Johnson was named as interim CEO while the company looks for a permanent successor. 
Monday's announcement marked the latest chapter for the venerable retailer, which has seen its competitors snatch away customers since Lampert acquired Kmart in 2003 and Sears, Roebuck and Co. in 2005. 
!Iubbar's departure comes as Bush faces one of the biggest economic challenges of his presidency, a severe slump in housing and a credit crisis that have roiled financial mar­kets and triggered fears of a recession. 
Home sales experience record dive 
Wall Street investors believe Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again this week 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -New home sales plunged in 2007 by the largest amount on record while home prices tumbled sharply in December. Analysts forecast more trouble in 2008 as housing tries to emerge from its worst slump in more than two decades. 
The Commerce Department reported Monday that sales of new homes dropped by 26.4 per­cent last year to 774,000. That marked the biggest decline on record, surpassing the old mark of a 23.1 per­cent plunge in 1980. 
The government reported that the median price of a new home barely budged last year, edging up a slight 0.2 percent to $246,900, the poorest showing since prices fell by 2.4 percent during the 1991 housing downturn. 

And the slump in sales and prices appeared to be wors­ening at year's end. December sales fell by 4. 7 percent, a bigger-than­expected drop, while the median price of a home fell by 10.4 percent last month, when compared to December 2006, the biggest 12-month decline in 37 years. AP

Years ago, use of racial preferences was justified mainly as social justice­blacks and Hispanics tend to be disad­vantaged relative to whites, and thus should get a hand in admissions or hir­ing. Fair enough. As someone who grew up without car or phone, I strongly agree that lower-class applicants, what­ever their color, should get a break. 
But not all blacks and Hispanics are dis­advantaged. In fact, when they marry and form stable families, they move into the mid­dle class about as well as everyone else. Moreover, not all whites are privileged. 
Far from it. 
So in giving preferential treatment to blacks and Hispanics, it often happens that schools or employers discriminate in favor of someone who's enjoyed more advantages, and against someone who's had fewer. 
The simple, obvious solution would be to favor those applicants who can actu­ally show some degree of hardship in their backgrounds, instead of trying to infer it from their races. Too sensible? 
In any case, the justification today for racial preferences seems to be the neb­ulous concept of "diversity." Schools in particular, the argument goes, have an interest in creating a student body with the broadest possible variety of stu­dents. 
I'm not denying that schools may have such an interest, though I think that interest isn't nearly so critical as many people today argue. But then, I think the main purpose of a university is intellectual in nature, whereas a large and ever-increasing part of the educa­tional establishment considers it to be social, even sociological. Sure, college can be a place where students learn to deal with people unlike themselves -if they spent their first eighteen years in

But what is real diversity, as it relates to an institution like Notre Dame? Is it merely seeing a wide range of melanin levels? 
Consider a silly analogy. One basket holds red grapes, green grapes, purple grapes and yellow grapes._ The other contains red meat, red wine, kidney beans and beets. Which basket is more "diverse?" 
Or a more timely example -the two political parties' fields of presidential candidates. One party has a half­Kenyan, a half-Mexican and a half­woman; but from what I can tell, they all agree on pretty much everything. The Republican field is all white men, but they're all over the spectrum on many issues. So which is really more diverse? 
When I enrolled in the graduate pro­gram at St. John's College, one of the first things that struck me about the place was how weird the undergradu­ates were. Sometimes it seemed every day was Halloween. Though St. John's is just a fraction of the size of Notre Dame, it's got a much wider variety of characters. 
There are pothead stoners, wannabe jocks, loathsome preppies, no-kidding Marxists, adorable nerds, troubled goths, D&D-ers, S&M-ers, an unlikely clutch of devout Catholics, another of Eastern Orthodox, some Nietzscheans, Ayn Rand-ophiles, neo-pagans!Wiccans, ceo-radical vegans, Zen/Buddhist posers, etc. But apart from a few kids of East or South Asian descent, the place is lily-white. 
I'm not saying Notre Dame, or any place, should strive to be racially mono­tone. What I'm saying is that diversity is about more than skin color, if it's even about that at all. Yeah, I too got kind of tired of meeting the same type of per­son over and over at Notre Dame, though with me it was mainly because that type of person wasn't one I liked. 
If you're someone who looks around your classes and bemoans how few pig­ments are on display, I suggest you switch to other courses, like differential geometry, where you'll have better things to worry about, like what the hell is that strange man writing on the board. 
I would also like to know, though, while you're wondering why there are so few black people around, do you ever wonder how come there are no red­necks? Or fundamentalists/evangeli­cals? Or hippie tokers, poor white trash, or Jews? Wouldn't people like these make Notre Dame diverse too? 
Assuming students bring a different perspective simply because they're black or Hispanic is as foolish as assum­ing they're poor. What would happen if a guy were admitted because he was black, but he turned out to be from a middle-class family, hated rap, and was Republican'? Would he get expelled for not being really black? 
And what about Hispanics who are blond? Likewise, assuming someone is just like everyone else and brings no diversity to the place, simply because he's white, is extremely offensive. Ignorant, too. 
If Notre Dame wants real diversity, I suggest that, instead of asking appli­cants' racial backgrounds, admissions should ask: How many of your relatives have done time? How much pot have you smoked? Have you ever worn clothes from Goodwill, not as a joke? Squirrels: feed 'em, or eat 'em? 
Naturally, not all diversity is good. Pederasts, al Qaeda sympathizers, and skinheads would all make Notre Dame more diverse; that doesn't mean they should be tolerated. I, myself, wish the whole school were pro-life, but we're lucky if the whole C.S.C. is. Good or bad, though, "diversity" is no excuse to dis­criminate by skin color. Notre Dame should stop doing so.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
An insult to muffindom 

Brothers and sisters, we have all noticed a dra­matic drop in Letters to the Editor this semester. There are many suspicions -the tameness of the comics, a lack of humorous misogynistic remarks, a remarkable increase in the writing prowess of Ohio State University students (seriously guys?) ­but I am here to give a voice to the silent majority that can no longer muster the energy to write this letter -those who have been shocked into a comatose state by the miniaturization of South Dining Hall muffins. 
Clearly they are the gem of the pastry aisle ­when there are still dozens of glazed donuts and an entire mountain of cheese Danishes, the muf­fin bin always runs dry by 12:15. I know I'm not the only one who grab-and-goes six muffins and a juice box. It's the best calorie/bag ratio available. However, the current shrinking of the mufim 
threatens to destroy one of God's finest creations -the sanctity of the muffin. I have one relic from ancient times -a true mammoth muffin measur­ing in at a towering 8.7 em. The insult to muffind­om I snagged at lunch today tips the scales at a puny 6.3 em. 
Notre Dame: we can do better. The silent majority must remain silent no longer-rise up, and protest the desecration of the beloved institu­tion that is the South Dining Hall muffin. The issue boils down to one simple question: would you rather have more or less muffin in your muf­fin?

Response to racist letters 

When one receives a letter with no return label merely addressed to "occupant," one should be suspicious. However, the letters my dorm received didn't contain any conventional dangers, rather, they contained something more sinister: Hate. 
While I agree that this letter deserves none of our respect, I must disagree with Rector Colonna in his proposition of tossing the letter outright. To throw out this letter would be ignoring a major problem that still exists in our nation. 
We may like to think that racism is gone, but as this letter indicates, there are still those out there clinging to these views. I propose reading the letter. Now, I'm not asking you to read hateful junk mail. 
However, I do ask you to see the so-called "rea­soning" behind racism, to see how competent writ­ing can still be laden with terribly fallacious argu­ments, to confirm your beliefs that racism is irra­tional and abhorrent. 
The man from North Dakota wants attention and change. Let's give the problem some attention. Let's make some change in the direction of equali­
ty.

Truth, lies and politicians 
I was impressed to see that Andrew Nesi could muster up some righteous indignation over the fact that politicians lie. Of course, his brilliant expose on the matter simply shocked me. Politicians are not entirely truthful? Can I still believe that Bill Clinton did not have sex with that woman? That W is a uniter, not a divider? That Richard Nixon is not a crook? That George Bush the Elder would not raise taxes? That Thomas Jefferson would not expand governmental powers? What a shame that, given the impressive record of truthi­ness in American presidents, today's candidates refuse to uphold this tradition. 
Unfortunately, I believe that Mr. Nesi forgot two examples of politi­cal dishonesty in this year's campaign from his preferred candi­dates. In an act that I am sure was completely accidental, Mr. Nesi forgot to mention that Barack Obama's claims of bi-partisanship don't stand up to the light of his voting record. 
He also forgot that John McCain has lied about never receiving pork for his state. In truth, every single one of the candidates has lied at least once. It's a part of the process, and it will continue to be so until Americans learn to appreciate disappointing truths. 
Perhaps, instead of focusing on campaign promises, we should focus on a candidate's voting record or gubernatorial achievements. It would be wise to base any presumptions on what a candidate would do in office off his or Hillary's deeds instead of their words. 
Candidates lie. It's the way they all play the game. Don't vote for the candidate who can delude you the most into thinking they are an honest and upright individual. Vote for the person that has best acted out your own beliefs on government in their political careers, whether that individual is named Clinton, Obama, Romney, McCain, Huckabee or O.J. Simpson.

In the events of "One More Day," Marvel made the decision to end the 20-year marriage between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson. Through various machinations, Peter and MJ struck a deal with the demonic character Mephisto to have their mar­riage erased from history in order to save the life of Peter's dying Aunt May. 
While fans met the decision to end the marriage with almost universal dis­gust, the poorly eonceived story and its ill timing angered fans even more. Nevertheless, sales of the popular wall crawler's series have never been high­er.

Spider-Man stopping them in the aet, and then selling these photos to the Daily Bugle. Along the way, Spidey encounters a new erime boss, Mr. Negative, and unravels his plot to take control of New York's most powerful erime families. While a servieeable story, I can't help but feel like I have read it before. 
And herein lies the problem with the changes to Spider-Man's status quo. On its own two legs, "Brand New Day" is not a bad story. It is written by Dan Slott, one of today's best writers, and is accompanied with beautiful artwork by Steve MeNiven. However, longtime fans of the series will undoubtedly feel like they have read this story before.

How these developments affect Spider-Man's cross-continuity with other characters in the Marvel Universe has not been revealed at this time; however, "Brand New Day" strives to build upon the Spider-Man legacy in a story that feels like many of the elassic Spider-Man stories from the 1960s and 70s. 
Brand New Day follows a Peter Parker who has given up his role of Spider-Man. He has resorted to bor­rowing money from his pal Harry Osborn to get by. Only when Peter's financial burdens become too much does he don the popular red and blue spandex. 
In classic Spider-Man tradition, Parker attempts to confront various criminals, photographing himself as

To be completely honest, I was expecting much more from "Brand New Day," considering all the media hype it received. The story itself was functional, but was hampered by the fact that it felt so familiar as compared to the previous installments of the elas­sic comic. 
The decision to ship the title three times a month helped "Brand New Day" because there simply was not enough going on if it stayed a monthly title. I will reserve linaljudgment of this new status quo to see if writers ean continue to deliver solid story telling of everyone's favorite wall crawler.

Last night, Georgia-based rock band The Whigs played on CBS's "Late Show with David Letterman." The guest spot was well-deserved recognition for this emotive and bluesy rock trio, who came out with their second album "Mission Control" last Tuesday. 
The Whigs -all in their twenties and hailing from Athens, Georgia -released their self-financed and independent album "Give 'Em All A Big Fat Lip" in 2005. The band quickly gained many fans who found The Whigs' early­Nineties rock vibe refreshing in the cur­rent rock scene. The Whigs look like they could be buddies of acoustic surfer­dude Jack Johnson, but they rock with the energy of guitar-heavy, jam-band groups such as Gov't Mule and The Band. 
Their indie release helped get The Whigs the attention of another Southern rocker, Dave Matthews, who runs ATO Records in New York. ATO re-released "Give 'Em All A Big Fat Lip" in 2006 and The Whigs toured nationally, playing in the cotillion of jam-band festi­vals, Bonnaroo, in 2007. The

Keep an eye out for The Whigs on their upcoming tour, since many of the tracks on "Mission Control" are just beg­ging to be let loose live by this young Southern rock band.

In a marked change from its first few albums, Sam Beam's band Iron and Wine has moved away from the hushed­lullaby song concept to a far more devel­oped sound. In their latest, "The Shepherd's Dog," the band utilizes a strong percussion element to augment intricate arrangements of vocals and instrumentals.

affair, Beam, who recorded bedtime songs for his son. Since then, Beam has added members and instruments to the band, with the progression seen clearly on the EP "Woman King" and 2005's full band record "In the Reins," which was a collaboration with Calexico. 
The band received some recognition in 2004 after the film "Garden State" came to theaters. The film, starring Natalie Portman, featured the song "Such Great Heights," a cover of the Postal Service song by the same name. 
Ever conscious of the band's simple 
origins, Beam began this album 

A more ambitious and intricate ele­ment of the album is Beam's incorpora­tion of international influences into his Americana focus. This is seen in the West African-inspired track "House by the Sea." 
Willing a spirit into the music that seems garnered straight from a night spent wander­ing through the coastal Senegalese city of Dakar, Beam begins with a wandering rhythmic pulse and then adds a haunting bass and woodwind section. It creates a feeling of evening darkness. 
Another highlight of the album is the richly composed, almost Persian sound­ing, "White Tooth Man." The song pounds along in a frantic, ominous pas­sion, which contrasts with the eerie and mischievous "Boy with a Coin." 
As noted, the album is different from Iron and Wine's previous offerings. It takes a few more listens to appreciate the extent of Beam's latest effort.

With a chilling use of Beam's emotive voice, the song moves toward its final verse, asking "Have I found you? I Flightless bird, brown hair bleeding I Or lost you? I American mouth I Big bill, stuck going down." In a tragi­

cally uplifting tone, the vocals bleed to silence as the music fades slowly behind, letting the record resolve itself into a quiet, if slightly wounded fmish. 
There isn't a bad song on the disc, with each one offering a unique perspec­tive into the mind of Beam and his tal­ented collaborators as they bring us deep into the heart of the shepherd's dog.

rebounds. 

"I definitely feel like I should be in the All-Star game," Chandler said. "I've worked hard all year, I've helped my team win basketball games and r really feel like that's what being an All-Star is all about. You should be rewarded for good basketball and winning and hopefully the coaches see it in my favor." 
The second-best center in the 
game was Hornets reserve 
Melvin Ely, who had 16 points 
and nine rebounds in 23 min­
utes. 

Peja Stojakovic hit four 3­pointers and finished with 19 points for New Orleans, and Jannero Pargo and West each scored 13 points. 
Recently elected All-Star Carmelo Anthony missed his fourth straight game with a sprained left ankle, and the undermanned Nuggets strug­gled to keep pace. 
New Orleans built a 20-point lead in the first half and main­tained that margin through most of the second half. 
Iverson's driving layups on consecutive possessions gave Denver a glimmer of hope, cut­ting the score to 91-76 early in the fourth quarter. 
But with Paul running the offense, the Hornets quickly sealed it with a 12-0 run that started when Paul set up Ely for a score inside and finished when Paul tossed an alley-oop on rookie Julian Wright's dunk. 
New Orleans ended up shoot­ing 51 percent for the game and outrebounded Denver 52-33. 
Jazz 97, Spurs 91 

The Utah Jazz were ready to push back this time against the San Antonio Spurs. 
The Jazz, who were dominat­ed by the Spurs in the Western Conference finals last spring, never trailed Monday night and held off the defending NBA champions. The game was full of collisions, hard fouls and some verbal exchanges and the Jazz countered everything the Spurs had. 
Deron Williams had 11 points and 14 assists and Carlos Boozer and Andrei Kirilenko scored 23 points each for Utah, which won its fifth straight and improved to 10-2 in January. 
The Spurs committed 20 turnovers and were just 13-for­38 from the field in the second half. 
"I think our team is playing well because that's what hap­pens when you play better defensively," Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. "It's a lot of work to play defense." 
Tim Duncan had 26 points and 11 rebounds, but was the only San Antonio starter to score more than five points. Williams smothered Tony Parker and held him to five points and three assists. 
"They were better," said Manu Ginobili, who led the Spurs with 29 points. "We turned the ball over way too much. Twenty times against the Jazz is really hard to over­come." 
The Spurs finished with 11 assists, three fewer than Williams. Boozer had seven assists and Kirilenko added four steals for the Jazz, who played a much rougher game than they did in the one-sided playoff series. 
Mavericks 103, Grizzlies 83 
The Dallas Mavericks started one of their toughest road trips of the season with an easy vic­tory. 
With three games looming against Eastern Conference division leaders, Josh Howard hit his l'irst eight shots on the way to 26 points and Dallas shot 54 percent in a victory over the lowly Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night.

NEW OHLEANS-Chris Paul nrnergnd from a serum under the basket, nimbly dribbling out to the perimeter to reset anoth­er llornets possession. 
A jubilant crowd rose to its feet, chanting, "M-V-P, M-V-P!" 
Perhaps local fans are figur­ing out tlwy don't need visits from players like Allen Iverson to bring them out to the games. They have a star of their own, not to mention one of the best teams in the NBA right now. 
Paul had 23 points, 17 assists and nine rebounds, and the New Orleans llornets ran away with their ninth straight win. 117-93 over the Denver Nuggets on Monday night. 
Down the stretch. the crowd repeatedly chanted superlatives in recognition of' a masterful performance by the Hornets' third-year guard, who is New Orleans' best hope for a repre­sentative in the All-Star game when coaches ~>.lect the reserves this week. 
Other candidates include cen­ter Tyson Chandler and forward David West, as Paul was quick to mention when asked what he thought of the MVP chants. 
"I was thinking they're exact­ly right," Paul said. "D-West and Tyson might be MVPs." 
Even in a game featuring Iverson, recently elected an All­Star starter, Paul was the best player on the floor. Iverson also scored 23, but had only three assists and got little help other than from Kenyon Martin, who scored 18. 
Hornets coach Byron Scott said he would be "shocked" if Paul wasn't invited to the All­Star game, but Paul insisted he has other short-term goals. 
"The only thing that's on my mind right now, to tell you the truth. is to get my coaches in the All-Star game," Paul said. ''I'm looking at the standings all day, every day, right now. I think that would be the greatest feeling for me if (Scott) could coach in that game." 
That will happen if the Hornets (32-12) remain in their surprising perch atop the pow­erful Western Conference until Feb. 3. 
"I am not ready to jump on their bandwagon, but they're pretty good and I'm not sure what weakness they have," Nuggets coach George Kart said. "Chris Paul is a great point guard. He can go anywhere he wants to go. They have size, they have shooters, they play as a team, they have a good bench .... One can argue that have an All-Star player at four posi­tions." 
Monday's matchup also fea­tured a pair of centers vying for a reserve spot in the All-Star game in Chandler and Denver's Marcus Camby. 
In this game, there was no comparison. Chandler finished with 10 points and 16 rebounds. Camby was a non­factor for most of the first three quarters. He didn't score until he made a free throw with 1:52 to go in the third period. He fin:

said Howard, who was 1 0-of-17 from the floor. "We had to take [the Grizzlies] seriously. It's a great start, but we've got three more to go." 
The Mavericks still have to play Boston, Detroit and Orlando on a four-game trip before returning home Feb. 6 against Milwaukee. 
Playing on Memphis' home floor really isn't that tough for the Mavericks. Dallas has won 13 straight over the Grizzlies, including a sweep of Memphis in the opening round of the 2006 playoffs. The Mavericks have never lost at the FedExForum, which opened in 2004. The Grizzlies' last home victory over Dallas was Feb. 17, 2004, in their previous home, The Pyramid. 
Dirk Nowitzki added 20 points and 11 rebounds, and Jason Terry finished with 14 points for the Mavericks, who won their fourth straight and 12th in the last 14. Erick Dampier con­tributed 11 points and 12 rebounds. 
The Mavericks were without starting guard Devin Harris and forward Jerry Stackhouse, one of their top reserves, who sat out with injuries. 
"We pride ourselves whenever we have a man down, banning together and really putting together some great efforts," Terry said.

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Roger Clemens' agent released an 18,000-word statistical report Monday to rebut allegations the pitcher's career rebound­ed about the time he was accused of using perform­ance-enhancing drugs. 
"Clemens' longevity was due to his ability to adjust his style of pitching as he got older, incorporating his very effective split-finger fastball to offset the decrease in the speed of his regular fastball caused by aging," said the report, created by Randy Hendricks and two associates at his firm. 
Clemens' former trainer, Brian McNamee, claimed in last month's Mitchell Report on drugs in baseball that he injected the pitcher with steroids and human growth hormone at least 16 times in 1998, 2000 and 2001. Clemens vehemently denies the allegations, and Clemens and McNamee are among five wi1nesses scheduled to testifY before a House committee on Feb. 13. Clemens also has sued McNamee for defama­tion. 

Hendricks' report, which includes 38 charts, in some ways resembles a salary arbi­tration case. One of the charts shows Clemens' ERA was lower than the league average in all but two of his 23 major league seasons. The report also compares variations in Oemens' career with those of Randy Johnson, Curt Schilling and Nolan Ryan, and main­tains slumps often can be cor­related with injuries. 
"Of the six years that fea­ture Oemens' best ERA mar­gins, two occurred in Boston, after he had been in the major leagues for several years; two occurred in his two years in Toronto; and two occurred after he switched leagues and pitched for the Houston Astros," the report said. 
Clemens went 40-39 in his last four seasons with the Red Sox, and when the pitcher left Boston's general manager at the time, Dan Duquette, said Oemens was in the "twilight" of his career. Clemens was 192-111 with the Red Sox and won three Cy Young Awards and an MVP, then went 162­73 with Toronto, the New York Yankees and Houston, winning four Cy Youngs. 

"Clemens was far from being in the 'twilight of his career' or 'washed up' in 1996, as some have speculat­ed," the report said. "During the 1996 season Clemens ranked first in strikeouts in the American League and tied his own record by striking out 20 batters in Detroit on Sept. 18, 1996. In addition, he ranked sixth in the AL in ERA, second in the AL in hits per nine innings, and fifth in innings pitched. This perform­ance cannot be reasonably categorized as a 'twilight."' 
"''d like to thank my parents -my dad for taking the line drives off the elbow and my mom for teaching me how to talk trash," he said.

IN BRIEF 
Ryan to return as Ravens 
defensive coordinator 
OWINGS MILLS, Md. -Rex Ryan would have preferred to be a head coach. Instead, he got the second­best thing: His old job, a new title and more responsibility. 
Ryan was hired as the assistant head coach/defensive coordinator of the Baltimore Ravens on Monday. The hire was made by new head coach John Harbaugh, who prevailed over Ryan in the team's quest to find a replacement for Brian Billick. 
The 45-year-old Ryan and the rest of the coaching staff were fired with Billick after the season. Ryan was one of six people to be interviewed for the head coaching vacancy in Baltimore, and he interviewed with the Atlanta Falcons and Miami Dolphins. 
No one offered him a job, so Ryan returned for a 10th season with the Ravens, the fourth as defensive coor­dinator. 

Mariners may trade prospect
for Bedard 
SEATTLE -The Seattle Mariners have asked top prospect Adam Jones to leave his Venezuelan Winter League team and return to the U.S., amid reports he's headed to Baltimore as part of a trade for pitcher Erik Bedard. 
Mariners spokesman Tim Hevly con­firmed Sunday night the team had requested the return of Jones, who was expected to be one of Seattle's starting outfielders when the season begins. 
"We did ask Adam to come back from Venezuela." Hevly said, declining to give a reason for the request. 
That confirmation followed Sunday's Seattle Times report that Mariners general manager Bill Bavasi was mak­ing Jones the centerpiece of a deal for Bedard. The Times, citing comments obtained from a Venezuelan newspa­per, reported Jones said he'd discussed the deal with Bavasi and was going to Baltimore on Monday for a physical. 
Tour de France champion
donates bikes to N .M. "kids 
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -Johan Bruyneel and some members of cycling team Astana gave bicycles to 25 New Mexico children. 
Bruyneel and his team, including Tour de France champion Alberto Contador and USA national road champion Levi Leipheimer, are in Albuquerque for two weeks of high­altitude training. It's the first time Astana has held a training camp in the United States. 
Bruyneel spent part of the after­noon shaking hands and giving out Trek bikes of all colors and sizes as part of a new program with Bernalillo County dubbed "Johan's Kids." 
Charles Ovis, a local training camp representative, said Bruyneel want­ed to get involved with the communi­ty and the bike giveaway was a per­fect way to encourage local children to start pedaling.

Knoblauch agrees to meet Congress 


AP Former Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch watches his game-tying home run in Game 3 of the 1999 World Series. 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Chuck Knoblauch is heading to Capitol I I ill. 
Knoblauch. a four-time All­Star who played with Hoger Clemens on the New York Yankees, agreed Monday to speak to a !louse committee investigating drug use in base­ball al'ler initially failing to respond to an invitation to tes­
tify. 
llis silence prompted the llouse Oversight and Government Heform Cornmitten to issue a subpoena last week, but federal mar­shals were not able to track down Knoblaueh right away. The 11J<Jl AL Hookie of the Year eventually did make con­tact. and his twice-postponed nwnting with committne staff for a deposition or transcribed interview will be Friday. 
That session is preparation for the panni's hearing Feb. 13, when Knoblauch is among five sdwduled witnesses, including Clmnens and his former per­sonal trainer, Brian MeNamlle. 
Also seheduled to testily are Andy Petlitte, a former team­mate and workout partner of Clemens' who also trained with McNamee. and ex-New York Mots clubhouse employee Kirk Hadomski. 
"We are pleased that Mr. Knoblauch has agreed to vol­untarily partieipate in a tran­scribed interview or deposition with thn committee. As a result, tlw committee is with­drawing the subpoena," Oversight committee chairman llf1nry Waxman and ranking Hepubliean Tom Davis said in a statement. 
Members of both majority and minority stall's declined to eomment Monday when asked for details on Knoblauch's about-faee. A lawyer identilied by a cornmittPe staffer as Knoblauch's representative did not immediately return requests for comment made via telephone and e-mail. 
Pettitte is slated to be the first Feb. 13 witness to appear for a deposition or transcribed interview, with his session scheduled for Wednesday. Clemens is to follow on Feb. 5, with McNamee on Feb. 7. Hadornski's meeting with com­mittee staff, originally sched­uled for Feb. 1, then announced as "to be deter­mined," is now listed on the committee's Web site lor Feb. 12 -the day before the hear­ing. 
Hepresentatives of baseball's players and owners, mean­while, plan to meet later this week to diseuss recommenda­tions George Mitchell made in his report on baseball's steroids nra, some of which are subject to collective bar­gaining. 
Lettnrs sent by Waxman and Davis to Clemens, Pettitte and Knoblauch on Jan. 16, requesting their appearances both at the hearing and a pre­hearing meeting, said: "The committee asks that you pro­vide testimony about allega­
tions  in  Senator  George  
Mitchell's report  ...  that you  
and  other  Major  League  

Baseball players used perform­ance enhaneing drugs during your professional baseball career." 
The Mitchell Heport, released last month, included McNamee's allegations that he injected Clemens with steroids in 1998 while they were with Toronto, and with steroids and human growth hormone in 2000 and 2001 while with New York. Clemens, a seven-time Cy Young Award winner, has repeatedly denied the accusa­tions. 
Pettitte acknowledged McNamee injected him with IIGH twice while the pitcher was recovering from an injury.

No threats for Super Sunday 
Authorities have no specific security concerns for Super Bowl 
Associated Press 

PHOENIX -The police agencies responsible for patrolling the Super Bowl say they're not aware of any threat so far. to the biggest single-day sporting event in the country, but they've organized a massive build up of security just in case. 
FBI Special Agent John Lewis said Monday that authorities have heard only "what I would call fairly rou­tine, very small incoming complaints about somebody wanting to do this or that. 
"That's very typical in these types of eases," he said. 
Nevertheless, with millions of people focused on the Super Bowl in Glendale, fed­eral security officials have again designated the game a "level one" special event. just below President Bush's State of the Union address. 
This year's Super Bowl fes­tivities also will be complicat­ed by another major sporting event, the FBH Open golf tour­nament, going on simultane­ously in Scottsdale. Security agencies have been meeting for 15 months to ensure that they keep an organized watch 
over  the entire metro  area  
this week.  
Glendale  Police  Lt.  Matt  

Apodaca said more than 800 officers from numerous city ageneies will patrol a 2­sq uare-mile security zone around the University of Phoenix Stadium. Apodaca said officers on horseback, on foot and in motorized carts will mingle with fans who are attending the game and the NFL Experience, a weeklong festival nearby. 
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will bring packs of Labrador retrievers that are trained to sniff out com­pounds that are common among most explosives. 
"We bring in our dogs 

because they are, quite 
frankly, the best in the federal 
government," ATF Special 
Agent Tom Mangan said. 
Police also have installed 

security cameras throughout 
the stadium area. Overhead, 
U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection aircraft will circle the sky and give authorities a birds-eye view of what's going on. 

U.S. 
Customs will intercept any threat from the air with Blackhawk helicopters and Citation jets based at Davis­Monthan Air Force Base, about 100 miles to the south in Tucson, said Ken Huffer, the Secret Service special agent in charge in Phoenix. 


Huffer said federal authori­

ties will enforce a 30-rnile no­
!'Iy zone around the stadium 
below 22,000 feet on game 
day. 
The no-fly zone overlaps with Phoenix Sky llarbor International Airport, but Huffer said commercial pilots have been notified and should be able to work around the new security limits. 
"I can assure you that there will be no interference with scheduled commercial air­cral't," Huffer said. 
Security officers will be feeding information to a Joint Operations Center in down­town Phoenix. Federal ol'f'i­cials, along with representa­tives of police and fire depart­ments, opened the center this week. 
Arizona Department of Public Safety Commander Mike Orose, the liaison between local public safety agencies and the NFL, said the center will help distribute rescue crews in case there is an emergency. 
If there is a bomb threat, an ATF response vehicle will be standing by near the stadium to analyze any possible explo­sive. 
Seeurity officials say they 
hope fans won't notice most of 
their efforts. But people 
attending the Super Bowl like­
ly will have to deal with more 
restrictions than they're used 
to during the regular season. 
Super Bowl officials said they will prohibit fans from entering the stadium with anything larger than a small purse or bag. They also won't allow any binoeular and cam­era cases. 
Pregame tailgaters also will 
be forbidden from much of 
the festivities they're used to. 
Fans will be allowed to tail­gate near their vehides with their own food and drinks, but they won't be allowed to have grills. 
They're also not allowed to park in more than onn park­ing spot or pitch tents in the parking lot. 
Orose said authorities start­ed working on security plans for the Super Bowl in November 2006. 
They used this year's Fiesta Bowl as a dress rnhearsal. "Our planning process, com­munications, the joint opera­tions center -it was really a whole eombination of things that we wanted to test out," Orose said. 
Orose said a joint operations center will be espeeially nec­essary for this year's Super Bowl beeause of the FB H Open and because the Super Bowl events are spread throughout the metro area. 
The only comparable sport­ing event after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks was the 2001 World Series in Phoenix, Orose said. 
That was a huge event and had a lot of media coverage, but it occurred in just one location. Orose said. 
"The NFL and the Super Bowl is a weeklong event with a series of activities taking place across the" Phoenix area. 
NBA 

Webbermayhead to Warriors 
Associated Press 

OAKLAND, Calif. -Coach Don Nelson wanl<> to bring free agent forward Chris Webber back to Golden State, nearly 14 years after a feud ended their first stint together. 
"I hope that it happens to be quite honest with you," Nelson said Sunday be!ore the Warriors beat the New York Knicks 106­
104. "I think our team needs it." 

Webber was acquired by the Warriors in a draft day trade with Orlando in 1993 after beeoming just the second sophomore ever to be the top pick in the NBA draft. He won the Hookie of the Year award and made the playoffs in his only season in Golden State. 
But Webbnr dashed with Nelson and demanded a trade before his second season, and was eventually dealt to Washington in November 1994 for Torn Gugliotta and three first-round pieks. At the time, Webber cited unhappiness over Nelson's sometimes abrasive coaching style as a main reason for his wanting out of Golden State. 
Nelson was fired shortly after the trade, only to be brought baek as Warriors coach last season. Nelson said he and Webber have talked over the years and that both men have matured since their feud more than a decade ago.

Judge lengthens restraining order 

AP Patriots wide receiver Randy Moss jokes around with team­mates before Monday's Super Bowl practice in Tempe, Ariz. 
Sanction against Moss extended to March 28 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -A temporary restraining order against Handy Moss was extended until March 2S while the New England Patriots wide receiv­er was in Arizona on Monday preparing for the Super Bowl. 
Moss' lawyer, Hichard Sharpstein. said the decision came at a hearing in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., after he learned the player's longtime friend changed attorneys. She obtained the order Jan. 14. 
Hachelle Washington's new attorney is Darrell Thompson, who replaces David MeGill. A spokesman for Thompson confirmed the change. MeGill did not return calls. 
The tern porary order required Moss to stay at least 500 feet fnim Washington. No eriminal charge has been brought, and Moss and the woman described each other as longtime friends. 
Moss has denied the accu­sation by Washington that he eommitted "battery causing serious injury" to her at her Florida home Jan. 6. Washington did not attend Monday's session, Sharpstein said. 
"He will stay completely away from her and has no desire to have contact with her," the lawyer told The Associated Press. "He's in Phoenix busy preparing to win the Super Bowl and on a day like today his mind is elsewhere." 
Moss defnnded his conduct in the Patriots' locker room on Jan. 16. Four days later, New England beat San Diego 21-12 in the AFC champi­onship game at Foxborough. For the second straight game, he caught just one pass. 
The issue. however, was quickly ovnrtaken last week 
by  the  swirl  or  attention  
around  quartnrbaek  Tom  
Brady,  who  was  spotted  

wearing a protective boot on his right foot in New York. lie didn't commnnl on it until arriVIng in Phoenix on Sunday night. 
"It's feeling good. I'll be 
rAady to go," Brady said. 
On draft day last April, the Patriots sent a 2007 fourth­round draft choiee to Oakland for Moss. lie set an NFL sea­son record of 23 touchdown catches, breaking Jerry Hiee's mark by one. lie finished tied for eighth in the league with 98 eatches and seeond with 1,493 yards receiving. 
Moss said the woman who obtained the order has been a friend for 11 years and she asked for "six figures" for what he said was an accident in which she was hurt. 
"They're false allegations, something I've been battling for like the last couple of days of threats going public if I didn't pay X amount of dol­lars," Moss said. "This young lady by no means is hurt. I didn't hurt her." 
Sharpstein said Monday that if Moss didn't agree to pay "a great deal of money" by 5 p.m. on Jan. 11, the day before the Patriots beat the Jacksonville Jaguars 31-20 in an AFC divisional playoff game, he would go public. 
"It's blackmail," Sharpstein said. "Extortion is the techni­cal crime." 
McGill issued a statement Jan. 17, saying that Moss' representatives were the first to suggest that Moss pay the woman to keep the issue quiet. 
"She has suffered mental and physical harm as a result of his actions," the statement said. "She simply wants him to take responsibility for what he has done. As a bat­tery vietim, she has shown great strength throughout this entire ordeal. 
Washington also alleged that Moss refused to allow her to seek medical treat­ment. Moss denied that. Neither MeGill nor Sharpstein has specified the nature of an injury. 
"He has acknowledged that he was at Ms. Washington's Florida residence and that he was 'guilty' of an 'accident' whieh oeeurred," the state­ment said.

Crennel agrees to extension 
Browns reward league's oldest coach after surprising 10-6 season 
Associated Press 

CLEVElAND -Coach Homeo Crennel has agreed to terms on a two-year contraet extension with the Cleveland Browns, his agent said Monday night. 
The 60-year-old Crennel, the league's oldest coach, had two years remaining on the five­year deal he signed with the Browns in 2005. !lis agent, Joe Linta. said the sides have agr11ed in principle to the exten­sion but that it has not yet been signed. 
Cnmnel began the 2007 sea­son on the hot seat after going just 10-22 in his first two sea­sons. However, Crennel, who won three Super Bowl rings as New England's defensive coordi­nator before eoming to Cleveland, guided the Browns to a 1 0-6 mark -their best since 1999 -and the club just missed making the AFC playoils. 
The extension is not a sur­prise. Last month, general man­ager Phil Savage said the Browns intended to reward Crennel for turning the team around after years of disarray. 
"He really deserves an exten­siml," rookie tackle Joe Thomas said. "lie did a great job this year and you ean see that his plan is kind of taking hold, what his vision was when he first got hired. 
"It will be nice for him to finally not feel the heat from everybody." 

Crennel's extension comes after some major turnover on his coaching staiT. 
Defensive coordinator Todd Grantham was fired Jan. 11 and replaeed by Mel Tueker, who previously coached Cleveland's secondary. Also, oil"ensive coor­dinator Rob Chudzinski, who was being considered by Baltimore as its next head coach, was given a two-year extension through 2011. 
Tucker, too, got an extension and the Browns want to have Crennel in line with his eoordi­nators. 
Linta began negotiations with Savage at the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala., last week. 
Crennel's days with the Browns seemed to be down to a few after they were drubbed 34­7 at home by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the season opener. But sparked by quarterback Derek Anderson, Cleveland quiekly turned it around, went 7-1 at home, and missed the postseason because or a tiebreaker. 
The Browns eredited Crennel's calmness, poise and guidance with getting them through a diilicult stretch. He's very popular with Cleveland's players, who awarded Crennel a game ball following a season­ending win over San Francisco. 
"He's like a father figure," defensive lineman Shaun Smith said. "I feel like he should have been eoaeh of the year. lie deserves it. The team went from 4-12 to 10-6. lie's straightfor­ward. He tells the truth." 
WNBA 

Players near new labor deal 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK-The WNBA players union neared ratifica­tion of a new six-year contract with the league Monday in a deal that includes increases in wages and a dual salary-cap system. 
Approval of the contract by the league's 165 players, a large number of whom are playing overseas, was running more than 95 percent in favor among ballots cast. About half of the players have voted. 
The collective bargaining agreement, reached Friday and announced Monday, includes an increase in the maximum salary from $93,000 to $95,000 this season, with $2,000 increases each year. Veteran minimums will increase by about $1,000 to $50,000, and rookie minimums will increase from $32,600 to $34,500 for the four-month sea­son. 
"We are happy with the way the deal turned out," said Pam Wheeler, exeeutive director of the WNBA players union. "We made significant eeonomie strides, we made some signifi­cant changes to the system, and enhanced the quality of life for players both during and after the season." 
The contract through 2013 includes an annual increase of 3 percent in the basie cap, from $722,000 in 2007 to $750,000 this year. Teams will now be allowed to exceed that figure by a maximum of approximately 4 percent each year, with the cap increasing to $869,000 in 2013, and a 'flex' maximum of $913,000. 
"We're extremely pleased to have long-term stability and to emerge from this process with a unified outlook among owner­ship and players," WNBA presi­dent Donna Orender said in a release announcing the deal. "The new collective bargaining agreement, coupled with our new television deal and increased aetivation on the part of our sponsors provides further affirmation regarding the growth, populari­ty and quality of

"I don't know if it was neces­sarily looking at that as the impetus to get things done early as much as just trying to get the deal done so the expansion draft can take place and other orders of business can be taken care of for the WNBA to run properly and be suceessful," Wheeler said. 
Rookies will still sign three­year deals with team options for a fourth year, though players will see increases of 10 percent in the third year and 15 percent in the fourth. Players will still need four years of expe­rience be

The WNBA also announced the expansion draft will be held Feb. 6 for the Atlanta Dream, the 14th team in the league. The WNBA begins its 12th season May 17 when the Los Angeles Sparks play the defending champion Phoenix Mercury on ABC. 
This is the third eolleetive bar­gaining agreement for the league. In 2003, negotiations went into late April and the five­year deal was signed less than a month before the start of the 'core' players, 
who automati­

cally receive the maximum salary. That will drop to one player starling in 2009, and each player now will be allowed to have the core des­ignation a maximum of five times. The core playnr also will receive $2,500 on top of the maximum salary.

Volleyball defeats MSU in five games 
Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame won its first match in the annual "Battle of the House of Noise" against rival Michigan State 3-2 on Saturday. 
Fueled by high-powered hit­ting by middle blocker Tim Goldberg, the Irish offense was going on all cylinders in the first game, cruising to a 25-17 victory. 
Following a verbal lashing by their coach, the Spartans came out for the second set with intensity. An early run by Michigan State left the Irish in a hole for the majority of the game. Despite superb defense by outside hitter Alex Lewis, the Irish could not make up the early deficit as Michigan State held on and took the second set, 21-25. 
Early in the third set, the Spartans held onto the momen­tum generated in the previous game. The Irish were down 17­24, facing a Spartan game point, when Iibera John Tibbie went back to serve. Following blocks by Mike Nejedly and kills by outside hitter Dan Zibton, the Irish rallied back with an 8-0 run. 
Notre Dame pushed back to regain the lead at 26-25 but were unable to keep their momentum as Michigan State proceeded to score three straight points to win the third set, 26-28. 
Notre Dame entered the fourth game needing a win and played accordingly. Starting opposite Mark Iandolo was an unstoppable force, putting down a kill almost every time he touched the ball. In a back and forth game, the Irish emerged victorious, 25-22. 
The Irish jumped out to an early 3-1 lead in the fifth set. The Spartans were able to claw back and tie the game 7­
7. The Irish took a one-point lead but needed to create a larger one. 
With a trick play signaled and a perfect pass, Mark Iandolo flew into the middle and found a net with no block­ers. Iandolo spiked the ball and killed the hopes of a Spartan win. Notre Dame controlled the rest of the game and closed the match with a 15-12 fifth set.

freshman year when she made it to the finals in the ITA Midwest Regionals. 
"She beat a series of very good players to get to the finals as a freshman," Louderback said. 
Along with those two eye­opening performances, Ciobanu led Notre Dame with 36 singles victories last year, which marked a tie for fourth­most in school history. Her dual-match winning percent­age of . 963 set one of several new Irish records. 
At one point, Ciobanu suf­fered through three straight losses, but then turned her play around to notch 24 straight wins. Coupled with her intense work ethic, it is no surprise that the sophomore now plays from the No. 1 sin­gles spot for Notre Dame. 

"Cosmina works really hard," Louderback said. "With tennis and school both. She's a pre-med and anthropology major and just works hard at everything. She always seems to get in early to get in extra hits. One thing she can really do is manage her time between academics and athlet­ics." 
This year, Ciobanu is 12-5 overall and 1-1 in dual match play and continues to exhibit consistently solid technique in both her singles and doubles matches. 
Not only is Ciobanu a bud­ding talent, but a great team­mate also. 
"Our three sophomore girls are really close," Louderback said. "Cosmina, Colleen [Rielley] and Kali lKrisik] all help each other with their game. We have good depth, and they just all feed off each other in practices and games." 
However, Ciobanu and her teammates didn't arrive where they are on their own. Junior Kelcy Tefft has been one of the upperclassmen who aided the rising talents transition into both university life and tennis. 
"Kelcy gets along with all of them real well," Louderback said. "She's been able to help them with anything they need, be it in tennis or in life." 
One aspect that separates excellent players and leaders from the pack is the ability to make one's teammates better and assist in their improve­ment. With Ciobanu, Louderback said there is no exception to the rule. 
"She just works so hard in practice that it kind of rubs off on her teammates," Louderback said. "She's an excellent role model as an ath­lete and a person."

Brady practices with slight limp 
Associated Press 
PHOENIX -Tom Brady was back where he belongs Monday, behind center for the New England Patriots' first practice session of Super Bowl week. 
The NFL's Most Valuable Player missed three practices last week with a tender right ankle, which was taped for Monday's training at Arizona State in nearby Tempe. According to the Chicago Tribune's Dan Pompei, the designated pool reporter, the star quarterback appeared to have a slight limp but partici­pated in all phases of prac­tice, including jogging the length of the field twice at the end of drills. 
Coach Bill Belichick, as usual, declined to comment on injuries or elaborate on Brady's presence. 
"Everybody practiced," Belichick said. "The injury report will be out Wednesday." 
Brady's return from an injury sustained in the AFC championship game against San Diego was a welcome sight to receiver Wes Welker. 
"Anytime the MVP of the league is back, it has to be a positive," Welker said. "He looks good -the same dim­ples and all." 
Brady talked about the ankle for the first time Sunday, shortly after arriving, and said it wouldn't be a problem for the game. 
''I'm not concerned about how it's going to affect my play," he said. "This won't keep me out." 
Nor do his teammates seem concerned. 
"I don't worry about Tom," tackle Matt Light said. "He can take care of himself. I have a bunch of guys in front of me from the Giants to worry about." 
Brady's health became an issue a week ago when he was spotted wearing a protec­tive boot on his right foot while visiting supermodel girl­friend Gisele Bundchen in New York. He sat out all three 
practices  in  Foxborough,  
Mass.,  when  much  of the  
game  plan  was  being  
installed.  
Fans  have  to  wonder  

whether the ankle will slow 


down the record-setting pass­er against the New York Giants in Sunday's NFL title game, when New England tries to become the first league team to go 19-0. 
"This won't keep me out of this game," he said Sunday, comparing the injury to a sim­ilar problem before the 2002 Super Bowl, in which he was the MVP. "That ankle didn't keep me out of the last game. It would have to take a hell of a lot more than an ankle." 
Before the Patriots headed to Arizona, Brady appeared at a departure rally at Gillette Stadium and walked without slipping on a light dusting of snow on the field. 
He also didn't limp when he arrived at Sky Harbor Airport and, later, at the news confer­ence. 
Monday's 1 hour, 40-minute workout was conducted in shorts and shells rather than full pads. The footing was good despite the recent rain. 
"We just wanted to get a good, crisp practice and work on our timing," Belichick said. "We had a lot of contact last week." 
Indeed. It was a week dur­ing which Brady's health overshadowed the Patriots moving in on the first perfect NFL season since the 1972 Miami Dolphins. Yes, the three-time champion quarter­back's persona has transcend­ed even the Super Bowl. 
"I feel energized down here to come into the hotel and to kind of start the process," Brady said Sunday night. "It is going to be a very fast week. I am not concerned about how it is going to affect my play­ing, and I can't run anyway, so it is not going to have much of an impact.

against UConn was enough to 
inspire despair in anyone. 
It wasn't that Notre Dame fell hopelessly to tlw top-ranknd team in the nation; its defense played well and the oflimse showed signs of life. The Irish managed 64 points against a team that nntered Sunday's gamn allowing only 46 points per game. But that's what makes the loss even more frus­trating. 
Aller Notre Dame got over the shell-shock of watching Iluskies freshman forward Maya Moorn drain four 3-point­ers, a jumper and a foul shot in the lirst five minutes, it got its aet togethnr and fought back.

But if they aren't falling, you need to try something else. UConn did. 
Once Notre Dame found the antidote for Moore, the Huskies funneled the ball in the lane to sophomore center Tina Charles, who scored 22 points. 
Once the Irish found that their shots weren't falling, they needed to attempt to get the ball inside. This would help the consistency that the Irish lacked against the Huskies. McGraw hinted at this concept. 
"We could have done a little better at attacking the basket," McGraw said. "I think we set­tled for too many jumpers." 
With the size the Irish have under the basket (D'Amico is 6­foot-5, Williams is 6-foot-4 and Peters is 6-foot-2), they need to make an effort to penetrate and take high-percentage shots. 
Against the No. 1 team in the country, it may not have worked, but the team needs to make the attempt.

After careful work and preparation, Bulfin and his teammates will head into the Big East meet with a 4-6 reeord, looking to reelaim the title that they won in 2005 and 2006. 
"The Big East competition is going to be tough this year, but I think Notre Dame has a great shot at winning it," Bullin said. "As a diving team everyone is performing great, so I don't think it is too far of a streteh to think that we could put six guys in the finals this year."

Brey chose to put the 6:foot­

using their height to prevent 
Villanova from getting good

they play that spot really well

Brey left well enough alone on the offensive end of the floor, running the offense through Harangody and allowing Hillesland and soph­omore guard Tory Jackson to penetrate and create open looks for junior guard Kyle McAlarney and senior for­ward Rob Kurz. In the two road losses against Marquette and Georgetown, the offense struggled, but was able to find its groove against 
.Villanova, who could not play 
defense on the level of 
Marquette and Georgetown. 
"I would give credit to a Marquette and Georgetown defense more than the failure of our offense," Brny said. "We couldn't establish our style of play. For whatever reason. maybe the inexperi­ence of Villanova, and the size of their front line, we were able to play inside-out ball with Harangody.

COMMENTARY 
Irish need to be 111ore selective 
Mufl'et McGraw must have some of the toughest toes in the business. 
On every game night, she squeezes them into tight point­ed shoes, all 
with three­inch-plus heels. Oddly enough, McGraw is most com­fortable when she assumes 

this position Bill Brink 
when her team's play Sports Writer pleases her, 
or the Irish are in a good gamn. 

She stands for timnouts, to call out plays or assignments ­and when she's angry. Against Connecticut on Sunday, she stood nearly the entire game. 
McGraw crouehnd once, at the beginning of' the seeond half' -for 43 seeonds. When fresh­man forward Devereaux Peters committed her third foul undor a minute into the hall', sh11 popped back to her feet. She didn't crouch again until the final two minut(ls, when the game was out of hand. 
I don't blame her for her frus­tration. Watching the Irish

Diver 111akes a splash in tea111 record books 
Bulfin won four state titles in high school 
By ELLYN MICHALAK and 
CHRIS DOYEN 
Sports Writers 
Junior diver Michael Bulfin is a natural-born diver. but he didn't begin exercising his tal­ent until the age of 13. 
"I got into diving through a friend who was on the local club team. 1 visited the coach one day and jumped off some platforms and decided I could get used to it," Bulfln said. 
Shortly after learning of his innate ability to dive, Bulf'in attended St. Aquinas lligh School in Ft. Lauderdale, f<la. The team won four state championships with Bulf'in on the roster and has sent three swimmers to the Olympics in recent years. During his four years at St. Aquinas, he set every school diving record. 
His decision to attend Notre Dame was influenced by his family background, academics and the chance to be under the instruction of Notre Dame diving coach Caiming Xie. 
"My dad graduated from here, and my sister attended here as well," 'Bull'in said. "Academically it is a privilege to attend here. That, eoupled with the fact that Caiming Xie coached an Olympic gold medalist and is one of the most distinguished coadws in the world, made it hard to pass up." 
Bulf'in has made the most of his opportunitins at Notre D a m e b y s e t t i n g an d t lw n again breaking the school record in the 3-meter dive 
(393.97) in consecutive weeks, a record which was previously held by Irish divPr Andy Maggio, who graduated in 2003. Bulf'in's family was there to see the diver achieve success. 
"It was great brnaking those records," B u ll'i n said. "My parents were at the meet thn
