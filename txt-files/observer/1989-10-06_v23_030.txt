Bakker is convicted 
Associated Press 
CHARLOTTE, N.C.-PTL evangelist Jim Bakker was con­victed Thursday of using his television show to defraud fol­lowers of $3.7 million, money the jury foreman said corrupted a minister who started out to do good. 
"He was called by God. But eventually the money became too much for him," said fore­man Ricky Hill, who said during jury selection that he was a Christian. "We kept looking for something from the defense and we never saw it." 
Bakker faces a maximum sentence of 120 years in prison and $5 million in fines. The U.S. District Court jury convicted him of all 24 counts in the in­dictment, which charged he oversold lodging guarantees, called "lifetime partnerships," at his Heritage USA religious retreat. 
"The message is you can't lie to the people and use television and the mails to get them to send you money," said prosecu­tor Deborah Smith. "It doesn't matter who you are or how well known you are, you simply can't do it." 
Defense lawyer George C. Davis said the verdict would be apoealed. 

Prosecutors said Bakker di­verted $3.7 million in ministry funds for personal use while knowing PTL was in financial trouble. He used money from PTL for vacation homes in Cali­fornia and Florida, a lakefront parsonage, a houseboat, Rolls­Royce and Mercedes cars and

East Germans scramble to ride freedom trains to West 
Associated Press 
HOF, West Germany-Thou­sands of East German refugees in Communist-owned trains that were locked up to bar compatriots from joining the exodus arrived in Hof early Thursday after a delay-plagued journey through Czechoslovakia and their homeland. 
Thousands of East Germans chanting "We want out!" had flocked to train stations and lined tracks in their homeland in hopes of joining their compa­triots aboard what could be the last freedom trains to the West. 
West German journalists said they heard unconfirmed reports of serious injuries when East German authorities stopped some East Germans from get­ting aboard the trains. 
Western diplomats in Prague, the Czechoslovakian capital, had speculated that attempts by East German authorities to prevent the throngs from boarding the trains had caused the delays. 
East Germans seeking to board the trains jammed West­ern embassies, swam rivers and lined railroad tracks in at least four East bloc nations Wednes­day. 
On Tuesday, East Germany's hard-line leaders had for the second time in less than a week agreed to allow safe passage to the West for thousands of would-be emigres who had massed at the West German Embassy in Prague. 
The first of eight trains that had left Prague late Wednesday arrived in this border town at 
5:50 a.m. It was believed to be carrying at least 1,000 people. 
East Berlin on Tuesday said it would allow one more exodus of disillusioned citizens, then suspended visa-free travel to

The seventh annual Senior Father/Daughter Weekend is scheduled to take place this weekend at Saint Mary's Col­lege. 
The event. titled "Father Knows Best," brings to­gether seniors and their fa­thers for various activities. Tonight's festivities kick off the weekend with a dinner dance at Union Station, a new addition to the program this year. 
Over 600 fathers and daughters will be participat­ing in the weekend event, which includes athletic con­tests, a talk by Notre Dame President Father Edward Malloy, and a mass closing the weekend on Sunday morning.

freedom at Catholic schools 

By PAUL PEARSON 
News Staff 
Catholic higher education will benefit from greater academic freedom, Father Charles Curran said at a lecture Thursday. 
Curran said "We have nothing to fear from discussion and reason" in his lecture titled "Academic Freedom in Catholic Higher Education." 
He also explained that aca­
demic  freedom  for  Catholic  
higher  education  will  be  
"ultimately  good  for  the  
Church."  

Curran is currently a visiting Firestone Professor at the Uni­versity of Southern California's School of Religion. 
In 1986, he was stripped of his professorship at Catholic University by Vatican officials for his liberal teachings on hu­man sexuality. 
Earlier this year, Curran lost a lawsuit against Catholic Uni­versity when a District of Columbia Superior Court ruled that the terms for his tenure­ship had not been violated. 

In his lecture, sponsored by the Department of Theology, Curran defended academic freedom by saying that all Catholics must. bear witness to the fact that, "Faith and reason cannot contradict one another." 
He said, "A free Catholic academy will help the credibility of the Church's tea-ching office." 
"People will be able to respect it (the Church) because it is ~illing to listen to others," said Curran. 
Curran said he wondered why the Church would, ".. .invest their resources in Catholic uni­

versities if they  are  not good  
for the Church."

WORLD BRIEFS 

The Dalai Lama says everyone has what it takes to win a Nobel Peace Prize. "In my case, I make more effort or more at­tempt to develop these good qualities, so I got this prize. But ev­eryone has the capability," said the exiled spiritual and political leader of Tibet Thursday while in Newport Beach, Calif. for a con­ference. The Dalai Lama was awarded the prize in1989. 
Twenty relatives of "disappeared" people and political prisoners stormed the Costa Rican Embassy in San Salvador and seized 19 hostages Thursday to protest against Salvadoran Presi­dent Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government. 
NATIONAL BRIEFS 

Pregnant girls no longer need parental consent before having an abortion in Florida, thanks to the state Supreme Court. The court struck down the law on Thursday in Tallahassee, just five days before lawmakers were to consider restricting access to abortions. The split decision said Florida's constitutional guaran­tee of privacy outweighed the 1988 statute requiring consent of a parent, guardian or judge for a minor's abortion.

Nor­iega, who survived a coup attempt Tuesday said he had evidence the United States planned to install Endara as president after the coup. 
A lace miniskirt worn over no underwear convinced jurors in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. that a rape victim's attire was an adver­tisement for sex, and therefore reason to acquit the defendant Wednesday. In addition, the defense attorney told jurors she agreed to have sex with the man in exchange for $100 and co­caine, but later changed her mind. 
A farmer in northwest Iowa found what appears to be part of an engine of the DC-10 that crashed in Sioux City, Iowa, offi­cials said Thursday, and more parts may be discovered as farmers harvest their crops. Officials hope that missing parts of the engine will provide clues to why United Airlines Flight 232 crashed July 19, killing 112. 
Developer Donald Trump stunned the airline world Thursday in Dallas by offering a record $7 billion for the parent company of American Airlines, capping weeks of takeover specu­lation about the nation's biggest carrier. AMH said its board would consider the proposal, which would be the biggest airline buyout ever, but indicated probable rejection.

Attack of the killer plague at Notre Dame 
I've got THE PLAGUE. 
At least, that's what I told the doctor at the 
infirmary. Much to her amusement, I might add. 
Personally, I thought it was a remarkably ac­
curate self-diagnosis, since Kleenex has been 
making a killing on this campus in the past few 
weeks. 
I knew I was in trouble when my voice was not 
at its usual level during the Purdue game. All of 
a sudden the irritating tickle at the back of my 
throat and the slight nasal congestion that I'd 
been choosing to ignore combined to impair my 
usual spirit. I was left to stare in mute admira­
tion at Purdue's Internationally Famous Golden 
Girl in all her sequined Spandex glory. 
Sure enough, in the car on the way home the 
serious hacking started. My traveling compan­
ions complained that the drive home seemed 
three times longer than the one going there, and 
I was forced to admit to myself that it wasn't 
entirely due to the traffic, but was partially 
thanks to me, sitting crammed in the corner of 
the car, docilely coughing up my lungs and 
keeping them awake. 
By Sunday night I had a full-blown case of THE PLAGUE. I couldn't laugh without having a coughing fit, and my IQ had dropped by about 100 points since the amount of oxygen reaching my brain had decreased dramatically. 
I often wonder what professors must think with all of these plague cases sitting in their classrooms. They must either think we're the most dim-witted bunch it has ever been their misfortune to teach, or we must be doing their egos a world of good as we stare back at them, open-mouthed in apparent amazement at the wonders they are disclosing to us. Little do they know that we are merely trying to salvage what's left of our addled brain cells by inhaling oxygen through our mouths. 
There is a positive side to this inability to breathe, though. Think about it, fellow suffer­ers. When's the last time you could smell the odors emanating from the dining hall? 
My own PLAGUE case was problematic enough to warrant a pilgrimage to the cutting edge of modern medicine-THE INFIRMARY. 
The mere fact that I allowed my friend John to escort me there voluntarily must be a measure of how many IQ points I've lost, since when I have full command of my intelligence the mere mention of doctors fills me with extreme misgiv­ings. I think that stems from years of visiting the family physician, whom we have christened 'Quack.' Doctors inspire confidence in my very soul.

'I often wonder what professors must think with all of these plague cases sitting in their classrooms.' 
Alison Cocks Production Manager 
Before I knew it I was in the presence of one of the quacks employed by the infirmary listen­ing to her chuckle over my self-diagnosis as she asked me if I had experienced any other strange ailments. 
Well, doctor, to tell you the truth, we were thinking of starting a leper colony when THE PLAGUE blows over. 
This doctor knew what she was doing, though. She realized that there is nothing anyone can do to relieve the symptoms of THE PLAGUE, that the best possible solution is to employ hard drugs to ensure that not only do sufferers for­get their ailments, but also that they have a nose and lungs to begin with. 
I would strongly recommend this option to all fellow sufferers. The doctor will forewarn you that ingestion of this particular medicine will preclude any alcohol intake. Just nod intelli­gently. You won't need alcohol. 
I took this medicine for the first time on Tuesday and am just starting to realize that there is a world around me. My colleagues at The Observer are ready to write this doctor a thank-you-note, I'm sure, for putting me so out of commission that they could have laid out the entire front page upside-down without my noticing. Their egos have been safe for three whole days now. 
Not only that, I feel I have gained invaluable insights into Vanna White's character. Remem­bering the alphabet is hard. 
The beauty of it is, no one carded me at the door of the infirmary, and all I have to do to re­new my prescription is barf up a lung. 
Maybe this PLAGUE thing isn't so bad after all. I could discover how surreal the world really is. The sympathy factor for me is sky-high at the moment. If only they knew ...

GSU to host conference 
By JOE MOODY News Staff 
Approximately 70 graduate leaders from 22 schools around the Midwest are expected to attend the Midwesf Region Conference of the National Association of Graduate and Profes­sional Students (NAGS). 
The event, which begins today and continues until Oct. 8, is hosted by the Graduate Student Union. 
"The GSU assumed the responsibil­ity of hosting this event in an attempt to increase Notre Dame's visibility among its peer graduate institutions," said GSU President Luis Canales. 
The key note address will be given by Thomas Linney, chairman of the Council of Graduate Schools on Saturday at 2:30 p.m. Linney will dis­cuss legislative issues affecting gradu­ate students. 
There will be day sessions con­ducted by graduate leaders covering a variety of topics. Regional coordinator Kevin Boyer of Northwestern Univer­sity, will discuss the traditional view of a minority student and how ·organiza­tion should facilitate interaction. 
Linda Taylor, founder of Notre Dame's Women's Resource Committee, and Alexis Walker of Saint Anselm's College will discuss women in academia as well as how to go about organizing a productive women's group. 
Teaching assistant development and training will be addressed by Sue Fust of the University of Minnesota. Luke Evans of Ohio State University will dis­cuss NAGS promotional strategies for the upcoming year, including new ideas for the membership. 
The conference will be an excellent 
opportunity for the faculty, administra­
tors and graduate students of the Uni­
versity to interact with student leaders 
of graduate schools throughout the 
Midwest, said Caneles. 

The conference, to take place in the Center for Continuing Education, will begin with a welcome from University President Father Edward Malloy on Saturday at 10 a.m. The initial regis­tration begins today from S-7 p.m. in the main lobby of the CCE.

Scientist relates science to art in lecture 
By ROBERT KELLY News Staff 
In his lecture "One Culture," Roald Hoffman, professor of physical science at Cornell Uni­versity, sought to show the close relationship between science and arts. 
Hoffman, a 1981 Nobellau­reate in chemistry, titled his lecture after a C.P. Snow essay which presented the view which Hoffman sought to disprove. 
In his lecture, the first of a two-part series, Hoffman bases his argument on his opposition to C.P. Snow's description of the fields of science and hu­manism as "two polar groups" mutually ignorant of each other. 
Hoffman, however.. said ~e 
sees the two as bemg qmte

methods, although these simi­larities might not be readily no­ticed without careful scrutiny. 
By presenting an example of work in chemistry, poetry and painting, Hoffman exhibited many ways in which these seemingly detatched fields are similar to each other, most im­portantly in the areas of their foundations, the communica­tion of their ideas, and, thus, their purposes. 
Hoffman said that neither a work of science nor a work of art is totally original in its foundations. In the same way that a scientist "stands on the backs of giants" when he bases his new molecular theory on the work of Isaac Newton, an artist does so by imitating the 
styles and themes of Rembrandt 
in his paintings. 
Under~aniling that the veryfoundations of science are simi­lar to those of art, is the first step in proving that "the rift between scientists and technol­ogists on the one hand and hu­manists on the other" is not as great as it might at first seem. 
According to Hoffman, how­ever, the similarities do not end here. The importance of com­munication in both fields is equally comparable. 
In the world of science, an American chemist will relay his theories to an English chemist and a German one, in order to find his goal. Communication in the arts is just as vital, H<>ff­man said. 
Hoffman said he realizes that an artist's main purpose in painting a portrait and a poet's main goal in writing a poem is to communicate his or her ideas to the world. 
In these ways, the artist and the scientist share the same purposes of foundation and communication, he said. 
In conclusion, Hoffman said that art and science are really much more similar than they look. Hoffman summarizes his own views by stating that the arts and the sciences are truly parts of one united culture and that this is the time "to praise the achievements of the human mind" as a whole.

papal decree concerning the 

r role of c'atholic universities in the Church, Curran called the document, "totally unsatisfac­tory," beoause it ~ould only al­low Catholic universities a lim­ited amount of freedom in the context uf t.he Church's teach­ings. 
The decree does not allow for the complete academic freedom that Curran feels is required if Catholics universi­ties do not want to lose their Catholic character, as many Protestant educational facilities have, he said. 
In conclusion, Curran pointed out that the Catholic Church can easily benefit from aca­demic freedom since free Catholic universities are "where the Church can maintain con­tact with the modern world."

Judge Robert Potter. The judge set sentencing for Oct. 24. 
''I'm going to keep my faith in God and I'm going to go see Tammy now. I feel sad but en­couraged in God," Bakker said, smiling in a brief midafternoon statement to reporters. He said he was "still innocent of the charges against me." 
Potter said he granted bond reluctantly because Bakker faithful had a "Jim Jones men­tality" and might help him flee the country. 
"They think he could walk on water," Potter said. Davis declared the reference to the 1978 murder-suicide of 
900 followers of Jim Jones' cult in Jonestown, Guyana, "horrible, absolutely uncalled for." 
Bakker showed little emotion as the verdict was read. Tears welled in the eyes of Mrs. Bakker, who also received large bonuses from PTL but was not charged with any crimes. 
The jury foreman said he was unswayed by Bakker's testi­mony, in which he defended his earnings as reasonable for someone who raised millions of dollars for the work of the Lord.

This weekend, the mighty Fighting Irish of Notre Dame will find themselves facing an opponent of such strength, such power, such magnitude, that it could only be ... a tree? Yes, its time once again for the classic match-up between Stan­ford and ND. It can only mean the return of that arboreal sen­sation, the Stanford Tree. Don't call him a mascot, he'll tell you that's for the Cal Bears. He's a symbol for the school, representing more than simply athletic spirit. He is that entity which embodies the liberal mood of Stanford. He's Gil Blank. 
As a senior in a New Jersey prep school, he had his dream of attending an M.I.T. or Har­vard and remaining in the East. Fed up with the college admis­sion system, and overcome with senior apathy, he sent this pic­ture along with his application to Stanford and wrote "A pic­ture is worth a thousand words." He was accepted im­mediately. Not knowing what to expect from the West Coast bastion of liberal academia, Gil kept his mind open, looking for something which would make his college experience meaning­ful.

If you are looking for some­thing different to do this Satur­day night, why not visit South Dining Hall? From 9 p.m. to 1 
a.m. the Multicultural Execu­tive Committee, with the sup­port of the SUB, is hosting the Taste of Nations. The event is the culmination of a week long festival that started last Sun­day. This is the fourth year of Multicultural Fall Festival, which is intended to promote the sharing of cultures and ethnic backgrounds, while also having fun. 
One of the week's events con­sisted of daily fireside chats, informal lunchtime talks with different speakers about their cultural experiences. If you couldn't make the Fireside Chats, perhaps you noticed the "Culture on the Quad," which consisted of various stands sponsored by the different eth­nic organizations on campus . If you missed both lunchtime events, you may have noticed the live entertainment from various cultures around the world. Performances were featured on the Fieldhouse Mall from 4:30 to 6:30 in the after­noon throughout the week. 

The entertainment doesn't end there, because tonight from 
7:30 to 9 p.m. folk singer and comedian, David Lippman, will be performing at Theodore's. 


Want to know how to get into a major university? Ask Gil Blank, who submitted his admission's application. Blank portrays the symbol of Stanford University, th~ 



He will bring humor and music  
from Central America, and like  
all the events of the week, this  
one is also free of charge.  
The finale of this week-long  
festival, The Taste of Nations,  
will be held on Saturday night  
from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. in the  
South Dining Hall.  
The event will featun~ thP  
cuisines of eight different re­ 
gions of the world. For exam­ 
ple, the nations of Scandinavia  
will be represented by such  
delectables as chocolate fon­ 
due, cheese fondue and various  
seafood delicacies.  
For those who crave sweets,  
pastries form France, Italy,  
and Greece will be offered at  
several booths. Baklava, a  
light flaky pastry filled with  
nuts and coated with cinnamon  
syrup is one of the Grecian pas­ 
tries that will be served. Other  
assorted desserts such as  
eclairs, petit fours, lady fingers.

Lyght bets on success 
By MARY GARINO 
Sports Writer 
Todd Lyght is a man on a mission. 
Lyght, the starting short cornerback, wants an interception every game this year. Or, at the very least, he wants to have more interceptions than teammates Stan Smagala, Pat Terrell and D'Juan Francjsco. So far, he's right on track for both goals. 
"We have a little contest between the sec­ondary," Lyght says. "Last year, Pat Terrell led the team in interceptions as far as the sec­ondary is concerned, and this year I'm in the lead. Pat got one against Purdue, and so we were giving Stanley Smagala and D'Juan Fran­cisco a hard time. They have to buy dinner after the games until they get one." 
Lyght has been credited with an interception in every game so far this season, and he hopes to keep it up for the rest of the year. If anyone can do it, Lyght can. His athletic ability and 4.40 speed make him one of the best cornerbacks in college football. · 
"Even my wife says to me every week, 'Boy, that Todd Lyght's a great athlete,"' says Irish head coach Lou Holtz. "I think Todd Lyght dur­ing the summer made some decisions on what he was going to do with his life. I might be wrong, but I think he made a decision to be out­standing." 
Todd and some of his fellow teammates did indeed make a commitment to the team over the summer. They decided that one national championship wasn't enough, and they want at least one more. 
"We knew we had the capability to do it, and great coaching," Lyght says. "We knew what it was like to win, and so we made the commitment to strive to be the best we can be." 
Lyght was a highly recruited high school Todd Lyght (1) bats down a pass.

LAST WEEK 
WEST LAFAYETTE -Notre Dame's top­ranked Fighting Irish spent a week hearing people question their abilities after last weekend's near-upset loss to Michigan State. 
Then they went out and answered just about every one of them in a 40-7 rout of a pitiful Purdue team that committed eight turnovers Saturday at Ross-Ade Stadium. 
In a game similar to last year's 51-7 rout of Purdue, the Irish jumped out to a 34-0 
alftime lead, outgaining the Boilermakers 'H4-93, before letting their reserves get some 
arne experience in the final 30 minutes. 
"They're the most talented group I've seen ut together in a long time, maybe the best ver." said Purdue coach Fred Akers, who 111s been a head coach since 1975. "They are ~I early the number-one team in the country." 




The Game... 
By THERESA KELLY 
Sports Editor 
Stanford's nickname is a Cardinal, its mas1;ot is a tree, and itg offense is one big ques­tion mark. The Cardinal (1-3) host top-ranked Notre Dame (4-0) to try to gflt back in gear before plunging back into the Pac 10 season. 
Stanford has won its only home contest thus far this sea­son, a 18-17 win ovpr Oregon, but has lost to Arizona and Oregon Stato, and a wild loss last week to San Jose State 33­
40. Stanford is so bad, accord­ing to ABC Sports, and Notre Damn so good, that the game just wasn't good enough for the network to show.  
Irish head coach Lou lloltz, of course, isn't so suro of a Notre Dame blowout. 
"Stanford is not an easy place to play in," Irish head coach Lou Holtz said. "I think we'll see a very fin performance from Stanford. As for being number one, I think we're smart enough to realize we're in a vory pmcarious position." 
This is the first year at Stan­ford for lwad coach Denny Green, who took over for Jack Elway aftP-r serving as the San Francisco 49ers receivers coach. 
Stanford defense vs. Notre Dame offense 
The Cardinal has had some problems on defense this sea­son, allowing 96 points in four games, including the 40 given up against San Jose State. Stanford returned eight starters on defense, including left tackle Lester Archambeau, who has 212 total tackles in his career and has accumulated 17 quarterback sacks. Th 6-5, 260-pound senior has amasses 21 tackles in four games this year. 
"Stanford has three different football players in Archambeau, (Kevin) Scott and (Alan) Grant who might go in the first round of the professional draft," Holtz said. 
Grant, a 5-10, 187-pound, anchors the secondary and pulls double duty as a punt re­turner for Green's team. Grant has three career interceptions and has 118 tackles in three years of play. Junior Kevin Scott, a 5-11, 182-pound lightweight at cornerback, has 18 tackles this season. 
The big surprise for Stanford has been sophomore free safety Tony Trousset, who leads the team in tackles with 34, includ­ing one sack, and has one of

the team's two interceptions. 
The Irish offense returned to 
form last weekend, scoring 40 
points against Purdue after 
sputtering against Michigan 
State. The key to Notre Dame's 
offense is quarterback Tony 
Rice. 
"One thing Tony Rice always does is bring a positive attitude to the field," Holtz said. "He adds so much to our football team. I can't begin to mention it. He's an outstanding quar­terback-not a great athlete, but a great quarterback. He's just getting better and better. 
"Just to think about being without Tony Rice is rather frightening. We've never had a player play as great a role as Tony Rice." 
Rice's numbers are beginning to back him up. He is 20-2 as Notre Dame's starting quar­terback, and has hit 43-of-28 passing for the year for 513 yards. On the ground, he has rushed for 294 yards on 52 carries, scoring two touch­downs. 
But Rice doesn't do it alone. Fullback Anthony Johnson, one of the best in the country in short yardage situations, has scored five Irish touchdowns and gained 216 yards on 59 
carries. When the Irish take to the air, Raghib Ismail (11 catches, 241 yards) and Ricky Watters (six catches, 110 yards) are Rice's key targets. Tight end Derek Brown has been more involved in the of­fense of late and has five catches for 104 yards. 
Notre Dame defense

Stanford offense 

Green switched the Stanford 
offensive scheme from the run­
and-shoot to a pro-style set. 
"Last year they had some success against us," Holtz said. "But it's not the type of offense, it's the way people execute." 
Steve Smith and Brian John­son have split time at quarter­back, an injury to Johnson giv­ing Smith the chance to start. Smith shone in the San Jose State loss, throwing for 384 yards, most of those caught by wide receiver Ed McCaffrey. 
On the ground, Stanford is hurting, with four of its top five running backs hobbled with in­juries. 
Notre Dame's defense is led by linebacker Ned Bolcar, who has 37 tackles, three for loss, and two sacks this year.

Layden, Crowley, Stuhldreher 
and Miller. 
In their final game together, the legendary "four Horsemen" of Notre Dame were victorious. They galloped a way with a 27­10 win over Stanford in the 1925 Tournament of Roses. Knutn Hockne's squad capped a perfect 1 0-0 season as the Irish won tlwir first-ever national championship.

"Wiwn it came right down to it. I knew deep inside that Notrn Dame was the school for me, and so far it's been right," Lyght. who is enrolled in Arts and Letters, says. "And from the first day of practice, I re­member being a freshman, go­ing out playing, I knew that from day one, I could compete on the college level and be suc­cessful." 
Lyght's confidence was im­mediately put to the test after two members of the secondary, Brandy Wells and Corny Southall, both went down with knee injuries during his fresh­man year. Lyght found himself playing in all twelve games of

downfield to set up the game's first score-a 27-yard field goal by Murray Cuddeback. 
The second quarter featured the "Elmer Layden Show," as the skinny fullback rushed for one touchdown and returned a 78-yard interception for a sec­ond score. Layden, known as the fastest man in football, gave his team a 13-3 advantage going into the locker room. 
Midway through the third stanza, Notre Dame's Ed Hun­singer picked up a loose ball after a fumbled punt and ram­bled in for the touchdown. But the Indians struck right back as halfback Ed Walker con­nected with Ten Shipkey in the endzone to cut the Irish lead to 20-10. 
The, in the fourth quarter, Stanford was threatening from the Irish 8-inch line. But a stingy Notre Dame defense managed a memorable goalline stand and prevented the Indians from scoring. The victory was secured on the ensuing Stanford series when Layden returned his second intercep­tion for a touchdown. 
That Notre Dame team was considered by many to be the most alert squad ever to play the game. Much of its success was due to· the impeccable chemistry that the "Four Horsemen" displayed when they were on the field together. 
The Horsemen re-minded ev­eryone that football games aren't won on talent alone. They're won on strategy, wit, and, most of all, teamwork.

his first season. and he liked it. 
"It was a good learning expe­rience for me, being able to play so early," Lyght says. "It has helped me mature as a ballplayer." 
Among his favorite plays from his freshman campaign are his interception in the Michigan State victory, and a blocked punt in the Pittsburgh game that sparked a comeback even though the Irish eventually lost. 
Since then, the defense has relied on Lyght for his pass de­fense skills. During the national championship season, Lyght broke up nine passes and col-Iected 36 tackles, earning Asso­ciated Press honorable mention as an All-American. Before this year began, he was rated as the best cornerback in the country by The Sporting News. 
Lyght started every game last year except the opener against Michigan. He is part of the Irish defense that has dom­inated games so far in 1989, and saved games when the of­fense has been less than per-feet. 
"1 think our defense is im­proved upon last year." Lyght

notes. "Ail of the guys that we have now, we've played to­gether, and there is a real closeness on the team. I think that showed during the Michi­gan State game. The offense wasn't doing too well, and we just looked at each other, and said, we have enough points to win this game, let's just go out and win it." 
The defense is good, but that doesn't mean that there is no room for improvement. Lyght credits Chuck Heater, the coach of the secondary, with improv­ing his skills as a football player. And Heater says that Lyght's willingness to learn has contributed to his game. 
"He has to continue to be a consistent player. He has been a very consistent guy here in his practice habits, and it has ear­ried over into the game. He just needs to maintain the consis­tency from a practice stand­point," Heater says. 
Lyght says that he is just taking the season one game at a time. As far as his goal of getting an interception every game, he realizes it is difficult to accomplish. But in the mean­
time, he's getting a lot of free dinners from his teammates. Notre Dame's interception leader, Todd lyght.

IRISH EXTRA 
Terrell 
continued from page 1 
Chuck Heater, who coaches the defensive backs, explains. "We moved Pat because of a need we had at free safety. We were looking for an individual we thought would help us, and Pat is an outstanding athlete. (Defensive Coordinator) Barry Alvarez said that the first player we should consider mov­ing to defense should be Pat Terrell, and he's worked out very well." 
Terrell possesses a rare, ex­plosive combination of strength and speed which helped him make the transition quickly and painlessly. He runs the 40-yard dash in 4.35 seconds and yet is owerful enough to stand up to 
running backs who charge into the defensive backfield with a full head of steam. 
"In the beginning I thought Pat had trouble with the heavy contact on defense," admits Stan Smagala, the Irish cornerback who doubles as Terrell's roommate, "But he became very aggressive as he learned the position and devel­oped into one of the hardest hitters on the defense." 
The switch to free safety also entailed a new responsibility for Terrell. He became the sig­nal-caller for the defensive backs. shouting out coverage assignments to the corner­backs. This new duty created some problems for Pat at first. 
"Last year it was really hectic for the rest of the guys," con­cedes Terrell "Stan Smagala 
and Todd Lyght would yell like crazy for their calls, but I didn't know what to tell them. 


Pat Terrell But over the summer I had a lot of time to learn the schemes and now I know them like the back of my hand." 
Heater agrees. "Last year it was difficult for him to call the signals, but this year he has a lot more confidence. Pat does very well with the adjustments now." 
He'll have quite a few signals to call this weekend against Stanford. Since their offensive backfield has been raval!ed by 
injuries, the Cardinal will likely bombard the Irish secondary with a pass-oriented offense. Irish fans recalling earlier games against Michigan and Michigan State might worry about whether Notre Dame's pass defense is equal to the task, but Terrell would like to set their minds at ease. 
"When a team is completing passes, everybody always wants to blame the secondary," he charges, "But the fact is that we are doing pretty well. Teams are going to complete some passes. We want to make sure that if the receivers do catch a pass, they remembm where they caught the ball. " 
Terrell thinks the Irish de­fense will stay out of trouble against Stanford's aeronautic exposition. "They have a very explosive offense, and they have obviously perfected the forward pass, but we'll try to limit what they can do. Our personnel matches up well with them man for man." 
In fact, the Irish match up against Stanford much better than they did last year against Miami. But Pat Terrell would rather not think about that.

nford mascot fans laughing 


is picture along with Tree. 
the "Tree" his freshman year, who along with the entire band decided to parade through the library one evening, Gil knew he had found his destiny. He would carve his niche at radical Stan­ford. He would be the Stanford Tree. 
After being chosen 'best wood on campus' and destroying the old Tree's uniform (a require­ment) Gil constructed his own using two mattresses, green c~t.rpeting , and felt. Says Gil, "Babes love foam and felt." What 'kind' of tree is Gil? "I am not 'any' tree," he says, "but I am the 'Anytree. 'All trees can feel angst and pathos through me." He describes himself as "the Ideal Tree, through which all other trees are mirrored." This ideal tree is a combination of "orgiastic furor, hormonal imbalance, and aerobic train­ing," which leads Gil to claim that he, "likes to germinate as often as possible." He claims he also has had to increase his intake of life-essential liquid with the rest of the band. He doesn't do chlorophyll, though, the NCAA forbids it. 
He finds his work paradoxi­cal, as he looks to establish some tradition, in a school with almost none. Their old symbol, the Indian, was dissolved in the 60s, following students protesting its racist overtones. In the following years of anar­chy. the mascot changed yearly with no clear form. The Band finally decided it would borrow the 'Palo Alto' from the Univer­sity shield, and so the Tree was born. Gil wants to make the Tree a well-known symbol of Stanford among the college cir­cuit and will use any means to do so. He plays with other mascots, like the Beavers of O.S.U., who recently chased him with a chain saw and threat­ened to 'stump' him. 
Gil says he's excited to meet with the Leprechaun and re­spects the tradition at NO. He doesn't feel animosity towards any mascot, and enjoys the fra­ternity among the mascots who, "understand symbolic ri­valry." He has had to learn a few things though, like running around with a hundred-pound suit on and playing with the children who approach him. He advises other saplings to, " "branch out into something 
bigger" and not, "pine away their existence." Gil takes no definite stand on environmental issues such as the rain forest and recycling, but he takes his position seriously as the quintessential symbol of his in­stitution. When you see him raising his limbs to the crowd on Saturday, Gil hopes you'll remember this: "Be Tree ... and I am not an asparagus."

review 
POGUES 

The Pogues find 'Peace and Love' 
DAVID DESALLE 
accent writer 
"Peace and Love," the latest album by the Pogues, features bold experimentation. This is a new addition to the fine rollick­ing music, that bridges the gap between Irish folk songs and the Clash, which fans have come to expect. 
Surprisingly, Shane Mac­Gowan, who co-wrote most of their popular 1988 release, "If I Should Fall From Grace With God" with band member Jem Finer, is credited with only six of the fourteen tracks on this album. He also shares his du­ties as lead vocalist with the other seven members, who typi­cally sing in the songs they wrote themselves. MacGowan continues to distinguish himself as the band's most accom­plished songwriter and takes credit for the record's most outstanding cuts. 
"Down All The Days," may be the finest song on the album. It is one of the band's experimen­tal efforts that is truly memo­rable. It creates a mood of yearning and has a mesmeriz­ing tune. The song shows a de­parture from the Pogues' tradi­tional sound, resembling some­thing the Mighty Lemondrops might play. 
Other outstanding songs are "Boat Train," in which Mac­Gowan sings through clenched his inebriated travels. Another experimental tune is "USA," which features a psychedelic ending after verses throbbing with energy. It is the sort of song that U2 would wish they had recorded. 
A disappointing tune is "Lorelei," by guitar/mandolin player Philip Chevron. Chevron sings this ephemeral duet with Kristy MacColl, whose perfor­mance is not as impressive as in "Fairytale of New York," her duet with MacGowan on last 
year's album. Chevron has writ ten much better songs in the past. "Blue Heaven," another experimental song, is also un­successful. A skipping, jazzy melody and playful bass work for XTC, but do not produce th same result when Philip Chevron and Daryl Hunt use it for the Pogues. 
"Night Train To Lorca" is a dark, driving account of a noc­turnal train ride that banjo player Jem Finer, should be proud of. He also is to be ap­plauded for the chilling dirge, "Tombstone." 
The Pogues and their fans should be pleased with "Peace and Love." Although, some of the band's experiments are not successful, this is a fantastic album. The Pogues have main­tained their unique sound while exploring new styles.

The Taste of Nations has brought a wide variety of appe­tizing cultural foods to Notre Dame in the past, and this year the event promises to be as spectacular as previous years. A walk to South Dining Hall before, in between, or after parties, will be a worthwhile and fun trip to make. 

What better way to satisfy those late night hunger attacks than by attending a festival dedicated to food? An SYR is no reason to miss this spectac­ular event. In fact it might be a great way to begin or end an evening with your date.

Birthday gripes: censorship and nonsmokers 
I'm about to offend many good people whose good will and respect I would appreciate having. That makes me sad, be­cause it's the eve of my birthday and I'll need all the friends I can get as I crawl down the fi-
Letters to a Lonely God 
like a wimp. 
In my opinion, " The Last Temptation of Christ" is far less offensive than the alleged message of Medjugorje. Medju­dorje is based on a totally 

nat stretch to my grave. 
Dylan Thomas' great impera­tive was, "Do not go gentle into that good night/Old age should burn and rave at close of day;/Rage, rage against the dying of the light./DO NOT GO GENTLE INTO THAT GOOD NIGHT!" 
I'm not that close to the ever­lasting nap, not by a long chalk, but as a dress rehearsal for my exit speech -still many years away, I trust-when I may be ranting and raving like King Lear, I want you to know I've been bristling with bad temper over the things I read in The Observer. 
I think "The Last Temptation of Christ" is one of the least deeply offensive movies that Hollywood has made about Christ. He's one of the great ligures of world literature, for heaven's sake. Do churches, Catholic or Protestant, have a copyright on the way the world should be allowed to imagine or understand Him? 
You should have seen the production that's known in the trade as, "I Was The Teenage Jesus," which brought snickers from the reviewer in Time for showing the Lord on the cross with carefully shaved armpits. fixing Him up to resemble the picture on a holy card can be more deadly than satire. Holly­wood doesn't do Christianity's founder any favor when they sentimentalize Him into looking cynically trashes the Covenant of Grace, no matter how charmed the pilgrims are when they meet those adorable Yu­gosiav moppets, who, for all I know, should have been audi­tioned to play the children in "The Sound of Music." But, that's what last week's outrage was about. 
This week I'm ready to pound the pavement into a quagmire over a subversive statement which appeared on the front page of last Monday's Observer, "Being able to smoke is not a right, but having a smoke-free environment is." 
Millions of Americans feel they have a God-given right to smoke, just as millions of Frenchmen feel they have a God-given right to make love. Frenchmen in Paris, they say, reserve the right to smoke when they make love, or to make love when they smoke, which ever excites them the most. 
Smoking first became patri­otic in 1917, when the American Red Cross started showing up at the ports of embarkation, to hand out fags to the "boys" who were going to fight "over there." 
On one hand Surgeon-General Koop wants America to go smokeless. On the other hand, he favors handing condoms to our kids at about the age they are weaned, which goes to show that one man's meat is

another man's poison. 

Does the fresh-air fiend quoted in the press realize that having rights is a two-way street? As a smoker, I d_irty the air in the room where I live, but I don't have a car license or know how to drive, and I don't own a car, which could dirty the air much more lethally than my cigarettes do. If I promise not to smoke, will the non­smoker promise not to drive a car to places on and off-cam­pus, which he could walk to, as I do, poisoning the quads with fumes that my dog and I must breathe in, if we leave the win­dows open? If protecting the environment is the name of the game, shouldn't I have the right to insist that hundreds of stu­dents leave their cars in the parking lots, instead of using them for anything as unneces­sary as a beer-run? 
Remember the mutual for­bearance we had to practice as children, when each of us felt possessive and protective of his or her favorite toys? To keep peace among the siblings, our parents told us, "Brother won't touch Sister's doll, if Sister promises to keep her cotton­pickin' hands off Brother's red fire truck." 
Maybe the Christian adults at Notre Dame should practice the golden rule from the romper room. I will not question your rights as a driver, unless you start insisting that my rights as a smoker don't exist. 
The trouble is that drivers, imagining themselves to be in the catbird seat, don't feel obliged to reach compromises with the much-harassed nico­tine addicts. Where do drivers think the smog comes from that is choking our cities to death? 

If smokers alone were re­sponsible for stinking up the planet, I would freely admit that though I'm one of them, smokers deserved to be hanged. But, everyone contributes to the pollution that will kill us all. 
Next to cars, industry is the greatest offender, defiling the lakes, the rivers, the earth we walk on and the heavens over our heads. Planes sicken the sky where the birds used to fly and the government is com­mandeering dumps in the sea, where they can unload the atomic waste which will eventu­ally make the fish radioactive. 
In South Bend, we're treated 
to the nauseating stench of the 
Ethanol plant. I can get sick to 
my stomach when I stand close 
to people who don't wash, or to 
some who do, if they use Right 
Guard. I can get sick dancing 
with a lady doused with scents 
from the cosmetics counter at 
Harrod's in London. No woman 
has the "right" to pour all the 
perfumes of Arabia on one little 
hand, to make herself more 
fragrant than a garbage truck. 
When I go to old tenements to make sick calls during summer, I sometimes get sick from the odors that hang in the hall­ways, from the cabbage that was cooked yesterday or a week ago, or from the rotting mice that died in the wall. Maybe it's poverty I smell, or the unsavory consciences of the slum landlords who charge high rents on these fleabag, flop-house, fire traps, but who gets in a sweat to put them out of business? 
I can get sick from the ex­cessive amount of incense that priests use at Mass, and who hasn't gotten sick from the odors left in restrooms by users who don't bother to flush after they've used the john? 
Of all the crime that goes on in cities like New York and San Francisco-drug sales, mug­gings, gambling, prostitution, child abuse, pornography, rapes-the only law that can be strictly enforced is the one that makes smoking a crime. So now the cops feel free to push smokers around, to put them in jail in place of the heavies to whom threats of law and order can't nail. 
Do the police, waiting at air­ports to arrest the scofflaw who lit up in the lavatory, think they're making the friendly skies friendlier or safer from equipment failure, hijacking, terrorism or pilot error? These are the horrors the flight at­tendants should try to save us from, instead of hassling the frightened passenger who has a nicotine fit because the aircraft has blundered into potholes on the skyway. 
Listen, prayer partner. I'll do my best not to foul your per­sonal space, ruin your health or marry your sister. I'll be happy to stay out of your way when I enjoy cigarettes. But, don't get any ideas that as a smoker, I don't have a leg to stand on, or 
you should see the one on the bear skin rug 
Love, the whole family. 
that my right to smoke is a 

freedom you can deprive me of. 
America, the beautiful, is my 
home too, and I'm not a sec­
ond-class citizen, whom you 
can treat like poor-white trash 
that should hide in a swamp. 
Actually, whether you like it 
or not, you're in debt to the 
smokers. The exorbitant ci­
garette taxes we're charged 

pay quite a few of the country's 
bills. 
All the wars in this century 
have been fought by smokers. 

We could have lost either of the 
world wars if the doughboys 
and G.l. Joes hadn't had their 
butts to fall back on. If smok­

ing should go out of style, we'd 
have to reinvent the habit when 
war comes again. 

Millions of Americans smoke, 
millions more survive on tran­

quilizers, after giving up smok­
ing. Do you think Ike's army 

could have stormed the beaches 
in Normandy if the troops had 

been relying on Librium, instead 
of Lucky Strikes, as a crutch? 
I know bloody well that 
smoking is a health hazard. 
When I was hospitalized with a 
heart condition two years ago, 
my doctor said, "Half your 
trouble is caused by ci­
garettes." Earlier, he warned 
me how smoking afflicts the 

lungs, which can keep on work­
ing until they're 70 percent 
ineffective. "After that," he 
said, " you'll find yourself in 
trouble." 

I know the risks, so spare me 
the lectures. I also know that 
life itself is a succession of 
tradeoffs. Cigarettes have 

helped me make a friend out of 
loneliness. I don't feel alone as 

long as I can smoke. To give up 
smoking is like losing my best 
friend whom I miss every 
minute. 
I don't recruit smokers or 
draft friends to share my folly, 

with the exception, of course, of 
my dog, Darby O'Gill, whom I 

worry about. It's a solitary vice 
which helps me hold all the 
other vices in check. Most vices 
seem to be socially acceptable 

today, if you only practice them 
in the company of other con­
senting adults. 

Am I not entitled to this single 
vice, for which I do not need a 
partner, though smoking 

creates a bond like a sacrament 
when I'm doing it with a 
friend? "Not," you say, "if it 
puts others at risk." Do I have 
a right to expect those others 
to give up the vices that put me 
at risk, as happens when they 
get drunk and throw up on my 
shoes? I wouldn't, for the 
world, be such a churl as to 
treat another person like a 
leper, even if he was so leprous 
that I could see his fingernails 
falling into the ginger ale. If 
anyone wants to treat me like a 
leper because I smoke, I say 
forgivingly, "Prayer partner, be 
my guest, if that is what you 
must do to survive." 
Greater love for a vice no man has than this, that he should give up his life for a smoke. I know that's a sin, but maybe, with the help of God's grace, I'll be able to give up smoking someday, before I have one foot too deep down in the grave. But, it's my choice, not yours. Rather, than to ac­cept the intolerance of non­smokers as the jig I'm obliged to dance to, I'll build me a cabin on the tip of a mountain at the top of the world, where I can smoke in peace as I make my last stand. 
If a man isn't faithful to his vices, he's not apt to be faithful to much else. Has anyone told that to the visionaries at Med­jugorje?

The Notre Dame women's soccer team looks to build its winning streak as it continues its 13-game winnings homestand this weekend. 
The Irish, S-6, will play host to the Redskins of Miami (Ohio) on Friday at 1 p.m. As the new week rolls in, Notre Dame will play Tri-State on Tuesday at 7:30p.m. 
Notre Dame built a three-game winning streak during last week's action. The first victory came against Lake Forest on Tuesday, Sept. 26 by a score of 3-2. The Irish fell behind in that game but came on strong as Susie Zilvitis and Joy Sisolak scored their first goals of the season. Bernie Holland added the winner. 
The Irish defeated Indiana 4­1 three days after the Lake Forest game. Zilvitis scored an unassisted goal in the win over the Hoosiers, and K.T. Sullivan added her fifth goal of the sea­son on an assist from Zilvitis. 
Notre  Dame  downed  
Michigan  4-3  last  Sunday.  
Marianne  Giolitto  scored  the  
first  goal  for  the  Irish,  with  

Sullivan, Sisolak and Margaret Jarc rounding out the scorin!.

NEW YORK -Davey Johnson kept his job after all Thursday when the New York Mets an­nounced that he will return for a seventh season as manager. 
The announcement came two days after sources told The Associated Press that the Mets had decided to fire Johnson and three days after the manager himself told The New York Times that he was convinced he would be fired. 
In a statement released in New York and at the National League playoffs in Chicago, the Mets said: "In an effort to dis­pel rumors and responses to the contrary, general manager Frank Cashen of the New York Mets today announced that the club plans to have Davey Johnson return to manage the team next season. Johnson has

a three-year contract with the Mets which runs through 1991." 
Cashen had said Tuesday that a decision on Johnson's fate had been made but would not be final until he could talk to the manager, who was fishing in Florida. 
"We never had any intentions of firing Davey," Cashen said Thursday through Mets spokesman Jay Horowitz. 
Joe Mcilvaine, the Mets' vice president for baseball opera­tions, confirmed that the front office had been divided, but he said the final decision was Cashen's "and we all stand by it." 
Mcilvaine would not say if he agreed with the decision. 
"There's always going to be disagreement in the room," he said. "You're not going to get 100 pe~cent agreement all the time. We sit down and discuss it. but that's not unusual. We have these disagreements on trades all the time." 
Johnson, who signed a three­year contract after last season. has led the Mets to two division titles and four second-place finishes in six years. The team is 575-395 under him. 
Mcilvaine said Cashen decided Thursday, a day after talking with Johnson. to keep him . 
Al Harazin, the Mets' senior vice president, met with owners Nelson Doubleday and Fred Wilpon on Monday after receiv­ing input from Mcilvaine. The next day, the Mets announced as expected that they would not re-sign co-captains Gary Carter and Keith Hernandez but left Johnson's status hanging. 
A source close to Cashen quoted the general manager as saying a definite decision had been made to fire Johnson.

Notre Dame has won its own meet seven times in the 33 years that the race has been held. 
The Irish are hoping to fare 
better than last year, when they 
placed fourth overall. Notre 
Dame's top two finishers -Dan 
Garrett and Ron Markezich ­
have both graduated. so the 
Irish will be relying on Mike 
O'Connor and Tom O'Rourke to 
lead the team. 
Notre Dame will certainly not 
lack confidence after overcom­
ing strong adversity to win the 
National Catholics last week. 
"The top five runners com­
peted very well," said Piane.

TORONTO -The Toronto Blue Jays and Oakland Athletics took a day off from the American League playoffs Thursday and spent it trading !!"tsults. 

AMERICAN 
LEAGUE PLAYOFFS 
Toronto third baseman Kelly Gruber accused Oakland of "showboating" during its victories in the first two games of the series. 
Talking about Dave Parker's slow home-run trot in Game 2, Gruber said: "I don't particularly care for the hot dog type. It sort of makes me want to get some vengeance." 
Toronto catcher Ernie Whitt started the verbal war on Wednesday when he said he was angry that Rickey Henderson didn't slide while stealing second base in the seventh inning of Oakland's 6-3 victory. Whitt said

Jamie Steenblock, who sits just behind Niesen with 161 kills, will be doing their best to break their squad's losing skid against the Irish. 
The Huskies' offensive effec­tiveness will depend upon the execution of the Huskies' freshman setter Amber Kim­mel, who has tallied 449 thus far in her first collegiate sea­son. 
And in case the Irish haven't had enough volleyball, they will Henderson tried to show up Toronto. Henderson said he didn't slide because there wasn't a throw. 
Oakland Manager Tony La Russa took exception to Whitt's comments. 
"If he's taking it personal and he's embarrassed, he's a fool," he was quoted as saying in a Toronto newspa­per. La Russa said Thursday he did make the statement and then defended his team from Toronto's attacks. 
"When you get to the post­season, there is a lot of emo­tion on both sides," La Russa said. "You celebrate. If I thought some of my people overdid it, I would be one of the first people to say, 'Keep it down.' I saw the Blue Jays celebrate a lot the last two months. Hey, you get happy when you do something good. Now that we got something going good, I don't like some of the comments that make it sound like we're showing people up. We're excited that we're doing good, just as they would be." 
play Eastern Michigan in their second of a string of five con­secutive matches in the JACC. 
Huron senior middle blocker Roxanne Munch has ripped holes in many a defense this season en route to tallying a team-high 159 kills, while she has clamped down on the arm­swings of her adversaries by al­tering the intent of 57 kill at­tempts. 
"Both Northern Illinois and Eastern Michigan have reason­ably good teams," Lambert said. "But when our team de­cides to transfer what it does on the practice court to the arena, watch out, because someone will pay the price." 

Cubs even things up with 9-5 rout 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -The Chicago Cubs still can't figure out Kevin Mitchell and Will Clark. But Mark Grace and friends had no trouble solving Rick Reuschel and salvaging the split they needed. 


,
 
Pitcher Mike Bielecki, the worst hitter in the major leagues, singled to spark a six-run first inning and the Cubs held San Francisco at bay, beating the Giants 9-5 Thursday night to even the National League playoffs at one game apiece. 
Chicago bounced back from Wednesday's 11-3 rout in a hurry. They chased the 40-year­old Reuschel with five hits, in-eluding a triple by Ryne Sandberg, an RBI double by Grace, and Jerome Walton capped the outburst against Kelly Downs with his second single of the inning. 
That, along with a three-run 
Ryne Sandberg 
double by Grace in the sixth that gave him three hits for the second consecutive night, was enough for three Chicago pitch­ers to withstand San Francisco's sluggers. 
Mitchell, who led the majors with 4 7 home runs, homered for the second straight game and singled twice. Clark, who drove in a record six runs in the opener, singled and walked, extending his streak of reaeh­ing base to seven. Matt Williams hit a two-run shot in the eighth and Robby Thompson a solo home run in the ninth that gave the Giants, who out-homered Chieago 141­124 during the season, a 6-2 home run edge in the playoffs. 
The Cubs, however, stopped Clark when it mattered most, maybe because of a move Manager Don Zimmer might have made one night earlier. Chicago led 6-2 in the fifth when the Giants put runners on second and third with two outs. Zimmer pulled Bielecki and brought in lefty Paul Assenmacher to face the left­handed Clark, who grounded out on the first pitch. 
The next three games will be in Candlestick Park. Rick Sutcliffe (16-11) will start against San Francisco's Mike LaCoss (1 0-10) Saturday. 
Les Lancaster pitched four innings for the victory. Because Bielecki did not last five in­nings, Assenmaeher would have been in line for the win, but he gave up two singles to start the sixth and was relieved. 
An all-day rain that stopped shortly before gametime failed to dampen the spirits of the sellout crowd of 39,195 and fans standing five deep on the nearby rooftops. A slight wind seemed to favor the Giants.

ND volleyball playing two at JACC after disappointing loss to Ohio St. 
By MOLLY MAHONEY Assistant Sports Editor 

The city of Columbus, Ohio ­the home of the Buckeyes of Ohio State -is roughly a five­hour drive from South Bend and much less than that if you fly the friendly skies. 
But for the Notre Dame vol­leyball team, which dropped to 3-9 on the season after losing to the Buckeyes in four games Wednesday night, that jaunt seemed like an eternity . 
-
"To tell you the truth, I'd rather forget that game," Irish head coach Art Lambert said. ''I'd like to think that you learn from your losses, but there comes a time when you have to start winning." 
Notre Dame will try to re­bound from that defeat in a pair of weekend matches at the Joyce ACC. The Irish host Northern Illinois at 7:30 p.m. Friday and face Eastern Michigan at the same time Saturday. 
The Irish left Wednesday for Ohio with high hopes of recov­ering from a sputtering start of the season, but once again, they stalled out. 
Their play thus far in the sea­son has earned them a reputa­tion as slow starters, and the Irish did little to shake this al­batross from their necks as 
Irish host cross country invite 
Men's team looking to prove pollsters wrong 

By MARY GARINO Sports Writer 
When the national cross country poll came out last Tuesday, the Notre Dame men's cross country team surprisingly was still ranked 15th. 
The Irish had hoped to move up in the rankings after defeat­ing second-ranked Providence last wot~kend at the National Catholic Invitational. 
Apparently, the Irish will have to prove themselves again. They have a good opportunity today at the Notre Dame Invitational, but it won't be an easy task. 
The men's team will race at 2 pm, and a B team race will bP­gin at 4 p.m., both on tlw Burke Memorial Golf Courso. 
This wm~kend's meet includes some or the top teams in the NCAA's Division II and Division Ill ranks. 

Women's squad out for another top-5 finish 
Mike O'Connor 
"It's going to be a heck of a meet," said Irish head coach Joe Piane, who also coordinates the races. "The meet is deeper in quality with good Division I, II and III sehoors." 
Ohio University. ranked 20th in the nation. will be one of the strong contenders. Edinboro and Mankato State, which tied for the Division II national championship last year. also will be participating. 
The 16-team field also is ex­pected to include Malone, which is ranked number-one in the NAJA and Division lii national champion Wisconsin-Osh Kosh. 
But the teams to look out for historically have been from neighboring Michigan. Central Michigan won the event last year, and Michigan and Eastern Michigan were victorious the previous two years. Michigan runners also have fared well on the individual level recently. 
The Notre Dame Invitational was initiated in 1956 by former Irish coach Alex Wilson, mak­ing it the oldest intercollegiate cross country invitational in the country.

By SARAH VOIGT Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's cross country team has a tough task alwad as the Irish 10 qual­ity teams in the Notre Dame Invitational Meet this weekend. 
The competition ineludes Ohio University, rankP.d 20th in Division I; and Wisconsin-Osh Kosh, tlw deft~nding Division III national champions. 
Notn~ Dame also will face WestPrn Ontario, perhaps the best tPam in Canada and the 
second-place  finisher  in  the  
Notw  Dame  Invitational  last  
year.  

Irish coach Tim Connelly is impn~ssNI but not discouraged ninth best team out of 10," said Connelly. "There are a couple of outstanding teams, and the rest of the teams are also strong. But our goal is to finish in the top half of the race." 

Connelly stressed consistent weekly improvements in per­forr.lance as the game plan for a successful season. 
"We look to improve every week," he said. "We came in sixth in this meet a year ago and we're shooting to place in the top five this year." 
A top five place finish will also take depth and teamwork, according to Connelly.

Tracey Shelton 
they dropped the first two games of the match to the Buckeyes before taking game three. 
Ohio State, led by a one-man army named Holly O'Leary and her game-high 22 kills, won the first two games 15-7, 15-8 and then rallied after a hard-fought 13-15 loss in game three, to capture the fourth game 15-7. 
Junior outside hitter Tracey Shelton led the Irish offensive attack with 18 kills, while the middle hitting tandem of senior Kathy Cunningham and fresh­man Jessica Fiebelkorn added 13 kills apiece. 
Senior setter Taryn Collins contributed 42 assists and matched Cunningham's 14 digs, but the Irish only managed to tally three total team blocks in four games-a statistic which explains why six Irish players were able to record double-fig­ure digs. 
The Irish tallied more three more kills than the Buckeyes, but an inexperienced middle blocking corps left Ohio State an open window the hit through. 
"Poor blocking was obviously our downfall," Lambert said. "In fact it was just nonexistent, but if we can take care of that 
problem,  we're  going  to  do  
something."  
The Irish will try  to  act  on  

this weakness tonight as they host Northern Illinois in the Joyce ACC. 
The Huskies come into tonight's matchup 3-11 prior to their Oct. 3 showdown with In­diana State, and, like the Irish, have been torpid in their early matches. 
Notre Dame has momentum on its side going into its fifth meeting with Northern Illinois, as it holds a commanding 4-0 lead in the series. The Irish last faced Northern Illinois in 1987 and won 15-7,10-15,15-8, 15­6. 
But Huskies such as junior outside hitter Kari Niesen. who tops the team with 164 kills, and senior middle blocker
