(UPI) -Defense Secretary Secretary Melvin R. Laird said last night that the U.S. combat role in the Vietnam War will end this summer, but that some naval and air forces will be maintained in Southeast Asia indefinitely. 
While he declined to say when the American presence in South Vietnam might be terminated altogether, Laird pledged there would be no further U.S. com­mitments of "massive man power" there. 
Declaring that President Nixon's doctrine for Southeast Asia "is to make the best use of the resources our Allies have," the secretary said: 
"To say that we would not have a presence in Asia after Vietnam under the strategy of realistic deterrence ... would certainly be 
misleading. 
"I would envision that U.S. 
presence in Asia as far as naval 
forces are concerned, as far as 
air power is concerned, that this 
would be part of the realistic 
deterrent we would maintain in 
Asia." 
In predicting when the combat responsibility might be turned over to the South Vietnamese, 

The following telegram was sent to Steve Raymond of the Notre Dame refugee aid program: 
.. Please allow me to express these brief words in support of Notre Dame's refugee aid program for Indochina. This constructive program in support of the millions of war victims created by the war in Indochina is an eloquent statement in protest against the senseless war that has produced such tragedy for the peoples of the area. In exercisiny your moral duty to speak out against policies which defy the principles for which you stand, and in offering a constructive program of relief, you place yourselves in the great company of non-violent protesters such as thoreau and Gandi. It serves to remind us all of our responsibility to speak out against the war and work together towards peace. 
I am hopeful that Congress will respond this session with the same sense of duty and responsibility that characterizes your program. I commend your efforts and pledge, on my part, that I shall do all I can in the Senate to work for the legislation that will guarantee an end to American military involvement in Indochina. Through such programs as yours--by continuing to press for peace-­we shall, I believe, still the guns that have for so long destroyed the peoples and land of Indochina.

Laird would be no more specific than "in the summer period" this year. 
Then looking beyond that, he told newsmen: "I would not have you think that we would not have a security force or that it would not be involved in some combat. 
"Some people go away from these meetings with him with the impression the combat forces we have in Vietnam then will remain around defense lines and not protect tha American presence. This is not true. They will protect the American presence." 
During the news conference, Laird also denied that the tough resistance the South Vietnamese met in the incursion into Laos had slowed down President Nixon's Vietnamization process. 
On another subject, the secretary said in reply to qud­stions that there was eveidence the Soviet Union has supplied Egypt with ever increasing amounts of sophisticated weapons and also of the "establishment of a naval base in the Mediterranean area." 
On the latter point, defense officials said Laird referred to long standing Soviet naval facilities at Mersa Matruh 



Frogs, mice released in protest at Soviet offices 
NEW YORK (UPI) A small group of youths, protesting the plight of Jews in the Soviet Union, released some 50 live frogs in a Soviet office in Manhattan yesterday. Minutes later, they turned loose 50 live mice in another Soviet office. 
The group, Student Activists for Soviet Jewry, described the action as the first and second of 10 "plagues" symbolic of the biblical plagues given the Egyptian pharoah that it planned in the next few days to harass the Russians. 
The group struck first yesterday afternoon at the Soviet's Aeroflot airlines ticket office where, according to a group spokesmna, two teenagers staged a fight to divert attention while three others dumped the frogs on a secretary's desk. 
"It was beautiful," the spokesman said. "Everyone was screaming." 
A spokesman for the airlines said later that when police arrived, the youths gathered the frogs and took them away. "Everything is in order, now," he said. 
Police took one of the youths, an unidentified 15 year old, into custody on trespassing and harassment charges. 
Twenty minutes following the Aeroflot incident, other members of the group released the mice in the Manhattan office of Amtorg, the Soviet trade agency. Police said there were no arrests in that incident, during which the mice apparently scattered and fled. 

National Bank and Trust Co., whose military reservation branch was the gang's target, said it would take 24 to 48 hours to determine exactly how much money was taken from the safe when the robbers made their escape in the bank manager's car at 8:30a.m. EST. The money was identified as the payroll for the nearby Veterans Administration hospital. 
The car was found abandoned at 11 a.m. EST. in Brooklyn, which is linked to Staten Island by the Verrazano Narrows Bridge. A mid-afternoon the gang had not been apprehended. A 13 state alarm was issued and the FBI entered the case. 
According to police, the 12 hour drama began about 8:30 P.M. EST Monday when the bank manager Charles Disogra, 58, answered the doorbell of his Staten Island home and found three men. They said their car had broken down. 
Sideline Business 
After Disogra admitted the men, they told him to send home a woman whom he was helping with her income tax returns-a sideline business for Disogra.

"I don't think the Nixon ad­mini~tra~ion is showing any special mterest," said Bob 
Crypt manager expects
Spanogle, 28, now a senior 

majoring in economics at Michigan State University. "Some of the programs for veterans are simply smokescreens.'' 
Spanogle, president of the 100,000 member National Association of Collegiate V~terans, was among a group of VIetnam veterans invited to attend a White House session Monday. 
At that meeting, the President unv:eiled a $1 million pilot proJect, funded by the Office of Economic Opportunity aimed at recruiting the 350,000 unem­p~oyed Vietnam veterans through direct contact with veterans now in college under the GI bill. 
Spa.nogle termed the project "a ~tep m the right direction, but Just not enough." 
He said the biggest problem the returning veteran faces is an inadequately funded GI bill. Whereas the World War II v~teran of the 1940's found his GI bill covered virtually all of his c~llege expenses, he said, the VIetnam veteran finds he owes as much as $600 to $1,500 out of his own pocket to finish a year's study. 
"We're not asking for anything more than our fathers got " Spanogle said. "Although the

SU rent charge next year 
John Majeta, manager of the Crypt, said yesterday that the 
record co-op will probably be charged rent for· its space in the student center next year. When the Crypt was originally 
established there was "con­
siderable pressure" to abolish it, 
Mateja said. At this time the 
Student Union entered and in­
vited him to move the establish­
ment into LaFortune. 
According to Majeta, the move 

was made so that the establish­
ment would be "more centrally 
located." No discussion of rent 
was involved and the only 
stipulation was that the Student 
Union have control over what 
was sold. Expansion of services 
to include posters and other items 
would be contingent upon Union 
approval. 
However, the entire operation 

is financed and managed by 
Majeta. He claimed that the 
management takes a large 
amount of time and effort to 
protect what he estimated to be 
$10,000 worth of stock. 
Father Thomas E. Blantz, vice 

president for student affairs, 
recently suggested that, since it 
is being run by a private in­
divdual, the service should be 
no amount was mentioned, but a 
· figure would be negotiated by next fall. Pointing out that he has recently absorbed fifty per cent of a ten cent album price increase by raising his prices only five cents, 
Bill McGrath, Union Diretor, and Fr. Blantz both said that the idea of a rental fee was a good one and that Majeta was in agreement with them. Fr. Blantz said that it was "unfair" for an individual to profit from the free use of space and that the students should "get more than just a price savings out of the establish­
ment." 
McGrath explained that the Crypt would be treated as a "~onc~ssion." Each year, ap­
phcabons will be taken for the manager's position and the Union will choose the most qualified. The funds gleaned from the rental will then be returned to the Student Services Commission. This commission operates mostly ?n a pure expenditure basis and it IS only through operations such 
, as the Crypt and Student Press that ~t is able to continue operation.

Rossini, Wilson explain fuctions 
This is the ceco~d and final part of an Observer Insight desined to aqauint our readers with the six vice presidents of the University. Today's insight will present Dr, Frederick D. Rossini, vice president for research and developmentand Rev. Jerome J. Wilson, vice president for business affairs. The sixth of­ficial Executive Vice President Rev. Edmund P. Joyce has been unavailiable for comment. 
The office of Dr...Frederick 
D. Rossini, vice president for research and sponsored programs, is concerned with "processing all sponsored programs in the areas of University interest." These areas include research, which is "any scholarly endeavor in any field of the University," Dr. Rossini said. "Good research which feeds into education keeps the faculty alive and up to date in their respective area of teaching." To finance cthe cost of research done at Notre Dame would mean nearly doubling tuition, but the University feels that its students shouldn't have to bear the cost of research and it tries to recover these costs from sponsors," Rossini said. 
Dr. Rossini's office tries to secure financial support for faculty members who have made specific proposals from the agencies of federal and state governments, private foun­dations, industrial concerns, and private industry. Last year Notre Dame received almost $8.4 million for sponsored programs. Speaking of military spon­sorship Dr. Rossini said that the University does receive support from the Defense Department, but also that "the University has a policy of not accepting grants or contracts to do secret, meaning non­publishable research.. except in times of nation~l emergency." 
He also explained that each 
proposal is sponsored separately 
because the University has to charge the sponsor"indirect administrative costs," which include money for supplies, equipment, travel, tuition for graduate student assistants and two months summer salary for the professor. 
Every month Dr. Rossini's office published a bulletin listing the current work being published by the faculty and the awards of sponsorship received. An annual report gives a brief synopsis of each faculty member and a list of the publications and research in progress that year. "Nearly every member of the faculty tries to do research of some kind," Dr. Rossini stated.

LUBBOCK, Texas <UPO -A dust storm laced with 60 mile an hour winds turned the sky red, caused car wrecks, and cut visibility so low across drought crippled Texas yesterday that residents could not see across the street. 
"If I had an airplane today, I could go up about 1,000 feet and homestead one of the best farms in Lubbock County," said Dean Nichols, a farmer. "On real bad days like today, crops lose up to one inch of topsoil and it takes seven years to replace that one inch." 
Farmers shut down irrigation wells to prevent dust damage. Twenty-one cars, their drivers hampered by the reduced visibility piled together on an interstate highway in Amarillo, Texas, sending eight persons to a hospital. 
Winds gusting up to 60 miles an hour pushed the dust southward to the Red River Valley along the Oklahoma border. 
Dust warnings were posted for Wichita Falls, Texas where next Friday a full blooded Cherokee will conduct an Indian rain dance in an attempt to bring that city its first miosture since a trace of rain fell on March 26. 
"That's not dust blowing out there," said Jerry Coleman, a farmer, "That's just plain dirt." 
All of Texas and the south­western United States is in desperate need of rain to avert a disaster notseen in this area since the Dust Bowl days of the Depression of the early 1930's. Parts of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and on into Colorado have had no appreciable rain in seven months. 
In San Antonio, Texas, fire fighters answered a grass fire call every seven minutes Tuesday. 
Houston officials said Lake 
Houston, one of the city's many sources of water, had reached its lowest April level in history. 
"On the basis of present uses Lake Houston will dry up in about 100 days," said R.A. Thompson, director of the water division in the nation's sixth largest city. 
He said artesian wells would probably prevent Houston from having to ration water, but if rationing was necessary industry would be the first to feel the cutback. 
Visibility in downtown Lubbock was cut to three blocks, and persons standing on one side of an interstate loop around the city could not see to the other side of the highway. 

Room situation is seen as slight 
The conflict between the actual number of rooms left in the halls after room picks, and the number of rooms previously alloted for next year's freshmen should work itself out, according to Father Peter Chambers, director of student housing. 
"We're checking the situation over now, and should know for sure after room deposits come in," Fr. Chambers said. He further commented that "the differences generally work out well. If a hall has extra rooms we make these available for campus wide hall picks." 
If a hall doesn't have enough rooms, the situation can be alleviated by shifting freshman allotments and by other factors such as room cancellations, Fr. Chambers added. 
Buzz Imhoff, chairman of the 
hall president's ~neil said that 
the room picks in 'his hall went 
quite well. He commented that 
eight more people than they 
should have, but he felt that this 
could be worked out by shifting 
the arrangements of a few suites. 
Father Maurice Amen, rector of Flanner hall, acknowledged the fact that Flanner is 46 students over its assigned upper­class quota. 
He said, however, that this should not be a very difficult problem because of many factors that enter into the situation. 
"There are indications that next years freshman class will be smaller than this year's. The allotments were assigned and designed with this year's number of freshmen as criteria, so this difference should help solve the matter," Father Amen said. 
Fr. Amen added that "one can not make an absolute decision or plan for next year solely on th~s year's situation." He also sa1d that one can not judge the room pick situation by observing one

Clear and Present Danger 
to the University 
Chapter II: Take the Money and Run 
The newest and most perverse development in the contin.uing ~ag3; ~f the Great Drug Bust finds Donald Badger, who _was .a.cqUitted m c1v.Il 
court on charges of sale of illegal drugs, san~ his tUitiOn and sans his Notre Dame education. Badger, who was demed eve.n the c~urtesy of a personal interview with Father Hesburgh to appeal. th1s drastic step n~w 
faces a wasted semester and an imperiled academic career as the prtce of his alleged transgression. " 
That Badger was susepnded on an ambiguous charge (as. a .cl.ear and present danger to the University") for reasons unproven 1p .c1v1l court,that he was forced to prove his innocence before the Judtctal APpealsBoard under a vaguely_-worded judicial c~de, that he was co.nvtcte~ byevidence gained from mformal ~onver~atwn, and .tha~ he wtll.posstblylose his chance for aND degree IS all history. The 1romc crowmng bJow however, is the information that Dean of Students Father Jam~s ~e1hle was in full knowledge of B~dger's SUS(lensio~ well before the begmmng of this semester. Reihle watted he sa1d, until he had a chan~e to meet Badger before he suspended him. He mi~ht have added, until he had a chance to collect Badger's semester tuition. . . Under the letter of the law Reihle's move is certainly correct. Expbc1tscript and precedent both show the Univers!ty copecting full tuition.froip 
suspended students But to deliberately watt until a student has patd h1s 
thousand dollars plus and then suspend him is petty and perhaps even malicious. . d b R "hl • d
The pettiness is compounded and reinforce y e1 e s cru e posturing. To reveal to his collegue Dean Burke that Badger would not be getting any rebate on his tuition and then to con~enq for the student newspaper that the issue was yet under cons1deratwn 1s perhaps symp­
tomatic of the entire attitude of authoritarianism that has escorted the 
Administration through this whole escapade.That attitude we contend, is a clear and present danger to the 
University, and'we sugge~t it, as well as the Judicial Code and the ob­
noxious charge under which Brennen, Badger, Henehan, and Holbert 
were suspended, be eliminated. Now.

The Freshman Senate, 
such as it is 
What follows may be a vicious tirade, a self-condemnation, a denial 
of the right of a body to existence -if one were in the habit of 
categorizing such things, this one would probably fall into any one of 
these classifications with equal facility. If it was necessary to 
categorize what is about to be written, I think I'd most prefer it to be 
thrown into the drawer labeled "thoughts, conceptions and ideas 
engendered on a night in April within a rather disturbed individual." If 
you don't have a drawer labeled like that, please don't start one. Just 
read it once and throw it away, and if it doesn't matter, nothing's lost; 
if it does matter to you, then you won't need to read it a second time. 
I may as well warn you that I'll most probably devote a good deal of 
my writing to casting insults at and aspersions upon several persons, 
some of whom may be among your friends. Oh, mone of you of course­
-but --well, yes, friends. 
Maybe I should have titled this an open letter to the combined MD­SMC freshman class officers, freshman senates, and freshmen in general. The combined freshman senate of ND and SMC had a meeting of sorts Monday night. The freshman senate has a social­activites committee --somehow, this seems to be a relevant point -­whose function is supposedly to investigate matters regarding (ob­viously) social activites. At the senate -not social committee, an honorable group, of course --meeting, five topics were discussed rather at length: A class trip to the Warren Dunes; a proposal that the class sponsor a dating game game; a picnic for the senators; an easter egg hunt on Easter Sunday; and an Easter afternoon touch football game. Well, these are all certainly pertinent matters, and surely within the scope of the freshman senate. I'm definitely not contesting the viability of the suggestions forwarded at Monday's meeting. Yet it seems that, perhaps, we (I may say "we"--since I am also a senator) could also consider one or two other points, albeit not of such phenomonal import or impact as a Dating Game game, but that nonetheless might be deserving of our attention. 
There is a lake just slightly to our north, on the campus, that is rapidly succumbing to pollutants. 
There is a certain minority of students among the freshman class that feels that it is being discriminated against by certain elements in the administrations, and this belief is supported by allegations from faculty of both campuses. 
There are a few elements still lacking at Notre Dame, even if the co­ed proposal has been ratified by the trustees. Among these are an academic atmosphere condusive to self-expression, an element of socio-political awareness, an involvement with a plethora of major temporal issues beyond the Golden Dome and our major sequence studies. I'm not trying to deny the presence of these elements of awareness on the campus, or even among the freshman senate, although I am pointing out an intolerable lack of participants in these 
areas. 
I also accuse student administration in general, the freshman senate included, and myself in particular for perpetrating this abhorrent condition of isolationism at duLac and environs thereof,. And I for­mally register, in my behalf and in the begalf of all the unheard voices of revolution calling out for organization and direction, support and guidance, a plea to the university as a whole to consider the advent of a new age, to consider the approach of the future, to look beyond their textbooks at the real world, as 1t is, and to consider how it should be, and to make an effort to bring that ideal condition to reality. In 
•;hort, to make the University of Notre Dame exactly that, a univer­sity, an assemblage of individuals set apart from their con­temporaries by their involvement in and effects upon the future of their world, and to effect a change from our present status as "a great 
place to learn a. lot of books."

superstar •IS dead 
Alright I'll die! 
Just watch me die! 
See how I die! 
Then I was inspired 
Now I'm sad and tired 
After all I've tried for three years seems like 
Why then am I scared to finish what I started What you started--! didn't start it God thy will is hard 
But you hold every card I will drink your cup of poison, mail me to the eros and break me 
Bleed me beat me kill me take me now-­
before I change my mind 
It doesn't take long for the end to come. The opera ends with the death of Superstar. The vital rock sound is over; the violins stop, the record arm sweeps toward the label. And we hear no more. The libretto refers us to John 19, 41. We eagerly flip to the spot, expecting to read of the Resurrection, but find instead: "Now at the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which nobody had yet been laid." Apparently there is to be no Resurrection. 
But that's just the point. There will be no resurrection of Superstar because Superstar deserves to be dead. Jesus refuses to be their Superstar, and so there will be no resurrection of the idolatry and dependency that has characterized the relationship of fan to folk hero. Jesus repudiates phony faith-the followers of Superstar, hoping to ride their hero into a rosy future, where everything is A-OK (cup runneth over) for those who have it made-status achievers and status-quo believers. Superstarism is dead,and with it, the easy, bogus, cheap-grace kind of spirituality: 
Christ you know I love you 
Did you see I waved 
I believed in you and God 
So tell me that I'm saved 
Yes. Superstar is dead, but Jesus is alive, At the end Jesus has only the Father. In the final words of the opera, we hear Jesus sing: "Father, into your hands I commend my spirit." He has nothing but the Father, but having nothing but the Father, he has everything. No longer any obstacle, no longer anything standing in the way. He's home free. The end of Superstar is the beginning of Jesus risen. And now the only ones who can walk with him are those who are willing to do what he did: turn and open to God in trust. 
As a result of reflecting on Superstar, we come to the exhilarating discovery that Jesus was right-it 
can be be blessed and good when we are without, when we are humanly unfulfilled. The beatitudes do make sense, because if a man is willing to live in the real world, andacceptthe human condition, it means that he will have to struggle in the midst of frustration and disappointment, the downs and the blahs. Not that he looks for these; he doesn't have to. They come anyway. But being, as they are, an inevitable part of the human condition, they can still be opportunities for him to grow. Because in the midst of these moments of human unfulfillment he is more apt to pen to, more liable to consider, a 
transcendent source of fulfillment than if he lived in a world where every day everything came up roses. Never a ripple, never a disappointment, everything peaches and cream. 
Imagine, if you will, this scene: a Notre Dame student wheels up in his Supersport, decked out in Gilbert's finest, with St. Mary's loveliest at his side. He is Supermover! Now suppose you say to him: Fear not, I bring you tidings of good news. There's been born for you a Savior." You can picture the reaction: "Man, are you for real? You've got to be kidding. You're giving me answers, but I'm not asking any questions. Good news-I've never had it so good. I've got all the good news I can stand." Well, most of us don't live in a world like that. Most of us are forced, because of the circumstances that come our way, to decide whether to turn off or to trust. To give ourselves to self-pity, despair, bit­terness, or to give ourselves to God-to hang on in the midst of whatever comes our way. But that's the key: life is hanging on. Julia, in T. S. Eliot's

ALL EVENTS ARE FREE 

They call Jesus Christ "Superstar" in the new and popular rock opera, but surely this is irony; it would be much more honest to call him "Superflop." Surely Judas is right: 
You sad pathetic man--see where you've brought us to 
Our ideals die around us all because of you 
And now the saddest cut of all-­
Someone has to turn you in 
Like a common criminal, like a wounded animal 
A jaded mandarin 
A jaded mandarin 
A jaded faded mandarin 
And when Superstar himself speaks, it is hardly the words of a hero. In the •Garden of Gethsemane Jesus sings: 
I only want to say 
If there is a way 
Take this cup away from me for I don't want to taste its poison 
I<'eel it burn me, I have changed I'm not as sure 
As when we started 
Then I was inspired 
Now I'm sad and tired 
Listen surely I've exceeded expectations 
Tried for three years seems like thirty 
Could you ask as much from any other man? 
But if I die 
See the saga through and do the things you ask of me Let them hate me hit me hurt me nail me to their tree 
I'd wanna know I'd wanna know my God 
I'd wanna see I'd wanna see my God 
Why I should die 
Superstar asks the question we all ask-"Why die?" 
Would I be more noticed than l was ever before? Would the things I've said and done matter any more? 
I'd have to know I'd have to know my Lord I'd have to see I'd have to see my Lord If I die what will be my reward? I'd have to know I'd have to know my Lord Why should I die? 
Millions of readers of Love Story have been asking the same question, and the thousands who stood in block-long lines outside theaters this cold winter cried over that same question. And we might, in the styple of Superstar, imagine Jennie singing: "I'm twenty-five and alive, what's in it above when I've just begun to love? Why should I die?" This is the ancient cry, repeated every day: Why should Jennie die? Why should David Beck die? Why should Beth Kienlen die? A lovely girl who was killed in a stupid bus accident as she was travelling out here to be with her hoy friend for the Mardi Gras. 
Like Jesus Christ Superstar. we want to to con­front the God who seems to allow such senseless things to happen: 
Can you show me now that I would not be killed in vain? ) 
Show me just a little of your omnipresent brain 
Show me there's a reason for your wanting me to die You're far too keen on where and how. and not so hot on why 
Under these circumstances it seems wild and foolish for Jesus not to throw in the towel, yet he goes ahead: 
"Cocktail Party," says, "Every moment is a fresh beginning, and life is simply keeping on." This is what God asks of us, to be faithful to the end. Because the end is only the beginning; it's a door marked, not "Exit" but "Entrance." The end of the record, "Jesus Christ Superstar," is really the end of the historical record of the preliminaries. The end of the record is the beginning of a new life of glory, which cannot be recorded in time. For it never ends at all. As Jesus sings in the song, "Poor Jerusalem": 
If you knew all that I knew, my poor Jerusalem 
You'd see the truth, but you close your eyes 
But you close your eyes 
While you live your troubles are many, poor Jerusalem To conquer death you only have to die You only have to die 
So it's very true, as someone recently wrote, that "The pledge of a man's love is the beginning of a man's death." Any time we pledge ourselves to be true to a commitment, to be loyal to a pledge, we have to die. But the death is a death to those things which stand between ourselves and this fidelity; the pledge of our gift of self in trust to the Father means a death to softness, to comfort, to convenience, to betrayal. It's a death that liberates and frees. 
A couple of weeks ago I was in the home of friends and the valentines from their children were displayed on the kitchen bulletin board. You know what valentines made by children are like. A little boy comes home from school and gives a valentine to his mother, and by any artistic standard what­soever the thing is absolutely worthless. Everything is on crooked, the paste sticking out all over, and he 
has "Mom" spelled "WOW." But what does it do to his mom? He gives it to her and it breaks her up; she has to run out of the room to have a good cry. For the old saying is really true: it's not the gift of the lover but the love of the giver that counts. God doesn't expect great, dramatic accomplishments from us; he asks for greatlove-fidelity in the midst of whatever happens to to come our way because of the particular pattern of life which is ours. So there's a very simple, yet crucial, lesson in :·superstar." It's painful at times-to be alive, to live m the real world. It'll cost you something to be true to a pledge, but it's all worthwhile in the end. Jesus puts it pretty well; "You will grieve now, but your grief will be changed to joy, and your hearts will rejoice with the joy that no one-no one-can ever take from you."

ND, Church change lauded 
The future of the Christian church may well depend upon the success of the revolution going on in the Roman Catholic Church today, according to a Episcopalian priest who recently completed the first year of a visiting professorship at the University of Notre Dame. 
Dr. Morton T. Kelsey, rectol' emeritus of St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Moravia, Calif., reported on his academic year at the University in an article "Catholicism in Revolution: A Protestant Report from Notre Dame" in the spring issue of Religion in Life quarterly. 
Much of Rev. Kelsey's article dealswithaspectsofthereligious revolution in the Roman Catholic 
Church he saw at Notre Dame, where, he noted, students "are seeking for answers which may help spread a vitalized faith." He taught biblical and liturgical pedagogics, theories of religious instruction, and the prophetic role in religious instruction. 
He was impressed with the freedom with which theological and social issues were handled at the University. "The questions of compulsory celibacy for the priesthood, of birth control, of ecumenicity and other con­troversial issues are discussed with the same freedom as in a secular university, and often with greater understanding and balance," he commented. "In­deed, there may well be more intellectual freedom at Notre Dame than in many state universities, where only the rational materialism of our time is presented. Here both sides of modern culture are presented, and the student has a chance to 
make a real choice." 
Other facets of campus religious life which drew praise from the Episcopalian rector were the variety and sincerity of informal liturgies, the attempt "to develop a laity informed and dedicated," and the openness to "new discovery of religious or spiritual realities." Notre Dame, he said, "has taken a lead in the Catholic Church in its attitude toward the future."

Three gala spring outings were announced last night by the newly formed Cape Cod-Toledo­Kankakee Club, in a news con­ference on the second floor of Breen-Phillips Hall 
Speaking in behalf of the membership were President Jack Gillis, Secretary-Treasurer, Bill Schmidt, and SMC Coor­dinator Ann Shoemaker. 
Gillis said that the club's "spring offensive" will begin this Friday at 9:00P.M. with a party at a location to be determined. The remainder of the spring agenda calls for a trip to the Cubs-Mets game on April25 and a banquet, featuring club moderator, Father Theodore M. Hesburgh, tenitatively scheduled 
for-·May 11. In answer to a querie concerning the pur­pose of the club. Gillis responded,

excuse for a bunch of guys to play 
basketball together in the club 
league, it has now blossomed into 
a legitimate club. We see our 
purpose as improving the social 
atmosphere on the campus by 
providing places where girls and 
guys can get together without any 
obligations to each other." 
By establishing a policy whereby girls are required to pay, Gillis contends that the dating syndrome is broken down and the atmosphere at the club's outings is more relaxed and in­formal. 
Schmidt, who is chairman of the April 25 outing to Chicago, emphasized that this, as well as all other club activities , is open to all students. Schmidt noted that the club has chartered two busses and purchased 92 box seat tickets in a block, for this crucial National League contest. In­cluded in the $11 fee for the trip will be round-trip transportation, game ticket, refreshments served aboard the bus and perhaps a tour of some of Chicago's finer establishments. Schmidt mentioned that sign-ups will be held today in the dining halls on both campuses. 
Speaking on the financial situation of the club, Schmidt said, "We aren't interested in making a profit and because of 
that, we are now running a little 
in the red." The secretary­
treasurer was optimistic, 
however, pointing out that "all of 
our past events have been well 
received and successful, and we 
expect the same from our spring 
offensive." 
The recent successful events 
that Schmidt spoke of include 
parties at Breen-Phillips and 
Alumni, which were "at least 50 
percent girls." The reason for 
this phenomenon, explained Miss 
Shoemaker, is that "there are 
more than 100 charter members 
of the club on our campus and 
enthusiasm is extremely high." 
Miss Shoemaker expects a 
combined turnout of 300 to 400 
people Friday night. 
As for the club's future, next 
year all three officers were in 
agreement that the club would be 
in existance next and hopefully 
expanded, but they have made no 
specific plans to date.

Hesburgh sees future need for Civz1 Rights Commission 
Notre Dame, Ind.--The need for a politically independent fact­finding agency in the area of civil rights is as evident today as it was 14 years ago when the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights was established, according to its chairman. 
Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., president of the University of Notre Dame and chairman of the Civil Rights Commission, traces the development of the Commission's independence in an article in the spring issue of the Notre Dame Lawyer. 
The only original member of the Commission left from the initial group appointed by President Eisenhower, Father Hesburgh empahsizes the bipartisan agency's continuing role as a "'burr in the saddle' to the President, the Congress, the federal bureaucracy and others who have had the capacity to remedy civil rights denials." 
He notes that the Commission

SU appointees to focus on SMC participation 
Student Union Director Bill McGrath yesterday outlined the. roles that his assistants Kathy Eglet and Milt Jones will fill during the new Union year. 
McGrath said Miss Eglet's job is "to promote interest among St. Mary's students into working for the Union." 
"Kathy will also serve to insure that St. Mary's is properly represented in Student Union activities," he added. With the arrival of co-education, McGrath noted the necessity for the Union to be constantly aware of the need for more participation by St. Mary's in Union affairs. "Kathy will see that the Union does not neglect this necessity," he said. 
In a similar vein, Jones "will serve to insure that blacks are not excluded either in working for, or participating in Student Union affairs. 
When asked to comment on her newly acquired duties, Miss Eglet said that she hoped to 
Editors named for 1971-72 Chimes 
Yesterday Dr. Harold Isbell, 
advisor  of  Chimes,  St.  Mary's  
literary  magazine,  announced  
the  appointments  of  Lucia  

Zaucha and Deborah Kerr as editor and co-editor for next year's issues. 
In editing the issue for first semester, Miss Zaucha's goal is to make more people aware of the magazine on both campuses. "Chimes is the best kept secret at 
St. Mary's," she said. 
Questioned on the possibility of consolidating the Juggler, Notre Dame's literary magazine, with Chimes, Miss Zaucha replied, "I don't think that the two publications will be merged next year, but I would like to explore the idea of cooperation. 
"I think that there is a need on campus for two separate literary magazines, "she continued. "They provide the possibility of variety to present as many dif­ferent opportunities to writers on both campuses." 
As an effort to improve the 63­page magazine, financed by student government and the college, Miss Zaucha revealed that the Chimes staff will have a special one-credit publications workshop with Dr. Isbell and Edward Senna, Chimes' publisher and manager of the Ave Maria Press printing plant. 
If the magazine recieves an adequate budget from student government and the college, Miss Zaucha would also like to make Chimes an artistic journal by including illustrations with prose and poetry. 
"Buckminster Fuller Day" lectures set for April 16 
To promote attendence for a 
"R. Buckminster Fuller" Day 
this Saturday, a group of ND 
students are staging a pet show 
today in front of the South Dining 
Hall, and are presenting a band 
on the main quad Friday. 
The group, displaying placards on which were inscribed some of the titles of architect-philosopher Fuller's novels, paraded in front of the South Dining Hall and the SMC Dining Hall Monday af­ternoon to advertise Saturday's activities. 
Ed Suzuki, a fifth year ND architect student, organized the events to get publicity for Fuller's "World Game" philosophy which will be discussed in organized lectures this Saturday, April 16. 
Fuller, who, among other things, invented the geodesic dome and designed Stepan Center, has recently tried to get his land in Cyprus declared a nation by the U.N. as reported by Life magazine, for his "World Game." His ideas will be discussed by ND professors Kenneth Featherstone, Anton Chroust, Thomas Stritch, and Edward Pickard. 
The main speaker will be 

Brenden O'Regan from Fuller's 
office at the World Game Center, 
Carbondale, Illinois. Ed Suzuki 
will also speak. 
In a press release to the Ob­

server Suzuki briefly explained 
why he and SMC philosophy 
teacher Anne Clark organized 
"Fuller Day." He said that they 
are trying "to expose information 
on the potentials of man on 
spaceship earth today and to 
discuss the possibility of the 
eternal now as a species of 
potentially rational self­

The men then asked Disogra about his wife and family and he told them they were spending the evening at the nearby home of Mrs. Disogra's sister, Mrs. Margaret Baratta, secretary to the Richmond County Democratic Party chairman. 
Disogra said the men then pulled guns, donned ski masks and golves and forced him to drive to the Baratta home. Once there they took as hostages Mrs. Disogra and their son, John Jr., their daughter and son in law. 
Sometime after dawn, the hostages were tied or handcuffed to pipes in the basement and two of the men left with Disogra in his car, leaving thz third man at the Baratta house. Diogra said the men took off their masks, put on dark glasses, and told him to look straight ahead. 
The car' bore an Army sticker that got them by military police at the gate to Ft. Hamilton. When they reached the bank, the men put on their masks again and ordered Disogra to work his half of the safe's combination. 
Jones thinks that the Student Union is much more "open" to the blacks than it has been in the past. He said that when black students realize this they will be much more willing to work on commissions and see that black interests are not ignored. 
Speaking dates filled 
Academics Commissioner Steve Flavin announced that most of the speaking dates have been filled for the coming year. Flavin criticized the lack of speakers on campus in early September of last year. 
Assisting Flavin will be Becky Minter, who hopes, as Miss Eglet1does, to arrange for more speakers to lecture at St. Mary's. 

"encourage SMC girls to work on 
Student Union commissions," so 
that they might eventually gain 
"key positions" in the Union. 
"I also would like to see more speakers lecture at St. Mary's," she added. "Instead of having most of the activities take place at Notre Dame," Miss Eglet will try to steer events towards St. Mary's. Among these events would be a "Spring Weekend" at St. Mary's. 
In regard to services Miss Eglet hoped to use the money formerly held by the SMC Student Services Organization to improve the facilities of the SMC c.offeehouse. The money has smce been given to the Student 
Union. · 
When asked why he decided to accept his position, Jones noted that "there hadn't been a sub­stantial number of events in which blacks could take part during the past year." 
"There weren't enough ac­tivities geared for blacks. The only attempt to provide some was made by the Sophomore Literary Festival and they aren't even connected with the Student Union," Jones added. 
To correct this Jones will try to do three things: "Build up" trust in the Union among the blacks; set up a research commission to secure suggestions from the blacks; use the advice in an at­tempt to influence the respective committees of the Union.

The Sophomore Prom is in danger of being cancelled, ac­cording to SMC Sophomore Class President Sue Welte. 
"The bids will be on sale until tonight at 6:30 p.m. If at that time, there isn't the needed response, the prom will be cancelled," Miss Welte said in an inverview last night. 
She stated that currently only forty girls have bought the $8.00 bids for the Saturday night dance. "We have contracts that have to be fulfilled --the band (The Chapped Lips), the caterer-­about $660.00. With forty girls slated to attend, we can't fulfill these contracts." 
The Sophomore Class President contended that the problem was basically one of timing. This weekend was the only time possible to hold the prom, she said' and opposition was great against an informal jean formal originally suggested. "103 members of the class signed a petition to have a formal dance, and thus far zero people have signed up to help, and zero people have boutht tickets." 
"Why go to all the trouble if no one is interested?" she asked.

While troubles continue in Northern Ireland, the southern part of the Republic of Ireland came under another kind of attack when the ND Rugby Club invaded the Emerald Isle last month. 
I cornered a Rugger the other day in an attempt to get the details. He admitted that while they were not actually thrown out of the country, no one was really sorry to see them go. 
He was willing to relate the various carryings-on, but declined to divulge names, claiming he didn't want to accidentally fail to give anyone his just recognition. 
On Thursday, March 11, the Ruggers left Kennedy Airport after several hours of drinking in New York City for an overnight flight to Shannon. Their behavior was enough in the Rugby Club tradition to lead the stewardess to remark upon arrival: "I hope you guys are happy. You've drunk half our booze, stolen the rest, and kept all the passengers up all night." To this the Ruggers replied, "Flattery will get you nowhere." 
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday were spent in relative quiet in Shannon. The Ruggers left their sight-seeing bus in good condition, but did some punching-in of doors for which they were assesed 10 pounds(about $24). 
On Sunday, the Ruggers belted a City team from Abbey Feale, 24-8. T~eir conduct was excellent at a dinner party afterwards but the hotel still phoned ahead to Killarney as a warning. 
There were no games in Killarney, merely several days of organized sight-seeing. Perhaps lulled by the beautiful countryside, the Ruggers behaved themselves admirably. 
On Tuesday, however, they found themselves billeted in a hotel in Farretstown-by-the-sea. This hotel was out in the "sticks", leaving the Ruggers little entertainment save what comes from the bottle. 
St. Patrick's Day dawned bright and clear. By game time, however, the weather worsened into a 40-mph gale replete with sleet and snow . . . Furthermore, the playing field ran up the side of a hill. 
Facing the Bandon City team, the Ruggers chose to play into the wind and up the hill for the first half. Under these conditions, they battled to a 3-3 tie. But before their strategy could pay off, the second half was called off,leaving them with a "moral victory." 
Dinner and drinking followed the game, after which the Ruggers returned to their hotel. A dance was in progress so they retired to the hotel bar...When that was closed at 2:00 AM, several Ruggers decided to join the dance. The frightened manager bribed them with two cases of beer and they returned to their rooms. 
The following morning, the manager promptly charged the Club for the beer, demanding $7 per case. The angry Ruggers offered him $5 for the whole lot and he accepted. The Club then journeyed to the fabled Blarney Sone. 
Thursday and Friday were quiet, sight-seeing days in Water­ford,Arklow, and Dublin. The killing pace began to tell on the Ruggers as they dropped anll-3decision to the University College of Dublin on Saturday. Dublin's final five points came in the closing seconds when the Club weakened their defense in order to try to score. 
Following a dance, Sunday sight-seeing, and another dance, the Club reached Mullingar Monday night. When the booze was cut off at midnight, the Ruggers responded by throwing mugs against the walls and engaging in "general hell-raising." The management was talked out of calling the police. 
On Tuesday, the Ruggers reached Gallway City for a party given by University College of Gallway. Mter spending time at the American Hotel bar, the Ruggers left aroundll:OO PM for a dance. On the way out, they cleaned the lobby of several mugs, a coat of arms, and a barometer. 
On the way to the bus-stop, there was much tossing about of the mugs. One of them went through the window of the Bank of Ireland. When the Ruggers returned at 2:00 AM, the police were waiting. Damage done to the window, some car doors, and windows was assesed at $72. 
Having paid for the damage, the Ruggers retired, the rose on Wednesday for "A" and "B" contests with UGG. Really feeling the effects of the constant celebrating, the Club dropped both games. 
The flight back (with a different stewardess) was relatively uneventful and the Ruggers felt that under normal conditions they could have held their own against their competition. 
The IRA has not been heard from. 
second to first variety. 
The loss, the fourth in a row for the Irish, left coach Jake Kline's boys with a 5-8 record this season. Detroit is now 5-1 on the year. 
Junior right-hander Tom Menie started the game for Notre Dame but gave up three walks and four runs before being lifted in the second inning. 
Detroit tagged Menie for two runs in the first stanza, scoring on two walks and a double by Kirk Taylor. 
The Titans picked up two more runs in the second inning against Menie, knocking him out of the box. Joe Sabourin's triple was the big hit in the inning. 
Kevin Fanning, a freshman righty, came on in relief of Menie but the 6'4" chucker was belted for five runs on three hits, two walks, and two Notre Dame errors as Detroit batted around in the third

Observer Sportswriter 

Notre Dame's fast rising lacrosse team continued to roll along at an undefeated pace as the Irish stickmen added Ohio University and the Columbus lacrosse club to their list of conquered foes. The two road wins boosted first year coach, Rich O'Leary's won-loss record to 4-o. 
Last Thursday, versus Ohio University, Notre Dame rode Kenny Lund's five goals to a 10­7 victory· over Ohio U. Coach O'Leary described the game as, "a very physical contest." He elaborated, "Ohio University has a lot of big boys, especially on defense. We were fortunate that our defense did a good job in situations when we were a man down, as a result of penalties." The Irish were caught for ex­cessive roughness fifteen times and the performance of the 
defense while they were short­handed was impressive enough to earn that unit the game ball. 
Other individuals that augmented Kenny Lund's of­fensive prowess were Ed Hoban, 3 goals; Peter Murray, 1 goal; 
Rich Eich and Ed Hrabcsak gave the Irish no-hit pitching over the final four frames but Notre Dame couldn't quite muster enough offense to pick up the win. 
Captain Charlie Horan con­tinued to swing a hot bat for the Irish and drove in the first Notre Dame run of the game, tripling home LaRocca in the second inning. 
The Irish closed the gap to 9-5 in the fifth inning, coming up with four runs in that stanza. Phil Krill's 400' roundtripper to left center accounted for three of the Notre Dame markers. 
Horan belted a home run in the 
seventh inning, also to left center, 
that made the score 9-6. Singles 
by McGraw, reliable pinch hitter 
Rob Reschan, and freshman Pete 
Schmidt gave the Irish another 
run in the eighth and sent Titan 
Larry Niedowitz the 
and Jeff True, a midfielder, 1 goal. Coach o'Leary declared, "I thought our play in the third quarter of the Ohio game was the best I've seen all season." One additional factor which helped force the outcome Notre Dame's way, was a 14-7 edge in face-offs. The advantage was a result of the efforts of midfielders John Moran, Jim Laffey and Jeff True. 
The Columbus game, like the Ohio contest, was a high scoring battle. Columbus took fifteen shots on goal in the first quarter, however, goalie Jerry Kammer withstood the attack and in the second quarter Columbus was allowed only one shot. Notre Dame assumed a 3-2 halftime lead as the experience of the Columbus team kept it close. In the second half, Notre Dame overcame a zone defense against Lund and Ed Hoban and held a 7-6 lead with twelve seconds remaining in the game when goalie Jerry Kammer was detected hittting an opposing attackman over the head with his stick. Reserve goalie, Jim Roller, was unable to stave off Colum­bus' last offensive wave and the game went into overtime. Mter 
shower. Niedowitz was tagged for 10 hits in seven and two-thirds 
innings and he gave up six walks. Frank Kummer relieved Niedowitz and retired Krill for the final out in the eighth but, after giving up hits to LaRocca and Roemer in the ninth, Kummer was replaced by Kapla, who saved the game for the Titans. 
Once again, the Irish were unable to bring men home from the basepaths, stranding ten runners. The Titans left just three men on base. 
The Irish were scheduled to play the Michigan Wolverines in a doubleheader yesterday at Ann Arbor but the twin bill was cancelled because of rain. Notre Dame will be in action again this weekend, traveling to Toledo U. for a single game on Friday and doubleheader Saturc1ay 
two scoreless overtime periods 
the game went to sudden death 
where Dave Jurusik scored on a 
play sent in from the bench, with 
two seconds remaining. 
Coach O'Leary was par­ticularly pleased with the statistic which read 79 ground balls scooped up by Notre Dame as compared to 37 for Columbus. Aside from Jurusik's clutch goal Notre Dame's scoring output came from Ken Lund, 4 goals; Peter Murray, 2 goals; Paul Reagan,! goal; and Ed Hoban, 1 assist. It was the first time Hoban had been shut out this season. 
The teams's next encounter is with Michigan, a team of vast experience and overloaded with talent. Michigan has already played eleven games thus far and among their victims is Bowling Green, considered one of the top teams in the midwest. Coach O'Leary admitted the team would have its hands full and said, "We'll try and pass the ball around and control it as much as possible. Hopefully, this will offset their experience ad­vantage. We'll rotate three or four sets of midfielders and try to tire them out."
