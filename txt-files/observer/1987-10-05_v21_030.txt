Flu shots instituted at N.D. 
By CARL PUTNAM New Staff 
Free flu shots will be offered 
by the University Health Ser­
vices to all students, faculty 
and staff for the first time. 
The program, new this year, is engineered by Carol Seager, Director of the Health Center, and Dr. James Moriarty. Flu shots are very important, espe­cially in a campus environment where so many people live in such close contact, according to Dr. James Moriarity, who is instituting the program. 
"Most people have a miscon­ception of influenza," he said. "Influenza is not just diarrhea and vomitting." Rather, it is a respiratory disease that causes headaches, coughs, for a period of two to three weeks, he said. "Influenza is very difficult to treat. Plan on being laid up for a week." 
Moriarity advised all stu­
dents to avail themselves of the 
program. People should get flu 
innoculations annually because

NEW YORK -The White House has compiled a list of demands the Nicaraguan gov­ernment must accept if the Sandinistas want to prevent a request to Congress for more military aid to the Contras, ac­cording to a published report. 
The New York Times, in its Sunday editions, said the list in­cludes several conditions that are not part of the Central American peace agreement signed in Guatemala two months ago. 
One of the conditions calls for

UAW may set GM strike deadline 
Michael Root, a carnival 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -Negotiators for General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union met in subcommittees this weekend, amid speculation that the union will set a strike deadline at the giant automaker on Monday. 
. Unionized workers at GM have been working under a con­tract extension since Sept. 14. Either side may cancel the ex­tension with three days' notice. 
The Detroit Free Press quoted an unidentified union of­ficial as saying that the dead­line had been set Friday after UAW president Owen Bieber and 11 other union negotiators met for about an hour with the GM team. 
G M spokesman Howard Erickson said company negotiators would not discuss the talks until a settlement is reached. 
But Bieber said the negotia­tions at the "big table" Friday centered on how the agreement ratified last week by UAW members at Ford Motor Co. could be tailored to GM. 
The three-year Ford-UAW contract calls for preservation of 104,000 jobs, except in peri­ods of sales slumps; a 3 percent pay boost in the contract's first year and 3 percent lump sum Nicaragua to hold new presidential elections well before those scheduled for 1990, the newspaper quoted an uni­dentified senior White House official as saying. 
Among the other conditions, the Sandinistas must release all of their roughly 2,300 politi­cal prisoners, negotiate a cease-fire with the Contras, give the Contras unconditional amnesty that allows them to run for office, put an end to Cuban and Soviet military aid and evict all Cuban and Soviet military advisers.

Aftershock hits south California 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES-A sharp af­tershock from last week's se­vere earthquake jolted South­ern California before dawn Sunday, causing at least one death and dozens of injuries, damaging buildings, knocking out power and sending jittery residents into the streets. 
The quake, centered in sub­urban Rosemead about eight miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, registered at 5.3 on the Richter scale of ground motion, said Don Kelly of the 
U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. 
At the California Institute of Technology the quake was measured at 5.5, according to a spokesman, Robert Finn. 
"It was pretty wild," said Mark Rosenker, who was on the 18th floor of the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles. "Let me tell you, it does get you up."

Root and Nilda Lopez were arrested Sept. 11 at a cabin in rural Mecosta County, five days after Ed­ward and Marion Beau­champ were found strangled in their bed following a break-in at their home in the Detroit suburb of Ferndale. 
Lopez was arrested along with Root on charges of passing bad checks at a grocery store in Morley, also in Mecosta County, several days before the police from several agencies tracked them to the cabin in western Lower Michigan. 
Lopez remained held Friday in the Mecosta Coutny Jail on $50,000 bond pending arraignment Oct. 19 on one bad-check charge and one of forgery. Conviction on either charge is punishable by up to 14 years' imprison­ment, court officials said. 
Power outages occurred in numerous areas, and many residents, some in bathrobes, gathered outside apartments and houses, waiting for more shocks. Others, camped out in a downtown parking lot, said they had been there since Thursday. 
"We are glad we stayed out here " said a man who identi­fied himself only as Hector. ''At least here we feel safe." 
Mildred Robbins, 66, of Ar­cadia, was pronounced dead at 5:14a.m. at Arcadia Methodist Hospital after going into full cardiac arrest, said adminis­trative supervisor Terry Pisenti. Efforts to revive her failed. 
Pisenti said the heart attack 
was attributed to the quake. 
More than 60 other quake­related injuries, mostly cuts from broken glass, bruises from being hit by falling ob­jects and anxiety-related chest pains and breathing problems, were reported at area hospi­tals.

Shut up and listen, I've got something to say 
"Shut up and listen!" 
Sometimes these words seem to be the only 
way to get anyone's attention around here. 
Everyone is so busy abusing, insulting and 
degrading each other through columns, letters 
and personals that discussion seems to be 
nearly a lost art. And the loss Qf this ability to 
communicate hurts the University as a place 
of education. 
Education is the primary goal of this learning institution; we may differ in our opinions about the appropriate process for that education or what it is that should be taught, but for the most part we acknowledge that we are here to learn. 
By education we mean more than just having our heads stuffed full of quadratic equations, Shakespeare and Church teachings. Education is not supposed to be a passive experience. The latin root of the word, "educere," means to lead forth or to draw out. The process of education when understood as a "drawing out " neces­sitates a free interplay of new and different ideas which are to be taken from others, ex­posed to criticism and eventually accepted or rejected. 
Clearly, then, the art of dialogue is essential to Notre Dame's work. Our ability to speak with and, more importantly, listen to each other is the litmus test by which we can judge our suc­cess as"a place'of, lt~arliing. 
In order to learn, we must listen. Yet it seems that more and more of us are unwilling to close our mouths and open our minds. Factionalism is rampant; we talk and associate only with others who share our views and from our snug nest of ideolo~y label everyone else as "them." 
It is ironic, though not surprising, that those factions which are at the extremes on this campus employ the very same attitude and method in dealing with issues like abortion, feminism and homosexuality. The campus "right" (who know that they are right) operate on a level of smugness. Their attitude boils down to, "I know the truth of this issue, and I have nothing more to learn about it. If you can­not see my position then you are a liberal and if you are a liberal you are a fool. I have no time for you or your opinions." The left, not to be outdone, responds, "You are wrong, you are very very wrong. The things which you believe are illusions and if you cannot see this you are obstinate and deserve to be attacked and mocked.'' 
There is no room for either of these attitudes in a community which wishes to foster learning and growth. · . 
If someone really believes that they see com­pellingly wrong in our views and if they wish to see reform, then it is incumbent upon them tp share their vision with us.

MARY JEAN 
Ann Pettifer, a columnist for Common Sense, has a valid point, I think, when she claims that irreverence is necessary for education. Ir­reverence can teach us much, especially when it is self-applied. However, Pettifer fails to see that thin and easily breached line between ir­reverence for sacred cows and disrespect for other's positions. Lately, it seems that the line is regularly crossed with impunity. 
Respect is the necessary first element of any useful discussion. Itmanifests itself in two ways in any dialogue ; the first is in allowing the op­position their opinion --no matter how falla­cious, ill-considered or plain offensive it may seem. We should listen to the other side if for no other reason than this: the more that we understand the opposition the better we under­stand our own beliefs. 
The second form of respect, self-respect, demands an even higher standard for discus­sion. The person who wishes to defend their po.si~ion must have the dignity to say, "Look, this IS my stand. What I have to say is important and even if you disagree with me, and attack me and condemn me my message is valuable. In fact, what I have to say so valuable that I will not stoop to personal attack, I will not resort to polemic and I will not lower myself to your standard of debate. My position does not need to be defended by such poor weapons; it stands on its own merits." 
Thank you for listening. You can talk now.

does not have the adverse ef­

he said. 
Nevertheless, he conceded certain people should be cau­tious about getting the shot. Pregnant women, people allergic to chicken eggs (the vaccine is grown inside a chicken egg) and people who have a fever or cold should con­sult a doctor before taking the shot, he said. 
Several types of people are more susceptible to influenza than the general population, according to Moriarity. Anyone taking drugs that sup­press the immune system (such as cortozone), afflicted by allergies or asthma, older than sixty or having a history of being immuno-deficiency are at high risk, he said.

Crime in decline: down 20 percent since 1981 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Americans were victimized by an esti­mated 34.1 million crimes last year, a decline of three­quarters of a million from 1985 and down more than 7 million from the peak year of 1981, the government reported Sunday. 
The survey of about 100,000 people in 50,000 households by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that the rate of violent crime dropped 6.3 percent last year compared to 1985 and has fallen 20 percent since 1981. The survey counts crimes whether or not they were reported to police and uses the results to estimate the number of cri­minal incidents nationwide. 
Criminologists say the five· year downward trend is due to the aging of the baby-boom generation, the movement of people born after World War II out of the age group most prone to commit crimes, those from 15 to 24. 
As the children of baby­boomers come of age in in­creasing numbers later this de­cade, crime levels should begin turning upward because of the "sheer number of children en-

Last year's figures may rep­resent a bottoming out of the decline, which showed some signs of slowing down in 1986, said Alfred Blumstein, dean of the school of urban and public affairs at Carnegie-Mellon Uni­versity in Pittsburgh. 
In the first three years of the decline which began in 1981, the number of crimes fell by nearly 6 million. 
The number of assaults per 1,000 people fell7.9 percent last year, while there were smaller declines in the rates of rape, theft, burglary and household larceny. 
Haig: Woodward's account accurate 
Associated Press 
HUDSON, N.H. -President Reagan was gravely ill follow­ing the attempt on his life in 1981 and he and the White House misrepresented his con­dition to the public, former Sec­retary of State Alexander Haig says. 
"If you knew the true story, it would make your hair stand on end," Haig said while touring the Liberty Millwork factory on Friday. 
Haig, campaigning in New Hampshire for the Republican presidential nomination, said he agreed with author Bob Woodward's depiction of a White House in chaos and a president who was seriously impaired after being shot in the chest. 
In his new book, "Veil: the Secret Wars of the CIA, 1981­1987," Woodward wrote that White House aides soon dis­covered that the smiling and waving president who left the hospital two weeks after the shooting had been acting for the public. 
The day after leaving the hospital, Woodward said, Reagan collapsed into a chair, spoke in a raspy whisper and had to use oxygen to recover. During the following days, the president was able to work or remain attentive only an hour or so a day, Woodward wrote. 
Sessions to take oath as director of FBI 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -William Sessions, now scheduled to take formal charge of the FBI later this week, said Saturday he felt fine but "a little gray" as he left a hospital where he had been treated for a bleeding ul­cer. 
Sessions originally had been scheduled to take the oath as FBI director at a ceremony last Thursday, but the proceedings had to be postponed when he was admitted into George Washington University Medi­cal Center after becoming ill on an airline flight. 
"I feel fine -a little gray ­but I feel good generally," Ses­sions told reporters as he left the hospital. 
He was accompanied by his wife, Alice, who carried a bou­quet of yellow roses. 
Sessions said his swearing-in ceremony had been res­cheduled for 2:30 p.m. Thursday at the FBI building. 
He praised his doctors and said he intended to follow their advice, which included a spe­cial diet and some medication. 
Sessions was stricken Wed­nesday night aboard an airliner on the way from Dallas to Washington and was taken by FBI officials from National Airport to the hospital. There, doctors discovered a previ­ously undiagnosed small ulcer in the upper portion of the small intestine. 
Sessions had taken aspirin on an empty stomach, became sick and fainted on the flight from Dallas. Doctors said the ulcer flared up when he took the aspirin.

Nicaraguan problem needs a deeper look 
Dear Editor: 
I feel the need to express my concern on the views presented by Glenn Fogarty in his September 29 column. Mr. Fogarty has presented a succinct, yet erroneous view of the Nicaraguan problem. I use the term "erroneous" because he has failed to look deep into the nature of the conflict, instead choos­ing to wave the flag of one-sided sta­tistics and hearsay. 
The Sandinista Government of Nicaragua is not perfect, but in the same sense it cannot be cast aside as the "Evil Empire" Mr. Fogarty claims it to be. The majority of his claims against the Sandinistas, such as the scarcity of food and resources, can be traced to the simple fact that the United States is funding an overtly covert war against Nicaragua. This war has put an incredible strain on both the political and the socio-economic status and its people. 
I am not making apologies for the actions of the Sandinistas, only asking that they be viewed in the context bf the Central American conflict. Mr. Fogarty forms his views from the U.S. State Department reports and Gallup Polls of Central Americans. I have formed my views through living in the region and sharing the joy and the pain of the people. These people do not es­pecially care for the Sandinistas, but in the same breath, tell of the pain suf­fered under the U.S. backed dictator­ship they (the Sandinistas) overthrew. The people I speak of are simple people, wanting only room to live in peace. 
Thus the picture is not clear as Mr. Fogarty would like us to believe. The Nicaraguan situation cannot be solved by misconceptions and overpowering rhetoric. We need to approach the pres­ent with an understanding of the past, if any progress is to be made for a bet­ter future.

Quote of the Day 
"If wrinkles must be written upon our brows, let them not be written upon our heart. The spirit should never grow old." 
Support of Contras lacks rationale 
Dear Editor: 
Excuse me, but the Sandinista Com­munists have not "hoodwinked the whole U.S.liberal spectrum into believ­ing that Nicaragua actually has a sweet and humane government and system." I find it amusing that the whole U.S. conservative spectrum chooses to view the Nicaraguan situation with a one­sided perspective. How convenient it is to ignore the flip side of "reality." Let's take another look. 
Please show me the "tender loving care" with which the Nicaraguan rebels treat the people. Our govern­ment supports their valiant fight for freedom and human rights. Where? The "Freedom Fighters" have been re­ported to kill the unarmed, including medical personnel. These murders are among many savage acts of human degradation. I wish we had such a bla­tant display of human rights in our country. I suppose we're to believe that all reports of Contra atrocities are fab­ricated by the Sandinistas. 
The sad truth is that the U.S. Gov­ernment does not support human rights in Central America. The U.S. Govern­ment, in fact, does not know what it supports. Didn't we help the Sandinis­tas overthrow the Somoza Dictator­ship? The Sandinistas made many promises about how they would repair Nicaragua. As soon as they showed Marxist tendencies, U.S. aid was cut off. And those darn Sandinistas never fulfilled their promises. Enter the Con­tras. Are they anti-Communist? Great, we're in! This time we're sure that we're supporting the "Good Guys". How do we know that they won't turn against us? It doesn't matter, I guess, as long as they're not Communist. Reagan (and everyone else who favors aid to the Contras) knows that they're corrupt, but chooses to overlook that. We'll support anyone who doesn't fol­low Communism (and we'll even claim that they advocate Social Justice.) 
Reagan's propaganda is very effec­tive, but some of us are too intelligent to forget that every issue has two sides. It's a beautiful piece of irony to encour­age violent action in a struggle for 
Garry Trudeau 
We've already heard a lot in these pages about presidential politics in this day and age. So what"is really going on? It used to be that campaigns cen­tered around certain key issues, such as a candidate's stand on domestic spending or his view of the Soviet Union. Or the media examined his vote­getting ability among certain groups and geographic regions. But lately, searching for news about the current presidential contest has been like flip­ping through the latest edition of People magazine. Some recent headlines? Gary Hart has love affair! Donna Rice tells all! Joe Biden plagiarizes Kinnock, Kennedy, et al! Biden cheats on law school paper! Patricia Schroeder won't run, tearfully cites the dread of endless "photo opportunities"! Nowadays, one is more likely to see the members of the media peering into bedrooms, sor­ting through trash, or rifling through grade school records. One wouldn't be surprised to see George Will replaced by Rona Barrett. 
Kevin Smant 
guest column 
Since Democratic candidates so far have borne the brunt of this media mucking, they have done the most com­plaining. Patricia Schroeder wept that she feared too many people would try to protect her from today's new­shounds. Joe Biden was angered --at himself, of course, but also at the press for digging so far into his past and ig­noring his pet issues (er --what were issues, anyway?) Most conspicuous was Gary Hart, who charged that the media, by its delving into candidates' personal lives, discouraged the best people from plunging into our electoral maelstrom. Hart warned that eventu­ally we as a nation must step back and examine what our election process is becoming. 
Ironic, isn't it? Two persons, both on the liberal side of our political spec­trum, have been burned by 1980s-style adversarial, muckraking journalism. Another liberal is at least partly deterred from running by the fear of the same. The irony is that liberals like 
Dooneabury 

Hart and Biden encouraged the media's adversarial role. Both of them, begin­ning their careers outside of the "es­tablishment", cheered on the press when those in power felt the bite of press watchdogs. They hailed the ille­gal acquisition of the Pentagon Papers, since it seemed to strike a blow against the U.S. presence in Vietnam. They en­joyed Woodward and Bernstein's revelations and their enemy Richard Nixon's subsequent downfall. The press was instrumental in providing fodder for gutting the CIA, in nearly talking the 1982 recession into a depression, and in unravelling the Iran-Contra af­fair. The liberals loved it. 
But a funny thing happened. Media cynicism cannot be turned on and off like a faucet. When liberals like Hart and Biden joined the Senate --and thus became a part of the formerly hated "establishment" --they were targets too. The adversarial role for the press, implanted in the Watergate and Viet­nam period, became a double-edged 
sword. The puppies of 1967 have come back to bite their masters in 1987.­Therefore, you'll excuse me if I don't weep along with Gary and Patricia, or share Joe's anger. Their bitter denun­ciations ring a bit hollow. 
This is not to say that Mr. Hart has no point. The fact is that the media has nearly become a fourth branch of gov­ernment. Anyone viewing the hostile at­mosphere of presidential press confer­ences, or the self-righteousness of the Sam Donaldsons of this world in defend­ing their cherished "role" in question­ing governmental officials, can sym­pathize with those on the receiving end. The problem? While the executive, legislative, and judicial branches all exist in a system of checks and balances, who checks and balances the press? 
Make no mistake, a free press is es­sential to our free society. But his scandal-sheet campaign journalism has gone far enough. Use your freedom, gentlemen of the press. But don't abuse it.

How to find the broker who fits your needs 
By JOHN WHOLIHAN 
Buslaess Writer 
This is the second in a series of investment tips for Notre Dame students. 
The first part of this series discussed the investment op­portunities available to the small investor in the stock mar­ket. 
This part of the series will focus on the differences of brokerage companies, and how these differences influence a new investor's choice of brokers. 
If a potential investor has funds that are ready to be in­vested, the first step is to decide with whom to place the funds. 
One of the most common ways to enter the stock market is to employ the services of a stockbroker. 
The first decision an investor faces is one of choosing either a full-service broker or a dis­count broker. A new investor must examine the advantages and disadvantages of each. 
A full-service broker is employed by a firm such as 
E.F. Hutton or Thompson McKinnon. These firms are full-service because they offer a wide range of investment ser­vices. 
An investor with money will have no trouble meeting with a broker. As a new investor, you will want to find somebody trustworthy and somebody who will work with you to meet your investment objectives. 
Many new investors will be referred to a stockbroker by a friend. This is usually a wise move since this will provide the novice with the confidence to proceed. 
After deciding on what type of investments to pursue the in­vestor should expect oc­casional contact from the bro­ker, as necessary, to keep informed of the investment. 
An investor should feel free to contact the broker and in­form him or her of any changes in financial position or invest­ment objectives. 
Wall St. 
at 
NO Ave. 

An investor pays approxi­mately three percent commis­sion on the standard stock transaction. Any investor, however, can use the resources of a full-service brokerage regardless of experience. 
These resources include the research reports that assist brokers in making recommen­dations on bonds and mutual funds, as well as stocks. 
Other services provided by full-service firms include infor­mation and opportunities to in­vest in limited partnerships, Individual Retirement Ac­counts (IRA) and insurance. 
The chief competitors of full­service brokerage firms are discount houses. 
These firms, such as Schwab and Quick & Reilly, charge less commission than their counter­parts. The savings amount to between thirty and fifty per­cent in many cases. 
Discount brokerage firms advertise daily in The Wall Street Journal and in the busi­ness section of local newspapers. 
Many banks, in addition, now offer a discount brokerage ser­vice. 
With a discount firm, an in­vestor calls and transacts busi­ness with a registered broker. This broker is not the investor's personal broker, and in most cases the investor will not speak with the same broker. 
The investor will not receive any investment advice or recommendations from a dis­count broker, thus the lower commission costs. 
Different discounters offer some of the services provided by a full-service firm. An in­vestor must therefore "shop around" in order to see what is available. 
Using a discount broker is a very economical way to invest if one is sure of his own deci­sions. Discounters are also good for one-time sales. 
One may want to liquidate stock received as a gift, for ex­ample and this would be the least expensive process. 
Some investors will use both types of brokers to handle their business. However, the deci­sion is up to you, the investor. Ifservices provided by the full­service firm outweigh the savings of the discounter, then full service is the way to go. 
We will talk about the differ­ent type of stock investments in the next installment.

NEW YORK -The stock mar­ket inched ahead Friday, recovering from some early selling as interest rates showed signs of steadying.

finishing the week with  a net

Stock Exchange came to 189.Q7 million shares, against 193.20 million in the previous session. 
Analysts said many traders had been impressed by the market's forceful rise Thursday, which seemed to sig­nal an end to the setback it suf­fered in late August and most of September. 
The advance paused Friday morning as interest rates rose in the bond market. But by midafternoon rates on long­term Treasury securities turned downward. 
Meanwhile, investors also were faced with signs of con­tinuing strength in the eco­nomy. The Labor Department reported that the civilian un­employment rate dropped to 
5.9 
percent in September from 

6.0 
percent the month before. 


The data showed an increase of 132,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, compared with a revised gain of 152,000 in Au­gust. 
Energy stocks were mostly higher as oil prices rose, spurred by talk in Iran of in­creasing tensions between that nation and the United States. Amoco gained 1 to 84; Atlantic Richfield 1 to 96; Occidental

Steel rebounding 
u The U.S. steel industry is turning around, and no company better exemplifies this than Northwestern Stc'll and Wire Co. Located west of Chicago, Northwestern has seen sales in­crease from $170 million to $400 million in the last 5 years. How do they compete? They work strictly from industry scrap metal, avoiding the more expensive ore processing. After three years of losses totaling over $100 million dollars, last year they had a $6 million profit followed by this year's profit of $6 million. The U.S. is back. 
u 'fhe Business of Politics. Many will agree that there is no frontrunner in the Democratic race for President. Many will also admit that they do not know what distinguishes one candidate from another. The winner may be the most suc­cessful fundraiser. 
Federal law states that for any given election an individual may not donate more than $1,000 to a candidate. Professional fundraisers will phone businesspeople for a $1,000 donation and then try to use the businesspeople's connections to find other $1,000 donors. The candidates with the most money will have the best chance of winning early primaries and caucuses, especially "Super Tuesday." 
Why do people donate to campaigns? Some people are enthusiastic about a certain candidate, while others will donate and arrange for other donations to make business connections. Large donators expect possible intangible returns. As far as the 1988 presidential race goes, the Democrats will field a few financially sound candidates, even if nobody knows what they stand for.

Business Briefs 

u The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, more com­monly known as the FDIC, is not enjoying a banner year even though economic indicators are rising. Last week, the FDIC announced that it expects to deal with 200 bank failures in the United States in 1987. With three failures in Houston last week, the national total so far this year is 141. Is your bank next? It might be if it is in Texas, where a troubled economy and a poor real estate market have contributed to a nation-leading 42 failures. 
u Happy Whatever! Greeting cards made the headlines this week. The number two greeting card company, American Greetings, recently announced that second quarter profits were off 82 percent from second quarter 1986. American Greetings, as a result, has adopted a competitive pricing strategy of lowering their prices to obtain more of the market. The company now controls about 35 percent of the market, trailing Hallmark by 5 percent. American Greetings hopes to end this pricing strategy if the retail sector of the economy improves. Greeting card retailers are expecting an improve­ment by Christmas. Retailers especially look forward to growing card sales because retailers usually enjoy a 100 percent markup on each card sold. 
u The Last Word. Ralph Waldo Emerson, as quoted in Forbes: "We are shut up in schools, and colleges, and recitaion-rooms, forteen or fifteen years, and come out at last with a bag of wind, a memory of words, and do not know anything.''

Advancing issues outnum­bered declines by about 8 to 7 in the overall tally on the NYSE, with 817 up, 706 down and 465 unchanged. The ex­change's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose .46 to 183.43. 
He also supports a proposal that would allow the United States, if the negotiations fail, to impose quotas or tariffs on products from countries that keep their restrictive trade policies. 
The threat of sanctions could be a potent negotiating tool to get countries to change their policies, making imposition of the sanctions unlikely, Jontz said.

Murphy at the near post, and he knocked it under the cros­sbar while falling backwards. 
"We needed that win," said Murphy. "I was just trying to stay down on it and not hit it over the goal." 
McCourt then put the game out of reach at the 108:20 mark when he took a cross from Roemer and beat Wisconsin keeper Bob Kollasch on the right side. 
The Badgers, ranked sixth in the region, fell to 8-4 on the season. 
"The kids are ready for a break," said Grace. "They've had four games in nine days. They need the break to recoup."

Bobby Bowden, who likes to 
win as much as any other 
coach, was kicking himself be­
cause he didn't play for a tie. 
Rather than let Derek 
Schmidt attempt an extra­
point kick that would have 
given the fourth-ranked 
Florida State Seminoles a tie 
with third-ranked arch-rival 
Miami, Fla., Bowden decided 
to go for a two-point conversion 
and a possible victory with 42 
seconds to play on Saturday. 
When Danny McManus' con­version pass was knocked down by Miami's Bubba McDowell, the Seminoles were left with a 26-25 loss.

No. 2 Nebraska 30, South Carolina 21 
Keith Jones rushed for 129 yards and scored two fourth­quarter touchdowns on 3-yard runs for Nebraska. Todd Ellis threw touchdown passes of 35 and 80 yards as South Carolina built a 21-13 lead midway through the third quarter.

No. 7 LSU 13, No. 19 Florida 1 0 
David Browndyke kicked a 24-yard field goal with 5:34 remaining to snap a 10-10 tie. Florida had a chance to tie it, but Robert McGinty was wide right on a 37-yard field goal at­tempt with 15 seconds remain­ing. 
No. 9 Ohio State 10, Illinois 6 
Tom Tupa ran five yards for a touchdown and Matt Frantz kicked a 32-yard field goal to give Ohio State a 10-0 lead early in the second quarter. Illinois dominated after that, but managed only Scott Mohr's 11­yard scoring pass to Anthony Williams with 6:22 to play. Il­linois reached the Ohio State 20 in the final minute before run­ning out of downs. 
No. 10 Tennessee 38, California 12 
Freshman Reggie Cobb scored on runs of 14 and one yards and also caught a 25-yard scoring pass for Tennessee. Quarterback Jeff Francis com­pleted 21 of 26 passes for 220 yards. 
No. 11 UCLA 49, Stanford 0 
Gaston Green, who became UCLA's career rushing leader, sprinted 91 yards for a touch­down and set up another on a 54-yard pass play. Green ran for 139 yards, increasing his career total to 3,217 yards and surpassing Freeman McNeil's total of 3,195.

Blair Thomas ran for 167 yards and two touchdowns as the Nittany Lions, 4-1, beat the Owls for the 13th consecutive time. Thomas surpassed 150 yards rushing for the third con­secutive game, the best Penn State streak since All­American John Cappelletti surpassed 150 yards in four con­secutive games in 1973.

Associated Press 
Pickets in Philadelphia closed the gates to the stadium and only 4,074 fans entered through a corridor of mounted police as thousands of union members supporting the NFL strike demonstrated at game sites on Sunday. 
In Detroit, seven people were arrested for disobeying a court order not to interfere with people entering the stadium. 
Supporters demonstrated without arrest in other NFL cities, including Denver, At­lanta, Cincinnati, Washington, Buffalo, New Orleans and Pit­tsburgh. 
In Philadelphia, three dozen trucks, tractor-trailer rigs and vans stopped bumper-to­bumper on the street next to Veterans Stadium 45 minutes before game time, paralyzing traffic. One truck had a sign that said, "Teamsters Don't Like Scabs." 
One car was attacked by pickets and had its windshield smashed and radio antenna ripped off. 
The game, which normally would draw about 60,000 people, was attended by only 4,074. Police said about 1,500 pickets were outside the ders of police directing traffic, stadium. authorities said.

'Strike Sunday' arrives for NFL 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -There was some good football, some mediocre football and enough bad football for a full show of "Football Follies." 
It was Strike Sunday in the NFL, a kaleidescope of picket lines, empty seats, strange plays, unlikely heroes and goats. 
"We've just witnessed a bit of history, I suppose," Bengals Coach Sam Wyche said after his team lost 10-9 to San Diego in a game marked by fumbles on three of the first eight plays. 
In most places, the "crowds," were hardly that, kept away by pickets or the prospect of B-team football. 
And where members of the A-Team showed up, they didn't always fare that well. 
The biggest hero among the picket-line crossers was the Colts' Gary Hogeboom, who tied a 22-year-old team record with five touchdown passes in the 47-6 rout of Buffalo. 
But St. Louis and New En­gland, with veterans back, lost to Washington and Cleveland, which had none. 
Dallas didn't bother to use Danny White, Tony Dorsett or Mike Renfro in its 38-24 win over the New York Jets, one of two previously unbeaten teams done in by the scrubs. Min­nesota, which lost to Green Bay 23-16, was the other. 
"Maybe we had an advan­tage in that not any of our guys came in,'' Washington Coach Joe Gibbs said after his team's 28-21 victory over the Car­dinals, who had eight veterans suited up. "The same group was able to practice together for 10 days." 
Just 4,074 fans showed up in Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium, where 1,500 picketers blocked all but one gate and some egg-throwing and car­smashing was reported. Inside, the new Chicago Bears looked just like the old ones, register­ing 11 sacks in a 35-3 win over the Eagles' replacements. 
There were 4,919 fans in 80,368-seat Pontiac Silverdome to watch the ersatz Tampa Bay Bucs come back from a 17-0 deficit to bat the Detroit Lions 31-27. And just 9,860 were in Buffalo's 80,000-seat Rich Stadium, where the Colts routed the Bills, 47-6. 
Atlanta, Seattle, New En­gland and New Orleans also had their smallest-ever crowds and there were just 27,728 in Washington's RFK Stadium, the first time in 160 games over 22 years that the Redskins didn't sell out. 
Mile High Stadium in Den­ver, which also always sells out, was only half full and the crowd of 38,494 dwindled to a few thousand in the second half as Houston moved out to what became a 40-10 victory over the Broncos. 
Management, predictably, saw a silver lining; the union called it a sham. 
"It's better than being shut down," said Tex Schramm, president of the Dallas Cow­boys and a member of the Man­agement Council's executive committee. 
"After what I saw on TV today, I felt bad my players are on strike," said Gene Upshaw, the executive director of the NFL players Association. "They're being cheated and the 
fans are being cheated." As for the games, a few of the heroes were old, but most were new. 
More often, the heroes were the likes of John Fourcade, Mike Hohensee, Ed Rubbert and Anthony Allen. Plus Vince Evans, an eight-year veteran who hadn't played since the USFL's Chicago team folded in 1985. 
Fourcade has three touch­down passes for New Orleans in a 37-13 win over the Rams in the Superdome, where the all­time low crowd of 29,745 chanted "Stay on Strike." Hohensee, a bartender until two weeks ago, threw his in Chicago's win in Philadelphia. 
Evans completed 10 of his 18 
passes for 248 yards and rushed 
for 63 yards on four carries for 
the Raiders. He threw for two 
touchdowns and scored his 
touchdown on a 4-yard bootleg 
run early in the second quarter. 
Rubbert, a rookie free-agent from Louisville and Allen, a former Atlanta Falcon and USFL player, combined on three touchdown passes in the Redskins' upset of the Car­dinals. Allen, who just arrived in camp Friday, set a Redskins' receiving record with 255 yards, including an 88­yard reception that was the longest for Washington in 12 years. 
There were also signs of in­eptitude, both by veterans and replacements. 
~here were nine turnovers and 26 penalties in Dallas' win over the Jets, in which Kevin Sweeney, cut in preseason, rephwed White and had just six completions, three for touch­downs. 
New England's Tony Collins, a starting running back who returned to camp this week, ran for just 24 yards in 15 carries and fumbled twice in another upset. The Patriots, with five veterans back, lost 20­10 to Cleveland, which had none. 
Ken Lacy, a former USFL player with the Kansas City Chiefs, fumbled twice in first­and-goal situations on the Los Angeles Raiders' 1-yard-line. The Raiders recovered both times.

At certain times of the season in basketball for in­stance, it's very difficult for us to find games. As we get into February and March great teams that we'd like to play are involved in their own confer­ence schedule or playoffs.
