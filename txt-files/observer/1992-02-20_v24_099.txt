House construction off to a good start 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Hous­ing construction began 1992 with a healthy 5.5 percent in­crease, the government said Wednesday, offering evidence that a housing upturn could be the vanguard of economic re­vival. 
The Commerce Department said builders started construc­tion on single-family homes and apartments at a seasonally-ad­justed annual rate of 1.12 mil­lion units in January, the high­est level since May 1990. 
The January gain followed a 
1.9 percent increase in Decem­ber, revised down from a previ­ous estimate of 2.6 percent, and marked the fourth consecutive month without a decline. 
Economists are counting on increased housing construction to help ensure recovery from a recession that started in July 1990. An upturn in housing construction and sales tend to stimulate sales of big-ticket factory goods such as furniture and appliances. 
President Bush, campaigning in Tennessee after a disappoint­ing showing in the New Hamp­shire primary, noted what he called the "rather dramatic kick up" in housing starts. 
But private economists said the report was not as strong as it appeared on the surface be­cause the increase was heavily concentrated in the Midwest and in apartment construction. 
"It's good. but it's not great," said economist Martin Regalia of the National Council of Community Bankers. "We're not out of the woods yet." 
Data on building permit ap­plications, considered a good barometer of future activity, was more positive though. Permit applications rose 6 per­cent. The increase reflected a strong rise for single-family homes and was spread across all regions except the West. 
Economist David Seiders of the National Association of Home Builders said low interest rates have dramatically in­creased the flow of customers through model homes. 
Thirty-five percent of builders surveyed in early February re­ported high customer traffic, up from 8 percent two months earlier. Meanwhile only 30 per-

INSIDE COLUMN 
''VIctory'' puts Bush on 
If New Hampshire is any 
indication of the opinions 
of the nation, George 
Bush seems to be in dire 
straits. 
He won the primary by an 18-point margin, in any other circumstances that could be considered a Lisa Eaton convincing victory, if not a Managing Editor landslide, but not this·--------­time. The fact remains that 41 percent of the Republicans in New Hampshire feel the state of the union is so bad that they would take the risk of voting for the "outsider," in lieu of enduring four more years of what Bush has to offer. 
In response to his deflating victory in New Hampshire, Bush said he would "roll up my sleeves" and campaign harder for the up­coming Super Tuesday. 
For instance, there is Tennessee. Bush commented on his prospects in that state by saying that it was not hit as badly by the re­cession and that the people there are still proud of their role in Desert Storm. Thus, he should finish much stronger there than in New Hampshire. 
Come on, George, get with the times. The war is over and the economy is a complete mess. Of course everybody is going to blame you. And, fortunately for the Democrats, you are giving them no reason not to. 
Inane references to the "I am not a wimp" war is simply proving to the American public that you are now and always will be a foreign policy president who really would rather hob­nob with prime ministers than deal with the real problems facing Americans. 
George you said that, "people feel the economy is poised for recovery." What people? Your country club born and bred friends or Joe and Jane Average American who have three kids to feed but to no job and no job prospects? Life in real America is none too pleasant, George. Maybe you should pull Dan off the golf course for a while and go find out just how unpleasant it really is out there. 
Pat Buchanan's amazing showing in the New Hampshire primary is indicative of the fact that Republicans and Democrats alike are unhappy with Bush's presidency. New Hampshire residents have set a strong precedent for the upcoming Super Tuesday primaries. Although Bush can still be considered the "front runner", he is no longer the "favorite," not a pleasant position for an incumbent who a year ago was looking forward to a relatively easy re-election. 
The tightening of the race among the Republicans is nothing but good news for the Democrats. The worse Buchanan makes Bush look, the better any Democrat's chances of gaining a residence on Pennsylvania Ave. It is not likely that Buchanan will get the Republican nomination. but every "amazing showing" he garners in the next few months is essentially a defeat for Bush. If Bush comes into the November election weakened by Buchanan's efforts, the Democrats will be one step closer to the White House.

Pollee seize cash 
•INDIANAPOLIS 
-State police may reap a windfall if nearly $150,000 seized during a routine traffic stop goes unclaimed, officials said. Under federal guidelines overseeing the distribution of property seized by law enforcement officials, the state police could receive up to 80 percent of the cash confiscated as suspected proceeds from illegal drug activity. A 30-year-old man driving a 197 2 Volkswagen Beetle stopped Monday night by Trooper Terry L. Dellarosa said he had no knowledge of the money and no intention of claiming it.

Cosmology project to measure waves 
YAKIMA, Wash. (APJ ­Cosmic waves will be measured to test Einstein's theory of rela­tivity in a new $200 million re­search project coming to the !Ianford nuclear reservation and a site in Louisiana. 
The National Science Founda­tion announced Wednesday that !Ianford and Livingston, La., near Baton Houge, have been chosen out of 19 candidates for one of the largest research projects in foundation history. 
The project will attempt to detect gravitational waves for the first lime. a discovery which could help explain the origins of the univHrse, said the Wash­ington, D.C-based NSF. 
"It opens a totally new win­dow on the universe," said Hochus Vogt, a director of the project and a professor at the California InstitutH of Technol­ogy. 
The project is funded by the NSF and operated by CalTech and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It is not related to Hanford's current mission of cleaning up waste left by nu­elear-weapons production at the site. 
The site decision is condi­tional and depends on further environmental analysis, NSF director Walter Massey said. though he noted there appear to be few obstadP.s at !Ianford. 
But it will involve construc­tion at each site of two huge L­shaped measuring devices 2.5 miles long, said U.S. HP.p. Sid Morrison, H-Wash., whose dis­triet indudes !Ianford in central Washington. 
The project is dedicated to detecting cosmic gravitational waves and harnessing those waves for scientific research, the NSF said. 
Those waves are ripples in the fabric of space and time produced by violent events in the distant universe, such as the cotrision of black holes or the explosion of a supernova. 
These ripples travel to Earth, bringing with them information about their origins and about the nature of gravity. 
Albert Einstein predicted the existence of these gravitational waves in 1918 in his general theory of relativity, but only now is technology powerful enough to harness them for science, the NSF said. 
The waves have never been directly detected, but scientists have been confident they exist, the foundation said. 
The new observatories raise the possibility of: 
•Verifying 
that gravitational waves exist. 

•Testing 
the general relativity theory's prediction that the waves propagate at the speed of light. 

•Testing 
the theory's predic­tion that the waves stretch matter in one direction while squeezing it in another. 

•Verifying 
that black holes exist.

Jackson angers fans: Quits tour 
LONDON (API -Hock star Michael .Jackson abandoned a private tour of Africa that was rapidly becoming a public rela­tions nightmare and flew to London on Wednesday. 
Jackson had angered his hosts in Ivory Coast by constantly holding his nose; a special statement was issued to assure fans he did not think Africa smelled. A .Jackson aide, Bob Jones, described it as the nervous twitch of a shy person. 
The 33-year-old entertainer flew into Stansted airport, north of London, with 26 members of his entourage aboard a private jet Wednesday. Customs and immigration officials went to the plane so he could avoid fans and journalists. Jackson began his trip to Africa on Feb. 11 in Gabon; went on to Ivory Coast, and continued on to Tanzania on Monday. lie dropped a planned safari in Tanzania and skipped Kenya altogether. 
Edward Ngewe, manager of the Kilimanjaro Hotel where Jackson and his entourage stayed in Tanzania, said he was told Jackson decided not to fly to north Tanzania because it meant going by small plane and "he doesn't like to board small planes."

O'Hare's namesake remembered 
CHICAGO (AP) -O'Hare is an often-cursed name among air­line passengers whose flights are delayed at the nation's bus­iest airport. 
But few of the 60 million people who pass through O'Hare each year know the story of the World War II hero it honors -or the young man's family link to Chicago's gang­land past. 
"Our memory span is short," Chicago Alderman Edward Burke said recently. "As a peo­ple, we don't seem to remember why things are named as they are." 
O'Hare is named for Navy Lt. Edward "Butch" O'Hare, who 
single-handedly downed six 
Japanese bombers 50 years ago 
Thursday in one of the war's 
most celebrated feats. 
A ceremony is planned at the 
airport Thursday to mark the 
occasion. 
On Feb. 20, 1942, the 27­
year-old O'Hare was the only ·fighter pilot in the air when nine Japanese twin-engine bombers suddenly approached the USS Lexington off the 
Gilbert Islands in the Pacific. 
"Somebody yelled, 'Nine of 
them, and he's up there alone!"' 
recalled Lexington radioman 
Joseph C. Brazda. "After that, 
nobody said a word. They were 
all just watching and hoping 
and praying." 
As the Lexington's other pilots scrambled and the rest of the crew watched, O'Hare flew his Grumman F4 "Wildcat" above the bombers, then dived toward one of them. In a matter of seconds, the bomber was in flames and plunging toward the sea. 
Brazda said O'Hare evaded the Japanese tailgunners, re­gained altitude and swooped down again to take out another bomber. 
"After that, O'Hare just kept doing it," Brazda said. "It was unbelievable."

Pope begins tour of Islamic West Africa 

DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -Pope John Paul II said Wednesday he is proud of the church support for the Solidarity labor move­ment in his native Poland after the Communists sought to crush it a decade ago. 
Responding to a Time magazine report that he and former President Reagan formed a secret network to help Solidarity after it was outlawed by communist authorities in 1981, he denied that a "formal alliance" had existed, but said both men were committed to fighting totalitarianism. 
The pope spoke to reporters en route to this West African capital, first stop on a weeklong pilgrimage to three largely Muslim countries with tiny Ro­man Catholic minorities. Of Senegal's 7.7 million people, 85 percent are Muslim and only 5 percent Catholic. John Paul will proceed to Gambia and Guinea. 
Thousands of Senegalese lined the papal motorcade along a sand and red dirt strip connecting the oceanside air­port to Dakar. 
This is the pope's eighth visit to Africa and his 54th foreign tour. Arriving in Senegal, which is 85 percent Muslim and only 5 percent Catholic, he said the two religions and followers of traditional religion must coop­erate. 
"I hope that my visit con­tributes to strengthening the links of brotherhood among all people, as it should be between sons and daughters of the same nation," he said. 
Striking a theme he has sounded following the recent changes in Europe, he stressed that wealthy nations "must not forget" to support their brothers and sisters in Africa, while responding to other appeals for help from eastern Europe. 
John Paul, speaking about the Time report, referred to Reagan as a "great political leader.," 
The Vatican has denied help­ing funnel secret funds to Soli­darity, but the pope expressed surprise his backing of Solidar­ity might be questioned. 
John Paul supported Solidar­ity leader Lech Walesa, now president of post-communist Poland. 
He said that as a pastor, his policies were based on "moral principles," including defense of human rights. John Paul said the Communists "unjustly crushed" Solidarity.

Report: U.S. tests may hurt education reform 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Pro­
posed national tests could be­
come a barrier to many educa­
tional reforms by encouraging 
schools to emphasize scores 
over learning, a House sub­
committee was told Wednesday. 
Michael Feuer of the con­
gressional Office of Technology 
Assessment said the office's 
two-year study found that 
American students are taking 
more achievement tests than 
ever before but few if any of the 
exams "tell us what we need to 
know." 
One of the reasons. Feuer said. is because standardized test results have been attached to sueh "high stakes" conse­quenees as ranking students or schools, or pegging students for promotion and graduation. These policies encourage exces­sive focus on improved scores rather than increased learning, he said told a !louse Education and Labor subcommittee. 
Feuer said the study, "Testing in American Schools: Asking the Right Questions." suggests that Congress go slow in adopting recommendations by a government advisory panel that advocates a voluntary national standard curriculum and tests. 
"Unless key questions about the design, uses, and gover­nance of a national test and the interpretation of its results are addressed, a system of national tests could easily become a barrier to many educational re­forms already in motion and spur a new round of frustration with the U.S. school system as a whole," Feuer said the study concluded. 
Standardized tests are admin­istered and scored under uni­form conditions for children in different classrooms, schools. districts, and states. Usually these results are used for broader school management and policy decisions, but Feuer said the test information can be misinterpreted. 
"Tests, after all, are only tools of estimation. and test results can vary for reasons that may have little to do with a student's real level of knowledge or achievement," said Feuer. 
However, Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado and Bella Rosenberg of the American Federation of Teachers insisted that Congress needed to act quickly to estab­lish voluntary national stan­dards and a new assessment system in mathematics, history, • English, science and geography. 
A national school curriculum was proposed in a January re­port to Congress by the National Council on Education Standards and Testing. The 32-member group recommended that states be offered, but not required to adopt. a national curriculum to raise the standards of American schools to that of other industrialized nations. 
The curriculum would be linked to a "voluntary system of assessments" under which tests would be designed to determine whether students were meeting the new. tougher standards. 
"We are not asking for addi­tional tests," Romer told the Subcommittee on Elementary, Secondary and Vocational Edu­cation. "We are asking that we develop a test that really does what we want." 
Rosenberg said, "It is hard to imagine how we could have conducted an education reform movement" the past nine years "without deciding what we wanted our students to know and be able to do. It is even harder to imagine how we will meet the national education goals related to student achievement without so decid­ing."

De Klerk's party loses election 
POTCHEFSTROOM, South Africa (AP) -President F.W. de Klerk's National Party suffered an embarrassing defeat Wednesday in a hi-election con­sidered a gauge of white sup­port for his efforts to share power with blacks. 
Andries Beyers of the pro­apartheid Conservative Party defeated his National Party op­ponent, Theunis Kruger, by 2,140 votes out of more than 17,000 cast for a seat held by the Nationals since 1948. 
The whites-only election in the Potchefstroom constituency of rural western Transvaal Province marked the second major defeat in three months for the National Party in a par­liamentary by-election. 
De Klerk's party has a strong majority in the dominant white chamber of Parliament and he has promised to continue re­forms. 
But both parties had called the election an indication of white support for them. Con­servative Party leaders contend a majority of whites oppose the reforms. 
The Conservative leaders are trying to trigger an electoral backlash to oust the National Party government. and the Con­servative victory could encour­age more whites to cross over from the National Party. Na­tional opinion polls show the government's support among whites is crumbling. 
Conservative supporters erected a statue of black leader Nelson Mandela resembling a Frankenstein figure in front of the polling station. Several CP members briefly scuffled with a black telephone company worker. saying he had no right to be at the polling station. 
"We are voting for the white man. We will never give power to the blacks," said Conservative supporter Jannie van Vuuren. 
The by-election was required after the incumbent died last year.

Current Economic Issues 
Oliver F. Williams Associate Provost 

The environment and religious social teaching 
According to the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, over 22,000 manufacturing plants discharged toxic chemicals in the United States last year. 
The ten biggest polluters include some firms that are household names including DuPont, Monsanto, Eastman Kodak and Phelps Dodge. The total amount of toxic chemicals emitted nationwide last year in the air, water, land and underground sewage is calculated to be 5,710,828,027 pounds! 
What is becoming clear is that maintaining a healthy environment is a challenge that has to involve everyone. Whether ·it be global warming or ozone depletion, we are constantly reminded today that there are limits to what we can do to the environment and still enjoy a healthy and safe life. 
While the market economy has yielded a great increase in the material standard of living in our land, many have argued that a single-minded focus on profit has eclipsed our concern for the common good. 
While accepting the value of a market economy, religious social thought argues that one must have a conscious concern for the common good of all, and not depend on unconscious workings of the market, the "hidden hand" to solve all problems. 
Some disciples of Adam Smith believed in God's providence working to insure the common good, a self­regulating economy. Religious social thought says, in effect, that we must make God' work our own, that we must have a conscious care for the common good. 
This sometimes requires unusual ethical character of business leaders and often government regulation of the market. To be sure, regulation is tricky business and the good consequences sought are often elusive. Failure in particular regulation is no argument against regulation, but rather one for better regulation. 
We must learn how to do it right; deciding on appropriate social regulation to protect our air and water without crippling the economy entails much debate and often trial and error but it is a challenge that must be met. 
Harvard Business School professor George Lodge has long championed what he calls communitarianism. He argues persuasively that this is the position implicit in the Catholic social teaching, especially in the writings of John Paul II. 
In presenting communitarianism to the business community, Lodge says, "The community-New York City, for example-is more than the sum of individuals in it; the community is organic, not atomistic." "It has special and urgent needs as a community. The survival and self-respect of the individuals in it depend on the recognition of those needs." 
Both Lodge and Catholic social teaching have consciously developed positions in opposition to that of the influential philosopher John Locke (1632-1704) and the school of thought known in Europe as "liberalism" and often referred to as libertarianism in the United States. 
In libertarian thought, society is understood as a collection of individuals who have come together to promote and protect their private rights and interests. For Locke the law of nature is the basis for commutative justice which provides the norms for contractual and ex­change relationships between atomistic individuals. 
Communitarianism, on the contrary, holds that the person is by nature ~0cial, not by choice. The need for others, for community, is a constitutive dimension of the person. 
Thus the "law of nature" grounds not only a commutative justice but also a distributive and a social justice as well. 
The seriousness of environmental problems is drawing more and more people to evaluate business firms on their conscious concern for the common good. 
To highlight the importance of business in preserving and promoting an environmental ethic, The Center for Ethics and Religious Values in Business is planning a major conference on the environment next fall, September 29-30, where business leaders and environment experts will come together at Notre Dame to discuss the issues. 
This is one of the many opportunities to become involved in environmental concerns that are crucial for all of us.

Senate bans new offshore drilling 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Senate wants to make sure a moratorium sticks against oil or gas drilling off much of the U.S. coastline -at least until the end of the decade. 
Senators approved a measure by voice vote Tuesday that would ban new oil or gas leases off either the Atlantic or Pacific coasts. 
The prohibition was added to a wide-ranging energy bill Senate leaders predicted would be approved today. A similar energy package is in the House, but its prospects are uncertain. 
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he expected a final vote on the bill late in the day, but not before senators considered a half-dozen additional amendments. 
The Senate action on offshore oil leases did not include Florida's 
Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas Brady said that the absence of in a row. President Bush, campaigning in inflationary pressures should give the Federal Reserve plenty of room Tennessee, noted what he called "the to cut rates further. The Federal Reserve stressed the low rates of rather dramatic kick-up" in housing inflation in a statement to Congress Wednesday. starts. 
House rejects proposal to redesign coins 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Lincoln Memorial is safe on the "tails" side of pennies, and Thomas Jefferson's home will stay on the nickel. The U.S. House on Wednesday rejected a proposal to redesign the nation's coins. 
On a 241-172 vote, the House defeated a Senate-passed measure to strip the eagle, the Statue of Liberty's torch, Monticello and the Lincoln Memorial from the quarter, dime, nickel and penny beginning next January. 
"What's wrong the current designs? They represent the stability and continuity of our nation," said Rep. AI McCandless, R-Calif., who led the opposition. "The American people do not want their coins redesigned." 
Both the Bush and Reagan administrations had opposed the proposal. But the White House dropped its opposition after the Senate last November attached the measure to a pet project of First Lady Barbara Bush's to finance the White House's collection of fine arts and antiques. 
Also in the package defeated Wednesday were special com­memorative coins to honor the 
coastal waters, some of which are believed to have substantial oil or natural gas reserves. 
Among the measures still to be considered is a proposal by Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., that would prohibit offshore oil exploration within 100 miles of Florida's coast and generally give governors a greater say in federal oil and gas leasing activities. 
The energy legislation also would make it easier to build nuclear power plants and natural gas pipelines, require wider us of alternative fuels by both government and private fleet owners and set more energy efficient standards for lights and electric motors. 
The bill, as amended Tuesday, would prohibit the Department of the Interior from selling oil or gas leases anywhere off the Atlantic 
Greenspan sees road to recovery 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress Wednesday that the nation's economy, though still "troubled," is on the road to at least a modest recovery that should be accompanied by the best performance on inflation in a generation. 
Greenspan noted encouraging signs of strength in housing and retail sales and said the government was tracking weekly data that indicated January's huge plunge in industrial production would not be repeated this month. 
"We are beginning to see stirrings" that suggest "some modest quickening" in the economy as the year unfolds, he told a House Banking subcommittee. 
All of this is being accomplished in an environment where the underlying rate of inflation is declining, he said, offering the prospect "that within the foreseeable future we will have attained the lowest rates of inflation in a generation." 
Supporting Greenspan's assessment of the economy, the government reported Thursday that consumer prices rose a minuscule 0.1 percent in January, reflecting falling energy prices and a drop in food costs. 

Economists, who are counting on a gain in housing to lead the country out of recession, were heartened by the report 
AP showing the January increase, the fourth 
World Cup soccer games, Christopher Columbus, James Madison and the 640,000 veterans of Desert Storm. 
Supporters of the commemo­rative coins, including a White House commemorative wanted by Mrs. Bush, said all of them can be included in a new bill that excludes coin redesign and was approved in the House without a roll-call vote. 
The defeated legislation would have ordered the reverse or tails sides of all coins to be redesigned at the rate of at least one a year, beginning next January. 
The weight, size and color of each coin would not change. And portraits although not necessarily the same ones -of Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, George Washington and John F. Kennedy -would still adorn the obverse or "heads" sides of the penny. nickel, dime, quarter and half dollar. 
Not specified was how the new coins should look, only that the new designs be selected by the 
U.S. Treasury in consultation with the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts. Supporters had said they coast from the Georges Banks off New England to waters off Georgia -as well in coastal waters off Oregon and Washington. 
The bill already had prohibited lease sales off California. 
Most of the waters covered by the bill already have been part of an administrative lease moratorium announced by President Bush in 1990. But en­vironmentalists have sought a legislative freeze, fearful Bush might one day rescind his ad­ministrative order. 
Meanwhile, Alaska's two sen­ators abandoned their effort to reopen the question of oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northern Alaska rather than risk having the entire bill scuttled by opponents of drilling in the refuge. 
envisioned the arts commission holding a design contest. 
New coin designs had been a crusade of retiring Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and former arts commission member Diane Wolf, a friend of Cranston's. She is now a fund-raiser for Patrick Buchanan's presidential campaign. 
The Senate has passed the measure seven times without a single vote in opposition since 1988. But key House members had prevented the bill from getting a vote until Wednesday, heeding warnings from the U.S. Mint and some numismatic experts that Americans feel "uneasy" about changing their money. 
With the country in a recession and millions of people unemployed, Rep. Frank An­nunzio, D-Ill., called the measure "frivolous and unnecessary artistic meddling." 
"Worrying about how our na­tion's money looks, rather than how strong our money is, opens this House up to charges of wasting time instead of dealing with our economic woes," he said.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Abortion wrongly pits women vs. unborn 
Dear Editor: 
In his responsive article to Peter Helland, Dave Mack illus­trates the two major flaws in­herent in the pro-choice stance. First, Mr. Mack supports the pro-choice view that the unborn child's life has no innate value. While he mentions the ongoing debate concerning the begin­ning of life, he chooses to ignore some important facts. 
According to national law, abortion is solely the decision of the mother and her doctor in the first trimester. At this time, however, the baby has a heart that pumps blood and is active, moving its arms and iegs and closing its mouth. In the second trimester, the mother can still seek an abortion, but states can regulate the time and method of the abortion for the protection of the mother's health. At this time, all the major features have been formed, the baby is active, and even prefers a certain position in the womb. 
Even though the existence and attributes of the unborn child are proven facts, Mr. Mack chooses to ignore them. He does not feel he needs to show compassion for the unborn, be­cause, since it is in the womb, its existence does not have to be acknowledged. 
Consequently, if the unborn child has an existence that can be ignored, it has no value in it­ielf. In the eyes of a pro-choice supporter, the unborn child derives its value from the mother. If she wants it, it has value. An unborn child, how­ever, is not an object or a piece of property that is only valuable

insofar as it is useful or wanted. 
It is a living, growing, human 
being. 
The unborn child has value in 
itself, independent of any value 
which may be placed in it from 
anyone else. Thus, even though 
followers of the pro-choice 
stance are unwilling to extend 
it, the unborn child deserves re­
spect and compassion like any­
one else. 
Second, Mr. Mack supports the view that the issue of abortion is a battle pitting women vs. their unborn children and an overbearing, judgmental so­ciety. The pro-choice move­ment has very successfully promoted the abortion issue in such a dichotomous, mutually­exclusive way. 
In doing so, they have made it very difficult to oppose or even have a mixed opinion about abortion, because opposition to abortion equals opposition to women. Mr. Mack perfectly ex­emplifies one falling into this media trap when he says, "I de­cided to care for the women who have no other choice or must face an unwanted preg­nancy." Since the issue is pre­sented in the form of women vs. the unborn or women vs. soci­ety, he feels that the only way he can support women is to support the pro-choice stance. 
The major opposition group, the pro-life movement, has also fallen prey to the pro-choice media blitz. Through their own rhetoric and their adversarial tactics, namely the aggressive and often ugly protests of abortion clinics, the pro-life movement fits perfectly in the role of the large, judgmental portion of society which wishes to impose its morals on poor, defenseless women. As defend­ers of the unborn, the pro-life movement has very nicely picked up the gauntlet against the freedom and liberty of the women of the world. 
Abortion is not the battle which the pro-choice movement would like to promote, and a true, effective anti-abortion stance needs to go beyond the pro-life movement. Abortion is a social problem in which all the participants, the mothers and the children alike, are vic­tims deserving respect, com­passion, and love. In this re­spect, Mr. Mack was correct in demanding compassion for the women, but compassion is not a finite quantity to be spent on one or the other. Each person whether born or unborn de­serves compassion, because they are all victims. 
Abortion is wrong, and it should be outlawed. However, legislation is not enough, be­cause it only supports the di­chotomy of women vs. an inter­fering society. The anti-abor­tion movement should attack not the women but the underly­ing social causes of abortion ­poverty, lack of proper medical care, lack of education, and the breakdown of the family. Only by attacking abortion at the social as well as the legislative level, can the anti-abortion movement gain any credibility and effectively reduce abor­tions.

Exaggeration blockades efforts for peace in Ireland 
Dear Editor: 
On behalf of Stanford Hall we would like to thank all of those who attended or donated to the 7th Annual Mr. Stanford Contest on Saturday, February 8th. With your generous help we were able to raise over $1,200 for the Logan Center of South Bend. We are glad that most in attendance enjoyed the evening, but we recognize that this was not the case for all. Humor is an inexact science 
Dear Editor: 
Northern Ireland may be misunderstood in America and recent letters to The Observer seem to intend to keep it that way. Certainly there are signifi­cant problems in Belfast due to religious differences. It is, however, not nearly as stark as it has been portrayed. 
Unemployment at 14 percent is lower than that in the Republic and in the civil service, which account for nearly half of those employed; employment is roughly proportional to religion. "Ordinary decent crime" rates are among the lowest in the western world. But the most and to anyone in attendance who found some of the contes­tants acts in poor taste, we are sorry. 
Once again we thank all of those who attended and made the event a great success for Stanford Hall, but much more importantly, the Logan Center.

appalling thing was to categorize the IRA as some sort of "conscientious terrorists." 
The situation is not so ex­treme as to justify their violent acts or those of the British army nor that of the various intolerant extremist Catholic and Protestant gangs. Making exaggerated claims designed to appeal to primal Catholic trib­alism only serve to exacerbate the war of words and guns and accomplish nothing towards achieving peace and justice.

New Zealand maintains advantage in America's Cup challenger series 
SAN DIEGO (AP) -New Zealand maintained its Round 2 lead in the America's Cup Challenger Selection Series by downing its closest rival, sec­ond-place Italy's Il Moro di Venezia, by 1 minute, 16 sec­onds Wednesday. 
The New Zealand boat, skip­pered by Coronado, Calif.-born 
Rod Davis, took advantage of a favorable wind shift early in the race and led every leg of the eight-leg, 20.03-mile race. 
"On the reaching legs, the Kiwis are a little faster," said II Moro skipper Paul Cayard. "But the down side of their flatter hull shape is that in light and lumpy conditions, they're going to do a lot of pounding and it may hurt them." 
New Zealand's record im­proved to 10-1 for a total of 22 points. II Moro, 8-2, dropped to third, with 17 points. 
"Close racing will make the best challenger," Davis said. "The challenger that survives that contest will be stronger 
and better able to win the cup." 
Japan's Nippon overcame kelp on the keel and a broken spinnaker halyard to down winless Challenge Australia by 
3:33. The victory gave Nippon a 9-2 record and 18 points, mov­ing the Japanese into second place. 
Nippon was stopped dead in the water at the fourth mark while two crew members jumped into the ocean to clear kelp from the keel. 
"I felt it was very important to the whole team to volunteer, to sacrifice, to go into the water and with my hand and grab the kelp," winch grinder Taketaro Suize said through an interpreter.

Yamaguchi, Kerrigan battle for skating gold 
ALBERTVILLE. France (AP) -Nearly perfect, Americans Kristi Yamaguchi and Nancy Kerrigan are poised for gold and silver in women's figure skating after Midori Ito's triple lutz turned into a triple klutz. 
The glamor show of the Winter Games. set up as a showdown between Yamaguchi and Ito. looks more like an American affair with a touch of French nair. 
France's Surya Bonaly took advantage of Ito's fall to vault past her into third Wednesday night, leaving Japan's former world champion fourth, France's Laetitia Hubert fifth and America's Tonya !larding sixth going into Friday's free skate finale. 
Ito looked stunned. almost numb, as she lnft the ice, her effnrvescent smile absnnt. But

she controlled her emotions at the disappointing scores and shed no tears. 
"I am sorry," Ito said. "I did not think I would fail the triple lutz." 
Harding, the only other woman to do the 3 1/2-revolu­tion jump, missed the axel for the third straight time in com­petition and skipped the dou­ble-toe loop that was to follow it. 
Kerrigan. the world bronze medalist and runner-up at last month's U.S. championships, was the first medals contender on the ice. After struggling all week in practice with her triple lutz-double toe loop combina­tion, she nailed it this time and skated an almost effort-free program. 
"I didn't have the pressure on me as much as the others," Kerrigan said. "But I have to go out and think about my skating and do my job. The rest is out of my hands." 
Bonaly, European champion the last two years, hesitated once between a triple lutz and a double toe loop but stayed up and got the partisan crowd clapping as she moved into po­sition to win France's second­ever ladies' figure skating medal. Jacqueline du Bief won a bronze in 1952. 
A crash claimed two-time defending World Cup circuit champion Petra Kronberger of Austria, who tumbled near the bottom on her first run of the giant slalom after hitting a gate too hard with her left arm. 
No such problems affected 
gold medalist Pernilla Wiberg, a 21-year-old Swede who dis­played the flair of childhood idol Ingemar Stenmark in a dramatic second run. 
"I was thinking about him when I looked at the second run," Wiberg said. "But I don't think I felt like him when I was skiing." 
Wiberg's two runs added up to 2 minutes, 12.74 seconds, .97 seconds faster than dual silver medalists Roffe and Austria's Anita Wachter. 
Roffe, who joined downhiller Hilary Lindh as an American Alpine silver medalist, grabbed the lead and nearly the gold with an afternoon run of 
1:06.50. Five racers took a shot at Roffe's time and failed before Wachter, the combined gold medalist in 1988, tied her with only two racers left.

World champion Swedes knocked out of Olympic hockey 
MERIBEL. France (AP) -An old foe with a new name will get a shot at the United States in Olympic hockey. Sweden won't. 
The world champion and top seed, Sweden was upset 3-1 by Czechoslovakia in the quarter­finals Wednesday. 
"Our older players, they were really motivated for this tour­nament because it could be the last chance for them to get a gold medal," Swedish assistant coach Curt Lundmark said. "We were here as the favorites and we knew it. I think our older players are the most dis­appointed." 
Otakar J anecky snapped a third-period tie and Petr Briza made 29 saves for Czecho­slovakia (5-1), the only team to beat both co-favorites. Canada advanced to Friday's semifinal against Czecho-slovakia (5-1). 
The Swedes, who scored three goals in the final period to tie the United States in the pre­limninary round finale, are out. Waiting there for the United

States in Friday's semifinals, though, is the Unified Team. 
It pushed its record to 5-1 with a 6-1 victory over Finland. And on Friday it plays the United States (5-0-1), the only unbeaten team in the tourna­ment. 
The last time the teams met in the medal round was in 1980, when the Unified Team played under the Soviet flag and the U.S. team pulled off the Miracle on Ice -beating the Soviets 4-3 and then defeating Finland to win the gold. 
Unified Team assistant coach Igor Dimitriev said he and coach Viktor Tikhonov do not discourage their players from recalling 1980, when many were teen-agers. 
"There's some talking going on about the Winter Olympics that took place in Lake Placid," Dimitriev said. "We tell the players that the American team that took the gold medal in 1980 was a very good team. It serves as an example for our players." 
The players must have been listening to their mentors. The Soviet Union won gold medals in 1984 and 1988 and the Unified Team, the second seed, appears to be the top contender again in 1992. It is the lOth time in 10 tries that the team has reached the final four. 
The Swedes won't get another chance to play the United States in the Olympics until at least 1994. The teams hadn't been fierce rivals until this month, when two physical games put both clubs on edge. 
After an exhibition game three days before the Olympics, Sweden accused the U.S. team of dirty and overly physical play. Just 2:04 into the rematch on Monday, Sweden's Mats Naslund sent U.S. defenseman Greg Brown to the hospital with a concussion, broken nose and facial lacerations. 
Had Sweden beaten Czecho­slovakia, it might have played the Americans again, either for the bronze or gold medal. 
Asked if he was disappointed that his team wouldn't get an­other chance to play the U.S. team, Lundmark said: "Why should I be? We played them twice. That's enough." 
Now Sweden (3-1-2) and Finland (3-2-1) can do no better than fifth place. They meet in a consolation game on Thursday. Finland was the 1988 silver medalist. 
Jaroslav Walter, Czecho­slovakia's assistant coach, said his team is due to beat the Canadians. 
"We have played them five times during this season and they have beaten us all five," he said. "I do hope we'll be the winners the sixth time." 
The Czechoslovaks won the silver medal in 1984 but have fallen on hard times since. Most of their best players have left to play professionally. Politically, Czechoslovakia's has troubles­its economy is in shambles.

Snyder fills void for SMC hoops 
By CHRIS BACON 
Sports Writer 
Often people talk about an athlete's talent or style to explain success on the court or in the field. 
But when it comes right down to it, the underlying factor is confidence. Without it, no player can hit the home run, run for the touchdown, or hit the jumper. 
Case in point: Saint Mary's basketball player Julie Snyder. 
Snyder already has almost tripled her total statistics from last season. The key for her success-increased confidence. 
"My confidence has gone up," said Snyder. ''I've always been capable of doing well. I haven't reached my full capacity, but I'm starting to." 
"Julie has really come on for us," added Belles coach Don Cromer. "She gets up and down the court for us." 
Cromer has nothing but praise for his 6-foot junior center from Grand Rapids, Michigan. Blocking 24 shots this season, including eight against Olivet College Tuesday night, Snyder has become the inside force for the Belles. 
"In practice, she does a beautiful job," said Cromer. "In games though, she would tighten up and get nervous on us. But in the Hope game, she said to me that she was going to have fun. And she has improved every game since then." 
Snyder's confidence is evident on the court. In the last five games, Snyder has grabbed 41 rebounds, almost half of her season total of 105. She has also smashed her 1990-91 season total of 81.

But even more noticeable is Snyder's new-found shooting ability. Snyder has already tripled her shot attempts, and is sinking 54.7 percent of them. She is the fourth Belles' player to score more than 100 points this season (127) and averages 7.5 points per game. Last sea­son, Snyder only scored 47 points. 
In the absence of senior Janet Libbing, Snyder has stepped forward to lead the Belles in the paint. Snyder led the Belles with a season-high 23 points and 13 rebounds against Beloit. In addition to her eight blocked shots, Snyder stepped up to grab 10 rebounds and tally 14 points against Olivet. 
"I've improved my inside moves," Snyder said. "''ve been taking it to the basket more. And in the last three games, I've been shooting a lot more." 
"Tuesday night on defense she was outstanding, just outstanding," praised Cromer. "If she keeps improving like she is, in a couple of days she'll be an All­American." 
On Saturday, Saint Mary's looks to rebound from Tuesday's loss to Olivet against Kalamazoo College. 
Last year, the Belles exterminated the Lady Hornets 97-57 in Kalamazoo, and they will be looking to Snyder and team­mates Catherine Restovich and Kim Holmes to lead them to a second straight victory over Kalamazoo. 
But Snyder realizes it won't be easy. The Observer/Marguerite Schropp

Jordan's 27 paces Chicago past Orlando 
ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) ­Michael Jordan scored 22 of his 27 points in the first half, and the Chicago Bulls rallied from a 10-point deficit in the second quarter to beat the Orlando Magic 112-99 Wednesday night. 
Jordan also had 10 rebounds and eight assists. The Bulls, who improved the league's best road record to 20-7, are now 23-0 in games in which they've held the opponents to fewer than 100 points. 
Nets 1 06, Pistons 1 02 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. ­Backup guard Tate George scored 10 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter, lifting home­happy New Jersey over Detroit. 
Drazen Petrovic had 25 points and Derrick Coleman 20 for the Nets, who have won eight of nine home games despite losing nine of 12 overall. 
Pacers 129, Kings 115 
INDIANAPOLIS -Chuck Person scored 18 of his season­high 41 points in the first pe­riod, and surging Indiana beat Sacramento. 
Reggie Miller added 24 points for Indiana, which has won nine of its last 11 games and a season-high four in a row. Detlef Schrempf contributed 18 points and 15 rebounds. 
Mitch Richmond led the 
Kings, losers of seven straight road games and 24 of 27 as a visitor this season, with 28 points . 
Bullets 1 03, Hawks 102, OT 
ATLANTA -Ledell Eackles matched his career-high with 40 points and Pervis Ellison had 30, including six in overtime, as Washington edged Atlanta. 
The Hawks overcame a 14­point second-half deficit and appeared to have the game won in regulation until Eackles hit a game-tying 3-pointer from the left corner with 4.5 seconds left in regulation to end the Bullets' three-minute scoring drought. 
Warriors 117, Celtics 112 
OAKLAND, Calif. -Tim 
-Hardaway, posting up and pen­etrating almost at will, scored a career-high 43 points as Golden State beat Boston for its fifth consecutive victory. 
Hardaway, who twice before scored 40, made 14 of 25 shots and 13 of 15 free throws as the Warriors equaled their longest winning streak this season. 
Hornets 106, 
Nuggets 104 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -Johnny Newman laid in teammate Muggsy Bogues' airball with 1.1 
seconds left, as Charlotte edged Denver for its fifth victory in seven games. 
After Denver rookie Dikembe Mutombo made two free throws with 20.6 seconds left to tie it at 104, Bogues brought the ball upcourt and passed to rookie Larry Johnson. Johnson, who finished with a career-high 34 points, passed it back and Bogues fired a shot up from the corner. 
Spurs 113, Timberwolves 103 
SAN ANTONIO -David Robinson scored 15 of his sea­son-high 39 points in the fourth quarter San Antonio Spurs pulled away from road-weary Minnesota. 
Terry Cummings added 20 points for San Antonio and Vinnie Johnson matched his season-best with 16. 
Jazz 118, Mavericks 96 
SALT LAKE CITY -Karl Malone scored 23 points, in­cluding Utah's first 11, and the Jazz steadily pulled away from Dallas for a 118-96 victory, the Mavericks 12th straight road loss. 
The Jazz improved its league­best home record to 25-2 with their fifth straight victory. The Mavericks have won just three of their last 24 games.

This could be the year for Irish spring sports 
Most years at Notre Dame, students tPnd to pay attention to the university's athletic teams from August through .January. In other words, the beginning of the school year through the bowl game. 
Though some students begin the basketball season enthusiastically supporting the Irish, they tend to care less and less as the season progresses. 
By the time the spring rolls around, students are thinking more about escaping South Bend for the summer than following Notre Dame sports, with the exception of one event-the Blue-Gold Game, which simply whets the appetite of Irish football fans for the following fall. 
This year, however, the performances of Notre Dame's spring sports teams might force students to notice them. At the beginning of the spring campaign, three Irish teams were nationally ranked. 
The Notre Dame men's tennis team is currently ranked tenth in the country and first in the Midwest Region. The squad is led by All-American David DiLucia, who is ranked second in the country and plays number-one singles. 
lie also teams with junior Chuck Coleman to play number-one doubles for Notre Dame. Though they entered the season unranked nationally, they proved they could play with anyone in the country two weeks ago at the Rolex National Indoor Tennis Championships. The tandem defeated the top team in the nation, Ball State's Dan Kronauge and Paul Kruse, en route to the finals, where they were defeated by Jon Leach and Brian McPhie of USC. 
The team is scheduled to begin play today at the National Intercollegiate Indoor Team Championships in Louisville, where they face fifth-ranked Florida in the first round. 
The women's tennis team began the spring campaign ranked 25th, but slipped out of the poll following a dual meet loss to Illinois. The women are ranked second in the Midwest Region behind Indiana, but could overtake the Hoosiers after a dual match with them on March 7th at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
This could prove to be the most important match of the season because the top-ranked team in the region receives an automatic invitation to the NCAA Tournament. This same format is used for men's tennis. 
The Irish women are led by junior Melissa Harris, who is ranked seVfmth in the country. She holds down the number one singles spot in the lineup. while freshman sensation Laura Schwab plays number two. 
This Saturday, Notre Dame faces 15th-ranked Tennessee at the

Dilucia dropped by Sampras in straight sets

Though David DiLucia was knocked out of the National Pro Indoors last night, his loss will be a big gain for his Irish teammates at the National Team Indoor tournament this afternoon as they play fifth­ranked Florida. 
DiLucia fell to second-seeded Pete Sampras, the 1990 U.S. Open Champion who is currently ranked fifth in the world 6-2, 6-1 a day after upsetting Kevin Curren .in the opening round. Dilucia will join up with his teammates in time to fill the number one singles and doubles spots for the Irish. 
The tournament will bring twenty of the top collegiate tennis teams in the nation to Louisville, Ky. for four days of tournament competiti9n. 
"This tournament reminds me of the sweet sixteen in (college) basketball," said Bayliss. "Any contest you win is going to be a big victory. There are no bad teams here."
