Forum scheduled 
SMC election proposal defeated 
by Pat Payne 

Responding to complaints about the difficulty of forming a ticket in this month's student government election at St. Mary's, the Student Assembly voted last night to hold a forum where potential candidates could find running mates. 
The forum, to be headed by the present officers will also define the roles and duties of the elected members. 
"Student Assembly came up with a constructive solution for those for and against party tickets and I hope it results in more than one ticket running," stated Mary Lu Bilek, student body president. 
A major proposal that would dramat;cally change student gov­ernment elections procedures was defeated. 
The proposal would have com­pletely done away with the idea of a complete slate of candidates, allow­ing students to run individually for a specific office. 
Connie DePyper proposed the change in election procedure, be­cause as she asserted, "I've been trying to get a ticket together all semester and it's been a real problem." 
Other members were in favor of the change because it might aile-

Kreskin 'amazes' Stepan crowd 
by Dave O'Keefe Staff Reporter 

The Amazing Kreskin lived up to his reputation last night in Stepan Center before an enthusiastic crowd of about 1500. 
The famous mentalist, a regular guest on TV talk shows and the host of his own syndicated pro­gran, enthralled the crowd with demonstrations of his . powers of mental telepathy. 
After a short monologue to get acquainted with his audience, Kreskin began his demonstration 
with  a  visual  exhibition  of  his  
powers.  
Taking  a  ring  from  a  female  

volunteer, Kreskin held it in his fingers, covered his hand with a handkerchief, and instructed the girl to place both hands firmly around his wrist to insure that the ring did not go down his sleeve. 
Kreskin then held a key ring in his IDther hand, at arm's length above his head. Without moving, Kreskin made the ring disappear from his hand, only to have it reappear seconds later, locked on the key ring. 
In another "test", Kreskin had a volunteer choose three playing cards from a deck and hide them in his jacket. After each guess by the mentalist, the volunteer was ins­tructed to pull a card from his pocket. Kreskin was right on all three cards. 
Kreskin then gave an extended exhibition of the power he is most ·noted for, "mind reading." After a slow start, Kreskin was finally able to articulate thought!;-·

With the telepathic help of one of the persons who hid his paycheck, Kreskin found it buttoned inside a young boy's shirt, all in a matter of minutes. 
Such genuinely amazing feats, combined with Kreskin's witty and warm stage presence, endeared him to his audience and inspired a standing ovation at the end of the evening's performance.

German Club reactivates at ND 
by John O'Donnell 

The German Club, formally known as the Zeta Phi branch of the Delta Phi Alpha fraternity, has been reactivated at Notre Dame. 
According to Greg Buckley, chairman. the prupose of the club is to get students involved with aspects of German life that cannot be adequately covered in the classroom. 
The club meets once a week at the South Dining Hall to discuss contemporary issues of Germany such as politics, culture, and art. A faculty member serving as modera­tor initiates the discussion, while other members are invited to express their feelings. 
Currently, Buckley is planning a trip to a German restaurant in Chicago The Golden Ox. The club also wants to obtain various Ger­man films from the South Bend Library and show them in Lafor­tune.

In addition. Buckley is expecting two speakers to entertain the club: the Austrian CouncilistGeneral and the German Councilist General from Detroit. 
"The speaker from Austria," Buckley mentions, "will address the freshmen students who plan to study in lnnsbruck next year, but we will also be in attendance. The other speaker from Detroit is a close associate of Dr. Schaum, our current moderator." . 
The club presently consists of ten members. but Buckley expects the group to enlarge to IS or 20 members very shortly. Although membership is open to all, Buckley strongly advises a two year back­ground in German as a pre-requi­site since the entire discussion at meetings is in German. 
The next meeting is planned for Monday at noon, and anyone interested in joining should contact Greg Buckley (ll51).

SMC athletic fund 
passes $1 million 
'* · · 
by Maureen Sajbel Staff Reporter 
The fund for the St. Mary's Athletic Facility passed the $1 million mark in February. 
Director of Foundations and Government Relations, Clyde Remmo, said that this amount showed the "good progress" St. Mary's has been making in reach­ing its goal of $1.8 milion for the center. 
"We've raised over $1 million in the last 15 months. That's signifi­cant for St. Mary's and we can be proud of it," Remmo stated. 
The exact amount raised so far is $1,019,000. January's bad weather will not raise the projected cost of the St. Mary's center. "We are charged only when workers are on the job," Remmo said. The weather, however, will delay the completion of the athletic facility. The projected completion date is now set in early July. 
The cornerstone dedication of the center will still be held on May 
I. 1977, however. The formal dedication will be in September of 1977. 
Remmo hopes to acquire the remainder of the money for the center by May. The funds have been coming from foundations, businesses. and individuals who believe in the "mission of St. Mary's College in educating young women" Remmo explained."These are people who want to invest in the future of the college." 
Grants for the school in general have been at an all-time high this year.. St. Mary's has received $698,000 in grants for 1977, a significant amount in comparison to the 1973 amount of $90,000. 
The grants that St. Mary's receives help to keep tuition costs stable. "Tuitions pay only 82 percent of the costs of the college,'' Remmo said.

Student petition action initiated Jn favor of retaining Danehy 
by Pete Newell 

A petition is currently being circulated among students in sup­port of Chemistry Professor Dan­ehy's bid to stay past the manda­tory retirement age of 65. Accor­ding to Keith O'Connell, organizer of the drive, ''The petitions will probably be collected by Friday and sent to administration officials." 
O'Connell stated he had Danehy for collegiate seminar last semester and again this semester. "When I read the article in The Observer about the forced retirement, I was shocked in view of the type of man he is," he commented. 
He then called people whom he thought would feel the same way. O'Connell described their reaction as "very strong in favor of Dan­ehy." 
O'Connell then formulated the petition and met with Student Body President Mike Gassman and Vice­President Mike Casey Tuesday. O'Connell stated, "I just wanted to see how they felt about the matter. They also were very sympathetic and we reviewed the Faculty Manual to see if there was anything that could be done." 
After the meeting with Gassman and Casey, O'Connell gave copies of the petition to the students whom he had talked to earlier. Sinc:e they represented · almost every dorm on campus, the stu­?ents had taken the responsibility of circulating the petitton in their own dorms. 
O'Connell added. ''I really don't want this to sound like a one man 
who've met Danehy in one situa­
tion or another. They feel as 
strongly about this thing as I do 
and have done a lot of the leg work 
in distributing the petitions." 
O'Connell then presented the 

petition to the Hall President's 
Council. He said, "The reaction 
there was very favorable. Not only 
did they re-affirm the petition 
almost word for word, but the hall 
presidents also offered to help out 
in circulating the petition.'' 
We discussed the petition, en­

dorsed it by a majority and were 
infavor of the University reviewing 
the situation. All the presidents but 
one were willing to help circulate 
the petition in their dorms," accor­
ding to Keefe Montgomery, Stan­
ford Hall President. 
According to O'Connell, the 

Faculty Handbook states there are 
only two instances in which a 
tenured professor can be forced to 
leave. "The first is the case where 
the department is dissolved. The 
second involves dishonesty, intel­
lectual incompetence or neglect of 
duty. None of these apply to 
Danehy," O'Connell stated. 
O'Connell added, "There are · professors here who are over 65 
and actively teaching. Danehy 
wants to continue teaching. Jud­
ging by the students response to 
the petition (over 300 signatures· 
were accumulated less than four 
hours after the petition was circu­lated) we see no rational reason why he is being forced to retire." 
Commenting on the possible effects he noted, "As it stands now, the situation appears vague at best, at its worst it can only be described as either too arbitrary or highly discriminatory.'' 
O'Connell asserted the petitions were not demanding anything, but looking for an explanation. 
Gassman sent a letter yesterday to University Provost Fr. James Burtchaell. In the letter, Gassman said that the University seeks to uphold academic standards, "one view of which is the maintenance of the respect for individuals as persons." 
He also noted, "Dr. Danehy has given much to Notre Dame. His service on the Faculty Senate, although controversial at times, is exemplary of his concern for this University." He added that Dan­ehy's retirement "can only be a loss to Notre Dame." At a meeting of the WSND Editor­ial Board last night. the issue was Thursday, March 3, 1977 the observer

Grade grievance procedure 
by Diane Wilson 
To have a written explanation of 

the grade grievance procedure 
published and to inform student sof 
how to appeal their grades are the 
two goals of the Arts and Letters 
Student Advisory Council (ALSAC) 
committee revising the grievance 
procedure, stated Bill Baker, com­
mittee member. 
According to Baker, a process 

does exist for students to appeal 
their grades. The process is 
understood by teachers and admin­
istrators, but unknown to most 
students, he noted. The students 
are to go to the involved teacher 
and discuss the grievance with 
him. If the student is still 
dissatisfied, he may go to the 
department chairman and discuss 
the problem with him. The 
chairman can disxuss it with the 
teacher if he feels the student has a 
legitimate complaint. Baker em­
phasized that the final decision is 
up to the teacher. No grade can be 

changed without the teacher's ap­
provat, he stated. 
The grievance procedure com­

mittee is presently working to have 
an official draft of the procedure 
published so all students are aware 
of how to appeal grades. 

Other activities ALSAC is pres­ently working on include changing sophomore registration, and the Freshman Spotlight--Meet Your Major program. They have also revived interest in the committee on Acedmic Progress (CAP). CAP had been losing its student-faculty communications for a long time, Baker said and ALSAC has been working to improve those commun­ications.

available to sophomore Arts and 
Letters students who have not yet 
declared their majors. 
This year's program will also be open to all freshmen. Bill Baker, a member of the Arts and Letters Student Advisory Council and an organizer of the event, said, "We approached Dean Hofman about combining Freshman Spotlight and Meet Your Major, but he felt this would not work because a fresh­man's problems are not similar to those of a sophomore. However, two weeks ago the department chairmen said there was no need for two separate open houses." "As a result," Baker explained, ''we were stuck with the logistics problems of finding bigger rooms and more people qualified to discuss the various majors." 
These problems have since been resolved, he noted. Sophomores should receive in­formation packets, with brief des­criptions of each major and a schedule of events. in the mail immediately after midsemester
break. Freshmen will receive similar scheduling information in the Dean's March Newsletter.

SMC Career Center activ~tes job program 
by Honey McHugh 
In order to better inform seniors who are looking for a job, St. Mary's College Career Develop­ment Center (CDC) has started a job vacancy information system, according to CDC Director Karen O'Neil. 
This expansive program, O'Neil said, was initiated as a result of the many vacancy notices sent to the center by a number of large corporations. "We wanted to get the information to the seniors who are actively seeking employment," she added. 
A letter has been compiled and will be distributed to the seniors with the details of the new job 
New job vacancies 
A Job Vacancy Center has also been established in the Career Library that will provide the stu­dents with up to date information on workshops, job openings and current employment in. several of the nation's largest cities. 
Because of an authorizaiton from Kathleen Rice, dean of student affairs, more student aide hours have been allocated to the CDC, resulting in more direct contact work. 
''The system has been set up to make the seniors more aware of the jobs that are open,'' stated Carol Alleshaski, CDC student staff member. 
The CDC is providing its services to all seniors both before and after graduation. All alumnae students

Obiects to Age Discrimination 
Dear Editor: 

I'm sorry to say that I was appalled and ashamed when I read the front-page story in Tuesday's Observer pertaining to Dr. Dan­ehy's forced retirement. I was appalled at the fact that a manda­tory retirement age exists at Notre Dame; ashamed that this university 
which prides itself on civil and 
human rights, feels that a human 
being's usefulness diminishes af­
ter he reaches the arbitrary age of 
65. 

According the Th~ Observer, the Faculty Handbook states that a faculty member "ordinarily re­tires" and loses his tenure when he is 65, not because of any inability to fulfill his teaching duties, but merely because he has reached that magic number of 65. This sounds grossly unfair, and is blatant discrimination on the basis of age. When are people going to be judged by their abilities, and not by the number of (of should I say lack of) gpey hairs on their heads? 
I believe that it is unfair to Dr. 
Danehy and the other faculty 
members, as well as to the students 
who benefit from their teaching, to 
ask them to retire simply because 
of the chronological date of their 
birth. 
"end" was in probable reference to the previous paragraph, emphasiz­ing the need for educators to place a greater priority on personal growth and development of a sense of identity within the student, I feel it appropriate to make a more specific statement about my feel­ings with regard to coed dorms. 
My many contacts with students at Notre Dame leave me with the impression that many of them have rather immature and negative at­titudes toward members of the opposite sex. These negative ster­eotypes and attitudes frequently are a reflection of a lack of real experiential contact on a regular comfortable basis with members of the opposite sex. 
At times, such stereotyped, neg­ative thinking is only fueled by the frustrations of single-sexed dorm living in which students frequently blame their socialization problems on the opposite sex. Many of these prejudicial thoughts are based on emotional factors that cannot be easily reasoned away. 
I feel that the best means to overcome such prejudicial, nega­tive attitudes is for the students to have frequent personal encounters and experiences with the opposite sex. Such contacts would allow them to develop into mature adults who feel comfortable relating to members of the opposite sex. 
I can think of no better means to accomplish this goal than having students living in close proximity where their interpersonal contacts are the rule rather than the exception. Notre Dame has im­proved the opportunity to grow by

Dear Editor: 
There is a bemusing ambiguity . in the letter of February 23 from 
AAUP President, James Robinson, 
to the faculty concerning collective 
bargaining. 
According to the second para­
graph, the faculty is asked to join 
an effort ''to bring the collective 
bargaining issue to the election 
stage." In the fifth paragraph, we 
are told that "signing the card is, 
in effect, a vote to hold an 
election." 
But a careful reading of the care 
received with the letter indicates 
that the matter is not quite that 
simple. For a signer is in fact not 
merely "voting to hold an election" 
nor taking a step "to bring the 
collective bargaining issues to the 
election stage." He is also and 
simultaneously doing something 
entirely different--he is registering 
a preference to have one particular 
agent (AAUP, of course!) desig­
nated as bargaining agent. 
Two separate issues--(i) is there 
to be collective bargaining at Notre 
Dame; and (ii) if there is to be 
collective bargaining, is the AAUP

To My Parents 

iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii '!Iary mc corm ick 
I have just returned from saying good-bye to my parents. Another Junior Patents Weekend has ert'rled. This event, however, was different from the previous 24 Junior Parents Weekends; because I am a junior; because my parents were here; because we spent the weekend together along with about 599 fellow juniors and their par­ents. The past two and a half days were too memorable to simply cross them off the calendar like any other weekend at N.D. 
It is appropriate that we host our parents during our junior year. As freshmen, we are new to Notre Dame and still searching for the "specialness" of the place. In our sophomore year, we are familiar with the people and the sur­roundings and we can sense the "specialness"; however, some un­certainty still remains. 
As juniors, we have discovered the "specialness" and have con­sciously established ourselvs in the midst of it. We are presently at the height of our hopefulness. uring our senior year, some of the glitter of hope will have worn off for reasons of facing graduation and our futures. 
I have always been highly proud of my parents and my family. Often, I have wished my friends here could meet my Mom and Dad. I've experienced this desire parti­cularly at times when I was feeling left out, insecure, unsure about 
N.D. It was as if I wanted to say to everyone, including myself, "Look! You may not know me or like me but you should meet my parents! They are really terrific people. If you could only talk with them. you'd discover that I'm O.K., too!" 
You see, I wanted to introduce my parents for the wrong reasons. 
After two and a half years at Notre Dame, my parents finally came. And I found the introductions to be reversed. It was not, "Friends, meet my parents." It was instead, "Parents, me,~t my frienr'-" 
tv uc the bargaining agent--seem somehow to have been conflated into one. The options are con­strained so that one is not allowed to opt for collective bargaining without being finessed into voting for AAUP. And it's not difficult to see in this intermixing of what ought to be two separate issues the cloven hoof of a self-serving bu­reaucracy! -­
. Eggheads of the faculty, unite! Do not allow an extraneous third party to interject itself into the process of university governance. Vote Nyet! Nyet! Nyet! against the iniquitous proposal to introduce collective bargaining.

Dear Editor: 
We feel compelled to write in reference to the misleading chari­cature printed in the Observer 2/23177 concerning the Texas na­tural gas producer. It is '!lisleading due to the fact that the energy problem is not a regional short run problem but rather a long run 

D-uring Saturday night's speeches both Fr. hesburgh and pat Flynn expressed the opinion that Junior Parents Weekend gives us an opportunity to tell our mothers and fathers that we love them; that we are proud to be their children. Beyond this, however, the event allows us to tell one another, through our parents, that we also love Notre Dame and we are proud to be a part of it; we are, in effect, proud of each other. for myself, the realization of these two prides working together to give me daily support has added a whole new dimension to life here. 
So freshmen and sophomores, if at all possible, have you parents attend your Junior Parents Week­end. If they can't come, at least attend the activities with a friend because there was enough pride radiating in Stepan Center on Saturday night to share with the entire student body. Seniors, remember when your parents came and possibly renew the proud spirit which I'm certain you experienced last year. 
Despite the numerous thank-­yous over the weekend, I would again like to express my gratitude and appreciation to Nanette Bufalino, Patrick Flynn and all the other members of the J.P.W. committed who made this past weekend a reality. 
Junior Parents Weenend is prob­~ably the most enriching and educa­tional event of one's four years at Notre Dame. It is obvious from what I've already stated why the event is enriching. But what's educational about it? 
In his speech, Fr. Hesburgh said Notre Dame's_ primary goal is to teach its students to be somebody rather than to just do something. Last weekend I learned if I can be a part of such a fine class of 
. individuals, I already am some­body. Seeing my parents as peopl who I greatly admire and respect gave me a clearer view of who I want to be. 
national problem 

There. are several points which have been totally ignored in refer­ence to the energy crisis. Market distortions have been ignored on the consumption side. There seems to be an inherent characteris tic of American consumers to waste whatever has been produced. Americans expect greater quantitie of goods at fixed prices . 
Price differentials between the gas sold interstate and gas pro­duced and sold within a state induces a greater quantity of gas sold to higher priced areas and is an incentive to hold gas from the lower priced areas. This differen­
tial  is  the  result  of  federal  
regulation.  
There  are  engineering  con­ 

straints as well in the depleting of a natural gas reserve. As more wells are drilled in the existing reserves an increased less of pressure will occur. Therefore the amount of gas recoverable will decline. Until this country taps all available sources such as those off the east coast it will continue to experience energy problems. J B

Neither a spHt or two victories wiii help the lnsh's stan~mgs m the WCHA but the series means more than that. The opemng matches against' Wisconsin in Dane County Coliseum did nothi~g to yrove. one team better than the other. The Irish kicked off the opemng mght w1t~ a 4-1 victory, Clark Hamilton scoring a hat trick an~ Lenny Moher makmg the difference in the net with 47 saves, 19 of them m the final stanza. The next night the Badgers answered to the tune of a 4-3 victory • but the Irish stiiileft fo~ home the first team not to have been swept when visiting the 
Badgers. . Now, the Cardinal and White invade the ACC as part of the biggest sports weekend of the year. The games have been sold out for over a month. The stout-hearted fans of the Irish are circulating their "Meet me in Detroit" buttons. Indeed, the cost of losing this weekend wiii be paid not in standings, but in pride. Certainly, it is a more than crucial series, with the possibility of facing Wisconsin again in both the WCHA playoffs and in the NCAAs. For eight seniors; the series means even more; their last regular sea~on home match-up. Upon first inspection of the list, one can't help wondermg 
will suffer the loss of All-America) and captain Jack Brownschidle, league-leading scorer and captain Brian "Dukie" Walsh, and Allen Karsnia, perhaps the most underrated of all the members of this year's squad. For many ofthese men, a future in the pros is eminent, yet I am sure that at this time, they are more concerned with ending their college careers on a blissful note. However, Wisconsin stares out ominously from the shadows, a silent reminder that if the Irish can't defeat Wisconsin this weekend at least once, the chances are strong they won't advance very far in the playoffs. 
For the Irish, it is a time to get mentally alert --to prepare for some hard-hitting hockey. Wisconsin is one of the toughest teams in the entire · nation, not just the WCHA, and wiii give Notre Dame a run for their 
money this weekend. Led by sophomore goaltending sensation Mike Dibble, and Steve Alley and John Taft who last year were with the U.S. Olympic Team, the Badgers boast a 28-7 record this year. 
The Irish have cooled off considerably the last two weekends, playing uninspired hockey at a 1-2-1 clip. However, if any team can fire up the Irish it's undoubtedly Wisconsin: a team they tried to catch all year, and neve~ did. Now they have the chance to prove who's really the better 
hockey team. Whatever the outcome, you can be sure it will set the tone for the playoffs, whether they play good or bad.

However, Remi Baylot of Notre 
Dame captured the overall combin­
ed champion honors boasting three 
first place finishes and one second 
place in the four event competition 
(slalom, special slalom, giant slal­
om and downhill). Baylot's tech­

.Which leaves the typical Irish sports fan with little alternative--you might as well sleep out in the ACC over the weekend, because its nearly non-stop action starting Friday night at 7:30. And, remember seniors that w~en you leave the ACC Saturday night, you may have seen the end of varsity sports at ND as an undergrad (especially if that Florida sun b.ackons you there early). No more fight song. No more sit-o':l·the-lead-in-the-second-half football games. No more Jack Lloyd funmes on the PA system (maybe someday we'll return and he'll know "':hat a real slam-dunk is). No _more Digger the cheerleader. If you can't hit the hockey pl~yo~s. then It all ends this weekend in the span of 27 hours. The curtam will have fallen on the last varsity event for the last clas.s to see National Championship brought to the cornfields of Northern Indiana.

Big weekend 
:;;=====================================================;===;=;=;=;=;=;=;=;=;=====:=;=;=;=;=;=;=;=;=;=;High and inside 
Within the short time span of twenty-seven hours this weekend, the Notre Dame Athletic department will be faced with its most rigorous challenge since January 1974, perhaps its most rigorous challenge ever. For now as then, our major varsity teams will be compf'ting against the nation's #1 clubs. Just as the Irish gridders faced Alabama for the National Championship, just as the Irish cagers faced #1, unbeaten, 88-games-in-a-row UCLA, and just as the Irish icers faced #1 ranked Michigan Tech in that January three years ago, so this weekend will the ACC be the site of the basketball season's climactic battle with the #1 San Francisco Dons and the regular hockey season's finale series with top-rated Wisconsin. It's almost (but not quite) enough to put visions of Florida and warmth out of the heads of cold-weary Doiners. 
The hockey contests will be relatively meaningless with regard to the WCHA final standings. Wisconsin has secured first place and home playoff advantage for the entire playoff series, while the Irish have assured themselves of at least their second best WCHA regular season ever. 
But the unimportance of the series ends there. This may be a preview ofthe WCHA championship series to be played 12 days later. Both teams are loaded with talent. They are tied for best team defense, and both have dominated competition in the second half of the season. While the Irish have recently sputtered slightly against Denver and Michigan Tech, there is no reason to suppose that they won't regain top form as a tune-up for the playoffs. Besides, the Badgers have been arch-rivals since the 1972-73 season when Wisconsin knocked the Irish out of the playoffs in a fierce series at the ACC. 
This also will be the final regular season games for several puckster seniors. From Clark Hamilton and Dukie Walsh to Jack Brownschidle and Paul Clarke, the seniors will be working their icy magic for the last time before a regular .weekend crowd. 
Meanwhile, a few hundred feet to the south on the hardcourt the hoopsters of Digger Phelps face their toughest assignment of the season. Forget Maryland, UCLA, Indiana. Please forget Kentucky and Marquette. This one will show what the Irish of early March can really do as they head into the NCAAs. 
Not since January 19, 1974 has a basketball game at the ACC been of equal interest. The Dons, like the Bruins of '74, are undefeated and ranked at the top of the weekly polls. USF senses a final goose-egg in the "L" column as they head for the playoffs. The Irish sense upset. 
And, as in the case of the hockey team, this will mark the end of the line for Irish players Billy Paterno, Toby Knight and Dave Kuzmicz on the home court. These seniors played on a 24-2 regular season team their freshman year and would like nothing better than to go out in style with a 16-1 final home record. .O:·.t ·[continued on page 11] coach and athletic director at Brigham Young University. He mentioned the specific criteria a team must meet in order to qualify for a playoff bid. 
"The 21 conference champions qualify automatically which leaves 11 open betths," Watts said. "These positions, which we refer to as 'at large berths' are filled by independants and conference run­ners-up on the basis of their seasonal performances as deter­mined by their won-loss record." 
However, a good won-loss record is not the single criterion for selection as demonstrated in 1976 when North Carolina-Charlotte fin­ished their season with only three losses yet were overlooked by the selection committee. Watts explains: 
"Teams with good won-loss re­cords must meet the second criteria of playing a competitive schedule. A team that plays quality competi­tion, say five or six teams that are nationally ranked, could very will get a bid before a team that plays a less-competitive schedule. The cal­ibre of a team's schedule is very important to the final evaluation." 
Cawood, too, stressed the im­portance of a demanding schedule. "Teams that face rigorous schedu­les and end up with a good record are highly considered,'' he said. "Who a school plays is a big factor." 
As Watts pointed out, confer­ence champions are automatically granted a berth in the NCAA's playoffs. A post-season tournament to determine what team will repre­sent its conference in the playoffs was, until last year, employed exclusively by the Atlantic Coast Conference. However, many con­ferences, the Big Eight, Metro Seven, and Southern to name a few, have followed the ACC's example and are now holding post­season tournaments. North Caroli­na State Coach Norm Sloan, whose Atlantic Coast Conference team won the NCAA championship in 1974 comments on these post-sea­son tournaments as a method of selecting conference representa­tives to the playoffs. 
"I love it," Sloan exclaimed, "I think it's great. It reflects the strengths of the teams at the end of the season which is when it counts. Perhaps you've got a .young team and you don't start out very well at the beginning of the season, or maybe you've got a team that comes on really strong at the end of the season. In cases like these, a tournamnet,like the one we've got, is .a great determiner of who should represent a conference in the a NCAA playoffs.'' 
Sloan pointed out alternatives for determining "at large" partici­pants in the NCAA playoffs. "Maybe some sort of independant tournament could be held with the top independants, like Notre Dame and Marquette competing for NCAA playoff berths," the North Carolina State mentor suggested. ''Another possibility would be to take a combination of the Associat­ed Press and the United Press International polls to determine the top independants. That way you would get the opinion of coaches and the sports media." 
Commenting on the situation, Notre Dame Coach Digger Phelps voiced opposition to Sloan's sug­gestion of an independant tourna­ment. 
"I can't see any logic in staging a tournament to decide who goes to a tournament," Phelps pointed out. "What would be the purpose of playing out your schedule? A coac8 has to keep his team prepared for 28 games. It wouldn't be fair to blow it all in one game." 
"Besides," continued Phelps," 
playing in a tournament for inde­
pendants would be similar to 
playing in a conference, and I see 
disadvantages to that sort of situa­
tion. A good example of how a 
conference affiliation canhurtyou is 
Alabama of the Southeastern Con­
ference who could possibly be 
excluded from the .NCAA playoffs· because of conference restric­tions." · 
Phelps does offer a suggestion. "I think that the best 32 teams in the country should _go to the playoffs," the Irish mentor stated flatly. "After all, if you are trying to determine the one best team in the country, a good team should not be excluded because they lost their conference tournament. Look at the 32 teams with the best overall season records." 
The National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament dates back to 1939 when the University of Oregon walked away with the prize. The tournament originally consisted of 16 teams until the mid-1960's when the NCAA increased the field to 25. The figure remained at 25 until last year when the NCAA committee increased it to the present 32-team roster. 
These 32 teams·are divided into four regions: the East, West, Medeast and Midwest, with eight teams comprising each region. 
Cawood commented on the pro­cedure the committee follows in determining what team goes to wat region. "Conference champions are placed in their respective regions," he pointed out. "As far as independants, they are placed wherever a position is available. If an independant has an exceptional record, as did Marquette in 1976, the committee will traditionally try to place them in their own region. However, with independants there is simply no guarantee; it's largely a matter of where there's room." 

From the regional contests, four teams emerge. This "final four" as they are referred to travel to a' designated spot, this year the Omni in Atlanta, Ga., where the NCAA championship will be decided. 
For college coaches and players all over the country an NCAA championship would be a dream come true. This Sunday, March 6, the NCAA committee will formally invite 32 teams to participate in this year's playoffs, and give them a chance to see their dream come true. 
Ted Robinson On the road 

HOUGHTON, Mich. -Everyone should go to Houghton at least once. 
It's a lot of fun trying to get there, especially if you've got a lack of 
patience. Well, this is one trip to Houghton experienced by the Notre 
Dame hockey team last weekend. And you think it's fun to be an 
athlete. 

WEDNESDAY-Leave ACC by bus at 4 p.m. for O'Hare Airport in 
Chicago. South Bend temperature is now SO. Estimated time of 
arrival in Houghton is 10:25. Little did we know then what would 
happen. 

5:30p.m. -Arrive O'Hare only to find that a freezing rainstorm has 
struck everything north of Milwaukee. Nobody knows when we will 
leave, if we will leave. A petition to return to South Bend fails, so 
some of the traveling party kills time in the Cafe Mexicana. On his 
birthday, Greg Meredith would like to celebrate, but being a dedicated 
team member, abstains. 

8 p.m. -North Central Airlines loads the team on a plane bound for 
Milwaukee, 18 minutes away. Upon landing, we learn that all points 
north are closed, so the team must spend the night in Milwaukee. 
Unfortunately, the airport has only one limousine running to the 
hotel, and that is out of commission. Station wagons are 
commandeered to transport about 60 people, but only 2 show up. 
Seven trips later, we finally make it. 

10:30 p.m. -Granted Milwaukee is better than Houghton, yet there were places I would rather be. After eating, manager Joe Carey and myself play pool with South Bend Tribune writer Jim Moriarity. That was a big mistake. Three minutes later, I was down a few beers, and we descended to El Robbo's disco. That was a bigger mistake. Between the Pro Bowlers Tour and geriatric patients dancing to "Get Down Tonight," I had had enough. When Lefty Smith takes one look and leaves, I really knew it was the wrong place. 1 a.m. -Joe Carey falls asleep without his glasses, after"Columbo" ends. Obviously, the fun is over, so sleep beckons. THURSDAY 7 a.m. -Team departs for Milwaukee airport, optimistic of reaching Houghton. 7:30a.m.-Team arrives at Milwaukee airport to learn that Houghton is still closed. But, they may get us to Green Bay. With that cheery news in my mind, I proceed to check out the weather in New York and Miami. I felt bad when I read of tornado alerts in Florida. Trainer John Whitmer felt worse when he couldn't find out the weather in Las 
Vegas· As for Houghton, it didn't compute. 10 a.m.-We take off for Green Bay. Twenty minutes later, we land in Green Bay. We learn that we will be bussed the remaining 200 miles to Houghton. Rumors of a Friday-Sunday series abound. That makes everyone jump for joy. NOON -The busses leave for Houghton, with an intermediate stop in Iron Mountain. We still haven't eaten since 7, and we still know if the team will play tonight. Also, Green Bay is a beautiful town. 2:30p.m. -We stop in the Iron Mountain airport, which is a classic. It consists of one North Central desk, two lavatories, and seven vending machines. Those vending machines have never seen better days. Twelve hockey players eat a pre-game meal of Chili-Mac, vegetable beef soup, and the special of dumplings in beef gravy ordered up by Len Moher. You've never seen better vending ma~hine players in your life. 3 p.m. -Stomachs satisfied, the team departs for the final run to Houghton. The strains of the trip start to show when Whitmer dozes with a cigar in his mouth, and Moher vocalizes the Billboard Top 40 from 1963. Don and Terry Fairholm are quite amused, and begin telling stories of their childhoods in Quebec. Not one to be upstaged, Lennox performs his aine accent. Next time you see him ask him how to get to Woonsocket. 5 p.m. The insanity is tempered by the appearance of a sign proclaiming the town limit of Houghton. "Houghton is a nice town except during rush hour," exclaimed one of the passengers. I told him to try the VanWyck or Belt Parkway sometime about 5:15 on a Thursday afternoon in January. 5:15p.m. -Check into hotel. Half of the rooms have no showers or heat. After that trip, it was no surprise. 7 p.m.-Leave hotel for rink. Next to the rink is a cozy black building which houses the deceased of Houghton during wintertime. What a way to prepare for ahockey game. 9 p.m. -Opening face-off. 
11:30 p.m. -Final buzzer sounds. Scoreboard says Notre Dame 6, Mich. Tech 4. The hell with steak and baked potato, .the pre-game meal should obviously be Chili-Mac and dumplings in beef gravy.
