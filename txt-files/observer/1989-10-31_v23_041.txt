$20K in hall matching funds suspended 
By MONICA YANT 
News Writer 
Matching funds for residence halls have been suspended in­definitely as a result of damage caused by the Oct. 19 snowball light, Father David Tyson said in a letter to hall presidents. 
The matching funds account for over $20,000, which is al­lotted to the residence halls for capital improvements. 
"I cannot see any point in al­locating funds for hall life im­provement when those funds should be used to defray the cost of repairs to the halls," Tyson said in the letter, which was delivered to hall presi­dents' rooms during mid­semester break. 
The Office of Student Affairs refused to comment. 
Six stained glass chapel win­dows, as well as many dorm windows. were damaged during the snowball light. 
Several dorms had gained approval for funding before the suspension, and purchases were made with the assumption that two-thirds of the money would be matched by the Uni­versity, said Megan Hanley, Hall Presidents' Council co­chairperson. 
Trisha Power of Pasquerilla West and Christina Quiong of Siegfried said their halls bought pianos for their chapels with the understanding that the University would grant $700 and $1100, respectively, for the pianos. 
Flanner, Dillon, and Alumni halls also purchased items with matching funds in mind. 
"It's a rather silly measure to revoke the funds that the halls have already spent with the un­derstanding that they would get a two-thirds reimbursement," said Jim Schilder, student gov­ernment commissioner for campus improvements and se­curity. 
"Something needs to be done to make students aware that (vandalism) can't happen again," Student Body President Matt Breslin said, "but if this many dorms have spent the money, it may have a devastat­ing effect." 
Tyson stated in the letter that "Residence Life personnel met with student leaders to solicit their assistance. Apparently, the efforts of these people were insufficient to stem what is ap­proaching a riot." 
This meeting, according to Hanley, was called at 4 p.m. on Oct. 19, the day of the first snowfall on campus. The Office of Student Affairs asked Han­ley, HPC Co-Chairperson Diane

NO student falls victim to hit and run 
By KELLEY TUTHILL 
Assistant News Editor 
A Notre Dame graduate stu­dent was critically injured in a hit and run accident on Notre Dame Avenue. 
The accident occurred on Friday, Oct. 20 at 9:30 p.m., according to Chuck Hurley, as­sistant director of Security. 
Zheng-de Wang is presently listed in critical condition in the intensive care unit at St. Joseph's Medical Center, said a spokesperson from the center. 
Hurley said that a person in a motor vehicle told the officer at the Main Gate that there was a man lying in the road. He said that it was raining fairly hard that evening and the visibility was poor. 
When Hurley approached Wang a nurse was attending to the victim. Hurley said he called for an ambulance and Wang was taken to St. Joseph's Medi­cal Center. 
Security is pursuing leads in this case, but Hurley said that no further information could be released at this time. 
Arthur Grubert, director of International Student Affairs, said that Wang's parents are

Assistant News Editor 
Diane Toohey, a Notre Dame senior. was injured while on the Senior Class trip to Cancun, Mexico. 
According to the Office of Public Relations and Informa­tion. Toohey was injured at the Hotel Oasis at about 4 p.m. on Thursday. Oct. 26. 
She fell while trying to tra­verse from one room balcony to another. Public Relations said that she fell five stories onto concrete. 
Toohey was taken to La Clin­ica in Cancun and suffered cuts to the head, a possible concus­sion, and kn1'P and elbow in­ju!'ies, according to Public Rela.tions. 
Toohey was part of a group of over 70 Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students spending break in Cancun under the su­pervision of two Saint Mary's staff members, including Mary Ellen Smith, director of student

Candy X-rays 'ineffective' ~~ly measure 
Associated Press 
Most of the nation's hospi­tals have pulled the plug on offers to X-ray Halloween goodies, saying the. once popular way to detect pins and needles is too costly and is ineffective in preventing poisoning. 
"It costs a fortune," said Rose Ann Soloway, of the Na­tional Capital Poison Center at Georgetown University Hospi· tal in Washington, D.C. 
"Someone calculated the 
cost in health care dollars, 
and it's an enormous amount 
of money nationwide," Ms. 
Soloway said. "It's money 
that'.s probably not well spent. 
"If candy is going to be tam­pered with, there's any num­ber of ways of doing it," she said. "X-rays can only detect foreign objects, especially

"We were concerned that parents who brought candy in to the emergency room to have it X-rayed and were told that there was nothing in it were led to believe it was safe," said Janet Ferguson, Cabell Huntington Hospital the end of the week. 
Student Body President Matt Breslin said he spoke to Toohey on Sunday. "She sounded real good," he said. "She knows she's very. fortunate." 
Breslin said she flew home Saturday with her mother and spent the night in a hospital in Erie. Toohey left the hospital on Sunday. 
Sh~ suffered a concussion, cuts and abrasitms on her body and her knee was cut up, stated Breslin. 
"She said she feels like she has the flu," said Breslin. He added that she has no broken bones.

Black actor seeks to change stereotypes 

By LAUREL VITALE 
News Writer 
Giancarlo Esposito, black broadway and film actor in movies such as "Do the Right Thing," "School Daze," and "Taps," spoke to Saint Mary's and Notre Dame students about his life and the issue of racism in films, television and theater Monday. 
Esposito expressed his wish for the development of a new culture when "people will real­ize that being different from what you are is not bad." He discussed the effect of films which promote racial stereo­types and shared his decision not to accept roles in the future which include violent minority behavior. 
"I don't want to perpetuate the stereotypical black drug dealer because young black people take it seriously and that is not healthy,"· said Es­posito. "Television violence is not the real world." 
Esposito shared with his au­dience many anecdotes and lessons he has learned in his 26 years of experience in show­business. He believes in love as the "universal language," and expressed the idea of self -ap­preciation and self-love. 
"In a country where being a minority is not easy, the only way to get accepted is to love yourself." 
Esposito believes that it will take independent film makers

Ozone layer needs to be protected too 
Substance abuse. 

We hear a lot about the abuse of alcohol and other drugs, but we don't trear enough about a substance abuse we are all guilty of: chlorofluo­rocarbons (CFC's). Janice O'Leary 
Everyone has heard 

News Copy Editor 
the ozone layer is being depleted, but goes in one ear and out the other. Maybe no one realizes how bad the problem is. Or maybe everyone thinks if they ignore it it will go away, or that someone else will take care of it. 
It was discovered in the mid-'70s that the widely used CFC's would someday erode the upper atmospheric ozone, but-"someday" came a little sooner than predicted. The thinning of the ozone layer was expected to begin over the South Pole, but it hasn't stopped there. The layer has not just thinned -there is a large hole in the ozone that is widening quickly toward South America, Australia and New Zealand. In 1984, this hole was larger than the United States and taller than -Mt. Everest, and these places are already feeling the effects of the hole. So are we. 
I live in New York and I can remember we always had snow at Christmas and some­times even at Easter. Not anymore. In January, one of the coldest months of the year, I couldn't even find enough snow in the Catskills to have a snowball fight. 
Some effects (or symptoms) of global warning and ozone depletion are terrible natural disasters. We have had several of these recently: Hurricane Hugo, which swept the Southeast, and the earthquake that rocked Oakland County in California. 
We have to find alternatives to CFC's. But 
what do we use that contains these deadly 
CFC's? Air-conditioning, aerosol sprays, 
solvents, Styrofoam, insulation and 
refrigerators all contain them. Because 
CFC's are cheap and easy to make they have 
become very wide-spread. 

This problem is worldwide, and it cannot 
be solved by a few government officials. We 
all need to be aware of it and stop it now. 
Instead of buying aerosol hairspray, we can 
just as easily buy pump sprays; we can tone 
down the air-conditioning; we can stop pur­
chasing Styrofoam cups. Every time you 
break that little tab off the Big Mac con­
tainer at McDonald's you are contributing 
to the breakdown of our ozone layer. 
Research has been done and still is under 
weigh to discover methods of preventing 
CFC's from escaping into the atmosphere. 
Scientists are trying to develop recovery 
systems to recycle CFC's into their original 
source. This is a start, but alone it is not 
enough. If the world's nations and their 
people continue their apathetic attitudes 
any research will be almost worthless. 
Everyone must become aware and begin to 
care about the air they and their children 
have to breathe. This awareness and con­
cern must begin with us right now.

4,000 hold rally for quake victims 
Bette Midler wins lawsuit 
Associated Press 
OAKLAND, Calif. -There was no parade for baseball's world champions on Monday, just a muted rally in whieh the Oakland Athletics' triumph mingled with memories of this city's recent tragedy. 
More than 4,000 fans of the A's, who completed a four­game sweep of the San Fran­cisco Gial}ts on Saturday, joined in the rally in Jack Lon­don Squarn. It bngan with mu­sie and a flag procession. A moment of silence plaimed for victims of the recent earthquake was forgotten in the excitement. 
"The longer you have to wait for something, the more it means to you," said A's Man­ager Tony La Hussa. "Nobody likes the reason we had to wait so long to be the world cham­pions, but I know it means a great deal to all of us." 
Eaeh of the players, standing in front of a banner that read, "Oakland's World Serious," spoke briefly to the crowd. 
A few minutes earlier, work­ers clearing battered vehicles from a crumpled section of In­terstate 880 removed the car in whieh the last survivor of the freeway's collapse, longshore­man Buck llelm, was trapped for four days. 
Helm remained in serious condition but continued to show slow improvement, said a spokeswoman for llighland Hospital. Thirty-nine people died in the freeway eollapse. 
There had been plans for a more traditional parade and eeremony at City Hall if the A's 
won the World Series. But 
those plans were canceled after 
the 7.1 magnitude quake struck 
Oet. 17, a half-hour before the 
originally scheduled third game 
at Candlestick Park. 
The game was postponed un­

til 10 days later, and the A's 
quickly ended the Series by 
winning the third and fourth 
games at Candlestick. 
Many of the buildings along 

the planned parade route re­
main roped off, still too dan. 
gerous to enter, and the ornate 
City Hall is so badly damaged it 
may never reopen. 
The rally, though small and tame compared with the parade after the San Francisco 49ers' Super Bowl victory last Jan­uary, signaled another step to­ward recovery by the Bay area. 
"People now are trying to find hope," said the Rev. Cecil Williams before his sermon Sunday at Glide Memorial Chureh in San Francisco. "Some people don't want to face the trauma, they don't want to face the pain. I'm hop­ing this will be a learning expe­rience. This is a tremendous opportunity for the city to be what's never been before, a new Jerusalem, a city that is more loving and equal and kind." 
Bay area companies, hoping to bring baek nervous tourists and conventioners, are mount­ing an advertising campaign to show the world that San Fran­cisco and Oakland still stand. 
"We've had our natural dis­aster, we don't want an eco­nomic disaster," said Shelby Allen, vice president for mar­keting for the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bu­
reau, which is kicking off its 
pitch Thursday. 
Hyatt, which owns 1 0 hotels 

in the Bay area, is launching a 
similar campaign in six news­
papers across the country 
starting Tuesday. 
"We're doing a lot because the world thinks we've tumbled into the bay. We're trying to project the image that the city is not in rubble," said Charles McElroy, general manager of the Hyatt-Regency in San Fran­cisco. 
In Oakland, a coalition of business groups called Cele­brate Oakland hired three ad agencies to put together a campaign to show that the city is returning to normal. The Port of Oakland also is running ads headlined "Oakland Can Take It" in trade magazines. "We've taken some licks, but we're on our way back," the ad says. 
Recovery efforts also are con­tinuing strong with donations from around the country. 
A big truck rig carrying dis­aster relief supplies donated by the people of Evansville, Ind., was unloaded in Los Gatos for quake victims in that city, the Santa Cruz Mountains and Watsonville. 
The American Society of Plas­tic and Reconstructive Sur­geons, holding its annual meet­ing in San Francisco, asked each of the 2,000 attending doctors to donate $100 to help quake victims. 
Traffic remains a major problem that may be getting worse, with 1-880 partly closed and the San Francisco-Oaklanrl Bay Bridge still closed .

against advertising agency 
Associated Press 

LOS ANGELES Entertainer Bette Midler should get $400,000 from an advertising agency that imitated the Grammy­winning singer's voice in a TV commercial, a federal jury ruled Monday. 
The U.S. District Court jury, which began deliberating Friday, decided that Young & Ru­bicam violated Miss Midler's rights by imitating her voice. 
In a statement given re­porters, the ageney ealled the award "unfortunate but bearable." 
Miss Midler testified, "I don't do commercials," and said one of her former baekup singers was hired to perform the song "Do You Wanna Dance?" for a 1986 Mercury Sable car commercial after she

turned down a request from Ford Motor Co. 
Miss Midler also filed a $10 million lawsuit against Ford, but U.S. District Judge Wallace Tashima ruled Thursday there was insufficient evidence to proeeed against the ear eompany. 
Miss Midler's attorney, Peter Laird, said he hoped "national advertisers and advertising agencies will think twice in the future before they disregard the rights of artists." 
Laird told the jury his client never agreed to sing in the commercial, and she never would have. The agency "took what they couldn't buy from Midler," he said. 
"She had the right to say 
no.  That right  was  taken  
away  from  her,"  Laird  
said.

KGB protestors clubbed by police 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -Helmeted riot police wielding truncheons re­peatedly charged and clubbed demonstrators Monday night after a candlelight vigil outside KGB headquarters in memory of Stalin's victims. Scores of protesters were knocked to the ground, beaten and dragged into police buses. 
About 40 people were de­tained, the official Tass news agency said, in what was the harshest crackdown on protesters in Moscow in more than 1 1/2 years. Tass said the protesters were "trying to cre­ate as much disruption as pos­sible, to display anti-Soviet posters and shout anti-Soviet slogans." 
The clashes took place on some of central Moscow's busi­est streets and were especially jarring because of the more permissive political climate in­stituted under President· Mikhail Gorbachev's wide­ranging reforms. 
About 1,000 Soviets con­verged on KGB headquarters at Dzerzhinsky Square after dusk to mark the unofficial "Day of the Political Prisoner" and mourn the millions who were wrongly imprisoned or killed under Josef Stalin. 
The hour-long protest, in which two rows of people hold­ing flickering candles lined up on three sides of the building, proceeded peacefully. It had been organized by the Memorial Society, which seeks to com­memorate those who suffered unjustly under Stalin, and the Democratic Union, a self-styled opposition to the Communist Party. 
At the end of the demonstra­tion, a splinter group of about 500 people, mostly young men, marched off in the direction of Pushkin Square, a favorite ral­lying site for human rights ac­tivists. 
Chanting, "Shame on the KGB!" and "The KGB is the en­emy of the people!" the group was confronted without warn­ing by riot police two blocks from Pushkin Square as they passed out leaflets to home­bound commuters. 
The white-helmeted police, armed with long black rubber truncheons, formed a line, then waded into the protesters, clubbing at least four of their leaders to the ground, then dragging them into nearby buses for detention. 
The demonstrators retreated, then formed again and headed to Gorky Street, the main thor­oughfare leading to Pushkin Square. The riot police and other uniformed officers sealed off the square and split the protesters into two groups. 
On Gorky Street, riot police again charged the demonstra­tors, taking about six into cus-

tody. As the protesters were dragged to the buses, specta­tors shouted: "Shame! Shame!" Several passers-by spat at a police car. 
Another group of demonstra­tors, gathered on the southeast side of Pushkin Square, was also repeatedly charged by riot police, who ignored the dozens of television camera teams and foreign reporters who flocked there. 
Police formed a flying wedge to charge young people gath­ered under a Gorky Street archway, and dozens were seized bodily and dragged away to the waiting buses. 
It was the roughest treatment of an unsanctioned demonstra­tion in Moscow since December 1987, when about 200 burly men in civilian clothes roughed up Jews who staged a protest demanding the right to emi­grate on the eve of Gorbachev's departure for his Washington summit with Ronald Reagan. 
The 6 p.m. protest outside KGB headquarters began qui­etly as dozens of regular uni­formed police watched the demonstration and directed traffic around Dzerzhinsky Square. At the center of the squarP is a statue of Felix Dz­erzhinsky, founder of the Soviet secret policP. 
The demonstrators held can­dles and signs saying, "Shame on the KGB Executioners" and "Down with the KGB." 
Indian leader finds hostility in elections 
Associated Press 
NEW DELHI, India -The main opposition leader, barely able to file in time Monday be­cause of a bomb threat and other delays, accused the gov­erning party of "masterminding a plot" to keep him out of next month's elec­tions. 
Analysts say the parliamen­tary elections Nov. 22, 24 and 26 may be the closest since In­dia gained independence from Britain 42 years ago. 
Vishwanath Pratap Singh, leader of the Janata Dal party, filed his nomination papers in the Fatehpur district barely half an hour before the deadline on a day filled with delay and diversion. 
He had been airborne 28 minutes when his plane, part of the government-run Vayudoot Airlines fleet, returned to New Delhi because of a bomb threat. 
Singh conducted a protest at the airport, United News of In­dia reported. After a three­hour delay, in which no bomb was found but an unspecified technical problem was re­ported, the plane again took off for Kanpur, the nearest airport to Fatehpur. 
After that, Singh had to drive two hours to reach Fatehpur in time, an aide in New Delhi said. 
The 58-year-old opposition leader, a former ally of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi who has served him as defense and fi­nance minister, claimed Gandhi's governing Congress Party was responsible. 
"It is a defeat of the govern­ment," said N.C. Jain, a Janata Dal official. "He reached Fatehpur barely 30 minutes be­fore the nominations were to close, but he did it."

The Administration offered no suggestions, said Hanley, adding that it wanted the stu­dent leaders to stop the light. 
Hanley and Toohey then called presidents of halls nor­mally involved in the annual light, asking. them to help dis­courage participants. 
"As far as we were concerned, that was all we could do," Hanley said. 
Hanley and Breslin said they were concerned by Tyson's comment that their efforts were unsuccessful. They said little advance warning and no administrative suggestions was not sufficient to stop the light. 
The University did issue a special bulletin on Oct. 19 to all halls. stating that "any individ­ual involved in throwing snow­balls ... will face serious disci­plinary consequences."

O'Keefe said that freezing the funds will not teach the stu­dents any lesson. Instead, Tyson should have issued fair warning for his actions via newspaper coverage and letters to students, O'Keefe said. 
"It might be reasonable to take an amount from the funds, but (the snowball fight) is something that happens, and there's not much you can do to prevent it," he said. 
O'Keefe said that Tyson's de­cision may stem from the fact that his own room in Dillon Hall was damaged. 
"I don't think he would go to this drastic a step if he lived in Carroll or Holy Cross, and not Dillon," he said. 
Tyson's windows had been repaired before the USC game. 
John Moorman, director of maintenance, said that no di­rect funding is allotted for snowball damage. "We have a modest amount of maintenance money for each building," he said, but not for "non-routine wear and tear." 
Breslin said Tyson is freezing the $20,000 as a punishment, and also to only allow the halls to bring themselves back up to par, not for any capital im­provements.

The problem facing student leaders is reimbursing those halls that have already spent their matching funds, Hanley said. 
"Punishment was directed to the wrong people," said Farley President Martha Wendel. "The people who do that kind of vandalism don't care about the dorms, but (administration) is punishing those who do," she said. 
Wendel also said that those involved in the incident proba­bly are not aware that match­ing funds exist. 
It is not the snowball fight it­self, but the few people acting maliciously who are the real culprits, Breslin said.

Dear:  

I am writing concerning the snowball fight of Thursday, October 19, 1989. This activity has degenerated into a dangerous situation which in recent years has involved an increasing amount of vandalism. Each year there are more injuries and broken windows. This year, six stained glass chapel windows received serious damage. The restoration of these windows, if even possible, will be very expensive. 
The University has repeatedly requested that this dangerous activity be tempered to stop injury and vandalism. This year Residence Life personnel met with student leaders to solicit their assistance. Appar­ently, the efforts of these people were insufficient to stem what is approaching a riot. 
The "mob dynamic" which develops makes crowd control and apprehension of those who intentionally damage property and persons near impossible. Though primarily a freshman phenomenon, upperclassmen have encouraged this activity. In short, it is a campus issue and requires campus responsibility. 
After consultation with other officers and the Student Affairs senior staff, I have requested that the matching funds for all residence halls be frozen indefinitely. I cannot see any point in allocating funds for hall life improvement when those funds should be used to defray the cost of repairs to the halls. When I am convinced that this type of activity will cease, there will be a reconsideration of the matching fund program. 
I suspect that this letter is disappointing. However, be assured that I am equally disappointed to have to write it. It was my expectation that common sense and concern for persons and property would have prevailed. Unfortunately, I was not correct. It is my understanding that the Office of Residence Life will be conducting a meeting of student leaders to again address this issue. It is my hope that the future efforts of dveryone will prevent a recurrence of activities that intentionally cause harm and damage to persons and property. 
Sincerely,

Witches at N.Y. Center for the Strange predict future 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK-Chicago-hog butcher for the world, tool maker, stacker of' wheat ... and global fashion capital? Ed Koch -U.S. ambassador to the United Nations? The newest fast food chain -McSushi? 
Do not adjust your set. You have entered the strange zone, a collection of forecasts, osten­sibly culled from a survey of American witches by very seri­ous folks at the New York Cen­ter for the Strange. 
Each year at llalloween, the center, which claims to be a non-profit organization in­volved in research, publishes a list of predictions based on a poll of 300 witches. 
Associate research director Lewis Scott insists these are not cackling types on brooms, but instead include a New York real estate tycoon, several members of Congress and the wife of a television evangelist. 
In addition to predicting that Chicago will replace Paris as a center for haute couture, Koch will become a diplomat and raw fish will be an even faster food than hamburgers, this year's survey finds that: 
Vice 
President Dan Quayle will write a book of rhymes for preschoolers. 

Geraldo 
Rivera will claim he was captured by visitors from outer space. 

There 
will be nationwide shortages of herring, banjos, billiard balls and Marilyn Quayle posters. 



A 
new book will claim that Zsa Zsa Gabor was born and raised in Ilouston. 

The 
Japanese will market a line of large laptop computers for obese traveling executives. 


The Strange people claim a track record. In previous years, they predicted Hichard Nixon's resignation, new freedoms for Eastern Europe and low rat­ings for Pat Sajak's talk show, they say. 
But a look at predictions from 1987 does not inspire 
conlidence. 
Remember when British Prime ~inistPr Margaret Thatcher appeared in a Jane Fonda workout video? No? HemembPr when Miehacl Jack­son tried to adopt Jim and Tammy Bakker, or when Oliver North started a chain of mili­tary summer camps? Maybe your were out of town that week. 
Or maybe ... you were in the strange zone.

on Hall while Rockne's haunts the turrets of Sorin. The old dorms and buildings on campus are filled with phantoms just awaiting your call. All you need is a good medium, and a few friends and candles to set up your very own seance. 
"Notre Dame is an incredibly powerful positive force, and therefore a great place to have a seance," said the Reverend Barbara Anne Bell, a psychic and medium from South Bend. She explained that a seance re­quires the maximum amount of positive power from each indi­vidual in order for it to work. You must avoid those who emit a negative force -that is, those who do not wholly believe in the validity of the seance. Bell also recommended purifying the air with holy water and incense be­

fore beginning the seance. 
In addition, Bell added that people shouldn't go to cemeter­ies in order to create a more ghoulish, frightening atmo­sphere. "People shouldn't be afraid of cemeteries. Cemeteries are consecrated ground. Evil spirits cannot be called up on consecrated ground." 
Spirits make contact with the material world through a per­son called a medium, of whom there are two kinds. 
The mental medium acts as a filter or receiver for messages from the spirits. Bell noted that "the spirit does not die, only the body dies." 
Physical mediums differ from mental ones in their ability to create physical phenomena, such as moving objects, making noises, and creating outpour­ings of ectoplasm which can take on human shapes. 
Most psychics recommend the use of a professional medium to control evil, untuly and mis­chievous spirits. 
Certain characteristics ac­company the medium's contact with spirits. 
First, during the sitting, the medium will usually rest quietly with closed eyes. A rapid change in breathing generally indicates the beginning of a trance. As he/she progresses into the trance, the medium will appear to fall asleep. Within a few moments, the medium will awaken and his/her personality will be taken over by the spirits. 
It is a good idea to think up several good questions before consulting your medium. According to "Channeling: The Intuitive Connection," questions posed for purposes of material gain can often times block the medium's "connection" with the spirit. In other words, to con­duct a seance for the "thrill" of it will probably not work. 
Hev. Bell had several predic­tions for Notre Dame this year. One in particular was that "Notre Dame will beat Miami and go to a bowl game for three consecutive years." Bell is willing to conduct seances for students for a small donation. "I'd love to investigate the ghost in Washington Hall, but I haven't had the opportunity to look into it yet," she said. Call her at 255-1625 for an appointment.

tion for the proposal spell. Simply light all the candles, al­low them to burn, and say "Shine with favor upon th~ one I love and light the path to the altar." Similar ceremonies can facilitate the breakup of an­other's love affair, help to dis­pel rumors, and even assist in winning a lawsuit. 
Not only that, candle wax can prove extremely adept at pre­dicting the future. A few drops of wax in a dish of cold water can reveal what the future holds in store. A little interpre­tation regarding shape may be necessary. If the wax takes the ~hape of an anchor, a loved one IS true. A pair of trousers signi­fies temptation close at hand. 
Psychic energy at this time of year is extremely potent. Students who find their GPA's are running away from them at this time might discover that a few minutes spent over sym­bolic candles are worth a few hours at the library.

The ghosts of Washington Hall

stage in Washington Hall and it 
was completely dark. Not even 
the Exit lights were on. The 
room was pitch black. I looked 


' ' I 

up in the balcony and there, in the cen­ter of the very last row, I saw the shadow of a person! Really!" 
Many of the numerous Notre Dame alumni have related this story, as it is a rumor that has been around Washington Hall for years. Notre Dame has its own supposedly haunted building, just as any town or community does. But, is Wash­ington Hall supposedly haunted, or is it really haunted? 
The rumor of Washington Hall being haunted began back in the 1920s. For months, students living in the Hall heard peculiar noises coming from the locked band room -noises like someone play­ing a tuba or a trumpet. The band room was locked, however, and when opened, no one was inside. 
People have speculated that the phan­tom is George Gipp (he slept on the steps of Washington Hall on a cold night and became fatally ill), or a Cavalry soldier slain by Indians (the campus is built on hallowed Indian burial grounds.) 
After the spectral trumpeteer passed on, other ghosts took its place. These ghosts slammed doors on windless nights and flushed all the toilets at once, after all the students were in bed (they had a curfew back then.) One man claimed he saw a ghost on a phantom horse outside climbing the steps to the second floor. 
The ghost sightings were not just a 20s fad, either, because in the 60s the ghostly 
strong. ­
One student turned off the lights on stage and was then unable to turn them back on -there was some­thing, or someone, keeping the switch in the "off' position. 
In addition, before the Washing­ton Hall renovations, one room in the hall was painted black. A student sleeping in the room awoke with the feeling of not being alone in the room. In the moonlight coming through the window, he saw a figure, ten feet tall, standing in the window. 
Even as recently as 1985 the haunting has been reported. A group of students with a Ouija board set up on stage and asked the ghost if he (it?) wanted to speak with them. 
The pointer darted to "No" and "Good­bye" and stopped. when the students asked why, the pointer moved back and forth be­tween the letters "S" and "G," moved to "Goodbye" again, and stopped. The stu­dents fled. Once out of Washington Hall, they looked back and saw that a securi­ty guard had just woken up. They had been warned just in time. 
Is this ghostly figure a figment of active alumni imagination, or is

someone truly there? Maybe this year we will find out.

LSU's Jackson winning battles against nervous disorder 
BATON HOUGE, La. (APJ ­The letters make the loss of privacy worthwhile for Chris Jackson. 
Only the second freshman ever named a college basketball All American, Jackson suffers from Tourette's syndrome, a nervous disorder that can cause victims to twitch, gesture, grunt or shout invol­untarily. 
Jackson seemed almost em­barrassed last year when knowledge of his illness accom­panied national attention given his basketball exploits. He av­eraged 30 points a game for Louisiana State University and twice topped 50 points in a game, breaking records set by Oklahoma's Waymon Tisdale when he was a freshman All­American at Oklahoma in the 1982-83 season. 
Going into his second season at LSU, Jackson is Dooded with letters from other victims of Tourette's syndrome. 
"I've had a lot of feedback on it -a lot of kids, a lot of par­ents write me telling me about their kids," he said. 
"Grown men have told me they were afraid to go outside for years. One man told me, 'You're doing so much. I'm not afraid to go out anymore.' I read one letter, a kid's mama wrote and said he read the ar­ticle in Sports Illustrated. She said he was reading about some of the things I do, and that encouraged him to try to do more." 
He said there is now an or­ganization devoted to providing information on Tourette's syn­drome. 
"They showed us a film with a guy, every second he was moving, talking, spitting, mak­ing signs. They told me I have a mild case. I'm kind of lucky. People have it worse than I have," he said. 
Opponents sometimes mis­took his involuntary gestures for hot-dogging and thought he was "woofing" at them when he grunted spontaneously. 
Medication can help control the symptoms, but work differ­ent ways on each person and have different side effects, he said. 
''I'm on some new medication prescribed by a specialist in Houston -Prozac in the morning and Prolyxin at night. It doesn't have some of the side effects of the medicine I was using," Jackson said. "It's working pretty good. 
"The last medicine made me gain weight and retain water. I felt bloated all the time. This makes me lose weight, which I prefer. I feel quicker and stronger. I'm 168 this year, and I got up to 188 last year. I felt stuffy. It made me want to sleep a lot. I was always drowsy. These don't make me drowsy at all." 
Misdiagnosis is a common problem for victims. Jackson was told he had some unfortunate habits. 
"I was in elementary school, and I'd like black out. I didn't know what was happening un­less someone tapped me our shouted real loud at me," he said. 
"I went to a doctor, and he gave me some medicine. He told me I was going to have some 
'habits.' That's all I knew it was -'habits.' 
"When I got in high school, the coach took me to a doctor, and that's when I found out there was a name for what I had. I felt a lot better. I knew I wasn't the only one in the world, and I knew there was something I could do for it." 
A common theme in the let­ters he gets from other victims is that they feel better knowing they are not alone, he said. 
His worst time was during his senior year in high school when recruiting got truly ugly, he said. Rumors circulated that he was almost a hostage of his mother, being auctioned off to the highest bidder. He denies those rumors but admits his mother tore up the first letter of intent he signed at LSU. 
"I didn't know what to do," he said. 
"When you get upset about something, that's when it really gets you. In high school, I was under so much pressure for a high school kid, and I didn't know what I wanted to do. That's when it was worst." 
Pressures of the game don't seem to bother him. He always appears calm on the court, even in nationally televised close games against ranked teams. 
''I'm always nervous before the game. I'm nervous, but I try to control it. Once I touch the ball, everything's OK," he said. 
It's off the court that things get rough. There's no such thing as a quiet stroll, any­more; it's always a procession. He's learned to write faster to get through throngs of auto­graph seekers. And he's learned to get to the gym early on Saturday's for a little private shooting practice before throngs gather for football games. 
"You don't have time for just basketball, anymore. You have to hit the books, and sometimes when you have free time, you just want to sleep," he said. "I like to get out in public, but I also like some peace some­times." 
And there are the letters to read. 

18 apply for free agency 
NEW YORK (AP) -Mark Langston ended his brief stay with the Montreal Expos Monday when he was among 18 players who filed for free agency on the first possible day. 
Langston, acquired by the 

Expos from Seattle on May 25, 
is seeking at least $3 million 
per season and is the most-tal­
ented starting pitcher available 
among the 117 players eligible 
for free agency. 
"The chances of him going 

back to the Expos are, well I 
wouldn't say never, but I would 
say very slim," said Arn Tellum, 
Langston's agent. 
First baseman Nick Esasky of 

the Boston H.ed Sox was the 
first player to declare free 
agency, filing with the Major 
League Baseball Players 
Association at 9:05 a.m. 
Outfielder Hubie Brooks, 
Langston's teammate on the 
Expos, also filed Mondav. 
Others filing included pitchers 

Jeff Heard on and Shane Rawley 
of Minnesota, pitchers Floyd 
Bannister and Steve Crawford 
of Kansas City, catcher Tony 
Pena and pitcher Ted Power of 
St. Louis, first baseman Pete 
O'Brien of Cleveland, pitchers 
Frank Tanana of Detroit and 
Walt Terrell of the New York 
Yankees, and outfielders Hick 
Leach of Texas and Lee Mazzilli 
of Toronto. 
Also filing Monday were out­

fielder Dave Collins of 
Cincinnati, pitcher Rick Hhoden 
of Houston, infielder Tim 
Teufel of the New York Mets 
and outfielder Carmelo 
Martinez of San Diego. ­
The remaining players eligible 

have until Nov. 13 to file. 
Two players who would have been eligible for free agency had their options for 1990 ex­ercised on Monday: George Bell ­of Toronto at $2.1 million and infielder Tom Foley of Montreal at $335,000. 
Seattle traded pitchers Randy Johnson, Scott Holman and Gene Harris to Montreal for Langston, who made $1.3 mil­
lion this season. The Expos have said they want to retain him but last week withdrew their offer.

Maleeva avoids upset bid in opening round of Slims 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) Defending champion and top­seed Katerina Maleeva fought of a sluggish first set and ral­lied to defeat unseeded Tami Whitlinger, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 Monday night in the first round of the Virginia Slims of Indianapolis. 
The 20-year-old Maleeva, ranked 14th in the world, used a solid repetoire of first serves and deadly drop shots to put away the 20-year-old American from Neenah, Wis. 
"My drop shots are just a good weapon that 1 learned from growing up on clay courts," Maleeva said. "We were hitting the ball very hard on the rallies, and so I thought she was probably waiting more for the hard shots instead of the drops. To tell the truth I was surprised they worked so well." 
The Bulgarian-born Maleeva had little trouble with Whitlinger after the first set. In the first set, Maleeva led 4-3 and was up a break before Whitlinger rallied to win three straight games, including two service breaks. 
"I got tentative and nervous after the first set and I wasn't letting myself play my game," said Whitlinger, ranked 132nd. "I was encouraged to know I could play that well against a great player, but I still have a lot of room for improvement." 

ND hockey splits weekend games 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Associate Sports Editor 
In a weekend that saw plenty of goals and youth but not much defense, the Notre Dame hockey team opened its season by splitting two games with the Rochester Institute of Technology at the Joyce ACC. 
The Irish scored in the final minute of regulation and the last minute of overtime to win the opening game 6-5, but Notre Dame defensive break­downs helped RIT take the sec­ond contest 7-3. 
"We're a little faster than we were last year, but we also have a little more hockey savvy," said Irish coach Ric Schafer, who is looking to keep last year's 10-26-2 campaign a thing of the past. "We have some freshmen who know how to play who have complemented our team nicely." 
Those freshmen came in handy in the season opener, as the play of newcomers like Sterling Black and Dan Sawyer helped Notre Dame stay close and eventually win the game. 
"I was pleased with the way our freshmen played; you had to look at the program to real­ize they were freshmen," said Schafer. "They weren't nervous­looking. They performed very well." 
The Irish had a most inauspi­cious first 10 minutes to their season. RIT, which reached the Division Ill national finals last season, scored twice in the first three minutes and added an­other goal midway through the first period to take a 3-0 lead.

the first period, cutting the Tiger lead to 3-1 at the first in­termission. 
Notre Dame proceeded to dominate matters in the second period, as RIT penalties enabled the Irish to get back into the game. Robert Copeland scored the second Irish goal on a power play at 3:19 of the pe­riod, with freshman Curtis Janicke recording the assist. 
After RIT answered that six minutes later with Todd Person's second goal of the evening, second-period scores by Notre Dame's Michael Curry and Lou Zadra tied the game at 4-4. 
"That second period was as good as any practice or scrim­mage we've had all year," said Schafer. 
With both teams failing to take advantage of third-period scoring opportunities, RIT's Charlie Forselius finally gave the Tigers a 5-4 lead with 2:05 remaining. 
Another penalty cost the Tigers. On a power play situa­tion, David Bankoske, last year's leading scorer, knocked in the tying goal with 52 sec­onds left in the game. 
Bankoske had an assist on the winning goal, a long slap shot by Sawyer with 57 sec­onds left in the five-minute overtime. 
"There were a couple of op­portunities to say, 'Here we go again,' when we were down 3-0 or when they got the go-ahead goal with 1 1/2 minutes left in the game," said Schafer. "Their hard work was rewarded." 
Things did not look quite as bright for Notre Dame the fol­lowing day, though the Irish did get off to a better start this time. 
After HIT's Scott Martin opened the scoring 3:16 into the game, Michael Curry tied the game 16:41 into the opening period and Bankoske gave Notre Dame the lead 7:07 into the second period. 
But the Irish allowed four goals in the closing half of the second period, with three of RIT's scores coming in a span of less than three minutes. 
"There were plenty of defen­sive breakdowns,'' said Schafer. "We had a lot of lackluster play. If it happens in the next game or the one after, I'll give you an exact reason for it. Right now, it was just an off­night. We didn't play well." 
Black scored to make it a 5-3 game with 15 minutes left. But RIT's Tim Cordick scored just 36 seconds after Black's tally, and Chris Palmer added another goal for the Tigers with just 20 seconds remaining as both teams evened their records at 1-1. 
RIT scored a pair of short­
handed goals in its win Friday. 
"That was a nemesis for us 
last year," said Schafer. "That 
could be my fault in our

the power play. I guess we need

Irish disappointed with MCC showing 
By BARBARA MORAN Sports Writer 
The women's cross country team had a bittersweet midsemester break, taking both a strong win over Marquette in a dual meet at the outset of break and a tough loss to Dayton at the MCC championships last weekend. 
The Irish had a decisive win over MCC rival Marquette, beating the Warriors by a score of 18 to 
44. Only one Marquette run­ner finished in the top five, with Notre Dame capturing the top two spots. Irish run­ner Lucy Nusrala placed first overall, with teammate Amy Blaising taking second. 
Irish coach Tim Connelly was pleased with the results and praised his runners for a "good team effort." 
The MCC meet was another story. Notre Dame placed a dis­appointing second, finishing 
behind a tough Dayton squad. Both teams placed two runners in the top ten, but Dayton finished with a total score of 35, while the Irish ended up with 57 points. Lucy Nusrala again finished first for the Irish, taking fourth overall. The other top ten finisher for Notre Dame was Amy Blaising , who took ninth overall. Both Blaising and Nusrala were awarded All­Conference honors. 
"We should have won," said the coach. "We just didn't run well. Dayton had a better team last year, but they beat us more convinc­ingly this year. They beat us by two points last year, but at least we competed last year." 
''I'm not really sure why we ran so poorly," said Connelly. "We were certainly well rested. Dayton just beat us. They're not a better team in terms of talent, they just wanted it more than we did." 

Men capture conference title again 
By MARY GARINO Sports Writer 
They did it again. 
For the second year in a row, the men's cross country team captured the Midwestern Collegiate Conference champi­onship, beating out seven other teams for the title. 
The Irish won in impressive fashion, placing six runners in the top ten to edge second place Loyola by eight points, 27-35. 
The meet, held Saturday in Milwaukee, ended up as a battle between Notre Dame and Loyola, a team the Irish de­feated earlier this year at the National Catholics, when Notre Dame finished first and Loyola took third. 
Head coach Joe Piane and the rest of the Irish runners antici­pated that Loyola and Notre Dame would be the dominant teams, which proved to be cor­rect as runners from the two teams made up nine of the top ten finishers. But Loyola was unable to upset the Irish. 
"We knew it would be a dual meet between Loyola and us, and that's the way it turned out," said Piane. "It was a good meet, though, and a good preparation for the NCAAs." 
Mike O'Connor continued to lead the Irish at the MCC Championships as he has done all year for the team. O'Connor was the third overall finisher in the race, following two runners from Loyola. 
Freshman J.T. Burke placed fourth, and Pat Kearns was close behind in fifth. Kearns contines to post good numbers as he struggles to come back from injuries. 
Loyola took the sixth spot in the race, but Notre Dame's Tom O'Rourke came in seventh to complete the Irish scoring and secure the victory. 
"I was pleased with our top seven runners, but I am also confident that our fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh can run bet­ter," Piane said. 
Marquette was a distant third in the meet, with a total of 80 points. The rest of the field of eight squads accumulated over 100 points each. 
The Irish victory at the MCC Championships was the second triumph for the team over fall break. On October 21, the Irish hosted Southern California and had an easy victory, trouncing the Trojans 17-44. 
O'Connor, Burke, O'Rourke and Kearns were the top fmish­ers in the race. Southern Cal averted a sweep by taking the fifth and sixth places, but Ryan Cahill placed seventh to round out the Irish scoring. Notre Dame had seven runners across the finish line before USC had a third finisher. Southern Cal's much-touted Fredson Mayiek did not present any challenge for the victory, and the Irish payed the Trojans back for last year's defeat. 
"They had beaten us the year before, so the guys wanted to prove something," Piane said. "Our kids were really very fired up." 
The USC meet and the MCC championships both served as valuable experience and confi­dence boosters for the Irish as they head into the NCAA District IV meet in two weeks. The meet qualifies four teams for the NCAA championships, held on November 20. Notre Dame has placed in the top ten in the country in the past two years with strong performances 
in the  NCAAs,  and  the  Irish  
would  like  to  repeat  that  
success.

Cutting Edge Review Sharpens Study Skills 
CHICAGO-Viewed by the industry as the most progressive CPA review program in the country, Conviser Duffy continues to make unprecedented achieve­ments in applying accelerated learning techniques. 
Michael J. Duffy, National Program Director, feels that the learning method used by their lecturers "eliminates the mental block that inhibits most students' natural learning ability. As the student becomes more relaxed, his or her ability to recall increases." 
Duffy feels that his program exercises the ability of the CPA candidate to both visualize their goal (passing the CPA exam) and realize it. How? By learning to do the following: 
-Create a relaxed study environment -Make the mental associations upon which visual learning depends -Rehearse and immediately reinforce information -Organize and group ideas -Interact with the lecturer. 
The above points are neatly tied together with Conviser Duffy's live/video presentation, comprehensive textbooks, workbook, tape make-up facilities and unconditional guarantee. 
Says Duffy, "Preparing for the CPA exam is serious business and it takes a ­serious commitment from both parties to succeed." Ali this is powerful news for the accountant who wants to gain his certification with the most professional streamline review on the market.

Baseball squad falls to USC, 8-1 

By STEVE MEGARGEE Associate Sports Editor 

Bearing a lineup almost en­tirely different from that which reached the NCAA tournament last year, the Notre Dame baseball team fell 8-1 to Southern California in the Irish Fall Classic at Coveleski Stadium. 
Aside from Joe Binkiewicz at first base, Cory Mee at second, captain Ed Lund at catcher and Brian Piotrowicz as the starting pitcher, none of the players on last year's Irish starting lineup were returning starters at their positions. The Irish will be entering this spring with vir­tually a brand-new team. 
The inexperienced Irish team compiled five errors and man­aged only six hits off a very sound USC pitching staff. 
"Our youth showed," Notre Dame coach Pat Murphy said after the Oct. 21 afternoon con­test. "The credit goes to USC. That team, like Miami last year, will be in the College World Series. You can't beat teams like that every time." 
Notre Dame developed a rep­utation last season for knock­ing off the nation's elite, sweeping a two-game exhibi­tion series with Miami over the fall, then beating Texas and Miami during the regular sea­son. 
Texas and Miami each were 
ranked among the nation's top 
five teams before playing Notre Dame, and both eventually reached the College World Series. 
But the only surprising ele­ment of this contest, sponsored by the South Bend Tribune, was that it even came off at all. Regulary scheduled for the nights of Oct. 19-20 (the two days before the Notre Dame­USC football game), those con­tests got postponed by the un­seasonal snowfall. 
The exhibition contest finally was played on a sunny Sunday afternoon, the day after the football game. 

USC wasted no time getting on the scoreboard, with Brett Jenkins hitting a towering two­out solo home run to left field off Piotrowicz in the first in­ning. The Trojans added a sin­gle run in the second inning. 
Notre Dame then kept the game close, with freshman pitcher David Sinnes holding USC scoreless for the next three innings 
USC put the game away with a four-run outburst in the sixth inning. The Trojans had only two hits in the inning, but they took advantage of a Notre Dame fielding error and four walks allowed by Irish pitchers. 
Damon Buford, the son of former major leaguer Don, de­livered the key blow, a bases­loaded double that scored Mike Robertson and Corey Aurand. Buford went on to score on a sacrifice fly by Bret Boone, the son of major leaguer Bob. 


Oakland marks win in quiet celebration 
The Irish scored their only run in the eighth, when pinch­hitter Jason Martinez hit a sac­rifice fly that scored Mee, who had led off the inning with a double. 
USC added two runs in the 
ninth, as the Irish committed 
two errors. 

Three of Notre Dame's errors 
came from the third base posi­

tion. Following the departure 
of Pat Pesavento last spring, 
Murphy moved third baseman 
Mike Coss to shortstop and had 
Craig Counsell go from the 
outfield to third base. Counsell 
committed two errors, and re­

placement Mike Rooney had one 
of the ninth-inning miscues. 

"We've got a problem at third base," said Murphy. "We don't have a solid third baseman. We're going to rectify that problem really quick." 
Sophomore Brian Conway and freshmen Pat Leahy, Chris Michalak and Alan Walania all had turns on the mound after Sinnes left the game in the sixth. Murphy was most im­pressed with the performances of Sinnes, Michalak and Walania. 
Following the game, Boone (2-for-2, 2 RBI) was named as USC's most valuable player for the game and Mike Rotkis (2­of-3) received the same honor for Notre Dame. 

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) ­A mile from the site of the earthquake's worst disas­ter, Oakland celebrated a World Series victory Monday in a muted rally that recalled the wreckage and marked the city's re­newal. 
More than 4,000 fans of the Oakland Athletics, who completed a four-game sweep of the San Francisco Giants on Saturday, joined in the rally in Jack London Square that began with music, a flag processional and a moment of silence for quake victims. 
The parade was subdued compared to the celebra­tion after the San Francisco 49ers' Super Bowl victory last January, but the A's were still grate­ful. 
"The longer you have to wait for something, the more it means to you," A's Manager Tony La Russa said. "Nobody likes the reason we had to wait so long to be the world cham­pions, but I know it means a great deal to all of us." 
The 1989 Athletics, La Russa said, are among the best teams in baseball his­tory, including the 1975 Cincinnati Reds and the 1927 New York Yankees. 
Each of the players, standing in front of a ban­ner that read, "Oakland's World Serious," spoke briefly to the crowd. 
LET'S HEAR IT FOR ITIEMAN! 
"After last year's disap­pointing loss to the Dodgers, the most gratify­ing part about winning this year was showing the whole world what the A's are really like," third baseman Carney Lansford said. 
Pitcher Dave Stewart, an Oakland native and MVP of the Series after winning the first and third games, drew one of the loudest ovations. 
"Last year when the Series was over," he said, "the one thing we all said in the clubhouse is that there were two teams that played in the World Series. One won, but there was only one ballclub that could expect to come back again next year. And we were that club." 
A few minutes earlier and a mile away, workers clearing battered vehides from the crumpled section of Interstate 880 removed the car in which the last survivor of the collapse was trapped for four days. Thirty-nine people died in the Oct. 17 earthquake. 
Plans for a more tradi­tional parade and ceremony at City Hall were canceled because of the disaster, which occurred a half-hour before the originally scheduled third game at Candlestick Park.

continued from page 24 

ever, have become more limited. 
While representatives from nine bowls-Citrus, Cotton, Fi­esta, Gator, Hall of Fame, John Hancock, Orange, Peach and Sugar-were on hand Saturday, the list appears to be three, at the very most, if Notre Dame finishes the season at 12-0. 
The Orange and Sugar Bowls have the inside track on the Irish, with the Fiesta '8owTllm­long shot in the race to land the national title contest. 
Here's a sketch of those ma­jor bowls and Notre Dame's chances of playing in each con­test. 
Orange Bowl -This is the game everyone has talked about all year. The winner of the Big Eight has an automatic bid. Nebraska and Colorado, both undefeated, play this Sat­urday in Boulder with the win­ner most likely going to the Or­ange Bowl, barring a collapse. 
Most people thought the win­ncr of the Miami-Notre Dame game would provide the opposi­tion. But with Miami's loss, the Irish will probably get the invi­tation when unofficial bids go out Nov. 17, one week before their clash with the Hurricanes. 
"The Orange Bowl is in a good position," Orange Bowl President Thomas Wood said Saturday at the Notre Dame­Pitt game. "We have the top four teams to look at (before Miami lost). We have no idea how this thing is going to turn out in the end." 
The Orange Bowl has turned out four national champs in this decade-Miami in 1983 and 1987, Oklahoma in 1985 and Clemson in 1981. 
Sugar Bowl -Alabama could come into this game as the un­defeated champions of the Southeast Conference if it beats LSU and Auburn in late-season contests. 
For the Irish to play the Crimson Tide, Nebraska would need to beat Colorado and then lose to Oklahoma. Alabama must then win its remaining games. 
One possible drawback is that Alabama meets Auburn on Dec. 2, two weeks after the unoffi­cial bids go out. If the Irish ac­cept the bid to play in the Sugar Bowl, they could risk not play­ing the highest-ranked oppo­nent. 
Fiesta Bowl -This is the longshot of the group. For Notre Dame to play in Arizona again, a lot of pieees would have to fall into place. 
For starters, Nebraska must ' beat Colorado this Saturday and then lose to Oklahoma 
later this fall. Alabama must then drop one of its remaining games, but before the Dec. 2 contest against Auburn because the Irish may have already se­lected the Sugar Bowl. 
The matehup would put the Irish against Florida State, losers of two early-season games but still possibly one of the top live teams in the coun­try. The Seminoles started slowly, but are finishing with a fervor, evidenced by the win over Miami. Florida State must still play Florida. 
"We'd love to have the Irish back," Fiesta Bowl Board Member Purd Thomas said. "They will want to play the highest-ranked opponent. We would have to lind an opponent. Florida State has illustrated that if you're going to lose, do it early. They're a great team that just got off to a slow start." 
Right now, it looks like the Fiesta Bowl eould get the left­overs from the Orange Bowl, maybe Miami and the loser of Colorado-Nebraska. 
Don't forget about Michigan, losers to Notre Dame in the opening game of the season. If no team is unbeaten after Jan. 1, the Wolverines could sneak into the picture if they can win the Hose Bowl. 
Florida State back where it began 
Florida State is back where it started in The Associated Press' college football poll. 
The Seminoles were sixth in the preseason rankings, but dropped out of the Top 25 after losing their first two games. However, they have won six straight and climbed baek to No. 6 in Monday's poll. 
Saturday's 24-10 victory over Miami moved the Seminoles up three places in the rankings. Miami fell from No. 2 to No. 7 after losing for only the second time in its last 50 regular-sea­son games. 
The victory put Florida State back into eontcntion for a ma­jor bowl bid and probably ended Miami's bid for the na­tional championship. 
Meanwhile, Notre Dame strengthened its grip on the top spot by routing previously un­beaten Pittsburgh 45-7. The Fighting Irish, who have won 20 in a row, received a season­high 58 of 60 first-place votes from a nationwide panel of sports writers and broadcast­ers. 
The other two votes went to second-ranked Colorado, whose 20-3 win over Oklahoma was its first vietory in Norman since 1965. The Buffaloes are ranked just ahead of Nebraska, which also improved to 8-0 by beating Iowa State 49-17. 

The winner of Saturday's Colorado-Nebraska showdown in Boulder will probably play for the national championship in the Orange Bowl. 
Michigan, which beat Indiana 38-10, is ranked fourth while Alabama, which remained un­defeated by edging Penn State 17-16, is fifth. Florida State and Miami are next, followed by Illinois, Southern California and Tennessee. 
Illinois stayed No. 8 after beating Wisconsin 32-9, Southern Cal rose one spot after blanking Stanford 19-0 and Tennessee went from No. 11 to No. 10 following its 45-39 victory over Louisiana State. 
Arkansas, which beat Houston 45-39, leads off the Second Ten. Auburn is 12th, followed by West Virginia, Pittsburgh, Arizona, Penn State, Houston, North Carolina State, Florida and Texas A&M. 
Auburn beat Mississippi State 14-0, West Virginia downed Boston College 44-30, Arizona defeated Pacifie 38-14, N.C. State beat South Carolina 20­10 and Texas A&M routed Rice 45-7. 
Rounding out the Top 25 are Clemson, Texas, Brigham Young, Virginia and Fresno State. Dropping out were South Carolina and Washington State, which lost to Arizona State 44­39. 
Virginia and Fresno State are ranked for the first time this season. Virginia, which im­proved to 7-2 after beating Louisville 16-15, is tied for first in the Atlantic Coast Conferenee with N.C. State. The co-leaders meet Saturday in Raleigh. 
Fresno State extended its winning streak to 15 games Saturday with a 31-17 victory over Nevada-Las Vegas. Fresno has been ranked only twice since the AP poll began in 1936. The Bulldogs were No. 18 after starting the 1942 season with seven straight wins and No. 19 for one week in 1986. 
Brigham Young dropped five places after getting crushed by Hawaii 56-14.

"I apologize to Southern Cal because it's our job to avoid that. I promise that will never ever happen again as long as I am the coach. If that happens ever again, I will not coach again. That's how strongly I feel about this." 
In the eyes of the national press, and thus in the eyes of the nation, the Irish were the villains here. Forget about USC's Golden Boy, Todd Marinovich's taunting and finger-pointing at the Notre Dame defense, when the Trojans were winning. 
Forget about the Trojans' singing of the Notre Dame fight song at halftime, when the Trojans were winning. Forget about the Trojans whining about the Irish team and Notre Dame security, after they'd lost the game. And forget the fact that the Notre Dame players weren't the only ones out there fighting. 
Notre Dame accepted responsibility and was trashed for it. The Trojans came away wearing halos, accusing the Irish team of inciting the brawl. It takes two to tango, fellas. 
The bashing wasn't only in Sports Illustrated. From Mal­colm Moran's column in the New York Times, Oct. 25: 
"The fact that should alarm those in the administration building beneath the Golden Dome is that in spite of years of effort to achieve its exemplary graduation rate of athletes, the football program has created the appearance of being too much like Those Places where the only thing wrong with a 19-game winning streak is that it hasn't reached 
20." 

Nothing has changed at 
The Observer 

Notre Dame, except the team is tougher. It's had more to overcome, and more to live up to. 
Notre Dame shouldn't be turned into the scourge of the college football world because of emotions running high before a big game. When beating you is the top priority of every team you face, emotion is a plus, not a minus. 
Of course, being a Notre Dame student, my heart lies with the Irish. I'll admit, they were in the middle of it, and it has happened before. But enough is enough. Notre Dame won the game. It was a good, clean game, another classic in a series where classics are ex­pected. 
Tunnel vision shouldn't affect the the outlook on the game. Don't let the pregame festivities outshine the game itself.

Whatever plain Notre Dame is on. they certainly got there on the ground. The Irish ran. And then ran some more.

Perhaps what allowed the Irish to shine in their matchup against their third Top 10 op­ponent of the season was the bend-but-not-break Irish defensive squad. The "Evil Eleven" held the 16th-rated collegiate offense to 302 net yards. More impressive was the fad that Irish stymied Panther redshirt freshman quarterback Alex Van Pelt, who was eighth in passing efliciency at 146.8 entering the game, to a 16-33 (.480) performance for 170 yards. The Irish defense pinned Pitt in the end zone with 6:07 left in the first quarter and recorded their first safPtv of the season when Van Pelt lost his footing. 
The Irish defensive line turned in an effective pass rush, utilizing an increased number of stunts and blitzes to disrupt Van Pelt and the entire Panther offense. Notre Dame did not record any sacks, but had five tackles for loss totaling 26 yards. The defense also batted down five passes, three by defensive tackle Jeff Aim.

"It felt like a punt return. I got some great blocks from the entire defense, and guys were just flying all over the place and I just took it to the house," said Terrell. "We are always looking for the big play when we get in certain situations." 
The Irish secondary, which has been the recipient of much of the recent criticism of the Irish defense, picked off three passes for the fourth time in the last five games. 


Rams experiencing tough times 
ANAIIEIM. Calif. (AP) -John Hobinson says he is experienc­ing an interesting time for a coach. 
"Horrible but interesting. 
"If I knew what to do, I'd al­ready have done it," he added, pondering how to halt the Los Angeles Hams' three-game los­ing streak and transform them back into the winners they were through the first five weeks of the season. 
When the Hams were sailing along with a perfect record. Hobinson warned it wouldn't last. that all teams arn doomed to slump at times, and he pre­dicted "We'll stink up the joint some Sundays." 
After starting 5-0, the Hams lost at Buffalo 23-20 on Oct. 16, then did in fact stink up the joint in a 40-21 loss to New Orleans the following Sunday. That was followed with a 20-10 loss to the Bears -themselves snapping a mysterious three­game losing streak -last Sunday. 
Hobinson. speaking Monday at his wePkly meeting with re­porters, said the Hams simply must light through the adver­sity, and that no drastic changes are called for. 
"We clearly have some prob­lems; wn don't have that confi­dence and flair we had earlier," Hobinson said. "The precision we pl~ycd with earlier just isn't there. 

Hellecting on the loss to the Bears, Hobinson said, "The things that seem to make a dif­ference, we just didn't do .... We made 130 plays OK, but the 10 important plays, we didn't." 
The most obvious change be­tween the first live games and the last three arc a lack of con­sistency on offense, particularly in the passing game. 
Jim Everett, near the top of the NFL passing ratings after live games with a 104.3 rating, had a poor 61.3 rating in the three losses. 
The three teams that have beaten the Rams seemed to have put considerably more pressure on Everett, sacking 
him 10 times compared to eight in the opening live games. 
Hobinson, however, said he thought the pass protection was adequate, but that Everett -and the rest of the team ­was just a littJ,. out of synch. 
Again talking about the Chicago game, Hobinson said, "I don't think the pass rush was a factor. "

It's time to "Leave the Pack Behind" 
EAST lANSING. Mieh. (AP) ­Indiana running back Anthony Thompson is welcome to break the national touchdown record against Miehigan State, just as long as his team loses, Coach George Perles said Monday. 
"I don't worry about records. All we want to do is play them as hard as we can." Perles said. "We'll do everything we can and makP all our decisions based on trying to win the football game. 
"As far as records go, you can get yourself into a lot of problems when you worry about things other than win­ning the football game. Hecords will take care of themselves." 
Make no mistake, the sturdy Michigan State defense will work to keep Thompson out of the end zone, which it has done successfully over the past two years. 
Thompson has gotten only one of his 59 career touch­downs against the Spartans, back in 1986. when he picked up 126 yards on 35 carries. In 1987, he gained 23 yards on 10 carries and got 34 yards on nine rushes last year. 
The key, Perles said, is to get a lead against the Hoosiers. 
"Over the last two years, he hasn't hurt us that bad, be­cause we got ahead. We scored and we controlled the ball. We ran the ball very well and we got a lot of yardage," he said. 
"So he wasn't on the field 
that much and we got a good 
lead where it was diflicult for them to do the thing that he does best. and that's pound the ball." 
Michigan State, 3-4 overall and 2-2 in the Big Ten, travels to Bloomington. Ind., this week to take on the Hoosiers. 4-3 and 2-2. The game will b1~ shown nationally by ESPN, the cable television sports network. 
The Spartans snapped a two­game losing streak last Saturday with a 28-21 squeaker over Purdue that wasn't decided until the final play, while the lloosiers were pounded 34-10 by Michigan. 
Thompson scored in the Michigan game to tie the touchdown record of 59 held by Pitt's Tony Dorsett and Army's Glenn Davis. 
Michigan State punter Josh Butland could be sidelined for this week's game with a sore foot. Somebody stepped on his foot while he was trying to scramble for a first down after a bad snap against Purdue, Perles said, adding that Butland also hurt his back dur­ing the pre-game warmups. 
Place-kicker John Langeloh and split end James Bradley. who punted during his junior college career, will practice at punting this week. 
Meanwhile, No. 1 backup quarterback John Gieselman is expected to be out for the rest of the season with a knee injury he suiTered in the fourth quar­ter of the Purdue game, Perles said.

Notre Dame stays unbeaten with two wins 
Big comeback drowns hopes of Trojan upset By STEVE MEGARGEE 
Associate Sports Editor 

For all the excitement Notre Dame and Southern California created on the field in a 28-24 Irish victory, all the talk afterward con­cerned two incidents in the tunnel leading to the locker rooms. 
The tryst everybody will remember came be­fore the Oct. 21 contest, when a fight ensued as Southern California players tried to enter the tunnel as the Irish were running punting drills in the end zone. The episode had Irish coach Lou Holtz saying he would quit if such an event occurred again. 
"I sincerely apologize to Southern Cal," said Holtz. "I promise this will never happen again 
at Notre Dame regardless of who was at fault." 
But the Trojans also made a big mistake in that fateful Notre Dame Stadium tunnel, while both teams were exiting the field at halftime. And that error might have been what propelled the Irish to their seventh consecutive victory over Southern Cal. 
With a 17-7 halftime lead over the nation's top-ranked team, the Trojans felt they had cause for singing. So the taunting Southern Cal players appropriately broke into a rendition of the Notre Dame Vietory March. 
"They were taunting us, and that woke up a sleeping giant," said offensive guard Tim Grunhard. 
Tony Rice and the Notre Dame defense were the major figures to break out of their slum­ber. Hice compiled 71 of his 99 rushing yards in the second half and scored the winning touchdown on a twisting, diving 15-yard keept~r with 5:18 to play. 
see USC I page 21 
Putting tunnel incident in a proper perspective 
The Notre Dame football team ac­cepted the responsibility for the pregame activities in, and around, the tunm1l before the Irish-Southern Cal game Oct. 21. 
Unfortunately, the Irish were sad­dled with the blame-a blame that unnneessarily overshadowed Notre Dame's come-from-behind victory and was blown completely out of proportion in its relation to the game. 
Notre Dame bashing has become a sport unto itself, and a certain amount of that is to be expected. After all, when you can't criticize a team for their on-field performance, you have to look for something else to exploit. 
Some nxcerpts from Douglas S. Looney's article from Sports Illustrated, Oct. 30: 
· "After completing their pregame warm ups, the Trojans discovered that they would have to run a Notre Dame gantlet to enter the tunnel leading to both teams' locker rooms. Several Trojans brushed shoulder pads with their Irish counterparts, who had gone out of their way to block the path to the tunnel ... Unpleasantries were exchanged, and about 20 Southern Cal players, surrounded by a sea of blue and gold. had to brawl their way free. " 
·1\s for Notre Dame, it survived, though without much style and without much class. Now Holtz has to get the Irish cranked up again this week for a home game against Pitt. Let's hope that while he's doing it, he also teaches his children some tunnel etiquette." 
This actual description of the melee is unprovable. No one is telling what really happened, if, in fact, anyone really knows. 
Looney says Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz "admitted that the episode was the fault of his players." 
Holtz didn't find fault or assign blame. Holtz took re­sponsibility, which is not the same thing. Holtz took re­sponsibility on Notre Dame's behalf; after all, it was Notre Dame Stadium. The host won't blame his guest for a fight at the party.
.. "I am deeply disturbed and distressed by the incidents

that happened before the ballgame," Holtz said. "I have to believe that that should have been avoided by Notre Dame. No matter what actually happened, that was to be avoided at all costs.

Irish boost mark to 8-0 
afterweekofadveffii~ 
By BOB MITCHELL 
Sports Writer 
After a week full of battling perhaps their toughest opponent of the season-the media­the top-ranked Fighting Irish were just glad to be playing football again. And after a week of trying to preserve a gentleman-like image, the Irish let out all their frustrations on the sev­enth-ranked Pittsburgh Panthers. 
Simply put, the Panthers were in the wrong place at the wrong time. The Irish put forth their finest complete game to date and trounced the Panthers 45-7 at Notre Dame Stadium in front of the usual sellout crowd of 59,075. 
"Pitt is a fine football team," said Holtz, holding to form. "This is the first time we played a complete game as a complete team. I thought our football team played well and they played together. It was just one of our days. Pitt had an extra week to get ready for us, but we did have an advantage. The week we had seemed like a good month." 
Barring the first six minutes of the game when the Panthers, utilizing a no-huddle of­fense, marched 6S yards to draw first blood in this battle, Notre Dame dominated. As far as Pittsburgh is concerned, their highlight 111m might as well end after the first drive. It was all Irish after that. The game was so one-sided that Panther coach Mike Gottfried suggested that his team totally reevaluate itself. 
"Notre Dame just whipped us in every area," said a dejected Gottfried, who looked liked he had been to hell and back again by this time. "We unravelled and we played inconsistent. We made so many mistakes. We self-destructed. I don't want to take anything away from Notre
