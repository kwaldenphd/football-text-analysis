Irish victories confirm ND credibility 
By ANDREW SOUKUP 
News Writer 
Hcturn to glory used to be a catchy T-shirt phrase. Now it's a statement about a football giant awakening from a decade-long slumber. 
As dnzens of Irish players cel­ebrated Saturday on the field of Florida State's Doak Campbell Stadium, as hundreds of Notre Dame student<; celebrated in the bleachers, as thousands of Notre Dame fans celebrated across the nation, one man managed to remain calm. 
After most of the Florida State crowd had filtered out of the sta­dium, Tyrone Willingham stood with his 
a r m s 
crossed, his "It's great to take a Notre Dame 
back to near-team's heart in their own would be 1y 50 lucky to win
stadium."

reporters. lie eight games looked all season, let straight Glenn Earl alone eight of 
ahead, star­safety their first 
ing at the scoreboard that had Notre Dame 34, Florida State 24 blazing as bright as Notre Dame's future. 
"Is this a Notre Dame moment? I think it is," athletic director Kevin White said min­utes after the Irish improved to 8-0. "I think this clearly is a spe­cial moment in the history of this University." 
Even as White, the man who hired Willingham after botching the George O'Leary debacle, gushed about the Notre Dame resurgence under Willingham, the Irish coach searched for a way to explain how a team that finished with a losing record in two of the past three years now sits undefeated and on the brink of a national championship. 
"We've not looked at it as 8-0." said Willingham. only the fourth Irish coach to win his first eight games with the Irish. "We've looked at it as win, win. win." 
It's a position the Irish haven't been in for a while. 
When Notre Dame beat Florida State in 1993, it was the last high-water mark for a foot­ball team that would experience nine years of mediocrity. ' ;ie Irish lost their next gaml' to Boston College, missed out on a chance at a national title and have never seriously challenged for a championship since. 
The underdog Irish began the season unranked, unknown and 
unrespected. 
Many thought 


eight. This 

was supposed to be a rebuilding year, a year that Notre Dame adjusted to Willingham and played in a dot­corn bowl game. 
But if the Irish heard the talk about rebuilding, they didn't pay attention. They were too busy reloading. Now, they're ranked No. 3 in the latest Bowl Championship Series standings. just four wins and four-tenths of a point from creeping into the national championship Fiesta Bowl.

In response to the recent sniper attacks in the Washington, D.C. area, administrators at the Center for Social Concerns opted to cancel the planned fall break Washington Seminar and Living the Gospel of Life Seminar trips to the nation's capital.

Saint Mary's hires security escorts 
By JAMIE BELCHER 
News Writer 
Students and faculty on the Saint Mary's Campus may have noticed this semester that security escorts have been tak­ing longer than in the past. 
Interim Security Director Rosemarie Harris has found a solution for the problem. 
"We've hired two escort dri­vers and we are going to be using a van so that we can transport more students at one time," Harris said. 
The escort drivers are actual­ly off duty firemen that the col­lege has hired from the South Bend Fire Department. Cyril Quinn and John Firtl joined the team of security officers at the college starting Monday. 
When they are not working at the firehouse, they will be on hand at the college seven days a week. The department is also hoping that having firemen on staff will improve service in the case of an emergency and also promote safety on campus. 
Quinn and Firtl will alternate days, working a night shift from 8 p.m. to 2 a.rn. escorting students around campus. 
The college has also decided to start using vans, instead of cars, for efficiency and added security. 
"We are asking them, because they are in a van. that when they are not escorting somebody that they patrol the parking lot, just to keep an eye on the vehicles there. Since they are up in a van they can see things a little bit better." Harris said. 
In an effort to cut back on the number of calls to the dispatch area, the department plans to

INSIDE COLUMN 
FSU fans 

shovV class 

Let me start this column by saying that I am NOT a Seminole's fan. Growing up in a family of Florida Gators and cheering for the Irish has nurtured a certain hatred for Florida State within me, or as I call 
them (due to past players'/convicts' behavior), Free Shoes University. 
I was, however, pleasantly sur­prised by the way in which the 'Noles treated visiting 

Notre Dame fans. I've been dying to Andrew Thagard 
go to the Notre 
Assistant

Dame-Florida State game since I News Editor first learned about it. I borrowed seven friends IDs and entered the SUB­sponsored ticket lottery, figuring I'd be a shoo-in with eight chances to win two tickets. I soon learned, however, that a few other Darners shared my interest in attending the game. In fact, over a quar­ter of the University's underclassmen entered the ticket lottery, according to SUB. 
Determined to be at Doak Campbell Stadium on Oct. 26, I arrived at Lafortune a little after 5 a.m. one Monday morning to purchase two of the 15 unsold tickets. Again, my attempt was thwarted -this time by two oppor­tunistic Morrissey residents who pur­chased the extra tickets before me and then scalped them to the highest bidder. 
No matter, I thought after wishing death upon them, I'll still get tickets. I called all the ads in The Observer classi­fieds and checked around online, but quickly realized I couldn't afford to spend over $200 per ticket. 
My offers to donate a kidney or my first-born child in exchange for two tick­ets also went unanswered. 
It looked like I wasn't going to the game. 
Salvation, however, came in the form ofa friend at Florida State who went out ofthe way to track down two tickets for me and my University of Florida friend. 
In addition to that generosity, Seminole fans showed respect toward us throughout game day. I assumed that my Notre Dame kelly-green T-shirt and my friend's Gator T-shirt in the student section would guarantee us martyrdom. 
Iwas wrong. 

Aside from some friendly trash talk­ing, everyone in the student section was very hospitable. I watched in awe and fear as over 80,000 'Noles did the infa­mous tomahawk and no one complained when I cheered at Irish successes. It was the way college football is supposed to be. 
One Seminole fan, in fact, asked me where he could purchase one ofthe Notre Dame shirts. After the game, my friend even gave me my moment to rub in the Notre Dame victory. 
This past weekend Isaw our football team prove once again that they're awe­some but I also saw Florida State fans prove that they have class. Now who would've guessed that?

Following improvements in his condition, Father Edmund Joyce was moved from St. Joseph Regional Medical Center to Holy Cross House on Oct. 25 to continue his recovery from a stroke he suffered on Sept. 20. 
Holy Cross House, located on Notre Dames campus near Moreau Seminary, serves as a retirement community for Holy Cross priests and brothers. It is unclear when the 87-year-old Joyce will return to his previ­ous residence in Corby Hall.

The number of U.S. crimes rose last year for the first time in a decade, an increase that coincided with an economic downturn that many experts say played a key role. Murder, armed robbery, rape and bur­glary all were higher in 2001, the FBI reported Monday. 
"The economy has to be the prime suspect," said James Lynch, professor at American University's Department of Justice, Law and Society. 
The crime index increased 
2.1 percent last year, the FBI said in its annual report drawn from 17,000 law enforcement agencies nation­wide. That marked the first year-to-year increase since 
1991. 

Still, the number of crimes is 18 percent lower than a decade ago and 10 percent fewer than in 1997.

There were 4,160 crimes per 100,000 people in the United States last year, up slightly from the 4,124 per 100,000 recorded the previous year.

preparation for the week in Washington. Students in the seminars were scheduled to attend a meeting of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, meet with Georgetown professor Coleman McCarthy, partici­pate in a homelessness panel and engage in various other service projects. 
Junior Chris Broughton, one of the Washington Seminar's student leaders, said students did not want to risk being stranded on a highway that might be shut down because of a sniper attack. 
''The situation altered the dynamic of the trip since we would have to make sure no student was alone at any time," said Broughton. 
Senior business major Nicole Straub, the other stu­dent leader of the Washington Seminar, trav­eled to Washington, D.C. last spring. 
"It was an incredible expe­rience," said Straub. "It's really unfortunate that the kids who signed up this semester didn't get to go." 
Parent concern was another reason students were reluc­tant to participate in the sem­inars. Megan O'Donnell, junior class president, had planned to participate in the Washington Seminar but said she seriously questioned her decision after her parents expressed concern about the sniper attacks. 
The Living the Gospel of Life Seminar, a new one­credit CSC course, focused on issues relating to the preser­vation of life. Seminar leader Bryan Haffey said students planned on meeting with members of the National Right to Life Committee, Indiana Congressional Representative Tim Roemer, the Organization for the Human Life Amendment and attending a meeting of the

The Irish entered Saturday's game as to-point underdogs, but made a slrong statement with their first offensive play of the game. After Arnaz Battle scored a 65-yard touchdown pass, he imitated the famous Seminole tomahawk chop and then waved his hands in front of his chest. 
While Battle earned him a celebration penalty and a tongue-lashing from coaches, the message was clear -the Irish weren't about to be intimidated in the most hostile road environment they've faced all sea.son. 
Yet as Battle's touchdown silenced the home crowd, 6,000 green-clad Irish fans wildly celebrated in the end zone bleachers -the most impressive show of support for an Irish road game this sea­son. 
"It's great to take a team's heart in their own stadium," Irish safety Glenn Earl said. "You heard the stadium go silent, and then you have your own section of fans up there going crazy. It's great." 
But as players walked off the field slapping high-fives with students leaning over guardrails and signed auto­graphs for jubilant fans, Willingham reminded every­one the Irish have a long way to go, and he cautioned his team about thinking about end-of-the season bowl games. 
After all, when Notre Dame beat Florida State in 1993, they lost to Boston College the next game and lost their chance at a national champi­onship. 
Fittingly, the Irish face the Eagles on Saturday with a chance to avenge a nine-year old loss. 
"Anytime you're undefeated, it's a great thing, " Willingham said. "But you've got to take it for what it is. It's an eight vic­tory, it's a great step, but if you don't get the next one, what does it mean?"

RUSSIA 
Putin leads day of mourning for deceased hostages 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW 

President Vladimir Putin led a national day of mourning Monday and pledged Hussia would not surrender to terrorist "blackmail." Hclatives and friends grieved for 118 captives who died in the siege at a Moscow theater, all but two from the paralyzing gas used to rescue I.hem. 
Using words remarkably similar to those of President Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, Putin pledged in televised comments to give the military broader powers to move against suspected terrorists and their sponsors. 
"llussia will answer with mea­su rcs adequate to the threat to Lhc Hussian Federation in all places where the terrorists, the organizers of these crimes or I.heir ideological or financial sponsors arc located," Putin said. "I emphasize -wherever they may be." 
Putin has said the theater raid was planned abroad, and the Hussian Foreign Ministry on Monday claimed, without offering evidence, that Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida terrorist organization was involved. 
Officials said 405 of the freed captives remained hospitalized, 45 of them in grave condition. Deputy-Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenko said 239 people had been released. 
Russian medical oflicials said 116 of the hostages held by Chechen rebels in a Moscow the­ater had succumbed to the gas, the exact composition of which remained a secret -even to med­ical personnel treating the victims. 
Russian authorities provided the 
U.S. Embassy with some informa­tion about the effects of the gas, but have not told them the name of the agent despite repeated reques1s, an embassy spokesman said. 
Doctors from a Western embassy have examined some of the former hostages and conclud­ed "the agent they were exposed to appears consistent with an opi­ate rather than a nerve agent," the embassy spokesman said, speaking on condition ofanonymi­ty. Opiates, including morphine and heroin, are derivatives of the opium poppy. 
In Germany, a physician treat­ing two former hostages said doc­tors would try to determine what gas was used through blood and urine tests and that it did not appear to be a known chemical weapon. 
"It remains a puzzle," said Dr. Thomas Zilker, a toxicology pro­fessor at Munich University Clinic. 
The U.S. Embassy spokesman also said American diplomats located a body believed to be that of a U.S. citizen who died during

Sniper suspects face murder, other charges in Virginia 
Associated Press 
SPOTSYLVANIA, Va. 

The teenager arrested in the sniper slay­ings may have fired the shot that killed an FBI analyst, a prosecutor said Monday as Virginia charged both suspects with crimes that could bring the death penalty. 
John Lee Malvo, 17, and John Allen Muhammad, 41, now face murder charges in both Virginia and Maryland in the three­week series of attacks that killed 10 people and wounded three. Alabama has charged them in a killing during a robbery. No deci­sion had been made yet on federal charges. 
Fairfax County prosecutor Robert Horan Jr. said evidence shows that Malvo may have fired the shot that killed Linda Franklin on Oct. 14 outside a Home Depot in Falls Church. He would not elaborate on the evidence. 
"There will be some evidence that the juvenile was the shooter just like there will be evidence that the adult was the shooter," Horan said. "But the point is, we don't know right now, and no one knows right now." 
The pair were charged Monday in Spotsylvania County with the murder of Kenneth Bridges on Oct. 11 and the Oct. 4 wounding of an unidentified woman. The murder charges were based on state law allowing capital punishment for the killing of more than one person within three years. 
In Hanover County, where an unidenti­fied man was wounded on Oct. 19, the pair were named in a variety of charges includ­ing attempted murder and terrorizing the public -the first charges brought under a post-Sept. 11 state law passed in July. 
In both counties, the charges against Malvo were made in juvenile court, but authorities said they would seek to have his case transferred to adult court. 
County, state and federal prosecutors have yet to figure out who will bring the two men to trial first. 
Spotsylvania County Sheriff Ronald Knight said Monday that Muhammad and Malva should be tried in VITginia as soon as possible. "Everybody is looking for that to happen since Virginia has the death penal­ty" for both adults and juveniles, the sheriff said. 
In Maryland, 17 -year-olds are not eligible for the death penalty. There is no death penalty in the District of Columbia, where one person was killed. 
Virginia, which allows condemned pris­oners to choose between lethal injection and the electric chair, has executed 86 peo­ple since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976, more than any other state except Texas. In the same period, Maryland has executed three people and is one of two states with a moratorium on executions. 

Montgomery County, Md., prosecutor Douglas Gansler said Sunday that he believes his state should prosecute the men first, in part because Maryland had the most slayings: six. 
A senior Justice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said discussions continued Monday on whether the federal government would bring its own charges. The overriding concern, the offi­cial said, is to ensure that a swift, certain death penalty is available if either defen­dant is convicted. 
WORLD NEWS BRIEFS 
U.S. wins key support for Iraq draft: 
The United States won key support Monday from chief weapons inspectors who told the Security Council they would be better off with a new res· olution that warns Iraq of consequences if it fails to cooperate. "I think it is desirable that Iraq understands that any lack of cooperation or violation ... will call for reactions on the part of the council," said Hans Blix, the top U.N. inspec­tor. But Blix and Mohammed El Baradei, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency in charge of nuclear inspections, questioned sev­eral details in the U.S. proposal and said it was up to the council -not them -to decide whether Iraq was in compliance. "It has been suggested that we hold war and peace in our hands (and) we decline that statement," Blix told journalists after discussing the U.S. proposal inside the Security Council. "Our job is to report." 
NATIONAL NEWS BRIEFS 

Student kills 4 in Arizona shooting: 
A student flunking out of nursing school opened fire in a class at the University of Arizona on Monday, killing two professors and a third person before apparently taking his own life, officials said. The attack sent scores of students rushing toward the doors, many of them screaming as they fled. Police went room to room looking for more victims and later called in the bomb squad to search the building. 

Trial opens in Winona Ryder case: 
Winona Ryder went on trial Monday on charges of shoplifting more than $5,500 in designer hats and other merchandise, with her lawyer depicting the actress as a victim ofoverzealous security guards. The prosecution called it a simple case of theft. "When you enter a department store with the intent of stealing, that is burglary," prosecutor Ann Rundle said in her opening statement. 

Feds want terror report kept secret: A classified document describing terror suspect Jose Padilla's multiple contacts with top al-Qaida leaders should remain sec_ret, federal prosecutors said in court papers filed Monday. Lawyers for Padilla, a former Chicago gang member accused of plotting to detonate a radioactive "dirty bomb," say 
U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey of New York should not review the classified document because prosecutors have refused to share it with them. The case involves whether Padilla should be held as an enemy combatant. In the federal filing, U.S. Attorney James Corney of New York contends that an unclassified version of the document includes most of the key information regarding Padilla's contacts with al-Qaida in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The classified version, prosecutors said, is intended to provide the judge with intelli­gence information about Padilla's status as an enemy combatant.

IN BRIEF 
Feds give OK to Citigroup purchase 
Citigroup. the nation's largest financial institution, was given approval on Monday by the Federal Reserve to purchase Golden State Bancorp, the nation's second largest savings bank. The Fed approval, which had been expected, was granted on a 7-0 vote. Citigroup announced last May that it wanted to buy San Francisco-based Golden State in an effort to increase its presence in the lucra­tive California market. 
Golden State, which operates more than 352 California Federal Bank branches in California and Nevada, also owns First Nationwide Mortgage. the nation's eighth biggest mortgage servicing company, and Auto One, which writes prime and subprime auto loans. 
Profits rise at American Express 
Profits rose strongly at American Express in the third quarter, beating analysts' estimates. 
The financial and travel company, which was hit hard last year by investment losses and fallout from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, said Monday its net income totaled $687 mil­lion, or 52 cents a share, in the July­September period, up from $298 million, or 22 cents a share. a year earlier. Results in 2001 were reduced by a $232 million restruc­turing charge as well as $65 million in Sept. 11-related expenses. 
Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call had projected earnings of 51 cents a share. 
American Express shares rose $1.12. or more than 3 percent, to close at $34.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Kenneth f. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement accom­panying the report that the results "reflect stronger revenue momentum in the card busi­nesses, which more than offset the impact of weaker equity markets on our financial ser­vices business." He said that improved cost control and risk management also had helped. 
Pfizer agrees to pay settlement

Associated Press 
NEW YORK 
Pfizer Inc. said Monday it will pay $49 million to sct­tl e Justice Department allegations that it over­charged the Medicaid pro­gram for its cholesterol­lowering drug Lipitor. 
The settlement will be split between the federal government and the states because Medicaid is a jointly funded program. 
The charges stemmed from a whistle-blower law­suit alleging that educa­tional grants by Parke­Davis to the Ochsner Health Plan in 1999 consti­tuted a rebate that low­ered the price of the drug for the Louisiana insurer. Federal law requires drug companies to offer the Medicaid program the low­est price paid by any pur­chaser.

Students protest war on Iraq in D.C. 
By NICK CHAPIN 
Cavalier Daily 
WASHINGTON, D.C. 

More than 100,000 people filled the streets of the nation's capital Saturday in a nonviolent protest against possible U.S. military action in Iraq. 
The demonstration, possi­bly the largest anti-war rally since Vietnam-era protests according to organizers and police, began in Constitution Gardens adjacent to the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial and led to a march that encircled the White House. 
"I thought it was great," said Sarah Lantzman, a member of the Charlottesville Center for Peace and Justice, which helped organize trans­portation to the event. "There was a broad range of people there, not just the people who always go to protests." 
The event was coordinated by International Act Now Stop War and End Hacism, an activist organization that worked with many other groups to advertise the rally and transport protestors to the capital. 
Before the march, throngs in Constitution Gardens lis­tened to speakers ranging from former Attorney General Hamsey Clark, to Hev. Jesse Jackson to Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney. Speakers said the President does not speak for all Americans and that a war on Iraq would be destructive and unnecessary. 
"We come from different races, from different cul­tures, from different parts of the country -we are the real America, and Americans stand for peace and rational thinking," said Rev. Al Sharpton. "You will not declare this wickedest of wars in our name." 
Banners and signs with slo­gans such as "Bronx says Peace", "Nebraskans for Peace", "Not in our name ­Lawrence. Kansas" and "Evanston, IL -neighbors for peace" announced sup­port from across the country. 
The diversity of the crowd extended beyond age and race, encompassing both fre­quent protestors and those unaccustomed to demonstra­tion. 
"I've never been to any­thing like this before," said Abigail Reid, a Minnesota resident who attends American University. ''It's amazing." 
Students from the University of Virginia also made the trip to Washington to take part. 
"I came because I wanted to stand up for my genera­tion," second-year College student David Dexter said. "War now would be preemp­tive and unnecessary, and I don't feel it's in the interest of the majority of the American public." 
Parents pushing babies in strollers, and veterans of protests of the past joined 
students and middle-aged citizens in protest. 
"We've been working for a long time in the peace move­ment, during Vietnam and the Gulf War," said Jackie Florshcim of Brooklyn, N.Y. who attended with her hus­band Henry. "We don't want to see war proliferate." 
A small group demonstrat­ed in support of action against Iraq across the street from the march, announcing "Saddam is a Murderer" over a megaphone and brandish­ing signs that read "Axis of Evil: Saddam, Farrakhan, John Muhammad" and declared Osama bin Laden 
and  Saddam  Hussein  
"Wanted."  
Many  of  the  anti-war  

demonstrators commemorat­ed Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, who died Friday in a plane crash. 
Wellstone was an ardent opponent of military action against Iraq and a longtime liberal activist. 
He was the only senator in a competitive re-election campaign to vote against the resolution giving Bush the power to launch military action unhindered by Congress. 
Numerous placards denounced war and made jabs at Bush. Some read "Regime change begins at home", "Money for Jobs Not War", "War is not an option", "Start seeing Iraqi children", "No blood for oil", "Protest is patriotic" and "Dissent is an American Virtue". 

Catholics welcome new rosary changes 
By LAURA JENSEN 
The Daily Iowan 
IOWA CITY, Iowa 
The Roman Catholic Church changed its most well-known prayer, the rosary, for the first time in centuries by announc­ing a new set of mysteries to meditate on while praying. 
Pope John Paul II announced the change in an apostolic letter on Oct. 16, declaring the period between October 2002 and October 2003 as the Year of the Rosary and adding the mysteries of light, or the luminous myster­ies, to the rosary. Church offi­cials said the changes are aimed at re-connecting Catholics to the rosary and encouraging them to pray it more often. 
"The rosary uses what we call mysteries to reflect on the important events of Christ's life," said Father Ed Fitzpatrick, the director of and campus minister at the Iowa Newman Catholic Student Center. "I think that it's a great new reflection." 
The mysteries of light include Christ's baptism, his first miracle at Cana, his pro­claiming the coming of the Kingdom of God, the transfigu­ration of Christ in front of three disciples, and the estab­lishment of the Eucharist as a sacrament. 

"I sense that the Holy Father is dismayed at the darkness in the world and wants us to pray for light with these new luminous mysteries," said Father John Stecher, a cam­pus minister at the Newman Center. 
Thomas Scheck, a UI gradu­ate student in religion, said tho addition is important because it diverts from the three standard mysteries. 
"I think it's very significant because he is promoting the use of the rosary as a devo­tional tool for Catholics and is making these mysteries more focused on Christ's earthly ministrations," he said. 
The rosary incorporates common Catholic prayers, such as the Lord's Prayer and Hail Mary. to meditate on the 15 mysteries of the life of Jesus Christ. The rosary includes the five joyful myster­ies of Christ's birth, the five sorrowful mysteries of his cru­cifixion, and the five glorious mysteries of his resurrection. The circle of beads ends in a crucifix and is divided into five sections, each consisting of 11 beads representing a mystery in one of the four different types of mysteries. 
"The pope has had a lifelong commitment to Mary and the rosary and to helping Catholics to grow in personal holiness, prayer, and close­ness to God," Scheck said.

Response to child abuse case reveals society's hypocrisy 
It took Madelyne Toogood, a 26-year­old Irish Traveler, to put Mishawaka on the map. On Sept. 13, a surveillance video at Kohl's department store cap­tured Mrs. Toogood apparently punching her four-year-old, Martha, as she put the child into her car in the parking lot. 
The national and even world media went berserk. For several days, Mrs. Toogood dominated the talk shows, on some of which she appeared in an unsuccessful effort to quiet the storm. Prosecutor Chris Toth, running for re-election, immedi­ately charged her with a felony. In line with his "tough on crime" theme, he offered "no deals" and asked the court to set a $50,000 cash bond. 
Not to be outdone, Dr. Laura Schlesinger put the phone numbers of Superior Court Judges Jerome Frese, who set Toogood's bond, and William H. Albright, who will try the felony case, on her Web site. She urged listeners to call them because she thought Toogood's bond was set too low. Their phones rang off the hook. Frese pointed out that the $5,000 cash bond he required is 10 times higher than the normal bond for such a crime. Frese, a Notre Dame Law School graduate and highly respected judge, stated the obvious, that we should not punish the defendant before she is con­victed and should try people "in the courts and not on television." 
The video, shot from behind Mrs. Toogood, showed her leaning into the car with her arms swinging for 25 seconds, but it did not show the contact of her hands with Martha or anything else. The facts turned out to be comparatively tame. Martha had no injuries. Toogood said she slapped her with her open hand and shook her by her ponytail. Toogood said that when she got into the driver's seat, Martha told her that her ponytail was messed up. Toogood said she turned around and apologized to Martha. She said later that she had no excuse for striking Martha. On Oct. 10, temporary custody of Martha was awarded to her grandmother in South Bend. On Oct. 17, Mrs. Toogood was charged in LaGrange, Ind., with shoplifting some fabric last August. That got the banner headline on page Al of the South Bend Tribune. 

This case tells us some­thing about our law and culture. Consider the contrast between the popular and official reactions to Mrs. Toogood's offense and the reality of what she could have done to Martha with impunity less than five years earlier. On the very day of Martha's birth, if delivery had been completed except that Martha's head had not yet emerged from the cervix, Toogood could have aborted Martha. 
The prosecutor, who charged Toogood with a felony when she slapped hut did not injure Martha, would have had to look the other way at the dismember­ment of Martha because Too good would have been engaged, not in a felony, but in the exercise of a specially privileged con­stitutional right. Martha, instead of being with her grandmother, would now be dead. In successfully opposing laws to outlaw that procedure, abortionists argued that such "partial-birth abor­tions" are no more cruel than ordinary surgical abortions in which the living child is dismembered inside the mother's womb. IfMadelync Toogood really had it in for Martha, her mistake was that she waited too long. 

From 1973 to 1998, 38,010,378 unborn children were legally executed by abor­tion in the United States, not counting the indeterminate but larger number killed by pills, IUDs and other early abortifa­cien1S. The number is now over 40 mil­lion. Every day of every week we legally 
execute more unborn children than the 3,021 victims of the Sept. 11 
attacks. The prevention of "child abuse" of born children is a 
major priority in law enforcement. the media 
and in popular opinion, as it should be. Yet sur­veys consistently show 
that three of four Americans favor the legalized execution of unborn children in at least some cases. A Gallup Poll last May found that 25 percent thought abortion 
should be legal "in all cases," 12 percent in most cases and 39 per­cent in a "few" cases. Only 22 percent thought it 
should be illegal in all cases. "Boobus Americanus" will 
accept the dismemberment of a living, unborn Martha but will react 
in frenzy when her mother slaps a four year-old Martha. How do you make sense out of that? Ask your theology professor. The answer might be interesting.

Notre Dame has always been a top choice for women 
I would like to correct an error in the article "Panel Recalls Early Days of Coeducation" published in the Oct. 10 edition. The article states that the first group of female undergraduates came from Saint Mary's in the fall of 1972. That is incorrect. The University admitted 375 women that fall. Of those, 250 were transfers from Saint Mary's and 125 were freshmen who were admitted directly to Notre Dame. 
As one of those freshmen, I think the distinction is impor­tant. Most of us did not even apply to Saint Mary's. Had I not been admitted to Notre Dame, I would have matriculat­ed to my second choice, Duke University. Most of my class­mates had similar opportunities. 

From the very beginning, Notre Dame women have been academically talented, motivated young women able to compete and succeed in the most rigorous academic envi­ronment. As the mother of a daughter who is a freshman at Notre Dame, I know that tradition continues today.

In an uncertain world, marathon unites runners with city and spectators 
At 5:30 a.m. on a cold, dark Sunday, my roommate Erin and I stood with friends at a train station in suburban Chicago. We had met them only moments before, yet their words of support, advice and encouragement Joanna helped convince us Mikulski that we could reach our goal, still seven hours and 26.2 
Tuesday Voice 
miles ahead of us. 
It's a rare occur­rence to be wel­comed with open arms by a group of strangers. So often many of us immedi­ately regard with suspicion those we don't know in places that we aren't familiar with. 
Over the past year and a half, events in the United States and abroad have only served to convince Americans of the need to be cautious. Recent shoot­ings in the Washington, D.C., area drove residents to doubt the safety of their local streets and stores. Perhaps most chillingly, the alleged suspects do not fit the profile of the typical killer. Hesidents are now forced to question the nature of people they thought they knew. 
As rstood at the start line of the Chicago Marathon, I was struck by the sense of community among the almost 32,000 runners, who might at another time regard the participants beside them as part of a large, impersonal city. 
The marathon had started as some­
thing very individual for me. This sum­
mer, I completed most of the training alone. Earlier in the semester, Erin organized students to a run for a local charity. In the days before the race. 
she suggested that we dedicate 
each mile to a friend or rel­
ative. However, I allowed the excitement and stress of senior year to prevent me from rais­ing much money or reflecting on what it meant to run a mile for some­one else. As race 
day 
approached, 
I thought 
mostly of the 
time and train­
ing I had invest­
ed myself. I 
remembered how 
accustomed I had 
become to the singular 
rhythm of my strides, my 
breath and my thoughts. Then, 
at the moment the race began, my sin­
gular rhythm suddenly became part of 
the movement of thousands. 
Along the course, spectators stood three, four or even 10 deep. While waving signs with the names of friends and family members, they cheered for all of the runners. Friends, who had come to support Erin and me. became 
so engrossed in cheering partici­pants at mile 20 that they missed us cross the fin­
ish line. It didn't matter. As I struggled 
toward the final stretch down Columbus 
Avenue, I had the support of 
thousands of specta­tors. I found even 
greater inspiration in the run­
ners, fighting for each stride during the last miles. They were not professional ath­letes, but people like myself, who just decided one day to pick themselves up and start running. The marathon was sport without money, advertisements, inappropriate 

behavior or personalized shoes. It was 
sport, fought for pride and common 
achievement. At the end, I wanted to 
see other runners cross the finish line 
with success just as much as I wanted 
to myself. I knew that others had the 
same feeling. 
As I crossed the finish line, a man 
beside me wrapped his arm around my 
shoulder and yelled, "We did it! We did 
it!" before disappearing among the 
crowd of runners. I walked on past the 
tables of blankets, water and food, 
knowing that the exhausted participant 
beside me, the woman who handed me 
a bottle of water, the family and 
friends who greeted me with smiles 
and I were all part of the same accom­
plishment. 
Much has brought the country 
together in the past year and a half. 
Often it has been a sense of common 
loss. The marathon brought people ­
from those local to Chicago to those 
from other countries -together for 
one day, or maybe even just one morn­
ing, through a sense of common tri­
umph. 
That's enough to make someone 
want to do it all over again.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

University owes workers respect, living wage 
Appreciate and compensate workers' contributions to society 
Employers have one right-the right to be regulated. 
That's right, as a precondition to doing business in America, every busi­ness must submit to America's regula­tions, and those businesses that don't like those regulations can move to Mexico. 
In his Oct. 18 column, "Workers have one right," John Litle says that a despi­cable $8,000 per worker, per year is all the worker "deserve[s]" because that is the exact value of everything they pro­duce. That's simply not true by any eco­nomic model. Supply and demand in the labor market accounts for workers' salaries being determined by their value in the job-market, which is independent of whatever "contribution to society" they make. 
Litle is so ignorant of the current situ­ation of the world outside of his thick haze of Cohiba cigar smoke, to see that families (yes. with wives and children) are still living on minimum wage not because they are stupid or lazy or bad workers. but because they can't even make enough "capital" to fund their next food-shopping venture to the supermarket, let alone a small business. 
And when Litle says that he will start a business "at the risk of my own finan­cial security," he's deluding himself. The fact is, his personal financial security is padded by huge amounts of corporate welfare programs. Yet, his workers will receive nothing save for tougher bank­ruptcy laws. 
In closing, there is only one type of worker that can't be regulated -and that is the robotic one. So while you loudly wait out your days till your father's company can employ robotic workers, Mr. Spacely. you should know that the miners and factory workers involved in building the cogs and sprockets for your army of robotic workers are in the meantime unionizing and demanding a living wage. 
If you took a breather from reciting your avaricious cliches you've somehow extracted from the undergraduate busi­ness education of which you boast, you would realize that the faculty and the more conscientious members of the stu­dent body are wholeheartedly encourag­ing the workers to come together and demand their right to work in an envi­ronment which is a true reflection of the dignity and appreciation that they deserve.

Low-wage workers have few options 
When I was 15, I started working as the "stock manager" at an upscale fashion store. My job entailed spend­ing four hours after school in a drea­ry basement, shelving boxes of shoes and sorting pantyhose. I was miser­able, and at $7 an hour, I lasted five months. 
I had the luxury of quitting. My par­ents provided my clothing, shelter, food, transportation and medical needs, plus the promise of a college education. All that I earned went into the bank. Had I not been so blessed, however, my subsistence would have depended on that income. and "exer­cising my right to quit," as John Litle proposed in his Oct. 18 column, "Workers have one right," would not have been an option. 
I found Litle's argument sadly mis­guided. First, he claims that if employees are unhappy with their meager wages, they should just find new work (although he later criticizes those who "move from job to job"). Yet with high unemployment rates, if a worker loses his current position, he is unlikely to quickly find another, and thus reasons that little money is better than none at all. Certainly this fear of being fired also relates to their reluctance to unionize. 

Furthermore, Litle denigrates those who are trying to support families on minimum wage. Last time I checked, domestic life wasn't strictly allocated to the fiscal elite. He asserts that loy­alty over time is rewarded, but when one is starting from an obscenely low base, a minimal increase of salary, 1 while helpful, is still insufficient to 
l

supply even one person's most basic I expenses. 
Finally, Notre Dame is not a tradi­tional business and is certainly not in the financial peril that Litle claims would justify unfair pay. 
There is a member of the custodial staff I see almost every morning as I walk to the Rockne pool. She's been up since 3:30 a.m., and when her shift ends she goes to her second job, rehabilitating wounded animals. I'd be exhausted, hungry and cranky, but she always offers me a smile and a bit of friendly conversation before faith­fully returning to her labor. Surely the University could offer her what she deserves for her services in 
return.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Petty won't back down 
By JULIE BENDER 
Assistant Scene Edi tor 
It takes a Jot for a song to get banned from the radio these days. Usually banning is the result of explicitly sexual lyrics, ref­erences to violence or harsh language. Even then, most songs escape the censors with strategically placed beeps that don't leave much to the imagination. 
But Tom Petty, the long-standing hero of classic American rock and roll, has defied the odds. 
Petty's latest single has been banned from the radio, not for damaging lyrics, but rather for his opinion. Like his rock and roll influences from the 1960s, Petty has used his latest album, The Last DJ, to take aim at corruption. 
In his supposedly highly controversial new single, "The Last DJ," Petty points a finger at the music industry and their manipulative ways of controlling radio. He sings, "There goes the last D.J. who plays what he wants to play / And says what he wants to say / Hey, hey, hey /There goes your freedom of choice / There goes the last human voice/ There goes the last D.J." 
Obviously radio doesn't like to hear the truth. Since the 1996 Telecommunications Act was passed deregulating radio, radio has become a corporate business, with dol­lar signs popping from the speakers instead of music notes. Controlling radio today are only two major companies, Clear Channel and Infinity. These two conglom­erates own over 1,200 of the country's radio stations, controlling which bands will make it big and songs will and will not be heard. 
Tom Petty has remained stalwart against this corruption of the music business. As a man who just "won't back down," Petty 
has kept his concert tickets and album prices comparatively low during a time when it's not uncom­mon to see seats at a concert sell­ing for $150 and CDs going for $20. Petty has also refused to be corpo­rately sponsored or to license his music for advertising. As a reflec­tion of his position shown by his actions. Petty describes his latest album by saying, "The La.st DJ is a story about morals, it's really about vanishing personal freedoms." 
The vast majority of songs on this album follow the same route as the first single and take aim against corporate greed, the entertainment industry and those vanishing American freedoms. In the biting song "Joe", Petty rants, "Bring me 
a girl / They're always the best I You put ·em on stage / And you have 'em undress / some angel whore / who can learn a guitar lick / hey, that's what I call music," slamming the music industry for putting lust before talent. 
In 
"Dream ville," Petty gets nos­talgic for a greener past as he sings over strings and horns, "Like it was Dreamville I A long time ago / A million miles away/ All the trees were green I In Dreamville." 
Not every song is filled with sarcasm, anger and a want for the past, however. Petty flirts ½'ith the sweet love song genre of music as well. "You and Me," is an easy paced song of constant guitar strumming that speaks optimistically of love for life with the girl you love. 
Petty breaks out the ukulele on "The Man Who Loves a Woman," creating a jaunty, playful number, which cascades into choral harmonies warning women to "stay away," for "in the mornin' he'll be far away.'' 


The song with which Petty dos es the album, reminiscent of a defiant John Lennon tune, gets right back to his intended mes­sage. Petty's voice is eerily bitter over the light gui­tar of the verses as he sings threatens that "There'll be more just like me / Who won't give in." The song fades into a dron­ing electric gui­tar, leaving the imprint of bitter­ness to linger a bit longer in the listener's head. 
The effect of the album is quite powerful. Although Petty 
may sound like a cranky old man, com­
plaining about the present state of the 
world, his words ring truth as the banning 
of "The Last DJ" demonstrates. Power to 
Tom Petty, a man who can stand his 
ground. He says it right when he sings, 
"You may turn off my microphone / But 
you can't steal / What you can't feel." Ain't it the truth

ALBUM REVIEW 
Mayer strikes gold on re-release 
By EMILY TUMBRINK 
Scene Music Critic 
Fortunately for his fans, John Mayer has rereleased Inside Wants Out, his first solo album. Originally released independently in Atlanta in 1999, about a year after Mayer left Boston's Berklee College of Music, Inside Wants Out helped create a significant local following for Mayer. Those lucky enough to have gotten their hands on this gem the first time around know exact· ly why this second chance is such a won­derful thing. Inside Wants Out is a solid album from start to finish. John Mayer at his best 
Inside Wants Out, an eight-song EP, con­sists of solo acoustic renditions of Mayer's songs as well as a few recorded with a full band. Four songs that were later re­worked for Room for Squares, Mayer's major label debut, are included on this previous album. By releasing the earlier versions of these familiar songs, the hit "No Such Thing," "Back to You," "My Stupid Mouth," and "Neon," John Mayer offers lis­teners a glimpse into his evolution as a musician. 
Inside Wants Out contains stripped-down versions of these songs that are played at a slightly slower pace allowing Mayer's voice to take center-stage. The simplified melodies allow little distraction from his poignant lyrics that envelop the listener and become an even more integral part of the recording. Also, Mayer's talent as a gui tarist, which is often lost amid the flashi-

INSIDE WANTS OUT John Mayer 
Sony Records 


ness of Room for Squares, is clearly present on "Neon" and other tracks included on Inside Wants Out. 
Before the release of Room for Squares and the subsequent re­release of Inside Wants Out, Mayer said, "People won't really under­stand what Inside Wants Out was until this next record [Room for Squares) comes out. I think we're making a record that's gonna be the true fulfillment of what the songs were supposed to be in the first place." 

Although he considers the tracks on Room for Squares to be what he originally had in mind for the songs, Photo courtesy ol Rolling Stone.com 
John Mayer treats fans on his re-release. oh
the versions included on Inside 
Wants Out better serve to showcase Mayer as an outstanding individual song writer and musician. 
Inside Wants Out also contains four songs that were not released on Room for Squares. In fact, "Comfortable," which was not included on Room for Squares, is arguably the best song on Inside Wants Out. It possesses endearingly sincere lyrics accompanied by stirring guitar and violin melodies that form a beautiful ballad of lin­gering feelings for a lost love. Other notable tracks are the energetic "Love Soon" and the hidden-track, "Quiet," which lives up to its namesake and is perhaps the most soothing of all the songs on Inside Wants Out. 
Mayer's Inside Wants Out is the perfect choice for anyone who enjoys relaxing music with honest lyrics and simple guitar melodies. While his major label release at times feels over-produced, Inside Wants Out contains none of the pop twistings that characterize Room for Squares. 


Mayer's vocals and guitar rilTs are strong enough to stand on their own, making Inside Wants Out a necessary addition to any John Mayer fan's collection and a good start for any music-lover who has not yet experienced the captivating talent of this young man.

Irish capitalize on Seminole turnovers in 34-24 victory 
By KATIE McVOY Associate Spores Editor 
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. 
Seminoles head coach 

Bobby Bowden isn't sure how 
it happened. 
On Saturday, while his team 

was busy passing for 325 
yards, Bowden unintentional­
ly joined a club -a club of 
Notre Dame opponents who 
have fallen prey to the 8-0 
Irish while they thought they 
had everything going for 
them. Notre Dame took home 
the 34-24 victory against the 
Seminoles. Florida State took

the big plays. 
At the end of the first half, 

the score was tied at 10, and 
it looked as if the game was 
going to end the way Bowden 
thought it would -with one 
team kicking a last-second 
lield goal. 
That's when the Irish 

signed the Seminoles up with 
a performance that Bowden 
said left the Seminoles "bum­
fuzzled." 
With 5:26 left in the third quarter, Notre Dame took its first shot at its victim. Courtney Watson intercepted Seminoles quarterback Chris Rix to set up a 35-yard Nicholas Setta field goal for three of the 17 points Notre Dame would score in a 2:26 span.

Standing between a pair of seven­foot walls lining the tunnel exit to Doak Campbell Stadium, Bill Diedrick kept his gaze straight ahead. 
He didn't look 
up, but if he had, he would have seen Irish fans inebriated with the program's biggest win since a 1993 victory against Florida State. 
He didn't look 

around, but if he Andrew Soukup had. he would have seen BCS bowl officials Irish eyes light up at 
Insight
the prospect of Notre Dame playing in one of college football's four premier bowl games. 
All the Irish offensive coordinator could see was Carlyle Holiday jogging off the field. 
For a moment, Holiday and Diedrick embraced. the artist con­gratulating the brush for painting an image of success. 
Nothing else mattered. Not even the sight of Fiesta Bowl blazers rubbing shoulders with Notre Dame suits. 
"I don't see them," Diedrick flatly said after the game. "Not at all." 
Apparently. the walls of Doak Campbell Stadium weren't the only things contributing to Diedrick's tun­nel vision. 
He belongs to a small group that includes the rest of the coaching staff and the players. Together, they claimed they are focusing on Notre Dame's next opponent and don't pay attention to the sudden interest BCS bowls are showing in Notre Dame. 
But after Saturday's win. the walls preventing the Irish from looking ahead toward the end of the season started crumbling. 
Even as Diedrick hugged Holiday and maintained the Irish had to keep their focus on the field, University President Father Edward Malloy eagerly chatted with a Fiesta Bowl rep just a few yards away. Seconds earlier, athletic director Kevin White pumped hands with another repre­sentative of the BCS championship game. 
Listening to Irish players say they don't get any respect at the same time as University officials were hob­nobbing with the BCS elite was almost comical. 
The Irish had a point before. After demolishing Florida State, they no longer do. 
Two weeks ago at Air Force, some­one asked Courtney Watson if the Irish deserved to be ranked in the BCS. "Why not?" the linebacker answered. "Nobody asks Miami that question." 
All season long, Notre Dame legiti­mately played the no-respect card. They watched Lee Corso don Falcon and Seminole headgear and Vegas oddsmakers put the Irish as under­dogs in seven of their eight games. Bulletin boards aren't built big enough for all the negative things analysts said about the Irish week after week. 
Yet the Irish harnessed the dic;re­spect, channeling it toward a single purpose. Sure, they wanted to win, but after each game, players took thinly veiled shots at the so-called experts who predicted the Irish to lose. 
Saturday's victory took care of that respect problem. [t also created another one. Now Notre Dame has to adjust to being the favorite. 
Suddenly, there are few huge tests looming on the horizon. Saturday's game against Boston College is just another game on the schedule, not a major obstacle the Irish have to hur­dle. Barring a major collapse. Notre Dame is all but guaranteed a BCS berth. 

While the coaches and players might preach the cliched one-game­at-a-time philosophy, they're proba­bly the only ones who can stay focused on Boston College. Malloy and White all but giggled at the sight of dollar signs dancing in front of their faces. Students who only dared to whisper the letters B, C and Sin dark corners before now hop on the Internet to check plane tickets to Arizona. 
In the midst of this hurricane of enthusiasm stand the players, who spent the first eight games of the sea­son fighting to earn everyone's respect. 
They'll spend the next four trying to keep it. 
"Anytime you're undefeated. it's a great thing," Tyrone Willingham said. "But you've got to take it for what it is. It's an eighth victory, it's a great step, but ifyou don't get the next one, what does it mean?" 
The last time Notre Dame beat Florida State. Sports Illustrated ran a giant cover with an Irish lineman cel­ebrating and "We Did It!'' in giant yel­low letters. All the undefeated Irish had to do to win the national champi­onship. the experts said, would be to take care of Boston College. 
The hardest part of the season is over. That's what they said in 1993, back when the Irish had respect. back when they were the favorites.

Holiday earns hug as he embraces role

On Notre Dame's first offensive play from scrimmage Saturday, Irish quar­terback Carlyle Holiday faked a hand­off to tailback Ryan Grant. rolled right and hit nanker Arnaz Battle in stride 40 yards downfield. 
The speedy receiver outran a Seminole defender for a 65-yard touchdown. 
It was a perfectly executed play action pass. And i1. was just the begin­ning of another solid outing for the junior signal caller. 
lloliday finished the afternoon 13­for-2 l for 185 yards. but the most important statistics were his two touchdown passes with no intercep­tions. 
"I think he played an excellent game with tho conditions and a hostile envi­ronment," Batlle said. "Florida State has a very athletic defense -very aggressive -and Carlyle stayed in there and put the ball on the money. Ile made some great plays." 
After the game Saturday, Irish offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick uropped part of the emotionless exte­rior that Irish head coach Tyrone Willingham likes so many of his coaches and players to display. As Holiday ran off the tleld, Diedrick met the young quarterback at one of the stadium tunnels with a big hug. 
"I hug [Holiday] like that after every win," Diedrick joked. ''I'm glad it's a 
win."

ALBUM REVIEW 
Hives bring hope for rock 
By C. SPENCER BEGGS 
Scene Ediror 
If the Bush Doctrine had been in place a decade ago, America would have stormed the beaches of Sweden when they sent Ace of Base lo terrorize our radio waves with crappy music. Despite any past quar­rels our country may have had with the Lion of the North in the past, the latest Swedish audile offering may be a peace­maker even though Abba may truly be an unforgivable offense. 
The Hives' latest, Veni Vidi Vicious, is an album that plays the way a rock album is meant to play: raw. The band's sound is hard to define, but it might suffice to say 
that they're new garage rock. The Hives are what would happen if The Beatles had their genes spliced with The Rolling Stones and the resulting band went partying with The Sex Pistols from 1983-1986. And with names like Nicholaus Arson, Chris Dangerous and Vigilante Carlstroem, their punk rock for­bearers would be proud. 
Veni Vidi Vicious is a great party album. Each song moves into the next seamlessly. Though some tracks off the album like "Hate To Say I Told You So" and "Main Offender" got a bit of airtime on radio stations over the summer, the album really doesn't have any sin­gle-worthy material. The value of Veni Vidi Vicious comes more from the way it works as a compilation of 
solid punk material. And while its fairly undeniable that The Hives rock out on their

instruments, their lyrics are a bit basic. For example, "Hate To Say I Told You So" plays on basic teenage rebellion ala The Clash: "Do what I want cause I can and if I don't / because I wanna be ignored by the stiff and the bored because I'm gonna." But then again, that's punk for you. It might be a good thing that the vocal tracks are buried so far beneath the hard rocking guitars. 
Veni Vidi Vicious was actually released in 2000 by Warner Brothers, but the album didn't really catch on until early this year. Their popularity was cemented when they performed on MTV's Video Music Award 2002. But the band hasn't been an overnight success by any means. 

In fact the five members have been play­ing together since they were 13. 
Along with The Strokes, The Vines and The White Stripes, The Hives appear to be on the cutting edge of a rock revival. Though perhaps their native English speaking counterparts will be better equipped to lead the charge in the U.S., the fact that The Hives have produced a solid, fun album should be enough to keep them around for at least another crack at the charts.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Chambers shows Australian flavor 
By LIAM FARRELL Scene Music Cricic 
Australia is not really associated with American roots music, but native Kasey Chambers has won the admiration of such artists as Lucinda Williams and Steve Earle for her brand of country rock. lier debut The Captain was criti­cally acclaimed, and her follow-up Barricades and Brickwalls mines similar 
territory. Like most legitimate country artists today, Chambers wears her influences on her sleeve. Her voice sounds like a young, heartbroken Emmylou Harris and her melodies recall the Jayhawks and more roots oriented artists such as Alison Krauss. One of the strongest 
songs on the album is Chambers' cover of the Gram Parsons' "Still Feeling Blue", showing country music dexterity amid other rock songs like the opening title track. 
The problem with creating such an influenced record, however, is that origi­nality can be hard to find. 
Kasey Chambers' voice is probably the best part of the album, injecting emo­tion into even lack­1uster lyrics. She always sounds sec­onds away from breaking into an angry punk song, and her duet with Paul Kelly of the punk band the Living End on the beautiful "I Still Pray" strength­ens that connection. 
There is good atti­tude in the songs, a certain amount of genuine earnestness with a healthy amount of sorrow that improves the texture of her work. 
Her lyrics lack great diversity and origi­nality, how­e v e r . Although the genre she plays in is usually composed with simple lyrics of pain or hap­piness, she 
o f t e n repeats metaphors and images 
Barricades and Brickwalls 

Warner Bros. Records 



to death, losing some of the impact of later songs because they seem to be mir­ror images of earlier tracks. 
Her musicianship tries its hardest to drag the lyrics up to its level, but in the end she sounds too much like Jewel or one of the woman singer-songwriter clones that she is obviously too talent­ed to be grouped with. When listen­ing to songs like "On a Bad Day" or "Nullarbor Song", there is no doubt to the listener that there is genuine sadness, but one just wishes that it could be expressed more poetically. 
But the album is saved by repeated listens. On first glance many songs are less than break­through, but the construction of the album comes through upon con­tinued attempts at making sense of Kasey Chambers. lier potential is undeniable and there are Dashes of musical excellence here. She should not yet be grouped in with artists such as Aimee Mann or 

Beth Orton simply because her album does not compare to the Magnolia Soundtrack or Daybreaker. But there are good songs here, and it's a good sec­ond effort.

McNabb leads Eagles to win over the Giants 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA 
Donovan McNabb didn't need to use his arm. His legs were enough to beat the New York Giants. 
McNabb ran for 111 yards and one touchdown, and Philadelphia had a remark­able 299 yards rushing as the Eagles beat the New York Giants 17 -3 in the final Monday night game at Veterans Stadium. 
It was Philadelphia's third straight victory over the Giants after losing nine in a row to them and gave the Eagles (5-2) a two-game lead over New York (3-4) and Washington (3-4) in the NFC East. 
McNabb had just 137 yards passing, but the Eagles domi­na.ted the Giants on the ground. Duce Staley had 126 yards on 24 carries, and David Akers kicked three field goals in the first half in which the Eagles had the ball for 20:31. 
Philadelphia hadn't had two 100-yard rushers since Oct. 8, 1995, when Ricky Watters and Charlie Garner did it against Washington. The Eagles had seven runs of 10 yards or more. The Giants had allowed just 11 such runs entering the game. 
McNabb put the game away with a 40-yard TD run 4:30 into the fourth quarter that gave the Eagles a 15-3 lead and McNabb connected with Chad Lewis on a 2-point con­version. His run capped a nine-play. 99-yard drive that took 3:33. 
On third-and-11, McNabb dropped back to pass, stepped up in the pocket, avoided a tackle at his feet by Cornelius Griffin, started to scramble, cut to his left. streaked down the sideline, jumped over a blocker at the 5 and went into the end zone. 
It was McNabb's second 100-yard performance in three games. 
He had 100 yards on 12 car­ries in a 28-25 loss to Jacksonville on Oct. 6. 
The Eagles took advantage of the absence of defensive tackle Keith Hamilton, who went down with a season-end­ing Achilles' tendon injury two weeks ago, by running at his replacement, Lance Legree, and right defensive end Kenny Holmes. They had 195 yards rushing in the first half, but couldn't get into the end zone.

Two weeks ago 
Oregon had a perfect 
record, national cham­

No. 8 ranking in the 
Sendwich Index. With 
consecutive losses to 
Arizona State and USC, 
the Ducks dropped as 
many games in eight 
days as they had previ­
ously lost in over two 
years. 
Oregon fell from the 
ranks of the unbeaten 
with a stunning defeat 
at home against 
Arizona State. The Sun 
Devils trailed 21-0 
early in the second 
quarter. but passed 
their way back into the 
game and an eventual 45­42 victory. 
One week later, USC easi lv beat the Ducks 44-3 3. 'l~his game was not nearly as close as the final score might indicate as Oregon tacked on two meaningless late touchdowns. Former all-American recruit, turned disappointment, turned superstar once again Carson Palmer threw for 448 yards and 5 touch­downs in leading the Trojans to a victory. 
With the double whammy, Oregon dropped out of the top 25 and is currently ranked No. 31. USC and Arizona State both moved up significantly, as they currently rank No. 6 and No. 13, respectively. 
Fiesta Bowl Scramble 
Is Notre Dame really the best team in the country? Sadly. we may never know. The Irish currently rank No. 3 in the Bowl Championship Series standings behind Oklahoma and Miami. If both the Sooners and Hurricanes remain unde­feated, Notre Dame will probably not move into the top two, a requirement for making the national cham­pionship game. 
The winner of Miami and Virginia Tech on Dec. 7 is nearly guaranteed a No. 1 BCS rank following that game, with the victor receiving a needed boost in the computer rankings and quality wins departments. 
Oklahoma may decide its season this weekend against No. 20 Colorado. Should Oklahoma win, their only remaining pre-bowl challenge would be a likely rematch with Colorado in the Big 12 championship game.

Wolllen successful, men lose in Colorado 
By JOE HETTLER 
Associare Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame mens and womens swimming teams trav­eled to Colorado over fall break with the same goal -win their first dual meet of the season. 
However, only the womens team fulfilled their goal. 
Notre Dame's women defeat­ed Colorado State 162-100 Oct. 25, while the men lost to Air Force 178-120. 
Womens head coach Bailey Weathers was happy with his team's results. 
"We were pleased overall with their performance," Weathers said. "We've been training at altitude and the meet was done at altitude, so that was a challenge for us. In terms of comparing our times that we did last year at the same time when we were at Florida, they were very similar. The times were very competi­tive [ with those in Florida last season]. So we're pleased with who where we are." 
Lisa Garcia and Laurie Musgrave stood out in Weathers' mind. Garcia won the 100-and 200-meter butter­fly events. while Musgrave won the 200 breaststroke. 
The Irish also got contribu­tions from Kelli Burton, Danielle Hulick and Heidi Hendrick. 
Meanwhile, the mens team had a solid meet, but fell short to the Falcons for their first dual meet loss of the season. A pair of freshmen, Patrick Davis and Tyler Grenda, led the Irish, with Davis posting wins in the 500 and 1000 freestyle and Grenda winning the 200 breaststroke. 
Joe Miller won the three­meter dive to lead the mens divers, while teammate Tong Xie finished third in the same event. 
The Notre Dame women have two home meets this week against Purdue on Wednesday and Indiana on Friday. 
Weathers said the competi­tion in Colorado should help the team in this week's meets. 
"I think we hoped to be able to beat [Colorado State] but [the meet] tells us a lot of what we need to do this week against Indiana and Purdue," 
he said.  
The Irish men  are off until  
Nov.  8  when  they  host  
Michigan State.

Pinella accepts Tampa position 
Associated Press 
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. 
For Lou Piniella, the opportu­nity to work near where he grew up was just part of the appeal of becoming the manag­er of the struggling Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
Piniella was introduced after finalizing a four-year, $13 mil­lion contract that makes him the second-highest paid man­ager in the majors. He is confi­dent he can help transform the team with baseball's youngest and least-expensive roster into a championship contender. 
'Tm not a baseball savior. I'm not a baseball guru. I believe in no shortcuts to suc­cess," the 59-year-old manager said after slipping on a No. 14 Devil Rays home jersey during a news conference at Tropicana Field. 
"I believe in hard work. I believe in dedication. I believe in taking a tremendous amount of pride in the uniform that you wear in the city that you repre­sent," he added, tugging on the front of his jersey. "That's what we're going to try to instill here. I'm looking forward to the challenge." 
Piniella asked out of the final year on his contract with the Seattle Mariners, so he could seek employment closer to his home in Tampa. The Mariners agreed to allow the Devil Rays to negotiate with the manager after the Devil Rays met their demand for All-Star outfielder Randy Winn as compensation. 

Tampa Bay also received minor league shortstop Antonio Perez in the deal. 
The two-time AL manager of the year went 840-711 in 10 seasons at Seattle. The Mariners won a league-record 116 games in 2001 and won three AL West titles and made four playoff appearances under him. 
Overall. Piniella is 1,319­
1.135 in 16 seasons of manag­ing in the majors. He led the Cincinnati Reds to a World Series championship in 1990 and also served a successful stint as manager of the New York Yankees from 1986-88. 
In Tampa Bay, Piniella inher­its a team that has lost 206 games the past two seasons ­most in the majors. The Devil Rays tied the Detroit Tigers for the worst record in the AL (55­
106) this year and never won more than 69 games under previous managers Larry Rothschild and Hal McRae. 
McRae was fired last month and moved into a position as an assistant to general manager Chuck LaMar. Six other candi­dates -none with big league managerial experience -were interviewed as potential replacements, however the team focused solely on Piniella once the Mariners agreed to let him out of the final year of his contract in Seattle. 
The New York Mets were interested, too, but were unable to agree with Seattle on com­pensation. Once it became apparent that Piniella was going accept the Devil Rays' offer. the Mets quickly closed on a four-year contract with Art Howe. 
Piniella reportedly will earn about $2.5 million in 2003. roughly the same that he would have had he remained in Seattle. The remainder of the contract calls for about $3 mil­lion in 2004, $3.5 million in 2005 and $4 million in 2006, plus he could earn up to $3 mil­lion in incentives based on vic­tories. 
In addition to being able to live year-round in the same city with his family and elderly par­ents, the ultra-competitive Piniella also found the chal­lenge of taking over one of the league's worst teams appeal­ing. 
Seattle was struggling before he began to turn the Mariners around in 1993. He sees the same potential in Tampa Bay, which trimmed its payroll to a major league-low $34 million this season.

Elevation lifts Grant, Irish above Falcons 
By KATIE McVOY 
Associate Sports Writer 
t\t his weekly press conference before their game against Air Force on Oct. 19, Irish coach Tyrone Willingham had joked that his team would run faster because they had trained at sea level. For running back Ryan Grant, that didn't turn out to be such a joke. 
The sophomore recorded 190 yards as the Irish swept past the Falcons 21-14. 
"Did I run faster?" Grant asked 
when Willingham suggested in the post-game press conference that the thin air wasn't a factor. "I ran raster because they were trying to tackle me." 
With the oITensive line opening holes, Grant hatl a career-best running game and scored an 18­yard touchdown for the Irish. 
"The coaches did a great job culling plays and the line did a !;real job opening holes," Grant said. "I could pick where I want­ed to run." 
Before the game began, ana­lysts assumed it would be Air Force that would rack up the rushing yards -the Falcons led the nation in rushing, averaging 33tJ yards a game with their triple option attack. But the Irish defense shut down the option with little trouble, holding the ralcons to only 161 offensive yards. The Irish wcren 't sur­prised at their ability to shut down the option. 
"I knew it from the get-go," Irish cornerback Shane Walton said. "They haven't seen a defense as physical and as fast as our defense. I think we proved that tonight, we can play the pass, we can play the option, any kind of option we can play." 
The Irish offense was equally unsurprised by their success. Quarterback Carlyle Holiday, who ran for negative yards against Pittsburgh, picked up 86 rushing yards, 52 more than the Falcons' Chance Harridge, including two touchdowns. 
With 1:12 left in the first quar­ter and Air Poree up by seven, Holiday broke out of the pocket and raced 53 yards for a touch­down. 
"We were trying to get the ball to one of our over routes and it didn't show up because he got rushed out of the pocket." Willingham said. ''Ile displayed his athletic ability, a couple of missed tackles. guys he made miss and got in the end zone." 
Holiday also scored the final Irish touchdown of the game, going one yard into the end zone late in the third quarter. 
In the second half, it wasn't just the run game that the Irish found successful. Holiday began connecting on passes consistent­ly and Arnaz Battle began receiving consistently. Battle was the receiver on all eight passes that Holiday completed during the game. 
"I think the thing we said last week about Arnaz is that he's slowly, and that's not being dis­respectful to Arnaz, but that he's slowly learning the nuances of being a receiver and you see that each week come up a little bit more," Willingham said. 
Air Force could not put a drive together. The option attack was unsuccessful. Harridge, who had been leading the Falcons in rushing, was effectively shut down and the pitch wasn't work­ing. 
Air Force took the usual Irish approach to scoring -making plays on defense. The Falcons

took advantage of two Irish fum­bles to score their touchdowns. With three minutes to play in the first quarter, Holiday fumbled and Marchel Graddy returned the fumble 21 yards for the Air Force touchdown. 
With the Irish leading by seven at the half, the Air Force defense forced another fumble that kept them in the game. On the kick off beginning the second half -0f the play, Vontez Duff fumbled the ball on the return, setting up the 16-yard offensive drive by the Falcons. 
"I just think those things hap­pen," Willingham said. " ... 

Vontez was turned and the guy caught the ball. On the other one, Carlyle was hit on the blind side and it popped loose. Sometimes those things happen."

Irish split conference games over fall break 
By CHRIS FEDERlCO 
Sports Editor 
It was an up-and-down week for the Notre Dame hockey team over fall break. The Irish began their week off from classes with a pair of victories over CCHA opponent Western Michigan, 4-2 and 8-5 in a home-home series with the Broncos. 
Some of that momentum came to a halt. however, with a pair of conference losses at home to Ferris State last weekend, 5-2 and 4-1. 
In Notre Dame's first home game of the season against Western Michigan two weeks ago, the front line of seniors Michael Chin and Connor Dunlop and junior Rob Globke carried the Irish to victory. The trio had three of the team's four goals and con­tributed five assists in the con­test. 
For the second half of the series, the teams traveled to Kalamazoo. Mich.. and the Notre Dame offense caught fire for eight goals to escape with the 8-5 victory in the offensive battle. 
Junior center Aaron Gill had his first career hat trick for the Irish, as Notre Dame net­ted three goals in the first and never looked back, getting four more in the second peri­od and tacking on its final score in the third. 
The Irish took advantage of Bronco mistakes, converting four of seven power plays, while Western Michigan scored on only one of its three power play chances. 
As a result of the wins. the Irish earned their first spot in the national rankings since the 1998-99 season, being ranked 11th by the Inside College Hockey.com poll and 15th in the USAToday/American Hockey Magazine poll. 
The Irish suffered their first loss of the season Friday night in the Joyce Center at the hands of CCHA rival Ferris State. The two teams entered the final period of play knot­ted at 1-1. but the Bulldogs used four third period goals to pull away 5-2. 
Globke put the Irish on the

While the trip to Hawaii provided a break from the regularities of Big East action, getting wins makes the Irish happy. The main­land was much kinder to the Irish than the middle of the Pacific Ocean. 
After dropping two games against Hawaii, the Irish rebounded by defeating Pittsburgh and West Virginia at the Joyce Center over the weekend. 
"You always want to do that [win after tough losses]. Even though we played at a high level in Hawaii, you want to come back and win both of those matches," Notre Dame volleyball coach Debbie Brown said.

Irish finish eighth at adidas fall invite 
ByANDY TROEGER 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame womens golf team had many positives and few negatives to take from their play at the adidas Fall Invitational. The Irish fired a total of 932, good for eighth place in the 11-tearn event held Oct 21-22 at the Dye Course at the PGA Village in Florida. 
For the second consecutive weekend the Irish played two great rounds and one poor round, although this time the poor round came at the begin­ning of the event. The Irish shot 320 in the first round placing them in a distant eighth place. Despite firing rounds of 305 and 307, they were unable to catch any of the teams ahead of them. 
"I feel like it is one step clos­er to where we're trying to go," junior Shannon Byrne said. "We started rough but we bounced back, and I think that's a sign of where our team is headed. Now we're having two good rounds instead of one." 
Byrne became the fourth Irish golfer in five events to lead the team by finishing in a tie for 17th. Bryne's total of 230 (76-79-75) was a career best. 
She was joined in the top 20 by freshman Sarah Bassett, who overcame a poor first round to climb into the top 20 for the event at 231 (86-71­74). Bassett's 71 was her career low and the best round on the team this fall. 
Fellow freshman Katie Brophy turned in another solid performance for the Irish, fin~ ishing at 235 (81-75-79) in a tie for 27th. Following Brophy was senior Terri Taibl, who tied for 38th at 241 (82-80­79). To round out the {rish effort, Suzie Hayes fired a 245 (81-82-82) to tie for 40th and Karen Lotta tied for 57th with a 256 (85-86-85). 
Baylor won the event with a score of 899. edging Arkansas by one shot, while Randi Gauthier of North Texas was the medalist with a 1-under­par total of 215. Her final round 72 placed her one shot better than Hanna tying goal with 4:14 left in the match, 
With overtime a near-cer­tainty, the Irish were whistled for a handball in the penalty area with less than 30 seconds left. 
Curtin's shot beat Irish goalie Greg Tait, and the Hoyas' late goal was too much for the Irish to overcome with such little time left. 
Despite the loss, the Irish clinched a berth in the eight­team Big East postseason tour­nament Sunday, as ninth-place Syracuse Jost to Virginia Tech, 1-0. The Orangemcm currently have 10 points with one con­ference game remaining -not enough points to overtake the Irish, who, with a 5-3-1 record in the Big East, have 16 points. 
Contact Bryan Kronk at bkronk@nd.edu 
Svenningson of Baylor and Amanda Mc Curdy of Arkansas. Svenningson began the day tied for the lead, but fired a 73, while McCurdy's 68, the low round of the day, also put her one short. 
Notre Dame, which hosted the event, also had three golfers compete as individuals. Freshman Lauren Gebauer tied for 33rd at 237 (80-78­79), while Rebecca Rogers fired 248 (89-78-81) to finish 44th. Lauren Barbir rounded out the Irish squad in tying for 48th at 251 (84-84-83). 
"We've had a lot of mental training and preparation," Byrne said. "I've been strug­gling but it's starting to come together for me, and I think it is starting to come together for a lot of us. We're looking forward to times where we're in it from the beginning." 
The Irish finish their fall schedule on Nov. 4-5 when they play in the Pine Needles Invitational at Pinehurst, N.C.

Making a run toward the postseason 


By ANDY TROEGER 
Sports W1iter 
The Notre Dame womens soc­cer team concluded its regular season Sunday with a 1-0 over­time win at Boston College to cap a strong finish that strengthened the team's c.hanc.es of qualifying for the NCAA Tournament. 
Aner losing four out of five in early October to fall to 7 -6. the Irish won four of their last five games, including the last two, to finish 11-7. The Irish, now ranked 17th, will probably qualify for the NCAA Tournament despite not quali­fying for the Big East Tournament. They also stand an outside chance of getting to play the first two rounds at home based on a strong region­al ranking. 
After Notre Dame and Boston College played to a scoreless tie in regulation, junior forward Amy Warner initiated the sequence with a run down the left side. She passed the ball to fellow forward Amanda Guertin whose goal gave the Irish the win. 
With the goal, Guertin set a Notre Dame record with her third career overtime game­winner. She had previously been tied with Warner and 1996 national player of the year Cindy Daws.

"I think the strong finish puts us in a pretty good position for the post season," junior Randi Scheller said. "The past few weeks we've gotten healthy and have been playing well. Hopefully the wins will put us where we want to be." 
Notre Dame also split a pair of home games over the past week, falling to BYU 3-2 before defeating Syracuse 6-0. 
The Cougars scored on a rare late-minute penalty kick, with Aleisha Cramer-Rose convert­ing the attempt. to win the game. 
The Irish had taken an early lead on a goal by Candace Chapman, but the Cougars struck back with two goals in the first half to take a 2-1 lead at intermission. Katie Thorlakson tied the game at 2 early in the second half on a high shot that eluded BYU goal­keeper Amanda Gott. 
The Irish rebounded against Syracuse, scoring early and often in the 6-0 rout. Scheller started the scoring three min­utes into the game heading in a corner kick from Amanda Guertin. Moments later Scheller struck again for her second goal of the game on an assist from Thorlakson for the 2-0 lead. Mary Boland headed in another Guertin corner kick for the third goal of the game later

Up-and-down Irish win two, lose one

The Notre Dame mens soc­cer team made huge strides towards earning a home match in the quarterfinal round of the Big East postseason tour­nament over fall break by win­ning two of three conference games over fall break. 
After last weekend's round of Big East play, the Irish stand in third place with one conference game remaining. 
The Irish kicked off the week with a 3-1 upset of No. 5 Connecticut on Oct. 20. The game started out poorly for the Irish, as the Huskies domi­nated the Irish on both sides of the ball 
The Huskies notched the first goal of the game with 21 min­utes, 41 seconds left in the first half. Midfielder Anthony Curtis hit a pass that found Andres Rota, who booted a shot past Irish goalie Chris Sawyer to give the Huskies a 1-0 lead. 
The second half marked an offensive awakening for the Irish, and it showed early in the period. Greg Martin opened the scoring for the Irish on a penalty kick after Chad Riley was taken down by Curtis inside the penalty area just 1:49 into the period. 
Martin scored his second goal of the game less than seven minutes later, as he took possession of a loose ball off a throw-in from Notre Dame defender Kevin Goldthwaite. Martin's chip shot just soared over Connecticut goalie Adam

Wednesday's match with the Wildcats, and Notre Dame extended its winning streak to five games with a 5-0 victory. 
Five different players scored for the Irish, and all five goals were scored in the first half. Riley opened the scoring with his fourth goal of the season at the 22:20 mark of the first half. 
Just over seven minutes later, midfielder Justin Detter received a cross pass from Goldthwaite. Detter's shot evaded Villanova goalie Sean Teasdale to give the Irish a 2-0 lead. 
The lead became 3-0 less 

than a minute later, as Goldthwaite added his second assist of the game in setting up a goal by Braun. Braun's goal -his eighth of the season ­tied him for ninth all-time in Notre Dame history with 33 goals for his career. 
A goal by Devon Prescod put the Irish ahead 4-0. Just 1:31 later, the Irish extended their lead to five goals when Justin Ratcliffe beat Teasdale to close out the scoring for the Irish. 
After a poor performance by their goalie in the first half, the Wildcats switched goalies in the second half, replacing Teasdale with Craig Bald, who held the Irish scoreless in the second half.

Both the Notre Dame mens and womens cross country teams, competing at the Asics/Pacesetter Pre­National meet on Oct. 19, got a taste of the competition they will face at this year's national championships. 
For the Irish women. that taste was rather sweet, but it was just a taste. 
For the Irish men, it was a little more bitter than sweet. 
With top runner Todd Mobley struggling with an injury, the men finished in 11th place. Freshman Tim Moore led the squad with his 22nd place finish, but that wasn't enough to put the Irish within reach of the top teams. Moore ran 24 min­utes, 30 seconds in the eight-kilometer race. 
"It's definitely tougher not having [Mobley] there in the workouts," Moore said. "He's a good leader so it's good to have him around." 
Meanwhile, the 13th­ranked female runners took fourth place in a field that featured the top programs in the nation, including No. 2 Stanford which ran away with the team title. 
While the Irish were pleased with the victory, coach Tim Connelly believes his team has more to give. 
"It was a pretty good effort," Connelly said. "That's as well as we've run yet this year. I still don't think that's everything we have, but I was pleased with finishing fourth." 
Sophomore Lauren King, who clocked in at 20:24 after the six-kilometer race, led the Irish women with her sixth-place finish. It was King's third race of the sea­son and her third top ten fin­ish this year. King was backed up by freshman Molly Huddle, who finished in seventh place with a time of 20:25.9. 
Huddle, running her sec­ond race of the season, and King were able to run together the entire race, using each other to defeat their opponents. Despite
