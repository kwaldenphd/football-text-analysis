Congress awaits Carter~ plan 
W ASIDNGTON [AP] · Congress, which last week gave President Carter the tempory authority he sought to deal with the current natural gas crisis, now is looking toward the White House for a sign on how to cope with long-range shortages. 
Lawmakers from gas-producing states claim that Carter has little choice but to recommend lifting federal price controls from inter­state natural gas. They predict Congress will have to buy such a proposal this time, after fighting back deregulation measures for the past two decades. 
Those who support price controls are less certain. They say there is no guarantee the administration will recommend deregulation and might propose modifying rather than ditching the price limits. 
Both camps are waiting to see what is in the long-range energy bill Carter plans to submit in April before making their moves. 
The emergency legislation Con­gress approved, and Carter signed last week gives the President the authority through April 30 to divert gas to areas where supplies are the scarcest because of the unusually fierce winter. It also frees some gas from federal price controls through July 31. 
It was never portrayed as any­thing but a temporary measure to meet urgent needs, either by the White House or its congressional 
sponsors. And House and Senate 
leaders were able tv move it 
through quickly only becuase of the 
severity of the crisis and assuran­
ces from the White House that 
Carter's energy bill would offer 
some kind of solution to the natural 
gas problem. 
ln the Senate, where the move for permanent decontrol is strong­est, members from gas-producing states also extracted a pledge trom Senate leaders that deregulation would be debated on the Senate floor this spring, regardless of whether Carter inclu4es it in his plan.

Quinlan, terminally ill discussed 
by Bub Laoghenry Senior Staff Reporter 

The ethical, legal and medical aspects of the treatment of the terminally ill patient and that person's right to live were discuss­ed Friday at a symposium center­ing around the Karen Anne Quinlan case. 
Various speakers presented their opinions on when treatment should be ceased in a case involving a· terminally ill patient and whose decision it is. Each noted that the major concerns in this question are the determination of the patient's condition and the type of means· used, specifically ordinary or extra­ordinary. 
Dr. Julius Korein, professor of nuerology at the New York Univer­sity Medical Center, noted that technology and information con­cerning brain death have raised new questions regarding how to define life and death. 
He stated that the usual defini­tion of death is the cessation of life functions and that this is not necessarily valid now. 
Fr. John Connery, professor of theology at Loyola University of Chicago, stated that the disconti­nuance of treatment ultimately depended upon whether there was a reasonable hope for reviving spontaneous life functions. 
He continued saying, ''There is a 'imit to this obligation (the doctor's to fight for the patient's life)." Once the patient's condition is 
Oppos_ition to Gandhi strong 
NEW DELHI* India (AP) -In a massive display of antigovern-· ment sentiment, 200,000 persons roared approval yesterday as a diverse group of opposition lead­ers urged the ouster of. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in March's parliamentary elections. 
The orderly but enthusiastic crowd cheered wildly as Jagjivan Ram, leader of a rebellion in the ruling Congress, party, and Jayap­rakash Narayan, a disciple of independence leader Mohandas Gandhi, denounced the prime min­ister's eleven-year reign and her 19-month emergency suspension of Indian democracy. 
"There were more people in Indian jails during the emergency than in British jails before indepen­dence," said the ailing 74-year old Narayan, who was imprisoned for the first five months of the emer­gency and released when both his kidneys failed. 
"I don't know \Vi1at crime these thousands of people had commit­ted, but they were put into jail without trial," he said. "Many are still there." 
The large turnout further bol­stered spirits of the opposition, which initially felt it ha~L little determined, a distinction between ordinary and extraordinary means of sustaining life must be made, he stated. 
Connery then noted that a theo­logian and physician see the means of sustaining life as relating to different things. 
According to Connery, the theo­logian is speaking in reference to the patient's comfort when con­sidering ordinary or extraordinary means, while the doctor looks at extraordinary as anything not common to medical procedure. 
He concluded that there is no such thing as a right to die if one may omit ordinary means under ordinary circumstances. However, one does have a right to die in the sense of extraordinary means, he stated. "No doctor has the right to impose such means," he said. 
Connery suggested the term "right to die" be limited to the "right not to use extraordinary means." . 
However, Dennis J. Horan, Chicago lawyer and chairman of the American Bar Associations Right to Live/Right to Die Commit­tee, sees the physician as having a contractual relationship with the patient. He stated that the physician has an ethical obligation and must make responsive action when necessary. 
In the Quinlan case, one of the main arguments was the patient's right to privacy. Paul W. Arm­strong, Quinlan family attorney and Notre Dame Law School grad-
chance of defeating Mrs. Gandhi when she announced the elections three weeks ago. 
Yesterday's rally was considered a symbolic victory for the opposi­tion because it was twice as large as a public meeting addressed by Mrs. Gandhi on the same site Saturday. 
Mrs. Gandhi's rally ended pre­maturely, after large groups of a restive, unresponsive crowd of 100,000 walked out before she finished speaking. 
Mrs. Gandhi, shaken by Ram's resignation from her cabinet four days ago, received another setback over the weekend when former President V.V.Giri endorsed an opposition demand for an end to the continuing suspension of the 
· civil liberties. 
1 Giri, elected as constitutional head of state in 1969 with Mrs. Gandhi's strong support, said the lifting of the emergency would prove that she "stands equal 
for the constitutional and demo­cratic traditions." 
Mrs. Gandhi repeatedly has refused to lift the emergency, but ht;;r government has announced a uate, said, ''The court concluded that in Karen's circumstances, the degree of bodily invasion was so great and her prognosis so dim that her right to privacy clearly out­weighed any arguable state inter­est." 
In the New Jersey Supreme Court's opinion, "This right (to privacy) is broad enough to encom­pass a patient's decision to decline medical treatment under certain circumstances.'' 
Jonathan Brant, assistant attor­ney general of Massachusetts, said that the most important principle which comes from cases of this type ''is that decisions concerning the terminally ill must be based upon a consideration of the real interests of the patient." 
"The determination of the best interests of the patient must be determined by the medical evi­dence principly concerning proba­bility of recovery, potential side­effects, and the nature of the treatment," Brant clarified. 
He further stated that the stand­ards for court decision-making require access to all relevant medical evidence concerning the efficacy of the proposed procedure, the potential deleterious effects and the probabilities of real bene­fits for the patient. 
Horan stated that there is reallv no dispute over the fact that it some time treatment of the termin­ally ill patient must be stopped. He further noted though that it must

Mardi Gras 'Hollywood' carnival· opens Friday 
by Jim Hershey Staff Reporter 

Construction of booths for the 1977 Mardi Gras is well underway after a week of work at Stepan Center, according to chairman Don Bishop. The carnival opens this Friday, Feb. 11. 
Don Bishop and Coordinator Allan O'Gorman met last April to start planning for this year's Mardi Gras. In October halls and organi­zations from Notre Dame and St. Mary's submitted plans for booths drawn up by their own architects. Lisa Becker and Dan Pichler, Mardi Gras architects, reviewed these plans. Bishop noted that the groups erected the booth structures this year on the first day of construc­tion. Also, the construction crews have cut down on wood wasteage. 
He said, "We have been really strict on design because we want the groups to stay close to the 'Hollywood' theme." 
"When you are picking a theme, you have to make .sure that there will be an abundance of ideas, so that there will be room for different projects," Bishop continued· "One of the reasons that we chose tt.e 'Hollywood' theme was that Holly­wood is a show atmosphere, which Mardi Gras is supposed to be." 
The title of the Morrissey-Holy Cross (SMC) booth is "Around the World in Eighty Days." The booth represents the flying ballon in the movie. The workers explained that they dismissed the idea at first becaused they thought that it would be impossible. However, they figured out a way to build it. 
The Grace-LeMans booth feat­ures the space buggy of the movie, "2001: Space Odyssey." The main feature of the booth is the angular facade. The crew plans to paint the bu with alumnium colored

paint. They also plan to add some engines to the wood construction. 
Holy Cross (Notre Dame) has CQnstruct_edthe Empire State Buil­ding with King Kong atop. 
Farley's booth title is "A Street­car Named Desire." The streetcar follows the pattern of ..a San Francisco streetcar. They complet­ed the structure on the first day with 15 people. 
Students from Flanner are buil­ding a haunted house booth. They are building monsters as part of the project. During Mardi Gras some Flanner students will dress up as spooks and scare people. Flanner's crap table will be the first crap table featured at Mardi Gras in several years. 
The Keenan booth is a saloon that will include swinging doors, poker tables, and lamps above the tables. The construction also in-dudes a traditional saloon balcony. . 
Introduced into the carnival games this year will be Backgam­mon, mice races, and a Wheel of Fortune whose prizes will be stuffed animals. Poker and black­jack will be featured as usual. Bishop talked about the financial aspects of the Mardi Gras. "We bought a fully-equiped Cutlass Supreme, which was more expen­sive than last year's Nova. But we knew we would get the money because we knew that we were going to work hard. We have cut down on frills, and we bought machines (popcorn and Coke) instead of renting. This will help assets to be very good next year." 
He also said that although they were spending more money on entertainment this year, ticket sales have already exceeded last year's number. 
Coordinator Allan O'Gorman said that the Mardi Gras will have television coverage from several channels.

FTC Commissioner Dixon apologizes for ethnic slur 
WASHINGTON [AP]  Federal Trade Commissioner Paul Rand Dixon, buffeted with futher de­mands for his resignation, reversed himself and sent a personal apo­logy to Ralph Nader late yesterday for his ethnic slur against the consumer advocate. 
Dixon earlier had vowed he would not apologize directly to Nad,er for calling him "a son of a bitch and a dirty Arab," though he did express general regret over offense taken by others. 
Meanwhile yesterday, the Na­tional Organization for Women and the American Jewish Congress joined the growing list of organiza­tions calling for Dixon to step down, and the flap over the commissioner penetrated the FTC's official business. 
Nader, who is of Lebanese descent, confirmed that he re­ceived yesterday evening a hand­delivered letter from Dixon in. which he acknowledged that at a trade gather Jan. 17 "I made a derogatory reference to your ethic background." 
''As I have previously stated, I deeply regret having made this remark and I apologize for it," Dixon wrote.

Mass to celebrate 'Respect for life' 
Fr. Willian Lewers, the Indiana Holy Cross Provincial, will concel­ebrate a "Respect for Life" Mass with other campus priests in Sacred Heart Church on Wednesday at 5 p.m., according to Rick LaSiavia, chairman of the ND-St. Mary's Pro-Life Group. 
"It is our hope that the ND-St. Mary's community will join toge­ther on Wednesday to celebrate God's gift of life," said LaSalvia. 
The theme of the Mass will be "reverence for life" LaSalvia said the ·~tragic destruction of the unborn was at the rate of 1.5 million a year," and noted that "there were more abortions than live births in Washington D.C. last year." 
"That is why it is so important that we as members of a Catholic university bear witness to the sanctity of all human life," he said.

Black Arts Festival opens 
by Bob Vuettonl Staff Reporter 

Gary Cooper, an Alabama state representative and a Viet-Nam war hero, opened the Black Cultural Arts Festival last night by asking blacks to work. within the present political system. 
"There is only one reason blacks have been kept out of politics so long," Cooper said, "because that's where the power is. You must become involved in politics." 
Cooper's speech, before a near capacity crowd in the Memorial Library Auditorium, preceeded the appearance of Imamu Baraka. Baraka went on to adocate black participation in a violent overthrow of the government. During a question and answer period, Coop­er responded to Baraka. 
"If we use any other political system," Cooper said, "we won't have to worry about our poor people. We won't have to worry about them because they would be dead." 
Speaking on the topic, "An Inquiry into Black America,'' Coop­er said that black culture is underdeveloped in some areas. 
"Blacks must strive to gain economic power and economic independence," Cooper empha­sized. "Until we develop economic independence, we'll have a difficult time educating our children." Cooper said blacks must develop a strong moral fiber in order to have the discipline to make reforms. He added that blacks should get more involved in their communities. 
"We've got time," Cooper said, ''to do everything in the world except give of ourselves. The fact that we've been poor and oppres­sed for so long is not any excuse to get involved in our communities." 
Cooper graduated from Notre Dame in 1958 with a Bachelor's degree in Finance. He particularly mentioned Fr. Hesburgh as a man he admired.

ago,"  said  Cooper.  "It  was  
interesting.  Socially,  it  was  un­ 
believeable.  All the black students  

on campus could fit into my one room." 
A Marine for 12 years, Cooper was the first black man in the history of the corps to lead an infantry company into combat. While in Viet-Nam Cooper received a Bronze Star, two Purple Hearts, and a Vietnamese Cross of Gallat­ry. As a representative from Alabama, Cooper is a member of 

the Advisory Committee to the U.S. 
Comission on Civil Rights. 

Cooper was introduced by Don Hill, a member of the festival committee. Another introductory speaker was Fr. James Burtchaell, Universitv Provost. 
Burtch~ell introduced Cooper as a personal friend. He said the Black Cultural Arts Festival was one of the most important events on the Universitv calendar. 
"We need to invite and welcome far more black students than we have here now," Burtchaell added.

Worth their Weight in Gold 
Since early 1970, when the Beatles officially went their separate ways, every­one from promotion moguls and exploit­ative, fast-buck Freddies, to the consis­tently clamorous and adoring general public, has bribed, pleaded, threatened, and cajoled those four prosperous lads into some sort of fantastic, apocalyptic reunion, all to little avail. 
Meanwhile, McCartney, Lennon, Harri­son and Starr have stuttered, faltered, experimented and, on occasion, come with some of the best music of their careers, as Beatles or otherwise. Case in point is the spattering of recent releases by Paul. George, and Ringo (John remaining in absentia toward the re-ordering of legal and familial affair~). 
The major difficulty inherent in Paul McCartney's music had, up to the release of Wings Over America, only been heightened by the composer's post-Beatle involvements and self-indulgences; his work suffered from terminal attacks of light-headed cuteness. Granted, the Beat­les main stock and trade was in the giddy ambivalence of young love and their constant repetition of the delights and turmoils of the young lover. Yet, their handling of a dangerously mundane, silly topic was so masterful, controlled, and musically correct that they single-handedly established a genre of entertainment expansive enough to serve as the bedrock of a generation of second-rate imitators. 
Ironically. Paul McCartney soon became a victim of that genre after the dissolution of the Fab Four. He attempted to carry on the classy traditions of his former partners, but without the balancing effect of Len­non's generally crude, rough realism. Paul's music soon deteriorated into a tedious string of sugar-coated, shallow aphorisms. Excellent melodies and themes were sl'bmerged in the endless, formless redundancies of unquestioned love. 
Wings Over America goes a long way towards overcoming this weakness, pri­marily because it strips McCartney of the controlled calculation of the studio and presents the raw talent, the imperfect genius of his music. The strongest cuts on this live collection showcase the former Beatie either on piano or backed by soft acoustics. "Lady Madonna" boasts a fresh spirit with McCartney's vigorous vocal as do "Magneto and Titanium Man," "I've Just Seen a Face" and the McCartney theme song, "Yesterday." The playing and harmony of Wings members Denny Laine and Jimmy McCullough make the fast-paced numbers work; both guitarists shine on standard Wings numbers such as "Jet," "Band on the Run," and "Call Me Back Again." The highlight of the set, however, is McCartney's re-interpretation of "Maybe I'm Amazed" and "The Long and Winding Road,'' two of his best love songs which never suffered from sweet­ness. When we hear McCartney live, warts and all, the sweetness becomes sublime. 
George Harrison, "the quiet Beatie," can't seem to decide whether he is an ardent Sri Krishna promo man or simply a struggling, insecure songwriter in search of public acclaim. Throughout the pendu­lous course of his solo career, he has attempted to merge these conflicting personas indentity, much to his discredit. If not totally resolved, this identity crisis is at least circumvented in his latest offering, the remarkably brilliant 33YJ. 
33 'h picks up where All Things Must Pass left off; that is, it innures the listener to the anathema of Harrison's spiritual hard-sell by imbueing it with tasteful, stylish rock. Harrison's melodies and progressions have never been better, and his singing voice, prone to whining and wheezing in past trials, comes through here as soundly as any instrument. In a bid for commercial appeal, the sitars have been replaced by Tom Scott's horn section, most notably on the light-weight numbers ("Pure Smokey," "It's What You Value") which are appreciably better as a result. 
The best cuts are outstanding in that the eccentricity of Harrison's lyrical approach is masked--or, in some cases, made appealing--by the force of the melody and musicianship of the tune. Both "Cracker­box Palace," a weak metaphor for the nasty material world, and "This Song," a weaker defense of Harrison's recent loss in a plagiarism case, benefit from excellent production work to the extent that they are transform~d into competent MOR tracks. 
Though the silent Beatie continues to bully his audience lyrically, he has finally found a way to soothe them musically; he puts it succinctly: "Left alone with my heart/ I'm learning how to love you." 
Ringo Starr is the Jerry Ford of popular music: he doesn't really accomplish very much, but he's an agreeable guy and everybody likes him. He has wisely chosen, in his latest album Rotogravure, to remain competent and fun and uncontroversial; as a result his music stays that important one step ahead of contrived mediocrity. 
It's difficult not to be charmed by Ringo's blundering amiability; songs as contrived and nostalgic as "A Dose of Rock'n'Roll" and the traditional "Hey Baby" could succeed only when enlivened by trumpets, saxophones, backround clap­ping and most importantly, the reckless abandon of Ringo's Wlliling. 
Finally, those countless millions clamor­ing for a Beatles reunion need look no further than Rotogravure for an end to their quest: each of the former Beatles has contributed at least one number to the album in reverence for a partnership that has not died, but simply and naturally expanded. As Paul puts it in "Pure Gold": 
We're holding something special from 
the past 

And do still believe the stories we've 
been told 

All the things she brings me worth their 
weight in gold. 

Revivalism on Campus 
By Fr. Bill Toohey 
"Nothing gives a man as great a sense of superiority as does the handling of another's conscience!" That one sentence is the only explanatory note one finds in the Jerome Biblical Commentary for Jesus' denunciation of the Pharisees and lawyers, when he says, 'Alas for you because you load men with burdens" (Lk 11, 46). 
That gospel admonition provides an appropriate introduction for a discussion of a matter that has reached somewhat critical proportions. More and more students have been speaking to us lately about their being victimized by the high-pressure tactics of certain fundamen­talist~ and evangelists who roam the campus. Several students have com­plained of being badgered into one or another activity sponsored by various groups, only to experience a blatant form of proselytizing and hard-sell harangue. 
Several students have told us how they were pestered until they responded to the invitation to "come to a gathering." They reported that the major emphasis was on their sinfulness, with an inordinate concen­tration on sexual matters; and with a heavy dose of the worst vestiges of pre-Vatican-II spirituality. Others have spoken of their experiences with proselytizers who were extremely conservative and even reaction­ary; who employ the Bible with an uncritical literal interpretation, almost as though it were ammunition to secure a spiritual beachhead. 
One student told about his experiences with a group that so controlled the members that they had to have approval from the "authorities" before dating a person with the intention of marrying. Other students state that one movement active on campus even goes so far as to regulate the classes students are permitted to take; what they can read; the religious services they are allowed to attend; the priests they can talk to. 
It is one thing to recognize that it is proper for Notre Dame to be an "open campus," one that does not bar from the­premises individuals and movements the university does not officially endorse or sponsor. It is quite another matter, however, when numerous students get themselves thoroughly messed up in the· process; in other words, when young persons suffer acute psychological stress and/or serious spiritual harm. 
Some of us are becoming quite dis­tressed at the "fall out," that is, those students who come to our attention because they have been hurt through-these contacts. Unfortunately. many students attracted to these t:ealots are precisely those least cap:~:,Je of handling the experience: the emotionally immature, tht· potentially scrupu:ouf.. those with a sen&i-

GOOD CHRISTIAN GALS REJOICE [sing to the tune of Good Christian Men Rejoice] 

Good Christian Gals Rejoice Cut your hair and change your voice Hear the Church's new decree With appropriate surgery You may now be priests You may now be priests! 
A priest must always be a man Like Jesus, says the Vatican Or the laymen might begin To think that God is feminine And we know She's not And we know She's not! 
This rule would cause embarassment If carried to its full extent, All priests over thirty-three Would needs be slaughtered ritually. It would make a mess, It would make a ness. 
And so, as has always been the norm, The Church, in true archaic form, Continues to discriminate, And keep the sexes separate. Christ was born for this? Christ was born for this?

mexico 

Mexico is dark skinned people with dirt under their finger nails. It's a man with one arm and no legs playing a harmonica on the street to earn his living. It's people giving you wrong directions instead of just telling you they don't know where the place is at. It's having your bus break down halfwayto your destination, receiving only half the price of your ticket back (because after all they did take you halfway) and then having to thumb back. It's meeting many new people who are willing to help and who want to be friends. 
Mexico is riding the metro at rush hour and getting off at Pi no Suarez -not because you wanted to but because everyone else wanted to, (or on the other hand it's missing your stop because you couldn't get off.) It's buying a "typically Mexican curiosity" at what you thought was a good price and then having a friend ask, "Did you mean to get ripped off?" It's struggling over a paper which could easily be written in English but must be in Spanish. It's a bunch of gringos on an all-night bus trip making a lot of noise. It's finally being confident that your Spanish is good enough that just about anyone will understand you. 
Mexico is rushing to catch the metro before it closes, haggling over prices is a market, going out to eat every night, catching the 8:30 a.m. school bus, and laughing at all the stupid things you've done. 
Mexico is 20 people who go from hardly knowing each other to becoming very good friends. It's frustrating, adventurous, traumatic, different, and fantastic. It's the best choice I've ever made.

Features 
tive psyche or hyper-active imagination. 
Several rectors have spoken of students of theirs who had to leave school because, as one priest put it, "they flipped out as the result of their involvement in one of those groups." It seems it's time to speak some words of caution about these occur­rences and the fact that there appears to be a close relationship in all of this to "revivalism." 
It might be well to review the basic characteristics of the phenemonon. The revivalist convicts you of sin and then offers you salvation; reminds you to "accept the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved"; warns you that you are miserable because you do not obey the will of God. "Revivalism," William James writes in his classic study, The Varieties of Religious Experience, has always assumed that only its own type of religious experience can be perfect; you must first be nailed on the cross of natural dispair and agony, and then in the twinkling of an eye be miraculously released." 
Frequently, the revivalist will use the "mortification proces£," a procedure suc­cessfully used to modify behavior in prisons, monasteries, mental hospitals and, in my own experitnces, ~·brine Corps boot camps. A person's sdf-image, suppcrted by home and work environ­
meJits. is subjected to all-out attack. The person is stripped of such support, and. 
when sufficiently desperate for "salva­tion," is offered a way of rescue, replete with rigid rules and ample stimulation for any potential obsessive dependency. 
Erving Goffman, in his book, Asylums: Essays on the. Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates, illuminates the psycho-dynamics of the mortification process: "Upon entrance, a person is immediately stripped of support for his self-image. In the accurate language of some of our oldest institutions, he begins a series of abasements, degradations, humi­liations, and profanations of self. His self ­is systematically, if often unintentionally, mortified. He begins some radical shifts in his moral career, a career composed of ttie progressive changes that occur in the beliefs that he has concerning himself and significant others.'' 
Demonology is another possible ingre­dient in revivalism. The more a person is threatened with fantasies of diabolic presence and activity. the more he will cling to one who can exorcise him; the more he will entrust himself to one who promises. "Rely on me; I 'discern evil spirits and drive them out." 
It seems we do indeed need an exorcism. But the practices l'vl' been describing strongly suggest that if there is any demon to be exorcised on this eampus. its name is revivalism.

St. Mary's starts new Summer Job Program 
by Marti Hogan St. Mary's Editor 
While most students were vaca­tioning during Christmas break, Karen O'Neil, director of Career Development Center (CDC) and two student interns were recruiting . businesses to participate in the CDC Summer Job Program at Saint Mary's. 
"We sent out letters to 400 companies and 1800 parents announcing the Summer Job Program and asking them to create summer job positions," O'Neil said. 
Park Jefferson Apartments in South Bend was the first company to respond to the request. Several interviews were conducted Tues­day for the position of rental agent. 
"It would be a good experience for anyone interested in real estate as a career," O'Neil explained. 
Several other companies have also expressed interest in the program, including U.S. Steel. "These are companies that have never come to St. Mary's before," she said. 
"These companies are offering jobs like starting as trainees," said Gretchen Obringer, student CDC intern and co-coordinator of the program. "For example, if you got 

East, Midwest suffer from cold 
The nation's storm-ravaged East and Midwest continued yesterday to shake off the ravages of one of the worst winters in history. 
'New York's upstate region, hit hardest by the unusually severe weather, was bypassed by a week­end blizzard and got a boost with the promise of some needed natur­al gas from Canada and the West Coast. 
The weekend's winter storm was far over the Atlantic Ocean yester­day but the clear skies that trailed were accompanied by more bitter cold. 
Sunday morning temperatures were below zero in much of the Midwest -15 below at Lafayette, Ind., 12 below at Indianapolis, 11 below at Columbus, Ohio. 
With the latest rush of cold air came new efforts to combat the winter. It was "Heat Sunday" in Rhode Island for example, with churchgoers chipping in to help heat the homes of their less fortunate neighbors. 
Non-essential driving was still banned yesterday in Buffalo, N.Y., the snow-chilled city on the shore of Lake Erie as federal, state and local crews kept digging through the snow and ice, opening up more streets and roads. 
President Carter Saturday de­clared nine counties in western and northern New York State disaster areas, qualifying them for federal assistance. 
So far, Carter has declared disaster areas in Maryland, Vir­ginia and Florida, as well as New York, making them eligible for such benefits as unemployment aid, emergency food stamps, and low-interest loans for businessmen.

St. Mary's Career Development Center (CDC) has initiated a new program this semester to assist freshmen and sophomores in career planning. 
The program, Introduction to Career Planning, is co-sponsored by Cindy Jones, senior CDC intern and Bill Schmul, business depart­ment chairman. 
An· R.A. for freshmen, Jones noted that many were confused about the relation between their majors and desired careers. "I felt there was a need for something new to help them plan for the future," Jones explained. 
According to Jones, too many students choose a major for the wrong reasons. "You should go into a major if yot like it, not because you think it's the only way you'll find a job," she said. 
The program will introduce to students all the career alternatives available in a specific major. "Many students go into business because they feel it's the only way to get a job," Jones said, "but any major can be successful." Jones added that job experience as well as skills and hobbies can be developed outside of a major. 
Introduction to Career Planning will consist of discussions led by Jones on how to choose a major, what to look for in a summer job and how to develop skills and interests. Jones will encourage students to follow up the discus­sions by attending the CDC work­shops and using the CDC library. 
Karen O'Neil, CDC director, stressed the importance of the program. "We want to aid them 
now so they won't be in the panic a 
lot of seniors are in," O'Neil said. 
. Students will be informed by 
their R.A.'s of the date and time of 
the discussion for their section.

Irish unbeaten string reaches ten 
by Ted Roblllllon Sports Writer 

It was another routine weekend for the Notre Dame hockey team. 
The Irish traveled to Minneap­olis, where the weather was consid­erably better than in South Bend, and met a Minnesota Gopher team whose play belied their seventh­place standing. In an outstanding hockey series, Notre Dame skated away with three points by virtue of a 3-2 win Friday rught and a 3-3 tie Saturday night. 
However, the weekend proved somewhat frustrating for the Irish. Despite increasing their unbeaten streak in the WCHA to 10 games, first-place Wisconsin gained a­nother point on the Irish after their weekend sweep of Michigan. Notre Dame now trails the Badgers by 7 points and leads third-place Denver by 6 points. 
For all the great efforts put forth by the Irish skaters this weekend, a freshman goalie named Paul Jos­wiak did his best to ruin the stay for Notre Dame. Joswiak's weekend performances totaled 78 saves in 84 shots. 
For the third time fu the last month, Don Fairholm played ~he role of the hero as he culminated a three-goal Irish comeback to notch the game-winner with just 1:33 
remaining in Friday's contest. 
After an early goal by Notre Dame's Terry Fairholm was dis­allowed because Fairlolm had dir­ected the puck in with his skate, Minnesota struck twice for an early 2-0 lead. 
The first Gopher goal came as a result of a 3-on-2 break engineered by Mark Lambert. Ken Yackel passed to Bruce Lind who fired from point-blank range. Len 
Moher made the stop but Lambert tipped home the rebound . · 

The second gval came on the most controversial play of the . series. Tom Vannelli dJ;illed a wrist shot from 20 feet away towards the top of the net. The puck bounced off either the crossbar of the metal 
.in the back of the net. While the red light flashed and the Gopher players celebrated, referee Medo Martinello signaled no goal and a faceoff in the Irish end. 
After five minutes of vehement 
protests from the Minnesota play­
ers, the referees reversed their 
decision and awarded Vannelli the 
goal. 
Down two goals, the Irish re­fused to panic and continued to apply pressure through forecheck­ing. Yet, J oswiak kept them off the board until midway through the second period, and it took a two-man power play for the Irish to score. Greg Meridith did the honors, tipping home a Brian Walsh shot from the face-off circle. 
Two minutes later, Ted Weltzin 
evened the score by drilling a low 
bullet from the slot through Jos­
wiak's pads. Don Jackson had 
made the play by centering the 
puck perfectly at the blue line for 
Weltzin. It was an especially 
pleasing goalfor Ted who played 
on the same line in high school with 
highly-recruited Minnesota fresh­
man Rob McClanahan. 
When the third period began, Notre Dame completely bottled up the Minnesota offense with their effective forechecking style. 
"We use a closest-man rotating style of forechecking,'' commented Notre Dame Coach Lefty Smith. "Our closest man penetrates and tries to force a pass, then our other two men react accordingly." 
It took almost the entire third 
period to break through Joswiak, 
but Don Fairholm finally scored

in 11. The win was the fourth straight just 90 seconds before overtime. Again, Don Jackson made the play by keeping the puck in the Gopher zone. Jackson fed Clark Hamilton in the slot. Clark slid the puck to Fairholm, who capitalized on Jos­wiak's weakness of kicking re­bounds directly back to the shooter. 

Saturday night, the Irish got on the board first. Walsh, the WCHA's leading scorer, took a drop pass from Hamilton on the power play, and beat Joswiak from the faceoff circle. However, fresh­man Tim Harrer evened the score just 13 seconds later on a centering pass from Jim O'Neil. 
Minnesota Coach Brooks skated 9 freshmen Saturday night due to injuries and a suspension levied against Lambert and defenseman Jim Boo for curfew violations Friday night. Through constant shuffling, Brooks was able to keep fresh players on the ice constantly which provided for a better all­around effort by the Gophers. 
For the second time in as many nights, the score was 2-2 going into the third period. This time, the Irish got an early break as Walsh collected his second goal of the night and 28th of the season as he tipped in a shot by Dick Howe. 
It seemed as if the Irish would be 
able to protect the lead but a 
holding call against Paul Clarke 
midway through the period gave 
the Gophers an opportunity to 
establish play in the Notre Dame 
zone. After Clarke stepped back on 
the ice, Peter Hayek sent a shot 
towards the net from the point. 

Before it reached Peterson, O'Neil 
changed ts course for his first goal 
at Minnesota. 

Later in the period, the Gophers came within inches of winning when Vannelli hit the post from close range. 
In overtime, each team had some 
good scoring opportunities but Joswiak and Peterson rose to the occasion with outstanding saves. For the game, Joswiak had 43 ·saves and Peterson, in perhaps his 
finest game of the year, had 33. 

For Smith, the series was a 
welcome change from the festiv­
ities of the previous weekend in 
Colorado Springs. 

"It was an excellent college 
hockey series," Smith said. 

'There was good skating, good passing, excellent goaltending, and a lot of hitting, yet it was very cleanly played." 
Notre Dame's chase of Wiscon­sin continues this weekend when the Fighting Sioux of North Dakota visit the A.C.C. Game time both nights is 7:30p.m.

Winning streak reaches 54 
by Paul Stevenson Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame fencing team extended their winning streak to 54 as they won three more matches, downing Milwaukee Area Tee~ni­cal College, University of Minne­sota. and Wisconsin Parkside by the identical scores 23-4. 
The foil specialists fenced their way to wins of 8-1, 9-0 and 8-1 over MATC, Minnesota, and WP re­spectively. "The foil team is fencing like l thought they were capable of in the beginning of the season," Head Coach Mike De­Cicco commented. "The team is a very experienced and talented group." 
Pat Gerard is now 15-0 on the season in foil. Gerard's string of ten consecutive S-0 bouts was ended this weekend when the first touch was scored against him in eleven matches. 
The Irish sabre team performed equally as well, as they swash­buckled their way to a 6-3 victory over MATC. 7-i over Minncsoti. and 8-1 over WP. 
Once again this year, sophomore Mike Sullivan is leading the way for the sabre experts. Sullivan is 20-0 on the season and has easily handled every opponent. 
The sophomore will face a critical . test this weekend when he meets Wayne State's NCAA champion Urri Rabinowitz. The two special­ists split in regular competition last season, giving Sullivan his only college defeat. 
The Notre Dame epee specialists fenced superbly as they fought their way to a 9-0 win over MATC, and 7-2 victories over both Minne­sota and WP. 
This year finds Captain Tim Glass leading the epee team once more. Glass' record stands at 17-2.

Friday afternoon, the ACC pit was the scene for the Irish women's victory against St. Joseph's Com­munity College, their third in a row this semester. 
Both teams started off slowly, and after ten minutes the score was only 6-4, Notre Dame. But after trading baskets. St. Joe's went on a quick hot streak and sank three in a row with an added foul shot to take the lead 13-8. 
Quickly, the Irish turned the momentum around and burned the nets for six straight goals behind the offensive engineering of Carol Lally and Carola Cummings. 
Momentum seemed to shift away from the Irish again until Ann Berges hit an incredible turn­around jumper from the corner, right before the close of the half to regain the Irish spark and give them an 8 point lead. 
In the end, Notre Dame ran the lead up to 15 points, closing the game at 57-43.
