Afghan troops battle guerillas as Soviets leave 
Associated Press 
ALONG THE SALANG HIGHWAY, Afghanistan­
Afghan troops and Moslem guerillas fought for control of this highway Sunday as the So­viet army moved out what may have been the last convoy to leave Afghanistan by truck. 
A convoy of Soviet soldiers driving armored personnel carriers and trucks loaded with missile launchers and other equipment cruised through a Soviet bunker checkpoint as helicopter gunships hovered nearby, offering cover. 
Two ground-attack jets streaked overhead and then disappeared behind the snow­covered mountains just beyond the hills surrounding the capi­tal of Kabul. 
"This could be the last con­voy," said a Soviet diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He refused to elab­orate. 
In Pakistan, Western diplomats speaking on condi­tion of anonymity said that in the past week an average of 18 Soviet transport planes a day had landed and taken off from number reported the previous week. 

The aircraft deliver arms and food to the beleaguered city, then depart with hundreds of Soviet soldiers, the diplomats said. 
The Soviets sent about 115,000 troops into Afghanistan in December 1979 to prop up a Marxist government that seized power in a coup the pre­vious year. 
The Red Army began pulling out eight months ago under an agreement sponsored by the United Nations to end the nine­year intervention. 
Soviet diplomats in Kabul say the remaining 15,000 to 20,000 troops could be gone by the end of the week, about 10 days before the U.N. deadline. The remaining soldiers ap­parently were to leave on transport planes. 
The guerillas, known as Mujahedeen, are not a party to the U.N. agreement and have vowed to overthrow the Soviet­backed government of Presi­dent Najib once the Soviets are gone.

JPW dinner seating arrangements changed due to inconsistent forms 
By JOHN O'BRIEN Staff Reporter 

Due to inconsistencies in seating requests, all previously held seating arrangements for the Junior Parents' Weekend dinner on February 18 are void. 
Juniors must now go to the Center for Continuing Educa­tion on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week from 2 p.m. to 10 
p.m. to arrange their seating. Students will be required to bring the IDs of all of the stu­dents with whom they wish to sit. 

"There were many inconsis­tencies on the seating requests, and this was the only way to resolve them," said Jennifer Amestoy, JPW dinner chairper­son. 
According to Amestoy, prob­lems arose when names of stu­dents were submitted on severaldifferentrequestforms that did not have identical seating arrangements. 
"We thought that we could resolve the problems over the phone, but apparently even then the students didn't know who they wanted to sit with," Amestoy said. . 
"Many students said they didn't care," she said, "but we didn't feel that it was up to us to decide who they should sit with." 
Amestoy said that requests for up to three adjoining tables would still be honored if all the necessary IDs are presented upon request. 
"Seating priority is still ac­cording to the date of payment, not the order in which students come on Tuesday and Wednes­day," said Amestoy. She added that three students will sit at each table and their requests will be ordered by the date of the latest student's payment. 
"We decided to go with this method (students bringing IDs in person) because it's the method that we used last year for Junior Parents' Weekend," Amestoy said.

Iceberg Debates commence; goal is to 'focus awareness on different issues' 
By JEFF SWANSON News Staff 
In what organizers hope will create greater intellectual en­thusiasm at Notre Dame, all26 dorms and one off-campus team will begin competition in the new campus-wide Iceberg Debates today. 
"The focus is to raise aware­ness on different issues, not the competition itself," said Sorin Hall rector Joe. McKenna, chief organizer of the debates. 
All of the debates will deal with social issues, the first of which is "The content of Cath­olic social teaching is in con­flict with the current Republi­can Party platform." 
Student Body President Tom Doyle and Vice President Mike Paese decided to promote the Iceberg Debates after seeing the success of the Grace Hall debates, said McKenna. 
Doyle said that student gov­ernment has pushed for the debates to promote an aware­ness on social justice and to bring bigger issues to the at­tention of the campus. "We have committed ourselves to improving the intellectual life on campus and the debates are a way to do this," Doyle said. 
"We want people to know we're serious about the debates," Doyle said. He said that the Iceberg Debate pro­gram has been well thoughtout and well programmed. "It

IN BRIEF 
Nathan Hatch, acting dean of the College of Arts and Letters and professor of history, has been awareded the Albert C. Outler Prize in Ecumenical Church history by the American Society of Church History. The award was announced at the society's annual meeting in December. The award is for Hatch's forthcoming book "The Democratization of American Christianity" (Yale Univer­sity Press, 1989). The prize, which consists of a $1000 cash award to the author, was established to encourage the critical study of ecumenical church history and to facilitate publication of such studies. The book is a study of religion and culture in the half century following the American Revolution. The book examines five distinct traditions or mass movements that emerged early in the nineteenth century: the Christian movement, the Met­hodists, the Baptists, black churches, and the Mormons.

How was your break? Mine was crackerjack. Travel to Arizona for the Fiesta Bowl was a snap, and we didn't have to split for a week. 
Needless to say, the game was quite a ball, but I got a headache because our seats were so high. Must have been those mountain ears. I couldn't hear any cheers, either. Let's not skirt the issue: the cheerleaders were too far away. They should have been on de other side of de fense. 
The team sure did Rice to the occasion, though. 
I went skiing after the game--it was really quite a lift. The first run was really appoleing. We tried to avoid the moguls, but to snow aVail. 
There was a goggle of geese near the moun­tain, too. We had to duck to avoid getting hit. Sometimes skiing's for the birds. 
We thought we were Aspen for trouble when we tried the World Cup run. But we made the first jump and it was all downhill from there. (Good thing no one got hurt, because a funeral would have been too slalom.) And the hot choc­

I gave Steve a handicap--he was pretty green, and that was the only fairway to play. Ellen almost passed out from heatstroke. The game got pretty rough, but I was hooked by the end of the day. Golf isn't just a slice of life--it's the hole thing. I'd say "join the club.'-' We saw the Grand Canyon. It was really gorges. We couldn't see the hole canyon, though. After we ditched the car, we dug in our heels and stayed until the snow got too deep. We told Ellen that sex in the canyon would lead to orchasm. She believed us, since she's really gullyble. She finally figured out something was abyss. We drove through a national forest on the way back to Phoenix. Yew know, I'm glad we saw that. I would have pined away for it other­wise. It's knot everyday you see a national for­est. I feel like I have branched out my interests, like I've turned over a new leaf, like I went against the grain. And to think I almost axed that part of the trip. We saw lots of wildlife there, too. The brown furry things were deer to my heart, but the bigger one with antlers was more amooseing. The grizzly was a real bear, though, and his breath was unbearable. I'll never run into one

We didn't have airline tickets home so our departure was up in the air. We stood united, as full-blooded americans, and demanded an eastern flight. The bill was sky-high and unfor­tunately our baggage flew northwest to the orient. But the tail end of the flight (after we flew over the delta) was a breeze. Once we got wind of the free drink policy, money was no objet. 
After I got home, someone broke into my car. That drove me nuts. I'm sick and tired of car theft. Then my insurance company gave me a bum steer: they're just spinning their wheels on the claim. Give me a brake.

Soviets: nuclear weapons in Cuba during Missile Crisis 


Associated Press 
MOSCOW -A Cuban official has disclosed that 270,000 So­viet and Cuban troops were ready to go to war with the United States during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis and that 100,000 casualties were ex­pected, former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara said Sunday. 
A soviet general confirmed for the first time that one-third of his country's nuclear war­heads designed to strike the United States were in Cuba at the time. However, he said the warheads had not been mounted on missile launchers and were not ready for firing. 
The revelations came during a review of the Cuban missile crisis at a conference over the weekend at a trade union cen­ter in southwest Moscow. 
Soviets and Americans have met before to discuss the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba and the U.S. response: a blockade of the island and a demand for the rockets' removal. 
But this was the first joint meeting with Cuban officials who guided their country through the crisis. Premier Nikita Khrushchev eventually withdrew the missiles in ex­change for President Ken­nedy's pledge not to invade Cuba. 
At a news conference wrap­ping up the conference Sunday, MeNamara said the figures on Cuba's war readiness and casualty estimate were pro­vided by Jorge Risquet, a mem­ber of Cuba's ruling Politburo. 
"They say they had armed 270,000 men. They were deter­mined to fight to the death of every man, and they believed there would be 100,000 Cuban and Soviet casualties," McNamara told reporters. 
Other A~erican officials said privately the Cubans had said the casualty count could have reached 800,000. Cuba's population at the time was 8 million. 
McNamara said that of the troops, 40,000 were Soviet, four times higher than U.S. intelli­gence estimates at the time. 

Risquet cited the figures to show his country seriously believed that a U.S. invasion of his island was imminent. McNamara said no such inva­sion was ever contemplated, but speaking of the Cubans, he added: "if I had been in their shoes, I would have believed the same thing." 
American officials have said they were never sure whether any Soviet nuclear warheads had actually reached Cuba but that they assumed they had. 
Col. Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov, director of the Defense Ministry's Institute of Military History, said that at the time of the crisis 20 Soviet nuclear warheads were in Cuba. Another 20 warheads were headed to the island aboard a Soviet ship that was caught in the U.S. naval block­ade, he said. 
He made the remarks in a closed session of the confer­ence Saturday, and they were reported to The Associated Press on Sunday by Raymond Garthoff, a State Department official at the time of the crisis.

Yugoslav Central Committee meets today 
Associated Press 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia-
Communist leaders are bit­
terly divided over how to end 
the nation's worst postwar 
crisis as they prepare for a his­
toric meeting of the policy­
making Central Committee, 
state-run media said Sunday. 
The meeting on Monday is expected to generate a show­down between rival factions and may result in sweeping personnel changes that will in­dicate whether the country will institute economic and demo­cratic reform. 
Sources close to the nine­member federal presidency, which also heads the armed forces, told The Associated Press that the presidency has warned emergency measures would be imposed nationwide if a compromise within the ruling elite is not reached. 

The state Tanjug news agency said that at the "his­toric" meeting the leaders "should concretely state their views about a series of delicate and open political problems, which have brought the Com­munist Party to the brink of its total split and the country to the most dramatic postwar period." 
Liberal factions in the ruling League of Communists face a hard-line coalition led by the president of Serbia's commu­nists, Slobodan Milosevic. 
The session of the party's Central Committee, which has about 160 members, is to dis­cuss calls for replacement of the country's Communist Party President Stipe Suvar, who Serbian leaders blame for the wide split within the party. 
The state-run media indi­cated that the confrontation is in fact the clash between two political and economic con­cepts of Yugoslavia's future de­velopment.

Burger to receive $60,000 raise 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-Warren Burger, who stepped down as chief justice of the United States in 1986 and hasn't heard a case since, stands to receive a $60,000-a-year pay raise be­cause he claimed status as a "senior judge" rather than full retirement. 
Burger is not alone. An addi­tional 305 senior judges also legally qualify for the active­duty pay raises according to administrative records ob­tained by The Associated Press that indicate one in five do no legal work. 
The title of senior judge, created by Congress in 1919, al­lows federal jurists to sharply reduce their caseload while still qualifying for active-duty salary increases. Federal judges are appointed for life, though they may choose to resign at any time. 
Most senior judges hear cases, but Burger says he doesn't have the time. By con­trast, since he followed Burger off the bench in 1987, former Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell has served on the 4th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., and next month will sit on the nth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Florida. 
Burger declined to answer questions about his impending pay increase and his judicial workload other than to say, "I'm too busy to sit." 
Most senior judges do sub­stantial work and as a group they handle between 10 and 15 percent of all federal cases. "Across the nation, the federal judiciary would be a mess withe out the help of senior judges," said Appeals Court Judge Frank Coffin. 
Receiving active-duty pay raises while accepting no cases may not seem equitable, but it is not unlawful. Whatever Congress actually expected of the senior judges, current statutes require nothing in return for the active-duty salary increases. 
"It doesn't seem fair," said Rep. Carlos Moorhead, a mem­ber of a House subcommittee overseeing the federal judiciary. The California Re­publican said Congress may want to study "establishing some minimum work to qualify for the raises." 
Dozens of senior judges ap­parently accept no cases, the AP has learned. 
A report compiled by the Ad­ministrative Office of the U.S. courts provides rare caseload data on senior judges. For the year ending June 30, 1987, the study showed that 56 of 271 senior judges, or 21 percent, handled no cases. Of the 56, 49 were over 75 years old. 
"If you did the survey today I don't think things would be much different," said David Cook, a statistician who put to­gether the report for the admin­istrative office. 
Stephen Gillers, professor of legal ethics at New York Uni­versity, said, "As a lawyer and law teacher I would be troubled if judges were being paid for doing nothing and getting increments for doing nothing unless Congress made a con­scious decision that even judges in total retirement should get pay raises." 
Congress did no such thing. Judges who retire by resigning receive pensions that equal their last year's salary, but not subsequent increases. If Burger had taken full retire­ment in September 1986, his an­nual pension would be $108,400. Instead, he received a 1987 in­crease to $115,000 and next month he stands to receive a 52 percent boost to $175,000, the salary earmarked for the sit­ting chief justice, William Rehnquist.

It's sad that people who have always had more than enough to eat can really think that missing one of their 21 meals a week is such a big deal. 
"Miss lunch?" people say. "I'll get hungry." They probably will. Going hungry for a few hours a week is the sacrifice being asked from us, and, as students, we don't have time to worry about it. But the Fast doesn't ask for our time; it only asks that we give a little of ourselves, always knowing that at 4: 45, there will be plenty of spaghetti in the dining hall to fill up on again. This knowledge that food will be avail­able in a few hours is a luxury that millions of people don't have. These are the type of less fortunate people who benefit from fasters' generosity. The money collected from the Fast at the end of the semester goes towards grass roots development agencies in Argen-University Food Services roughly one dollar per lunch served. The rest of the cost is attributed to overhead, such as employee wages, equipment, and utilities. Mr. Hickey is not making money from the Fast. Instead, Univer­sity Food Services is taking on extra bookwork to help a very good cause. So, please don't use this as an excuse for not helping. 
On Feb. 1, the Wednesday Lunch Fast will begin. It will last the entire semes­ter, except for finals week. I would like to ask those of you who have been faith­ful fasters in the past to continue your generosity this semester. And to those who've never fasted, I'd like to ask you to try it. Skip one lunch and see if you can continue. It's not necessarily going to be easy, but it's a sacrifice well worth making. If you're willing to give of yourself, please sign up in the dining halls or your dorm this week. Thank you for your concern and caring.

unable to hold a lead after Pervis Ellison was injured, fell to No. 17 Ohio State 85-79 Sun­day. 
Earlier this week, No. 1 Illi­nois and No. 2 Georgetown lost. Louisville's defeat left No. 4 Oklahoma as a possible succes­sor at the top. 
Ellison, the team's leading scorer and rebounder, sprained a ligament in his left knee while scrambling for a loose ball just before halftime. Dr. Rudy Ellis, Louisville's physician, said he would deter­mine the extent of Ellison's in­jury Monday. 
"He has good motion and there is no fluid on the knee. I'm optimistic about his condi­tion," Ellis said.

No, the Tigers weren't looking for last-minute sip. The Duke crowd wanted to see Clemson assistant trainer Den· nis Hopf, who on Sunday became a Tiger reserve player following the suspension of six players because of violation of academic study hall rules. · 
The suspended 'Pli!yers~ including starters Elden Campbell and Marion Cash, and reserves Dale Davis and Tim Kincaid, sat on the bench during the game, and were not available for comment afterwards. But Hopf, one of the seven who remained, had a lot to say. 
''Friday afternoon, I was getting dressed, getting ready to go to practice and coach (Don} Hogan called me up and asked me bow would I like to play against Duke? I about passed out,n Hopf told reporters in the Clemson lockerroom. 
"I just said yeah. I was at the gym before he could hang · up the phone," he said. 
With two minutes left to play, Hopf arose from the decimated Clemson bench, took off his warmup and went into the lineup, bringing a roar from what was left of the crowd at the 92-62 victory. Hopf had specific instructions to shoot because Coach Cliff Ellis had told the other four players to make sure Hopf got the ball. 
"I couldn't believe he said that. That's just the greatest thing he could have done," he said, "To give me a shot like that is just a fantasy. He really made somebody's fantasy come true." 
O'Meara wins tourney with putt on final hole 
Associated Press 

PEBBLE BEACH, Calif.-­Mark O'Meara made a 6-foot birdie putt on the final hole and scored a one-shot vic­tory Sunday in the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. 
O'Meara's winning putt finished off a round of 70 and made Tom Kite a disap­pointed runner-up for the second time in as many months on the Pebble Beach Golf Links. 
O'Meara, who hadn't won on the PGA tour for four years, captured the fourth title of his career with a 277 total, 11 shots under par. 
The victory, his second in this unique event, was worth $180,000 from the total purse of $1 million. 
Kite, who lost a playoff in the rich Nabisco Champion­ships at Pebble Beach in No­vember, had a share of the top spot and was standing by the 18th green when O'Meara's winner found the cup. 
Kite finished with a 69 and a 278 total. 
There was little consola­tion in the $108,000 check for second place, which lifted him into third place on the all"time money-winning list. He now trails only Jack Nick­laus and Tom Watson. 
"Finishing second for the second time is tougher. It really hurts," Kite said. 
He singled out a string of three consecutive bogeys, on the seventh through ninth holes, as "where I lost the golf tournament." 
Two of those three bogeys came on three-putt greens. 
"Ludicrous," Kite said. 
He brought it back to tie O'Meara, and once went 
ahead with an eight-foot birdie putt on the 14th hole. 
O'Meara, playing behind him, responded with an even better approach that set up a two-foot putt that tied it again. 
It remained that way until O;Meara's 18th hole putt made Kite a runner-up again. 
Nick Price of Zimbabwe, who shared the third-round lead with O'Meara, shot 73 and dropped back into a tie for third at 280 with Jim Carter and Masters cham­pion Sandy Lyle. Lyle had a closing 68,..Carter 69. 
The group at 281 included Lanny Wadkins, Hal Sutton, Steve Pate and defending champion Steve Jones. Wad­kins shot 67 over the last 18 holes, Sutton 68, Jones 70 and Pate 71. 
Jack Nicklaus, 49, who was in title contention until he struggled to an 80 in Satur­day's play, closed with a 71 and finished at 289. 
Rice, No. 4 on Michigan's all­time list in scoring and field goals missed only one of his eight shots in the first half and that came from beyond the 3­point line. The 6-foot-7 senior forward also had five of his team's 13 rebounds in the first half, and he finished with 34 points. 
The Wolverines, 16-4 for the season but a disappointing 4-3 in the conference, pulled away with a 10-3 spurt midway in the first half to snap a two-game losing streak. 
An 8-footer by Mark Hughes ignited the spurt, glVlng the Wolverines an 18-12 edge with 
11 :50 remaining in the half. Loy Vaught followed with a 15­footer. Vaught, who brought the nation's leading field goal percentage of 73 percent into the game, made all four of his first-half shots. 
Jimmy Oliver revived Purdue's hopes with a 3­pointer. Michigan, which shot 69 percent in the first half (20 of 29), then scored six straight with Rice contributing four to put the visitors ahead 26-15 with 
9:26 remaining in the half.

ARCADIA, Calif.-Alysheba, richest thoroughbred ever and winner of three Eclipse Awards, was just reaching his potential when he was retired to stud, his trainer and jockey say. His owners felt he'd done enough already. 
On Saturday, Alysheba won the 1988 Eclipse Award as Horse of the Year in a landslide over unbeaten filly Personal Ensign. The vote by three racing organizations was 179­40, with Belmont Stakes winner Risen Star receiving one vote. 
"He was getting stronger every race," Alysheba's trainer, Jack Van Berg, said at Santa Anita, where the an­nouncement was made. "The last four races, he just got so strong, as a trainer, I would have liked to see what he could do as a 5-year-old."

"I really feel he'd have been better if he'd run in his fifth year," McCarron said. "Alys­heba never did reach his full potential. He was really blos­soming last year.'' 
Alysheba also won the 1988 Eclipse Award as best older horse, and he was 3-year-old of the year in 1987. At the end of the 1988 season, he was retired to stud at Will Farish's Lane's End Farm in Versailles, Ky., with a career record of 11 wins, eight seconds and two thirds in 26 starts.

Depleted Irish come up short 
By MOLLY MAHONEY Sports Writer 
Statistically, the final stand­ings in the Notre Dame men's track meet in Madison, Wise., were not pretty. 
But stat sheets neglect to mention that the Irish squad was undermanned--with many of its members either injured or out with the flu--and faced two of the strongest teams in the Big Ten in Wisconsin and Iowa State. 
Notre Dame fell to both teams tallying 24.5 points be­hind Wisconsin's 81.5 and Iowa State's 41. 
The distance races were to be the greatest challenge for the Irish, as Wisconsin, defend­ing cross country champion, and Iowa State, who finished sixth, both came into the tri­meet with a slew of talented runners. 
And, the Irish were without seniors Dan Garrett and co­captain Ron Markezich, both cross country All-Americans. 
But sophomore Ryan Cahill placed fourth in the mile run with a time of 4:24 and a three­man contingent of runners helped the Irish with strong 
performances  in  the  1,000­ 
meter run.  
Junior  Mike  Rogan,  senior  

David Warth and sophomore Matt Ronzone ran well in the 1,000-meter run to help the Irish grab second, third and fourth places, respectively. 
Rogan crossed the finish line in 2:29, with Warth finishing close behind in 2:30 and Ron­zone just after Warth in 2: 31. 
"We may not have won," said Rogan, "but it was good for the experience of compet­ing against good teams. Our three best guys didn't even compete so we just wanted to go out and do the best we could under those circumstances." 
Junior Tom O'Rourke helped Notre Dame in the 3,000-meter run against a strong field of runners, taking fifth place with a time of 8:36. 
Freshmen Shawn Schneider and Bill Dauphinais also helped the cause in the 3,000-meter run by placing sixth and eighth, respectively. 
In the middle distances only freshman Brian Peppard, ana­tive of Dublin, Ireland, tallied points for the Irish in the BOO­meter run, as he finished fifth with a time of 1:54. 
Junior co-captain Yan Searcy was able to place third in the 400-meter run, finishing in 50.30, despite suffering from a bout with the flu. 
And Searcy got a little help from sophomore Steve Culbert who placed seventh with a time of 51.75. 
Sophomore Richard Culp placed fifth for the Irish in the 200-meter dash finishing in 25.26 and freshman speedster Raghib "Rocket"· Ismail dominated the 55-meter dash, sprinting past the entire field to cross the tape in 6.28 and qualify for the IC4A meet. 
Junior Tracy Sims finished seventh in the 55-meter dash behind Ismail, who was just short of qualifying for the NCAA championships in his first collegiate track meet. 
Junior Glen Watson finished fourth in the 55-meter hurdles with a time of 7.76 and Jim Verde placed seventh behind Watson. 
The field events were buoyed by strong performances in the long jump and high jump as sophomore Jeff Smith and junior Xavier Victor took second and third place, respec­tively with leaps of 22-8 and 22-5 in the long jump. Sophomore John Cole leapt 6-8 to capture second place in the high jump. 
Freshman Marc DeManigold grabbed fourth place in the shot put with a toss of 47-7 V4 and junior Chris Bush tied for third place by clearing 14-0 in the pole vault. 
"We may not have won the meet," said Bush, "but we're confident about future meets. Everyone has been working really hard and I think we're going to have a great year."

Belles start quickly, but lose to Tri-State 
By HEATHER ATKINSON Sports Writer 
Despite its excellent start, Saint Mary's was unable to capture the win at Tri-State University Saturday night. The Belles dropped to 10-4 with their 73-62 loss. 
Saint Mary's charged ahead of its competition early in the game with a 14-4 lead. Tri-State rallied to close the margain, but the Belles maintained a narrow 39-37lead at the half and con­tinued to control the ball un­til the final few minutes of the game.

SMC swimming team coasts past Chicago 
By LIZ VANDERSAR Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's swim team Saturday downed the Univer­sity of Chicago. 134-76. 
Dominating almost every event, the Belles held a marked lead throughout the meet. 
The 400 medley relay team of Lori Swedish, Bonnie McLeod, Collette Rush and Yvette Ditmyer claimed first place with a time of 4:32.73. The Belles' relay team of Jen­nifer Glaser, Mary Cassidy, Jennifer MacDougall and Mar­garet Daday finished third at 5:10.57. 
Peggy Halloran had a strong finish in the 1650 freestyle with a 20:29.66, earning her a first place. 
dominated the remainder of the game, sinking nearly all of their shots. 
"It was a real nail-bitter," said Belles' coach Marvin Wood. "We were even all the way, but slipped back during the last three minutes. Tri­State was the winner of our District last year and has all of their players back, so they were tough competition." 
Junior Julie Radke dis­played her talent again as she led ·in all aspects of the game. She was the leading scorer with 14 points, pulled down 9 rebounds, had 4 as­sists and 4 steals. 
The next game for the . Belles will be Friday at An­derson College. 
The 200 freestyle proved to be a strong event for the Belles. Golski, Colburn and Glaser placed first, second and third respectively. 
The diving duo of Cummins and Blake each played a signif­icant role in the accumlation of points for Saint Mary's. Cum­mins placed first in the three meter diving and Blake second in the one meter. 
Maurer and McLeod's times of 2:36.65 and 2:28.24 in the 200 IM earned them second and third places. 
Colburn's 5:42.42 and Golski's 5:53.48 allowed for an easy domination in the 500 freestyle. Both teamed with Halloran and Maurer to win the 800 freestyle relay.

expenence 
By THERESA KELLY Assistant Sports Editor 
At the beginning of the bas­ketball season, no one would have expected the senior-less Notre Dame basketball team to win. in the games where expe­rience counted the most. 
But the Irish beat the Temple Owls 64-60 Sunday in a real test of who had the most grace un­der pressure. 
"You can see how much of a disadvantage it is when you don't have a senior citizen run­ning the country," said Temple head coach John Chaney, who started one senior, three sop­homores and one freshman against the Irish. "We're switching in freshmen at point, and at times you could see the disadvantage. Leadership is so important, perhaps more than anything else." 
Because the Owls effectively stalled the inside game of the Irish, the Notre Dame leaders, junior co-captains Jamere Jackson and Joe Fredrick, took over the scoring from the out­side, hitting 13 and 14 points, respectively. Sophomore Tim Singleton contributed 11 points, all in the second half and many of them penetration shots when the Irish needed to score. 
"In the second half, when Jamere started to hit, they started to extend the defense," Fredrick said. "Then the middle was left open for Tim, and he drove down it." 
After Temple jumped out to an early 18-9lead, Notre Dame came on to get within one point, at 20-19. From there, any lead was a slim one, as the defenses kept the game close. The Irish, despite committing 17 turn­overs, held a one point lead at

the half, and the scoring was balanced until the four-minute mark in the game as the Irish took better care of the ball, committing seven turnovers in the second half. 
With Temple holding a 57-53 lead, Jackson nailed a three­point shot from the right side. Fredrick stole the inbounds pass after the basket, and Keith Robinson rebounded Fredrick's missed shot to give the Irish a one point lead. Temple center Duane Causwell fouled LaPhonso Ellis, who hit the first half of the one-and­bonus, making the score 59-57.
