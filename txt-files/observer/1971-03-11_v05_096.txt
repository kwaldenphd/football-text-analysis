From this start, she revealed that last year the school had 28 black students. "Of these 28, four graduated, three were screened out, three cancelled, and 13 were enrolled from 1970. For 1970-71, we had 31 new applicants, 29 freshman and 2 transfer students. Of the 31, 19 were ac­cepted, 8 enrolled, 5 cancelled, and 6 did not reply to the ac­ceptance." (At the end of sophomore year, a committee meets to screen the class, to decide which applicants from their academic rec:ord have little chance of successfully finishing the four-year course of study. These students are subsequently invited to leave.) 
In other words, as Sister ex­plained, the admissions office committed itself to seventeen students that never showed. 
Questioned on why in tracing where the college's black students come from, a majority are from St. Pius X High School in Savannah, Georgia, Sister explained that it is accidental. She added that the school enjoyed a popularity with students from that high school. 
Next year, however, the in­coming freshmen black students will represent more regions than Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia which dominate the present black student body. New students are from areas such as California, Louisiana, and In­diana.

that no authority had been given 
to the various departments to 
hire the professors, and no means 
had been provided for the 
departments to maintain a 
"share" of authority over those

Russian Jews stage protest demonstration 
MOSCOW (UPI)-More than 100 angry Jews staged a sit-in hunger strike to back their demands for permission to go to Israel. Soviet police drove them out more than five hours later as they prayed in a darkened hall. 
Their demonstration began at 2 
p.m. after a group of Latvian Jews from Riga visited headquarters of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee and had their appeal for permission to emigrate to Israel r~jected. 
Members of the group said

A snow storm spun nor­theastward across thz Ohio Valley and Midwest toward the snow weary northeastern states. Rains doused much of the South. 
Another storm in the North dumped three to six inches of snow on parts of the middle Mississippi Valley. Most of the Ohio Valley was getting snow at mid-afternoon. Ohio and western Pennsylvania were warned to expect up to four inches of snow. 
police burst into the parliamentary hall at about 7:30 
p.m. (11:30 a.m. EST). Authorities had turned off the lignts and blocked off the building after the building's 5 p.m. closing time. 
A woman who was in the reception hall said a man in a militia police general's uniform threatened the Jews with arrest if they did not leave "in two minutes." 
"The lights were off, and we sat there in the dark,' she said. "One 
young man said prayers in Hebrew, and another translated into Russian." 
Then, she said, scores of uniformed 'and plainclothes policemen crowded into the room. 
"They surrounded us, and began pulling out thz benches we were sitting on," she said. "They started pushing us, and what cokld we do, we had to leave." 
The woman said she knew of no arrests being made.

On the Board of Trustees 
In all the current discussion and con­fused enthusiasm concerning the long awaited merger there is one body of this university whose thoughts have yet to be bared. A question which must be con­sidered is what action might be taken if this body falls short of its expectations. The feeling of the students is fairly well known by now. Most of the faculty ap­proves and the administration realizes its inevitability, but poll, research and plan in detail all you wish -any action lies with the outcome of the meeting of the Board of Trustees at Key Biscayne in March. Maybe I am being pessimistic (I hope so), but the idea of this university's direction residing in the hands of this group leaves me weary, not only in terms of practicality but also on mere principle. 
My purpose here is not to discuss the why of the university's existence, but, if I may use a gen~>ral term to include most views on a university's essence, I will say it is education. Based on this simple assumption, I find it hard to accept the thought that over half the members of the head body have little or no qualification <beyond a certain nebulous concern) in the field of education. In addition thirty of the forty-four trustees are geographically distanced from the university in places such as New York, L.A., and Florida. This 
Lance Corey 
is not to mention that the number of meetings per year are negligible in light of the many issues with which a university must be concerned. Last spring one trustee, after being cornered in the Center for Continuing Education, was asked his thoughts on the Nutting plan which had been discussed and publicized on campus for a number of weeks. His reply was "Who's Professor Nutting--I haven't been informed of this but I would like to be." 
In the last year and a half I have con­stantly heard the words "community" and "university" justaposed to express one of the basic principles of Notre Dame. Yet when the St. Mary's Student Body President is allowed merely to sit in on part of a trustee meeting it rates headlines. How can the existence of this governing body, which is geographically and occupationally (not to mention class­wise) in contrast with the needs of a university be rationalized? Many people feel it is a necessary check on the policies of the university from the "outside world." But this must be based on the shaky foundation that the checking force is qualified to judge the different policies and practices of the institution. Others consider the trustees as a source of money and therefore beyond any reasonable questioning. Earlier this year Jesse Unruh, who ran against Ronald Reagan for governor of California after having served on the state board of Regents, proposed that since business reaps the harvest of college students they should be obliged to support the colleges and universities throughout the country. This sounds nice but unfortunately it would only strengthen the detrimental grip of outside interests on the university. Business and corporate people are aware thwt all their future prospects will come from universities and therefore, regar­dless of the trustee system, it would only be reasonable to continue support of the higher educational process. 
On speaking with the dean of students from another catholic college the point was brought up that the trustees in most cases would agree with whatever he and the other administrators recommended. At the same time any plans or proposed programs are affected by the need to satisfy the trustees. And if the trustees are so agreeable and easily swayed, then why bother with unnecessary bureaucracy? 
There are a number of solutions or alternatives to the present Board. The one I feel is best is not surprisingly the hardest to enact. From the existing structure two different boards could be established. The first would consist of the present ad­ministrators on the board with representatives from each school on campus. Its functions would be similar to those of the existing board. The lay members, skilled as most of them are in money matters, would assume the role of financial advisory board. Allowing for the impracticality of a logical idea here there are other "adjustments" which would aid the head board in becoming part of its supposed body. One is the participation of students on the board. This could be tried at first in a non-voting manner, then in time voting privileges would be in order. Younger trustees, recent graduates for instance, would help mitigate the distance between the students and trustees. A final idea which would be most beneficial is the inclusion of members of other universities on the ruling board. This has already been experimented with in a fairly extensive manner and has proved successful. It provides not only an outside check or view, but a check by people who have dedicated themselves to the process and progress of education. 
It must be understood that I am not questioning the integrity 9f the individual members as has been done previously, but rather the practicality of only the roles they play in the life of this university.

Please forgive the dramatics. I am called by my friends an alarmist, a pessimist and sometimes a masochist. Though the later descriptions may be correct, they do not distort what is the reality of the future. I am truly alarmed. 
The United States at present has 6 per cent of the world's population and uses 57 per cent of the world's resources to maintain an affluent society of waste. We have surplus food for one years need, but an economic system incapable of distributing it equally. 30 million Americans are undernourished. In 30 years 100 million more Americans will demand more from a finite supply of resources while we are also trying to clean up our present mess. Our demands are growing faster than our means to provide. 
To achieve our present affluent society, we took many shortcuts that have resulted in the pollution of our planet. Though most of us live well, we also have a surplus of DDT. We are human guinea pigs awaiting the results of our poisoning by lead, mercury, arsenic, sulphur dioxide, DDT, 2, 4T, and a thousand other related pesticides, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, etc. All in the effort to produce for the people we have now. 
To achieve this level of pollution, we have: exhausted many of our vital resources ; exploited the resources of other nations through our complex economic and political spheres of influence. The price will be paid as the rest of the world continues in its growth. Iri all the history of the U.S., we have lost 600,000 men killed in combat; the world population has in­creased by this number in the past 3% days. Needless to say, our "miracle" crops have not produced enough food for these new members of the spaceship Earth. Nor have we built new hospitals, schools, houses, cars, etc., for these people. 
Many argue that our needs will be an­swered by the infinite resources and foods of the seas. What they neglect to say is that Lake Erie was polluted from the cities on its shores. This holds true for the oceans. All our pollutants do eventually end in the ocean. The shellfish industry of Long Island, N.Y. no longer exists. Fourteen square miles of dead ocean sea-bottom lay off the shores of Jones Beach as New York City's garbage disposal. The life ex­pectancy of Jones Beach is now four years. As other nations begin to realize the need to conserve, the U.S. will find itself vying for control. As examples, look to Chile and Ecuador. As every nation's need to provide increases faster than their ability, the pressure for internalional conflict thus increases.

Somehmes, w en my t Ulg becomes imagistically piquant, I worry that somewhere, perhaps if\ Purgatory, there must be a 
great scrap heap of Lost Callings; and that any day now my own vocation, stamped as irrelevant 
by the Underground Church,
will be tossed onto that pile. I feel this way mostly after I've had two Manhattans, and then meet a nun wearing levis and a bumper sticker reading, "Joy is God's Other Name," who is hustling her way over to the 
M 0 t h e r h 0 use f 0 r h e r 
Community's production of Hair. 
Perhaps it's self pity, but I know I'm not contemporary in any of the essential ways. For example, I don't really believe in the ecumenism that says Billy Graham is as infallible in his faith and his morals as the Pope. I can't accept it that Pot does more than Milton can to justify God's ways to man. I'm sceptical that a mod Jesus would tell Paul to cool it with the Colossians, and to update II Thessalonians to the tastes of the publishers of Playboy. 
Being out of it is why Summer School '70 is so humiliating to us derelicts of Time. Yesterday, a newly hatched cleric came burbling into my office, a puling, priestly infant of a man in his twenty-fifth year of life; so recently ordained that his bouffant was still creased by the Bishop's laying-on of hands. He had spent the morning burning his draft card and mailing the ashes to the Eisenhower widow as a reproach to the militarv-industriJl complex. 
He soon discovered I would speak to him only of crop failures in Ethiopia and the 
domestic strife in the palace of the Dalai Lama, to distract him from learning that age can make 
eunuchs of our fiercest convictions. Draft card burning 
at my time of life would attract about as much excitement from 
the Government as Phyllis Diller in the Rockne in a topless swim suit, unless they mistook her for Albert Schweitzer. At the age of that boy priest, I too might have burned my draft card, but I can't remember, As a clue,
however, I do know that the bol'dest act of resistance of my life was to disobey a sign that said: Do Not Flush While Train Is Standing In The Station, in Lima, Ohio. I was protesting the neglect of my porter. There is really no way for me to ... keep up with the Liberal Persuasion. Take Mass, for example. Last week it was the "Pizza and beer I Jesus is here" formula among the crowd that swings in Sheboygan. This week, it's back to the traditional bread and wine, but the celebrant stands on his head for the Canon. Next week they'll be using camel fritters and buttermilk, which will be so nauseating that even the Real Presence may get sick and die. After that, it's back to the drawing board for a brand new Blessed Sacrament. As an old-fashioned Christian, I don't need the New Theology to tell me all the ways in which the Lord was human. He may or may not have had trouble keeping His nose tidy as a boy. 
but whoremembersnowbutHis mother?Is it really necessary to the faith-experience for Malcolm 
Boyd to insist that Jesus had 

something as human as warts? Does the man suppose the rest of us are of the opinion that God was so nervous at the Incarnation that He left off His own backside'If I were Malcolm Boyd, I would trust people to respect the thoroughness of Omnipotence in arranging the ways for the Word to become Flesh. Then I'd stop spreading rumors about the moral permissiveness of my Redeemer. It must be obvious that I11 never be invited by the Berrigans to show up with a matchbox at the Catonsville Draft Board. I11 never be invited to join the Roman Curia, either. I'm just in the middle of the road of a polarized Chruch, hoofing the pathway to obsolescence. Every morning, I wake up and kiss my dreams of self as charismatic leader goodbye. Then I wait for the dump truck of the Now 
Generation to cart me and the Baltimore catechism off to the scrap heap of lost callings.

Houston-New  Mexico  State  
victor.  
The  Irish, seeking  a  record  

fourth straight 20-victory season, will take a 19-7 record into the TCU game. Dee's club, actually playing in its fourth straight post­season tournament, has played what is considered the toughest schedule nationally. The Irish have played seven of the top 12 ranked teams and also seven NCAA Tournament teams that could increase after conference tournaments or playoffs. 
Notre Dame holds victories over 'Southeastern Conference champion Kentucky, Pac-8 leader and top ranked UCLA (89­
82) and Big TEn title possibility Michigan while losing to Atlantic Coast tourney favorite South Carolina, Marquette, Dusquesne and Fordham by a total of 17 points. 
The Irish decisioned NIT bound Dayton last Monday, 83-82 as Carr scorecll 47 points. Notre Dame also holds an early season road win over St. Louis, one of the Missouri Valley Conference title contenders. 
Last year Notre Dame started its NCAA Tournament campaign with an impressive 112-82 Mideast Regional win over Mid-
American champion Ohio 
University as Carr scored an 

NCAA record of 61 points. 
Kentucky eliminated the Irish 
109-99 but Carr scored a total of 97 
points against the Wildcats and 
Iowa (consolation) and a total of 
158 points in three games. 
Carr, the Irish captain, is 

ranked second nationally in 
scoring for the second straight 
year with a 37.5 average. He 
needs just 24 points to reach the 
1,000 plateau and his career 
average ofe of 34.3 (2,435 points) 
is second in the history of college 
basketball. He passed Oscar 
Robertson three weeks ago and 
will probably finish second to 
Pete Maravich (44.2 avg.) 
Carr, who plays under the 

basket in Dee's offensive setup, is 
also the third leading rebounder 
on the team with a 7.2 average. 
"TCU has a lot of quickness and in the last two months they've put it all together," said Irish assistant coach and scout Gene Sullivan. "Thev can run with the basketball· and (6-6 Eugene) Kennedy is a fine rebounder," added Sullivan. 
Kennedy, who leads the TCU scoring attack with a 20.7 average, was named the South­wt>st Conference Player of the Year (AP). The junior college transfer, one of three on the starting unit, is also ranked among the top 10 nationally in rebounding (16.9) and field goal percentage (.596). 
Coach John Swaim, the SWC Coach of the Year, has watched his club compile a 16-10 record (12-2 in the conference l. The Fort Worth based cagers won just four of 12 games during the pre­conference schedule. 
The two TCU forwards are 6-4 JC transfer Simpson Degrate 
08.2 ppg.) and 6-3 Ricky Hall 
(13.5) the only starter from last year's team. JC transfer Jim Ferguson (9. 7 ppg.) and sophomore James (Snake ) Williams (7.3 ppg.) are the guarrls. 
Just for the Record 
by Mike Pavlin 
Austin Carr now has 2435 career points which puts him in tenth place on the NCAA all-time list. He is just 27 points behind Tom Gola and if the Irish defeat TCU, he will get two more games and a shot at fifth place.

JIM MURRAY 
Feet of Clay 

© 1970, Los Angeles Times 
NEW YORK-You were expecting maybe Armageddon? The Apolcalypse? . . It was a schoolyard fight. It was the most unprofessiOnal fight I have ever seen for 150 bucks top. 
But, Lord, it was exciting! 

As this is written, at midnight in the catacombs under Madison Square Garden, the word is, Muhammad Ali's jaw was broken. It's for sure his heart was. 
I never thought I would live to hear Ali described as a "fighter who can take it." His whole life style is based on dealing out punishment and then disappearing like some poltergeist with B-ounce gloves. The state, the government, the press, the establishment could never lay a glove on him. 
Joe Frazier laid about 50 on him. The one that counted was a left hook that Joe Frazier started just south of Weehawken. Ali had started a right. He was still holding it, cocked, when he thudded to the canvas. The butterfly had turned into a cocoon. The old magic was taking an 8­count. 
I suppose it will be taken in some quarters as a victory for hot dogs and apple pie, the Fourth of July and moonlight along the Wabash. And it's safe to belong to the American Legion again and "Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag"-but actually it was just a fist fight. 
Ali the wunderkind, the beautiful icon of the ghettos, had such impli,cit faith in his destiny that he released a handwritten, boastful ode of this own success practically on his way down the aisle. Defeat was as incomprehensible to him as Einstein't Theory. 
He was like a guy going to the electric chair buying a new car. 
He thought he was going right to the kingdom of all boxing. Instead, he was going to the hospital. He thought Joe Frazier was just another doll to stick pins in, make faces at, and then, in the dark of the ~oon, turn it into a zombie. He made up poems, pulled all the old shticks, humiliated his opponent publicly, privately, in rhyme and in simple declarative sentences. 
He sneered at his opponent's punches, jeered and shook his head "No, No!" at the most violent shots. 
Even when his jaw looked like the world's biggest hunk of bub­blegum, he pretended it wasn't happening. Reality has never been Ali's bag. He lives in a kind of Arabian Nights fantasy world. 
But Joe Frazier was not a confused, fearful, spooked pug. Joe Frazier comes to work, like a guy who brings his lunch in a pail, turns on the machine and doesn't stop till the whistle blows. Ali tried to punch him out of his one-track mind, then to talk him out of it. 
It was like trying to con an on-coming train. Frazier felt the mighty Ali crumpling under his punches as early as the sixth round. Then, for awhile, it was Frazier's turn to underestimate his opponent. 
Make no mistake about it, Muhammad Ali is no pug. But he is a fighter. Leaden-legged, taking punches he never knew existed in his previous 150 fights, absorbing blows to the stomach that will come out as blood clots for a week, he had turned into the immovable object. 
His only offensive weapon was the clinch, the last, desperate resort in the agonia of the prizefighter. Frazier stagered him in the 11th round and he was so out on his feet that he started to fight with his manager in the corner as Angelo Dundee, sick with worry, began to spray him with water. 
The doctor came into the ring. Ali was not accepting house calls. He waved him out. His prediction of a sixth-round knockout was now a faded old dance card, a memory of a time when he was young and beautiful. 
He came out and fought-like every broken-nosed but great-hearted 
clubfighter who ever lived, he was going to go out throwing his best 
shots. Boasters usually give way to rout quicker than strong, silent 
types. . _ 

Ali hoisted all flags and gave battle. It's a way only champions have. And he was a champion. The beautiful face was now a gargoyle, a ting by Rodin hanging off a French cathedral. He had to sag against the ropes and taunt his foe through swollen lips and puffed cheeks and contemplate the machine besetting him and wish he coi.tld bluff it out of its victory. 
When he could not, he attacked. It may have been his finest moment in a ring. Or anywhere else. 
Frazier frequently fought as if he had all week. There was still a chance Ali could snatch a decision as the 15th round opened. It was clear Ali considered himself behind. He fought like a man playing catch-up. Had he clutched and clinched his way and groped to the final bell, a disputed decision and the roars of controversy would have drowned out the memory of the Long CCount, the sun shade in Havana--all of boxing's hallowed eccentricities. 
Ali wanted to win going away but not his his feet. 
The most important right hand he ever threw never got out of the garage. He was wide open-as all righthand punchers are drawing back to swing. Frazier leaped with a crunching left. 
Ali got up. But the punch sealed any chance for the expected 
miracle, the intervention of his private genies. 
You can't give a fight to a man who gropes to his corner like a guy 
leaving a train wreck. The unthinkable, the unfaceable, the hollow 
end to the high-decibel hysteria of "I The Greatest!" had gone down on 
the seat of his pants. The tassels of his his shoes with which he chor­
tled childishly he would bedazzle Joe Frazier out of his championship 
were pointed in the air. The myth dead-ended on a left hook. 
The fight should have been held on a pier; The beauty, the poetry 
that was Ali was gone in the gutter of primeval, atavistic, caveman 
battle. 

He will be back. But it will never be the same. An era had ended. 
He is, for the nonce, at one with Dempsey in the rain at Philadelphia in 
1926, Johnson in the sun at Havana in 1914, Louis on the ring apron, his 
balding head glaring in the television mirror in 1951. 
He is mortal. That may be harder to take than the jaw.

the top of the key with his soft jump shot or, using good moves, he can work free underneath for layups. 
"I've really enjoyed playing basketball at Notre Dame," Catlett says. "Playing against the toughest teams in the nation like we do has made me a better basketball player." He went on. "I think that the experience that we've gotten by playing so many big games this season will really help us in the NCAA tour­nament." Sid said, "We've been under pressure many times before and we get "up" for the big games. Everyone's been waiting for the tournament. I'm positive that we'll play well." 
CaUett was pleased that the Irish had been placed in the Midwest bracket of the NCAA tourney. "I think we've got a good chance to win the Midwest tournament. It's not the easiest division, but it's not the toughest." 
Sid has had a number of thrills at Notre Dame, including playing in the first game at the Convo, playing in the NCAA tournament three consecutive years, and upsetting UCLA this season, but he says the biggest thrill of his college years will come this June when he receives his diploma. 
The long basketball season made it tough for Sid to stay on top of his studies but the big fellow worked hard and will graduate, majoring in sociology, at the end of this semester. 
"I chose sOciology because I'm interested in people and how they interact with other people," he said. 
Sid pocnted out that getting along with others was an im­portant factor in the success of a basketball team. "You're dealing with players' egos, with their personalities, on a college team. All the players were stars in high school and they have to accept being just another one of the players on the team. A team that isn't happy isn't going to win." 
"We have a very closely knit team here, everybody gets along. That isn't the case at a lot of schools." 
"It's been great to play with the guys here," Sid said. "The fans have been great too. They're always behind us." 
It's a sure thing that lots of people will be behind the Irish on Saturday in Houston. And it's just as sure that Sid Catlett will be doing more than his share as the Irish make another bid for the national championship.

I'm afraid this has other implications, none of which appeared in your article. Is there true, complete justice in this world-I'm afraid not and one can only hope for such a time. But to raise a man to the status of martyr, or further, because of a contest he participated in is c. ridiculous. Perhaps very old, and perhaps very much of a cliche, I think it holds true that out of defeat comes one's greatest victories. If so, Muhammad Ali has only begun to fight. 
Sincerely yours, Doug Smego 100 Howard

ESP Revisited 
A few weeks ago I did a column on extra-sensory perception (or ESP, as it is called by its many friends and relatives). The amount of mail I received from you about this column, dear readers, was so heavy 
. that I find myself with a heart full of gratitude. (I also find myself with a ruptured postman.) I would of course like to write each one of you personally, but that is obviously not possible, so I will try to answer some of your questions in today's column. 
QUESTION: Last night I tried an ESP experiment with my boy­friend, Precog Nissen. He sat in one room and wrote a list of numbers. I sat in another room and tried to guess what numbers he was writing. Out of 25 tries I guessed wrong 25 times. I feel icky and worthless and have decided to kill myself. What future can a person have without ESP? 
ANSWER: You must not despair. Lots of people without ESP manage to live useful ~nd productive lives. For example, there was a coed at Duke a few years ago, Maud Gonder by name, who tried guess­ing numbers, just as you did. In fact, she tried it every single day for the entire four years she spent at Duke, and all she ever got was wrong numbers. But it didn't hurt her one bit. Miss Gonder today is gain­fully employed as a telephone operator in Durham, North Carolina.

··, 

QUESTION: This has nothing to do with ESP, but maybe you can tell me anyhow. What can you do for dry hair? 
ANSWER: Wear a wet hat. 

QUESTION: My ESP tells me I was put on earth to do some kind of important JOb, but I don't know what it is. So far I've had hundreds of JObs and I still haven't found the right one. How will I know when I do? 
ANSWER: You'll know, don't worry. Take, for example, the fa­mous case of Hans Helmut Steppenwolf. He too knew he was born for some exalted task, but what? First he worked in Kansas gleaning beans but that wasn't it, so he got a job with a logging firm in Montana. Here the erstwhile bean-gleaner worked as a stump-thumper. But that wasn't it either, so he moved to North Dakota where he tended the furnace in a granary (wheat-heater). Then he moved to Omaha and got a job admitting cattle to the stockyards (meat-greeter). Then he went to New Orleans and worked for a chiropodist (feet-treater). Then to Minnesota where he cut up frozen lakes (ice-slicer). Then to Las Vegas where he determined odds at a crap table (dice-pricer). Then to Germany where he pasted camera lenses together (Zeiss-splicer). 
Still Hans Helmut hadn't found it. Back to America he moved and got a job in Milwaukee at the Miller High Life brewery, inspecting the ingredients that go into Miller High Life Beer and rejecting those which were not perfect (malt-faulter). 
And so finally, at long last, fulfillment came to Hans Helmut. For this was his mission, his lofty purpose on earth-to make sure that you and I and every other life-loving, health-oriented, flavor-directed American should rest secure in the knowledge that the next can or bottle of Miller High Life which passes our discriminating lips will be just as free of fleck and flaw as the last can or bottle of Miller High Life which passed our discriminating lips; that can after can, bottle after bottle, keg after keg, Miller High Life will remain ever amber, ever ambrosial, ever honest, sincere, true, good, beautiful, decent, kindly and relevant. 
And so, dear friends, to that small but shining list of human bene­factors-men like E. Pluribus Ewbank, for instance, who invented the opposable thumb without which millions of castanet players would be unemployed; women like Rosa L. Sigafoos, for instance, who invented the bio-degradable roommate-let us humbly and gratefully add the name of Hans Helmut Steppenwolf. Right on, watchful malt-faulter! 
* * * 
Surely the story of Hans Helmut has left a lump in your throat. We, the brewers of Miller High Life and sponsors of this column, know a pleasant way to remove said lump. It comes in cans, bottles and kegs. 
Kline's nine goes South 
A week-ong trip into Arkansas, Tennessee and Kentucky, regular season games against some of the outstanding teams in the Midwest and nine doubleheaders highlight Notre Dame's 1971 baseball sschedule announced ttoday by Athletic Director Edward 
.<Moose) Krause. Jake Kline, a member of the college baseball Hall of Fame, will enter his 38th campaign when he takes his Fighting Irish baseball team to ,Jonesboro, Arkansas, for a three game series starting March 15. Notre Dame's baseball team 
finished with an overall 17-14 :record last year and gained a berth in the NCAA District four Playoffs. The Irish decisioned Big Ten champion Minnesota 6-2 before dropping a 1-o contest to Southern Illinois.

Matme.n tie Marquette 
by Terry Shields Observer Sports Editor 
Notre Dame wrestling captain Tom Ciaccio closed out his career last night with a convincing 9-3 decision over his Marquette Warrior opponent to help the Irish salvage a tie against the Milwaukee school, 19-19. 
With this win Ciaccio set a school record for career victories at 46. He also holds the record for a career takedowns. 
Another senior, Pat Mudron, closed out his career in the heavyweight division with a 4-1 decision. Mudron wrestled in place of the super-heavyweight, Phil Gustafson. Pat had been just a point behind the unbeaten Gustafson all season in the challenge matches and coach Terry Mather gave him a starting nod in the season finale. 
Besides Ciaccio's 118 lb. win and Mudron's heavyweight decision, Rich Esposto also won 16-7 in the 134 lb. class.

Bob Habig and Rick Aselege 

were the big point getters for thz Irish with pins over their foes from Marquette. Habig won his 15oth match in 3:16 and Aselege put his opponents shoulders on the canvas in 6:22. Aselege wrestled 190 lb. class. 
Other Irish grapplers who didn't fare quite so well in their final matches of the season were Ken "Scrambler" Ryan who lost a 7-2 decision. Mike Kemp was also the victim of a decision. His tally read 10-2. Bob Bennett and Kurt Bottjer 058 and 167 respectively) were pinned. Steve Moylan was shutout in 126 by a s-o count. 
This tie leaves the Irish mat­men with an 8-9-2 slate. Although the season cannot be looked upon as a total success there were some individual efforts that made the Irish worth following. Ciaccio and Gustafson are both record setters and ND fans can look forward to another season of Big Phil's numerous pins and he still has that undefeated season and career record. That's not bad. 

'Nova wins IC4A 
by Vic Dorr Observer Sportswriter 

The 50th annual indoor track and field championships were held last weekend in Princeton, New Jersey, and Villanova's Wildcats captured the ICAAAAteam title for the fifth 
~~~£ir£i::i~;:~ij~-l straight year.
I But while the meet provided 

the Wildcats with an opportunity to display their numerous talents, ·it held only disappointment for the Notre Dame delegation. The 
2nd and final week 
Irish team finished far back in 
evenings 7:45 

the overall scoring, as they were 
able to garner only eight points throughout the two-day affair. Villanova's 42 points easily took the team crown, and Pittsburghand Penn tied for second with 21 
apiece. The Terrapins of Maryland finished fourth with a 20-point effort. 
Mike McMannon was the big performer for Notre Dame. He placed second in the long (or board) jump with a distance of 24-5, and finished third in the triple jump with a leap of 47-Wh. Irish weightman Elio Polselli finished fifth in a close round of shot-putting competition. Polselli's best throw travelled 55­2, while the winner of thz event, Maryland's John Hanley, won with a toss of 58-10. Notre Dame's ace middle­distance runner, Rick Wohlhuter, pulled a muscle in the 600 yard run, and thus did not place. This injury to the Irish captain will keep him from defending his NCAA title in the 600 in next weekend's meet in Detroit, but it shouldn't hamper his ef­fectiveness during the outdoor season. 
Wohlhuter's injury erased the possibility of an interesting matchup in the 600. Tom Ulan of Rutgers won the event in 1:08.5, and such competition would certainly have produced a good effort from Wohlhuter. Ulan's time in the 600, good though it was, was overshadowed by the work of Villanova's outstanding mile duo, Marty Liquori and Chris Mason. These two finished 1-2 in their event, and assured the Wildcats of individual, as well as team honors.
