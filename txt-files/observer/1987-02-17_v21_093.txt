In Brief 
Although Charles Manson has spent the last 18 years in California's San Quentin Prison for the brutal Tate-LaBianca murders, he is anything but remorseful. "I've done nothing I'm ashamed of," Manson, 52, told Life magazine. "Nothing I couldn't face God with. I wouldn't kill a bug. (But) I'd probably kill all of them if I could."

Memories of childhood bring back thoughts about a lost friend 
Whenever a helicopter flew over our neigh­borhood, my best friend Tammi and I had to run to our yards and stay there until the sky was clear. We would line our toes up as close as possible to the curb and shout to each other across the street that separated us. Tammi's older brother Greg would pace nearby with a long pole in his hands, ready to tap our feet if we stepped out of bounds. He told us that the president flew around the country in a helicop­ter, making sure that little girls were in their own yards. And at eight, we believed him im­plicitly. ' 
Our mothers were best friends, and they used to laugh at the wild things Greg could make us believe. Once he told us a salesman in suit and tie, trudging door to door on a steamy July day, was selling watermelon slices out of his black metal samples case. Why did we believe that a man in suit and tie would go door to door in 90-degree weather, selling slices of watermelon out of an airtight black metal box? 
Such a question would be easy to understand if you had grown up across the street from someone as remarkable as Greg. His capacity to imagine and invent was amazing; his power over our child-minds was complete. He would act out roles for us --usually something he'd seen in a TV miniseries --switching with frightening intensity and suddeness from a caring doctor helping Jews in the "The Holocaust" to a brutal slave-trader from "Roots." He kept changing, always creating. 
I cannot conceive of my life before age 12 without Greg, or my friend Tammi, or my mot­her together with theirs talking long into the night as we three eavesdropped on our back porch. 
But change was inevitable, even if it was in­conceivable. We had already moved out of the old neighborhood when Greg was officially diagnosed a manic depressive. I didn't see much of him anymore, although my mom kept me updated on his fights, arrests and intermit­tent hospital stays through her conversations with his mother. 
Greg was going crazy. At one point, he had smashed up all the furniture in their house; his mother was afraid for her own safety. 
Things got bad when I was a senior in high school. One of my best friends lived in my old neighborhood, and I had been out with her to a party that night. A little after midnight I was at her house with some friends, trying to call my parents so I could beg them to let me stay out longer. I let the phone ring and ring; it was odd that no one answered, but I was glad. Now I had a legitimate excuse for staying out later.

We loaded more beer into my friend's jeep and 
drove up the ridge on which part of the neigh­
borhood is built. 
It was a mild September night, and up on the ridge we had a panoramic view of the Arkansas river, with the lights of the lock and dam and the slow-moving barges. We were getting drunker, taking off our shoes and dancing to the music blaring from the jeep's radio. I re­member standing on the hood, a golden eagle with spread wings painted underneath me, and feeling the breeze sweep off the ridge and seemingly pull me down across the river valley. 
I remember thinking how lucky my friends and I were to be standing on the ridge in the night breeze --strong and young --feeling there was nothing we couldn't do, nothing we loved that would ever end for us. 
A couple hours later I had sobered up some and was driving home. I hadn't bothered to call back after the first time and was expecting to get a lecture. I burst into the living room, my defense prepared and on my lips, when the whole situation struck me as odd. My entire family was awake and dressed, even though it was very late, and they were all sitting around quietly, staring at me as I entered. My mother looked up at me and she was crying. 
My dad said softly, "We have some bad news..." And I sat down too, shaking.

Attacking religious zealotry that inhibits the political process, Sen. Paul Simon, D­Il., warned in a lecture Monday night against "wrapping politi­
cal  beliefs  in  a  religious  
veneer."  
In  his  lecture  entitled  

"Religion and Political Life: A Partnership of Convenience or Convictiton?" Simon said, "To be part of a religious elite that has a monopoly on the ultimate truths is emotionally satisfy­ing, but having been so anointed, it becomes danger­ous when these emotionally­charged certainties are applied to political life." 
The Senator cited examples of current and past religious ­political conflicts. He said that in Northern Ireland and Lebanon "zealots on each side, applying their faith to political

life in an unthinking way, kill in the name of religion." 
Simon, an active member of the Lutheran Church, urged politicians to act on their beliefs rather than simply hold them. "Few candidates say that they belong to no church, though for some it appears to be a matter of (political) con­venience rather than convic­tion. They worship on the golf course rather than in a sanctu­ary, but often are the most ready with pious phrases on the proper occasion," he said. 
Simon offered his predeces­sor Abraham Lincoln as an ex­ample of a politician who said he belonged to no church but who went to Presbyterian ser­vices regularly and who helped abolish slavery and reunite a nation. 
"We also have the opportu­nity to shape history," Simon said. 
According to Simon,however ,compromise that may not be possible in re­ligious faith is essential in the political arena. Simon said he did not expect religious leaders to compromise their "revealed dogma," but "when the in­flexibility of religious dogma is applied to political life, then practical compromises that are necessary for progress sometimes cannot follow.'' 

Simon pointed out fundamen­talist leader Jerry Falwell, who has described Simon as "a re­ligious bigot," as someone who tries to present his political beliefs as religious doctrine. 
The Senator challenged reli­gious leaders and politicians to approach today's issues with less unyielding dogmas and more concentration on aid for the less fortunate. 
Simon, who was elected Illi­nois Lieutenant Governor in 1968, has served five terms in the United States House of Rep­resentatives and was elected to the United States Senate in 1984.

After listening to the speakers, the Student Senate then discussed Student Body Vice President Don Mon­tanaro's and Off-Campus Senator Fred Pugliano's meetiag with South Bend police 
officials, the Neighborhood 
Housing Services (NHS) and 
off-campus students last 
Thursday. 
"We looked for concessions 
from the police department, so 
they wouldn't bring in eight 
policemen with dogs to break 
up parties. But they said they 
just couldn't understand us 
having 10-keg off-campus par­
ties," said Montanaro. 
"(David) Roos (board mem­ber of the NHS) says there is no reason why they should sof­ten because of the University's alcohol policy," Montanaro added. According to Roos, "There is a number of faculty and students unhappy with the alcohol policy, and the opinion of South Bend residents in gen­eral is that the reason for the record number of off-campus parties is the alcohol policy," said Montanaro. 
Judicial Coordinator Maria Cintron countered, "The prob­lem is deeper than softening up the alcohol policy . . . . The problem is not going to be solved until individuals learn how to drink responsibly. don't blame the police depart­ment for not granting conces­sions, with students destroying property and getting out of hand." 
Montanaro said he did not en­tirely agree. "Drinking is a part of the college experience. I think it's time we accept that as a given." 
Senior Class President Dave Miklos argued however that this was "not a given." 
Pugliano maintained that the University's alcohol policy was at fault for the increase in com­plaints and citations against students at parties. Said Pugliano, "Captain (Pat) Cot­trell said he would rather have us breaking the law here than in South Bend."

students to grow in whatever aspect they choose." 
Hashagen said, "The ideal social climate is for women, not for girls. The ideal climate al­lows you to grow and not only allows you to grow but to have a good time and find out more about yourself in the process. We can only reach that growth if we have all different aspects of the College working to­gether, not working against each other." 
"Academics is the core of our college life here, and every­thing grows from our academics," Rucker responded. "We have to be comfortable with our environ­ment in order to take advan­tage and really learn and grow as people." 
Regarding the question of an alcohol problem on the Saint Mary's campus, Hetterich responded, "Here at Saint Mary's we've always abided by the Indiana state law. It's cut and dried, you have to be 21 to drink here. 
We support the awareness, but we don't want to run it into forced more than they have been. We do think that Saint Mary's has a very realistic (alcohol) policy." 
When asked their opinion on the College's mission state­ment, which is printed in the student handbook, Rucker replied "the big thing is trying to make people aware of what's in it, which are very general statements about what kind of community we are and try to apply them in everyday lives." 
Eckhoff added, "Our mission is very strong; however, if we're fostering a Christian at­mosphere here, we're not to­tally aware to minorities." 
Also with regard to the Mis­sion statement, Cook said, "I think the mission statement that will come about in another year will speak more strongly to women's issues and social justice. I think student govern­ment can play a hand in educat­ing students about the mission statement." 
"One of the most important things is that we are unique," said Hashagen. "We are a wo­men's college. There are smaller and smaller numbers of women's colleges that can stand as strong and as proud as Saint Mary's can." 
The candidates were then given three minutes for a closing statement to sum up their platforms and reiterate any points made. Hetterich stressed the enthusiasm and di­versity of experience of her ticket. Rucker expressed her disappointment over the ques­tions that had been asked, and mentioned that the current stu­dent government was not "in touch with what students were doing." She also challenged an opinion made of her ticket by Scholastic magazine by saying, "We've been accused that we lack the knowledge of student government structure by Scholastic magazine, and be­cause of this, we won't be any good." 
Cook summed up her plat­form by praising the Saint Mary's student body for its en­thusiasm in this year's elec­tions, mentioning the three tickets running for student body offices as well as class of­fices. 
Voting will take place in the Haggar College Center tomor­row, from 7am to 7pm. All freshmen, soophomores and juniors are encouraged to vote.

granted," Hume said. "The es­sence of unity is the acceptance of diversity." 
Hume said it is a "tragedy" that the Irish people have con­tributed to unity in other countries but have been unsuc­cessful in advancing a "healing process" in Ireland. 
"There is a three-step process I call the healing process. The first stage is to create equality of all citizens. We've made a great deal of progress in the last ten years," he said. "The second stage, the crucial stage, is reconciliation breaking down the barriers be~ tween the Irish." 
Finally, Hume advocates a completly new relationship be­tween Catholics and Protes­tants which would be born out of their working together. "There are no instant answers," he said, "and any politicians who promise it will be all right tomorrow are mis­leading them." 
Hume's lecture was spon­sored by the University of Notre Dame's Institute for In­ternational Peace Studies. 
Correction 
A Notre Dame election story in Monday's Observer incorrectly reported that "Buzz" Eckelkamp is Dillon Hall's current president. Terry Lally holds that posi­tion. 
Also in the article the name of Jim Mangan, a can­didate for student body vice president, was misspelled.

Hetterich ticket earns endorsement 
We endorse the ticket of Eileen Hetterich, Smith Hashagen and Julie Parrish for Saint Mary's student body officers. 
After much debate and considerable thought, we feel that although the experience of the Sarah Cook ticket is admirable, the diversity and positive attitude of Hetterich's ticket offers a fresh outlook. 
We admire the Ann Rucker ticket for their candidness; however, their approach toward the issues involved with the student government debate was too negative. They seemed to feel that experience was a hindrance rather than a plus in the role of student body president. 
The Hetterich ticket exemplifies a balance of hard work, experience and levity. The unique sense of humor displayed gives Hetterich's ticket an edge in approachability. The diverse background from each can­didate will balance the three offices and the leadership will reflect a democratic style. 
"Changes" is the theme of Hetterich's ticket. This is critical to our endorsement as it is important to have a fresh outlook and change in the traditional positions for student body offices. 
Although none of the women on the Hetterich ticket has served as a student body officer before, this will not restrict their ability to learn and lead. 
The Hetterich ticket touched upon the importance of the religious aspect of Saint Mary's as a women's college. This is crucial to the development of Saint Mary's. 
Notre Dame can learn a great deal from the Saint Mary's student government. The seriousness and true concern of the students was evident at Monday night's debate. Student involvement has increased under Jeanne Heller's current administration. 
We commend the Saint Mary's student body for their eagerness and ambition; last year at this time there was only one ticket for student body office. It is encouraging to see three serious and dedicated tickets. 
We feel the ticket of Eileen Hetterich, Smith Hashagen and Julie Parrish is best for its well-roundedness, versatility and enthusiasm. They deserve your vote.

Game's physical finish blurs image of teams 
Dear Editor: 
Pangborn, give us a break. You have managed to paint a biased and un­deserved portrait of Sorin Hall. Mr. Shallow and Mr. Schreder made it look like the Pangborn team wore halos and the Sorin team played with three pronged hockey sticks. Anyone who was not at the game has an image of an angelic, innocent and peaceful Pangborn team taking the ice against a violent, destructive, and unsportman­like Sorin team. This is not what hap­pened. 
Could you please answer the follow­ing questions for us, Pangborn? Whose team has the word "violence" emblazened on the backs of their uni­forms? Which team had a player who started a minor fight early in the game? What team repeatedly slapped the op­posing team's goalie while he was lying on the puck? (It's real sportsmanlike to strike someone while they're down on their back.) Whose team had a player who tried to seek revenge after being checked and then hurled insults and spit at the fans? 
Granted, Marin did check a Pangborn player shortly after the goalie incident; however, it was not a "cheap hit." The Pangborn player saw him coming from far less than ten strides away. After the check Marin was tackled by the players and then fell to the ice. This is when the Pangborn player was cut. The injury was unfor­tunate, but injuries happen especially in hockey. Hockey is not golf. There is physical contact. Contrary to popular belief the injured player was not kicked intentionally. Common sense would seem to prove this. If he had been kicked far greater damage would have been done than a superficial wound. 
After the check, the whistle was blown and the penalty called. Marin skated towards the bench and away from the action. He was obeying the refs. When the ref asked him to stop skating, he was attacked by the Pangborn player who continued his at­tack despite the referee's pleas. If Pangborn had honored the whistle, the ensuing melee never would have hap­pened.

The Sorin fans have also come under fire. Welcome to the real world of hock­ey. Fans cheer that way. Sorin fans cheer with an underlying sense of humor and sarcasm. We go out to have fun. We joke about penalties and checks. 
The purpose of this letter is not to justify our actions in the game but rather to present the other side of the story. Sorin is getting a reputation that is not entirely deserved. Both teams were physical, Pangborn probably more so. It just so happens that one of their players got hurt first. Each team has the same amount of penalty minutes and the Pangborn bench cleared before Sorin's. We did not pick on them. It is unfortunate the game ended that way, but it's not as cut and dry as you make it seem. You're hardly as innocent as the picture your presi­dent paints.

Student interest vital to government's ability 
Dear Editor: 
Regardless of the years and the hopes of the past, student government must always look to the future. In order to be successful, officers must live up to the expectations of their peers. Truly, that is the bulk of the position. As a friend, one must be reponsible, under­standing and constantly working for a better relationship. One would expect just as much from a student govern­ment representative. Everyone must realize the vital role they play in issues, decisions and activities. If the officers do not address the needs and wants of the students, then the government is not serving its purpose. Officers can only insure a good student government in one way, students must be willing to get involved and to voice their opinions. Take the first step VOTE -it does make the difference.

Reilly steps down as business dean, takes leave 
Will visit markets in London, Tokyo 
By JIM RILEY Business Page Editor 
Frank Reilly, dean of the Col­lege of Business Adminstra­tion, will retire as dean this May and take a one-year leave of absence. During his leave, he will focus his attention on the internationalization of se­curities markets and visit the exchanges in both London and Tokyo. 
He will return to teaching and research after his leave. 
Reilly has been dean of the college for the past five and a half years. His tenure as dean officially ends after this year's graduation. 
A good deal of his leave of absence will be devoted to study of the internationaliza­tion of securities markets. He said that in the past, the United States concentrated only on the market in New York, and busi­ness schools and textbooks gave only passing mention to the other securities markets in the world. 
But today, the international securities markets are "one big, connected ring with trading going on 24 hours a day," according to Reilly, with the main trading centers being in New York, London, and Tokyo. 
So that he can integrate this theme throughout his textbooks when he revises them, he said he will undertake an intensive study of the rele­vant literature, and he will take a first-hand look at markets abroad. 
Reilly will travel to London for a few weeks and spend about two weeks in Tokyo. 
Reilly said there are two main reasons why he is quitting as dean. "The long term desire was to go back to teaching and research," said Reilly, citing this as the more important rea­son. He said the initial commit­ment as dean was for five and a half years with an optional extension if both he and the ad­ministration agreed to it. But he said that if he stayed an­

other five and a half years, it would be very difficult to go back to teaching and research. The other reason for the 
dean's departure is that "there 
are other things I wanted to do 
that you just can't do when you 
are a dean," said Reilly. An ex­
ample of these things would be 
editing a series of books for a 
publisher. 
Reilly said that one of the best things about being dean is "you are in a postion to effect 
change." He said that as dean he did not have to convince a group of 10 other people before he could do something. With the permission of the provost, he could go ahead and implement his idea. 
Reilly said he will spend a great deal of time just catching up on the literature and jour­nals in the business field that he has not had the time to keep up with during the past years. 
Reilly's duties as dean in­cluded administration of cur­rent programs, development of new programs, and expansion of old ones. He also did ''development work,'' which he said is basically fundraising. 
"The notion of development is a major function the dean has to be involved in," said Reilly. Program expansion requires money, and the dean plays a large role in raising that money, according to Reilly. 
Reilly also has played a part in the recruitment of faculty. He said there have been five to seven openings per year, meaning that 20 to 25 people had to be interviewed each of those years. 
Reilly also dealt with the im­portant visitors and speakers who came to campus. "You meet some wonderful people," said Reilly. "That's been a real bonus for the job." 
He jokingly added that his job has given him the opportu­nity to have dinner with Uni­versity President Father Theodore.Hesburgh about once a month. 
While dean, Reilly has also continued to teach. He taught a graduate course and worked with the executive programs. He has been able to revise his books, but he said it was hard to find the time. 
He has also written one or two articles each year and has done some research, but not as much as he would like to have done. 
But as time-consuming as being an administrator has been, he said, "It was a great experience. I enjoyed it, and I wouldn't trade the last five years. 
He also said he feels he ac­complished a great deal of what he wanted to do. 
During his tenure as dean, Reilly initiated an executive MBA program. The regular MBA progran increased in size from 150 to 250 students. An executive development de­partment was set up which of­fers non-credit courses for ex­ecutives. The executive development programs run for varying lengths of time, and there are 20 to 30 such pro­grams each year. 
Also, a center for research in business has been established. Such a center is necessary "to attract and retain really good research faculty," according to Reilly. The center provides research assistants, typing ser­vices, and database fac~lities. 

Investment banking firms compete for student recruits 
With the investment bankers interviewing on campus this month, many Domers would like to learn about how investment bankers compete for recruits. 
To begin, one should take a look at the atmosphere for Notre Dame undergraduates. Kitty Arnold of Career Placement has noticed that "it's very com­petitive for students anywhere to get jobs with im­nvestment bankers." 
Still, undergraduates and MBA's here are getting offers to start their fast-paced career tracks on Wall Street. "More and more investment bankers are interviewing on this campus," according to Arnold. Indeed, Paine Webber has added its name to this year's list list already featuring such big names as First Boston, Drexel Burnham, and five others. 
These institutions come here in search of hard­driving students who show quantitative ability and leadership skills. These institutions generally look for economics and finance majors, but offers have gone to English and engineering specialists as well, indicating that the students' programs are not as important as their motivation. 
Typically, each firm will talk to two or three dozen prospects; three or four at most will eventually work their way to job offers. For example, last year the Wall Street companies extended 21 offers, and Domers took 13 of them. 
The positions they accept take the form of two­year analyst programs. Upon completion, these ac­hievers often enter MBA programs. This track for ND undergrads contrasts sharply with the recruit­
ing at major graduate schools of business. 
Alex Vonderhaar 
Business Bits 
The Wall Street Journal recently described the race for these MBA's: 
First, salaries commonly range around $28,000 for those with bachelor's degrees from Notre Dame, while those with Wharton and Harvard MBA's start at twice that rate. Second, with the MBA's, the firms are competing for the students rather than the other way around because their terms usually last more two years. 
Despite the insider trading publicity over the course of the last year, graduates are still attracted by fast living and big payoffs. Students regard the scandals as the exception, not the rule. "The chal­lenge that every MBA faces,'' says Stanford ethics professor Kirk Hanson, "is how to balance that drive for money and power with the drives to be a family person and to serve the community." 
Achieving that balance is becoming more diffi­cult. According to a survey at Duke's Fuqua School of Business, 87 percent of the students believed that insider trading was common in the industry. 
Still, "our students are concerned but not to the extent that they'd want to go into another field," claims one dean at Fuqua. 
The results back this up. The big investment banking firms won nearly a third of the graduating MBA's from Harvard and Columbia last year. 
Business schools themselves have had to consider adding seminars on ethical behavior for their stu­dents. While Stanford added one this past fall, stu­dents remain skeptical. In fact, 61 percent of the Fuqua survey said they doubted that the schools could even teach ethical behavior. 
Thus, Notre Dame students should feel fortunate for a couple of reasons. We have opportunities to soar as high as the movers and shakers on Wall Street. We also have the chance to use the values that our education gave to us.

Telxon chief set to kick off Finance Club's lecture series 
Special to the Observer 
Raymond Meyo, president and chief executive officer of Telxon corporation, will speak this afternoon at 4 p.m. as part of this year's Finance Forum. 
Meyo, a 1964 Notre Dame graduate, will give a presenta­tion entitled ''The Story of Entrepreneurship." 
When Meyo came to Telxon, they were almost bankrupt, but he turned the company around, according to Dave Jacobi, a vice president of the Notre Dame Finance Club, which is sponsoring the forum. 
Meyo teamed with Robert Meyerson, another Telxon offi­cer, to bring Telxon from a net loss position in 1979 to its cur­rent position as the world's leading producer of portable tele-transaction computers, said Jacobi. 
The main purpose of the Finance Forum is to allow stu­dents to go beyond the theory of the classroom and get a look at the real world, said Jacobi. 
The Twenty-ninth Annual Finance Forum continues Wed­nesday with presentations by Robert Kiley, chairman of the board of the State of New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and Paul Schierl, president and CEO of Fort Howard Paper Company. 
This year's speakers are all Notre Dame alumni. 
Meyo recently donated $1 million toward the construction of an athletic facility which will be named in his honor, accor­ding to Jacobi.

Gymnastic Club performs well d~espite early problems 
While the Gymnastics Club has more members than usual this year, it has been outstanding indi­vidual performances that have highlighted the squad's season so far. 
In the Miami of Ohio Invitational two weeks ago, the men's team finished third out of four teams and the women placed second of three teams. Junior Jen Hoover captured the women's all­around title, and junior Paul Nowak was the top gymnast for the Irish men. 
During last weekend's dual meet with the Uni­versity of Chicago, which the women's team won and the men's team lost, Nowak turned in his second consecutive strong effort to win the men's all-around competition. 
The fact that the club is even competing is some­what fortunate, as the teams could not get a coach until Sandy Vanslager stepped in over a month into the year. 
"Without her, we wouldn't be here," said Club President Matt Sennett. "We missed out on a lot of fall training. We have only four meets this year because we aren't that prepared." 
Notre Dame will compete in the Purdue Golden Grips on Feb.28, and will end the year with the first annual Notre Dame Invitational on March 
28. 

"There's been a lot of improvement. We have a lot of new people, and they've made a lot of good strides for the future. It's really looking good be­cause we have a lot of young people on both the men's and women's teams," said Sennett. "We had a really good recruiting year as far as getting people out and keeping them enthusiastic. We made a real effort to go out of our way to help the new people." 
Steve Megargee 
Club Corner 

The Irish defeated Calvin College, 15-6,15-6,15-9, in the first round on Friday. In the championship, the Irish met Bowling Green, which had Defeated Notre Dame two weeks earlier. This time, the Irish 
came out on top, 15-8,15-10,12-15,15-11. 
"When we lost to Bowling Green, we had played five matches that day, and they just cleaned up on us. This time, we started off slow, and it was kind of touch and go at first, then we took off," said Club Secretary Steve Kranz. "After that, ex­cept for that one game we let slip, we really played well. It was all defense and serving that won it for us. Service errors were almost nil." 
Earlier in the week, the Irish knocked off Grand Valley State, 15-6,15-11,15-8, and Toledo, 15-5,15­5,15-6. The entire second unit played for the first time together in the last two games of the Grand Valley State match, and was led by Tony Perez. 
Notre Dame was scheduled to play at Ball State, currently ranked eighth in the nation, last night. The Irish are back in the ACC Pit tonight at 7:30 for another match with Calvin College. 
The Women's Soccer Club was able to tie In­diana, 1-1 in the first round of the Saint Mary's Invitational Tournament on Sunday. Forced to play their second game of the indoor tournament just one hour later, the Irish could not keep up the momentum, and were ambushed, 12-0, by a varsity program from Michigan State.

Irish halt Crusaders' quest as McManus leads swimmers 
By KELLY TOWNSEND Sports Writer 
In the closing dual meet of the season, the Notre Dame men's and women's swim teams took their own crusade to Valparaiso m Saturday. The attack was led by three Irish kings :md two queens in what became, for part of the time, a slaughter. 
The three kings led their own crusade against the Crusaders, gaining places in many of the ke) ~vents. In the 200-yard individual medley, junior Pat McManus con­quered the oppostion using his speed in the butterfly portion of the medley to gain the upper hand. 
Following McManus' exam­ple, sophmore David Thoman captured a place in both the 50­yard freestyle and 100-yard backstroke, while fellow soph­omore David Ledrick grabbed first in the 200-and 500-yard freestyle events with personal bests. 
The men came out with an overwhelming 81-21 victory over Valparaiso and a very pleased coach. 
"The men had a great day and their perfomances show that we're not far from giving anyone in the country a good race," said Head Coach Tim Welsh. "With the team so strong, the seniors were able to try new events and have a great time." 
The Irish women had a toug­her time in their contest, but emerged triumphant with im­pressive performances by two young ladies. 
Switching from her accus­tomed slot in the back-stroke, freshman Mary Acampora went head-to-head with Val­paraiso in the 1000-yard frees­tyle to take first place. Her times were consistent with those of the regular swimmers. 
Another swimmer making a transition was freestyler Kathy Quirk. She took first in the 100­yard back-stroke following it up with a first place finish in the 200-yard individual medley with a personal best of 2: 16.5. 
Coach Welsh cited the good balance of ability as a major help in Saturday's 65-84 win. 
"We're able to put people in new events and have consistent times," said Welsh. "This gives us confidence and keeps us excited. I'm happy with the girls. They have a lot to be proud of." 

SMC speeds by Grace 
By GLORIA ELEUTERI Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's basketball squad defeated its 11th op­ponent of the year Saturday, downing Grace College by a score of 54-45. 
Grace came out trying to con­trol the tempo of the game, but they only managed to keep things slow for part of the first half as the Belles were able to quicken the tempo before the end of the half. The score was 26-23 as the teams headed for the lockerroom. 
"The reason the score was close at the half was due to the many turnovers that we had," said Head Coach Marvin Wood. "We were able to correct the problem in the second half which enabled us to pull ahead with a stronger lead." 
The lead was increased to a nine-point spread nine minutes into the half. This was attrib­uted to the strong rebounding, increased pressure on defense and better shot selection. Also, a more balanced team contri­bution was made this game. 
The only two to score in double figures were Tammye and Julie Radke with 16 and 12 points respectively. An addi­tional eight points were added by Ann Gallagher, while Donna Wolfe and Kris Pantelleria netted six apiece. Besides her field goal contributions, Wolfe lead the team with five rebounds, while six other players pulled down four rebounds each. 
In his best season ever while coaching at Saint Mary's, Wood expressed satisfaction in the team's ablility to come on strong in the second half. 
In their final game of the season, the Belles host Purdue Calumet on Thursday at 7 p.m_ The decision for postseason ac­tion does not come until Feb. 22.
