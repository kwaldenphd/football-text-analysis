51 cited in raid on The Library 
BY TERESA FRALISH Associate News Editor 

Authorities cited 51 underage patrons for underage drinking and possession of false identification during the raid on The Library Irish Pub early Friday morning, police said. 
Police issued a total of 75 citations for "minor in a tavern" and posses­sion of false identification to patrons of the bar, said Lt. Greg Deitchley, a spokesman for the District 1 office of the Indiana State Excise Police. 
Deitchley could not say if any of those cited were not Notre Dame or Saint Mary's students. About 200 to 300 people were inside the bar at the time of the raid, he estimated. 
The bust, conducted by members of excise police, Indiana State Police and South Bend Police, came after a complaint was filed three weeks ago about underage patrons consuming alcohol at the bar, Deitchley said. After an investigation that con­firmed the complaint, excise police began planning for the raid. 
Excise police brought campus phonebooks to the bust to help iden­tify Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. "We have campus phone­books that we've had for quite a while," Deitchley said. 
The Friday raid on The Library Irish Pub was the second on the bar at 113 East Wayne Street. Police also. raided the bar, then called Finnegan's Irish Pub, in October 2000, which resulted in citations for 147 underage patrons. Because of legal action. the bar's owners were forced to seJI the establishment and the bar was renamed. However, many students still call the bar by its old name. 
The raid on The Library Irish Pub was also the second bar raid this year. Police busted The Boat Club Jan. 24 and issued citations to 213 minors. It was not immediately clear if any students cited in Friday's raid were also cited at The Boat Club. 
Authorities expect to forward the list of those cited to the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission this week. NDSP also expects to receive a list of Notre Dame stu­dents cited which they will then for­ward to Residence Life, said Rex Rakow. director of NDSP. 
Notre Dame students will likely face punishment both in court and at school. 

Those cited for "minor in a tav­ern," a Class C misdemeanor. can receive up to a $500 fine, six months in jail and the confiscation of their driver's license. However, most minors have been able to receive pretrial diversion in previ­ous bar busts, paying court costs and completing community service hours. 
Notre Dame students will likely face additional action from the University. Penalties for students involved in similar raids have included fines and community ser­

Chemistry professor dies at 73 
By ANDREW THAGARD News Writer 
The Notre Dame community will mourn the loss of Rudolph "Rudy" Bottei during a burial Mass scheduled tomorrow at Christ the King Catholic Church. The professor and assistant chair of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry succumbed to cancer Wednesday. He was 73. 
Bottei, a member of the Notre Dame faculty since 1955, continued to teach environmental chemistry and freshman chemistry classes through the first half of this semester. 
As his condition deteriorated, Bottei was moved to the Hospice House in South Bend. His daughter addressed his environmental chemistry class Tuesday, assuring students that her father was comfortable and enjoying the attention of family and visitors, but that he would only live a short time longer. 
Colleagues and students remembered Bottei fondly. 
"It seemed like he cared a lot about students," said Danielle Ledesma, a senior environmental science major. "He made class entertaining and enjoy­able." 
Students said they liked Bottei's ten­dency to intersperse wit and practical advice into his lectures. In addition to teaching chemistry, Bottei instructed his students to avoid procrastination, make the most out of the day or "prime time," drink lots of water, use it or lose it and treat people nice in order to find success at Notre Dame and at life in

'Here come the Irish' sells out after debut 
By MATT BRAMANTI News Writer 
The sea of green will con­tinue. 
Student organizers revealed this year's iteration of The Shirt in a Friday press conference at the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore. 
The theme of the new Kelly-green shirt is "Here Come the Irish." The design is similar to that of last year's shirt, which featured the motto, "Return to Glory." 
The design on the front features the motto "Here Come the Irish" and "Notre Dame Football 2003" super­imposed over a dark green shamrock. The back sports a picture of the football team running out of the stadium tunnel. The text reads "There's a magic in the sound of her name. Here come the Irish of Notre Dame." 
The words are lyrics from 

a song entitled "Here Come the Irish," written by Notre Dame alumnus John Scully. The song has also been fea­tured in a popular Notre 
Dame promotional video of the same name. 
Plans are underway to re­release the song for the 2003 football season, O'Connor said, adding, "It'll be written and produced by Notre Dame graduates."

fact, they have been looking for this new set of 2,000 stu­Systems dents for over a Administrator year. Other than the fact that they are looking for students who will further improve their own image and in turn bring even more shiny. homogeneous, and most importantly, complacent boys and girls, I don't have any problem with the idea of recruiting by itself. 
What I do object to is the University's obsession with its image to the point that it diverts resources from its current stu­dents in order to draw in its future ones. A perfect example ofthis can be found without looking any further than the University's academic Web site, www.nd.edu. 
As soon as you load the page, the University wants to know to which group you belong: prospective students, cur­rent students, faculty and staff, alumni, parents, or visitors so that they may treat you accordingly. From the prospective students site, click on the "admissions" link at the top, which brings you to http://admissions.nd.edu. It's a flashy and attention-grabbing web page com­plete with java animation, links to two real video and QuickTime movies and a nice posed picture of a student having an intimate conversation with a University administrator in his office with sunshine and green plants outside of the window. The last time I remember having an inti­mate conversation with an administrator in an office like that was my ResLlf e meeting. 
To get back to my point, there was clearly more money and time spent on this Web site than the main Web site which current Notre Dame students use, http://www.nd.edu/current. It is true that building a Web site costs relatively little compared to other expenses, but this disparity is representative ofthe University's overall priorities. One may argue that the University would not be where it is now ifit were not for its devo­tion to academic recruiting and there would be no future for Notre Dame ifit did not look to it now. Recruiting is fine, but I am concerned with the administra­tion's priorities -first maintain and improve the University's image by attracting future students and prospec­tive alumni donors. then attend to stu­dents. 
And another thing, examine the Main Building itself. Compare the admissions department to the Office of Residence Llfe and Housing, for students, and the Office of Student Affairs. The admissions department is right inside the front door, expensively furnished, with plenty of plenty of office space, while up away on the third floor, the ResLlfe office greets you with a wall right away, and it looks like a scene out ofOffice Space. I ask the administration to balance its priorities as they should be, with current students first, and maybe even in the process they might attract more prospective students

Students in lawsuit to meet this week 
By TERESA FRALISH Asrnciate News Editor 
Student government will hold a meeting either Tuesday or Thursday this week to assist students who received court summons last week for citations incurred during the Jan. 24 police raid on The Boat Club. 
"\Ve've gotten responses from over 100 students," said Pat Hallahan, student body president. 
Student government sent out an e-mail last week ask­ing students who received summons to contact them by phone or e-mail and responses are still coming in, said Hallahan. 
According to Hallahan, students are still receiving summons, a process that began .last Tuesday. 
At the meeting, student government will provide stu­dents access to legal advice, Hallahan said. "We've spo­ken to a couple attorneys," 

he said. 
Hallahan said he and oth­ers would continue to look at additional options and plan to work on the possibility of combining the lawsuits or getting the hearing dates changed. Hearings are scheduled for early August, a time when most students involved in the suits will not be in the South Bend area. 
The lawsuits are being brought in the St. Joseph County Small Claims Court by Millennium Club, a corpo­ration solely controlled by Mike McNeff, the owner of Boat Club, and request $3,000 in damages from each student. Millennium Club alleges that the stu­dents cited in the Jan. 24 raid caused excessive legal and financial burden to the bar. A total of 213 minors were cited in the January raid.

SOUTH KOREA 




Atomic weapons talks stall 
Associated Press 
SEOUL 
South Korea demanded Sunday that North Korea abandon any atomic weapons development, but Northern negotiators in Pyongyang stonewalled the nuclear discussion. 
Chief North Korean dele gate Kim Ryong Song refused to confirm a claim by a North Korean envoy in last week's talks with U.S. officials in Beijing that Pyongyang has nuclear weapons. 
Instead, Kim sought to steer the Cabinet-level talks toward inter-Korean eco­nomic projects, Seoul offi­cials said. 
Washington believes North Korea has one or two atomic bombs and may be trying to make more. The North has long disputed that claim, saying its nuclear program is meant to generate much­needed electricity. Some analysts suggested the North was bluffing. 
But in last week's talks in Beijing, North Korean dele­gate Ri Gun told Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly that North Korea has nuclear weapons, a senior 
U.S. official in Washington said. 
Possession of nuclear weapons would be a 'serious violation' of a 1992 inter­Korean agreement to keep the peninsula nuclear-free, South Korean Unification Minister Jeong Se-hyun reminded North Korea, according to South Korean government spokesman Shin Eun-sang.

CHINA 

Government announces 21 more SARS deaths 
Associated Press 
BEIJING 
Karaoke parlors, movie the­aters and discos shut their doors Sunday under orders from Beijing officials trying to contain the spread of SARS, which claimed more lives in the Chinese capital, Hong Kong, Taipei, Singapore and Toronto. 
As Beijing health officials recorded eight new deaths and said as many as 2,300 people might be infected, hundreds of construction workers labored around the clock to build a 1,000-bed isolation ward for SARS patients. A ninth person died elsewhere in mainland China, bringing its total to 131, and 12 more died in Hong Kong. 
Taiwan, which reported its first SARS death, imposed a manda­tory 10-day quarantine on trav­elers from areas affected by the virus -including mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam and Toronto. But offi­cials did not announce where those travelers would stay while quarantined. 
Those violating the quarantine, including foreigners, can be jailed for up to two years or fined up to $8,600, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said. 

Trying to stem panic over the flu-like disease, the World Health Organization said Sunday there was still time to keep SARS from spreading globally if affect­ed countries take strong enough action, and through travel warn­ings and checks of travelers for symptoms, such as fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. 
WHO planned on Monday to designate Vietnam as the world's first country to success­fully contain its outbreak. No new cases have been reported there since April 8 -meeting the window of 20 days, or twice the disease's incubation period, set by the WHO as the standard for declaring that the outbreak is no longer spreading. 
"1 think we still have a window of opportunity. ... At the moment, we still have a chance to contain it and to have it go down in the places where out­breaks are already happening and avoid it spreading to new countries," WHO director Gro Brundtland said in an interview on the British Broadcasting Corp. 
The WHO has issued travel warnings for affected areas, including regions of China and Toronto, which reported its 21st victim on Sunday. Canada has the biggest outbreak of SARS

Presid~ntial election appears to be headed for run-off 
Associated Press 

BUENOS AIRES 
Former President Carlos Menem and rival Peronist Nestor Kirchner ran neck­and-neck ahead of a crowded field in Argentina's presidential vote on Sunday, first official results and exit polls showed. 
With 5 percent of the ballot tallied, Menem led with 25 percent of the vote ­a whisker ahead of the 23 percent for Kirchner, the governor of the oil-rich Patagonian province of Santa Cruz . 
Ricardo Lopez Murphy. a free-market economist and former economy minister, trailed in third with 17 percent. 
Exit polls released by the television sta­tions Cronica, AmericaTV, and TodoNoticia, suggested both Menem and Kirchner would be heading to a second round on May 18. 
The independent Cronica television net­work gave Menem 29 percent to 21 per­cent for Kirchner and 18 percent for Murphy. Other exit polls did not release their final figures. 
To win outright, a candidate needs to capture at least 45 percent of the vote or finish with at least 40 percent and a lead of 10 percentage points over the closest rival. 
Menem, who dominated Argentine poli­tics as a flamboyant and unabashed free­market advocate from 1989 to 1999, had held a narrow lead in most pre-election polls. 
He smiled broadly as the first presiden­tial candidate to vote Sunday, surrounded by chanting well-wishers in his home state of La Rioja in western Argentina. 
Hundreds of well-wishers mobbed the 72-year-old former leader after he voted shouting "Mr. President!" His wife, the former Miss Universe Cecilia Bolocco, was not on hand. 
Lopez Murphy, who with his walrus mustache and weighty Jowls is known as "the Bulldog," cast his ballot in Buenos Aires, telling reporters that voters had a serious choice to make, with their very economic future at stake. 
"This is a day of great responsibility," he said. 
Some 25.7 million voters registered for the election, which was conducted peace­fully as soldiers stood guard at many of the 66,735 polling stations nationwide. It was Argentina's fifth election since democracy was restored following the end of a military dictatorship in 1983.

IRA agrees to dispose of more weapons 
The Irish Republican Army is willing to scrap more weapons, but only if Protestant leaders agree to resume power-sharing in Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein chief Gerry Adams said Sunday. Adams ­whose party is resisting pressure from the British, Irish and American governments to demonstrate the IHA's total renunciation of violence -insisted the organization was willing to get rid of all its weapons and demonstrate its "completely peaceful intent." He said the IRA, which led disarmament otlicials to a few weapons dumps in October 2001 and April 2002, had already agreed to allow "a third act of putting arms beyond use ... at the earliest opportu­nity" if there is agreement on resuming the power­sharing. He didn't specify whether the IRA was offering to get rid of all its arms stockpiles in one major act or slowly over years, as has been the case so far. Police estimate the group retains 100 tons of largely Libyan-supplied weaponry.

Utah cities rank first in philanthropy 
Among the nation's major metropolitan areas, residents of Salt Lake City-Ogden are the nation's most generous. and people in Hartford Conn., are the least, according to a study by the Chronicle of Philanthropy. 
Salt Lake City-Ogden residents who itemized their federal tax deductions gave nearly 15 per­cent of their discretionary income to religious and nonprofit causes, according to the study being published Monday. The runner-up was Michigan's Grand Rapids-Muskegon-Holland area at 10 per­cent. Hartford, Conn., was the nation's least-gen­erous metropolitan area, with 4. 7 percent of dis­cretionary income going to charities, the study found. 
The study analyzed 1997 tax data for households earning more than $50,000 a year that itemized deductions, including charity donations, on their tax returns. 
Chinese may have donated to campaigns 
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Lieberman is asking for a federal investigation into whether an alleged double agent illegally funneled Chinese money into U.S. political campaigns. Katrina Leung, a Southern California businesswoman who was paid $1.7 million as an FBI informant, also was a Republican activist and donor to candidates and the Republican Party. And she was arrested on April 9 as a suspected spy for China. Court documents accuse Leung, 49, of a long list of security breaches including tipping off Chinese authorities to a search by U.S. agents for nuclear secrets in China and revealing names of FBI agents investigating Chinese spying in this country. Lieberman, ranking Democrat on the Senate Government Affairs Committee, wrote a letter to Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller demand­ing an investigation into whether any of the money she gave was from the Chinese government.

HAITI 

Catholics pray for miracles at conference 
Associated Press 
PORT-AU-PRINCE 

Crowded under canopies. some 90,000 Haitians prayed Sunday for miracles to cure the array of ills bedeviling their nation, among the world's poorest. 
Some fell into trances. others pleaded for cures for physical ailments or even just a little money to survive. 
Dozens raised Haitian pass­ports to heaven and prayed that U.S. consular officers would be compassionate and grant them visas to escape their poverty. 
Only carnival festivities attract more people than the annual Catholic Charismatic Conference in the Caribbean nation of 8 million. 
"Its success reflects our deepening despair and lack of confidence in rational solutions to Haiti's mounting economic and social problems," said soci­ologist Laennec Hurbon, who works for the Paris-based National Center for Scientific Research. 
"People believe that only mir­acles can save them," he said of the crowds thronging the grounds of St. Louis de Gonzague School in suburban Delmas. 
Many of the worshippers were from the Protestant Pentecostal movement. Others follow a homegrown voodoo fusion of West African and Roman Catholic beliefs. The three-day Homan Catholic meeting ends Sunday. 
"The only solution to the problems of our nation is the best solution, faith in Jesus," said Gertha Lucie Louissaint, 36. 
Haiti has endured 20 years of political instability. Its most recent crisis started since flawed 2000 legislative elec­tions swept by President Jean­Bertrand Aristide's Lavalas Family party. International donors froze $500 million in aid because of irregularities in the vote. 
Street gangs claiming links to Aristide's party have attacked demonstrators, journalists and opposition politicians. 

People have long turned to the gods to ease their suffering. 
"What do I know about poli­tics?" said Yvann Pierre-Louis, a 40-year-old widow with seven children. "I have nobody but Jesus to turn to in my dis­tress." 
Conference participants paid about $4.50 to cover the costs of the rented canopies, chairs and parasols that were handed out during the ceremony. 
Outside, scores of others who could not afford the fee listened to the exhortations and hymns blaring through speakers. 
"Down with Satan!" Trinidadian Rev. Yan Taylor yelled, stamping his foot as if that would put down the forces of evil. 
"Hallelujah! Amen!" roared the tens of thousands who raised their hands in the air in unison, invoking the Holy Spirit to defeat the powers of dark­ness. 
"Everything's possible when you believe in God," they sang. 
Several people claimed they were cured. A man climbed the podium to say he had recov­ered his hearing, but his ram­bling responses to questions left the crowd in doubt. 
But applause met the stum­bling steps of a teenage boy, said to have been crippled for years, who walked falteringly after a priest laid hands on his head and prayed. 
Millions in Haiti place faith in voodoo. The religion evolved from West African beliefs and developed further among slaves in the Caribbean who adopted elements of Catholicism. 
In an executive decree earli­er this month, Aristide invited voodoo adherents and organi­zations to register with the Ministry of Religious Affairs. 
Aristide, a former Roman Catholic priest, has said he rec­ognizes voodoo as a religion like any other, and a voodoo priestess bestowed a presiden­tial sash on him at his first inauguration in 1991.

Since the 30-year military dic­tatorship of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner ended in 1989, Paraguay's fledgling democracy has stumbled through political crises, coup attempts, and assassinations.

Duarte, as president-elect, will be hard-pressed to ease ram­pant crime and endemic corrup­tion. 
The Colorado Party has ruled uninterrupted for nearly six decades, and critics openly questioned its continued rule after the party's failure to solve such intractable problems. 
Some voters who opposed Duarte, said they did so because of his party, not the candidate. 
"Duarte may be a good man, but we've had enough of the Colorados," said one voter, 37­year-old Carlos Algaraz.

AA avoids immediate bankruptcy 
Flight attendants at American Airlines agreed Friday to concessions that the compa­ny said it needed to avoid bankruptcy. Following approval a day earlier by the carri­er's two other unions. the flight attendants' decision allowed American to avoid an imme­diate Chapter 11 filing. But the company's new chief executive said the world's largest carrier still has much work to do. Leaders of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants had been badly split over a con­cessions offer that the company sweetened this week, with lingering anger aimed at Donald Carty, who resigned as chairman and chief executive late Thursday. 

Amtrak plans upgrades, route cuts 
Amtrak will renovate Civil War-era tunnels and replace overhead electrical wires installed when Franklin Roosevelt was presi­dent under a five-year upgrade plan announced Friday. Amtrak President David Gunn's plan would ignore calls for eliminating a number of money-losing long-distance trains and would keep the railroad's high­speed service at existing levels. The quasi-pri­vate passenger service came under pressure from Congress last year after announcing that 18 of the long-haul runs would be scrapped to save money. 

Decision favors Internet file-sharing 
Two companies behind services for sharing music and movies over the Internet are not to blame for any illegal copying conducted by the services' users, a federal judge rul'ed Friday. The ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Wilson was a major blow to recording companies and movie studios, which have been aggressively filing lawsuits and pushing new laws to stem the illegal copying and distribution of their copyright works. The decision, if it survives appeal, essentially absolves Grokster Ltd. and StreamCast Networks Inc. of liability.

Saudi Arabia launches telethon to raise funds 
 Saudis raise money for needy Iraqis affected by U .S.-led war 
Associated Press 
RIYAHDH 
Saudi Arabia launched a telethon Sunday to raise money for Iraqis affected by the U.S.­led war, the official Saudi Press Agency said. 
More than $9.2 million was raised in the first seven hours, the agency reported. 
"Our aid for the afflicted in the world is not for earthly purposes or publicity objec­tives," Nayef said. "Such aid is guided by our Islamic princi­ples and authentic values." 
The news agency reported that the prince donated about $533,000 to the Iraqis, while his deputy, Prince Ahmed bin Abdel-Aziz, donated about $266,000. King Fahd donated $2.7 million. The agency did not say how long the donation drive would last.

The telethon, which was called by the oil-rich state's King Fahd, was held as part of Saudi Arabia's com­mitment to help Muslims all over the world, Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef told state-run tele­vision.

Baghdad ~mayor' arrested 
. Shiite group signals cooperation as U.S. readies political conference 
Associated Press 

BAGHDAD 
The U.S. military arrested a political pretender in Baghdad on Sunday, while a Shiite Muslim group signaled a new willingness to cooperate on the eve of a pivotal U.S.-sponsored conference to help form a pro­visional government for Iraq. 
The arrest of Mohammed Mohsen al-Zubaidi reflected 
U.S. determination to brook no interlopers in its effort to build a consensus for administering Iraq. Timed just before today's high-profile conference, it sent a clear message: Don't meddle. 
Al-Zubaidi was a returned exile associated with the oppo­sition Iraqi National Congress who had declared himself mayor of Baghdad without sanction from U.S. occupation authorities. U.S. Central Command on Sunday accused him of "subversion." 
His activities, including desig­nation of "committees" to run city affairs, had complicated the efforts of postwar U.S. civil administrator Jay Garner to reorganize political life. A U.S. military spokesman said al­Zubaidi was arrested "for exer­cising authority which was not 
h.
IS. " 

Central Command accused al-Zubaidi and his associates of "obstructing the normal means of governance for their own self-interests," particularly by claiming control over the power company and other utili­ties. 
In a statement, the command said it warned al-Zubaidi to stop his actions. "He instead ... continued his subversive actions," it said. 
Monday's conference, second in a series likely to extend well into May, was expected to attract 300 to 400 delegates from political organizations that had opposed Saddam Hussein and from other Iraqi interest groups, said a Garner deputy, Barbara Bodine. 
The first meeting was held April 15 in Ur, in southern Iraq, just a week after U.S. troops took control of the Iraqi capital and ousted the Saddam government. Fewer than 100 Iraqis participated, many of them exiles, as some Shiites and others stayed away in protest of potential U.S. influ­ence over selection of a new Iraqi president. 
But in a sign that Shiite resis-

tance may be easing, one key Shiite group that shunned the Ur conference -the Iran­based Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq ­indicated it might attend on Monday. 
"No definite decision has been taken so far. We have been invited and will most probably attend," leading member Mohsen Hakim told AP in Tehran. 
Bodine told reporters, "I think we are going to see more of an indigenous representa­tion, simply because we've had more time to organize." 
"There's going to be a lot of leadership emerging," she said. No obvious presidential choice has appeared thus far, howev­er, and Bodine would not be drawn out on names. "I wouldn't know today who that's going to be."

rights. Their three-day meeting was sponsored by Spain's govern­ment, which was a staunch supporter of the U.S.-led attack on Saddam's regime. 
The conference in Ur agreed on a set of 13 principles, among them that Iraq must be democratic, Saddam's Baath Party must be dissolved and a future government should be organized as a federal system -the last point an acknowl­edgment of the difficulty of cen­trally governing a land and society divided be(ween Sunni and Shiite Muslims, Kurds and Arabs. 
The series of conferences is to produce an "interim authori­ty" led by a new president that would pave the way for a con­stitution and democratic elec­tions two years or more in the future. 
British Foreign Office Minister Mike O'Brien also was to attend today's talks, saying his presence there is a sign of Britain's commitment to returning power to the Iraqi people as soon as possible. 
Shiites, a 60 percent majority long suppressed under Saddam's Sunni-dominated regime, have been enthusiasti­cally exercising newfound free­doms, organizing community­level political activities, protests against the U.S. occupation and religious events. 
Open elections in Iraq might produce a government domi­nated by the Shiite clergy, as in neighboring Iran, some observers believe. But Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld insisted in an Associated Press interview last week, "That isn't going to happen." 
Rumsfeld, who is on a tour of the Persian Gulf, repeated that stand Sunday during an inter­view· with Abu Dhabi televi­

Chalabi has attracted little public support inside Iraq. The government in neighboring Jordan warned Washington on Sunday against backing Chalabi, saying he lacked cred­ibility among Iraqis and noting his 1992 conviction in absentia for fraud in Jordan. Chalabi has denied any guilt and said the case was instigated by Saddam.

Republican senator will block Bush's tax cut plan 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON 
One of the Senate's moderate 
Republicans who is blocking 
President Bush's tax cut plan 
said Sunday he will stand his 
ground and resist White House 
pressure to vote more than a 
$350 billion reduction. 

Asked if he would not go even a penny higher, Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio replied: "You got it. And anybody that knows George Voinovich knows that when I say something I mean 
it... 

Bush had asked Congress for $726 billion in cuts over 10 years. The House capped new 
tax relief at $550 billion, while the Senate agreed to cuts of no more than $350 billion. The White House has scaled back its expectations, saying at least $550 billion is now the presi­dent's goal. 
That amount, Voinovich said, would be fiscally irresponsible. 
"Instead of dillying around between $350 billion and $550 billion, let's do the $350 billion and let's get it done," Voinovich told NBC's "Meet the Press." 
Voinovich and Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, reached a deal with Senate leaders on the $350 billion limit to the cuts. 
Bush, in his radio address Saturday, took on lawmakers \\ ho are refusing to accept the amount the president says is necessary to revive the econo­my. 
"Since they already agree 
that tax relief creates jobs, it 
doesn't make sense to provide 
less tax relief and, therefore, 
create fewer jobs," Bush said. 
During a visit last week to Ohio, Bush renewed his cam­paign for the bigger tax cuts. Voinovich said Bush's trip could backfire with Ohio voters, who support the lower tax cut. 
"I think the timing of it made it look bad, in terms of his try­ing to put some pressure on me," Voinovich said. "I don't believe that's what he had in mind, but it certainly has been interpreted that way in our state." 
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R­Iowa. nailed down the crucial votes from Voinovich and Snowe before the budget's pas­sage by promising to hold the final tax cut compromise to $350 billion. 
The deal, also backed by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., infuriated House Republicans. who said they were blindsided. 
Grassley said Sunday that Republicans are still looking for ways to offset the cost of addi­tional tax cuts, such as closing down corporate tax shelters and extending customs fees. But he said it would be difficult to reach $550 billion. 
"\Ve've got a divided govern­ment, and we have to operate within the realities of a Senate that is divided 51-49," he said on "Fox News Sunday."

Orthodox churches celebrate Easter 
Associated Press 
ISTANBUL 
The spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians appealed for peace in his Easter message Sunday, and signs of reconciliation marked celebrations on Cyprus and in the Holy Land. 
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I led nearly 2,000 faithful in a candlelit proces­sion in the gold-adorned Cathedral of St. George on the shores of Istanbul's Golden Horn. 
Bartholomew prayed that God would heal divisions in humanity and grant peace, "removing all hatred and bloodshed, and exchanging them with peaceful cooperation for the good of all." 
Deep divisions mar the Orthodox Church. 
Bartholomew, a Turkish citi­zen, directly controls several Greek Orthodox churches around the world, including the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. He is also considered the spiritual leader of 14 autonomous Orthodox church­es, including those of Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Russia and Serbia. 
Turkey only recognizes him as head of its dwindling Greek Orthodox community. 
Bartholomew, who had repeatedly urged a peaceful solution to the Iraqi conflict before the war, also warned those in power against seeking to dominate others. 
"There have been many who destroyed prosperous empires in their desire to make them greater, many who became self-destructive in setting before them aims of conceited pride ... many who destroyed others in their desire to lord and dominate over them," he said. 
It was not clear if his words 
were aimed at the U.S.-led 
coalition forces in Iraq. 

Maria Varaki, a lawyer from Kavala in northern Greece, said she saw Easter as a day of peace. 
"You actually feel more the meaning of forgiveness, love, and peace in the world, partic­ularly for us Greeks being in Turkey," said Varaki after the morning ceremony during which the patriarch distributed red-dyed hard-boiled eggs to the faithful. 
Relations between archrivals Greece and Turkey have warmed in recent years, prompting thousands of Greek tourists to visit the patriarchate each year. 
On the divided Mediterranean island of Cyprus, Easter was celebrated amid signs of reconciliation as thousands of Greek Cypriots traveled to the Turkish-con­trolled northern part to visit churches and cemeteries. 
The holiday came five days after Turkey lifted its ban on travel between the north and the Greek Cypriot south for the first time since the 1974 Turkish invasion. 
Turkish Cypriots also had 
lined up overnight so that they 
could cross into the south 
Sunday. They were offered col­
ored eggs and traditional cook 
ies by Greek Cypriots at the 
checkpoint, while Greek 
Cypriots crossing north were 
welcomed with flowers and 
wishes of "Kalo Pascha" ­
Greek for "Happy Easter." 
In the Holy Land, Greek and Armenian Orthodox faithful sealed an agreement after a week of negotiations over the ceremony at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, where tradi­tion says Jesus was crucified and buried. 
Last year. rival Greek and Armenian clergymen exchanged blows, but this year's ceremony was peaceful. 
In Ukraine, religious leaders called for unity in their church, which is divided in three groups locked in a bitter strug­gle over property and leader­ship. 
Millions attended overnight ceremonies in Russia, Greece and Romania. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was visiting Tajikistan, attended a Saturday night Easter service in thP­small St. Nicholas Orthodox Cathedral in the capital Dushanbe. 
At Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral, a delegation of priests and dignitaries carried oil lamps said to contain ho!:. fire from the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem.

I am writing in response to Ramin Saghafi's letter on Friday, "Parietals disrupt social life." Not only do pari­etals disrupt anything resembling nor­mal male-female interactions, parietals discourage talented prospective stu­dents from coming to Notre Dame. 
Last week, a few friends and I decid­ed to watch a movie together. It was around midnight when we were done studying. Since it was after parietals, we decided to meet in one of our dorm's basements, a designated 24­hour space, to watch the movie. 
There were seven of us and a prospective student. First, the men had to sign in with a security monitor at the dorm's only open door. After giving her their IDs and explaining their "busi­ness" in the dorm they were allowed into the basement. 
We were watching the movie when the security monitor came down and turned on all of the basement's bright fluorescent lights. After she was done checking on us, we turned off the lights on the side of the basement where we were sitting so there wasn't a glare on the screen. Like most people, we prefer to watch movies at night in the dark. 
The security monitor came back a few minutes later and turned on all the lights again. She told us it was against the rules to have them off. Still, I doubt she would have turned them off if it had been a group of all women watch­ing the movie. 
Our prospective student couldn't believe it. At Notre Dame, 20 year-olds, people who in a few years will be get­ting married and buying houses, are not allowed to watch movies with mem­bers of the opposite sex in the dark after midnight? The incident was a poor advertisement for an otherwise amazing place. Why should this prospective student come to Notre Dame when he could go to UCLA for free and watch movies in the company of women like a grown-up? Why should he pay $36,000 a year to be treated like a horny eight year-old or worse, a sex­ual predator, just by virtue of being male? 
And why should women at Notre Dame even try to have male friends when they will be treated so poorly by dorm security? As Saghafi wrote, "Parietals only hinder gender relations on this campus and do nothing to limit sexual contact." Had any one of us "girls" wanted these "boys" to stay the night in our rooms we could have, but all we wanted to do was watch Amelie with some friends in the dark. Who knew that desire could be so fraught? Nowhere else but Notre Dame.

What color 'whine' goes with crow? 
President George Bush has made so many of his detractors eat their words he ought to open up a restaurant for them. Of course, selecting a name is important. "International (White) 
House Of Crow?" "G.W.B. Friday's?" Perhaps the best name would be sim­ply, "Dubya's." Whatever the name, he'd have plenty of customers: In addi­tion to his regular 


clientele of patrons 

who thought Al Mike Marchand 
Gore would mop the floor with him in the presidential Undistinguished 
debates, or that the Alumnus 
Republicans would get shellacked in the 2002 midterm 

elections, he now has a new bumper crop of evidently very hungry eaters. 
He'd better put the Texas-size platter on the menu -it includes a basket of freedom fries and a tall frosty mug of STFU. 
If one compares the news coverage and punditry from the war in Iraq what surrounded the conflict in Afghanistan, there's a powerful new rule to be learned: Expect victory shortly after imminent defeat or protracted stale­mate is proclaimed. Shortly into Operation Enduring Freedom, people who were once involved in the armed forces but no longer had intimate knowledge of military matters were proclaiming their knowledge. Even Senator John McCain (R-AZ) was part of the army of critics, stating that 100,000 ground troops were immedi­ately necessary a couple weeks into the conflict. Whoops. The American-led coalition took the city of Mazar-i-Sharif shortly thereafter, and the rest of the Taliban and al-Qaeda's resistance dis­integrated. Grab a fork. 
The one difference in Operation Iraqi Freedom was that the retired military lifers had allies in the press, and not just the usual left-wing dips like Peter Arnett, who didn't just say that the American battle plan failed, but did so on Iraqi TV (and was rightly fired by NBC for so doing). Whole news organi­zations gleefully blasted the Pentagon and the administration for their short­sightedness. The "Conventional Wisdom" box in the April 7 Newsweek said that George W. Bush had "opened the gates of hell" and called Dick Cheney's statement that American forces would be welcomed as "an arro gant blunder for the ages." Whoops. Two days after that press date, Saddam's statue toppled and his regime fell like a house made from the Central Command "deck of cards" with his and his buddies' faces on them. Dig right in. 
Even the ancillary predictions of the war were wildly inaccurate. Estimates for civilian casualties went as high as half a million; even reasonable, knowl­edgeable groups like the World Health Organization tossed that one around. The sum total of innocent deaths, although tragic, will be far less. Gasoline prices haven't skyrocketed; they've stabilized or fallen (the price of crude oil is down by one-third). The stock market hasn't collapsed; it hit its low a week before the conflict due to instabilities and has since made back all its losses plus 10 percent. Enjoy your meal, guys. 
Now, it seems, that the success or failure of the war depends on the win­ning of the peace. I'll grant that that job is far from over and that it's too soon to proclaim our efforts on that front an absolute success. But it's also too soon to proclaim it a dismal failure because of manufactured outrage con­cerning "rampant looting" on the streets of Baghdad (which is a natural reaction of a power vacuum and is being controlled) or the theft of price­less cultural antiquities from the Baghdad National Museum {which was, as evidence is bearing out, a sophisti­cated and professionally-executed heist and not a smash-and-grab act of van­dalism that took place under the coali­tion's nose). Perhaps Dubya's needs to include a buffet. 
The latest inappropriate act of shameless scandal-mongering is allega­tions of shadiness on the part of the Bush Administration for awarding rebuilding contracts to corporations like Bechtel and Halliburton. Are these companies world leaders in their respective fields, who'll subcontract their work in rebuilding Iraq's infra.

of crow, nothing's better than humble

Not satisfied with getting everything wrong thus far, the nutball wing of the anti-war crowd won't just admit they were wrong before, but they also make further predictions with all the confi dence of someone who possesses a spotless track record. But those who maintain support of the Bush adminis­tration's policies needn't worry ­Dubya's, I'm sure, takes reservations months in advance.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Republican: 
Santo rum's 
words disgraceful 
As a Republican in the current day and age, it is extremely difficult to stand up for members of my party as of late. The war in Iraq has been deemed by many as a rash act on the part of our current president, the leader of the Republican party. However, I have remained close to the definition of a moderate Republican, and I have stuck by a great deal of my party's endeavors. 
There is an action by one member of the Republican party, however, which should be condemned. This is that of a senator who represents my state, Pennsylvania: Republican Sentor Rick Santorum. 
Santorum's statements denouncing homosexuality, made in an interview to the Associated Press, are appalling. A devout Catholic, he spoke against gays and lesbians, likening homosexual acts to incest, bigamy and polygamy. Despite the tenets of the Catholic church, which likewise denounce homosexuality, I find Santorum's statements to be entirely un-Christian. Christians treat their fellow man with dignity and respect. Santorum fails to do so. 
I believe that Santorum and other extreme members of my own party should be ashamed for not allowing other members of our country, equal brothers and sis­ters, the same rights with which any U.S. citizen is endowed. 
A great Republican figure, Senator John McCain from Arizona, visited our campus the other day, and I believe he made a good point that should be embraced and revered by members of his party and his fellow Americans: that all people are created equal under God.

New AR contract gives too much power to rectors 
My semester in Washington, D.C. has helped shape my view concerning the responsibilities and impor­tance of being an informed and active citizen. Part of this duty mandates speaking out and expressing a dis­senting opinion when bad policy is enacted through whatever forum available. While I don't pre­tend to believe that Notre Dame is or even wish that it were run like a democracy, we fortunately do have an independent newspaper. So to my soapbox I rise. 
The announcement of changing the assistant rector contract is something that deeply unsettles me. Not only does the rector interview, select and recommend to ResLife the hiring of an assistant rector (AR), with the new clause the rector now has the ability to dismiss an AR by terminating the contract "without cause." Does that mean if an AR is wearing blue socks and the rector prefers black and the AR refus­es to change, she could be dismissed with the rector citing the clause in the contract stated above? You may laugh at this example, but it was one given by a ResLlfe employee to delineate the extent to which an AR should go to please his or her rector. 
More disturbing than the fact that it probably won't be too much of a problem to fill all the available AR positions is the sense of powerlessness it gives the res­ident assistants and ARs. The most important purpose 
for the residential system at Notre Dame is to build a 
community with the rector, AR and resident assistants 
playing the most critical roles. This new policy essentially leaves the control of deciding what is best for the entire dorm communi ty up to one person. No matter how great that one person may be, it is impossible that he or she be right all the time, or with every decision, act on behalf of the community. ResLife's new policy is going to keep 
ARs from acting as the check and bal­ance on a rector through the threat of removal from their position outlined in the policy. Even in the case of dis­missal without cause where tuition benefits and living expenses are com pensated, the privilege of living and 
serving in a residence hall community, which so many ARs value, is taken away. It is unfortunate that we live in such a litigious society. where all of these nuances need to be promulgated into policy so as to 
ensure that less money is lost, but even more 
regrettable that this is one of the realities of the world 
that isn't kept out of the Notre Dame bubble.

I think the single best part about these cotton and polyester hip-huggers is that the University embraces them with such open, loving arms.

For many students, a piece of child­hood and the teenage years are soon to end. Two of the most popular shows featuring teen problems and high school life that graced our high school years will draw to an end with the final seasons of "Dawson's Creek" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" this May. 
For "Dawson's Creek," many think it should have been after high school graduation; others believe the show should continue. However, the WB Television Network has decided to conclude the drama series on May 7. 
For those who tune in every Wednesday night at 8 p.m.. it is a sad reality to see the last episodes of this popular look into the lives of Dawson, Joey, Pacey and Jen fade into televi­sion history. 
"Dawson's Creek," a seminal one­hour dram a series. has chronicled with wry humor the undeniably intense period of awakening known as the teenage years. Presenting a star­tlingly fresh and realistic portrayal of this passage from adolescence to young adulthood, since its first episodes "Dawson's Creek" has cap­tured the curiosity and hearts of tele­vis ion enthusiasts of all kinds. Created and developed by Kevin Williamson ("Scream," "I Know What 

"Dawson sCreek 
You Did Last Summer"}, this show set the standard for mod­ern 'teen dramas. With intelli­gent storylines, compelling characters and captivating new music, the series quickly became a cultural phenomenon. 
Set in and around the town of Capeside, "Dawson's Creek" tells the story of four friends making the journey from ado­lescence to adulthood. Dawson Leery (James Van Der Beek), Joey Potter (Katie Holmes) and Pacey Witter (Joshua Jackson) have all been friends since they were very young. When Jennifer Lindley (Michelle Williams), a mysterious girl with a troubled past, moves from New York to their small town, she joins the group, creating a foursome that will remain together through both the good times and the bad times. The sixth season set out to answer many of the ques­tions that began the series in unexpected ways.

Winning streak extended to 4 in victory over Harvard 
. Notre Dame's Walsh outshines Crimson's Kane in 16-11 Irish win 
By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 

It was a battle of two freshmen Saturday at Moose Krause Stadium. 
Notre Dame freshman Pat Walsh scored four goals and dished out four assists. 
Harvard freshman Sean Kane. rookie of the week for two con­secutive weeks in the Ivy League, netted four goals of his own for the Crimson. 
To Kane's dismay. however, Walsh had seven teammates helping him 
score.

The Crimson mounted little offense, and the goals they did score prompted offensive bar­rages from the Irish midfield and attackmen. 
"I don't think we responded [to Harvard goals]. I think we thor­oughly kicked their fannies for 35 minutes," Corrigan said. "I would have liked to see us finish a game the way we started it, but for 35 minutes, we played high quality lacrosse and essentially put it out of reach for them." 
Harvard scored once again in the second quarter, but Walsh and freshman defenseman D.J. Driscoll scored back-to-back goals to increase the Irish lead to 7-2. The goal was Driscoll's first of his career. 
Harvard's Mike McBride and Anders Johnson scored two goals, but junior Dan Berger, junior Matt Howell and 
streak to four games by defeating Ivy League opponent Harvard (4-9, 1-4), 16-11. 
Eight different players scored for the Irish, including hat tricks from both junior Steve Clagett and senior Travis Wells. 
The goal total of 16 was the team's second largest output of the season to a 17-goal perfor­mance against Hartford. With the win, Notre Dame hopes to bump itself up in the run for an at-large bid to the NCAt\ tournament. 
"I think we're playing our best lacrosse right now," coach Kevin Corrigan said. "We play Maryland this Saturday, and if we win, we have enough quality wins and no bad losses that we think we'll be in the tourna­ment." 
The Irish got on the board first Saturday with two goals from Walsh in the game's first three minutes. Kane answered at the 
14:19 mark of the second quar­ter, but Notre Dame got two goals from Wells and one goal from Clagett to extend the lead to 5-1. 
Howell, who 

had two goals on the day, returned for the first time since he missed the Ohio State game on April 6 due to an appendix operation. 
"Matt looked great," Corrigan said. "We didn't really expect to play him as much as we did, but we wanted him to get comfort­able again and he played very well." 
In the second half, Notre Dame scored the first two goals again on scores by Clagett and Walsh. Harvard scored three times, including one by Kane, and got some goals towards the end of the fourth quarter, but Howell, Walsh, sophomore Brian Giordano and junior Owen Mulford all scored to seal the vic­tory. 
Junior goalie Stewart Crosland made his thirteenth start of the season and played 38 minutes, making five saves and allowing four goals.

champions. 
Columnist 
Even last season, one year removed from an NCAA tournament semifinal appear­ance, the 5-8 Irish captured the league title. 
So what happens now, with Ohio State clinching that spot with a win Saturday? 
No team from the GWLL has ever made the tournament with an at-large bid. The Irish would be the first to concede that they play in a weaker conference, but Corrigan would then be the first to schedule a non-conference list of opponents that would allow his team to prove themselves in the regular season. 
So he did. And they have. 
So what if the Irish lost to a hot Ohio State team and consecutive games to Loyola and Hofstra? At the times of the losses, all three teams were ranked above No. 20 in the nation, and the Loyola and Hofstra losses were by just one goal each. Plus, after losing to Ohio State on the road, the Irish have managed a four-game win­ning streak and taken care of three league opponents as well as non-conference opponent Harvard. The league wins put them in a tie for first with Ohio State, which Notre Dame loses in a head-to head tiebreaker. 
Still, in the words of Corrigan, 
his team is playing its "best 
lacrosse of the season." Coaches 
do not just throw out words like 
"best" when discussing their 
squad. When they say it, they 
mean it. 

NCAA committee members 
could argue the Irish have not tested their true mettle against lower tier competition in Butler, Air Force and Fairfield. Still, the better teams do not just dispose of weaker opponent; they blow them out, just as the Irish did to all three. In that four-game win streak, Notre Dame defeated teams by a combined score of 52­
21. 

Blowing out the weaker teams proves the Irish win the games they need to. But quality wins will get them into the tournament, and they have a few of those as well. 
Notre Dame opened against six straight ranked teams and win three of those games against Penn, Penn St. and North Carolina. In the middle of the year, the Irish took care of Denver, the only GWLL team to defeat the champion Buckeyes. 
Saturday, the Irish will face No. 4 Maryland, a team who has defeated Virginia 8-7, the same Virginia team that sent the Irish on a three-game skid earlier in the year with a 14-8 whooping. On the other hand, the Terrapins dropped a 10-8 decision to North Carolina, a ranked team Notre Dame beat 10-8. 
The common opponent catego­ry sheds no light on how the Irish will fare Saturday and in the com­petition for an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. 
But please do not forget the Irish opened the 2003 season 3-0, beating Penn and Penn St. ­teams who both had Notre Dame's number last year -and the Tar Heels down in Chapel Hill. 
Please do not forget the head coach thinks his team is playing their "best lacrosse of the sea­son." 
Then reinsert Matt Howell into the lineup, the same Matt Howell who led the Irish in points when he was sidelined at the start of April and is still third on the team in total points-33, with 14 goals and 19 assists. 
Please do not forget that two years ago, Corrigan was two wins away from winning it all. 
They have proved they can get there. They have proven they can win there. Now, it is up to the Irish to upset the Terps at home. 
And it is up to the committee to make the right decision and let this team in.

Irish have streak snapped by Huskies in series split 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Sports Writer 
Even though a 20-game winning streak was snapped Sunday, a new streak began just a few hours later. 
After defeating Boston College on Saturday 11-0 in five innings, Notre Dame hoped to continue its unde­feated Big East season, but Barb Cook and her Connecticut teammates would finally give the Irish a confer­ence loss with a 2-1 victory by the Huskies. 
The Irish would come back in the second game, winning by a score of 6-3. to split the series. 
Notre Dame was scheduled to play Boston College in a doubleheader on Saturday, but as has been the case so often this year, the second game was rained out. Game one was played through a light drizzle, but the rain managed to hold out long enough to give the Irish a much needed two points against the current second­place team in the Big East. 
With the two wins, the Irish improve their record to 31-12 overall and 11-1 in the Big East. 
Saturday's game was billed as a match up of the top two teams in the Big East, but the Irish made it look like a mis­match early. 
The Irish managed to chase three-time Big East pitcher of the year Kim Ryan after just 
two-thirds  of  an  inning.  
Second  baseman  Alexis  
Madrid led off with  a walk,  

and catcher Mallorie Lenn fol­lowed by reaching first on a perfect bunt to put runners on first and second. 
A fly ball from third base­man Andrea Loman advanced the runners to second and third, and Madrid would score on a wild pitch to give the Irish their first run. Designated player Meagan Ruthrauff drew a walk from Ryan, who then threw her second wild pitch of the inning to put both runners in scoring position. 
Lenn came home on a sacri­fice fly by shortstop Andria Bledsoe, but it was first base­man Lisa Mattison who knocked Ryan out of the game with a two-run homer. 
Relief pitcher Tekae Malandris came in to pitch for the Eagles and give up a sin­gle to left fielder Liz Hartmann. Hartmann advanced to second on a passed ball, a:nd right fielder Nicole deFau became the ben­eficiary of the Eagles' third walk of the inning. 
Center fielder Kellie Middleton reached base on an error by Malandris to load the bases for Madrid. Malandris was then pulled in favor of Michelle Daly, but she tossed her own wild pitch to allow Hartmann to score the lrish's fifth run of the inning. Madrid flied out to end the barrage. 
The Irish added three more runs in the second inning off a two-run double from Mattison. Bledsoe also even­tually scored on yet another Boston College wild pitch. 
Notre Dame added insur­ance runs in the third, fourth and fifth innings, but the Eagles could not solve Irish freshman starting pitcher Heather Booth. Booth worked a complete game one-hitter, walking five and striking out four. 
In Sunday's game against Connecticut, Husky pitcher Barbara Cook was equally stingy, allowing only three hits. The Irish could only get one run across, when Bledsoe scored off a Hartmann RBI single in the second inning. 
The 1-0 lead held up for five innings, as Booth continued the spectacular pitching per­formance she has had for most of the season. She made only two mistakes in the sixth inning, but both were deadly as the Huskies collected back­to-back home runs from Maggie Arbogast and Kim Castner. 
Despite the loss, Booth pitched well, only allowing six hits and striking out six in six innings of work. 
Notre Dame exacted some instant revenge on the Huskies in game two, as cen­ter fielder Megan Ciolli led off the game with a double and came home on a Loman RBI single. Ciolli had missed the past two games with an injury. 
The Irish collected an unearned run in the second inning when pinch runner Sara Schoonaert scored on an error by the Connecticut pitcher. The Huskies battled back to tie the game with an RBI single in the second and a solo home run in the third. 
Notre Dame broke the game open in the fourth, posting four runs. Mattison led off the inning with a double and advanced to third on a Hartmann groundout. 
Lenn drove Mattison in with a single, and deFau followed with her own single. 
Ciolli then drilled her fourth home run of the season, scor­ing Lenn and deFau and giv­ing the Irish a 6-2 lead. Connecticut would get a run back in the fifth and would load give the Irish a scare by loading the bases in the sixth. 
Booth would come into the game in relief of Steffany Stenglein, who had entered earlier to replace starter Carrie Wisen and get out of the jam. The trio of Irish pitchers would live danger­ously by allowing the Huskies ten hits in game two, but pitched well enough to give their team the victory. 
Notre Dame has a difficult test coming up Tuesday as they travel to Chicago to face No. 7 DePaul in their biggest remaining non-conference match up of the season.

Albion. The match went three sets, as Spriggle came back after dropping the first 3-6 to take the second set 7-6 (5) and the final 6-3. 
The Belles also took control in doubles competition. In the No. 2 doubles champi­onship match, Cutler and senior Elisa Ryan defeated Amy Zeilstra and Annie Huizenga of Calvin in a domi­nant 6-2, 6-4 effort. 
Spriggle won a second con­ference title when she and freshman Lindsay Cook beat Karen Dumas and Amy Esh of Albion at No. 3 doubles. The Saint Mary's duo took the first set 7-6, but Dumas and Esh rebounded to win the second 6-4. Spriggle and Cook secured the victory by winning the decisive third set 6-4. 

After the dual match sea­son ended, Saint Mary's was tied for second in conference with Kalamazoo with a 5-2 record. With their conference tournament championship, the Belles finished second overall for the season. Kalamazoo's third-place tourney finished dropped them to third overall in the MIAA. Dual match season champ Albion (7-0) was able to hang on for first overall with their second-place tour­ney finish. 
For the second year in a row, Meaghan Clark of Kalamazoo was named the MVP of the conference. Clark is currently the No. 10 sin­gles player in Div.Ill. Ryan was honored with the Sue Little Sportsmanship Award, becoming only the third winner from Saint Mary's in the award's 48­year history. 
The Belles' top singles player, junior Jeannie Knish, was named to the All-MIAA First Team for the third time. Kaitlin Cutler and Kristen Palombo were both All-MIAA Second Team selections. 
The Belles will find out soon if their season will con­tinue. Invitations for the NCAA Regional Team Championships will soon come out, and Saint Mary's is hoping to be included. The NCAA Regionals will take place May 3-4.

Another canine crushed as Irish sweep Huskies 
By BRYAN KRONK 
Senior Staff Writer 
Three dilferentjerseys. One huge result. 
Sporting their trio of game jer­seys, the Irish took advantage of clutch hitting, solid pitching and all-around defense to sweep a three-game series from Connecticut, winning 3-2 and 11-4 in Saturday's doubleheader and 6­3 on Sunday. 
"As far as winning all three games this weekend, I thought it was really critical, quite frankly," Irish coach Paul Mainieri said. "We've got nine barn-burners left, so you've got to win the home games and the games that you should win, that you're favored to win, and our kids responded this weekend. I th0ught they played really good baseball all weekend." 
The Irish -opening in their reg­ular home white uniforms -sent senior Ryan Kalita to the mound to start the first game of Saturday's doubleheader, and he threw well, allowing only two runs in five innings of work in the seven-inning game. Kalita gave up single runs in the third and fourth innings on a sacrifice fly and an RBI single, respectively. 
However, the Irish bats were silent early, providing no run sup­port for the righthander until the bottom of the fifth inning, when Matt Macri smacked the first pitch of the inning over the fence in left­center field. 
"The first game I thought we were a little bit tight," Mainieri said. "The kids knew it was a big day for us.... They were uptight because they wanted to do well so badly." 
The Irish entered the bottom of the sixth inning down 2-1 and without a victory when trailing after the fifth inning this season. 
Saturday's first game broke that streak. 
A hit batter and a walk put run­ners on first and second before Matt Edwards hit a single up the middle to tie the game at 2-2 and chase Connecticut's starting pitch­er out of the game. 
"The pitcher threw eight straight balls to start the inning," Mainieri said. "Then I gave [Edwards] the green light to go ahead and hit, because he's the guy who's going to drive in runs for us." 
The Huskies then intentionally walked Kris Billmaier to pitch to Javi Sanchez. Sanchez's ground ball to the left side of the infield could have been much worse for the Huskies, but the Connecticut shortstop made an incredible div­ing stop to retire Edwards on the force out at third base. However, Brennan Grogan crossed the plate with the go-ahead run on the play. 
The relief duo of Ryan Doherty and J.P. Gagne worked the Irish into and out of a major jam in the top of the seventh, when a hit bat­ter (the fifth hit-by-pitch of the game), a stolen base and a one-out single put runners on first and third. 
However, Gagne was able to get a strikeout and a groundout to close out the Huskies in game one. 
Game two -when the Irish sported blue uniforms -featured much the same lineup, with only one roster change between both teams between games, however the storylines couldn't have been more different. 
I I I 
After manufacturing a run in the first, the Irish exploded for seven runs in the bottom of the fourth inning, sending 11 batters to the plate. 
With the score tied 1·1, Edwards led off the inning with a single up the middle. After Edwards stole second on a botched hit-and-run play, Billmaier sacrificed him to third. Sanchez was hit by a pitch ­marking the sixth hit batter of the day -before Macri continued his hot day offensively by crushing a Connecticut offering off the wall in left, scoring Edwards and sending Sanchez to third while himself reaching second. Sanchez then scored on a balk before Tim Murray reached on a strikeout that got past the catcher, allowing him to take first base. 
The defensive meltdown contin­ued when Lopez hit a sacrifice bunt that the Connecticut pitcher bob­bled. He then made a throw to first which sailed over the first base­man's head, allowing Macri to score, Murray to take third and Lopez to reach second. 
Steve Sollmann drove in a run ¼ith a single through the left side, scoring Murray, and a sacrifice fly by Rizzo brought in Lopez \\-'ith the sixth Irish run. After a pitching change, Edwards continued the onslaught with a double to left-cen­ter, scoring Sollmann and Grogan. 
"It was a big inning for us to break the game open," Mainieri said, "because I thought John Axford really struggled with his control, but he kept battling and kept getting big outs, because he was in a lot of jams. So when we finally got that big inning, that was good, because it gave John a little room for error, and he was able to

Regular guys show that it can be done, win Bookstore 
RBC's run to the title illustrated what Bookstore Basketball is all about. 
These five "regular" guys, plus a star football player injury replacement, defied the odds this weekend and defeated three top-5 teams on the way to win­ning the 32nd annual Bookstore Basketball tour­nament.

Friday, these regular guys refused to give up and pulled the upset over the tournament's favorite. 
With Barnes, one of their "regular guys", unable to play in Saturday's Final Four matchup against La-Z-Boy, RBC went out and got a non-''regular" -Courtney Watson. 
Watson wasn't instrumental in Saturday's win, but Sunday, he shut down NDToday's Jim Kilroy, who had six first-half points, but only four in the second half when Watson switched over to guard him. 
This title wasn't about Watson, though; it was about five "regular guys" making a name for themselves. 
The driving force of making their dream come true might have started in high school when point guard Jon Joyce and MVP Joe Dursi, best friends since the fourth grade, lost the county championship. 
It might have come from the fact that varsity basketball walk-on Dan Lustig and third-team All-Bookstore Brian Rush lived with these guys in Stanford and played with them on the interhall team. 
They wanted to win one for the "reg­ular guys," and they did.

We're Stacked grabs title 
By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN 
Sports Writer 

With their tallest player standing 
' ' 
' I ;\ I just 5-foot-9 tall, the Golden Girls looked overmatched to the unassum­ing fan in Sunday's final game. 

However, the Golden Girls put up quite a fight in their 21-15 loss to We're Stacked. 
Led by 6-foot-4 inch tall Katie Neff, We're Stacked dominated the boards. Emily Loomis and Kelsey Wicks, both over 6 feet tall, helped the cause as well. 
However, \Ve're Stacked could not pull away in the first half, as the Golden Girls kept themselves in the game with stellar team defense and better-than-average outside shooting. 

Guards Suzanne Bellina and Sara:1 Liebscher lit up the unsuspectin!: guards of \Ve're Stacked to tie the game at six. We're Stacked went on a 
mini-rw1 to go into the half leading by two, 11-9. 
However, after not being able to fully capitalize on their size in the first half, We're Stacked soon turned things around as Neff, Loomis and Wicks began to take over the game. Teammates Jaci Lesko and Heidi IJendrick also got in on the action. 
"They are a really scrappy team," Neffsaid. "We just tried to control the boards and go inside on them a lot because they were smaller." 
This strategy soon paid off for We're Stacked, as they went on a 10­6 run to close out the game after a close first half in which both teams struggled to score. 

The inside efforts of Golden Girls forward Jill Bodensteiner did not go unnoticed, as she fought the entire game, However, in the end, it appeared that We're Stacked was simply too tall for the Golden Girls. 
The presence of Loomis was espe­cially noticed, as she earned Most Valuable Player honors. Loomis was constantly around the basket, grab­; bing rebounds and hitting jump shots

:!, While l~oomis scored throughout the game, teammate Kelsey Wicks finally ended the game for We're Stacked. Taking the ball up :"1c court, Wicks jump-stopped, split 'ct' double team and finished the move by exe­cuting a power layup, giving We're Stacked their 21st and final point. 
Loomis and Neff enjoyed being teammates again, only in a different sport. Both are on the varsity volley­ball team. 
"Bookstore Basketball was a lot of fun," Neff said. "We had an awesome time playing in it." 
Hopefully they will have fun playing together again in the fall on a different court as well. 
Wicks, Llebscher, Bodensteiner and Loomis were named All-Bookstore. Joining them were Alex Callan, Abbey Coons and Marianna Seitz. Coons, a senior, was also named Miss Bookstore after winning two Bookstore titles in her four years. Her team, Tips, Please, lost to the Golden Girls in the final four.

It's about the teams in the early rounds showing team unity by dress­ing in hideous outfits, having team soundtracks, bringing cheering sec­tions and staying hydrated by drinking out of a two-liter bottle filled with more than just cola.

It's about being a team, which wasn't more evident than after Sunday's title game when RBC got their prizes. 
Dursi handed his duffel bag to a limping Barnes and put his arm around his "regular guy" teammate in street clothes. 
That's what it's all about.

lead. At the half, Watson suggested switching to Kilroy. and the change paid huge dividends. 
Watson fought through cramps and used his strength advantage to fight through the screens NDToday was trying to set for Kilroy and didn't let the sharpshooter get open. 
"He is a lot bigger. He was playing me tough coming off the screens," Kilroy said. "He made it difficult to get some jump shots. He's tough, they are all tough over there." 
NDToday was up 16-12 and looking to run away with it when RBC made their first run. A four point run brought the underdogs even at 16. After an NDToday free throw and an 18-footjumper from Kilroy. Dursi took over. 
First he nailed a 16-foot shot. Then teammate Jeff Wiltrout hit another jumper to tie the game at 18. 
Dursi drove down the lane and made a sweet reverse lay-up to give HBC its first lead of the day at 19-18. Sensing the hot hand, Dursi came right back down and swished a jumper to put RBC at game point 20-18. Jon Joyce finished it off with a ball fake and another jumper to complete RBC's Cinderella run. 
"He had [Brian] Rush's number there for a little bit," Kilroy said of Dursi. "He stepped outside and hit three or four in a row at the end. I think he was MVP so he deserved it." 
"We were shooting good shots all game, they just didn't fall and sometimes that happens," Dursi added. "Luckily they started falling and we pulled it out." 
Two disappointments for NDToday were their free throw shooting and the play of Dan Lustig. Down the stretch, NDToday missed five free throws that obviously cost them. 
Also, Lustig never got it going offensively. The bas­ketball team walk-on scored only two points and none in the second half. 
Credit the two-inch height advantage Dursi had over Lustig and the familiarity RBC had from playing with Lustig on Stanford's interhall teams. 
"He's a real good player. We played with him on our Stanford teams for all four years," Dursi said. "We played and practiced and we kind of knew how to play him, but he's a great player." 
But it's didn't take one great player to win the 2003 Bookstore Tournament -it took a great team.

FOOTBALL 
Holiday gives way to showcase youth 
ByMATTLOZAR 
Associate Sports Editor 
Five snaps. one pass. one com­pletion for eight yards. 
Having been in offensive coor­dinator Bill Diedrick's pro-style offense for over a year now, quarterback Carlyle Holiday didn't need to be take very many repetitions in Saturday's Blue­Gold Game. 
"The worst thing you can do is play one series," Holiday said. "But it was a good situation because we really want to get some work done with Chris [Olsen] and Pat [Dillingham]." 
Holiday started the game for the blue team and was sacked on two plays, handed off twice and threw only one pass. After seeing Holiday's improvement in the previous spring practices, Notre Dame head coach Tyrone Willingham and the rest of the staff didn't need to see much from the No. 1 man and wanted to focus on the battle for Holiday's backup. 
"We're a lot further along. We're so much further along that we were able to take Carlyle out and not have him play the· whole game," Willingham said. 
Tuck still blitzing 
Pass-rushing specialist Justin Tuck eyes had to light up when he saw tackle Brian Mattes, a for­mer defensive lineman, line up at left tackle Saturday. 
Three sacks later, Tuck was the Blue-Gold Game's defensive MVP. 
"We are excited about what Justin brings," Willingham said. "Hopefully he can continue to play at a high-level not only as a pass-rusher, but as a complete player." 
The one drawback from the format of the glorified team scrimmage is the rule restricting defensive players from actually hitting the quarterbacks to pre­vent injuries. In the fourth quar­ter, the defense had a shot at Chris Olsen but they let up and Olsen scrambled for a 4-yard touchdown. 
When Olsen scored, Tuck and the defense let him know about 
it. 
"No comment on that ltouch­
downl," Tuck said. "I probably 
could have tackled him at about 
the five-yard line. We started 
reminding him on the field about 
[how he wouldn't have scored in 
a real game]." 
Snap problems 
The offensive line appeared to be coming together by the end of spring practice but one player who didn't help himself Saturday was center Bob Morton. 
Morton and quarterback Pat Dillingham had troubles on exchanges in the second half with Dillingham fumbling four snaps. 
With all of those fumbled snaps coming in the second half, Morton acknowledged his condi­tioning wasn't where it should be. 
"I have to say I wasn't in the best game shape and that's something I need to work on," he said. 
Landri 
Derek Landri finally got to play some football. 
Landri suffered a leg injury from a bike accident last spring. When he was able to practice in the fall, he suffered a shoulder injury. Then, for most of this year's spring practice, Landri had on the no-contact red jersey until last week when he was able to finally hit someone. 
"It felt good, I haven't been able to do that in quite awhile in a game-type situation, so it was nice to get out there," Landri said. "First, you start off trying to everything that is going on. By the end, you are just going." 
JJ at the game 
Their handshake at the 30­yard line after the game may be a sign of things to come. 
Former Notre Dame running back Julius Jones shook hands with Willingham after the Blue­Gold game and as the field was clearing. Jones watched the game, in street clothes, from the Notre Dame sideline and talked with a number of Irish players, mainly upperclassmen, through­out the game.

Clark wants to be a go-to guy 
By JOE HETTLER 
Sports Editor 

For all Jared Clark did well in Saturday's Blue-Gold scrim­mage, he couldn't help but recall his one mistake. 
"All I can say about my catches was that I should have caught the one I dropped," Clark said. 
The quarterback converted to tight end before the 2002 spring practices and was refer­ring to the ball he bobbled before tipping to cornerback Vontez Duff for an interception. 
But that play was the only negative in a day full of posi­tives for Clark. 
The rising senior made two impressive catches and had a two-point conversion in the Gold team's loss to Blue, 17-14. 
Clark said he is accommodat­ing himself with his new posi­tion and the entire Notre Dame offense. 
"I absolutely feel more com­fortable out there," Clark said. "In every aspect, I feel better with my position and the offense." 
Buried in the quarterback shuffle with Matt Lovecchio and Carlyle Holiday, Clark fig­ured he had a better chance to 
Blue-Gold 
continued from page 24 
"The real force was to let our two young men play," Irish coach Tyrone Willingham said. 
Although Willingham said the Irish only used about 15 percent of the offense, the coaches' emphasis was square­ly on next season -a fact emphasized by the appearance of about half the freshman class in the stands and Julius Jones' presence on the side­lines. 
But there were still some signs of the team that went 10­3 and earned a Gator Bowl berth a year ago. The defense caused three turnovers that set up offensive scores and the defense recorded eight "sacks" -a hand on the quarterback was enough to cause a sack ­with three sacks coming from defensive MVP Justin Tuck. 
"I think that the 14 days have gone well for us," said Willingham as he evaluated the spring practice. "There's so many important things to take with us today and this week­end, but at the same time those 14 days have led to this day and they've been good days for us. We are not where we'd like to be entirely in some areas, but we made a few points and play if he switched positions. So he did, and now he has a chance to see significant play­ing time for the Irish. 
Clark showed Notre Dame 
fans a glimpse of what he can 
do Saturday. 
His first catch was a pass from quarterback Chris Olsen, and Clark had to come back to the ball before snatching it right before a Blue cornerback made a possible interception. Clark then raced down the field for a 30-yard gain, before being tripped up and injuring his ankle on the play. However, the injury wasn't serious, and Clark returned to make two more clutch catches. 
Clark raced across the middle of the Blue defense for his next catch, grabbing the ball with his fingertips and picking up 17 yards. After Gold scored later in the drive, Clark hauled in the two-point conversion in the back of the end zone. 
After the game, Irish coach Tyrone Willingham said Clark's plays were something Notre Dame needs in the future. 
"Well, I don't necessarily look at [making big plays] as a Jared Clark role," Willingham said. "I list it as a playmaker role ­people that can make plays. That's what we're about. 

That's what we want. That's what we encourage. Jared is one of those guys that fits in that category." 
Clark said he wants to fit into that role next season for the Irish. 
"I just want to be one of those go-to guys," Clark said. "l want to make plays and get the ball down the field. The harder I work now in the offseason, the easier it will be for me to be that guy come the fall." 
Clark said he knows that fifth-year senior Gary Godsey is the No.1 tight end for next sea­son. and that the Irish have several talented players at that position. But Clark simply wants to keep working hard and prepare himself for the chances he'll get next season. 
"I think the competition on the field is nice. We're all good friends off the field," Clark said. "I go out there every day trying to do the best I can and be the best player I can. I want to be the top guy. I want to be the starter, but I know that Gary's the starter right now and that it's his position to lose. I've still got a long way to go."

That inconsistency -shown early Saturday but eliminated late -may have kept the Irish from naming a clear backup, even though Olsen has a good idea of his role -both now and in the future.

 ND women topple Miami to win Big East Championship 
By JOE LINDSLEY 
Spores Writer 

CORAL GABLES, FI.A. 
In a weekend when the tennis courts were nearly as soggy as the nearby Everglades swampland, the Irish braved the storms of both Mother Nature and the Miami Hurricanes to come away with the Big East Championship in a tense upset victory. The 24th-ranked Irish defeated the 20th-ranked Hurricanes 4-3 at Miami's home courts in a competition that culminated in a thrilling doubles contest between Notre Dame's Sarah Jane Connelly and Kristina Stastny and Miami's Igna deVilliers and Abby Smith. 
The victory marked the fifth time the Irish have claimed the Big East title. 
It was a weekend of unusual weather in Miami, but the tennis scene was noth­ing out of the ordinary for the Big East finals. Once again, Notre Dame and Miami we.re contenders in the title match that rewards the champion with an automatic bid to the NCAA tourna­ment, which begins in two weeks.

NFL DRAFT 

Irish have 7 
players drafted 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
When Jeff Faine's parents saw the Cleveland Browns had chosen him with the 21st pick in the first round of the NFL Draft, they leapt off their seat in excitement. 
Faine, meanwhile, calmly fielded a phone call from Browns coach Butch Davis and began preparing for a life in Cleveland. 
The former Notre Dame center became the first 
Irish player taken in the first round since 1999 and has a good -chance to challenge for a starting position on a team that started three different play­


ers at center a year ago. 
"It's a great feeling to finally know where I'll be next year," Faine told the South Bend Tribune Saturday. "I am real excited to go there. I know they have a strong football tradition and the fans are fanatics." 
But while Faine knew his fate on Saturday, six other teammates had to wait another day before they heard NFL teams call their name. 
Three Notre Dame players were taken in the fifth round -offensive tackle Jordan Black (Kansas City), offensive guard Sean Mahan (Tampa Bay) and cornerback Shane Walton (St. Louis) ­while three more were taken in the sixth round ­safety Gerome Sapp {Baltimore), wide receiver Arnaz Battle (San Francisco) and offensive tackle Brennan Curtin (Green Bay). 
Late Sunday, full-back Tom Lopienski signed with the Indianapolis Colts as a free-agent. Punter Joey Hildbold may also sign as a free-agent. 
Faine's selection, however, was easily the biggest news for Notre Dame on draft day. It was the first time since 1999 -when the Giants took offensive lineman Luke Pettigout with the 19th

Olsen's a hit at Blue-Gold 

By ANDREW SOUKUP 
Sports Writer 

The crowd around Chris Olsen after Saturday's Blue-Gold game seemed nearly as big as the one the freshman quarterback had just left buzzing in Notre Dame Stadium. 
Playing for the first time on a public stage since November 2001 and get­ting a lot of help from a defense intent on causing turnovers, Olsen engi­neered four of the five scoring drives -one for the Gold and three for the Blue -as the Blue team edged the Gold 17-14.

. SMC Tennis wins MIAA Conference Championship 
By LISA REIJULA 
Sports Writer 
To some, it might have seemed that the Saint Mary's tennis team had lost their footing on top of the MIAA con­ference standings this season. However, the Belles proved they are still a dominant force, winning the MIAA tournament April 25-26. 
The Belles led the tournament the entire way, coming in first of eight 
said Olsen, who finished 11-of-2 5 passing for 146 yards and earned Offensive MVP honors. "It was the biggest crowd I've ever played in front of, but I felt midway through the first quarter, I got a lot more comfortable." 
The 20,346 who filed into Notre Dame Stadium Saturday afternoon saw Carlyle Holiday take just five snaps -he handed off twice, got sacked twice and threw one 8-yard completion -before the coaches turned the reins over to Olsen and Pat Dillingham. And although the focus being on the two quarterbacks -both who are battling over the No. 2 quar­terback spot -the coaches couldn't name a backup after the game.

Sports Writer 

Friday, they beat No. 1 Adworks. Saturday, it was No. 5 La-Z­Boy. Sunday, they won it all against No. 2 NDToday.com. Not a bad weekend for just "five regular guys." 
No. 8 RBC scored eight of the final 10 points and upset No. 2 NDToday.com to win the 32nd Bookstore Basketball Tournament 21-18 Sunday afternoon. 
In their upset of top-seed AdWorks Friday, John Barnes was injured and unable to play in this weekend's games. RBC went out and got Courtney Watson to be his replacement, and Watson was the defensive key in Sunday's second half. 
"It feels good because we have just been five guys, with John before we picked up Courtney, playing together since freshman year," Dursi said. "We were seeded 13th and no one really gave us a chance, especially when we played AdWorks. We just know how to play with each other." 
NDToday's Jim Kilroy scored six points in the first half. lead­ing NDToday to a 11-8 halftime
