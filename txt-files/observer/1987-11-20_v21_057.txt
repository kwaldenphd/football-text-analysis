Level one, screen two: 
After numerous scrapes with cerberi, sword­wielding women and strange blue creatures throwing knives, I enter the Castle of the First Level. Strange ghostlike creatures with half­suits of armor assault me as I climb through the dark corridors. 
Ye Gods! A flaming pif!! I leap across the gulf to snatch a swinging vine, only to be eaten alive by vampire bats. 
Level one, screen three: 
At the end of the castle and after being killed twice more, I face the King of Level One. He is a huge red giant with a long pitchfork. He leaps once, I leap once and land an aerial shot to the head. Ouch! Cursed pitchfork. Two more shots and he goes down. "You are a brave fighter to have cleared such a difficult stage," the gods of Video proclaim. A man's got to have a reason to live, you know? 
Level two, screen two: 
The green men have turned the color of au­tumn leaves, and they now have pet snakes and minotaur neighbors. I found an enchanted ram's head that cured my ills. I have leapt acid streams and fought flying pirahna fish and gar­goyles with swords of stone. So far I have con­quered. Oh no! A harpy! Arrrrrrrrrggghhh! 
The real world: 
Damn harpies. Pump another quarter in the coin slot. Good thing these games have a con­tinue option.

First .snowfall tells of winter's arrival 
By MARIA DOTI 
Staff Reporter 
Heavy sweaters, parkas and gloves may not be needed this winter. November is coming to an end and snowflakes have only just begun to fall. Local weathermen have mixed feelings about the coming win­ter and feel it may be difficult to make any predictions. 
"Our precipitation for this winter will be about normal, with below normal tempera­tures," said Don Savage, a weather service specialist at the National Weather Service office in South Bend. 
Dick Addis, weather reporter for WNDU-TV, said he heard rumors of a harsh, cold winter. Addis says he tends .to agree that a blizzard is long overdue for northern Indiana, and this just be the time. 

The Weather Service shows the jet stream dipping down in a southeasterly direction, blowing cold air right over the South Bend area. 
Ifthe lake effect remains~sta­ble, total snowfall for this win­ter will. be close to 72.5 inches. 
According to Paul Silvestri at WSBT-TV, "It's hard to make a long-range prediction and still maintain accuracy." He said he has received reports from the National Weather Ser­vice that claimed up to 60 per­cent accuracy. 
Only time will tell as to whe­ther winter will bring five-foot drifts or simply freezing tem­peratures. Although the weat­hermen are still uncertain, Christmas this year may be a white one.

Indiana judge 'sentences' six teenagers to city jail for poor school grades 
Associated Press 
HAMMOND, Ind. -A judge said Thursday he had no recourse but to send six teen­agers to jail for receiving poor school grades in violation of the probation he had imposed for their underaged drinking. 
City Judge Peter Katie on Wednesday revealed he had or­dered the five boys and one girl behind bars over the past two weeks after they received grades of D and F on their report cards. 
The students each had been ordered to improved their grades to no less than a C as a term of probation he imposed earlier this year when they were convicted of possessing alcohol at underage beer­drinking parties at parks along Lake Michigan in this Chicago suburb. 
"I don't like to send them to jail, but the stick that I have is the jail sentence," Katie said Thursday between calls of re­action from the public, mostly in support of his decision. 
However, Jean Thurman, director of Project Justice and Equality, a program advocat­ing jail and prison reform based in neighboring Gary, criticized the judge for sending juveniles to jail for "drinking beer and making bad grades. Those aren't criminal offen­ses." 
Four of the boys are serving 60-day sentences at the Lake County Jail in special cells sep­arate from the adult-felon pop­ulation in a juveniles-only sec­tion, the Gary Post-Tribune reported in Thursday's edi­tions. The four are eligible for release within 30 days for good behavior. 
Katie said he warned the 
teen-agers weeks ago this could 
happen. 
"I told them, 'You got your­self in this bind. You are going to shape up your grades, cut out the dope and alcohol, cut the nonsense out and if you don't do that you are going to jail.' 
"These are people who have said no to their parents, teach­ers, principals, ministers, police and now, after I, the judge who has the ability to send them to jail, told them what the conditions are, they come back and say no to me, too," Katie said.

Mexico threatened by peso dive 
Associated Press 
MEXICO CITY -The peso plunged for the second straight day Thursday, amid official statements that the govern­ment halted its free-market support of the currency to prevent a substantial drain on Mexico's international reserves. 
The government also said the tumbling peso should not worsen Mexico's heated infla­tion, which already was ex­pected to reach a record 140 percent this year. 
The peso on Thursday fell to a rate of up to 2,600 to the U.S. dollar at private exchange houses and major banks, down about 15 percent from Wednes­day and 45 percent below the close of trading on Tuesday.

rate of as high as 3,000 pesos, but few were selling dollars. Major banks set the selling price at 2,550 pesos, but gener­ally were not offering dollars. 
The peso began plunging in the free market on Wednesday, apparently due to investor worries about uncertainty in the financial markets. 
Treasury Secretary Gustavo Petricioli told Congress the government stopped selling dollars in the free market Wed­nesday morning, in the face of demand by private companies who decided to make foreign debt payments early and by in­vestors fleeing the Mexican stock market, which plunged a total of more than 27 percent on Monday and Tuesday. 
Petricioli said the action was taken to help prevent depletion of Mexico's foreign hard cur­rency reserves. Mexico's reserves are at a record $15 bil­lion, due to increased exports and loans from foreign banks, but the government does not plan to boost them further this year, he said.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -A teen­ager who was the nation's youngest heart transplant recipient when he received a heart six years ago, fainted at high school and died, his father said. 
"He always recovered from everything -we were starting to think modern medicine could handle it all," said Richard Wann, Eric Boyd's father. 
Eric died at University Hospital on Wednesday, six days before the sixth anniver­sary of the transplant, per­formed because he suffered from a chronic heart muscle disorder. 
"Eric drove, he dated -he could do everything 18-year-old boys do," Wann said. "That's why this is such a terrible shock to us all." 
Eric had been experiencing tissue rejection flare-ups on and off since the summer, but it was a heart attack that he finally succumbed to, his fa­ther said.

But aviation experts said the overall experience level of pilots at rapidly expanding air­lines, even some of the indus­try's largest carriers, has fal­len off in recent years. 
"This is one of the areas of concern that we have today. 
There's been such rapid expan­sion that (pilots) have come up (the senior system) rapidly and the total level of experi­ence can drop," said Homer Mouden, a former commercial pilot and vice president of the Flight Safety Foundation.

The Anti-Apartheid Network is currently gearing up to launch a publicity blitz for the boycott, which is scheduled to start officially on Jan. 18, Checkett said. Local news sta­tions and radio talk shows have expressed an interest in doing segments on the boycott, he said. The Anti-Apartheid Net­work also appeared in the "Stepping Stones" program on Heritage Cablevision, Checkett said.­
"In order for this to work, we need wide, wide campus sup­port," Checkett said.

revitalized only if a consider­able number of the scientists and engineers now serving the military were transferred to · the commercial industries. 
He stressed, however, that this conversion of engineers and scientists from the mili­tary to civilian jobs could go smoothly "only if advanced preparation on a highly decentralized basis. . . is carried out." 
Simply removing these re­sources from the military by means of a budget cut would not solve the problem, Dumas said. "You have to reconnect them," he said, "to productive civilian research and develop­ment. "That requires conver­sion, not simply budget cuts." 
He concluded by saying that a system must be set up to con­vince military engineers and · scientists that their options are not, "make weapons or be out of work. (Rather) make weap­ons or something else." 
The group is planning to hold a meeting to recruit students to organize the boycott. "Ideal­ly, we would have a committee for each dorm. If we could do that, it would be a dream come true," Checkett said. 
Each dorm committee would attempt to persuade dorm leaders to exclude Coca Cola soft drinks from SYRs, formals and foodsales. Checkett said banishing Coke from the campus would be no small ac­complishment. "There's a lot of Coke machines on campus," he noted. 
Checkett said he would also meet soon with William Hick­ey, director of University Food Services, to discuss the removal of Coke from campus cafeterias. "This is in no way a confrontation. (Food Ser­vices has) supported numerous. boycotts in . the past," said Checkett. He said he was un­certain about the prospects of Food Services banning Coke, however. "I do not know what kind of a contract they have un­der Coke," he explained. 
Checkett said that "everyth­ing is going to be done totally to avoid giving the impression that it is a "small group of stu­dents trying to restrict other students' buying power," he said. "This is a way for the stu­dents to show their voice." 
Checkett said he was confi­dent about the response which the campaign would elicit from the students. "I was very im­pressed with the participation in the fast. There was very little advance publicity and yet 
about  100 students  partici­ 
pated."  
By  contrast,  he  did  not  

foresee much success in con­verting the University admin­istration to the group's cause, citing the Board of Trustees' recent decision to refuse to take a tougher stance against South Africa. "I think the administra­tion's policy is a total failure," he said. 
Checkett denied, however, that the group was singling out Coca Cola because its presi­dent, Donald Keough, also chairs Notre Dame's Board of Trustees. "The boycott is part of a nationwide effort,'' he said, adding that the boycott has been in the making for almost 
by the book." The wants

Impending death forces painful choices 

Smiley-face stickers held the wires that monitored the comatose man's ir­regular heart beat. Vitamin-carrying IV tubes pierced his wrists, and cat­heters carried urine from a bladder that no longer functioned properly. A tube, a sort of high-tech umbilical ~ord, snaked its way from a nearby respirator into the man's nostril and down the back of his throat to his lungs. His body lay motionless except for the rhythmic rising and falling of his chest. He was my father. 
Kathy Scarbeck 
guest column 
Dad, like many of the dangerously 
ill, depended on artificial devices to 
stay alive. Several small heart attacks 
had weakened his heart, and 
pneumonia filled his lungs with fluid. 
His condition had triggered three 
progressively more serious Code Blue 
alerts. Yet during the four weeks he 
was hospitalized, Dad fought against 
his life support systems. 
He grudgingly agreed to the respirator only after my family and I had pleaded with him. Days later, Dad pulled the respirator tube from his throat. Technicians re-inserted the tube only to find it later dangling from his bed. When Dad could no longer tolerate the respirator forcing oxygen into his lungs, he asked my mother to "get rid of that monstrosity." The next day she asked Dad's doctor if he would remove the machine. "I can't do that," the doc­tor replied, "It would be murder." 
Although it hurt watching Dad die slowly, it was even more painful watch­ing him fight the very machine that kept him alive. But removing the ap­paratus would expedite his death, and we, legally, perhaps morally, could be lumped into the same category as cold­blooded murderers. Our crime would be all the more horrible because we'd be killing someone we loved. Even though the doctors had told us he was about to die and although Dad pleaded with us to unhook the machinery, this act ran counter to all I'd ever known-­that human life should be respected and that the preservation of all life is its own justification. 
How could I kill the man who used to pull me around our block in a red wagon, who took me for Sunday mor­ning driving lessons? Dad had worked hard to support his family; he often came home late at night, exhausted from a long day at work. Whenever his birthday or Christmas came around, I'd asked what I could get him. "Peace and quiet," he replied, only half joking. 
I was unable, finally, to give even that. Through weeks of intense pain, Dad couldn't speak because the respirator tube partially obstructed his throat. For a while he communicated by writing messages, but he soon stopped. Dad wouldn't look at us when

we spoke to him; his gaze wandered 
about the room. He didn't seem to know 
what to do with all that pain. He didn't 
want to prolong this kind of life. 
But my family and I are Catholic. We respect life. We contribute to anti­abortion campaigns and oppose the death penalty. Who are we to play God and say when someone should die? 
I had asked myself this question not long before Dad's illness. As a high scfiool junior studying euthanasia in my Christian Morality class, I had learned euthanasia literally meant "good death" and was commonly referred to as "mercy killing." My teacher told how some people could rationalize in­jecting fatal doses of drugs into the ter­minally ill. These people said anyone on the verge of death should have the right to choose when to die. With just one shot, a person could be put out of his misery like an injured horse. My teacher concluded that euthanasia was immoral. While the motive may be ad­mirable, she explained, the act itself is, quite simply, murder. It cannot be justified. . 
I was an obedient 16-year-old who had always done what I was told. If the sun were shining and my mother told me to take an umbrella to school, I'd do what she said. I never missed a curfew, and I didn't give my teachers any prob­lems. I respected authority. I trusted people whom I thought were wise enough to know what was "right." 
But when Dad asked to have the respirator removed, I couldn't bring myself to even consider the implica­tions of his request. Dad was asking for his own death and, according to the Church, we'd all be guilty of murder. He'd have to continue using that ma­chine; it was the right thing to do --the Church said so. Or so I thought. 
My teacher had also explained about how the Catholic Church makes a dis­tinction between "extraordinary" and 
"Although it hurt watching Dad die slowly, it was even more painful watching him fight the very machine that kept him alive." 
"ordinary" treatment given tc,'the ter­minally ill. "Extraordinary" methods, she said, do not imply reasonable hope of benefit, but "ordinary" methods do. , Critically ill patients often reach a point in the dying process where life­prolonging devices such as respirators can do no more than postpone the in­evitable. All of this seemed abstract, a matter of semantics. But my teacher did make a painfully relevant final point: Catholics are not morally bound to use extraordinary means to preserve life. 
Now I felt the terrible burden of having to make a life and death deci­sion. Our family could choose to remove Dad from the respirator, as­suming the doctors would allow it. Such ~n act did not force death; it was not euthanasia. If we did unhook the ma­chine, though, we would have to accept the possibility that Dad almost cer­tainly would die. 
We also had to consider "what Dad would have wanted." He had argued against using the respirator since the doctors had first recommended it. The tube dangling from his bed reminded us of that. Just before Dad eventually lapsed into a coma, he wrote my mother a note that said he didn't want my bro­ther, sister, and me to enter his hospital room. I knew he was suffering and he didn't want us to see him in that con­dition. It hurt to be shut out but, in a sense, we were bringing it upon our­selves by allowing the respirator to remain. After all, it was Dad's life, and in the four weeks preceding his coma, he was coherent enough to make the decision that he didn't want to live in pain. 
"Dad was asking for his own death and according to the Church we'd all be guilty of murder." 
Dad wanted to die, but I couldn't let him. When I first heard that he had asked to have the machine turned off, I immediately looked for excuses to for­bid it. He was on medication and had just experienced several minor heart attacks. Of course Dad didn't realize what he was doing. He was helpless, and it was his family's responsibility to think for him. 
But maybe this shouldn't even have been our decision. Doctors deal with such cases every day; maybe they are more qualified to decide when life­prolonging measures should be used. My family and I were just too ex­hausted and too emotional to remain objective. Maybe we needed a doctor to tell us that Dad should stay on the respirator. 
Then again, my family and I had known Dad for years; we knew him bet­ter than any medical specialist ever could. To the doctors he was a name on a chart, a patient in an ICU ward. Perhaps Dad's doctor had advised the respirator, because he didn't want an­other patient's death on his record. 
But I knew what they didn't. Dad couldn't tolerate the suffering; he needed "peace and quiet." . Although the doctors told us my fa­ther had no hope of surviving, I kept believing they were wrong. One night during his first week in the hospital, the doctors told us to call a priest be­cause Dad wouldn't live through the night. But he did survive that evening and for weeks after. The doctors had been wrong once; surely they could be wrong again. 
Besides, God wouldn't let Dad die if we prayed hard enough. My mother said countless novenas and rosaries; my sister and I prayed for him in school. Maybe God was just testing our faith, waiting until the last minute before He would save Dad. 
Finally, I simply could not allow myself to take an active part in my father's death. It would have meant having to live forever with the nightmare of "what if" --what if a miracle would have happened, what if the doctors could have saved him? I denied my father's request for "peace and quiet,'' because I couldn't deal with the horror of possibly admitting defeat prematurely. Dad had to suffer, then, until something happened. 
And it did happen. Almost four weeks after Dad entered the hospital, he slipped into a coma. A lab report showed irreversible brain damage. Three days later he died. 
"Dad couldn't tolerate the suffering; he needed 'peace and quiet."' 
My father's request for "peace and quiet" was f~nally granted when his blood pressure dropped to a critical point. All of those high-tech devices just couldn't save him. We entered Dad's hospital room not long after he died. The respirator was pushed back from Dad's bed and IV tubes no longer cut into his flesh. "I guess we knew it was coming," my mother said, looking at his lifeless body. Now it was over, and Dad could finally be at rest.

FRIOAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1987 
Early bowl bids do little but disappoint 
Last Saturday we witnessed the most convincing win at Notre Dame Stadium in the 1980s. However, while you were celebrating at the game, I was on the edge of my seat in front of the CBS broadcast here in Nome, Alaska where we are enjoying our first blizzard. I am spending my first postgraduate year working at KNOM Radio, a Jesuit Volunteer Corps placement. Fortunate­ly, virtually every Notre Dame game has been broadcast in Nome, and with the help of a South Bend Tribune sub­scription, I have enjoyed ND's fantastic season almost as much as any Notre Dame student. 
Timothy J. Clulo 
guest column 
The Alabama game was the highlight of my otherwise work filled weekend. Only one thing spoiled it, and of course it had nothing to do with what was hap­pening on the field. As usual at halftime, CBS turned its attention away from the Notre Dame Band to scores from other games and a look at the "bowl picture". It was rather dishear­tening to hear the Cotton Bowl Presi­dent, standing on the field at Notre Dame, state that Notre Dame's new Executive Vice-President and Athletic Director had given the Cotton Bowl a verbal commitment while the Orange Bowl Chairman was saying, live from Miami, that Notre Dame deserved to play for the National Championship if the Irish beat Alabama, Penn State, and Miami. "Disheartened" would be a poor description of my reaction. In reality, the words that shot from my mouth as I bounced off the ceiling are unprintable. 
Several questions raced through my mind. How could the Notre Dame ad­ministration sell our team short? The team Notre Dame would play in the Cotton Bowl will undoubtedly be the worst team to play in a New Year's Day Bowl. It may not even be ranked in the Top 20 on January first. 
Secondly, hasn't the Notre Dame ath­letic administration learned from its previous mistakes with early bowl game wheeling and dealing. In 1983, Notre Dame was embarrassed when it was forced because of a premature dealing to take a 6-5 team which finished with three losses to a bowl game. That team did not deserve the rewards of a bowl, and neither does this Notre Dame team if it lost its last three. No one could tell the athletic adminis­tration better than Coach Holtz that Notre Dame c·ould have lost to Alabama on Saturday. With a key injury here and a bad break there, Notre Dame could easily lose to Penn State and Miami too. Let's leave it to men of ques­tionable integrity like Jimmy Johnson at Miami to talk and negotiate bowls weeks before the season ends. Many may be saying that bowl commitments at mid-season are a reality today. If that is the case, Notre Dame should step aside, revert to its former policy of not attending bowls regardless of the multimillion dollar paydays, and work for a playoff system. I am a firm sup­porter of the bowl rather than playoff format. However, if bowls cannot wait until the season ends to solidify deals and commitments, playoffs may be necessary for the good of college foot­ball. 
Thirdly, how can the Notre Dame team be expected to be at their best week in and week out when the athletic administration is not doing its best for them? What kind of a message does a Cotton Bowl commitment send to the team? "Well boys, you play your hearts out and beat the best teams college has to offer each week. However, on Janu­ary first, we have you scheduled to play a team that's lost two or three games against weak competition and may not be in the Top 20. But the Notre Dame Athletic Department does have a three million dollar check in its account." If I were on the team, that's the way I would see it. 
Finally, when I cooled off a bit, I won­dered if maybe the Cotton Bowl Presi­dent had exaggerated about his discus­sions with Notre Dame officials and if the Orange Bowl Chairman had recon­sidered giving Miami an unconditional berth in the Orange Bowl. I can only hope that this is what happened on Sat-· urday and that the Notre Dame athletic administration considers all its options, considers the great team for which it is acting, and considers its mistakes of the past. Coach Holtz said it best in a post game interview with CBS. He un­characteristically looked into the fu­ture more than one week. If we win, he said, we want to play the best and that would be in the Orange Bowl.

Pressure abounds in live television 
If you believe in the Nielsen ratings system, then you'll accept as fact that about five and a half million people viewed last week's Notre Dame,'Alabama game. I personally don't have much faith in Mr. Nielsen and his 1500 "Nielsen families", but for the purpose of my story I will accept his numbers. The reason that number is important to me is because it is the largest number of people who have ever seen the results of my incompetence. Don't misunderstand me, I have incon­venienced large numbers of people before, but never more than I could per­sonally apologize to. 
Daniel C. Decarlo 
guest column 
Last weekend I had the pleasure of being "tricked" into working (and I use that term loosely) with CBS for their telecast of the big football game. Thursday afternoon I visited a seminar presented by CBS intended to educate students interested in sports television. I sat in the first row and listened to a very interesting presentation about what goes into putting together a na­tionally televised college football game. As it turned out I was too inter­ested; one of the producers sensed my enthusiasm and asked if I would like to help do the show. I jumped at the chance, how fun I thought. Yea fun, if you like that feeling you get when you sleep through a final, then you would have loved the day I had with CBS. 
My job began on Friday when I showed up at the truck and did some typing and running around for odds and ends. Pretty easy actually. The day ended with instructions to be back at 8 
a.m. the next day to help them get ready for kickoff. "You'll probably just be on your own when the game starts." So they told me. I never should have gotten out of bed. 
When I arrived on Saturday morning I sensed that something was different, that coolness had disappeared from the employees and was replaced by a ner­vous tension. Normal, I was told by those who had been through this before. I spent the morning running errands, and doing other insignificant tasks. Mostly I watched how they prepared for what I was slowly realizing was a huge job. About an hour before game time I was summoned on the field to help an assistant, Rob, with "pregame". OK sure, sounds like fun. My day soon unravelled. 
Pregame consisted of coordinating the entrance of the band and the two teams onto the field. Because of a goof with the band my job went from holding the cable of the assistant's head set to wearing the set and cueing the assistant to cue the band. I was not prepared for the responsibility. All of a sudden I was listening to five people yelling at me on a head set. "When we give you the cue Dan you'll give Rob the cue to start the band. Now this is very important, if the band doesn't start on time it will f---up the timing of the whole intro." Just what I needed to hear. You see they told me they would say "wave Dan" when they wanted me to cue Rob. They never did. I was waiting to hear only those exact words, no derivation would do. "Five, four, three, two, one and cue the band, (silence) cue the band, hey Dan cue the band," "Sir do you mean 'wave Dan'." At that point expletives rebounded through my head as a muddled assort­ment of voices yelled "wave Dan." I did wave, but Rob took that point to look up at the band director and not me. I jumped around trying to get his attention but it was no use, the cue had been missed. The producers were screaming at me to drop the head set and go tell Rob, but of course I got tangled up in the wires and never made it out there. After what seemed like an eternity, but was probably about ten seconds, had elapsed Rob finally saw me waving and tripping in the North tunnel and started the band. But the damage had been done. I missed the cue and Brent Musburger was forced to ad iib my mistake. In addition, I had to stand there and listen to all the com­ments from those fans who had wit­nessed my little show. Those com­ments, however, were nothing compared to the assaults that were being hurled at me over the head set. 
The rest of the day was filled with incidents similar to the one just docu­mented. Whether it was losing Brent Musburger's change or being called "an incompetent midwestern boob," my day with CBS was one I will not forget nor repeat. Working in live tele­vision highlights all my weaknesses. Everything happens so quickly and decisions must be made without thinking. It is all instinct. The pressure on the field and in the director's truck is absolutely unbelievable. One mistake can set off the switchboard of every affiliate in the country. 
I learned an awful lot last weekend about television, so much in fact that I know now I want to have nothing to do 
with it. ·

Ned Bolcar winces at the subject's very mention. 
Notre Dame's junior linebacker doesn't want to talk about being named to nearly every high school all-America team or his daily diary in the USA Today while he was recruited. 
''High school is high school,'' he says. 
Part of the reason his glorious past has worn thin is that the present is shaping up just fine itself. After a delayed start, he is finally in the posi­tion he expected to be. 
Bolcar has stepped into a starting in­side linebacker slot and has led seventh-ranked Notre Dame's 'No­Name' defense in tackling since the opening game at Michigan. 
Bolcar registered nine tackles that day after tackling some pre-game jit­ters. 
"I was really nervous before the game and (Defensive Coordinator and Inside Linebacker) Coach Fazio came up to me about a half-dozen times and said 'Do you know what you're doing?' and I said 'Do you know what you're doing?' He said 'Yeah' so I said, 'Well, I have confidence in you,' and he said, 'I have confidence in you, too.' That was it, but that really helped." 
Since then, Bolcar has had put up big tackling numbers all season, including 17 against Pitt and 13 against USC, which he calls his best performance. 
But while his junior season got off to a great start, his college career was not quite so smooth at takeoff. 
Bolcar did not get any playing time as a freshman, which he says he was prepared for. But he also saw very little practice time, which he was not so ready to take. 
"The only thing I'm not happy about is that I really didn't get a good learning experience my freshman year," says Bolcar, an economics major. "I didn't get to play special teams, I even asked to be put on the prep teams to get the experience of playing against the older guys. 
"As the season wears on, you work less and less with the third-and fourth­team players because the starters need to prepare for the game every week. I didn't get any work, so I wasn't learn­ing. By the time it came ot my turn we ended the drill. 
"My freshman year, what I did after the first month was stand around," he says. "I gained 20 pounds from just standing there." 
That put Bolcar one year behind

Gerry Faust. The name, when mentioned today, 
 elicits comments like, "he couldn't coach" and "ol' Pinkett, Pinkett, pass, punt," to "he was such a nice man" and "he got a bum rap". 
No matter who you want to believe, it seems that Faust was just the wrong man at the wrong time for Notre Dame football. Irish fans had just watched their last two coaches, Ara Parseghian and Dan Devine, post a combined record of 148-33-5 over 17 years, collect two national championships, earn nearly unanimous respect of players and fans and

step down gracefully after sending their final teams to bowl games. 
When Dan Devine resigned at the end of the 1980 season, he was replaced by one of the most suc­cessful high school coaches in the country, Gerry Faust. Faust built himself into a legend at Moeller High School in Cincinnati. He coached his teams to four mythical national prep titles, five Ohio state titles, seven unbeaten seasons and a 174-17-2 record over 18 seasons. 
These were great achievements, even for a high school coach. Although some Irish fans were skepti­cal of the choice to bring someone unaccustomed to the college game in to tackle what might be the most difficult coaching position in the country, no one questioned Faust's winning attitude. 
At the end of his five-year tenure with the Irish, not many doubted Faust's winning attitude, but even less could tolerate his teams' inability to get the big first downs, to make· the key defensive stands or to win the big games. 
It was a stormy five years for Faust and Irish football. In his first season, Faust saw his team, as the number-four team in the country, pick LSU apart at home, 27-9. The win vaulted Notre Dame to the top spot in the rankings, but it didn't stay for long. 
The Irish lost four of their next five, including home losses to Florida State and USC, to drop them well out of the polls. Faust rallied the Irish to blowouts of Navy, Georgia Tech and Air Force before losing their final two on the road to Penn State and Miami. The loss to the Hurricanes assured Notre Dame of its first losing season in 18 years. 
The fans forgave and forgot, and at the start of year two of the Faust regime, the Irish had again been ranked in the top 20, at number 20. And an

where he expected to be, but the progress began the next season. 
"My sophomore year was really my freshman year," he says. "I was on all the special teams (Lou Holtz named him captain of the punt team), I set my foundation on the team and proved I could play, like the freshmen are doing now." 
With Mike Kovaleski's graduation, Bolcar and Mike Stonebreaker (who was declared ineligible this fall) were the favorites to earn playing time with Wes Pritchett. Bolcar set out to earn his playing time in the spring drills. 
"I became better fundamen­tally in spring ball," he says. "That's where I made my big­~ gest improvement. "I was in the right position all the time

with the proper technique.

"I wasn't quite sure how I stood in the coaches' eyes, but I had the opportunity to play. That gave me confidence be­cause I was the man who had to do the job. I just wanted to go out and do it." 
Which is exactly what he has done. In his first season as a starter, Bolcar has 87 tackles,

three tackles-for-loss, two fumble recoveries, two inter­ceptions and one sack. Bolcar's development has been in­stumental in solidifying the Irish defense into a formidable force. 
The Observer 
"We've had a good year so far," he says. "We had a little letdown at Pitt, but yet the team showed something by bouncing back in that game. We bounced back and played well and now with the good game against Alabama, we're ready to have another one this week at Penn State. 
"Pve come a long way and the team has come a long way, but we can get better., we've got to improve every time out there." 
Bolcar has indeed come a long way. After coming in as a celebrity and his freshman­year setback in trying to prove he belonged, the enthusiastic linebacker finds himself in the position he hoped for when he came to the Irish. 
"I get excited for every game," says Bolcar. "This is perfect. I hoped to be in this position-Notre Dame winning and me being a part of that. 
"I'm right on schedule."

opening season win over rival Michigan cut the fans reserva­tions, as well as the Notre Dame ranking, in half. 
Three more wins and the Irish were 4-0, number nine in the country and licking their chops as unranked Arizona made its first trip to South Bend since 1941. But the Irish dropped the game on an Arizona field goal with no time remaining and could manage only a tie at Oregon the follow­ing week. 
Those back-to-hack disap­pointments kept the Irish out of the polls, but just when the Notre Dame faithful started to lament about what might have been, the Irish stunned behind then-freshman Allen Pinkett's two touchdowns. The win brought the fans and the ranking (number 13) back, but not the momentum. Notre Dame dropped its last three to finish the year at 6-4-1. More lamenting about what might have been. 
The Associated Press, if no one else, would not give up on Faust. It granted his squad the number-five ranking in the . country on opening day of the 1983 season, and it looked like the Irish might live up to it in the first game, pounding Purdue 52-6 at West Lafayette. 
into a berth in the Liberty Bowl, a berth many (including some Irish players) didn't feel 6-5 Notre Dame deserved. The Irish defeated Boston College, 19-18, behind two more touch­down runs from Pinkett. 
Once again, despite finishing the previous year unranked, Notre Dame was ranked num­ber eight to begin the 1984 cam­paign. And once again, the Irish failed to live up to the ex­pectations of fans and pollsters alike. An opening-day loss to unranked Purdue at the Hoosier Dome toppled Notre Dame from the polls, but won three straight to re-enter at number 17. 
But then the roof caved in. Consecutive home losses to Miami, Air Force and South Carolina buried the Irish, and only miracle wins at ranked op­ponents LSU and USC could salvage a winning record and a trip to the Aloha Bowl. The warm Hawaiian climate didn't suit the Irish against SMU, however, as the Mustangs gal­loped to a 27-20 win. On fourth down on the SMU 16-yard line and 23 seconds remaining in the game, quarterback Steve Beuerlein's pass to a wide-open Milt Jackson drifted just off his fingertips in the endzone, sum­ming up the frustration of the season. 
In his final season, 1985, Faust's squad went 5-6, and three straight losses to Penn State, LSU, and Miami to close out the year broke the patience of the fans. Three days before the Hurricanes swept the Irish away, 58-7, Lou Holtz was named the next coach of the Fighting Irish. 
As much a quick fix to college football teams as Billy Martin is to the Yankees, Holtz came to South Bend after resurrect­ing a hapless Minnesota team to bowl stature in two years. And Irish fans didn't want five years of rebuilding, they wanted a winner. Holtz made no promises early, but a string of close losses in 1986 threatened to continue what seemed to be endless frustra­tion for the Irish. 
On opening day, 1986, Holtz almost pulled off an incredible upset of third-ranked Mic­higan. Ifnot for an oft-reviewed call in the endzone of a late Joel Williams (non)catch, and a short, left 45-yard field goal at­terp.pt from John Carney with 18 seconds left, it I!light have happened. And it might have been all the Irish needed to carry them ·through yet an­other murderous schedule. 
Instead, tight, hard-fought losses were the rule as Mic­higan State, Pitt, Penn State and LSU joined the Wolverines as teams who nipped the Irish in games that literally could have gone either way. Some consolation came in the season finale at USC, when the Irish rallied from a 37-20 deficit with a little more than 12 minutes remaining to win on Carney's 19-yard field goal with no time left on the clock. 
The close decisions, though obviously heartbreaking, left little doubt that the Irish, under Holtz, would always be compet­itive. Thus far in 1987, Notre Dame's play might be charac­terized more strongly than that. The team's 8-1 record and spirited play against top teams are reminiscent of past squads of Notre Dame's illustrious col­lege football history. Hopeful­ly, Lou Holtz will be able to see his name in the company of some of the immortal coaches which have made the one hundred years of Notre Dame football unlike any other.

The Game 



By MARTY STRASEN 
Assistant Sports Editor 
UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. -Times and teams have changed since the last time Notre Dame visited Penn State's Beaver Stadium. 
A 5-3 Irish squad which had v ·m four games in a row under Gerry Faust en­tered the 1985 game with thoughts of the 44-7 upset of the Nittany Lions from the previous year still in mind. But Penn State had not forgotten that game either, and bombarded the helpless Irish by a 36-6 score in front of more than 84,000 fans to get some revenge. 
This year, it's Coach Lou Holtz' seventh-ranked Irish with something to prove. 
The Nittany Lions held off a Notre Dame threat with a dramatic goal-line stand in the waning moments of last year's game to earn a 24-19 win in the last Irish home game of the season. A potential game-winning pass by quar­terback Steve Beuerlein slipped through the hands of tight end Joel Wil­liams in the end zone. 
Holtz and the 8-1 Irish cannot afford to let Saturday's game (noon, CBS na­tional television) slip away like last year's if they want to hang onto the dream of a possible national champi­onship. 
"Penn State has beaten us five of the last six years," Holtz said at his press conference Tuesday. "We've come an awful long way, and this is an important football game. The players understand how good Penn State is. All the other things are meaningless if we don't win this game." 
Defending national champion Penn State, 7-3, is coming off a 10-0 loss to state-rival Pittsburgh, which marked the first time the Lions had been blanked in 39 games. 
The Lions' other losses were to Ala­bama, 24-13 in the second game of the season, and at Syracuse, where they were routed, 48-21. 
The Irish, meanwhile, are coming off a big win over Alabama last Saturday. Holtz' squad earned a 37-6 triumph over the Crimson Tide behind a big-play of­fense and swarming defense. 
But Beaver Stadium has never been a fun place to play for the Irish. Notre Dame has never won in the three con­tests between the teams there. 
"That's a very difficult place to go up and play in," Holtz said. "A lot of people go there with great expectations and come away awfully disappointed." 
' 
Notre Dame's offense vs. Penn State's defense 
Penn State's defense did not allow Pittsburgh and Division-1A rushing. leader Craig Heyward into the end zone in last Saturday's 10-0 loss. The only points it gave up were on a 44-yard field 
. goal, as the Panthers sealed the win with a 69-yard interception return in the fourth quarter. Coach Joe Paterno's Lions have had similar problems as the Irish this season, with injuries forcing 10 differ­ent starting lineups in as many games. Senior inside linebackers Trey Bauer and Pete Giftopoulos are two of the team's top tacklers on a defense that starts seven to eight seniors. Sophomore defensive back Brian Chizmar leads the team in tackles with 63, but his counterparts in the second­ary have been having some problems with injuries lately. The defensive line is anchored by three seniors who average about 250 pounds -Pete Curkendall (left), Aoatoa Polamalu (nose) and Matt Johnson (right). 
The Lion defense has allowed an average of 112.1 rushing and 224.1 pass­ing yards per game. 
Those numbers would seem to indi­cate that the Irish could have some suc­cess going to the air against Penn State. But anyone who has watched Notre Dame play since Tony Rice took ov~r as starting quarterback in the fifth game of the season knows that Holtz likes to keep the ball on the ground. 
The Irish are averaging 274.7 yards rushing, and if they hang on will reach their best mark in that category since 1974. Meanwhile, their 137.7-yard pass­ing average is the lowest since 1980. 
"Tony is passing the ball better and better each week," said Holtz, who might have to put Rice's arm to the test if the Irish ground game is having trou­ble. 
The multiple-back, multiple-set Notre Dame running attack has been potent in the five-game Irish win streak. Tailback Mark Green has rushed for more than 100 yards in each of the previous weeks, and broke one for a 74-yard touchdown against Ala­bama. Freshman Ricky Watters got in on the act with a 75-yard touchdown of his own minutes later. 
Of course the primary threat to Penn State will be Reisman Trophy can­didate Tim Brown at flanker. Brown 

Penn State's offense vs. Notre Dame's defense 
Last week it was the Tide's Bobby Humphrey the Irish had to stop. This week it's Blair Thomas. 
The Penn State tailback already has gained an even 1,200 yards on the year, the third-best one-year total in Nittany Lion history behind former greats Lydell Mitchell and John Cappelletti. 
"There's no way we can shut off a Blair Thomas, because he's just so good and so quick," Holtz said. "And it's just not the nature of our defense to put 11 people up on the line. We'll just have to continue to do the things we've done in the past. 
"We've had good success against the great backs this year." 
The Lions have had good success when Thomas breaks the 100-yard bar­rier this season. They sport a 7-0 record in those games. 
Senior signal-caller Matt Knitzer will

_-_, 
was returned 69 yards for the touch­down that put the game out of reach. Seven seniors start in their last home game for the Penn State offense. 
Notre Dame's defense was impres­sive in last Saturday's drubbing of Al­abama, allowing only a pair of field goals and coming up with big play after big play to thwart Crimson Tide drives in the second half. 
Junior inside linebacker Ned Bolcar is having a great year with 87 tackles to lead the team, while senior outside linebacker Cedric Figaro and junior in­side linebacker Wes Pritchett have 49 apiece. 
The Irish defense has had trouble with injuries all year, but will be aided Saturday by the return of junior free safety Corny Southall. ,Southall suf­fered ligament damage in Notre Dame's loss to Pittsburgh, and ran a few plays in the Alabama game a week ago in his first action since the injury. 
The story all year has been stop Thomas, and you can stop the Lions.

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1987 
[Must-see movies 
EUROPEAN VACATION 
FritSat Engineering Auditorium 7, 9 and 11p.m. 
Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo reprise their roles in this se­quel to "National Lampoon's Family Vacation." In this wild, farci­cal comedy, the family heads overseas, only to encounter rude and arrogant foreigners, weird food, unpleasant accomodations, and disagreeable weather. 
THERESE Fri Annenberg Auditorium 7:30 and 9:45p.m. 
A probable contender for this year's best-picture Oscar, this fine film tells the story of Therese Martin, a Carmelite nun who died at the age of 25, having seldom left her convent. Canonized less that thirty years after her death, Therese led a life of intense spirituality and faith. The story of her love affair with Christ is seen through brief and limpid episodes baring the masochism, eroticism, and purity at the heart of Therese's life. 
PARTY GIRL Mon Annenberg Auditorium 7 p.m. 
Directed by Nicolas ("Rebel Without a Cause") Ray, "Party Girl" is a ganster epic which takes place in the mob-dominated world of Chicago during the 1920s. Ray's vivid style decorates this very watchable story of a woman (Cyd Charisse) who becomes the prize package fought over by a lawyer and a vicious gangster. 
DARK VICTORY Mon Annenberg Auditorium 9 p.m. 
Betty Davis stars as a Long _Island socialite dying from a brain 
tumor and going blind in the process. George Brent is the sur­geon who falls in love with her while she is under his care. Thi~ classic tear-jerker won Academy Award nominations for Davis and the film in the year "Gone With the Wind" swept the ceremony. 
DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN Tues Annenberg Auditorium 7 and 9 p.m. 
Rosanna Arquette plays a bored suburban housewife who ex­changes identies with a free-wheeling New Wave drifter (Madonna) through a series of bizarre coincidences. This hysterically funny movie has all the elments of a '30s screwball comedy while re­taining a hip lower Manhatten flavor. The verve and panache of the cast channeled by the deft direction of Susan Seidelman enables the plot to negotiate some wildly complicated corners. 

RUNNING MAN University Park East Cinemas 
Set in the future, "The Running Man" follows the adventures of an ex-cop (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who is falsely accused of murder and sent to prison. In jail he is given the opportunity to become a contestant on a high-stakes TV game show open only to convicts. Players are chased by mercilous killers while attempting to win their freedom.

ND hosts Tommies 

By PETE SKIKO Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame hockey team faces off against St. Thomas this weekend f~r a pair of non-conference games at the Joyce ACC. 
The Irish have gotten off to an auspicious start this new season, sitting atop the Amer­ican Collegiate Hockey Associ­ation's standings board with a 3-1-2 record, 2-0-2 in the confer­ence. Head Coach Ric Schafer is not surprised with the team's success thus far. 
"We're not exactly blowing people away," said Schafer, in his debut season as head coach of the Irish. "But with the way we're playing and the way we seem to improve from week to week, we'll be able to at least stay with the teams we play. 
"Everyone's got a real good attitude, and we go out thinking we're going to win. The defense and passing are improving and we've been able to come from behind pretty well." 
St. Thomas will probably The Observer I John Studebacker pose more than a mild threat The Notre Dame hockey team, seen here In action St. Thomas In the Joyce ACC tonight and Satur­to the recently winning ways of earlier this season against Lake Forest, takes on day night.

State and DePaul to wind up the trip. 
Walk-ons Steve Nicgorski and Chris Nanni provided the finishing touches to the runaway win. 
Nicgorski entered with 4:58 and Nanni came in four seconds later. After missing the front end of a one-and-one, Nanni canned a 19-footer. He also hit the final points on a driving layup. 
Nicgorski brought what remained of the crowd to its feet with his now-patented one­arm-extended free throw style. He made four-for-five from the line.

all-time record against the Tommies from his seven years as head coach of Alaska­Fairbanks is a paltry 1-5, al­though the Irish are 7-5-1 over­all against the St. Paul, Minn., school. 
"I know that they're one of the top Division III schools around," sadi Schafer of St. Thomas. "And I know that they've given me fits every time one of my teams has come up against them.

"We had a real good season. I think the team exceeded all its expectations," said Zahm freshman Kevin Keeley, one of the team's leading scorers. "Off-Campus just had a few more chances than we did." 
So what's next for the Hoobers? Can they make it four in a row next year? 
"It should be another pretty good year," predicted Thompson. "We'll have a few players back and a few more will move off campus too. But for now we just want to enjoy this season and our celebration bash."

Irish dive into busy weekend 
By PAT KEARNS Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's and women's swim teams are looking ahead to back-to-back meets this weekend. The Irish face Ferris State Bulldogs tonight at the JACC at 7 p.m. and they travel to Wisconsin­Milwaukee Saturday to face the Panthers at 1 p.m. 
Both the men's and women's teams are 0-1, following losses to Alabama last weekend. Irish head coach Tim Welsh, who handles both the men's and wo­men's teams, is hoping for a successful performance from his squads today and tomor­row. 
"We are clearly looking for a couple of wins," said Welsh. 
The Irish men are going into the Ferris State meet with a 5-2 career record versus the Bul­ldogs, but Welsh does not ex­pect them to roll over and play dead tonight. 
"Their men's team improved dramatically from my first to second year coaching here," Welsh said. "Their team is on the move, and we expect a good meet from them." 
However, Welsh does not ex­pect too much of a challenge from the Ferris State women's team, which is in its first year. 
"Their women's team is in its ffrst year," he said. "It will be difficult for them to be balanced. They will have some areas that are not as strong as others." 
Going into Wisconsin-Milwaukee Saturday, the Irish swimmers have a more diffi­cult task at hand. 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee has a history of fine swimming teams, and the Irish men have yet to beat Wisconsin­Milwaukee in five attempts. Both Panther swim teams finished in the top ten in the nation last year. To top it off, the Irish swim teams will be fighting fatigue after its Friday night meet and leaving early Saturday morning for Mil­waukee. The Panther teams will be well-rested, coming off a Tuesday meet. 
But despite these dis­advantages, Coach Welsh ex­pects a good performance by the Irish swimmers. 
"We're going to Wisconsin­Milwaukee to swim fast, not to say we're tired because we swam last night," said Welsh. "We think we line up well with Wisconsin-Milwaukee at first place. Our plan is to win the close matchups at first and to take as many of the other places as we can." 
The Irish swim teams are getting a tough workout this weekend in an attempt to prepare for the upcoming Na­tional Catholic Championships coming up in the first week in December. 
The tournament, which will be held at Notre Dame, will be a difficult challenge for both the men's and women's teams. They will be swimming against tough opponents for three mornings and evenings in a row. 
Coach Welsh thinks the Irish are ready for their upcoming tests, citing an improv~ment in depth over last year's Irish teams. 
"We think we are faster, more balanced, and we cover a meet program better than last year. A team can score three places in 11 events, and we feel that this year we're in better to score in all 33."
