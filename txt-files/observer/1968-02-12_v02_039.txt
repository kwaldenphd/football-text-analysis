Rector Predicts Campus-Wide Stay Hall 
Rev. James Flanigan, C.S.C., rector of Dillon Hall, said Sun­day that "it's just a matter of time" until stay hall is imple­mented in every hall. He said, "Stay hall will come no later than when the new dorms are ready for occupancy." However, Fr. Flanigan maintained that, while most officials in the Admin­istration favor implementation, the Administration does not want to force it as soon as next year. 
Fr. Flanigan said that such halls as Keenan, Stanford, Breen­Phillips, and Cavanaugh, where some upperclassmen have been admitted, will soon become stay halls naturally. However, he said such halls as Badin and Sorin are so small that "it wouldn't

make much difference." 
According to Fr. Flanigan, there have been no discussions among rectors on the issue. There is "no doubt," however, that the Administration is in favor of the full implementation. Flanigan said that many rectors are strong­ly in favor of stay hall. Regard­ing the Administration attitude, he remarked "There is a view that this is a natural course of events." 
Flanigan said the new dorms could trigger final implementa­tion because of inequities of· facilities because "There would· be a rush of upperclassmen to get into them that would nec­essitate their being stay halls." 
Regarding difficulties encount­erect by stay hall, Flanigan blamed a "mystique of prestige" .for adversion to stay_ hall on the part of such halls as Sorin and Badin. In Flanigan's opinion such a mystique is "selfish and shortsighted." 
As a stay hall rector, Fr. Flapigan himself feels that "Stay hall is a very good idea. People who know about it always seem to favor it." Regarding Dillon, he said that he had "never heard any complaints about the fresh­
men in mv hall. The resolution concerning Stay Hall, passed by the Gen­eral Assembly of Students last week, is reasonably assured of administrative approval and sub­sequent campus wide realization

We're looking for aggressive, talented young engi­neers like Randy. We want you if you want significant responsibility from the start. In fact, we need more engineers than ever before. That's because we're grow­ing faster. Sales were $560 million last year. Up 17 per cent. 
That's how it's been from the beginning. We started by next year. According to Mike Jordan, Stay Hall Committee chairman, the resolution was the product of research and study initiated in the fall. 
Since last fall, a committee in each hall on campus has been researching and formulating, "a feasible plan for Stay Hall." Their arrangements are to revolve around the uniqueness of the individual hall and may include any pertinent suggestions for im­provement of hall life. 
By February 15, all reports are to be passed by the hall councils and sent to Jordan, who is assisted by Dave Calabria and Sam Boyle. And here is where 
the new legislation holds its weight. Instead of each hall deciding by referendum whether to go Stay Hall or not, the way is cleared to proceed with a comprehensive plan. Jordan will co-ordinate all the reports with a view towards allocating freshmen equally across the cam­
pus. 
Still he emphasizes the role of the individual hall in deter­mining their own arrangements. For example, if a hall like Fisher could present a logical argument against their housing offreshmen, Jordan would accept the pro­
posal. However, the goal remains, he says, "each hall will have freshmen by next year."

Power and the Machine 
.......................................... 

Wednesday night at the General Assembly, with a tremendous 
roar, there was approved a strong resolution on student self-govern­
ment. Enactment of this resolution would mean the final oblitera­
tion of paternalism and the establishment of a true Notre Dame 
community. I fear, though, that the bill will in the end produce 
little if anything. My fears for the negotiations on self-goyernment 
are based on one simple fact-those negotiations are entrusted to 
this year's student government. 
I will confess that Hall Life Commissioner Tom Brislin made a 
dramatic appeal for passage. He made a dramatic appeal for the de­
claration of student rights at the Student Senate, but nothing was 
done. Why not? 
I would suggest that the answer lies with student government it­
self. As I see it, Student government is a machine, a self-perpetua­
ting, self-fulfilling, and above all self-servient entity. Two years 
ago, under Minch Lewis, we had an idealistic student government, 
but the organization men were back in charge last year and, with 
the Murphy machine, certainly this year. The organization politics 
do not stop now, though, for one machine generates another. When 
we finally rid ourselves of the Murphy administration, there are the 
Rembusch men, and perhaps the Rigney men two years from now. 
Besides being self-perpetuating, student government is self-fulfil­
ling. Certainly the dances run on time, and there are various bread 
and circuses, especially the latter, during the year. However, there 
is too little overall application of new ideas, or the courageous pur­
suit of new programs. Only with Lewis and the plan for abolition of 
curfews has there been daring initiative from abo.re, from student 
government itself. 
The self-servient aspect is perhaps most blatant. There seems to 
be a Byzantine intrigue in student government, intrigue which, 
means that 50% of what goes on is usually under the surface. A 
proposal is made to the Senate to change the means of electing the 
Student Union President, giving authority to this year's board be­
fore student body elections. This is said to "get the Union out of 
politics," but dissenting evaluation reveals that politics are indeed 
involved. This year's powers that are wish their nominee chosen even 
if the insider's candidate is not elected to the Presidency. 
One might wonder, too, about the spurt being displayed by the 
Academic Commission now that Chuck Nau is running for Vice Pres­
ident. Th_e Commission had not a lecture in January and the first 
week ofFebruary, but now, in the two weeks prior to the elections, 
four speakers including Sargeant Shriver are scheduled. 
I know I am being outrageously negative about all of this. Many 
in position serve the student body selflessly. However, the in-crowd 
machine system as a whole is absurd. Student government leaders 
are too often concerned with the attaining of power and dispensing 
of influence rather than student service. For instance, when Hubert 
Humphrey spoke here last year, there were four separate sets of tic-
ke.ts for those to hear him-one ticket got you into the balcony, 
another onto the floor, a third up to a microphone, a fourth to the 
reception, and a fifth to the exclusive banquet. Even at the banquet 
there was a seating arrangement. Your degree of participation de­
pended on your degree of belonging and who you knew. 
So, with the Assembly over and strong resolutions passed, I 
doubt what will be done because I doubt the machine system, a 
system which, while clothed in radicalism now, is still the same. I 
fear we have given our accounts to Bonnie and Clyde.

Time was when being sent off-campus to make your home was pretty much equiva­lent to being sent off to bed without any supper, and you just sort of hoped that you could raise your average enough so that the ever~benevolent University would let you "back on" next semester. 
The major drawback to living in the 
wilds of that garden spot of the Midwest, South Bend, Indiana, was that, unless you were 21 and had wheels, cummuting was something of a pain. Besides that the housing, no matter how motherly your landlady was, still left something to be desired; part of that reason was the mere existence of that landlady. 
Ah, but times have changed; in the past two years off-campus people have been al­lowed to have cars and a house now meant a home. But what's this black cloud rising in the future? That dark shape nur­
tured in the mind of some visionary pla!:!­ner has taken on the form of the residence university. Holy housing, Batman, not that! No more off-campus; no more free­dom from the confines of dorm life; no more getting away from it all; no more loud, enjoyable blasts with friends without the rector, or prefect or jerk next door bothering you. No more entertaining your girl in the confines of your own abode. 
In light of the obvious deprivations that dorm life would impose, it seems that pos­sibly the administration has been to hasty in its desire to put up tj10se new highrisers. But it's too late for us to squawk; the con­tracts have been signe.d, the designs drawn up; besides, who are we to complain? We're only the people who have to live in those dorms and suffer the parochial at­mosphere of a residen,ce university. 
But maybe something can be done; maybe if we start to holler now three years from now when the present freshmen are seniors, there will be space set aside for 
those who want to live out of the confines of a dorm. After all, instead of packing I ,000 or so students into the new halls the ever-benevolent administration could start by alleviating the ·crowded conditions in the old halls such as Dillon or Howard which should have been done years ago. 
Its up to the student politicians, like our two smiling candidates for SBP, Mr. Rossie and Mr. Dowd, and to student ac­tion groups like ASP to start putting pres­sure on the men in Black for continued off­campus life. If we yell long enough and loud enough quite possibly three years from now when the new buildings are up the administration, whom we all know cares so much for our well being, will care a little bit more and let those who want to live off-campus do so. 
If we wait until they have corraled the rest of us into dorms, it will be harder than ever then to make the administration, slow in its ways and quite stubborn about where 
. the boys are, set us free of the claustro­phobic bounds of this dear, dead old cam­
pus. 

A Raw Deal 
While the executive branch of Student 

Government made most of last week's news with the historic General Assembly of Students, a parliamentary action of the legislative branch (i.e., the renowned Stu­dent Senate) went relatively unnoticed. But that motion could have important re­percussions upon the future of the Student Government in the service area. Without much debate, a constitutional amendment which would have allowed the outgoing Student Union Board of Directors to ap­point the new President was quietly sent to committee, where it will most likely be lost. 
Michael Browning, who has done an ex­cellent job formulating the direction of the Student Union in its first year, had worked with the Senate Union Committee in the drafting of a proposal that would both take the appointment of the Union President out of the realm of petty stu­dent politics, and enable the selection to be made at the end of the first semester. 
Both reasons appear solid. Under Mr. Browning's able direction, the Student Union has developed into a highly effi­cient, non-political organization. With a budget of close to two-hundred thousand dollars, and plans for expansion into more areas of service to the student body next year, the Student Union should not have its leadership appointments dependent in any way upon the fluctuations and whims of both candidates and campaigns. A minor corporation of this nature demands an experienced man at the top. He must be judge:i upon his intelligence, diligence, and administrative capacities, not upon his political prowness in backing the right
candidate. · 
Both size and schedule demands support of the second section of the proposal. Bas­ed upon his own experience, and the fore­seen expansion of the lhion, Mr. Brown­ing has pointed out the need for added 
time to train the incoming Union President. In addition, he found that the task of arranging an academic and ·social schedule for the coming year must be started before the end of the first ScHlester. 
Yet, sound logic did not deter the Sen­ate from its own task of deep considera­tion. Some Senators objected to. even al­lowing Mr. Browning to speak, and a vote 
had to be taken to give him the Door. In the meantime, more of the best con­cert attractions and speakers have already been booked at other Universities, and the Student Body President race officially op­ens today. Rick Rem busch is working with Ric~ Rossie, and would certainly be the best choice in any case. But who has 
Mr. Dowd picked? Perhaps it would be better to raffle off the Student Union Presidency at Mardi Gras. Perhaps it would be better to raffle off the Senate seats at 
Mardi Gras.

Dow Chemical is undo_ubtedly a nice company to work for. American housewives use its deodorants, spray, and other para­phenalia to cleanse and sanitize their bathrooms and to keep their homes spic and span. But alas and alack in the year of the preco­
cious student poor Dow has taken the proverbial lumps. 
Dow has become the American hyena, th-e imperialist bourgeois swine. Rightly so, they say. Dow as we all know manufactures na­palm which is synonomous with mortal sin in the New Left cate­
chism. Napalm, burner of children, maimer of civilians, dark char­latan of the countryside, a veritable Black Plague in fire's clothing. Last week Dow came to Notre Dame or rather Notre Dame came 
to Dow and she came two hundred strong. Under the flowering can­opy of the Golden Dome, in the sacred halls of Du Lac, the voice of dissent was heard once again. It was a giant awareness day for those 
who have to prove that they are aware. It was a sort of communion of consciousness . 
The diehard contingent sang, sat and loved in the Ad building and reminded each other that their mentality was miles apart from the petty bourgeois, the maintainers of the holy war orthodoxy. 
Even Mr. Murphy, our SBP au extroadinaire, was quoted as say­ing that real nitty-gritty awarebess had finally come to the praiiies of the Midlands. All fine and good I suppose but somehow and s01rewhere there was a distinct smell of intellectual paralysis and a slight taint of shallowness. 
Lenin once said something to the effect that facts cannot be 
dodged. I think that he was right. The plain fact is that Dow and the rest of American industry does not perpetuate Vietnam. On the contrary, the war is pushed and determined on a political level. Dow Chemical does not order in napalm strikes. Kaiser Jeep does not send weapons via jeep to Saigon. 
But someone might protest that Dow is a symbol for this war and all its horror. This is somehow not even legitimate. The flyer announcing the demonstration pointed out that demonstrations might persuade the government to discontinue their contract. It said nothing about discontinuing Vietnam. A sign at the demon­stration proclaimed that napalm did not discriminate. It said no­thing about the fact that wars are not segregated affairs. 
Napalm just happens to be a very effective weapon and it hap­pens to kill innocent people just as other weapons destroy innocent 
people. Napalm like other military weapons also protects people 
/
like Marines who don't really want to die either. The demonstration against Dow seemed to be asking for a re­
turn to a gentleman's war, a sort of good-hearted joust in the pas­ture. It seemed to ask for a mixture of Christian humanism and tac­tical nuclear weapons. The blending tasted like sheer poppycock. 
The demonstration was led by a ragtag band of Trotskyites and 
religious profligates and the leadership reflected the unclear motives of the sit-in itself. It was a political action undertaken by people in apolitical trappings, led by others who couldn't decide between re­volution in a sandbox or a fideistic love-in. 
It would seem that it would be more meaningful to take legiti­
mate political action and stop holding hands to proclaim your con­
cern, consciousness and inherent intelligence. A first step to ending 
this maddening war might well be the Mock Political Convention. 
If the New Left would like to wipe out Dow Chemical, I would 
suggest that they also knock off the Chinese who first invented gun­
powder. At least on this point our chauvinistic radicals would agree 
with the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Boo-Hoo  
Cries Out  
By SAM RUMORE  
"If we could get everyone to  
pass the peacepipe around, we  
wouldn'thave any more wars."So  
~poke Charlie Brown,black-caped,  
button-carrying Boo Hoo of the  
Berl<ely Bag of the Nco-American  
Church, Friday evening at IU  
Extension.  
Brown said that when conflicts  
,  arose, the Indians would smoke a  
pipe containing herbs to make  
one think. "They lived beautiful  
lives," Brown said. A major part  
of the evening was devoted to  
the peacepipe ceremony. Brown  
sat yoga-fashioned on a desk, lit  
a candle before a cross, and called  
upon the Four Winds, the Earth,  
and the Sky. Then he passed the  
oeacepipe around to all.  
Speaking and singing on "The  
New Age", Brown made com­ 
ments on a broad spectrum of  
topics. Throughout the evening  
,..  he proclaimed that our society  
was sick to its very core. "People  
are selfish, greedy, and the world  
is headed toward nuclear disaster.  
However, the choice is left to us  
whether or not the world is to  
become a cluster of dead aster­ 
oids," Brown said.  
According to Brown, there are  
slavemakers in the world who are  
out to own everything. But peo­ 
ple are turning on, becoming  
aware to them. Brown sees the  
Hippies as {he most significant  
S(Jritual movement this country  
has ever known.  
When asked who the slave­ 
makers were, Brown refused a  
direct answer. He said the slave­ 
makers seek to divide. "J.C. and  
Buddha wanted to turn ori the  
people. But slave-makers stop  
that real quick." Brown said they  
distort things andestablish "Chur­ 
chianity."  
Concerning some of his other  
activities, Brown said that he is  
I  presently taking an "LSD and  
I  I I  ,  Religion" test case through the courts. He said that his Neo-Am­erican Chruch is teaching people  
how to use drugs safely.  
Brown was a candidate for the  
Berkely City Council in 1967. He  
is presentiy running for the Cali­ 
fornia legislature as a Republican.  
In relation to drugs he said  
that drugs weren't the only way  
to turn on, just the most effi­ 
cient. He is presently fighting the  
LSD laws in the courts, claiming  
he uses them as sacraments and  
using as precedent the peyote of  
Indians. Towards the end of the  
talk he said that he was and had  
been all evening under the influ­ 
ence of LSD.

Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore 
By TOM EHRBAR 
Saturday afternoon, in the Mahogany Room of the Morris Inn, the Notre Dame Alumni Board of Directors met with I 5 Notre Dame students in an in­formal discussion session designed to bridge the communications gap between the Notre Dame alumni and students. Essentially, it was an attempt by the alumni to learn how the present stud­ents feel about life at Notre Dame. 
To a student body that be­lieves the Notre Dame alumni are totally "out of it" and are concerned solely with procuring football tickets for the Michigan State game, this meeting, which was designed to bring the Alum­ni Board into closer contact with campus feeling, is a revelation in itself. 

Alumni Get With It 
One of the leading forces be­hind this meeting was Richard Rosenthal, the new president of the Alumni Board. Mr. Rosenthal himself is an indication of the alumni's changing attitudes. Thr­oughout the entire session, he displayed great interest and a genuine desire to know what "bugs" Notre Dame students and how they feel about such issues as James Kavanaugh's speech, pa­rietal hours, food riots, George Kennan's article on student u n­rest, and student drinking. 
The man Mr. Rosenthal re­placed is Ambrose "Bud" Dud­ley. Mr. Dudley is best remem­bered by Notre Dame students as the author of an editorial in a recent issue of "Alumnus" magazine. In this editorial, Mr. Dudley lamented the changing attitudes at Notre Dame, especi-

ally the relaxation of certain rules and regulations, such as curfew. He said that Notre Dame has only two great bastions left, no drinking and no women, and these must be defended at all costs. One of the students at the Saturday session commented on this attitude by saying: "At times, I wonder if I am attend­ing the same university the alum­
ni talk about." 
Richard Rosenthal bears no -< resemblance whatsoever to Mr. Dudley. On parietal hours, stu­dent drinking, and other such is­sues, Mr. Rosenthal expressed a more modern point of view. 
"In a university, students have the responsibility to live by the regulations," Rorenthal said. "The regulations on parietal hours have been stated, and until they are changed, students have an obli­gation to live by them ... whe­ther you feel they are good or not." 
It would be a lie if I said 4 I never took a drink before I was 21, but I was willing to accept the consequences if I was caught. This also applies to parietal hours. If you break the rules, you must be prepared to accept the consequences if you are caught." 
"We (the alumni) do not ob­ject to the rights of students to try and change the regulations, but we feel that you, as students, must live by the laws until they are changed." 
Change was the keynote to Saturday's meeting. A change in the alumni's point of view as they learned ofstudent problems. A change in the attitude of the alumni as manifested in their new president, Richard Rosen­thal. The final change was in student awareness as they real­ized that some alumni, at least, really do care.

..... 
Notre Dame cagers dropped their second' 
straight game in Chicago Stadium, 73-76 to lOth rated Duke Saturday night. The Irish never led after the opening minutes, although they forced 
ten ties. Duke's Dave Golden fired in 12 of his 22 points in a surge that carried Duke to a big first half lead. Bob Whitmore and Bob Arnzen pulled Notre Dame back again and again, rallying to within 70-67 at 2:27. But two missed one-and-one foul shots killed Irish hopes. Whitmore led the scoring for Notre Dame with 21 points, while Arnzen's 20 markers gave him l ,043 carrer points and a tie for 11th place on the all-time Notre Dame scoring list. 
Bill (Soul Bird) Hurd tied meet and Fieldhouse records for the 60-yard dash at the Michigan State Relays Saturday. Hurd's time of :06.1 tied the mark set by MSU's Bob Marland in 1963 and 1964. Notre Dame's relay squads had varied success, taking second in the sprint medley relay 
Notre Dame fencers continued their masterful performance Saturday, defeating Detroit 17-10 and the University of Chicago 20-7. Now 8-0 for the season, the Irish boast a 26-match win streak over two campaigns-a school record. 
In the friendly confines of their Fieldhouse, Notre Dame wrestlers overpowered Cincinnati 22-9 Saturday. Keith Giron ( 123 pounds) won his seventh match without a Joss, while Cincin­nati's Stan Bradley ( 152 pounds) upped his season mark to 9-0. Par Mudron, a 6' 1 ", 250­pound freshman football guard, made his Notre Dame debut a success by pinning Dan Gesymalla 
in the second period. Mudron beat out Mike McCoy for the right to wrestle in the heavyweight slot. 
Irish swimmers carried Northwestern down to the final relay before bowing 63-50 Friday night. The Joss evened Notre Dame's record at 4-4. 

'MORNINGS AT SEVEN  AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT 
Any man who says morning is the best time of day is either a liar or a meadow lark. 
There is only one way to make morning enjoyable: sleep till noon. Failing that, the very best you can do is ~o make morning. tolerable. This, I am pleased to report, IS possible if you will follow three simple rules: 
1. Shave properly.

By shaving properly I mean shaving quietly. Don't use a blade that whines and complains. Morning being a time of danger and anger, use a blade that neither clangs nor angs. Use a blade that makes no ain on your chin, no squeak on your cheek, no howl on your jowl, no rip on your lip, no waves while it shaves. Use, in short, Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades. 
I have been shaving for 71 years (not too impressive until one considers that I am 49 years old) and I am here to tell you that the quietest blade I know is Personna. I not only shave with Personna, but I also admire it. Old vir­tues reappear in Personna; old values are reborn. Per­sonna is ·a modest blade, an undemanding blade. Personna does not rasp and tug, yelling, "Hey, lookit me!" No, sir, not Personna! Silently, respectfully, unobtrusively, Per­sonna whisks your whiskers with nary a whisper. It shucks your soil and stubble without toil and trouble. Why, you hardly know it's there, this well-bred Personna blade, this paragon of punctilio.
Moreover, this crown of the blade-maker's art, this epitome of epidermal efficacy, is available both in Double­edge style and Injector style. Do your kisser a favor: get some. 
2. Breakfa.c;t properly. 

I assert that a Personna shave is the best of all possible shaves. But I do not assert that a Personna shave, brac­ing though it may be, is enough to prepare you for the hideous forenoon ahead. After'shaving you must eat an ample breakfast. 
Take, for example, the case of Basil Metabolism, a soph­omore at V.M.I. Basil, knowing there was to be an inspec­tion by .the Commandant one morning, prepared by stor­ing up energy. He recognized that coffee and juice would not sustain him, so he had a flitch of bacon, a clutch of eggs, a batch of bagels, a notch of ham, a bunch of ~utter, a swatch of grits, a hutch of honey, a patch of Jelly, a thatch of jam, a twitch of pepper, and a pinch of salt. 

The idea was right; the quantities, alas, were not. When the Commandant arrived, Basil, alas, was so torpid that he could not raise his bloated arm in p. proper salute. He was, of course, immediately shot by a firing squad. Today, a perforated man, he earns a meagre living as a collander in Cleveland. 
B. Read properlj,. 

Always read the paper at breakfast. It inhibits bolting. But do not read the front page. That is full of bad, acid­making news. Read a more pleasant part of the paper­the Home and Garden section, for example. 
For instance, in my local paper, The Westport Peasant, there is a delightful column called "Ask Harry Home­spun" which fairly bristles with bucolic wisdom and many an earthy chuckle. I quote some questions and answers: 
Q: 
I am thinkinJ of buying some power tools. What should I get first? 

A: Hospitalization. 
Q: Howdoyougetridofmoles? 
A : Pave the lawn. 


Q: 
What is the best way to put a wide car in a narrow garage? 


A : Butter it. 

Q: What do you do for elm blight? 
A: Salt water gargle and bed rest. 
Q: What can I do for dry hair? 
A: Get a wet hat.

,.. 
Now, that's a pretty funny thing for a civilian firm to say. A boss? Right out of college? The first day? 
But the Air Force can make such offers. 
As an officer in the world's largest technological organization you're a leader. Engineer. Scientist. Administrator. Right where the Space Age break­throughs are happening. 
Or how about the executive respon­sibility of a test pilot clocking 2,062 mph in a YF-12A jet? 
That could be you, too. 
But you don't have to be a pilot in the Air Force to move fast. With your college degree you zip into Officer Training School, spin out an officer, speed on your way as an executive, in the fore­front of modern science anti technology. Right on the ground. 
The Air Force moves pretty fast. 
Think it over. A man's career can sometimes move prett slow.
