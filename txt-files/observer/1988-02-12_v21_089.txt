SMC Task Force to study minority issues 
By BRADLEY GALKO Staff Reporter 
A report on minority students by Saint Mary's Diversifica­tion Task Force will be pre­sented to the College's presi­dent and Board of Regents in April, said Pamela Bethel, task force member. 
The task force's purpose is "to come up with an action plan for the recruiting and retention of minority students," and "to develop ideas to promote a more culturally aware campus," said Bethel, adding that the plan will also extend to recruiting more minority faculty and staff. 
Mary Ann Rowan, task force chairwoman and Saint Mary's director of admissions, was un­available for comment. 
Minority students constitute a "really small percentage" of Saint Mary's student body, Bet­hel said. Present efforts of the task force to increase this num­ber have concentrated on studying and working with other schools around the country, she said. She ex­plained that this has been ac­complished through question­naires sent to other schools, guest speakers, and atten­dance of regional conferences 
on  the  subject  of  minority  
recruitment  by  task  force  
members.  

''A lot of (other) schools have good programs ... to recruit and serve minority students," Bethel said. 
Many decisions still have to be made by the task force, said Bethel, such as whether or not only one or two minorities should be concentrated on, what services should be developed, and exactly how they should be developed. She said it will take a "well-

ND 's '88 debate readies candidates 
By JIM WINKLER Staff Reporter 
The race for the next Notre Dame stu­dent body president is drawing close as candidates prepare for the annual debate on Sunday, Feb. 14. 
The nine candidates for student body president have all been invited to partic­ipate in the debate in the Hesburgh Li­brary Auditorium at 7:30 p.m., said Erika Olmsted, presidental debate com­mittee chairwoman. 
By 5 p.m. Thursday, seven tickets had indicated to Ombudsman that they would take part in the debate. The two remain­ing tickets have until Friday afternoon to respond. 
The debate will begin with opening statements from each candidate, not to exceed two and a half minutes in length, Olmsted said. 


Candidates' statements will be fol­lowed by questions from campus media sources and a 30-minute open question session. They will then be allowed two minutes for closing remarks. The Om­budsman will serve as official

Rep. Richard Gephardt turned on 
Democratic presidential rival Michael 
Dukakis on Thursday, declaring him ig­

pleaded with Republicans to help him 
stem Bob Dole's tide in New Hampshire.

Dukakis, the leader in New Hampshire's tightening Democratic con­test, stressed his role as opponent of the unopened Seabrook nuclear power plant as he campaigned in front of a clam bar designated as an evacuation shelter in case of accident. 
Jesse Jackson and Sen. AI Gore shunned New Hampshire, Gore touting his chances in southern states that vote next month while Jackson aimed a few barbs at his rivals. 
Dukakis has "every advantage," he said. "He lives there. He is at home, he's dripping in money. And of course Dukakis, Gephardt and Simon are using money and commercials. I'm using mes­sage, service and experience."

Making the grade: Are 

pass/fail 
By SCOTT BEARBY Assistant News Editor 
A 'P' may stand for 'pass­ing' under the pass1ail grade option, but it also may mean 'penalty' for juniors and seniors who are consid­ering post-graduate studies. 
The pass1ail option was in­stituted in 1970 in an attempt to give students the opportu­nity to explore courses out­sides their majors, without the pressures of grading. 
But graduate and profes­sional schools are now ques­tioning whether applicants are merely trying to take the easy way out in lightening his or her course load, said Robert Waddick, assistant dean of the College of Arts and Letters. 
"It is understandable that many admissions officers are already discounting it (a 

courses 
grade-point average) more if there is a large proportion of pass1ail grades," Wad­dick said, citing a 1970 state­ment issued by the Law School Admission Council. 
Waddick said law schools 
and graduate schools weigh 

the mandatory tests (LSAT 
A's and B's at NO 
Part 3 of a three-part series 
and GRE) more for students with pass1ail grades. "What that report said then is still true today," he said. 
Under the University's academic code, a junior or senior may take one pass1ail elective course each semes­ter. Grades 'A' through 'D' are considered passing, and 

worth it? 
no notification of the stu­dent's intent is given to the professor. 
Waddick said he dis­courages the 30 percent of the graduating class who seek to enter graduate and professional schools from taking pass1ail courses be­cause of the position taken by admissions committees. "A 'P' can be read as a 'D'," he said. 
Vincent Raymond, associ­ate dean of the College of Business Administration, said he agrees that pass1ail courses are not a good idea for those applying to law school and graduate school. 
Waddick advised that stu­dents interested in post­graduate studies who wish to take a pass1ail course should wait until the eighth

quickly than the rats that 
weren't handled. 
Sapolsky said the experi­ment proved that the mere act of adding sensory stimulation to the lives of the rats at a very early age enabled them to more efficiently handle stress throughout their lives. And by coping more efficiently with stress, the rats secrete less of a class of hormones called glucocorticoids. He said these hormones are known to cause the loss of brain cells that are critical in the thought processes. 
"Lots of these hormones and lots of stress will accelerate neuron death in the brain," he said. "And this happens in a part of the brain that has a lot to do with learning and memory. It will accelerate some of the learning deficits (associated with aging)." 
Sapolsky said the simple act of handling the rats seems to determine exactly how the rats respond to stress. 
"It turns out that what han­dling (the rats) does is make a very, very sharp, well-defined brake (on the stress response)," he said. "As a result of the brake working bet­ter" the rat throughout its life secretes less brain-damaging hormone. 
Sapolsky said autopsies of the rats showed that the han­dled rats had fewer killed neurons than the rats that had not been handled. And the only difference in their life, he said, had been that brief period of additional attention during in­fancy. 
He said it is not clear if the response of the rats provides a model for a similar phenomeon in humans or if this finding would have any application in better understanding senility or Alzheimer's disease.

FrVSat Engineering Auditorium 8 and 10 p.m. 
Alexandra Medford (Cher), Jane Spofford (Susan Sarandon), and Sukie Ridgemont (Michelle Pfeiffer) meet every Thursday to complain about their dull lives. After one such night a man named Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson) moves into their sleepy New England town of Eastwick. He seems to be everything they've ever wanted --he's dynamic enough to challenge their own strong spirits. Do they have some power which brought Daryl to them? And, who is Daryl? George Miller directs this comic film which quickly becomes a battle of the sexes. 
PRICK UP YOUR EARS Fri Annenberg Auditorium 7:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. 
Stephen Frears' sequel to "My Beautiful Laundrette", tells the tragic story of Joe Orton (Gary Oldman) , a celebrated British playwright, and Ken Halliwell (Alfred Molina), his friend and teacher. The film is very well done, and Frears proves himself to be a superior director. However, it should be said that this film can be difficult to watch at times. 
ALL THAT JAZZ Mon Annenberg Auditorium 7 p.m. and 9:30p.m. 
Roy Scheider gives a fantastic performance as director, Bob Fosse's alter ego in this autobiographical film about the magical, yet de­manding world of Broadway muscials. The dance choreography and acting are superb as was confirmed by this film winning five Academy Awards.

Are all their plans for the future over? Will Stan study architecture at Cal Tech and will Darcy become a journalist at their state university? Unlike most stories which deal with teenage pregnancy, this film offers an optimistic view of the situation. Darcy and Stan are pre­sented as strong individuals who are truly In love, so that with these characteristics they have a fighting chance. 
Rock with a twist 
MARK NEMEC accent writer 

1\ publication once described ~ne of their recent concerts as having everything a concert should have ''with the excep­tion of drugs, alcohol, profanity, topless women, and vulgar lyrics"--and they are coming to South Bend. . 
Eddie DeGarmo and Dana Key are coming to Saint Mary's O'l..aughlin Auditorium Saturday night, riding a wave of new Christian contemporary music that has made Amy Grant and the rock group Stryper famous. The difference is, that these two have been singing about Jesus for ten years. 
DeGarmo and Key have known each other since high school and during that time, went through many different "garage" bands. Gradually they gained popularity and, while with a group called "Globe", received a recording contract with a prominent London label. However, after two of their long-time friends became born­again Christians, their attitudes towards some of the songs they were singing. changed. 
These performers did not switch to Christian rock for means of success. In a recent article of Contemporary Christ­ian Music magazine, DeGarmo stated "It's all a matter of what you are called to do. We've al­ways felt that we were called to win kids to Jesus Christ; that's our mission and that's our goal. There are a lot of people out there who are called to make great music and to enter­tain people; I'm not arguing that, but evangelism is our original mission. As long as we keep winning kids to Christ. I know we are In the Lord's will." 
Both DeGarmo and Key are dedicated to this mission. The release of their tenth album, "D ~ K", has a special feature: For every cassette that Is bought. the purchaser receives an identical cassette for free with the Instructions "Give one away ... to a friend who needs to hear!" They are also throwing their efforts Into the Mission Aviation Fellowship, a Christian organization that helps mis­sionaries and workers reach some of the less reachable parts of 25 developing countries around the world. 
The MAF Is In trouble as to the type of equipment they are using. "When we were in Zaire. flying around the Belgian Con­go, we were in a Cessna made in 1959," stated Key. "We're hoping we can encourage sup­port for the MAF and raise some money and buy them a new plane." The cost: 200,000 dollars, or about the cost most bands pay for a nice tour bus. 
Saturday night at 7:30p.m., DeGarmo and Key will bring their unique style of music with a message to the O'Laughlin Auditorium. Tickets are avail­able the O'l..aughlin box office, the Century Center box office, and all area Christian bookstores. Cost is $9.50 in advance, $1 1.50 at the door, and groups of ten or more are $7.50 each. For more informa­tion, call 284-4626.

How to choose a valentine: a helpful job description 
ful. In asking a person, whom 
you have perceived to be dear, 
to be your sweetheart. you're 
not inviting that person to be­
come your "Hot-lips Houlihan" 
or any other kind of sex object 
that temporarily please you. 
That's not love-stuff; it's seduc­
tion which could lead to a new 
version of the St. Valentine's 
Day Massacre. 
True love, when you finally find it, is not apt to arrive neutered of passion; but If you're reasoning with wolfish lust dressed up as Mary's little lamb, one or both of you is dancing to the wrong music. Instead of "My Funny Valen­tine," one of you could be humming: "Square-shape, or pear-shape, those rocks don't lose their shape; and Diamonds are a girl's best friend." 
After all, if a worker is worthy of his or her hire, the price should be right; why would you settle for Fanny Farmer's? "Had we but world enough and time," Marvell propositioned his coy mistress, "this coyness, lady, were no crime." The mood of that poem is too heady to be imprinted on a valentine. 
Is the emotion of a valentine, then, limited to love's first fine rapture? It may begin there, but it can extend all the way to "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways," and I hope it will. But a valentine verse, I think, is to love what the bap­tismal prayer is to faith. 
"Be my valentine? Be the one in whom my dreams can find fulfillment--be my soul's other half. Be the wine bubbling in my blood stream to keep me joyful. Be the love in my heart that keeps me in love with love. Be my valentinel--and notice I'm no longer begging like a sick fool. Bold with love, I'm now trying to take charge of your devotion, if it's not sure of Itself.'' 
The language on a valentine may be time-worn and conven­tional, as that of Romeo and Juliet at their first meeting, when they were playing games with words. 
The young cliches can be improved on by time, until fi­nally the images serve love which does not alter "when It alteration finds," and love's dream can become Yeatsian: "Would that we were, my beloved, white birds on the foam of the seal" 
"An aged man is but a paltry 
thing," wrote Yeats, "A tattered 
coat upon a stick, unless Soul 
clasp its hands and sing." Have 
I sailed the sea and come to 
the holy city of Byzantium; is it 
silly to believe In love's young 
dream? 
"0 sages standing in God's holy fire, Camel. ..and be the singing masters of my soul." I am an Irish romantic, pas­sionate about passion that Is a lifetime long. It began as a dream that a boy, needing love, had In his adolescence. Needing love, he waited for love to come along In a per­sonal way; he trusted love, which was meant for him, to find him. 
Must one be on a sailboat ride to Byzantium to believe that golden lads and girls-­who must, as chimney­
sweepers, come to dust--all 
expect to meet Love before 
they meet Death? 
Doesn't every kid grow up, 
aching Inside to be loved, sure 
that some exact person has 
been assigned to fulfill his or 
her need for love. Is anyone so 
dull of soul that he or she 
doesn't have a fantasy of fal­
ling In love? 
Happiness is contingent on 
your falling in love sometime, 
whether the love leads to mar­
riage or not: or even to a 
renunciation of marriage, to be 
In loving service to God for a 
lifetime. 
That destiny of falling in love that each of us waits for, is what, I think, is celebrated in a playful, childlike, wholesome way on St. Valentine's feast. We shop around among love's likely candidates, asking: "Are you the one? Do you want to be my valentine?" 
If you decide you valentine Is not the one you should keep, you can enjoy the day as a dress rehearsal for love, which, next year, may be the real and lasting thing. 
Knowing this, you can, If you wish, send valentine's greetings to your grandmother. She's only a stand-In for the valen­tine of your heart's desire, and that's all you should want her to be--hopefully, she has already met the valentine who fulfills her. 
How many of you, when you think of It, really want my cocker spaniel, Darby O'Gill, as your valentine? If he thought of it, do you think he would want you? 

T
he feast of St. Valentine has been half-spoiled by commercialism. Hallmark and the florists grow undeservediy rich that day. Lucy, in Peanuts, complains that Christmas is a money-racket run by an Eas­tern syndicate. 
Father Robert Griffin 
Letters to a Lonely God 
and pounds and guineas' But not your heart away ... " 
Still, love Is love, even if you're young; and young love is lyrical, like a song by Bobbie Burns: "Till a' the seas gang dry, my dear:! And the rocks melt wi' the sun;/ And I will luve 

She could very well be equally cynical about what has happened to February 14, taken over by opportunists, who mass-produce cards ad­dressed to everyone from your grandmother to the family gynecologist. The poet e.e. cummings tells us: "Lovers alone wear sunlight," whatever that means, and I hope it's 
good. 
For the sake of love, we should decide on a job descrip­tion of what it means when we say: "Be My Valentine." After that, we can decide whether it's proper to send a Valentine's greeting to an aunt or uncle, as long as we do it as a com­pliment, telling them that they're the last of the real great sports, and that we'd travel to the end of the earth to meet their match. 
A noted bishop has reminded Christians that the kind of lan­guage that they use for prayer should be the kind of language they use in making love. In other words, avoid the "thees" and "thous" and the circum­locutions you find in the Psalms. 
I'd like to suggest another rule of thumb: valentines are meant for the sweetheart you'd send love poems to. The valen­tines you Initially send should be shy, exploratory, tentative, and cautious; that is, you should take Housman's warn­ing seriously: "When I was young and twenty I heard a wise man say: "Give crowns 
thee still, my dear/While the sand o' life shall run." 
True love is prone to exag­gerate, as in a Cole Porter lyric: "You're the tops; you're the Coliseum;/ You're the Pops; you're the Louvre museum.. .' Is the beauty here mostly in the eye of the beholder? 
Shakespeare, praising his inamorata, repudiated the hy­perboles: "I have seen roses damasked, red and white/ But no such roses see I in her cheeks." 
Love, like wine and cheese, grows mellow with age. The poet Donne, wanting to consult an authority, told us: "I long to talk with some old lover's ghost, who died before the god of love was born.'' 
Yeats, a veteran at carrying torches for a love that was un­requited, wrote: "When you are old and grey and full of sleep! And nodding by the fire, take down this book/ And slowly read../But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you/And loved the sorrows of your changing face .. .'' 
Love's language, as you can see, Is highly specialized and private, and has nothing to do with the appreciation you feel for the butcher, the baker, and the candlestick maker. This is why we should get back to the drawing board, and write a description of what is offered, what is hoped for, when a valentine is sent. 
A valentine's message should be Innocent, simple, and hope-

The power of the breathalyzer 
The Office of Alcohol and Drug Education basked in the spotlight this week, garnering the J?Ublicity which alwaysgoes along with being the newest orgamzation at Notre Dame. But if the office wishes to maintain student support, it must begin to make a significant impact on the Notre Dame com­munity.
The office has taken at least one positive step toward per­suading students they don't have to drink to have fun. It agreedto distnbute funds to dorms which sponsor non-alcoholic events. But part of these funds were already allocated for this purpose before the office came into existence. 
The Office of Alcohol and Drug Education needs to developsome creative programs on its own, and these programs should not just encourage people to participate in non-alcoholic events but should also encourage responsible drinking. No one expects everyone to stop drinking. The University already realizes this when it operates a bar on campus.
• One positive step the office could take would be to provide a breathalyzer or alcosensor at the exit of the Alumni-Senior Club so patrons can check their blood-alcohol levels if they plan to drive. Many bars around-the country now provide this service for their customers. 
Some students drive drunk without realizing it. Others feel 
they are driving safely but risk being caught with a blood­
alcohol level that is slightly over the legal limit. Some just lose 
count of how many drinks they've had. A machine at the door 
could help all of these people. 
It could also help the University. As operator of a bar, they 
could find themselves liable for a death caused by someone 
who had left Senior Bar drunk. A quick stop at the machine 
might have encouraged that J?erson not to drive. 
Part of the reason the Umversity runs a bar which is on 
campus is so that students are able walk back from it. Thus, 
an even greater good would be accomplished if the University 
encouraged student bars to install machines at their exits. Or 
the University could subsidize or donate the machines. 
The breathalyzer machine is rather expensive: It may run 
$2,500 to $3,000. But the smaller alcosensor device costs only
about $400 plus a few cents for each throw-away mouthpiece. 
And the smaller machine is still certified to be within plus or 
minus .01 percent of the actual blood alcohol level (.10 is the 
legal blood alcohol limit). 
The office could finance the purchase of these machines 
through its federal grant money or could take the initiative to 
arrange funding through some other part of the University. 
The Office of Alcohol and Drug Education is off to a good start. But it needs to begin implementing concrete programsif it is to effectively follow its mission of promoting healthy attitudes toward alcohol and drugs.

P.O. Box Q 
Coke boycott not a biased move 
Dear Editor: 
It was disappointing to read The Ob­server's rationalizations for not sup­porting the nationwide Coke boycott. 
Why did the Network choose to boycott Coke? The Notre Dame chapter of the Anti-Apartheid Network supports nationwide anti-apartheid efforts. The Coke boycott is a nationwide campaign. The reason for boycotting coke is that it is a high-profile, American company whose precedent-setting move of pseudo-divestment has undermined the sanctions and divestment movement. Coke's style of disengagement -selling plant and equipment to local managers and continuing buiness -reveals a lack of social responsibility on the part of the Coca-Cola company. Whatever public relations ·mileage they might have gone from supposedly empower­ing blacks by their reshuffling of con­trol was cut short by the revelation that Amalgamated Beverages, South Africa's new bottlers and distributors of Coke, have been investing the workers' pension funds in the South African armaments industry. We should also understand that, before the "pullout," Coke's South African employees were only made aware of the rights due them from the compa­ny's expousal of the Sullivan principles after a civil rights group forced Coke to comply. These facts prove ample jus­tification for boycotting Coke until it ceases all business with South Africa. 
Contrary to the opinion of The Obser­ver, boycotts can have effect. In En­gland, Barclay's Bank was forced to withdraw from South Africa after a ten­year boycott had raised its economic, if not social, consciousness. The strat­egy of the boycott movement is to con­centrate efforts on one company at a time for as long as necessary so as to have the greatest impact. To argue against the boycott on the grounds that it has little chance of succeeding or be­cause Coke products are sold everywhere on campus tells more about the level of one's commitment to the struggle for justice in South Africa than about the rationality of the boycott. 
The Coke Boycott is unrelated to the fact that Coca-Cola's president is also the chairman of Notre Dame's Board of Trustees. It is a naitonwide cam­paign which has been organized in At­lanta, Georgia, and the organizers make no reference to the connection betweeen Notre Dame and Coca-Cola in stating the reasons for the boycott. This connection, however, should be of interest to the Notre Dame community. Indeed, it helps explain why our Uni­versity still hasn't divested from South Africa, despite the fact that, according to the investment policy formulated in May 1986, we should have divested in June of that year when South Africa's state of emergency, which is still in ef­fect, was imposed. 
As for the request for " ... more litera­ture, movies and presentations on the evils of the apartheid system" the Anti­Apartheid Network is currently showing an eight-week series of films on apartheid on Thursday evenings at 7:30p.m. in the Center for Social Con­cerns. Later this month we will sponsor an eveing of poetry by a South African woman from Soweto. We continue to meet on the steps of the Administration Building on Fridays at 12:15 p.m. to discuss news from South Africa and to stand in solidarity with the oppressed. We invite all members of the Notre Dame community to join us at these events. 
One question needs to be raised here. Once we are educated about the evils of apartheid, can we sit still? If we take seriously our concern for justice in South Africa, we cannot remain idle. We can take an option for the oppressed South Africans and respond to their call. They've asked us to withdraw our support from the economic foundations of the apartheid system by ceasing all business with South Africa. Mandatory, comprehensive sanctions will have the greatest impact. Boycotting companies who continue doing business with South Africa is an effective way of keeping the pressure on. 
Make the sacrifice. Stop drinking Coke products. We can convince Coke that doing business with apartheid is bad business. The sooner they see this, the sooner we can enjoy the taste of Coke again. 
Then we can concentrate on another company.

Notre Dame fencers 
10 head 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO Sports Writer 
It's time for the Irish fencers to show the nation they have the talent and ability to capture national titles. 
This weekend, 10 members of the fencing team will travel to Cleveland to compete in the Junior Olympic Fencing Cham­pionships. The tourney, in its 20th year, is restricted to fen­cers under 20 years old. 
The Junior Olympics also serves as one of the qualifying tournaments for the Junior World Championships, an event in which 450 athletes and 35 countries take part. Each fencer participates in a series of tournmanents to collect enough points to participate in the Junior Worlds. 
Last year the World Cham­
to Junior 
pionships were held in South America. This year they will be held at Notre Dame. 
On the women's team, soph­omore Anne Barreda, 47-4, and freshman Lynn Kadri, 32-7, get the call. Both are starters on the 17-2 women's team. 
Barreda, who won a previous qualifying tournament, is vir­tually assured of a spot already. She won the United States Fencing Association (USFA) National Champion­ship in June of last year, almost guaranteeing her of an invita­tion to the World Champion­ships. In fact, she is the top seed in the upcoming Junior Olympics. 
"Anne has a good chance to win the Junior Olympics," said women's head coach Yves Auriol. "She is fencing well, while Lynn (Kadri) is getting

some very valuable experience against high-level competi­tion." 
On the men's side, eight fen­cers will attend. In the foil divi­sion, the Irish send sophomores Joel Clark, 25-3, and Colin Gumbs, 19-5, and freshmen Phil Leary, 30-6, and Fred Trayers, 12-2. 
Wielding the sabre will be sophomore Danny Yu, 25-5, and freshmen David Kirby, 20-1, and Chris Bauger, 15-3. 
Matt Mergen, 19-13, will be the sole epeeist attending from Notre Dame. 
Freshman Leszek Nowosielski from Ottawa, On­tario, who holds a perfect 20-0 record, will not join his team­mates in the Junior Olympics because he already has earned enough points to represent Canada in the World Cham­pionships. 
"I don't remember sending so many kids talented enough to compete in a national tourn­ament," said men's head coach Mike DeCicco. 
"This tournament is our chance to compare ourselves to other fencers across the na­tion," Mergen said. 
"I've got to be honest," DeCicco added. "I've never had so many young and nationally-talented fencers. It 
· augurs well for the years ahead."

Irish face Villanova 
Senior Foley paid 
By STEVE M;EGARGEE Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame hockey team has won 12 games in a row, and barring a major up­set, that streak will be 14 by Monday. 
Villanova comes to the Joyce ACC this weekend for games with the 21-2-2 Irish at 7:30 Friday and Saturday nights. The Wildcats enter the weekend with a 7-16-1 record, and 24 of their 33 players are underclassmen. 
"They lost to Mercyhurst (a team Notre Dame beat 7-3), and they're just one of the weakest teams on our schedule," said first-year Irish coach Ric Schafer. "This is one game where all the players who've worked so hard all year will finally get some ice time." 
This~weekend's series also features the last two-game home matchup for the Irish seniors, including defenseman Pat Foley. 
Foley chose Notre Dame over Harvard four years ago, thinking the Irish hockey pro­gram was ready to return to prominence. Instead, he spent three years watching Harvard skate with the top teams in the nation, while Notre Dame was enduring three consecutive losing seasons playing far in­ferior competition. 
"I understood it was going to be brought up to a certain ex­tent while I was here," said the Roseville, Minn., native. "I didn't expect it to turn out how it did. The indications were that they'd try to bring it up and play better competition, and they didn't." 
This year, the Irish still have

eluding 3-of-5 three pointers to finish with a game-high 21 points. 
The Irish play host to the Dayton Lady Flyers in a North Star Conference game this Sat­urday at 2 p.m. at the Joyce ACC. The Lady Flyers bring with them a record of 11-9 and are led by forward Tobette Pleasant and center Michele Kruty, averaging 16.4 and 15.3 points a game, respectively. 
"Dayton is a good team," says Mcgraw. "They just beat Kentucky last week. If we play like we did tonight we will lose. You will see an improved squad on Saturday."

a relatively weak schedule, but under the direction of a new co­ach, Notre Dame is finally win­ning. 
"I guess the biggest differ­ence is going into every game with the idea of winning it in­stead of wondering if we'll find a way to lose," said Foley. "We have a positive attitude. When you're winning, everything's more positive, and when you're positive, it's easier to win. 
"This year's group of seniors is a pretty good group of guys. We were all tired of losing," Foley continued. "We all thought we could basically win all our games. It was just a matter of doing it." 
One of the big changes this year has been the play of the defense. During Notre Dame's 12-game win streak, the Irish have allowed just 33 goals a game. That produces a goals­against average of less than

as well as I ever have. I think with the NCAA's coming in March, I should be hitting my peak by that time." 
Hirschfeld is quick to spread the credit for his success to other people. He realizes he went out late in the season, and he could have been rejected just as easily as welcomed. 
"I'm grateful to coach Welsh and the swim team for giving me a chance to achieve some­thing for myself and be a part of a tremendous group of people," Hirschfeld said. 
Hirschfeld and the rest of the squad will have to be at their best again this weekend as Illinois-Chicago invades Rolf's today and Cleveland State comes to town Saturday. These are the final dual meets of the season for both the men's and women's teams. 
The men have won eight of their last nine meets, while the women are looking to put a se­ries of close losses behind them with a pair of victories. With Veome out, Hirschfeld's role increases with each meet. 
Hirschfeld, though, is glad he has any role at all in the Irish program. He had a brilliant diving career at Chaminade College Prep in St. Louis, finishing second in the state his senior year as his team coasted to the state title. It seemed Hirschfeld was headed for col­legiate stardom, but he had other ideas. 
He turned down diving offers ..from Missouri, Eastern Illinois and Columbia among others because he thought it was time for a change in his life. 
"Once I got accepted at Notre Dame, I never consid­ered any other place," Hirschfeld said. "I was more set towards Notre Dame's edu­cation than I was at continuing diving. I had been diving since l was six years old, and I thought it was a good time for other commitments." 
Perhaps the biggest reason Hirschfeld came to Notre Dame was the fact that Notre Dame is a tradition in his fam­ily. His father graduated from here and he is the fifth of seven children to attend here. 
Hirschfeld went out for the team as a sophomore, but decided he wasn't ready to resume his diving career. After this season, he said he wishes he would have stayed with the team that year. 
"It's not a good thing to look back and wish to do something over again, but I really wish I had been there all four years," Hirschfeld said. "You never know how much something is worth until it's gone."

When the swim team began practice in the fall, Adam Hirschfeld wasn't near a pool, let alone a diving board. 
Now he has the chance to qualify for the NCAA Diving Championships. 
Hirschfeld, a first-semester senior, decided to join the diving team almost two weeks into the season after being con­vinced he was making the right move from members of the team. He was so late in going out that he failed to make the team picture. 
"I decided to go out for a couple of reasons," Hirschfeld said. "I had a lot of encourage­ment from members of the swim team, and I missed com­petition having not done it in college."

Tolstedt 
By MICHAEL GERARD Sports Writer 
Sophomore Stephanie Tolstedt of the Notre Dame wo­men's tennis team has found a winning combination in the Irish program. 
The native of Columbus, Ohio, who combines a solid game with some solid work in the classroom, will take to the courts this weekend in the Eck Classic doubles tournament. 
The 5-10 Tolstedt proved her ability to excel on and off the court as a freshman. Expected to play No. 6 or 7 singles, she started at the No. 2 slot and posted a 9-11 record. She also played doubles with Michelle Dasso, claiming a record of 8-8. 
At the same time, the engin­eering major has managed to build a grade point above the 
3.0 mark and earned another impressive position this past semester--a spot on Dean's List. 
Returning to a tougher schedule and a vital role on the tennis team as a sophomore this year, Tolstedt continues her strong play in both singles and doubles. 
Tolstedt began her competi­tive tennis career as a

old, inspired by her parents love of the game. 
"My parents basically taught themselves and then me and my brother," said Tolstedt. 
Tennis became much more than just a sport, however, to the Tolstedt family. 
"Tennis is a good way to meet people and socialize, as well as exercise," Tolstedt said. "My family has always 
been close to the sport. My par­
ents have definitely been the biggest influence on me." 
But tennis takes a back seat to academics for Tolstedt. That is not much of a surprise, con­sidering the sophomore is at­tending Notre Dame on a full academic scholarship. 
·"Academics have always been a priority for me," said Tolstedt. 

Named Joyce scholar and salutatorian of her class at His-hop Waterson High School in Columbus, Tolstedt anticipated a hectic engineering schedule would accompany her action on the women's tennis team. 
The sophomore standout had justified reservations about handling academics and a de­manding team schedule. But she has more than proven her ability to excel at both, starting the year at No. 2 singles behind 
freshman phenom CeCe Cahill.
She is playing No. 3 singles this spring, and combines with freshman Kim Pacella in doubles. 
Playing a more demanding role on the team this year, however, means even more stress and a greater challenge for Tolstedt's daily schedule. She has had to adjust to in­creased pressure on the court and in the classroom but says

February 
Quick, quick get me a doctor! 
I've got February Fever. That's not the kind you get from being snowed inside your dorm for days on end. No, February Fever is much more deadly, ask Arizona, UNLV, BYU and Duke. 
All those teams began last week ranked numbers one through four in the country. This week they're numbers three, seven, and eight respectively (the Blue Devils and Cougars are tied for the last posi­tion). 
The fever I'm talking about is much more deadly than Asian-Swine-Yellow-Polka-Dotted Flu. It's the fever that hits when college basketball really heats up those frigid nights, and its symptoms are horrid. 
You walk around saying, "I'm tellin' ya, he's a PTP; it's a realM and M'er, NC, Baby; and Upset, Baby." Your nerf ball never leaves your hand and you've ripped your rim down so many times you think you're Jerome Lane. 
You're trying to figure out as many ways of count­ing to 64 that include your team and leave out Bob Knight. You don't sleep until you find out the final scores from the West Coast. 
And you watch hours of roundball. Hours. Heck, 
it doesn't matter who's playing. It could be North 
Fever: There's 
Carolina, North Carolina State, North Carolina A & T or North Carolina School for Truckers (I'm tellin' ya, they really drive the lane). For that mat­ter, it could be North, South, East, Coastal or Ger­man Carolina. 
It doesn't matter, you'll watch anything. Your favorite professors are named Schmuhl, _McGuire and Packer. The only thing that keeps you

from flunking out of school is that the dorms aren't wired for cable TV. Then again, you're always off­campus at a friend's apartment. Both your girlfriends are threatening to walk out (Women, it seems, are generally immune to the disease). 
You're beset by nightmares like the top three teams in the country playing on separate networks, not to mention your own team has a home game 
no cure 
that afternoon. That's enough to make you wake up screaming. 
As with most diseases of this caliber, there is no cure. Worse, February Fever is only a weak preview of what's ahead--March Madness, confer­ence and NCAA Tournaments. You actually care about the NIT and NAIA Tourneys. But the worst thing is that when all that is over, you have to quit cold turkey. 
AAAAAHHHHHHH, SHOOT ME! ! ! ! Why does February have to be so short? 
Game of the Week--What else? One of the best rivalries in college basketball renews itself this Sun­day afternoon at 1 when the UCLA Bruins visit the Joyce Center for a game with the Irish. There have been some classics in this series, and every game is usually exciting. The game's a sellout, Al's com­ing to town and the red light will be on. 
If you can't get a ticket, the women's basketball team plays host to Dayton Saturday afternoon at 
2. Muffet McGraw's team is very much in the hunt for an NCAA bid. This weekend, the Joyce Center definitely will be the place to let February Fever run its course.
