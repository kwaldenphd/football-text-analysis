Funding removed from Office of President 
By MAUREEN REYNOLDS 
Associa[c News Editor 
The Student Senate passed a rcalloeation of $11,400 from the Office of the Student Body President back to the Financial Management Board by a vote of 17 to (, with two abstnntions at its wenkly meeting Wndnesday. 
Tho FMB held two separate srwnding reviews in December and January to "assess how clubs and organizations spent the monny allocated to them last March," and to "give FMB an idea of what to allocate in iL'i upcoming budget meeting," according to a letter to the Senate from the FMB. 
In its assessment. the FMB decided that a total of $11,400 was not needed by the O!Tice of the Prnsidont and could be better used by other dubs. The reallocat­ed money will be given to the Studnnt Union board, the Hall President's Council, the Class of 2004 and the Class of 2006. In its letter, the FMB stated that each organization "have events planned for the rest of the semester that need funding." 
"The FMB felt that these events would benefit more students than some of those planned by the Ollice of the President, and that was their reason for reallocating the money," the letter continued. 
Members of the Office of the President contested the realloca­tion during the meeting. 
Although he was not present, student body president Jeremy Lao sent a letter to the Senate ask­ing senators to leave $10,000 of the money FMB wanted to take. lie cited three major events planned by the Office of the President the Alcohol Awareness Campaign, Student Appreciation Week and the End of the Year Mass -as the reasons why the oflice needed the money. 
"All of the events are named and the expenses already planned," Lao said in his letter. "I give my oflice the full faith and confidence that these events will not only be executed, but will also be planned to the best of our capabilities." 
"I have confidence in our staff · as well as in our office leadership to get the job' done," Lao said. 
Student Union treasurer Don Norton attended the meeting to speak on behalf of the FMB's deci­sion. He cited the lack of prepara­tion by the Office of the President as one reason the FMB decided to reallocate the money. 
"We have given the Office of the President a good three chances [to show us a budget] ... I told them this is the decision we've come to," Norton said. "As a board, we thought it was the best decision ... other groups seemed better pre­pared to spend the money."

University ranks higher than BC, GU in mass offerings 
(self-identified as 70 percent and 50 percent. respectively) might be a factor. It is instead a testament to the strong faith community that is distinctly Notre Dame, uniquely woven from the chapels in each individual dorm and the symbolic Basilica that stands at its heart, to the Masses held everyday in Malloy Hall and the Mendoza College of Business. 
"Though Mass has always held a strong position within the Notre Dame community, I think in recent years it has grown stronger. I think there are more undergraduate students who want to make deep faith and spir­ituality a part of their four-year experience here," said Father Richard Warner, director of cam­pus ministry.

Boston College has 36. Georgetown has 42. Notre Dame has 175. And this is one set of numbers has nothing to do with sports.

SMC student gov't announces class election results 
By KELLY MEEHAN 
News Wri[cr 
The results of the Saint Mary's election for class officers were announced Wednesday after ali­day voting Tuesday on PRISM. 
Students had the opportunity to vote only for the candidates representing their respective classes, and student government officials said the voter turnout was on par with what was expected, with 53 percent of the class of 2007 voting, 30 percent of the class of 2006 and 50 per­cent of the class of 2005. This is the second year that Saint Mary's has used online voting, which has caused increased voter turnout compared to past years. 
"I think in the next couple years you should see Saint 
Mary's student government become efficient at alerting the campus that an election is going on and having a higher voter turn out," student body president Elizabeth Jablonski-Diehl said. 
Claudia Toth was named presi­dent of the Class of 2007, win­ning 63 percent of the votes. Kathleen Kindt will serve as vice president, Kristen Bogdanowicz as secretary and Deanna Shorsten as treasurer. 
"Our immediate goal, as we take over, is to first establish our class board for the following school year," Toth said. "From there, we want begin thinking of activities and events that we can plan for our class for next year." 
The runner-up in the Class of 2007 election, receiving 33 per­cent of the votes, was the Mcllduff!Littell ticket. Four per­cent of the class abstained. 
Despite running unopposed, the Class of 2006 Lerner!Palasky ticket had to receive a majority of the votes in order to be named class officers, and the candidates did so, winning 67 percent of the vote. Danielle Lerner was named president of the Class of 2006, Liz Palasky will be the vice

INSIDE COLUMN 

Where's the meat? 
I'm sure all the freshmen around campus were thrilled to enter the dining halls yesterday and discover that meat items were all of a sud­den non-existent. Welcome to Notre Dame dining 
halls during Lent, the place where for every Friday, plus Ash Wednesday, the meat disappears and several dif­ferent kinds of shrimp suddenly 

appear like the Mike Harkins fish of Capistrano. 
Better get used Graphics to it -popcorn shrimp one day, Cajun shrimp the next, then buffalo shrimp -by the end of Lent you'll never want to eat shrimp again. 

I'm sure someone always has some complaint about the dining hall not having meat at this time of year, and it may be a tired subject if you're not a freshman, but it's all ·I could think about while meeting with a study group in LaFortune, right next to Subway, with a menu full of sandwiches staring back at me. 
Now I know this is a Catholic institution, yet I'm a little confused as to why the dining hall does not provide at least some kind of meat. Not only are there a lot of people here who don't make the decision to give up meat on Fridays; the whole idea of not eating meat dur­ing Lent is that we are making a choice to give something up to prove to God that we are can resist such pleasures. The purpose is to try to show that we are disciplined enough to deny ourselves of a material desire that isn't sinful­eating meat -so that we can become trained to resist things in· our lives that actually are sinful. 
Yet the dining halls are making these decisions for everybody on campus, whether they're Catholic or not. Maybe it's just me, but it seems that if the dining hall isn't going to offer us meat anyway, no one is really making the personal choice to abstain from it. What's the sacrifice if it isn't available anyway? When I was sitting at a booth next to Subway this Ash Wednesday, I truly felt like I was giving something up. At the same time, I realized how many students here don't follow the tradition and were ordering up their meatball subs anyhow. 
And since when was Notre Dame such a hard-core Catholic institu­tion? In the past month the campus has hosted the Vagina Monologues and the Queer Film Festival. Is it really that crazy to allow meat in the dining hall on Friday during Lent?

School's sex column offers 'How To' guide 
PHOENIX -Top adminis­trators at Northern Arizona University will meet with the school's publication board next week to discuss a con­troversial sex column that appeared in the student newspaper. 
Student writer Oaire Fuller authored a Feb. 12 column for The Lumberjack that offered a graphic "how to" guide on performing a sex act. 
"I was appalled by the con­tent of that article," said NAU Provost Uz Grobsmith, who said she would attend the March 5 meeting of the pub­lication board. "It wasn't con­sidered that a lot of people who read the paper are youngand minors, and this is very inappropriate content." 
She said the university president's office received many calls from people "deeply offended" by the arti­cle. 
Rob Breeding, faculty adviser for The Lumbmjack, said he was aware of the col­umn before it was published. 
Dog Is found alive month after boat sinks 
ANCHORAGE, Alaska -A Labrador retriever has been found alive on an isolated cove of a Southeast Alaska island more than a month after its owner was given up for dead when his boat sank in rough seas. 
1\vo local fishermen found the dog named Brick on Heceta Island several miles from the accident. The men had known the dog's owner, Greg Clark, who went down with his boat in late January. 
Brick swam to the men's boat and was hauled aboard -underweight, with an injured leg, fur matted with tree sap, but wiggling with joy, according to friends of the fishermen.

SMC gears up for visits frotn area high school students 
By NICOLE ZOOK 
News Writer 
The Saint Mary's campus will host a different kind of freshmen and sophomores today and Friday, as 22 ninth and tenth grade students from area high schools participate in the "My First Day in College" program. 
Sponsored by the Office of Multicultural Affairs, the pro­gram is designed to give these young women -from high schools including Clay, Riley and Washington -a glimpse of college life, said Marie Willis. assistant director of multicultural affairs. 
"We want to create a rela­tionship with them and pro­vide them [with] opportuni­ties," Willis said. "They need 

Mass 
continued from page 1 
Warner estimated that 7 5 to 80 
percent of the Catholic student 
population attend Mass on a regu­
lar to occasional basis -com­
pared to an estimated 40 percent 
at Boston College, according to 
associate campus minister of litur­
gy Ellen Modica. 
The strong desire to participate 
in religious services evident in the 
undergraduates carries on beyond 
a student's time on campus, 
Warner said. Citing a UClA study 
of students from 25 Catholic edu­
cational insititutions 10 years after 
graduation, he said that 77 per­
cent of Notre Dame graduates 
from the class of 1992 continue to 
go to Mass on a regular basis one 
decade later. The average of the . 
other 24 institutions was 22 per­
cent. 
According to the annual 
American Council on Education 
survey of first-year students, 41 
percent of Notre Dame freshmen 
said that religion was an impor­
tant factor in their choice of 
school. 
"I had to decide between 
University of Ari~ona and here, 
and one of main reasons I chose 
Notre Dame is that I really wanted 
to be in a community where we 
did have Masses every day. I love it 
here, being able to walk down­
stairs and go to Mass," said Katie 
McGuckin, a freshman who lives in 
Lewis. 
The estimated participation per­
centage can be called into ques­
tion, however, as many freshmen 
also attested to going to Mass less 
than they did when they were at 
home, ifthey attend mass at all. 
"I go to Mass about once every 

two weeks . . . which is less than I -go when I'm at home, because my parents aren't there telling me to go, and after Saturday night, sometimes I sleep in a little late," said Fisher freshman Mike 
Barrett. 
Stanford freshman Eamon 

Murphy attributed his lower atten­
dance at Mass to the personal 
freedom college provides. 
"I just don't feel compelled to go 

to Mass anymore," Murphy said. 
"It seems like now it's my choice, 
and I don't feel like I need to go all 

that often." 
Moving off-campus brings the issue of participation into sharper focus, as students are placed in a position where religious services are far less convenient and acces­sible than they are in residence halls. 
"When I lived on campus I went to know that they can be part of a college community." 

The Office of Multicultural Affairs matched the students with Saint Mary's volunteers by judging each party's aca­demic interests. The high school students will stay with the Saint Mary's women overnight and attend their classes as guests on Friday morning. 
"One of the things I think is really good about this pro­gram is that we have them go through classes. A lot of pre­college programs don't offer that opportunity," Willis said. 
She also believes that the personal relationship between the students will benefit not just the younger woman, but also their collegiate mentors. 
"If a [high school] student's not sure college is an option for her, the relationship with stay in a dorm room, but Friday's activities will the Saint Mary's student can many other opportunities include classes, a campus be really beneficial to her," available only in a college set­tour, admissions office visits Willis said.

Militants gun down Iraqi official 
BAGHDAD, Iraq -Gunmen assassinated the deputy police chief in the northern city of Mosul on Wednesday, and militants warned of further attacks on Iraqi security forces and Kurdish militiamen, accusing them of protecting "infidel" Americans. 
In Baghdad, attackers fired a rocket-pro­polled grenade at a major Shiite Muslim shrine overnight, officials at the shrine said. The HPG punched a hole in an outer wall of the Kazimiyah shrine in a northern neigh­borhood of the capital, but caused no injuries. 
The attack on the shrine came on the fourth day of the Islamic month of Muharram, a sacred period when thousands of Iraqi Shiites and Iranian pilgrims have converged on Kazimiyah, where two Shiite saints are buried, and other Shiite shrines in cities of southern Iraq. 
N. Korean nuke talks continue 
BEIJING -South Korea on Wednesday offered the North compensation for giving up its nuclear program and the United States said it had "no intention" of invading the reclusive nation as six-country talks on Pyongyang's atomic ambitions convened. 
The North's chief delegate. Kim Kye Gwan, said he would be "maintaining our princi­ples" hours after his country issued a last­minute demand for compensation for shut­ting down the program. 
Washington's delegate said nothing but a wholesale elimination of the nuclear activi­ties would do.

CLEVELAND -Fresh from three more easy victories in the Democratic presidential race. John Kerry looked to a fight with President Bush over jobs lost to foreign countries. 
Kerry defeated Sen. John Edwards by large margins in Utah and Idaho. and also won in Hawaii, where Edwards ran third. That gave Kerry 18 wins in 20 contests. 
The two leading candidates bypassed the three states to focus on the huge delegate prizes at stake when 10 states vote next week on Super Tuesday. 

Existing home sales slip in Jan. 
WASHINGTON -Sales of previously owned homes fell in January as much of the country was hit by unusually bad winter weather. 
Existing home sales dropped by 5.2 per­cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.04 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. That compares with a revised 
6.37 million in December, a lower level than initially reported. 
Last month's sales activity was 2 percent above the 5.92 million pace in January 2003. The record was set in September 2003, with a 6.68 million rate.

Study finds HIV-resistant protein 
As&ociated Pceu 
Scientists say they have discovered why some monkeys are resistant to infection with the AIDS virus -an exhilarating find that points to a new and highly promising strategy for blocking HIV in people. 

The discovery capped a more than 10-year search for the answer to the mystery of what stops the virus cold in certain primates. 
Carl Dieffenbach, director of basic science research for AIDS at the National Institutes of Health, said the finding could lead to drugs to treat AIDS infection or a vaccine to prevent it. 
"This will go immediately in about 15 different directions," Dieffenbach said. "This has been an amazing year in basic research and now we've got this. We're very rich with results and we've got a lot to work on." 
The discovery was reported by Dr. 

Joseph Sodroski and his team of Harvard University researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. It was published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. 
Normally, a virus spreads through the body by entering cells, hijacking their machinery, and using it to make new copies of itself. 
But monkeys have a protein called TRIM5-alpha that is somehow able to stop the virus from shedding its pro­tective coat after it enters a healthy cell. The shedding of the coating is poorly understood but considered essential to the infection cycle. 
Humans have their own version of TRIM5-alpha. but it is not as effective as the monkey version in countering HIV. However, researchers may be able to design a drug that makes it work better, Sodroski said. 
"This is really important because it will help build a basis for hammering the virus before it gets started," said Paul Luciw, a University of California at Davis microbiologist who special­izes in AIDS research. 
Stephen Goff, a Columbia University biochemist and HIV expert, said: "A lot of labs are going to be working on this as soon as this paper comes out." 
Sodrowski said the same mecha­nism may even work against other viruses. 
"What we're really uncovering is the first example of a natural system of defense that may be operating against other viruses besides HJV," he said. "We're looking at 'Example 1' here, and I highly doubt it will be the only example in nature." 
"It's got great potential," said Scott Wong, an Oregon Health & Science University molecular biologist who leads AIDS research on monkeys at the federal regional primate center in Oregon.

Vlerah, Blake keep off-campus students informed 
By ANGELA SAOUD 
News Writer 
While off-campus students usually cite reasons such as freedom and fun as motives for their departure from school property, some said they lose the connection with the school they have come to love when they leave campus. 
Saint Mary's senior Abby Van Vlerah and Notre Dame senior Sarah Blake try to aid students who face this problem. As the off-campus representative and the off­campus president respec­tively, Van Vlerah and Blake said that they try to inform the off-campus community of happenings at Saint Mary's and Notre Dame. 
"My duty is to coordinate events to help unite the off­campus population," Blake said. "My primary responsi­
bility is to make  sure  that  
off-campus  students  are  
fairly represented."  

:: 
·.: ,: ,: : . ·. . =: 

Van Vlerah described her own role somewhat differ­ently. 
"My job is to keep stu­dents who live off campus connected with the Saint Mary's community," Van Vlerah said. "I send out an e-mail newsletter weekly that highlights the events that are going on through­out campus." 
Both Van Vlerah and Blake said that part of their jobs is to plan events specif­ically for off-campus stu­dents. 
"We have off-campus stu­dent lunches in the off-cam­pus lounge," Van Vlerah said. "Last semester I organized a raffle. but unfortunately my budget isn't big enough to do every­thing I'd like to do." 
Blake has planned events such as Masses. dinners, a party at Legends and an upcoming meal at BW 3's. "I have an off-campus list­serv that I use to communi­cate all off-campus events 
to the students," Blake said. "I also use the listserv to pass on information that comes to me through other sources. When I plan events, I pass out flyers to help publicize." 
Van Vlerah said that, despite the information, stu­dents are not as informed as she would like them to be. 
"We try to publicize in places that all students go, like Madaleva and Haggar, but it's hard to get the information up in a central location where everyone can see it," she said. "Regardless of whether or not you live off campus or on campus, you're still bom­barded with information. There are a lot of events ava~.lable if you seek them out. 
Blake said off-campus stu­dents are relatively informed about events that happen throughout campus. "Everyone gets class e-mails and reads The Observer to get information," Blake 

said. "Also, word of mouth 
definitely spreads  news  of  
activities."  
Notre  Dame  junior  

Elizabeth Roach lives off campus this semester, but despite that fact, she still feels involved in the infor­mation loop. 
"I feel informed of on­campus events and things through the listserv," Roach said. "Plus, I'm on campus for classes everyday, so I see the flyers and things." 
Saint Mary's sophomore Rachael Berg also believes the information she receives is efficient. 
"I have a lot of friends that still live on campus, so they keep me pretty up to date with everything that's happening," Berg said. "For the most part, I get to the events I want to from the information I receive, but it's also my job to seek out that information, as well."

IN BRIEF 
Stewart defense lasts one hour 
NEW YOHK -Lawyers for Martha Stewart presented a defense of less than an hour Wednesday, calling a single witness to raise questions about what the homemaking icon was asked in her first interview with investiga­tors. 
Steven Pearl. a lawyer, testified about notes he took during the interview on Feb. 4, 2002 ­a session in which the government claims Stewart told a series of lies about the day she sold ImClone Systems stock. 
One accusation is that Stewart falsely claimed she did not know whether there was a record that stockbroker Peter Bacanovic had left her a message on Dec. 27, 2001, the day she sold. 
CaiPERS drops support of Eisner 
LOS ANGELES -Embattled Walt Disney Co. CEO Michael Eisner lost the support Wednesday of the nation's largest public pen­sion fund, a big Disney investor that called the company's performance "dismal." 
The California Public Employees' Retirement System said it would withhold its votes for Eisner's re-election to the wmpany's board. 
CalPEHS is the 29th single largest sharehold­er of Disney. with 9.9 million shares. 
Its statement came hours after Glass Lewis & Co., a San Francisco-based research firm that advises institutional shareholders, recommend­ed that holders of Disney stock withhold their votes for Eisner. 
Feds search ITT headquarters 
INDIANAPOLIS -Federal agents on Wednesday searched the headquarters of ITT Technical Institutes and some campuses of its chain of technical schools in eight states. Shares of its parent company, ITT Educational Services Inc.. plunged 33 percent.

Air traffic controller stabbed to death 
Associated Press 
ZURICH -An air traffic controller who ordered a pas­senger plane into the path of another aircraft over Germany -a crash that killed dozens of Russian chil­dren -was stabbed to death Wednesday in front of his wife. 
The attacker was a heavily built man aged 50-55. possi­bly Eastern European, with graying hair and a three-day stubble. He showed up at the controller's home Tuesday night, spoke briefly to the controller in broken German, killed him, and fled on foot. 
Beyond that description, police said they have no leads on the killer but are investi­gating a possible link between the stabbing and the crash 19 months ago that killed 71 peo­ple. The accident was blamed on the controller, a 36-year­old Danish citizen who has never been named by authori­ties. 
"There wasn't much said," District Attorney Pascal Gossner told The Associated Press. He declined to say what words were exchanged between the killer and victim, because it is part of the inves­tigation. 
He also said there were other people there at the time of the murder, but would not say if they included the cou­ple's three children. The con­troller died at the scene, 

Debate 
continued from page 1 
while panelists discussed the validation of legal endorse­ment for marriage in America. Moderated by Notre Dame Law Professor Gerard Bradley, the panel included Alan Sears, Andrew Koppelman and Paul Griffiths. Each member gave 20-minute dialogues outlining their opin­ions on the issue. 
Sears, who is President, CEO and General Counsel of the Alliance Defense Fund, began his discussion by noting that it was Ash Wednesday, a day of penitence and an apt time for a debate to take place. 
"This is a critical issue in our culture," he said. 
Sears made various refer­ences to the Catholic teach­ings to substantiate his sup­port for maintaining the cur­rent state of marriage. 
"[God] made the male and female, and the two shall be become one," he said. "Law regulates marriage. It does not create it ... God himself is the author of marriage," Sears said. 
Sears defended his opposi­tion of same-sex marriages by arguing that their legalization would result in the decon­struction of marriage. 
"It's like trying to draw a square circle," Sears said. 
He explained that homosex­ual conduct is harmful to soci­ety and that same-sex mar­riages will cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dol­lars. 
"Same sex marriage is con­trary to the definition of structure in the constitution ... [to create] a society with police said. 
"We are looking at all sorts of aspects," said Gossner of possible motives -including that the murder was connect­ed to the July 1, 2002, crash over southern Germany, an area run by Swiss air traffic. 
At the time, the controller was on duty alone in the Zurich control room, because a colleague was taking a break. He gave only 44 sec­onds' warning to the Bashkirian Airlines plane and a DHL cargo plane that they were getting too close. 
The controller told the Russian plane to descend, countering the jetliner's onboard collision-avoidance system which was demanding it climb, according to prelimi­nary accident reports. 
The pilot followed the instructions of the controller -sending the jetliner straight into the DHL cargo plane, which also was descending in accordance with its collision­avoidance equipment. 
Those killed in the crash included 45 prize-winning Russian schoolchildren. bound for a vacation in Spain. 
German authorities have yet to release their full report on the accident but said they would not be hampered by the controller's death as he had already been interviewed extensively. The Dane was placed on medical leave after the crash. He was later allowed to return to work but 
stable, nurturing context for children," he said. 
Andy Koppelman, a profes­sor of Law and Political Science at Northwestern Law School who supports same-sex marriages, argued that there are really two issues in this debate: areligious one and a secular one. 
Koppelman made the analo­gy that allowing a same-sex marriage is like making a business proposal: How can we maximize efficiency and satisfy people's preferences while protecting the third party of children, he asked. 
"It is good for children to grow up in stable, loving households ... There is no evi­dence that children raised by same-sex couples are worse off than heterosexual cou­ples," Koppelman said. "Religious and secular can be kept apart. Americans tend to run them together ... When the word 'marriage' is used, passions run very high." 
A recent poll showed that 64 percent of Protestants and 50 percent of Catholics disap­prove of state recognition of same-sex marriages, Koppelman said. He explained that this is because Protestants generally view their sacrament through the civil union while Catholics are more concerned with the sacrament of marriage. 
Koppelman argued that gays and lesbians. like heterosexu­als, want to find satisfaction of marriage. 
"Gays don't want second class status," he said. "This is a stigma of exclusion that the constitution prohibits." 
Koppelman explains the importance of a generational gap concerning this issue. While most Americans oppose 
given other duties. 
In an interview with a German magazine two weeks after the accident, he expressed his sorrow for the crash. "As an air traffic con­troller, it is my task and duty to prevent such accidents," he told Focus. 
Skyguide, the Swiss compa­ny the controller worked for, said it was appalled by his murder and that its employ­ees "were in shock." 
The company received no threats after the collision, Skyguide chief Alain Rossier told a news conference, and investigators were trying to establish whether the con­troller received any threats personally. 
At the time. Swiss President Kaspar Villiger canceled plans to attend a funeral for the children killed in the crash, because officials in the Russian city of Ufa said they could not guarantee his safe­ty. 
In response to the stabbing, Skyguide reduced by 40 per­cent the number of planes it allowed into the airspace it controls to give other con­trollers time to come to terms with the killing. Of 28 employ­ees scheduled Wednesday, seven were too upset to work, a spokesman said. 
The employees and the con­troller's family are receiving counseling,. and Zurich state police have helped organize protection, the company said. 
same-sex marriages, many 18-to 29-year-olds are in favor of it. 
"Conservatives are fighting a losing battle," Koppelman said. 
Paul Griffiths, the chair in Catholic Studies at the University of Illinois Chicago, argued that America was a "pagan" society that must exercise prudence when it comes to homosexual mar­riages. 
Griffiths presented his thesis that the Church should begin to disentangle its practice of sacramental marriage from civil law governing sexual relationships. 
An intimate relation between civil law and sacra­mental marriage is not possi­ble, he said. Griffiths defined the sacrament of marriage in terms of Catholic doctrine, describing· the purpose of marriage as being the unity of man and wife. having children and creating a mini-relation­ship between Christ and the Church on earth. 
"Marriage is between man and woman," he said. "It is incoherent to suggest other­wise ... Marriage is not a con­tract. Nothing that is a sacra­ment is a contract," Griffiths said. 
He further argued that the idea of fidelity and commit­ment in marriage is no longer the norm in the United States. 
"The norm is through and through pagan," he said. 
Wednesday night's discus­sion was hosted by the Notre Dame Journal of Law, Ethics and Public Policy and the Thomas White Center on Law and Government.

Third generation cell phones offer video 
Associated Press 
CANNES-Now that a new wave of "3G" cell phones equipped for streaming video and multimedia content is finally arriving in Europe, the industry is focusing on the next big unknown: what serv­ices users will pay for, and how. 
The mobile phone services on display this week at the 3GSM World Congress indus­try show in this French Riviera town has ranged from video games to tennis to the hit reality TV show, "Big Brother." 
Alcatel SA, the French pro­ducer of telecommunications equipment, announced a deal with cable channel Eurosport to develop sports TV for mobiles and offer it to wireless operators later this year. Eurosport already broadcasts in 18 languages, and business development director Arjan Hoekstra said it was well placed to pipe sports coverage to mobile phones around the world. 
"It's a question of whether the consumer's ready to pay for it," said Hoekstra. "Nobody really knows -but we cer­tainly hope so." 
Although some multimedia services based on third-gener­ation wireless technologies, also known as 3G, have been introduced in Japan and South Korea, many innovations in the pipeline will be tested on real consumers for the first time in Europe -offering a flavor of what's over the hori­zon for U.S. consumers. 
Eurosport is closely follow­ing the example of a 3G oper­ator called 3, which recently began selling downloads of Premiership football highlights to British fans. The same operator has also been streaming live 24-hour cover­age of "Big Brother" to its Swedish subscribers since last month, selling 60,000 sessions in the first two weeks. 
"I don't think you're going to watch an entire tennis match on your mobile phone, but you will watch the highlights and maybe the interviews with the players afterward," Hoekstra said. 
Alcatel also announced a deal Tuesday with software developer VHTVStudios in multimedia messaging servic­es, or "MMS" -the multipur­pose sequel to short messag­ing services, or SMS, which has proven hugely popular in Europe. 
Instead of thumbing out a text message as with SMS, users can send messages with various forms of content such as pictures, video, animation, music and voice-overs. 
"Every user can become a publisher of content via a sim­ple MMS," said Patrick Parodi, head of the Alcatel subsidiary running the program. 
Others are putting their money on mobile games as the next big earner to supplement operators' subscription rev­enues. 
Paris-based Sofinnova Partners, which manages 500,000 euros ($635,000) in high-tech investments for pen­sion funds and insurers, has placed 33 million euros over two years in Esmertec, which makes components used by phone makers to make their handsets compatible with games and other applications written in Java code. 
Sofinnova associate Olivier Chapel said that as Java pro­gresses from high-end to mid­priced phones, it will tap mas­sive "latent demand" for games in the 12-25 age group -an underestimated market until SMS and ringtones took off. 
"Nobody believed in that business, but it has developed very fast because the demand was there," Chapel said. 
Analysts say the content market will get a further boost when wireless payment tech­nologies enable mobile users to buy their games, videos, or music from vendors without the wireless operator as inter­mediary.

States can deny money to divinity students 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -St1tes don't have to underwrite the religious training of students planning careers in the min­istry, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday, a depar­ture from the court's trend of allowing more government support for religion. 
States can deny taxpayer­funded scholarships to divin­ity students, even as they hand out money to students pursuing other fields, the court said. 
"Training someone to lead a congregation is an essen­tially religious endeavor," the court said. "Indeed, majoring in devotional theology is akin to a religious calling as well as an academic pursuit." 
The 7-2 ruling was notable for its author: Chief Justice William II. Hehnquist, ordi­narily a supporter of the idea that there is not a high wall between church and state. 
The court majority parted company with the Bush administration, which had argued that the state of Washington engaged in reli­gious discrimination when it yanked a scholarship from a young divinity student five years ago. 
Joshua Davey won the small merit scholarship but then lost it when he told offi­cials at Northwest College in Kirkland, Wash .. he planned to use the money to pursue a theology degree. lie could have kept the Promise Scholarship had he planned to major in anything else. 
"That a state would deal differently with religious education for the ministry than with education for other callings," is not evidence of hostility toward religion. 
Hehnquist wrote for himself 
and all but the court's two 
most conservative members. 
lstead, it is in keeping with the nation's long tradition of welcoming the free expres­sion of religion while frown­ing on government endorse­ment of it, Rehnquist wrote. 
Like 36 other states, Washington prohibits spend­ing public funds on this kind of religious education. Bans on public funds for religious education, often known as Blaine amendments, date to the 19th century, when anti­Catholic sentiment ran high. 
The Washington ban "does not deny to ministers the right to participate in the· political affairs of the com­munity," the court majority said. "And it does not require students to choose between their religious beliefs and receiving a government ben­efit. The state has merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction." 
The Davey case is a follow­up to the court's major ruling two years ago that allowed parents to use public tax money to send their children to religious schools. A ruling in Davey's favor would have made it easier to use vouch­ers in many states, because it could have overturned pro­visions in state constitutions like the one at issue in Washington. 
The Constitution's First Amendment says, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exer­cise thereof." 
The Davey case posed an unusual test of those two, potentially competing, guar­antees. 
Rehnquist made short work of that thorny issue. 
"The state's interest in not 
funding the pursuit of devo­
tional degrees is substantial 
and the exclusion of such 
funding places a relatively 
minor burden on Promise 
Scholars," Rehnquist wrote. 
"If any room exists between 
the two religion clauses, it 
must be here." 
Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David 
H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer agreed with Rehnquist. 
Justices Antonin Scalia and 
Clarence Thomas dissented. 
"Let there be no doubt: This case is about discrimi­nation against a religious minority," Scalia wrote for the two. 
Davey continued his educa­tion without the subsidy. He did not choose to enter the ministry after graduation, and is now in law school. 
"The indignity of being sin­gled out for special burdens on the basis of one's calling is so profound that the con­crete harm produced can never be dismissed as insub­stantial," wrote Scalia, the father of a Catholic priest. 
Had the court ruled the other way, it could have erased many legal or consti­tutional barriers to state funding of religious activities in areas far beyond educa­tion. 
President Bush's faith­based initiative, which is stalled in Congress, would let more religious groups com­pete for government money for things like social servic­es, so long as their services are available to anybody in need. Opponents suggest the government would wind up underwriting religious prose­lytizing. 


State Dept. reports on human rights problems 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -China has 
been "backsliding on key 
human rights issues," the State 
Department said Wednesday in 
a report that also accused 
Russia of manipulating elec­
tions and making threats 
against opposition parties. 
"We saw many developments covering the whole range from the dramatically uplifting to the disappointing," the State Department said in its annual report on the state of human rights worldwide. The report covers developments in 2003. 
Among the most positive developments last year were the rescue of Iraq from "years of grave human rights viola­tions by Saddam Hussein's regime" and the adoption of a new constitution in Afghanistan through a demo­cratic process, the study said. 
On China, the report said 2003 began with hopes that ·"incremental but unprecedent­ed progress" the previous year would continue. 
Instead, the study said, the situation deteriorated. It cited arrests of democracy activists and individuals who discussed subjects on the Internet deemed sensitive by the gov­ernment. 
Chinese authorities in Tibet carried out executions without due process and engaged in torture and arbitrary arrest, the report said. 
The Bush administration tra­ditionally seeks a resolution critical of China at the annual meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva. Last year was an exception because of progress on the rights front in China. 
But Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner, the State Department's top human rights oflicial, said Wednesday that such a resolution may be introduced at this year's meet­ing, starting next month. 
"We're heading in that direc­
tion," Craner told reporters. 
The report said the Hussian 
government manipulated the 
October presidential elections 
in Chechnya and parliamen­
tary elections held in 
December. 
"Both failed to meet interna­
tional standards," the report 
said. It added that the last 
major non-state television net­
work disappeared from Hussia 
last year because of govern­
ment pressure. 
The report also alleged that the government carried out criminal prosecutions and threats of prosecutions against major financial supporters of opposition parties. 
On other countries, the report said: 
There were "serious human rights abuses" committed by Israeli security forces against Palestinian detainees. These units used excessive force, including the shelling, bomb­ing and raiding of Palestinian civilian areas. But Palestinian security services and the Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization partic­ipated with civilian and terror­ist groups in violent attacks against Israelis, both military and civilian. There was no ref­erence in the report to the controversial security barriur Israel is constructing on Palestinian territory. 
North Korea "is one of the world's most militarized states." Abuses included . "instances of extrajudicial killings, torture and mistreat­ment of prisoners, forced con­fessions, arbitrary arrost and detention, lengthy incommuni­cado detention, and denial of due process." 
The Iranian government's poor hum,an rights record worsened, and it continued to commit serious abuses, includ­ing "summary executions. dis­appearances, torture and other degrading treatment."

Pentagon says military sexual assualt declining 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Sexual assaults in the military have been cut in half in recent years, the Pentagon said Wednesday, responding to criticism from lawmakers who say the Defense Department is not doing enough to address the issue. 
"No war comes without costs, but the costs should be borne out of conflict with the enemy, not by egregious violations by some of our own troops," said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. 
David Chu, undersecretary of defense for personnel, said new figures show the rate of sexual assaults against women in the military fell from 6 percent to 3 percent between 1995 and 2002. 
"It's still too high, there's still a long way to go, but it's down substantially from where we were," Chu told a Senate Armed Services subcommittee. 
He said the most progress needs to be made in providing care to victims. 
Pentagon officials said there have been 106 reports of sexual assault of troops deployed in the Middle East -including Iraq and Afghanistan -over the past 14 months. 
In the Army, there have been 86 reported cases. Investigations have concluded in about half and 14 court-mar­tials have been filed. Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. George Casey Jr. said investigations are harder to conduct when done in the midst of a military opera­tion. 
One of those cases involved Barbara Wharton's daughter. She was stationed with the Stryker Brigade outside Iraq last November when she was knocked unconscious by an unknown attacker. after getting off guard duty in the early morning hours. 
Wharton's daughter awoke stripped, bound and gagged. Doctors determined she was raped, but Wharton told the committee in a statement that minimal effort was taken to find her daughter's attacker. Her daughter was moved out of her unit, her requests to meet with a psychologist rejected and she eventually attempted suicide. 
Wharton said her daughter was returned to the U.S., but felt "abandoned" by her com­manders. 
"Just because I came back with all four limbs intact, they're treating me like I'm fak­ing," the daughter said~ accord­ing to Wharton. "I feel like my chain of command betrayed me. I gave four years to that unit and I feel like it kicked me in the teeth when I was down." 
Christine Hansen, executive director of the Connecticut­based Miles Foundation, a sup­port group for military victims of domestic and sexual vio­lence, said 68 women, most of them officers, contacted her organization with stories of sexual assaults at the hands of fellow members of the military. At least 13 had also reported the assaults to military officials. 
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has asked for a review of sexual assault policies and the victim support network throughout the department. He asked for a report by the begin­ning of May. 
One change under review is having standard policies on sexual assaults in all the mili­tary branches and providing uniform services to victims, Chu said. 
The inquiry was prompted by stories in The Denver Post that thousands of sex offenders in the military had escaped pun­ishment and numerous women's claims of sexual assault and rape were dis­missed or mishandled by com­manders. 
The allegations were similar to stories told by Air Force Academy cadets, which prompted a purge of the acade­my's commanders and sweep­ing changes. An Air Force investigation identified 142 reported cases of sexual assault in a 10-year period. 
The Air Force also dispatched a task force to Sheppard Air Force Base in Witchita Falls, Texas, to probe claims of between 20 and 25 sexual assaults in the 2002-03 federal budget year. · 



Clear Channel limits indecency 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON The nation's largest radio station chain announced new rules to limit indecency Wednesday in the latest example of the broadcast industry's efforts to address criticism of what airs on TV and radio. 
Under pressure from regula­tors and lawmakers, some TV networks are delaying live broadcasts to delete offensive material and doing more to let parents know how they can block specific programs. The N a tiona! Association of Broadcasters says it will hold a conference on indecency next month. 
The rules issued by Clear Channel Communications came on the eve of the second con­gresssional hearing this month on broadcast indecenc~ John Hogan, president of Clear Channel Radio, is scheduled to testify along with top officials from TV networks. 
Congress is considering increasing the maximum fine for indecency from $27,500 to $275,000, a move that the Federal Communications Commission endorsed even before the tumult over singer Janet Jackson's exposed right breast during the nationally televised Super Bowl halftime show. 
"In the history of broadcast indecency, there have been these moments where it makes headlines," said Jeremy Lipschultz, a professor of com­munication at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. "In the short term, broadcasters become much more careful. You're going to see people playing it safe. The long-term problem is the same one we've had, which is it's very difficult in the end to precisely define what is indecent or not." 
Under FCC rules and federal law, radio stations and over­the-air television channels can­not air material containing ref­erences to sexual and excreto­ry functions between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., when children may be tuning in. The rules do not apply to cable and satellite channels and satellite radio. 
Chris Murray, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, said broad­casters worry that Congress, angered over indecency, might also move to ove.rturn FCC rules relaxing media ownership rules, including one that makes it easier for companies to own newspapers and broadcast sta­tions in the same community. 
"The broadcasters are quick­ly and visibly cleaning up their act on indecency because they know if Congress gets real game on smut, they won't stop there," Murray said. 
Paul Levinson, chairman of the department of communica­tions and media studies at Fordham University, said the government's efforts smack of censorship. 
"Media is supposed to be independent of the govern­ment," Levinson said. "For the government to step in and threaten media, and then for the media to go and .do what the government wants, com­pletely distorts our democratic process and our freedoms." 
Clear Channel's new policy includes companywide training about indecency, possible fines against DJs, and automatic sus­pensions for anyone accused by the FCC of violating indecency rules on the air, company offi­cials said. 
The initiative came one day after the company fired the DJ known as "Bubba the Love Sponge," whose show drew an FCC-record fine of $755,000. The program aired in four Flprida cities and included graphic discussions about sex and drugs "designed to pander to, titillate and shock listeners," the FCC said. 
"Clear Channel is serious about helping address the ris­ing tide of indecency on the air­waves," said Mark Mays, presi­dent and chief operating offi­cer. "As broadcast licensees, we are fully responsible for what our stations air, and we intend to make sure all our DJs and programmers understand what is and what is not appro­priate." 
Mel Karmazin, president of Viacom Inc., discussed indecen­cy issues during a conference call last week with officials and station managers of the compa­ny's Infinity Broadcasting radio subsidiary. Infinity, which owns 120 stations, asked them to increase efforts to avoid inde­cent programming, such as using a seven-second delay on shows with live talk, spokesman Dana McClintock said 
Infinity in 1995 paid the largest cumulative fine to date. $1.7 million, for various viola­tions by radio host Howard Stern. 
Responding to a query from the FCC, CBS and Fox TV have said they would run advertise­ments touting the V-chip, tech­nology built into a TV set to prevent children from watching certain shows. Both networks also said they were airing live programs on time delays, dis­playing ratings for their pro­grams on their Web sites, reviewing their standards and practices, and reminding affili­ate stations that they can reject network programs unsuitable for their communities.

Decisions, Decisions 
Mal(e the Choice Take the Leap 
by Rev. Jim King. c.s.c. Director of Vocations, Congregation of Holy Cross 
There was a Time magazine article more than twenty years ago where the author, Richard 
Schickel, referred to "that common cold of the male psyche, fear ofcommitment." It's not at all 
dear that the virus strikes only males, but it's our experience in dealing with men considering a 
vocation to the priesthood that the thought of making a long-term commitment scares many 
into avoiding choice-making altogether. 
We put a high premium in our society upon maintaining our independence, yet that is a very ,modern notion. It wasn't so long ago that people who hadn't married by their mid-twenties were 
considered to be "bachelors" and "spinsters," odd ducks who were fundamentally deprived by not 
having said the words "forever" to someone or something, whether to a spouse or to a religious 
vocation. We now have a better understanding that some people actually have a vocation to be 
single, but it's also true that more people drift for a long time avoiding the choices that free them 
to discover their purpose as people of faith. 
The gospels and New Testament letters are very clear. There is no great value accorded to the 
concept of independence American-style, yet in his letter to the Galatians, St. Paul speaks 
emphatically that Christ came to free us: "For you were called for freedom. Bur do not use this 
freedom as an opportunity for the flesh; rather, ser~e one another through love." (Gal5: 13) We 
often use the words freedom and independence interchangeably as if they are syrwnyms, but real 
freedom has a spiritual dimension and comes only from raking a leap of faith and making 
commitments rather than avoiding them. 
People often ask priest how we can be celibate as it is seen as depriving us of the intimacy of 
marriage and children, and, typically, we answer something to the effect that the vows, including 
poverty and obedience as well, free us to serve everyone. It's what St. Paul was getting at in his 
letter. If we want to be truly free, then we should give our lives over to whatever or whomever 
allows us to love the most..Whatever we choose, whether marriage, priesthood, religious life, or 
remaining single is going to entail letting go of something that we also want. Yet at some point 
we do have to choose. 

There was probably no commitment so binding as the one made by Peter, Andrew, James, 
and John when they left behind their fishing business and families to become apostles. St. Paul 
described apostleship as being a "slave" to Jesus Christ, yet none of them would ever have 
fulfilled their own deepest desires had they stayed in their boats. 
It isn't that a person needs to jump into a permanent commitment right out of college. In fact, the people who want to slow things down and do a year or two of service first are probably onto something. Most people don't know what they really want at the age of twenty-two. It's a good idea to take some rime to discover what we really have deep inside of ourselves to give to others, and for many it sets a clear direction for the rest of their lives. 
And, it's also a good idea to think of Lent as something more than a time to give up candy, ice cream, or booze and use it intentionally for purposes of vocational discernment. A lot can get clarified if we use every one of these days to put ourselves in the presence ofJesus and ask what we really really want because we will certainly get different answers when we sit with him then when we ask the question independently of Him.

form the basis of classical science and a team of 72 rabbis translated the Pentateur.h into Greek. 

When the Library was destroyed long ,4g0, countless irreplaceable works of 'Trterature, philosophy and history were 
lost to us forever. I chose to write about this because the new Bibliotheca Alexandrina had recently opened on the site of the original Library. Built with the support of UNESCO, the Bibliotheca Alexandrina was, I sug­gested, a beacon of hope in a world scarred by the genocide and tyranny of the Twentieth Century. 
I have been forced to reconsider my optimism after reading that the Library recently displayed an Arabic translation of a book called The Protocols of the Elders of Zion as a Jewish holy text. On the very site where over two millennia ago the Jewish scriptures were translated into the common tongue of the day, one of the most virulently anti-Semitic texts ever written -which has been described as "a warrant for genocide" -was now being presented as a Jewish holy book, equal to the Torah. 
The Protocols were written in czarist Russia, but the book is most infamous as a seminal text of Nazi anti-Jewish propaganda. It purports to be a docu­ment detailing the secret plans of a cabal of Jewish elders to gain control of the world. The text is a crude for­gery, discredited long ago, and its con­tents are outlandish even by the stan-

dards of conspiracy theories. But despite all this, it is believed by many millions of people in the Muslim world -it is of course a simplification to speak of "the Muslim world," but no more so than speaking of "Europe." As Orwell noted, "One of the marks of anti-Semitism is an ability to believe stories that could not possibly be true." 
I am not suggesting that Islam is inherently anti-Semitic. On the con­trary, for much of Islam's history, Jews suffered considerably worse persecu­tion and discrimination in Christian Europe than they did in Muslim coun­tries. It should also be noted that many of the anti-Semitic themes that are so common in countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia are European imports. One common claim, known as the blood libel, is that Jews use Christian blood to bake matzah for Passover and it has its origins in medieval Europe. One of the many books in circulation that repeats this libel, "The Matzah of Zion," recently went into its eighth edi­tion in Syria. Until recently its author, Mustafa Tlas, was the Syrian Minister of Defense . 
One gauge of the depth of anti­Semitism is the extent of its acceptabil­ity -the extent to which even senior statesmen and other public figures can make slanderous and hateful claims about Jews with impunity. 
Although not of a comparable scale, there are also disturbing signs in mod­ern Europe, where surveys continue to report widespread anti-Jewish preju­dices and where in many countries there have been upsurges in the amount of violent assaults on Jews and arson attacks on synagogues. Last year the chief rabbi of France, Joseph Sitruk, felt compelled to suggest that Jewish men should not wear their skullcaps in public so as to "avoid becoming a target for potential assailants." 
Last November in the city of Terre Haute, here in Indiana, a Holocaust museum was partially destroyed in an arson attack, and there have been sim­ilar attacks made on synagogues in San Francisco and Alameda, Calif., and Syracuse, N.Y. Many sources also report a significant increase in violent assaults against Jews, as well as reports of ethnic slurs and verbal harassment. 
One of the false lessons we some­times draw from the history of the Holocaust is that anti-Semitism has its natural home on the political Right ­we infer this in part because we are largely ignorant of the history of Italian fascism, which was ultranation­alist but not anti-Semitic. 
Nothing compares to the Holocaust in the extent of the evil perpetrated on the Jewish people, but nevertheless the sad fact is that history has shown that virulent forms of anti-Semitism are capable of being grafted onto almost any ideology. August Bebel, a friend of Karl Marx, once called it "the socialism of fools." In the century that followed, there was no shortage of fools. Last year, copies of The Protocols were sold at a number of prominent anti-war ral­lies. 
The rule should be simple: We should show no more tolerance for anti­Semitism amongst those we consider our political allies than anti-Semitism amongst our political opponents. Indeed, when we notice that the con­spiratorial theories about the malig­nant influence of Jews within the gov­ernment are currently a theme found on both the Left and the Right, we should probably recognize the limited usefulness of those terms for establish­ing who our political allies are.

Bush's plan a rotten tomato for migrant workers 
A hometown friend of mine was mistaken for a migrant work­
er at the local hospital when he mentioned he had been in North 
Carolina for the past few months. "Aye Paisanito,"or "little 
migrant worker," said the emergency room nurse without a 
moment's hesitation while she scribbled in his chart. He 
laughed. but he wasn't shocked. 
In the border town of Laredo, Texas, the 
Dolores Dlaz
people aren't supposed to-and often don't 
-have the opportunity to go off and have 
adventures. For many of us, North Carolina 
The Warm 
means working in the fields because that's 
what the many people huddled in the back Gun 
of the truck next to us are going to do. 
So now Bush, with convenient election 
timing, has called for a major overhaul of U.S. law and plans to 
give legal status to millions of illegal workers, many of which 
cross through my city every day and Hispanics are supposed to 
give him the vote. Not likely; at least not anytime soon. 
Surprised? 
On one hand, the Bush plan to give legal status to illegal 
workers has its bright side. Many Mexicans attempt to cross the 
dangerous Hio Grande daily, braving a river teeming with tricky 
undercurrents, biohazardous waste and multi-tailed fish. If 
Bush's plan were to be put into action, many lives would be 
spared. 
The border patrol will be able to rest a little easier without 
having to deal with the enormous number of people who cross 
illegally, even though they'll still have to go through individual 
documentation of commuters, not to mention the increased traf­
fic congestion at the bridge that will make my highway a living 
nightmare. 
My schoolmate who got caught smuggling illegal migrant 
workers into the country may also be happy to hear about · Bush's new and "great" idea, as will the maids that work at many of the houses in the neighborhood, even though their 
employers may not be too thrilled about the extra expense­
not that they'd actually pay it. 
The foolish man that inserted his foot into his mouth and sat 
next to me on the plane last summer complaining about 
Mexican Americans will be pissed. 
But I doubt the migrant workers that make up the majority of 
illegal workers will come any closer to getting the basic respect 
they deserve. 
Firstly, the conditions for these workers won't necessarily be 
improved by the Bush plan. The fact that the migrant worker is 
horribly exploited by cheap labor isn't exactly groundbreaking 
news, but people must take into account that this is not the only 
exploitation that the workers suffer. Even though the Bush plan 
would ensure minimum wage and fix the cheap labor problem, 
it wouldn't change the other ways in which the workers are 
demeaned. 
While the Bush initiative may ensure the workers with mini­
mum wage, they are still readily exploited through a language 
barrier, lack of education and a make-no-objection mentality 
that makes the migrant worker the ultimate victim. Under 
Bush's plan, the migrant worker must be sponsored by a compa­
ny -that is, must be claimed as a worker which would give the 
company just as much bargaining power over the worker. The 
worker doesn't really gain any more power as a legitimate 
employee than an illegitimate one. 
Bush's plan also specifies that workers can apply for guest 
worker status at a U.S. company only if it is proved that no U.S. 
citizen is there to take the job. It seems odd to prove something 
like that and all too easy to manipulate that sort of information. 
If what Bush is trying to do is put Americans that are worried 
about their jobs at ease, it doesn't seem to be working. The 
unanswered questions just underline the anxiety that many 
already feel about voting for Bush. 
Additionally, legal worker status would only be granted for a 
period of three years initially. But what happens·when this peri­
od is up? If after this term the worker must leave and the com­
pany must find a replacement. both the worker and the compa­
ny would lose. Now, for a migrant worker, it would seem more 
practical to continue in illegal status, avoiding documentation 
that would make them traceable and force them to leave the 
country after three years than acquire legal status. Bush hasn't 
specified, but there are definite questions that remain. 
The bottom line is that Bush would have to make some 
detailed outlines of his plan before Hispanics and all concerned 
can feel comfortable voting for him. If Bush really wants the 
Hispanic vote, the plan must include a more sound way to com­
bat the exploitation of the migrant worker-that and he must 
change to the Democratic ticket. As of yet, the realization of 
either of these seems unlikely.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


Eating religiously 
I realize that it is the Lenten season for Catholics, but it seems that the University has forgotten that a large population of the students here are not Catholic. 
When I walked into the dining hall on Ash Wednesday, I was offended and angry to find that absolutely no meat products, save for fish, was being offered at the dining halls. Chicken patties had been replaced by grilled cheese, taco meat was replaced by shrimp and the sandwich bar only had peanut butter and jelly. Laughably, even the bacon bits from the salad bar had been removed, which do not contain any real meat products. 
While I understand that this is a Catholic university, the Notre Dame administration has crossed the line into fascism by forcing their views upon us. I can understand if the dining halls had more non-meat selections to cater to the Catholics on all the Fridays from now until Easter, but to absolutely remove meat from the dining halls at these times is a violation of my right to choose. 
My shock at not finding meat at the dining halls was shared by many -Catholics and non-Catholics alike. Even my fundamentalist Catholic friends agreed that the University should offer meat to its non-Catholic students; and not surprisingly, many of my Catholic friends do consume meat products other than fish on Ash Wednesday. 
The administration has been going down a slippery slope and forcefully exercising its iron fist more and more. Not only has it prohibited many Mardi Gras celebrations -as previously mentioned in Viewpoint -but it now has crossed the line into controlling our food consumption, forcing us into practicing its Catholic beliefs. 
That is simply too far. 
Chris Vierig freshman Keenan Hall Feb. 25 
Defending the minority 
I wish to express my disappointment at the harsh attacks made upon my classmate Mr. Ryan Iafigliola regarding his views on drink­ing. I, too, am a non-drinker and agree with him that it can, at times, be difficult to live in such a way. 
We are treated, not by all, but at least by some, as if we have a "social defect," some diseased area of our brain that prevents us from "living it up" and "having the full col­lege experience." There are drinkers I know who would love to get me drunk, even though they know how I feel about it. 
The defenses of drinking offered by Miss Caitlyn Smith in her letter are almost entire­ly flawed. First, the relationship between the Bible and wine is not an explicit endorsement of drinking by any and all. Jesus' purpose in performing the miracle at Cana was not simply so his friends, who were probably all responsible adults, could get drunk. It was to show, in part, who He was. 
Additionally, there are stories in the Bible, such as when Lot is made drunk by his daughters who then sleep with him (Genesis 
19: 30-38), where drunkenness and alcohol in general contribute to immoral behavior. As for wine in Mass, may I note that when consecrated, it is no longer wine, but the Blood of Christ Himself. It is the transforma­tion of the wine that makes it sacred. I would hope that all Catholics, whether at this institution or any other, would remem­ber that fact. 
Second, when referring to Plato and the philosophy of Socrates, I would note that just because the ancient Greeks acted in a certain manner does not mean that we are right to act in the same way. Slavery was an accepted practice in ancient Greece. Should we therefore bring back slavery, simply because they practiced it? Additionally, I doubt that Ms. Smith would advocate that President Bush and Congress get drunk while running our government in order to improve decision making. 
Although Mr. Iafigliola may have been gen­eralizing io some degree, his assessment is certainly true in some cases. I would not be surprised to find that someone I know who drinks does so because of personal, emo­tional or psychological problems. While all drinkers may not be in this situation, there are most certainly some who are. 
Furthermore, no person whether a heavy drinker, mild drinker or non-drinker, will deny that "getting fat, puking, poor decision making and increased chance of physical or sexual assault," are potential consequences of drinking. 
Notre Dame may not explicitly endorse 
drinking, but at the same time it does not 
enforce most of its policies on alcohol. Read 
pages 88-90 of du Lac, think about what 
happens almost every weekend on this cam­
pus, and you will be unable to deny this fact. 
The banning of hard alcohol does nothing 
but force students who wish to get smashed 
to drink larger quantities of beer instead of 
smaller quantities of hard alcohol. Though 
the administration does not encourage it, 
there is a tacit acceptance of the pervasive 
drinking culture on this campus. 
Mr. Matthew Wormington's assertion that 
the numbers given by Mr. Iafigliola are 
invalid is easily proven false. Do the math. 
There are around 8,000 undergraduates 
here at Notre Dame. Twelve percent of 
8,000 students is 960. This means that 
roughly 7,000 people on this campus do 
drink. Ifthere are around 2,000 people per . class, this easily covers three out of the four classes, as well as half of another. The cited facts and figures demonstrate that even if only underage classes are considered, non­
drinkers are still a minority, and a shrinking 
one at that. A word of advice to Mr. 
Wormington: Next time you explicitly state 
that you are breaking Indiana state law, 
remember the fifth Amendment. 
When underage people choose to drink, 
they are essentially saying that the law only 
applies to them when they feel it should. I 
have heard it said, "Well, I'm just as mature 
as a 21-year-old, probably even more so, so 
I should be able to drink." Such an attitude 
sets a dangerous precedent. By this ration­
ale, if I feel that laws against murder are 
below me, then it shouldn't matter if I vio­
late them. After all, it's just a "personal 
choice." 
Maybe it's just me, but it's usually not the 
sober people who are involved in illegal or 
immoral activities on this campus. If my 
personal choice results in me being a better 
human being, then perhaps I have the right 
to claim some moral high ground. I, for one, 
choose not to drink and encourage others 
not to because I believe it is the wiser 
course of action. I would be shirking my 
duty as a loving Christian if I did not try and 
help my fellow human beings live the best 
life possible. If I am being judgmental in 
expressing that opinion, so be it.

ALBUM REVIEW 

Kanye West, the future of hip hop 
By ARIENNE THOMPSON Scene Music Critic 

Kanye West is a breath of fresh air in an increasingly stale industry where cars, sex and bling reign supreme. West's eagerly anticipated debut album, The College Dropout, is fun, creative and at times irreverent, blending his top-notch skills as Roc-A-Pella's in­house producer with his talents as a decent MC. His role as a producer how­ever, is the one that paved his way to success and notoriety in the hip-hop world. With an impressive clientele list that includes labelmate Jay-Z, Monica, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, Ludacris and Britney Spears, West is as much in demand as some of the hottest produc­ers around like the Neptunes and Timbaland. Although he certainly deliv­ers for others, as evidenced by the Alicia Keys' smash "You Don't Know My Name," West proves that he did indeed save some of his best beats for himself. 
Throughout Dropout, West reveals his appreciation for classic R&B, sampling heavily from the songs of established stars like Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye and Luther Vandross. Fortunately, West possesses the skills and judgment to know just how much of a sample is needed and, in turn, how to tweak it for his specific musical needs. Unlike other chronic samplers whose cringe-induc­ing songs verge on criminal (think P. Diddy, Jennifer Lopez, etc.), West is smart and innovative, using, for exam­ple, Chaka Khan's hook from "Through the Fire" to buttress his current hit "Through the Wire," which he vocalized with a wired jaw. 
Playing with notions about higher education, opportunity and social mobility, West also manages to deliver some of his political and cultural views among his solid production and lyrics. On the furious and lazy "Spaceship," West complains about a job at the GAP over a sample of Marvin Gaye's "Distant Lover." He laments about workplace racism, declaring, "If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him ... I Take me to the back and pat me askin' me bout some khakis I But let some black people walk in I bet you they show off I they token blackey I 0 now they love Kanye let's put him all in the front of the store." The humorous and cheeky "The New Workout Plan" satirizes so-called "video hos" and groupies, while "Jesus Walks" and "We Don't Care" question the state of a world mired in poverty, terrorism and racial inequality. 
These successes notwithstanding, West is at his best on the standout track "Two Words," featuring Mos Def, label­mate Freeway, and the Harlem Boys Choir. Backed by a superb beat and swelling vocals, West boasts that he is the "most imitated, Grammy nominated .. . I Two words, Chi town, raised me, crazy I So I live by two words, ... pay me." 
By REBECCA SAUNDERS Scene Music Critic 

Thrilling: A word any new band wants to be· described as. But why wait for the critics to call you that? Better yet, just make it the name of your band! The new Virgin Records band The Thrills seems to have adopt­ed just that strategy in choosing their extremely suggestive name. However, the question looms: Are they what they suggest? 
Ironically enough, their first album, So Much for the City, is a slower sound overall, with a few mildly upbeat songs dispersed throughout the album. A "thrilling" rock track would be expected but is not found, although this is not a detriment to the album. While the name may suggest the spirit of the band rather than their style of music, no one is asking for any changes to be made. The five-piece, Dublin-based band seems to be of a different yet thrilling nature. 
The majority of the band members were friends from adolescence, and after a couple of years of learning and practicing music, the band took a four month vacation to San Diego, Calif. in the summer of 1999. It was their love of the '60s West Coast music that led them to San Diego, and once they arrived they found sofas that they pulled onto the beach and wrote their album. The California influence is obvious, if not the focus, of their album. Of the 11 songs, eight are blatantly related to, if not about, California, the beach and the sun. Thus The Thrills cover three of many young adults' favorite things -not bad for subject matter. 
Influenced by The Beach Boys, ESP, Burt Bacharach, as well as "The Virgin Suicides" and "West Side Story," and also their 
He also shines on "Last Call," which is essentially a thank you note to his label Roc-A Fella. He dis­cusses his accomplish­ments and goals, saying "I went to the malls and I balled too hard I Oh my God is that a black card I I turned around and I replied why yes I But I prefer the term African American Express I Brains, power and muscle like Dame, Puffy & Russell I Your boy back on his hustle you know what I been up to I Killin y'all ... on that lyrical [tip] I Mayonnaise color Benz I I push miracle whips." 
Besides the usual rapper-to-rapper collaborations, Dropout features an unexpected musician who contributes to about half the album. Israeli artist Miri Ben-Ari, dubbed the "Hip-hop Violinist," is inventive and fresh, infus­ing the album with sounds and musical patterns that no doubt help distinguish Dropout from other hip-hop albums. West also teams up with noteworthy and skilled MCs like Jay-Z, Common, Talib Kweli and Twista. 

In all, West's debut effort is clever and capable, presenting his talents as a rapper-producer and highlighting his consciousness and concerns as a young adult. He only narrowly escapes being bogged down by the tiring, incessant skits that have become standard on hip­hop albums by making his interludes funny and bold. Despite this near-flaw, West is golden and is certainly giving his colleagues and fellow Roc-A-Pella members M.E.M.P.H.I.S. Bleek, Freeway and Cam'Ron something to think about. As these three try to keep their careers afloat, their label and the world recog­nize that Kanye West is the future, leav­ing little room for mediocrity and even less time for them to play catch-up .

ALBUM REVIEW 

Irish band releases thrilling debut 


Irish descent, The Thrills produce a unique and interesting sound on So Much for the City. As for their creative name, The Thrills claim it was "inspired in equal parts by Phil Spectors' 

Sixties girl groups and Michael Jackson's greatest LP." These guys do not fit into any box rock and roll has come across before. 
Throughout their album, the songs are interesting and musically unique for our time. The influence of the Beach Boys is very apparent, but the overall sound is much stronger than the melodies of the Beach Boys. With stronger drum and bass presence, the catchy melody is sung by the gentle voice of lead singer Conor Deasy. There is a lot of Beach Boys-esque echoing in choruses and such, and overall it really works. Keys are inte­gral to So Much for the City, as is the often plucking sound of a gentler gui­tar that has been seen in much cut-rent rock music. There really is not a song worth skipping on the entire record. Some of the stronger songs are "Santa Cruz (You're Not That Far)," "Don't Steal Our Sun," "Big Sur" and "Your Love is Like Las Vegas." Some of the songs even have a bit of a country twang to them, like "Say It Ain't So," and many of the songs have a harmonica sound added to the melody. 
So Much for the City is a good album done by a very unique band. The Thrills have produced an album per­fect for spring break and even better for these cold weeks leading up to it.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Mason Jennings keeps it real 
By JULIE BENDER 
Scene Music Critic 
Trying to describe Mason Jeanings' voice is nearly impossible. Lots of words come to mind -clear, authentic, straightforward, folky, nonchalant, hill billy -but none of these quite captures the sound and pres­ence that leaves his voice resonating long after the song is done. The word that comes the closest is antique, and antique is a good word to describe the whole of Jennings' fourth album, aptly titled Use Your Voice. Jennings follows his own advice, and his voice becomes the spice and life of every song on the album, result­ing in a spare yet melodic collection of ten songs that ranges from the political to the personal. 
On the grand-scale of musicians, Jennings is still small-time, but his loyal fan base stretches the globe. On his c;>wn record label. Jennings has managed to sell close to 100,000 albums through word of mouth, 
touring and the Internet. In 

Minneapolis, the city he calls home, Jennings is often regarded as the next Bob Dylan or Johnny Cash, both of whom happen to be two of his biggest influences. Of his latest album, Jennings says on his website, "I was really influenced by Johnny Cash's American recordings and Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks -I love the no­frills sound on those records and that recording style makes the songs stand out and it sounds real to me." 
"No frills" is a good way to describe Use Your Voice. The album is a very simple construction of guitar, bass. drums, an occasional harmonica, and of course, Jennings' voice. The lack of production on this album was an intentional decision for Jennings who has toured with Jack Johnson, and is currently touring the west coast. As he says on his website, "Sometimes I feel that people don't think you're a good musician if you're not polished or on

Jacksonville, Florida has a check­ered past, at best, when it comes to producing quality music. It has gen­erated one of the most creative and influential bands in the classic rock genre: Lynyrd Skynryd. However, it also gave the world one of the most annoying and unoriginal flash-in the-pan bands with Limp Bizkit. Now, it appears as though Jacksonville is ready to redeem itself with their newest hometown hero ­Shinedown. 
Shinedown was formed in the early months of 2001, after lead singer Brent Smith left his former band on the eve of their own record deal. The next year saw Smith join gui­tarist Jasin Todd, bassist Brad Stewart, and drummer Barry Kerch to form Shinedown. It did not take the boys long to hone their skills and consequently gain the chemistry needed for a successful band. Shinedown came together quickly, and it took less than a year for the labels to begin knocking on their door as they were signed in early 2002. 
Shinedown has a wide spectrum of the radio. And that makes me

wouldn't get a record deal today mainly because they sang from their hearts and not to get on the radio or anything like that. They just wrote songs for themselves, and that was my vision behind Use Your Voice: to sing from my heart." 
Without restriction on his music from a record company, Jennings is truly able to sing from his heart, with his voice and knack for melody helping him out. One of the best songs on the album is "Ballad for Paul and Sheila," a eulogy for former Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone, who died with his wife in a plane crash last October. Jennings was on tour when he heard about the Wellstone's death and was deeply affected by it. causing him to write this song. Over gentle guitar picking Jennings' sings, "Hey Senator, I wanna say I all the things you fought for did not die here today I hey Senator, I'm gonna do I all the things I can to live my life more like you lived."

influences that range from fellow hometown sons Lynyrd Skynryd to Led Zeppelin. Consequently, the sound that makes up Shinedown's freshman release, Leave A Whisper, is more mature than what most radio stations are currently crank­ing out. Shinedown manages to mix a thunderous guitar with passionate vocals not seen since Black Sabbath. 
Leave A Whisper begins with Shinedown's radio debut, "Fly From the Inside," which serves as the per­fect track to introduce listeners to their sound. The song manages to express everything Shinedown does well on a single track. "Fly From the Inside" begins with a simple guitar that is joined by bass and drums until they fade and the guitar is left. It is this timing of the instruments to stay away from political themes, and instead deal with lovesick confusion, work­ingman blues, homesickness and happi­ness. The opening track, "Crown," blows in with a steady beat and a bluesy harmonica with Jennings singing about his ambiva­lence toward a former lover who broke his heart. "Empire Builder" features Jennings' voice swinging like the hammer he uses during working days on the railroad. "Keepin It Real" is an uplifting number with Jennings' voice brimming with spirit: "There ain't no rust on the happiness bus." 
Although mainstream fame isn't some­thing Jennings is seeking, his music, lyrics and vocals arc of a quality deserving recog­nition. His own lyrics describe his musical philosophy best: "In our hearts we're keepin' it, keepin' it, keepin' it, keepin' it real."

 Bonds attacks Wendell for accused steroid use 
Associated Press 

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -Barry Bonds chastised Colorado reliever Turk Wendell on Wednesday for accusing him of using steroids. 
A day after Wendell said it was "clear just seeing his body" that Bonds was taking steroids, the San Francisco Giants slug­ger said the remark should've been made directly to him ­not a reporter. 
"I heard about his comments.
-If you've got something to say, say it to my face," Bonds said. "Don't talk through the media." ''I'm not worried about him. I'm not worried about anyone. I have a lot of respect for Turk Wendell. I have a lot of respect for every baseball player in this game," he added. "You got something to say, you come to my face and say it and we'll deal with each other. Don't talk through the media like you're some tough guy." On Tuesday in Tucson, Wendell criticized Bonds to The Denver Post. Bonds, who has always denied using steroids, appeared in December before a grand jury probing a supplements lab accused of illegally distributing steroids to athletes. His trainer, Greg Anderson, was among four men charged this month. All the men have pleaded innocent and no ath­letes have been charged. "If my personal trainer, me, 
-
Turk Wendell, got indicted for that, there's no one in the world who wouldn't think that I was­n't taking steroids," Wendell was quoted as saying by the Post. "I mean,_ what, because he's Barry Bonds, no one's going to say that? I mean, obvi­ously he did it. (His trainer} admitted to giving steroids to baseball players. He just doesn't want to say his name. You don't have to. It's clear just seeing his body." 
Rockies pitcher Denny Neagle also chimed in on the subject. "It is a pretty good coinci­denc.e that some of the names 
that are linked to them are the guys that are the big, massive, overmuscular looking guys," Neagle told the Post. 
"I don't know or remember what Jason Giambi looked like back in his early days, but I know he wasn't as big as he is now. The jury is always going to be out on Barry." 
Speaking after the Giants' first full-squad workout at spring training, Bonds also hint­ed that he isn't going to put up with as much from pitchers this season-but he didn't go as far as saying he'd retaliate if he gets hit.

Associated Press 
CAHLSBAD, Calif. -Tiger Woods never had the lead until it mattered Wednesday, making birdies on his final two holes to survive a scare from John Hollins in the Match Play Championship. 
Facing a first-round elimina­tion for the second time in three years. Woods twice made knee­knocking pars to stay in the game, pulled even with an 8­iron from 171 yards that plunk1~d down 18 inches behind the cup on No. 17. then won the battle· of wedges on the par-5 closing hole. 
By the time Woods holed a 20­foot birdie putt for a 1-u p victo­ry. Hollins already had taken live shots. 
"That was tough," Woods said. "I feel bad for the way he ended up." 
Woods wasn't the only player who survived a thriller. A record-tying six matches

Tiger survives scare, beats Rollins in first round 
Rollins. who got into the $7 .._ million World Golf Championship when three play­ers withdrew, never trailed despite only making one birdie. 
Woods had good looks at birdies on four straight holes, starting at No. 7, but missed them all. The longer the match went, the more confidence Rollins 'had. 
"I should have taken control of the match," Woods said. 
Instead, he hooked his tee shot out-of-bounds on the 11th ' ... hole, and Hollins' birdied the par-3 12th for a 2-up lead. 
Woods got it back with a par on the next hole, but had to scramble to stay in the match. 
It all turned on the 17th. 
Woods' towering 8-iron landed 18 inches behind the cup, hopped forward and spun back 2 feet from the hole. 
Hollins knew he had to make his 45-foot birdie, and ran it 10 feet by for a meaningless three­putt. 
went extra holes, none more riv­eting than Darren Clarke holing an eagle chip from just short of the 18th green to square his match with Eduardo Romero. They each made par on the next .six holes, and Clarke closed him out on the 25th hole when the 
Argentine made bogey. 
Given the wacky history of this 
event, the big surprise was that 
there wasn't many. 
Retief Goosen (No. 5) was the 
only top-1 0 seed to head for the 
airport Wednesday afternoon, 
blowing a 2-up lead and losing 
to John Huston on the 17th hole. 
Davis Love III had to go 18 holes to hold off Briny Baird, but other top seeds -Vijay Singh. Masters champion Mike Weir. Phil Mickelson and Kenny Perry -had a much easier time advancing to the second round of the Accenture Match Play Championship. 
For the longest time, it appeared as though Woods might not stick around.

Sather resigns as Rangers coach, remains president/GM 
Associated Press 
GHEENBUHGII, N.Y. -The losing. the chants and the lack of ef'l'ort from the New York Hangers convinced Glen Sather it was time to start making changes-beginning with him­self. 
Sather stepped down 
Wednesday as coach of the Hangers. staying on as presi­dent and general manager and signaling that more changes lie ahead as the March 9 trading deadline nears. 
"There isn't anyone in the organization that has a no­trade in his contract, so I think when we get down to that stage 
we'll make some decisions," Sather said. 
"We're going to spend the next couple weeks evaluating where we're going to go and how we're going to get to where we decide to go. When the deadline comes around, you'll probably have an idea."

Reviving Pitchers: Braves have the magic 
Associated Press 
KISSIMMEE, Fla. -Hey, are you a pitcher who's down on his luck? ­
Can't seem to find the strike zone? Had a few injury prob­lems? Wondering if your career might be over? 
Well, it might be time to check out the Atlanta Braves, who have made a habit of reviving struggling pitchers' careers. 
From John Burkett to Mike Hampton to Jaret Wright, the Braves have shown a magic touch. This is definitely the place to be if your ERA starts to resemble Yao Ming's height. 
From pitching coach Leo Mazzone's perspective, it all starts in spring training, where the Braves held their first full­squad workout Wednesday. 
Pitchers don't have to go to the outfield to shag flies during bat­ting practice. 
Once their work is done, they're free to leave. That's led to a standing joke: Don't get between a pitcher and the golf course after he's done throwing. 
"It's all about the pitchers around here," Mazzone said. "They are first-class citizens, and they get treated that way." 
For Wright, coming to the Braves was a chance to rekindle a once-promising career. Only 21 when he started Game 7 of the 1997 World Series for Cleveland, two operations left the right-hander scraping rock­bottom. 
Wright was 1-4 with an 8.74 ERA for lowly San Diego when the Braves claimed him off waivers late last season. He pitched well in relief, made the postseason roster and now has a chance to be in the starting rota­tion. l-Ie's a big supporter of Mazzone's pitching mantra: Have command of the fastball and change speeds. 
"That fits in well with what I've always thought," Wright said. "I just never tried to make it too complicated. A lot of guys make it real complicated and wind up getting away from what they do best." 
Burkett is perhaps the best advertisement for the Braves' rejuvenating qualities. He was cut by Tampa Bay at the end of spring training in 2000 -not exactly indicative of a career on the upswing. Picked up by the Braves, he made the All-Star team a year later. 
Now retired, Burkett fondly remembers starting for the Braves on opening day in 2001. Greg Maddux was injured late in the spring, but manager Bobby Cox didn't want to juggle his entire rotation. So he simply moved Burkett -projected as the No. 5 starter-into the lead spot. 
"I really appreciated that," Burkett said in a telephone interview. "I wanted to do well for Bobby." 
Then there's Hampton, whose career fell apart -as so many do-in Colorado's thin air. After two miserable years with the Rockies, he was traded to the Braves before last season. 
Talk about a turnaround. Hampton regained command of his sinker and helped the Braves win their 12th straight division title, going 14-8 with a 3.84 ERA. 
"Last year, I worked out the kinks with Leo," Hampton said. "Now, it's just about getting to work." 
Mazzone, the pitching coach since 1990, gets much of credit for Atlanta's success on the mound. He's certainly been blessed with plenty of talent, including Cy Young winners Maddux, John Smoltz and Tom Glavine. 
But it's Mazzone's work with those guys on the fringes -the fifth starter, the middle reliever -that makes him especially valuable. The names change from year to year, but Atlanta keeps coming up with produc­tive pitchers from the least likely places. 
Such as retirement. Chris Hammond left the game for 2 1/2 years, but his return with the Braves produced some astonishing results in 2002: 7-2, 
0.95 ERA. 
NCAA MEN'S BASTKETBALL 



Top conferences prosper 
Associated Press 

INDIANAPOLIS -Saint Joseph's and Gonzaga have made a strong case for the nation's mid-major programs. 
But even in a season where some of college basketball's top conferences -notably the Big Ten and Pac-10 ­have been mediocre, there appears to be little change in the NCAA's tournament selec­tion process. 
When the 65-team field is announced March 14, the six power conferences -the Atlantic Coast Conference, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, 
Pac-10  and  Southeastern  
Conference  - are  again  
expected  to  dominate the  
selections.  

And the process seems to favor them. 
"It depends on the league and the individual work the institution has done," NCAA selection committee chairman Bob Bowlsby said Wednesday.

"Our job is to take the 31 automatic qualifiers and the 34 best at-large teams we can find." 
Almost annually, the vast majority of those teams come from the big six leagues. 
The committee took 27 teams from those conferences in 2002 and 30 last year. The number could increase again, with some projections show­ing eight teams from the SEC, as many as seven from the ACC and six from the Big East. 
But Bowlsby believes the significant success of the mid­majors this year will make the selection committee's task even more difficult. 
Second-ranked Saint Josepq's (24-0) and fourth­ranked Gonzaga (23-2) lead the way and No. 16 Southern Illinois (23-2) and No. 24 Utah State (22-2) aren't far behind. 
Other worthy candidates include Air Force (19-5), 
which is fighting for its first tournament berth since 1962, and Xavier (16-9). 
"It seems to me that we have more teams under sur­veillance than in previous years," Bowlsby said. 
"I think a lot of teams can play and a lot of players can play." 
Will it make a difference? Maybe. 
Bowlsby, Iowa's athletic director, insisted the commit­tee will look at the same cri­teria it usually does -sched­ule strength. conference and non-conference records. home and away records and the Ratings Percentage Index. 
Inevitably, those factors seem to favor the stronger conferences, particularly the RPI. 
"It is kind of an element of a self-fulfilling prophecy once you get into conference play," Bowlsby said. "But it's a mis­take to use the RPI as a preci­sion instrument."

The Champ Bailey for Clinton Portis deal is almost done, barring a breakdown in contract talks between Bailey and the Denver Broncos. 
Still, the proposed Washington-Denver trade that has been discussed all week shared top billing Wednesday with Mike Williams' decision to leave national champion Southern California and enter the NFL draft. 
The New England Patriots, meanwhile, said that two-time Super Bowl MVP Tom Brady under­went a minor procedure on his throwing shoulder.

windfall for some team picking in the top half of the April 25 draft. 
The 6-foot-5, 230­pound wide receiver, a sophomore, is the first underclassman to declare for the draft since a judge in a case involving Ohio State running back Maurice Clarett invalidat­ed the NFL rule that made players ineligible until they had been out of high school for three years. 
In the view of NFL scouts, the 20-year-old Williams is a rare exam­ple of a young player who can make the jump, although there arc ques­tions about his speed.

The team said the progno­sis was good. 
Another proposed deal moved forward, too: the swap of Keyshawn Johnson from Tampa to Dallas for Joey Galloway. That trade was contingent on the Cowboys and Bucs adjusting the contracts of the wide receivers, whose teams have become disen­chanted with them. 
Galloway talked Wednesday with Tampa Bay coach Jon Gruden. Talks between Johnson and Dallas coach Bill Parcells weren't neces­sary-Johnson played three seasons for Parcells with the New York Jets. 
The Redskins and 
Broncos have agreed in principle to the Bailey­Portis trade, with the Redskins throwing in a second-round draft pick to get the third-year run­ning back, who rushed for 1,591 yards last season. 
But like the Dallas­Tampa Bay trade, the deal won't be a sure thing until Bailey, a Pro Bowl corner­back in four of his five seasons with Washington, agrees to a new contract with the Broncos. 
"It's hard for us to really say this is done, that is done, because some of the stuff is still up in the air," Washington coach Joe Gibbs said.

Infamous foul ball getting explosive Chicago send-off CHICAGO -This ball is going, going ... Ka-BlAM! In an event applying the gloss of Hollywood and P.T. Barnum to the 
"curse" of the Chicago Cubs, the foul ball that couldn't be caught in October's playoffs will be obliterated by a special-effects expert on live tele­vision Thursday night. 
The ball-bashing, taking place with spring training just underway, is being done to bring some closure to one of the most painful losses in the Cubs' doleful history. 
Grant DePorter, who helped buy the ball at a December auction for $113,824 on behalf of Harry Caray's Hestaurant Group, has lined up three hours of music, comedy and celebrity appearances leading up to the climac­tic event -everything short of Steve Bartman, the hapless fan who deflect­ed the ball during Game 6 of the NL championship series. 
The ball will be sent into oblivion by Michael Lantieri, an Oscar winner who wrecks things for a living and has worked on such movies as "Jurassic Park" and "Back to the Future." Lantieri, a Cubs die-hard himself, would not reveal his exact demolition plans but admitted he has been blow­ing up a dozen balls a day in his California lab in preparation. 
Milwaukee's T.J Ford out for two to three weeks 
MILWAUKEE -Milwaukee point guard T.J. Ford is expected to miss two to three weeks because of a bruised spinal cord. 
Ford was carried off the court on a stretcher after falling hard during the fourth quarter Tuesday night against Minnesota. 
The rookie spent the night at St. Luke's Medical Center. Further evalua­tion, including an MHI, found Ford sustained a mild bruise, the Bucks said Wednesday. 
Strawberry resigns from Yankees post 
TAMPA, Fla. -Darryl Strawberry resigned as a player development instructor with the New York Yankees on Wednesday to spend more time with church-related activ­ities. 
"Because of the commitments that I have to my church, which includes considerable travel, I do not feel I can fulfill my obligations to be with the Yankees at this time," Strawberry said in a statement. 
"I must therefore leave my position as a player development instructor. While I truly love baseball, my focus and passion now are outreach to the community and youth evangelism." 
The eight-time All-Star, who has overcome a drug addiction. prison term and cancer, was hired last November. lie was going to work with the major league team during spring training and with minor lea­guers the rest of the year.

Nets' 14-game streak ended 
Associated Press 
MINNEAPOLIS Troy Hudson filled the shoes of Sam Cassell just fine, helping end the New Jersey Nets' winning streak at 14 games. 
Hudson, making his first start of the season in place of the injured Cassell, scored a season­high 29 points as Minnesota beat New Jersey 81-68 on Wednesday night, handing Nets coach Lawrence Frank his first loss. 
Hudson, the streaky shooter who has been hampered all sea­son by a sprained ankle, erased any hope for Frank's 14th con­secutive win with 12 fourth­quarter points. Hudson and Fred Hoiberg scored Minnesota's first 20 points of the quarter, and the Wolves used a 15-0 run to open a 75-58 lead. 
Hoiberg started the quarter with a 3-pointer and two foul shots before Hudson took over. He nailed a turnaround jumper from the perimeter, scored on a drive and hit another long jumper to bring the crowd to its feet. 
Hoiberg then brought another roar from the crowd with a 3­pointer to make it 69-58. Hudson followed with two straight 3s, and the rout was on. 
Kevin Garnett scored 18 points and Wally Szczerbiak, who missed 53 games with a plantar fascia strain, added a season-high 14 points. Hornets 99, Clippers 93 
Baron Davis' 26 points and nine assists led the New Orleans Hornets out of a two-game los­ing skid with a victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. 
Jamaal Magloire had 21 

points and 14 rebounds, includ­ing a jump hook off an offensive rebound to give New Orleans a 91-85 lead with just under two minutes left. 
Jamal Mashburn scored 20 for the Hornets, while P.J. Brown hit a pair of late jumpers and grabbed a key rebound with 28 seconds remaining as part of his 14 points and 12 rebounds 
Elton Brand led Los Angeles with 19 points, while reserve Chris Wilcox had 18, including a dunk that cut New Orleans' lead to 93-91 inside the fmal 30 sec­onds. But the Clippers were forced to foul, and Darrell Armstrong made four free throws in the final 20 seconds. 
New Orleans turned up its defensive intensity in the second half, forcing 13 turnovers that led to 11 points. 
Davis missed Wednesday morning's shootaround, and coach Tim Floyd said he was having stomach problems and might not play. But Davis started and was solid throughout, caus­ing turnovers and turning them into points on half-court drives or crisp passes to open shooters. He also hit two 3-pointers in the fourth quarter, one from several feet behind the arc. 
New Orleans shot 53 percent in the first half, but turnover dif­ferential helped Los Angeles stay close. The Clippers, who average 16 turnovers per game, committed none in the first half while converting seven Hornets turnovers into 10 points. 
Maggette's 3-pointer midway through the second quarter gave Los Angeles a 41-33 lead, but 3-pointers by Davis and Mashburn helped New Orleans cut its deficit to 47-45. 
A short baseline jumper by Magloire, who had 15 points and nine rebounds in the half, gave the Hornets a 50-47 lead, and New Orleans led 50-49 at halftime after Quentin Richardson hit a layup for his 13th point of the half. Richardson finished with 18 points. 
Bucks 106, Celtics 104 

Walter McCarty's 3-pointer was waved off at the buzzer, the referees ruling it came too late as the Boston Celtics lost to the Milwaukee Bucks. 
Michael Redd scored 26 points and Desmond Mason added 21 for Milwaukee, which won back­to-hack road games for the sec­ond time this season. 

Boston lost its seventh straight game and has dropped 13 of 14. 
After the Celtics took a 101­100 lead on a three-point play by Mark Blount, Milwaukee responded with baskets by Keith Van Horn, Damon Jones and Redd to take a 106-101 lead. Ricky Davis followed with a bas­ket and free throw to pull the Celtics within two. 
Paul Pierce led the Celtics with 21 points before fouling out with 2:49 remaining. Blount chipped in 20 points and 10 rebounds. 

Trailing 40-28 after one quar­ter, the Bucks went on a 12-0 run to start the second quarter behind six points from Erick Strickland. Mason led Milwaukee with 13 second­quarter points on 6-of-7 shoot­ing. 
Brandon Hunter scored a career-high 17 points and grabbed nine rebounds, while Chucky Atkins added 14 points and eight assists for Boston. 
NHL 

Chicago takes 1-goal win frotn Colutnbus 
Associated Press 

COLUMBUS, Ohio -Tuomo Ruutu had two goals and an assist and Kyle Calder added the winning score and two assists, leading the Chicago Blackhawks to a 4-3 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Wednesday night. 
Columbus scrambled back from a 3-f deficit to pull even early in the third period. But Calder redirected Ruutu's slap shot from the top of the right circle with 3:50 left. 
Stephane Robidas added a short-handed goal and an assist for the Blackhawks, who are averaging four goals over their last six games. 
David Vyborny and Anders Eriksson each scored a goal and had an assist for Columbus, which lost its fifth in a row. Tyler Wright added the other Blue Jackets goal and Rick Nash had a career­high three assists. 
The Blue Jackets tied it at 3 on Wright's power-play goal 
5:09 into the final period. 

Columbus weathered a four-minute double-minor for high-sticking on Eriksson midway through the period before Calder got his 18th goal. 
Craig Anderson, who shut out the Blue Jackets 7-0 in January, covered Vyborny's tip off a pass from Nash with 30 seconds left. 
The Blackhawks scored six seconds into a Columbus power play in the opening period. Chicago won the face­off after a bench minor for Cassels, activated earlier in the day after missing 22 games with a broken foot, picked up an assist. 
Chicago answered on Ruutu's 11th. He slammed in a long rebound of Calder's shot off goaltender Marc Denis. 
Ruutu's second goal made it 3-1 early in the second peri­od. He skated past two defenders to beat Denis, who had lost his stick earlier when Calder collided with him. 
Eriksson ran his points string to four with his sixth goal, one under his career high. His shot from the left circle appeared to be redi­rected by Nash, who came into the game tied for the NHL lead in goals with 33. Nash was first credited with the goal before it was given to Eriksson after a review. Devils 8, Sabres 2 
Martin Brodeur became the first NHL goaltender to win 30 games in nine straight seasons and the New Jersey Devils made it easy for him. 
The Devils had their high­est-scoring game since October 2000 with a win over the Buffalo Sabres. 
Brodeur (30-17-1 0) had to make only 20 saves in moving ahead of recently retired Patrick Roy for consecutive 30-win seasons. 
The Devils won their third straight and moved within four points of first-place Philadelphia in the Atlantic Division. New Jersey has played two fewer games. 
The eight goals were their most since beating Montreal 8-4 on Oct. 6, 2000. Their previous high this season was seven against the Rangers last Saturday. 
Patrik Elias, Jay Pandolfo and Brian Gionta scored twice apiece, while Brian Rafalski and Jeff Friesen also scored. 
Elias added three assists. In the last three games, he has a team record six goals and five assists for 11 points.

NFL 
Jamal Lewis indicted on federal drug charges 

Associated Press 
ATLANTA Baltimore Havens running back Jamal Lewis, who had the second­highest rushing total in NFL history last season, was indicted Wednesday on federal drug charges. 
The Atlanta native is accused of trying to help a childhood friend buy cocaine in the sum­mer of 2000 -just before he signed a six-year, $35.3 million contract with the Havens. 
No drugs were ever pur­chased, according to the indict­ment. 
The running back's attorney, Ed Garland, said his client was innocent and would turn him­self.in on Thursday. 
"Mr. Lewis wants everybody to know that he did nothing wrong," Garland said. "He was not part of any drug deal and any contention that he was is false."

Lewis is charged with con­spiring to possess with the intent to distribute 5 kilograms of cocaine and using a cell phone in the commission of the first count, according to U.S. Attorney William Duffey. 
The indictment came out of a drug investigation that has led to 30 convictions and helped dismantle a cocaine-trafficking ring in the city, Duffey said. He refused to say whether Lewis was tied to that drug ring. 
In an affidavit, FBI special agent Hoyt Mahaley said that an informant contacted Lewis on his cell phone on June 23, 2000, to discuss selling cocaine to Lewis' friend. The conversa­tion was recorded, according to the agent. 
"The cooperating source told Lewis that he/she was willing to sell the narcotics to Lewis' asso­ciates for a price that Lewis can tax," meaning the price could be marked up for a profit,

Mahaley said in the arlidavit. "Lewis responded 'Yeah,"' the agent said. 
Hours after the call, Lewis and the friend. Angelo Jackson. met with the informant at an Atlanta restaurant, the aflidavit said. There, Lewis and Jackson asked the informant how much cocaine the informant was capable of distributing, the am­davit alleges. 
Jackson and the informant met again on July 12, 2000, at a gas station in suburban Atlanta, the affidavit said. During the meeting, they discussed drugs, but no purchase was made. 
Lewis wasn't at the gas sta­tion. Ilis attorney, however, said Lewis was at the restaurant, but not for the reason alleged in the indictment.

A freshman versus senior matchup followed as off-campus senior Mark Pfizenmayer faced Alumni freshman Kevin "K­Mart" Martin. Pfizenmayer won in a unanimous decision. 
Ed "Eddie Money" Liva, a sophomore from Dillon Hall, faced off against off-campus sen­ior Matt Welsh in the next bout of the night. Welsh was the taller opponent with a longer reach, but Liva emerged victorious in a unanimous decision. 
The third freshman-senior bat­tle of the night took place next with the elder Chip Marks meet­ing Will McAuliffe. Marks, an off­campus senior, won in a unani­mous decision over the Keenan freshman McAuliffe.

Rehmann will face Alumni senior Corey Harkins in the next round. 
155-pound division

Hagan will continue on to fight O'Neill junior Nathan Lohmeyer in the quarterfinals of the tournament. 
A unanimous decision in the Mike Peters versus Sean Tucker matchup disguised how close the fight between the two competitors actually was. Tucker, a senior from Keenan Hall, won the match by a few punches after dominating the first round. 
Peters, a sophomore from Knott Hall, looked to make a comeback in the following two rounds, even after getting knocked down midway through the second, but he ran out of time at the end. Tucker will be up against Mark Basola next. 
Siegfried senior Ted Volz dominated his bloody match against Alumni sophomore Mike Rooney with his constant strong jabs.

Adam Burns, a freshman from Zahm, defeated Mike Gigante of Stanford in a one­sided, decisive match. Although he lacked the finesse of some of the older fighters, Burns came out strong and barely let Gigante get a shot off at all. 
With Gigante struggling, the referee stopped the bout early and Burns came out victorious. Burns will face Brandon Gasser in the next round.

MEN'S TENNIS 
Irish ready to face undefeated Illini 
Defending national champion and No. 1 Illini host "Ace the Irish" night 
By KATE GALES 
Sports Writer 
On paper, the Irish look to be in for a fight. 
Notre Dame has the task of taking on the defending nation­al champions Illinois, who are undefeated at 10-0 on the sea­son. 
The Irish will also have to travel to Champaign, Ill. to face the Illini, where they have not lost a match since 2002 at the hands of the Irish. 
Illinois looks to be pumping up for the matchup with Notre Dame; the lllini are sponsoring "Ace the Irish" night, during which fans will have the chance to win raffles every time the Illini ace a serve. 
The Illinois pep band will also be on hand for the contest. 

The No. 1 Illini boast five ranked players, led by senior Phil Stolt at No. 20. 
The No. 42 Irish played through multiple injuries last weekend, pulling out 5-2 wins over Northwestern and Southern Methodist. Senior Luis Haddock is doubtful for today's match with a pulled groin, and junior Brent D'Amico has had shin splints since the weekend's matches. Freshman Barry King was unable to play singles last weekend because of a sore arm. 
Head coach Bobby Bayliss has been reworking the dou­bles combinations, looking for the most potent combination of individual talents. 
Despite theng of players due to injury, the match should be a way to assess the team's progress. 
The Illini have won 42 straight games and are three wins away from the national record, set by Stanford.

The Irish bench also added 40 points, while the Hurricanes bench scored just two. Notre Dame is now 12-0 at home this season.

Providence, Pittsburgh or Seton Hall. But it wasn't. 
The Irish blew out a top-25 team that had only four losses coming into the game, with none of those losses coming by more than nine points. Miami was tied for fourth in the Big East, but that changed the minute they set foot on the court of the Joyce Center. 
Notre Dame ran circles around No. 21 Miami. Senior Chanivia Broussard, who aver­ages 14.6 points per game, turned the ball over 13 times, while junior point guard Yalonda McCormick turned it over 10 times. Talk about dou­ble-doubles. 
Meanwhile, Irish junior Jacqueline Batteast had a dou­ble-double of her own with 23 points and 10 rebounds, in addition to mention six steals. 
Notre Dame did what they had to do to win and more. They beat a good Miami team at their own game, as the Irish were the ones scoring in transi­tion for most of the contest. 
Everyone was in on the action, unlike the Connecticut game when Batteast took over the game. Instead, everyone with a Notre Dame jersey on made a significant impact on the court. It was the epitome of a team win. 
Even the Joyce Center crowd didn't know what to think of the blowout -they just watched in awe as the Irish kept building a greater lead. 
But for Notre Dame, it could­n't come at a better time. After

coming off a tough road stretch that saw the Irish play down to the level of their opponents (they only beat Pittsburgh, who is 2-12 Big East, by four). Notre Dame couldn't have picked a better time to play like they know they can. 
So with two regular season Big East games remaining before the conference tourna­ment, the Irish hope that their intensity and desire can carry over to the road Saturday at Rutgers. And, now that they 

·know how to play their game, Notre Dame should have no problem making a good show­ing in their final games. 
It just took them 93 points to realize what they can do.

Blown away 
Irish offense bowls over -No. 21 Hurricanes 93-58 
ByJOE HETTLER Sports Editor 

The Hurricanes were in the eye of an Irish storm Wednesday night. 
When Katy Flecky drained a free throw with 2:23 remain­ing, Notre Dame led by its biggest margin of the game ­40 points -and Miami's play­ers could only look on in dis­belief as the Irish blew out the Hurricanes 93-58 at the Joyce Center. 
Irish forward Jacqueline Batteast led the Irish (18-8, 11-3) with 23 points and 10 rebounds, and Courtney LaVere added 13 bench points on 6-of-7 shooting to lead Notre Dame to its best per­formance of the seasorL 
''I'm really pleased. I think that's maybe the best game we've played all year," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "I thought we came out ready, start to finish, for 40 minutes and played great on both ends of the floor. I was really pleased with the intensity and the focus." 
Miami entered Wednesday's game averaging over 7 4 points per game and had won four straight. But the Hurricanes (20-5, 9-5) had no answers for a stifling Irish defense that forced 37 turnovers and held Miami under 60 points for the second time this season. 
"We expected them to turn the ball over a lot," McGraw said. "I thought they had a lot of trouble against the zone." 
Miami forward Chanivia Broussard lead the Hurricanes with 13 turnovers, which is a new record for an individual opposing player. Hurricane forward Yalonda McCormick added 10 turnovers and 16 points. Guard Tamara James lead the Hurricanes with 17 points, but made just 1-of-8 3­pointers. 
Meanwhile, Notre Dame's offense exploded for 93 points -the largest output of the season. Coming into the game, the Irish averaged 65.2 points per contest. Notre Dame guard Monique Hernandez scored 10 points on 4-of-7 shooting and Megan Duffy hit all three of her 3-point attempts to add 10 
more.  Every player  on  the  
Irish  bench  scored  in  the  
game.  

Notre Dame never trailed and went on a 37-22 run­after leading 8-7 -to take a 45-29 halftime lead. Batteast had 13 first half points. while Jeneka Joyce added eight points with two 3-pointers. 
Notre Dame began the sec­ond half by scoring seven of

couldn't do right. 

The Irish forced 37 turnovers and held the usually fast breaking Hurricanes to four points on the break. 
But that wasn't the most staggering statistic. Notre Dame's bench scored almost as many points as the entire Miami team, dropping 40 to Miami's two. 
Wednesday night was an indication -an indication of just how good this team can be. The Irish first gave a glimpse Jan. 13 when they beat then-No. 4 Connecticut. 
And, against Miami, Notre Dame was not to be stopped. They shot a staggering 57.9 percent and put up 93 points -35 more than the Hurricanes.

'Doctor' Dolan lands unanimous decision 
By ANNIE BRUSKY Sports Writer 

The 153--pound division got under way with off-campus senior Matthew "Chainsaw" Jensen against Dillon sopho­more Michael "Doctor" Dolan. Dolan defeated his upperclass opponent by unanimous deci­sion. 
After an exciting preliminary match in the 153-pound divi­sion, Nate Schomas, a senior from O'Neill, defeated Brad Amiri, a junior from Alumni, in a unanimous decision. 
Both competitors came out of the gates swinging and throw­ing many punches, but Schomas' relentless attacks and fast flurries were too much for Amiri, who seemed to tire toward the end of the fight. Schomas, a football walk-on, will go on to face Bobby Gorynski in the quarter­finals Monday. 
Senior Don Zimmer dominat­ed his match against Brian Garcia from beginning to end, causin~ the referee to end the bout early. 
Although Garcia, a sopho­more from Sorin, had an obvi­ous reach advantage, Zimmer was able to control the ring well and get inside. Once inside, Zimmer stunned his opponent with strong combina­tion after strong combination
