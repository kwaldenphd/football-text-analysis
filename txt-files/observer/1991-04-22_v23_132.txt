Kurdish leaders in Baghdad try to negotiate a peaceful settlement 
IlEBEL IIEAI>QUAHTEHS, Northern Iraq (AI') -Leaders of four Kurdish groups are in Baghdad trying to negotiate a peaeeful settlement to the nd>ellion against Saddam llussein. n~bnl sources said Saturday. 
The talks started Friday after Saddarn nxpressnd readiness "to discuss everything with the Kurdish sidn exenpt secession." said one source close to the Kurdish l1~adership. All of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity. 
The Kurds had bnen reluctant to rwgotiatn. fearing Saddam would n~nege on any agreement once his government recovered from its shattering defeat in Kuwait. 
But a spokesman for one Kurdish group said rebel lead­ers were spurred to act by the plight of hundreds of thousands of Kurdish refugees who are struggling against cold, hunger and disease in the mountains bordering Turkey and Iran. 
The refugees flnd their homes in northern Iraq when Saddam's forces crushed the n~bel uprising, which began after Iraq lost the Gulf War. 
The United States and other Wnstorn nations are sending troops into nortlwrn Iraq to build camps for the Kurdish rl'fugees and proteet them from tlw Iraqi army. But thn allies madn dear they would not in­tnrvnrw to help tlw Kurds' re­lwllion, and Kurdish lnaders havP conceded thny could not toppl1~ Saddam without foreign lwlp. 

A rnbel souree said the lead­ers w1mt to Baghdad after con­sulting with the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -the United States. Britain, France, China and the Soviet Union. 
"They were asked whether they would be prepared to guarantee any agreements reaehed with Saddam and some have already agreed to do so," the source said. The source would not give any specific de­tails. 
A U.S. diplomat at the United Nations. who also spoke on condition of anonymity. said she was unaware of any discus­sions with the Kurds in New York. But she said the perma­nent members had a regularly scheduled meeting Monday and that the Kurdish situation had been a prominent topic in their recent meetings. 
The White House said Saturday it had no knowledge of the meeting in Baghdad, but did not object to talks that might lead to a peaceful return for the refugees. 
"If the Kurds are able to work out an arrangement for their safe return, then obviously we would weleome such a development," White House spokesman .John Herrick said. 
Fedak el-Deen Kaka'a, a spokesman for the Kurdistan Democratic Party in Damascus, Syria. said the trip followed meetings between the Kurdish groups and a delegation from the Iraqi government. 
lie said the Kurdish leaders included Jalal Talabani of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, Mateheervan Barzani of the Kurdish Democratic Party. Sami Abdul-Hahman of the People's Party of Kurdistan and Hasoul Mamend of the Kurdish Socialist Party. 
Talabani, who negotiated a cease-lire with Saddam to end unrest in 1984, was the only man not granted amnesty by the Iraqi president following Saddam's 1988 campaign against the ethnic group. 
The Kurds' main demand is full respect for a 1970 agree­ment granting them full auton­omy in their region. The leaders also want a truly democratic and pluralistic political system in Iraq and an end to the dictatorship of Saddam's Arab Socialist Baath Party, sources said. 


ND soph to attend honors program 
By Natasha Wilson 
News Writer 
When the semester ends, Notre Dame sophomore Roman Rubio will relax with a few bi­ology and medical books this summer. 
Rubio will attend the Honors 
Pre-Medical Academy at the 
Baylor College of Medieine and 
Rice University in Houston. 
More than 100 college sophomores and juniors will participate in the six-week pro­gram which seeks to increase minority representation in medicine. 
Rubio, who lives in Mesquite, Texas, a Dallas suburb, selected the Baylor/Rice program from the six medical schools across the nation that host the Pre­Medical Academy. 
The program, which is funded partly by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, covers all tuition and housing costs and provides a stipend for participants. 
Rubio, a biology and anthro­pology major, will take an up­per level biology course and a technical writing course at Rice. He also will have an internship at Baylor. The nine credits from the summer courses will transfer to Notre Dame. 
The Academy's participants may choose either a clinical or a research internship. "I chose clinical, because I like working with people more than being in the lab (where) you don't have much contaet with people," he says. 
Rubio requested an internship in reconstructive surgery, be­cause he intends to specialize in that field after medical school, lw says. lie dons not know if lw will receive his first internship choice. !lis second and third choices are internships in ob­stetrics and urology. 
"The program is suppos1~d to help create a more well­rounded (nwdical school) appli­cant and to help prepare you for the MCAT," the medical school entrance exam. says Hubio who plans to attend medical school at Southwestern Medical School. Duke University, or Baylor. 
"It's a good opportunity to look at Baylor Medical School. Since (the Academy) is a re­gional program, I'm hoping to meet a lot of people there who are considering the same medi­cal schools that I am...I should make some good contacts." 
The Pre-Medical Academy bP­gins the first week in June. Rubio will stay in a dorm at Riee. 
During the rest of the sum­mer. he plans to volunteer at a social service agency. lie also might work on a research pro­ject on arthritis at Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, he says. 
''I'd like to work with minori­ties when I get into mndieine. I like working with people. It's just the satisfaction you get helping people. I worked with hearing impaired children when I was in high school. To see someone so dependent on others and to be there for them is really rewarding. " 
The Cavanaugh Hall resident volunteers at Proyecto Madre (Project Mother), a social ser­vice organization that helps single parents in South Bend.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Hearing others is as important as being heard 
I have been described as 
being "non-con­frontational." I can't decide whether or not this is good or bad. 
I guess it could be good in the sense that it means I let things blow over and 

not let them get under my Ann Marie Hartman skin. 
I can't imagine how long Assistant News Editor a day would seem if everY-----,----­time something bothered me I flew off the handle trying to rectify it. 
But being "non-confrontational" can be bad too. It implies that when something really does need to be said, I would rather go on being annoyed than face the core of the problem. 
This isn't a fair analysis of me, though. There have been numerous times when I thought I might explode if I didn't tackle the problem at hand. 
So, when these occasions do arise I stand up to whatever it is and say my peace. 
I guess the "non-confrontational" side of me comes when I count the number of times I decided to bite my tongue out of fear o alienating the object of my suggestions. 
I have come to realize that there is a limit to what we can change and a great deal that we, as students, as humans, must accept. 
When one accepts something, it is not an admission of defeat. It is simply an ac­knowledgment that something is the way it is. We then have to learn to work with what we have in recognition of the subject's boundaries. 
I'm not sure if I'm making sense. I guess there are things in life that we (people in general) would like to see a certain way-kind of the "my way" syndrome-and if it's not that way, we chalk it up on life's board of "wrongs." 
We forget what it means to compromise and we dismiss the idea that there is another side to every issue. 
For the most part when one opposes someone else, there are good reasons for doing so. Rea­sons that are worthy of consideration, reasons that might encourage us at least to reevaluate our stance. 
When something is really important to me, there isn't much that I won't do to see that it is taken care of. Sometimes I become so wrapped up in what I'm doing that I lose track of what my ultimate goal is and I end up turning off the people I was trying to win over to begin with. 
In addition to losing my audience, I alienate all those who did back my position when my quest for support began. 
So in the end, all that I am left with is an unconvinced audience, fleeing supporters, and personal confusion over what I was trying to prove in the first place. 
After all this, the point I'm trying to make is that no matter what the issue is, be it a conflict with parents or a personal adversity with a college administration-assume the position of "semi-confrontational"-make your complaint known, but be willing to hear out the other side.

WORLD Baker inspects damage in Kuwait 
.JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia 
Secretary of State James Baker III 
taking a detour from his troubled Mideast mission to inspect Kuwait slow-paced political reform and lingering wartime havoc. Baker planned to inspect burning oil fields and confer with the Emir Jabir al­Ahmed Sabah and Crown Prince Saad Abdullah al Sabah after a report last week by Amnesty International that human rights abuses, including torture and executions, had swept Kuwait since it was liberated in February. Baker's staff, in announcing the visit, stressed the economic side of the visit rather than the human rights aspect to avoid embarrassing the rulers. Afterward, Baker was flying to Damascus to discuss prospects for Mideast negotiations with Syrian President Hafez Assad and Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa, completing his tour of five Arab countries.

NATIONAL Naming rape victims causes debate 
• RALEIGH, N.C. -The issue of publishing rape victims' names was the subject of intense debate this week after several news organizations disclosed the identity of a woman who alleges she was raped by William Kennedy Smith, the nephew of Sen.

The woman's name first appeared April 7 in The Sunday Mirror, a British tabloid. The publisher of a newspaper that has printed rape victims' names for 20 years predicted more publications will begin to do so

from Indiana University. He joined the Notre Dame faculty in 1973 and became tenured associate professor of English in 1976. 
Krier served three years as co-director of the joint under­graduate honors program, in which he worked with a com­mittee to enhance its curricu­lum. Previously, he served six years as director of under­graduate studies in the English department, and he is now co­director of the concentration in film and cultural studies. In addition, he served on a com­mittee that helped revise the Arts and Letters Core course syllabus and on the College of Arts and Letters Council. 
In his teaching of literary works and film, Krier empha­sizes showing students the method of analyzing a work, rather than simply getting them to memorize and repeat factual material. 
"One student told me he found the work of analyzing a novel was easy. that anyone could do it," he recalls. "That's someone who's been success­fully taught. He can now pick up a novel, interpret it, and en­joy it. All it takes is basic intel­ligence and some basic train­ing." 
Krier says he is a teacher be­cause he wants to return what he has received from his own teachers. "It's nice to make a living creating more, rather than using up more," he says. "I also teach because I like to think. And that's a good fit for my personality, since I like to sit and think." 
Teaching also energizes him. "Once you get students to think for themselves, they're an overwhelming source of en­ergy." 
A major change in Krier's approach to teaching came when he first taught in the Arts and Letters Core Course, a year-long seminar taken by all sophomores in the college. 
"Before I taught Core, I was part of the star system, lectur­ing to 30 to 70 students and thinking that to be a good teacher meant being a good lecturer. When I began in Core, I didn't know how to keep silent and let the students talk. Once I did, I've come to enjoy teach­ing much more." 
Teaching Core also affected his lecture courses, he says. ''I've totally restructured what I'm going to say since I've learned a much different way of relating to students. I used to start by building a series or questions, then answering them at the end. Now I start by giv­ing all the answers I have so we know where we're going right away." 
"Then the focus is on how we're going get there, or even whether that's a place worth going," Krier added. "By fo­cusing on method over simple content. everybody contributes to the class, and I'm no longer in control over the mystery of knowledge." 
"I hope my students can go out of class convinced they can do things they couldn't do be­fore." 

Seminar. planned for NO faculty 
Special to The Observer 
A one-day seminar for Notre Dame, Holy Cross Junior College, and Saint Mary's College faculty is being planned for next January in order to in­troduce the community to new instructional tools soon to be available in the DeBartolo Classroom Facility, which opens in the fall of 1992. 
The Jan. 10 seminar, "A new environment for teaching and learning; DeBartolo & Beyond," will focus on the new technologies, how they might be incorporated into the curriculum, and what Notre Dame resources are available to faculty. 
The seminar will offer an ex­hibit area and a series of for­mal presentations. Faculty from other colleges and univer­sities representing a variety of disciplines will demonstrate their finished courseware pro­jects and share their objectives, process, and outcomes of tech­nology integration. 
Demonstrations of the DeBartolo data/video delivery system also will be included. 
All Notre Dame, Holy Cross and Saint Mary's faculty and their teaching assistants are invited to attend. Invitations will be mailed in early November. Registration dead­line is Dec. 9.

Dan Quayle feels Saddam ought to be prosecuted 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Vice President Dan Quayle said Sunday it might be a good idea to prosecute Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for war crimes. 
"You can't rule it out," Quayle said on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press." 
"Perhaps this would be a good idea," he said. "One of the questions is . . . who is going to go in and arrest Saddam Hussein once the ... crimes are alleged?" 
As to trying Saddam in ab­sentia, Quayle said: "It's an idea that is kicking around, and it's certainly worth discussing. But I have no announcement on that this morning." 
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," predicted the Iraqi leader "will eventually be re­placed," but said that for the present "he still has the only organized military force left" in his country. 
Both Quayle and Cheney reit­erated administration assur­ances that U.S. troops setting up refugee camps for fleeing Kurdish rebels will remain in Iraq for only a limited time. 

Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, 

U.N. executive delegate for Iraqi and relief, said on "Meet the Press" that the U.S. opera­tion "is a very limited one in terms of the time frame -like maybe 60 days or whatever." 
Quayle declined to specify a time period, but said the United States has "no desire to be

Police quell school riot 
Students leaving Lauzinger High School cast glances at Los Angeles County Sheriff's officers and officers from neighboring jurisdictions who responded to a series of fights at the school in Lawndale, California. Up to 250 students reportedly were involved in the fighting. 
Protesters of Pope are arrested 
ROME (AP)-Four protesters who heckled Pope John Paul II during a university appearance were held Saturday in a Rome prison for investigation by an anti-terrorist unit, police said. 
The protesters were arrested Friday on charges of resisting public officials and showing contempt for a foreign head of state. The pope heads the Vatican, an independent state in Rome that is the seat of the government of the Roman Catholic Church. 
A small group of protesters opposed to the pope's stand against the use of artificial birth control shouted and whis­tled at him as he spoke to stu­dents Friday outside Rome's La Sapienza University. 
The Italian news agency ANSA said the four were under investigation by the DIGOS, the anti-terrorist police squad. The squad's office confirmed the in­vestigation but refused to say if the four were suspected of any terrorist links. 
An official, speaking on con­dition of anonymity, said the four were Italian but refused to identify them by name. 
State television reported Friday that the protesters were not students at the university. 
During the pope's appear­ance, several of them held a banner that read: "Love one another but with contracep­tion." 
The Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, said the banner was "without any cul­tural content or dignity, clearly showing what kind of young people that little group was."

there on a long-term, perma­nent basis." 
Cheney said the same, but added that "for right now, over the next few weeks, only the 
U.S. military has the capability to rescue those people and pro­vide what they need in a very remote part of the world." 
He said the operation would be turned over to an interna­tional organization such as the United Nations or Red Cross as soon as possible. 
Prince Sadruddin said the 
United Nations and United States "are not working at cross purposes," in the relief effort. "We are not on a colli­sion course." 
Cheney said there had been no confrontation with Iraqis, who he said have "actually helped our people in some cases, in terms of identifying places where mines were located." 
"We have to be on guard, but at this point everything's going very well," he said.

U.S. corporations focus on Total Quality Management 
By JEFF CABOTAJE 
News Writer 
Major U.S. corporations have selectnd Total Quality Manage­ment as a major focus in thnir management effort, said Bob King Friday. 
King, executive director of GOAIJQPC (one of the nation's lnading research organizations on Total Quality Management or TQMI defined TQM as "all employees and all departments everyday improving or main­taining their own jobs and tasks in all variations in quality, yield, cost. procedures, and systems to give customers products that are most economic and best qualified." 
King discussed the growing trend of U.S. corporations to approach a fundamental shift in management by combining the power of American innovation with the discipline of Japanese TQM in his h1cture, "Integrating Japanese TQM and American Innovation." 
There are four major systems in TQM, said King. 
King explained the first sys­tem, Daily Management, as "the actions taken every day to en­sure that tasks are done in the way they were intended and im­proved at every opportunity to meet customer expectations." 
The next, Hoshin Planning, is a system "to identify key break­through items and to enable all employees to contribute to or­ganization improvement, figur­ing out how to make the orga­nization better." 
Quality Function Deployment 
From riches to rags: politician sleeps in shelter 
WASHINGTON (API -John King, whose slash-and-burn style of politics carried him to the top of the Hepublican Party in Wnst Virginia, dneided to break into the big time in the nation's capital. 
lie Pnded up out on thn street amongst muggers and thinves. shHlping at night in a shelter for llw lwnwlnss. 
The 40-year-old former state Hnpubliean leadnr told The Washington Post he came to Washington in 1988. lie started Palladin Consulting, a small op­eration that he made look big through post office boxes, fancy letterheads and "a little smoke and mirrors." 
But King said his intense per­sonality and undiplomatic style were bad for business. Early last year, it all but drind up and by August he was putting out resumes. 
By October, his money had run out and he was evicted from his $725-a-month apart­nwnt. 
At the homeless shelter, thny called him the professor be­cause he came in wearing a three-piece suit. lie stayed in a small, doorless cubicle with several other men, slept on an Army eot, ate when he was given food, woke up when he was told to. 
Night after night, his com­panions talked about drugs, robberies and prison. One had been convicted of slitting a woman's throat and discussed techniques for using a straight razor. 
Ashamed of failure, he stayed away from friends and rela­tives. 
"I couldn't face it. I became everything I had loathed all my life," he said. 
Finally, he became fed up with the shelters and turned to friends. He cleaned himself up, started seeing a therapist and now is looking for work. 
"I wanted to be Henry Thoreau as a kid," he told the Post. "I ended up being George Patton with a little Marquis de Sade thrown in for character." 
In his political ascendancy, he says he saw himself as a West Virginia version of Lee Atwater, the late Republican Party chairman who helped candi­dates with campaigns eriticized for emphasizing negative points.

provides a "tool for under­standing what customers want and putting that into place; for prioritizing customer needs; and for communicating the pri­orities." 
Customer Driven Master Plan is a "plan of orchestrating the change from a departmental­ized approach from a few peo­ple involved in improvement to everybody being involved in im­provement." 
"It (TQM) is a buzzword, and consultants are taking their training materials, pulling off the cover page, and putting TQM on it because it is such a hot subject today," said King. 
The transition from a tradi­tional kind of organization to a TQM organization takes about five years, he said. 
The first step an organization 
Back to Business 
must take is to decide to do TQM. Once that is done, cus­tomer focus must be estab­lished, King said. 
Next, the ten or twelve key processes that make a differ­ence in the organization's suc­cess must be identified and de­fined. Initial teams must be formed to focus on customer needs and the critical key pro­cesses. 
These four steps, along with developing a five-year plan, takes one to three years in most organizations, noted King.

Large corporations, such as Motorola, Xerox, Ford, and American Express, have now become involved in helping deans of business schools to educate students in TQM. 
"Major corporations believe so much that this (TQM) is the way they want to run their or­ganization. that they are mak­ing this effort to introduce this into the business schools," King stated. "Since American indus­try is moving in the direction of TQM, the feeling is that academia needed to get in­volved."

Credit easing halted in midst of dispute 
WASHINGTON (API -The Federal Reserve, struggling with an unusually sharp policy split in its own ranks, has tem­porarily halted credit easing, analysts said Friday, despite pressure from the Bush admin­istration to push interest rates lower to end the recession. 
The change, economists said, is not likely to abort what most believe will be an economic re­covery beginning in June or July. But some analysts worried that the central bank, if it does not ease further, will hurt chances for robust growth in the upcoming expansion. 
The policy debate also could have a political fallout. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is still considered the odds-on favorite to win renomination when his term expires in August. If he is un­able to win further interest rate cuts, however, his chances could nose dive, analysts said. 
"This whole dispute doesn't mean that Greenspan has lost control at the Fed," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey Lanston & Co. of New York. "But it does mean that the Fed's easing will be delayed and if it is delayed too long, it eould snuff out any budding re­covery." 
With President Bush and his aides voicing the need for lower interest rates, Jones said, the White House may be "miffed" enough by Greenspan's inability to win a board majority for further cuts that Bush will not tap him for another four-year term as chairman. 
Other economists, however, said there is no credible candi­date on the horizon to take over from Greenspan and therefore they rated the chances that he would be ousted as extremely low. 
Whatever the impact on Greenspan's future, the current policy debate has put a spot­light on the normally secretive Federal Reserve. A spate of front page stories in the last two weeks has revealed a tense debate on the Fed's key policy­making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee. The FOMC includes Fed board members in Washington and five of the 12 regional Fed bank presidents. 
The disagreement, first re­vealed in a newsletter published by former Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson. shows an FOMC sharply divided between a camp led by Greenspan that is seeking further interest rate cuts and another camp, composed primarily of the regional bank presidents, that fears any further easing will worsen in­flationary pressures in the up­coming recovery. 
Fed officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, gave the following account of events: 
The debate surfaced Feb. 1, when some members of the FOMC questioned whether Greenspan had the authority acting alone to push the federal funds rate down by one-half percentage point to accompany a one-half point eut in the dis­count rate. 
The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, is controlled by the FOMC while changes in the discount rate, the interest the Fed charges for bank loans, is set by the seven Fed governors in Washington. 
Greenspan cut the funds rate but agreed to bring the matter of his authority up at the next FOMC meeting Feb. 5. At that meeting, there was vigorous argument between the pro­growth "doves" on the board and the anti-inflation "hawks." 
The two sides asked the Fed's staff to research Greenspan's authority to change interest rates between FOMC meetings and report back at the March 26 session. 
At that session, Greenspan agreed to a compromise that commits him to greater consul­tation with other FOMC mem­bers before making interest rate cuts.

Letter about goose incident displayed discrimination 
Phelps deserves respect for his integrity 
curses, I extricated the ball with surgical precision by rolling another ball at it, avoiding injury in any way to the goose, whose life I was impelled to respect, despite its felonious behavior. 
I successfully rescued the ball to the delight of the young women. However, the unthink­ing audience presumed I meant to molest their mascot. Need­less to say, I was shocked to find my benevolent behavior vilified in print before my peers. 
Once again, discrimination has reared its ugly head on Our Lady's campus. I too have felt the stinging darts of prejudice, and I too, cry out for the common respect that is my due. 
I care not for my own person, but I am gravely distraught that this asinine behavior could harm some of my brothers and sisterss here on campus, I here by call all decent, upstanding members of the Notre Dame family to actively combat prejudice in all its malicious manifestations across the land.

Dear Editor: 
I am writing to clear my name of the shame and evil which have been placed upon it by certain malicious, shortsighted individuals in your newspaper. I, a proverbial Good Samaritan, victimized by discrimination feel it my moral obligation to correct the grave injustice. 
I speak, of course, of the in­cident that has galvanized this community: The Grace Hall Goose Incident, the Fight with the Fowl, the Duel with the Duck. On Monday, April 8, at 
10:30 p.m., my female compan­ions and I were exiting Grace Hall. We were suddenly alerted to a pair of damsels in distress, two young women who beck­oned me to recover their basketball which have been kidnapped by the aforementioned waterfowl, who was guarding it jealously. I immediately realized it was my Christian duty to help my fellow human beings, no matter how formidable the hissing and flapping goose appeared, and I rushed to rescue the basketball. 
At this point I was pelted by a barrage of heckles and jeers from the denizens of Grace Hall, who feared that their goose was cooked. Shutting out their

Dear Editor: 

I am joined, I hope, by a size­able group of people here at the University of Notre Dame in regretting the ending of Richard Phelps' tenure as basketball coach. While everyone is quick to pounce on his deficiencies and his last, lackluster season, everyone should be equally quick to remember his exem­plary record as a coach utterly beyond reproach when it came to the honesty and integrity of his program. 
I am in a position to know a little of the inner workings of the basketball program. I was employed there for two and a half years. I took great pride each day, while watching the evening news detail the viola­tions of yet another college sports program, in knowing that the program for which I worked could stand up to the closest scrutiny. Working, as I did, with recruiting, I can assure everyone that not a single move was ever taken toward a high school ballplayer without checking and rechecking the rule books, even calling the NCAA offices in Kansas City if there were any questions of in­terpretation. Coach Phelps' commitment to honesty in re­cruiting was rock-solid. 
I can also assure you that his emphasis on preparing his play­ers for "the real world" came from his honestly-held beliefs that basketball glory was, at best, ephemeral. Digger made a lifetime contract with the young men he brought to this university. Upon their gradu­ation, he promised, they would be ready for the rest of their lives-whatever that future might hold. 
Very few college athletes will leave school loving their coach, and, by and large, that's the way it should be. Coach Phelps' athletes, however, will find their respect for what he taught them, by example as well as words, growing as the years go by. That is where Digger's true greatness lies. He has always looked beyond the immediate gratification of winning to his perception of his role as an ed­ucator. He would be glad to be remembered more as an in­structor of young men than as a "war chief." Take a good look at what Digger's former athletes are doing today. The list is in the media guide. Compare that list with a similar one for any other coach. The record speaks for itself. 
No, he's certainly not perfect. Twenty years of having your every word analyzed and quoted does strange things to a man. It stretches many things far out of proportion. 
But, in the final analysis, Dig­ger hasn't asked anything of his athletes that he hasn't asked of himself. The physical toll this takes on a 49-year-old man is much greater than that on an 18-year-old. He has earned his retirement, if he really desires one, and he can certainly be proud of the fact that those young men who resided, however briefly, under his guidance have received something of value from his basketball program, whether or not they ever have the insight to realize it. 
Let's not make the mistake of letting Coach Phelps leave with­out our thanks and respect. He could have been Jim Valvano­but would we have wanted him to?

Student thanks Digger for his accomplishments 
Editor's note:The following is an open letter to Digger Phelps: 
I want to thank you for the things you've done here at Notre Dame during the last twenty years. We may not have won as many games recently as we all would have liked, but on the whole, the teams have done fairly well. More importantly, you were true to what this University is all about. You graduated all your players. 
During the Phelps era student-athletes were students first and athletes second. Also, you ran a clean program without any hint of the scandals so prevalent in "the business." But clearly you viewed the young men you worked with as more than commodities or instruments; you treated them as men. 
I hope that, in looking back over your career, people 
GARRY TRUDEAU 
remember not only your win­loss percentage but also the graduation rate of your players, the fact that you avoided foul play, the opinion of your peers and your treatment of those you worked with.Good luck in your future endeavors and thank you for what you have done.

Catholic tradition should not overshadow social, cultural concerns 
Dear Editor: 
The first part of Professor Charles Hice's two-part column on the commitment of the University to its undergraduate student body is a good step to­wards showing how we, as stu­dl~nts, are being exploited so that the University can pursue "greatness' as a research institution. 
But when, in the second installment, Professor Hice ties the University's increased commitment to "greatness" with the agenda of the "politically correct," his argument drifts and loses its force. 
As he points out, since 1967, Catholic universities have strived for a "true autonomy and academic freedom in the faen of authority of any kind." A necessary part of that freedom is the right to study texts, whether they be books, films, or any other form of media, whose content may be in some way construed as "inimical" to the Catholic mission. The issue at hand is not whether such films are any good; the citation of Michael Medved's opinion of "Cook, Thief, Wife, Lover" as "putrid, pointless, and pretentious," itself a debatable statement, is irrelevant to the issue of access to such material in a free and open sodety. Does the Suite show these films to be politically correct, to avoid "being considered narrow­minded because it is Catholic"? 
Are we talking about the same open-minded Catholic Church that took a few centuries before officially admitting it was wrong to persecute Galileo, which turned the man who led the burning of the Alexandrian Library into a saint (admittedly, not for that alone) and which still keeps an index of forbidden material? 
That kind of Catholic Church, the kind that sees anything not in complete agreement as "objectively wrong," seems to be suggested when Professor Rice drags the issue of homosexuality into the debate. "The University commendably refuses to officially recognize homosexual groups on campus. The University also rightly emphasizes that the objective wrongness of homosexuality does not warrant unjust discrimination against persons who may have homosexual tendencies." It seems to me that by refusing to recognize them as a group, the Administration is unjustly discriminating against homosexuals. The University can very well suggest that homosexuals refrain from sexual relations, just as it can suggest that heterosexuals refrain from pre-marital sex, but such suggestions are not incompatible with the right of the homosexual community to be recognized by the Administration. 
Hinting that the reason Notre Dame continues its discrimina­tory policy is a concern for the health of homosexual students, in addition to perpetuating the fallacy that AIDS is essentially a "gay disease," further obscures the real issues at stake. "The duty of others to exercise toler­ance and compassion," is not linked to political correctness. It's the right thing to do. 
The historic mission of this university may be "the education of students in the 
Catholic tradition." However, we have to recognize that many of our students do not come to Notre Dame for the express purpose of "service to the community and the Church." Some of us come here for a well-rounded secular nducation. And while there can be no harm in exposing such students to the Catholic tradition. such tradition should not be given dominance over the legitimate social, political and cultural concerns which get lumped under the buzzword "politically correct." If Notre Damn is going to be anything more than a glorified parochial school, we must be allowed to exercise autonomy and freedom in our academic lives.

Ismail won't g·et nearly as much publicity playing in the CFL as he would in the NFL, but he said that wasn't a major concern.

ND Lacrosse team wins one, loses another 
By DAVE DIETEMAN 
Sports Editor 
Up and down_ Hollercoaster. See-saw. 
Call it what you want, but no terms can change the fact that this season has been fickle to the Notre Dame lacrosse team. 
The Irish, 5-6, came into Saturday's contest with the Battling Bishops of Ohio Wesleyan on the heels of a 13-7 road win over the Wooster Fighting Scots. The same Irish, however. left Moose Krause Stadium saddled with a 14-9 defeat. Furthermore, the loss to Wesleyan was the fifth time this season that Notre Dame has missed its bid to win two consecutive games. 
Yet the topsy-turvy character of the season hasn't shifted the day-to-day focus of Irish coach Kevin Corrigan. 
''I'm worried about our next game, not about making the tournament," said Corrigan. "There was no fault with our effort today. I'm just looking for better execution than we got

today. Too many things happened that shouldn't have-like seven or eight of their goals. There were things we did wrong and offensively, we were too timid." 
Perhaps ironically, it was Notre Dame who opened the day's scoring, as midfielder Chris Nelson, while falling down, skipped a shot into the Wesleyan net with only 4:31 elapsed in the first quarter. 
The Bishops quickly evened the affair on a man-up goal by midfielder Tom Mott, which came just two minutes after Nelson's score_ 
Ohio Wesleyan scored again to climb on top 2-1, only to see John Capano tie the game up :36 later with the first of his two goals.

2. Yet true to the schizophrenic nature of Notre Dame's season to date, this was to be the last Irish goal for nearly 16 minutes. 
"We were too willing to let them dictate our offense," observed Corril!an. "That's 
what happens when you play good teams. We've been too willing to give our second-best effort against good teams." 
By the time attacker Mike Sullivan broke the Notre Dame scoring drought with 9:11 left in the third quarter, Ohio Wesleyan was riding high atop a 7-4lead. 
Hich Franz pumped the Bishops' lead to 8-4 as he found net just :30 after Capano's goal. Two minutes later, Wesleyan midfielder Tom Hossi hit paydirt for a 9-4lead. 
Sullivan startnd the comeback on an unassisted goal with 
12:36 remaining. and kept it going with two more goals and an assist. Brian Schirf and Brian Mayglothing added key goals during the fourth quarter. 
"We did a lot of the little things that a team has got to do to win," remarked Corrigan, "but we just don't do them as consistently as we've gotta do to win. We'll just look at this game and say we let some goals get away. Hopefully, our execution will keep getting better."

ANAl IEIM, Calif. (AP) -Five Notre Dame players were drafted in the first four rounds of Sunday's NFL Draft. 
Irish star Chris Zorich went home to the Chicago Bears, while Iinemate Bob Dahl was picked up the Cincinnati Bengals. Bunning back Ricky Watters will join former Irish star Joe Montana in the 49ers organization. Raghib "Rocket" Ismail was selected by the Los Angeles Haiders, as the 1OOth pick of the draft. 
The supposed one-two combination of Todd Lyght and Raghib Ismail was scrapped when Hocket signed with the Toronto Argonauts. 
The Los Angeles Hams, surprised that cornerback Todd Lyght was still available, snapped him up with the fifth pick of the NFL draft Sunday. 
The choice of the Notre Dame defender was relatively obvious since the Rams were among the worst in the league last season in pass defense and are planning to go to a more ag­gressive scheme that will re­quire solid man-to-man cover­age by their cornerbacks. 
Heading into t-he draft, Los Angeles coach John Robinson said of Lyght, "We don't expect him to be available, but we'd be happy to take him." 
"The last two or three weeks, we made scenarios," said Jeff Fisher, the Rams' defensive co­ordinator who was hired away from the Philadelphia Eagles during the offseason. "Todd Lyght's name never came up. We thought Cleveland would take him with the second pick." 
The Browns, however, chose UCLA safety Eric Turner. The 
Hams then thought Denver, picking fourth, might take Lyght. 
"As soon as Dnnver took Mike Croel, there was no question who we would take," Fisher said. "We thought Lyght was one of the best players in the draft. and a lot of peopln had Hocket Ismail and Lyght as the two best players available in the draft." 
Hobinson said Lyght would certainly have a chance to be a starter his l'irst season with the Hams. Fisher soundt~d as if he expects him to lm. 
"In our scheme, you have to bP smart. one, and tough and aggressive, two," Fisher said. "Lyght is both of those." 
Lyght also was surprised he didn't go before the fifth pick, but he said he was happy things turned out the way they did.

N D softball team hands Dayton Flyers two losses with better hitting and pitching; wins sixth in a row 
By RENE FERRAN Associate Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame softball team continued its winning ways this weekend, sweeping its third doubleheader in four days. 
The Irish (25-19) took care of hapless Dayton (2-22) 8-1 and 4-2 on Saturday to extend their win streak to six games, a streak which has coincided with an awakening of their hitting. 
Coming into its twinbill with St. Joseph's on Wednesday, the team was batting a paltry .206 on the season. Only last week­end, the Irish were swept by Detroit by identical 1-0 scores. 
Since Tuesday's split with Indiana State, however, Notre Dame has belted out 57 hits and 42 runs in taking two each from the Pumas, Loyola and now the Flyers. 
"The two losses to Detroit were frustrating because we know we are much better than they are," said senior first baseman Kathy Vernetti. "I think we took it upon ourselves personally to do something to get our bats going." 
"One factor is that the teams we've played recently haven't had the pitching quality we've faced earlier in the season," added senior outfielder Megan Fay. "But another is our atti­tude. We've been trying to get more positive, more aggres­sive." 
And on Saturday, Dayton pitchers Jodi Curnutte and Kris Baiardi were victims of this new aggressive attitude. 

In game one, the Irish pounded out 11 hits off Curnutte to back the four-hit pitching of Staci Alford (9-4).

They started the scoring early, getting three runs in the sec­ond, but the Flyers answered in the bottom of the inning to close the Irish lead to 3-1. 
Notre Dame upped the lead to 5-1 in the sixth as second baseman Christy Connoyer-who went four-for­four in the game-tripled to lead off the inning and scored on third baseman Debbie Boulac's grounder to the right side. Catcher Amy Folsom followed with a single, and one out later, came home on Vernetti's single. 
The Irish tacked on three more insurance runs in the sev­enth as Fay, Folsom and Rachel Crossen all knocked in runs. 
"We hit the ball in bunches in this game," said coach Brian Boulac. "Christy Connoyer especially had a big game." _ 
In the nightcap, Notre Dame rallied from a 2-1 deficit with three runs in the fifth inning to grab the victory. 
The Irish struck first, as back-to-hack walks to Laurie Sommerlad and Fay hurt Baiardi one out later when Casey McMurray rapped an REI-single to right. 
Dayton countered in the fourth. Curnutte belted an RBI-

Christy Connoyer 

triple off Carrie Miller (6-5) to score the first run, and Kelli Lyman followed with a single, bringing home Curnutte and giving the Flyers the 2-1 lead. 
But in the fifth, Sommerlad led off with a single. Crossen knocked her in with a double and Fay followed with a sharp single to left to plate Crossen. After McMurray singled to put runners at the corners, Fay came home on a Dayton throw­ing error on a double steal to put Notre Dame ahead 4-2. 
From there, Miller shut the door on Dayton, allowing only five hits for the game-three in the Flyer fourth-to earn her third consecutive victory. 
"It took us a while to jell to­gether as a team," Vernetti said. "We still have a lot of work to do offensively, but we're improving every game."

behind 3-0 in the first set be­fore he won six in a row to take the set 6-3 from Brian DeVirgilio. His success contin­ued and he won the second set 6-3. The win marked the first time DeVirgilio had lost to the Irish. 
Curt Josselyn took advantage of sophomore Mark Schmidt's slow start and won the first set 3-6. Schmidt fought back and won the last two sets 6-4. 6-0 by using the whole court and mixing up the pace. Josselyn grew frustrated as the match went on and Schmidt had total control by the end. 
"We have very similar game styles," said Schmidt. "I was impacient at the start and made several unforced errors. I played smarter in the later sets. It's all mental." 
The Irish have now attained two-thirds of their goal to win their last three matches. The final remaining hurdle is Wisconsin who the Irish face on Tuesday.

The precarious weather in Indianapolis never produced rain. 
But the Irish baseball team took the city by storm, sweep­ing a four game series from the hosting Butler Bulldogs. 
Highlighted by solid pitching, Notre Dame (26-12 overall) climbs to 9-2 in the MCC con­ference with first-place Detroit (11-1 in conference play) within sight. 
Irish coach Pat Murphy saw significance in the team's per­formance against the mediocre 13-22 Bulldogs. "Butler is hav­ing their best season in some time. They beat Evansville twice, as well as Indiana and Purdue." 
"To win 12 straight certainly is encouraging. Also, winning all four games on the road against any team is tough. We're gaining our confidence right now... "said coach Pat Murphy. 
Notre Dame set a dominating tone early in the first game, scoring four runs in the top of the first off starting pitcher Scott Metzinger; then pro­ceeded to rattle him for 11 runs, courtesy of four pivotal Bulldog errors, in the next three innings. Irish sophomore lefty Chris Michalak (9 strike­outs) and freshman Robert Arguello combined for the seven inning shutout. 
The Irish and pitcher Alan Walania cruised through the second game. Walania (8-4) allowed only one run, that coming in his ninth inning of work, where he was relieved by right fielder Eric Danapolis, to preserve the 5-1 victory. 
First baseman Joe Binkewiecz, continuing his phe­nomenal hitting streak (25-46 in his last 14 games) by going 7­15 in the series, stroking a homer in the second game. 
The men's tennis team was as 
the opening sets against Ball State, but heated up quickly to sweep 
cold and windy in Muncie and the entire team 
David 
Chuck Coleman, and sophomore Mark Schmidt all lost their first sets 
"After the first sets, I was wondering what we had done wrong," said Notre Dame coach Bob Bayliss. "Ball State looked so sharp and we looked inept and flat. Individually, we got our act together and competed well in front of a very vocal crowd under raw conditions." 
DiLucia fought every step of the way in his win over Dan Kronauge. The large crowd vo­
of Kronauge and made DiLucia's fight difficult. DiLucia lost the 
"Binkewiecz is unconscious; I'm afraid to wake him up," Murphy proclaimed. 
Incredible though it may seem, his 11 homers in the last 12 games fail to do him justice. 
"He had three homers taken away from him by the wind (which blew in the entire series). One went for a double and two were outs," explained Murphy. 
On Sunday, Binkewiecz began NO's attack with a lead-off walk. A Cory Mee sacrifice, a stolen base and a Mike Coss single brought home the first run. Continuing his aggressive play, Murphy had Coss steal second. Dan Bautch then came through with a single, which caused an errant throw and the second Irish run. 
That was all sophomore right­hander Pat Leahy needed. He completed his seven inning 
see BASEBALL/ page 11 
first set 5-7 and fell behind 4-3 in the second set. He came back to win the second set, 7-6 on a 7-3 tiebreaker. With that as momentum, DiLucia took the final set 6-1. 
"Things weren't going too well in the beginning. It was a difficult day to play outside and the hostile crowd got on my nerves. I just focused on one point at a time and pulled it to­gether," said DiLucia of his match. 
At number-two singles, Coleman also fell behind losing his first set 2-6 to Scott Campbell. Campbell came to the net early and caught Coleman off guard. In the latter sets. Coleman started hitting deeper and keeping Campbell off the net. 
Coleman's strategy was sim­ple. "He tried to pressure me and it took a little getting used to. I just concentrated on using the wind to my advantage," said Coleman.

Rocket skips NFL for Argo's $26 million 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -The fastest player in football is now the richest. 
Raghib "Rocket" Ismail spurned the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday and signed the most lu­crative contract in pro football history with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League. 
Toronto owner Bruce McNall said Ismail's contract includes a guaranteed $18 million in U.S. dollars over four years and incentives that could increase the value of the deal to more than $26 million. 
The speedy wide receiver-kick returner from Notre Dame said there were several reasons he chose the CFL over the NFL, but one of the most important was financial security for his family. 
''I'm going to make my family happy," said Ismail, runnerup in last year's Heisman Trophy voting. "Regardless of how things turn out for me, they're going to be able to live com­fortably and not have to worry about anything." 
Ismail, who skipped his senior season at Notre Dame to turn pro, replaces San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana as football's highest-paid player. Montana makes almost $4 mil­lion per year. 
Most people expected the Cowboys to make Ismail the No. 1 pick in Sunday's NFL draft, but they took Miami defensive tackle Russell Maryland instead after contract negotiations with Ismail broke down. The Cowboys obtained the first pick in a trade with the New England Patriots. 
"We made good faith negotia­tions with the Rocket, but his numbers were totally out of our range," Dallas owner Jerry Jones said. "We found out pretty quick he was headed for Canada." 
Some of the incentives in Ismail's contract are based on his ability to boost attendance for Toronto games in the SkyDome. McNall denied re­ports that the package also in­cludes condominiums in Toronto and Los Angeles. 
"I felt that if we can add peo­ple in the stands, it's a very sound investment," McNall said. 
McNall hopes that Ismail can do for the Argonauts what Wayne Gretzky has done for the Los Angeles Kings, another team that he owns. Kings at­tendance has skyrocketed since Gretzky, a part-owner of the Argonauts, signed a $15 million contract with the team in 1988. 
Despite the high expectations, Ismail said he feels no pressure. 
''I'm determined to enjoy ev­erything that's happened to me and be very relaxed," he said. ''I'm going to do my job and not worry about anything." 
McNall's reputation as a gen­erous owner also influenced Ismail, who joined Magic Johnson in the owner's luxury
