'Meet the Candidates Night' is held at SMC 
By BRIGID BRENNAN 
News Staff 
Diversity and security were the primary issues addressed by both campaign tickets during the Saint Mary's "Meet the Candidates Night" Monday night at Haggar Parlor. 
The McGowan ticket consists of Shannon McGowan running for student body president; Debbie Neiman, for vice pres­ident for academic affairs; and Kathy Sullivan, for vice presi­dent for student affairs. 
Throughout the debate, the candidates emphasized several issues, including student in­volvement and open communi­cation between Saint Mary's students, faculty members and Notre Dame students. Distri­bution of security newsletters was also suggested. 
The ticket's campaign slogans include, "Waddle you do without us?" and "Get your feet wet." 
The second ticket includes Lisa Catenacci for president; Deirdre Milon, for vice presi­dent for academic affairs; and Mary Beth Blajda, for vice president of student affairs. "Steer in the right direction" and "Ride with experience" are their slogans for the cam­paign. In their introduction, Catenacci spoke about the ticket's goal of extending dining hall hours and increas­ing security awareness. 
Seven questions were di­rected toward the candidates by Sai-rt Mary's current Stu­dent Body President Julie Parish. Parish's questions ranged from ways to encour­age individualism and create diversification at Saint Mary's to ways of eliminating stereotypes between Saint Mary's and Notre Dame wo­men. The candidates were al­lowed one and a half minutes for each answer. The Observer and the audience also had an opportunity to question the can­didates. 
Many new ideas for student involvement were presented by both tickets. Suggestions in­cluded continuing the diversity series with additional speakers and increased awareness, of­fering more courses centering on women and establishing pro­grams to promote healthy relationships between Saint Mary's and Notre Dame wo­men. Student art exhibits and "Major Nights," designed to help freshmen and sophomore students decide which course of study to pursue were also pro­posed. 
The student government elections will be held during all meals in SAGA on Wednesday, Feb. 22. Due to the large num­ber of students fasting at lunch during Lent, however, voting will also take place in Haggar Hall outside of the bookstore during lunch. Students may vote on the LeMans side of the dining hall during breakfast and dinner. 
A 50 percent majority and one additional vote is required to win the election. If neces­sary, a run-off will be held on Friday, Feb. 24. The run-off will follow the same procedure as the original election. 
Current Student Body Presi­dent Julie Parish said both tick­ets represented themselves well but also said the candi­dates could have answered the questions more directly. "The candidates danced around a little bit with their answers," Parish said.

The Macintosh Computer Lab in the LaFortune Student Center will stay open 24 hours a day beginning in April, accor­ding to Carolyn Goodnight, a consultant analyst at the Com­puting Center and Mathema­tics Building. Goodnight said the new lab will replace the current 24-hour lab in the CCMB. 
When the LaFortune lab begins operating on a 24-hour basis, Goodnight said all the word processors in the CCMB will be moved to the second floor of the Hesburgh Library, near the Reserve Room. 

The target date for this proj­ect is April 1, said Goodnight, although she said she is still looking for students to staff the lab. 24-hour student staffing will be a new task for Good­night, who is primarily in­volved with employing stu­dents at the computer labs currently on campus. 
The 24-hour lab presently in the CCMB doesn't require stu­dent workers around the clock, since computer operators, who monitor mainframe com­puters, are present at night. 
There is more room for com­puters at the library than in the CCMB, and the location is more

IN BRIEF 

James Carberry, professor of chemical engineering at Notre Dame, has been elected to the National Academy of Engineering, it was announced Monday in Washington 
D.C. Carberry was among 90 U.S. engineers and seven foreign associates elected this year. Cited for fundamental contributions to chemical reaction and heterogeneous catalysis, he joins the total membership of 1,482 engineers and 122 foreign associates. In catalysis, a chemical reac­tion between two or more substances is enhanced by the presence of a third substance, the catalyst, which remains unchanged in the process. The catalyst either speeds up the chemical reaction or increases the yield of the desired compound by in check the production of nonessential prod­ucts. -The Observer 
Arctic explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes left Monday on a third attempt to walk unaided to the North Pole-an adventure he likened to "climbing a horizontal Mount Everest without oxygen." Fiennes, 45, flew to Montreal with partner Mike Stroud, 33, to prepare their attempt to become the first to make the 425-mile trek without dogs or other support. They will make camp at Ward Hunt Island, the world's most northerly land point, and hope to set out March 7. -Associated Press

Despite complaints, NO is still special 
For the past few months, whiners have run rampant on the Notre Dame campus. 
I've been as guilty of it as anyone else, espe­cially since I have been known to use this column space to rant and rave about what I feel are common problems at Notre Dame. 
Constant complaints about the food, the social life, the housing policy, the checkmarking sys­tem, the way the University allocates its funds, the evil administration out to do us all in and the intolerant, homogeneous student body have reached my ears. 
Granted, many of these are legitimate gripes, but anyone from outside the Notre Dame family who listens to us for a period of time probably concludes that life at Notre Dame is wonderful as long as no one has to eat, sleep, breathe, live in the dorms, have a social life or take classes. 
I have a pleasant surprise for all the whiners out there, who seem to feel that Notre Dame can do nothing right for them: it could be worse. 
Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't sEre, in the over­all scheme of things, that this campus has too many drastic problems. In fact, in many ways, we are awfully lucky. 
I am the first to admit that South Bend is not many people's idea of an ideal college town. Getting around is pretty inconvenient without a car, it doesn't have as many cultural activities as a lot of people would like, the DJ's of U93 have got to go and the winters would be great if only no one had to step outside. 
On the other hand, Notre Dame does not have some of the problems it would have if it were situated in a larger city, either. We like to com­plain about South Bend, but we also like to be able to leave our doors unlocked when we leave our rooms. Students attending colleges consid­ered to have more ideal locations also have to worry about walking around the campus alone after a certain hour. 
As for the social life complaints, which seem to go hand in hand with complaints about the size of South Bend, I can only say that there have been people who have tried to change things. The All-Campus SYR is the result of one such effort. Everyone kicked and screamed when the number of dances was curtailed, since it apparently curtails the amount of dating that goes on, yet I'd be willing place bets that very few tickets have been sold for this event. 
Ifthis type of solution is not a positive solution in the eyes of the majority, then maybe those who make up the majority should go over to student government and volunteer to help out to affect some changes that they do want. 
I'm not wild about some of the policies that have been handed down from on high, either. But after I've been standing on my soap box for awhile, preaching about how much better I could be doing if I made the decisions around here, I try to calm myself down by making

myself count my blessings. I start to feel pretty petty after I watch the news and realize what I could be coping with, when all I have to worry about is whether I'll be allowed to carry an open beer in the hallway. 
When I first visited Notre Dame, and my tour­guide led me to the various points of interest around Notre Dame, I was impressed not only by the genuine love he had for this university and his open friendliness, but by the fact that I found these same positive qualities in every­one I encountered. The sense of unity and spirit that I detected immediately was a major factor in my decision to come here. 
Sometimes, when I listen to the conversation around me, I wonder if this is the same place, if these are the same students who turned out in force to cheer the football team to victory against Miami, who rallied around a prospec­tive freshman when she was injured in last year's keg toss, who greet strangers cheerfully on the quad. 
I know it's difficult to be cheerful in the middle of February when it's freezing cold and the backlog of reading is piling high. But in the midst of whining about life in general, it is im­portant to remember that, despite its problems, there is something about Notre Dame that brought us here, that keeps us here, and brings us back for years after graduation. Taking an active interest in student concerns is a positive thing, as long as we keep in mind that in spite of it all, this is a special place, and being here makes us luckier than most.

"This rare convention invita­tion represents all of Mr. Starn's (the conductor's) hard work. He took a club which remains a fraternal orginiza­tion and made it into a nation­ally renowned musical group. The club has lost none of it's spirit, and its music has been enhanced," said Scott. "He has impressed upon us the value of good music." 
many believed there would be no 24-hour computer lab on campus when the CCMB lab closed. "It was never in the minds of the computer people that we wouldn't have a 24-hour lab," said Goodnight. "The 'where' of the 24-hour lab is what we weren't sure of."

Constitutional changes in HPC are discussed 
By FLORENTINE HOELKER Staff Reporter 
Student Senate Monday eve­ning debated aspects of a pro­posed constitutional change dealing with the Student Union Board. 
The constitutional change, according to SUB manager Brian Reilly, is to ensure a bu­reaucracy that is more effi­cient and more qualified. This would guarantee better service to the students and would help clarify the exact nature of SUB members' powers. 
Debate Jver the proposed change originated from a dis­cussion whether or not a com­mittee should exist to review the general policies and finances of SUB on a regular basis. Any such committee would consist of several stu­dent government, SUB and Hall Presidents' Council mem­bers. 
Student Body President Tom Doyle said, "I think that since the Student Union Board is ul­timately resposible to the sen­ate and to the students, we (the senate) should know what's going on with its budget." He cited SUB as having the largest

Reilly agreed, but said that the creation of another group would be time-consuming and unneccesary. Reilly held that a regular report to the student 
government  treasurer  should  
suffice.  
"Accountability  is  neces­ 

sary, but at what cost?" asked Reilly. 
Concern was raised by Stu­dent Body Vice President Mike Paese that, with the present system, mismanagement in SUB could occur without the senate's immediate knowledge or intervention. 
Both Doyle and Paese con­cluded that SUB should be more directly accountable to student senate to better deal with any inconsistencies or abuses. However, the issue was tabled until next meeting due to time constraints. 
In other senate business, HPC said the date for hall gov­ernment elections is set for March 28. Both newly-elected and old hall presidents will at­tend HPC meetings for the two weeks after the elections to en­sure a smooth transition of power in the HPC.

Conditions for asylum in U.S. made more stringent 
Associated Press 
BROWNSVILLE, Texas-Central Americans applying for asylum will get an answer in as little as one day and will be subject to immediate im­prisonment if turned down, of­ficials said Monday. 
The Immigration and Naturalization Service staff in southern Texas will be in­creased by 500 to patrol the bor­der and speed up the weeding out of "frivolous" asylum claims, INS commissioner Alan Nelson announced. 
More jails will be built to hold people who are turned down pending their appeal or deportation, he said. 
"We intend to send a strong signal to those people who have the mistaken idea that by merely filing a frivolous asylum claim, they may stay in the United States," Nelson said. "This willful manipula­tion of America's generosity must stop." 
A group called the Brownsville Ad Hoc Refugee Committee criticized the new INS policy as a "mean-spirited attempt to deter political refugees from applying for po­litical asylum." 
The policy will be phased in over the next several weeks. Nelson said the INS hopes even­tually to process most asylum applications in the region in a sought asylum in fiscal year day or two. Currently, asylum 1988, compared with 7,063 in decisions can take months. 1985.

the lawsuit that led to the restraining order, said INS detention "should be the excep­tion and not the rule for asylum seekers." He said the United States should show a ''humanitarian spirit.'' 
Roughly half of the Central Americans seeking asylum are from Nicaragua, Nelson said. 
"In a real sense," said Rubin, in San Francisco, "the INS has become a prisoner of its own policy. And that policy as recently as 1987 and 1988 was to encourage Nicaraguans to come to the United States be­cause they would be granted asylum.

as usual, but about one-fifth of the 89 attendants and fewer than half the 13licensed practi­cal nurses showed up for the first shift, officials said. About half the 26 registered nurses honored the picket line, said Dan Caley, an MHRH spokes­man. 
Only one of 117 attendants scheduled to work at the state Institute of Mental Health, also staffed by union members, re­ported for work Monday mor­ning, said Romeo. 
Gov. Edward DiPrete called out the Guard late Sunday after the union voted four to one to reject a proposed 53-cent-an­hour raise offered in return for concessions on staffing, includ­ing a reduction in overtime and greater management leeway in transferring staffers from ward to ward. 
The union, which has 1,300 members, about half of whom work at General Hospital, is up­set with a new hospital policy not to replace absent employees to curb overtime. 
DiPrete has ordered the MHRH to erase a $3.5 million projected deficit by the July 1 end of the fiscal year. 
Negotiations broke down Friday, and no new talks were scheduled. 
About two dozen people ar­rived by late morning in response to a hospital appeal for volunteers, said a volunteer who would not give her name. 
National Guard member Sue McCabe, a registered nurse called in from her shift at War­wick's Kent County Memorial Hospital, said she was caring for about 10 patients, "so that's not really a big deal."

Two central charges against North, accusing him of conspir­acy and theft in diverting Iranian arms sale profits to the Nicaraguan guerrillas, were thrown out last month on na­tional security grounds. 
The jury of nine women and three men was selected Feb. 9. But the trial was delayed when the Justice Department protested that North might divulge classified material in the courtroom. After receiving assurances from Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh, the department on Wednesday dropped efforts to delay the tri­al. 

The jurors have one thing in common: they had almost no exposure to North's nationally 
televised congressional tes­
timony in 1987 in which he ad­
mitted under limited immu­
nity f~om prosecution, many 
details touching on the crimes 
with which he is charged. 
The jurors include an electronics technician, a cas­hier, an clerical worker who says "I don't like the news" and an unemployed former of­fice manager who says she recalled that North was "sell­ing something to Iran." 
North, a decorated former Marine colonel, is accused of 12 criminal charges. 
Five include alleged lying to Congress in 1985 and 1986 by denying he was assisting the Contras. Four other counts al~ lege that he lied to Congress and the attorney general and that he destroyed documents in November 1986. 
North allegedly helped prepare false chronologies, saying no one in the U.S. gov­ernment learned before J anu­ary 1986 that Hawk missiles had been shipped to Iran in No­vember 1985. He also is accused of lying to the attorney general that the National Security Council was involved in divert­ing money from the arms sales to the Contras, and with falsify­ing documents showing his in­volvement with the Contras.

P.O. Box Q
Catenaccii ticket deserves your vote The Observer endorses the ticket of Lisa Catenacci for Saint Mary's student body president, Mary Beth Blajda for vice pres­ident for student affairs and Deirdre Milon for vice president for academic affairs. Experience in student government, visibility to the students, and a professional and practical approach to working with the administration sets the Catenacci ticket apart from the Shannon McGowan ticket. Catenacci currently serves as junior class president, Milon holds the position of junior class treasurer and Blajda was soph­omore class president. While experience alone does not make for a successful administration, i1t is vital for the student body officers to have a working knowledge of the bureaucracy. The Catenacci ticket has this knowledge and therefore the capability to continue the improvements that Juliie Parrish's administration has made. Student government's success depends on its visibility to each student. The Catenacci ticket has shown a willingness and dedication to listen to the student needs and a competency in acting upon these needs. Communicating student needs to the administration requires clearly defined goals and the professionalism to make these goals reality. As a result of their extensive experience with Saint Mary's administration, Catenacci, Blajda and Milon can develop pragmatic alternatives for student concerns. While neither ticket has addressed successfully the issues of security information problems and student diversity at Saint Mary's, the Catenacci ticket is more likely to push for necessary change. Exercise your right to make student government work for you. Vote for Lisa Catenacci, Mary Beth Blajda and Deirdre Milon on Wednesday. -The Observer

Campus-Wide SYR starts tradition 
Dear Editor: 
When -the Student Union Board took a survey last semester to find out what you, the student body, wanted to see and do on campus, the responses we received were outstanding. You said you wanted more opportunities to get out of the dorms, more weekend events to get away from the same old party­hopping, and more ways to meet people . of the opposite sex (What? At Notre Dame?) 
In keeping with the unified spirit and classy tradition that we've all come to enjoy, the Student Union Board is res­ponding to your suggestions in a big way. For the first time ever, the entire campus of Notre Dame is invited to come together for The Campus-Wide SYR. For one night, on Friday, Feb. 24, everyone on campus will be able to party together. The North Dining Com­mons will be the place to meet with your friends from all over campus, dance to the incredible music of the Rave from Chicago, and win prizes just for walking in the door. 
This SYR does have a twist. If you no longer trust your roommate's taste in dates and you want to meet that per­fect someone you've been waiting for during your entire college career, the SUB is providing a computerized dating service free of charge. Sign up for your­self or your entire section. The Campus­Wide SYR is the beginning of another great ND tradition. Tickets and com­puter date applications are available from your dorm SYR commissioners and at the LaFortune Information Desk. Friday, Feb. 24, The Campus­Wide SYR, a night to remember.

24 hour lounge not really needed 
Dear Editor: 
I'd like to respond to the column writ­ten by Matt Gallagher (Feb. 15), as well as all the students who wonder why the Oak Room is not open 24 hours. As an employee of the Oak Room, and a stu­dent who studies there regularly, I am glad the Oak Room is not open 24 hours. 
24-hour space is available in each dorm--and I realize that this is not ideal, but a successful social life is not dependent on where one can be social, rather, it depends on the individual. Most of the people I know have managed to enjoy their years at Notre Dame immensely even without a 24­hour Oak Room. 
I do not see the 24-hour service as necessary or even beneficial for Notre Dame as an institution or its student body. We know that, as an institution, Notre Dame can well afford to keep it open, so let us put financial considera­tions aside. 
As an employee, I saw the ugly side of the 24-hour facility. On any given Thursday, Friday or Saturday night I was called many an unflattering name because I refused to give someone more chips or fries without charging them extra. A large number of students sup­posedly from civil families stood on the tables and chairs, pointed towards what they wanted, demanded rather than asked, and that is if they were sober enough to speak for themselves. The students seem to forget that I am an employee providing a convenience, not a slave, and the Night Oak is not a necessity. 
I am also not being paid to police the students, but I sometimes must. Every nacho or fry that is passed out has to be watched to make sure it is not eaten before the student gets to the register. 
When I walk around to clean up the tables, I find empty beer cans with the beer, if not spilled on the floor, then filling a nacho dish to the rim. I then have to do a balancing act of getting it to the trash can without spilling it. Two trash cans sit at the exit but it seems a lot of students don't know how to clean up after themselves. Once things do get cleaned, a broken salad bar is found, a trashed bathroom, a kicked-in front door, and the list goes on. 
I enjoy working at the Night Oak on Friday and Saturday nights. I have fun with the people with whom I work. I even enjoy serving most of the stu­dents. But some students have to learn to be considerate and grateful for the Oak Room as a convenience, not abuse it and think it their right. The' 24-hour Oak Room is not a necessity. If the con­tinuation of a 24-hour service is going to make or break a person's social life, then that person better move to the city that never sleeps.

A different type of relationship found on the Notre Dame I Saint Mary's campus will soon be explored by the Saint Mary's Theater and Communications Depart­ment through their presenta­tion of "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." 
The play opens on Wednes­day, February 22 and runs to Sunday, February 26 at St. Mary's O'Laughlin Auditorium. Showtime will be at 8:10 p.m. Wednesday thru Teddy Lloyd (Mark Cos­Saturday. On Sunday, there tanzi), Sandy (Amy McFad­will be a special 3 p.m. den), Mackay (K. Lynn

Julie Jensen, professor of acter he created named Simon. 

So with the music that Robert 
already wrote and with the 
knowledge that three of his 
friends had some experience 
with stage and music, the four 
got together and "Simon" was 
finally finished last December. 
Costanzi said, "It's the music that makes it good and that's what people will remember." 
Appearing in the Notre Dame production will be Steve Weh­meyer as Simon, Jackie Bayliss as Emily, Mary Louisa Meehan as Shirley, Paul Savatoriello as Jeffrey and Stephanie Pile as Annie. David Foster, Lewis LaGrange and John McKee play regulars in the bar. 
Music direction is by Jeffrey McGarrity with choreography by Jilanne Klaus. Kevin Hof­fman and Dan Gore built and designed the set respectively. 
Tickets are $3 and can be pur­chased at the LaFortune Box Office, 239-5957. Visa and Mas­terCard are accepted. 
Costanzi explained that after the production, the musical will be revised and parts will be rewritten (if needed). Then the four hope to publish "Simon" and that it will someday make it in a great theater, or maybe even Broadway. 
communication and theater at Saint Mary's College is the director of "The Pride of Miss Jean Brodie." Jensen describes the play as a "complicated story about the relationship between students and teachers." According to Jensen, the play raises the question of "what to do in the face of an extremely powerful teacher." 
Tickets for the play will be sold for $4 to all students through the O'Laughlin Auditorium Box Office. Tick­ets will also be sold at the doors each night of the per­formance. 
According to Jensen, the significance of "The Pride of Miss Jean Brodie" extends beyond the academic sphere. The message of the play holds true for any situation in which one person becomes all too powerful.

Gilbert wins Volvo, gains confidence 
Associated Press 
MEMPHIS, Tenn--Brad Gil­bert is serving warning that he is ready to make a major move up the tennis rankings ladder in 1989. 
Gilbert, a finalist two weeks sgo in Chicago, dominated Johan Kriek for two sets Sun­day and then captured the singles title in the $415,000 Volvo Tennis Indoor Champi­onship when a groin injury forced Kriek to retire. 
"It was an unfortunate way to end the tournament, but it feels good to be back in the win­ner's circle again," said Gil­bert, the No. 6 seed in the In­door and currently ranked 19th in the world. 
Gilbert had little problem handling No. 16 Kriek's power game, winning the first two sets by identical 6-2 scores. 
"I played consistently. I didn't really go for a lot of win­ners. I just played the ball back," said Gilbert, who defeated Kriek for the sixth time in seven meetings. 
"I played well all week. I just thought if I played one match at a time, things would fall into place," Gilbert said. 
Gilbert, a bronze medalist at the 1988 Olympics, earned $53,550 for the win, while Kriek took home $26,775. 
The Indoor title was the second for Gilbert, who defeated John McEnroe in 1982.

Special to The Observer 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn.-­Sheila Frost scored 31 points and grabbed 12 rebounds as No. 3 Tennessee defeated Notre Dame 98-43 in wo­men's basketball Monday night. The loss was the most decisive ever suffered by the Notre Dame women's bas­ketball team. 
Tennessee improved to 25­2 with the victory while the Irish slipped to 15-8. 
The Lady Volunteers took an early 25-4 lead and led 43­16 at halftime. 
Tennesee scored 10 straight points to take a 41­point lead, 95-34, with 4:02 left.

Tennessee now leads the series with Notre Dame 6-0, thrashing the Irish last year 91-71 at the JACC. The pre­vious worst loss ever dealt the Irish was also at the hands of the Lady Volun­teers, 90-55 duuring the 1986­87 season.

Irish hockey to end season 
Notre Dame faces off against Western Michigan in finale

continued from page 16 
"He has as much potential as anybody in college baseball," said Murphy. "The two-year layoff has hurt him, but I look for Frank to have a great year." 
Freshmen Jason Martinez and Corey Mee will serve as utility players for the Irish. 
OUTFIELD 

Junior Dan Peltier (.414, 7, 70), a pre-season All-America selection by Copper­tone-Collegiate Baseball, moves from right field to cen­terfield. 
"Dan Peltier's a ballplayer," said Murphy. "We could stick him at shortstop, and he'd do the job ... and he's lefthanded. Moving him to center is going to give him the ability to have more leadership." 
Peltier set school records with 89 hits and 21 doubles in a 1988 season that saw the Clifton Park, N.Y., resident post a .581 on-base percentage. He will bat third in the Irish lineup. 
Freshman Craig Counsell of Whitefish Bay, Wise., will bat second in the lineup and play left field. The rest of the Irish lineup will shuffle according to various circumstances, such as whether the opposing pitcher is lefthanded or righthanded. 
"Craig's an infielder by trade, but he's got a great sense for baseball," said Murphy. "He's not exceptional in any one area, but he's a total player." 
James Sass (.301, 0, 13) returns to the outfield, moving from left field to right field. The senior from Louisville, Ky., posted impressive numbers late January. He had 44 points in 30 games. 
Presently, the Broncos are in seventh place in the CCHA with a 7-17-6 conference record and 10-21-6 overall. They've been especially cold of late, going 0­7-1 in their last eight games, including a sweep last weekend at the hands of the defending NCAA champions, the Lake Su­perior State Lakers. 
Since Green's injury, the scoring slack has been picked up by junior center Paul Polil­lo, with 12 goals, 38 assists, and 50 points, and senior winger Ron Hoover, 28-18-46. In the nets, senior Bill Horn has played 32 games (9-17-6) with a 4.27 goals-against average and .867 save percentage. Horn may, however, be rested tonight and replaced by fresh­man Rob Laurie, 1-4, 6.25 GAA, .795 save percentage. 
Still, the Irish have an oppor­tunity to show how far they have come this year since their 
automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Murphy does not quite agree with that, espe­cially since defending confer­ence champion Evansville returns seven starters. 
"Our program has received a lot of recognition with the wins over Miami, and we deserve it," said Murphy, "but all the speculation doesn't mean a thing in baseball." 
The Irish open the season with road trips to the states of Texas, Florida and North Carolina. Along with the Miami and Texas games, Notre Dame will face 1988 NCAA partici­pant Pennsylvania and Sout­first game, an 8-2 loss at West­ern Michigan. Their strong showing against Michigan two weekends ago, coupled with their 7-2 bombardment of Lake Forest last Wednesday, has in­stilled some confidence in the team. 
"We had a great weekend of practice," said Irish coach Ric Schafer of this past weekend's outdoor practices forced by the unavailability of ice at the JACC. Schafer also indicated that he would go with basically the same line-up as he has all year rather than playing younger players just to give them some experience. "We have loyal seniors who deserve to play," 
Adding further interest to the game is freshman David Bankoske's effort to break the Notre Dame freshman assist record set in 1970 by John Noble. The record is 35. Going into the game, Bankoske has 34.

heaste'rn Conference team Vanderbilt. Notre Dame has 19 road games before its home opener March 29 . 
"Our schedule's much toug­her," said Murphy. "For us to try and repeat the record we had last year would be impossible, but I never put anything past these guys or anything past Notre Dame. 
"What we need to do is con­tinue our team identity of blue­

last season after switching from the football team to baseball. 
The Irish hope they can have more luck with football players this spring, as Notre Dame flanker Pat Eilers provides depth in the outfield. Eilers played baseball his freshman year at Yale before transfer­ring to Notre Dame. 
"I picture him the same way he is in football," said Murphy. "He finds a way to get on the field. He does everything cor­rectly, he works as hard as anyone, He's making that transition of not playing for a few years, but it's amazing he's 
made the rapid development he has." 
Sophomore outfielder Mike Rotkis (..372, 0, 12 in 28 games) has a good chance of starting at designated hitter. 
CATCHER 
What was a problem area early last season has turned 

By BRIAN McMAHON Sports Writer 
The University of Notre Dame hockey team wraps-up its regular season schedule tonight when the Western Mic­higan Broncos invade the JACC. 
Since the Irish will not com­pete in a postseason conference playoff this year, this is the last game of the year for Notre Dame, as well as the end of the careers of 10 Irish seniors. 
"This is it for us seniors," said senior co-captain Matt Hanzel. "We'd like to finish with a good taste in our mouths." 
The Broncos, like the Irish, have had a disappointing season. Predicted in preseason polls to finish as high as third place in the powerful Central Collegiate Hockey Association, they were decimated by injur­ies all year, including the loss of leading scorer Jeff Green in 
"Our object is to make the people hit it and give our defense a chance to make the plays and not walk anybody," said Murphy. "Great stuff doesn't make for great pitchers, you have to know how to pitch. That's what we're trying to impress upon these pitchers." 
RELIEF PITCHERS 
Junior Mike Coffey (2-0, 5.79) will try to replace the graduated Mike Harmon (6-4, 5.18, 5 saves) as Notre Dame's closer.

man, as will freshmen Tom Gulka of Lake Oswego, Ore., and Dan Marzec of Palatine, Ill. 
"When you lose a guy with Harmon's temperament, similar to Hutson, it's very, very hard to replace," said 
Murphy. "He had that bulldog --=====~-:;;;::;::;:;:;~:;:=~-~==~~

into one of the most stable de­partments on the 1989 Notre Dame team. Junior Ed Lund (.285, 1, 30) is the man respon­sible for that transformation. 
"His development is as­tonishing," said Murphy. "He's come from being an also­ran to a frontrunner, and he's one of the better catchers in the Coffey or Livorsi right now."
