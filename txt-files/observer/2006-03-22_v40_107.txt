Survey examines relationship obstacles 
By AMANDA MICHAELS 
News Writer 
With March Madness betting in full swing, constant streams of instant messages and an ever-expanding Facebook uni­verse -high school students now induded -it's undeniable Notre Dame students face a great deal of distraction from their classes, work and even traditional social lives. 
And now, the University is looking into it. 
This week, the University Cyber Vice and Gambling task forces sent 1,000 students a "Healthy Relationships Survey" in order to examine how certain behaviors, such as instant mes­saging and viewing pornogra­phy, could negatively affect interaction among Notre Dame undergraduates. 
Survey recipients -chosen at random, according to assistant director of the Office of Institutional Research Mark Gunty -were asked to go through six pages of questions that mainly focus on the stu­dent's observations on or per­sonal experiences with activities like instant messaging, brows­ing Facebook and the Internet, viewing on-line and print pornography, playing "graphi­cally violent" video games and various forms of gambling. 
A final write-in section is available for the student to detail his or her opinion on the positive and negative effects the listed activities can have on a person's ability to form healthy relationships. Responses are kept anonymous, according to the survey's introduction.

By KELLY MEEHAN 
Sainr Mary's Editor 
Continuing the tradition of giving back to the greater South Bend community, Notre Dame students may soon have additional volunteer opportu­nities to help those in need at the proposed Family Justice Center of Saint Joseph County. 
Approximately 75 communi­ty members gathered Tuesday night in the Carey Auditorium of the Hesburgh Library to dis­cuss the proposed center, which would be located in the First Source Bank Building on the corner of Main Street and Jefferson Street in South Bend. 
Casey Gwinn, the director of the Technical Assistance Project of the President's Family Justice Center Initiative, was the evening's keynote speaker and he stressed the necessity of a cen­ter such as this one in the South Bend community. 
"These centers fulfill a com­mon vision ... it is not just for kids, not just adults, but a cen­ter where the whole family can come to combat criminal jus­tice and receive the help they need," Gwinn said. 
Gwinn is the founder of the San Diego Family Justice Center, which is one of the most successful domestic vio­lence support centers in the country and serves as a model for the creation of similar pro­grams throughout the nation.

border of Ohio 
and 
Pennsylvania. This is a eity that was 
put on tim map after he led the 
Penguins to live national champi­
onships ... or was this eity already on 
thn map for other reasons? 
If you travel 300 miles east on 
H0/90 you will arrive in Youngstown, 
Ohio. A place nationally known to 
sonw as "Mob-town U.S.A." or the 
Steel City; Youngstown is a very spe­
cial place securely located between 
tllP two more well-known cities of 
Clevnland and Pittsburgh. Its con­
venient location allows residents an 
easy shopping or sporting escape to 
either of these eities. 
But is an escape rnally necessary? 
Upon arrival in Youngstown, you will 
immediately notice its striking skyline 
of rusted out steel mills from its more 
eeonomically booming days of yester­
day. Chances am. however. you know 
someone from Youngstown. own 
something from Youngstown, or the 
dty has in someway touched your 
life. 
The name DeBartolo obviously rings a bell or two. but did you know this family of donors hails from the gnmt stnnl eity? Or do you remember that kooky Congressman Jim Traflieant? The fashion police would have arrestml him for his animal like faux hair if the government hadn't gotten to him first, and although he was expelled from Congress and went to jail for taking government bribes, he was my state representative. 

Natives have a special place in their heart for two penguins named Pete and Patty. Mention these two names and everyone knows who you are talking about, the infamously well­known Youngstown State University mascots. Yes, the penguin proves to be an intimidating choiee for a mas­cot. Perhaps it was chosen in light of our frigid winters or because it ever so slightly edged out the more popu­lar Ohio Stat1~ Buckeye in fierceness. 
Youngstown's large Italian popula­tion guarantees that citizens will never go hungry. With a vast array of authentic restaurants. going out to eat bncomes more of a hobby than a nwans of filling your stomach. The eity is most well known tilr its one of a kind wndding soup. You may think that you have consumed this spinach and dough ball laden soup, however I promise that if it was not prepared in tho Youngstown vieinity it was a mere imitation. 
Shopping cart? I don't think so. In Youngstown these plastic grocery­holding crates on wheels arc simply called a buggy. This is not in refer­ence to a horse and buggy, nor is it implying a sighting of the city's near­by Amish neighbors. Youngstown­ians always refer to them as buggies, always. My friends think it is weird, others lind it funny, but I will never ehangn my ways, it is always a buggy. 
Youngstown may not be a prime destination, but hey it is the title and subject of a Bruce Springsteen song (which I personally lind very impres­sive). So maybe Youngstown is no Nnw York City, Chicago or even Cleveland. but that does not mean it is not a special place.

Cross-dressing robber given away by nylons 
MONTEREY, Calif. -A man's pantyhose led to his arrest, authorities said. An unshaven man wearing a black evening gown, fishnet stockings, calf-high boots and a black wig robbed a USA Gas station Monday morning, authorities alleged. 
The armed man stuffed $290 in cash into an ensem­ble-matching black purse. 
''I've been with the depart­ment for 22 years, and this is the first time I've heard of this happening anywhere here," police Lt. Phil Penko said. 
About 35 minutes after the robbery. police Officer Chad Ventimiglia spotted a black Saab with fishnet pantyhose hanging from the front dri­ver's side door, dragging on the ground, investigators said. 
Student volunteers find stash In New Orleans home 
NEW ORLEANS-Trista Wright was spending her spring break cleaning out hurricane-damaged homes when she discovered some unusual papers among the moldy plaster board and debris. 
"I started raking it out of the air conditioner vent. I thought it was garbage and I was going to shovel it up, but I bent down to pick it up, and it was a stack of $100 bills, and then more and more kept coming," the 19­year-old said Tuesday on CNN. 

By an unofticial count, it was more than $30,000. 
Wright and fellow students notified the organizers of their church mission, who told the St. Bernard Parish Sheriffs Office. 
The woman who owned the house, who has asked that she not be identified, was as shocked as Wright.

McCafferty fanilly tnetnbers organize first Father Mike Run 
Event commemorates former law school professor, University preszdential candidate Father Michael Dillon McCafferty 
By RYAN SYDLIK News Writer 
Notre Dame students, facul­ty and administrators will lace up their running shoes Saturday to honor the memo­ry and contributions of Father Michael Dillon McCafferty in the first-ever Father Mike 
Hun. 
The run will be held in con­junction with the Fr. Mike Show on Friday, a sketch comedy and talent show pro­
duced by Notre Dame Law School students. 
McCafferty was serving on the law school faculty when he died at the age of 40 in 1987 of lymphatic cancer. He was a 'triple Domer' having received a bachelor's degree in government and interna­tional studies in 1969, a juris doctor in 1973 and a master's degree in theology in 1974 from the University. He was ordained a priest in 1974, and he was appointed assis­tant dean of the law school in 
1979 after joining the law school faculty in 1978. He was also responsible for the Sunday evening Law School Liturgies, and he was even a finalist to succeed University President Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh as University President before his death. 
The run is a three-mile race that snakes through campus, beginning and ending at Notre Dame Stadium. Registration for the event can be done online by e-mailing bveith@nd.edu or by showing up at the stadium at 9 a.m. Saturday morning. 

The Father Mike Run was started by members of his own family, off-campus junior Brian Veith," Welsh Family sophomore Tricia Cronin and Farley freshman Courtney Dorger. Veith is McCafferty's nephew while Cronin and Dorger are his nieces. Six other of McCafferty's 22 nieces and nephews are Notre Dame graduates. 
Veith said many of their family members will partici­pate. 


"We felt we should get something together to cele­brate all of [McCafferty's] gifts," Veith said. 
Veith said he hoped at least 200 people will show up. 
"We realize that it might start small," Veith said. "Hopefully, we get the snow­ball rolling and maybe it will just get bigger." 
Veith, Dorger, and Cronin also expressed that they intend for the run to become 
a yearly event. 
"It is nice to have a poten­tial tradition to remember him," Veith said. 
Because most current stu­dents are not familiar with McCafferty, Dorger viewed the event as a way to intro­duce him to a new generation of students. 
"I think it's nice that some­one like that is still going to be recognized," she said. 
Veith, Dorger, and Cronin were all very young when their uncle died and they see the run as a way to become eloser to him 
"We never actually got to know him personally," Cronin said. 
Univesity administrators, including University President Father John Jenkins. Senior Executive Assistant and coun­selor to the President father Jim McDonald and Law School Dean Patricia O'Hara, all lent their support in organizing the event, Veith said.

Perry to be 'knighted' 
Special to The Observer 
Catherine Perry, associate professor of Romance lan­guages and literatures at Notre Dame, will be decorated with the insignia of the Ordre des Palmes Academiques at a pres­entation ceremony at 1 p.m. Wednesday at the Morris Inn. 
Richard Barbeyron, French consul general from Chicago, will conduct the ceremony. 
Perry was appointed a Chevalier ("knight") in the Ordre des Palmes Academiques earlier this year by the French Ministry of National Education. 
Created in 1808 by Napoleon I, the Palmes Academiques originally was designed to honor outstanding members of the faculty of the University of Paris. Membership later was expanded to include people beyond the French university system, including other nation­als and French scholars living outside the country whose work promotes French lan­guage, culture and educational activities. 
Perry, who specializes in French literature of the 19th and early 20th centuries, also serves as undergraduate advi­sor for the Program in French and Francophone Studies at Notre Dame. She is a faculty fellow in the Nanovic Institute for European Studies and in the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies.

Although paddles and pari­ntals may not go hand-in-hand under tlw Golden Dome, frater­nities and sororities are alive and well at several comparable institutions of higher learning. Nonexistent at Notre Dame, organizations like Alpha Delta Phi and Dnlta Delta fraternity Delta Sigma Pi and the community service fraterni­ty Alpha Phi Omega are all widely popular on campus, in addition to African American, Latino, Christian and other spe­cialized fraternities and sorori­ties. Since the organizations have no official affiliation with college, they are entirely fund­ed by dues and alumni dona­tions. 
"Our relationship with the university is a gray area," Delta Phi Epsilon president Hobert Dunphy told The Hoya, which is Georg.eto wn 's student-run newspaper.

"Of eoursc, many of these same groups pulled themselves out of bed on the weekends to eugagn in community snrviee," Steck .said in the column. "That was always the enigma for me: so much human dysfunctionali­ty bound together with genuine humanitarian concern." 
Steck said he knew of stu­dents who were "genuinely wonderful people on their own," but underwent a negative "transformation" when placed in the context of a Greek social arrangement. Once members of fraternities and sororities, Steek said these students and the desire to "escape life" through aleohol and sex.

According to a 2000 study in The Chronicle of Iligher Edueation, fraternity and soror­ity membership had decreased by approximately 30 pereent since 1990. 
decided fraterni­
ties and sororities were a hindrance to the overar­ching aims of Santa Clara, and thus its Greek system was ofli­cially abolished. 
In a Feb. 2, 2006 article in The Fairfield Mirror, University President Father Jeffrey von Arx explained Fairfield University's disaffiliation with Greek organizations as a conse­quence of Homan Catholie tra­dition.

Boston College is another Jesuit university that refuses to reeognize fraternities and sororities. According to artielcs in the student newspapers at both BC and Fairfinld, under­graduates share a common misunderstanding about why the policy against Greek sys­tems is in plaee at their respec­tive schools. 
"It is a misconception that BC poliey on fraternities and soror­ities is due to a strict rule that the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities (AJCU) has against Greek organizations," said a June 1, 2004 article in BC's student newspaper, The Heights. 
The AJCU mission statement maintains that "each institution is separately ehartered by the state and is legally autonomous under its own board of trustees" -and the same is true for all Catholic institutions of higher learning. 
The "Land 0' Lakes" state­ment reached in 1967 by an assembly of Catholie university leadership said colleges aligned with the Church require "a true autonomy and academic free­dom in the face of authority of whatever kind. lay or clerical, external or the academie com­munity itself."

Iran agrees to talk with U.S. on Iraq 
TEHRAN, Iran -Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Tuesday that he approves of talks between U.S. and Iranian officials on Iraq, but warned that the United States must not try to "bully" Iran. 
It was the first confirmation that Khamenei, who holds final say on all state matters in Iran, is in favor of the talks. 
His comments came hours after President Bush spoke in favor of such a meeting, saying American officials would show Iran "what's right or wrong in their activities inside oflraq." 
Khamenei said that "ifthe Iranian officials can make the U.S. understand some issues about Iraq, there is no problem with the negotiations." 
"But ifthe talks mean opening a venue for bul­lying and imposition by the deceitful party [the Americans], then it will be forbidden," he said in a speech in the northeastern city of Mashhad, aired on state television. 
Protesters defy Belarus authorities 
MINSK, Belarus -Several hundred defiant demonstrators who have camped out in a cen­tral square endured freezing temperatures for a third day Tuesday to protest the re-election of authoritarian Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko. 
Opposition leader Alexander Milinkevich, who has denounced the election that gave Lukashenko a new live-year term as a fraud and called for a new vote, urged demonstrators to keep up daily protests and called for a major show of strength Saturday. 
"Come here every day to speak of freedom," Milinkevich said, speaking in the glow from TV cameras after thelighting on Oktyabrskaya Square was shut off, plunging protesters into darkness and adding to concerns of a crack­down by seeurity forees.

Troops to stay in Iraq for years 
President Bush expects American involvement in Iraq to continue indefinitely 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON­President Bush said Tuesday that American forces will remain in Iraq for years and it will be up to a.future president to decide when to bring them all home. But defying critics and plunging polls, he deelared, ''I'm optimistic we'll succeed. If not, I'd pull our troops out." 
The president rejected ealls for the resignation of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, ehief arehitect of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. "Listen, every war plan looks good on paper until you meet the enemy," Bush said, acknowledging mistakes as the United States was foreed to switch tactics and change a reconstruction strategy that offered targets for insurgents. 
He also rejected asser­tions by Iraq's former inter­im prime minister that the country had fallen into eivil war amid sectarian violence that has left more than 1 ,000 Iraqis dead since the bombing last month of a Shiite Muslim shrine. 
"This is a moment the Iraqis had a chance to fall apart and they didn't," Bush said, crediting religious and political leaders with restraint.

IN BRIEF 
Microsoft to delay release of Vista 
SEATTLE -Microsoft Corp. will delay the consumer release of its new Windows operat­ing system until January 2007, missing the holiday sales season and throwing some PC makers and retailers into turmoil. 
The delay in Windows Vista -caused by Microsoft needing more time to enhance se·curity and other functions -will come as a blow to Microsoft partners who were looking forward to a new operating system to boost holiday sales. 
Windows Vista is Microsoft's first major update to the company's flagship operating system since Windows XP was released in late 2001. 
"It's not the optimal situation, to be launch­ing the next-generation version of Windows right after the big holdiay sales season," said analyst Joe Wilcox with Jupiter Research. 
The company will release some versions of the new operating system for big businesses by November as planned, but the consumer version will be postponed until January, said Jim Allchin, co-president of the Microsoft division that includes Windows. 
Energy costs depress wholesale prices 
WASHINGTON -A huge drop in energy costs helped push prices at the wholesale level down last month by the largest amount in nearly three years. But with the cost of gasoline rising again, the reprieve could be short-lived. 
The Labor Department reported Tuesday that wholesale prices fell by 1.4 percent itl February as food and energy both recorded big declines. 
But analysts cautioned against reading too much into the Fe)Jruary decrease, saying it was heavily influenced by a warmer-than­normal winter, which cut demand for home heating fuel and helped energy producers rebuild inventories that had been depleted after last fall's hurricanes. 
The govermmmt reported Monday that the average retail price of gasoline soared by 
13.H cents last week to $2.50 per gallon for regular grade. Unleaded gasoline futures are up by 42 cents per gallon since mid­February. 
U.S. ethanol supply insufficient 
After much good fortune, fuel industry braces for some unwanted attention 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -After a spurt of good fortune, the fledgling U.S. ethanol indus­try is anticipating some growing pains that could bring it unwanted attention this summer. 
Ethanol's public profile rose significantly for the better last July when Congress passed an energy bill that mandates the dou­bling of biofuels output by 2012. In January, President Bush gave the industry a further boost with a strong endorsement in his State of the Union speech. And with the imminent phaseout of a petrochemical added to gasoline to reduce tailpipe emissions, more U.S. motorists will depend on the corn-derived fuel than ever before. 
But there's trouble loom­ing: The ethanol industry might not be ready to satis­fy the expected summer­time jump in demand. And by crimping the overall sup­ply of motor fuel, this could contribute to a spike in gasoline pump prices at the start of the country's peak driving season. 

That, at least, is the view of the Energy Department, which issued a report last month detailing the chal­lenges midwestern ethanol producers will have in get­ting their fuel to key mar­kets along the East Coast in the marketplace." gallon, or about 50 cents of the letter sent to the because of railroad, truck­Still, ethanol-related wor­per gallon higher than Energy Department. ing and other distribution rjes hang over the U.S. usual, according to the Oil Dinneen said the industry bottlenecks.

Loeal statistics show police respond to over X,OOO domestic abuse calls each year. However, the Department of Justice estimates only 54 per­cent of partner violence is reported which means it is estimated over 1(>,000 instance of abuse actually occur. 
Gwinn said it is important to stay united as a community and advancing a common goal to create the center in Saint Joseph County and work to end the violence. 
"Fear beeomes the enemy to this vision ... the people here get it, they are good people and there are so many local agencies that support it," he said. "The challenge is to stay tognther to get this to happen."

Both Kirk and Hakoczy said the groups hope to provide Student Affairs with a report or recommendation on how best to deal with their respective researched problems, potential­ly by the end of the semester. 
Gunty said the similar inter­ests of both task groups allowed him to combine their questions into one survey. 
"As I understand it, both con­versations are basieally about how to promote healthy rela­tionships and have a focus on doing something about these things that are obstacles to healthy relationships," Gunty said. "On the one hand, there's gambling, which is not only unhealthy to relationships but to individuals, and the other group sees that so much of relating now has some eompo­nent on the Internet that they're just wondering what effect this has on relationships." 

Gunty said he received an e­mail from one of the survey recipients who ealled its "Healthy Relationships" title a misnomer, beeause respondents were not given time to talk about gender relations on cam­pus. 
Gunty defended the survey 
title, saying that while it might be "a little misleading" beeause of the heavy connotations the phrase "healthy relationships" carries at Notre Dame in terms of gender relations, he still chose the name "because the ultimate concern about these behaviors is their ell'ect on rela­tionships, so we're taking the term ['healthy relationships'] in a much broader sense." 
Gunty said he will present a set of preliminary results to the Cyber Vice Task Force at the group's first meeting Friday. As of Tuesday, only 25 percent of survey recipients had respond­ed.

Bank ow-nership under review-
Associated Press WASIIINGTON -Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is raising concerns about a legal provision that lets companies own a certain kind of bank, ineluding one Wal-Mart Stores Inc. wants to operate in Utah. The Fed chief's comments were aimed at an exemption in federal law that allows companies to own such banks, called industrial loan compa­nies. "The question of whether, or to what extent, the mixing of banking and eommerce should be permitted is an important issue and one that we believe should be made by Congress," Bernanke said. "The decision has important ramifications for the structure of the American financial system and the economy, particularly because any widespread com­binations of banking and com­merce likely would be irre­versible." 
Bernanke's comment came in a written response to ques­tions on that and other issues raised by Hep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., during a February hearing. Bernanke's response, dated Monday, was released to The Associated Press on Tuesday. 
"It is for these reasons that the (Fedl board has encour­aged Congress to review tho exnmption in eurrent law," Bernanke wrote. · 
The Fed ehief addressed the matter in broad terms. He did­n't mention Wai-Mart specifi­cally. 
Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, has l'iled an application to operate an industrial loan company in Utah. The Bentonville, Ark.­based retailer is seeking to set up such a bank so it could process credit card, debit card and electronic check transac­tions from its retail locations. 
Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who retired at the end of January, had urged Congress to elosc the legal loophol1~. Bernanke took the helm of the central bank Feb. 
1. 
On other matters, Bernanke again urged Congress to trim the budget deficit, especially in light of the need for the government to prnpare for the retirement of thn baby boom generation. "I believe that reducing the federal defieit is very important," he said. "I urge the Congress to proceed on that nffort in a timely man­ner." 
Bernanke also said that although the country's massive trade deficits -whieh set record highs four years in a row -"cannot continue to widen forever," these deficits need not trigger a "precipitous decline" in the value of the 
U.S. dollar. Were such a decline in the dollar to oecur, it wouldn't necessarily disrupt financial markets, production or employment, he said.

United States bugged Filipino leader's phones 
American authorities suspected former president Estrada was receiving government secrets from FBI agent 

Associated Press 
MANILA, Philippines ­Former President Joseph Estrada said Tuesday he has been notified by an American court that U.S. authorities bugged his telephone conver­sations with an FBI analyst accused of revealing U.S. gov­ernment secrets. 
The New Jersey court indi­cated it authorized the wire­tapping as part of an investiga­tion into Leandro Aragoncillo last year, Estrada said, adding that there was no suggestion he was under investigation. 
Estrada, who was toppled by a popular revolt in 2001, previ­ously acknowledged receiving American government assess­ments of Philippine political events from Aragoncillo, a 21­year Marine veteran who became an FBI intelligence analyst in 2004. 
"The notice said that my telephone calls with Aragoncillo were wiretapped," Estrada told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. "The wiretapping was author­ized by the court." 
Aragoncillo was arrested in the United States last year. He has been charged with con­spiring to reveal government secrets, acting as a foreign agent and improperly using FBI computers. Those charges carry a maximum sentence of 25 years.

Michael Drewniak, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Newark, N.J., has refused to comment on the alleged wiretapping, which was first reported by the Philippine Daily Inquirer, citing government sources. 
"Even if that were so, I would not comment on it," Drewniak said last week.

Castro welco111es back Cuban baseball team 
Japan defeated Cuba in global baseball event 
Associated Press 
HAVANA -Cubans lined the streets by the thousands Tuesday to welcome their national base­ball team home, waving flags, roaring cheers and clutching flowers. Despite Cuba's loss to Japan in the final, even Fidel Castro was in a jovial mood. 
"There was almost an electrical crisis in this country with all the television sets turned on," the 79­year-old leader joked in his address to the several thousand fans assembled for the home­coming. 
The day after Japan beat Cuba 10-6 to win the inaugural World Baseball Classic, players' wives, children and other relatives greeted them with hugs and kiss­es on the tarmac as their flight arrived Tuesday from San Diego. 
"We'll be back," promised Yadel Marti, who was honored as the tournament's best pitcher, despite playing for a team with no major league players. 
Looking somewhat sad. team­mate Frederich Cepeda said, "those of us in baseball don't like to lose. Victory was so close, but we didn't achieve it." 
The players then embarked on a ride through Havana's streets in a convoy of olive green military Jeeps. With wailing police sirens, thousands of school children, workers and other baseball fans cheered as they streamed by. 
At the homecoming celebra­tion, Castro personally greeted each player, giving each a com­memorative wooden bat manu­factured in their team's honor. The players, in turn, returned to Castro the huge Cuban flag he entrusted to them before their departure, as well as two base­balls signed by all team mem­bers. 
Castro said he had personally watched every single game they played, and "enjoyed, along with millions of citizens, of your feats over there." 
The communist leader cele­brated their participation in the Classic as "a victory against the unfair exclusion" of the team. It initially appeared that tightened 
U.S. restrictions would prevent Cuba from playing. 
It took an appeal by Major League Baseball and a promise by Cuba that any winnings would go to Hurricane Katrina relief to change the U.S. government's mind. 
But even bigger than winning the right to participate was that there were no defections as some had predicted early on, said Angel Iglesias, vice president of Cuba's National Institute of Sports.

It just so happens that the linest pro­fnssor I ever had while I was a student at Notre Dame taught the two-snmester Arts and Letters Core course. Not coinei­dnntally this course was also the occa­sion of signilieant and lasting porsonal and intollectual growth on my part (you know, the kind that is always adver­tised in admissions brochures, but that no one honestly expects to expnri­ence). 
That professor no longer works for the University-to its loss -nor dews Core now exist as anything but a fading ocho of its prior aims. It has sinee been moh~st­od into submission by a coalition of shortsightod students unable to undor­stand its value and or professors lacking the skill and insight to teach it properly. What passes for Core these days (the "College Smninar") is roally just an excuse for profnssors to once again tnaeh to their own disciples and perhaps a few pet interests. 
This is very mueh a sign of the times, because Core in its uncompromised form was one of the University's most demanding courses in terms of professo­rial ability. It required a special kind of instructor -one able to step outside of the narrowness of his own discipline, possessing an appreciation for and skill with interrelationships and holding no small amount of life-wisdom. But what should have been an occasion for the University's greatest minds, those who incarnate Notre Dame's mission, to step forward (the late Hobert Vacca, who was among these and who did teach Core, notwithstanding) more often fell on the shoulders of those who happened to be 

Lance Gallop 
Tidewater Blues 

of lowest departmental rank. 
The rape of Core is regrettable (and a sore point for me, as you may have noticed), but I draw your attention to it now because it is indicative of thn greater and self-exacerbating trend of academic specialization, where eaeh disciple strictly isolates itself from its neighbors (due in no small part to thnir steep learning eurvns) and of the conse­quential losses to our society and cul­ture. 
Computers, and their maintainers, arc an exeellnnt practical ease study of thn phenomena sinen almost everyone inter­acts with eomputnrs on a daily basis, but rarely thinks twice about it. Consider programmers-the men and women whosn chosnn task it is to modiato between the world of information, com­munieations and algorithms and tho normal people who try to use these processes to improve their daily lives. 
Programmers are typically trained in advanced math, computer architeeturn, methodology, a half-dozen programming languages (ideally) of varied propnrties and (if they arn lucky) projeet manage­ment and team coordination. With hard work and about seven years of practical experience, a programmer with this foundation ean become adept enough to produce very high quality work-as long as its intended audience is another programmer. 
You will never lind a Computer Science student-even at the most advanced schools -studying art, archi­tecture~. psychology, sociology and poli­tics as part of her primary training. Even in schools that take a stab at requiring courses in other disciplines­like Notre Dame with its philosophy and theology -there is almost no one in the Computer Science department who makes any attempt at linking these ideas. So colleges churn out program­mers who are very good at the mechan­ics of their art, but who nonetheless miss the point of the entire cmdnavor. 
After all. how can someone design soft­
ware for humans lacking a sound 
undorstanding of how pnopln relate to 
the world around thc~m'? 
It is any wondor, tlwn, that most soft­ware programs ereatn morn problems thon they solvo'? Or that so many user intnrfaeos-for all the quality tlw code beneath thmn-are garbage'? I have encountnred individuals who feared their c:omputnrs, bec:ause the machinc~s bnhaved in ways that they could not understand, and demandnd that users bend to their needs ratlwr than the other way around. And so, whilo thn eomputnr does indeed havn thn potnntial to eomplotely reshap1~ tlw way we work with information, bneausc almost no onn in the linld tho vision to takn it to this point, thn modern computer is stagnat­ing as a glorified elnctronic dnsk. 
Of coursn, the program of study that I have outlinnd above is impractical in the unforgiving business of highnr ndu­cation. Irwn aeknowlndgn thn problnm, then we must also acknowledge that some influnncing factors will change more rnadily than othnrs and that the thrnat of runaway speeialization is too dil'licult and far reaehing to propose a simple solution to it. However, wn must nonetheless demand that the University cease to ignore it, and that the rich resourcns of this institution and of its many departments be put to the task of seeking a better way to 11mbrace inter­disciplinary study, lest the quality of a higher education itself altogetlwr per­ish.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
'Fighting Irish' moniker found offensive 
An open letter to Dr. Myles Brand and the Executive Committee of the NCAA ­
On Feb. 3, 2006, the Tribune Wire Services reported that when Dr. Myles Brand was "asked why Fighting Irish is acceptable at Notre Dame but Fighting Sioux at North Dakota is not, Brand said, "We've never had any Irish people come to us and say, 'We find that offensive."' 
Let this letter serve then as your official notice that some of the Irish (I am one) are indeed offend­ed by a mascot dressed as an undignified lep­rechaun, flitting and prancing all around the foot­ball field or basketball court. Beyond that, we take particular offense with the moniker "Fighting Irish." As an Irish-American Catholic and citizen of both the U.S. and the Republic of Ireland, I am truly insulted by these portrayals of my race, her­itage, creed and culture. 
The term "Fighting Irish" harkens back to the many past oppressions suffered by Irish Catholics, first in the Emerald Isle at the hands of British aggressors and then when Irish immigrants reached these U.S. shores. They experienced oppression and bigotry as they tried to assimilate into American culture. They not only felt extreme prejudice, but many were also victims at the hands of the Ku Klux Klan and similar hateful groups. 
If, as you, Mr. Brand, have also stated, "the NCAA objects to institutions using raciaVethnic/national origin references in their intercollegiate athletics programs," then the NCAA should disallow Fighting Irish and their leprechaun mascot. By taking this stand against Notre Dame, the NCAA will demon­strate that "hostile and abusive" references will not just mean "hostile and abusive (with exemptions allowed)." but will truly attempt to meet its stated goal of no racial, ethnic or national origin refer­ences in their intercollegiate programs. 
As a graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign, I find the NCAA's current ambiguous stance incomprehensible and an anathe­ma to all reasoned persons. If Florida State's Chief Osceola is deemed to be "non-offensive," then how can you possibly rationalize that Chief Illiniwek, for instance, is hostile? Logic dictates that if one Indian Chief is approved then all should be allowed. 
At this point, the NCAA only appears to be unde­niably hypocritical. Let's correct that impression. It is unfathomable to think that "Fighting Sioux" is offensive and, somehow, in the eyes of the NCAA, that "Fighting Irish" is not. 
Please do the right thing and either ban all refer­ences to raeiaVethnic/national origins or just leave them all be.

Feingold motion creates divide 
Stunt is irrational Bush's actions warrant censure 
Last week, Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin brought a resolution to the floor of the United States Senate asking for the censure of President George W Bush. Feingold cited the president's "ille­gal use of wiretap-T 
ping" as the main r~y 
reason for bringing Cahva the resolution to the Senate floor. To cen-Daily Toreador sure the president Texas Tech for something that helps maintain the security of this country is absolutely ridiculous. Feingold is merely Don Quixote fighting his imaginary giants, when in reality they're just windmills. 
Censure is a congressional procedure, which reprimands either the president of the United States or a member of Congress. No loss of power occurs when one is censured; it is merely used as a political tool to publicly condemn some­one's actions. Only one president has bnen censured, Andrew Jackson, and his censure was overturned once Democrats assumed control of Congress. 
Sen. Joseph McCarthy was censured following his reckless attempt<; to identi­fy and expose Communists or Communist sympathizers in America. While on the surface the McCarthyism of the 1950s and President Bush's use of the NSA to conduct domestic surveil­lance might appear similar, the intent behind their actions are dra..'itieally dif­ferent. McCarthy sought to use his posi­tion a..'> a U.S. senator to tend to his own personal views without any thought of the consequences. President Bush, on the other hand, used his domestic spying program to protect this country from those who would seek to destroy it and its citizens. The intelligence collected by the NSA as part of this program only benefits the national security interest of this country and was not used for per­sonal reasons or abused in any way. Do you really think President Bush's approval rating would be hovering in the mid-30s if he truly had access to his political opposition's communications? 
If Feingold really believes this is the correct time to call for censure, and that he has a chance of succeeding in his res­olution, he must really be nuts. It's per­plexing that someone, let alone a sena­tor, would drag this issue up again. Democrats are on the heels of their biggest victory -which was largely self­appointed -in national security in quite a long time. The Democratic Party, as of late, has been notoriously weak on national security. Perhaps that's what happens when you choose flowers over guns, but that's the subject of another column. Not even a month ago, though, the Democrats were condemning the decision to allow Dubai Ports International to manage several ports here in the states. Their use of covert bigotry and casual ignorance of American interests and international  relations won over the American public, and Democrats finally had a victory in a national security matter. 
Rehashing the topic, however, will do nothing more than help mobilize a fal­tering Republican base. After Feingold presented his resolution, the Republican National Committee subsequently sent it out to more than 15 million Republican supporters across the nation. Support for the president was wide reaching and might help the Republicans gain some momentum in the coming months as the mid-term elections near. 
I'm frankly astonished at the amount of time our Congressional members have on their hands. Evidently the prob­lems of education, health care, crime, pollution, declining family values, the war on drugs, worldwide terrorism and a $9 trillion dollar national debt all have been solved so Congress can frivolously spend their time slapping wrists around Wa..'ihington. I'd suggest his constituents in Wisconsin send him a few Sudoku books and a big block of cheese to help him pass the time until this session of Congress is over. 
Besides the timing ofhis actions, I still find it absurd the lengths Democrats will go to hinder our national security. The domestic spying program was used to intercept communications from those in this country that contacted members or suspected members of al-Qaida. Haven't talked to any terrorists lately? Then you have nothing to worry about, so sit down and shut up. Republicans are against any repeat ofthe attacks of Sept. 11. Do we have to step on a few toes to main­tain our security? I say, as does President Bush, that we should do what­ever it takes to keep America safe. The time has come for Democrats to realize that as well. Sen. Feingold, you and your party have beat this horse too many times. Enough is enough.

Sen. Feingold is right. The president ought to be censured. It is a reasonable, just and measured response. It is not impeachment. A censure is a rebuke issued by a legislative body to a government official for misconduct. It carries no legal weight, only the force of public Jason condemnation. But that's Rhode enough. Andrew Jackson got one in 1834. That 
Daily Toreador 
was his time. This is 

Texas Tech 
Bush's. 

I urge the approval of Feingold's resolution. Bush ordered wiretap­ping ofAmerican citizens in 2002. Apart from violating the Fourth Amendment, the president ran afoul of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. 
FISA was set up as a way to give the exec­utive branch a regulated and legal way to wiretap terrorists. Our laws dearly state FISA "shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance ... and the intercep­tion of domestic wire, oral and electronic communications may be conducted." The act set up a court consisting of seven federal dis­trict court judges appointed by the chief jus­tice. They have staggered terms, and come from different circuits (50 U.S.C.A. § 1803). Through the Department ofJustice's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, the attorney general submits sealed tapping request<; for the special court's consideration. You're even allowed to spy right away-as long as you go to the court within three days after. And the court almost never refuses a request. 
But Bush? He went ahead and did it any­way-spied on American citizens by execu­tive order in 2002. Courts be damned. 
And here's the thing-he admits that he did it. Bush must be the first chief executive in history to publicly confess to an impeach­able offense -Ican do what I want to. Mission accomplished. Bring it on. 
Nobody denies the necessity of spying on our enemies. But at the end of the day, Bush broke the law. The president's Constitutional charge is to "take care that the laws be faith­fully executed;" not to make them, to negate some portion of them based on his mood. "All legislative powers herein granted" flow to Congress. 
The White House di<;agrees. War silences law, they say. The basic argument of this administration? In war, the president can do as he damn well pleases. 
Bush's court theorist, ex-Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo, wrote "Neither statute, however, can place any limits on the president's determinations as to any terrorist threat, the amount ofmilitary force to be used in response or the method, timing and nature of the response. These decisions, under our Constitution, are for the president alone to make." From what stone comes this 
miraculous water? There's nothing in the 
"Authorization for Use of Military Force" that 
grant'i Bush such power, certainly no revoca­
tions of FISA. Indeed, Bush could have asked 
for "less" of FISA in the Patriot Act, but did­
n't. 

Does Article I, Section 8 not give Congress 
the authority to define and punish piracies 
and felonies committed on the high seas, and 
offenses against the law of nations; to declare 
war; to raise and support armies, but no 
appropriation ofmoney to that use shall be 
for a longer term than two years; to provide 
for calling forth the militia to execute the 
laws ofthe union, suppress insurrections and 
rebel invasions; to provide for organizing, 
arming and di<;ciplining the militia, and for 
governing such part ofthem as may be 
employed in the service of the United States? 
If all war powers were meant for the presi­
dent, then why are so many of them given to 
Congress? Curious. 
Yoo has missed his calling. The pen of sueh 
a gifted weaver of fantasy might have 
spawned tales of speaking unicorns defend­
ing rainbow bridges, had it not been yoked to 
the more mundane task of defending dynas­
tic prerogative. It is a loss to children every­
where. Did the president always agree with 
Yoo's delusions? Here's Bush on wiretapping: 
"Law enforcement officers need a federal 
judge's permission to wiretap a foreign ter­
rorist's phone, a federal judge's permission to 
track his calls or a federal judge's permission 
to search his property." 
How very curious that the president would 
say such things while fully aware ofhi'> exec­
utive order two years prior! 
Crimes like Bush's were the fears of James 
Madison, main drafter of the Constitution: 
"War is in fact the true nurse of executive 
aggrandizement." He also wrote: "In no part . of the Constitution is more wisdom to be 
found, than in the clause which confides the 
question of war or peace to the legislature, 
and not to the executive department." He 
was president once, too. 
Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the 
Supreme Court: "A state of war is not a blank 
check for the president when it comes to the 
rights of the nation's citizens." 
What could be more dear? Neither the 
Constitution, nor war, nor history justifY the 
president's actions. He knew what he was 
doing and did it anyway. He broke the law. 
Censure him.

The boys am back in town. Like lyrics made famous by the rock band Thin Lizzy, the hotshot duo of brothers Larry and Andy Wachowski made their tri­umphant rnturn to the big screen with thn rnennt relnasn of "V li1r Vendetta." 
Known for both the intdlectual naturn and show-stopping action sequnnces of their films. the Wachowski brothers explodnd onto thn filmmaking scene with tho 1<J<J<) ndease of the critically­<u:daimnd film "The Matrix." Written and directed by the two brothers, "The Matrix" was an incrndibly complex film that somnhow managed to pair philo­sophkal overtones with did-you-just-sec­that aetion soquenees. 
In this manner, the Waehowskis cooked up a recipe to deliver the epistemology of Plato and Dnst:artns to the dot-com gen­nration -start with a base of thumping tnehno musk, stir in gennr­
Brothers Wachowski again teamed up with another famous pair of WBs -the Warner Bros. -in creating "V for Vendetta." 
In keeping with their revolutionary nature, the Wachowski brothers wrote the script and produced "V filf Vendetta," which follows a one-man rebellion against a Big Brother-like government. While they may have missed the mark in terms of philosophy in the "Matrix" sequels, V marks the spot with their lat­est offering. Although the Wachowskis ended the director's chair on "Vendetta" to James McTeigue, they wrote the script and produced the film. "V for Vendetta" is sprinkled with their indelible finger­prints. 
t\lso, McTeigue was the first assistant director on both of the "Matrix" sequels, and is undeniably schooled in all things Wachowski when it comes to standing behind the lens.

Scene Ediror 

Alan Moore stands with Frank Miller as 
one of the pioneers of the modern graphic 
novel. Before their respective seminal 1986 
works "Watchmen" and "The Dark Knight 
Returns," comic books were regarded as 
trifling children's fare. 
Moore's sophisticated and literate approach, however, elevated them into the status of genuine art and brought critical acclaim and commercial success to comic books. He remains one of the medium's most respected writers and continues to produce work to this day. 
Moore started as a writer for DC Comics by lifting one of the company's most obscure heroes, Swamp Thing, out of the muck and grime of obscurity. His work on the series elevated its status and brought the maverick writer critical acclaim, whieh allowed him to braneh out into new ideas. 1981's "V for Vendetta" was among his first major works, bringing to life a dystopian vision of the future that Moore would explore in depth throughout the 10-part series. Like "Swamp Thing," "V for Vendetta" was essentially a serial, though it was one of the writer's first forays into a more defined narrative. 
Moore's most famous and well-renowned work is undoubtedly 1986's "Watchmen," which was originally released as a monthly 12-part series. Often cited as the "Citizen Kane" of comic books, Moore's complex work set a new standard in depth, sophisti­cation and social awareness, altering the public perception of what a comic book could be. 
At the same time that Miller was return­ing atmospheric brooding to the eharacter of Batman (in "The Dark Knight Returns"), Moore was creating a startling well-con­ceived and executed work -"Watchmen" combines cross-media style (like fake news­paper clippings) and filmic tendencies in its complex, arehing narrative. Each chapter is bookcnded by passages from everyone from Nietzsche to Bob Dylan to Einstein, demon­strating the breadth of Moore's cultural (and pop cultural) knowledge. "Watchmen" remains the gold standard of graphic nov­els, and remains a powerful and pertinent work two decades later. 
Since then, Moore has worked on various projects. He has written stories featuring mainstream characters like Batman ("The Killing Joke," a disturbing but insightful reinterpretation of the Joker's origin) and Superman ("Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?"). lie has also released original pieces like "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen," which casts various famous characters from literature as a superhero group. 
llis most substantial work since 
"Watchmen" is probably "From Hell," a 
heavily researched examination of Jaek the 
Ripper. A massive work that runs well over 
500 pages, "From Hell" is annotated 
throughout, demonstrating the depth of 
Moore's study. 
Unfortunately, none of Moore's graphic novels have been satisfactorily been trans­lated into a film version. Up until "V for Vendetta," the Hughes brothers' take on "From Hell," the 2001 film starring Johnny Depp, was probably the best of them. But even that film lacks the consistent narrative focus and depth of research evident throughout Moore's work. 
Most egregious, however, was 2003's "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen," directed by Steve Norrington and starring Sean Connery. Though the literary conceit and basic concept of the original graphic novel is present, much of the creativity and irony that Moore infused was stripped away in favor of standard summer blockbuster trappings. 
Moore has since washed his hands of all film translations of his works, including "V for Vendetta." Since much of his early work is the property of DC Comics, he has little control over whether or not his work gets turned into films. 
Unlike Miller-who was credited as a eo­director on Hobnrt Hodriguez's "Sin City" due to his hands-on involvement in the project See Also 
-Moore dislikes and dis­trusts llollywood, refusing "Scene Feature" to attend even the pre­
'"V For Vendetta' 

mieres of movies based 
in Context"

on his work. 
Hegardless of his disin­terest in Hollywood adap­tations of his books, Moore remains one of the torchbearers of the modern graphic novel and one of the medium's most respected scribes.

SCENE FEJUURE 

Cinematic crusaders leap from comic page to screen 
By SEAN SWEANY Scene Writer 
Some of the most popular films and movie franchises of all time find their ori­gins in comic books. When superheroes and villains leap from the eomic page to the silver scrnnn. stories develop that all can nnjoy, whether they·n~ comic fans or not. 
Batman (1989) 
This Tim Burton film is often described as cheesy, but it remains important because it uslwred in the modern era of wmie book films. Michael Keaton plays a respedable Batman, but Jack Nicholson's perfimnance as the Joker makes this lilm truly mnmorable. The box ollice success of tho caped crusader set the stage for numerous Batman sequels and sparked the gnnesis of many other comic book movies to take advantage of the new market. Burton's imagination keeps the proceed­ings enjoyabln, and his talent at bringing to life the variml aspects of the comic book world makes the lilm worth seP.ing. 
X2: X-Men United (2003) 
This adaptation of the Marvel Comics franehisP. is the seeond in the series, which concerns the struggle between mutants and humans. I>ireetur Bryan Singer crafted "X2" into a firw film by eombining extraor­dinary light scenes with an intelligent, eohernnt story. Well known characters like Wolverine alfld Proli~ssor X are well acted by llugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart and a large group of supporting actors adds interesting subtleties and nuances to the eomplex story. "X2" stands out as a good comic book film because it blends action and story into a serious movie, and because it prompts thought and discussion about treatment of those difl'erent from every­body else. 

Sin City (2005) 
An adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novels, "Sin City" is a movie with a very dis­tinet, violent style that is hard to forget. The movie has a large cast of talented actors, including Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke and EIUah Wood. The stories of all these ehar­aeters intertwine almost seamlessly thanks to Frank Miller's writing and the directing abilities of Robert Rodriguez. Almost com­pletely in blaek and white film except for certain moments. "Sin City" has such a unique style and method of storytelling that it becomes a must-see in the genre. 
Batman Begins (2005) 
The most reeent Batman adaptation, this film depicts the Dark Knight in a different light for a new generation. Christian Bale gives a dark, troubled performance as Bruce Wayne and forces audiences to sym­pathize with the eonditions that shape his path towards becoming Batman. Overall, this is a much darker film than any of the previous Batman installments and brings a serious, adult tone to the series. Director Christopher Nolan is already planning a sequel to follow the same lines of realism set forth in "Batman Begins." 
Superman (1978) 
This film version of the Man of Steel stands out as one of the great comic book movies of all time. Filmed in an era before digital effects, "Superman" withstands the test of time and remains a benchmark for the genre. Christopher Reeve put on one of the best superhero performances ever as both Clark Kent and Superman. Heeve became the face of Superman and embod­ied truth, justice and the American way for countless fans. "Superman" spawned three sequels starring Heeve and a new adapta­tion coming to theaters this summer. 

Spider-Man ( 2002) 
Hising above all the rest of the comic book films to set the bar for any future movies is "Spider-Man." This film gets it right on every level and is truly what a comic book film should be. Director Sam Haimi gave attention to every detail to cre­ate a fantastical world lor the comic book characters to inhabit. Tobey Maguire stars as Peter Parker/Spider-Man and earns the sympathy of the audience for the fate that befalls him. The film's slick combination of action, humor, drama, and tragedy leaves the audience craving more of the web­slinging hero. 
These big screen versions of popular comic books are some of the most loved and successful movies. Films adapted from comic books will continue to dominate the box office, sparking the imaginations and inspirations of viewers both young and old.

'V FOR VENDETTA' IN CONTEXT 

Remember, remember Fawkes day in November 
By MARTY SCHROEDER Scene Writer 
The tap;line for "V for Vendetta" implores moviegoers everywhenl to, "Hernemhnr. rernc~rnber the 5th of Novmnber." The 5th of NovP.mbnr'? As many Anwriean audienees have proba­bly asked. "what happened on the 5th of' November?" Onn only needs to look arross the Atlantic Ocean to Great Britain to find tlw answer. The date cel­ebrates a United Kingdom holiday known as Guy Fawkes Day. 
Tlw aforementionod holiday com­nwmorates the day that Guy Fawkes and his band of conspirators attempted to blow up the Palaeo of Westminster, morn eomrnonly known as the Parliament building. The day chosen for this incendiary action was to take place on the official State Opening of l'arliarnnnt in 1605. Not only would both the I louse of Commons and Lords be f'ull, but the then King James I of England (VI or Scotland) would also be present. 
This was Fawkes' way of protesting the Protestant religion of England and promoting his own Catholicism. But who was Guy Fawkes? 
Fawkns was born in England in 1570 in York and, according to his intnrroga­tion after his eapture in 1605, convert­ed to Catholicism at the age of 16. lie enlisted in the army of the Archduke of Albert or Austria and fought in the Netherlands against the Protestant United Provinces. During his career in the military, hn gained experience in explosivns. This knowledge -coupled with his general military experience ­would allow him to beeome the main organiznr behind what would come to 

I I I
----------­
be known as the infamous "Gunpowder 
Plot." 
This "Plot" was intended to blow up Parliament during its official opening. Fawkes, along with other English Catholics, was angry about the English governmont's persecution or Catholics in England and violence was their answer. The plan was to rent an under­croft below the !louse of Lords, place barrels of gunpowder in this room, wait for the State Opening and set ofT the gunpowder. Before their eover was blown. the group had placed 36 barrels of' gunpowder in this room, which carne in at an estimated 2.5 tons. 
Obviously the plan did not work as expected -the Parliament building is still standing almost 400 years later. For fear that promimmt Catholk politi­cians would be killed in the explosion, a conspirator notified Lord Monteagle ­himself a Catholic -of the plot. Monteagle then told the then-Secretary of State Hobert Cecil, setting off a search of the area. Fawkes was found nearby with a watch, matches and touchpaper. He was arrested, interro­gated and finally hanged for treason and attempted regicide on Jan. 31, 1606. 
The day of his arrest, Nov. 5, 1605 has since become a holiday celebrated in the UK, parts of Canada and other p·arts of the world. The day's festivities include some of the largest professional and amateur fireworks shows, accom­panied by bonfires and the eating of bonfire toffee. Until recently, children used to go door to door before the 5th and ask for "a penny for the guy." 
The holiday no longer has any politi­cal or sectarian motivations and every­one in the UK joins in the celebrations as a chance to shoot fireworks and revel with the rest of the country -in essence, much of the original meaning of the holiday has been lost. 
V, Hugo Weaving's anti-hero in "V for Vendetta," operates within a similar mentality, as the now infamous Guy Fawkes. Violent action, in the mindsets of both V and Fawkes, is the only way to succeed in promoting their agendas -this obviously takes on a different context due to the current geo-political climate. Though it should be noted that "V for Vendetta" is a fictitious story meant to be taken as entertainment, it 

still deals with complex issues and 
places them in a relevant soeio-histori­
cal context. 
As V implores people to "remember, remember, the fifth of November," so too should audiences remember the infamous day in 1605-its importance .resonates as strongly as ever four cen­
turies later.

Associated Press 
The Indianapolis Colts are switching from the NFL's most accurate kick­er to the best in the clutch . 
Taking a key piece from its rival New England, Indianapolis agreed in principle to a deal with Adam Vinatieri, a person close to the Colts said Tuesday night. Vinatieri, who twice hit winning kicks in the Super Bowl for the Patriots, replaces former Pro Bowl kicker Mike Vanderjagt. 
Terms of the deal were not immediately available. The source confirmed the signing with. the AP on 
condition of anonymity because an official announcement had not yet been made. Messages left with the Patriots and agents for Vinatieri by The Associated Press were not immediately returned Tuesday night. 
The Patriots allowed Vinatieri to test free agency r-ather than put­ting a franchise designa­tion on him, which would have cost the team $3 mil­lion next season. 
"It just didn't feel like the right thing to do," coach Bill Belichick said last week at the NFL Combine in Indianapolis. "We considered all our options and decided not to 
IN BRIEF 
Iowa State hires McDermott 

as new hoops coach 
AMES, Iowa -Northern Iowa coach Greg McDermott was hired Tuesday by Iowa State, jumping from the Missouri Valley Conference to the Big 12 after three straight NCAA tournament appear­ances with the Panthers. 
McDermott, 41, was at Northern Iowa for five season. Before his arrival in 2001, Northern Iowa had made one appearance in the Division I NCAA tournament. 
McDermott replaces Wayne Morgan, who was fired Friday after the Cyclones missed the postseason with a 16-14 record. The terms of McDermott's contract were not immediately available. 
Iowa State athletic director Jamie Pollard interviewed two candidates: Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Rob Jeter and McDermott. 
McDermott is a native of Cascade, Iowa, and played at Northern Iowa. 
tag anybody." 
Vinatieri, 33, had been named the team's fran­chise player twice, includ­ing last year, when he was paid $2.5 million. 
Vanderjagt spent all eight of his NFL seasons with the Colts after play­ing in the Canadian Football League. He scored a franchise record 995 points and made 217 career field goals in 248 attempts, the highest accuracy rate (87.5) in league history. 
In 2003, Vanderjagt made all 37 of his field goal attempts, all 46 of his extra point attempts and set the NFL record by extending his consecutive field goals streak to 42. 
But twice in his career he missed critical field goals in the playoffs. In January, he badly missed a 46-yarder in the closing seconds, which would have forced overtime with eventual Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh. 
At Miami, in January 2000, he missed a 49­yarder wide right that would have won the game and sent the Colts into the second round of the play­offs. 
Team president Bill Polian acknowledged last month it was unlikely the Colts would re-sign Vanderjagt, an unrestrict­ed free agent. 
Abraham sent to Falcons 
in three team trade 
NEW YORK -John Abraham finally got what he wanted Tuesday night when the Jets traded the Pro Bowl defensive end to the Atlanta Falcons in a three-way deal with Denvor. 
The Broncos had to get involved for the much-anticipated trade to finally take place. Denver and Atlanta swapped No. 1 picks, with the Broncos getting the 15th overall selection and the Falcons getting pick 29. Then the Falcons sent that pick to the Jets in exchange for Abraham, the player's agent told The Associated Press. 
Atlanta also got middle-round picks in 2006 and 2007. 
The Jets had placed the franchise tag on Abraham for the second straight year. Both sides made it clear they wanted to part ways. 
Last week, the Jets and Falcons started working on a trade, but Atlanta was only willing to give up a second-round pick. 
Germaf!Y anxious to take on the U.S. 
DORTMUND, Germany (AP) -It's only an exhibition soccer match, with the undermanned United States squad as the opponent. 
Still, Germany is filled with angst. 
German fans, stinging from a 4-1 loss to Italy, are antsy heading into Wednesday's World Cup warmup against the Americans. So Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann and his players -who have been heavily criticized on several fronts -are treating the game in bumblebee-colored Signal Iduna Park as more than a prep match. 
"It's a very important game for us," said German forward Michael Ballack, who scored the goal that eliminated the United States from the 2002 tournament. "It's a deci­sive game for our confidence, for the mood in the team."

Defending conference cha111ps tee off season 
Mattia caps with final round 74, places 20th overall in tournament 
By BECKI DORNER Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's golf team shot a final round 339 to fin­ish 13th this past weekend at the Shamrock Invitational hosted by Winthrop University. 
The tourney, which took place at the Par 72, 5842 yard Tega Cay Country Club in South Carolina, was the first of six spring events for the Belles, who won the 2005 MIAA championship during the fall season with an aver­age of 342.6 and placed sixth in last year's NCAA Championships. 
Elon's Samantha Widmer shot an indi­vidual best 
second team as well. 
Despite a below average result for the team based on past performances, Hamilton acknowledged the strength of the rest of the field. 
"The competition level was high," Hamilton said, noting that quite a few of the teams were in Division I. "The golf course was very penal. Once we got comfortable and fig­ured out how to attack the cou.~se we played much bet­ter. 
One individual who dis­played marked improvement over the course of the tourna­ment was Bellino, whose 81 on the third day earned her 50th place -the second high­est finish for the Belles. 
The Belles' next contest is a dual meet versus Northern Kentucky this weekend at NKU's home track Perry Park Golf Course, a long par 72.

"[Mattia's performance was] the finest round I have ever seen a Saint Mary's player have when considering the conditions and time of year," coach Mark Hamilton said. 
Mattia was named MVP of the entire MIAA League in the fall for her third all-confer­ence appointment. 
Nicole Bellino, Kirsten Fantom and Katie O'Brien were named to the all-MIAA 
du(~ to the 
recent cold 
weather. 

Mattia, one of four graduat­ing seniors joined by Bellino. Fantom and McQueen, emphasized the need for the team to have the "confidence to go out and perform the way we know that we can." 
The seniors hope that confi­dence helps them perform well enough to earn the Belles' fourth consecutive berth to the May NCAA Championships in Orlando.

other universities to institute 
similar policies. 
"What Notre Dame is doing 
makes perfect sense," he said. 
"What Notre Dame is doing is 
what I expect a lot of places to 
do in the future. 
Decision-making process 
Freeman said he agreed and 
worried that other schools will 
follow suit because of his 
doubts about the legal logic 
behind the policy change. 
Heisler said the athletic 
department did not consult 
with University lawyers specifi­
cally about this issue but based 
its decision on past discussions 
between colleges and the legal 
field over the issue of protected 
content. 
"There's an awful lot of peo­
ple who are more experts from 
the legal end and the rights 
end that are sort of telling 
institutions that historically we 
haven't done a good enough 

job at protecting our own 
rights to certain things," he 
said . 
Heisler said Notre Dame has 
worked mainly with Collegiate 
Images, a Florida-based com­
pany whose objective is to 
beeome a elearinghouse of 
photographs and video from 
collegiate athletic events, in 
regard to issues of legality and 
rights. 

"They have helped us exten­sively as far as some of the lan­guage [we use I to make it clear what ability you have to use material that you obtain at a game," Heisler said. "We wrote it, and we ran it past them just to ask for some advice. It was more a matter of just trying to set the table and figure out how we can work this out." 
Going forward 
For IrishEyes.com, Frank said the policy changes have had no adverse effect on his relationship with the athletic department. 
"I like to think I have a good relationship with Notre Dame," he said. "On my end, as far as my thoughts are on it, yeah, I think we have an excellent relationship." 
Frank said he will continue to produce full video of player interviews and clips from spring practices, as well as abridged versions of the press conferences. 
"I don't think it's every opportunity for us that's being taken away; it's mainly just those press conferences," he said. "We'll also be able to videotape our interviews we have with players, and so as long as we are able to do some of those things, I think that's a good thing." 
Heisler said those videos are not being restricted because the athletic. department was mainly concerned with the unabridged nature of the press conference videos. 
"I think we're looking at mostly the large settings, espe­cially with Charlie Weis," Heisler said. "Those are the things we were seeing pop up in their entirety. 
"These guys who are doing a one-on-one interview with somebody, we're not worried about that. That's their own enterprise." 
Though he disagrees with the policy, Freeman said Irishlllustrated.com will contin­ue to work in good spirit with the athletic department. 
"We've expressed concerns, and we understand the policy," Freeman said. "We fully intend, of course to go along with those policies."

ND WOMEN'S SWIMMING 
Irish squad unlucky in NCAAs 
Swimmers battle injuries and tough competition in tournament 
By GREG ARBOGAST Sports Writer 
There was no extra luck for the Irish on St. Patrick's Day when they competed in the NCAA championships held in Athens, Ga. from March 16-18. 
On the famed Irish holiday, two of the team's three swimmers who qualified for the championships, junior Katie Carroll and freshman Claire Hutchinson, fell victim to a virus that spread throughout multiple teams at the tournament. It couldn't have come at a worse time for Notre Dame. 
Carroll was forced to swim two of her three events, including her best event ­the 400-meter IM -under the influence of the virus. Carroll was a favorite to earn All-America honors in the 400-meter IM and with good reason as she held the fifth seeded time in prelimi­naries. The effect of the sick­ness was obvious, however, as Carroll's final time was over 16 seconds slower than her preliminary time, drop­ping her all the way to 38th place. 
"To train all year for one event and then get so sick the night before was really frustrating," Carroll said. "It was frustrating knowing that going into the event I would­n't be abiP to perform at my best. It was tough not just for me, but it was tough because I didn't represent the school as best I could." 
Carroll did not walk away from the evPnt empty hand­ed ·as she garnered All­America honorable mention honors, her third straight year to earn at least All­America honorable mention. Thursday evening, Carroll finished the 200-meter IM in 13th place with a time of 2:00.48, the fastest time in school history on a yard­measured course. Carroll also earned All-America honors in the 200-meter IM when she finished in 14th place in 2005 and ninth place in 2004. 
Hutchinson, competing in her first ever NCAA champi­onships, was also forced to swim two of her three events after she got sick. After fin­ishing 38th in the 500-meter freestyle on Thursday evening with a time of 4:51.91, only .16 seconds behind her season best, Hutchinson competed in both the 400-meter IM and 1,650­meter freestyle while under the weather. Hutchinson, however, did not let the virus stop her from posting the sixth fastest time in school history in the 1,650-meter freestyle as she took 25th place with a time of 16:34.92. 
"The virus affected the girls tremendously," coach Carrie Nixon said. "Katie had a shot to win the whole thing, and for her to come out 13 seconds slower is dev­astating especially because her focus all year has been on that event. As for Claire, for her to turn around on Saturday [in the 1,650-meter freestyle] and swim so well was amazing." 
Although it was clear that the virus affected Carroll and Hutchinson's perform­ance, both swimmers showed their desire and toughness just by competing on Friday and Saturday. After spending Friday after­noon in the hospital. the two swimmers returned Friday evening to finish their events. Carroll and Hutchinson were the only swimmers affected by the virus to get in the pool on Friday and Saturday. 
"Tough is the perfect word to describe what they did, and it really shows the quali­ty of their character," Nixon said. "It was a very inspiring thing, and it got a lot of com­pliments from other coaches and swimmers." 
Julia Quinn, the only Irish swimmer not affected by the virus, turned in an impres­sive performance as she fin­ished in 20th place in the 200-meter breast stroke with a time of 2:15.24. Her time was the seventh fastest for the event in school history and just off her season best time of 2:14.27. Quinn also finished in 33rd in the 100­meter breast stroke with a time of 1:03.63. 
. Although Notre Dame was hoping for a better perform­ance at last week's NCAA championships, they walk away from it knowing they can improve and are moti­vated to show just that. 
"We're capable of so much more than we showed last weekend," Carroll said. "I think we're going to show a lot of people that next year."

Wildcat standouts included 
Lindsey Munday, who had 
two goals and five assists, Aly 
Josephs, who scored six 
goals, and Kristen Kjellman, 
who added four goals and 
two assists for Northwestern. 
The goalies on both sides of the ball, Irish keeper Carol Dixon and the Wildcats' Morgan Lathrop, had stellar performances, with 12 and six saves, respectively. 
Senior attack Crysti Foote extended her scoring streak with four goals. 
"I know this is my final year to play," Foote said. "I have been more confident and 
.being a captain, I know that my teammates are always looking to me to make plays and get the team going, so I have a lot more responsibility [this year). Basically, I have been taking more risks and just letting the game come to me." 
Despite their loss to the Wildcats Sunday, Notre Dame fared well in its previous two contests against James Madison and · Loyola Maryland. 
The Irish showed physical and mental vitality with their March 12 win over No. 16 James Madison as they ral­lied in the final minutes of the game to secure a 12-11 win. Foote scored three cru­cial second half goals against the Dukes. 
The 13-9 victory over No. 19 Loyola Maryland March 14 was less harrowing, as the Irish swept through the Greyhounds in front of a crowd of 1,492 at CSTV's annual "Spring Fling" tourna­ment. Caitlin McKinney led the Irish assault with three goals and two assists. Freshman Jilllan Byers tal­lied three goals in the con­test. 
"It was awesome, " Byers said after the game. "I mean, to play the way we did, with such heart in front of two thousand people and on TV, it was just a great way to end our week in Florida." 
The Irish face Canisuius on Saturday at 1 p.m. at home.

"The conditions were really diffieult for both teams to play in," Mainieri said. "It was real­ly eold and windy out there."

The lead would not last. The Haiders scored three runs in the top of the second, all with two outs. With one out, Korpi walked eenterfielder John Kopilchaek, then struck out shortstop Justin Parker. First baseman Jeremy Hamilton then doublnd to left, where Irish outfielder Matt Bransfield misplayed the ball and allowed Kopilchack to score from first. 
"When there's a runner on first base and two outs, your outfielder's only job is to keep the runner from scoring from first on an extra base hit," Mainieri said of the play. "lie got to the ball okay, but then he just dropped it. Maybe his hands were cold."

His final major objective is to fill in lingering questions about the depth chart, made morP compli­cated by several injuries to return­ing players. 
Weis said starting outside line­backer Maurice Crum and reserve linebacker Joe Brockington will see significantly limited repetitions in the spring after each under­went back procedures after last season ended. 
Weis said that while the injuries will limit the depth of the line­backing eorps during the spring, they also open new doors for eval­uating young talent. After senior linebacker starters Corey Mays and Brandon I Ioyte both exhaust­ed their eligibility this fall, Weis said freshmen and sophomores on the defense will have the chance to earn a spot in the starting line­up. 
"I think this is an opportunity for some of those guys that back­ups to make a statement for them­selves," Weis said. "If they don't make a statement for themselves this spring, when the new guys get here, they're going in." 
Notes: 
+ Six starters and two backups will return to Notre Dame next fall for a fifth season, Irish coach Charlie Weis announced Tuesday. 
Defensive tackle Derek Landri, right end Chris Frome and corner­back Mike Hichardson return on the defensive side of the ball, as all three started for the Irish in 2005. 
Frome started six games for Notre Dame before suffering a knee injury in the team's 34-31 loss to USC Oct. 15, 2005. Landri and Richardson started all 12 games for the Irish. 
On offense, Notre Dame's group 
The Haidnrs increased their advantage again in the S(Wenth inning. Third baseman Dan Biedenharn led ofT the inning against Notre Dame reliev(~r Joey Williamson and walked. Then, designated hittor Brian Shoup laid a bunt down tho first base line. Both Williamson and Coopor wont for the ball, leaving l'irst base uncovered and, although second baseman Hoss Brezovsky tried to cover the bag, Williamson's throw ended up bounding into right field. Bieclenharn advaneed to third on the error. 
"We had a miscommunication bntween our first baseman and our pitehcr, which ereated a bad situation," Mainieri said. 
The next batter, rightrinlder Amin Abusafeh. singled. driv­ing in Bindenharn and putting the Raiders up 4-1. 
Tho Irish got a run in the bot­tom of tlw eight on a sacrifice f'ly by Brezovsky that drove in eatehnr Sean Gaston, but wnrP unable to get anything going in the ninth inning against Haider reliever .Jon Smith. 
"lie's n~ally good. There wnn~ a lot of pro scouts hnre to see him. liP pretty much ovnr­matclwd us," Mainieri said of Smith. 
The Irish will bo back in action today at Frank Erk Stadium against Central Miehigan. Freshman David Phelps is oxpected to start for Notre Danw. Thn weather is expectnd to be slightly warmnr, possibly rnachiug tlw low(~r 40s.

of returnees is highlighted by vet­eran reeeiver Hhema McKnight, who suffered a knee injury in week thrnp, against Michigan State and was awardnd a medical red­shirt season. MeKnight led the Irish in receptions in 2003 and 2004 with 47 and 42 catches, respectively. lie has 103 rncep­tions for 1,370 yards in 38 career games played. 
McKnight is joined by oflensive line starters Bob Morton and Dan Santucci, backup tight end Mareus Freeman and reserve lineman Brian Mattes. 
+ WeLc;; said several Irish players are injured and will see limited repetitions in the spring or be held out of practices altogether. 
Freshman reeeiver D.J. llord had an abdominal surgery and likely will miss all of spring prae­tice, Weis said. 
"He might be baek by the end of the spring," Weis said. "But he's not going to be baek for a while, so I figured I'd just go ahead and list him as a doubtful for the spring." 
Frome's knee injury will keep him out of spring practices, and sophomore reserve linebacker Abdel Banda also suffered a knee injury that will prevent him from practicing. 
Starting left end Victor Abiamiri had a minor knee surgery after the Fiesta Bowl, and Weis said he is "close to 100 percent." 
"I might pull off of him a little bit, but he's ready to go," Weis said of Abiamiri. 
Weis said he will keep offensive lineman John Sullivan out of eon­tact drills after the junior under­went a shoulder operation in the olfseao;;on. 
Sophomore running back Justin Hoskins and freshman cornerback Kyle McCarthy will be limitnd by shoulder injuries, and Mattes ha<> a foot injury that will limit his practice time.

Questions, optimism mark start of spring practice 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Editor 
Irish head coach Charlie Weis kieked off the beginning of the spring football schedule Tuesday at Notre Dame's annual spring media day, saying his main objec­tive liJr thn coming wenks will be to raisn the team's expectations. 
"I think that last year the li>ot­ball tnam just didn't know at this point whether they were going to be any good or not," Weis said. ''I'm hoping they're not satisfied with the season they had last year. I know that I'm not satisfied with the season that we had last year." 

Weis said he installed a large banner in the Guglielmino to help motivate the Irish players. The sign reads, "9-3 is not good enough." 
''I'm hoping this time around that raising the expectations 
should be a rather simple task," he said. "We return 17 guys that are basically starters -nine on defense and eight on offense. We should expect a much hlgher level of performance this spring." 
The goal was one of four Weis highlighted for the team's 15 prac­tices over the next month leading up to the annual Blue-Gold game April 22. The first practice begins today at 5 p.m. at Cartier Field. 
He began by saying he will con­centrate on dividing his time equally between diflerent aspects of the game in the coming weeks, not solely focusing on the offense. 

"1 probably didn't do a very good job being a head coach [last] spring," he said. "I think I did a pretty good job being an in.<;taller of the offense, but I don't think I did a very good job as a head coach. This year, I think I'll be able to spend more time on special teams and more time on defense than I did last year." 
Weis said his second goal is to "seU~scout" his own team to elimi­nate unnecessary plays and improve in several areas. 
"We've analyzed our 2005 sea­son, and there's some obvious deductions that slap you in the face," he said. "We have to fix the problems we had last year. We also have to expand our paekagns.
