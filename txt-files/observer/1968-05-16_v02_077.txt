U.S. envoy to the Paris Peace Talks, Averell Harri­man, led off the second round of the talks by accusing the Hanoi delegation head, Xuan Thuy, of wasting time by "rehashing old grievances and distorting history." 
Thµy responded 'with what has been termed by ob­servers as "one of the toughest statements ever delivered by the Communists." Each side listed the conditions they 
considered necessary for reaching possible agreement. Numbered among the American proposa!S were the right of South Vietnam to_decide its own affairs and a peace based on the 1954 Geneva Treaty. Communist stipula­tions included a halt to all bombing attacks and recon­naissance flights, an end to attacks from the sea and from below the Demilitarized Zone and complete U.S. withdrawal from the DMZ.

The s'ocial Commission will 
also sponsor a new Spring event on the second weekend in May of next year. This event is to be called the Grand Prix and will be modeled after the Euro­pean road race ofthe same name. 
"The only difference," said Lanwermeyer, "will be the cars. We have obtained twenty"-go-carts and the University's permission to use the campus roads for the 
. race. Each hall will be given a cart and all they have to do is · tune it up and provide the driv­ers." He said that the race will be held on the Sat. afternoon of the Fresli.man, Sophomore, Jun­ior Prom weekend and there will be a trophy given to the winning hall by the winner of this year's Indianapolis 500 race. The Soc­ial commission, which operates 
out of Studen.t Government funds, has a· yeariy budget of over $75,000. Lanwermeyer said that _every event is budgeted to break even. When asked if any of next year's concerts would be 
held in the new. Convocation Center, Lanwermeyer said: "No, because we have never even sold out a concert in Stepan Center which only .seats 3800. The Con-· 
vocation Center will hold 11,500 
and will cost a lot more to rent. 
How can we realistically hope to 
sell more seats in there than we 
already do in Stepan?"

I .  

Monday night five friends of Eddie Kurtz presented his play The Rocking Horse in the Law Auditorium. The play, which was also presented last night at Webster's Last Word, is supposed tobe a re­
.· peat ofNo Exit and some in the audience disliked it for that reason. 
/ 
·There are five characters in the play, all trapped in one room, cared for by another character named Smiley. One of the five is new to the room and the play revolves around his eventual submis­sicin to the room and its rocking horse, an absurd but relaxing occu­pation. At first John, the new arrival, wanted to reason his way 
. out 6f the roorn but in the end he.rides the horse as the others do, not because .it goes anywhere or upHfts but because riding the horse is soni.ething to do. · · 
The point of the play, whether it is Sartre's or not, is disappoint­ing, probably T)eca!lseTf Isif'frue'one :··There is~·somel:hillff:abCii:iC­, man that puts him in aroom without an exit, yet makes him expect · 
· one. Possessed of a bit of the divine, he wan ts to be totally divine, eventually arriving at the point of being rnost human when he thinks he_:s more than that. Hitler was the epitome. , 
Ultimately, nothing seems to work and the rocking horse is left. Such a realization do.es not make the horse acceptable, even if it in~st be ridden. Things stay very much the same, causes coming up against blank watii after short gains but not before they have been negated by the causes· emanating from opposite principles. What goes unnoticed is that the sameness is the result ofeffort. 
Eugene McCarthy, for example, will not .receive the Democratic Party's nomination for president; but his campaign probably served. to make the eventual nominee a better candidate than he would

When questioned regardi·ngthe possibility ·of being deferred as a teaching assistant, Fr. Beichner said that occupational deferments are granted only for full tin1e teachers. Such a deferment re­quires a confirmation from the Dean of the college where the person is employed that the sub­ject is a full time teacher and that he cannot be replaced. The decision is left to the conscience of the Dean, but it .is the policy of the Selective Service that no 

one can ·be a full-time teacher and a full-time stu_dent concur­rently. There is no provision for deferring fraching assistants as such. "What often happens," said . Fr. Beichner, '.'is that if a parti­cular' board does not need men, they may let teaching assistants ride for a long time, or even, 
perhaps, defer them. But there 
is nothing in the law that re­
quires thein to do so. So when a

(Editor's Note: Muhammad Ali, world heavyweight boxing champion to some, Black Muslim minister to · others and neither to still others, will address a Notre Dame·audience Sunday at 4 p.m. He will speak from a platform erected just in front ofthe Stepan Center's main parking lot. in case of rain, the event will be moved to the Fieldhouse. Muhammad's topic is, "The Solution to the Black and White Problem as Taught by Elijah Muhammad. ") 
BY TERRY O'NEIL He sounded tire:d, almost exhausted, as he answei::­ed the -telephone iast Saturday. Perhaps its ringing-~ \ had awa~~ned him. Nevertheless, Muhammad 'AI{· '\_ (ask Eniie Terrell what happens when YO;\! call him , Cassius Clay) was on the line. -­'\ It was the sixth time in 10 days I had called in an ­____ ~to· schedule him for a speech µere. Belinda (his · 20-year-o _ wife) and Herbert Muhammad (his former manager 'an ow-housekeeper) were, by now, first­:.-.-name acquainta~~-­Muhammad Ali does not spend much time at home these days. And, because he does not possess the abundant_ \vartderlust of his camel-driving religious forefathers in 'Africa, it was a weary man who mum­bled, "Hello."' ­Weekdays, and even some weekends, are for travel. The man who built his fame as the Louisville Lip and discarded that image during three years of title de­fenses now sustains himself as the Muslim Mouth, "I can_ make about $10,000 a week these days ifl really hustle," he says. At some of the bigger schools, like UCLA, I can get $2,500 for one appearance. And at s_chools as small as C.W. Post, I've gotten $1,000." Indeed, money has become critical for the man .who once posed on the cover of Sports Illustrated surrounded by a million dollars. The first three ques­tions he asked me were (ih order): "How big will the -­-crowd be? Do you have _any Negroes there? How much can you afford to pay me?" --­'~I made $2,500,000 fighting and the government took90 per cent of it"he explained. "Now I'm giving them the other 10-per cent au._d everything else I can raise just so I can e_xercise a right they should give me --,:\rithdut any· questiOriiC' --:~ ­"So far, I've spent $90,QOO of my own money and $100,000 I borrowe,d from Elijah Muhammad (Amei­--,::o:.-ica's Black Muslim leader) in appealing my draft sta­tus." -­"Besides that, Hayden Covington (his ex-attorney) is suing me for $280,000. The man's nuts. He says I· _owe him legal fees -for the past five years. In that

whole time, he never won one case for me." "Then, l'U still be paying my first wife $I ,250 a month for the next eight years." That's $I 50,000 in alimony over-.! 0 years. 
Saturday, it _i1ppeared that the whole deal was just too much for him. Earlier in the· week, Judge J.P. Coleman of ~h_e U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, "There ha3 been -no administrative process 
_which Clay has not sought .·.. in an unsuccessful at­tempt to evade-and escape from military servi_ce to his country. Being 'entirely satisfied that he had been fairly accorded due process of law, and without dis­crimination,. we affirm his conviction." 
Ali has traveled a long, complicated and frustrating 
· legal road. In January, 1964, he flunked an Army mental test and said he "had some trouble drawing ­those boxes." Two months later, he flunked the exam again and was classified -1-Y. 
In February, 1966, the Army lowered its mental standards and Ali became I-A. Three weeks hence, his local board in Louisville, Ly., refused to brand him a conscientious objector. The next month, he appealed his classification on grounds of hardship and service as a Black Muslim minister. Both appeals de­nied. 
In January, 1967, his local board and the Kentucky State Board each turned down another conscientious objector appeal. In March, -a U;S. District Court spurned Ali's claim that his local board included-no Negroes. A few days later, Muhammad's records were 
transferred to Houston, his·ne:yy residence. · -The Houston board ordered him to report for in~ duction and-on April 28 he stood in line at the fed~ 
' era! ofijce building. When flis name was called, Ali re­fused to take the traditional step forwa~d,' thereby in­curring a maximum penalty of five years in prison and 10,000 fine. -­· Oil-April 29, the World Boxing Association strip­ped the champ of his title and threateni;:d to ban any boxer who fought him or any:promoter who sched­uled him. · 
. -Since' then, he ha-s filed-several more appeals-all unsuccessful.­
And_ so, last Saturday, his voice seemed to be say-· ing, '_'Cut the gloves off and throw the towel in." The -U.S. _government had done what Liston, Patterson, 
_London, Mildenberger, Cooper, Chuvalo, Terrell and Foliey could not. Uncle Sam had whupped Muham­mad. · 
"I'm just getting ready to go to jail now," he sigh­ed.."We're getting a few things straightened up around _the house and I'll make a few more spe~king appear­'a,nces.-My lawyers told' me we only got one more_·· appeal left and that's the Supreme Court. After that we're done." · 
There was a long silence. It was like-watching the 
world's last dinosaur die a slow death on the beach or -watching theYapkees of today struggle to stay out of last place. What do you reply when the self-acclaimed 
Ingold_ on his·per--­sonal stationery --is this emblem. Has Muhammad Ali hung up his gloves for a higher crown?

"We_ still get a chance," he said, coming alive. "I got the same lawyer Martip Lµther King had_ (Chauncy -' Heskridge) and he knows what he's doin:'. I got the ' ·

'Angelo Dundee caught in the middle,boxingno longer holds great attraction for. Muhammad. ­
"I don't think too much about.it anymore: Right now, I'm just tryin' to meet people and spread the word of-Allah: If I go to jail, I'll spend most of my time readin' th_e Koran and studyin' all the prayers we have.
