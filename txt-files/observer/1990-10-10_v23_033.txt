Applause for team shows 
NO's integrity 
With six seconds left to go, I never stopped believing that we'd pull it off. 
Neither did anyone else around me. I guess that's why I felt so empty after the 
Siobhan 
final play of the game 

Saturday, as Derek McCarthy Brown pounded his News Copy Editor fists over and over again in agonizing frustration. 
It wasn't his fault--everyone in that stadium knew that the last six seconds of the game couldn't make up for an hour's worth of mistakes. 
It was a moment of awkward uncertainty for everyone. The Stanford players and fans were going nuts over their unexpected victory, as the mighty Notre Dame football team, humbled, headed back to the locker room. 
And then, out of the stunned silence, the clapping began. I've never felt such immense pride as I did at that moment in being a part of the Notre Dame family. 
That applause symbolized every reason why I chose to attend this University. We, though defeated, clapped in the spirit of fair play and good sportsmanship. The spirit of our response was something that none of the T.V. cameras could have captured on film, or perfectly executed plays could ever hope to replace. 
That took class. That took ND. 
Notre Dame is more than just a school with an incredible football team. It is a body of students committed to integrity. We are the dreamers, the competitors, the involved. We are the players in life who can take a loss in stride and move on to win in the end, anyway. 


As a freshman, I have slowly learned that 
everyone here is faced with challenge. Those 
of us used to making straight A's are now 
making C's. Those of us to being first 
string don't even get to play anymore. 
Those of us used to winning have lost for 
the first time ever. And it hurts. 
The one (and perhaps only) thing that I've 
realized since I've arrived is that we are 
here to learn from our mistakes. We must 
stand behind our ideals. All of our big 
speeches at the beginning of the year won't 
mean anything without actions to back 
them up. 
Don't flinch. 

Learn from the valedictorians and team 
captains in this world. Do the best you can 
do. Be proud of the results of your work, 
whether good or bad. No matter how 
difficult, work together and challenge 
others with an attitude of good 
sportsmanship, not cut-throat opposition. 
More importantly, applaud those who 
beat you. Learn from the fierce opposition 
at the other end of the arena. 
You never know, you might perhaps wind 
up teaching them a thing or two.

Sexual harassment of female students at the Naval Academy is widespread, and some victims don't complain openly for fear of reprisal, according to an in­ternal academy report released Tuesday."In such a cli­mate it is not surprising that some midshipmen have lost the ability to distinguish a blatant incident of sexual ha­rassment from routine pranks," it said.

Most people who lose weight gain it back, dietician says 
By CLAIRE ROBINSON 
News Writer 
Ninety-five percent of all in­dividuals who lose weight gain it back within a year, according to Becky Cook, a therapist and dietician. 

People put the weight back on because they discontinue their program when they have at­tained their goal, she said. A good eating program is one which the individual can follow for the rest of his life, Cook ex­plained. 
Cook, an employee of the Helpful Options For Problem Eaters (HOPE) program and of Memorial Hospital, spoke Tuesday along with Denis Ellis, chef of University Food Services. Their demonstration concerned "Fad Diets vs. Good Diets: learning to effectively plan and organize your meals." 
While Ellis provided instruc­tion and demonstration on preparing breakfast, a brown bag lunch, and supper, Cook spoke about the drawbacks of fad diets and the assets of healthy ones. 
In the 1980's, the fad diet in­dustry made about $110 billion, Cook said, and this profit is in­creasing. The creators of the diets make them sound good, said Cook, but the information they provide does not necessar­ily have to be true to print. The FDA does not have power to 

regulate things in print, she said. 
Cook cautioned listeners about the two categories of fad options. Diet pills act as ap­petite suppressants, but they also cause high blood pressure, a problem which many over­weight individuals already face. Fad diets offer quick solutions with instant gratification, but they often rid the body of mus­cle or water weight, instead of body fat. 
In addition, fad diets fail to teach the individual to perma­nently modify the eating habits which caused the weight gain in the first place. Consequently, the individual should not expect to keep the weight off for long,
she said. 
Cook commented on metabolism as well, stating that eating breakfast instantly raises one's metabolism for the day. On the other hand, two days of eating nothing results in a 40 percent reduction in metabolism. 
"There is no quick easy way to lose weight, because we want to lose body fat, not water or muscle," said Cook. One can recognize fad diets by their sensational claims, extremely rapid weight loss, lack of one or more of the four food groups, and requirement of special foods, books, devices, or fees, she said. 
Cook described the ideal weight loss program as one containing at least 1,200 calo-

ries per day from the four food groups, acceptable foods based upon a person's preferences and accessibility, elimination of bad eating habits, an exercise program, and new habits which can continue for a lifetime. 
Ellis provided helpful advice on how to improve one's eating habits. He began by preparing breakfast while his assistant set the table. He explained that "you have to be organized in the kitchen ... and create a con­ducive environment to bring the family together." He recom­mended setting the table and preparing the meal, as much as possible, the night before. 
"Meals should have eye ap­peal," said Ellis as he placed a slice of orange on the rim of a glass of juice. "The family can come down to a table that looks inviting...then we can create the good habits," he said. 
Ellis prepared breakfast, a brown bag lunch and dinner. He pointed out that the prepa­ration of a healthy meal does not take much time. "Combine practicality with variety," he said. 
"Vary your lunches so that 
you don't get bored with them," 
added Cook. "It's hard to 
change old habits. It's not 
easy, it's not fast, it takes ef­
fort, it takes time," she said.

asserted.

Baltic states "prepare politi­cally, intellectually, and legally" for negotiations between the states and the Soviets on inde­pendence. He said his "legal po­sition is ambiguous" because during negotiations he cannot represent Estonia due to his membership in the Supreme Soviet. Alternately, he is viewed in Moscow as a member of the separatist movement. 
Grazin said he is optimistic about independence for the Baltic states. He said that "I am a politician," and that "politicians are professional optimists." He said politics without the probability or pos­sibility of success "would be a waste of time and nerves." 
The 500 day plan toward a market economy underway in the Soviet Union is "the only way out" of the country's des­perate economic situation, ac­cording to Grazin. He said that over the last two or three years "Gorbachev has wasted his time reserves," and that "for citi­zens, this winter will be very difficult" in the U.S.S.R. 
Grazin stated he thought con­servatives in the government will end up "unemployed," and that being that the most power­ful of them will likely just retire due to their age. Grazin said he knew of mid-level apparatchiks in Czechoslovakia who are presently making their living driving taxis. 
WEAR IT WITH CLASS! l 
Low productivity in the Soviet Union is due to "psychological factors," said Grazin. He said citizens are unsure of the eco­nomic and political future of their country and have no trust in their leaders, "this govern­ment in particular," who have lied to them repeatedly. 
· Grazin said now "is not the proper time for United States investment" in the Soviet Union, and that the anticipated effect of such investment is "overestimated." He said in­vestment by the U.S. would be more helpful "five to ten years down the road" when the Soviet market is prepared. 
More helpful assistance from the U.S., according to Grazin, would be "intellectual assis­tance" in teaching managers in Soviet financial institutions market strategies. 
Grazin said that he intends to learn more about American law while at Notre Dame. In his leisure time, Grazin would like to attend some student theater productions as well as classical plays to gain insights into American culture by observing their interpretations. 
Grazin, a professor of law at Tartu State University in Esto­nia, is at Notre Dame after be­ing named the Paul J. Scheir/Fort Howard Corpora­tion distinguished visiting pro­fessor of ethics at the Notre Dame Law School. 
Grazin's wife, Elena, is a lawyer as well as a specialist in American language and litera­ture. They have a two-and-a­half year old son whom they in­tend to enroll in nursery school to interact with American chil­dren.

The Persian Gulf crisis has left Notre Dame's foreign study program in Jerusalem in a cloud of uncertainty. 
On Saturday, the State Department issued a warning suggesting that Americans avoid travelling in the Persian Gulf and Israeli-occupied terri­tories. "We don't know yet" how the Jerusalem Program scheduled for the Spring semester will be affected by this warning, said Isabel Charles, associate provost and director of Foreign Study Programs. 
Charles said that her office will "keep in touch with the State Department" to monitor the situation and will see if the terns are present in humans," he said. He added, "masculinity and femininity is not a one-line scale," implying one does not exist at the expense of the other. 

Homosexuality in humans is not however caused by hormone imbalances as it is in other mammals. "By the time you get up to primates," he said, "they're almost emancipated from hormonal control . . . Humans for all practical pur­poses are emancipated from hormonal control." 
NO Jerusalem program left uncertain by Gulf conflicts 
warning is still in effect at the end of this semester. 
Students who attended the program's informational meet­ing were told that the program will take place "only if it is safe," said Charles. 
She also said that if the pro­gram proceeds as scheduled and then the situation in the gulf worsens, the students would be brought home. 
Charles said that of the min­imum ten applications needed for the program to take place, five have been received so far. The application process will continue through Oct. 15. 
She added that no other for­eign study programs will be af­fected by the gulf situation.

"Everyone recognizes that there are many ways to mea­sure the quality of undergradu­ate education; one of the best however is student satisfac­tion/retention rates," said William Hickey, President of Saint Mary's College. "To note that Saint Mary's College is number one among a group of approximately 135 institutions in this characteristic is a signal honor," added Hickey.

tal enrollment. Financial Aid played a key role in this cate­gory. Forty-four percent of Saint Mary's students are recipients of financial aid. 
Determinations for selectivity were based on rejection rates, average Scholastic Aptitude and American College Testing Assessment Tests, as well as high school class standings. 
The mean SAT score for Saint Mary's is 1025. Twenty-five per cent of the freshmen grad­uated in the top ten per cent of their high school class and over sixty-two percent in the top quarter of their class. 
Saint Mary's was the only women's college rated in the Midwest's top fifteen. Hickey expressed the College's enthu­siasm for the results of the poll. "As an institution which

Two other Indiana institu­tions joined Saint Mary's among the best in the Midwest regional category; Valparaiso University ranked fifth, while Butler University ranked twelfth in the study. 
In all, this year's U.S. News and World Report study pro­duced fourteen groupings of colleges and universities, cate­gorized by size, selectivity, types of degrees offered, dollar amount of campus research, and region. A total of 1,37 4 four-year schools were included in the study.

EDITORIAL 

Student band policy strikes a bad chord 
Is your favorite student band playing off-campus this weekend? Did you want to take a night off from the usual crowded off-campus social gatherings and just listen to some of the best musical talent at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's? Thanks to the Office of Student Affairs, you probably know they're performing. 
Over the summer, Student Affairs banned campus bands from advertising performances at off-campus bars, effectively destroying their only means of gener­ating interest. This action is ridiculous. 
Without the opportunity to advertise on campus, student bands have little or no chance to publicize their performances. Many band members, perform for the fun, and money they receive for the performance is usually applied toward equipment rental. When no one attends a performance, the band loses money. When the band consistently loses money, it becomes hard to continue performing. 
Last year, Student Affairs permitted student bands to advertise but changed its policy because it conflicted with another university policy prohibiting bars from advertising on campus. It was argued that these advertisements promoted not only the band but also the bar in which the performance was being held. 
It seems quite strange, then that the University not only allows but also supports advertisements for student bands at the Alumni-Senior Club, which is, despite all University attempts to disguise it, a bar. 
It is also strange that the University speaks of grand attempts to improve the social opportunities for students and then discourages an excellent opportunity for social interaction like band performances. 
The Office of Student Affairs should reinstate last year's policy. This policy stated that a band may advertise a performance at an off-campus bar as long as the focus of the advertisement is the band's performance and not the establishment itself or the the fact that alcohol will be served. 
Many students already choose to escape campus by patronizing off-campus bars. It is silly for the Admin­istration to think that advertisements for student bands will create a mass exodus of students seeking out alcohol. Student Affairs should reinstate the policy and then concentrate on improving the campus social situation. It's time they faced the music.

Exclusive ticket policies reflect elitism 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in regard to the foolish poli~y governing admit­tance to football games. I un­derstand that a section of the stadium is allotted for the stu­dents, and great pains are made to make this area a ho­mogeneous conglomeration of undergraduate and graduate students. However, should a student be unavailable or un­willing to attend a game, I don't see the problem in giving a ticket to a non-student. 
I gave my roommate my Stanford ticket so that her fam­ily, who had driven fourteen hours to visit her, could ac­company her. They were turned away from the game. Somehow this was not the reception they expected from the "family-ori­ented" campus. I'm not sure why Notre Dame feels that my roommate's family would have tainted the crowd. They cheer­fully took their money for con­cessions while the poor trav­ellers watched the game from 
The best seats in the Huddle. I have an uncomfortable suspi­cion that the policy is based on elitism, so that attendance ex­cludes all but wealthy alumni and bona-fide Irish students. I hope I am mistaken. 
Margaret Stein Off-campus Oct. 6, 1990 



Reflections on art exhibit ignorance 
Dear Editor: 
This letter is in response to the Inside Column written by Florentine Hoelker (The Observer, Sept. 28). 
I am sure I express the opin­ions of the vast majority of art, art history and design majors on campus who were outraged by the blatantly ignorant views expounded by Mr. Hoelker in his column. His editorial on the value of twentieth century art represents. not only poor judg­ment of an editorial subject, but also the author's immature appreciation of modern art. 
My fellow artists and I found the entire article offensive. Mr. Hoelker exhibits a knowledge of art that appears to have ma­tured not far beyond third grade level. His ignorance is far beyond anything I have ever encountered on this campus, so much so that it makes me won­der how someone with such a narrow view of the finer arts was accepted into such a pres­tigious university. 
I would venture to guess that his idea of art fails to diverge past Michelangelo, Leonardo and the Classical sculpture of ancient Greece. He seems to appreciate nothing that may cause him to observe with more 
than just his optical faculties. 
There is more to art than just orderly colorful forms on can­vas or smoothly sculptured marble figures. Since the dawn of time, art has served far more than the mere aesthetic purpose Hoelker has assigned it. Social, political and religious functions have always been at the vanguard of artistic works, and only in the past few hun­dred years have personal fac­tors evolved into a more 

, prominent role. In his column, Hoelker fails to show any attempt at under­standing the "heaps of scrap metal," as he calls them, that enhance the beauty of our cam­pus. In his failure to open his mind to varying form of artistic expression, Hoelker not only nullifies his entire editorial, but he betrays his utter lack of artistic knowledge whatsoever. The type of ignorance he has displayed is quite intolerable in this day and age. 
All art is not beautiful by mere aesthetic standards. Often, an effort is needed on the part of the observer to ap­preciate a specific work. Even the Mona Lisa is more than just a pretty picture, but this aspect seems as lost to Hoelker as the National Championship is to this year's New York Yankees. I therefore suggest that the next time Hoelker finds himself be­fore a work of art that he make some sort of attempt, however feeble, to understand what he is viewing. He is not required to like what he sees, but he might at least learn to appreciate its content and craftsmanship. 
I cannot be sure that Hoelker will ever appreciate art for what it is, but I am sure of one thing: no one with any respect for the fine arts appreciated his commentary in any way.

'Irs interesting to hear the way the world argues, agitates and persuades; how it threatens, how it shams and lies; how everybody is right and doesn't want to hear the other side.'

Sorin, Alumni and Grace dominate men's football 
By RENE FERRAN 
Sports Writer 
The third week of men's in­tflrhall football action is com­plete and front runners have bngun to emerge for the differ­ent league titles. Sorin, Alumni and Grace are close to clinch­ing their respective league championships. 
ROCKNE LEAGUE 
In a battle of undefeateds, Sorin came back from a 7-2 halftime deficit to beat Fisher 14-7. Sorin scored first on a safety when the Green Wave had the snap go over punter Rick Ebert's head and through the end zone. 
Fisher's points came just be­fore halftime, when the Otters fumbled an option pitch at their 10. Linebacker Gene Hichards recovered for Fisher and on the next play Mick Grlllln ran for the touchdown. Don McGhan added the PAT. 
"This game was a bummer from our standpoint," said Fisher coach Ebert. "Our of­fense stunk it up; we didn't !lven completfl a pass. We were fortunate to score when we did." 
Fisher had the ball to start thll second half, but Otter de­fensive end Mike Murphy's fumble recovery at midfield gave Sorin its chance. The Ot­ters scored the go-ahead touchdown on Vic Lombardi's 13-yard run. Sorin then sealed the win on its next possession with a 65-yard touchdown pass from Kevin Kramer to Lom­bardi. 
"The one thing I can say is that I am happy to come away with a win in a situation where we did not execute well at all," stated Sorin coach Kramer. "That, however, says some­thing about our team, when we can win without playing our best." 
Carroll kept its playoff hopes alive by defeating Pangborn 8­
0. Tom Sullivan broke through the Violence line and blocked a Pangborn punt through the end zone to give the Vermin a 2-0 halftime lead. 
In the fourth period, the Vermin sacked Pangborn's quarterback on fourth down at the Violence five. On the subse­quent play, Sullivan ran for the touchdown to provide the final margin. 
Vermin coach Mike Baumer was especially pleased with the play of his defense, which only gave up two first downs to Pangborn. He said he looks forward to the upcoming off week in order to prepare for Carroll's upcoming game ver­sus Sorin. 
LEAHY LEAGUE 
Alumni clinched an opportu­
nity to defend its interhall championship by defeating Zahm 20-8. The Dogs stopped Zahm on its opening drive and then Chris Jeford blocked Greg Bachman's punt. Paul Nick­odemus recovered for Alumni at the Zahm 20. Four plays later, Dave Ludwig scored from five yards out. 
In the middle of the second quarter, Ludwig capped a 50­yard Dog drive with a 12-yard run, and in the third period, Alumni iced the victory on a Ludwig 15-yard rush. 
"Our team played well, we played a good Zahm team and we hope to sustain our level of play through Keenan in two weeks," said Dog coach Paul Szyperski. If Alumni defeats or ties the Knights, it will win the Leahy League. 
Zahm's points came late in the fourth on a five-yard pass from Matt Lahey to Paul Shuga. Matt Seng added the PAT run. 
"Just like last game, we had a punt blocked and all of a sud­den, early in the game, we're down by a score," said Zahm coach Dan Stopar. "Coming from behind in this league is very difficult." 
Keenan upped its record to 1­
0-1 in its new division with its 
6-0 victory over Cavanaugh. 
The Knights stopped Ca­
vanaugh on fourth and one at 
the Knight 40 in the fourth 
quarter. After driving to the 
Cavanaugh 40, Mike Maier 
found wide receiver Pete Knight 
for the winning score. 
PARSEGHIAN LEAGUE 
Off-Campus seriously dam­aged Morrissey's chances of re­turning to the playoffs by tip­ping the Manor 7-6. The Crime took the opening drive 65 yards to grab the early 7-0 lead. Brian Doherty took Bob Al­lard's screen pass 30 yards for the score. Bob Topel added the PAT. 
Morrissey came back just be­fore halftime on Jamie McMillin's five-yard pass to Scott Taylor. The PAT failed due to a bad snap, the differ­ence in the game. 
"We played quite well," said Manor coach David Shaw. "In fact, we controlled the ball most of the second half [b]ut they came up with ·t~~ key interceptions and basically stopped our drives from get­ting close to field goal range." 
For Crime coach Tom Helms, the key to the game was Off­Campus' ability to adjust to Morrissey's potent passing game. 
"They threw pretty well against us in the first half, but we made the necessary adjust­ments ... and were able ... to shut their passing game down afterwards," said Helms. 
Grace virtually locked up a playoff spot with its 13-0 vic­tory over Dillon. After a score­less first half, Grace broke onto the scoreboard midway into the third period on Jim Kossler's 15-yard pass to Jeff Burns and Bob Sweeney's PAT. 
In the fourth quarter, Grace 
coach Chris Sullivan tried a lit­tle trickery: he called for the halfback pass and Joe Minadeo executed it to perfection, find­ing Burns for a 35-yard com­pletion. That play set up Grace's second touchdown as Kossler scrambled and threw to tight end Mike Kamradt. The ball bounced off Kamradt's hands right to Minadeo, who walked into the end zone. 
"The key to this game was making the correct adjust­ments on defense to their [the Big Red's] run-and-shoot, and on offense . . . to find what would work in order to have our offense click," said Sulli­van. "Obviously, the best way to get rid of any doubts about our playoff situation is to beat Flanner. We must beat Flan­ner, or our playoff hopes may be in jeopardy."

containing a large photo of Lou lloltz, and Irish athletic logos and campus scenes surround it. 
People on campus already have started wearing the shirts, and the ad in The Observer stating, "Buy It For 'The Cause," has been in the paper for more than a week. Sales al­ready have been immensely suc­cessful. 
"Our initial order was 11,000, but we've ordered 6,000 more," said Director of Student Activi­ties Joe Cassidy. "And it looks like we'll have to up that. Every goal (for shirt sales) I've had is being broken." 
The impressive sales can be attributed to the cooperative marketing by the Athletic De­partment, the bookstore and the Alumni Association. 
Prospective Zheng-de sup­porters can purchase the shirt at LaFortune Student Center, the ice rink in the ACC, the golf and tennis shops and the book­store. The shirt comes in short sleeves for $10 and long sleeves for $12. 
Those not on campus can order the shirt by calling 1­800-345-5027. There is a $5 per-order charge when ordered by phone. 
"What we'd like to do is have each class wear it a different day on the week before the Mi­ami game," said Cassidy.

Holtz praised the overall play of his team in the loss to Stan­ford. He said he liked the way the offense played, and praised the front seven on defense. The problems, said Holtz, were the secondary, the three fumbles on punts and a failure to stop several third down conversions by the Cardinal. 
"It was a situation that you don't normally face in coach­ing," said Holtz. "Normally

Rosenthal, reached last night, was vague in his explanation. 
"(Lambert) indicated that he had some philosophical differ­ences with the team," Rosenthal said. "He told us he would not coach anymore under those cir­cumstances." 
Several aspects of this situa­tion are disturbing. 1 For starters, a statement re­garding Lambert's situation should have been made Friday. The athletic department is re­sponsible to faithful Irish fans who show up at the games and see Lambert absent from the bench. The fans at least have a right to know who coaches the team they support, and this past weekend, they didn't have

when you lose you put on the film and find several people who played very poorly or played lackadaisically, or made bad decisions. But that wasn't the case. For the most part, our football team really, really competed well." 
After such a devastating upset, Holtz did not say whether he would make any specific changes on defense. He did hint of a change, however, when he said that cornerback Reggie Brooks had a "very, very bad shoulder." 
"There are a lot of different things that we can do to im­prove our defensive sec­ondary," said Holtz. "I think a lot of it is fundamentals, a lot of it is confidence. When you

Also. it would be interesting to find out why Lambert re­signed. Rosenthal said that the resignation was not coerced in any way. He said that he never issued any ultimatum to Lam­bert. He says the press release says it all. 
I disagree with that final statement. The press release sugarcoats the issue. It tells us that Lambert did a great job building up the volleyball pro­gram, and that he suddenly re­signed, without giving us a rea­son. 
The players who set the ball rolling in this situation are si­lent, too. Do they have some­thing to hide?

"There isn't any place where you have to be a umt any more than you do with your defensive secondary. They compliment one another, and we will be a good secondary before this year is over.

are not sure why the athletic department would let him go so easily. We do know that the Irish looked pretty pathetic in the Golden Dome Classic this weekend without Lambert on the sidelines. There is a lot of talent on that volleyball team; too much to condone such a poor performance this past weekend.

PITTSBURGH (AP) -Eric Davis had trouble picking his finest moment Tuesday night after throwing the Pittsburgh Pirates into their darkest hour of the National League playoffs. 
Davis threw out a belly­flopping Bobby Bonilla at third base as he desperately tried to stretch an eight-in­ning double in a one-run game. The fourth playoff putout by a Cincinnati out­fielder ensured a 5-3 victory that put the Reds just one victory away from a World Series. 
It was perhaps the most significant play of Davis' ca­reer, even if he was reluctant to admit it. 
''I've won three Gold Gloves. I've taken homers away by going over the fence. I've dove and made catches," Davis said. "It's hard to pick out one most significant play." 
No one else had any illu­sions. 
"That was the defensive play of the year." Bonilla said. 
"When Eric threw Bonilla out, the whole team jumped out of the dugout. We felt the game was over," Reds starter Jose Rijo said. "It's an unbelievable feeling. He made a great play." 
The Reds' outfield has done that with regularity throughout the four playoff games. Right fielder Paul O'Neill threw out runners at second and third base in the first two games, and Davis and Billy Hatcher wiped out two more Tuesday.

Women's soccer faces UW-
By DAVE DIETEMAN Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's soccer team (9-3-1) faces off against Wisconsin-Milwaukee this evening at 6 p.m. at Moose Krause Stadium in a game that may prove pivotal to the Irish drive for recognition as a re­gional power. 
In the most recent central re­gion poll, the Irish were ranked ninth, while Wisconsin-Milwau­kee slipped out of the Top Ten after suffering a 10-0 rout at the hands of Wisconsin-Madi­son. 
After suffering their first home loss of the season -a 2-0 decision against eighth-ranked Creighton -the Irish will be looking to get their game back on track before upcoming matchups with Northwestern and Saint Mary's College. 
"These are some important games coming up for us," re­marked Notre Dame head 

coach Chris Petrucelli. "This is posed to be, the biggest thing a big game for us. We have a that we can do is to try and big rivalry with Saint Mary's, prevent her from getting the and in between that game and ball by shutting out the other the MCC Tournament we have a players around her, because we trip to Florida International. can't match blinding speed.

By JENNIFER MARTEN Sports Writer 
The women's golf team fin­ished off their fall season at the Northern Illinois Invitational over the weekend with a two round total of 709, placing the Irish sixth out of a field of ten which included strong teams from Northern Illinois, Illinois State and Kansas State. 
The weather was the biggest factor in the tournament. Tem­peratures hovered around 40 degrees and the wind chill was near freezing. In addition, the

only one shot on goal the entire game. 
"Overall the team played ex­tremely well," said co-captain Troester. "We were able to utilize our basic skills and capi­talize on offense." 
Gilliland opened the scoring drive in the second half after she shot a corner kick into the upper left corner of the net. 
Junior fullback Annie Hartzel added another goal as she went down the middle and shot the ball into the upper far corner of the net. 
Soon after, junior Frannie Cappelleri tapped a goal into the net after a corner kick from freshman Katie Daniel. 
"The team showed lots of composure," said Van Meter. "We were able to concentrate on the things that we have been working on all season." 
The Belles travel to Calvin College this Saturday and then the team will return home to challenge Notre Dame in a long awaited match to be held on Monday, Oct. 16 at Saint Mary's Field.

kee may not be able to run all over us and utilize their speed on a smaller field. Plus, we've had a couple of days to practice and train on the smaller field." 
All things considered, the Irish are not out of the woods yet, largely because of injuries to several players. Shannon Jenkins, who dislocated her kneecap in practice last Wednesday, might return for Saturday's meeting with Northwestern. 
Molly Lennon, who would have taken Jenkins spot, injured her left foot last Thursday and is listed as possible for the Northwestern match. 
"With Molly in the lineup, maybe we would have done a couple of things differently," noted Petrucelli. "We miss Shannon's intensity and her physical play. Molly Lennon can probably do the same job, but she is hurt too. I doubt that ei­ther will play tomorrow. It'd be optimistic to say that either of them will play on Saturday. That's really in doubt at this point." 

As if the loss of Jenkins and Lennon did not sap Notre Dame's strength enough, the Irish are also temporarily without the services of fresh­man defender Brenda Gorski of 
South  Bend,  who  adds  both  
height and  power  to  the de­ 
fense.  

Injuries aside, an impressive outing against Wisconsin-Mil­waukee is what Notre Dame needs to keep scaling the cliffs of regional prominence.

SMC soccer wins 5-0 to go 10-1-1 

By TASHA TIGHT 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's soccer team prevailed over the University of Chicago 5-0 yesterday at Saint Mary's Field to improve their record to 10-1-1. 
The Belles played an out­standing match despite wet and cold conditions. 
Saint Mary's first two goals came in the first half of a game that was played for the most part in front of the opponent's goal. 
Ten minutes into the half Megan Dalsaso flicked a goal in after a crossing shot from Tr­ish Troester. Five minutes later Stacy Winget tapped in the ball after a corner kick off of Greer Gilliland. 
"I was happy with the team execution," remarked Coach Tom Van Meter. "Despite the brutal conditions everyone con­tributed to the team effort." 
Saint Mary's began the sec­ond half completely containing the University of Chicago of­fense and defense, allowing

Holtz says ND won't be No. 1 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Partly because of Saturday's loss to Stanford and partly be­cause of Notre Dame football's special situation, Head Coach Lou Holtz discounted any pos­sibility of the Irish winning a national championship this year. 
''I'm not concerned at all about a national championship. As far as I'm concerned, that's a dead issue," said Holtz, speaking at a press conference Tuesday. "The only chance we had was to go 11-0, and play 

' anybody else that went 11-0. When you're here (at Notre Dame), you're not going to win it with a loss." When asked to explain why

team did not win. I felt that we were the strongest team in the tournament, and had we played the final round, we would have won." 
Nevertheless, Thomas was satisfied with the team's per­formance. He attributed the second place finish to a bad ruling by the tournament offi­cials, which cost the Irish four strokes. 
"I anticipated a win by us, but the bad ruling and the poor conditions of the greens really hurt us," he concluded.

It was the kind of day that changes a life, but in this case Notre Dame students and fam­ily have a chance to erase part of the insult from the injury. 
Graduate student Zheng-de Wang, destined for a doctorate in sociology at Notre Dame, was struck by a car in a hit-S 
tt 8 and-run affair shortly less than co rutocao 
a year ago. He had been walk-Irish Items 
ing to his off-campus home. ____ 
The accident left Zheng-de comatose in South Bend hospi tal for several months. In all, the Chinese 28-year-old was injured so severely that he spent 11 months in the hospital. His parents, from Tianjin in the People's Republic of China, flew to the United States in November and have been assist­ing in his recovery since. 
Zheng-de was uninsured. 
Today, Zheng-de is undergoing therapy at the St. Paul's Retirement Community in South Bend. Although he still can­not talk, he is able to recognize his old friends and move his fingers for simple communication. His doctors have hope that he can regain mobility and speech. 
That is where it stands for him, and here the Notre Dame family can help. In keeping with Zheng-de's extreme physi­cal, emotional and financial plights, a group of Notre Dame students have designed a commemorative T -shirt for next Saturday's Miami game, which marks one year to the day of Zheng-de's accident. 
The shirt is navy blue, with a classy "Notre Dame vs. Mi­ami" and a picture of the two teams' helmets on the front. On the back, there is a multicolored oicture of a !!arne ticket

team. In addition to O'Connell, 
sophomore Chris Dayton also 
qualified for the team. Dayton 
shot a 150 for the tournament 
and finished in a tie for third 
place. 
Other contributors to the 
Irish's second place finish were senior Paul Nolta, who shot a 155; sophomore Joe Dennen with a 159 and freshman Jay Johnsrud with a total of 156 for the tournament. 
The tournament concluded the fall schedule for the men's golf team, which now looks to­ward the spring season. Coach Thomas expects improvement, but, because of a very tough schedule, his team will face some major obstacles. 
"We will be facing some of the toughest teams in our re­gion," Thomas commented "and I don't expect us to puli any huge upsets. However, our scoring averages are very good right now, and I hope that we can continue to improve them in the spring."
