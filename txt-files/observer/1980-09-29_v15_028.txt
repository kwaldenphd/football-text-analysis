MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1980 
Another violent weekend ; two more OC robberies 
by Brian McFeeterJ Staff Reporter 
Two more off campus robberies of Notre Dame students occurred Friday evening, one as a student was "-alking to his home on Corby Avenue, and the second as three women students were leaving Lee's Grill and Barbecue restaurant. 
Responding to these incidents, South Bend police staged a decoy operation near Lee's and arrested five youths. ' Kevin Deardorfwas confronted by three black males ataround 7 
p.m. and forced to turn over a wallet containing $24 and checks. "One ofthe guys had a pistol, but I could tell it was just a cap gun," Deardorfsaid. "I was really just worried about somebody pulling a knife." . 
The Corby St. resident said he attempted to follow the three after they left with his wallet but they sped down an alley. He then called the police and filed a report. . 
In the second incident, which occurred about an hour later, three Notre Dame women were met by a youth armed with a knife as they returned to their car at Lee's Ribs. Two ofthe seniors, who wish to remain unidentified, were struck in the face as they resisted this and another attacker. The 18-to-20 year old youths ran away after grabbing a purse containing keys and nearly $20. 
Police noted that the descriptions of the attackers in both incidents were similar, according to one of the women, and sent plainclothes officers to the South Bend Avenue restaurant.

Running bolts to popularity 
The increased popularity of running over the past few years has caused a drastic change in the fitness habits of athletes everywhere. Amby Burfoot, winner of the 1968 Boston Marathon, was also an early coach of premier marathoner Bill Rodgers, and has witnessed the changes which brought a­bout the "running revolution". He was interviewed last week by Oh1~rver reporter David Sarphie. 

Q: How JiJ yo11 get introtl11ced to nmning? 
A: I was pretty lucky. My high school coach,who won the '57 Boston Marathon, always taught us that running was fun. We ran over the nature trails and through the apple orchards of New London,Connecticut. He continually stressed the im­portance of running for fun, and it rubbed off on us. 
Q: I've he11rd that yo11 ran your firIIfew r11ceJ in bowling JhoeJ. How did that come to he? 
A: I was just like any other novice. I didn't know anything about shoes. I searched through my attic, looked deep inside my cellar, and finally came across a pair of real light shoes. They worked fine for the first couple of races, but then we had a meet on a cold, rainy afternoon. Needless to say, the bowling shoes fell apart at the stitches. I quickly learned my lesson and bought some running shoes.

William S. Anderson, chair­man of the NCR Corporation, told a Library Auditorium aud­ience of about 100 Thursday afternoon that business, labor, and government all have to share the blame for putting the United States "behind 35 to 14" in the "football game of in­dustrial supremacy." 
Anderson chronicled the rise ofJapanese industrial might in comparison to declining US economic fortunes in his talk entitled "Meeting theJapanese Economic Challenge." 
"The government has con­tinually legishted disincentives to productivity," Anderson said. "However, we cannot make the elected officials scapegoats. Democratic gov­ernment reflects a consensus of the people. In the last fifteen years the people have lacked a sense of direction." 
Anderson claims that the bureaucracy in the interim took the initiative to "embark on a fifteen year spending spree" and enact regulations that leave businesses scrambling "to meet the rising costs of staying in business." 
In comparison, Anderson be­lieves that little government in­tervention in Japan ha!' le(1 to "postwar economic growth nothing short of spectacular." Another factor is the ability of the Japanese business and labor

Riehle proposes that the eight on campus representa­tives be elected in four separate Districts, two from each Dis­trict. The Districts would, roughly, be divided among the Towers, the North Quad, the South Quad, and the rest of the isolated halls, with some ac­comodations made for equality. 
Elections for these posts would be held after fall break. 
The October 9 referendum will ask whether or not students approve of the amendment to the Constitution, since Riehle's changeshave all been proposed as one amendment. Other Constitutional changes make alterations in the composition of the Budget Committee, the provisions for impeachment of the President and Judicial Coordinator, and the process for amendment ofthe Constitu­tion.

In contrast, Anderson sees the U.S. as "a nation of con­flicting national interests. The government has embarked on a bureaucratic crusade to guaran­tee an easy life," which Ander­son believes isn't necessarily wrong, but is non-productive. "Business tends to subordinate long range planning in favor of short range profits, and Labor has fought the removal of out­dated work methods."

Reoublican John Hiler's visit to campus~riday was terme a success yesterday by College Republican spokesman Mark Lynch. Hiler, who is running against Third District incumbentJohn Brademas, was cam­paigning for votes in anticipation of the November 4 election. The candidate arrived on campus at 8:30 Friday morning, gave inte.rviews to the campus media and also met with University President Fr, Theodore Hesburgh. The rest of the time was spent talking with students between classes, according to Lynch. Polls show the race very close at present, and Lynch says that "the few hundred votes supplied by Notre Dame and Saint Mary's could provide the margin Hiler needs to defeat Brademas."

A West German neo-Nazi is believed to have planted the bomb that ripped through a crowd of Oktoberfest revelers, killing 12 people, including the suspected terrorist, and injuring 213. Police have arrested six members of an outlawed fascist organization in con­nection with the blast. Karl-Heinz Hoffmann, 43, leader of the "Military Sport Group Hoffmann," was picked up over the weekend along with five other members of the group, Bavarian State Justice Minister Karl Hellermeier said Sun­day.

They've asked an Indiana-based firm to help. Harvest Energy Inc. oflndianap­olis plans to produce a device it calls an "anaerobic digester," which breaks down organic wastes and yields methane. Ringling Bros. officials asked the company to mount the system on a flatcar in the circus train. Company officials expect the device to be ready for the circus by spring. From there, the digester would not onlyget rid ofwastes, butwould produce gas to heat livestock cars, run generators for electricity or provide bottled gas for cooking.

Swords into ploughshares 
Registration for the draft began this. past summer and all males born in 1960 and 1961 were required by law to inform the government of who they were and where tliey lived. Despite the reassurances by the government and military that a draft is not necessary--nor wanted--right now, many people pro.tested against the reinstating of regtstration. 
Their protests were quiet and short-lived, ending once registrtion was completed. Most men who registered have probably forgotten about it. They made a quick decision over the summer, to register or not to register, and that was it. 
But that really is not it. You see, now that the ftrst step has been taken, there is nothing to prevent the ftnal steps, and if ever we need to think about what we would do when those steps are taken, the time is now. We cannot wait until draft numbers are called or our troops are sent to begin thinking and acting. 
No one can decide whether he will support a war or not without thinking about it. In the past, most men did not thmk about having a choice--if our country called they went to war. It was simple. But consciousnesses have been raised since the Korean conflict and the decision to go to war is no longer simple, due to the emergence of the cold wars, and the threat ofnuclear weapons. If you choose to be drafted with or without a war--you need to have a reason. And ifyou choose not to be drafted, you better have a damn good reason. 
There have always been conscientious objec­tors during times of war. in all draft bills provisions were made for those who, because of religious training and belief ~ere consc~e!l­tiously opposed to war. That ts the tradmonal, accepted deftnition of a CO. The only difference , since WWII, has been the expansion of that deftnition to include those who conscientiously objected, based on person­al beliefs. Exemption from war for a CO, is a privile!{e granted by le!{islation--not a constitu­tional nght. Coupled wtth that exemption from battle was the supposition that the CO would support the government action in any way he could: in the medical corps, office work, etc. 
This has remained the official governmental deftnition of a CO. But within the last twenty years, the term CO has expanded far beyond the bounds of reli~ious beliefs. Historically the CO was always vtewed simply as a non-con­

formist, an idealist and dreamer, and he was accepted as such by the government and society. he had his beliefs and stayed out ofthe way. But since the Korean conflict, two new forms of CO have appeared that have caused society and government a great deal of unrest. 
The ftrst is the secular or nonreligious objector; a person who, not throu~h association with a religion, refuses to partictpate in war. The difficulty with the secular objector involves the question of his sincerity--there is no religious training that backs up his beliefs, they are personal instead. 
How does one judge if his objection is relly from conviction or selftsh cowardtce? 
In her book, Conscience in America, 'lillian Schlissel deftnes conscientious objection as 'the act of a single individual who seeks to right a social injustice, who seeks, by his own protest or nay-saying, to turn the state from war.' A CO is as much a/atriot as those who believe they must defen their country in a time of crisis. only the CO would prefer to prevent or end war by his dissent. 
A CO , whether he-is a religious, selective, secular or absolutist, supports his country; but his ideals lead him to protect it by preserving its peace. 
Society's view of the CO has always been negative, because he chooses a different way, he doesn't conform to the common view; he forces people to stop and think about war and violence. 
No, we are not faced with war yet. But with the present conflict in the Mid-East, and last year's Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the Iranians still holding our people hostage--war might not be all that far off. We might be at peace now, but ifwe are to remain at peace, the voice of the conscientious objector must be heard. They are a reminder that there can be an alternative. It's something to think about--be­fore the draft, before the war, before it's too late. 
This is the first part ofa two-part column. Next week's column will deal with the moral reasons for being a conscientious objector.

Farm Workers union wilts 
By Roger Gillott Associated Press Wnter 
The United Farm Workers union, long the darling of grape and lettuce boycotting liberals, has fallen on hard times. 
Now in the second year of a dispute with vegetable growers in the rich desens of southern California and Arizona, the UFW concedes defeat on the picket line and admits its boycotts do not have the im­pact they once did. 
The UFW is also running into difficulties over back taxes and ~overnment grants.

began Sept. 16, 1965-the 155th anniversary of Mexican Inde­pendance Day-and stretched on for five years of marches, fasts and boycotts.

The bitter but publicity-rich strike took on son ofa "Grapes of Wrath'' romanticism that captured the fancy of urbanites from coast to coast. The colorful union leader, Cesar Chavez, wearing his familiar plaid shin and khaki pants, became a national symbol as he took up the cause of impoverished Latinos every­where. 
Today the situation is less glowing: 
-Investigators for the com­munity Services Administration issued a repon challenging a CSA grant of $951,000 in migrant worker funds and sug­gestio~ that the UFW may have violated a federal regula­tion by usin~ the money for union activines. The CSA is expected to decide within a month what action to take. 
-Other federal authorities are investigating whether $1 million from the Labor Depan­ment and the former Depan­ment of Health, Education and Welfare was misused. 
-The Internal Revenue Ser­vice says the UFW owes more than $400,00 in back taxes for unemployment ·and social security. 
-The state legislature has approved a bill prohibiting the UFW from making members contribute to its campai~n war chest, effectively curtailing the union's political clout.

Dear Members of the Notre Dame Student Body: 
As you know, this year's United Way Fund Drive is taking place this week on campus. As I have in years past, I would once again ask you to support this worthwhile cause. 
I think it is important for everyone to experience the responsibility to give during the course of their college educa­tion. The United Way Fund Drive is one very good way to gain this experience. I find it admirable that the student goal is set at 1~ participation rather than a total dollar figure. The emphasis an one-to-one solicitation and personal cootact exemplifies a commitment to promote responsible giving and last year's st~ent participation rate of nearly 85~ was by far the highest ever.  
As you know, the entire University is involved with the United Way Fund Drive of St. Joseph County. Notre Dame, as part of St. Joseph County, is asked to pledge an annual donation to the fund. Faculty, administration, staff, and students partici­pate each year to meet this goal. Your donation to help support the many charitable organizations in the local community will be greatly appreciated by many people less fortunate than ourselves. 
Last year's student response for United Way was excellent. Let's see if we can't prove that Notre Dame has the number one student body in more than just athletics by topping last year's response and reaching that lao% participation figure. 
Thanking you for your cooperation and wishing you the best during the year ~ead,-I am 
Ever devotedly in Notre Dame,

return to the police stationand were able to identify theirattackers 
from a lineup, one of them reported. 
Deardorf said he was not called about the arrests but was later 
told some suspects had been detained. 
Neither of the struck women was seriously hurt, though one of 
them did go to a hospital to make sure her nose was not broken.

A: In the late SixtiesI roomed with both Bill and Olympian Jeff Galloway. That was at Wesleyan University. Bill's high school coach had been stern and authoritarian with his runners. This turned Bill off completely. When he carne to Wesleyan, I re-introduced him to the fun of running. We de­vised our own program really. We both enjoyed the long, slow, aerobic running. Then we through in some speed work and hills to sharpen up for races. Basically, I acted as Bill's men­tor. 
Q: Tell me about your 1968 &ston win. 
A: It was my senior year in college. Twice I had been sixth in the NCAA's in cross-country, and I was beginning to get some confidence. Also, I had run an 
8:45 two-mile that year,which proved to myself that I had some speed. To train for Bos­

pledged to centralize the wide­ly-spread Student Government branches into a more workable body. His Student Senate would take up the functions not only of the Board of Com­missioners, but also of the Campus Life Council, in hopes of constructing a unified, rep­resentative student voice. Riehle cannot disband the CLC, but he feels it is an ineffective body because it has University staff members on its board,and he says he will not convene it again. 
It should be emphasized that the Student Senate's adminis­trative powers will not differ from those of other student governmental bodies-it has none, other than the allocation of student activities funds. However, Riehle feels that the Senate, with wider student rep­resentation but without Ad­ministration interference, will perform its duty asthe student voice· to the University much more effectively than any of its predecessors. 
But Riehle can only hope that fifty percent of the student body turns out to vote on the referendum, and that all of them approve ofhis new plan. If they do not, he must attempt a longer,more tedious amend­ment process: Riehle is not looking forward to that.­

break to fund research and development in industry, an increase in the amount of de­preciation a business a business can claim as a tax deduction, and an attempt to stimulate personal savings." 
"The average American only saves about five percent of his income, while the average Jap­anese saves almost 20 ·rcent," Anderson said. Thi:. saving leads to a high rate of capital formation in Japan, and makes money more available for in­vestment in industrial renova­tion. 
ton, I was doing 120 miles a week, which was unheard of back then. The race itself ac­tually became a two-man race between myself and a Notre Dame grad, Bill Clark. He was edging me outgoing up the hills toward Boston, but his thighs cramped up on the down-side. I was able to keep thepace up and win it. 
Q: What kind of physical afld P.IJ'chological barriers mustyou over­come in a marathofl? 
A: Ofcourse, everyone hears about "the Wall" that all mara­thoners hit. However, I think it's just as much a mental, psychological battle as it is physical. You must run a per­fectly-paced race. It takes a­wareness and a lot of mental stamina to complete a run of that distance.

Q: Do you thiflk the cu"eflt rufl­fliflg boom will cofltiflue? 
A: I don't think the current increases percentage-wise can continue. However, in absolute numbers, more and more peo­ple will be running. I think the trend will spread throughout the family. I also think the run­ning craze will begin to affect the lower socio-economic strata. 
Q: What are you flow doiflg, career-wise? 
A: As a writer for Ruflfler's World,! stay pretty busy. I've been experimenting with a training program of running only four days a week. This allows me time to restand toget my work done. On the days I do run, I run hard. This keeps me in shape for road races. And it keeps me feeling good, too.

Cichy ready to play 

by Beth Huffman Sports Editor 
Steve Cichy, the junior from Fargo, N.D. who was injured in the 31-10 Irish romp over Pur­due, has received a clean bill of healthfromdoctorsattheMayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. 
Cichy, a strong safety who doubles as Notre Dame's kick­off man, sustained a crushed vertebrae in his neck as he tackled Jimmy Smith in the Boiler contest. 
Local doctors determined that Cichy would be sideline for "an indefinite period of time," 

Diamondmen drop three 
by Dave Irwin Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame baseball team outscored its opponents 17-16 this\weekend but still lost three out of four games played onJake Kline Field to drop its season record to 5-3. 
, 
The Irish lost a pair to Lewis University Sunday by the scoresof 4-3 and 6-4. Notre Dame split with Spring Arbor losing the first game 6-5 and rebounding to take the second 
, game 5-0. "The.key to a successful sea­son is you don't lose a double­

~ header,"said head coach Larry Gallo. "Lewis University is as good as any ball club in the Midwest, but we still very easily 
could have wonfour games." The hosts almost gained a

' 
split in Sunday's second game when senior Jim Montagano singled home junior Joe Bar­' rowswith two outin the bottom' 
of the seventh, tying the score 4-4. Lewis picked up two runs in the top ofthe eighth ona walk, a hits bats man and two singles. The Irish were able to load the bases in the bottom of the in­ning before sophomore Rick Chryst grounded to first to end the game. Senior Mike Deasey started throughfive innings before giv­ing up an infield hit to Lewis' Greg Sertichto lead off the sixth. Bob Tumpany then doubled down the right field line putting runners on second · and third.ln backing up the plate on the ensuing throw, i Deasey twisted his ankle and was relieved by junior Tom Conroy. 
"That was unfortunate for both Mike and the team," Gallo said."It was demoralizing for the kids." 
In the first game against Lewis the Irish were credited with no errors in dropping a 4-3 decision, but they did have two runners picked off, a passed ball that led to the tying run and had runners, on one occasion,on first and third with no out and failed to score. 
"Getting picked off is inex­cusable," Gallo said. "It's de­moralizing. Instead of being confident, people say to them­selves,' I hope I don'tgetpicked off."' 
In the opener Chryst was 3­for-3, and Montagano had two hits, including a solo home­run. 
On Saturday, the Irish gained a split against SpringArbor on a combined two hit shutout by sophomore Steve Whitmyer 
the game and had a shutout and freshman Bob Hickey in 
Irish fall to Hoosiers; record stands at' 8-2 
The Notre Dame soccer team dropped its second game of the season yesterday afternoon, falling to Indiana 4-0 at Bloom­ington. The Irish, now 8-2 on the year, lost at St. Louis earlier this season for · their · only other setback., 
The Hoosiers, ranked third nationally and ftrst in the Great Lakes Region with an 8-1-1 slate, scored their ftrst goal with just 5:28 gone when all-American Armando Betan­court scored his ftrst of the game with the assist coming from Greg Kennedy. 
Betancourt went back to work moments later when he scored goal number two for Indiana on a direct kick from about 30 yards out. The kick resulted after Notre Dame's Steve Miller, a senior fullback, was called for a foul which many termed a 'bad call.' 
Betancourt placed the shot perfectly, just below the cross­bar and just beyond the reach of Notre Dame goalkeeper, John Milligan. 
Pat McGaulley comJ?leted his team's ftrst half sconng on a chip shot at the 26:30 mark, givrng Indiana a 3-0 halftime advantage. 
All-American Robert Mesch­bach accounted for the frnal Indiana goal with a crossing shot from the right wing area. 
"I'm pleased with the way we played," said Hunter. "They're just better than us." 
The host Hoosiers outshot the Irish 24-5 with Notre Dame goalke~pers registering nine saves. Indiana's goalies did not have to make a single save. 
The Irish will meet Loyola University tomorrow at 4 p.m. on the Chicago-based school's home fteld. 
game two.Whitmyer hurled the first five innings, giving up one hit and striking out two. 
Notre Dame droppped the opener 6-5 as Barrows was thrown out at the plate to end the game. Chryst had two hits while juniorChuck Tasch and Jamieson each had two runs 
batted in. 
Starting pitcher, junior John Ebert, fell behind 5-0 after three innings before freshman Mark Clementz came in and pitched 3 1/3 innings of re­lief,surrending one run.Szajko, Chryst and Montango each had five hits on the weekend.Mon­t:agano now is hitting an im­pressive .411 with seven extra base hits. The Irish will be at the Bradley Tournament this Sat­urday in Peoria, Ill. The Irish face Indiana State, who they've already defeated twice this fall, Bradley on Saturday and St. Louis on Sunday.

The Bottom Ten 

Vanderbilt-Best of the worst 
by Skip Desjardin and Rob Simari 
The Bottom Ten voters hear a lot of com­plaints from coaches, but none are as legitimate as those of Massachusetts Maritime's Don Ruggeri. Forty-two ofRuggeri's players went to sea on the academy's training ship, "The Bay State". Since the plasayers will not return for another five weeks, Ruggeri's squad will consist of thirty one freshmen and six seniors. 
What with Florida banned from the poll for the rest of the season, and teams like Columbia and Rice sufferring disappointing victories, there are grumblings among the voters for a return to the good ol' days -before parity. Luckily, there are standbys like Northwestern, Kansas_, and Vanderbilt who are valiantly re­sisting the dawn of a new era of mediocrity. 
A Bottom Ten salute goes out to Cortez (Colorado) High School punter Craig Ward. Craig's first punt of this week's game was blocked. Undaunted, Craig lofted his second punt ofthe night high into the air, only to have it land thirty-eight yards behind him. 
For those of you who have nothing to do this weekend, there is an epic battle scheduled in Colorado Springs. That's right, the Air Force­
