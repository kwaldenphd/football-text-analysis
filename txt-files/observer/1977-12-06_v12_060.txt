Rukavina clarifies her proposal to abolish SA 
by MicheUe Leahy 
Mary Ruakvina, St. Mary's stu­dent body president, last night at the Student Assembly meeting, clarified the proposal she made at last Thursday's Board of Gover­nance meeting that the Student Assembly should be abolished. 
Rukavina said that her proposal made at the Board of Governance meeting was unfortunate and led to many misunderstandings. "The statement was thrown out for discussion purposes only," she noted. 
She added that she wanted it made clear that under no circum­stances can any type of action be taken concerning proposals without the vote of the Student Assembly. Rukavina said, "My error was that I didn't discuss this issue with the Student Assembly first." 
At last night's meeting Rukavina also called for a better working _ relationship between herself and the-Student Assembly. She said  about the function of the Assembly. She noted that the Assembly is the representative of the student body and is the only body which exercis­ advisory board. Cathy Hedges, vice president of the Executive Board, said the  
she wanted to make criteria sheets available to Assembly members concerning decisions on the alloca­tion of funds to various clubs, commissions, and social organiza­tions. Rukavina said she wanted to better educate the student body  es jurisdiction on voting matters. It is the only body which approves or vetoes proposals, budgets, and appointments of different commis­sioners. The Board of Governance, she added, has no voting power. She stressed that it is strictly an  meeting was very beneficial in that it resulted in a different attitude on the part of all members. Rukavina has called for a long working , session in January when the As­sembly will begin to work to improve its internal structure and clarify its role.

Vance to visit Middle East 
WASHINGTON (AP] -Secretary ' of State Cyrus R. Vance, resuming the U.S. initiative in the Middle East, will visit Arab and Israeli capitals beginning this weekend to assess prospects for a comprehen­sive peace settlement. 
Stops have been set for Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan and Saudi Arabia with only "technical prob­lems" holding up a visit to Syria as well, according to U.S. officials. 
U.S. officials said the Vance mission will seek to measure the chances that a comprehensive set­tlement could emerge from the Israeli-Egyptian overtures. 
Formal announcement of the trip, the third to the region by Vance in less than a year, is expected later at the State Depart­ment. Along with it, the adminis­tration will emphasize Vance's quest for "new insights" from Middle East leaders on the possi­bility of moving toward an over-all settlement. 
"Our commitment to peace re­quires us to remain involved in the peacemaking process," said one 

Miners strike 

[continued from page 1] ly 1,800 mines operated by BCOA companies were shut down yester­day by miners getting a head start on the strike. · But he said more miners were working than had been expected on the last day of the expiring con­tract. He attributed the number of mines still open to a desire on the part of the miners to earn one more day's wages before the strike began. The most-immediate impact of a strike would be on the miners and their families. UMW miners would lose their daily wages of about $60 a day, and health benefits for themselves, their dependents and their retired colleagues also would be cut off. Industry officials say coal's best customers, utility plants and steel mills, have laid in stockpiles large enough to last several weeks. Government officials say a strike would not be the national problem it was in years past. Negotiations on a new contract to replace the existing three-year pact began on Oct. 6. Federal media­tors took charge of the discussions last week and managed to get the two sides back to the bargaining table on Friday. All sides reported over the weekend that there had been serious discussions on ''substantial issues." These include the union's demand for a limited right-to-strike over local issues at individual mines and its demand for refinanc­ing of its depleted health and pension funds.

The American mediating role in the Middle East was scaled down last month by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's dramatic mission to Jerusalem and then his call for  preliminary peace talks with Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin in Cairo in mid-December. 
The direct overture to the Jewish state has divided the Arab world, and the Carter administration tried to heal the rift by emphasizing its interest in a comprehensive settle­ment among all nations involved in the conflict. This was intended to ease concern in some Arab capitals that Sadat would reach a separate peace with the Jewish state. 
President Carter acknowledged at a news conference last W ednes­day that the United States was no longer the "dominant intermedi­ary" in the area.

Although it is still in the plan­ning stages, Van Eck said she hopes to bring films, prese:ntations and small group discussions to the dorms. She added that she wants to get a self-defense course, such as those offered by the dty and county police departments, on campus sometime in Feb~:uary or March. 
"We the Department of Student Affairs really feel committed to this. We have to start ope:ning up this topic to discussion. It has been a hush-hush subject for too long," Van Eck said. 
"There has been a Jot of talk about security and lighting, but it actually comes down to individual women. We have to b(: careful about where we go and what we do We must learn to protect our­selves," she added. 
Van Eck said the St. Mary's RAPE program was designed as a result of the rapes and attacks in the ND-SMC community this sem­ester.

Conclusions: only the beginning 
by Tony Pace Features Editor 

Editor's Note: Thls is the .6na1 installment of the three part series on the Human Sexuality report. This part deals with the national reaction to the report. 
The publication of the Human Se xuality report has triggered nation­al as well as local interest. Even before it had been publicly con­demned by the National Confer­ence of Catholic Bishops, the report had received criticism from many theological circles. 
Prior to its publication by the Catholic Theological Society of America, (CTSA) the Society found it necessary to revise and edit various portions of the text. The May 27, 1977 issue of the National CathoDe Reporter [NCR] noted that A "battle over the report, however, was in private conversations and board meetings closed to the public and press." The Catholic news­weekly reported that board mem­bers wanted to make sure the

re~ort was on sound theological ground before accepting it for publication. 
Two members of the CTSA who commented on the study during this period of internal debate were Charles Curran and Fr. A very Dulles. Dulles, who was president of the CTSA last year, and Curran are both Jesuits. 
The same May 16 issue of the NCR quotes Dulles as saying "I doubt that they (the commission members) have taken any positions that haven't been taken by moral theologians writing in the field in the last decade." 
"They're not aiming to break new ground, but to synthesize material. Quite a number of confes­sors have been operating on these principles. (those described in the report)." 
The NCR article goes on to state that this approach to the report was "an attempt to avoid violent reac­tion from the hierarchy (of the Church)." 
At the same time, Curran was more concerned with whether the Society should receive the report or not and on what reasons they should base that decision. "What I would object to most strongly, "the NCR quotes Curran as saying, "would be if the motivating force for not receiving the document were the fears of the board of directors that such a document would be displeasing to the bishops or to the other constituencies of the society." 
In the same issue of the NCR, there is a separate article concern­ing theologians who were already disputing the findings of the re­port. The main dissenter was William May, an associate profes­sor of moral theology at Catholic University. May later collaborate at the DeSales School of Theology, to write a review of the Human Sexuality report which appeared in the June 17 issue of the NCR. 
The initial article concerning the criticism of May and other theologians reads, "it fails to consider the experience of Catholic 
married couples, the body of 
thought developed by theologians 
and philosophers and the very 
serious obligation to look behind 
the authoritative teachings of the 
Church for the reasons that can be 
supportive of them." 
The conclusion of the May and Harvey review of theHuman Sex­uality report says, "Although the values of compassion and sym­pathy which typify the work are surely necessary for the Christian, the book's underlying methodolgy, its understanding of human sexual­ity and its questionable scholarship render it an inadequate and mis­leading guide to sexual morality.'' 
Also in the June 17 issue of the NCR is a review by John Milhaven. Milhaven, a professor of religious studies at Brown University, states "They (the committee) have listen­ed respectfully and critically to the practical decisions of these people (those whom the committe inter­viewed) have made and are at peace with. They have come to their first-aid pastoral guidelines relying on intuitive discernment. They have done well." 
Milhaven continues, " ... in the face of concrete situations they come to solid, true answers al­though they cannot conceptualize the basic principles on which these answers logically depend. At its best, this is what the committee has done." 
Other reviews of the Human Sexuality report have appeared in the Oct. 31 issue of Christianity and Crisis and the fall issue of Communfo. The Communfo review is also written by May and Harvey. Essentially, it is similar to the review which they wrote for the NCR, but it is more fully devel­oped. 
The national debate over the report breaks simply into agree­ment or disagreement with the new, Jess than absolute, guidelines set forth. 
A letter printed in the June 17 issue of the NCR illustrates the position in agreemenJ with the

Burtchaell, Gutting debate beliefs 
by Frank Laarfno 

Meanings and truths behind Christian belief and the values and morality of Christian lifestyles were among the topics of discussion at last night's philosophy colloquium in the Memorial Library Auditor­ium. Fr. James Burtchaell, profes­sor of theology, and Gary Gutting, associate professor of philosophy, presented contrasting views on contemporary theological philoso­phies to an enthusiastic crowd of 125. 
Gutting centered one argument on the necessity of aupportive evidence for religious beliefs. "A religious claim is either factual or symbolic," he said. "If it is symbolic, then Christian belief is merely paganistic. It is less exciting, and therefore less mean­ingful. This backs away from traditional Christian characteris­tics." 
''However, · continued Gutting, "if the belief is factual, then the believer must provide evidence, like in any other claim. Where can this evidence be found?" 
Burtchaell maintained that phys­ical evidence is not necessary to prove Christian belief. ''There are ways of verification other than the calculation of measurable data," he said. "We must evaluate our beliefs by the way it satisfies all the 
questions that surround it: philo­
sophical, psychological, and socio­logical."Burtchaell stated that Christian belief is proven through the testi­mony of those who experienced religious phenomena.  'Christian faith is measured with integrals within the human existence," he said. "This examination does not come through 'facts."' 
During the initial 45-minute dis­cussion period, Gutting also out­lined what he called "a dilemma of

moral values: Does Christianity give us a way of life, a value system, in which dogma becomes unimportant? Or is a 'Christian way of life' simply one of loving other people?" 
"Christianity is committed to the removal of evil from the world," continued Gutting. "It strives to end a worldwide epidemic of misery. But is it right to devote all our resources to a lifestyle that turns its back on art and culture?" 
Burtchaell countered, stating 
that the Church does not find art and culture "worthless." Howev­er. he said the Church does not center itself around human a­chievement. 
"We often take very good activi­ties and use it as an excuse to be not-so-nice people,'' said Bur­tchaell. "We become wrapped up in what we become. Great artists often become absorbed by their cultural achievement, unable to set

it free. Christianity says there is no greater achievement than the crea­tion of one generous ·human be­ing." 
Subsequent questions and dis­cussions extended for over one hour. Gutting cited a major problem with Christianity as its image as only a moral system. 
"A moral claim does not state the world as it exists, but instead as it should be,   Gutting said. ''Christianity seems to say the same thing. Therefore, is the modern view of Christianity simply one of a moral philosophy.?" 
In a later discussion, Burtchaell commented on the Christian view­point on evil. "ChrL~tians can't grow in love and justice in a world without malevolence," he said. 
"The Christian can't rely on a pleasant world. Instead, he turns evil into a learning experience. Christianity, unlike many philoso­phies, does not try to defeat evil. It concentrates on introducing good into the world." 
The colloquium was the result of a year-long effort by senior Thomas Merrigan. "There's such a vast dichotomy between these two view­points, I felt we had to bring them together," said Merrigan. "It's important that these viewpoints be brought out in this type of setting."

Human sexuality report 
[continued from page 3] report. It reads, "It was with great pleasure that I read the new report on sexuality from the Catholic Theological Society of America. We in the church, for too long, have suffered a lack of pastoral norms in the area of sexuality. Hopefully, this study will generate a new approach toward an understanding of the sorely needed and critical area." 
When the National Conference of Catholic Bishops issued its state­ment condemning the report, there were members of the doctrinal committee who made general state­ments concerning the status of sex­uality today and the church's role in the delineation of sexual moral­ity. 
One such priest is Auxiliary Bishop Daniel Pilarczyk of Cincin­nati. He stated that the behavior of Catholics in sexual matters is not "the way it ought to be. But the fact that the church's teaching is not always followed is no reason to stop teaching it." 
"We are not insensitive to the demands a Catholic theology makes on Catholics in the modern world; our concern is that they not try to resoond to those demands in ways contradictory to the teachings of the church." 
But Pilarczyk said that there would be no attempt to prevent the future publication of the report. He said, "It would be overkill to take one book of this nature and come in with excommunication, censoring, etc." 
Bishop Walter Curtis of Bridge­port, CT added, "I don't think the book will continue such sales once the bishops' position becomes known.''

Case Western receives humanities endowment 
by Bob Brink Ass't. Managing Editor 
The National Endowment for the Humanities has awarded a grant of $160,000 to the Case Western Ruerve University in Cleveland for the purpose of sponsoring a ''Re­gional History Day" next spring. The program will involve students on the high school and junior high levels throughout Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana. 
Initially, the program will consist of contests on the district level and then subsequent contests on state­wide and regional levels. Heading the program for the local third congressional district of Indiana are Vincent DeSantis, professor of history at Notre Dame, and Jim Cierzniak, social studies chairman at Penn High School in Mishawaka. 
''The purpose of the History Day," according to DeSantis, "is to inspire and revive interest in American history. Over the past few years there's been a decline in interest on the part of students around the country." 
The topic for the program will be "Energy: Its Impact on History." Students are asked to emphasize the social and cultural role that energy has played in American history. Their projects, for exam­ple, might discuss the historical development of energy resources and technology, the effects techno­logical change has had for man, or the social and cultural changes that have resulted because of the devel­opment of energy resources and technology, the effects technologic­al change has had for mar., o:: the

social and cultural changes that have resulted because of the deve­lopment of new energy sources. 
-DeSantis said he considers this topic to be very appropriate. ''Next to inflation," he said, "energy is the single most important problem the nation confront. It will be interesting to see what the studlents do with it." 
The Regional History Day pro­gram will be held locally at ll'enn High School on April 1, 1978. History teachers throughout the area have been notified about the effort. "It's up to them to bring it to the attention of their students," said DeSantis. 
DeSantis commented that he was unsure about both the statistical response and the creative response the project will receive. ''This is the first time this has been done in Indiana," he said. "I don't know how many students we'll have participating in it, or what's ,going to come from it. I understand! it to be similar to a science fair. Maybe students will present physical things they've constructed, put on plays, or submit papers." 
There will be judges to clecide upon the best projects, and prizes will be awarded to the winners to encourage further interest in study­ing history. 
The National Endowment for the Humanities, which is sponsoring the Regional History Day Youth Project, is the chief cultural ~~gency of the federal government. Us goal is to award grants funding pro­grams that support education and scholarship in the humanities. 

Medical schools accept most ND grads 
by Patrick E. C'..ole Special Projects Editor 
EDITOR'S NOTE: This Is the first of a three-part series explo&g the pre-professional studies program at the University. Today's story wUI look at how the program Is coordi­nated. Tomorrow's story will exam­Ine how students view preprofes­sional studies. The last part wUI illustrate how various medical schools admit prospective doctors. 
Right now, you're going to take a true-false quiz about oneof themost notorious student fraternities on campus, the pre-meds: *Most pre-meds spend nine to ten hours each day studying In the Ubrary. Probably false. Many high achieving students here on campus to enter medical school spend about four hours each for their classes. *Notre Dame's pre-med program Is ranked In the top ten among major undergraduate programs at private universities. Perhaps this is true. Although there is not official ranking of preprofessional pro­grams, the highly competitive medical schools consider Notre Dame's applicants to be high-qual­ity students. 
If you want to go to medical or dental school, you have to declare a major In the Department of Prepro­fessional Studies. False. In fact, a student can major in biology, chemistry, physics--even history or English--just so he meets the

The next best thing to a present...
*The Observer Christmas issue Personals 
science requirements prescribed by the medical school he or she wants to enter. *After the freshman year, about half of the preprofessional studies Intents transfer to another depart­ment or to another college of the University. Absolutely false. At the beginning of the sophomore year, the preprofessional studies depart­ment will receive about 200 stu­dents; about 25 of these students will leave the program at the end of the sophomore year. 
If it seems that everyone you meet is pre-med or thinking about going to medical or dental school, it's no wonder that the Preprofes­sional Studies department is .the largest in the University. Nearly 750 students are enrolled in this department and the Arts and Letters Preprofessional Studies. This figure does not include those students aspiring to be doctors or

Whatever the rei!Sons may be for the flight to medical schools by students here at Notre Dame, the majority do get their wish at the end of four years of hard work; the medical school letter of accept­ance. In fact, about 70 percent of Notre Daq~.e students applying to medical school get accepted, ac­cording to figures released by the University. The national average of undergraduate acceptance is about 30 percent. 
In 1977, 148 (72 percent) of the 204 Notre Dame graduates who applied to medical school were accepted. In 1976, 77 percent were accepted to medical schools. Most of the 67 medical schools which issued 218 acceptances to Notre Dame students accepted only one to three students from each school.

To receive award tonight 
Joyce named 'Distinguished American' 

by Mike Kenahan Staff Reporter 
In what Jimmie McDowell, Exe­cutive Director of the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame, described as a "big night for Notre Dame," Fr. Edmund P. Joyce, Notre Dame executive vice president will be honored tonight at the Foundation's 20th annual awards dinner in New York City's Waldorf Astoria Hotel. 
Joyce, who will be receiving the Foundation's "Distinguished American Award," will also be joined in the honoring by former Notre Dame All-American Ziggy Czarobski and David Vinson, Notre Dame's 6-2, 236 pound senior offensive guard from Liberty, Tx. 
Czarobski will be officially induc­ted as a member of the College Hall of Fame, while Vinson will be honored as one of the Foundation's eleven college senior scholar­athletes. Vinson is a Dean's List student enrolled in the College of Science's pre-med program. 
Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh, University president, who received the "Distinguished American Award" in 1975, commented that, ·'I felt all along Fr. Joyce should have received it at that time 
'Young Execs' 
ling Equipment Distributors Asso­ciation will hold a "Young Execu­tive's Forum" at Notre Dame tomorrow through Friday. Six faculty members will participate in a series of conferences and work­shop sessions. 
Speakers will include Salvatore Bella, professor of management, · "Contemporary Techniques for More Effective Communication;" John Malone, professor of mar­keting, "Keys to Successful Opera­tions Management;" D. Chris Anderson, professor of psychology, "The Skills of Behavior Manage­ment;" C. Joseph Sequin, chair­man of the Department of Manage­ment, "How to Maximize on Your Own Leadership Potential;" Kenneth Milani, professor of accountancy, "Creative Budgeting Techniques;" and William Sexton, a· sociate professor of -business organization, "Developing Per­sonal Confidence and Competence as an Executive."

because he has made somuch more of a contribution in this area than I have." 
Hesburgh, w)to will be giving the invocation and benediction at the dinner, added that Joyce, "has been on of the people who has really been a standout for values and standards in intercollegiate athletics and the importance of academic standards, particularly in 
, parts of running what I call a clean operation." According to McDowell, the "Distinguished American Award" goes to "outstanding Americans who have a close association with the game. They don't have to be a former player." The Executive Director of the Foundation noted that the award is not presented every year but only on "special occasions." Joyce, who recently observed his 25th anniversary as the Univer­sity's executive vice president, will also be sharing the spotlight to­night with Gen. Lewis H. Wilson. Wilson will be receiving the "Gold Medal Award," the Foundation's 
major award which is given every year to a former football player. 
Wilson, who played at Millsaps College in Jackson, Ms., is cur­rently Commandant.of the U.S. Marine Corps. He was once awarded the Congressional Medal 
of  Honor  in  World  War  II  for  
services at Guam.  
Joyce will joing  a  long  list of  

"Distinguished American Award" winners. Besides Hesburgh, that list includes Gen. James Van Fleet, last year's winner, Bob Hope; Frank Boyden, headmaster of Deerfield Academy for SO years William Carpenter, Army football's "Lonely End," and the late Vin­cent Lombardi. 
Hailing from Spartenburg NC, Joyce enrolled at Notre Dame in 1933, where he majored in account­ing and received his Bachelor of Science degree, magna cum laude, four years later. After completing his theological studies at Holy Cross College in Washington, D.C.,Joyce was ordained to the priesthood in 1949 in Sacred Heart Church. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-­
After his ordination, Joyce served as Notre Dame's vice pres­ident for business affairs and later as acting vice president. He was promoted to executive vice president in 1952 following a year of advanced study at Oxford University in England. 
Joyce is presently treasurer of Notre Dame and chairman of the University's Building Committee. He is best known, however, in his capacity as the chairman of the Faculty Board in Control of Athle­tics. He has been a trustee of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, is a director of the Institute for Educational Manage­ment at Cambridge MA., and is a trustee of Junior Achievement. 
Joyce was appointed by Presi­dent Eisenhower to serve on the Board of Visitors of the U.S. Naval Academy and was awarded the Air Force's "Exceptional Service Award," the highest award that the Air Force gives to civilians, for helping the Academy to set up their athletic program. 
The executive vice president 
-

holds honorary doctorates from t~e College of St. Thomas and Belmont Abbey College. He is presently a member of the new College Foot­ball Association, which promotes the interests of national football powers within the National Colle­giate Athletic Association. 
Joyce, who the Foundation calls "one of college football's most ardent champions and spokes­men," played a key role in Notte Dame's return to bowl competition after 45 years. He is also credited with the coordination and planning of the Athletic and Convocatio~ Center, so much so that the building will be renamed after him upon his retirement. 
In announcing Joyce's selection earlier this year, Vincent de Paul Draddy, the Foundation's chair­man was quoted in the Founda­tion's Footballetter as saying that "Father Joyce has been a great friend and supporter of the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame and College football as well. He is truly a distinguished American.''

abbreviation to medical school hopefuls is GPA. Without a re­spectable grade point average, a student's chance of acceptance to medical school is hampered. Ac­cording to Walter, a student with a 
3.5 grade point average is "virtual­ly assured of acceptance," to medical school. 
''lf the student is doing along the 
line of 3.2 work," Walter said, "I 
encourage him to do better--but his 
is, in fact doing good. If the student 
has a 3.0-3.2 average, I'd warn the 
student that acceptance is not 
certain and that he should consider 
alternatives--if the average is be­
low 3.0 I would strongly encourage . 
that the student consider other 
alternatives besides medicine or 
dentistry." 
Why such high standards for 
medical school admission? 
Again, the rush to medical 
schools is great, although national­
ly medical school applications have 
dropped slightly for the last two 
years. In 1975, for example, 15,351 
first-year medical students were 
selected from 42,303 applicants 
nationwide, according to the Amer­
ican Association of Medical Col­
leges. 
Nevertheless, competition is 
fierce. If a student applied to 
Stanford University School of Med­
icine for the entering class of 
1976-77 he would find that there 
were 5,117 applicants for 86 slots in 
the class. at the Vanderbilt Univer­
sity School of Medicine in Nash­
ville, 6,095 students applied for 
about 90 slots in the entering class 
of 1976-77. 
Despite the tremendous odds, 
Notre Dame's premedical and pre­· dental students can pat themselves on the back, because the program is producing good students. Said James P. Danehy, professor of chemistry, "There are two things that make the preprofessional pro­gram good here. First, Notre Dame is a well-respected, well-known private university. Because many students want to get in here, 
there's a high degree of selective­ness. Therefore, I'm identifying

with the quality of students. There's no question about it, they're good students .. 
''Secondly, the program of pre­professional studies is something unique,'' Danehy explained. "Lawrence Baldinger, who was the dean of the College of Arts and Letters about 20 years ago, was interested in a method of preparing students for medical school. He started the notion of devising a program. Also he put emphasis on 
establishing a relationship with the medical schools." 
Walter attributes the success of the program partly to the long tradition of students going to medical school from Notre Dame. "We've been sending students from here to medical school since 1900," he said. "And these stu­dents have been doing well wher­ever they go.'' Additionally, Wal­ter said that success has resulted from medical schools labelling 
· Notre Dame as a strong program. Walter added, "I have a good rapport with the admissions offi­cers at many schools. They trust our appraisals (recommendations), our program and our caliber of students. We get fairly good stu­dents to begin with. So you can give him a good education." According to Walter, the Jeffer­son Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadel­phia, Pittsburgh Medical School and Georgetown Medical School have Notre Dame pre-med gradu­ates who are deans of those medical schools. "We have many of our former pre-meds who teach or who are administrators that work at some med schools. So they know about our program.'' Tomorrow: What the students think.

night's game. 

Wrestlers grab eighth place in RIIWM 
DALLAS [AP]· Notre Dame 
Coach Dan Devine said Monday he 
feels the Fighting Irish would be a 
"contender" for the national 
college football championship if 
they defeat No. 1 ranked Texas in 
the Jan.2 Cotton Bowl Classic. 
"I don't want to get into a battle 
of words with other coached," said 
the coach of the nation's fifth­
ranked team which finished the 
regular season with a 10-1 record. 
"There are a lot of good teams but 
the best team in the United States 
is Texas. And Texas beat Okla­
homa and Arkansas. 
"We're just happy to take a shot 
at the champ." 
Devine. talking to local media from a telephone in St. Louis, Mo., where he was recruiting, told the Dallas-Fort Worth Media Associa­tion that "Texas is No. 1 and our job is to do the best we can. Then we'll let the polls take care of fhemselves.'' 
Devine praised Texas All­American running back Earl Camp­bell, saying "They tell me he is a fine young man as well as a great player. That puts him in the category of just under Sainthood." 
"It should be a great game," said Devine. "The Texas people are just as dedicated as we are and we're just as dedicated as they are. 
"It should be one of the all-time great bowl games." 

Devine said he was particularly excited about the trip because "I've never coached in the Cotton Bowl before." 
Notre Dame will come to Dallas on Dec.23. 
"We'll have Christmas in Dallas and enjoy it much the say we did theGator Bowl last year," said Devine. "We're planning a picture day on the morning of the 24th." 
Unbeaten Texas doesn't plan to come to Dallas until Dec. 30. It will be the third time this season that the Longhorns will play in the Cotton Bowl. Regular season games against Oklahoma and _ Southern Methodist were played in the 72,000 seat saucer. 
Devine said he wasn't certain whether Notre Dame would be wearing its lucky green outfit that the Fighting Irish wore in the upset of Southern California. 
"We'll wear whatever color the Cotton Bowl officials want us to wear but I suspect it will be white for better contrast on black and white television,'' said Devine. "Wewould prefer to wear green." 
Devine reiterated that he is not leaving Notre Dame although there has been speculation he might return to Missouri. 
''I have no intention of leaving Notre Dame," he said. "I intend to honor my contract which has two years on it.'' 
the Irish defeated Marquette 51-35 on March 7, 1959. 
On Notre Dame's side, Williams ended up high point man with 22 points and four steals followed by Batton's 13 markers nine re­bound, three blocked shots perfor­mance. It was Williams and Batton who finally broke down Lafayette's 1-3-1 zone defense. 
'We are going to continue to see teams slow down the tempo of the game and play different zone defenses," explained Phelps. "But these kids do not lost their composure. Sometimes you are going to break away in the first half and sometimes it will come in the second half.' 

Dave DiSabato certainly did not 
let the 10 hour car ride from South 
Bend to Rochester, N.Y., affect his 
performance at the Rochester In­
stitute Invitational Wrestling Tour­
nament this past weekend. The sophomore grappler took home the only first place finish for the Notre Dame wrestling team, his second first place crown in as many tournaments. 
Overall, the Fighting Irish grap­plers wound up eighth out of the 19 team field with 54-5 points. The University of Buffalo captured top team honors with 131 followed by Kent State (106) and Ohio State (102.25). Host school RIT ended 15th with 12 points. 
"I was satisfied with having three wrestlers get into the finals, but was a little disappointed that some of our other grapplers did not do as well as they might have," commented Ray Sepeta, head coach of Notre Dame. "They had the ability but are inexperienced and did not perform up to their full capabilities." 
Dave DiSabato was certainly an exception to this, winning the 126 pound weight division. He had won at the Indiana State Invita­tional Nov. 23, and after a slow start at the Biggy Munn Invitation­al now has two consecutive crowns under his belt. 
DiSabato defeated Jeff Woo of Ohio State in the final 9-4. En route to the championship match, Dave manhandled Phil Desmone of Oswego 10-1 and got by Bill Griffin of Potsdam and St. Lawrence's John Caulfield by identi'cal scores of 7-2. 
Pat McKillen and Mike Padden took home second place honors for the Irish. No other Notre Dame grapplers placed in the two-uay tournament. 
McKillen pinned Cal Crippen of Oswego in his first match ofthe 153 pound class at the 3:49 mark and then went on to defeat Rochester's Jamie Button 8-2 and Greg Nettle­ton of the State University of New York at Geneseo 4-3 to make it to the finals. Ohio State's Bruce Solomon beat the Notre Dame senior, ho"(ever, 6-1 for the 153 pound title. 


Padden lost the 170 pound championship bout to Oswego's Mike Corley 10-7. Mike wrestled , strongly in his previous matches I enroute to the final, defeating Scott Ewing of Rochester 6-0 and Lloyd Woodruff of Colgate 10-3 before blanking Bruce Hadsell of the these two schools, never having University of Buffalo 5-0 in the lost to either one.
