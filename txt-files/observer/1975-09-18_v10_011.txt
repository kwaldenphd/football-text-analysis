renovations completed

Hy Don Reimer Senior Staff Reporter 

The renovation of the LaFortune Student Center has been completed at a cost of $190,000 of the original $250,000 allotment from the Board of Trustees. This information was revealed yesterday by Fr. Jerome Wilson, university vice-president for business affairs. 
Remodeling of the Huddle, the only unfinished part of the renovation plans, is being delayed because the $60,000 remaining in the fund is insufficient to com­plete the project. 
"I think the renovation was pretty successful," said Hon Blitch, a fifth year architecture student who worked on the plans. "It's a shame it couldn't all have been done at once, because they increased the price of everything by doing it piecemeal," he con­tinued. 
"They paid an awful price for indecision," said Blitch referring to the $190,000 cost of renovation. He explained that if the renovation of the whole building had been contracted for at once, rather that in parts as it was done, the total price might have been reduced. 
lmprovemtmts Made 

Included in the improvements were refurbishing of the lounge of the first floor, installation of new staircases, relocation of student government and publication offices, and painting the interior of the building. 
Renovation of the Huddle is the major piece of work yet to be done, though its remodeling was originally the number-<>ne priority in renovation plans. The original order of the major work called for the remodeling of the Huddle, followed by the relocation of student government and publications offices, and 
Due to typo 

the refurbishing of the lounge area. 
"The reason the Huddle was dropped from first on the list was because of the length of time taken to decide how to remodel it," said Wilson. 
In the October 16, 1974 issue of the Observer Blitch stated, "The Huddle is still the first priority but the work there would have to wait until next summer and we want at least to be able to show that something is being done." 
However by January, 1975 work on the Huddle had been given last priority "because of the size and expense of the project" according to a statement made by Blitch in that issue. 
Nt>ed More Funds for Huddle 
Presently, the remodeling of the Huddle is in "limbo" according to Wilson, because the $60,000 remaining from the original grant is inadequate to fund the operation. 
"We know that $60,000 isn't enough money to add on the room to the Huddle because we would have to tear off the entire roof of the pool room, over which the additional space would be added," stated Wilson. He extima ted the present cost of remodeling the Huddle to be at least $150,000. 
Blitcli felt "that if the administration really wanted 
to do something to improve the Huddle, they could," 
even with the lesser funds. He added that plans for 
the remodeling had already been drawn up. 
Reacting to Blitch's statement, Wilson commented, 
"As far as I'm concerned, I'm not interested in doing 
the Huddle over unless we can do the whole thing and 
really do what the students want."

SMC students overcharged 
by Pt>ggy Frericks and Mary Janca 
St. Mary's student government fees for the 1975-76 school year were accidentally increased from $10 to $14, due to a typographical error, according to Student Government President Joan McDermott. 
This higher fee, along with a list of other student fees, was billed to students during the summer vacation. The error was discovered approximately two weeks ago by Stevie Wernig, assistant to the vice president for student affairs, and McDermott. 
At a Student Assembly meeting last week, representative Kathy Pugliese proposed an option to remedy the situation. Under the proposal, SMC students have the choice of collecting the $4 rebate, or of contributing the overcharge to the construction of proposed recreation facility. 
In last evening's mail, all SMC students received a letter from student government, disclosing the error, and urging them to con­tribute the $4 to the recreation center fund. 
The letter further explained that students would have a week to obtain the rebate. Ifnot notified by Sept. 24, student government will forward the $4 per student to the fund for the new gym. 
On-campus students should detach the slip on the bottoms of the letter, and return it to their hall office by next Wednesday, in­dicating whether they wish to collect their rebate, or to donate it. 

Off-campus and day students are asked to return their slips to the Student Affairs office. 
"We are sorry for this oversight, and we are now in the process of correcting the situation," com­mented McDermott. 
The typographical error, it was discovered, was originally made when last year's fees were being itemized. However, the $4 over­charge was not included in the total, so students were not over­charged last year. 
When this year's student bill was being tabulated, however, the incorrect $14 was copied from last year's bill, and student govern­ment fee was added onto the total. As a result, students were over­charged. · 

Reflections on a Bangladesh trip 

Editor's Note: AI Sondej, Co-founder of the Notre Dame-St. Mary's World Hunger Coalition, spent this past summer travelling around the world. 
Notre Dame President Fr. Theodore Hesburgh suggested and sponsored the trip, which took Sondej to parts of Asia, Arrica, Europe and the Middle East. 
The following letter addressed to Fr. Hesburgh contains Sondej's rerlections on the two-month period he spent in Bangladesh, ob­serving and working with various developmental projects. 
Dear Father Hesburgh, 
You knew what you were talking about when you said that you thought it would be a good idea for me to see the faces of the hungry, the sick, the homeless, the illiterate, and the poor. To be quite frank with you, I originally did not think that this trip would affect me that much, but next to Tom Hamilton, Peter Neary (a high school teacher who taught me to question values), and my family of course, nothing has affected me more. Last year I earned $35 a week, but after seeing 1-5th of Bangladesh's 75 million people each making only $18 a year, I know that I will never be poor. The filth, the stench, the garbage, the much that the people of poverty eat in, work in, sleep in, and die in is something that could never be imagined. And what is really horrible is that these conditions af­fect most of mankind, and will continue to do so until people change their basic attitudes and behavior. 
I was always aware that changing the values of others is 
something that is beyond my power. But through this trip, thanks 
to you, it has finally sunk in that changing others should not be the 
primary purpose of my actions. One loves another ultimately, not 
by intending to motivate that person to change, but perhaps by 
simply being what that person needs. One can only hope that the 
values of others will change. To give up of oneself for another is one 
thing, to ask others to do the same is quite another. It's just so easy 
to deceive oneself into thinking that it's better to try and jam ideals 
down society's throat, instead of offering what little one can of 
oneself and accepting the fact that it's going to make "only a dent". 
So finally realizing that there is a difference between making 
students aware of mankind's enormous and immediate challenge, 
the development of social equality in a finite biosphere; and im­
posing upon them a situation in which they are publically con­
fronted to respond everyday, I have decided that this will be my 
last panhandling year under the Golden Dome. By the way, I can 
see why you said that Notre Dame has the greatest student body in 
the world. They not only put up with me pestering them everday, 
but also selflessly contributed over $14,000 last school year. And I'll 
always be grateful to them for that. 
Father, after seeing unimaginable poverty, I can't help but question the morality of nations and even individuals, myself in­cluded of course, owning surplus resources that the poor majority of people need. However, recognizing private property rights the observer Thursday, September 18, 1975

Does she or doesn't she? 
COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -A court has ruled that a policeman can tell from the way a woman walks whether she is soliciting or not, a decision that has enraged Danish prostitutes. 
"This is ridiculous," snapped the 22-year-old woman on trial. "If police can judge from a girl's way of walking whether she is out to make business then they should arrest a lot of ladies all over town." 
The arresting officer told a district court trying the woman on multiple soliciting charges Tuesday that he had frequently watched her on the street where she lives in Copenhagen's red light district of Vesterbro, a short walk from the downtown luxury hotel district. 
"I took action only when she was obviously soliciting, and that was easily determined from the way she walked," the policeman testified. 
On his testimony alone the woman was fine $150 -the latest in a hail of fines raining on Vesterbro prostitutes. 
The woman did not deny she was a prostitute. Prostitution is legal in Denmark, but soliciting in a public place is not. 
Group to study sex bias 
by Kathy Byrne Staff Reporter 

A study group at St. Mary's College, commissioned by a federal grant to help end sexual discrimination in the South Bend Community School Corporation, will begin public workshops on sexual discrimination this Saturday. 
Project CHOICE (Creating Human Options in Children's Education), supported by a·$48,118 grant from the U.S. Department of Health, Education and ·Welfare, will hold ten such public workshops this year. Topics range from an action model study of the Kalamazoo, Mich. school system this Saturday, to the final draf~ of the resolution for the elimination federal law, and it is easier for us to do it for them. That's why we have so many administrator participants coming to us," she added. 
The twenty participants are members of the South Bend school system in key positions with whom the directors of Project CHOICE felt it would be best to work. There will be one workshop that will be closed to all but thesEJ. twenty of­fiCial participants. ~ 
In addition to the Kalamazoo representatives this Saturday, Marcia Sheridan of the Depart­ment of Education at I.U.S.B. will give a needs assessment of the South·;Bend school system. Details can be''obta,ined by calling Project CHOICE at 284-4087, Monday -'Friday. 



High court ruling stands 
Washington AP -A Senate Judiciary subcommittee refused Wednesday to begim an effort to overturn the Supreme Court decision allowing abortion on demand in the early months of pregnancy. 
The subcommittee's series of votes on proposed constitutional amendments concerning the highly emotional issue appeared to kill anv chance during this session of Congress to overturn the 1973 court ruling. 
Sen. Birch Bayh., D-Ind., the subcommittee chairman, said he regarded it as highly unlikely that an attempt would be made to revive any of the proposed amendments in the full Judiciary Committee. 
Outside the room where the subcommittee acted behind closed doors, women from opposing pro-abortion and right-to life groups awaited the outcome of the votes. Among them was a man reading aloud from a Bible. 
The Planned Parenthood Federation of America called the committee's action "a courageous stroke in the defense of the physical health, personal well­being and economic equity of American women ... It raises the hnnP. that we may now end the 
fruitless d~bate over the legality of abortion .." The , National Abortion Rights Action League said it "is a clear victory for those who support abortion rights."

tivities, said the subcommittee's actions was "disappointing but not the fillfll word. For millions of Americans, non-Catholics and Catholics alike, who oppose

By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON 
Associated Press Writer 

WASHINGTON <AP) -For­mer CIA Director Richard Helms testified Wednesday his employes were trained to ac­cept oral commands as "orders written in blood" -and there­fore he had spurned ink and pa­per when relaying a directive from the President of the United States. 
Helms said the CIA's failure to destroy its cache of poisons in accordance with former President Richard M. Nixon's order was an. "odd aberration" unlikely to recur. 
He told the Senate In­telligence Committee that while he issued no written backup or­der he had assumed the shellf­
ish  toxin  and other poisons  had  
been destroyed.  
Sen.  Walter  Mondale,  D­ 

Minn., told Helms and Thomas Karamessines, the CIA's for­mer deputy director for plans, that their responses pinpoint the difficulty the committee has had in assessing responsibility inside CIA for a wide variety of questionable actions, including the alleged assassination of for­eign leaders. 
"The situation always is something happened and no­bod_Y did it," Mondale said. 
Shortly after Helms testified, it was announced that Sidney Gottlieb, a former CIA scientist whom Karamessines identified as the person to whom he re­layed the order to destroy the toxins, has told the committee through his lawyer he will in­voke the Fifth Amendment and refuse to answer questions. 
The committee is seeking to question Gottlieb, former head of the agency's Technical Serv­ices Division, in connection with both the retention of the shellfish toxin and the destruc­tion of records about the CIA's testing of LSD and other behav­ior-modifying drugs. 
Frederick A. o: Schwarz Jr., the committee's chief counsel, said the Justice Department has been told that if Gottlieb does invoke his constitutional

right to avoid self-in­crimination, the committee will se"ek to compel his testimony by granting him immunity for whatever he might say. 
Both Helms, now U.S. am­bassador to Iran, and Karames­sines testified that Gottlieb ap­peared to agree fully with them that the order issued early in 1970 by former president Rich­ard_M. Nixon was valid, did ap­ply to the CIA, and should be complied with. 
The order renounced the use by the United States of chem­ical and biological weapons and directed that they be destroyed.

abortion will continue their efforts to secure full legal protection for the unborn." 
Bayh said he voted against all of the proposed amendments but would immediately introduce legislation designed to provide alternatives to abortion for women who have an unintended pregnancy. 
Bayh declined to say how other subcommittee members voted on· the proposed constitutional amendments, but other sources gave this rundown: 
Voting for the Helms amend­ment were Thurmond and Sen. Hiram L. Fong, R-Hawaii; against it, in addition to Bayh, were Sens. Jamews Abourezk, D-S.D.; Quentin F. Burdick, D-N.D., Charles F. Mathias, R-MD., and Scott. 
On the Scott states rights amendment, Sen,. James 0. Eastland, D-Miss., chairman of the 
full Judiciary Committee, voted 
for it by proxy, as did Thurmond 
and Scott. Against it were Bayh,
Burdick, Abourezk, Mathias and Fong. 
The tie vote on the other states rights amendment was Scott, Burdick, Thurmond and Eastland by proxy for, and Bayh, Abourezk, Mathias and Fong and Mathias against. 
Supporting the Buckley !lmendment were Fong and fhurmond. Voting against it were Bayh, Abourezk, Burdick, Scott and Mathias. 
Fong said in a statement before the subcommittee meeting that he would vote in the Senate to uphold the Supreme Court decision but would not try to keep the proposed constitutional amendments bottled up in committee. 
However, he said he would vote in the subcommittee against the states rights .amendments because he did not feel they had been fully explored at hearings, held earlier in the year. 
Fong noted his state was one of the first to provide for legal abortions and said he was in ac­cord with its position and that of the Supreme Court. 
Sen. Philip A. Hart, D-Mich., another member of the sub­committee, is hospitalized. No proxy votes were cast for him. 
The legislation Bayh introduced to offer alternatives to abortion included provisions for establishing a national network of life support centers offering medical , counseling and social services for young parents. 
He said it also would bar sex or 
marital discrimination by health 
insurers, provide an expanded 
federal role in child care, and 
increased funding for programs to 
help teenage mothers. ·

Japan study program reviewed 

William Boris said that, although

Campus Editor .. .. school, he learned much more 
Although charges have been made that the year of study in Japan is an academic wasteland, many participants in the program feel these statements are exaggerated, and that academics play only a small part in the total experience. 
Most of the students in the program last year felt it was extremely worthwhile. A few have hopes of returning to Japan for further study. 
Academically Weak 

Last spring, three Notre Dame students sent a letter to Observer editors directed to "All-you-future­year-in-Japan-students." The three said that Sophia University in Tokyo with which Notre Dame is af­filiated is "not. ..up to academic standards." 
The program is divided into trimesters, the last one being a short six-week session. The students wished to drop out of this last trimester and return to the United States. 
"It wasn't worth it academically," stated Patrick 

flaherty, one of the cosigners of the letter. "I wanted 
to get back and get a job. There was no profit in 
staying." 
However, they were informed by University of­

ficials that withdrawal from the program was 
tquivalent to withdrawal from Notre Dame and they 
would subsequently have to apply for readmission. 
All three remained in the program until its conclusion 
at the end of May. 
"I knew the school was going to be a joke 
academically," Michael Dillon, one of last year's 
participants said. "I went, and it was, but it didn't 
bother me." 
Dillon termed the year in Japan "the best thing I've 
ever done." 
''The program is irrelevant to the experience," 
Dillon continued. "You get what you make out of it 
personally; you have to get out and meet people" 
Dr. Charles Parnell, director of the foreign studies 
program, explained that students who spend a year in 
Japan do not study at Sophia University itself. They 
study at the University's International Division 
which has students from all over the world, most of 
whomspeak English as a second language. 
Dillon elaborated, "The quality of the education is 
poor. but the University does serve a purpose since 
most of the students speak English as a second 
language. The school is great for these people. For 
example, a large number of them are Chinese, but 
have lived in Japan most of their lives since theire 
parents work there. They might speak Chinese, 
.Japanese, and English all broken. They know three 
languages but none of them really well." 
Fr. George Minamiki, professor of Japanese at 
Notre Dame, said the International Division was 
established at Sophia after World War II to serve the 
children of foreigners who came into the country. 

Minimiki said that Sophia University itself is one of the top three universities in Japan, and the foreign students would not be able to compete academically with the Japanese nationals. 
He said that the relationship between the In­ternational Division and Sophia University is roughly analogous to a seminar at the Center for Continuing Education and Notre Dame. 
However, Minimiki explained, the credits obtained at the International Division are transferrable to any university in the United States. 
John Colligan said the courses in Japanese history, politics, and beginning Japanese were "a joke." He also said some of the guest lecturers in the in­troductory sociology course spoke no English, and that the course described as comparative Japanese sociology was actually a course in social theory. 
Flaherty stated that the courses seemed to lack organization and demanded memorization. 
"Teacher attitude was hard to pinpoint," he related. "One teacher came right out and said something roughly equivalent to 'teaching this class is something I do on the side'." 
Complaints answered 
Parnell said that many of the complaints of the students had brought results. He said the beginning Japanese professor whom many of the students had termed "a basket case" is gone on a one-year leave of absence. 
Also, the administrator of the program, Fr. Joe de Vera -..J., has been informed by Parnell that Notre Dame students take 15 credit hours, not 18 as de Vera believed l;onsequently, t.he number of core courses 
has been reduced from five to four, allowing the 
students this year to take a free elective. 
RL·t, ··diug the professor who said he taught the course "on the side," Parnell noted that the ins in­structor might have been similar to an adjunct professor at Notre Dame, who, although he is an expert in his field, is not primarily a college professor. Parnell questioned whether the professor's statement really indicated adversity to teaching the course. 
"You have to admit we have some real 'jock' 
courses here," Parnell commented. "What are they 
~omparing the courses to? Also, tf they want just 
1ook learning, they could have st.:ved here." 
Outside education 
While the academic aspect of the year in Japan is the part of the program which has received the most complaints and the most attention, most of the students feel as Dillon does that "the program is irrelevant to the experien<:-e." 
Urban Studies 
Institute provides challenges 
by Christie A. Herlihy 
Starr Reporter 
Although the title, Institute of Urban Studies, seems an all en­compassing term, the program is stepped in a social perspective so typically Notre Dame. Dedicated to the "humanization of urban life", it is concerned with the problems of race and poverty which Director Thomas Broden asserts is "an area in which the University has had a traditional interest, especially under Father Hesburgh." 
Founded in 1969, the program now involves 75 majors. The emphasis is a Judeo-Christian philosophy as opposed to. technical land use focus, prompting the development of courses in close affiliation with the Moreau Seminary. Such courses are to provide future priests with a grasp of the realities of life, the urban problems which they will face in the field. "This social ministry focus attempts to explain how institutions operate and how those in the church can bring about change practically," explained 
Broden. 
To supplement the classroom 
learning experience, the institute 
provides two other opportunities: 
research through local community 
and national projects, and in­
ternships within South Bend. 
One of the research projects, the 
Urban Observatory Program, was 
drawn up in response to the need of 
city officials. In a national contest 
sponsored by HUD. the Notre 
Dame program ranked among the 

facilities in South Bend and for the efficient co-<~peration by both the University and the city in using the facilities. 
After a year of planning, another research project, the Multi­cultural Education Process, became a reality this September. This service provides information on local ethnic culture to teachers in South Bend schools with the hope that it will broaden the perspective of children's studies. 
Contributions made by Black, Chicano, Polish, Hungarian, and Jewish peoples are represented in a focus which is more local than national. Historical documents, films and taped interviews with community experts, who have lived through various adjustment experiences as a member of an ethnic minority, all have been collected into an educational package. Broden hopes it will 
'open teachers' minds and broaden the spectrum of the community." 
The Multicultural Process has been well received in the schools, Broden said. "The approach is positive because it deals with a variety of ethnic groups on an equal cultural basis." 
Broden hopes that such an early exposure to ethnic culture might prevent the heated racial tension which plagues Boston. "But once the situation gets to the point of Boston where the hatred and mistrust between races has already solidified, it will take a long time to heal. The destiny of America is that the pluralism of its people be equally respected."

Studies also sponsors an internship program under faculty super­vision. The program emphasizes a long term relationship with the South Bend community of five to ten hours per week for a semester. 
Positions are available in the city Department of Human Resources, Public Safety, the United Religious Community, the United Way, and the Model Cities Program. Law students may serve as interns under practicing lawyers while third year law students may personally appear in court and carry out full-fledged legal responsibilities. 
South Bend has welcomed Notre Dame's attempt to get involved in the community, Broden said. "I have personally found the ad­ministrators of agencies, both public and private, open to receiving student support." 
The only program difficulties that the institute has encountered has been when a director has not been assigned to help a student adjust to his new job. "We have tried to identify those situations," Broden said. "If the student is not fully involved, then the program is a waste of time. "We have tried to identify those situations

outside of class. 
Dillon termed the problems which most of the students en­countered in their studies as being "petty." 
Denise Wilt explained that the classroom work was framework around which to organize the experience, and that she profited most from living with a Japanese family. School, in her case, was secondary. 
"Japan is a great place," Flaherty said, "but none I think do there embrace. The Japanese people are really friendly." 
"I learned more in that one year than I've ever learned before in my life," Dillon stated. "I don't have to be spoon-fed. I went out and got it on my own. I read a lot." 
"What you say about the .program is very subjective," 
Dillon commented. "It's a very personal experience.'' 
The best way to learn about the culture, according to Colligan, is to join one of the numerous student clubs. Colligan joined the sym­phony orchestra which he said is the "best symphony orchestra in Japan outside of a music con­servatory." 
He noted that there are student clubs for · kendo, or Japanese fencing, traditional Japanese music, aikido and judo, guitar, painting, and the tea ceremony. One student was able to spend several weeks living in a Zen monastery. 
Recommendations 

A few of the students recom­
mended ways of improving the 
program. 
Colligan said he hopes the University will consider the program offered by Calliston College in California. The Calliston students spend the first trimester in intensive language study. The next trimester is an "internship" at a Japanese commune. 
He explained that a Japanese commune is not idyllic, but a place of intense work. One girl went to traditional folk music commune to study guitar and traditional dance. 
Another student studied ancient forms of religion, and a third went to a commune whose members have revived ancient Japanese spiritual practices. Some students went to farms in northern Japan, others to a Zen Temple. 
"This gives the student a much wider range of experience," Colligan said. "And they did the

Wilson Interested in Remodeling Huddle 
Wilson indicated that he was still interested in 
remodeling the Huddle if more money could be ob­
tained from the Board of Trustees. 
"It was a good idea and still is," said Wilson, "but with that much money you want to do the right thing." 
The LaFortune renovation committee was formed in the fall semester of 1972 by three ND students in­terested in improving the student center. This committee worked throughout the '72-'73 school year to form concrete plans for the renovation of the center, as well as a philosophy behind the plans, a~d their plans were presented to the Board of Trustees m the spring of 1973. 
The Board did approve the full set of plans. 
However, the cost of the project proved to be too high and, during the '73-'74 school year, the .Bo.ard agreed to provide the $250,000 fund for more hmited renovation. 
The first work done on the building came during the summer of 1974 when the student government and

same amount of work (at Sophia) in the last trimester as we did in the whole year." 

Wilt stated that the ad­ministrator, de Vera, reminds her of "something out of the Spanish Inquisition," and that the Notre Dame administration should have more say in the selection of courses than de Vera. She also recommended that the program should be screened more ef­fectively. 
Parnell said, "Our year abroad 
students haven't been harmed 
academically." His statement is 
well-supported by Minimiki, who 
keeps in close touch with all his 
former students. 
"Three students have qualified for the Ministry of Education exam in the United States," Minimiki related. "One is now in Japan at Hokaido University and passed the Japanese exam for the masters degree in history. One went to Harvard Law School, another to the Stanford Law School. Six students have gotten Rotary Club scholarships to go back to Japan. They're going to the Sophia University graduate school and the International Christian Univer­sity." 
Dillon summed it up: "The trip is what you make it." 
Multl-media ShOW 

to be presented 

"Notre Dame in Review," the multi-media show depicting the history of the University and the involvement of its people in area and national projects, has been revised and will be presented without charge for visitors to the campus on home football Satur­days· this fall. 
Sponsored by the Alumni Association, the shows in Washington Hall on September 27, October 4 and 25, and November 1 and 8 will begin at 10:55 a.m. with a medley of University songs by the Notre Dame Glee Club. Greater emphasis on community-related activities of students and faculty during the film portion of the program has replaced last year's focus on coeducation and minority

publications offices were relocated. During the following school year much of the remaining work was completed such as the new stairs and the pain­ting last summer the lounge was completed. 
Pub Possible in LaFortune Basement 
Wilson indicated the possibility of a Pub in the basement of LaFortune if the legal drinking age in Indiana is lowered to 18. 
"If the drinking age is lowered and we can get the 
money we could probably make the basement and the 
whole first floor a pub," said Wilson. 
Wilson suggested-that beer could be sold in the basement and students could go to the first floor and sit in a lounge area. 
Reactions of student s and persons working in the area of the lounge to the changes in LaFortune were generally favorable. 
Brother John Benesh, director of student activities, whose office is just off the lounge, commented that he "liked the new arrangement very much." 
"It is attractive and comfortable," he noted. "and it seems to be the way people want it." He added that it seemed to be a gathering-place for off-campus students." 
Maureen Muldoon, Benesh's secretary, also liked the refurbished lounge area and added that "It seems that a lot more people use it." 
Students Like New LouRge 
The lounge is crowded with people during the lunch hour and many stated that they like the new at­mosphere. 
"It looks really nice,' one student commented. "I think I'll stop in more often." 
"It looks better and it's more comfortable to sit in here,'' added another student. He also said that he "definitely" thought that the addition of games, such as pinball machines, would be an impr'?vement. 
On the negative side, Brother Francis Gorch, manager of the LaFortune Student Center, said that he didn't think that any more people were using the lounge since the refurbishing. 
"alitch felt that "the renovation of the center should be an ongoing process." 
"Students change and the building should change," said Blitch. "We have the center pretty much open to future changes." 



Reflections on a 
(continued from page 1) 

would be the logical thing to do if one could do more good by using other alternative~Maybea more mature approach to the problem of social inequality would be to perform a service for the rich people; that is, intelligently and considerately present the dilemma, and provide and allow for their free response, rather than try to force an ideal upon people. It is a good idea for me to remember that development, in the long term, is a process that can happen only if it is accepted as a goal by society; and not an ideal by which they are threatened. Moreover, "stealing" may necessitate violence, and violence as a means to the just ends of social equality would be ethically questionable if each individual is an intrinsic value. Furthermore, Grif made a good point when he said that God, not man, made humans depen­dent upon one another for their existence; and when people freely choose to give up of themselves for another, it is an act out of love, 
not out of obligation, or guilt. 

It is with these thoughts in mind that I have decided to panhandle at Notre Dame for the last year. If I objectively state what a penny and dime could buy, smile warmly and sensitively at those who don't contribute, thank those who do, and above all, realize that I am dealing with people and not dollar signs, I think that there should not be too much of a sense of oblication or guilt created among the students. 
Sure there will be those will question who do I think I am -that is 
their right. However, I am not concerned. I have seen suffering 
and death, needless suffering and death in a world capable of 
supporting 30-40 billion people. And I can-'t just sit back and watch 
it happen. All I wish to do is what little I can ·do help alleviate this 
harsh reality affecting most of us by helping create a situation in 
which the rich can freely respond to the needs of the poor. I feel the 
need for my fellow countrymen and myself, as well as the rest of 
the people of the developed world to think in terms of conserving 
and sharing finite resources, if we as well as the rest of mankind 
are to continue to exist. And most of all, I would not panhandle if I 
did not think that the students would experience at least some of the 
Joy and Happiness in Giving. If anything, this trip has definitely 
made me more sure of myself and of who I am. 
As you can see, much of the contents of this letter is based on 
personal reflections, and for that reason, I have debated on 
whether to send it. But it's not everday that someone gives me a 
free trip around the world, thus I feel the least I owe you is some 
explanation on how it affected me. Coming to Bangladesh with an 
open mind has made me more sensitive to the various ways of 
responding to the needs of the poor. I've been fortunate enough to 
meet people there who are literally saints for they sacrifice 
themselve~ by living in all the horrors, problems, and indignities of 
the poor without ever asking for any money or recognition. I have 
learned something from the poor as well, namely -man does not need cars, bikes, boats, airplanes, washers, driers, refrigerators, freezers, stoves, ovens, television, radios, stereos, air conditioners fans, . dehumidifiers, phones, lamps, furniture, tapestry, lavish utensils, cabinets, running water, toilet facilities, and an array of countless other luxuries IN THE HOME to exist. 
It is through the witnessing of these that I have decided to 
pursue an idea that has been in

time now, namely, to create and construct a home that would be 
designed to ecologically fulfill the basic human needs. It would be a 
small block shaped building enclosing one room with the following 
approximate dimensions 4 feet by 10 feet by 4 feet. Its contents 
would most likely be a sleeping bag or cot, a heating apparatus, a 
clock, and several articles of clothing and eating utensils. Nearby 
would be constructed a small public building providing a supply of 
water and a toilet facility, with cess pool for recycling. And after 
seeing how most of mankind exists, well, I will be living in a castle. 
If I might add, the solution to mankind's problem of inequality is 
dependent not only upon whether mankind consumes resources to 
fulfill human wants or needs, but also upon the environmental 
impact that results from technologies that are used to fulfill human 
needs, as you well know. It is with this consideration that I intend 
in the not too distant future, if economically possible, to operate a 
small farm that would employ a technological system that would 
maximize outputs and positive environmental impact, with 
minimal inputs and negative environmental impact, over time, 
through an optimal utilization of resources. To implement this idea 
would require an extensive understanding of agriculture, ecology, 
and engineering, as well as of other natural and social sciences. 
But after seeing this world, thanks to you, I have only one desire -to 
LEARN how to live in it like a "world citizen". And maybe 
someday, I will be able to use this knowledge, if acquired, where 
the comparative advantage for food production exists in the 
developing world. 

Perhaps, I'm finally asking the question -what should "I" do? 
instead of what should "we" do? And I'm realizing that the answer 
will make only a dent, and I can accept it. I'm also aware that 
these plans are merely dreams, but it was just a year ago that I got 
this dumb idea of holding a plastic milk container. 
So again Father, thank you very much for the opportunity of a 
lifetime; the lessons I have learned from it have affected me im­
measurably. Enclosed is a small token of my appreciation. It's a 
jute wheel made by poor women in Bangladesh; and it signifies the 
role trade can play in the development of social equality in a finite 
biosphere. And Father, thank you very much for being you; I hate 
to think what this world would be .like without you in it.. 
Your Friend Always,

Lest We Forget 

The Committee on Undergraduate Life Is a project Initiated by students, largely staffed by students, concerned with student life and of critical Importance to students. It is too Important for students or Student Government to let Its Report be forgotten. But so far little has been done to follow through on it. 
Last October, then-SBP Pat Mclaughlin and a group of student leaders made a carefully-prepared presentation to the Board of Trustees which won ap­proval for a committee to study the priorities of un­dergraduate life. Subcommittees of COUL studied academics, student affairs, resldentlallty, coeducation and finances. 
Two of those committees--academics and student affairs--submitted only preliminary findings. The Report, presented to the Board's student affairs committee last May, concluded that much im­plementation and study still remains to be done and that progress reports should be made at the Board's meetings this year. 
The Report is important for students In two major respects. First, it Includes many excellent proposals on undergraduate life ranging from streamlining registration to establishing coed dorms. 
More importantly, the Report gives the Ad­ministration and the Board visible proof that students are responsible members of the University--something that is too often overlooked. The COU L Report was primarily a product of the Mclaughlin government's able leadership, but we certainly do not want the Administration and Board to think that such student leadership has disappeared so soon.

It was an easy line to sell. Bewailing the "anonymous monstrosity" of 
executive government and "reckless" Congressional spending, President 
Ford tol a Dallas audience last Saturday that he was ready to put a lid on 
bureaucracy. 
The National Federation of Republican Women ate it up. But then, it's 
an old GOP family recipe that's proven itself before, and Mr. Ford took 
care to spread it thick. If the speech seemed an attempt to out-Reagan 
Reagan, it was still packed with familiar Ford fare: Bicentennial Apple 
Pie, Women's Rights Garnishes a Ia Betty, and plenty of economic bullets 
for biting. 
But not much else. Condemning "social legislation and federal bureaucracy"--as though they were identical -the President offered little more than obstruction as a legislative program. Still, that seemed enough for the Republican women. 
Apparently nostalgic for the 18th century, Mr. Ford is promising to veto 
his way back to Adam Smith. He's not bluffing. But in attempting to halt 
or reverse the pattern of social legislation achieved over the last two 
decades, he is making it unclear which hundred years he's celebrating. 
The President seems to be working on three assumptions: that progressive legislation necessarily leads tQ bureaucracy, that nobody wants either, and that we'll be better individuals without them.

'Pornography reduces human sexuality 
by Bill Barnes Staff Reporter 

Dr. Walter Berns, professor of Political . Economics at the University of Toronto, last night addressed the opening meeting of the conference on obscenity and C'~mmunity affairs. 
~peaking before a small crowd in th, Center for Continuing Ed, ~ation, Berns discussed "the first amendment and the for­mation of character in a republic." 
Berns attempted to define pornography and vulgarity that he felt should be censored, centering his objections around intent rather than content.

Alumnus donates rare coins 
A collection of American Colonial coins and a V .S. type set of choice 20th century uncirculated coins have been presented to the university of Notre Dame's Memorial Library by Robert H. Gore, Jr., of Ft. Lauderdale . Fla. 
\ 

A hotel executive and a 1931 graduate of the University, Gore said the gifts would become a permanent part of the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections. 
The Colonials range in date from 1652 to 1795 and most are in"fine" to "extremely fine" condition with several uncirculated. Included in the collection are coinages such as the Pine Tree, Oak Tree,. · St. Patrick, Carolina Elephant, French Colonial, Hibernia, Rosa Americana, Nova Constellatio, Fugio Washingtion ad other coinages of the American Colonies and states. Also included in the collection is a valuable Higley Cooper struck in 1737 and a Con­tinental Currency pattern coin struck in 1776 known as the Con­tinental Dollar, the first dollar size coin minted in the United States. 
Gore is the son of the late Gov. 
R.H. Gore, ·sr., newspaper and insurance executive, who con­tributed a collection of rare steins to Notre Dane's University Club in 1968. He is one of six sons who

WASHINGTON (AP) -The Soviet Union tentatively has agreed to pay $16 a ton to U.S. ships carrying American grain to Russia, Secretary of Commerce Rogers Morton told President Ford Wednesday. Morton said the agreement is not final but the Russians had "given a handshake" on it Wedpesday. 
The tentative agreement colil.d remove a major stumbling block to a long-term grain agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union. 
The price is much higher than the current Russian payment rate of $9.5o(a ton and is a figure that apparently would be agreeable to George Meany, president of the AFL-CIO and the maritime unions.

Committee sets March date for mock convention 
by Brian Clancy Staff Reporter 
The National Mock Convention Committee in conjunction with the Notre Dame-St. Mary's Bicen­tennial Commission announced yesterday that the mock con­vention will run from March 3-6 instead of February 18-21. Mark Frieden, official spokesman for the committee, said the change was made so the four-day convention could kick off the Bicentennial celebration scheduled to begin March 7. 
Although the convention is still in 
the planning stages, Frieden said 
that all major candidates have 
been asked to appear and that 
several have made tentative 
replies. In addition, several guest 
speakers have been requested to 
appear. Guest speakers at the 1972 
convention included Democratic 
chairman Larry O'Brien and 
Allard Lowenstein, former 
congressman from New York. 
Frieden also announced that 
University President Father 
Theodore Hesburgh is tentatively 
scheduled to give the welcoming remarks and Father Griffin. university chaplain, is expected to give the invocation. 

A new feature of the 1976 con­vention is the post-convention dance which will close out event. The dance is being planned and sponsored with the aid of the Student Union and the Senior Class. "We are very happy welcome Student Government into the convention planning com­mittee," stated Frieden. "Their resources can really aid us." 
Stressing the prominence of the convention, Frieden added, "This is the timewhen Notre Dame and St. Mary's will be in the national spotlight, with Democrats paying particular attention . " Frieden urged all students to become in­volved because of the great number of positions yet to be filled. 
There will be an organizational meeting at 6:30 p.m. September 22, will be held in room 127 Nieuwland. 
A final announcement made by Frieden, was the appointment of Pat Buckley and Rick Littlefield to the planning committee and the Executive Committee.

ames of the season. Annual ontestants since 1946, the teams ave competed for a tophy known 
s the Shillelagh since 1957. The .oilermakers hold a 10-8 edge mce the Shillelagh's inception. 
There was one stretch in the mid nd late '60's when Purdue-Notre arne stood unsurpassed for 
mportance and interest. tEMEMBER: t!Hi4: Ara Parseghian's first 

,10me game as Irish coach saw ~urdue take an early lead on Bob ;riese's quarterback sneak. But ~ick Eddy leads the ground game, iohn Huarte comp_letes nine passes .nd Alan Page goes 57 yards with a -~locked punt as Ara 's Irish go on to m easy win.

t!HiG; Terry Hanratty and Jim 
Seymour's first game was also 
their best. There was no score late 
in the first quarter when Hanratty 
hit Seymour for the first of many 
completions, a 42-yarder deep into 
Boilermaker territory. On third 
down Rocky Bleier fumbled and 
Leroy Keyes scooped up the loose 
ball and streaked 94 yards for a 
touchdown. Nick Eddy streaked 
right back returning the kickoff 97 
yards to tie the game. 
With the national TV audience 
fully awake Hanratty and Seymour 
went to work. There was an 84­
yard bomb just before halftime, a 
39.yard scoring strike early in the 
fourth quarter and finally a third 
touchdown toss of just seven yards. 
Seymour finished with school 
records that still stand of 13

half despite the ND quarterback's 
33 pass attempt. The second half 
was an unparalleled aerial duel

The Irish Eye 
~=;=;~:=::::~:::=::~======:::=:=::-;:::=======*'->======->============:::::====-..:.============:::~=================Making it 
There is something special about being a quarterback at Notre Dame. 
The position has a unique quality about it, one which demands a high ·eve! of success; success which is measured not only' by statistics, but by near-mystical qualities of spirit and leadership which Notre Dame 

.. football tradition requires. The minute a player takes the field as lllarterback for the Irish, he is under pressure from all sides to ":make t". Rick Slager found out what it was all about Monday night when he took he first snap from center against Boston College. He was the successor 
o John Huarte, Terry Hanratty, Joe Theisman and Tom Clements, and hat's like trying to fit in on the 1927 Yankees. He had never started Jefore, had only 18 minutes total playing time in college, and had a 1acked stadium plus a national television audience to make his debut in ront of. 
"Everyone, me included, was really tight for the first half," Slager ,aid. "I'd never started before, I just didn't know what I could do." 
It seemed that the pressure got to him, because he didn't do much in the first half. He comp_leted only one of five passes for just three yards. He 'lad several broken plays, failed to move the offense consistently, and most important, he did not lead the team into the end zone.

Last year the Boilermakers stunned Tom Clements, Ara Parseghian and nearly 60,000 fans in the Notre Dame stadium. Saturday the Irish travel to Lafayette for a rematch. 
the 1:44 mark. An aerial born­bardment by Hanratty marched the Irish to a score three seconds before the half and the wild second quarter ended with Purdue leading 23-14. The third quarter was scoreless but Keyes' brilliant IS­yard run on the final quarter's first play sealed Notre Dame's fate. PURDUE 'Sl CB-2), NOTRE DAME 22 (7-2-1). 
t!Hi!l: Phipps made it three for three, passing for 217 yards. Wayne Bullock's brother, John, added 71 on the ground as the Boilermakers never looked back from a 21-7 halftime lead. Joe Theismann hit two TD passes but it wasn't enough. PURDUE 28 (8­2), NOTRE DAME 14 <8-1-ll. 
The 1970's have not been as kind 
to Purdue's football program. 
Starting with 1970's 48-0 rout the 
Irish ran off four straight wins 
until last year. In the '70's the 
Boilermakers overall record is 
only 22-20-1. 
Despite last year's game there is 
jnst not the &~me ring to Notre 
Dame-Purdue that there once was . 
Ofsetting any natural advantages, 
the most important thing to a 
football rivalry is two top-flight 
teams. Purdue has not been that 
for the last several years. 
To Notre Dame, their recovery period shortened by two days, Saturday's game should not be easy by any stretch of the imagination. But the Purdue that faces the Irish across theline of scrimmage is not the glamorous team it once was. Hopefully Purdue will soon have a new set of Griese's, Phipps' and Keyes', and the great Notre Dame-Purdue rivalry will flourish again.

Keyes scored on a 16-yard run with 5:04 left in the half, Keyes passed to Dillingham for a 17-yard score with 2A:57 left and following Bob Gladieux's fumble Phipps hit Dillingham on a 16-yard score at

Appeals court reduces traveling squad to 48 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ A federal appeals court struck down on Wednesday an Alabama judge's ruling that college football traveling squads may have 60 players instead of being limited to 
_ The NCAA said travel squads
48 
would be cut back to 48 players after this weekend. 
The 5th u.s. Circuit Court of Appeals order suspended a tern­porary injunction which had granted to Alabama Coach Paul 

~em e~ new "I tried to go into the game reallow-key,"he explained, "trying not to Kornman decides mstructlo~s on Thursday. 
think about it one way or the other. But at halftime I knew 'I either do it or I don't.  We had to get going." 
You could see the difference. In the first set of downs Slager completed two passes and plunged for a first down on 4th and1. The Irish were forced Ito punt, and lost the ball their next set of downs on a fumble. But lhe confidence was there in Slager, knowledged gained from one half as quarterback. He knew that not only could he play the position, but that he better play it. On the Irish's next possession he looked like he had arrived.lle completed three crisp passes in a smoothly-engineered 60 yard drive that culminated in the Irish's first score. When ND regained the ball on an interception, he set up the next score with a perfect strike to Ken MacAfee. 
"I just started doing it,"he said. "I threw a pass toBurgmeierthat I wouldn't have thrown in the first half because I would have been afraid to, I didn't know what would work." 
. When the game was over and the Irish had won their opener 17-3, Slager raisedlhis fists in the air anbd led the team into; the locker room, a huge smile beaming on his face. As he showered and dressed he fielded the countless !questions that the crowd of reporters shot at him, alarge crowd fitting for· the quarterback of Notre Dame. 
"It's something I've been thinking about since I was a kid," he said. "I felt confident, especially after the first score. I knew all we needed was a little time." 
When 1faced with the pre-season speculation I that Notre Dame did not have an established quarterback he replied: "I've heard and read all fall that we needed a quarterback. They say that every time somebody new takes over. I remember my freshman year when Tommy (Clements) was starting and they said \the same thing then." 
The locker room emptied out, 1the buses were waiting, and still the reporters huddled around iJim. He was Jsmiling, friendly, and cordial; the happiest person there. They practically had to drag him out to_ the bus, and as he left you could see the look on his face. It was only the first] game and there was Ia long season yet ahead, but he knew that someway, somehow, he had made it. 

to leave football 
Notre Dame's senior running back Russ Kornman has decided to leave football and pass up his final year of eligibility. 

"I've just decided that I really don't want to play football anymore. That's all there is to it," Russ explained. 
The 6-foot, 200 pound Kornman, a Wauwatosa, Wisconsin native, rushed for six yards in his only carry on Monday night. He was considered to be among the top Irish pass receivers when coming out of the backfield. 
Over the past three campaigns, Kornman saw limited action with the varsity, averagin more than five yards a carry with 272 yards in 56 runs over that span. Last year he picked up 99 yards in 25 carries and scored four touchdowns. 
He missed seven weeks in 1973 with a sprained ankle and missed last spring's intersquad game with a partial shoulder separation. 
Sophomore AI Hunter is ex­pected to replace Kornman at running back.

The NCAA said college squads may travel with 60 players this weekend, but that the old limit of 48 would apply after that. 
"Schools already have things in motion for this weekend," said the spokesman, Warren Brown, ad­ding that the NCAA would probabbly send let_ters to its 
schools With the

In granting the NCAA plea, the Circuit Court refused to accept the case as one of high importance and thus grant it a quick hearing, which would have cut several months off normal court procedure.
