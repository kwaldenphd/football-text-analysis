At weekend symposium 


Bishops discuss Mexican-American issues 
by Mary Pat Tarpt~y Staff Reporter 

There is presently a noticeable increase in the recognition of the Chicano population in areas other than the Southwestern portion of the United States, according to Bishop Gilbert E. Chavez, auxiliary from San Diego, California. 
In a press conference held Saturday morning, Chavez asserted, "If we were at o:ne time concentrated in the Southwest area, we are no longer confined to that specific area." In response to questions which arose from this statement, Chavez stated, "The awareness of the needs of the Chicano is growing in the Mid­west." 
The press conference began a symposium entitled, "Human Rights and Social Justice and the Church," sponsored by the Mexican-American Lecture Series which was held this past weekend in the Center for Continuing Education. 
The participants, three Mexican-

U.S. News 

leader in 
by Pat Hanifin Campus Editor 

Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh, University president, was named the nation's most influential leader in religion and third most in­fluential leader in education in a 
U.S. News and World Report questionnaire sent to 1,000 of the nation's influential mt~n and women last month and published in the current edition of the magazine. 
Hesburgh's immediate reaction, he said, was, "surprise. I made out a questionnaire--{){ course I didn't vote for myself--but I didn't expect to rank so high in the voting," he admitted. 
He played down the importance of the honor saying, "You have to take these things with a sense of humor. They come and go and are not all that important. It was just a vote of my peers." 
The vote was part of U.S. News' annual survey of American leadership. One thousand Americans who the magazine deemed influential because of their positions or activities including scholars, businessmen, labor leaders, foundation heads, educators, political office holders and others were asked to list the top five men or women they con­sidered to be the "most influential in the U.S. today." 
They were also asked to name three persons they considered most influential in their own field. Three points were given for a first place nomination, two for second and one for a third. The points were added up to give railings in twelve fields. 
In the field of religion Hesburgh outscored Billy Graham who came in at second place; Archbishop Joseph Bernardin of Cincinnati at third; Pope Paul at fourth; and Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik, professor at Yeshiva Unive~rsity at fifth. 
In education the ratings were: 
1. Clark Kerr, chairman of the 

American bishops, spoke on the history of the Chicano presence in America. Bishop Patricio 
Flores, who is presently the auxiliary of San Antonio, Texas, discussed "The Chicano and the Church." Bishop Chavez spoke on "Contemporary Social Issues Facing Chicanos" and Archbishop Robert F. Sanchez of Sante Fe, New Mexico, recently appointed Vicar General, presented "Possibilities for the Future." 
The questionning dUring the press conference dealt mainly with the Catholic Church and its relationship and involvement with the Chicano Community. In an­sweringa question pertaining to the amount of Spanish speaking Catholics, Bishop Flores observed, 
"In a recent survey it showed that 
there are fifty million Catholics 
and we are one-fourth of all the 
Catholics in the entire country." 
The major concern brought up 
during the conference was the lack 
of clergy in the Spanish com­
munity. An observer of Mexican­
American heritage complained 
there aren't enough priests and sisters in the Chicano .neighbor . hoods. In reply, Bishop Flores 
said, "We took a survey about· 
three years ago and there weren't 
even two hundred priests, Puerto 
Ricans and Cubans included. In the 
last few years a few were ordained 
but not enough." 
Chavez added, "I would estimate that there are about 1 1,000 nuns but many are oppressed. 
If nuns were liberated we'll have 
tremendous force." Flores 
commented that there ,are 
twenty-eight different com­
munities of -sisters working in 
kitchens and of those seventy 
eight, only three are not from 
Mexico which are Spanish orders. 
He complained that the Chicanos 
never see their sisters out of the 
kitchen. 

Another observer asked if there 
was any way that nuns could be 
reintroduced into the community. 
Sanchez explained, "The only way 
is to get our sisters sensitized. 
They go into the convent and don't 
come back. Now they're beginning 
to say I want to go where I belong." 
Sanchez spoke for a short period 
on the number of priests and their 
education. "We're gaining priests.

Global Action Lobby 

Hesburgh is also currently working on creating a "global action lobby," an extension on the national-level Common Cause concept to the international level. "The organization would act as a lobby before Congress, the U.N. and other groups on behalf of the needs of world justice," Hesburgh explained, "coordinating efforts towards peace, disarmament, famine control and so on." 
Fifty thousand letters were to have been sent out to prospective supporters at the end of last month but Hesburgh explained that ex­pected problems with return mail prevented this. "We had originally intended to send the letters out over my signature and ask that replies be sent to our Washington office but we realized that a lot of people would simply write to me here at the University and cause a tremendous mail overload." 
Plans now call for getting someone who has more time than Hesburgh to send out the letter and for increasing the mail-handling capacity of the group's Washington office. 
Hesburgh explained the need for 
such a group, pointing out that 
"there are now a lot of groups 
working for various projects 
connected with the issues of 
world justice but there is no 
coordination among them and no 
input to the government since most 
of them are non-profit 
organizations that cannot lobby 
without losing their tax-exempt 
status." 
The new group would be 
specifically set up as a lobby with 
headquarters in Washington and would concentrate on effecting Congressional legislation and other federal government activity in the international sphere. 
The presidential pardon program is still continuing, Hesburgh explained, despite the deadline for new applications which passed April 1. Twenty thousand requests for pardons remain to be processed, a job which will last until September. 
Although Hesburgh last month expressed concern over whether he would be able to continue in his amnesty board position because of the time it took from his other duties, he now says he --"probably will stay." The board has asked President Ford for nine new members to reduce the workload per man and Hesburgh expects that the request will be granted. 
Hesburgh defended the presidential program against detractors who feel that it is not for helping many of the men in trouble for opposing the Indochina war. 
"Ninety-five percent of all ap­plicants have gotten pardons," he

Flores noted a need for at least one national seminary for the training of Spanish-speaking people especially Mexican­Americans.Flores also felt there are a certain number of bishops in the hierarchy that recognize the need and deficiency of existing seminaries and are willing to admit it and do something about it."

chess--intellectual escape from academia 

a dangerously subversive proposal 
Of all the parlour games that became popular in the rigid social atmosphere of two generations ago, a few gained stability and are now an integral part of our more increasingly recreation-orientated society. 
By their very nature parlour games do not attract flamboyance, or even much great attention. Still, there is a bridge column in almost every American newspaper, and a chess column in many. Monopoly continues to increase upon its already incredible popularity and along with Scrabble have become so successful that one loses sight of the fact that they bear trade names. Even backgammon is onceagaina popular game, not merely a decoration on the flip side of a game board. 
The volumes and volumes that heve been written about parlour games <there is even a semi-best seller out on Monopoly strategy) are testament to the fact that they are equally part of our culture as football and baseball have become, only in a subtle manner. The game of chess, with an ever-growing number of followers, has become a dominating factor in the rise of the in­tellectual sport. 
Card games like bridge, hearts and spades, have always been renown around college campuses. "Penny-a-point Poker" is a mainstay of dorm or off-<!ampus life. But chess is different. Until onlya few years ago, it was regarded mostly as a game for intellectuals or psuedo-intellectuals. This trend has changed. 
Since the world-famous Bobby Fischer-
Boris Spassky tournament of a few years ago, the game has undergone a change in relevance and position. 
The dusty onyx chess set which for years

I'll get the name-dropping out of the way at once. Last Friday night l was with Bob Hope. We were guests of the Notre Dame Club of Chicago. Actually, Hope was the main attraction; I was sort of a token representative from thP university. 
At the taiHmd of the program they threw a few minutes at me, with one of those "And-no·w-for-a-few-words -from-Father" introductions. I can't say 1 made the best of it. But at least I resisted the temptation to take a pot-shot at super-hawk Hope, and, instead, tried to say a few things to the alumni about one of the trickiest of challenges -emancipation. 
It's tough for all of us -parents, lovers, friends -to emancipate; to respect the uniqueness of another, to let go of the 
control we seem to thirst for over each other. Some parents, for example, can't resist the tern ptation to raise their children like 
hothouse plants. They press a son or daughter into activities, studies, careers, behavior, which are more for their own gratification than the child's. Because some parents isolate a child from everyday problems, responsibilities and decisions, they ihhibit and stifle their natural curiosity and impulses to explore the world around them -they create fear of failure and other people's opinion. Such parents far from rearing well-adjusted children, are more likely to turn out indecisive, uncertain, fearful, unresourceful men and women who are easily bowled over by day-to-day oc­currences in which the rest of the world, unlike mom and dad, are not their slaves. Recently, a student stopped by and said: "I should drop out of premed. I know it, my profs know, everybody knows it. But my father told me, 'You drop out and I'll cut off your financial support. I sent you to Notre Dame because I want you to become a doctor.' " That , I submit, is an act of 
violence. 
The pressure from parents, the job 
market and the whole screwed-up notion of 
what it means to be truly successful, have 
helped to make students more grade-
conscious than I can ever remember. It 
really takes a toll. Many students get 
caught up in the competitive bag, a 
sometimes vicious dog-eat-dog battle for 
sick superiority. 
I was speaking with a young woman the 
other day, who was anguishing over the fact 
that she had just flunked an exam. Un­
fortunately, she was seeing a clear con­
nection between failing a test and being a 
failure as a person. As she talked it out, it Irealized it last night when I was correcting a appeared that she had been significantly paper he had handed in some time ago. influenced by her professor, who kept in-That really hit me. I thought back to the day sisting, "Remember, grades are the most after he was killed. I came into class; important thing of all!" A teacher like that didn't even know him enough to make the is a true menace on this campus. connection. I didn't make any comment; Frequently, their type looks at education as 1 1 didn't offer a prayer or anything. How indoctrination: rewarding students with insensitive you must have thoUJdlt I was.

A university is an excellent environment for a game <or anything else) to spread. Within a small sector of a dorm, there is likely to be one person who owns a board and peices, who will then introduce the game to a roomate or friend, who then becomes involved and a routine follows. 
Around Notre Dame, there seems to be a variety of 1chess, players, with about four different basic characteristics: 
1) Genus humanus: This type is very serious about his game (or her game but this is very rare) : knows the name of all the opening moves and all that type of stuff. He definitely entered the Observer chess tournament. 

· 2) Fecundus Primus: This person plays very well, but has never really studied the game very much; plays when he wants to tone down his mind a little to semi-active after a ling night of mental and or physical strain. Afterwards he tones down his mind to non-active by reading a dirty book or magazine or by talking to girls guys. He might have entered the Observer chess tournament. 
3) Humanus Non-Descriptus : This type does not play too well, but has interest in the game. Sometimes he plays when he is drunk. A Genus Humanus would h_ave fun watching two of these play. (Note a Fecundus Primus might have some of these characteristics.) 
grades for satisfactorily answering a series of questions, and or preparmg them to fit into present' society (without ever being concerned about improving it), equipped to achieve the ultimate -material success and "good old suburban peace." 
It's sad to see what all the forces of un­freedom do to us. We tend to forget about, or don't have time for, the beautiful possibilities for relationships and cultural experiences. As a student I would be tempted not to emancipate your from having to keep up with me and my nifty GPA; thus I don't free you for other lear­nign experiences that are truly supportive to auth~ntic human growth. Like lectures, discussion programs in dorms, a week-end retreat, personal reading, conversations with friends, a visit to the student show in the Art Galley, etc. 
The other day a student mentioned, "you 

know' lots .0~ times there are things on s a n ana-s m a 
campus mmistry that seem well worth reading. But I seldom have time. That bothers me; and I'm beginning to wonder if that doesn't say something important about my life." I had to admit to him how similarly I felt about myself. We all seem so unemancipated from various pressures that prevent us from enjoying the richness of life. I have a good friend who keeps saying, "Take your damn watch off for a day, will yo, and allow a breath of spon­taneity into your dusty, overly-regulated 
life And, sorry to report, I can't do it. I might miss an appointment or a meeting or some such epic event. 
About a month ago, a friend from town attempted a surprise birthday party for one of the Holy Cross priests. After repeated efforts to find a time when a small group of his friends could get together, she called and exclaimed: "What's with you guys, anyway? You're all so busy! Don't you believe it's important to sacrifice your fetish for work in order to take time to 
celebrate a birthday with someone you say 
you care for?" 
So, we all need to be emancipated from whatever pressures keep us back from the fullness of life God meant us to experience. I know a prof who discovered in an un­forgettable way how he · needed to be .emancipated . One of his students told me 
the story.

Rieman's tragic death earlier this year.

4) Snakus Mischevus op­ponent partner is female. A typical game goes very, very slow and possibly is never finished. Players usually are drinking (wine, maybe a vodka and lime) while they play, with mellow music in the background. 
A Snakus Mischevus usually doesn't have too much chess on his mind while he plays the game. 
There is no archetypal hero of chess, perhaps that is the reason for the diversity among Domer chess players . 
Bobby Fischer is not exactly what one calls a hero type, or even a sought-after personality. At most he reminds one of a brattish little "Poindexter" type who never really matured as well as his mind. In fact 
With a significantly smaller band and a considerably different approach to his style, Carlos Santana and the New Santana Band gave the few fans that showed up last Friday one excellent performance. Carlos demonstrably led' his five sidemen through twelve lengt'hy renditions of many of their popular but dated material. The opener was "Incident at Neshabur" and was done well but with not much enthusiasm,as Carlos joked · with stage hands, simply waiting for his moments to punctuate the all too familiar rhythms, The small crowd, approximated at 4500, none-fhe-less soon realized the apparent change in Carlos' approach and lept to their feet in applause. 
Carlos continued to smash them over the heads, playing such oldies as "Black Magic 
Woman," . "Gypsy Queen," and "Oya Coma Va." All were executed with very little variation from their original form, but were further embellished by Carlos San­tana's much wider knowledge of the electric 1 guitar, and by Tom Coster's thick layering I and Moog synthesizing. The other mem­bers, Armando Peraza (congas), Leon ! Patillo<vocals), Ndugu (percussion), and ! Dave Brown (bass) also added their own

fresh interpretations to these rock "an­tiques." 1 
As the crowd tired from their passionate appreciation of these "rockers" they relaxed a bit, and it was then that Carlos let loose with the newer material. However, he carefully avoided the problems and mistakes he had had her~ two years ago and therefore played only those new tunes which equalled, or surpassed, the old stuff in acrylic bliss. The first of these was "Mirage"; the weakest from Santana's

Still, the games , survives, and survives very well. No longer is it a-game for old men to play in the park <like it's much simplercounterpart checkers). 
Two college students lying on the lawn playing a game of chess would have been stereotyped as worms having crawled out from their books. But not today. The average student is no longer either a fock or intellectual, but rather a mingling of the two. Except for the Snakus Mischevus who is distinct. He is, indeed, checkmated.

After a couple more from Borboletta, "One with the Sun" and "Give and Take," Carlos went back again to the basics and killed the duds with a very mellow "Samba Pa ti". Hanging  onto -notes like they were infinite by design, Carlos had finally slowed the pede down and was at last "getting into" the concert himself.
