Malloy, pope to meet later this month 
By MATT GALLAGHER News Staff 
University President Father Edward "Monk" Malloy will meet with Pope John Paul II Sept. 12, 1987, in New Orleans to discuss Catholic higher edu­cation. 
The meeting, at Xavier Uni­versity, will highlight the Pope's stay in New Orleans, part of his visit to the southern United States next week. Pope John Paul will meet with rep­resentatives of all of the Cath­olic colleges and universities of the United States. 
"Each city (on the Pope's tripJ is highlighting a different aspect of Catholic life,'' Malloy said. "New Orleans has two themes: one is the Black Cath­olic experience, and the other is Catholic education." 
Along with Malloy, the Notre Dame delegation will include Rev. David Tyson, vice­president for student affairs; Dr. Robert Gordon, vice­president for advanced studies; James Murphy, asso­ciate vice-president for Univer­sity relations, and Ann Firth, director of residence life. They will be presenting the Pope with a folio describing educa­tion at Notre Dame, Malloy said. 
The morning session of the meeting, organized by the Na­tional Catholic Educational As­sociation, will stress primary and secondary education in America. The evening session will present American higher education. The Pope will view a short video presentation, hear several brief addresses, and be presented with written statements from each school, according to Malloy. 
Malloy, who has had the op­portunity to see Pope John Paul II before in Rome, expressed his excitement at the possibil­
ity of representing Notre Dame at this program. 
"I think," Malloy stated, "if you look at Catholic higher edu­cation, the vast bulk of institu­tions in the world exist in the United States ... and we think that's what we're celebrating, and this will be our opportunity to do it." 


Death of priest ruled a suicide 
By CHRIS BEDNARSKI News Editor 

The death of a priest who taught theology at Notre Dame was ruled a suicide late Mon­day night by Deputy County Coroner James McMeel. 
Father Niels Rasmussen, 53, was found dead in the base­ment of his home at 602 West Parkovash St. Monday around 4 p.m., said Lieut. Rick Kil­gore, public information offi­cer for the South Bend Police. 
An associate professor of the­ology, Rasmussen died of a single, self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest, McMeel said. 
McMeel estimated the time of death as sometime Saturday afternoon. 
Investigators still do not know why Rasmussen killed himself, Kilgore said. 
The body was found by an­other professor of theology, who had gone to the house after Rasmussen had failed to attend the formal opening of school mass Sunday morning or his Monday classes, Kilgore said. 
After finding the door locked, the other professor obtained a key to the house from a neigh­bor, entered the house, and found Rasmussen's body in the basement, said Kilgore. 
Rasmussen, a member of the Notre Dame faculty since 1979, left a note in a sealed envelope addressed to a friend, McMeel said. The note asked that Ras­mussen's body be cremated "in the event anything happened to him," McMeel said. 
Police, however, are not treating this as a suicide note, he added. 
University President Father Edward Malloy will celebrate a memorial Mass for Rasmus­sen Friday at 10 a.m. in Sacred Heart Church. 
A prayer service will be held for Rasmussen at 4: 15 today in the Library Auditorium Lounge. 
Rasmussen, a native of Den­mark, was ordained a Dominican priest by the bishop of Copenhagen in 1963. He received his doctorate in theol­ogy from the Institut Cataholique de Paris in 1978, traveling to Catholic Univer­sity in Washington D.C. the fol­lowing year, where he taught for a year before coming to Notre Dame as an assistant professor. 
In 1983, Rasmussen, an ex­pert in Latin liturgies, became an associate professor. 

lraquis claim more hits as gulf war continues 
Associated Press 
MANAMA, Bahrain Rockets filred by an Iranian speedboat started a fire on a Spanish supertanker Tues­day, and Iraq said its planes hit four ships and Iranian in­dustrial targets. Iran claimed it shot down three raiding aircraft. 
A convoy of U.S. Navy warships and two reflagged Kuwaiti tankers arrived !)afely in the emirate's 'waters. Kuwait and Iraq, which has been at war with Iran since September 1980, are neighbors at the head of the Persian Gulf. 
The ships started up the gulf Saturday, the day after raids were renewed in the waterway after a six-week lull. The only incident re­ported during the 550-mile trip was the rescue of a downed Iraqi pilot. 
Iraq reported air raids Tuesday on four ships in the gulf and five industrial and oil target~. in its air war on Iran's economy. 
Iran reported retaliatory 
raids on military and indus­
trial targets in Iraq. 
In Washington, the State Department said the U.N. Security Council should draft sanctions unless Iran agrees to a cease-fire by the end of the week. 
Soviet officials urged that diplomacy be given more time. 
''Soviet-American cooperation is not only pos­sible, it is necessary these days," said Vladimir Petrovsky, a deputy foreign minister. 
Dispatches from Iran's news agency quoted Prime Minister Hussein Musavi as saying Iran would make its position clear soon on the Se­curity Council truce resolu­tion of July 20. Iraq has agreed to observe the resolu­tion if Iran does. 
Radio monitors said the 300,078-ton Spanish super­tanker Munguia sent a distress signal when at­tacked by one or two Iranian speedboats 55 miles north­east of Bahrain, an island emirate in the central gulf. 
Later reports said at least 
two shoulder-fired rockets 
hit the ship, causing no 
casualties among the 37 
crew members but starting 
a fire in the engine room. 
Crewmen put out the fire, and the tanker continued down the gulf loaded with 2.1 million barrels of Saudi crude oil, according to the radio reports and Spanish of­ficials. 
It was the second report in two days of an attack on a ship by Iranian speedboats in apparent retaliation for Iraq's renewed air raids. 
Gunfire from a speedboat raked a Kuwaiti container ship early Monday off the United Arab Emirates in the southern Gulf. No casualties were reported. 
The convoy's arrival at Kuwait was reported by sources close to the Kuwait Oil Tanker Co., owners ofthe 81,283-ton Surf City and 79,999-ton Chesapeake City. They are among 11 tankers given U.S. registration so the Navy can protect them.

In Brief 
The garbage barge is finally being emptied. The burning of the nation's best-known trash began today after one-ton bales from the garbage barge Mobro were broken apart and inspected by workers in masks and white suits. Environmental inspectors from the city and state probed the garbage with tiny rakes but found little more than paper, cardboard, wood and typical commercial garbage. The barge left New York March 22 with commercial waste from New York City and neighboring Nassau County:,pn Long Island. It toured six states and three countries before finally returning to New York at the beginning of the sum­mer and remained on the barge while local officials argued over what to do with the waste. -Associated Press 
A tree lover with a history of arrests and mental problems shot a man trimming hedges in a neighbor's yard Tuesday, and held police at bay for nine hours before being apprehended. Police threw percussion grenades and tear gas into the home of the alleged gunman, John Rohm, 41, and then entered the house, arresting Rohm without incident. Police said Rohm was a former teacher in the Indianapolis Catholic schools. The incident began when Rohm allegedly opened fire with a shotgun at Walter Kil­gore, 55, who was trimming the hedges. Police said Rohm's yard was not well tended and he may have become an­noyed by the yard work next door. -Associated Press 
Highway shootings along a 17-mile stretch of Interstate 65 near Indianapolis have police stymied. But unlike similar shootings on California freeways, no Hoosiers have been injured. Police said media coverage of the California freeway shootings may have prompted the Indiana incidents, and each of the suspects arrested in the Indiana shootings has mentioned the California cases. Another theory is that the rest stops along that stretch of the interstate have been notorious hangouts for prostitutes and other criminal elements. The !~test r~­ported shooting occurred Sunday, when an Indtanapohs man allegedly leaned out the passenger door and aimed a shotgun at the car behind him.No shots were fired in the incident. -Associated Press

The Emerald City of Oz: a real awakening 


"Oh dear God, another day of differential equations and behavior management. .." 
And so I stumbled out of bed (fell, actually ­it's a loft) and dragged myself·out the door to face another day of insane classes, no alcohol, and not enough women. Sigh. 
But as I walked across North Quad out to the used garage they call the Aero Building, the Stonehenge fountain just went berserk. The water just kept spouting higher and higher, sucking me, Cavanaugh, and most of the campus with it. I floated as if I were flying. I saw Father Miceli riding by on a bicycle. "Fat­her Miceli! Father Miceli!" I screamed. But to no avail. · 
I woke up in a very strange place. All these little people were dancing, cavorting, and doing somersaults around me, singing "It's dead! It's dead!" I saw the remains of Stonehenge lying atop the remains of a brown brick building, with strange vapors and slimes oozing out. "It's dead! It's dead! The dining hall is dead!" 
And then I saw the sign, and a surge of joy transfigured my heart: OZ STATE Hook 'em Munchkins 
It was too good to be true. I was at a real university, with real parties and real women and no $300 book bills. 
The Good Fairy Dean showed up about then, and set my feet on the Golden Road to Oblivion with a wave of her Scheduling Wand. "Here's your schedule," she whispered into my ear. I looked at the schedule. "Basketweaving 101, 6 credits. Appreciation of American Humor, 3 credits. Laundry, 3 credits~ Calculus 6, 3 credits." 
"But wait, there's some mistake," I replied. "I've already taken Calculus 6." 
"Goodness me," the Dean exclaimed, " that was supposed to be Sunbathing 1. I forgot you were in our Advanced Studies program." 
And so I wandered out onto the Yellow Brick 
Frat Road, where the beer flowed in such abun­
dance that the road was stained with a brilliant 
golden hue. As I wandered down the road, 
hundreds of scantily-clad college students wan­
dered about in various states of inebriation. 
"Oops! Haven't we met somewhere before?" 
mumbled a gorgeous redhead as she staggered 
into my shoulder. "Hi! I'm Dorothy." What a 
line. What a body! "I could get used to this," 
I thought as I sampled the brew pooled by the 
side of the road, beautiful woman in hand, with 
no classes to worry about since there were ap­
parently no classrooms. 
We ran into some.dude covered with straw a 
few blocks down. "Want some weed?" he asked 
before passing out in a nearby ditch. Wow, I 
had never seen someone that comatose before. 
As we staggered along the road (I had par­
taken quite heavily of the beer by this time, 
and Dorothy kept nibbling my ear) we saw an­
other strange character. He looked like Will 
Robinson's robot friend from "Lost in Space," 
except this guy had a real face. Anyway, he 
was running towards us screaming "Look out 
for the flying monkeys!" when three frat rats 
grabbed him and stuck a tap down his throat. 
Then we went into this forest, with lots of 
dark corners kinda like the other side of St. 
Mark Mclaughlin 
Projects Manager 
Mary's Lake after parietals. Well, that's what Dorothy had on her mind, at any rate, though I was in no mood for it after the third time she forgot my name. All of a sudden, this hairy beast staggered out from behind a tree. 
"Do you know the cube root of pi?" it whined. 
Dorothy seemed annoyed at the interruption, though I was rather thankful for the chance to foist her off on the unsuspecting coward. But lo and behold, all these flying monkeys des­cended upon us. "That's what I get for drinking Old Mil," was my only thought as all three of us were carried off to a huge green building. 
"WHAT ARE YOUR QUALIFICATIONS?" boomed the face on the large video unit placed in front of us. "Oh no," I thought, "a job inter­view." 
"I speak three languages, can design nuclear reactors, and I'm eager to work for your com­pany!" said the coward, with this really gross smile. 
"WILL $50,000 BE ENOUGH TO START?" the nameless entity exclaimed, obviously pleased. 
"Of course," said the coward. It apparently was enough for Dorothy, too, judging by the speed with which she disengaged herself from my arm and followed the rich little snot out the door. 
"AND YOU?" shouted the face on the video, looking suspiciously like Max Headroom. 
By this time I was tired of the whole Oz State thing. No intelligent conversation, no Stonehenge, no real classes, and certainly no job. Since all this was looking rather familiar, I figured the obvious way out was worth a shot. And so I clicked my Nikes together and said ... 
"There's no place like Dome. There's no place like Dome. There's no place like Dome." 
Polyrazzmatazz! Back I was at Notre Dame, lying out on North Quad in the pouring rain, ten minutes late for class and hungover like a corpse. Some hallucination. 
Thank God for differential equations.

H PC decides on fund allocation 
By NATASHA WILSON 
News Staff 
The Hall Presidents' Council voted on the distribution of hall activity funds at its first meeting of the school year Tuesday night at Grace Hall. 
Under the approved plan, the $12,000 allocated by the Office of Student Activities will be dis­tributed equally among the dorms. 
Each dorm will get $500, the same amount each received last year. The money can only be used for non-alcoholic events and is not intended for off-campus students. 
By approving the $500 plan, the HPC turned down two other proposals to distribute the funds according to the popula­tion of each dorm. 
One proposition called for the equal division of the funds in proportion to the number of stu­dents in each dorm (less than $2 per resident>. The other set a flat fee per dorm (approximately $200-$250) and an equal portion ($1) per dorm. student. 
The presidents of the small dorms repeatedly voiced con­cern over these methods, con­
tending  the  proposals dis­ 
criminated  against  their  
dorms.  

"For the past three years we 
have relied on the flat rate for SYRs, study breaks and other weekly activities for our dorm," said Jeff Dorschner, president of St. Edward's Hall. "If we had less, we would be able to have only a few social events each month." 
Jamie Froman, head of Car­roll, agreed, "smaller dorms need a little help." 
However, Terry Lally of Dil­lon argued that "for larger dorms $500 barely covers a cookout." 
Halfway through the coun­cil's debate on the allocation, HPC co-chairman Bob Daley requested the group "remem­ber that the money is going 
toward  the  whole  student  
body."  
After  some  discussion,  the  

council voted and agreed to fol­low the precedent of $500 per dorm. 
In addition to this income, the residence halls utilize internal revenue gained from student fees to host picnics and various hall parties. Each dorm, however, charges a different amount, according to its own needs, the HPC members said. 
In other business, the HPC unanimously approved the Stu­dent Activities Board's deci­sion to change its name to the Student Union Board.

good-faith bids the first time around, and those who were too low were probably not inter­ested to begin with." 
Officials of St. Joseph Bank said they would like the branch in LaFortune be profitable within the first year to year and a half of operating on campus, according to Bart Nagy, assis­tant vice president of St. Joseph Bank. 
The branch has already opened 1,000 new student ac­counts, and several Notre Dame halls have opened busi­ness accounts with the bank. 
The main reason the Univer­sity allowed the bank in LaFor­tune was for the convenience that it offers the students and faculty at Notre Dame, the Uni­versity said. 
Until the addition of the St. Joseph branch, the only other financial institution located on campus was the Notre Dame Credit Union located on Douglas Rd. The Notre Dame Credit Union was created in 1941 to serve the Notre Dame Community, according to Ruth Kelly, president and chair­woman of the board. The Notre Dame Credit Union is in no way connected with the University. But, Kelly said she "was disappointed we were not selected (for the Lafortune space) since we have served the University for 47 years." 
In 1983 the Notre Dame Credit Union installed auto­matic teller machines on campus at a cost of nearly one­half million dollars. According 

to Kelly, in 1982 a verbal agree­ment was made with Father Joyce and Brother Kieran Ryan that only Notre Dame Credit Union automatic teller Mac­hines would be allowed on campus. Lyphout said he did not know of such an agreement ever being made. 
Notre Dame Credit Union, however, has had no drop-off in business because of the St. Joseph's Branch opening, ac­cording to Kelly. They have lost only about 20 accounts and have opened about 1,000 fresh­man accounts. Kelly said no new tactics are planned to com­bat the competition. "We are going along as always and mar­keting a little more." 
The new bank's regular hours are Monday thru Friday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.

Police clash with student!:; as 
re-op~en 
Successive governments have cooperated with business since South Korea's "economic miracle" began nearly two decades ago, virtually banning strikes and keeping wages low. 
The leadership meeting Wed­nesday was the first between Roh Tae-woo, chief of the gov­ernment Democratic Justice Party, and Kim Young-sam, of the main oppos:ttion Reunifica­tion Democratic Party, since Chun made his concessions. 
They had planned the meeting for Monday, but Kim postponed it, demanding prog­ress on demands for release of all political prisoners still in detention. Opposition party of­ficials said discussions were held on the issue. 
More than 10,000 Seoul taxi drivers struck on Tuesday. City officials said the action in­volved 26 percent of the capi­tal's drivers, and disruption was minimal since most people use buses or the subway. 
Labor leade1·s at Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. in the southern port of Ulsan, the country's largest shipbuilding yard, ordered a slowdown by the 24,000 workers after wage negotiations. 


Korean universities 
Associated Press 
SEOUL, South Korea Universities reopened for the fall term Tuesday and imme­diately became battlegrounds for police and anti-government students. One campus fight with rocks, firebombs and tear gas lasted three hours. 
As students demanded the ouster of President Chun Doo­hwan, leaders of the govern­ment party and the opposition worked on a timetable for a presidential election and peaceful transition when Chun's term ends in February. 
Labor unrest that began in July continued to cripple the export-based economy, and hundreds of strikes for higher pay were in progress Tuesday. Prime Minister Kim Chung-yul said workers had been short­changed in South Korea's eco­nomic boom, and the govern­ment would seek greater benefits for them. 
South Korea's trade surplus in August was only one-quarter of the total for August 1986, the government reported. 
Fighting between protesters and riot squads began on the huge Seoul National University campus after a rally by 4,000 students. Police fired tear gas and charged behind shields during the three-hour battle. 
Students hurled stones and threw firebombs that exploded in orange showers of blazing gasoline, shouting "Let's finish the military dictatorship!'' and "Down with the murder regime!'' 
The South Korean news agency Yonhap said about 10,000 students in all demon­strated at 19 other schools across the country. It did not say whether those protests were violent. 
Radical student leaders have vowed to topple Chun's govern­ment, and the size of the Seoul National University rally indi­cated strong support. 
Students traditionally are in the vanguard of protest in South Korea. They led weeks of demonstrations that caused Chun to agree June 30 to oppo­sition demands for direct presidential elections and other democratic reforms. 
Another change promised was less government control of unions. Within days, workers in transport, mining and the major export industries began striking for higher pay, better working conditions and free unions.

SoviE!ts seek Pershing removal 
Associated Pre:;;s withdrawing 72 Pershing 1-A warheads from West Germany. 
WASHINGTON, D.C.-The So-But U.S. officials said the viet Union on Tuesday called warheads were not subject to on the United States to clear negotiations with the Soviets away the "last obstacles" to an because the missiles that carry agreement banning medium-them belong to the West Ger­range nuclear missiles by mans. 

The orgnnizatio~ ~~n~~his p(~. 
"We have said consistently that third-country systems are not part of the negotiations," White House spokesman Mar­lin Fitzwater said in Santa Bar­bara, Calif., near President Reagan's ranch. "We stand by that position." 
A State Department official, who demanded anonymity, said the warheads would be withdrawn from West Ger­many only after the missiles were dismantled. 
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl offered last Wed­nesday to scrap the Pershing 1-A missiles, which have a range of 465 miles, after a U.S.­Soviet treaty is ratified and put into effect. 
Both the United States and the Soviet Union welcomed the offer as a step forward. But it is not clear whether Kohl's schedule was acceptable to Moscow or posed a problem in completing the treaty. 
At a news conference here Tuesday, a Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, Vladimir F. Petrovsky, insisted on removal of the warheads, which are un­der U.S. control. 
"If the United States would agree to remove the 72 nuclear warheads, the last obstacles to the double-zero option would be removed," Petrovsky said. 
The Soviet official referred to the dismantling of two categories of intermediate­range missiles in what would be Reagan's first nuclear arms-control agreement with Moscow. 
In all, 332 U.S. missiles would be withdrawn from West Ger­many, Britain, Italy and Bel­gium while the Soviets scrapped 442 rockets aimed at Western Europe and an addi­tional 121 missiles targeted on China and Japan.

States VIe for atom-smasher 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Flush with optimism, state officials on Tuesday rushed in their proposals to the federal gov­ernment to landlhe "super col­
r lider," a $4.4 billion atom smas­
r 
r. her that will mean 3,000 jobs 
r for the winner. To hear them talk, all the 25 competitors were bound to win. Some states made a big pro­duction out of it, either in Wash­ington or at home. Others said little and kept details secret un­til after the 2 p.m. Wednesday deadline for getting proposals to the Energy Department. A dozen Texas officials held the first news conference of the day's several at the depart­ment and elsewhere after delivering 60 cardboard car­tons of documents in a station wagon and a rented van. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, gave one reason for secrecy -­keeping competitors from matching an attractive induce­ment. His state plans a $200 million joint venture with utilities to supply electricity at an un­
matchable 1 cent per kilowatt­hour or less, he said. "It's too late" for other states to beat that, he said, although several are stressing their low power costs. 
Congress banned considera­tion of direct financial incen­tives to prevent states from getting into a bidding war, but did permit states to contribute to site improvements with roads, sewers and other work. States that want to offer more were asked to submit details in a sealed envelope to be opened onJy if they won, and several were doing so. 
For Texas, site improve­ments could add up to $700 mil­lion, Gramm said. 
Texas officials' optimism was echoed by their competi­tors from one end of the country to the other : 
-New York Lt. Gov. Stanley Lundine told reporters in New York his state's three sites were "technically sound, finan­cially superior and politically attractive."

Bagel-eater busted 
Associated Press 

HARTFORD, Conn. -A federal inmate was removed from a halfway house and returned to prison to complete his sentence, all because he ate a poppy seed bagel. 
It seems Anthony Clarizio's gastronomic gaffe violated a new U.S. Bureau of Prison policy written because the seeds alter drug test results. 
Medical experts say the ef­fect of poppy seeds on urinalysis tests is well known, and legal experts say the gov­ernment has a right to test in­mates for drugs, but some civil libertarians argue the policy is arbitrary and unfair. 
Public Defender Richard Reeve said Clarizio, who lives in Stratford, was released to a Hartford halfway house about four months ago to complete his sentence for loan-sharking and extortion. Clarizio, who pleaded guilty to the charges two years ago, is scheduled to be released Oct. 1. 
Reeve said Clarizio and a friend ate bagels taken to the friend's house in Stratford by a neighbor Aug. 9. The bagel contained poppy seeds, accor­ding to the manufacturer. 
When Clarizio returned to the halfway house and routinely gave a urine sample, he told house officials there could be a problem because he may have eaten some poppy seeds, Reeve said Tuesday. 
Nevertheless, Clarizio, who is in his 50s, was sent back to federal prison in Danbury on Aug. 24, five days after failing a urine test, to complete his sentence. 
"I think it's an absurd rule, and it smacks of the grave dangers of falsely imprisoning somebody," William Olds, ex­ecutive director of the Connec­ticut Civil Liberties Union, said Tuesday. "It's not always pos­sible for somebody to know they were eating poppy seeds." 
Pyung Yoon, of Yale Univer­sity medical school's depart­ment of toxicology, said urine tests cannot distinguish be­tween exposure to poppy seeds and exposure to heroin or other illegal drugs made from the poppy plant. 
"Generally, drug test policies take that into account and ask a person whether they've eaten something of that nature," said Allan Adler, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington, D.C. "If so, then the drug test is put off until that's out of the person's sys­tem. It (Bureau of Prisons policy) seems to be manifestly unfair." 
But Robert Hassen, spokes­man for the Danbury prison, said all prisoners allowed to complete their terms in halfway houses sign a state­ment promising not to consume poppy seeds. 
"He's got to go over it with his correctional counselor," Hassen said. "I would find it hard to believe that anyone would not read his furlough release."

Board discusses safety, library hours 
By CHRISTINE MC CANN 
News Staff 
The Saint Mary's Board of Governance discussed campus safety and library hours at its first meeting of the year Tues­day evening. 
Because of the recent in­crease in crime affecting the Saint Mary's-Notre Dame com­munity, Vice President Smith Hashagen said the Board might form a special committee. It would "launch a publicity cam­paign to encourage awareness of personal responsibility,'' she said. 
President Eileen Hetterich asked all students to ''please keep a watchful eye out on campus, even for those you might not know."

Jeviish leaders discuss Walldheim visit with Pope 
Associated Press 
CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy -Jewish leaders on Tuesday told Pope John Paul II of their anger over his audience with Kurt Waldheim, and the Vatican said it would issue a major document on anti-Semitism and the Holocaust. 
The Jewish representatives termed their historic meeting with the Pope a success, al­though the pontiff did not di­rectly respond to their anger over his June 25 audience with the Austrian president, alleged to have been involved with deporting Jews during World War II. 
The Pope also did not respond to the Jews' questions on the Vatican's lack of

A student board will be formed in order to meet with the library administration so that a written proposal might be discussed, Hetterich added. 
Further business included the granting of official club status to the Baptist Student Union; the suggestion that Saint Mary's might make a special attempt to help com­memorate .the celebration of the Marion Year; and a listing of new Board of Governance of­fice hours, which are:

diplomatic relations with Is­rael. 
The Waldheim issue was taken up in detail in talks be­tween the Jewish delegation and Vatican officials in the past two days. 
"This encounter was a his­toric one in a very positive way," said Henry Siegman of the American Jewish Congress. "It was the first time the head of the Roman Catholic church engaged in genuine conversa­tions with representatives of the Jewish community." 
Rabbi Mordecai Waxman, chairman of the International Jewish Committee for Inter­religious Consultations, said after the papal audience that the relationship between Jews and the Vatlean was raised "to a new plateau:" 
A joint communique said the Vatican delegation in the meetings Monday and Tuesday defended the audience with Waldheim but acknowledged that the church understood

Reflections abound for all to consider 
You are awakened by the chirping of the birds and the gentle sunlight shining through your window which warms your face. You keep your eyes closed while trying to remember what you are going to do today. Was I going to the beach, or was it the tennis court? Oh, well, you think, as long as it's summer, I don't care. Suddenly, your thoughts of a lazy summer day are rudely shat­tered by the blare of your alarm clock. You open your eyes, realize you are in your dorm room at Notre Dame and must hurry to the dining hall to get the last of the semi-hot food before shuf­fling off to class.

Since my brain is still in the summer mode and can't really handle a coherent, linear (even that word gives me pain) article, I think I'm just gonna throw out some random thoughts left over from the summer. That way, you don't have to use precious brain waves to follow one of my usual articles. 
ODDS AND SODS. The women's· movement took a giant step backward this summer with the performances of Donna Rice, Fawn Hall, Jessica Hahn and Tammy Faye Bakker. Of course, with Ollie and the boys, Uncle Ronnie Reagan, Mssrs. Bakker and Swaggert and Sean Penn, the men didn't do too well, either.

ROLL. Michael Jackson's back. Hip, Hip, ah, forget it. Top five songs this summer (in no particular order): "Just Like Heaven" by the Cure, "Alex Chil­ton" by The Replacements, "La Bamba" by Los Lobos (but the original is still better), "Isn't it Midnight" by Fleetwood Mac, "4th of July" by X. Hey, if Casey Casem can do it. ..New ND fight song, "I Want Your Sex" by George Michael. No thanks, George...Summer of Love II: Sgt. Pepper's on CD, The Dead in the top forty and touring again and Starship (Jefferson Airplane, maybe?) with a number one hit. Well, two out of three ain't bad...How could Rolling Stone list the top one-hundred albums of the last twenty years and not include Elton John's "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"? U2's "War"? The Smith's "The Smiths"? Inexcusable.. They did, however, have enough sense to include three Velvet Underground albums.

P.O. Box Q 
Constitution does allow for change 
Dear Editor: 

In response to Kevin Smant's "Congress should heed its limits, " I feel that the problems posed should be looked at from a non-partisan stand­point (though the article was clearly written from a conservative vantage point). 
Since Mr. Smant's field of study is history, he should realize that our Con­stitution was written as a flexible docu­ment, therefore there are provisions in it for change. If the executive branch's "hands are tied" by a constitutional law, the executive branch can (legally) attempt to change that law through amendment and thus free its hands. On the other hand if the administration chooses to disregard the law altogether, then should we just overlook this and say it was in the country's best interest or should we question the judgement of the people in charge? If we choose to ignore this infraction of the rules, shouldn't we then ignore the Constitu­tion altogether as a meaningless docu­ment since its laws do not apply to the executive branch of our government? 
My second point is that the Congress is an elected body just as the president is an elected offical, therefore they are both obligated to carry out the will of 
the people. So who has the correct 

Garry Trudeau 
States are sympathetic with the con­tras, which may have been true directly after Oliver North's testimony, but has since then dropped off. 
Lastly, I would like to point out that there have been numerous reports that the people of Nicaragua do not even want the contras to "free them." While the Sandinistas have been trying to build up the country with numerous so­cial programs, the contras are content to bomb villages and harm the civilian population whom they are attempting to "free." 
The truth is the United States gov­ernment (at least the executive branch) is supporting the Contras merely because they are anti­communist even though they violate more civil rights than their "oppres­sors" do. If the contras could show that they had the support of the Nicaraguan people, I would advocate funding to the contras but as it stands now I support the elected government of Nicaragua. 
The true question is should we allow our elected officials to break the laws of our country. If we do, we may end up like the Soviets-the posessors of an ignored constitution. We could end up like the very people from which we are trying to protect ourselves.

I think that one of the under­pinnings of democracy is that you can't have any critical par­
tlcipatlon from citizens if you don't have any kind of critical education. Strategy is part of our politics. That means that, on campuses across the country, we need to be able to make these problems clear to people. 
There has been a lot of talk recently about how apathetic this generation of s.tudents Is. From your experiences, would you say that apathy Is a serious problem? 
I think that there· is a lot of truth to this Idea of apathy and we mention It as a problem, but its really an inadequate tag for labelling a huge amount of people. It means different things in different places; it means numbness to certain problems; It means economic concerns for young adults com­lng out of colleges; It means facing a job market with far fewer possibilities. 
These can all be translated Into terms of "apathy" If you define them that way, but the challenge is to connect with a very live interest in these is­sues. It doesn't take long to find out that everyone shares a concern with the fact that there is something really wrong with some of the military ap­proaches to dealing with con­filets. Apathy is a symptom, not a general condition. 
What is your Impression of Notre Dame relative to peace Issues? 
Notre Dame has one the best programs beginning in peace studies right now. It also has a large military presence on campus with the ROTC. Tradi­tionally both have been looked at as antagonisfk parties, but they also have, if you look at the basic problems, a great common interest. 
You don't think that It Is Impossible for someone to be In the military and a peace­maker simultaneously? 
No, I think that most of the Individuals Involved In the military, on every level, includ­ing students, are genuinely concerned with peace. Whenever we discuss how to create a common defense, the people who have done most of the training have been In the military. In order to know how any kind of peace endeavor should train Itself, we need to be aware of what has histori­cally been our only system of defense. 
You seem to share a tradl· tional Interest ln national security. 
Very often in providing for traditional thoughts of security, we forget those things which we wish to secure in the first place. For example, If our borders are extremely secure in the military sense and, yet, there are hungry people on our streets, we have to ask is that security common throughout the society? There Is no reason to think that the Issues of poverty, homelessness and environmental decay as sepa­rate Issues from national secur­lty.

Hatcher, bat ejected in loss 
Associated Press 

HOUSTON -Andre Dawson and Shawon Dunston each hit RBI doubles as the Chicago Cubs beat the Houston Astros 3-2 Tuesday night in a game that featured the ejection of Houston's leading hitter, Billy Hatcher, for using an illegal bat. 
With Gerald Young on first and no one out in the fourth, Hatcher broke his bat when he beat out an infield hit to Dunston at short. The barrel of the bat was split into two parts. Home plate umpire Dana DeMuth recovered the rem­nants of the bat and after they were examined by crew chief John McSherry and Houston Manager Hal Lanier, Hatcher was called out and ejected.

a Notre Dame single-season record with seven fumble recoveries in 1986 and will start at the outside position again this season despite some early questions concerning his aca­demic eligibility. 
Figaro is indeed eligible, out­side linebacker coach Barry Alvarez said Monday, and that could mean a few more big plays from the defense this year. 
But the bad dream isn't over yet. 
Consider Darrell "Flash" Gordon at the eagle-backer po­sition -a spot from which the 6-3, 210-pound senior will be chasing many a signal-caller. And they don't call him "Flash" for nothing. 
"I like to think the name reflects my style of play on the field," Gordon says. 
Covering the short passes and plugging holes at the inside slots will be junior Ned Bolcar and senior W es Pritchett -both of whom have carried their share of playing time in the past and have been impressive this fall. 
Sophomore Mike Stonebreaker, who figured to play a key role at inside 
linebacker, is still sitting out for academic reasons. Stonebreaker has not practiced this fall. 
"The loss of (Stonebreaker) hurts," Fazio said. "But Bolcar and Pritchett are steady, reli­able players. We would have had a rough time picking the two starters from those three young men. 
Sophomore John Foley, who sat out last year under Proposi­tion 48, should see a good deal of playing time behind Bolcar and Pritchett. 
And the bench is even deeper at the outside position for the Irish. 
"We have four people who could legitimately start (on the outside)," Alvarez said. 
Former fullback Frank 
Starns, who never has run a 
pla_y on the Irish defense, looks 
sohd at eagle-backer behind 
Gordon. Sophomore Rod West 
has emerged as the second 
string outside linebacker be­
hind Figaro. 

"With the talent out there I think they should be involv~d in a lot of big plays," Alvarez said. "Turnovers, sacks and things like that. So far they've been doing that. 
"The first week Frank Starns and Figs (Figaro) had good scrimmages. This last week Flash Gordon and Ned Bolcar had good scrimmages. As long as somebody's doing it, they'll keep me happy." 
And as long as the entire unit continues doing what it has done this fall, those quarter­back nightmares are bound to continue.

ND nabs OT win in soccer opener 
Special to the Observer 
Freshman Steve LaVigne scored the winning goal in overtime to give the Irish soccer team a season­opening 2-1 victory over Loyola (Ill.). 
LaVigne's goal came at the 97: 18 mark on a header off a corner kick by junior forward Randy Morris. Mor­ris also scored the game's first goal at 22: 15 off a pass from junior forward Bruce "Tiger" McCourt. 
Rich Drab tied the game for the Ramblers at 51:06 on an unassisted goal. 
Sophomore Danny Lyons went the distance in goal for Notre Dame, recording 8 saves. The Irish dominated play for most of the contest, as they had eight more cor­ners than the Ramblers. Notre Dame also outshot Loyola, 13-9. 
The losing coach was Ray O'Connell, a Notre Dame alumnus. It was also Notre Dame's first victory in eight tries over Loyola. In the last meeting three years ago Notre Dame and Loyola tied, 0-0. 
The Irish next open their home schedule this Friday with the first night contest at Krause Stadium. Notre Dame hosts Drake in that contest.

"We have no Madison Ave­nue campaign to get the name of Tim Brown out to people," says John Heisler, Associate Director of Notre Dame's Sports Information Depart­ment. "Our football program is visible enough so that the sta­tistics take care of themselves. We make people aware of those statistics. 
"Tim has got all this atten­tion because of what he did last season, it's really nothing we've done. With our television exposure a lot of people are going to see him play. Nobody creates that, it's just a built-in advantage that exists here at Notre Dame."

MINNEAPOLIS -Jeff Sellers pitched a four-hitter and Wade Boggs and Mike Greenwell homered Tuesday night as the Boston Red Sox beat the Min­nesota Twins 7-0. 
Minnesota's Kirby Puckett singled in his first at-bat for his seventh straight hit, but wound up 2-for-4 and one short of the major-league record of 13 hits in three straight nine-inning games.

ST. Louis -Dave Concepcion broke a tie with an RBI double and Buddy Bell followed with a three-run homer one out later in the seventh inning as the Cin­cinnati Reds beat St. Louis Tuesday night and snapped the Cardinals' six-game winning streak. 
Concepcion's double, his second hit in as many innings, and Bell's homer, his 11th, came off Bill Dawley, the third St. Louis pitcher. The two hits pinned the loss on Rick Horton, 6-3, and gave Cincinnati only its second victory in 11 games.

Backers set sights on opposing QBs 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 

Playing quarterback in col­lege football can be a bit scary, to say the least. 
Blitzing linebackers breathe down your throat, and the ones that stay back are usually more than willing to lay a blind-side hit on your favorite receiver. 
But in 1987, the Notre Dame coaching staff wants playing quarterback against Notre Dame to be nothing short of nightmarish. And that -in part is because of an impressive corps of Irish linebackers. 
This past Saturday's scrim­mage was a perfect example. 
"We let them on their own," defensive co-ordinator and in­side linebacker coach Foge Fazio said of his defense, which dominated the workout with all kinds of pressure on the quar­terbacks and plenty of big plays. "We wanted this to be as game-like as possible, like it was Michigan lining up across the line." 
And the Wolverines will have plenty to think about when they try to push the ball over the line of scrimmage against the Irish in less than two weeks. 
First, senior Cedric Figaro at outside linebacker. Figaro set

The making of a Heisman w1nner 
For the past three nights, dozens of students have been found camped out with pillows, pizzas and radios at Gate 10 of the ACC. 
I may be going out on a limb, but my guess is that such diligent patience is not for the upcoming Chicago concert. 
Across the street from these dedicated fans sits Notre Dame Stadium, quiet until September 19 when Michigan State and ESPN come to town for the first home game of the season. This game brings back fond memories of the Spartans last visit, and my first home game as a Notre Dame student. 
Like this year's opener, it was a night contest with Michigan State. The one play I will never forget from that game occured on the opening kickoff of the second half. Standing on the Notre Dame seven­yard line, then-sophomore Tim Brown recieved the kick, slipped through the futile grasps of eleven Spartans, broke to the near sideline and turned on the juice for a 93-yard touchdown. 
Last Thursday I stepped up to the counter at the Huddle for a Domerburger and saw that same No. 
81 on the cover of the nation's most prominent sports magazine -Sports Illustrated. 
I walked over to the deli and bought a copy. So did my roommate. So, according to the deli, did over 500 people on that day and another 400 since then. The deli usually sells 80 copies of SI per week. 
I proudly called home and told my parents to buy a copy for posterity, taped the picture to my desk 
Brian O'Gara 
Irish Items 

for inspiration as I read my 1,000 pages of govern­ment homework, and daydreamed how justice would be served if Tim Brown won the Reisman Trophy in the 100th year of Notre Dame football. Then I began to wonder-What did Tim Brown think when he walked into the Huddle and saw that familiar No. 81 looking back at him? 
"I'm excited and happy about it all," says the senior flanker. "But I realize that my luck could change very quickly. It's nice and everything, but there really is no point in worrying about it. I say, 'Hey, let's just go out and play some football games,' and let that tell the story. I'm one for showing how I can play on the field, not talking about it." 
Nothing could be further from the truth. Despite all the great publicity and media hoopla surround­ing the top candidates for the Reisman, the Trophy is won on the football field. And for Tim Brown, that is 10 days away. 
Once the season does begin, there are several important factors in the "making" of a Reisman Trophy winner. Outstanding play on the field is foremost, but it certainly doesn't hurt to have a great game in one of the first few contests, handle the ball several times per game, and have the abil­ity to break the game open with a big play.

Activities unveiled for Malloy inauguration ceremony 
By PAT HEALY 
News staff 
Father Edward Malloy will be inaugurated as University President of Notre Dame Wed­nesday, Sept. 23, with a full slate of activities planned. 
Classes will be cancelled on Sept. 23 so that students, fac­ulty, and university personnel can attend the mass and con­vocation ceremonies, accor­ding to Dick Conklin, assistant vice president for university relations. 
Heading off the day at 10 a.m. will be a mass held in the arena of the Joyce Athletic and Con­vocation Center. Following mass will be an inaugural luncheon at 11:45 a.m. at the Field House of the ACC. 
Conklin said a procession will leave the Hesburgh Library mall at 2: 15 p.m. and make its way back to the ACC arena. There the main event of the day, the academic convocation ceremony, will take place. 
Greetings from special guests and faculty will begin the convocation. Student Body President Patrick Cook, Pres­ident of the Alumni Association Joseph Reich, Dean of the Divinity School at Malloy's Alma Mater Vanderbilt Uni­versity Dr. H. Jackson Forstman, Chairperson of the Faculty Senate Dr. Ellen Weaver, Provincial of the In­diana Congress of the Order of Holy Cross Fr. Richard Warner will be among the speakers. 
Malloy's inaugural address will be his first major presenta­tion since assuming the presidency on June 1. Conklin said he expects the address highlight of the convocation to be. 
The traditional regalia of the University President, a minted presidential medal and a mace, will then be presented to Mal­loy. 
A reception at the Hesburgh Library Mall at 4:30p.m. will conclude the day.

The Observer 

No ideas remain for today's inside column 
"Four little Indians going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three." 
-Agatha Christie, "And Then There were None." 
Writing this week's column was akin to being in the novel "And Then There Were None." I had four ideas for the column; each with Pulitzer Prize written all over it. 
The first was a classic. What could be better than a column about how pretty and intelligent Notre Dame and Saint Mary's women are? 
I began writing: "The encounter occurred in a bar in Florida over the summer. 'Where is Notre Dame?' the tall, beautiful blonde asked. 'California?' 
'No,' I said. 'It's in Indiana.' 
'Ohhhhh,' she replied. 'Hey ... I'm from In­diana.' 
"I can't wait to get back to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's," I wrote. "There, the women are good looking and intelligent." 
"That's not such a good idea," said Editor­in-Chief Kevin Becker, who was reading over my shoulder. "It sounds too sexist." 
And then there were three. 

That's all right, I thought. I had a great idea about the trials and tribulations of looking younger than my 21 years. 
Again it was classic prose: 

"The dental assistant was cleaning my teeth this summer, attempting to make small talk. 'So when do you graduate from high school?' she asked. 'Ouch,' I said." 
This is great stuff, I said to myself. I pounded out a few more humorous words. 
"That's not that funny,'' said Accent Editor Mike Naughton, who had walked by my termi­nal. "You need to exaggerate to make it funny." 
I'm not exaggerating, I said. 
And then there were two. 

No problem, I thought. I'll write about the dating situation at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's--or the lack thereof. The column would rank right up there with award-winning pieces by Bob Greene, and even (gasp) Mike Royko. I starting writing: 
"'I've been here only a week and already I'm tired of parties,' a Notre Dame junior com­mented the other day. 
She's right, you know. Parties seem to be the only social outlet around here. Dating ap­parently has gone the way of the $10 textbook.'' 
"Somebody wrote a column just like that last year," a reporter reminded me. "And besides, it'll look like you're trying to get a date.''

And then there was one. 
No problem, I said to myself. I've still got 

one good idea left. No, a great idea. I'll write 
about the reasons freshmen give for wanting to 
work at The Observer. 
I began writing, using the answers freshmen 
gave at Activities Night to the question "Why 
do you wish to work for The Observer?" 
There were the straight-forward answers: 
"For the hell of it." 
There were the complimentary answers: "I 
want experience working on a paper and be­
sides --The Observer is great! ! '' And there 
were the not-so-complimentary: "I find it sadly 
lacking in a firm position aganst a number of 
outrageous attacks on student rights. Also, I 
think commies run it."' 
The column ended with a pitch for students 
to come to tonight's open-house meeting. "No 
matter what your reason,'' I wrote. 
"You're not really going to write that,'' Be­
cker said after I told him my latest idea. "It 
sounds too much like we're tooting our own 
horn." 

You're probably right, I said. 
And then there were none.

Senior chosen CK International President 
By LIZ PORTER 
News Staff 
Scott Bearby, a senior Government-ALP A major, recently became the first Notre Dame Circle K mem­ber elected President of the International Circle K or­ganization. 
Elected by popular vote, Bearby presented a prepared platform and cam­paigned for his office at a 600 member convention held in St. Louis last August. 
The Circle K organization is the largest organization at the collegiate level devoted to leadership and service de­velopment. The main goals of the organization include individual leadership devel­opment, as well as involve­ment with social service projects. 
An affiliate of Kiwanis, collegiate CKI clubs func­tion on local, district, nation­al, and international levels. The organization also spon­sors special social events, promoting friendship among club members. 
Any Circle K member may run for an international office, but experience working with the Circle K or­ganization plays a large role in a candidate's bid for of­fice. 
Bearby had the necessary experience, serving as Inter­national CKI Secretary in college and having been in­volved in high school with Key Club. 
Acting as International President, Bearby presides over Circle K chapters in seven nations in North America. Satellite groups also exist in South America, Europe, and Asia. North American countries in­volved with CKI include Canada, the United States, Mexico, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. 
Because of long distances, Bearby will not travel to all the internatiolllal Circle K or­ganizations. He will, however, visit a large num­ber of Circle K districts in the United States and Canada, exchanging infor­mation and id1~as with other club members. 
As well as his correspond­ence with Circle K districts, he will also serve as the Chairman of the CKI Board of Trustees. 
Comprised of eleven stu­dents, this board's major projects include club mem­bership development, and activity planning and man­agement. 
According to Bearby, the incorporation of leadership development in a social ser­vice group is the most ap­pealing aspect of member­ship in the Circle K club. 
Bearby said, "The organi­zation has been very good to me. It has helped me develop my leadership capa­bilities, while providing me with the opportunity to meet a lot of great people." 
Serving as chief executive officer of a non-profit or­ganization, commented Bearby, also presents him with many new career con­tacts. 
Through his new posi­tion,he brings recognition to the University of Notre Dame and its Circle K club,

SMC hall slated for dedication 
By SHANNON McGOWAN 
Staff Reporter 
The newly renovated Saint Mary's College Science Hall will be dedicated on Oct. 10. 
At 10:30 a.m. a mass of thanksgiving will be celebrated in the Holy Spirit Chapel of LeMans Hall. 
Following, there will be a luncheon for special guests in the Haggar College Center, said Mary Gerber, Director of Special Events and Programs. 
The formal dedication ceremonies will begin at 1 p.m. with an academic procession and ceremony at the main en­trance of the Science Hall. 
The theme for the ceremony is 'Achievements of Women in Science. 
The Reverend Ernan McMullin of the University of Notre Dame will preside over the dedication. 
The main speaker for the dedication symposium address is Mary L. Good, president of the American Chemical Soci­ety. 
She will also be the recipient of an honorary degree in recognition of her many ac­complishments, according to Gerber. 
Several prominent women scientists will also be present for the dedication. 
At 2 p.m. the symposium will begin in Carroll Auditorium. Other participants in the sym­posium will be Catherine Har­
mon  '67,  Terri  Menke  
Hargrave  '68,  Barbara  
Spakowski  Slatt  '71,  and  

Monica Creamer '79. A reception follows in the sci­ence hall. 
At approximately 3:45 p.m. tours of the science hall will depart from the main lobby. 
Throughout the building there will be various exhibits of the Chemistry, Biology, and Physics departments on dis­play. 
The holographic works of Douglas Tyler, Assistant Pro­fessor of Art, will also be on display. 
The cornerstone of the build­ing sums up the spirit of the dedication ceremonies "Great are the works of God to be pon­dered by all who love them"(Psalm 3:2). 
The greenhouse and some of the rooms in the classroom complex will also be dedicated, Gerber said.

Iran, Iraq continue Gulf ship attacks 
Associated Press 
MANAMA, Bahrian -Iranian speedboats and Iraqi warplanes attacked at least seven ships in the Persian Gulf within 24 hours, and U.S. war­ships prepared on VVednesday to escort more tankers through the war zone. 
The Iraqis reported a fifth day of air raids on Iranian ship­ping, oil fields and other indus­trial targets. Iran said its ar­tillery shelled military and industrial installations in southern Iraq, and Iranian planes struck in the northern area of the 730-mile border warfront. 
Eighteen attacks on ships have been reported and 13 con­firmed since Iran and Iraq, which have been at war since September 1980, resumed their "tanker war" last weekend after a six-week lull. 
Shipping executives, speak­ing privately, said the 13 con­firmed attacks in less than a week compare with monthly averages of six in 1984-85 and eight to 10 last year. 

Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Prime Minister Hussein Musavi as declaring VVednes­day that a policy of "blow for blow will be pursued in a cal­culated fashion." 
Dispatches from the Iraqi News Agency reported attacks VVednesday on two "large maritime targets," which usually means ships, and an Iraqi attack on a Cypriot tanker Tuesday was con­firmed. Iraq's reports do not identify ships attacked. 
The latest confirmed Iraqi raid was on the small offshore supply ship Big Orange 14. It was reported sunk by an air­fired missile late Tuesday near Kharg Island, Iran's main oil export terminal in the northern gulf. 
One shipping source in the United Arab Emirates, where the vessel was based, said all seven of its Indian and Sri Lankan crew were missing. Another said five had been rescued, quoting sources close to the owners. 
No one answered the tele­phone at the owner's office. 
Two empty Kuwaiti tankers and their U.S. navy escorts reached the sheikdom at the head of the gulf Tuesday. The warships are expected to make the return trip with three ves­sels that have been loaded and waiting for days. 
Iran accuses Kuwait of re­ceiving arms shipments for its neighbor Iraq, whose ports were closed soon after the war began, and since last Septem­ber has been attacking ships owned by or serving the sheik­dom. Eleven of Kuwait's 21 tankers have been given the American flag so Navy ships can protect them. Convoys began July 21. Speedboats operated by Iranian commandos fired on a

Philippine coup plans divulged 
Associated Press 
MANILA, Philippines -Con­spirators in plots leading to last week's bloody coup attempt discussed killing Americans and burning CIA headquarters in Manila, the government said Wednesday. 
A general who commanded the army under deposed Pres­ident Ferdinand E. Marcos was involved in plotting a military takeover, said the report, prepared by President Corazon Aquino's security force and released by the Presidential Palace. 
Aquino, in a national broad­cast Wednesday, said 53 people were killed in Friday's coup at­tempt, including 12 loyal sol­diers, 19 rebel troops and 22 civilians. 
Hundreds were wounded, in­cluding her son, Benigno Aquino III. 
Col. Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan, who led the coup at­tempt, remained at large, and the military intensified air and ground searches for him in Manila and north and east of the capital. 
The "after battle" report said Marcos loyalists met July 14 at a Manila restaurant to dis­cuss "CIA support for des­tabilization," bombing cam­paigns, the assassination of three unidentified Americans and "burning of CIA headquarters."

Hoosiers obey limits~ .. 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -The 65 mph speed limit that took effect June 1 on rural interstates has had a negligible effect on the number of traffic fatalities in Indiana, a state police spokes­man said Wednesday. 
State police recorded 17 in­terstate traffic fatalities from May 29 to Sept. 2, compared with 15 during the same period last year when the maximum speed on all highways was 55 mph. 
"There's no way, statistical­ly, that can be significant," Lt. Ken Hollingsworth said. 
Hollingsworth said he believes the attitude among In­diana motorists has played the biggest role in keeping the death count down in Indiana when some other states are reporting increases. 
"We in our state have reason to believe that the public has pretty well accepted the 65 mph limit as a fair speed and that people are going 65," he said. "Voluntary compliance is playing a large part in this." 
Although the number of in­terstate deaths since the speed limit increased is two greater than m the same period last year, the year-to·date count is up by six, for a total of 36 fatalities. However, Hol­lingsworth said that still is a statistically insignificant in­crease. 
He added that when traffic deaths on all rural roads are considered, the year-to-date number actually has decreased by 13, from 504 last year to 491 this year. 
About 850 of the 1,119 miles of interstates in Indiana were affected by the new law, which raised the speed limit from 55 mph to 65 mph on interstates located outside cities with populations of 55,000 or more. 
Hollingsworth said compli­ance with the law is evident not only in the fatality figures but also in reports from officers patrolling the highways. 
As an example, he noted that a trooper who clocked 100 cars in a central Indiana county recently found only seven ex­ceeding 65 mph and, of them, only two were going faster than 10 mph, Hollingsworth said.

The highest life expectancy was 78.9 years for white females, up from 78.7 a year earlier. White males saw an in­crease from 71.8 to 72.0 years. 
Black life expectancy rose from 65.3 to 65.5 years for men, but declined from 73.7 to 73.6 years for women, the center's annual summary of vital sta­tistics reported. 
Births totaled 3,731,000, down 18,000 from 1985. That represented 64.9live births per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44, 2 percent below last year and the lowest rate ever recorded in the United States, the report said. 
The drop reflects the trend of recent years, as many young people have postponed mar­riage and families to pursue education and careers. 
Social scientists have debated in recent years whe­ther this represents merely a delay in having children or a decision ~ot to have families. Only time,will disclose the an­swer as the children of the post­World War II baby boom pass through their prime childbear­ing years. 
Trends in the number of an­nual births are affected by two factors, the rate of births among women and the number of women in the childbearing ages. 
The Census Bureau has projected that the total number of women in the prime childbearing ages will remain substantially the same through the remainder of this decade. 
Turning to marriages, the center reported 2,400,000 in 1986, down about 25,000 from 1985. 
That represents a national marriage rate of 10.0 per 1,000 people, down from 10.2 a year earlier and the lowest rate since 1977, when it was 9.9. 
The all-time high marriage rate occurred in the boom im­mediately following the return of the soldiers after World War II, when 16.4 marriages per 1,000 people were recorded in 1946. The bottom was in 1932 at 7.9.

Individual identity absent from campus 

On my first day back at Notre Dame after a rather brief summer, my sister, her roommate and I ventured to the Huddle for pizza after an exhausting day of moving. At one point I noticed an oddly-dressed character sporting a perfectly ridiculous haircut and iras­cible blurted something to the effect of, "I wonder who's responsible for admit­ting jerks like him to this university." Had I not been so tired and cranky, I probably would have kept my mouth shut; but diplomacy was the least of my concerns, and, anyway, the jerk was out of earshot. 
Paul Newett 
just say 'nyet' 
My sister's friend tactfully replleo that she thought it was a good thing to have some diversity among the student body, that not everyone look and act so "conservatively." Having precious little energy remaining to chew and swallow, let alone argue, I granted the point, resumed eating, and let the sub­ject change. 
A day or two later, I read in the pages of this exalted journal that, for the first time in the history of Notre Dame, ten percent of the freshman class was com­posed of minority students. It may be safely assumed that the administration encouraged a greater percentage of minorities in the class of 1991 at least partly for the sake of diversity. 
All of this presupposes that heterogeneity benefits the university and its members; indeed, by definition a university embraces all who wish to pursue higher knowledge and the truth. I do not dispute this at all. But it is utterly preposterous to suggest that we constitute a marvelously diverse stu­dent body, as most of us would probably contend. Quite to the contrary, our backgrounds, our reasons for being here, and our notions of success and happiness are so remarkably similar that any deviation from the norm looks very peculiar to us. We are incorrigible conformists. The surface appearances that do differ are meaningless; moral­ly, we are appallingly alike. 
Most of us are children of affluence, and not unjustifiably we would like to maintain our cushy existence, both for ourselves and for our own children. But we are not merely concerned about

wealth; we are poisonously preoc­cupied with it. Here we spend four years taking a smattering of courses that will ensure our sale to the highest bidder amond the might bastions of cor­porate America; the rest is pleasant irrelevance, a brief reprieve before our inevitable sacrifice at the altar of com­merce. 
Most of us, too, find our ultimately pointless elective courses enjoyable, for they attempt to satisfy our feeble desire for true knowledge and the answers to the eternal questions. But God forbid that we should be required to put forth great effort, or fall into the clenches of some neofacist professor who incomprehensibly has a lower opinion of our effort than we invariably do. This term has only just begun, but soon the halls of the university will resonate with the incessant petulant whining of wronged geniuses. If the Al­mighty is indeed in His heaven, the in­violate sanctity of the grade point average will be preserved. 
And if all goes well, as it usually does, then we shall end our little holiday upon receiving a nice, pretty piece of paper to frame and hang on the wall to remind us of those halcyon days before we wal­lowed in the nasty business of stepping on people five days a week. But a delusory memento it will be, leading us to think that we were once vibrant members of a university, when in fact we were merely attending a finishing school for automatons. 
So it matters not a whit how many characters like the poor chap in the Huddle are allowed free rein of "self­expression" thanks to our silly egalitarianism. The thirst for diversity induces us to laud a misguided iconoclast who has embraced a very superficial form of nonconformity for its own sake. But this bizarre-looking fellow is really no different from the rest of us. After he gets his pretty piece of paper, he will ditch the screwy hair­cut, dress like a normal person again, give his execrable albums to his kid brother, and march ingloriously in step with the rest of humanity to the beat of the bottom line. Nowhere in the history of civilization is it recorded that the moral improvement of society was brought about by the proliferation of poor taste. 
And what of the unprecedented ten percent of this year's freshman class mentioned above? Can they help us cure our pernicious ills? Contrary to prevailing wisdon, the answer is very much in doubt. Many of them, happily, will be accepted by the majority but sadly assimilated into the decadence of our generation. Others, unforgivably, will fall victim to the subtle racism that persists here as anywhere else. Wel­come them, but expect nothing wonder­ful. 
In the seventeenth century, Pascal wrote, "It is a monstrous thing to see one and the same heart at once so sensi­tive to minor things and so strangely insensitive to the greatest." Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose.

P.O. Box Q 
Foreign policy 
needs Congress 
Dear Editor: 

In his editorial of August 31, 1987, Mr. Kevin Smant states that " ... Congressional involvement in foreign affairs is not new." If Mr. Smant were to consult a copy of the Constitution of the United States of America, he would read that, while "The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy,"(Article II, Section 2) only" The Congress shall have Power .... To declare war ... (and)To make rules for the Gov­ernment and Regulation of the Land and Naval Forces." (Article I, Section 8) 
No, Congressional involvement in foreign affairs goes back a long way. If General George Washington could live by the Constitution, why can't Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North?

AL roundup 
Tigers beat Tribe on one hit 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -Tom Candiotti pitched 7 ~:-3 no-hit innings until Matt Nokes singled for Detroit's only hit Wednesday night, but the Tigers beat the Cleveland Indians 2-1. 
Candiotti hurt himself with his own wildness, walking seven and making a wild pick­off throw. A walk and first baseman ~roe Carter's error led to a run in the fifth inning, and a walk and Nokes' single made it 2-0 in the eighth. 
With Cleveland trailing in the eighth, Candiotti could have been within one out of pitching a no-hitter. But Nokes lined a clean single over second baseman Tommy Hinzo's head to score pinch runner Jim Walewander, who entered after a leadoff walk to Darrell Evans. 
Candiotti, a knuckleballer, fell to 7-14. One of the victories was a one-hitter against New York on Aug. 1, when Candiotti held the Yankees hitless for seven innings. Candiotti struck out seven. 
Jack Morris, 16-7, gave up five hits for the victory. 
Blue Jays 7, Angels 6 
TORONTO -George Bell hit a two-run opposite field homer in the eighth inning to snap a 5-5 tie and lift the Toronto Blue Jays to a 7-6 victory over the California Angels Wednesday. 
Bell's homer, his American League-leading 42nd, came off a 3-0 pitch from DeWayne Buice, 5-6, and offset a two-run homer by California's George Hendrick in the top of the in­ning that had tied the score 5-5. 
White Sox 5, Rangers

CHICAGO -Greg Walker hit a three-run homer and Dave LaPoint combined with Bobby Thigpen on a five-hitter Wed­nesday night as the Chicago White Sox beat the Texas Rang­ers 5-0. 
LaPoint, 3-2, gave up four hits in seven innings. He struck out three and walked one. Thig­pen relieved to start the eighth 
and allowed a single to Ruben Sierra, who had three hits.

Last yea1~'s season opener is one that will stick in the minds of a lot of people for a lot of reasons. 
For some~, the 24-23 Michigan triumph in Notre Dame Stadium was a game Notre Dame really won. Replays clearly showed that tight end Joel Williams landed inbounds with the potentia.l game­wmmng touchdown even though an official said other­wise. 
For others, the Irish defeat was a ,case of veteran placekicker John Carney not coming through under pres­sure, as his 45-yard field-goal attempt in the game's waning seconds felll wide left and short. 
In any case, another tough Notre Dame schedule in 1987 should mean at least a few more of those nail-biters. 
against it. Under NFL by-laws, any new rule must be approved by 21 of the 28 teams. 
Under the experiment, ap­proved by the owners last spring, the 40-second clock was started as soon as the whistle blew to end the previous play. After timeouts, teams had 25 seconds to put the ball into play. 
Are the Irish ready for those games? Last year all but one of the tight contests slipped away. 
"I think our players learned what it takes to compete week in and week out against the schedule we play," Holtz said. "I hope the USC game (a 38-37 Irish comeback victory in the last game of the season) proved to them what it takes to win the close games against good teams." 
Yes, the returning Irish players have been there before. 
But the key to winning the close ones is often a good kick­ing game. And as of now, the Notre Dame kickers have not seen anything close to that kind of pressure. 
Senior punter Vince Phelan replaces Dan Sorensen as the Irish punter. The walk-on punted once all last year, a 33­yarder against Penn State. 
Kicking field goals likely will be either senior walk-on Ted Gradel or freshman Billy Hackett. 
Neither has ever attempted a field goal in a college game. Gradel made good on two extra points in the SMU game last year. Hackett has been suffer­ing from a groin injury this fall 
Under the old rule, which will be back in use for the final week of the exhibition season, teams had 30 seconds to snap the ball after the referee signalled it ready for play. 
Proponents of the 40-second clock, led by Tex Schramm of the Dallas Cowboys, argued that not only did it speed up the games but that they seemed better paced. 
and resumed kicking last week. 
Junior walk-on Reggie Ho is also in the race at the placekicker position. 
"You just can't come close to simulating the pressure of kicking in front of 106,000 people," Holtz said. "We'll just have to wait and see. Phelan has done some awfully good things in practice." 
In preparation for the opening game, Holtz began holding practice on the astroturf of Cartier Field on Wednesday. 
In addition, some of the Irish reserves (the prep team) are wearing the numbers of Mic­higan starters and running Wolverine plays against the Irish first teams. 
"You never know how they're going to play on the turf in front of 106,000 people," Holtz said. "They've been doing well on grass (scrimmages) in front of 54,000 no-shows." 
The last scrimmage of the season is slated for Friday af­
ternoon  in  Notre  Dame  
Stadium,  and  is  completely  
closed.

Women's cross country strong heading into Purdue Triangular 
By THERESA KELLY Sports Writer 
Running across the golf courses of the Midwest is not everyone's idea of a good time, but the Irish women's cross country team does just that, training hard and racing against some tough competi­tion 
Coach Dan Ryan has already seen improvement in what is only the second year of varsity competition for the Irish. 
"We've got our top seven run­ners returning," said Ryan. "Plus the addition of several strong freshmen and some good walk-ons." 
Last year's team leaders, Julia Merkel and Kathleen Leh­man, are back to improve on last season's impressive per­formances. Freshman addi­tions to the team are Jenny Ledrick, Renee Kaptur, and Terese Lemanski. 
"We're really strong and deep," said Ryan. "The teams have strong individuals, but our depth may be the deciding factor in all the meets." 
The first test of that depth comes this weekend at the Purdue Triangular. 
"We're up against some tough competition with Purdue and Illinois State," said Ryan. Both teams finished among the top fifteen in last year's tough district meet. 
"This weekend will be a good indication of what to expect for the season," said Ryan. "This

will take the place of our time trials, so we'll find out a lot about the team." 
Ryan says the team is greatly improved, but the schedule is also tougher than in 1986. 
"We've dropped the dual meet with Detroit and added Ball State, plus the Notre Dame Invitational, which includes Michigan State, Virginia and top teams from the NAIA and Divisions I and II." 
But the toughest race for the Irish will, as always, be the District Meet. The district in­cludes Wisconsin (number two in the nation last year) and Iowa (ranked No. 14 nation­wide). A goal for Ryan's team

Another battle will be for the North Star Conference champi­onship. Ryan expects the Irish and the Blue Demons of DePaul to run a close race for the title.

Notre Dame gets away with w1n 
By PETE SKIKO Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame soccer team opened its season at Loyola on Tuesday, narrowly escaping in overtime by the score of 2-1. The outcome was a little too narrow for Irish Head Coach Dennis Grace. 
"Hey, we'll take the win," said Grace, in his fourth year as the Irish mentor, "but we'll certainly have to play with bet­ter intensity than that if we're going to compete this year. We quite easily could have been up by two or three goals by the time we got our first goal, and we let down after we did score." 
The win came by virtue of freshman Steve LaVigne's goal seven minutes into the extra session on a nice feed from junior Randy Morriss. Morriss opened the scoring at the 22 minute mark with the assist going Bruce "Tiger" McCourt, the 12th leading scorer in Notre Dame history. Loyola tallied early in the second period to tie the game, and that's the way it stayed until LaVigne fired home the gamewinner. 
To Grace, however, the win was but consolation for his squad's relatively lackluster a good soccer team. Loyola performance. gained confidence with every

But I don't anticipate that we'll have many more problems similar to those as the season wears on. The veterans know

Secondary looks to hit hard 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 

If Irish strong safety George Streeter has his way, Notre Dame's opponents will be using a lot of ice and tape after 60 minutes with the Irish. 
"Except for the (Chicago) Bears," said Streeter, "I don't think any team in football will hit harder than Notre Dame this season." 
With only nine days before the Irish open against Mic­higan, defensive secondary coach Terry Forbes is readying his troops for the rigors of an­other top-notch schedule. Despite losing cornerback Troy Wilson and free safety Steve Lawrence to graduation last May, Forbes looks for good things from the defensive backs this fall. 
"We'll have a different crew out there this season," said Forbes, " but they are playing well together and they have come to understand the system very well in the past year. 
"To play defensive back, you have to know what to do, have the physical ability to do it, and maintain concentration on your job. We know what we have to do and have the physi­cal ability. Our concentration has been good, but we have to keep working harder on that aspect of our game." 
Streeter will be returning to the strong safety position that he earned midway through the 1986 campaign after Brandy Wells' knee injury. Streeter's 44 tackles last fall is tops among returning defensive backs. Battling Streeter for the starting spot at strong safety has been junior Pat Eilers, a transfer from Yale who has 

Stan Smagala 

been impressive in spring and fall workouts. 
Holding down the top spot at free safety will be junior Corny Southall, who was named the most improved defensive back in spring drills. Southall switched to the secondary last fall after coming to playing tailback his freshman year. Senior Chris K vochak and sophomore David Jandric will back up Southall. 
One of the most improved players and toughest competi­tors among the secondary is sophomore Stan Smagala. Most of his appearances last fall were on special teams, but 
a strong spring put Smagala in 
the driver's seat at right cor­
nerback. 

Smagala is more than ready 
to get the season underway. 

"I can't wait to go out and 
have the chance to hit someone 
else besides my teammates," 
said Smagala. "Right now 
we're just hitting the same 
guys every day." 

"We are very pleased with 
Stan and Corny," said Forbes. 
"They are both fairly new to 
their positions and have 
worked hard to learn what they 
need to. We expect some good 
things from both of them this 
year." 

At left cornerback, the Irish 
have two experienced seniors 
battling for the starting spot. 
Both Brandy Wells and Marv 
Spence saw a lot of action last 
fall and should do the same in 
the 1987 campaign. Wells took 
over the number-one spot from 
Spence last fall for the final two 
games of the season, and holds 
an edge at the moment to start 
the Michigan game. 

Over the last few years, Notre Dame secondaries have played in the shadow of excep­tional Irish defensive line and linebacking squads. With added depth and a hard-hitting squad, this year's defensive backfield should leave its own mark on Irish fans, as well as Irish opponents.
