Participation lags among young voters 

Turnout on decline since 1970 
By TERESA FRALISH Associate News Editor 
As the nation and its media gear up for a closely fought presi­dential campaign, another group -young people -will largely tune out this fall's election drama. 
Since reaching a peak in 1960s and 70s, political participation, and specifically voter turnout, has declined steadily among young people as well as the nation at large. 
For the most part, Notre Dame students tend to mirror the national trend of low political involvement, according to politi­cal science professor Peri Arnold, whose research focuses on the American presidency.

Renaming debate 
postponed for SUB 
By AMANDA MICHAELS Associate News Editor 
A communication error limited discussion to com­mittee project agendas at the first Student Senate meeting of the year, held Wednesday night at LaFortune. 
At the opening of the ses­sion, student body vice pres­ident Karla Bell told sena­tors that because an email with information about the proposed new business was never sent, debate and vot­ing would have to be pushed back to next week's meeting. 
The issue in question was an amendment to change the name of the Campus Programming Council back to the Student Union Board in the Student Union Constitution. Bell reported that representatives from SUB were prepared to pres­ent their argument and sug­gested that senators should take the extra time to thor­oughly review the proposal. 

In their reports, student body president Adam Istvan and chief executive assistant Dave Baron spoke with opti­mism on student govern­ment's prospects and poten­tial. 
Istvan emphasized the successful efforts to imple­

ROTC graduates fight in Iraq 
Students from ND, SMC serve in war 


By TRICIA de GROOT News Writer 
For ROTC members of the class of 2004, graduating meant more than just burst­ing the Notre Dame bubble. Several of last year's grads -who enrolled in the ROTC programs prior to the September 11 attacks -are now stationed in Iraq, serv­ing their nation in a time of global war. 
"When I got out [of col­lege,] it was peace time in the Reagan years," said Major Gary Masapollo, who just returned from serving a year in Iraq. 
Laundry, vending prices hiked 
By ANNA GELHAUS News Writer 
Not until most students are waist deep in dirty laundry do they realize just how pre­cious quarters are, but with this year's increase in vend­ing prices, spare change has become even more valuable at Notre Dame. 
Washing a load of clothes is now $1.50 and drying is $1.00. Each price is increased 25 cents from last year. Some vending machine beverages have also gone up by a dime. 
Price increases on campus are ultimately decided by

Students may stray from apathy in 2004 
By TERESA NOWAKOWSKI 
News Writer 
Touted as a national epidemic, young voter apathy may be slow­ly eroding at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
As most undergraduates find themselves voting in their first presidential election this November, the level of interest varies, but is rarely at zero. 
Alicia Heimann, a Saint Mary's junior and declared Republican, isn't directly involved in cam­paigning for the candidate of her preference, but emphasized the impact young voters can make. 
"[Many] don't realize how many of us are in our age group, and that their vote can help to make the decision," Heimann 
see APATHY/page 10 

Times have changed. 
"It is very difficult for these students. They are 22, and their first job is in the military," said Masapollo. "When they started in the fall of 2000 there was no war. Now, they have graduated, and their country is in a global war on terrorism." 
Although the attacks of Sept. 11 created a very dif­ferent national mentality, many ROTC students and grads don't feel as though the war has changed their sentiments about joining one of the services.

Lighting up 
It was everything a first time is sup­

posed to be -exhilarating, spur of the 
moment, a bit hypocritical. Clumsily 
ignoring the skeptical glances of silent, 
more experienced onlookers, defiantly 
squeezing my eye­
lids shut, I took a 
deep breath and lit 
the match. 
My eyes opened 

to a tiny spark and 
a rapid prayer I'd 
done it right. I still 
felt sorely out of 
place. 
Any moment 

now, I'd be found 
out as the abortion 
rights advocate, 
the "why not" 
voice on gay mar­
riage, the Christmas-and-Easter 
churchgoer. My disdain for dogma is 
only equaled by my fervor for a mar­
ried priesthood. Lighting up at the 
Grotto isn't for people like me. 
Is it? 
Notre Dame wears its Catholicism on 

the walls of its classrooms, the necks 
of its administrators, the rising tide of 
its library. Seeping from the 
University's roots and pulsing to its 
core, that much faith can be as intoxi­
cating as it is inspiring. . 
It can also be intimidating. Non­Catholics here -not to mention those who check the box but are Jess than convinced -are, deliberately or not, an afterthought. 
True, students and professors of other faiths make their presence felt on campus. True, the University is tak­ing steps towards diversity. But for now, homogeneity still reigns. For now, the name "Notre Dame" still implies "Catholic." 
And there's nothing wrong with that -until "Catholic" starts to imply other connotations. Like Catholic bishops who refuse communion to John Kerry, condemning the Democratic candidate and his pro-choice political peers as killers unworthy of the body of Christ. Like Catholic bishops who cover for abusive priests, shuffling them from parish to parish while shushing vic­tims as a crisis of public relations, not irreversible pain. 
In their crusading, they have lost the Church's essence. 
But at the Grotto, the essence refus­es to fade. Because at the Grotto, the essence is the whole point. Even for first-timers -especially for first­timers -its welcome is universal. 
Setting down my candle and backing away, I watched as my flame flickered next to hundreds of others. 
Just as brightly as the most vehe­ment pro-lifer's. 
Eyeing the wax trickling down the sides, I smiled as it created ridges and ripples. 
Just as smooth as the holiest priest's. 
I still felt hypocritical, or cynical at the very least. But what mattered was that I felt included. A far cry from bishops' politicized agendas and priests' muffled regrets. the Grotto's simple serenity packs a powerful mes­sage. 
Candles don't judge. 
Neither should Catholics.

Sexually frustrated chimp takes up smoking 
BEIJING, China-Sexual frustration has turned a Chinese chimpanzee from a mild-mannered simian into a problem primate who smokes cigarettes and spits at visitors, the Xinhua news agency says. 
Felli, a female chimp in the city of Zhengzhou in the cen­tral province of Henan, picked up her nasty habits by imitating visitors who behaved "improperly" around her, Xinhua quoted zoo director Liu Bing as say­ing on Sunday.

Head scarves ban gets first test 
PARIS -School doors open for 12 million French children today, but there is far more at stake this year than back-to-school jitters. 
An already contentious ban on Muslim head scarves and other religious signs faced its first test in France's public schools ­under the cloud of Islamic radicals holding two French hostages in Iraq to press their demand that the law be scrapped. 
"In the circumstances we are facing, I hope this return to school will take place under the sign of fraternity," Education Minister Francois Filion said Wednesday. 
The law forbids all conspicuous religious signs or apparel in public schools, including Jewish skull caps and large Christian cross­es. But it is aimed at Islamic head scarves and means to counter what many people fear is a rise in Muslim fundamentalism in schools. 
Several Muslim organizations set up hot lines to counsel girls in a quandary over the law. 
The law, passed in March, brought heated arguments over religious freedom, free expression and France's much cherished principle of secularism, which is seen by authorities as under threat. 
President Fox urges democracy 
MEXICO CITY -Acknowledging the frus­tration of thousands of protesters, President Vicente Fox spent much of his fourth state­of-the-nation speech Wednesday urging Mexicans to not give up on democracy, say­ing its "inherent problems are not cause for discouragement." 
For the second year in a row, Fox acknowl­edged his government had fallen short of its goals. He promised to create jobs and clean up government, especially rampant crime and kidnappings. 
NATIONAL NEWS Pentagon censors videotape 
WASHINGTON -The Pentagon censored some footage in public versions of a Humphrey Bogart-themed videotape that cost $70,500 to produce and was intended to teach government employees to respond to citizens' requests for information. 
Parts of the training video, "The People's Right to Know" were blacked out and replaced with the message, "copyrighted material removed for public viewing." Defense Department officials said they did so because they worried the government did not have legal rights to some historical footage that was included. 
Marine says he never hit Iraqi 
CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. -A Marine reservist at the center of an Iraq prisoner­abuse case took the stand Wednesday and denied landing a powerful karate-kick in the chest of a 52-year-old Iraqi who later died. 
Asked repeatedly at his court-martial whether he had hit, kicked or kneed any prisoners last year at a Marine detention facility, Sgt. Gary Pittman had a consistent reply: "Negative, sir." 
Speaking calmly and wearing a uniform loaded with military ribbons, Pittman described a prison camp run in a profession­al manner _ not the "terrordome" jailhouse where prisoners were beaten without provo­cation, as other Marines have testified.

Rise in manufacturing activity 
NEW YORK -Manufacturing activity rose in August for the 15th consecutive month, but at a slower rate than in July, according to a monthly report released Wednesday by the Institute for Supply Management, a research group. 
The ISM's index for manufacturing activity stood at 59 in August, 3 points below the 62 recorded iri July and just below the level ana­lysts were expecting. 
Contractors help small business 
NEW YORK -Many business owners find there are great benefits in using independent contractors, especially when their work tends to be on a project-by-project basis. They can hire people with different specialties accord­ing to the demands of each job. Using contrac­tors also allows small businesses to save on overhead, because unlike employees, contrac­tors aren't paid benefits. 
But there are also some drawbacks -inde­pendent contractors are free agents, and, some business owners find, not always reli­able. And owners need to be careful that in using contractors, they don't treat them in a fashion that could land the company in trouble with federal and state tax authorities. 
Owning a pet can add up quickly 
NEW YORK-Kittens and puppies at the pet store or local pound may tug at your heart­strings, but new pet owners soon find that ani­mal companions can also tug at their purses­trings. 
Caring for a pet can be expensive even if the animal has no serious illnesses or special medical needs, which can add considerably to the cost. It's something many families overlook when they're adopting or buying a pet. 
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which is based in New York, says the cost of maintaining a large dog can run about $660 a year. That would cover food, routine veterinary visits and miscella­neous expenses, such as leashes, bedding, toys and treats. A medium-sized dog can cost about $450, while a small one will run about $300. 

Overtime pay creates frustration 
Employers take unexpected heat from workers unhappy about overtime policies 
Associated Press The complaints began even before University of Missouri administrators e-mailed more than 400 employees to confirm what might seem a harm­less change soon, the memo said, they'd be eligible for overtime pay. It was not what Mary Porter want­ed to hear. It had taken Porter 35 years to climb the 
pocketbook issue, but the workers' objections are largely rooted in the immeasurable. For many, the change amounts to a difficult-to-define feel­ing that their work and status is cheapened. 
"Not every company saw this com­ing, and I certainly don't think the regulators had a sense that this was going to happen," said Jonathan Sulds,

three saw the uni­versity, armed with new government rules on overtime pay, pulling the ladder's top rungs out from under her. 
"It just feels like, in a sense, I've had something taken away from me," said Porter, an administrative associate who half-jokes that she's "trained" the last fQ6lr chairmen of the university's anthropology depart­ment. "I had that (salaried) status because I worked my way up.... It made me feel personally like I had accomplished something." 
The Bush administration's new rules on overtime pay have been at the center of a furious, and still unresolved, debate over charges they will cost millions of workers the right to overtime pay. But some employers are catching flak of a variety few expected not from work­ers angry about losing overtime pay, but from some irritated about a change that gives them the right to receive it. 
Overtime pay is the quintessential 
largely favored the 
administration's overhaul of wage laws. The changes, which took effect Aug. 23 despite vehement criticism by labor unions, are focused mainly on complex and leave much to interpre­tation. Nobody really knows how many workers will be affected, or how they will be impacted. 
The debate has included estimates that anywhere from 107,000 to as many as 6 million workers will lose overtime eligibility. Estimates of how many will gain eligibility vary from almost none to 1.3 million. It could be some time before the reality becomes clear. 
Employers, though, say strong reactions from some workers whose jobs have been reclassified from salaried to hourly -giving them access to overtime pay -has already created awkward situations. 
At Missouri, administrators are shifting between 400 and 500 salaried workers to hourly status, eligible for overtime pay. Not one of the school's 19,000 employees is los­ing the right to overtime, said Ken Hutchinson, vice president of human resources. 
The change has generated com­
plaints from many of the affected employ­ees, including administrative associates -the office managers for many aca­demic depart­ments -execu­tive assistants, and computer workers. A series of meetings held on the Columbia, Mo., campus in skilled and white-collar jobs, exempting many such positions from eli­gibility for overtime pay. 
Some of the changes are straightforward. Workers earning less than $23,660 a year must be paid for over­time under the new

But the new rules, part of the fed­eral Fair Labor Standards Act, are recent months drew up to 100 workers and professors who back them, criti­cizing the administration's plans. 
"Many have come up through the ranks and finally reached a point where they were considered to be an executive, administrative or profes­sional employee," Hutchinson said. 
Stock prices mixed as oil prices climb 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Stocks staggered to a mixed finish Wednesday as lower-than­expected manufacturing activity and rising oil prices chilled an early spate of bar­gain hunting, but technology shares posted a modest advance. 
Adding an element of gloom to a market already made sluggish by lackluster trading, oil prices settled higher for the first time in seven sessions. Government data showed a steep drop in 
U.S. oil inventories last week as imports fell and refiners continued to operate at unusually high rates, send­ing light crude for October delivery soaring $1.88 to $44 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
Underscoring how exag­gerated market moves can be when volume is light, the major indexes sank at mid­day on reports of a possible terror attack in Washington, 
D.C. The market stabilized after it became clear the incident stemmed from the accidental release of pepper spray in a restaurant near the World Bank and 
International Monetary 
Fund, which are under 
heightened alert. Still, Wall 
Street never fully regained 
its earlier momentum. 
"When you combine the 
rise in oil prices with the 
false-alarm bioterrorist 
alert, both of those events 
really took the steam out of 
the market," said Michael 
Sheldon, chief market 
strategist at Spencer Clarke 
LLC.

Abdul Hamid said that con­viction was flawed because the chief prosecution wit­ness, Azizan Abubakar, had repeatedly changed the dates of that he claimed Anwar had committed homosexual acts with him. 
Azizan had been the driver for Anwar's wife. 
Hundreds of Anwar sup­porters cheered outside the court building after the ver­dict was announced.

But his report made clear much more needed to be done. 
"The displaced have been ter­rorized and traumatized, and have lost confidence in the authorities," Annan said. They don't trust the police and the situation is exacerbated by an "increasing level of animosity between different communities and tribes in Darfur" and "a breakdown of traditional mech­anisms to resolve differences." 
To help provide security, he told the council "a substantially increased international pres­ence in Darfur is required as quickly as possible." He said an expanded force could decrease the level of violence and enhance the protection of civil­ians, particularly refugees, pro­viding a respite that would allow the people of Darfur to start reconciliation. 
Last month, the African Union proposed sending nearly 2,000 peacekeepers to Darfur, a move strongly backed by the United States but rejected by the Sudanese government. The organization is expected to make its recommendation on an expanded international presence in the coming days, the U.N. diplomats said. 
In an interview last week, 
U.S. Ambassador John Danforth warned that if Sudan resisted an expanded international presence, "then in my view the United States will have been given no choice but to support sanctions." 
While the report appeared more negative than positive, Sudan's U.N. Ambassador Elfatih Mohamed Erwa said "If it's read objectively I think it's balanced." 
Erwa told reporters Sudan has no objection to increasing the cease-fire monitoring force -"whether it is 300 or 3,000, if it helps, that's fine." But Sudan would oppose an inter­national force with another mandate, for example to disarm militias or other groups because that could lead to mili­tary confrontations, he said. 
British Foreign Secretary 
Jack Straw, who visited Darfur 
last week, said Wednesday that 
the U.N. report confirmed "the 
modest improvements" he saw, 
which he said were the result of 
international pressure. 
"But we need to do much 
more," Straw said. "A culture of 
impunity continues, with no evi­
dence that the perpetrators of 
these appalling attacks are 
being brought to justice." 
The Sudanese foreign minis­
ter, Mustafa Osman Ismail, sent 
a letter to Security Council 
members outlining what Sudan 
has done to comply with the 
resolution. It also reiterated his 
government's "readiness and 
dedication" to abide by the U.N. 
resolution and to reach a politi­
cal settlement. 
But, he added, "practical diffi­
culties are encountering the 
implementation." 
He appealed for humanitarian 
aid, support for the 10,000 
police officers deployed to 
Darfur, and rehabilitation of 
Sudan's railway, including 
spare parts for its U.S.-built 
locomotives. 
Ismail said the government 
had stopped "all military offen­
sive acts," was setting up safe 
areas for refugees, and had 
instructed militia leaders to 
abide by U.N. agreements. 
"The disarmament process will gain full swing in tandem with the collection of arms from the rebels and other irregular armed ground," he said. 
Associated Press 
UNITED NATIONS -U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Wednesday that Sudan's government has not stopped attacks on "terrorized and trau­matized" civilians in its Darfur region and urged the speedy deployment of an expanded international peacekeeping force. 
Annan did not say how large a force he wanted, but U.N. diplomats said a U.N. plan pre­sented to the African Union called for about 3,000 peace­keepers. The 53-nation African organization now has about 80 military observers in Darfur, protected by just over 300 sol­diers, monitoring a rarely observed cease-fire signed in April. 
Annan's report was called for in a Security Council resolution that was adopted July 30 giving Sudan 30 days to demonstrate it was curbing nomadic Arab tribes accused of killing thou­sands in attacks on African farm villages and also improv­ing access for aid groups. The resolution threatened punitive economic and diplomatic meas­ures if Sudan didn't move quickly. 
The secretary-general didn't mention or recommend sanc­tions, which many council members oppose at this point. His call for an expanded inter­national force, by contrast, was likely to get strong support, especially from the United States. 
The 15 Security Council mem­bers are to be briefed Thursday by Annan's top envoy to Sudan, Jan Pronk, whose observations form the basis of the report's conclusions and recommenda­tions. 
The report criticized the Sudanese government for fail­ing to meet its key obligations under agreements with the United Nations to rein in the Arab militias, which are accused of killing up to 30,000 people and forcing 1.5 million to flee their homes in the vast and arid Darfur region. 
Stemming from long-standing disputes over scarce water and arable land, the conflict erupted when two African groups rebelled last year accusing Sudan's Arab-dominated gov­ernment of siding with the Arab herders. Aid groups have accused the government of encouraging and supporting the militia attacks, a charge Sudanese leaders deny. 
"The most critical commit­ment that has yet to be imple­mented relates to the armed militias which continue to pose a serious threat to the civilian population," Annan's report said. "Attacks against civilians are continuing and the vast majority of armed militias has not been disarmed." 
On the positive side, Annan cited "some progress" by the government in improving secu­rity in newly designated havens for refugees, the deployment of additional police, the beginning of disarmament, and the lifting of restrictions to aid shipments. He also noted the government kept its promise to resume peace talks with the rebels.

Apathy 
continued from page 1 
said. 
Even with voting power, some 
students are wary of publicizing 
their politics. 
"It seems whenever I try to bring up something political in class, people squirm," Saint Mary's senior Mercera Payne said. 
This squirming could reflect the apathy that has wrapped itself around collegiate youth. 
Notre Dame junior Peter Quaranto is the student coordina­tor for the Rock the Vote cam­paign at Notre Dame believes there is a "tremendous amount of apathy" among college-aged vot­ers. 
The Rock the Vote campaign focuses on all collegiate youth and tries to create a climate in which students can talk about issues. 
"One important thing is to get people to look at the whole spec­trum of issues," Quaranto said. 
Peter Kralovec, a member of the planning committee for the Rock the Vote campaign, works specifically with mobilizing voters. 
Kralovec said he too believes it is important to focus on all aspects of politics, not only a few. 
"Catholic voters tend to empha­size the notion of a seamless fab­ric of life that only deals with life, choice and abortion." Kralovec said. "Catholics have to start vot­ing on international peace and economic justice." 
But many disagree. There are some students who care so pas­sionately about only one issue, it becomes their entire basis for vot­ing. 
Junior Angie Schuemann falls 
into this category. For her, one 
issue overshadows the rest. "The 
biggest thing for me is abortion," 
Schuemann said. "That automati­
cally makes me Republican." 
s the election draws closer. 
many people are realizing this 
election affects not only America, 
but the world as a whole. 
Saint Mary's senior Kelly Hradsky believes this election could have implications world­wide. 
"For now, other countries believe that the government is dictating foreign policy that they don't necessarily agree with, and people are waiting to see if [Americans] re-elect Bush in order to gauge if the voters in the United States really believe and support the policies Bush is rep­resenting," Hradsky said. "Our votes count. Just look at the last election." 
But students cannot affect the vote unless an effort is made ­which can be increasingly difficult when they attend schools away from home. 
"Students will have to go the extra trouble of getting an absen­tee ballot, which I think many will simply not do," Notre Dame sen­ior Bryce Cooper said. 
Quaranta implored all students to take the time to get informed and make the effort to vote. 
"If history tells us one thing, it is that the students' votes won't count because students don't vote," Quaranto said. "When we stop participating, we begin to go down an ugly cycle that tears away at our democracy."

Vets polite to Kerry after hearing Bush 
fACUUY SlAH STUDENT RATES 
Associated Press 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -John Kerry's speech to the 5,000 members at the American Legion national convention Wednesday was received polite­ly but less enthusiastically than President Bush's the day before. 
Kerry focused his speech on what he would have done dif­ferently to respond to the ter­rorist attacks of Sept. 11, and tailored many of his remarks to the veterans, stressing the country's debt to them does not end when the fighting ends. 
"You know our duty does not end on the battlefield, it begins there," he said. 
Kerry focused on the need for better health care for veterans, which many said was a topic close to their hearts. 
"He embodied a lot of con­cepts that are fundamental," said Ed Lowery, a veteran from Powder Springs, Ga., outside Atlanta. 
Lowery said he thought Bush's speech on Tuesday was good, but that Kerry "did a bet­ter job [Wednesday] as far as getting his points across. His stage presence was outstand­ing. He had a whole range of topics I think are all important to us." 
Lou Dimmerman, a veteran from Cincinnati, said he thought Kerry's speech was excellent, and added, "but I'm one of the few Democrats here." 
"His points were absolutely germane to the Legion, but they all make so many promises to us we don't know if they're really going to come through with it," he said. 
Whether Kerry could make good on his promises also was on the mind of Kenneth Dowden of Indianapolis, an Army World War II veteran. The Legion's national head­quarters are in Indianapolis. 
"I don't see how he's going to do all he said, economically, unless you get back to socialism like the other countries do," Dowden said. "His ideas are wonderful, but I don't think we can do it from an economic standpoint." 
Others were less impressed, even on a theoretical level. 
"All people have to do is look in the Congressional Record. Everything he promised (Wednesday) he voted against," asserted Ray White, an Air Force veteran from Huntsville, 
Ala. 
James Robinson of Stockbridge, Ga., a retired Air Force veteran, said he liked the speech and intended to support Kerry. He said the war records of the two candidates were irrelevant. 
"That's not a factor for me," he said. "I believe more in the issues he [Kerry] presents. The war record, even though I'm a retired veteran, is not a factor. What they're saying and doing for Americans, for my family, are the things that concern 
me."

Dog that picked up Peterson's scent failed training 
Search and rescue handler admits Labrador had failed a videotaped practice exercise 

Associated Press 
REDWOOD CITY, Calif. -A search dog handler who provid­ed key evidence against Scott Peterson acknowledged Wednesday that her canine had failed a videotaped training exercise. 
Jurors looked on as the defense in Peterson's murder trial played the video of the dog's test, made before the dog was involved in the Peterson investigation.

testified that the dog, a Labrador named Trimble, had picked up Laci Peterson's scent at the Berkeley Marina four days after she was reported missing in December 2002. 
The defense is trying to show that scent-sniffing techniques are unreliable and not based on science. 
On the video shown by defense attorney Mark Geragos, Trimble, trying to track a sub­ject, is seen wandering in and out of bushes along the road, sniffing the sidewalk and turn­ing in the opposite direction before stopping and barking. The dog later circles back in the opposite direction and the test was stopped. Anderson acknowledged the dog failed the test. 
Geragos pointed out for jurors that during a pretrial hearing, Anderson testified she could not recall her dog performing the unsuccessful test. However, prosecutors noted on redirect that the dog did eventually pick up the search subject's scent at the command center where the exercise began. 
Geragos also brought out that at the marina, Anderson did not perform a procedure intended to help rule out the possibility that the dog was smelling Scott Peterson and not his wife. Anderson insisted that the step was not necessary. 
Geragos implied that only after he issued a subpoena to Contra Costa County authorities on Aug. 3 did the tape surface. 
Prosecutors allege Peterson killed his wife in their Modesto home on or around Dec. 24, 2002, then drove to the marina and dumped her body in San Francisco Bay. Her remains and those of the couple's fetus washed ashore in April 2003, not far from where Peterson launched his fishing trip. 
Defense lawyers contend someone else abducted and killed Laci, then framed their client after learning his . widely publicized alibi. 
In her testimony Tuesday, Anderson said the dog followed the scent from the marina's parking area, along a tree line and down a pier, where the dog

stopped at a pylon at the water's edge, she said. 
The dog then "stopped, checked out over the water, the wind was coming into her face ... turned around and gave me end-of-trail indication," Anderson said. 
Judge Alfred A. Delucchi ruled during pretrial hearings that jurors would hear some, but not all, details gathered by the scent-sniffing police dogs. 
Calling the details "iffy, at best," Delucchi in March tossed out claims that other dogs had detected a broken trail of Laci Peterson's scent leading from the Petersons' home to the warehouse where Scott Peterson kept his boat .

How Buffy became literature 
When Oxford introduced English as a degree-subject in the late 19th Century, Edward Freeman, the Regius Professor of Modern History, objected that while literature may cultivate taste and enlarge our sympa-Peter Wicks thies, it was not appropriate to award Englishman degrees in the sub-Abroad ject because "we cannot examine in tastes and sympa­thies." In the absence of objective cri­teria of assessment, Freeman warned, the academic study of English literature would amount to "mere chatter about Shelley." If only it had. 
During the infancy of the discipline the focus was largely historical and philological-and hence exam­inable. That type of criticism never completely disappeared, but it was overshadowed by a series of new crit· ical approaches to literature. This is not the place to list the order of suc­cession, which would resemble the sort of genealogical table found in Genesis-"and Structuralism begat Poststructuralism"-which even the pious reader may be forgiven for skipping over. 
For understanding the malaise in literary studies, knowing the family tree of critical schools is less impor­tant than understanding the economy of prestige in academia. Within high­er education, and especially at the most eminent universities, hiring and tenure decisions depend much more on published work than on teaching abilities. Those hoping to ascend the ivory tower must publish or perish. 
But whereas in the sciences there are always new experiments to be done and it is relatively easy to con­tribute to original research in one's twenties, in literary studies it is hard for a PhD student or young professor to find something original to say about John Milton, which has not already been said by a professor who has devoted a lifetime to reading Milton's work. 
The two most influential innova­tions in the scholarship conducted in English departments, Critical Theory and Cultural Studies, are best under­stood as solutions to this problem. 
Critical Theory originally named a philosophically informed sociology practiced by a small group of Marxist thinkers associated with the Institute of Social Research in Frankfurt, Germany. Since the late '70s, in English departments across the coun­try their work was combined with ideas drawn from Marx, Freud and a number of French philosophers. 
It was a heady cocktail, and under its influence literary criticism became a diagnostic exercise in which the psychological and ideological defi­ciencies of the great authors of the past were exposed or "unmasked" [from the Latin, literally this means "I've read Nietzsche"]. Literary criti­cism degenerated into complaints that authors failed to meet the exact­ing ideological standards of enlight­ened late 20th Century professors of literatures mixed with praise if they appeared to anticipate whatever bro­mide was currently in fashion at the Modern Language Association. That is to say, literary judgment ceased to be literary at all. 
I do not subscribe to the view that English departments are full of tenured radicals indoctrinating stu­dents with their ideological preju­dices. When a professor argues that the war against Saddam Hussein could have been avoided if everyone involved had read Wallace Stevens, even freshmen know enough to smile politely while silently marveling at the inanity of the view that there are no enemies, just book circle members we haven't met yet. The real problem with the professors who preach their politics is not that they are indoctri­nating students, but that they are wasting time that could be spent teaching them to appreciate litera­ture. 
Cultural Studies provided the other opportunity for young scholars to produce original work, by expanding the scope of literary scholarship to include film, television, airport fiction and contemporary music. And so in 1990 it was possible for Henry Louis Gates, Jr., professor of English at Duke, to testify in the 2Live Crew obscenity trial as an "expert wit­ness." 
In his testimony Gates compared the rap group's lyrics to Shakespeare's "My love is like a red, red rose" -a comparison that would have been only marginally less absurd if it actually had been Shakespeare who wrote the line, and not the Scottish poet Robbie Burns. 
The following year, Harvard offered Gates a professorship. 
This semester at Notre Dame stu­dents can take a course in which they will use feminist theory to analyze Buffy the Vampire Slayer or another with a syllabus that includes Basic Instinct.· 
What those who read classic litera­ture as food for political and philo­sophical rumination have in common with those who have given up reading it at all in favor of the works of Joe Eszterhas is that neither betrays any sense of the pleasure of literature, any hint of why anyone who isn't try­ing to make a career writing about literature would ever read it. 
Literature is for amateurs, in the original and best sense of the word, which is "lovers." It is still possible to love literature and be an English pro­fessor, but as a result of the trends I have mentioned it is becoming harder for those who love literature not to hate the profession. 
We should not be surprised if some who in their youth take pleasure in books find, that in their middle age, they are more engaged by politics or television. But those who teach poli­tics and television under the guise of literature are like those priests who have ceased to believe the creeds of the Church and who instead of renouncing their priesthood convince themselves that their doubt is true faith.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Screening wisely 

On Aug. 30 in New York City, Senator John McCain of Ariz. and former mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, addressed the American people in heartfelt, moving speeches that unfortunately went unnoticed by most Americans. Appearing only on public tele­vision and the cable news networks, both McCain and Guiliani jointly and eloquently spoke of the concept of freedom, what McCain called the, "one big idea that freedom is our birthright and its defense is always our first responsibility," and what Guiliani hailed as "what the Republican Party does best when we [Republicans) are at our best." 
Reading The Observer Monday afternoon, I noticed an adver­tisement for upcoming events at the brand-new Marie P. Debartolo Performing Arts Center. On Thursday, Sept. 2 at 7 p.m., and again at 10 p.m .. Michael Moore's controversial film "Fahrenheit 9/11" will be shown as a part of an ND Cinema series, which began last week. Coincidentally, the Moore film will screen simultaneously with President George W. Bush's primetime address to the dele­gates in New York and the American people at large. 
Let me be clear. I do not object to ND Cinema's choice and right to screen Michael Moore's documentary. In fact, I believe that it is worthy of academic discussion; clearly "Fahrenheit 9/11" has indelibly influenced the genre of documentary filmmaking and the larger political debate in which America is currently engaged. Moreover, on the basis of the Michael Moore film that I have pre­viously seen, "Bowling for Columbine," I would venture to suggest that it is probably an interesting and captivating film, although most certainly worthy of critical analysis -and careful fact­checking. 
To use tonight's words of Senator John McCain, "Let us argue our differences." But let us give the President a chance to make his case to the American people and not let a "disingenuous film­maker" upstage the President of the United States. 
It is blantly irresponsible to show Michael Moore's film on Thursday evening. Please show the President's speech on Thursday night live in the Marie P. Debartolo Performing Arts Center. Please show the Presidential debates in September live in the Marie P. Debartolo Performing Arts Center. And please show Michael Moore's film "Fahrenheit 9/11" in the Marie P. Debartolo, just not on Thursday night, Sept. 2, 2004. I can think of no better venue (and if someone will buy me a ticket for Friday's screening I will go).

Don't pitch the good stuff 

How welcoming the fall colors and cool breezes were during my return to campus this fall. How welcoming also the promise of a pitcher or two of satisfying Legends import brew with my long-lost friends. Or so I thought ... 
Perhaps the reader's thoughts echo those of my friends, "No pitchers at Legends? What?" What indeed. What, pray tell, were they think­ing? 
On Monday, Aug. 30, in his article entitled, "Legends Revamps Restaurant and Club," Torn Tiberio failed to mention the biggest revamp of all: the abolishment of pitcher sales of import and domestic beers. While Tiberio highlights numerous sound improvements in the culinary experience and social scene provided at Legends, he neglects to address how the social atmosphere will be drastically impacted by the absence of shareable pitchers. 
After all, that's what makes pitchers so great. For many of us, Legends is about sitting down with some good friends, spending a few uncounted hours in meaningful conversation and probing the intellects and personalities which bring meaning to this university. It is precisely this capacity to facilitate the union of groups to partake in lively banter that defines pitchers as a vital ingredient in the recipe for a successful campus bar. 
To outline the atrocities: included in so­called "improvements" at Legends are a 21.43 percent increase in the cost of import pints (from last year's $3.50 to the current $4.25) as well as the abolishment of $8.50 pitchers of the same imports. 
I had a pint with a friend recently and the bill reached $10 with tip. Students complained about prices before, now the beer becomes downright unaffordable. When pressed for motivations behind the changes to our on-cam­pus haven, Legends personnel mentioned only financial consultation in the summer months after a review of the previous year's business. 
But if cost is truly the issue for Legends, then why not cut down on some of the options? Many people I talk to wouldn't mind drop­ping the Dreadnaught IPA among other offer­
ings in order to keep the pitcher option open. As a friend pointed out, "You don't need 100 different beers. Sacrifice a few, keep the pitch­ers." If prices must be raised on the pitchers, so be it. I see no circumstance to validate their complete removal. Perhaps a survey of the most popular imports could be undergone in order to maintain both student satisfaction and sales while still guaranteeing pitcher servings. 
Legends management, including the quoted Jim Quirk, should realize the bar's primary role as a student hangout and not as some upscale restaurant powered by an executive chef with "28 years of experience." There's nothing wrong with striving for culinary excel­lence, but remember that Legends is a student place and their prices should reflect a student budget. One way to keep the drinks affordable and maintain a student social scene is to rein­istate pitchers. 
In my fifth year at Notre Dame-now as a grad student -I certainly know of no place where one can sample such a plethora of spe­cialty, quality brews in South Bend, much less within walking distance of every dorm on cam­pus. However, I know of few students who are willing and able to pay $10 for two beers. Legends has the potential to be an integral part of campus, and as it did my senior year, Legends can make a wholesome contribution to student life. 
According to Tibiero's account, Legends is still in the process of implementing its new "improvements." The changes are scheduled for completion at the end of the month. 
So now is the time to act. Ask your server or bartender for a pitcher of London Porter or Robert the Bruce next time you stop south of the stadium. Let Legends management hear our battle cry: bring back the good times with good friends, bring back the cornraderie that every domer has come to expect, bring back Legends pitchers.

Apathy fosters apathy 
There is a stereotype mumbled about campus that generates a quick response from students saying they do not care about what happens around them. 
Stereotypes have a funny way of becoming self-fulfill­ing prophecies. 
College embodies a certain culture Staff Editorial of experiences that range from sleep, homework and class to parties, alco­North Carolina hol and drugs. Students can partici­State pate in either end of the spectrum, Technician but at what level do students care about others when it comes to illegal substances like drugs? 
Marijuana and opium are considered "soft" drugs and "hard" drugs are in the same category as crack cocaine and heroine. 
Students are pretty clear about their personal choice involving both areas. But at what point does another's choice to partake in such activities become an inhibit­ing factor to those who choose not to? 
For example, let's say a student goes to a party that has marijuana and is offered it. He says no. Does he leave the party because there is marijuana, even if there is alcohol? Or does he stay and not care about what the other person chooses to do with their life? 
Because ultimately, when someone says they do not care about another's choice, they are letting that per­son take whatever road they will take, and if they go downhill with their life, that is their fault. 
Regardless, the student would probably stay. 
He would also prefer that the marijuana wasn't there to begin with and if they are going to smoke, that they do it at another location. But that choice is theirs and it's OK if it takes them downhill -he sure isn't going with them. 
The drugs are going to be around. Even harder drugs tend to receive public interest in curbing their traffick­ing but there is a general apathy towards softer drugs like marijuana. Students simply don't care about what other students are doing unless it begins to invade per­
sonal space -only if the other individual is not their roommate, best friend or brother. Not like the other isn't any of those things to some­body already. 
There is a ridiculous amount of time and energy (and probably money) wasted policing drug use, which is in alignment with the law. Maybe students don't care for that reason, so they don't get caught. That's OK but someone else is. 
Students who have any sense of morality and human­ity would not let another person waste their life if they felt like it was being wasted. This is not just with drugs, but with homework, driving and alcohol as well. 
Otherwise, stereotypes become truth.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Pied Piper has lost his touch 

By BRODERICK HENRY 
Scene Music Critic 
For more than a decade R. Kelly has been the King of R&B. 
The Pied Piper, the moniker which Kelly currently uses, has more No. 1 hits than any comparable artist of his genre and has won numerous Grammys and Soul Train Awards along the way. Much like his literary coun­terpart, Kelly has enchanted the public with his music. By exploring such top­ics as sex. lust, love, gang violence and Christianity, he has gained a diverse following including devout R&B fans and teeny-boppers. The same man who created the raunchy sex-anthems, "Bump and Grind," "You Remind of Something" and "Feelin' on Yo Booty" also generated such inspirational hits as " I Believe I Can Fly" and "The World's Greatest." Still, with so much success, Kelly has had his fair share of problems. The much-publicized R. Kelly Sex Tape of 2002 accompanied his recent indictment for sexual mis­conduct with a minor. Such transgres­sions have done much to damage the singers' reputation and ultimately jeopardize his career. 
H. Kelly's new work, "Happy People/ U Saved Me," represents an emphatic appeal to the public for a second chance. The double CD, unlike his previous efforts, attempts to reconcile Kelly with his fans by avoiding all sex­ual overtones and ramping up the "I am a sinner and God is good" mantra. The balladeer tries his best to let the listener know he is sorry for his mis­takes and grateful for the opportunity to redeem himself. Nevertheless, since the CD is so unlike Kelly's other works, one is never really sure if it's a public relations move or an actual movement towards Christ by the Pied Piper. 
At any length, the first album, "Happy People," displays why Kelly has clearly lost his way. The album is a collection of 11 songs whose main purpose, as stated by Kelly too many times in the introduction of each song, is to make the listener dance. Nearly every song employs what has become known as the Chicago step beat: a slow relaxed groove reminiscent of some of Frankie Beverly's work. With his songs titled "Love Street," "Love Signals" and "Steppin' into Heaven," Kelly makes it obvious that by loving and "stepping" everyone can be happy. Despite the subject matter, every track ends ups sounding like a remix of the remix of "Step in the Name of Love" from Kelly's last release, "Chocolate Factory". 


The lone standout on "Happy People" is Kelly's tribute to Marvin Gaye, "If I Could Make the World Dance." With its relaxed mellow beat and smooth melody, the song sounds a lot like Gaye's "Mercy Mercy Me." Even the lyrics are reminiscent of Gaye's call to peace: "Picture us in a land I where there is no more war I shakings hands with my brother I respecting my sister I I'm offering a dance that heals I a melody that you can feel I love is the key all it takes is you me I If I could make the world dance." If only Kelly would realize how to make more songs like this song, he might actually get the listener to dance without having to ask or tell him or her to. 
"U Saved Me," the second disc, is what one might consider Kelly's heart­felt apology. Each and every song is a gospel testimony for 2004. They use the lyrical styling often found on Kelly's urban hits while surrounding them with lush contemporary R&B beats and melodies. Many of the songs focus entirely on the power of prayer. For example, "Prayer Changes" tells the story of a family suffering from numerous issues such as alcoholism, domestic violence, marital troubles and difficulties performing in school. 
The refrain of prayer changes lets the listener know prayer can make all things possible -even Kelly shedding the old role he embraced as a smooth­talking sex addict. 
Overall, "Happy People I U Saved Me" reveals two significant things about Kelly. First, even though he is not quite the artist the world knew before the sex scandals, he is still capable of stringing together not one, but two albums that are below his old standards but not bad to listen to. Although the songs on both albums are somewhat repetitive in terms of both sound and message, the message itself will appeal to Kelly's core listeners and will even get a few people to dance. 
Nonetheless, these albums demon­strate Kelly's difficulty in reconciling his past transgressions and his Christian faith with his pop icon status. No longer is he willing to explore sex in a manner few have ever attempted before or even move H&B in a slightly different direction. Thus Happy People/ U Saved Me begs the question: Will the Pied Piper ever be able to redeem him­self after leading the children so far astray?

ALBUM REVIEW 
The Hives keep rocking in latest effort 
By MIKE TENNANT Scene Music Critic 
From the depths of Sweden come five men with names like Dr. Matt Destruction, Chris Dangerous and Vigilante Carlstroem. They are led by the energetic Howlin' Pelle Alqvist and they all adhere to a strict dress code of matching black and white dress suits or jogging outfits. 
No, these are not new comic book characters. These are the Hives. 
"Tyrannosaurus Hives," released this summer, is their first album since 2000 and their third full length since the band formed in 1993. It stays with their for­mula of mixing garage rock and punk that helped them gain popularity during the garage-rock revival that brought bands like the Strokes and the White Stripes into the public eye. While their 
TVrannasaurus Hives 
The Hives Interscope 
2000 release, "Veni Vidi Vicious," was more a show of garage rock than any­thing, this new release showcases more of the punk side of this Swedish band. Containing highly-compacted and very aggressive songs, it is easy to see the influence that both the Stooges and the Clash have had on the Hives. 
"Tyrannosaurus" features twelve intense songs revolving around the theme of rebelling against the hollow and robot-like dealings of everyday life. As Alqvist fills the album with brash and aggressive wails, he makes himself a candidate for the new voice against normalcy. 
The band wastes no time as the album leads off with the strong "Abra Cadaver" in which the guitars of both Carlstroem and Nicholaus Arson work with Alqvist's voice to shatter the mold of corporate America. "They wanted to stick a dead body inside of me," he yells, " ... I tell no lies, wanted to stick an office worker inside of me." This thought continues through "Walk Idiot Walk," the first single released from the album. This is another aggressive and borderline angry song about the "idiots" who believe whatever anyone tells them and cannot think for themselves. Held together by the drumming of Dangerous, "Walk" is the catchiest song on the album, and thus a likely candi­date for radio play. 


One of the more interesting songs rounding out the end of the album is "Dead Quote Olympics" in which Alqvist and company urge others to think for themselves, instead of relying on what others have written. "You had enough of their thoughts, have your own," he scolds. "Yes they were smart but they are dead," Alqvist says over more hos­tile guitar work. 
On the whole, the album is violent and abrasive. Sometimes it feels like a band member is going to leap through the stereo and kick you in the head. The rough-around-the-edges style of the Hives fits well with the rebellious themes though, and creates an album that leaves one sweating by the end. Although only about 30 minutes in length, "Tyrannosaurus Hives" packs more punch then some seventy-two minute productions. The Hives go in hard, and then get out, making their point and usually breaking something along the way. 
Maybe this is the way rock music is supposed to be.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Sweden's Concretes craft lovelorn, urban pop 
By MATTHEW L. SOLARSKI Scene Music Critic 
Let's face it: love receives bushels (and pecks) more than its share of consideration on the vast pop music landscape. If your senior prom OJ tried to play every love song ever writ­ten in succession without stopping, it would double as your diamond anniversary gala and then some. 
Heck, South Bend boasts an entire radio station devoted to such music. So it comes as a most-welcome breath of fresh air when a band like Sweden's The Concretes quietly introduces such a stellar self-titled debut. 
The Concretes, presently eight-mem­bers ~· '"~ng and naming itself after the most :.1 .Jiquitous building material in its nadve Stockholm, concoct love songs of a different sort. Album-open­er "Say Something New" sets the tone, as chanteuse Victoria Bergsman laments, "And all the things I I had in mind I for you and me ... " The narra­tor's moribund romance is accentuat­ed perfectly by the introduction of a woozy horn section. This and the songs that follow provide the yang to love's yin, documenting the subtleties of the no-man's land between romances, all to the tune of gorgeous, sophisticated pop arrangements. 
Bergsman addresses each of the stages of non-love in turn on "The Concretes". In "Chico," she coos about seeking companionship in the title pet cat, while on "Diana Ross" she sings of the solace she finds in the diva's songs, proclaiming, "I didn't know what I feel I but you know what I feel." 
"You Can't Hurry Love," an energetic two-minute romp and one of the album's standout tracks, deals with the frustration and desire to hastily 

reclaim love once one has lost it. Other tracks explore contradictory impulses: the singer despairs over her ex­lover's new flame in "New Friend," while hinting at a fling of her own on the piano-and­vocal ditty "Foreign Country." The album's centerpiece and anoth­er of its finest moments is the waltz "Warm Night," which finds Bergsman hopeful, yet cautious as she waxes romantic once again. These stages culminate in the tellingly-titled penultimate track "Lonely As Can Be" before at last drifting into calm uncertainty with the enigmatic closing lines, "Here comes the dark I He knows the dark." Perhaps Bergsman is invoking the image of her lover-to-someday-be, one who has shared her experience in the bleak realm of non-love? 
Musically, The Concretes' jungle of orchestration is lush yet navigable. Guitars, horns, strings, a xylophone and an electric organ swirl into a rich pop mosaic, punctuating the moods and cadences captured in Bergsman's lyrics. At the same time, The Concretes exercise a restraint seldom seen in bands half their size -sever­al songs here barely cross the two­minute threshold, and never do the arrangements stray far from each song's emotional and thematic core. 

The result is something imminently memorable, a series of impressions that remain with the listener long after harp and strings dance to a finale on the album's closer, "This One's For You." As far as characteriz­ing the band's sound, musical points of reference include fellow Swedes The Cardigans and chic popsters Ivy, as well as simple-yet-sophisticated sixties acts like The Mamas and the Papas and The Beach Boys. 
If Diana Ross proved panacean to the lovesick generation that spawned The Concretes, these Swedes may indeed have created the cure for romantic maladies of the post-modern age.

Wolverines' Jackson to start at cornerback 
Defensive back hopes to start off on the right foot after a shaky offseason 
Associated Press 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. -Like he's a freshman getting ready for his first start, Marlin Jackson can't wait to play Saturday. 
After the year he went through at Michigan, it's understandable. 
"Last year I had a lot of off­the-field issues going on," he said. "This year there is a lot of clarity -just school and foot­ball." 
Jackson was suspended for the 2003 opener after pleading guilty to an assault charge, missed three more games due to injury and failed to shine at a new position. 
Despite the rough season, he had a chance to skip his senior year with the Wolverines to enter the NFL draft. but came back to redeem himself as a per­son -and a player. 
Jackson is ofT to a good start. 
His teammates voted him cap­tain, he's healthy and after one lackluster year at free safety, he's back at cornerback. Jackson is also slated to return kickoffs, for the first time since his fresh­man year, next to Steve Breaston 
"Comparing this year to last year is like night and day," Jackson said.'Tve matured so much on and ofT the field. I knew I needed to come bac·k to do both." 
Jackson and the eighth­ranked Wolverines open their season at home against Miami of Ohio. The RedHawks (1-0) have the nation's longest winning streak at 14 games. 
"It's easy to respect them because you know what a great team they had last year," Jackson said. 
Miami lost its star quarter­back, Ben Roethlisberger, to the NFL draft, but Josh Betts threw for three touchdowns and ran for a score in a 49-0 win over Division 1-M Indiana State last week. 
"He has a nice arm and looks off the defensive backs well," Jackson said."He's a first-year guy, but he has a little bit of experience, so he'll be a great quarterback to go up against. He moves the pocket nicely." 
Jackson tarnished his nice-guy image a year ago. 
He was sentenced to a year of probation and ordered to spend 10 days in a jail work program after pleading guilty to a misde­meanor assault charge. He was accused of hitting another stu­dent in the face with a bottle, but said he only threw a punch. 
After escaping trouble whiie growing up in a rough neighbor­hood in Sharon, Pa., Jackson said he made a late-night mis­take. 
"I put myself in a bad situa­tion, but in the long run, it's going to help me a lot," he said."Everything means so much more to me now after going through what I did last year." 
The Wolverines had more tal­ent at cornerback than safety last year, so Jackson agreed to switch positions after being sec­ond-team All-American as a sophomore. 
After standing out for two seasons at corner, the preseason Big Ten defensive player of the year merely blended in as a solid free safety for the conference champions last year. 
"That's a fair assessment," he acknowledged. 
The 6-foot-1, 199-pounder made 50 tackles," two intercep­tions and broke up four passes. In his first two years, he had six interceptions and broke up 25 passes. 
"All season, I wanted to be back at corner, but I fought through it and bit my tongue," Jackson said. 
Well, Jackson did hide his true feelings until the season was over. 
"If I'm back here, I'll be at cor­ner," Jackson said after USC beat Michigan in the Rose Bowl. 
He now calls that an irrational moment. 
"That was all my frustration built up from the whole season," Jackson said."J didn't tell any­body how upset I was about playing safety -until then." 
One look at the ever-present smile on Jackson's face shows how happy he is to be playing cornerback again. Michigan coach Lloyd Carr is glad, too. 
"He has got great quickness. He's tough. He's smart," Carr said."He's not a cover-corner. 

He's a cornerback. He's going to tion. tackle you." "He can lock down a whole 
Michigan strong safety Ernest side," Shazor said."He just had Shazor said Michigan's defense to get his swagger back, and he's got better the moment Jackson got it. It didn't take him that moved back to his natural posi-long."

After the brief workout, Sanders was ushered into a packed media trailer. Wearing a Ravens hat, a black Ravens T­shirt and a bulky gold chain, Sanders promptly answered this pressing question: Why come back? 
"I wanted the opportunity to win it all, and that's it," he said."That's the only reason I'm here." 
Sanders didn't believe the 2001 Washington Redskins had a chance to reach the Super Bowl, which is why he chose to retire before the beginning of training camp that season. 
Sanders will begin his career with the Ravens as a nickel back. If he shows that his body can stand the rigors of the NFL, he could spend some time at his familiar cornerback position and, as he hinted Wednesday, might even play a little offense. 
''I'm willing to do what I can to help this team win, whatever that entails," he said. 
A month ago, as he began to work out at his Dallas home in preparation for a possible return, Sanders never doubted he was coming back. 
"I just felt the adrenaline, I felt the fire, I felt that passion," he said."I felt that dog in me, and I knew right then I had to do what I need to do to help this team win." 
The Ravens needed a nickel back after another veteran, Dale Carter, developed a blood clot in his lung just before the start of training camp. At that point, Lewis and Fuller got on the phone and dialed Sanders. 
"I said, 'I want to run some­thing by you. I want you to come play with me,'" Lewis recalled. 
"From there, we just ran with it," Lewis said."He's just coming to have fun with his brothers." 
The potential to earn $2 mil­lion probably didn't hurt. Sanders was released from his job on the CBS pregame show after he asked for more money than the network was willing to shell out, but he pointed out Wednesday that he had no shortage of lucrative opportuni­ties, including a couple of tele­vision shows. He also intended to coach his son's sixth-grade football team. 
"Even at 37 years old this guy can come back and do things that have never been done, even when he was younger, because now his mentality is different," Lewis insisted.

At age 37, Sanders seeks Super Bowl ring with Baltimore 
Associated Press 
OWINGS MILLS, Md. -Deion Sanders insists he didn't come out of retirement for money, accolades or to prove he's still got a wealth of talent at age 3 7. 
He wasn't bored, either. 
The man known as"Prime Time" ended his voluntary three-year hiatus simply because he wanted to win a third Super Bowl ring -this time with a couple of friends who pleaded with him to help the Baltimore Ravens win another championship. 
Wearing a purple jersey with the No. 2 (his customary No. 21 belongs to Pro Bowl cornerback Chris McAlister). Sanders prac­ticed Wednesday with the Ravens for the first time. He then moved to a side field and worked an extra 15 minutes with secondary coach Johnnie Lynn and safety Corey Fuller, who, along with linebacker Ray Lewis, convinced Sanders to return to the NFL.

Yankees players still embarassed by Monday's 22-0 rout 

Division leaders say the record loss to Cleveland was afluke 
A..sociatcd Press 
NEW YORK -When Derek Jeter got home after the historic 22-0 loss to Cleveland, he had no desire to tune in to replays of the latest installment of the Slide of the Yankees. 
"I've got cable problems in my apartment right now," New York's captain said Wednesday, a day after the most one-sided defeat in the 1 01-year history of baseball's winningest team. 
Much of New York was shocked by Tuesday night's loss. which matched the biggest post­1900 shutout margin in the major leagues. The Yankees' AL East lead, 10 1/2 games on the morning of Aug. 16, was cut to 3 112 games over second-place Boston. 
"STINKEES" blared the back page of the Daily News. 
"WORST LOSS EVER!" read the sports page headline of the New York Post. 
On the sign boards outside Yankee Stadium and on some of the scoreboards inside, fans were greeted before the game by various messages, including: "When the going gets tough, the tough get going."

EAGLE, Colo. -The Kobe Bryant case collapsed Wednesday as prosecutors said they had no choice but to drop the sexual assault charge against the NBA star because the alleged victim did not want to testify. 
With the parents of the 20-year-old accuser looking on, District Judge Terry Ruckriegle threw out the case under a deal that means no charges will be reflled. 
"The people have filed a motion to dismiss this case based on the fact the sole· victim at this time is unable to go forward," District Attorney Mark Hurlbert told the judge. He said the alleged victim did not want to participate in the trial, including taking the stand. 
The woman's attorney, John Clune, said his client has been through an extremely difficult time over the past 14 months and was disturbed by a series of courthouse mistakes that included the release of her name and medical history. 
"It is in her sincere belief that when this case ends she does not want to be brought back into the crimi­nal process," Clune told the judge. "The difficulties that this case has imposed on this woman the past year are unimaginable." 
Ruckriegle admitted mis­takes had been made and took full responsibility.

Hurricane Frances may postpone FSU-Miami game 


Associated Press 
MIAMI -Florida State and Miami may have to wait a few days before playing their sea­son opener. 
School officials were strong­ly considering postponing the game five days from Monday to Sept. 11 because of Hurricane Frances. They were expected to announce a decision Thursday. 
"We'd like to play it, but I'm not sure it's in the cards," Florida State president T.K. Wetherell said Wednesday. 

Wetherell said evacuations along Florida's east coast would cause travel problems for fans, band members and others heading south to the Orange Bowl. The hurricane also could be moving through Tallahassee on Sunday or Monday. 
''I'm not sure we want to be gone with all that going on," Wetherell said.

because of hurri­canes in the last seven years. 
The Hurricanes had a game against UCLA postponed more than two months in 1998 because of Hurricane Georges, and had one against Temple delayed nearly three months in 1999 because of Hurricane Irene. 
The game between No. 5 Florida State and No. 6 Miami was scheduled to be the only prime-time game on Labor Day.

Florida International also plays against Jacksonville on Thursday in Miami. 
In baseball, the Florida Marlins had not decided whether to postpone any of this weekend's three-game l)eries against the Chicago Cubs. A possible solution could be a Friday doubleheader, with the third game played when the Marlins travel to Chicago for a scheduled three-game series Sept. 10-12. 
"I hope it still works, but it sure doesn't look good," Wetherell said. 
Frances, a Category 4 hurri­cane with 140 mph top sus­tained winds, was due near Florida's Atlantic coast late Friday or early Saturday. 
The threat of the hurricane forced Hampton and Jackson State to move their season 
opener  Saturday  from  
Orlando's Citrus  Bowl  to  
Virginia.  

Other Florida schools were waiting to see Frances' progress before deciding what to do about their season openers. 
The Florida State League canceled its final three days of games in the East Division, starting Friday, but play in the West will continue. Daytona Beach-Vero Beach playoffs were to start Tuesday, but league president Chuck 
k 
Murphy said that could change if Frances damages stadiums. 
Also Wednesday, the University of Florida men's basketball team postponed a weekend trip to the Bahamas. The trip will be rescheduled after this year.

COLLEGE ATHLETICS 
Indiana expected to name new AD 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Indiana University President Adam Herbert is expected to name a new athletics director at a news conference Thursday on the Bloomington campus. 
Media reports indicated the finalists included Army's Rick Greenspan and Wisconsin's Jamie Pollard. 
IU officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday night. Earlier this week. search committee chair­man Ken Beckley said Herbert was waiting to make his deci­sion until several references returned from the Athens Olympics. Beckley did not identify any of the candidates. 
Both Greenspan and Pollard would bring strong fund-rais­ing skills to Bloomington, where the athletics depart­ment faces a $2 million deficit. 
Greenspan has led Army's athletics department for six years. During his tenure, Army has upgraded its facili­ties, adding a multimillion­dollar football press box and lights at Michie Stadium. He also signed a radio deal that expanded Army's reach into the New York market. 
He served as Illinois State's athletics director from 1993 to 1999. lie also spent one year as associate athletic director at the University of Miami, eight years at California­Berkeley, three years at Wisconsin-Milwaukee and a year at the University of New Hampshire. 
Pollard has served as the senior associate athletics director at Wisconsin and is credited with devising a strat­egy that helped increase rev­enue by more than $6 million. 
The search for Indiana's fourth athletics director in five years began in May, when Herbert announced that Terry Clapacs would return to his primary job -vice president for administration. 
Clapacs was named interim athletics director in November 2002 when Michael McNeely resigned after 16 months on the job. Clapacs continued to do double duty after interim President Gerald Bepko gave 
him the job for  an  additional  
year in April 2003.  
McNeely  had  replaced  

Clarence Doninger, who retired at the end of the 2000­01 school year.

Ichiro's total only most since '38 
Associated Press 
TORONTO lchiro Suzuki's 56 hits in August are still impressive -only they're not the most in a month by a major leaguer in 68 years as originally report­ed. 
According to ongoing research by the Elias Sports Bureau, Suzuki's total is the highest in a month since Jeff Heath got 58 for Cleveland in August 1938. 
When Suzuki got his third hit of the game Tuesday night for Seattle against Toronto, it was announced at SkyDome that he had matched the most since Cleveland's Roy Weatherly also got 56 in July 1936. 
The Mariners based their information on work by inde­pendent researcher David Stephan. Elias. baseball's statistician, found Heath's mark on Wednesday. 
"Either way it's phenome­nal." Seattle manager Bob Melvin said. "Fifty-six hits in a month just doesn't hap­pen." 
The major league record for hits in a month is unknown, Elias said. 
Coincidentally, Heath and Weatherly were longtime teammates in the Indians' outfield. They both made their big league debuts in 1936 for Cleveland at age 21. 
Weatherly got off a great start after joining the Indians in late June 1936. The next month, he got those 56 hits on his way to batting .335 that season. 
Heath was a two-time All­Star with Cleveland. Boosted by his big month, he hit .343 in 1938 with 112 RBis. and led the AL with 18 triples.

With 212 hits through Tuesday night, Suzuki is pur­suing George Sisler's major league record of 257 hits in a season, accomplished in 1920 with the St. Louis Browns. The Mariners had 31 games left going into Wednesday night's game at Toronto.

MONTREAL -Ryan Smyth scored two goals to lead Canada to a 5-1 victory over Slovakia on Wednesday night in the World Cup of Hockey. 
Canada, which beat the United States 2-1 on Tuesday night, improved to 2-0 in the tournament and is now guar­anteed a home game for the quarterfinals next Wednesday in Toronto. 
Martin St. Louis of the Tampa Bay Lightning had a goal and an assist while Boston Bruins center Joe Thornton and Philadelphia Flyers forward Simon Gagne also scored for Canada. 
Martin Cihak scored in the third period for injury-riddled Slovakia, playing its first World Cup. 
Canada played without defenseman Ed Jovanovski, who will miss the rest of the tournament with a strained right knee. Defenseman Wade Redden also left the game early in the third period with an undisclosed injury. 
The Slovaks, already miss­ing Zigmund Palffy, Michal Handzus, Peter Bondra and Ivan Majesky to injuries, got another setback on Wednesday when Montreal Canadiens forward Richard Zednik was hospitalized with food poisoning. 
Slovakia made a surprise decision to start Rastislav Stana in goal instead of usual No. 1 Jan Lasak and saw him beaten twice in the first five minutes. 
Thornton stripped defense­man Zdeno Chara in front of the Slovak net and scored 
3:02 into the game. Smyth added his first goal when he beat Stana at 4:43, and the route was on. 
Canada closes out round robin play on Saturday against Russia in Toronto. Slovakia plays the United States Friday night in St. Paul, Minn. 
Sweden 4, Czech Republic 3 
Peter Forsberg, Mattias Ohlund and Henrik Zetterberg each scored on the power play for Sweden, which nearly blew a four­goal. third-period lead before holding on for a win over the Czech Republic in the World Cup of Hockey on Wednesday. 
The victory clinched home­ice advantage for Sweden in the quarterfinals. Sweden is 2-0 in the four-team European pool going into Saturday's round-robin finale against archrival Finland, which shut out the Czechs 4-0 Monday. 
Finland plays Germany away in Cologne on Thursday. The Czechs close out the round-robin portion Friday at home in Prague against Germany. 
All four teams advance to the quarterfinals after round­robin play. 
The Czechs had a chance to tie the game when, already with a man advantage, they pulled goalie Tomas Vokoun for an extra attacker with 
1:48 left. 
But the Czechs failed to capitalize on the two-man advantage. Mikael Tellqvist made two superb saves as the Czechs pressed in the Swedish zone. 
The Czechs, now 0-2 in the tournament, outshot Sweden 18-2 in the last period and 40-20 overall.

Colangelo 

restgns ahead of schedule 
Associated Press  
PHOENIX  Jerry  
Colangelo resigned  as  chief  
executive  officer  of  the  

Arizona Diamondbacks on Wednesday, four months ahead of schedule. 
Colangelo, who agreed last month to leave on Dec. 31, will remain as chairman through the 2005 season and then serve as emeritus team executive, the club said. lie also will have duties as a liaison between the team and major league baseball. 
Colangelo was forced out on Aug. 6 by four business­men who became majority owners two years ago. In the same power move, player agent Jeff Moora-d was hired as Colangelo's replacement. 
Moorad, who wasn't sched­uled to become the CEO until Jan. 1, will now take over on Oct. 15. 
"After spending time with Jeff and upon further con­versation with the team's general partners, I am confi­dent that Jeff is up for the task and am comfortable with him taking the reins of the organization." Colangelo said in a statement. 
Colangelo brought a major league baseball franchise to Arizona in 1998, and the Diamondbacks won the World Series three years later. But he plunged the team into debt to sign the veteran players who beat the New York Yankees in the 2001 World Series. 
That opened the way for partners from outside his personal circle to sign on. and eventually to his ouster. 
Utilityman Greg Colbrunn, acquired from Seattle last winter for his second stint with the Diamondbacks, said Colangelo deserves to be remembered for his winning touch. 
"He not only brought big­league baseball to Phoenix, he brought three division titles and one world champi­onship, and it was while he was in charge," Colbrunn said. "The respect that he commands was well-earned." 
Injured left fielder Luis Gonzalez, a former client of Moorad. had mixed feelings about the development. 
''I'm excited for Jeff, and I'm going to miss Jerry at the same time," Gonzalez said.

Fulfillment, Completeness Ei: Trips to Meijer... 
by Brett J. Perkins Director, Protestant Student Resources tt Peer Ministry 
Along with those important decisions about just how to arrange your furniture and when to make yet· another run to Meijer, another thought might have crossed your mind. Maybe it came to you last Sunday, as you heard the Basilica bells out your open window at the seemingly ungodly hour of 
10:00 am. Perhaps it came to you when you were daydreaming in one of your classes, and found your gaze unexplainably transfixed on the Man hanging upon the cross. Or maybe you heard the stomp of men and women heading downstairs toward your hall chapel last Sunday night. Regardless of when it hit you, the question is the same: 
"How is God going to fit into my new life now that I'm away at college?" 
For many students, given the newfound freedom you have at college, you are no longer under the watchful gaze of your parents. No longer are they close by so as to assure your spiritual nourishment each week. But now what? What will you do now that nobody is "taking attendance"? I propose three responses to the above questions: 
Option #1. Do nothing. Now that your family is out of the picture, cease and desist all faith-based activities, whether out of rebellion, protest against some Church teaching you find particularly unsettling, or simple indifference to organized religion. 
Option #2. Continue with the bare minimum. Make it to Sunday services, barely squeaking in before the Gospel reading. Whatever you do, don't sing. Daydream through the homily. Receive Communion, but then leave immediately following. From the time you leave the church or chapel, do nothing to deepen your faith until the next Sunday, at which time you might decide to venture back to chapeL 
Option #3. Embrace the Decision to GET INVOLVED. You realize that now is the time for you to take on the yoke of faith for yourself. You realize that at an institution so steeped in faith, surrounded by so many resources devoted to supporting the choice you've made to follow Jesus, you are more poised than ever to take on the responsibility for your faith. You understand the loss that it would be to graduate from the world's foremost Catholic-Christian university, with a degree that shows your developed aptitude in your area of study, while still possessing the same level of faith development that you had when you first arrived. 
Over the course of this year, take the time lo commit yourself to exploring all that Notre Dame Campus Ministry has to offer you. Challenge yourself to experience new forms of prayer and praise, perhaps by attending /Four:7/ on Wednesday nights (IO:OOpm, CoMo Lounge). Search out traditional forms of prayer that might be new to you ...the rosary, Bible study, Eucharistic Adoration, singing in a choir. Learn more about your faith and why you hold to the beliefs you do. And if you're not Catholic, don't fall into the trap of thinking that there's nothing for you at Campus Ministry. Learn about the many programs we offer for prayer and fellowship with other Christians. Attend our "What if I'm Not Catholic?" session this Sunday afternoon from 2:00-4:00pm in the CoMo Lounge. And if you want to find a church off-campus, we can help with that too. 
As a Notre Dame graduate, I know well the stress that accompanies the rigorous academic programs offered at our university. I know the added burden of trying to maintain a social and extracurricular life. I know the headaches that can sometimes be caused by family and friends, roommates, and residential life in general. But despite all these stresses, a greater question emerges: how will I find fulfillment and completeness during my years at Notre Dame? All the elements you need are here; knowledge, faith, understanding, and a deeper sense of self-identity and self­worth are all within your grasp, surrounding you in this place. 
As you finalize the floor plan that is just right for that closet-sized room, as you make that last big trip to Meijer, I challenge you to open your eyes to the many opportunities available for you to embrace all that Christ Jesus has in store for your life. As you continue to seek fulfillment and completeness in life, keep in mind one insightful prayer by St. Augustine, written in 397: 
"Our lives are restless, Lord, until they rest in You."

Williams' outfit catches attention 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Wearing what she described as her "micro-mini" outfit, third­seeded Serena Williams advanced to the third round of the U.S. Open on 

thing." 
Williams said she felt at ease in the first two rounds of the open, relaxed and calm with nothing to lose. 
And as for her outfit -'-a black, studded tank top that revealed her midriff and matching tight shorts -she simply smiled. 
"I have another surprise for the next match," she said. 
Second-seeded Awelie Mauresmo almost got sur­prised, dropping the first set to Julia Vakulenko. But Mauresmo recovered to win the match 3-6, 6-2, 6-2. 
Mauresmo overcame 34 unforced errors and 10 dou­ble faults and finished the match with her fourth ace. 
"L started very slow in the first set," said Mauresmo, who won the silver medal at Athens. ''I'm looking forward to improve my game because I am not satisfied now." 
Gustavo Kuerten, the for­mer French Open champion who was seeded No. 20, was a first-round loser, beaten by Kristian Pless 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 7-6 (4). Kuerten was done in by 40 unforced errors.

Just as Hewitt was finish­ing off Ferreira, Mark Philippoussis w s forced to retire in the fift set against Nikolay Davyden o when his body betrayed hi again. 
Philippous;;is, finalist at the Open in 1998, has battled a litany of kne InJuries. There have been three oper­

21 straight matches, No. 23 Vince Spadea posted his first win at the Open since 2002 by defeating Luis Horna 6-7 (3). 6-2, 6-4, 6-4. He has lost in the first or second round of this Grand Slam event seven times, including his last three appearances. His ranking dipped to 229 in 2000, in the midst of his losing streak. 
But Spadea stayed with his game, battling his way back. He won his first career title at Scottsdale earlier this year and even though he made 50 unforced errors, he won the match and that was some­thing he wasn't always able to say. 
Earlier, Daniela Hantuchova took another step back up the tennis rank­ings ladder, defeating No. 17 Alicia Molik 6-4, 6-3. 
Ranked as high as No. 5 in the world last year, Hantuchova had tumbled to No. 32 and was facing a for­midable opponent in Molik, who came into the Open with the bronze medal from the Athens Olympics. 
But Hantuchova, a runner­up at Eastbourne and a quar­terfinalist at the Open warmup in New Haven, used effective drop shots and played confident, aggressive tennis to pull off the upset. She was almost flawless on her approaches to the net, winning 17 of 20 points. 
Beat!)n by Patty Schnyder at Athens, Hantuchova looked steadier than she had in her first-round match, when she dropped the first set and then came from behind to defeat Camille Pin, winning the last two sets in tiebreakers. 
There was no need for those kind of dramatics against Molik. 
Hantuchova next plays No. 15 Schnyder, who defeated Iveta Benesova 6-4, 6-1. In other early matches, No. 31 Maria Vento-Kabchi defeated Julia Schruff 6-1, 2-6, 6-2 and No. 12 Ai Sugiyama defeated Gisela Dutko 6-2, 6­

No. 14 Fernando Gonzalez, a double medalist at the Olympics, made a quick exit, losing to Robin Soderling 6-1, 7-6 (3), 6-7 (4), 6-1. Gonzalez won the doubles gold with Nicolas Massu and the sin­gles bronze at Athens.

caught a 59-yard touchdown in which he amassed several yards after the initial reception. 
''I'm ready to play," he said. "''m trying to do it all now. They have me in there in all kinds of situations, but I just want to go out there and make plays." 
Schmidt, a former walk-on who got his start playing inter­hall football for Zahm Hall, emerged last year as a receiv­ing threat -making 13 recep­tions for 125 yards-while also showing his skills as an aggres­sive blocker. He figures to battle Powers-Neal and junior Nate Schiccatano for playing time at fullback this season. 
"It's definitely friendly compe­tition [between Rashon and 1]," 
Schmidt said. "That's not to say we don't try hard and get after each other everyday, but we go out there and our mind­set is to go out and play hard and let the coaches decide who plays." 
Schmidt, whose Briar Crest High School (Tenn.) 
team went to the state finals three years in a row, was not recruited by Notre Dame, but elected to attend the school anyway for its academic reputa­tion. 
"Honestly, when I came here, I wasn't planning on playing football," Schmidt said. "When I walked on I didn't think I'd make the team, when I made the team I didn't think I'd ever get to play, so I'm very happy with where I am. 
"The coaches here are great. They tell you when you first get here, they don't care who you are, the best player is going to play. So being a walk-on, it's encouraging for you, because you know if you go out there and work hard, and if things fall into the right places that they're going to give you a 
shot." 
Schmidt maintained his scholarly apti­tude even after JOimng the team in 2001, and was awarded the Notre Dame Club of St. Joseph Valley Knute Rockne Student-Athlete Award in 2003. 
''I'm ready to play. I'm trying to do it all now. They have me in there in all kinds of situations, but I just want to go out there and make plays." 
Rashon Powers-Neal Irish fullback 
"I just want to improve as a blocker because I know that's something I need to improve on coming out oflast year. " 
Josh Schmidt Irish fullback 
For this season, though, 
Schmidt would like to focus more on brawn than brains. 
"I just want to improve as a blocker, because I know that's something I need to improve on coming out of last year," he said. "I want to improve as a lead blocker and also get a little bit better 
at catching the ball out of the backfield." 
Notes 
+ D.J. Fitzpatrick, who kicked two 50-yard-plus field goals in Friday's scrimmage, is expected to be the starting kicker and punter when Notre Dame kicks off its season against BYU Saturday. 
"We are still analyzing our position and looking at each of the candidates day-to-day, but I believe that right now our punter in this ballgame would probably be D.J. Fitzpatrick," Willingham said. 
Fitzpatrick, who started eight games in 2003 as the kicker and punter, was expected to compete for the starting posi­tion with sophomore Geoffrey Price. 
+ Notre Dame is tentatively 
Dame has maintained its policy of playing a roughly equivalent number of home and away games, but that policy might be in the process of changing. 
"I would think it's a great advantage to have another home game," Willingham said Tuesday. 
+ It was still undecided as to whether linebacker Brandon Hoyte, who injured his arm in a recent practice, would start the BYU game as of Willingham's conference Tuesday. 
Corey Mays is expected to replace Hoyte if he is unable to perform Saturday. 
"Corey has been a real delight in our program," Willingham said. "He's willingly [improved his knowledge of the defensive scheme] and put himself in position, where now if you looked at our linebacking corps, we would have a rotation of four and not just three starters."

Brown said her combined 
efforts spurred the Irish on to 
victory. 
"She plays defense as 
== well as any­one in the program," Brown said of the fresh­man who was a four time All-American in Stasluk high school. "We really struggled in game three because she felt a little sick and had to sit out. She does a lot of little things that make a difference. We really noticed the difference when she was out." 
Despite such a poised demeanor on the court, Stasiuk admitted that inside, she was full of pregame jitters. 
"I was really, really nervous and anxious because it was my first collegiate game," the Park Ridge, Ill. native said. "When I was sitting in class at the end of the day, I kept thinking about the match." 
On Brown's wish list for Stasiuk this season is minimiz­ing this sense of anxiety. 
"I want her to be more com­fortable with her role on the team so she can do what we need her to do on the team," she said. "It's really important for our freshmen to realize that it's still volleyball. While the balls are hit faster at this level, it's just a game at the end of the day." 
The freshman's next test will come in this weekend's match against No. 2 Nebraska. It's no secret that defeating the Cornhuskers will be a daunting task. 
But Stasiuk anticipates the challenge. 
"We're really excited for the Nebraska match," she said. ''I'm not as nervous anymore because we're the underdogs in that match, so we don't have anythin2 to lose,"

No. 25 Irish prevail in season opener against Loyola at home 
By MIKE GILLOON SportS Wrirer 
It's a start. That's one way Irish coach Debbie Brown might describe Wednesday night's opening victory over Loyola Chicago. 
"We were a little inconsistent tonight but I also saw a lot of good things," Brown said after watching her team win the first two games. then lose the third before finally finishing off the Ramblers in a four-game victo­ry at the Joyce Center. 
Notre Dame appeared ready to steamroll its way to an easy match win as aces from Adrianna Stasiuk and Meg Henican helped them to take game one, 30-24. 
Outside hitter Emily Loomis had two key spikes to put the Irish ahead 14-8 midway through game two as her team­mate Lauren Brewster aided the Irish attack with an impres­sive kill. She extended her whole body backwards to make solid contact with the ball and send it flying over the net giving Notre Dame a 22-11 lead. The Irish cruised from there to win game two 30-19. 
"I thought in game two we came out really, really strong," Brown said. "Emily Loomis was hitting the ball really well, and I thought she showed good prom­ise." 
Game three was a totally dif­ferent story for the Irish as Loyola played with much more intensity than they had in the first two games. Though small­er and less athletic than Notre Dame, the Ramblers used hus­tle and strong serving from out­side hitter Courtney Ashley to take an early 20-10 lead. Brown took a couple of time­outs to try and rally the Irish, but they didn't work.

Freshman hitter Stasiuk steps up in first college game 
By ANN LOUGHERY Spores Writer 
Adrianna Stasiuk doesn't look like a freshman. 
Judging by her performance against Loyola Chicago Wednesday night, Stasiuk could have easily been mistaken for a seasoned veteran. The fresh­man starter played fearlessly, diving and pivoting for each loose ball as if it were a fragile commodity. 
"She has great instincts for the game and she's very, very quick," Irish coach Debbie Brown said of her 5-foot-10 freshman. "It's her agility and quickness that make the plays. She sets a lot of balls and her serving, passing and defense are all very strong. She's a real­ly steady player all-around." 
Stasiuk made an impact in all corners of the court Wednesday 
night. In addition to serving five aces -the most made by an

Chicago defeats Belles in 3 
By JUSTIN STETZ Sports Writer 
The Belles got their first taste of competition Wednesday night as they took on the University of Chicago. 
The game was a good way for the team to see where it stands going into the 2004 season. A year ago, Saint Mary's started its preseason against the Maroons and faced them again during the regular season -winning in three straight games. 
"Tonight, the score really didn't show what the team was trying to accomplish," defensive specialist Michelle Gary said after the match in which the Belles were swept in three games. "We we're just trying to mix up the offense and find out our strengths." 
A few bright spots were especially seen in the play of a couple of much improved juniors. Outside attacker Michelle Turley, who did not see much action last year, had a very good game. Middle hitter Bender also did a great job, picking up right where she left off at the end of last season. Bender ended the 2003 campaign with 510 total
