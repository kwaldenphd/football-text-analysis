Du Lac manual revised · 
By MONICA YANT 
News Editor 
Four areas of change were 
implemented this summer in du 
Lac, most notably the inclusion 
of a stricter alcohol policy and 
a discriminatory harassment 
policy. 
The alcohol policy, formally implemented in 1984, was modified in response to what the University viewed as a problem of "large quantities of alcohol" being openly trans­ported on campus, according to William Kirk, assistant vice president for Residence Life. 
The new provision in du Lac states that "those of legal age may only possess or transport in any public area of campus an amount of alcohol which is consistent with the concept of responsible individual con­sumption." 
When a student of legal age is transporting alcohol, the alco­hol must be in a closed con­tainer with "suitable packag­ing," defined by duLac as a bag or box. 
The change also states that "alcohol may not be provided for those who are under:age." 
Du Lac defines "provide" as 
selling, lending, giving, ex­
changing, bartering or furnish­
ing in "any way." 
For underage students, the 
provision in du Lac regarding 
transportation remains the 
same, stating that "no underage 
person may possess or 
transport alcoholic beverages in 
any public area of campus." 
VIolation of the policy will be handled by rectors if the inci­dent occurs in the residence hall. However, if the violation in another part of campus, the student will be referred to the Office of Residence Life. 
Enforcement of the policy will vary from case to case, Kirk said. While he said that it is "not common" that campus se­curity will randomly stop stu­dents transporting alcohol to check for IDs, students spotted with large quantities will be stopped "regardless of age." 
While the key words of the transportation provision seem to be "responsible individual consumption," Kirk admitted that the phrase is not com­pletely clear. He noted that rec­tors, residence assistants, and Security may all have different 
ideas about what the average 
individual could claim as an 
amount equal to respqnsible 
consumption. 
"But," he said, "anything short of being a dry campus leaves a gray area." 
Kirk stressed that the change is simply a modification of the overall alcohol policy. "There's no hidden agenda here," he said, "no grand scheme or plan." 
He said that the change re­flects the Officers of the Uni­versity's opinion that an alcohol policy promoting responsible drinking is preferable to a dry campus. "If they had thought we should go dry now, they would have [decided to]." 
The purpose of the policy change is twofold, according to Kirk. First, the portion aimed at underage drinkers is to "remind students of their obligation under Indiana law" that possession of alcohol is illegal. 
Secondly, Kirk said the rule aimed at legal drinkers will promote a more educated and responsible attitude toward al­cohol consumption.

Republics breaking away 
MOSCOW (AP) -President Mikhail Gorbachev struggled Sunday to stem the disintegra­tion of his authority, but a sixth Soviet republic declared independence and Russian leader Boris Yeltsin continued to assert control. 
Gorbachev huddled with top advisers, preparing a speech for the national legislature on Monday. But Yeltsin and other reformers said they wanted to bypass the largely conservative legislature and convene the more reformist Congress of People's Deputies. 
Yeltsin, speaking Sunday night on Russian television, said the national legislature should formally dissolve Gorbachev's Cabinet of Ministers, many of whose members were involved in last week's failed coup, including Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov. 
Yeltsin said he would prefer to call a session Tuesday of the Congress, the 2,250-member body that selects the 542-mem­ber legislature. 
"It's better to gather the Congress of People's Deputies a day later and decide all ques­tions straight away on the in­volvement of the Cabinet of Ministers, on the replacement, the structure, new cadres ­much will have to be changed," Yeltsin said in his televised re­marks. 
In the chaos created by the hard-line coup, the 15 Soviet republics were moving to assert their independence from Gor­bachev's central government. 
Byelorussian lawmakers passed an independence decla­ration, becoming the sixth re­public to do so. The Ukraine, the second-largest republic, de­clared its independence a day earlier. Georgia and the three Baltic republics have also de­clared independence. 
Said deputy Zenon Poznyak, head of Byelorussia's pro-inde­pendence People's Front fac­tion, "This means we are leav­ing the Soviet Unio~." 
The Moldavian legislature planned to discuss indepen­dence on Tuesday, the news agency Interfax reported. 
Meanwhile, France, Argentina, Norway and Denmark said they were recognizing the independence declarations of the three Baltic republics ­Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he expected the United States to take the same step shortly. 
Gorbachev's spokesman, Vi­taly lgnatenko, acknowledged that "there's no one today to prevent the national republics from choosing their own road." 
Ignatenko, interviewed on CNN, stressed that Gorbachev wanted to keep the process within legal bounds. But events appeared to avalanche beyond Gorbachev's control. 
The failed coup led to a stun­ning upheaval of the Soviet power structure, culminating in Gorbachev's resignation Satur­day as Communist Party chief. 
Gorbachev also urged the party leadership to disband and barred the party from operating in the armed forces, gov­ernment, police, courts and KGB secret police. And he crip­pled it financially by ordering its vast holdings turned over to the parliament. 
In continued fallout from the coup attempt, Gorbachev's top military adviser, Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, 68, committed suicide on Saturday, presidential aide Karen Karagezian said. He offered no details. 
On his desk, investigators found a suicide note and a statement from the coup plot­ters telling him how to act when their putsch began, Russian television reported. 
The suicide note said in part, "Everything I have devoted my life to building is collapsing," the TV reported without elabo­ration. A Yeltsin spokesman said he knew of no evidence linking Ak.hromeyev to the con­spiracy. 
Gorbachev, held under house arrest during the 63-hour coup attempt, met Sunday with former adviser Alexander Yakovlev and aide Yevgeny Primakov to prepare measures he will propose to the legisla­ture for coping with the crisis. He also will address the fate of parliamentary speaker Anatoly

Notre Dame student mugged in his own front yard 

By MONICA YANT News Editor 
Less than 24 hours after moving into his off-campus house on California Ave., senior Steve Kozachok was mugged and robbed in his own yard. 
For Kozachok, the incident was more than a rude welcome back to school. It was a painful reminder that "you aren't safe. Anywhere." 
The incident occurred around 
10 p.m. Sunday evening. Koza­chok and two of his roommates had walked across the street to a convenience store when they noticed a group of approxi­mately seven youths playing nearby. 
Having already met and en­tertained some of the neigh­borhood kids, the students didn't really think anything of it. "There's no way I thought that they would beat us up," he said. 
Moments later, one of the youths, who Kozachok de­scribed as black males between the ages of 12-17, approached them. 
By this time the group was in

One year until seniors face 'Real Life' Well,.the freshmen have------­had their turn in the spotlight all weekend. Every R.A., rector, parent and freshman orientation committee member have devoted incredible amounts of time and energy to making this a Lisa Eaton weekend to remember. Managing Now they are as ready as they are going to get to embark on the whole college experience. There is no turning back now for the freshmen-love it or not (and I'm sure that they'll do a little of both in the next four years) they are bonafide college students ready to give it their all for old Notre Dame. But this column isn't for the freshmen, it is for for those of us who are preparing to walk those last few miles to that fateful day in May when we will get our walking papers and will be able to fly this coop for parts unknown. Love it or hate it, all of u~ seniors are getting ready to to stare into the ugly face of reality and right now we are all hoping that we don't flinch. The seniors are wondering about the big four letter word beginning with "L," namely LIFE. "Will I be able to get a job when I graduate?" "Where will I be living next year?" "Will I be mooching off of the parental unit for the rest of my life?" are all questions that float through the nightmares of the typical senior. A poll should be taken to try to get some sort of an idea how may times this year's class of seniors has been asked what they are planning to do after they graduate. A cautious guess might put the total well into the trillions. Oh sure, we've conquered the college scene with grace and style for the past three years. Most of us survived Freshman Chern, choosing a major and JPW like a troopers. We can do it all with the best of 'em. (We are THE Sesquicentennial Class, so of course anything less than the best would be unworthy of us.) But now, the realization that very soon most of us are going to become really, really, really tiny fiSh in this huge, gigantic, enormous sea called "Real Life." It is kind of a scary thought. Actually, it is a really, r~ally scary thought. Despite the fact that the seniors are on the brink of a very serious life change, we are, of course, going to handle this with all of the style and grace that we have shown in the past three years. Sure, we are walking towards the door that will push us out into the real world, but our party isn't over yet. So, I would like to propose a toast (sparkling grape juice for all of the freshmen and those of us who are still underage). To the freshmen, mat they have a great four years. May they love it and hate it and learn a lot regardless. To the seniors, it has been the best of times and the worst of times, but we survived it all. So here's to one fmal year of fun, football and friends.

United flight hero retires at age 60 
SEATTLE (AP) -The United Airlines pilot credited with saving 184 lives when he crash­landed a crippled DC-10 in an Iowa cornfield two years ago made his final flight on Monday, joined by other survivors. 
Capt. AI Haynes, who reaches the mandatory federal retirement age of 60 on Saturday, resisted being labeled a hero. 
"If going to call me a

His wife, Darlene, said: "He's always been a hero to us all, but that doesn't excuse him from taking out the garbage." 
Earlier Monday, Haynes told reporters at Denver's Stapleton International Airport he was "one of thousands" who helped save lives of those aboard Flight 232, which crashed near Sioux City, Iowa. 
"That's about the size of it," said Haynes. "It was a team effort right on down the line."

scores fell to a record low last year in verbal skills, The College Board reported today. Math scores also sank for the first time since 1980. 
Board president Donald Stewart said the drop signaled a "disturbing pattern of educational disparity" in which too many students aren't studying enough advanced high school courses to do well on the college entrance examination. 
Math averages declined two points to 474 among students taking the test in the 1990-91 school year, while scores on the verbal section averaged 422. 
The verbal averages were the lowest since national records were kept in 1969. Verbal scores hit a recent peak of 431 in 1985, but have slid steadily ever since. 
Both sections of the multiple choice exam taken by more than 1 million high school students are scored on a scale of 200-800, with a combined 1600 being the highest possible.

The College Board, a private, non-profit education 
organization, sponsors the test. 
Board officials attributed the declines to factors in and out of school, including a steady increase In nm;nber of minority pupils taking the test but who generally score well below the national averages. 
Such students now make up 28 percent of SAT test-takers, compared with 11 percent in 1973, the board reported. 
They also said many schools aren't assigning enough homework, aren't stressing writing, and are offering students watered-down math. Many also blame parents who allow too much television and do little to encourage outside reading. 
Iowa had the highest average among the 50 states: 515 verbal, 578 math. But only 5 percent took the SAT, mainly those seeking admission to top private schools. South Carolina, where 58 percent took the test, 
averaged the lowest verbal, 437 math.  - 395

Smith's attorneys want Lupo to remain on rape case Murder plot trial begins 



for cheerleader's mother
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -William Kennedy Smith's attorneys said Monday his judge should remain on the rape case, rejecting as baseless prosecutors' demands that she disqualify herself. 
Claiming the state is "judge­shopping," defense attorneys criticized the Aug. 20 motion by lead prosecutor Moira Lasch that Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Mary Lupo should leave the case. 
Prosecutors accused Lupo of a lack of candor about her fam­ily's friendships with attorneys on. the case and alleged she showed bias toward the prose­cution with her rulings and fa­cial expressions. Lasch accused Lupo of bias for postponing the trial until Jan. 13. 
The state motion was sup­ported by an affidavit by the 30­year-old woman who says Smith, 30-year-old nephew of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D­Mass., raped her March 30 at his family's Palm Beach estate. 
Lupo hasn''t responded. 
Prosecutors had warned that Smith's attorneys could use the conflicts for a later appeal. Smith's attorneys said Monday they had In effect waived an appeal by failing to act on the Information months ago. 
Lupo's husband and prosecu­tor Ellen Roberts' husband are former law partners, which the defense was informed of in May. 
The defense papers said the state has tried to goad the court with "inflammatory motions" and "an abusive tone." The papers said that ruling against one side in a case doesn't prove a judge is biased. 
Prosecutors said Lupo's ex­pressions had also been cited by defense attorneys in a 1989 personal-injury case that re­sulted in her being removed by a state appellate court. 
Smith's attorneys replied that the appellate court's decision was based on Lupo's adversar­ial role in a hearing, not her expressions, and that the Florida Supreme Court ruled such expressions aren't grounds for removal. 
HOUSTON (AP) -A woman accused of trying to hire a hit­man to murder the mother of her daughter's cheerleading ri­val spoke of having the woman killed or sold into slavery, a prosecutor said Monday. The defense called it a set-up. 
As the trial began, both sides promised to show how tangled family relationships and a bit­ter divorce resulted In the solic­itation of capital murder and kidnapping charges against Wanda Holloway.

scheming to take her children away from her. 
But prosecutors said Hol­loway contacted Terry Lynn Harper, her ex-husband's brother, after her 13-year-old daughter, Sfianna, lost a spot on the cheerleadlng squad again to Amber Heath. 
Harper testified Monday that Holloway told him she hated Heath and her mother and wanted to do away with them. 
"She asked me what I would do. I said you could get one of these Colombian drug lords and have her taken to Colombia and have her sold into white slav­ery," Harper said. 
Amber's mother, Verna 
Heath, testified that she was 
startled to hear about the plot, 
but said Holloway's jealously 
didn't surprise her. 
"When they told me her 
name, I said, 'Does this have 
anything to do with cheerlead­
log?' because it all kind of fell 
into place," Heath said. 
At first, prosecutors said, 
Holloway wanted Amber and 
her mother killed or kidnapped, 
but then settled on only the 
mother because she could not 
afford to pay for both murders. 
Holloway, a homemaker from 
suburban Channelview, was ar­
rested Jan. 30 and has been 
free on bond. If convicted, she 
could be sentenced to life in 
prison. 
Authorities say Holloway 
hoped Amber would be so 
upset about her mother's death 
she would drop out of the next 
cheerleading competition, 
thereby improving Shanna's 
chances of winning. 
Prosecutors said Harper was 
on probation for drunken driv­
ing when he was contacted by 
Holloway, and in turn contacted 
police because he didn't want 
to tangle with the law again. 
While Harper wore a hidden tape recorder, he and Holloway met to discuss the plan, prose­cutor Mike Anderson told the jury in his opening argument. 
"On the tape she will talk about death and suggest that Verna be kidnapped and sold into slavery," Anderson said. "You will hear her say, 'I don't care what you do with her, I just don't want to see her In Channelview again." 
Authorities also allege that Holloway offered an under­cover officer -posing as a hitman and referred by Harper -a pair of diamond earrings worth $2,200 as collateral for the killing, which would have cost $2,500. 
'She was very concerned with 
the cost," Anderson said. 
But defense lawyer Troy McKinney said her thrift was evidence she wasn't serious about the crime. He said she and her husband are worth $2 million and routinely keep up to $7,000 in cash in their house. 
"Monev would not have stood in her way," he said. 
McKinney said Harper, hav­ing learned of Holloway's dis­appointment about Shanna's cheerleading defeat, contacted her and said: "'I can take care of that for you.' But Wanda said, 'That's crazy."' 
Several times in the taped conversation, Wanda demurred on the murder plot, at one point saying, "Blow it off! I don't want to do It," McKinney said. 
"Why would Terry Harper do this? Because he was the black

Protestors demonstrated; clinic director injured 
WICHITA, Kan. (AP)-An es­timated 25,000 abortion foes rallied at a stadium here, cap­ping six weeks of protests. Hours earlier, demonstrators roughed up an abortion clinic director In one of the most violent protests yet, police said. 
TV evangelist Pat Robertson was among those at the rally who called on abortion foes to continue their campaign In Wi­chita. 
"What we are trying to do Is protect children from the cruel forceps of money-grubbing vul­tures who masquerade as men of medicine," he said. 
He also said U.S. District Judge Patrick Kelly -who has jailed abortion foes for violating his order against blocking clinics -should be impeached. 
"These men and women are not criminals and lawbreakers and disobedient to lawful authority," Robertson said at Wichita State University. University officials estimated the crowd at 25,000. 
After the rally, Operation Res­cue spokesman Gary McCullough said the national group would turn the Wichita anti-abortion crusade over to local leaders. 
Police and federal marshals have made more than 2,600 ar­rests, mainly for trespassing, since Operation Rescue began demonstrations In mid-July. 
Wichita has been targeted because one of its clinics performs late-term abortions. 
Earlier Sunday, Wichita Family Planning Inc. opened unexpect­edly, and about 100 protesters gathered. 
Clinic director Debbie Riggs was pushed and shoved by two protesters at the clinic's back entrance when she arrived at 
7:30 a.m. to open the center, police said. 
"She was physically roughed up, but she wasn't injured," said Deputy Police Chief Steve Trainer. "She was a little shaken." 
Two officers who responded were surrounded, and one officer sprayed Mace on protesters, Trainer said. "Nobody got hurt," he said. 
Sixty-one people were arrested Sunday, 59 on trespassing charges and two on assault charges, said Deputy U.S. Mar­shal Denls Amico. 
Authorities said patients were able to enter the clinic, one of two covered by Kelly's order barring harassment of doctors, employees or patients. 
During the siege, some protesters have been arrested as many as eight times. Wichita officials estimated more than 1,400 individuals, many from out of town, have been arrested. 
Kelly has sentenced a handful of Operation Rescue leaders to jail terms for violating his order. Most protesters are released within hours of arrest. 
The ProChoice .Action League held a rally of its own on the banks of the Arkansas River on Saturday. About 6,000 people attended.

Florida murder suspect linked to Lousiana killings 
TAMPA, Fla. (AP)-The main suspect in the slaying of five Gainesville college students may be linked to a 1989 triple murder In Louisiana, police said In an affidavit unsealed Monday. 
The affidavit in support of a search warrant was released as jury selection began In a rob­bery trial for Danny Harold Rolllng. The trial began a year to the day after the first two victims were found In Gainesville. 
tast week, police In Shreve­port, La., Rolling's hometown, obtained blood, saliva, and hair samples from Rolling In an In­vestigation of the Nov. 4, 1989, triple slaying. 
The affidavit from Shreveport Detective Don Ashley said Rolling's saliva will be com­pared to saliva swabbed from a bite mark on the breast of vic­tim Julie Grissom, 24. 
Grissom, her 55-year-old father, Tom, and 8-year-old nephew Scan were stabbed to death. Authorities believe Grissom was the target. 
The saliva found on Gris­som's breast was from a person with type B blood who secretes identifying blood chemicals into other body fluids, the affidavit said. It's the same makeup Holling Is listed as having, the document said. Twenty percent to 25 percent of all males don't secrete blood chemical Into their body fluids. 
The affidavit also said Holling, 37, lived In Shreveport during late 1989,jogged at the same track as l.rlssom and on the 
day of the slaylngs was fired from his job at a restaurant, a mile from her home. 
Hair and fiber evidence from Rolling's car was turned over to the FBI for comparison to samples found at the murder scene. 
"The FBI has advised the Shreveport Police Department that hair recovered from the Grissom house and Rolling's vehicle have been mlcroscopi­cally compared and found to have similar characteristics," the affidavit said. 
Shreveport investigators said fresh blood, saliva and hair samples were needed to con­firm their suspicions and to create a DNA profile. 
Mary Lou Cuellar, Rolling's lawyer In the Tampa robbery trial, lost her fight last week to keep the affidavit sealed, fear­ing disclosure and the publicity of the Gainesville anniversary would ·make it impossible to pick an unbiased jury. 
Rolling is charged with hold­ing up a grocery and starting a shootout with deputies a few days after the last bodies were found in Gainesville. 
Rolling has been in jail since September after pleading guilty to holding up an Ocala super­market. 
No one has been charged in the Gainesville murders, but authorities have named Rolling as the prime suspect and Ed­ward Humphrey as a second suspect. 
The Tampa charges, which carry a possible life sentence, aren't related to the student murders 80 miles away, but au­thorities say they are significant because the car Rolling was driving In Tampa was stolen from a Gainesville student housing complex two days after the last bodies were found. 
Families of the live Gainesville dead gathered Monday in that college town for the laying of a wreath at a memorial created last year at a graffiti-covered
wall. Five bouquets of white roses sat in vases at the base of the wall. 
The parents of the victims at­tended the ceremony, but wouldn't talk to the media. 
The murders focused national attention on Gainesville, a town of 85,000, during the first week of classes at the University of Florida last year and sparked intense fear among students and residents.

'Cheers' wins big at Emmy award night; Neuwirth and Alley receive top honors 
PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -The barroom comedy "Cheers" hoisted a leading four Emmy Awards, including the prize for best comedy series and trophies for stars Kirstie Alley and Bebe Neuwirth. 
NBC's "L.A. Law," won its fourth Emmy for best dramatic series at Sunday's awards cer­
emony. 
Other major winners in­cluded: James Earl Jones of ABC's "Gabriel's Fire," best ac­tor in a dramatic series; Patri­cia Wettig of ABC's "thirtysomething," best actress in a dramatic series; and Burt Reynolds of CBS's "Evening Shade," best actor in a comedy series. 
"Cheers" now has a total of 26 Emmys, pulling even with "Hill Street Blues" for the sec­ond most Emmys ever for a series. "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" has the most, 29. "The Carol Burnett Show" is fourth with 22. 
"I said we were good, but now we're venerable I guess," said "Cheers" director, co-creator and co-executive producer James Burrows, who also won the comedy directing trophy. 
Other multiple winners in­cluded another awards pro­gram -the 63rd annual Academy Awards -which picked up three statuettes. 
Winners and presenters at the 43rd annual Emmy Awards wore red ribbons on the Fox broadcast in a show of support for AIDS research and people with AIDS. 
Comedian Gilbert Gottfried's wisecracks about Pee-wee Herman actor Paul Reubens' indecent-exposure arrest went out live on the East Coast, but one minute and 40 seconds were censored when the tape was shown in later time zones. 
"Masturbation's a crime, I should be on death row!" Got­tfried said. "To. think that by age 14, I was already AI Capone!" 
Kirstie Alley's win as best ac­tress in a comedy series comes four years after she replaced Shelley Long in "Cheers." 
"I only thank God I didn't have to wait as long as Ted," said Alley, who plays insecure Rebecca Howe, manager of the Boston bar. Co-star Ted Danson was nominated eight times before winning last year for best actor in a comedy. 

Bebe Neuwirth captured her second consecutive Emmy for supporting actress in a comedy for her portrayal of the cold-as­ice psychotherapist Dr. Lilith Sternin-Crane.

Reevaluating last year's unrest 
The COTH department is to be 
congratulated for its choice of 
Arthur Miller's Crucible for its 
first show if this year's season. 
His classic play of Salem witch­
hunting is not only a fine 
drama, but a message which is 
timely for our campus. 
Last year we saw a local manifestation of a national movement on university cam­puses which demands a rethinking of traditional concepts of higher education. This many-headed dragon is known by various buzzwords-"multiculturalism," "cultural diversity," "political correctness." Students and faculty pressing this issue have done so with a righteousness approaching religious zeal. 
On a national level, this phe­nomenon has seen the culmina­tion of a 30-year process of re­visionism in higher education, moving into its last phases, where even faculty join in at­tacking the very canon-works which are considered essential reading for students seeking to be educated members of West­ern culture. 
Some arguments are worth thinking about; ethnic-Ameri­can authors have been ne­glected be academia and Amer­ican society does not need to rethink its cultural self-concep­tion. 
But it is not the issues them­selves which are frightening, but the zeal and moral indigna­tion with which their interlocu­tors press. 
On many campuses, the purging of "wrong" ideas, pro­fessors and students holds eerie echoes of Salem and its McCarthyist inheritors. 
Most disturbing is the Impli­cation given that those individ­uals who oppose these mea­sures, for whatever reason, are lumped together as racist, sexist reactionaries who would like nothing better that to turn back the clock on civil rights. These "incorrect" individuals must be

Notes from Underground 
brought to see the light by the missionaries of multicul­turalism. In another not so distant age they would claim to be doing God's work. 
SUFR began in much this fashion at Notre Dame. Begin­ning on the Administration Building steps on a chilly, Jan­uary afternoon, many minority students combined to demand charges toward "cultural diver­sity or else." 
From curriculum reform and faculty hiring to a "multicultural center" ala the University of Michigan, these demands were pressed in demonstrations and rather silly chalk drawings with increasing fervor. 
Questions and anxiety under­standably developed among the student-body. After all, they were indicted along with the Administration as being racists who were leaving these stu­dents out of the Notre Dame family. 
Inflaming the situation was the fact that SUFR had struck a nerve when it broke the rules of engagement for campus politics. For dialogue to occur in an open forum, there must be certain understandings which allow discussion of an issue to progress and conclude in a constructive way. 
This unwritten gentlemen's agreement allows reason to govern an orderly debate. Each side agrees that it has, after all, only an opinion. But when a political policy is equated by a 
·group with moral right, the agreement is broken and the dialogue ends. 
People stop listening to words and hear only noise. This hap­pened when SUFR reportedly help secret meetings barring whites from entrance and then proceeded to take over the Reg­istrar's office. For a few hours, a siege mentality set in and the 
campus dangled over the abyss 
of either anarchy of repression. 
The issues were obscured. 
Fortunately for everyone, 
cooler heads prevailed. 
Amnesty was granted by Father 
Malloy and SUFR began a 
course of moderation. It has 
broadened its membership and 
leadership along both racial and 
ideological lines. 
SUFR has applied for recog­
nition as an official student or­
ganization. Two open forums 
were held, in Lyons and here in 
Planner, where members of 
SUFR met with students to ex­
plain their issues. 
Somehow, SUFR managed to tack away from the national "movement" and form its own identity, one incorporating the principles of reason and under­standing and tolerance which make Notre Dame a place worth returning to each August. 
Gentlemen's agreements are again functioning between SUFR and the rest of the cam­pus. We may in fact owe SUFR a debt of gratitude for raising the level ofdebate on the cam­pus above the inane. More fo­rums will be held. 
We have avoided the hysteria and the shee-r madness that Arthur Clark's Abigail and Par­rish fall victim to. A process of difficult and gut-wrenching dia­logue has begun. A soul­searching perhaps unprece­dented on this campus has oc­curred and continues. 
A path of self-destructive malevolence and self-righ­teousness has been avoided. That the future will hold no re­turn to this path, however, is far from certain. Administration intransigence or renewed student frustration may yet provoke another round of madness. So when you watch the Cr.ucible this fall, remember it well.

Honoring Ireland's Prime Minister results in negative Irish stereotype 
Dear Editor: 
In a May of the Irish Echo newspaper, much of its front page was devoted to Notre Dame and the honors bestowed on Charles Haughey, Prime Minister of Ireland. 

Throughout the years, Notre Dame bas cemented into Amer­ican folklore negative stereo­types of the Irish people. Be­cause of Notre Dame, America knows that the Irish are fighters {the Fighting Irish), super­stitious {the leprechauns) and of course, drunkards. 
Mr. Haughey represents a government that has aban-

Happy Birthday, 


As the University turns 150, ayear-long bash is being planned 
By JOHN O'BRIEN 
Accent Editor 
If you can't pronounce 
"sesquicentennial," nonetheless spell it, 
don't worry-you'll have plenty of time 
to learn. 
This year marks the 150th year that 
the University has been in existence 
and students, faculty and 
administrators are planning a year­
long celebration. 
The sesquicentennial celebration 
kicks off on the weekend of Sept. 13 
and 14 and continues until Nov. 26, 
1992-the actual 150th anniversary of 
the University's founding, according to 
Dennis Moore, director of public 
relations and information. 
By then, everyone should be able to 
pronounce, if not spell, 
"sesquicentennial." 
The opening weekend will be jam­
packed with events, starting with a 
symposium, convocation and the 
dedication of the Hesburgh Center for ·International Studies. 
While there Is traditionally an 
opening mass at the beginning of each 
school year, this year's mass will serve 
as a formal opening of the 
sesquicentennial celebration, Moore 
said. 
That mass will be held in the Joyce 
ACC at 4 p.m. and a picnic dinner will 
be held on Cartier Field following the 
mass, Moore said. 
The Committee on the 
Sesquicentennial of the University Is 
being chaired by Eileen Kolman, dean of the Freshman Year of Studies, and Hoger Schmitz, vice president and associate provost. Schmitz and Kolman are also chairpersons of the University Steering Committee. 
Father Richard Warner, counselor to the president's office, is chairman of the University and community-wide celebrations. Nathan Hatch, vice president for graduate studies and research, is chairman of the committee in charge of concluding events. 
These committees include faculty, administrators and students. 
Perhaps the biggest event for most students is the revival of a Homecoming weekend, said Katie Pamenter, student committee chairwoman. 
Homecoming weekend actually commences on Thursday, Oct. 31, Pamenter said. Homecoming dances will be held for both minors and those over 21, she said. 
The under-21 group will have a costume party/dance in Stepan Center and the over-21 crowd will have the Halloween Party at the Alumni-Senior Club, Pamenter said. This over-21 party is sponsored by the Senior

end at the JACC, she said. The Notre Dame Marching Band will then lead spectators into the stadium for a pep rally, she said. 
In addition to the ND band, the parade will feature community groups (including a local high school band) as well as student floats, Pamenter said. Dorms have been paired up and will work on their floats together, she said. 
The pep rally will feature speeches by head football coach Lou Holtz, several players, and other special guests, she said. A student master of ceremonies for the pep rally will be chosen through a contest that will be held during September. 
The pep rally will also include the selection of the Homecoming King, Queen and their court, she said. 
The dorms and various student organizations will nominate two individuals who represent the 'Spirit of Notre Dame,'" Pamenter said. Then, an election will narrow the candidates down to ten men and ten women. 
Out of this group, a court of seven men and seven women will be chosen, Pamenter said, and the king and queen Alumni Association will host a recep­tion for members of past football teams and their spouses, Pamenter said. 
A luncheon and autograph session with these former Irish players will take place after the reception, she ­added. 
The rest of the year will be full of cultural events, meetings and celebrations, Moore said. 
 
All of the colleges of the University will be holding symposia to highlight their educational and scholarly pursuits. 

 
A Notre Dame postcard will be issued by the post office on Oct. 15.

Cincinnati Bengals running back Stanford Jennings was released yesterday as NFL teams cut their rosters down to the maximum of 47 players. 
Victim wants no part of suit against Tyson 
For others it may be a day 
off-many are cut and brought 
back later in the week after 
teams place players they want 
to keep around on injured 
reserve. 
"It's like playing poker. 
You're trying not to show your 
hand," Denver coach Dan 
Reeves said. "You've got to bluff 
somewhat." 
For still others, it's a tempo­
rary interruption before they're 
signed by another team. Bubba 
Paris, left tackle for the 49ers 
before being cut last week, was 
signed by the Colts on Monday. 
And for rookies, it may he a 
few days in limbo before they 
go to a developmental squad. 
That means they can practice 
hut can't play unless they clear 
waivers again. 
One man· who made it 
against the odds was Terry 
Long, the veteran Pittsburgh 
guard, who underwent psychi­
atric treatment after telling 
police he attempted suicide fol­
lowing a positive test for 
steroids. He rejoined the 
Steelers last Tuesday and will 
begin the season as a backup 
Carlton Haselrig. 
Some veterans who lost their jobs: 
-Manley, who joined the Cards last year after being re­instated by commissioner Paul Tagliabue following a year's suspension for substance abuse. Released by Washington after the suspension, he was the often outsppken hub of the Redskins' defense during the mid '80s and is fifth on the NFL's all-time sack list with 'H. 
-Duerson, who won Super Bowl rings with both the Bears and Giants, was a Pro Bowler with the Bears and was cut by New York. 
-Running back Gerald Riggs, 30 and defensive tackle Darryl Grant, 31, were cut by the Redskins. But coach Joe Gibbs said he hoped to bring hack Riggs if he clears waivers 

-his age, past injury problems 
and a $1 million-plus contract 
are expected to make teams shy 
away from him. 

The rmal cut by the Redskins 
included Grant, the 11-year de­
fensive tackle who was hobbled 
much of the preseason with a 
thigh injury and only returned 
to practice last week. 

-Donald Igwebuike, who 
was accused of heroin smug­
gling last October and found 
innocent in April, was cut by 
the Vikings, meaning Fuad 
Reveiz will he the kicker. The 
Vikings also cut receiver Leo 
Lewis, an 11-year man, and 
running back Darrin Nelson, a 
10-year man who had returned 
after being dispatched in the 
Herschel Walker deal. 

Linebacker Jerry 
Robinson, a 13-year-veteran cut 
by the Raiders. He goes all the 
way hack to the Eagles' 1980 
Super Bowl team 

-Defensive lineman Andre 
Townsend, 29, a part-time 
starter on the Broncos' three 
Supe·r Bowl teams in 1986, 
1987 and 1988. 

-Guard Billy Ard, a starter on the Giants' 1986 Super Bowl team. He was cut by Green Bay, could be reactivated after the roster is set. The Packers also cut Mark Lee, a starting cornerback for the Packers for most of his 12-year career. 
-Eddie Johnson, an 11­year veteran who was once part of one of the NFL's best linehacking corps with the Browns. 
-David Galloway, once the f.ards' best defensive linemen. 
cut by the· Broncos. 

-Disgruntled strong safety Terry Kinard and kick returner Gerald McNeil by the Oilers. 
-Running hack Stanford Jennings of the Bengals, best known for his 93-yard kickoff return for a touchdown that nearly won the 1989 Super Bowl with San Francisco. 
(AP) -Dexter Manley, Dave Duerson and a host of other one-time heroes were sent packing on Monday, the NFL's unkind est day of all. 
The league's 28 teams got down to the 47-player limit by ridding themselves largely oi 
MILLEN, Ga. (AP) -A Miss Black America contestant who says boxer Mike Tyson touched her improperly nonetheless wants no part of a lawsuit against the former heavyweight champ. 
"I don't think a lawsuit is necessary," said Jacqueline Boatwright of Millen, who is among 10 contestants listed as victims in the suit a pageant of­ficial has filed against Tyson. "I think the whole thing is being blown out of proportion." 
The $21 million suit by pageant director J. Morris 
two types -rookies and free agents and veterans who tried to hang on for another season. 
"The toughest decisions I have to make are always with veterans that have contributed to the success we've had in the past," said Miami coach Don 
Anderson accuses Tyson of fondling the 10 women during festivities surrounding the July event in Indianapolis. 
Boatwright said she was not asked before her name was placed in the lawsuit. She said she did not tell Anderson that Tyson had "patted me on my, you know, behind" until two weeks later, when she called him to discuss something else. 
"It was at that time he asked me if Mike Tyson touched me, and I told him he did," she said. "I discovered my name was on Shula, who cut linebacker Barry Krauss and cornerback Paul Lankford, who combined for 22 years of NFL experience. 
For some like Manley, trying to come back from a drug sus­pension, it could be the end of a career. 
the lawsuit after the London Times called me about it a week after" the phone conversation. 
Tyson, who was recruited by pageant officials to be part of the festivities, has become em­broiled in controversy over his 
behavior there. 

An Indianapolis grand jury reportedly is considering an 18­year-old contestant's allegation that Tyson raped her. And a former Miss Black America sued him for $100 million in federal court in New York ear­lier this month.

Spartans gunning for Rose Bowl 
A's perilously close to 

EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -Bill Johnson has seen only good times as a defensive end at Michigan State. 
Winning seasons capped by bowl games every year, two first-place finishes in the Big Ten and a Rose Bowl appear­ance. 
But the fifth-year senior wants more. And so do the other five Spartans who played on the 1988 Rose Bowl team. 
"We talked about it a little bit yesterday. It would be nice to end a five-year career with a national championship. That's not to say us six are going to take us there. If anybody wants it probably more than anybody else, I would say it's us, I guess," he said. 
Speedy flanker Courtney Hawkins was still a senior in high school when the Spartans made their last Rose Bowl ap­pearance, but his goal is the same as Johnson's. 
"We have a national cham­pionship and a Big Ten cham­pionship in our sights. That's what we strive for. We'll see how close we can get to it," he said. 
Never mind that the other Big Ten school in the state gets most of the nods for the con­ference championship and na­tional crown. 
"That's preseason. All the games still got to be won be­tween the lines," said Hawkins. 
Coach George Perles expects this year's squad to be as solid as last year's, with its 8-3-1 record and John Hancock Bowl 
.
.... victory. "We look for a consistent program. We look to be in the race every year. We don't look for peaks and valleys," Perles said. He brushes aside talk about preseason favorites. "I have nothing to do with these ratings. I don't know why people are rated where they are. It's just kind of a guess that someone does and everybody follows. It's not a big deal," he said. As far as Perles is con­cerned, Michigan State already has earned its right to be counted among the nation's elite football powers. 
$1 million donation earmarked to build new baseball field 
Observer Staff Report 
Franklin E. Eck, a member of the Notre Dame Class of 1944, along with Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc., have made a $1 million gift to the university for construction of a new baseball stadium. 
The new facility will be named Frank E. Eck Stadium and will feature a lighted grass playing field and a permanent capacity 
"I don't think there's another level. I think we're at the level we want to be at. We've had great success at this level," he said. 
The Spartans lost seven starters each on offense and defense from the team that shared the Big Ten champi­onship last year with three other teams. 
Perles believes this year's team can improve on that record. 
Last year's leader, quarter­back Dan Enos, is gone. Finding a replacement will be at the top of Perles' list during fall practice. 
None of the four prospects is a favorite yet. Perles will an­nounce his choice Sept. 8, the Sunday before Michigan State opens its season with Central Michigan. 
"We're looking for someone that's being rushed and can improvise, get out of trouble, take a broken play and make a winning play out of it," Perles said. 
The most experienced quar­terback prospect is UCLA transfer Bret Johnson. As a Bruin, he started all 11 games in 1989, completing 57.5 per­cent of his passes for 1, 791 yards and 12 touchdowns. 
But Johnson's real strength is making something out of nothing. 
"That's what I think, a good quality in a quarterback is to be able to make something happen when there's nothing else there," he said. 
Enos' backup, Jim Miller, played for brief stints in just four games last year. Also fighting for the job will be John Gieselman, who did not see any game action last year, and Millard Coleman, a redshirt freshman. 
Whoever lands the starting job will stand behind an offen­sive line that averages 300 pounds. 
With Hawkins and tailback Tico Duckett returning, Perles has the nucleus of an offense that can take advantage of 
The Obeerver/John Cluver One of the pressing questions at Michigan State this fall is who will replace last year's starting quarterback, Dan Enos. 

falling out of West race 
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) ­When figuring out if they are still alive in the AL West, the Athletics prefer psychology to math. 
"We've fought through a lot of things all year, and we have to show our character again," says reliever Gene Nelson. 
"We have to first realize we_ are still in this and take advan­tage of the games against Minnesota when they lose," says Dave Stewart, the four­time 20-game winner still look­ing for his lOth victory this season. 
But in a purely mathematical sense, the numbers don't look good for Oakland to win a fourth straight AL pennant. With 36 games left, they trail the Minnesota Twins by seven. If the Twins slack off and play just .500 the rest of the way, the A's need to go 25-11 just to tie. 
No matter what happens, the A's need to start winning when the Twins lose. While the Twins lost two of three in Baltimore, they still gained a game on the A's, who were swept by the Milwaukee Brewers over the weekend. 
"That's damaging," said Jose Canseco. "We could have gained two games. It's over with, and we can't look back. We just have to keep going forward." 
Oakland manager Tony La Russa knows his math well. 
"The reason it's so impor­i.auL to win your owu games is because the top team will lose a game or so," said La Russa. "It doesn't matter if you lose and Minnesota loses. You have

gained nothing. You have to win your own games." 
Just when the A's looked on 
the verge of dropping out of 
sight after a seven-game losing 
streak, they won four in a row, 
including a three-game sweep 
of the Angels. Nothing turns 
the momentum back around 
quicker than being outscored 
28-6 in three home games by a 
sub-.500 team from the AL 
East. 

"I don't like winning a series, then losing one; that doesn't make it," said La Russa. 
Ron Darling helped pump life into the ragged Jlls starting rotation, going 3-0 with a 1.69 ERA in his first four starts after the July 31 trade with Montreal. But even he's been proven human now, after allowing seven runs and 13 hits to the Brewers in an 8-2 loss Sunday. 
"You can't keep playing good one series and bad the next," said Darling. "The rea­son we lost this series was our pitching. The reason we swept the Angels was our pitching. That's the bottom line. 
"We know we can play well, and we know we can play poorly. We'd like to start working on eliminating the lat­ter." 
The Jlls are in the middle of their longest homestand of the season-12 games-but the bats stayed on the road. They've scored only 13 runs in six games . 
.Mark ivit:\;wire may souu ve headed for platoon status. The perennial All-Star first base­man is batting .202 overall and only .166 at home.

Key's 1OOth victory keeps Jays in hunt 
BALTIMORE (AP) -Jimmy Key fmally won his lOOth game and the Blue Jays retained at least a share of frrst place in the AL East by beating the Orioles 5-2. 
Devon White homered for Toronto, which entered the game in a first-place tie with Detroit. 
Key (13-9) allowed seven hits and two runs in six innings, walking one and striking out two. The 30-year-old left-ban­der snapped a three-game los­ing streak and joined Dave Stieb and Jim Clancy as the only Blue Jays to win 100 games. 
Mike Timlin fanned five in two innings and Tom Henke worked the ninth to get his 30th save. Dave Johnson (4-5) was the loser. 
"TWins 5, Indians 3 
CLEVELAND -Kevin Tapani 
Erickson coming to earth in second half of season 
BALTIMORE (AP) -Maybe won his seventh straight decision and the Twins hit three home runs as they remained perfect against the Indians. 
Shane Mack, Brian Harper and Kirby Puckett all homered for Minnesota, which is 8-0 against the Indians this season. Cleveland helped the Twins during the weekend by sweep­ing a three-game series from the second-place White Sox. 
Tapani (12-7) allowed two runs and six hits in eight in­nings, improving to 10-1 in his last 16 starts. Rick Aguilera pitched the ninth for his 34th save. 
Dave Otto (1-4) gave up five runs and 10 hits in eight in­nings. 
Rangers 10, Yankees 2 
NEW YORK Rafael Palmeiro, Kevin Reimer, Gena Petralli and Julio Franco hit home runs, powering the Rangers past the Yankees. 
Texas won for the fourth time in five games. New York has lost four of five. 
Kevin Brown (9-10) pitched eight innings and gave up two runs on five hits. Franco hit an RBI single in the third inning and Palmeiro followed with his 22nd homer of the season off Eric Plunk (2-3). Petralli hit a three-run drive in the sixth, his first 'home run since June 20, 1989. 

Padres 7, Pirates 5 
PITTSBURGH Tony Gwynn's two-run homer off Bob Kipper won the game in the lOth inning after Jack Howell's two-out pinch single tied it in the ninth as the Padres beat the Pirates 7-5 Monday night. 
Gwynn's homer, his fourth, followed Tony Fernandez's one­out single off Bill Landrum (1­4). Kipper then replaced Landrum and promptly allowed his sixth homer in 50 2-3 in­nings. 
The Pirates were within one out of winning it in the ninth, when Landrum, who entered with one out and none on, al­lowed Howell's run-scoring single. 
Craig Lefferts (1-5) pitched the final two innings for his frrst victory since Sept. 15, 1990. 
with Scott Erickson. 
Perhaps it's just no one re­members he's only in his third pro season, the frrst full one in the major leagues. 
Erickson was arguably the best pitcher in baseball during the firSt half of the season. With a 12-3 record and a 1.83 ERA, the Minnesota Twins' right­hander would have started the All-Star Game if he didn't strain his right elbow in late June. 
Erickson, 23, was put on the disabled list. In his nine starts since his return on July 15, he's gone 4-3 with a 7.49 ERA. The latest disaster was Sunday, when he gave up six earned runs in 4 1-3 innings of a 7-3 loss to the Baltimore Orioles. 
What happened? 
The elbow was a factor in the early going, but Erickson no longer will use it as an excuse. 
"It took awhile for me to get the arm strength back, but it's been all right the last two starts," he said. 
And then? 
"I've just been making some bad pitches," he said. "Those aren't the pitches I can afford to m~ke if I intend to win some gam&S." 
That much is obvious. But teammate Jack Morris, who's got 14 years of major league experience, said there's nothing wrong with Erickson that vir­tually every major leaguer hasn't experienced. 
"It happens to all of us. You can't be perfect every time out," Morris said. "The main thing is you've got to overcome it. Adversity is part of baseball -for everybody." 
It is the first time that Erickson has been in such a si­tuation. He went 8-4 in 19 games in the latter part of last 
.. season and started brilliantly this year. Then came the elbow injury. And then, trouble. 
A 5.49 ERA in July. Three losses in five starts in August. His current 3.22 ERA is the highest it's been all year, and he hasn't pitched more than seven innings in one game in over a month.

Men's cross country ranked 5th 
Two All-Americans return from last year's third-place team 
Notre Dame coach Joe Piane expects the freshmen to con­tribute to the success of this year's team, but the returning runners will be the heart of the team. 
Senior captain Pat Kearns placed in the top 10 in every meet going into districts last year and recorded a firSt-place fmish in the 1990 MCC champi­onships. He will be a consistent runner that the team can de­pend on throughout the season. 
Junior John Coyle returns after a successful season in which his All-American perfor­mance helped Notre Dame fin­ish third in the nation last year. He also won the American World trials and competed in world championships. 
Sophomore Mike McWilliams also had an All-American sea­son in his freshman year. Finishing 34th in the NCAA championships, he was the number two runner for Notre Dame during the NCAA cham­pionships. 
McWilliams also should emerge as a team leader this year, and according to Piane, should be "someone to be reck­oned with" this season. 
Angels ax Rader, replace him with Buck Rodgers 

By JENNIFER MARTEN Sports Writer 
Ranked fifth nationally in the preseason, the Notre Dame men's cross country team is looking forward to another successful season. Despite los­ing two of their top runners to graduation, the Irish return with a solid squad and a promising group of freshmen. 
ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) ­The Angels, who fell from first place to last in the AL West in a month, fired manager Doug Rader and replaced him with Buck Rodgers. 
Rodgers, ftred as manager by the Montreal Expos on June 2, signed a three-year contract on Monday to take over a team that has failed to win a division title under Rader despite the acquisition of such stars as Dave Winfield, Mark Langston and Gary Gaetti. 
The Angels moved into firSt place by one percentage point over the Twins with a 44-33 record on July 3, but then lost 19 of their next 27 games to fall into last place on Aug. 4 with a 52-52 record. 
California has been in last place since, with a low point coming last Thursday when a 2-1 loss to Oakland put them 15 games behind the Twins. 
Rader, under contract through the 1992 season, was let go despite the Angels' three-game sweep of the Red Sox that left them 13 games behind Minnesota entering Monday night's game against the Tigers. 

The 4 7 -year-old Rader is the seventh manager to be fired this season, while Rodgers is the first of the group to be rehired.Other managers fired this season were the Indians' John McNamara, Don Zimmer of the Cubs, Nick Leyva of Phillies, John Wathan of the Royals and Frank Robinson of the Orioles. 
The Angels won eight of their final 13 games under Rader but it was their inability to beat the three­time division champion Athletics, who won 12 of 13 games against California. 
Rader previously managed the Rangers from 1983-85 ­he was fired early in the 1985 season after the Rangers lost 23 of their ftrst 32 games. His overall record as a manager is 388-417. 
Rodgers' overall record as Montreal's manager was 520­
499. He was in the final year of a contract that paid him about $500,000. 
Replaced by Tom Runnells in Montreal, Rodgers was the most successful manager in Expos history. His overall record as a manager is 644­601.

New coach takes reins at Saint Mary's 
By JENNIFER MARTEN 
Sports Writer 
Julie Schroeder-Biek has returned to Saint Mary's to coach a volleyball team that she used to play on. 
Schroeder-Biek has been the assistant coach for the last two years at Saint Mary's. She in­herilc; a team that was ranked in the top ton of tho Division III statistics for kill average, assist average, and block average throughout last season. 
~As a former player at Saint Mary's, I know how good our program really is, and am ex­cited about tho opportunity to take over and to continue to 
Julie Schroeder·Biek 
build the program that former head coach, Sue Medley, devel­oped," said Schroedor-Biek. 
The Belles face a very competitive schedule, but return a strong team and also had a good recruiting year. There is a strong possibility that this team could receive a post­season bid. 
Returning for the Belles are two leaders on the team. Karen Lorton, a junior middle blocker from South Bend, led the team in kills, serve percentage, hit­ting, and assists last year. 
Michelle Martino is a sopho­more setter from Illinois who was ranked tenth in the nation in assists for Division III. 
Both players should be valu­able assets to the new coach as she takes over the helm. 
Agassi knocked out in straight sets at Open 
NEW YOHK (AP) -Finalist one year, first-round flop the next, Andre Agassi spun out of control and away from the U.S. Open, the victim of another stunning ambush. 
Aaron Krickstein, Agassi's tormenter on Monday, dis­played none of the power and little of the precision that Pete Sampras showed in beating Agassi for the championship last year and winning his first match this year. 
Sampras turned his blazing servos and pinpoint control this time in the direction of Christo van Hensburg to win 6-0, 6-3, 6-2. So overwhelming was Sampras at the start that the crowd roared when Rensburg raised his arms in triumph after finally winning the lOth game of the match. 
Krickstein didn't need to be that good against a player who self-destructed in the heat and glare of the stadium court. It was only the second match of the tournament, less than four hours had passed since the first ball was struck, and one of the glamorous names in the game suddenly was gone in straight sets, 7-5, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2. 
Krickstein's upset overshad­owed the usual verbal battle John McEnroe waged with an umpire during a 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 victory over Glenn Layendecker and Michael Chang's easy 6-3, 6-0, 6-2 win against Mark Woodforde. Two other men's seeds lost: No. 13 Andrei Cherkasov 7-6 (7-2), 6-2, 6-2 to Jonas Svensson, and No. 15 Petr Korda 6-1, 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 to Arnaud Boetsch. 
The top women seeds also had little problem winning. No. 1 Steffi Graf beat Andrea Temesvari 6-1, 6-2 in 50 min­utes; No. 2 Monica Soles beat Nicole Arendt 6-2, 6-0; No. 3 Gabriela Sabatini beat Nicole Provis 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 and No. 7 Jennifer Capriati dumped Eva Pfaff 6-1, 6-0 in 39 minutes. 
Krickstein kept the ·ball deep in the first set and close enough to the sidelines to prevent Agassi from attacking. Agassi tried powering balls from the baseline, but his accuracy was off and he sprayed shots wide and deep. 
~Nothing seemed to be going my way," lamented Agassi, who wound up with 55 unforced er­rors and six double faults, compared to Krickstein's 28 unforced errors and one double fault. "He was hitting the lines and big winners. Sometimes it seems you have to overcome so much to get through it." 
The crowd that had cheered Agassi so much last year switched allegiance early and whistled for Krickstein as it sensed an upset in the making.

Brown took over the program in December after resigning as an assistant coach with the U.S. national squad. Before that, she 
coached for six years at Arizona State, taking the Wildcats to the NCAAs in five of those seasons, and she antici­pates similar results with the Irish. 
"I definitely believe that we have the capability to make the NCAAs," Brown said. "We talked with the team about that being a goal that we would like to strive for, to put ourselves into position to make ~he tour­nament, and even though it's early, from what I've seen so far, I believe it's a realistic goal." 
Notre Dame's inexperience plagued it throughout the 1990 season, but with the team los­ing only three members from that 9-27 squad, Brown has veterans at every position to choose from.

Women's soccer has high hopes 
Jenkins' injury only damper on Petrucelli's optimism 
By RENE FERRAN Associate Sports Editor 
Is three years enough time to build a playoff caliber pro­gram? 
Notre Dame women's soccer coach Chris Petrucelli hopes so. 
Building on last season's 16­3-1 performance and landing an NCAA berth are among the team's goals for the 1991 sea­son to begin September 7th at home against Mercyhurst. 
"We may be a year or two away, but it's definitely some­thing we're keeping in the back of our minds," Petrucelli said. "We have a very good group of returning players and a tal­ented group of freshmen, and I think we're looking forward to start playing some games and seeing how we stack up against other teams." 
Men 
continued from page 28 
Goalkeeping was also a prob­lem for the Irish last year, but one which they are confident of overcoming. 
"We weren't as solid as we would have liked to have been, but it's not the fault of particu­larly anyone," stated Berticelli. "Pete Gulli stepped into a start­ing role with no Division I ex­perience, and Matt Fitz was a walk-on. We really didn't have as much time to prepare as we'd have liked to have. We've got five goalkeepers working out in pre-season, and they're all showing very, very positive signs and being very competi­tive. Whoever starts will have to earn the spot." 
MIDFIELD. The key to any successful season, Notre Dame must find more ways to pro­duce scoring opportunities. "We have to be a bit more cre­ative and skillful than we have been in the midfield," observed Berticelli. "We have lots of 
freshmen here, though, and one 

player-Mike Pahner of r------------,-----------­
South Bend-has had a great 
spring and tremendous pre­season. Palmer does a great job and he has a tremendous work ethic, so things look good for us." 
ATTACK. Scoring opportu­nities were infrem1entlv trans-


Macleod 
continued from page 28 
"I'll put our schedule up against anybody's in the na­tion," said MacLeod. "We play the best teams in many confer­ences around the country. It makes for a good level of com-
vision exposure in five major  
markets, (Philadelphia, New 
York, Los Angeles, Chicago, 
and Texas)." 
When asked about his deci­
'" 
sion to come to Notre Dame, he 
explains that this is a unique 
opportunity for any coach. 
"I love the atmosphere here," declared MacLeod. "There is great tradition here, and this is a great environment for college students. I believe we can become a basketball power­house. This will not happen overnight; it will be a slow process. 
"I never say 'x' number of wins, but we are going to work hardr have fun and learn to win." 

Chris Petrucelli 
With only two seniors lost from last year's MCC champi­ons, a strong nucleus returns to the program. The top five goal scorers from last season are back, including sophomores Alison Lester (15 goals) and Stephanie Porter (10) and se­nior Susie Zilvitis (10). Junior goalkeeper Michelle Lodyga 
(0.79 goals against average, 11 shutouts) also returns. 

An injury to junior defender Shannon Jenkins, however, threatens to dampen Petru­celli's optimism. Jenkins, a two­year starter in the Irish back­field, anchors the defense, and her probable replacement, freshman Jill Matesic, while showing promise in the fall, will not fill the void completely. 
"Shannon's had a knee prob­lem since April," Petrucelli said. "We were hoping she'd be back and ready to go by now, but she's still struggling with it. She's defmitely somebody we'll miss." 
In an attempt to bolster its NCAA chances, gone from the Notre Dame schedule are the likes of St. Joseph's, Indiana­South Bend, and Calvin College. In their place, the Irish travel to Vanderbilt, William & Mary, and Providence. 
"I think we're very positive heading into the season," Petrucelli said. 
lated into scores last season. "This job will probably fall to Kevin Pendergast (33 shots, 7 goals, 4 assists, 1 winner in 1990). He's had a very good pre-season. The rest of the scoring will probably come from our new players, or someone that did not score much last year will have to rise to the occasion." 
If it sounds like Notre Dame is hard at work on every facet of its game, it's because that is exactly the case. Berticelli will go to any lengths to reverse last season's unlucky rmish. 
"Last year, we lost seven games that we could have won just as easily," ruminated the second-year coach. "It wasn't a disastrous season, it was un­lucky. But I believe that you make your own luck, and we didn't make it at times like we should have. 
"I think about last season ev­ery day because I learned a lot from it. I learned that you can't always fix everything that's wrong with a team, and also that it takes time to fix any­thing. I guess that I was hum­bled by the game."
