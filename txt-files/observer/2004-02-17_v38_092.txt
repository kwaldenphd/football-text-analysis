INSIDE COLUMN 
How true it is 
I am sitting on a Transpo bus. It's pretty early in the morning, and many people around me are headed to work. I am chatting with a young man sitting next to me, discussing the 
3000 page anthol­ 
ogy I have with  Katie Knorr  
me and the insane  
amount of writing  
involved with  Illustrator  
being an English  
major. All of a  

sudden, tbe woman sitting across from me leaps into the conversation. I hadn't even realized she was listen­ing. 
"You gonna get a job?" she asks me. "Well," I reply, "the job market isn't that good right now." ThiS lights a spark, I can tell right away. She immediately launches into a speech that lasts the rest of the ride home. She explains her view that education is pointless in today's economy because there aren't any jobs to be found anyway. She tells me that Notre Dame has billions of dollars saved for use on expansion, yet other people struggle to earn enough money to live on. I listen, silent, nodding and giving vague little smiles, as she talks and talks. 
I am beginning to feel terrible. She is forcing me to listen to an account of the kind of life I prefer to forget exists, the kind of life I have been lucky enough never to experience. She gives a story of a woman she knows, a mother with seven children, who barely has enough money to feed and clothe them all. I feel worse and worse as she goes on. Please stop, I think. I can't even imagine not having enough money to live on. That fear has never even crossed my mind. 
The bus pulls into Library Circle. I am almost guilty that this is my stop. I wonder what the woman is thinking, seeing me get off here. This feeling doesn't go away easily. I carry it around all day. 
Later, I am in class listening to a lecture by a retired police officer whose life had been turned around by volunteer service. His talk is like ice on a burning wound. I listen to him tell stories about himself and people he's worked with. He has come to Notre Dame to speak because here, people have the education and the opportunity to reach out to others. At Notre Dame, we are given the means to make a difference. 
He was the voice telling me that one hurting soul is painful for the whole community, and that it is up to the community to heal itself. He was the voice telling me that we can't get any­where by ourselves, and that most of the people who help us along the way are not as fortunate as we are. He was the voice telling me that it is not so much what you do as what you give, and that giving care allows for others to start caring about them­selves. 
He ended his talk by saying that even though people cause challenges, people are also the ones to solve them. And I couldn't help but think how true that is.

"That's a new fad, like tongue piercing, and once it's done it's permanent, you can't sew it back together," said Staton. "We have some health issues that are associated with it."

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE Co-sponsorship for activities debated 
By NICOLE ZOOK 
News Writer 
Board of Governance officers discussed co-sponsorship of cam­pus activities during Monday's meeting, as all campus activities, groups or clubs must present their plans to the board to receive co­sponsorship. 
First year class president Claudia Toth presented a proposal for a battle of the bands between Saint Mary's, Notre Dame and Holy Cross College. 
"There won't be too many costs, considering we don't have to pay for the venue or the bands," Toth said. "Money will go towards tech­nicians and publicity." 
The event, tentatively scheduled for March 26, will be produced by the Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross classes of 2007 and funded by all three schools. Notre Dame will most likely be in charge of finding bands, while Saint Mary's will handle catering. 
Also discussed was a co-spon­sorship of a Grassroots Organization Weekend [GRO] March 19-21. The weekend con­ference, put on by the Student Academic Council [SAC] and Peacemal..ers, is intended to allow students to better understand social injustices. 
SAC requested $1,500 from BOG · in order to keep the event free for all students who wish to attend. 
Both co-sponsorships were approved. Toth 's proposal, howev­er, was not allotted a specific amount of money. 
Treasurer Kym Dunlap reported that there is currently $11,000 in the co-sponsorship account. The members of the board agreed the funds should be wisely allocated. 
In other BOG news:

Campaigning for next year's class boards will begin Thursday. Meet the Candidates Night will be held on Monday, where candidates from each class will have one hour, beginning with the class of 2007 at 7 p.m. Elections will be held Feb. 24.

CAMPUS LIFE COUNCIL 
Regular meeting canceled 
Informal discussion focuses on Observer 
Viewpoint section 
By ANDREW THAGARD 
Associate News Editor 
A lack of sufficient voting members prohibited the Council of Representatives from holding an official meeting yesterday after­noon, but the 14 members in attendance informally discussed their concerns about viewpoint letters and columns in The Observer regarding affirmative action. 
The issue was brought to the forefront at the last CLC meeting and again at Wednesday's student senate meeting, when representa­tives from the Diversity Council criticized The Observer for its decision to run a column against affir­mative action that was accompanied by an illustra­tion of Martin Luther King, Jr. The group had presented a letter to both student sen­ate and -The Observer mak­ing specific demands of the student newspaper and pro­posing the implementation of a required semester-long course on diversity aware­ness for all undergraduate students. 
Leah McGee, CLC's repre­sentative from the Diversity Council, briefed members on a Friday meeting that she and other student gov­ernment representatives had with Andrew Soukup, editor in chief of The Observer. 
"We ran down some of the issues we [the Diversity Council] presented in Senate ... We went back and forth for a while, but no real agreement was reached," she said. 
Some members criticized The Observer for refusing to take action for what they perceived to be poor deci­sion-making in its editorial practices. 
"I think they should take responsibility for their actions and at least write a letter of apology to the Diversity Council," said Emily Chin, student body vice president and a mem­ber of CLC. 
-Other members, including Wyatt Maxwell, suggested that the letters and editori­als were more a reflection of the opinions of the Notre Dame community than the attitude of the newspaper. 
Charlie Ebersol, however, said the .columns and letters printed seemed to suggest a conservative bias held by the editorial board. 
"The Observer this year is radically conservative." he 

said. 
Still, Ebersol recommend­ed that the Diversity Council show caution in the actions it takes on the issue. 
"They [The Observer] are not a student organization ... I don't agree with what they did [but] beyond this point I don't think we can expect anything from The Observer," he said. "Ignoring this is better than letting it get fanned." 
McGee thanked CLC for its advice and support and said that the Diversity Council is continuing to explore possi­ble ways of responding, though she declined to give details. 
In other CLC news: 
Chin updated the council on the work of the commit­tee studying transportation options for students with temporary disabilities. She said the committee spoke with Scott Howland, pro­gram coordinator of the Office for Students with Disabilities, and that the office would assist tem­porarily disabled students in renting motorized scoot­ers. She also said the University would reimburse students for the expense of the rentals. The new policy should take effect in the fall semester.

"I think my presence at the Senate meeting would be helpful. since they'll most likely be talking about prob­lems with the election, and I've just gone through it too," Istvan said. "I think this is an issue that needs to be

"It'll be a lot harder without his help, and we'd really appreciate it, but even if he chooses to follow up on some other interests, I will still look into it," said Istvan. 
Istvan also said that they plan on looking into expand­ing the student section for next year's basketball sea­son, but how fervently they pursue it will depend on stu­dent interest and the per-was the contrast between the constitutional text cited in affir­mative action Supreme Court cases, such as Gratz v.

While Lewis explained his own opposition to affirmative action on the grounds of consti­tutional principles, claiming that racial preference in admis­sions policies does not meet the "compelling government inter­est" requirement for legal justi­fication, other panel members criticized his abstract approach.

"If you circulate an applica­tion and your name is Kylie or Shenika, you are 50 percent less .Lely to get a call back than Todd Smith because they assume you're black," Tillery said in reference to a Harvard study. "African Americans share more experiences than you realize."

Pierce ques­tioned how and when the point of equality would be determined. 
"If you support affirmative action, I would pose the question, how 
long should it exist?" he asked. "What are you going to mark as the signifiers of when it should end?" 
Saracino said that Notre Dame chooses to avoid such concretQ deadlines, focusing instead on consistent progress toward a more diverse student body. 
"Affirmative action is not quotas. Affirmative action is saying these are goals -and goals are laudable," he said. "I think we have a long way to go at Notre Dame in both socioe­conomic and ethnic diversity, but we're making progress ...

It reflects the tension between what was -and how we per­ceive what was -and what is," said Pierce, who was asked to step in for the other two repre­sentatives against affirmative action, both of whom backed out of the debate on Monday afternoon. In the spirit of aca­demic exercise, Pierce departed from his personal views in order to represent those who oppose affirmative action on the grounds of ineffective poli­cy.

JERUSALEM -Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon survived no confidence motions Monday, even though some legislative allies abstained amid deep divisions over his plans to evacuate some Jewish settlements. 
With the cracks showing in his center-right coalition, Sharon appealed for a broad-based government of national consensus. 
The parliament voted against the three motions by 53 to 45 margins, with 22 members either abstaining or not showing up for the ses­sion. The opposition needed 61 of the 120 mem­bers of parliament to topple the government.

As the two countries back down from the brink of their fourth war in 2002, the three­day talks are to lay 'the groundwork for end­ing a half-century of tension since their 194 7 partition. 
"There is realization in India and Pakistan that war is not an option, that you have to look at ways to find a peaceful resolution of the outstanding disputes between the two countries," Pakistani spokesman Masood Khan said after a meeting between Foreign Ministry officials of the two countries.

SAN FRANCISCO -As hundreds of gay and lesbian couples lined up at City Hall for the historic chance to wed with the city's blessing, opponents filed legal papers Monday arguing that only judges can declare California's prohibition on same-sex mar­riages to be unconstitutional. 
In a brief submitted for a court hearing Tuesday, lawyers for one of two groups seek­ing to block the unprecedented wedding march said Mayor Gavin Newsom was in bla­tant violation of state law when he directed the county clerk to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. 
"What the mayor and his cronies have attempted to do is short-circuit the legal process by being both judge and jury them­selves," said Alliance Defense Fund attorney Benjamin Bull. 
Spirit sets personal distance record 
LOS ANGELES -The Spirit rover went for its longest trip yet on the surface of Mars, trav­eling just over 88 feet but stopping short of the distance NASA had hoped it would cover, sci­entists said Monday. 
Engineers had hoped the rover would travel 164 feet on its way to a crater known as "Bonneville" to examine rocks and soil for evi­dence that water may have existed on the Red Planet, mission manager Jim Erickson said. 
"Spirit, she's put some more territory behind her," Erickson said. "We're closer but not as close as we'd wanted to be."

Seat belt, alcohol laws stall in House 
INDIANAPOLIS -A bill that would require people to wear seat belts in pickup trucks and a proposal prohibiting open containers of alcohol in vehicles both stalled in a House committee Monday. 
Representatives on the House Public Policy, Ethics and Veterans Affairs Committee ques­tioned some aspects of the seat belt bill. The open container bill met stronger opposition, with critics saying it amounted to federal government "blackmail." 
The open container law would prohibit open containers of alcohol in vehicles even if the driver is sober, although exceptions would be made for limousine drivers and those with recreational vehicles. A violation would be a Class B misdemeanor carrying a fine of up to $1,000.

Rebel mov.ement spreads inland 
Gunmen kill three police officers in Hinche, now control Artibonite agricultural district 
Associated Press 
GONAIVES -Haiti's rebellion spread to the cen­tral city of Hinche on Monday as rebels and for­mer soldiers killed at least three officers at a police station. President Jean­Bertrand Aristide pleaded for foreign help to stop the bloodshed. 
The rebels descended on the police station in Hinche, about 70 miles northeast of Port-au-Prince, according to a Haitian security official who spoke on condition of anonymity. They killed dis­trict police chief Maxime Jonas, pushed police out of the city and threatened gov­ernment supporters, the official said. 
At least 56 people have died since the rebellion aimed at ousting Aristide exploded Feb. 5 in the city of Gonaives. 
About 50 rebels descend­ed on the police station in Hinche, about 70 miles northwest of Port-au­Prince. They killed district police chief Maxime Jonas, pushed police out of the city and freed prisoners from the jail before burning the station.

Study links breast cancer, antibiotics 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -A study suggests antibiotics might increase the risk of developing breast cancer, but researchers said the data should not stop women from taking the medica­tion. 
Women who took the most antibi­otics -who had more than 25 pre­scriptions, or who took the drugs for at least 501 days -faced double the risk of developing breast cancer over an average of about 17 years, com­pared with women who didn't use the drugs, the study showed. 
The authors said more research is · needed because H could have been the diseases women used antibiotics to treat -rather than the drugs themselves -that increased breast cancer risk. 
Also, since antibiotics are widely used to treat a variety of common infections caused by bacteria, includ­ing strep throat, some pneumonias and many gastrointestinal infections, it may be that women who never took the drugs were unusually healthy and therefore unusually resistant to can­cer, the researchers said. 
"It's very premature for people to stop taking antibiotics when they're needed," said lead author Christine Velicer, a researcher at Group Health Cooperative, a large nonprofit health plan in western Washington. "Antibiotics have a substantial public health benefit." 
The results appear in Wednesday's 
Journal of the American Medical Association and were released Monday. 
The study involved 2,266 women 20 and older who developed invasive breast ca,ncer and who were com­pared with 7,953 women who did not get breast cancer. 
An increased breast cancer risk was found with increasing use of antibiotics, with the greatest increased risk in women who took the drugs for at least 501 days. Even women who had up to 25 prescrip­tions over about 17 years faced an increased risk -about 1.5 times higher than nonusers. 
An increased breast cancer risk was found for all types of antibiotics, including penicillins.

The last resolution addressed the approval of officials nomi­nated by the student body president. Under the revamped constitution, the president may appoint students to fill several positions, including seats on Senate committees. 
The council voted over­whelmingly to grant itself the power to approve such nomi­nations. A proposal to require a three-fourths supermajority for such approvals failed. 
Lao directed members of COR committees on policy and pro­gramming to resume their meetings. The committees are responsible for compiling pro­posed constitutional changes in their respective areas. 
"It's time to get cracking on this," Lao said. "We have 1 1/2 more months to write a consti­tution, and we don't have much right now." 
While a skeleton of the new constitution has been discussed at COR meetings for months, a final version is several weeks away, as council members hammer out the details.

FMB chairman Don Norton said responsibility for approv­ing the budget belongs in the council, which represents all student union organizations. 
"It's the most rational thing that needs to be presented," Norton said.

IN BRIEF 
Source code probe targets Mainsoft 
WASHINGTON -The investigation into the illegal disclosure of blueprints for some ver­sions of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software has turned to a small technology company in Silicon Valley that works closely with Microsoft. 
Self-appointed sleuths eager to solve one of the technology industry's most intriguing mys­teries found references inside files accompa­nying the leaked Windows blueprints indicat­ing Mainsoft Corp. had been working with the computer code before it began circulating on the Internet. 
Microsoft has provided Mainsoft access to parts of its Windows blueprints since at least 1994 under conditions that generally prohibit­ed them from disclosing them to others. Mainsoft helps businesses convert their cus­tomized Windows programs to run on rival operating systems, such as Unix. 
Feds probe Titan overforeign contracts 
SAN DIEGO -Federal regulators are investi­gating whether information-technology firm Titan Corp. made illegal payments to overseas consultants, the company said Friday. 
The probe may affect the security and defense information technology concern's proposed sale to defense giant Lockheed Martin. Titan said in a statement it knows of no unlawful payments and will cooperate with the Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. 
Representatives of the company met recently with the SEC and the U.S. Justice Department about Titan's own internal review of payments to international consultants, the company said. 
Aventis challenges hostile takeover 
PARIS -French pharmaceuticals company Aventis SA launched a court challenge Friday against a hostile bid from rival drug company Sanofi-Synthelabo SA, and denied that its appeal was intended as a delaying tactic. 
An Aventis spokesman said the company had filed an application with the Paris appeals court earlier in the day seeking to overturn the decision by France's market watchdog, the AMF, to clear Sanofi to proceed with its hostile offer.

intriguing, our world has to be at an end. Not to mention Alex Rodriguez ending up in a Yankees uniform, more attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq than any month since October and Janet Jackson's "wardrobe malfunction." And what of this turmoil breaking loose in Haiti? These days, I find myself yearning for a baseball card collection and simple boyish ignorance. 
While it is good that so many issues are being debated, society is more aware and interesting things exist to get us through the South Bend winter, I fear that one very important discus­sion gets lost in the mix. That discus­sion about mental health issues, which are more prevalent on college cam­puses than ever thought before, is one from which we cannot shy away. 
According to studies of the American College Health Association, 39 percent of college students reported feeling so depressed that is was difficult to func­tion during the past year. 9 percent admitted to having contemplated sui­cide and a 1.5 percent had attempted suicide. According to the National Mental Health Association (NMHA) suicide was the second-leading cause of death for college students. 
These are certainly not trivial prob­lems. Applying these studies to the Notre Dame populace would suggest that 3,120 students have been depressed at some point during the past year, 720 have contemplated sui­cide and 120 students have attempted suicide. 
Do you know what your next-door neighbor is dealing with? Have you taken the time to ask your roommate how he or she is handling the stress? Many profess the unity and strength of the Notre Dame family, but I fear many too many of us are not aware of the mental health realities of Notre Dame. 
And suicide and general depression are only the beginning of a long list of mental health issues that plague stu­dents on college campuses across the country. According to the NMHA, more than 19 million American adults live with anxiety disorders. Five to ten mil­lion people have eating disorders, and many more are affected by the likes of OCD, ADD, ADHD, Schizophrenia, and more. 
The harshest reality of such discus­sion is that the picture is worsening as college students are rapidly having more complex mental health problems and developments. This is alarming, but perhaps not very surprising when one looks at the typical daily schedule of the American college student. 
Yet with that trend and while most people can relate to one or more of these issues, whether personally or through friends and family, it is shock­ing how little attention these issues, which affect us in so many real ways, receive. 
As our Notre Dame world turns with heated debates on affirmative action, Viewpoint showdowns on the legitima­cy of the Vagina Monologues and even discussions of my own love, Election 2004, we must not forget the battles and injustices that all those who deal with mental health issues must face. 
We need to begin to ask questions about why so many college students deal with mental health problems. Is this a result of the many pressures and stresses that plague the lives of every student? College life is certainly not very conducive to healthiness, but does it go farther to tear at the mental and social threads that hold together the human person? Awareness will empower us to act more effectively in responding to these problems. 
How can we respond? The Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper, ran a 5-part series on mental health reali­ties at their school. If The Observer were to run such a series in conjunc­tion with the Pl)ychology department, what would it find? Such is one idea, but the possibilities of dialogues, awareness campaigns and other actions are endless. The administra­tion would do wisely to invest in such endeavors. 
For the many out there who are currently suffering from such mental health problems, know that you are not alone and that there is help. Mental health does not define who we are. The Health Services and Counseling Center on-campus offer many services and resources that are open to all of us and are very helpful. 
And for all who know of people suf­fering, the task that lies before us is to be friends, supporters and comforters in these lonely winter days. Community does not come from win­ning football championships, as some alumni would like to believe, or even from gaining national prestige, as the administration might want to believe; rather, community comes from people of different backgrounds and struggles coming together to share in one anoth­er's pain and suffer together. Community comes when we open our eyes to one another and shed the bar­riers that keep us apart and keep so many alone. 
Today, let us commit ourselves to building such a community. The task is daunting, but in the end, I do believe it will save us all.

So, in an effort to curb off campus vio­lence and extend its ubiquity ever more into the lives of its students, NDSP has created a secret taskforce that we will now refer to as TCPD. Put simply, this assembly of butt-kickers makes Safe David Barrett Walk seem, well, sophomoric. 
Rather than knocking the icicles Jigga Geoff off my roof and salt­ing my sidewalk, Turtle Creek chose to serve and protect me by accommo­dating this exciting initiative with open arms and a renovated townhouse. Initially, this raised a few uni-brows, especially those of occupants in adja­cent buildings who feared that the heightened. police presence would impede on their late night partying and fence peeing. However, these fears were soon and subsequently allayed upon reassurance from the officers that they were there to keep the peace, not to meddle in their neighbors' private affairs. Yet it is not in their blood to turn a deaf ear to late-night carousing, especially if that carousing is keeping them up. 
The aforementioned neighbors hap­pen to be friends of.mine, and enjoy, on occasion, a quick wrestle before bed. In no way should this be taken euphemisti­cally. These guys are from the classical Greco-Roman school, and simply like to engage one another in a little gladiator­ial combat before brushing their teeth and washing their face. It is completely harmless, but totally vulnerable to skep­ticism. 
So, a couple of th,em are going at it pretty hard a couple of weeks ago. Epically they sparred. Ankle-locks, oil checks -they barred none. They waged back and forth like this for what seemed like minutes, until their new neighbor finally burst through their door with gun drawn and feet placed. Apparently he mistook the repeated thuds against the wall, coupled with screams of wild indulgence, to be some far more guilty pleasure than the wrestling duel it, in reality, was. Understandable, kind of. He let them off with just a warning, and a request that they keep it down next time. 
My first experience with TCPD, how­ever, came this past Friday, at a time I did not expect it, but in a situation where I desperately needed it. I was walking back from the Bombay Boutique on Edison right around closing time with some completely random girl I met there, when I heard some loud, obnoxious shouting coming from a group of guys behind me. I dismissed the taunts, homophobic in nature, as intended for somebody other than me. 
Seeing that they outnumbered me six to one and, unlike me, were without a female companion, it was not an illogi­cal conclusion. But ignoring them only further riled them up. 
Perhaps these guys were a little dis­appointed with how they knew their night would end. sweaty and uncon­scious from an all-out wrestle romp, and thought that embarrassing the helpless kid up ahead might help ease the pain. Chances are they, like every other male at this school, were high­school multi-sport standouts angry at the world because the inter-hall football season is now over. Let it go, guys. Regardless, they stopped yelling and started running to catch up with us. 
Enter TCPD. 
The benefits of being promoted from NDSP to TCPD are countless. Rather than tooting around campus on a 10­speed in a chinstrap, members of TCPD are each given a Dodge Neon with a recycled Le Sabre engine and a custom blue paint job. Undercover, they are told to remain inconspicuous, which every­body knows is impossible when behind the wheel of such a car. 
Anyway, just as things were about to get really ugly, I spied a blue Neon com­ing our way. Before I knew it, the trig­ger-happy officer was out of his car flashing his piece and saying, "Who got the problem, huh punks?" As he inter­rogated them, I ambled home and 
cooked a pizza, thankful for TCPD's 
intervention in what could have ended 
in my embarrassment. 
I am here today because of TCPD, and 
am forever in their debt. However, there 
still is work to be done. For one, they 
can really help me out by keeping high 
school students out of my parties. I sim­
ply cannot be held liable. Secondly, they 
can rough up the big guy who comes .around every weekend asking first for 
jumper cables and then for some spare 
change. I have reason to believe he does 
not actually need jumper cables. 
I, too, was a skeptic at first, more 
worried about how my life would be 
made worse rather than better by their 
presence here at Turtle Creek. But now, 
I could not be happier with what I have 
seen out of them. They are not simply 
NDSP's sister organization, or some 
Safe Walk spin-off. They are the real 
deal, and we are lucky to have them. 
Just remember that if you want to wres­
tle, you will have to do it quietly, and I 
am sure you will agree with me.

The result of this year's student body presiden­

Not only did it reveal that your political apathy 
is beyond ridiculous, but it also proved you are 
incredibly immature. 
At some point in the last few weeks, I bet many 
of you discovered that Charlie Ebersol drives a 
Hummer. I bet you also heard that he is difficult 
to work with and arrogant, too. But come on, how 
many of you actually know Charlie Ebersol? 
That said, if you thought (and quite a few of you 
did) that throwing your votes behind Ad am Istvan 
and Karla Bell would spite Charlie Ebersol, well, 
guess again. Charlie still has his Hummer. and 
you now have a president-elect with no student 
government experience. 
Notre Dame, you made a mockery of this elec­
tion. 

I hope that come November 2004 you will 
demonstrate more maturity at the polls than you 
did last week. When given another opportunity to 
choose your candidate and cast your vote, I hope 
that more than 50 percent of you take it. . And if maturity somehow escapes you again 
come November, heed this advice: Before you 
enter that voting booth or seal that absentee bal­
lot, consider your options. You have them. If there 
is no candidate who speaks to your cause. who 
represents your ideals and is worthy of your vote, 
then abstain. They put that box on the ballot for a 
reason. 

That said, Notre Dame, I offer you this chal­
lenge in the wake of Istvan vs. Ebersol: Learn 
from your stupidity, grow up and, next time, vote 
like the mature 18-to 23-year-olds that you are 
supposed to be. 

And finally, to Adam and Karla, I wish you the 
best of luck in the year ahead. You are going to 
need it.

Beatlemania gone wild 
Confessions of a modern-day Beatlemaniac 
I can remember my middle school days very well. Like most kids, I was desper­ately seeking my own identity. There were the popular kids, the nerds, the ath­letes ... I was tucked nicely in the middle of these groups, not quite sure where I 
belonged yet. In sixth grade, I remember donning green Converse sneakers and 
listening to Weezer's blue album, thinking that maybe, in 
all my awkwardness, I'd become a post-grunge punk. 
This worked for a little while, but I was still too nerdy, and I played too many sports to fit that role perfectly. I floundered around for a bit among the groups, and then one day my destiny became clear. 
I remember driving home one night in my family's wood­paneled mini-van. My younger siblings were being annoy­ing as usual, so I began to listen to the music my par­ents were playing on the van's tape deck. I'd heard the 

songs many times growing up but had never really lis­
tened to them. As I sat there in the car, before I knew Julie Bender 
what was happening, the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely 
Hearts Club Band album exploded in my head and blew Assistant Scene Editor 
me away. From that moment on, the deal was sealed. I was to be a Beatlemaniac for the rest of my life, only three decades too late. 
Now, I would like to say I was a Beatie fan of the standard, respectable variety. Someone who appreciated the band's music and influence on culture and society, but who also maintained a normal lifestyle while doing so. Normal, however, will never be a word associated with what I became after first hearing Sgt. Pepper. Perhaps it was my desperation of seeking some sort of sixth grade identity, but things quickly spiraled into a rock 'n' roll obsession that haunts me to this day. I began buying all the Beatie albums I could afford with my meager weekly 
l 
! allowance. I checked out every single Beatle-related book in my local library. I began making Beatie mixed tapes off the radio from the Oldies station, and I started a scrapbook of every Beatie photo or article I found in the newspaper. And this was only the beginning. My Beatles obsession spread to the clothing I wore, to the Scouse accent I 
adopted ... it even infiltrated my schoolwork. I can remember interpreting Beatie 
lyrics for my English classes and giving presentations on the life of John Lennon. I had my school band play "Yellow Submarine" for a concert. After school each day, I'd put on a Beatles album and play air guitar until dinnertime. Looking back, perhaps the strangest and most embarrassing aspect of my Beatie obses­
sion was that I actually used to bake cupcakes on the Beatles' birthdays. John, Paul, George and Ringo each had baked goods made in their honor, which I would bring to school and pass out at my locker. I can only imagine what my teachers must have thought. 
If an identity was what I was seeking, I had certainly found one. By seventh grade I was well known around school as a Beatlefreak, and I didn't care. Even if I lacked all elements of middle school coolness, I loved the Beatles and I loved rock 'n' roll. That's all that mattered to me. 
I think it was when I baked cupcakes for Paul McCartney's birthday and neg­lected my own father's birthday a few days later that my parents realized maybe things were getting out of control. They sat me down and told me that the Beatles were well and good, but perhaps I should try and explore some other interests. I, of course, defended my Beatie obsession by stating that I couldn't help it that the Beatles were so amazing. Besides, I did have other emerging interests. My love of the Beatles was leading me to discover other great artists like Bob Dylan and The Rolling Stones. 
No~ that I am in college, I can look back on my middle school days and smile, knowmg I have matured somewhat in the past eight years. My after-school air guitar has turned into a real guitar, which I play any spare chance I can, much to 
~h~ dismay of my napping roommate. My music collection has a bit more variety 1~ It now, and I no longer resort to baked good for Beatie birthdays. (My apolo­gies to those who were excited that George's birthday is only a week away.) 
Despite this slight maturing, however, my love for the Beaties has remained in ~act. In fact: just last semester a life-long dream of mine carne true. While study­mg abroad m France, I was able to make the pilgrimage to my personal rock 'n' roll Mecca: Liverpool. I took the Chunnel to the motherland of my favorite mop tops and, with a very patient friend in tow, was able to ride on a Magical Mystery Tour Bus all around the hometown of those loveable lads. 
Although Liverpool might not get as many pages in a tourism book as London or Paris, for me it was the greatest sight my eyes had seen. Not only was it incredible to see the houses, schools and parks where the lads grew up, but to be in the company of other Beatiemaniacs was a homecoming experience in itself. 
The atmosphere on the bus was all Beatie, from the music playing to the chat­ter among the bus riders to the trivia questions of our tour guide. Riding that Magical Mystery Tour bus, I thought I'd died and gone to rock 'n' roll heaven. 
Now that I'm back to reality at school, I can only play my guitar, hum Beatie tunes and daydream wistfully cf my time in Liverpool. At least I now know that it's okay to love the Beatles as much as I do; I'm not alone in my obsession. 
Even 40 years after their music hit American shores, it is never too late to be a Beatlernaniac.

The jowly Sullivan. who had been hyping the Beatles for weeks, announced, "Ladies and gentle­men, the Beatles! Let's bring them on!" Before he could even finish his sentence, the roar of fans in the audience drowned him out. Their screaming, their tears and their uncontrollable passion filled the next eight min­utes, shocking both Sullivan and the Beatles, neither of which had imagined the uproar and pande­monium the band was capable of creating. The Beatles tore through three quick numbers, "All My Loving," "Till There Was You" and ''She Loves You" before exiting tl,e stage for the other acts of thl! night. The audience, however, remained itching for their encore performance of "I Saw Her Standing There" and "I Want to IIold Your Hand." 
No one had ever seen anything like it, including the Beatles. In later interviews, Lennon is reported as saying of Americans, "They're wild, they're all wild. They just all seem out of their minds. I've never seen anything

lgo today  or I at least,.this 111onth 
ary ofthe Beatles 'arrival in America an event that changed the world 

As wild as the fans were, those watching on television got to both see and hear the full show, and to them, the Beatles were the wild ones. Their mop-top hair, their cocky poses, their loud music -it was new and shocking. Young people loved it, old people were startled by it, and everybody had an opinion about it. 
Sister Susan Dunn, the rector of Lyons Hall, remembers well the Beatles' first Ed Sullivan appearance. "I was a junior in high school," Dunn said. "Their little heads were bopping up and down on the television. It was very bold." 
Notre Dame Classics professor Catherine Schlegel, who was only eight years old at the time of the Beatles' Ed Sullivan appear­ance, also remembers the show vividly. 
"It was the high point of my young life," she said. "I was totally blown away by them." Schlegel also remembers the response her mother had to the scruffY mop tops. 
"She said 'I give them three months ­they'll fade out like the Singing Nun did." 
Lucky for Beatie fans everywhere, Schlegel's mother was proven wrong. 
Almost overnight, the Beatles became a household name, and by April of that year, they had the top five songs in the country. With their quick wit and cheeky humor, the BE;latles charmed the American press and soon their hair, their clothes, their speech and their music were a ubiqui­tous presence in the United States. As the Beatles set out on their two-week tour after their first Ed Sullivan performance, most Americans, like Schlegel's mother, thought they were just a passing craze. Little did they know that this band would be the major cultural influence for the next decade and would continue to be a rele­vant force in music even 40 years after their first landing in the U.S. 
For the next two years, the Beatles toured in the maddening tornado of Beatlemania, running 
from hotel to plane to bus in attempts to escape their crazed fans. It wasn't until their 1966 Candlestick Park performance in San Francisco, Calif.. when the Beatles fmally decided that touring was no longer a real possibility for them. Their music was becoming too advanced for onstage reproduction, and the con­stant audience screaming made touring more of a burden than a pleasure. 
Solely a studio band from 1966 until their break up in 1970, the Beatles made some of the best music in rock 'n' roll. Every album was totally different, with songs only of the highest quality. The Beatles opened the doors to experimental sounds with Revolver. They single-handedly started the psychedelic movement with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club. Their so­called "White Album" was a fantastic col­lage of four men slowly heading their sepa­rate ways. 

And, in 1970, they did just that. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr were officially over as a band, but not before they had changed the 
course of modern music forever. Their influence was so great that, even 34 years after their break up, they are still win­ning grammy awards and influencing new musi­cians at every turn. 
Even fans who weren't there to wit­ness the Beatles on Ed Sullivan still owe a debt of gratitude to those four loveable mop tops. To thank the Beatlcs personally is, of course. impossible, but at least fans can resort to the old sing-a­long of the 

Beatles fan club, "We love you Beatles, oh yes we do. We love you Beatles, and we'll be true. If you're not near us, we're blue. Oh Beatles, we love you!"

Dodgers hire DePodesta as new general manager 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES-The Dodgers 
opted for a young Ivy Leaguer to 
lead them, hiring Oakland 
Athletics executive Paul 
DePodesta as general manager 
Monday. 
The move was the first by new 
owner Frank McCourt, whose 
$430 million purchase of the 
Dodgers from News Corp. closed 
Friday. It came just two days 
before pitchers and catchers 
report to spring training in Vero 
Beach, Fla. 
At 31, DePodesta is the third­
youngest person to be hired as a 
big-league general manager. 
Theo Epstein was hired by the 
Boston Red Sox at age 28 in 
2002, and Randy Smith was 29 
when the San Diego Padres 
hired him in 1993. 
DePodesta, an assistant to 
Oakland GM Billy Beane since 
1998, succeeds Dan Evans, who 
had one year remaining on a 
three-year contract. 
"We needed to make a change, we needed a fresh start," McCourt said at a news confer­ence. "In the end, I found this to be a clear choice if not an easy one. During the search, there was one person that stood out. 
"A lot of capable people had a high level of interest in this job. Money was no factor at all. We wanted to find the best possible person. We found that man in Paul." 
DePodesta graduated cum laude from Harvard in 1995 with a degree in economics. He played baseball and football for the Crimson. 
"I don't have all the answers. I know that," said DePodesta, who signed a five-year contract. "My mission is to be on a relentless quest for baseball knowledge. I know that will lead us in a posi­tive direction. 
"What I'm committed to is finding a way to win. I've been given a mandate by Frank and also the resources to be as aggressive as we possibly can." 
DePodesta said the Dodgers

as the A's. 
"I don't think that there's any 

one way of doing things," he 
said. "When we were in 
Oakland, we did what we felt we 
had to do to win. I think proba­
bly my best attribute is being 
able to have an open mind ... 
Oakland reached the playoffs 
the last four seasons, but failed 
to win a postseason series. 
DePodesta worked for the 
Cleveland Indians for three 
years before joining the P:s. 
McCourt said the day after the 
sale was approved that the 44­
year-old Evans would be merely 
a candidate for his own job. The 
Dodgers' GM since Oct. 3, 2001, 
Evans interviewed along with 
other candidates including 
Philadelphia Phillies assistant 
GM Ruben Amaro. 
"I think more than anything 
else I'm glad that there's clo­
sure," Evans told The Associated 
Press. "We were on the right 
track for long-term success. I 
think Dodgers fans will be the 
real winner. That's obviously the 
most disappointing part. 
"Frank and Jamie McCourt have the right to make this deci­sion. I definitely don't agree with it. I loved working here. I was completely committed to the Dodgers and my staff. It's a shame we didn't get the oppor­tunity to complete our job here. That's not my call." 
Evans said his "hands were tied" during the ownership tran­sition, keeping him from making any significant deals. 
DePodesta is considered one of baseball's top young executives and had been expected to take over as GM of the A's in November 2002, when Beane agreed to become GM of the Boston Red Sox. But Beane changed his mind and stayed in Oakland. 
DePodesta also was offered the Toronto GM job a couple years ago, but turned it down. The Blue Jays then hired J.P. Ricciardi, who worked with DePodesta under Beane in Oakland.

NEW YORK -Alex Rodriguez is coming back to New York, the city he left when he was 4. and moving onto the biggest stage in town -Yankee Stadium. 
Baseball's highest-paid player, and perhaps its most talented, was finally and officially dealt to the New York Yankees from Texas on Monday after commissioner Bud Selig approved the record-set­ting swap. 
'Tm pretty excited. This is a big, big one," Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said at the team's minor league com­plex in Tampa, Fla. 
"It ranks with when we signed Reggie," he said, a reference to slugger Reggie Jackson. 
Rodriguez, the first reigning MVP to be trad­ed, will be introduced at the stadium on Tuesday, flanked by manager Joe Torre and Yankees cap­tain Derek Jeter, who will keep his shortstop job. The 28-year-old A-Rod will shift to third base to fill the hole left when Aaron Boone wrecked a knee last month. 
Texas gets second base­man Alfonso Soriano and a minor league player to be named, but it will still have to pay $6 7 million of the $179 million Rodriguez is owed over the remainder of his deal. 
Steinbrenner and Yankees general manager Brian Cashman personal­ly assured Jeter that he would keep his position and that Rodriguez would switch to third -where his only major league experience is one inning during an All-Star game. 
"Derek's response to me was he thinks this is pret­ty cool," said Cashman, who also said moving Jeter was "not a consider­ation whatsoever." 
"You go with the man that brought you to the dance," he said. "You're going to stick with him. You don't mess with suc­cess.... There is no issue there -who·s the start­ing quarterback? We have arguably the best left side of the infield in the history of baseball.·· 
Fervid Yankees fan and former mayor Rudolph Giuliani couldn't agree more. 
"It's great for the city. He·s returning home:· he told The Associated Press. "This could be another variation of Maris-Mantle, Jackson-Munson, Gehrig­Ruth." 

IN BRIEF 
Shot put cham_pion Toth 
tests positive For steroids 
American shot put champion Kevin Toth tested positive for the steroid THG and the stimulant modafinil at the 2003 national championships and could be sus­pended for two years, the U.S. Olympic Committee announced Monday: 
Toth is one of four athletes who flunked THG tests during the U.S. championships in June. The others, announced earlier, were Regina Jacobs, John McEwen and Melissa Price. 
Jacobs and Price also were national champions. 
All four face two-year bans if the positive tests are upheld. Final decisions on their cases are expect­ed this spring. 
Later Monday, agent John Nubani announced Toth was retiring, though he still plans to go through with the appeals process. 
Toth stunned the track and field world with a throw of 7 4 feet, 4 1/2 inches at the Kansas Relays in April -the best performance in the world in 13 years. His winning throw at the national champi­onships was 69-7 1/2. 
The USOC said Toth also tested positive for THG during an out-of­competition test in July. 
Toth, McEwen and Price are dis­puting the THG test results through the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's arbi­tration process. Jacobs instead filed a claim with the American Arbitration Association. 
"We're contesting the charges, and the case will proceed through the USADA process," said Toth's attorney, Howard Jacobs, no rela­tion to Regina. 
European 100-meter champion Dwain Chambers also tested posi­tive last year for THG and faces a two-year ban. He will appear before a UK Athletics disciplinary panel Thursday. 
Toth was one of dozens of athletes 
who appeared before a grand jury probing a nutritional supplements lab. 
Kings' Webber removed 
from injured list 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. -The Sacramento Kings activated Chris Webber from the injured list Monday, but the star forward will have to serve an NBA suspension before he can return to the lineup. 
Webber, a five-time All-Star, was the Kings' leader in scoring, rebounding and assists last season. He hasn't played since tearing carti­lage in his left knee during the sec­ond round of last season's playoffs, and he had extensive offseason sur­gery. 
Webber faces a suspension after pleading guilty last July to charges of lying to a grand jury about his relationship with Ed Martin, a University of Michigan booster who claimed he loaned $616,000 to Webber.

CLUB SPORTS 
Hellrung qualifies for club skiing national championship 
Special to The Observer 
Senior standout Leigh Hellrung of the Notre Dame ski club quali­fied for her third trip to the Nationals this weekend in Regional competition. In a very strong field, the women's squad just missed joining Hellrung in team competition. The top three schools qualify for Nationals, and three strong varsity teams from Northern Michigan, St. Olaf, and Minnesota Duluth claimed those spots. The Irish tied another var­sity power, Minnesota, for fourth place in the 16-school field. 

Hellrung placed fourth in the Giant Slalom behind three skiers from Northern Michigan. Teammates Alanna Lundgren, 22nd, Molly Butler, 24th, Rita Morgan. 39th, and Saint Mary's Danielle Clements, 66th, compet­ed in a field of 189 to finish in third place heading into Sunday's Slalom. Hellrung's 11th place fm­ish again paced the club. but the Irish finished the Slalom in 6th place, and fourth overall. Butler finished 26th, Lungren, 29th. Morgan, 42nd, and Clement's 33rd in a field of 213. 
The men's squad placed a sur­prising. 1Oth in the Giant Slalom and 18th in the Slalom to fmish 14th overall in a 19-school field. Mike Ryan and Joe Payne fin­ished 47th and 49th respectively in the Giant Slalom. Payne was the only Irish skier to complete the Slalom, finishing 40th in the event. 
The top three schools and the top skier from among all the other schools earn the right to compete at ·the Nationals. This year, Hellrung will travel to Sugarloaf, Me.

't 
Notre Dame's ultimate frisbee men's squad kicked off its spring competition at Cincinatti's Arctic I 
Vogue this weekend. Eighteen t, II teams gathered to play in tem­I 
peratures ranging from the low I.' I 20's to the 30's and a strong'1: wind. A small Irish squad includ­ing two rookies split four pool games on Saturday, dropping their opener to Eastern Michigan 11-9, winning their second con­test with Xavier, 11-6, falling to Cincinnati Volatile 11-6, and defeating Ohio State B 11-3. This earned the Irish the No. 1 seed in the B bracket on Elimination Sunday. The Irish lived up to their seed with wins over Xavier, 11-4, Ohio State B 11-3, and Berea 

College 11-9 in the fmals. 
A sluggish start cost the Irish the game with EMU, and the Irish had no answer for Team Volatile's depth and experience, with most members having played 10 or more years. Senior Sean O'Neill and junior Matt Sul~van provided leadership for the Irish. Freshman Eric Morin and Mike Savino came up big on both offense and defense all weekend, while junior Jake Ament caught the final goal on Sunday to earn the B bracket title. 
Gymnastics 
The Notre Dame/Saint Mary's gymnastics club competed at Purdue's Golden Grips Invitational this weekend, with the women's squad placing 5th among 14 teams, and the men's squad fmished sixth. In women's competition, Purdue, Ohio, and Miami (Ohio) claimed the top three sports. Caitlin O'Brien placed sixth on the vault and tied for sixth on the beam to lead the Irish. Kristi Peterson, Mary Blazewicz, Maura Steed, Wendy Syetanoff. Kim Turnipseed, Krissy Jackson and Susan Jennings all earned points for the Irish. 
Andrew Roberts, Dana Colllins, Ross Strambu, Calvin Umeda and Todd Moffat all contributed to the men's scoring. Eastern Michigan, Purdue and Illinois finished at the top of the men's standings. 
Women's water polo 
Western Michigan played host to the Midwest Regional Seeding Tournament this weekend in Kalamazoo. As expected, Notre Dame and Miami Ohio renewed their bitter rivalry in a closely­contested championship final. The eighth-ranked RedHawks avenged a 7-6 Irish victory a week earlier with a 6-5 win to capture top seed in the Regional Championships in April. The Irish will be seeded second. 
Early round victories over Miami B, 12-3, and Ohio, 13-3, earned the Irish a spot in the finals. Freshman Jana Stewart saw considerable time in net, spelling team captain Brigette Alge. M.C. Cimino, Kaitlin Shorock, Christina Hoover, Bridget O'Neill and Katie Lancos led a balanced attack for the Irish.

Women's Ice hockey 
Notre Dame dropped a pair of games this weekend to Western Michigan. In a season when sev­eral key players were lost due to injuries, studying abroad, and ill­ness, the club has never failed to pick itself back up and take on the challenge of playing in a very strong conference with a short­handed squad. 
On Friday, the Irish fell behind the Mustangs 2-0 and fought back to tie the score on a break­away goal from Julia LaPointe and an end-to-end rush by Tori Blainey. WMU scored again and again the Irish answered with LaPointe's second goal. Scrappy play found the Irish down 4-3 after two periods, but the lack of depth took its toll in the third period and the Irish fell 7-3. 

In the rematch on Sunday, the Irish were competitive early. trail­ing by one goal after the first period. The second period was a backbreaker however, as WMU scored six unanswered goals. The Irish showed resolve in battling to a scoreless third period.

"It was great just to get out of the cold weather and play," Gumpf said. "The girls just played hard all weekend. They didn't play perfect, but they played tough and believed in each other and in them­selves." 
Offensively on the weekend, the Irish were paced by jun­iors Megan Ciolli and Liz Hartmann. Ciolli, one of 40 players selected to the USA Softball Player of the Year watch list, collected a .625 batting average at the tourna­ment. 
Hartmann sparked the Irish power attack with three homeruns and seven RBI. She hit the game-winning home­run against Nebraska. 
"Megan'-s just a great leader," Gumpf said of her lead-off hitter. "She knows how to get it done, and then she goes out there and does it. Liz, meanwhile, was just on fire. 
"The other teams tried to pitch around [Hartmann] and they couldn't. I bet she's still giving the Nebraska coach nightmares." 
Notre Dame travels to the Palm Springs Classic in Palm Springs, Calif., this weekend where they will face five teams -including an exhibi­tion against the U.S. Olympic Team -over three days. The Irish do not open play at home until Mar. 20 against Eastern Michigan. 
Notre Dame 8, Hawaii 7 
Sophomore Kellie Middleton made the most of her first hit of the season, connecting on a two-run walk-off home run 
that gave the Irish the victory over the Rainbow Warriors. 
Middleton's hit closed out a five-run rally in the bottom of the seventh inning, after Notre 
Dame had allowed Hawaii to tack on two unearned insur­ance runs in the top of the seventh. 
Sophomore Heather Booth started for the Irish, scatter­ing seven hits and allowing two earned runs and five total runs in 5 2/3 innings. Reliever

"They play a lot of junk defense," McGraw said. 
With only five games, including this one, left on Notre Dame's schedule, the Irish hope to end the season on a strong note to improve their seed in the Big East and NCAA Tournament. 
No matter what seed the Irish are in the NCAA Tournament, though, they will play their first two games at the Joyce Center. 
Notre Dame has a quick turnaround after tonight's game, facing Pittsburgh on the road Thursday. Tonight's tip is at 7 p.m.

Victory puts Irish back in the tourney hunt 

Notre Dame defeats Syracuse 84-72 to win third straight 

By MATT LOZAR Associate Sports Editor 
The Irish have officially moved to the bubble. 
Behind 25 points from Chris Thomas and 22 from Chris Quinn, Notre Dame defeated Syracuse 84-72 Monday night at the Carrier Dome, the third straight Irish win against a top-30 team in the RPI. 
The Irish are now 13-9 over­all and 7-5 in the Big East while the Orangemen fall to 16-6 overall and 6-5 in con­ference.

I 1 Jan. 23, 2001 when the Irish 
' ' won 74-60 at the Joyce
i l Center. Before Monday, Syracuse had won 10 of their last 11 games against Notre Dame. Thomas reached 20 points for the fourth straight game for the first time in his career. Against the Orangemen, he 

was only 6-of-16 from the field but made 5-of-10 from behind the arc and 8-of-9 from the free throw line. 
Monday night was also the first time this season Thomas and Quinn each scored over 20 points in the same game ­something Irish coach Mike Brey has been looking for all year. 
With Torin Francis out, Torrian Jones continued to crash the boards leading the Irish with 12 rebounds. 
Syracuse forward Hakim Warrick recorded game-highs with 28 points and 16 rebounds. Gerry McNamara scored 20 points for Syracuse, but shot only 1-of-9 in the first half and never really got going like he usually does against the Irish. 
But early on, it looked like Syracuse would continue its dominance over the Irish with McNamara scoring the first

Irish fresh after their latest win 

By JOE HETTLER Sports Editor 
St. John's is 2-7 in its last nine games, but Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw knows records don't matter when her team plays away from the Joyce Center. 
"It's a road game," McGraw said. "So it's a problem." 
All of Notre Dame's (15-8 overall, 8-3 in the Big East} losses have come on the road this season -the team has a dismal 4-8 record outside of South Bend. The Irish are 11­0 at home this season and have a current 16-game Joyce Center winning streak. 
Notre Dame is fresh off an 81-51 victory against Providence on Saturday. The Irish had five players score in double figures, including Jeneka Joyce, who had four 3-pointers and a career-high 14 points. The win, coupled with a West Virginia loss, brought Notre Dame within half a game of second place in the Big East. Connecticut leads the conference at 10-1. 
St. John's (9-13, 3-8} has had a week off after losing to
