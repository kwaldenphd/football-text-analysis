Bishop D'Arcy celebrates Mass at College 

By MEGAN O'NEIL Saint Mary's Ediror 
Celebrating Mass at Saint Mary's Sunday, Bishop John D'Arey of the Dioeose of Fort Waynn-South Bend encour­aged students to turn to the Eucharist and prayer in order to live their lives as prepara­tion for their ultimate judg­ment before God. 
lie also answered quostions posed by students on every­thing from the war in Iraq to homosexuality during a reception following Mass hosted by the sonior class board. 
In his homily to roughly 200 pnoplo, I>'Arcy said it is dil'li­eult for individuals, particu­larly youth, to think of death. 
"Th11 Church has the teach­ing that has to do with the supremo moment of our livns, our moment of death," !fArcy said. 
It is important to be prn­parnd for tho important events in life, D'Arcy said, and it is equally important to be prt~pared for death. 
"A life of good eonseiem:e is a way to prepare for that," D'Arcy said. "I hope and pray that when my time is up that I can say that I always did God's will as I saw it." 
Human weaknoss will result in failures along the way, D'Arcy said, and prayer is a critieal means of' strengthen­ing ones relationship with God and keeping one on the correct path. 
"lA life and death in Christ] won't be unless I loarn to pray," I>'Arey said. "God is not real to you unless you pray."

Graduate shares role in identification of 'Deep Throat'

Notro l>anw graduate John O'Connor, tlw litigation lawyer rPsponsibln li1r revnaling the idnn­tity of Watnrgato source "Dnop Throat" in a Vanity Fair article hL<;t summer, spoke Friday on the hroadnr significance of' the famous Nixon Whiltl I louse scan­

The lingering mystery of which Nixon administration insider sup­plied Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bnrnstnin with the incriminating information that eventually lever­aged the president out of ollice has been a hotly debated political and media topie of the last 30 years. 
Many thought the question, "Who was Doep Throat?" would have to wait until the anonymous informant died because Woodward had always held that as the necessary condition for revealing his source.

Lucky Irish, lucky fans 
I attempted to take a step back from it all after the Tennessee game this weekend, and I realized just how fortunate and spoiled I've been in the games that I've seen so far this year.

could walk. Hence, the four games I've seen at Notre Dame stadium so far this year are the first four experiences of my life with Notre Dame football, and I've found myself asking the same question multiple times: How did I get so lucky with the games I've seen so far? 
First, there was the Michigan State game. Besides the beautiful weather and the fact that it was my first-ever Notre Dame game, it was one of the best football games I've ever seen. There's nothing more exciting to me than a comeback, and the 21-point deficit that Notre Dame overcame in a little over a quarter was nothing short of exhil­arating. Even though we ended up on the wrong side of the score­board, being in the student section during that comeback was unbe­lievable. 
Next, there was the USC game which pretty much speaks for itself. I will say, however, that it will be very difficult for any sport­ing event to ever surpass my expe­rience for not only the game, but the weekend in general. I can't help smiling knowing that the ND­USC game was one of the greatest games ever in college football and I was there to witness it. 
Thinking that nothing could even come close to the first two games of the season, the BYU game sur­prised me. While it was by far not the USC or even Michigan State experience, it is not every day that you see about five school records broken in one game. If only there was fantasy football for college that day. 
Finally, this past Saturday, I had an opportunity to witness the Tennessee game from the press box. Since that will probably be the last time for many years that I get 50-yard line seats to a football game that actually means some­thing, it will be experience that I don't forget anytime soon. 
I've seen a total of four Notre Dame football games in my life, and each one has left me walking away shaking my head in disbelief. It will be difficult to surpass the games I've seen so far, but Coach Weis around for 10 more years, I'm hoping he will give me some more games to remember.

Living arrangetnents discussed 
Sociologist Pamela Smock analyzes phenomenon ofunmarried cohabitation 
By MARCELA BERRIOS News Writer 
The topic of unmarried cohabitation among couples in the U.S. took eentcr stage at Notre Dame Thursday. 
As part of the Provost's Distinguished Women's Lncturer Series, guest speaker PanHJia Smock, from the Sociology department at the University of Michigan, addressed the increasingly common phenomenon. 
The leeture analyzed the trend demographieally, provid­ing insight pertaining to the nffncts of socioeconomic stand­ing and race on the probability that a eouple will share a roof out of wedlock. 
The demographic approach also guarantees quiek, reveal­ing statistics to boggle the mind. 
Smock said 33 percent of col­lege-nducated women will have cohabited with a man boforn marrying him. 
Women without a high school diploma, on the other hand, are 60 percent inclined to move in with their partners, and marriage is a less likely outcome for the pair. 
Smock said cohabitation is also more widespread amongst lower class blacks and llispanies. 
Smock argued privileged dassos will use cohabitation as an nntry into marriage -a way to take the relationship to a more intimate level before making the ultimate commit­ment. 
"In the past there seemed to be a less emphasis on really knowing someone before mar­rying that person," sophomore Elaine Zarzana said. 
Lower classes, on the other hand, more often practice cohabitation for its conven­ience, Smock said. 
Rent and utilities are more affordable when the costs are shared with someone else, she said. 
Whichever the reason may be, Smock argued that cohabi­tation as not a thing of the past. "Cohabitation is here to stay," she said. "It has forever transformed the traditional courtship and dating process­es. It is almost as if a new level of intimacy has been added; somewhere between engaging in sexual relations and mar­riage is 'moving in together."' 
In 1950, less than 10 percent of married couples had lived together prior to the nuptials, whereas in 2004 that figure reached 68 percent, and is only expected to increase, Smock said. 
As a result, the Bush admin­istration has launched "The Healthy Marriage Initiative," promoting families with two married parents. 
The initiative reads: "Children fare best when raised in a stable marriage by 
their two biological parents. Furthermore, marriage bene­fits not only children, but adults and communities as well." 
Smock drew attention to the negative effects of cohabitation on children. 
If a single mother's boyfriend moves into the house, the chil­dren are exposed to higher lev­els of instability, which hinders their development, she said. 
There is also a strong corre­lation in the lower classes between cohabitation and domestic violence, substance abuse and alcoholism, she said. 
Smock said the stress of eco­nomic instability itself hinders healthy relationships, and called for innovative govern­ment policies to help the lower class find better-paying jobs, better public health and edu­cation systems. Only then will the family see an improvement in the quality of life, she said. 
Sophomore Carter Angell said he thinks the younger generations are more apt to cohabitation before marriage. 
"I believe that our generation is young and constantly evolv­ing," Angell said. "Living with someone is a good addition to society, it's a good measure for indicating whether or not the relationship can continue and lead to marriage."

Yale W"aives tuition for 111usic students 
Associated Press 
NEW HAVEN, Conn. -In most of America's top conser­vatories, the world's most promising musicians are often deep in debt and giving music lessons just to cover the rent and close the gap between their scholarships and gradu­ate school tuition. 
But a $100 million donation is about to change that sce­nario at The Yale School of Music. 
The anonymous donation, announced this past week, will make advanced music educa­tion free beginning next year. Music scholars hope it will pressure other schools to do the same. 
"Money is a big factor," said Yale master's candidate Clara Yang, 24, who paid for her first year with loans, financial aid and by teaching piano les­sons. 
The current year's tuition at the Yale School of Music is $23,750, and about 200 stu­dents are enrolled each year. 
Half the former art and music students surveyed by college lender Nellie Mae in 1998 had debts bigger than their salaries and most said that, in hindsight, they should have borrowed less. 
"These are incredibly talent­ed people who do wonderful work and enter careers that are not high-paying," said Yale President Richard Levin. "Even members of the groat sympho­ny orchestras don't make a lot of money." 

Joseph W. Polisi, president of the Juilliard School and a graduate of the Yale School of Music, said music graduate students sometimes enter the work force with debts as high as $75,000 and without a guarantee of a job. 
"!low do they pay off those loans? Often that high debt forces the artists out of the profession entirely," Polisi said. 
Five to 10 percent of Juilliard graduate students pay full tuition, Polisi said. The rest receive financial aid that cov­ers most of the costs, he said. Despite that aid, he said, Yale's new policy will give it a recruiting advantage. 
"It will be an important wake-up call to all schools that graduate students, by nature, are poor and need help," said Richard Killmer, an oboe pro­fessor at the University of Rochester's Eastman School of Music. 
Killmer, who for years has also taught classes at Yale, said money concerns frnquent­ly force students to take side jobs that can interfere with their studies. 
By removing the tuition bar­rier, Thomas Duffy, tho acting dean at the Yale School of Music, said he hoped to rocruit students who might otherwise not even consider attending music school.

During this "dark period", students living in residence halls undergoing these renova­tions will have to use cash for vending machines and rely on room keys to get in and out of the dorms, Shoup said. 
All dorms will have a tempo­rary wireless system installed during the 'dark period.' But its reliability and effectiveness will not be known until it has been implemented -Sorin is the guinea pig, so to speak. 
"We've made available tem­porary wireless Internet in the lounges that will be installed when the dorm goes dark," Shoup said. "It might be a little primitive-looking, but there will be wires taped down from the attic to the lounge that will radiate 75 feet." 
Shoup said students without wireless cards can rent one from OIT at no cost. He could­n't make any promises on the reliability of the temporary wireless connections but said he is confident they will suf­fice. 
"We don't want people to panic about this," Kirk said. "The hope is that there will be wireless coverage throughout so that the project won't affect exam preparation. We under­stand students might be con­cerned." 
The work in Sorin should be completed, at the latest, by study days. Residents of Sorin are bracing for the worst since their dark period falls during provost of OIT Dewitt Latimer said. 

In another of the University's major technology projects, OIT is working with cell phone providers to improve reception on campus. But the work won't begin until spring when the snow melts off the roofs. 
"We plan to address cover­age and capacity for cell phone reception," Latimer said. "We're using a hidden antenna system where there will be smaller, stealthier cameras hidden around campus to improve the coverage." 
Improved cell phone recep­tion will allow for the discon­tinuation of dorm room tele­phones. Beginning next fall, telephone service will be an option, but no longer provided for everyone. 
Kirk said that discontinuing phone service is a logical step since fewer and fewer students check their room voicemail. 
"We recognize if we're tak­ing away phones from resi­dence halls, it's not going to be perfect because cell phones can't always get a perfect sig­nal," Kirk said. "But we are providing a substantial improvement." 
The major technological overhauls will be lengthy, but thorough, Kirk said. 
"These are old, historical buildings," Kirk said. "In order for it to be safe, long-lasting and professional, it's going to take a long time. Of course issues are going to come up, but we will do our best not to cause too much disruption."

Tornado rips through midwest 
22 dead and hundreds injured in KY and IN; twister thought to be at least an F3 
Associated Press 

EVANSVILLE, Ind. -A 
tornado tore across western 
Kentucky and Indiana early 
Sunday, killing at least 22 
people as it eut through a 
mobile home park and oblit­
erated trailers and houses as 
rnsidenl<> slept. 

The tornado, with winds of' 
at least 158 mph, hit a horse 
racing track near 
Henderson, Ky., then jumped 
into Indiana around 2 a.m. 
"It was just a real loud 
roar. It didn't seem like it 
lasted over 45 seconds to a 
minute, then it was calm 
again,'" said Steve Gaiser, 
who lives near the Eastbrook 
Mobile llome Park in 
Evansville. 

At least 17 people were 
killed in the mobile home 
park, according to Erie 
Williams of the Vanderburgh 
County Sherilfs Department. 
More people were believed 
to still be trapped in the 
debris, and National Guard 
units were called in to help 
with search-and-recovery 
eiTorts. At least 200 people 
were injured during the 
storm. 

"They were in trailer 
homes, homes that were just 
torn apart by the storm, so 
they're just now getting in 
there trying to find people," 
said deputy Vanderburgh 
county coroner Annie 
Groves. "It's just terrible." 
Rescuers on the scene 
since 2 a.m. reported seeing 
children wandering the area 
looking for their parents and 
parents searching for miss­
ing children. Children's bicy­
cles and other toys were 
strewn amid the debris of 
aluminum siding, mattress­
es, chairs and insulation. 
Five other people were confirmed dead in neighbor­ing Warrick County, east of Evansville, where the Ohio Hiver city of Newburgh was hit. No deaths were reported in Kentucky. 
The storm reduced homes to splinters and scattered debris across the country­side. Entire bloeks of build­ings were nothing but rub­ble. 
Indiana homeland security 
SOMALIA 

Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels surveys the tornado damage in southwestern Indiana 
on Sunday. 
spokeswoman Pam Bright said about 100 of the 350 or so homes in at the Evansville mobile home park were destroyed and 125 others there were damaged. 
Larry and Christie Brown rode out the storm inside one mobile home. 
"Man, it was more than words can say," Larry Brown said. "We opened the door and there wasn't anything sitting there." 
Chad Bennett, assistant lire chief in Newburgh, told CNN that sirens sounded, but most people didn't hear them because it happened in the middle ofthe night. 
The tornado developed in a line of thunderstorms that rolled rapidly eastward across the Ohio Valley. The National Weather Service had posted severe thunder­storm warnings for sections ofnorthern Ohio. 
Ryan Presley, a weather service meteorologist in Paducah, Ky., said a single tornado touched down near Smith Mills in western Kentucky, jumped the river and cut a 15-to 20-mile swath through Indiana's Vanderburgh and Warrick counties. 
The tornado appeared to be at least an F3 on the Fujita scale, which ranges from FO, the weakest, to F5, the strongest. An F3 has winds ranging (rom 158 mph to 206 mph, and the tornado that hit on Sunday may have been even stronger, Presley said. · 
. Warrick County Sheriff Marvin lleilman said the vic­tims indudnd a woman who was eight months' pregnant, her husband and a young child in the rural town of Degonia Springs. A te1~nage girl was also killed near Boonville, and her father was critically injured, he said. 
11m Martin, 42, was at his parenLo;' mobile home when they heard the wind and then the tornado picked up the home and shoved into t11e neighbor's yard. 
He and his parents eseaped unharmed. but they heard several neighbors call­ing (or help. A nearby mobile home was ov1~rtunwd, and another appeared to have been obliterated. 


Pirates becoming more ambitious 
Associated Press 

NAIHOBI, Kenya -The violent attack on a cruise liner ofT Somalia's eoast shows piralns from the anar­chic country on the Horn of Africa are becoming bolder and more ambitious in their efforts to hijack ships for ransom and loot, a mar­itime official warned Sunday. 
Judging by the location of Saturday's attack, the pirates likely were from the same group that hijacked a U.N.-chartered aid ship in June and held its crew and food cargo hostage for 100 days, said Andrew Mwangura, head of the Kenyan chapter of the Seafarers Assistance Program. 
That gang is one of three well­organized pirate groups on the 1 ,8SO-mile coast of Somalia, which has had no effective government sinee opposition leaders ousted a dictatorship in 1991 and then turned on each other, leaving the nation of 7 million a patchwork of warlord fiefdoms. 
Illustrating the chaos, attackers in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, threw grenades and exploded a land mine Sunday near a convoy carrying the prime minister of a transitional gov­ernment that has been trying to exert eontrol sincn late last year. 
The attack, which killed at least live bodyguards, was the second in six months involving explosions near Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi, whose internally dividml gov­ernment spends much of its lime in Kenya. 
Even before the attaek on the liner Seabourn Spirit, Gedi had urged neighboring countries to send warships to patrol Somalia's eoast, which is Africa's longest and lies along key shipping lanes linking the Mediterranean with the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean.

Heisler said the University implemented the new system to avoid situations similar to the Michigan State pep rally, where people were "waiting in vain" outside the pep rally only to be turned away from the event due to lack of seating. 
"We've got to find a way to be more accurate with the numbers, particularly on the student end," he said. "It's important to come up with a better gauge of what student attendance will be, because that's the 'X' factor." But organizers are having a hard time predicting student atten­dance, Heisler said. 
"You kind of have to throw out the USC rally [when making esti­mates[ because of where it was and BYU doesn't count because it was at the end of fall break," he said. "I couldn't tell you what's going to happen even this week."

Cimino said. "In my experience it was the worst showing of the year, [but] I don't think it will happen again." 
For some students, any pep rally in comparison to the hyped­up Oct. 14 stadium affair on USC weekend would be lackluster. 
"To be honest, I think people didn't show up because it was after USC and I think people thought it wouldn't be as good [compared to the stadium pep rally]." senior Kirsten Jackson said. "I also think kids were kind of burnt out." 
Jonathan Stevens -a senior and member of the band -also said students were "burnt out" partly due to event's duration. 
"I heard a lot of people talking and saying the reason they weren't going anymore was because the dorms go over so early and kids don't want to waste an hour and a half [before the event begins]." he said. "I think that's deterring people from the pep rallies lately."

many other government officials above him, knew of the corrupt cover-up efforts taking place," O'Connor said. "But he found a way to expose the truth because he felt compelled as a public ser­vant to expose the scandal." 
O'Connor had hoped that Woodward would be able to con­firm his client was the famous Deep Throat, but the reporter upheld his promise only to reveal Deep Throat's identity upon his death. 
Since revealing Deep Throat's identity to the publie last summer, O'Connor has been working with Felt on a new book entitled "A G­Man's Life: The FBI, Being 'Deep Throat' and the Struggle for Honor in Washington," to be pub­lished this spring by Public Affairs Books. 
O'Connor cited the Watergate scandal as example of the good that can result when sources are kept confidential. "Deep Throat" led a "a skillful and highly coura­geous public discussion" by secretly informing Woodward and Bernstein of the misdeeds of Nixon's administration, O'Connor said. 
The central issue O'Connor addressed was the extent to which journalists are currently and should be protected from having to reveal their sources when the issues they report on become objects of public contro­versy. 
"Deep Throat" was an example of journalists being able to with­hold the identity of their source, O'Connor said. He believes the protection currently provided to journalists is insufficient and under fire. 
O'Connor cited pre-war intelli­gence reporting as an example. 
"I looked almost everywhere for contemporaneous investigative journalism on the Bush adminis­tration's allegations that Saddam Hussein had WMDs in Iraq, and it was extremely hard to come by," O'Connor said. "Journalists need to be reassured that they can inform the public without risk of later being forced to reveal their sources or be indicted." 
O'Connor expressed concern that today's public demand for "headline-grabbing journalism" turns leak investigations into pre­carious situations for journalists and said they "may be harmful to the future of government trans­parency." 
He emphasized the need for a federal shield law, which current­ly provides some protection to journalists, to be "strengthened so that journalists can present the issues without fear of indictment, and let the public debate." 
O'Connor also acknowledged how the nature of modern leak investigations is in some ways dif­ferent from the Nixon era, saying that "today Woodward and Bernstein might be bloggers."

IN BRIEF 
$25 billion acquisition put on hold 
INDIANAPOLIS-Legal problems for strug­gling medieal deviee maker Guidant grew Friday as a deadline to dose a $25.4 billion acquisition by Johnson & Johnson passed with no apparent movement by eithHr side. 
The two eompanies had a self-imposed deadline to dose the deal Friday, but efforts stalled Wednesday when New Brunswiek, N.J.-based J&J said it might not proceed because of sweeping recalls and regulatory investigations that have hit Guidant sinee June. 
J&.J spokesman .Jeffrey Leebaw dedined to comment Friday on the status of the deal. Steve Tragash, a spokesman for Indianapolis­based Guidant, also declined to eomment. 
Guidant has said that neither eompany is depending on the deal for future financial suc­cess, but that J&J is still obligated to eomplete the takeover. 
Meanwhile, the Conneeticut law firm Seott & Seott, I.I.C announeed Friday it had !iled a see­ond securities fraud lawsuit against Guidant, alleging company executives artitieially inllat­ed its stock priee by concealing defects and other liabilities among its implantable defibril­lators.

Beating (around the) Bush 
The glass case of composure sur­rounding the Bush White House has finally begun to crack, and partisans across the country are now waiting anxiously to see what the next few weeks will hold in store for the future of American poli­tics. 
With any luck, it will be a tumultuous future of change and upheavaL 
Three months ago, the Hepublican establishment may have looked at the possibility of a record-breaking hurricane season in the Southeast as a political gift from God. After all, what better way to showcase a future presidential candi­date (Jeb Bush) than by positioning him as the Florida-governor-turned­hurricane-hero of America? Sadly­for the Bush clan, that is -Hurricane Katrina thundered into Louisiana and created both a burning city and a burning Bush. 
Katrina was crack number one. Racial and class injustices exist all over America, and although it was unfair to single out George Bush as a racist and elitist, it is perfectly accu­rate to call the status quo of society those things. The fact is, in a nation that prides itself in democratic unity, equal opportunity, and a 13 percent poverty rate, ne.arly 28 percent of the residents of New Orleans were living in poverty prior to Hurricane Katrina. African-Americans not only dispro­portionately constituted one in every three hurricane victims because of the ignored realities of urban segre­gation, but also suffered a 34.9 per­cent poverty rate in New Orleans before Katrina revealed the bleakness of blackness to white America. 
Tom DeLay was crack number two. This conniving Congressman from Texas confirmed America's suspicions about corruption in politics and

revealed the sad truth that democracy may no longer rest in the hands of the voting public. After being indicted in late September for criminal conspira­cy bncause of a schemP to funnel cor­porate contributions to Hepublican candidates for the Texas Legislature, this eternal thorn in the side or all that is good and right in the world will finally suffer the consequences for committing such a blatant crime against democracy. 
Harriet Miers was crack number three. Cronyism and nepotism have existed in the White Ilousn ever since John Adams appointed his good friend John Marshall as the fourth Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. However, with Bush's dubious selection of his inexperienced pal Miers to replace the esteemed Sandra Day O'Connor on the bench, the pub­lic finally decided to speak out and demand that democratic justice remain a feature of the judicial branch. 
Scooter Libby was crack number four. For the first time in over 130 years (since the Ulysses S. Grant administration). a sitting White House official was indicted, and the reper­cussions of this scandal in the vice president's office have the potential to bring down a number of key adminis­tration officials. After all, while the direct charges of the Libby case are obstruction of justice and other felonies related to the release of undercover CIA agent Valerie Plame's name to the media, the real implica­tions of the case extend directly to the most controversial decision of the Bush administration -the Iraq War. 
Specifically, it was alleged that Libby (and any other official eventual­ly included in the charges) may have released Plame's name as an attack against her husband, Joseph Wilson, for writing a New York Times op-ed piece that discredited a key claim used by President Bush for engaging in the Iraq War -that Iraq had signed a deal with Niger for 500 tons of uranium yellowcake, a potential bomb ingredient. Wilson spent time investigating the claim in Niger and found that it was entirely spurious, thereby nullifying a key piece of evi­dence presented to Congress in 2002 before it gave the President thn authority to engage in military aetion against Saddam Hussein. 
If the revelation of Plame's CIA identity to the publie turns out to be a spiteful act on the part of the Bush administration, it would ·call into question the truth behind the reasons for entering a war that has now killed over 2,000 American servicemen and women. This would in turn call into qunstion the ethics and morality of President Bush himself-a man who, ironically, vowed in his 2000 cam­paign, "When I put my hand on the Bible I will restore honor and integri­ty to the Oval Office." 
Now, in an effort to prevent a fifth crippling crack from shattering through the remnants of his adminis­tration, Bush has recently tried to dis­tract the nation with threats of avian flu and the nomination of ultra-con­servative Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court -a man so ideological that he will surely distract Congress in a hissy-fit of partisan bickering that will last well into 2006. 
However, this is not the same post­Sept. 11 American public whose fear was manipulated by false claims into supporting Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq. The fear of blood-thirsty chickens and eye-gouging sparrows will no longer be enough to distract America into blindly following its leader like a flock of confused sheep. 
Katrina, DeLay, Miers and Libby have shown that there now exists a threat far greater than that of terror­ism or bird flu. There is a threat against democracy, and the American people will not stand for it.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Statistics are misleading 
I would likn to say a few words in response to James Dubray's lettnr to the editor in the Nov. 4 Viewpoint section entitlnd "I hopn, I filar, I pray." 
lie states in his lettnr that he "hopes that these crosses have nothing to do with politics." Trying to separate an issue likn abortion from politics is next to impossible. Those who vinw abortion as thn social injustice that it is will naturally work to change tho eurrent polides. It would be like me say­ing that Dubray's comments about a larger social safety net, univnrsal healthcarc and the war in Iraq have nothing to do with polities. 
Sm~ondly, I'd like to indulge Dubray in his numbers game. lie states that the numbnr of Iraqi civilians who have died in thn war in Iraq numbers 110,000. Ifl am not mistaken, he takns this numbnr from thn easily debunked Lancet Report, whkh hw.; a eonfidence interval so large as to be almost sta­tistkally mnaningless. I'll quote: Compared to the pre-war dnath rate in Iraq, "We estimate there were 98,000 extra dHaths (95 pHrcHnt Cl 8000-194,000) during the post-war pnriod." Tlw numbnrs in parentheses show that the number may b(1 anywhere from 8,000 dnaths to 194,000, an absurd rang(1. Now, don't get me wrong, the deaths as a result of the Iraq War arc a tragndy, but to inflate the statistics like that hints at a motive other than accurate portrayal of the faets. 
I also have some other numbers that I would like to throw out fi1r eonsideration. Five thousand-the number of Kurds killed by Sad dam's gas attack on the city of Ilalabja (accord­ing to the U.S. Statn Dnpartment). One hundred eighty thou­sand -the number of Kurds who were killed or had "disap­peared" as a result of operations by Saddam Hussein's gov­nrnmnnt during his al-Anfal Campaign 1986-1989 (according to I Iuman Righl<> Watch and Amnesty International, hardly biL'itions of conservatism). This barely scratches the surface. You can play with numbers all you like, hut one of the biggest mass murderers of the 20th century is now being tried by the very people who he used to bomb, torture and execute. If that's notjustiee, I don't know what is. 
Dubray then goes on to say that he fears that the motiva­tions of the Catholic Church with regards to abortion are cor­rupt, because of the influence of the Republican party in the Church and the potential for more donations from Republican donors to offset the money lost to the child abuse scandals. I guess he needs more of a reason than that the Catholic Church sees abortion as an affront to the dignity of all life, making it a practice worth opposing. Capital punish­ment occurs much less in the United States than abortion does, and thus receives proportionately less attention, in my opinion. 
Lastly, Dubray goes on to hypothesize that if Democrats were the majority in the Catholic Church, then those who had voted for the Iraq War would not be allowed to receive communion. Let's take a look at the Democrats' voting record for the Resolution: 148 against, 109 for (60 percent-40 per­cent). To imply that the Democratic Party was united against the use of force in Iraq is misleading. I can go through the recorded speeches of numerous prominent Democratic Congresspersons, Sen. Hillary Clinton most notably, to fur­ther illustrate this fact, but I think my point is made. 
It is one thing to be against an issue or a highly-controver­sial war, but to do so using inaccurate statistics and mislead­ing implications does more harm than good, especially from the side that prizes rational debate and dissent as a corner­stone of American democracy. 

Ryan Crane freshman Alumni Nov.4 
Grouping is natural 
Is Notre Dame dubbed a self-segregated campus because Asians have a propensity to hang out with other Asians. or I lis panics with members of their own ethnic minority group, and so on? I am not about to deny that the latter takes place. Yet, I don't see anything inherently wrong with this. 
If you take a look at the bigger picture, you'll notice that birds of a feather indeed flock together, even outside the racial spectrum. Football players enjoy spending time togNher, just as musicians find comfort and joy in each other's company. It's only natural. Would you label this self-segregation? I wince at the word, with its negative connotation. I don't believe that people who clump togeth­er do so with the intent of shunning people dissimilar to them. They just happen to find common ground and a strong foundation by which to form their relationships. 
As a minority myself, I understand the value of discus­sion among members of one's ethnic group. People of the same ethnic heritage tend to have similar experiences and are consequently more likely to understand eaeh another. Dialog in this setting about one's culture and out­look facilitates a greater understanding and acceptance of oneself. Collnge is a time to cultivate one's self-knowledge, which entails a certain degree of understanding in rp,gards to one's roots. This is why I find it not only aceeptable, but valuable for ethnic minority groups to come together. 
That isn't to say that people of the same ethnie back­ground should always spend time with each other; it's important to branch out and meet others who might dis­agree with one's beliefs or culture. After all, this is where learning in its most natural form takes place. 

Last year, I remember being somewhat annoyed when I would see minority groups isolating themselves from oth­ers, perhaps because it seemed as though they were alienating others. Now, however, I understand the need for some people to do this. Can you imagine how hard it would be to live in a foreign country, stripped of your family and the comforts of the food, music and culture you've been used to your whole life? It's no wonder that some minority students seek each other out and inevitably "self-segregate" themselves. 
If you truly want to learn about another culture and get to know people from other backgrounds and walks of life, take the initiative. Next time you pass by an ethnic minor­ity group at the dining hall, ask to join them. You just might learn something about yourself.

Despite the whining by Frist, the Democral-;' secretive, well-planned tactics worked, in that reporters and commentators at least f(Jr a moment were brought back to a discussion about some­thing that matters: why we went to war and how the administration sold it to tlw public. 
The Post reported that after two hours behind dosed doors, Frist announced a bipartisan ta-;k force would report on the progress of the intelli­gence committee's inquiry into tlte prewar use of intelligence. 
The drama came in the context of both sides claiming the other just wants to change the sub­ject.

Pulling no punches 
Safety Tom Zbikowski's pair ofscores push Irish past Volunteers, 41-21 
By KEVIN BRENNAN 
Sports Writer 
After falling behind 21-3 to the Irish in the second quarter Saturday, Tennessee battled hack to tie the score at 21, put­ling Notre Dame's No. H ranking and ehanees at a BCS bowl berth on tlw line. But on third­aml-10 from the Irish 25-yard line with less than a minute remaining in tlw third quarter, Notre Dame receiver Jeff Samardzija took quarterbaek Brady Quinn's pass 73 yards to tlw Volunteer 2-yard line, nldaiming control of the game and thwarting the unranknd Voluntnnrs' upset bid. 
"All the momentum swung back our way on that one play," Notrn Damn head eoaeh Charlie Weis said. 
C)uinn hooked up with Samardzija again three plays later for a 4-yard touehdown to put the Irish up 2H-21. With the drive. Notre Dame regained eontrol of the contest and defeated Tennessee 42-21 Saturday in a game highlighted by a pair of Tom Zbikowski touchdown returns. 
The vietory moves the Irish to 6-2 on the season and elevated them to No. 7 in both polls. 
Zbikowski sealed the victory with 3:17 left in the game when he intereepted Tennessee quar­terback Erik Ainge's pass and returned it 33 yards for a touch­down. 
Notre Dame extended its lead to 21-3 with 9:49 left in the first half when Zbikowski fielded a Britton Colquitt punt at the 22­yard line and returned it 78 yards for his first touchdown of the game. 
"Once he gets the ball, he's going to try to make something happen," Irish cornerback Ambrose Wooden said of Zbikowski. "It was just amazing watching him make guys miss." 
Quinn finished the game with 295 yards through the air and thrne touchdowns, completing 20-of-33 passes. Samardzija eaught seven passes for 127 yards and one touchdown in his eighth straight game with a touchdown reception, a Notre Dame record the junior contin­ues to build upon. 
Early in the fourth quarter, following Samardzija's touch­down. Wooden grabbed an intnrception of his own and returned it 41 yards to the Tennessee 39, setting up an eventual 36-yard D.J. Fitzpatrick field goal. 
Weis said he was pleased with the play of his secondary. The Irish allowed Ainge to complete just 13-of-32 passes for 187 yards. 

Notre Dame jumped out to a two-touchdown lead early in the contest. After the Irish defense stopped Tennessee's first drive at the Notre Dame 40, Colquitt pinned Notre Dame back at its own 6-yard line with a 34-yard punt. But Quinn and the Irish marched down the field, going 96 yards in 11 plays. Quinn threw for 101 yards on the drive and hit tight end Anthony Fasano for a 43-yard touchdown to give Notre Dame a 7-0 lead. The score was Fasano's first of the season and the longest reception of his career. 
On the ensuing kickoff, Irish cornerback Mike Richardson stripped the ball from Tennessee kick returner Lucas Taylor and Notre Dame's Leo Ferrine recovered the fumble at the Tennessee 28-yard line. 

It didn't take Quinn long to find the end zone again. On third-and-18 from the 35-yard line, Quinn threw a fade pass to wide receiver Maurice Stovall, who caught the ball high in the air as he fell back into the end zone for a 35-yard touchdown catch that put the Irish up 14-0. 
Weis stressed the advantage of 
capturing the momentum so 
early in the game. 
"To be able to lake that ball

kicker James Wilhoit that cut 
the Notre Dame advantage to 
14-3. 
Tennessee's comeback began in the second quarter when the Irish made a rare mistake in the passing game. 
On first-and-1 0 from the Notre Dame 3H with 6:39 left in the period, Quinn threw a backward pass to Samardzija that the receiver dropped. The loose ball was ruled a fumble and was recovered by Tennessee line­backer Ryan Karl. 
Tennessee took advantage of the good field position. Eight plays later, on third and goal from the 7-yard line, Ainge scrambled out of the pocket and found receiver Bret Smith in the back of the end zone to cut the lead to 21-10 heading into half­time. 
Tennessee's comeback contin­ued in the third quarter, as the Notre Dame offense could not seem to put together any long drives. With 5:06 left in the quarter, Wilhoit converted a 30­yard field goal to bring the score to 21-13. 
After forcing the Irish offense into a three-and-out, Tennessee got the ball back at the Irish 45­yard line. The Volunteers drove down the field behind the strong running of Foster and a 23-yard pass from Ainge to C.J. Fayton that brought Tennessee to the 3­yard line. 
On first and goal, Foster took the handoff and scampered in for a Volunteer touchdown. Ainge hooked up with Smith on the two-point conversion to even the score at 21. 
"They had done a nice job to weather the storm," Weis said. "We obviously came out hot and got on top of them early, and it didn't deter them, didn't distract them. They just stayed in their game plan."

Saturday, the first time the Irish have scored twice in the opening period this season. 
Combined punt, kickoff and interception return yards tallied by the Irish during
272 

Saturday's win over the Volunteers. 
quarterbacks: Quinn did what was needed for Notre Dame to win against Tennessee -play it safe. He hit open receivers for three touchdowns and committed no turnovers. 
running backs: Walker ran well when 
needed, but didn't break any long runs 
or score a touchdown. He averaged 4.1 yards per carry while Thomas and Schwapp helped wear down the Vols. 
receivers: Fasano scored his first TD of the season and Stovall's first-quarter scoring catch made the ESPN highlight reel. Samardzija's 73-yard reception kept the Volunteers from coming back. 
offensive line: The Irish managed only 48 rushing yards against Tennessee's stout defensive line. Quinn was sacked three times, but generally had enough time to throw. 
defensive line: Ainge never really got into a rhythm thanks to six hurries by Abiamiri and Landri. The defensive line held the Vols to 187 yards rushing and just 2.8 yards per carry. 
linebackers: Mays had 2.5 tackles for loss 
and one sack while Crum had three tackles for a loss and broke up a pass. 
Hoyte played solidly once again, racking 
up five total tackles. 

defensive backs: Zbikowski and Wooden 
The Irish were in trouble. A tal­ented Tennessee squad had shot back from a 21-3 deficit and tied the game with 18 straight points.

to knot the contest at 21. It appeared the Volunteers were on the verge of a season-salvaging win. 
It looked like this was the time for Notre Dame to collapse, to choke, to 
do its best imitation of Greg Norman in The Masters. 
But this isn't the old Notre Dame. 
The old Irish team, or at least those of the past several years, would have been as useful in the climactic fourth quarter as a hot dog bun in the soaking rain that fell on Notre open and the customary 38-point beating would commence. They were the teams that would let Pittsburgh and Boston College hang around, only to hand the game away at the end. They were the teams that didn't believe they were any 

good. But these aren't the old Irish. Just ask Jeff Samardzija. 
The Notre Dame receiver snatched up a short Brady Quinn pass on third-and-10 from the Irish 25-yard line, then raced down the sidelines for a 73­

It's not just that Samardzija has rubber cement in his finger­tips or that safety Tom Zbikowski has a high­ly-sensitive nose for the end zone. 
It's that these play­ers and the rest of the Irish know they're good. 

Talent has not been the problem at Notre Dame for the past several seasons. The issue was that players didn't understand what they were capable of. 
Charlie Weis has brought a lot to Notre Dame -a more efficient offensive playbook,-a fiery special teams coach in Brian Polian and even a fresh version of the green jersey. 
But nothing Weis has brought to the Irish program has been as 
important as his confi­dence (or cockiness, depending on whether or not you're from New Jersey). 
It's an attitude that has rubbed off on Notre Dame. 
He has the squad believing it's better than anyone else. 
He has the Irish thinking there are no excuses for losing ­especially in Notre 

Dame Stadium. 
He has them thinking that they are supposed to make a play when the game is on the line. Confidence is not just encouraged by Weis and the rest of the coaching staff; it's ­expected. 
The Irish found themselves in a rut on Saturday. But they didn't drop their heads and wait for the game to end and frustration to begin. 
Instead, they looked to their coach, snapped up their chin straps, clenched down on their mouth guards and created a win.

'Zibby' becoming scoring threat

Receiver scores 12th touchdown of2005, ranks third in nation 
By KEVIN BRENNAN 
Sports Writer 
.Jeff Samardzija's third­quarter touchdown was his 12th on the season. breaking thn Notre Dame record for receiving scorns in one year. The rec:ord was previously hnld by Derrick Mayes, who had 11 touchdown catches in 1994. 
Samardzija also extended his own school record for consecutive games with a touchdown reception. 
Thn junior has scored at least once in each of the first eight gamns of the season. 
Samardzija's 12 touchdown catdws place him in a tie for third plaen in the nation. USC's Dwayrw .Jarrett leads tlw country with 14 on the snasor1. 
Wnis attributed much of Samardzija's success to the rneoivor's precise route run­ning and 11xenllnnt hands. 
"l~vnry pro scout that comes in lwrn is drooling ovnr him a couple years from now say­ing, 'God, this guy catches everything."' Weis said. "And he does." 
Clearing a path 
The 35-yard first quarter touchdown reception by Mauricfl Stovall was his sixth of the season and the 13th of his career. The senior now has the fifth-most career touchdown receptions in school history. Mayes holds the record, with 22 from 1992-95. 
Stovall only recorded one catch in the game after his touchdown, but the receiver certainly made his presence felt. Stovall threw key blocks on both Anthony Fasano's and Samardzija's touchdown receptions, as well as on Samardzija's 73-yard catch late in the third quarter. 
Stovall appreciates how important blocking is to the wideout position. 
"A big block is just as big as a catch," the senior said. 
Samardzija has been extremely impressed with Stovall's blocking all year. 
".:v'auri~:e is a great hloek­nr, he satd. "From what I've seen around the nation he is easily 
one of the top blockers in the country. It's something that gets overlooked." 
Rough and tough 
Tennessee impressed the Irish with its hard-hitting and physical play. The massive Volunteer defensive line weighs an average 287 lbs. per person, whereas the Notre Dame front four weighs only 269 lbs. per person. 
"Coach Weis warned us it was going to be a boxing match, it was going to be a brawl, a bar fight," Stovall said. "When you're playing a team that really doesn't have a great record ... they really don't have anything to lose." 
Anthony Fasano, Darius Walker and Trevor Laws all suffered injuries during the game for Notre Dame. None of the injuries are thought to be serious and all three of the players returned to the game. 
Ice-cold bath 
Weis rneeivnd a Gatorade bath after thn victory from dnfnnsivn lirwmen Justin Brown and Tnwor Laws. lie wasn't too thrilled in the postgame press conference, whnn he was still not sure who gave him the shower. 

''I'm going to get the video tape and find out who did that," Weis said. ''I'm not big on that but that's all right. I'll take one for the team." 
Running up the score 
Notre Dame scored at least 31 points for the sixth straight game Saturday and the seventh time on the sea­son. The only game in which the Irish have not reached that mark in 2005 was the 17-10 victory at Michigan on Sept. 10. Notre Dame reached 31 points just live times in the previous two seasons. 
Coin toss 
Tennessee won the toss and elected to receive. Notre Dame defended the south end zone. 
Captains 
Brady Quinn, Brandon lloyte and ILJ. Fitzpatrick wore Notre Dame's three cap­tains for the game. Quinn and lloyte are the offensive and defensive captains for the season, while the special teams captain is s11leeted by tho coaches eaeh week.

Tennessee's offensive realignment didn't work Saturday. Even ifthe 
Volunteers had seen more success from splitting the offensive coordinator duties among the coaching staff after Randy Sanders resigned Oct. 31, Tom Zbikowski probably would have stopped it eventually. The Irish strong safety scored two touchdowns-one on a 78-yard punt return and the other on a 33-yard interception return-as Tennessee fell behind early, came back, then fell behind again in a 41-21loss to Notre Dame. In what had appeared in the preseason to be the second-toughest game on the Irish schedule, the contest against the Volunteers ended up as a showcase for the talents of Zbikowski and Notre Dame's JeffSamardzija. The lanky receiver caught his 12th touchdown of the season-breaking Derrick Mayes' 11-year-old school record. His score was one of three thrown by quarterback Brady Quinn on the day. Anthony Fasano caught his first touchdown of the season and Maurice Stovall made a leaping, 35-yard grab in the end zone as Notre Dame made one more step toward the BCS.

Appntitn's stock in trado is Guns N' Hos«'s, but thn band was not shy about branching out, including thn Bnatlns, tlw Boss and thn Stones on thn set list. Wlwn Appntitn did branch out to non­(;uns N' Hosns music, thny still tnnded to stick to songs that the band originally eovnrnd. 
"Wn're hasieally singing a cover of a 1:ovnr ... but tho fans dig it," drummer BnlrHlan Collins said.

Noither Marnoc:ha nor Collins, hownv­Pr. has thn voicn to covor Axl, so thny tunwd to junior Will MeAulifTn to pro­vido vocals. llis raspy baritone shifts into high gnar once the music starts, belting out lyrics in an unapologetic shriek. It's not a falsntto because it's not nearly prntty nnough. It's not quito a scream and not quitn a hundred-odd­decibel whine. What it does dosely approximaln is tho anguished crins nmanating from Chris Campbell's bass. 
The foursome mixed perennial crowd favorites like "You Could Be Minn." "Wnlconw to the .Jungle," "Cold Novcmbnr Hain" and tho obligatory and always-satisfying "Paradise City" with offerings for the dinhards with GNH's whole discography filling their iPods. These hard-hitting songs inelud­nd "It's So Easy" and "Don't Cry" and ballads like "I Need You" or "My Midwlln." Most of tlw soflnr material, however. was furnishnd by the Beatles, especially Appetite's versions of "Lonely lloarts Club." 
"If' you don't know this song, just leave. Lnave Amnrica," McAuliffe said. 
On that ultimate sixties ballad, "I ley .Jude," though, he couldn't quito sum­mon a lyrical sound or smooth the rasp. Axl might have slapped him -though the question remains whether it would be on the back or upside the head. 
Old and young, the crowd matched thn band in intensity. The floor was packed, the galleries impassable -an achievement doubly notable for the fact that Club Fever is a 21-and-up venue. 
"As a band, we were all extremely happy," said Collins, who added the crowd "definitely" carried the band for­ward with its energy. 
ll surely didn't hurt that White Sox star Jermaine Dye was in attendance Friday night, coming ofT his MVP per­formancn in the World Series. Dye, whose girlfriend attended high school 


with Collins and Marnocha, met the band after the show and "had some very nice things to say about the show. lie had a really great time," Collins said. 
Despite some technical mishaps throughout the show, including consis­tent feedback on several speakers, and McAuliffe's less-than-commanding visu­al presence (his most spontaneous moment came when a female fan who'd partaken a bit too heavily jumped onstage to kiss him -he dedicated the next song to her) the performance rep­resents a resounding success for Appetite for Destruction. 
Thn next step for the band seems natural for a cover band. 
"Original material," Collins said. "The thought was to use the Guns N' Hoses thing as a vehicle." 
The band hopes to continuo to play shows as often as possible, incorporat­ing its own songs as they are written and perfected. To answer qunstions about whether the band would slay together for the end of the year Collins said, "We'll sec what happnns." 
Fans of Appeliln for Destruction will certainly await the band's next perform­ance, whether it includes covers, nnw material or something nntirnly unex­pected.

NO WOMEN'S GOLF 

Irish set to travel to Augusta 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Writer 
After one of its best three­round scores of the year only netted a lOth-place finish in the Las Vegas Collegiate Shootout, the Notre Dame women's golf team will have a softer field to contend with at the Lady Jaguar Invitational in Augusta, Ga. this week. 
"This field's a little weak," Irish head coach Debby King said. "We're the highest-ranked team here. The next highest­ranked is Augusta State." 
The Irish are ranked No. 35 in golfstat.com's rankings, while the Jaguars are ranked No. 58. The only other teams in the top 100 are No. 84 Western Carolina and No. 85 Richmond. 
and Wyoming fill out the rest of the field. 
Despite the weaker field, King said the Irish are not overlooking the Lady Jaguar, which will be their last event until February. 
"[Augusta State is] playing on 

their home course, which Gebauer also had a strong means we have to keep an eye showing last week, carding a 72 
on them," King said. "We want to sandwich the fall season. We won at the beginning and we want to win at the end." 
The Irish won the Notre Dame Invitational in September to begin their season.

to lead the team in the second round. 
Nakazaki, who finished second on the team in Las Vegas with a three-round score of 224, leads the Irish with a 74.23 stroke average this season. 
Brophy, a team captain this year, finished third on the team last week with a 226. 

Tuesday. King said she's happy the team will have to play less golf than usual. 
"It's better than 36 holes in one day, this way we don't have to walk 36 holes," King said. 
King will send the lineup out onto the course as she did last week in Las Vegas. Sophomore Jane Lee, junior Noriko Nakasaki, fresh­man Lisa Maunu, 

senior Katie Brophy and senior Lauren Gebauer Lee recorded a career-best in Nevada, carding a two-under-par 70 in the third round. She led the team with a three round score of 217. 
Maunu, who has burst onto the scene this year as a fresh­man, finished fifth on the team with a 245 last week, but has solidified her place in the top five enough to earn a spot in the lineup this week. 
The Lady Jaguar is the last tournament for the Irish before their winter break, which will last until the Central District Classic in Parish, Fla. Feb. 19­
20. The Irish will use the break to do things in practice they don't normally have time for. 
"We stay outside until around Thanksgiving," King said. "We do weightlifting and cardia a couple times a week. We also have some sports psychologists work with us over the winter."

NYC MARATHON 

Tergat captures closest NYC marathon in history 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Paul Tergat surged one last time, breaking the tape a heartbeat before defending champion Hendrick Ramaala fell across the finish line. 
After more than two hours of running Sunday, the New York City Marathon came down to a final sprint and a third of a second -the closest finish in race history. 
Tergat and Ramaala were side by side all morning, trad­ing the lead for 26.2 grueling miles through New York's five boroughs and across fog­shrouded bridges and leaf­strewn roads. 
Tergat, a Kenyan who holds the world marathon record, and South Africa's Ramaala jockeyed for the lead in Central Park. 
Tergat surged, then Ramaala, then Tergat again. Tergat's official time was 2 hours, 9 minutes, 30 seconds, but the exact clocking was 
2:09:29.90. Ramaala's time was 2:09:30.22. 
It was reminiscent of the 2000 Sydney Olympics, where Tergat and Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie sprinted to the finish in the 10,000 meters. Gebrselassie managed one last dash in the final 30 meters, leaning to edge Tergat by nine-hundredths of a sec­ond. 
This time, Tergat crossed the line first on a warm, sticky day. l-Ie was one of 37,516 competitors to start the race, a record for any marathon. 
"The weather was incredi­ble, very hot, but I was trying to keep cool. The least thing that I was expecting is that we were going to have to sprint to finish," Tergat said. "It was really, really painful, we work until the last minute. It reminds me of the Olympics again, but I was not expecting 
that  in  a  marathon,  that  
sprint."  
Hamaala  wasn't  sure  
whether  he  tried  to  dive  

across the finish line, or sim­ply collapsed from exhaustion. 
"I don't remember," he said. "You know, coming in second is not nice. 
"The last hundred meters, who wants to go the last hun­dred meters with Paul? I gave it everything," Ramaala said. "Paul didn't want to lose, I didn't want to lose." 
Meb Keflezighi finished third, the best finish by an American. 
But the U.S. victory drought at the New York race grew to 23 years. 
Women's winner Jelena Prokopcuka had a slightly eas­ier time than Tergat.

a chance to iee the game. 
Behind the running of Ossei­Anto (12 carries, 71 yards) and Muhlenkamp (8 carries, 42 yards), the Bats drove to within the Morrissey five. However, successive penalties moved Zahm back 20 yards, forcing them to throw on third and long. Wieland was blindsided as he rolled left, fumbling in the process. Morrissey rncovered, and Muhlenkamp's interception ended it on the next play. 
A brimming Gourley said he can't wait to play in the Stadium in two wnnks. 
"llt'sl a dream come true," he said. "To have the last game of my career be played in Notre Dame Stadium is unimagin­able." 
Keenan 7, Carroll 0 
Keenan's defense stopped Carroll on it's only fourth quar­ter drive, and its oll'ense did the rest, as thn Knights defeated the Vermin 7-0 on a slippery Sunday at the Stnpan fields. 
There were no points scored in the second half, and turnovers and penalties proved costly for both teams. Both teams made plenty of mistakes, playing the last game of the day on a torn-up, muddy field. Keenan's ofl'ense was penalized 65 yards in total. Keenan threw two interceptions, and Carroll threw one and had a fumble all within the last six plays of the second quartnr. Carroll also had a costly fumble on a sack at the end of the third quarter. 
Keenan's running game was the key to its win. Hunning back Alex Staflieri scored on the sec­ond play of the second quarter from two yards out, and the Knights largely kept it on the ground for the rnst of the game, not even throwing a pass iFI the second half, running out the elock as its defense kept Carroll in check. Keenan ran for 137 yards in total, but was far from dominant, as it was unable to put Carroll away until late in the fourth quarter when the defense came up with a big a 
NFL 

fourth-down stop. 
Both defenses played well, as, in addition to the turnovnrs, each team was forcnd to punt once, and Carroll turned the ball over on downs twice (Keenan did so once). But Carroll's dflfense allownd more big plays than Keenan, inelud­ing passing plays of 45 and 56 yards that went to senior wide receiver Dan Zenker. Keenan had 258 yards of total oll'ense, compared to Carroll's 98. 
Kennan was thrilled with the victory and eager to play Zahm. 
"We came out and we played Keenan football," senior captain Vince Lyzinski said, "And Carroll couldn't stop it." 
Lyzinski credited an excellent performance by the offensive line and tailback Staffinri with sealing Keenan's victory. 
He also said that his team couldn't wait to play its next game. 
"Wn're really excited for Zahm", he said. "Wn've got a little rivalry going, and it's

Sporrs Writtrs 
Morrissey had thn monwn­tum. thn ball and about 2:30 to nwve 70 yards and earn a trip to Notrn Dame Stadium. The Manorites, with the imposing Zahm oiTensn prepared to scorn and put thn gamn away, had miraculously recovm·ml a Snan Winland fumble at their own 30. For the moment, the mighty Bats snmnnd heatable. 
But Cameron Muhlenkamp had othnr ideas. In what has bnr.ome a delining eharaeteris­tic of thn Zahm defense in recent weeks, Muhlenkamp stnppml up and made a play. On the first play after the fumble, the Zahm dnfnnsivn back jumped a quick sideline pass, making a diving interception to snal an X-6 victory and puneh Zahm's tieknt to the Stadium. It was the third turnover that Zahm had foreml on the day. 
"Whnn you're out thero late in thn game, your emotions start running," Bats captain Pat Gourl1~y said. "When we fum­hll~d it late, we wnre a bit con­cnrrwd. 
But I knew that our pass dnfnnsn would step it up." 
Tlw ontire game had a eham­pionship-likn atmosphere. The bitter cold and wet eonditions forced both teams to focus on the ground game. Momentum turned about as often as the gusting winds that blew across Hinhln Field. and the game itself lived up to its billing as a defen­sive slugfnst. Fittingly, Muhlonkamp's stnllar dnfnnsive nll'ort sealed thn gamn. 
llownver. in thn lirst half. it appnarnd as if the game would be a bit more ol'f'nnsivn than what was originally nxpectt~d. Zahm opened the game with an imprnssive 7 -play, 65-yard drivn capped oil' by Theo Ossni-Anto's 1-yard touchdown run. 
The oponing drive was high­lighted by SPan Wieland's 42­yard strike to receiver Jake Hichardville. Wieland thnn hit Seth Frninslebnn for a two-point conversion to make it 8-0, and provide the margin of victory for the Bats. 
Stunnnd, but not faznd, Morrissey answflred Zahm's score with an nxhausting 15­play drive eapped by an 8-yard touchdown pass by quarterback Mike Spencer. The drive fea­turnd a steady diet of the Manorites' powerful running back Nick Kinin, who carried 18 times for 73 yards on the day. The bruising back powered through Zahm's strong defen­sive line, often· carrying several defenders with him. 
"We've bonn doing it all sea­son," Klein said. "Zahm has a very tough defense." 
Unfortunately for Morrissey, Zahm was able to come up with a huge stop when it neednd to, dropping Klein inches short of the goal line on the two-point attempt. It was quite possibly those few inches that kept Morrissey from reaching the championship game. 
Klein however, refused to make excuses. 
"Thern are so many chances throughout the game that you can't look at just one play as the reason you lost," he said. "I'm proud of' our team for the hard work. This is just the how foot­ball is sometimes." 
The teams traded defensive punches throughout the remainder of the game. Late in the third, Morrissey drove deep into Zahm territory, threatening to take the lead. But Pat Gourley picked off a Spencer pass, and Zahm successfully dodged another bullet. 
Morrissey squandered solid fi-eld position in the fourth as well when an attempted reverse backlirnd, resulting in a fumbln. Liam Larkin fell on it for the Bats, setting up his oiTense with going to be a great game." 

Carroll was disappointed at the outcome of the game, but looked baek positively at this season's sueeess. 
"We gave it a heck of an eiTort," Carroll eoach John Tira said of Sunday's game. "We had opportunities, but we didn't connect on any of our long passes. I'm really proud of the way we playnd right until the end. This was a good Kennan team." 
Peter Sweeney, senior eo-cap­tain of thn Carroll team, also saw posilives in his team's per­formancn this s1mson. 
"It was a disappointing loss," he said. "But, overall, the sea­son was good. My freshman year our team didn't win a sin­gle gamo. 
"Sinet~ then, we've come a long way. It's been a great year."

MEN'S SWIMMING 
Irish upend Pittsburgh with dramatic rally 
By JACK THORNTON Sporrs Writer 

The Irish men's swimming team showed incredible resiliency Friday night, putting together a thrilling rally over Big East rival Pittsburgh to take the meet 122-121. 
Down 119-107 entering the final event, Notre Dame had no margin for error, but the Irish proved they're more accurate than a Zogby election-day poll. The 'A' team of of Louis Cavadini, Alan Carter, Nick Fanslau and Tim Kegelman took first with a time of 3:06.35 while the 'B' squad of Ted Brown, Chris Barnes. Rob Seery and Tim Randolph took second at 3:06.81, giving the Irish 15 of 17 possible points and the victo­ry. 
"I was diving right next to the guy from Pitt, and I knew it was going to come down to him and me, and I just knew I wasn't going to let him to win," Randolph said. "After I touched the wall and before I put my fist in the air, I looked around to see all the fans, the coaches and all the Notre Dame people were going nuts. It was just an amaz­ing feeling." 
The win puts the No. 18 Irish at 2-1 for the season in dual meets. 
"What we've wanted to do is to learn how to win a tough meet on the road and even though it was very, very close and the difference was only one point, nevertheless. we got a tough win on the road," head coach Tim Welsh said. 
Knowing the Irish had to go 1-2 in the final event. Welsh split up the two relay teams so that they would be as close as possible. 
"They'd either both win or both lose, that was our strate­gy," Welsh said. 
The fact that the Irish won the final event (and the eight swimmers finished between :46.09 and :4 7 .19) is a testa­ment to the balance on the team. 
"Certainly a win like this solidifies the group and it also verifies that all along we're a team of balance and a team of depth, and it took every single one of us -we didn't have any extra points," Welsh said. 
Along with the mental focus of the team as a whole, strong individual performances were a key part of Friday's victory. Six swimmers had season-best times, including Jay Vandenberg, who won the 500­yard and 1,000-yard freestyle events for the third meet in a row, and Brian Freeman, who had season best times in the 200-yard backstroke and 200­yard freestyle. 
"Even after the big win against Texas A&M and a tough loss like Purdue, we know every week we need to get back to work," Lutkus said. "Every week we're training harder, and if we train hard, we're gonna keep putting up better times and it's not gorina stop this weekend." 
The Irish came out strong in the first four events of the night to take a 41-33 lead. On the strength of solid one-meter div­ing, the Panthers took the 60-52 advantage after six events and stretched into a 21-point lead {114-93) with only two events to go. 
With only 36 available points left in the match, freshman Daniel Rave cashed in a huge performance, beating out Pittsburgh's Warren Barnes by five-hundreths of a second in the 200-yard breaststroke while Graham Parker and Tyler Grenda placed third and fourth, respectively, to bring the Irish to within 12 points entering the final event. 
"We knew our strengths going into the meet, and we knew we'd be strong at the end of the meet. I think the guys definitely were a little worried but we never lost confidence," co-cap­tain Jamie Lutkus said. 


The Irish entered the meet coming off a definitive loss to higher-ranked Purdue. 
"After coming off of Purdue, we were really down because we could've preformed a lot better in West Lafayette," Randolph said. 
"But to beat Pitt and the way we did is gonna give us a lot of momentum going into Michigan State and in the Notre Dame Invitational before Christmas break." 
The meet held extra impor­tance for the two schools since Notre Dame broke Pittsburgh's eight-year run of Big East con­ference titles last year. 
More than 700 people were in attendance at Trees pool in Pittsburgh. 
"Pitt, to their credit, they swam very well," Welsh said. "They swam faster than they swam last week and faster than they swam against us last year. What's great about this rivalry it's very high competition and it's great sportsmanship. 
"This is college rivalry the way it way its supposed to be; college athleticism at its best."

Tho111pson tvvins fall short in second grand sla111 of year 
By RYAN KIEFER 
Sports Writer 

Catrina and Christian Thompson's bid to make NCAA history at the ITA National Indoor Championships fell short in the quarterfinal round Friday afternoon. 
The twin sisters won the first grand slam of the season, the ITA All-American Championships last month. They were attempting to become the first-ever doubles team to claim the All­American and Indoor Championships in the same year. 
The Thompsons were elimi­nated by the Stanford team of Alice Barnes and Anne Yelsey by an 8-3 score. The No. 7 Cardinal duo avenged a loss in the quarterfinals of the All­American tournament to the top-ranked Irish team. The Cardinal, much like the Irish in the All-Americans, used the quarterfinal win to propel them to the Indoor Championship title. 
Irish coach Jay Louderback thought the Stanford team would be tough even before the season started. 
"We thought they would be one of the top two teams [along with the Thompsons] in the country," Louderback said. "They were ranked lower only because they didn't play together last year. They are a very good team, but we know we didn't play our best. It's just too bad that we had to play them so early in these tournaments." 
Barnes and Yelsey played on 

different doubles teams last year. 
Their teams comprised the all-Cardinal title match of the NCAA doubles championship last season. The Thompsons' 
loss  came following  an  8-6  
opening round win  over  a  
team from Kentucky.  

Catrina Thompson also par­ticipated in the singles draw of the Indoor Championships, posting a 1-2 record. Thompson lost a hard-fought battle to No. 4 Robin Stephenson of Alabama 6-1, 3­6, 6-4 in the first round. She came back to split two three­set decisions in the consolation bracket, defeating Stephanie Kusano of California before falling to Yelsey. 
Louderback was 
impressed by 
"They are a

well and had her chances at 4-4 in the third, but could­Jay Louderback n't pull it out. The 
Irish head coach 

match [against Yesley] was also a really good match and really tight. Catrina had a very good weekend." 
While the Thompsons took on the field at the National Indoor tournament, the rest of the No. 24 Irish competed at the Midwest Blast hosted by the University of Illinois. The tournament was a simulated dual format, consisting of round robin dual matches against Louisville, Wisconsin and Illinois. While team scores were not kept, individual results counted for ranking purposes.The Irish posted a 27-7 record at the tournament, including 10-2 in doubles. 
Four Notre Dame players posted perfect 6-0 records, including senior Kelly Nelson, sophomore Brook Buck and freshmen Katie Potts and Kelcy Tefft. 
Assistant Coach Michelle Dasso, who coached the team at the Midwest Blast, was pleased with the effort and singled out Buck as excelling this weekend. 
"Brook played extremely well," she said. "This was an important tournament for her because her confidence was 
[Statsny] 
down a little during the fall. We need Brook playing her best for us to do well in the spring." 
Dasso thought things went accord­ing to plan on the doubles side. 
"We knew our 
doubles was a strength of our team, and they were 
solid this weekend," the coach said. "Kiki and Lauren 
[Connelly] lost 8-6 to Illinois' number one team, but they played well in that match. They had their chances up 6-5, and even though they lost it was a good match for them. No one else really challenged us apart from that match." 
Dasso also liked the attitude Tefft and Potts brought to the court this weekend. 
"It was important for them to get experience in the dual 

match format, because that is how the spring will be," she said. "They were laid-back and relaxed, and that's the attitude you need to have to succeed." 
The weekend action conclud­ed the fall season for the Irish women, one that was high­lighted by the Thompsons' grand slam title, the first in Notre Dame history. 
The Irish have high expecta­tions for the spring with a tal­ented group of freshmen and experience at the top of their line-up. 

Louderback knew, however, that there was room for improvement during the win­ter off-season. 
"Each player has a specific area they need to work on individually," he said. "We'll do that at the end of the fall here and hopefully we'll be where we want to be when the spring comes."

St. John's freshman mid­finlder Garry Lewis scored the game's only goal in the 78th minute of play. Senior midfielder Jeff Carroll took a free kick from midf'ield and found senior defender Billy Hole in the box. llole sent the ball to Lewis, who headed it past Irish goalkeeper Chris Cahill to give St. John's the lead. 
The two teams battled to a standstill for much of the first half. with neither side coming up with many scoring oppor­tunities. With 35 seconds remaining in the half, though, the Irish received a big break. St. John's midf'ielder Snbastian Alvarado-Halph was given a red card for elbowing Notre Dame senior defender Ben Crouse in the head. St. John's would have to play the rest of the game with one fewer man on the field than the Irish. 
Playing a man up, Notre Dame began controlling play. The Irish held the ball for much of the second hall", and Irish forwards Joe Lapira and Justin McGeeney had scoring chances for the Irish. The St. John's defense proved strong, though, and thwarted the Irish advances. 
"In the second half, I thought wn wnre really taking control of the game," Clark said. "It was looking as though if a goal was scored, it was going to be us that was going to get it. But we didn't." 
Clark attributed thn loss partly to the great home-fi1~ld advantage held by the Hnd Storm. St. John's plays very well on its turf. 
"It's very fast, and it makns for a very direct game," Clark said. "And they do that better than any team." 
Midf'ielder Alex Yoshinaga led the Irish with four shots. 
Clark said Yoshinaga stood out as having a particularly strong ganw.

eight. 

In the final game against For only the second time the Panthers, the Irish led this season, the No. 5 Notre 10-8. The Panthers then 
the Irish had only 32 kills on 
.042 hitting. The reason'? Pittsburgh made adjust­
ments. In the first two gamns, the 
Dame volleyball team (22-2, 11-1 Big East) lost. 
Sunday, the Irish -who had won 15 consecutive matches --fell at Pittsburgh (16-9, 9-3 Big East) 30-23, 30-15, 27-30. 28-30, 13-15. 
Saturday the Irish beat West Virginia in Morgantown 30-22, 30-20, 30-17, which kept alive their win streak for just one more day. 
Senior Lauren Brewster led the Irish in both matches with 17 kills on .481 hitting against the Mountaineers and 20 kills on .364 hitting against the Panthers. 
Fellow seniors Lauren Kelbley and Carolyn Cooper added 16 kills and nine kills, went on a 6-1 tear to take a commanding 14-11 lead. Notre Dame cut the lead to 14-13 but fell when Stasiuk uncharacteristically deliv­ered a service error. On the day, the Irish had only three service aces but 14 service errors. 
Pitt coach Chris Beerman must have said something fiery during the intermission between the second and third games. 
The Irish had what looknd like an insurmountabln lmtd, but the Panthers stormed back. 
In the first two games, the Irish pounded 33 kills on .342 hitting. After the break, Panthers rogistered only two blocks but blocked 15 spikos in the final three games. 
The loss ended what was the seeond-longest winning­streak in program history for Notre Damn. It was the longest undnr coach l>nbhin Brown. 
Despite the loss, the Irish remain tied for first plaee in the Big East with Louisville. If the two squads are tied heading into the Big East tournament, the Irish would receive thn top seed beeause of thnir win ovnr the Cardinals two weekends ago.

of what that play could have been," she said. "It happened three other times right before that, and it just wasn't happening for us. At least we were creating the opportunities and [put] it in." 
After surrendering its third goal, Connecticut regrouped and tried to mount an offensive attack to cut into the Irish lead. 
But the Irish defense, led by Kim Lorenzen and Candace Chapman, prevented the Huskies from capitalizing on their chances. Despite controlling the ball for most of a 10-minute stretch in the middle of the second half, Connecticut failed to sustain a prolonged attack deep in the Irish zone. 
Lorenzen redirected several crosses from her position at the center of the defense, and Chapman, the right back, marked the Connecticut forwards closely on her side of the field. 
Waldrum said Chapman's ability to sustain a high energy of play for the entire game gives the Irish a decided advantage. 
"I think she's kind of found her rhythm again as the oul<>ide back ... after playing up front for us last year," Waldrum said. "She's just so composed and she's just such a weapon coming out of the back." 
The Irish offense complemented the team's defense in the second half, cashing in on opportunities it gained after the defense forced Connecticut turnovers. 
Senior forward Maggie Manning scored her eighth goal of the year to give Notre Dame a 4-0 lead with 17 minutes remaining in the game. Thorlakson led Manning with a long pass to the right before Manning converted a one­on-one opportunity past a lunging Labbe. 
Less than four minutes later, Susan Pinnick gave the Irish the 5-0 lead that would stand as the game's final score. Pinnick took a pass from Amanda Cinalli, faked left and netted her sixth goal of the season on the right side. 
Notre Dame 3, Marquette 0 
Notre Dame earned a spot in the title game with a 3-0 semifinal victory over Marquette Friday night in a redemption game for the Irish. 
The Golden Eagles embarrassed Notre Dame earlier this year with a 4-1 drubbing at Valley Field but had little success mounting an attack Friday. 
Waldrum said the team's suc­cess Friday was a result of post­season experience rather than revenge as motivation. 
"You can't put all your energy into thinking about a revenge game and things like that," Waldrum said. "We've been in this situation of pressure-packed post­season games so many times, and our players know what it takes to perform at a high level when it matters the most." 
The healthy and rested Irish, playing with junior defender Lorenzen, dominated the game from start to finish. 
Lorenzen, who sat out both Irish losses this year for health reasons, centered the defense against Marquette and stifled the Golden Eagles' attack. 
Waldrum said the presence of Lorenzen in the center of the backfield altered the course of Friday's game compared to the teams' previous meeting. 

"We didn't make the excuses because of the injuries [after the loss]," Waldrum said. "[But] we weren't quite the way we would normally be on our back line [without Lorenzen)." 
With Notre Dame's 3-0 victory Friday and 5-0 shutout Sunday, the Irish are now 15-0-0 in games in which Lorenzen starts, with a 76-3 goal advantage in those eon­tests. 
On the offensive side, Thorlakson opened the scoring for Notre Dame at 31:13 with goal No. 16 of the season for the senior. 
Jen Buczkowski, who was named conference midfielder of the year at the Big East awards banquet Thursday, assisted on Thorlakson's goal and scored one of her own 9:44 into the second half. 
Hanks reached the 60-point milestone in Notre Dame's 20th game just 10 minutes later. With assists from Annie Schefter and Lizzie Reed, the freshman tied Anne Makinen's team record of 23 goals in her freshman season and sealed the game for the Irish. 
Notes 
+ 
With Thorlakson's second assist, she and Hanks became just the fourth duo of teammates in NCAA history with 60 points each in a season. Thorlakson (16G­28A) said she takes more pride in their accomplishments as a tan­dem than in her individual stats. 

"I love playing with her," Thorlakson said of Hanks. "It's great that we can put those num­bers up together." 

+ 
Notre Dame scored three or more goals for the eighth straight game Sunday and extended its winning streak to 10 since its September loss to Marquette. The eight straight games of three or more goals ties a school record. 

"We've been good offensively all year," Waldrum said. "We've got a lot of weapons if we can get them all clicking at the same time." 

+ 
With the two weekend victo­ries, Notre Dame avenged losses to the only two Big East teams to defeat the Irish since 2003. The Irish fell to the Huskies in the 2004 conference title game, 2-1.

The Irish trailed 6-3 after a well-executed Michigan two­on-one by T.J. Hensick and Andrew Cogliano ended with a one-timer to the right side by Hensick past diving Irish goalie David Brown (23 saves) 12:31 into the third. 
Notre Dame responded immediately with pressure on the Michigan defensive zone, and the Wolverines were caught on their heels. In a span of 23 seconds, the Irish cut Michigan's lead to 6-5 and placed themselves in position to take back a game that had been the Wolverines' to own. 
Freshman Garrett Regan deposited the puck past Michigan goaltender Noah Ruden (26 saves) on a fast break down the left side at 
15:13 into the third. Regan deked towards the right on Ruden before pulling the puck back and around to the left post, where he slid the puck along the ice past a sprawling Ruden. 
Fellow freshman Erik Condra went head-first for the win and the goal to put it at 6-5 on a breakaway. Condra broke hard towards the Michigan net, but was tripped up. 
He managed to light the lamp while laying prone, just before crashing into the right post.

coach Red 

Berenson said. "We didn't play good team hockey in the third period. We found a way to win the game, but we can't be happy with our game." 
The Irish set the tone early in the game when they took a 1-0 lead only 18 seconds after the puck dropped. Notre Dame won the faceoff and charged into the Wolverine zone. Wallace attempted a wrap­around that led to a mad scramble for the puck in front of the net, where Matt Amado buried the puck for the goal. 
Michigan followed that up with four unanswered goals, three on the power play, between the midway points of the first and second periods. Freshman Travis Turnbull tied the game at 1-1 halfway through the first during a scramble in front of Brown on a power play. And with less than a minute left in the first, Wolverine Chad Kolarik beat Brown low and away on a hard snap shot. 
Jason Bailey and Brandon Naurato tallied a goal apiece in the first half of the second to put Michigan at 4-1. The Irish answered with Wallace's power play goal, but then allowed Michigan to put the game at 5-2 on a Kevin Porter shot less than three minutes into the third. 
The momentum swung towards the Irish yet again when Mike Walsh took control of the puck along the right side of the boards in front of Michigan's net. 
Walsh turned and fired a hard wrist shot towards Ruden and beat the goalie high to cut the lead to 5-3 at 7:16 into the period. 
The game remained dead­locked until the scoring explo­sion in the latter half of the third. 
"In hockey you can't get too high or too low or else you're in trouble," Condra said of the back-and-forth nature of the game. "You get too low, and they score a couple of goals, 
and  you're just down.  We  
stayed pretty calm  on  the  
bench and  came  back.  It's  

tough going back and forth with all the emotion shifts." 
Michigan 4, Notre Dame 2 
The special teams trouble that plagued the Irish on Friday night continued into Saturday as the team traveled to Michigan for the second half of the series. 
Michigan (7-1-1 overall) pre­vailed over Notre Dame 4-2 and swept the two-game sea­son series while scoring three power play goals on six chances. 
The Irish gave the nod to freshman goalie Jordan Pearce to start between the pipes, and he made 25 saves on the night. 
A two-goal second period for the Wolverines insured the loss that moved the Irish to 1-5-0 on the year. 
Kolarik found the back of the net at 15:10 into the second on the bane of Notre Dame's exis­tence -the power play -to put the game at 3-2 in Michigan's favor. Hensick fol­lowed up with a goal of his own 1:22 later to cap the scor­ing at 4-2. 
Michigan got on the board first, just five minutes into the first period, on a power play goal by Cogliano, but was soon evened up with an Amado goal. 
Amado was assisted by Wallace on the rebound goal at 
6:34. The Irish took their sec­ond lead in two nights at 11:34 into the first on a Michael Bartlett shot. The lead would remain 2-1 in Notre Dame's favor until 19:55 into the peri­od. 
Kolarik notched his third goal in two games and tied the game up at 2-2 on an open net rebound. 
The Irish will host Bowling Green in two straight home games, starting Thursday night at 7:35p.m.

Sunday slaughter 
Thorlakson leads Irish to first conference title since 2001 
By KEN FOWLER 
Sports Writer 
MILWAUKEE, Wise. -Katie Thorlakson finally added a post­season Big East Championship to her resume. 
The two-time conference offen­sive player of the year, who also picked up national player of the year honors last season from three soccer publications, led the No. 5 Irish Sunday to a 5-0 victory over rival Connecticut for Notre Dame's first conference tourna­ment victory since 2001. 
"I was getting to the point where it never thought it was going to happen," the senior said. "It's good ]and] it's good that we won so handily." 
In front of just 418 fans at blus­tery Valley Fields on the campus of Marquette University, Thorlakson secured tournament offensive MVP honors with two assists and a corner kick to set up another Irish goal against the No. 15 Huskies. · 
With 20 minutes remaining in the first half, Thorlakson sent a corner kick from the right side that drifted back towards the net amidst the heavy Milwaukee wind. Connecticut goalie Stephanie Labbe blocked junior Christie Shaner's one-time header, but freshman Brittany Bock found the net on the rebound to give the Irish a 2-0 advantage with 19:17 remaining in the first half. 

"It was hard because the wind's really high today, so I was just try­ing to putr it up a little higher because I know Shaner can out­jump pretty much anyone," Thorlakson said. 
Notre Dame, whose victory extended its winning streak to 224 games when it takes a 2-0 lead, remained aggressive even with the early advantage. The Irish bench kept the first line's quick tempo and forced Connecticut to play on its heels all 90 minutes. 
Irish head coach Randy Waldrum said Notre Dame's tal­ent on its second line makes it more like a hockey second line than the usual soccer substitution. 
"I think you could see today our depth came on and did a great job for us," Waldrum said. "Those kids, any [time] ... we've changed them, we haven't skipped a beat." 
Freshman standout Kerri Hanks extended the Irish lead to three and picked up goal No. 24 on the season -a new Irish freshman record -with a tap-in of a Thorlakson cross 20:15 into the second half. 
Thorlakson said she was not surprised she and Hanks com­bined for the goal. 
"That was like the fourth replay

Team falls to St. John's 1-0 
By KEVIN BRENNAN 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame was out for redemption. 
On Sept. 16, the Irish were badly outplayed at St. John's in a 2-1 loss to the Red Storm. Notre Dame headed into Saturday night's rematch in the second round of the Big East Tournament looking for a much better result this time around in New York. 

But despite playing a very competitive game, the Irish fell to the Red Storm 1-0 and were eliminated from the Big East Tournament. 
"We played fairly well," Notre Dame head coach Bobby Clark said. "We certainly played better than the last

Irish drop two wild games to Wolverines 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 

The sold-out crowd packed into the Joyce Athletic Center Friday night played witness to an electric, momentum­shifting game punctuated with goals fit for the highlight reel -and plenty of them ­in a thrilling 8-5 loss to the Michigan Wolverines. 
Notre Dame had to battle from behind against the No. 3 Wolverines most of the night, trailing by a 4-1 margin in the second stanza and then by 5-2 and 6-3 during the third period. 
But the Irish refused to give up and fought back to put the game at 6-5 with slightly more than four minutes remaining in regulation, before Michigan was able to put the game away with its seventh goal. 
"We competed hard down the stretch," Irish associate head coach Paul Pooley said. "It was a pleasure to watch, because that is what Coach [Jeff1 Jackson has been talk­ing about since day one: com­peting, competing, competing and never-say-die, and we showed that tonight." 
The Irish struggled mightily on the penalty kill, allowing four power play goals on the first five Michigan chances ­the Wolverines had seven total man-advantages. Michigan has thrived on the power play this season, con-
