Falls City, pop. 5,400, is tucked in the southeast corner of Nebraska, about five miles north of the' Kansas line and some 10 miles west of Missouri. It's a quiet place, with little crime and not much excitement, according to the dis­patcher in the sheriff's office. 
"We're a typical Midwestern county seat town with its feet firmly planted in agriculture," said John Morehead, president of the Richardson County Bank & Trust Co. 
Utilities are 22.9 percent lower than the average of cities surveyed. 
Bill Neidfeldt, manager of the Falls City Chamber of Commerce, says the town owns and operates its own power plant. 
The local movie house charges $1.75, and it costs $1.50 to see a high school football game. 
Falls City has some light industry, mostly farm-related. There's a meat processing plant, a manu­facturer of grain handling equip­ment and a cabinet maker in town.

Oil industry strikes 
Political prisoners to be freed 
, TEHRAN Iran [AP]-In an apparent move to curb strikes and stem the ·tide of anti-government riots, Justice Minister Hussein Najafi announced yesterday that all political prisoner in Iran will be freed ·nee. 10. Meanwhile, a strike hy 37,000 oil refinery workers cut Iran's huge oil export flow by more than half even though some employees of the National Iranian Oil Co. began returning to their jobs. The oil workers' demands include more money and freedom for political prisoners. The announcement that the government would free the prison­ers came as reports poured into the capital of new strikes and more violent demonstrations across the country. Authorities said 23 anti-govern­ment protesters were killled and at . least 56 injured in clashes with troops or supporters of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in ZZarshahr, 348 miles southwest of 
, the capital. The demonstrators demanded the release of persons jailed for their oppositon to the shah, Iran's imperial ruler. The rioters, incited by Moslem religious leaders, have clashed with Iranian security forces despite the government's martial law declaration, issued in Sep­tember, that affects 12 cities, including Tehran. Tens of thousands of persons paraded in the streets of Tehran yesterday to express their joy over the release of a religious leader·. At Tehran University, 20,000 students gathered peacefully on the campus to shout anti-shah slogans and mix with opposition political leaders. 
Midwest Blues Festival features John Lee Hooker 
by Tom Jackman Staff Reporter 

The Midwest Blues Festival, the first of many events sponsored this year by the Student Union Cultural Arts Commission (CAC), begins this Friday at 7:30 p.m. in Stepan Center. 
A two-day pass to the festival costs $7, $6 for Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. Admission is $4 for Fliday night only, and $5 for Saturday. 
The festival is an annual attrac­tion which, according to director Bob Kissell, "has brought in nearly every top blues act in the country since 1970," including Muddy Waters last season, and Albert King, Otis Rush and Houndog Taylor in past years. This year's cast features Albert 
Collins,  Dr.  Ross  the  Harmonica  
Boss  and  headliner  John  Lee  
Hooker.  

The event, which has packed Stepan Center in the last few years,

Iran's troubles began early this year when conservative Moslems started demonstrations against the shah's reforms that gave greater freedom to women and redistri­buted church lands to peasants. They contend the reforms go against the teachings of the Koran, the Moslem holy book. Leftists and intellectuals have led riots demand­ing more political freedom and an end to martial law. 
Najafi said all political prisoners would be released on Dec. 10, the day the United Nations celebrates human rights. He did not say how many persons would be freed. It appeared that persons jailed for inciting public unrest in the nation­wide demonstrations that have killed 1,000 people since January would win their freedom, but not those convicted of violent politically motivated crimes. 
Officials of the National Iranian Oil Co. said production had dropped dramatically because of the strike. Iran normally exports 5 million barrels of oil daily, but that

NHTSA reports on Pinto crash 
WASHINGTON [AP]· A van 
driver who momentarily took his 
eyes off the road to look for 
cigarettes caused a fiery rear-end 
crash that killed three teen-age 
women in a 1973 Ford Pinto car in 
northern Indiana, a federal safety 
agency reported yesterday. 

The National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration said the 
explosion of the auto's fuel tank in 
the Aug. 10 collision was caused by 
the same problem that resulted in a 
recall of all 1971 to 1976 Pinto and 
Mercury Bobcat sedans. 

Ford Motor Co. has been indic­ted by an Indiana grand jury on criminal charges in connection with ·the accident, which occurred on 
U.S. 3 near Dunlop, Ind. 

The NHTSA report, while not concluding whether Ford was at fault in the crash, said the fire definitely caused the death of the Pinto's driver and probably the two

NHTSA said the driver of the Pinto was pulling off the road to check a gasoline odor when the auto was struck from behind the van, traveling about SO mph. The van pushed the Pinto 168 feet as the gasoline ignited. Robert Duggar, 21, Goshen, the driver of the van, suffered broken ribs and other injuries. 
The van driver "said he saw the 
flasher lights of the  Pinto ahead  
and  assumed  the  vehicle  was  
moving  at  his  own  speed,"  the  
safety  agency said.  "He looked  

down for a package of cigarettes, and as he looked up he saw the Pinto just in front of him. There was no evidence of pre-impact manuever or braking by the van, following this momentary lapse of attention." 
NHTSA investigators "cited this inattention as a definite cause of the accident, with the absence of emergency stopping as a probably contributing cause," the report said. 

A county grand jury in Elkhart, lnd, said it did not indict Duggar because "although he may have been negligent in his conduct at or prior to the time of the :::ollision, we do not believe that his conduct constituted a criminal act.'' 
The grand jury indicted Ford Motor Co. on three counts of reckless homicide and one count of criminal recklessness in connection with the accident. 
The grand jury said Ford knew the Pinto fuel tank was unsafe and did nothing about it. Ford called the indictments unwarranted. 
The Pinto in which the girls died, was one of 1.5 million Pinto and Mercury Bobcat sedans that Ford agreed in June to recall because NHTSA said the fuel tanks leaked too much fuel in rear-end crasb 
The Princeton University grad­uate gained notoriety as· a con­sumer advocate in the 60's with his indictment of the Chevrolet Corvair in a publication titled "Unsafe at Any Speed." General Motors cancelled production of the compact Corvair due largely to Nader's efforts.

the crash was a severe one, it 
ts another example of a Pinto crash and fire" which resul­ted in the recall. 
"The filler pipe was pulled out of the tank, and the fuel tank was penetrated by parts of the Pinto's understructure," the agency said. 
'These are considered typical of Pinto fuel tank problem." After agreeing to the recall, Ford

Court protects job of swearing employee 
CIDCAGO, Ill. [AP]· Swearing at a taxpayer is not grounds to fire a state employee, the Illinois Appellate Court says. 
On Monday, the court upheld a Circuit Court ruling that the reasons Pearl K. Fox, 52, was dismissed were "trivial." 
Shews fired in December 1975, and her firing was upheld by the State Civil Service Commission but overtuned by a circuit court judge, after she allegedly swore at officers of a vending company while trying to determine if they were operating illegally. 
She said they swore at her first.

I have a confession to make: I don't like Nestle Crunch chocolate bars, and wouldn't go near Nestea. It is certainly no hardship for me to give up Nestle products. Nevertheless, I am interested in the possibility that the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Hunger Coalition may urge a boycott of Nestle products by joining IFACf (Infant Formula Action Coalition) and ICCR (the Interfaith Center· for Corporate Responsibility).

Political Commercial 
~====================~rtbuchwald 
ASIDNGTON--Have you ever 

ondered how a political television ommercial is made? Probably not, 
ut I'm going to tell you.anyway. 
"Okay, everybody quiet on the set. Where's Sen. Nobody? All right, this commercial will show what a great family man you are. Put on this cardigan sweater and sit in that stuffed chair by the fire­place ... Lady, you'll have to get out of here, I'm shooting a commer­cail." 
"I'm the senator's wife," 
"Oh yeh, well, we'll need you in this one. You can stay. Let's see, why don't we sit you next to the senator, looking at him with ador­ing eyes?" 
''I've never done any acting before." 
"Well, just pretend you're sit­ting next to Robert Redford or Paul Newman." 
"Should I say anything to him in the commercial?" 
"What do you want to say?" 
"I just want to ask when I'll see 

im again. This is the first time 
've had a chance to talk to him in 
o months.'' "No, don't ask that. Just look at im as if he's the greatest guy in 
he world." "It's not going to be easy." "Well, fake it! Now where are 
he kids?" 

''I could only get two out of the 
four. Marsha and Larry wouldn't 
come." 

"Why not?" 
"Marsha's mad at her father, 
and Larry ran away from home two 
weeks ago." 
All right, we'll have to make do 
with two of the four. Put the kids 
on the rug at their Daddy's feet. 
Each kid could hug a leg." 
"Children, the man wants you to 
sit at Daddy's feet and hug him." 
"Which one's our Daddy?" 
"The man sitting in the large chair wearing the cardigan sweat­
er." 

"Ifwe hug him will he hurt us?'' 
"No, children. This is for a TV commercial. He won't get mad, at all." 
"Quiet on the set. Where's the dog? I though we were going to have the senator's pet dog in this commercial.'' 
"Our dog ran away with Larry." 
"Good grief. S10mebody go out in the street and drag in a dog.'' 
"What kind of dog, boss?" 
"Who cares what kind of dog? Just so it will hold still till we get this thing shot. Okay, lady now look at the senator. Please no scowling ... Could I have a smile? Not a bitter smile--a loving wife smile. Try to think of all the happiness you'll have when your 
husband gets elected. You're 
scowling again. All right then, 
think how nice it will be if he gets 
defeated...That's beter... Now 
you've got it. Kid, start hugging _your Daddy's knees." "I got the dog boss." "Okay, throw him down by the 
fireplace. Senator, pretend this is what you do every night when you get home. You gather your family around you and read to them from the Constitution ... Then look up and read whatever is on the tele­prompter. You got it? Roll the cameras.'' 
"Hi, I'm Sen. Nobody and this is my family. And this is my dog Laddie. You may think politicians are different from other people, but we're just plain folks like each one of you out there. We laugh, we try, and we worry about the future of our country. I care about my family and my dog Laddie, and that's why I want to see you vote for me on Election Day." 
"Cut. We're going to have to do it again. Go out and find another dog that won't chew · up the Constitution of the United States."

Improvement: an· individual step 
Dear Editor: On October 16, WSND aired a show entitled "Sex at Notre Dame", during which, students discussed the social situation. Unfortunately, the program accom­plished nothing. Every year the same question arises: How can students (or anyone else) inprove the social situation, particularly male-female interaction? As I see the problem, the es~ential question is not How, but IS IT POSSIBLE to improve the social situation at Notre Dame? Intelligence, independence, and achievement characterize ND fe­males. Academically, these char­acteristics are admirable. How­ever, these characteristics tend to inhibit the development of social relationships. Many males are intimidated by such authoritative females. The social situation is a result of university policy, particularly acad­emic policy. Rather than blame a particular sex, or make futile attempts to improve social life, students must understand why the situation exists and why it is unchangeable. Improvement in male-female relationships can only occur in individual cases and not campuswide. 
J. Eric Bauwens 

Embarrassingposition 
Deu Editor: I write with regard to the position of the Notre Dame trustees con­cerning South African stock policy. I am embarrassed. Because Notre Dame is an institution nurtured with a Christian tradition, one would ex­pect Notre Dame to pioneer the withdrawal of investments from a corrupt society. Rather, in the same breath that' refuse to divest, . we are assured that the profits in South Africa are minimal. What consolation is this? The Sullivan plan harbors pro­mise but ignores the causal source of the tragedy. A segregation of peoples in every sense of the word, is not a realistic approach to life, 
especially when this segregation involves a one-sided share of the wealth. The Sullivan plan does nothing to condemn apartheid, a system that refuses citizenship to a majority of the South African populace. Robert L. Wilmouth (;!}aims, "West Germany 10r Japan or some other foreign country will just take our place.'' That is one unacceptable justification. Notre Dame might as well commit the crime of morality rather than to alllow someone else to procure the profits. 
We all know that the university is in dire need of a larger budget. The part that saddens me most is correspondance with my state school friends. They often chided me about attending a university that still considered courses in theology and morals requisite in the curriculum. Yet many of these "pagan" state schools have with­drawn all South African invest­ments, while Our Lady's school intends to increase investments in a rascist country. 
Kevin P. Ceary P.S. The secrecy of these invest­ments does little for my conscience.

Dear Editor: 
The task force for the Urban Plunge and I want to thank the Observer for your collaboration in presenting the Urban Plunge to the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students this year. We especially appreciated your editorial. We have had 264 students apply for the Plunge and 234 have participated in an orientation workshop. Students will be visiting 36 cities in 46 different visiting groups. Thanks again for enabling us to contact the many students who will benefit from this form of experient­ial learning during January.

African conflict flares as 

Am in annexes part of Tanzania 
DARES SALAAM Tanzanla[AP]­
Ugandan President ldi A min 
claimed yesterday he has annexed 
a 710-square-mile strip of 
Tanzanian territory along the west­
ern shore of Lake Victoria amid 
reports of fierce ·fighting between 
troops of the Two East African 
nations. 
A Radio Uganda broadcast mon­
itored here quoted a military 
spokesman as saying the annexat­
ion was accomplished with "Super­
sonic speed," and was in retaliat­
ion for Tanzania's alleged attack on 
Uganda last week. 
The military spokesman, believed to be Amin himself, declared the new boundary ·be­tween the states as the Kagera River, about 20 miles south of the original border. 
The annexation announcement was Uganda's first official confir­mation that its forces, which have both Soviet and British equipment, had invaded Tanzanian territory and that clashes were taking place with Tanzanian security forces, which have some Soviet equipment. 
Tanzanian government sources said clashes between an undis­closed number of Tanzanian sold­iers and 2,000 to 3,000 Ugandan troops, backed by tanks and heavy artillery, were centered near the town of Kyaka. 
Kyaka is located on the Kagera River. The river flows eastward into Lake Victoria, which is bord­ered on the east by Kenya. 
Tanzanian sources said troops had been rushed to the battle area and the government, apparently preparing for a protracted war, began requisitioning private and government-owned trucks and buses to aid in ferrying troops and supplies. 
Reports on the fighting came from government statements and broad­
casts  for  which  there  was  no  
independent confirmation.  
Amin  charged  repeatedly  last  

week that Tanzanian forces, backed by Cubans, had crossed the front­ier. Tanzania officially scoffed at the claims. 
On Tuesday, however, Tanzania announced that Ugandan soldiers crossed their border at the towns of Minziro, Kakunya and Mutukala on 
Mondayand that "heavy fighting" was taking place. 
The low-lying, scrub-covered area Uganda claims to have seized from Tanzania is dotted with scattered settlements and isolated trading centers. 
The residents are primarily subsistence farmers who raise bananas, manioc and beans in the leached, red tropical soil and keep

S~ith pleads insanity 1n Bostock murder case 
CROWN POINT Ind. (AP)­
Leonard Smith charged with the shotgun slaying of California Angels outfielder Lyman Bostock, yesterday pleaded innocent by reason of insanity. 

Lake Criminal Court Judge Andrew Giorgi appointed two psy­chiatrists to examine Smith, 31, and he set trial for next March 12. 
Bostock, 27, who was visiting relatives in Gary after a game with the Chicago White Sox, was slain six weeks ago while riding with his uncle and two women in a car. 
One of the women was Smith's estranged wife, Barbara, 26, who police believe may have been-the target of the shotgun blast that killed Bostock. 
Mrs. Smith was struck by some of the shotgun pellets but was later released from a Gary hospital. Her sister, Joan Hawkins, and 
1lostock's uncle, Thomas Turner, were not hit. 
Police said Smith and his es­tranged wife apparently had quar­reled before the incident. 
The examination of Smith, by Leslie Gombus and Frank Hogle, Gary area psychiatrists, is expected to take about three weeks. 

Leader and Weston works on display in art gallery 
Major exhibits currently on dis­play in Notre Dame Art Gallery include two new exhibitions, "Marinescapes" of Robert Leader, and "Edward Weston's Gifts to his Sister." Another current display is "Sculpture from the East." 
Leader's one-man show of 20 paintings reflect his maritime interests. Included are five Mal­tese paintings, a Hawaiaan theme, an allegorical painting of the unicorn, and memories of vast armadas of graceful ships quietly at anchor. 
Leader is senior professor of art at Notre Dame where he has taught painting and history of art since 1953. He grew up in the shipbuilding city of Quincy, MA, spent his summers on Cape Cod and served in the Pacific with the Marines. 
A graduate of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Yale and the University of Illinois, he has been awarded major commissions as a muralist and designer of stained glass in area churches. He was recently commissioned by the Vat­ican to serve as liturgical artist in the rebuilding of the war damaged Church of Our Lady of Jerusalem in Israel. 
Weston's exhibit of photographs includes prints from his extended visits to Mexico, landscapes from his favorite refuge at Point Lobos, CA. the steel mills of Middleton, OH, and the scenic San Francisco harbor.

Four 1978 Notre Dame grad­uates, have recently completed a five week orientation program for a year of volunteer service in Sao Paulo, Brazil. These four women will be working with the Sisters of the Holy Cross as Lay Associates. 
Mission Coordinator Sr. Madeline Therese, explained that this work will entail teaching poor children and distributing food and clothing to the needy in Sao Paulo and surrounding areas. 
In return, the C.S.C. Sisters provide the women with transpor­tation to and from Brazil, health insurance, and a salary to compen­sate for living expenses. Each of the four women will live with a Brazilian family during their stay. The families are in the lower­middle class range. 
During the five weeks of orien­tation which took place at Saint Mary's College, the women studied Portugese, Brazil's culture, his­tory, and geography, the role of the Church in Latin America, and the role of today's lay Christians. 
Nancy Cashman, who majored in English and Theology at Notre Dame, said, "I found out about the importance of experiencing a cul­

Schneider, who studied Govern­me It as an undergraduate, said that she also hoped to help wealthy Brazilian students gain an under­standing of the "fravellas" (slums). "I believe that this program is an excellent opportunity to share with those that have not been blest with the goods of education and family. However I am very aware that the Brazilians we encounter will have alot more than we do in some 
resp·~cts,"  said  Virginia  Dwyer,  
who majored in Theology.  
Griffin  and  Cashman  plan  to  

devote their time to teaching on the outskirts of Sao Paulo. Dwyer and Schneider plan to spend their time doing social work at the Center for Human Promotion in Telemaco

AOH sets up scholarship 
A $60,000 undergraduate scholarship fund at Notre Dame for children of members of the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) was announced following a recent meeting on campus to plan the raising of $1.3 million by the AOH to endow the University's Center for the Study of American Catholicism. 
The scholarship will be set up when the $60,000 fund has been fully funded at the University and will be awarded on a competitive basis, according to Thomas McNabb, national AOH president. The recipient will most likely work as a student intern in the AOH secretariat, eventually to be located at Notre Dame. 
The bulk of the AOH endowment will underwrite an academic chair to be occupied by the director of the Center, and the rest will support activities of the Center, principally as they relate to the role of Irish-Americans in the history of the Catholic Church in the United States. 
Representatives of the Univer­sity, the AOH and AOH Ladies' Auxiliary determined that the goal 0 f $1.3 million would be actively sought over a period of three years, as discussed at the AOH national meeting last summer in Killarney, Ireland, with a fourth year set aside £or the completion of commitments. 
The creation of promotional materials as well as a national kickoff were other matters dis­cussed by the steering committee £or the Hibernian Fund, which elected National Director Alex B. McGarry as chairman; the Aux­iliary's National President Violet 
M. Forciea, vice chairman, and Auxiliary National Vice President sarah E. Murphy, secretary­treasurer. 
Jay P. Dolan, director of the Center for the Study of American Catholicism, -said the emphasis of the Center and of the Hibernian endowment were unique in Ameri­can higher education. 
Noting that Irish-American Catholics built the churches in which Catholics of all backgrounds now pray, Dolan said the Hibernian Fund would continue the Irish tradition of creating something not 0 nly meaningful to their own ethnic history but also something impor­tant for the entire Church. 
The Center for the Study of American Catholicism was formally established at Notre Dame in 1976, but the University's library and archival holdings relating to the history of the Church in the United states go back to the days of its 
t:ounding in 1842 and are among t he nation's most extensive 
holdings. The activities of the Center 

embrace four areas: instruction, research, publication and the col­lection of materials pertinent to the study of Amercan Catholicism. 
The Center publishes a news­letter and in conjunction with the Notre Dame Press sponsors a publication series, Notre Dame Studies in American Catholicism. The Center's Catholic Studies Seminars have attracted a number of working papers from young researchers in the field, and its research travel grants underwrite resident study in the University's library and archives.

Ferguson adds extra dimension to ND offense 

by Ray O'Brien Sports Editor 
At times Vagas Ferguson must wonder what Pete Bahan, Curly Lambeau, Dutch Bergman, Fritz Slackford, Norm Barry and Chet Wynne must have felt like 60 years ago when they were the "other" running backs on a team that boasted the immortal George Gipp. 
It must get lonely sometimes when you play next to a player that holds the all-time Notre Dame rushing record. 
"I respect Jerome Heavens be­cause he has established himself as a fine running back," offers Fer­guson. "I'm all for him and that's all there is to it." 
However, there is a lot more to it. Ferguson and Heavns use two very different styles to accomplish very similar and impressive re­sults. Both backs boast strength and the speed needed to get through the holes, but once they get the ball the similarities end. The different techniques serve to aid both runners in their job in addition to lending to the success of the offense. · "Because we have different styles," explains Ferguson, "we can keep the defense off balance. They can watch the game films but they still have to prepare for both of us." 
Truer words were never spoken and the statistics to date bear out the dilemna the defenses have faced. 
Jerome Heavens is the leading rusher with 590 yard, only one more yard than Ferguson's total and the junior halfback has carried the ball 11 fewer times. 
If the defense keys on one of the Irish's duo, the other breaks the long run to keep things honest. 
With a team like NO that likes to establish a running game, that is important. Against a team like Navy that ranks number one in the nation in scoring and total defense and held Pitt to negative 28 yards rushing last week, that is : 
down-right crucial! 

Vagas Ferguson 
[photo by Doug Christian] "Navy is going to be tough," assures the 6-1, 192 point break­away threat. ''What they lack in size, they make up for in speed. But we've played quick defenses before and I think we can run on anyone." Notre Dame will undoubtedly take it to the Midshipmen on the ground but if that stalls, Devine will call in the aerial attack and that does not exclude Ferguson from the picture. The junior stalwart has hauled in 14 passes for 109 yards, a total 


Bowl talk 

After Notre Dame's 49-0 crushing of Air Force last year, ABC's cameras focused on the Golden Dome during the halftime of a nationally televised game. Field Scovill, chairman of the Cotton Bowl committee, was about to make Moose Krause an offer he could not refuse--an invitation to the number-five ranked Irish to play Texas, the best in the land. Anticipation rose to a crescendo after a 48-10 pasting of Miami as many observers felt the game in Dallas would be for the national championship. And, on Jan. 2, only Irish eyes were smiling deep in the heart of Texas. 
When the green-and-gold clad gridders dropped their first two contests this fall, the outlook for trips to even the Gator or Fiesta Bowls was very bleak. If one were to pinpoint the exact turning point of the season, it would have to be the injury that befell Tim Huffman. It inspired the offensive line to blow away the massive Pitt line, giving Montana the time to find his receivers and rally the troops from a 17-7 deficit. Now, if Notre Dame can win the remainder of their games, a major bowl bid is imminent. To beat Navy, Dan and Merv are going to have to be more creative with their first-down play-caJling. The Middies held the Panthers to minus-28 yards rushing and may be keying on Heavens and Ferguson on first and ten. 
For those of you planning to spend New Year's Eve on Bourbon Street, don't be too hasty to make hotel reservations. Every redblooded good ole boy and all little blue nuns are psyched for another Alabama-Notre Dame blood-letting, but through a quirk in scheduling, the Tide does not play Georgia this year and the Bulldogs are a good bet to go to the Sugar Bowl. They need only to beat conference rivals Florida and Auburn to force the Sugar Bowl people to select them. This would not be as attractive as playing Alabama, but an 8-2 team goes where ·it is invited. 
It is also possible that Field Scovill will be back with contract in hand, trying totonvince us that it's not always 40 degrees in Dallas on New Year's Day. If Notre Dame goes to the Cotton Bowl, it will probably be to face a very underrated Houston club. Un­accountably, they lost their opener to Memphis St. but destroyed Texas A&M 33-0 and shocked Lou Holtz' Hogs, 20-9. Danny Davis, redshirted after an opening-game injury last year, calls signals for Houston, ljob he held two seasons ago when the Cougars sweptto a Cotton Bowl victory. Their showdown with Texas next week is in the Astrodome. 
Of course, the Big Eight champ receives a bid to the Orange Bowl, and it's likely they'll meet Penn. St. in Miami. Next week's · shootout in Lincoln will be a track meet, and Billy Sims of the Sooners can earn the Heisman Trophy in this game. Expect the rest of the gang--Thomas Lott, Kenny King, I.M. Hipp, Rick Berns, and dropback quarterback Tom Sorley to go wild, too. 
The leaves have not all fallen; Jack Frost has yet to pay a visit; still, it is not too early to speculate what games we'll be watching when 1979 tolls around.

'''becoming more involved in the passing game was a change,'' comments Ferguson. "It makes us more of a threat which in turn opens up the running game again." 
Whether its rushing or catching passes, the one category Ferguson does lead is scoring, the bottom line in any teams success. Through seven games the Richmond, In­diana native has crossed the goal line eight times (five running and three on passes.) The scrappy 
:::: Ray 0 'Brien 
underclassman has a knack for finding the goal line. He al~o has·a 
knack for getting better at doing whatever he's asked to do each game. 
Ferguson has improved in every category since his freshman year. Few realize how close the starting halfback is to Heavens' collegiate pace. Avoiding injury, this Cotton Bowl MVP will break into the top ten list of NO rushers if he can keep up the steady pace he has recorded to date. 
''Besides winning the National Championship, I've set a goal of attaining 1,000 yards," said Fer­guson. ''I've been somewhat satisfied with my play so far. If I can just stay healthy and do my job, my goals are still within reach." 
Despite Vagas' success, you can sense that he feels that he has more to offer. However, playing in the shadow of Jerome Heavens does not get in the way. In fact, Ferguson feels that although he and Heavens go about their jobs in different manners, there is much he has learned from the senior co-captain. ''I like to be considered

The subtle turnaround 
:=================~==========:=========:=:===:=====================:=:=:===:=============:=================================:=============================================================================:== The Irish Eye== 
Last year, the victory over USC marked a turning point of out with the old and in with the new. It changed the tide of a tumultuous early season as the Fighting Irish went on to manhandle six more opponents en route to the National Championship. 
Many Notre Dame followers were looking for a repeat after the come-from-behind victory; over Pittsburgh. But last year's script was a once-in-a-life­time story. If Notre Dame is to be successful, they are going to have to clear a new path. But this does not mean that the thriller against Pitt won't prove to be a focal point in the season. There has been a marked difference in Devine's team since that fourth quarter over two weeks ago. The trend has been established in the last two games but it is less obvious than last season's about face. 
The reason the change has been less noticeable is that it doesn't show up in the score, but nevertheless it will decide the fate of the 1978 Fighting Irish. In fact, it may be apparent in the Navy game for the first time. 
Last year, Notre Dame returned eleven starters on defense. The question mark for the year would be the performance of a more inexperienced offensive squad. After the offense managed only 103 points in the first five games, they rebounded against USC and totalled an amazing 278 points in the last six games. The turning point was obvious. 
This year the offense boasted the same backfield that was so successful in 1978 but the All-American defense has graduated. Several new faces saw action in the beginning of the year and got tested right away. 
The fruits that experience brings is beginning to show up and that young defensive squad might look back and decide that they came of age in the fourth quarter of the fifth game against the Panthers. 
Defensive All-American and captain Bob Golic noticed the difference at the Air Force game as he commented, "For the first time all year the defense played consistently. Before, we were stopping the opposition and then giving up big yardage. Today we controlled the line throughout the game." 
Fortunately, some new faces got to see action in the 
Air Force game and as the injuries pile up, that game experience will be invaluable. Golic has not been as dominating a factor in the Air Force and Miami game and that is not due to a lack of effort on his part, but is · a reflection of the improvement of the other 10 players 
in that defensive unit. 
The Falcons scored 15 points against the Irish. The first TD was set up by a long pass. After that, Notre Dame shut down the opponent's offense until with less than one minute remaining Air Force crossed the goal line again; but by then, the starters were on the bench with a victory in hand. 
The secsmdary has weathered an earlystorm as fans 
questioned their ability to stop the pass consistenly. 
Luther Bradley and Ted Burgmeier are gone but the 
big plays are still being made by the likes of Dave 
Waymer, Jim Browner and Joe Restic. 
A shutout against Miami lent credibility to the 
claim that the Irish defense had come of age. 
Shutouts are few and far between against any 
competition and besides proving that the defense is 
doing its job, it provides an emotional lift that does 
wonders for the confidence of improving players. 
At this point last year, Devine'-s team had allowed 86 points which is only eight less than ND's total to date. The turnaround for this team has come on defense and it looks as though the season may ride on the stinginess of the Irish defense in future games. The results are not as glamorous as the 40­plus-point performances recorded last year but it wins football games. 
This week's games provides an interesting challenge for Notre Dame's defense as they will be compared to the swarming defense of Navy that is rated number one statistically in the country. The game probably will be low scoring, so the better defense may tell the story in the final outcome. Look for Notre Dame's defensive trend to continue as the nation sees v,.:ho realiy has the better defense on the field at Cleveland Municipal Stadium this week. 

Field hockey team loses, 1-0 
by Kathy Campanella Sports Writer 

Last Tuesday evening, the Notre Dame women's field hockey team played their final home game of the season against Ball State Univer­sity, and were upset in a heart­breaker by a score of 1-0. 
Playing under the lights of Cartier field and in temperatures more suitable for ice hockey, both teams played well, considering the conditions. At the outset of the first half, the play was slow moving, but as time wore on it became a heated battle. Ball State, who was unaccustomed to playing on astroturf, did not appear handi­capped by this disadvantage. Their offense consistenly put together strong, organized attacks against the Irish. But, Notre Dame countered with an equally strong defense. Led by goalkeeper Mary Hums and sweeper Patti DeCoste, the Irish successfully contained each Ball State attack. Offensively, Notre Dame had initial difficulty in organizing an effective against the tough Ball State defense. How­ever, towards the end of the period, the Irish front line penetrated much more strongly and threatened the Ball State goal more often. 
The second half looked as though it would be a copy of the first half, as the back and forth play con­tinued. A tie seemed inevitable until 20:15 of the second period when Karen Lump scored for Ball State.
