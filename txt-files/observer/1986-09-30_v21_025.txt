iJn Brief 
The accident in which Notre Dame freshman Craig Gun­dersen was struck by a car is still under investigation, accor­ding to Chief Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Jane Becker of the St. Joseph County Prosecutor's Office. The alleged driver of the car that struck Gundersen has not been formally charged, Becker said. The student driver was arrested in connection with the accident by South Bend Police Saturday morning for driving while intoxicated. Hospital officials listed Gunderson in good condition Monday night. -The Observer. 
A mail order drug testing kit is available over-the-counter in Kansas. Each Aware Kit, developed by American Drug Screens of Dallas, contains a plastic specimen bottle, a mailing label and directions. The test, conducted at home, must be sent to a lab for analysis. The samples are tested for traces of drugs including cocaine, marijuana, and bar­biturates. Although the tests are meant to help parents, some say that they might have a harmful effect on the family, eroding trust among members. However, "In a business set­ting, the test has value," says one drug and alcohol abuse expert. Each kit costs $25. -The Observer

Ozone layer destruction continues as companies remain unconcerned 
Imagine my surprise when leafing through a 
newspaper, passing the news of the day and spot­
ting a headline: Scientists predict castastrophes 
in growing global heat wave. 
The word "predict" indicated that yet another group was foretelling the end of the world, one ofmany articles which fill the pages ofour nation's tabloids with headlines such as "Giant meteor to crush the world during the seventh game of the World Series." 
However, this prediction came from some of the nation's leading scientists in front of a Senate sub-committee and based on their findings "there is a very real possibility that man -through ignor­ance or Indifference or both -is irreversiblyalter­ing the ability ofour atmosphere to (support) life," according to Senator John Chafee. 
The particular environmental issue at stake here is the rising world temperatures and disappearing ozone layer which is believed to be occurring be­cause of the manufacturing of certain chemicals. 
Back in 1974 the theory that chlorofluorocar­bons destroy ozone in the atmosphere was sug­gested. However, the Industries argued for further research before production would be curtailed. 
The "greenhouse effect," warmer temperatures coupled with deteriorating ozone layers, left the public eye until the scientists' report was given in June. Meanwhile the temperatures kept rising and the ozone disappearing. 
The wait-and-see attitude of 12 years ago con­tinues by the companies involved. One corporate official advocates this approach since "continued release of CFC's will not pose a significant threat to the environment in the time required to gain a better understanding of the science." 
In looking at research done recently, however, the estimates of ozone deterioration are close to those done In 1974. If nothing else, they are worse. This wait-and-see attitude will not Improve the situation, but only make it worse. The time has come to stop meeting about the problem but to make demands upon the companies. 
In one of Louisiana's industrial areas, now known as the cancer cluster, an executive of one industry could not explain why levels of PCB's were 1 0 times higher by the drainage pipe of the company than anywhere else on the body ofwater. Of course, he could firmly state that the cancer causing substance was not from his company. When asked where it was coming from, he "didn't know." 
Human nature Is to look short-range at the prob­lems facing us and not consider the serious prob­lems which this type of thinking may cause. After generations of the majority looking this way, some of the actions are coming back to haunt us. 
Not only does this concern the environment, but also other areas, including the United States deficit. 
"But what will a few extra degrees do to the world? Castastrophes won't occur until after we're around." Ifthe current trend continues, however, 

Scott Bearby 
Viewpoint Editor 

In as little as 50 years significant flooding would take place, there would be a dramatic increase in skin cancer cases, and current agriculture areas would be threatened. 
Progress and profits are wonderful but a little caution now can keep the world healthier in the long run. With uncertainties and consequences as high as they are, there should not be the right to assume that there are no problems. It is necessary to be optimistic, but a realistic outlook has to exist or our world will continue to be in serious trouble. 
Industry has helped our nation and the world tremendously and continued technology is nec­essary to a better existence, but an emphasis must be placed on the future and not solely on tomor­row. 200 years ago our founding fathers had a concern for the strength of our nation, short term and long term. It seems we should give future inhabitants the same opportunity. 
If the current trends presented to the Senate sub-committee on the environment continue, our future generations 200 years from now will be confused about where Miami and New Orleans are since they will more than likely be underwater. 
The damage is already substantial, but steps can be made to improve the situation ifawareness and concern continue. We all must be careful of our short-term goals and must look long-term more. 
Hopefully, the scientists' prediction of catastrophe will be as unlikely as the giant meteor crashing at the World Series. It is solely up to us.

Liberals are wrong in opposing drug testing 
Judging strictly from their self-proclaimed, noble-sounding ideology, it 
would seem that the implemen tation of drug tests for federal employees would be a policy even more ideal for liberals than it would be for conservatives. And yet ironically this is not the case. 
Chris Julka 
in plain english 

As one would hear it from them, liberals -by this I mean, ofcourse, modern liberals of the Democratic Party, to be distin­guished from the classical liberals who compose the Republican Party -are the leading advocates of government actively participating in the lives of its citizens to make this society a better one. Isn't it the liberals who support desegregation measures such as busing, who have made it illegal not to hire a fixed quota of people belonging to certain government-defined minority groups?
r Isn't It the liberals who have imposed
r-
strict regulations on industries so as to protect the environment, who advocate large grants in student aid, and who favor the intervention of the government into households to rescue children from abusive parents? 
It would seem from all this that liberals are the champions of values, and believe E that they should take precedence over the system. People have rights, but not if these rights mean that other people must starve, that certain members of 
r
, minorities must be discriminated against, , or that our air must be unbreathable and our water undrinkable. In fact, the im­
r 
position of preconceived values on Amer­
r 
ican society goes even further than this. 
r ~ 
For the government has the right to see r to it or at least what those in power deem r to be appropriate values. Thus sex edu­
r 
cation should remain as a necessary part 
r 
of a youngster's curriculum In public 
r 
schools, liberals maintain, so as to shape one's mind and attitudes toward sex in

pions of public values suddenly take everything back when it comes to the im­plementation of drug tests. 
This is not an argument against the values which liberals have already managed to impose upon the American public. In fact, there is nothing nobler than helping the poor, saving children from abusive parents, prohibiting dis­criminatory hiring practices, providing disadvantaged students with aid and protecting our environment. My only question is, Why stop here? If the Dem­ocratic Party is the patron of affirmative government, assertively imposing preconceived values upon the public, why does it suddenly lose heart when it comes to eradicating the drug epidemic? 
Suddenly modern liberals on this issue give in to an inexplicable fatalism. To in­stitute the drug tests, they say, would con­situte a government Intrusion. It would infringe on the people's personal liberties, and, in the words of one of The Observer's letter-writing intelligentsia, be a "clear violation of privacy." 
Why suddenly all ofthis paralyzing con­cern? Did modern liberals ever make a fuss when the new government intruded into the market with the New Deal and The Great Society? Did orthodox Democrats ever get such pangs of con­science when they infringed on the liberties of employers to hire whomever they wanted, or on the liberties of stu­dents to attend whatever school they wanted? Even the violation of privacy did not present an obstacle to the majority of liberal reformers. What could be a greater violation of privacy than the in­come tax. which requires that one divulge to the government one's very sources of livelihood, often to the minutest most In­timate detail? Does a simple urine test even compare to the encroachment upon our privacy of this magnitude, an encroachment which we not only accept but take for granted as neccessary? 
The simple paradox could be summed up this way: we try to eradicate illiteracy by compelling every citizen to go to school for at least 12 years, but we won't even require a simple urinalysis to assist in the eradication of the drug epidemic. 
Often one hears, of course, that the problem of drug abuse differs from that of, say, illiteracy, because the former case concerns people who are indulging in a private habit which does not hurt anybody else in society, or if anybody, only those who are abusing the drugs themselves. 

So, since It is only their physical and psy­chological well-being which is in ques­tion, shouldn't these people be allowed to decide for themselves what they want to do with their own lives? 
Unfortunately, although one could pos­sibly apply such an argument to a per­son's desires not to go to school and remain Illiterate, one cannot validly do so to the current drug epidemic. Law en­forcers have identified the need to sup­port expensive drug habits as the leading cause of urban muggings, thefts and even killings. The government also es­timates that the lo">s to the country re­sulting from absenteeism, slackened pro­ductivity and so on amounts to $.3.3 billion. If the government can demand that the leaders of industries divulge in­formation with regard to the operation of their plants so as to protect the environ­ment, why can't it demand that people submit to drug tests to protect the streets of Los Angeles and New York, the eco­nomy at large and the physical and psy­chological health of Americans in gen­eral? 
To repeat, no criticism is being levelled at thejustification for our income tax sys­tell), our educational programs, our wel­fare benefits, our afflrmativ<:: action policies or our industrial regulatory agencies. Quite the opposite is the. c:'lse, in fact. For without some of these pro­grams, our country would be unable to survive very long, and without others our country would be a very unpleasant place to live in indeed. My only question is, why not extend this fine tradition of an asser­tive value-affirming-government. which has already been put into service to com­bat the inequitable distribution of wealth, racial prejuidice, illiteracy, child abuse, the sale of shoddy goods and the pollu­tion of our environment to the problem of the drug epiemic? If a modern liberal were truly faithful to his tradition, in fact, he would favor not only mandatory tests for federal employees, but for company employees and school children as well. 
But if a person holding to liberalism were· not to assert this, then one could only conclude one thing: it is not that he really fears government intrusion into our privacy or Individual liberties, for clearly such a fear has never stopped liberal reformers in the past nor does it today; rather, it could only be the case that deep down inside he could care less that, for instance, over one out of four young adults re~=tularly smoke marijuana and that 6.8% currently use cocaine.

I expect that to continue. Moroccans are not short on energy and expertise. So far, I've found that they and Americans make a good combination. I didn't come to Morocco to find myself. I never thought I was really lost. I have found out much about myself though, and about this country and the Arab  offically kicked into gear, and we are proceeding in our usual "take no prisoners" fashion. Although renovation of LaFortune is not slated for completion until the Fall of 1997, our new offices are open and we have phones now. Sooooo stop by and see us (2nd floor, LaFortune Student Center) or at least lean forward on the old couch and give us a call. We have something like three different phone numbers, but the only one we can ever remember is 239-SNOT.  Oh, by the way, pretty soon you'll start seeing advertising for a gala Multi­Cultural Fall Festival: Around the World in Seven Days. We've joined forces with about five other student organizations on campus to plan a week that is chock full of events. There will be lectures by a Rus­sian and an American Indian, fireside chats with professors who have travelled the world, a crazy display at the Snite Museum, and a host of other activities.

Further study, however, showed that the Peace Corps is more than that, and after being a part of the organi­zation for a few months, I find that I dis­cover more about the group each day._ Peace Corps people are not easily stereotyped. We've got everyone from Ewell Gibbons to F. Lee Bailey here. After a long and often frustrating ap-. plication process, I finally accepted an invitation to teach English in Morocco for two years. As I write this, I'm finishing my training in this country's capital, Rabat. I left my home in upstate New York just a few weeks after graduation, went to Philadelphia for a week of orientation, and then flew to Morocco.  It's difficult to explain everything I see and feel here. The genuine sadness I felt saying goodbye to my summer school students this past week made me feel that I am doing something good here. It was a high and a low at the same time. Peace Corps is not right for everyone, but neither is an offlce on Wall Street. My advice to anyone who cares is to do what feels right for you, not for someone else. Ifsomething like Peace Corps is that right thing, then please don't hesitate to write and find out more. I myself would love to answer letters between Kum Ba Yah verses. Good luck. Tell Bruno and Rocco I say hi. The pizza here isn't very good. Take care.  What have we been up to? Good ques­tion . . . Well, you may have noticed that the Student Senate has been in the paper lately. In the past few years the Senate has been accused of being everything from worthless to ugly. The first thing we did to rectify that situation was the banishing of Robert's Rules of Order. What are they? That's what we asked right before we axed them. Robert's Rules are some kind of crazy parliamentary procedures that nobody understands. Now, instead of arguing about rules, the Student Senate can get some stuff done. There was some confusion last week over this parietals resolution passed by the Senate. The passing of such a resolution is only one step in the intricate process  of these events with one of your profes­sors. We don't know about you guys, but we figure it's about time we get to know these people. What else have we been up to? Too many things to mention here, but there is one other thing we feel pretty psyched about: Kevin Cullen, one of our Food Ad­visory Commissioners, has been working to rectify the sludge crisis behind North Dining Hall. You'll thank us later. Oh yeah; if you happen to be one of the boatload of freshmen that signed up at our booth on Activities night, remain calm ·we'll be in touch soon.

Cowboys ride past Cardinals, 31-7; Landry notches 256th career win 
Associated Press 

ST. LOUIS Quarterback Danny White passed for 22.3 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Dallas Cowboys to a .31­7 victory over the winless St. Louis Cardinals in a National Football League game last night. 
White, who completed 16 of 29 passes while suffering two inter­ceptions, now has I 0 touchdown passes for the season. 
The Cowboys improved to .3-I with the victory in the nationally televised game. The .31 points enabled Dallas to tie the NFL record for consecutive .30-point games at the start of the season. The 1968 New York Giants and

St. Louis fell to 0-4 under new head Coach Gene Stallings, a former Cowboys assistant coach. 
The victory was the 256th of Dallas Coach Tom Landry's career, tying him with Miami's Don Shula for second place on the all-time NFL list. George Halas is No. I with .325. 
White, operating a Dallas of­fense with running back Herschel Walker subbing for the injured Tony Dorsett, threw his touch­down passes in the first, third and fourth quarters. 
The Cowboys mounted a 10-0 lead at halftime before Ottls An­derson's 1 0-yard scoring run put St. Louis on the board early In the third quarter. 
Rookie Mike Sherrard gathered In White's arching, .39-yard pass late in the opening period for Dallas' first touchdown and Rafael Septlen booted a .32-yard

Veteran Tony Hill was on the receiving end of White's 1.3-yard scoring pass four plays later. Dal­las then capitalized on two sacks of cards quarterback Neil Lomax. who suffered four inter­ceptions, to drive .31 yards and set up White's eight-yard scoring pass to Walker with 11: 15 remaining.

-Rowing Club dominates at Head of Des Moines 
During the day, Chris Nye works as an architect in South Bend. During nights and weekends, he and Clete Graham mold together one of the most sucess­ful collegiate rowing programs in the Midwest. 
"We're nowhere near Wisconsin, but we can give any other school a run for their money," said Rowing Club President Joe Brunetti. "We do really well against other schools from the Midwest." 
The rowers proved that In the Head of the Des Moines regatta last weekend In Des Moines, Iowa. Competing with schools like Nebraska, Creighton, Iowa, Kansas, and the University ofChicago, the Irish fared most successfully of all. 
Notre Dame's men's team, coached by Nye, had its A lightweight boat place first with a time of 19:51 over three miles. This time was good enough to win the Wellness Cup, an award presented to the boat with the fastest time on any course. The Irish have won the Cup each of the last three years. 
The men's B lightweight boat placed third in the race. 
Notre Dame's women's team, coached by Graham, placed first and third In the lightweight competition, and the open fours placed second and third. 
The Rowing Club also entered three co-ed boats of four men and four women. The three boats placed first. second, and third in the race. 
In all, the Irish won the Wellness Cup, three gold medals, and two silver medals during the regatta. 
It would seem like quite an accomplishment for most schools. But not for Notre Dame, which has grown accustomed to dominating Des Moines about this time of year. 
"We started going there in 1 984, and every year we've posted the fastest time," said Brunetti. "It was a really good meet; everyone had a good time and rowed really well. We definitely won the most events out of every team there." 
The Irish feel that now they may be even tougher than in recent years. And part of the reason is the coaching of Nye and Graham. 
"We're going to do a lot better because we're really motivated, and the coaching is the best it's been in the last four years," said Brunetti. 

Steve Megargee 
Club Corner 

While the 53-member varsity team is already com­peting in regattas, the novice squad of 70 to 80 members is preparing for Its first race Nov. 5 against Michigan. 
Like the Rowing Club, the Rugby Club was favored going into Its event last weekend. Unlike the rowers, the Rugby Club was not able to live up to its pre­tournament billing. 
The Irish fell to Kentucky, 16-6, in the first round of the Indiana-Kentucky Tournament. then lost to Ball State, 9-4, in their only other appearance of the tournament. 
"We had three guys hurt when we were down there," said Club President Quentin Williams. "A lot of guys didn't make the trip because of injuries." 
"(The opposition) had a new type of zone defense which we weren't ready for, and we didn't pressure the passer enough. 
Despite the team's showing, a trio of Seans put true Irish representation on the all-tournament team. Sean Evers, Sean Higgins, and Sean Manion were all named to the Collegiate Select team. 
Staying at a .500 pace, the Women's Soccer Club split a pair of games last week at Stepan Field. 
Notre Dame started the week with a huge scoring display In a 6-1 victory over Nazareth on Friday. Katy Kennelly scored two goals, and Kathy Birmingham, Kerry Haverkamp, Jane Titterton, and Kate Titterton each added a point for the Irish. 
The offense had a much tougher time of it Sunday against Purdue, as the Boilermakers finally prevailed, 1-0. 
"We played really well against Purdue. The match could have gone either way," said Club Secretary Susan Haling. "We lost to them like 4-1 last year, and they beat St. Mary's, who beat us earlier." 
With a 4-4 record, the Irish next face Wheaton at 4 p.m. tomorrow at Stepan Field. 
Notre Dame's Water Polo Club was also impressed with Its weekend showing. 
In a tournament at Chicago, the Irish beat Mic­higan, 13-6, and Dayton, 16-5, before finally falling to Loyola, 15-13, in the finals. Loyola is ranked seventh in the country among varsity teams. 
"We expected to beat Dayton and Michigan because we had a full team with us, but we expected to get beaten by Loyola badly," said Club Vice-President Steve Coffey. "We played them really tight." 
John Carew, Patrick McManus, and Steve Rodriguez made the all-tournament team for the Irish. 
The Sailing Club, which placed third ofeight teams at a tournament in Iowa on September 20-21, is looking forward to its two biggest regattas of the year. 
Notre Dame will enter the Timmie Angstrom Regatta this weekend, which includes about 20 schools, and will participate in the Hood Regatta the following we~kend.

B.P. downs P .E. 20-0 
Irish 
By KATHY BERRY Sports Writer 
The women's lnterhall football league race heated up this week with Breen-Phillips (2-0) routing Pasquerilla East (2-1 ), 20-0. With this win B. P. could end up the only undefeated team if P.E. can hold its 14-6 lead over Farley (2­
0) in their rescheduled contest this Sunday. This would set up an interesting match between 
B. P. and defending champion Farley next week. 
B. P. 's quarterback Amy Treder threw tttree touchdown passes, two to Caroline Burke and one to Carol Cavaliere. 
"B. P. 's defense was super, "said Annie Schrenk. 
P. E.'s tailback. "They stopped everything and when our usually successful plays didn't work. we fell apart." 
In the other Tuesday games Lyons (1-1) downed Lewis (0-3), 12-8. 
In last Thursday's action, Pasquerllla West (2-1) shutout Badin (0-3), 14-0, Walsh (1-2) defeated Lewis, 14-8, and Farley upended Lyons, 30-12. 
" We haven't played to our full potential in our last two games," Smith 6-2, 6-L after an opening round bye. In consolation action, Dasso was defeated by DeDe Dunkle of Tennessee, 6-3, 6-1. Dasso was ill throughout the tournament and was later pulled out of play. 

Sophomore Natalie Illig easily beat Catherine Johnson of Ten­nessee, 6-4, 6-0, only to lose to Tennessee's Shari Brimmer, 6-4, 6-7 (7-5 tiebreaker), 6-3. Assis­tant Coach Steve Simone ob­served that Illig's shots are just missing and that by spring, those tight matches should start to end in her favor. 
Julie Sullivan, Resa Kelly and Patricia O'Byrne also turned in solid efforts for the young Irish squad. Sullivan registered a vic­tory in the consolation draw against Iowa's Colleen Nichols, 3-6, 6-1, 6-L after a setback against Marie Hibbard of Kansas, 6-2, 6-1. O'Byrne lost to Ann Jonston, 6-.3, 6-.3. Kelly's only match was a 6-2, 6-L loss to Rhonda Brown. 
A major concern of the Irish is the inexperience of the doubles teams, four of which were en­tered in the doubles draw. 
' 

said Matt Roy, Lyons Hall coach. "But I think things are really starting to click for us now." 
On Sunday, P. W. defeated Walsh, 22-6, P. E downed Badin, 14-0, and Farley upended Lewis, 23-6. 
"I can't complain, "said Dave Haimes, coach of Farley. "We are having lots of fun and are playing really well. We will be ready for 
B. P." Farley and P. E. play the last 6:42 of their game on Oct. 5 at 7 p.m.

After losing the next two games following the dispute, Lohrer knotted up the score and won the tiebreaker, 7-3. 
Stephanie Tolstedt advanced to second-round singles action with a win over Ann Jonston. 7-6 (7-4 tiebreaker), 6-2, before Northwestern's Diane Donnelly defeated her, 6-L 6-1. Tolstedt lost her consolation round match, 6-4, 6-1.

ND soccer captures Wright St. title; dominant play pushes record to 9-2 
By SHAWN BUSHWAY and PETE GEGEN 
Sports Writers 
The Notre Dame soccer team pushed its record to 9-2 by cap­turing the four-team Wright State Invitational Tournament. 
The team crushed the Univer­sity of Miami (Ohio), 4-0, on Sat­urday and held off a late rally by Division II power Wright State to win, 3-2, on Sunday. 
This tournament victory was the first under Head Coach Den­nis Grace and promises to move the Irish up from last week's number-nine ranking in the Great Lakes Region. 
In the first game on Saturday, the team out-shot Miami, 15-6, in the process of scoring four goals on the way to a relatively easy victory. 
"We totally dominated," said a pleased Grace. "It wasn't nip­and-tuck. so we were able to sub­stitute freely and not wear down the starters.·: 

Sophmore Randy Morris scored the first goal at 4:30 on an assist from sophmore John Guignon. Guignon struck again with an unassisted goal at 20:35, and then assisted on sophmore midfielder John Sternberg's goal nine minutes later. 
Forward Bruce "Tiger" McCourt scored on a breakaway goal at 63:20 for the only goal of the second half. 
Senior goalkeeper Hugh Bres­lin made four saves to record the shutout. 
In the othergame on Saturday, Wright State beat Dayton, 2-0, to set up the title clincher on Sun­day between Wright State and Notre Dame. 
At first It appeared the Irish would blow out the Raiders. McCourt scored at 8:43 on an as­sist from freshman Rolf Berhje to put Notre Dame out front. That goal gave McCourt a team­leading total of 29 points on the season. 
Senior wingback Marvin Lett scored again on a pass from senior forward Bill Gross at 23: 13 to give Notre Dame a 2-0 lead. Grace was pleased with with the team's effort on Lett's first goal of the season. 
"It was just a great play," ex­plained Grace. "We stole the ball at midfield, took It down the line and centered it. Marvin pivoted around and hit a volley with his left foot." 
The Irish, however, failed to tally another goal in the first half despite numerous chances. That spelled trouble for Notre Dame in the second half. 
"Wright State came out think­ing they could win," said Grace. "They really fought hard." 
With the Irish laying back on defense, the Raiders finally lit the scoreboard on a goal by Jim Kin­derline at 86: 16. 
But Irish forward Pat Murphy scored an insurance goal 29

Youth movement powers Saint Mary's tennis 
Young talent is perhaps the Saint Mary's tennis team's finest asset this season. 
Much of the Belles' success can be .attributed to freshmen and sopohomore players, according to Head Coach Deb Laverie. 
Two such players for the team are freshman singles and doubles player Jennifer Block and freshman singles player Charlene Szajko. 
Block. who hails from Kalamazoo, Mich., is the number-one seed for the Belles, posting a 6-2 record so far this season. Block's only losses were players from St. Francis, an NAJA team, and to DePauw, an NCAA team. 
Szajko, a native of Mishawaka, is the team's number-six seed, also with a 6-2 season record. Un­defeated in NAJA play, Szajko's only losses have been to players from St. Joseph (Rensselaer, Ind.) and to Wisconsin-Milwaukee, both NCAA teams. 
Block and Szajko are successes because of their drive to achieve, according to Laverie, who believes both players are very competent. 
Laverie says that Block. for example, handles her­self quite well at the number-one seed. 
"Jennifer is just an outstanding player," she says. "When she came in, I knew she had strokes. She hits the ball well, and she moves quickly. Jennifer has the heart, too. She really strives to do well. 
"I think it's tough for a freshman to play at number­one. She has a lot of weight to carry, and a lot is expected from her, but she's just been super." 
Block. who was named to both Michigan's All-State tennis team and the Greater Kalamazoo All-Star ten­nis team for her high school tennis accomplish­ments, finds college tennis quite a different game from that of high school. 
"College tennis is a lot more competitive," Block says. "Our practices are a lot tougher, too. I find that conditioning and playing for two and a half hours each day pay off in a match, though." 
Block. who was named the most valuable player of the Hackett Catholic Central High School girls' tennis team, notes a marked improvement in her play since last season. 
"I have a lot more confidence in my strokes," she says. "It must be because of all the reinforcement we get each day. I think I've Improved since the day the team started practicing."

While Block is quite a successful singles player, she also makes up half of the Belles' number-one seed doubles team. Junior Kate McDevitt is Block's doubles partner, and the two complement each other, according to Laverie. 
"Jennifer Is an aggressive player, and Kate is a consistent, steady player," Laverle said. "Their styles gel really well together. They have played well all season." 
Laverie notes that the pair's season record Is deceiving. · 
"Although their record is only 2-6, all of their losses were very close," Laverle said. "They've played some tough competition and have lost some tough matches." 
Block agrees that she and McDevitt are a strong doubles team, despite their record. 
"Kate and I play well together," she said. "Our goals are pretty similar. We communicate on the court, and that's the key to being a successful doubles team."

Irish tennis improving against host Wildcats 
By SHEILA HOROX 
Sports Writer 
Northwestern, currently ranked 6th in the nation, hosted the women's Midwest Intercol­legiate Tennis tournament last weekend, which. included Notre Dame, Eastern Michigan, Ten­nessee, Iowa and Kansas. 
Irish Coach Sharon Gelfman was particularly pleased with in­dividual performances against the nationally-ranked Wildcats of Northwestern. "In previous years we weren't even able to give Northwestern any competition," said Gelfman. "But we had some good matches against them and even the losing scores weren't in­dicative of how well we played." 
Co-captain Tammy Schmidt lost a three-set decision to Chris­tina Schuschel of Northwestern, 1-6, 6-4, 6-2, In one of the con­solation finals. Schuschel used a variety of top spin lobs in trying to keep Schmidt deep in the backcourt but Schmidt coun­tered with mid-court volleys. 
"It was one of the best matches she's ever played," noted Gelfman. 
Freshman Alice Lohrer also faced a tough Northwestern op­ponent in Kelly Boyse. Lohrer lost 6-4, 7-5, in that opening singles match but bounced back in a consolation win over Iowa's Patty Desimone, 3-6, 7-6 (7-3 tie­breaker), 6-0. 
Lohrer was up 5-4 in the second set, when a disagree­ment on the score interrupted play. "I was a little unnerved over the dispute," said Lohrer. "But coach kept telling me to relax and not worry about who was across the net just to play my game."

Like Block. Szajko is a success because of her drive to excel in singles competition, according to Laverie. 
"Charlene is a real fighter," she said. "She never gives up, and she has a lot of desire. She played for us last year and was outstanding. This summer Char­lene really worked on her game, and now it's at an even better level than it was last season." 
Szajko, who was named the Belles' most valuable player last spring, agrees that she has improved but nonetheless, thinks there are still weaknesses in her game. 
"My strokes are more accurate, and I have a better toss and spin on my serve than I had last semester," she said. "My problem is I stew over points missed. I need to work on taking it one point at a time. I have to remember I'm out here to have fun." 
Not only does Szajko intend to work on her mental game for the remainder of the season, but she also Intends to become a more aggressive player. 
"I have to come up to the net more," she said. "If I work on that and if I learn to concentrate more, I'll be pleased." 
Last season Szajko was the NAJA Indiana State Champion, winning all her matches at the state com­petition, and was named District Champion for remaining undefeated in regular season play. 
In addition to succeeding In athletics, Szajko also excels academically. She is the recipient of the 1986 Kaminsky Scholarship, awarded to a student ofPolish descent who maintains a high scholastic average. Szajko was also honored with the Tri Kappa Academic Scholarship, presented to a student who has a su­perior academic record and who resides in St. Joe County. 
With talented players like Block and Szajko on the roster, it Is evident that the Saint Mary's tennis team has quite a promising future.
