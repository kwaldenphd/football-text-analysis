Ten-year strategic plan released 
By MEGHANNE DOWNES News Editor 
Those affiliated with Notre Dame will see both structural and conceptual changes over the next ten years as the University embarks on its next strategic plan to enrich the academic, student, spiritual and residential life on campus. 
"Notre Dame 2010: Fulfilling the Promise" follows the recently com­pleted, "Colloquy for the Year 2000" and is Notre Dame's fourth strategic plan in as many decades. 
"Fulfilling the Promise" empha­sizes the need for Notre Dame to enrich its research and academic programs by attracting scholars, expanding undergraduate pro­gramming and strengthening graduate and doctoral programs. 
The plan refers to Notre Dame's financial base, capacity for growth and quality of its staff as indicators that this is the optimal time for the University to accomplish these goals. 
Academically, the University wants to strengthen and develop its programs. The administration stresses a need for balance between access to and within the undergraduate colleges. One example ofthis need for balance is in the Mendoza College of Business's acknowledgement that there is an overabundance of stu­dents enrolled in the college. Another example is the constraint in the curriculum in the School of Architecture. This balance and academic programming enrich­ment and expansion will be accomplished by diversifying, innovating and integrating the teaching and learning process and developing departmental pro­grams. 
Notre Dame's commitment to developing its research base will be complemented by increasing

Groups continue time-honored traditions 
ND band spends football weekends 

exciting fans 
By BETH ERICKSON 
News Writer 
The Band of the Fighting Irish is the oldest and most visible emblem of football spirit on campus. As the old­est university marching band, it has inspired fans and 
infused every home game with pageantry and spirit since 1887. 
The Band practices together every night in preparation for the game and meets in sec­tionals once to go over music. Throughout the season, mem­bers· must learn many intri­cate routines choreographed by the assistant directors. 
In recent years, the Band has gained much popularity amongst students as its per­formances have become increasingly innovative. 
This week is no exception, as the Band has gone to great lengths to impress fans attending the final home game of the season.

Irish Guard brings dignity, discipline to games 


By BETH ERICKSON 
News Writer 

The signature marches of the Irish Guard lend football Saturdays ceremony and tradi­tion, but little is known about the hard work and dedication required ofits 10 kilted men. 
The members of the Guard practice every night from Monday to Thursday with the marching band. Each week, they must coordinate with the band to learn the new halftime routine, in which they often play a large role. 
··Practices are actually pretty serious for us," senior Guardsman Matt Coleman said. "We sometimes only have a week to learn the new routine for every game." 
The Guard continues to perfect its traditional marches during every practice, for it must main­tain the strictest standards of performance. 
On the Fridays before home games, the Guard 'marches off' from the Dome, leading the band through campus to the practice field. They then preside over the pep rally. 
The Guard does not have a Friday curfew, but because the Guardsmen take their roles as overseers of game day tradition very seriously, they tend to have "pretty tame Friday nights," Coleman said. 
Game day responsibilities nor­mally take up 12 hours, Coleman said. 
While this is a huge commit­ment, the experience makes it worthwhile. 
"The Guard is part of the whole Saturday game day experience," Coleman said. "It's so exciting to be there in front of 80,000 fans." 
The 12-hour game day begins with a 'march out' through cam-

Cheerleaders enthuse game-day crowds 
By BETH ERICKSON News Writer 
Being a Notre Dame cheer­leader requires athleticism, spirit and dedication,· but despite the enormous amount of work the team puts into the job, the perks of being a symbol of game-day spirit make it, for the cheer­leaders, one of the best posi­tions on campus. 
During football season, the team practices four times a week, and each individual works with a trainer twice a week. In practice, they work on partner stunts and pyra­mids for the upcoming game. 
"[Practice is] the place I go to get away from everything else during the day," senior cheerleader Meredith Capshaw said. "Believe it or not, practice is one of the most fun parts of cheerlead­ing." 

"I spend that two hours laughing harder than I've laughed all day and most of all, having a good time," she said. "I love my team." 
Two years ago, the team was cleared by the athletic administration to perform more difficult stunts. These stunts had previously been restricted because of injuries at other schools. Many of the formations performed during this year's time-outs have been introduced in light of these new allowances. 
Most of the team's cheers are traditional cheers that the program has used for many years. The team is very traditional, as seen in their traditional uniforms, and unlike most collegiate cheer squads, does not compete.

Residence 
changes proposed 
By MEGHANNE DOWNES  
News Editor  
The student affairs portion  
of Notre Dame's next strategic  
plan, "Notre Dame 2010:  
Fulfilling the Promise,"  
includes suggestions to  
enhance undergraduate and  
graduate programs in an  
effort to integrate student and  
academic life and to construct  
new campus and residential  
facilities, including the possi­ 
bility of coeducational hous­ 
ing.  
This section focuses on resi­ 
dential life at Notre Dame,  
noting the hallmark experi­ 
ence of living in the resi­ 
dences and the opportunities  
for growth and learning that  
exists in the halls.  
"In an ideal world students  I  
would feel, and for the most  I I  
part I feel they do, residence halls would be a place where they share their concerns and their excitement for what they  I l  
are learning. Similar to in the  
classroom they could talk  
about moral and ethic issues,"  
said Ann Firth, executive  
assistant to the vice president  
ofstudent affairs.  
Possibilities for accomplish­ 
ing this include a recommit­ 
ment to building a Christian  
community within the dorms.  
Notre Dame hopes that an  
increased emphasis on min­ 
istry, service and retreats  
within residences will form  
intellectual, moral and spiritu­ 
al leaders who will become  
leaders in the Church.  
Goals are also outlined to  
expand diversity on campus to  
encourage learning through  
the exchange of culture and  
personal experiences.  
Firth said the Office of the  
Student Affairs intends to cre­ 
ate an environment where  
learning is ongoing but that  
this integration is not intend­ 
ed to subject dorms to non­ 
stop academic programming.  
In response to overcrowding  
in dorms and the diminishing  
numbers of upperclassmen,  
especially seniors moving off  
campus, Firth said the  
Univserity intends to build  
four new residential complex­ 
es. The plan emphasizes the  
importance of the residential  
community as the percentage  
of on campus students has  
dropped steadily over the  
years from 83 percent to cur­ 
rently 79 percent.  
Though Firth said it would  
be premature to comment on  
the recommendations for  
these new residential com­ 
plexes the Ad-Hoc Committee  
on the Future of Residential  
Life would recommend to

President for Student Affairs,

Soccer deserves fan sUpport 
This weekend provides Notre Dame sports fans with a number of wonderful options. The football team plays its last home game of the year against BYU, and the 
men's basketball Andy Troeger 
team plays an exhibition game on Friday.

Don't forget, Sports Writer however, when making your weekend sports plan, to come out and watch the No. 2 seeded women's soccer team as they open the NCAA Tournament at home against Loyola of Chicago. One of the big benefits to earning a top seed in the NCAA Tournament is home-field advan­tage throughout the first four rounds of the tournament. Yet, for the Irish to be able to completely enjoy that advantage, they need to have the support of the Notre Dame community. With the thousands of people that flood the area on home football weekends, and a game time conve­niently coming near the end of the pep rally, Friday night's game is the perfect opportunity to begin supporting the soccer team in their efforts to bring home an NCAA Title to Notre Dame. Further reason to come out and support the Irish is that the teams coming to Notre Dame are certain to bring fans with them, consider­ing that the games are only a few hours from the other respective schools. For example, Loyola is sponsor­ing a free bus ride to South Bend for Loyola students so that they can cheer on their team. It would be a pretty sorry state­ment if the visiting team could match the number of fans of the No. 2 team in the country. The Irish have amassed a record of 19-2-1 and are the only team in the nation with four players that have scored at least 10 goals in seniors Amy Warner and Amanda Guertin, junior Mary Boland and sophomore Katie Thorlakson. The Irish sport two Hermann Trophy Finalists, reserved for the top fifteen players in the country, with Warner and classmate Melissa Tancredi receiving that honor. Tancredi, Boland and Warner all were first team All-Big East selec­tions, providing the Irish with a lot of firepower for a possible NCAA Tournament run. So don't pass up the chance to cheer on the No. 2 women's soccer team as they take on Loyola on Friday at 7 p.m. at Alumni Field. If the Irish win, they will also be in action on Sunday afternoon at 1 p.m. The time is now for the Irish to start their postseason run, and for you to be there to see it all happen.

Students apply to go abroad despite violence 
University takes measures to reassure students who may study abroad 
By LAURA VILIM 
News Writer 

Despite an international culture that has become increasingly violent and anti­American in recent months, students at Notre Dame who are considering studying abroad have relatively few fears about leaving the coun­try, a trend that shows stu­dents feel safer today than they did at the start of the U. 
S. invasion of Iraq less than one year ago. 
Last year, the fear of vio­lence against Americans kept several students from carry­ing out their plans to study abroad.

When advisories do contain warnings on often-visited countries such as England, France and Australia, Gutting cites the security measures her department has estab­lished to protect its students. 
"In times of political ten­sion, we routinely monitor the situation in the places Notre Dame students live," said Gutting. "We have a University Committee that meets regularly to discuss security matters. We consult with other universities, shar­ing information and learning about their safety precau­tions." 
For the most part, both stu­dents and their parents have realized the lengths the International Studies Department has gone to pro­tect them, and few are fearful of the prospect of studying abroad. This sense of well­being was not felt to as great an extent last year when sev­eral students cancelled their trips due to concerns about their safety.

Zahm drainage pipes back up 
ByJOE TROMBELLO 
News Writer 
Waste backup left Zahm Hall residents without water for nearly four hours Thursday afternoon and evening, said Zahm Hall rector Daniel Parrish. 
Parrish said that the water backup occurred once Monday and twice Thursday. 
Housekeeping staff reported some backup in the basement around 2 p.m. Thursday after­noon, after which they cleaned out the water and reported the problem to building services. 
Plumbers then ran a snake through the water cleanout area Thursday afternoon and hit a root ball, causing a water out­age, as all the toilets, showers and sinks go through one drain. 
Phyllis Campbell, supervisor of building services, said workers were dispatched immediately to pump out the water. Parrish estimated that there was about half an inch of water in the downstairs basement and the food sales area. 
Parrish said the cleanout for the waste water 
seemed to have little effect on residents.

Saint Mary's holds student safety forum 
By KELLY MEEHAN 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's held its second annual Safety Forwn to provide the students and community with advice on deal­ing with a wide range of security issues at 7 p.m. Thursday in O'Laughlin auditorium, although less than 10 students attended. 
The Safety Forum was modeled off last September's Security Forum that was geared towards the incoming freshman class. That event was the first time the Security Department attempted to hold such a large event. The success of last year's event prompted the department to initiate this year's event, which was open to the entire community. 
Security Program Coordinator Chris Pennino was in charge of the Safety Forum. 
"I am attempting to provide presen­ters who will address the issues that concern our whole student body as well as our faculty, staff and sur­rounding community," said Pennino. 
The forum's speakers informed the audience on a wide range of topics from sexual assault to Internet preda­tors. 
Mitch Kajzer, investigator for the Saint Joseph County Prosecuting Attorney, discussed and demonstrat­ed how he goes undercover online to target Internet predators. His eye­opening demonstration illustrated the immense number of predators that exist on the Internet. 
"I am able to arrest about one predator per hour," Kajzer said. 
He stressed the importance of pro­tecting oneself and children while on the Internet. Kajzer's investigative work can eventually lead to the arrest of cyber criminals. 

Saint Mary's Director of Information Technology, Keith Fowlkes, continued the Internet safe­ty discussion. He spoke about ways to be safe online and the steps to take to ensure safety. 
Brett Hemmerlein of the St. Joseph County Special Victims Unit and Cindy Eastman of the South Bend Police Department's Sexual Assault Unit, spoke on the issues of rape and date rape drugs from a legal perspec­tive. Hemmerlein's knowledge on these topics comes from serving for 28 years as a South Bend Police offi­cer. Eastman has worked 20 years in the South Bend Police Department and has had 12 years experience in the Sex Offence Unit. 
Mary Waggoner, the Community Outreach Coordinator for SOS of Madison County, informed the audi­ence of their options after being a vic­tim of sexual assault. As an advocate for victims of sexual assault and rape, she spoke about seeking help at the hospital and the involvement of law enforcement after the incident. 
Despite offering a wide variety of information, turnout was lower than expected. The Saint Mary's Security Department hopes to reschedule the event at a time more convenient for the student body. 
"I would like to think that Saint Mary's College is helping to provide information that will possibly prevent future crimes against our students and community. The focus is on bringing in professionals who can share their valuable knowledge in an effort to help us become more active players in our own safety," said Pennino.

Plan 
continued from page 1 

the number of distinguished faculty and setting a goal of raising $100 million in exter­nal research funding. 
Though Notre Dame is known predominantly as an undergraduate institution, the plan outlines goals to improve doctoral programs so that at least 25 percent are ranked nationally in the top quartile. 
Noting that the Univserity has much ground to cover con­sidering diversity, the plan makes a commitment to attract underrepresented stu­dents and faculty and to expand ethnic academic pro­grams, specifically African American studies; internation­al research institutes; and international programs in China, India and Africa. 
Importance is placed on inte­grating academic, residential and student life to diversify and expand learning. Possibilities for accomplishing this focus on creating an envi­ronment that encourages aca­demic expansion in residence halls. 
Multiple campus and resi­dential facilities are featured in the plan as a way to achieve this integration. 
The plan emphasizes the need for Notre Dame to devel­op its Catholic intellectual life and become the premier cen­ter of Catholic intellectual life. 
"When most of the great uni­versities in the world are utter­ly secular in their missions, there seems to be a special need for an institution where religious faith seeking under­standing can provide a com­mon frame of reference for the diverse areas of learning and a sense of moral obligation in the relationship between theoreti­cal reflection and practical application," the report said. 
This will be accomplished partly through enhancing Catholic scholarship, applying values of the Church to reflec­tion on contemporary issues and strengthening foundation­al and applied ethics. Retreats, increased ministry in dorms, service and hiring faculty and staff that foster Catholic teach­ings are also intended to expand the Catholic founda­tion. 

The strategic plan carries over into athletics as well as Notre Dame continues to focus on recruiting coaches and ath­letes who value integrity, aca­demics and spirituality. Expansion of scholarship allo­cations and facilities are intended to foster this focus. 
Though the University halted construction last year due to the decrease in the endow­ment, the plan states that structural and conceptual pro­posals can be accomplished through prudent fiscal polices, stewardship and capital plan­ning.

Affairs 
continued from page 1 
early next year, the strategic plan did discuss potential options. This includes senior suites or apartments, coedu­cational housing and smaller themed residences. 
Firth said the committee is discussing several options, including coed housing. 
"We are exploring coeduca­tional housing in part because of the national trend that was to have coed halls," Firth said. "The fact that it does exist means that it is something that Notre Dame has to visit." 
Premier Catholic institutions such as Georgetown and undergraduates. 
Firth said that this focus on graduate students would not detract from undergraduates. 
"[We want] to try to be a place that is more attentive to graduate students," Firth said. "We want to do a better job at taking care of them." 
Student Affairs first began exploring possible goals and formulating plans during the 2002-2002 academic year. 
Firth said though the office sets goals and may set them high, Student Affairs hopes to accomplish most if not all of the objectives outlines in "Notre Dame 2010: Fulfilling the Promise." 
Contact Meghanne Downes at mdownesl @nd.edu 

Boston College have under­graduate coed housing. 
Other facilities projects that will be explored include con­structing an enlarged student center complex, new apart­ments for married students, additional graduate student housing and a retreat center; replacing Stepan Center; and renovating the University Health Center. 
Firth said Student Affairs intends to focus on expanding student services, especially in health services and student organizations. 
Though Notre Dame is pri­marily an undergraduate institution, the plan empha­sizes enhancing graduate services and collaboration between graduates and

BAGHDAD, Iraq-Japan put off a deci­sion Thursday on sending troops to Iraq, a day after the deadliest attack on coalition forces since the war, and South Korea capped its contribution at 3,000 soldiers ­new setbacks to U.S. hopes for easing the pressure on its forces. 
U.S. troops pounded suspected guerrilla targets in the capital for a second straight night under a new "get-tough" campaign against the insurgency. And the top American administrator, L. Paul Bremer, headed back to Baghdad after two days of White House talks with orders that Iraqis should take more responsibility for govern­
ing. 
On the eve of a visit to Tokyo by Defense Set:retary Donald Rumsfeld, Japan decided the time isn't right to send its forces to Iraq, indicating its deployment might be delayed 
until next year. 
AIDS transmissions up in India 
NEW DELHI, India-The virus that causes AIDS is being spread through India's general population mainly by married men, who have unprotected sex with prostitutes. according to a study released Thursday. 
About G 1 0,000 Indians contracted HIV last year, increasing the overall number of infect­ed Indians to about 4.5 million, said the study funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. That is the second-highest total in the world after South Africa. 
In four of the six most affected states, the virus was contracted by businessmen, men in the service sector and hotel employees. said the study, which used federal and state government data.

Parties split on judicial nominees 
WASHINGTON -President Bush accused the Senate of "shameful" inaction on his judi­cial nominees, lending his voice Thursday to a 30-hour Senate debate over Republican efforts to pry conservative nominees loose from Democratic filibusters. 
After an all-night session, senators were bleary-eyed but firmly on message. Republicans insisted there was no precedent for refusing to allow votes on the president's judicial choices. Democrats said the GOP-led Senate was championing judges who do not represent American mainstream views. 
Bush's visit called 'bad timing' 
WASHINGTON -It seems like a colossal case of bad timing on both sides of the Atlantic, a state visit to Britain while both President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair are mired in slumping approval ratings because of continuing turmoil in Iraq. 
Blair stands to lose the most politically from the visit, U.S. and British analysts sug­gest. Recent polls show a clear majority of British voters think Bush was wrong on Iraq and regard Blair's closeness to the president as bad for Britain. 
But it also is hard to see what benefit Bush can claim by offering a fresh reminder that he and Blair marched lockstep against most of the world in deciding to invade Iraq.

The team leads the student sec­tion in cheers on Friday pep ral­lies, one of the team's favorite aspects of home football weekends. 
"The main focus of the students essentially is to help us out, and ... they do a great job of it," Capshaw said. "No matter if we're having a winning season or not, Notre Dame pep rallies will always be packed and will always be upbeat." 
The pep rally is immediately fol­lowed by a dinner held at the house of athletic director Kevin White. There, the team eats and then greets alumni, former football coaches, former football players, 
Heisman Trophy win­ners and NBC execu­tives. 
Typical game days begin about three and a half hours before kickoff. The team leads a short pep rally at the bookstore and another for tail­gaters in the Senior Bar parking lot, which draws an espe­
cially excitable crowd, Capshaw said. 
The team then performs with the porn-squad in a more organized pep rally at the JACC, in which the Leprechaun speaks to thousands of fans, and at a special pep rally held in the corporate tent behind the JACC for those affiliated with the game, such as NBC and adidas. 
Later, the team sprints through Lafortune yelling and screaming on its way to the Dome to meet the band and Guard, which they lead to the stadium.

IN BRIEF 
Microsoft faces antitrust charges 
BRUSSELS, Belgium -Microsoft Corp. con­cluded its defense against European antitrust charges on Thursday, reiterating its hope of reaching a settlement to stave off hefty fines and tough sanctions. 
After nearly two days of closed-door hear­ings, Microsoft turned the floor over to its crit­ics, who argue the U.S. software giant is trying to corner new markets with its Windows monopoly. 
On Friday, Sun Microsystems Inc., which filed the original complaint against Microsoft in 1998, and RealNetworks take the stand, fol­lowed by two Microsoft-friendly trade groups. Microsoft then gets an hour and 15 minutes for a final statement. 
The European Commission is expected to issue its decision in the nearly 5-year-old case next spring if no settlement is reached. Microsoft is. hoping for a deal to· avoid penal­ties that could be the toughest it has faced on either side of the Atlantic. 
"We've come to Brussels not only to discuss the issues but to work things out," Brad Smith, ~1icrosoft's senior vice president for law and corporate affairs, told reporters after the hearing broke for lunch. 
Putnam agrees to reforms 
BOSTON -The Securities and Exchange Commission announced a partial settlement Thursday with Putnam Investments, under which the company will undertake significant reforms and agreed to a process for repaying investors harmed by excessive market timing. 
Boston-based Putnam, which had no imme­diate comment, neither admitted nor denied the findings, the SEC said. The company had previously promised to make full restitution to investors harmed by improper market timing by Putnam employees or customers. 
The SEC said the amount of any civil penalty or monetary relief remains open and will be determined later. It described the administra­tive proceeding as "ongoing." 
Market timing is the use of quick, in-and-out trades that skim profits from longer-term shareholders. The practice is not illegal but most funds do not allow it.

Congress fights over Medicare bill

At its core, the emerging bill would provide seniors a pre­scription drug benefit begin­ning in 2006, at a cost of $35 a month. 
The low-income would 
receive subsidies to defray the cost. At the same time, the plan would encourage private insurance companies to offer coverage under preferred provider organizations for seniors willing to opt out of traditional Medicare. 
While lawmakers clashed over one of the few remaining issue in dispute, President Bush said in Florida it was time for Congress to act "for today's seniors but also for tomorrow's retirees."

chief executive sug­gested the plan for direct competition in four metropolitan areas and one region be scaled down. "That sounds big," William Novelli said in an interview, adding the issue was "an example of what others should negotiate." 
Republicans argue that the new private health plans would help modernize Medicare and possibly give seniors access to benefits such as preventive health care that are not currently covered by the government-run program. At the same time, they hope it will slow the growth in the cost of the program.

Frist and Speaker Dennis Hastert and embraced thus far by only two Senate Democrats. 
Despite the sharp rhetoric in the Capitol, GOP leadership aides said the legislation remained on track to be brought to a vote next week, and Democrats stopped short of threatening a filibuster that could delay or derail passage in the Senate. 
In addition, sources familiar with negotiations said Republicans had agreed dur-

ing the day to concessions to delay the beginning of their plan for competition, and to provide further protection against the type of premium increases that Kennedy and other critics forecast would spell the doom of Medicare. 
Rather than start in 2007, the program would begin in 2010, these sources said. And instead of limiting p.remium increases to 10 percent annu­ally for seniors remaining in traditional Medicare, the cap would be 5 percent. Unresolved was the number of recipients to be covered.

Many Democrats are wary of such a large role for private companies, but have been willing to accept it as part of a grand bargain that also included Republican support for the new drug benefit. 
But in months of closed-door talks, lawmakers were unable to bridge their differences over Republican demands for direct competition between the two forms of coverage ­the private and the public.

The Guard then dons its tradition­al Scottish garb, which normally takes an hour to put on. The group's adherence to traditional Scottish dress has been its trade­mark since the Guard's inception in 1949. 
After dressing, it performs with the marching band on the steps of Bond Hall. The Guard 'slow march­es' in front of the Band and per­forms its time-honored 'victory clog.' After marching from Bond to the quad in front of the Dome, members are 'inspected' in order of oldest to youngest by the captain and by alumni Guardsmen. 
The Guard then leads the march­ing band through campus to the stadium and out onto the field to perform its pre-game routines, half­time show and post-game rituals, including the signature victory clog after a Notre Dame victory. 
The Guard represents dignity and eminence to campus visitors, who delight in meeting the Guard and posing for pictures with its 10 kilted members.

"It makes you feel appreciated after all your hard work to get to go out and meet people and perform," he said. 
Coleman· said his most memo­rable experience with the Guard was the group's trip to Florida for the FSU game in 2002. The group, which is "very tight-knit," vaca­tioned in Panama City that week. 
"I'm going to miss it," Coleman said. "I've enjoyed my time on the guard." 
"When I come back next year I will be really jealous of the guys who are out there," he said.

Midwest windstorms knock out power lines 
Associated Press 
Windstorms gusting to more than 70 mph swept across the Midwest and the East, knock­ing out power to more than 
1.4 million customers and bringing rain and flooding that flushed out buildings "like a toilet." 
A motorist who drove past a roadblock was swept away by a creek in West Virginia, and in New York a tree fell onto a car, killing the driver. A Virginia teenager was serious­ly injured when a tree fell on her as she waited for a school bus on Wednesday. 
Michigan and Ohio were the hardest hit by power outages, with about 375,000 customers affected in each state. The majority had electricity restored by late Thursday. 
Gusts up to 74 mph knocked down trees and power lines in Michigan. Scores of school dis­tricts canceled classes, and a live power line fell across Interstate 94 near the Detroit airport, creating a monster traffic jam. 
Winds halted boat traffic on the Great Lakes, where waves of up to 16 feet were recorded on lakes Erie and Ontario. 
New York-area airports had 
flight delays of up to three 
hours Thursday. 
Seven people were injured Wednesday night in Wooster, Ohio, when a tornado darn­aged a Rubbermaid plant. The twister, with w"inds of 110 to 130 mph, was on the ground for about 12 miles, said mete­orologist Mark Adams of the National Weather Service. 
"We've had substantial dam­age," Rubbermaid spokes­woman Keri Butler said Thursday. The company was still running its distribution site, but manufacturing was shut down. 
Another tornado that hit Lexington Township near Alliance, about 50 miles southeast of Cleveland, had winds of 75 to 100 mph and damaged a few homes and a school, Adams said. 
In West Virginia, heavy rain caused flooding Wednesday. A car that had driven around a fire truck and into a creek was found early Thursday. jammed under a bridge in Kanawha County's Loudendale area. The driver had been swept away. 
Clark to take public money 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Democratic presidential hopeful Wesley Clark, who flirted with the idea of skipping public financing despite a late fund-raising start, announced Thursday he will stay within the system. 
The decision means Clark will be limited to $45 million in overall primary spending and will face state-by-state spend­ing caps. He will be eligible for up to about $19 million in gov­ernment funding. 
Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean last week became the first Democrat ever to turn away public financing and its spend­ing limits for the primaries. Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry is considering skipping the sys­tem, which offers a match of up to $250 for each contribution up to the limit. 
Clark, who started his cam­paign in late September, raised $3.5 million in the first two weeks. He expects to raise at least $6 million in the current fund-raising quarter, which runs from October through December. 
That would have him finish­ing the year with less than half the amount that money front­runners Dean and Kerry have 
raised. Dean collected $25 mil­
lion through September, 
according to the most recent 
figures available, while Kerry 
raised $20 million. 
"We're raising money at a significant clip, which was why we waited so long to make the decision," Clark spokeswoman Kym Spell said. 
However, she said, Clark ulti­mately decided to stay within public financing out of respect for the system and because it is the best decision for his cam­paign. 
Clark has filed the initial paperwork with federal election regulators to qualify for the government campaign money. The Federal Election Commission will make the first payment in January. 
The retired general's decision will provide him with an impor­tant cash infusion heading into the early primaries. If Clark becomes the Democratic nomi­nee, however, there is a risk he will be near the spending limit as President Bush, with no pri­mary opponent, has millions left to spend next spring and summer, before the general election season starts. 
Bush has opted out of public financing for the primaries, as he did in his first bid, and is 
already at or over the record 
$106 million he raised in 2000. 
He plans to accept full public 
funding for the general elec­
tion. 

Spell said Clark decided not to let Bush's prolific fund rais­ing affect his own campaign strategy. The retired general will have the resources he needs to run, she said. 
Other Democratic candidates, including Joe Lieberman, Dick Gephardt and John Edwards, have also committed to -taking public financing. 
Clark has been capitalizing on Dean's decision to opt out of the system. 
Clark campaign chairman Eli Segal sent a donor appeal Thursday noting Dean's recent decision to skip public financing and the accompanying spend­ing limits, as well as the possi­bility that Kerry will follow. 
"Both have been raising money for over a year and are blanketing the key early states with television advertising and paid campaign workers," Segal wrote in the e-mail. "As you know well, Wes Clark's cam­paign began just eight weeks ago." 
Segal told donors a $1,000 contribution would help pay for a month's rent on the cam­paign's new South Carolina office, $500 would buy a com­

Kerry apologizes to former staff 
Associated Press 
CONCORD, N.H. Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry called three former aides Thursday to apologize for saying his campaign will be "better ofT" without them. 
Kerry made the calls hours after he said in an interview with The Associated Press that the firing of campaign manager Jim Jordan on Sunday was proof of his ability to make tough decisions. 
Within days of Jordan's dis­missal, Kerry's press secretary and deputy finance director quit. 
"When you change one per­son, it is not at all unusual that a couple of people that person hired, that I barely know, who are not really involved with me, decide to go," Kerry said. 
Even some of his top advisers privately complained that Kerry's remarks threatened to further divide his staff and add steam to an internal squabble that has raised questions about his management style.

Rep. Edward Markey, D­Mass., praised Kerry's choice of Cahill and said lawmakers on the call were supportive and believe that the presidential race is still wide open. 
Responding to Kerry's com­ments, Gibbs said, "I enjoyed working for Senator Kerry and wish him the best. I believe he will make a great president of the United States." 
Kerry had described the fir­ing of Jordan as a "one-day story," but the departures of two other staffers and ques­tions about whether he could revive his struggling campaign have lingered. He trails rival Howard Dean by double digits in New Hampshire, a must-win state for the two New Englanders. 
Questioned Thursday, Kerry said, "It's time for this cam­paign to get really real and focused. It's been frankly very superficial in many ways, and I hope voters are now beginning to really focus." 
Guidant takes insurers to court 
Fight prompted by medical device failure 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Guidant Corp. said it is suing its insurers over coverage of costs from safety problems with a medical device that led to $92 million in federal fines, product liability lawsuits and other expenses. 
One of Guidant's insurance carriers also has sued the med­ical device maker, the Indianapolis-based company 

said  in  a  filing  with  the  
Securities  and  Exchange  
Commission.  

The fmes grew out of a crimi­nal investigation of a Guidant subsidiary's failure to report problems with the Ancure blood-vessel patching device. 
As part of a plea agreement reached in June, the subsidiary, Menlo Park, Calif.-based EndoVascular Technologies Inc., acknowledged it misled the Food and Drug Administration by not disclosing that the device was linked to 12 deaths and thousands of injuries. Doctors who implanted the device reported parts sometimes got stuck in arteries. Some also reported trouble removing the device's plastic sleeve. 
Guidant recorded a $17 mil­lion second-quarter charge from costs to discontinue the device, which was used to cure aneurysms in the blood vessels leading to the heart. Guidant also closed EndoVascular, which accounted for less than 2 percent of the parent compa­ny's $3.2 billion in sales last year. 
In addition to the federal 
fines, Guidant faces lawsuits 
seeking damages over patient 
deaths and injuries. 
Guidant said in its SEC filing 

Wednesday that it had settled 
11 of 14 lawsuits filed before 

the June plea agreement. 
Since June, Guidant has been 

served with about 15 more indi­
vidual complaints. Two lawsuits 
that could gain class-action cer­
tification in Northern California 
also are pending. 
Guidant had previously said it 

expected its liability insurance 
would cover any losses. 
But Wednesday's filing said 

one of Guidant's carriers, 
Allianz Insurance Co., had flled 
a lawsuit in DuPage County, Ill., 
that seeks to rescind or deny 
coverage. 
Guidant said it has sued Allianz and other carriers in Marion County Superior Court in Indianapolis to preserve its coverage rights. 
Guidant ·said it "continues to make progress in managing its product liability exposure" from the Ancure device. 
Allianz, a German insurer, seeks financial damages in its lawsuit and relief from cover­age obligations to Guidant. The company's complaint says Guidant's insurance claims "include a request for reim­bursement for a $49 million civil settlement made in con­junction wi.th a criminal plea and multiple civil actions" involving the Ancure device.

Bombing increases push for democracy 
Associated Press 
RIYADH -The bombing that killed 1 7 people in the Saudi capital is intensifying pressure for democratic reform in Saudi Arabia, and is likely to under­cut the militants' support among Arabs who previously sympathized to some degree with their goals. 
While some have rejoiced over Saturday's suicide car bombing, many in the Arab world are shocked that it tar­geted Arabs and Muslims. 
The bombing -the work of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida network, according to U.S. and Saudi officials -hit a housing compound in Riyadh that the attackers must have known houses Arab families. As a result, said Saudi political ana­lyst Dawood al-Shirian, many Saudis who felt some sympathy for bin Laden or even saw jus­tification for the Sept. 11 attacks are now beginning to question his goals. 
"When they see the images of dead children, when they see the images of a dead moth­er, if one of their own dies, they will turn away from the militants," said al-Shirian. "That's what will isolate the militants." 
On the streets of the capital one evening this week, after breaking their daily Ramadan fast, some Muslims expressed fear such attacks would sully Islam or encourage its ene­mies. 

Khalid al-Sultan, 32, a cater­ing company employee, called it "un-Islamic." Abdul-Rahman al-Sheikh, a 41-year-old busi­nessman, said al-Qaida mili­tants are "not only a threat to the people in the kingdom but also a threat to humanity and our peaceful religion." 
That feeling was not univer­sal, however. In Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, many Arabs have fallen back on conspiracy theories about America and Israel engineering the bombing -or at least letting it happen -in order to discredit Islam. 
"I have the feeling that those who did it can't be Muslims. Why not Americans?" lawyer Fatma Lasheen said in Cairo. "The American Embassy closed the day of the opera­tion. And if not, why didn't they foil this operation if they knew about it? Don t you think it is strange?" 
The U.S. Embassy in Riyadh had closed because of fears an attack was imminent, but U.S. officials said the intelligence did not say where it might happen. 
UNITED KINGDOM 

Royal tabloid rumors abate 
Associated Press 

LONDON -It was all good news for Prince Charles on British front pages Thursday. For the first time in nearly two weeks, he wasn't mentioned on any of them. 
The storm over the allegation that couldn't be reported has abated. 
But can it last? Given the public's media-fed fascination with Charles, his former mar­riage and royals in general, don't count on it. 
"Why are we reading this endless bilge about the 'dam­aging allegations' against the Prince of Wales?" Conservative legislator Boris Johnson said in his Daily Telegraph column Thursday. 
"Is it the media's insatiable lust for readers and viewers, that they will print what they know to be the most pathetic and ludicrous lies?" 
The odd affair of the unspo­ken allegation began Nov. 1, when a British court granted an injunction to stop the Mail on Sunday newspaper from printing the allegations of a 
. former royal valet, George Smith. It also forbade identifi­cation of a "royal servant" who had claimed the story was libelous, and sought the injunc­tion. The gag order began to unravel, however, when The Guardian newspaper went to 
court to argue that the identity of royal servants who sue should not be given a cloak of anonymity which was denied to ordinary Britons. 
The Guardian prevailed, and identified the suing servant as Michael Fawcett, former senior aide to Charles. 
The Guardian emphasized that it didn't believe the allega­tions, adding that they "differ from the highly colored rumors about royal affairs which have surfaced recently in the tabloids." 

With Charles clearly in the spotlight, he authorized a statement identifying himself as the "senior royal" who did­n't do whatever it was that hadn't been reported. 
"This allegation is untrue. The incident which the former employee claims to have wit­nessed did not take place," said the statement issued by the prince's private secretary, Sir Michael Peat. 
It added that the former ser­vant who made the allegation "unfortunately ... has suffered from post-traumatic stress dis­order and has previously suf­fered from alcoholism." 
Nonetheless, it soon became known that Smith alleged that he had been raped by another royal servant, and that he also claimed to have seen Charles involved in an "incident." 
Newspapers in Britain didn't say much more about the "inci­dent." But a name reported in one story, an apparent fact dropped in another, and a large hint in one of the pictures published in several papers fed the rumors. 
Charles' denial seemed only to make it worse. 
Graphic versions of the "inci­dent" turned up on the Internet. Some newspapers on the continent, not restrained by British courts, were explicit about the report. 
But those papers weren't on the newsstands in places like 
W.H. Smith, Britain's big news and book retailer. Not our fault, said Smith, saying the distributor hadn't delivered the papers. The distributor would­n't talk. 
Charles' former press aide, Mark Bolland, who said he was trying to be helpful, disclosed that a senior royal servant had once asked him whether Charles was bisexual. That question fit neatly, in huge type, on the front page of last Sunday's News of the World, the nation's largest-selling 
newspape~ Bolland~ unequ~­
ocal denial was in the small type. 
The episode followed yet another round of raking over the ashes of Charles' marriage to Princess Diana. 
The Daily Mirror tabloid was basking in its success in serial­izing a book by Paul Burrell, Diana's former butler.

The rape of the land 
During his presidential campaign, President George W. Bush declared himself a "conservationist" rather than an environ­mentalist. While for once his panache for linguistic inventiveness happened upon an actual word, his statement remained mis­leading. In the 

time since his elec- John lnfranca  
tion, Bush has done much to  
undermine envi- Dissident  
ronmental initia­tives: increasing logging on public  Poetry  

land, lowering emission standards and fail­ing to investigate potential violations of the Oean Air Act. His decisions have repeatedly put the concerns ofspecial interests and industry above public opinion and public health. 
This past week the attorneys general in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut instigated litigation to compel power plants in that region to decrease pollution. Thic; followed the Bush Administration's decision to abandon over 50 investigations ofpoten­tial Oean Air Act violations. The Environmental Protection Agency's new standards, which halted these investiga­tions, are the product of industry com­plaints presented two years ago to Vice President Dick Cheney's clandestine energy task force. While in the past the upgrading ofpower plants required improved pollu­tion controls, the utility companies man­aged to compel Cheney to eliminate this rule for the sake ofproducing more power (and of course greater profit). In addition to dismissing their own litigation, the EPA's new standards have also weakened the legal basis of the cases being pursued by the states. 
Unfortunately, this is only the most recent example ofthe Administration's failure to take advantage of the federal government's ability to protect the environment and the health ofAmerk.an citizens. President Bush's decisions often pay little heed to either the conclusions of studies made by his own EPA or to public opinion. Consider the recent decision to reverse a Clinton Administration plan to phase out snowmo­bile usage in Yellowstone National Park. After conducting its own study, the Bush Administration's EPA concluded that allow­ing snowmobiles in Yellowstone caused unnecessary pollution and disturbed wildlife. When the Interior Department asked for public opinion on the issue they received 360,000 responses and four out of five supported banning snowmobiles. In the end the administration not only decided to continue allowing their use, they even increased the number ofsnowmobiles that will be allowed. 
Disdain for public opinion on environ­mental policy appears to be a common practice for this administration. An even more glaring example can be found in the decision to open two million acres of land in Utah to exploration for gas and oil. The Bureau of Land Management received 25,200 comments opposing the project and less than 200 in supported. Nonetheless, the plan was approved anyway. Such lack of concern for the opinion ofenvironmentally concerned citizens should not be surprising from a president who, according to a biog­rapher, refers to environmentalists as "Green-green-lima-beans." 
Many of these environmental policies are the product ofVice President Cheney's Energy Task Force, a group that met short­ly after the beginning of the Bush presiden­cy to devise administration energy policy. Their meetings, which occurred behind closed doors, involved testimony from hun­dreds ofindividuals. Many were energy industry lobbyists and executives (including Enron's Kenneth Lay) but few were envi­ronmentalists. This past September, for the fourth time, the courts rejected efforts by the Bush Administration to keep documents from those meetings secret. Nonetheless, the administration continues to seek ways to avoid releasing them. 
Earlier this year New York's Republican Governor, George Pataki, annolll1ced a new standard that will require, within the next 
10 years, that one-fourth of all electricity 
sold in New York come from renewable 
energy sources. In light of such bold action, 
what seems to be missing from President 
Bush's administration are the political will 
to refuse the demands of the energy lobby 
that helped finance his election and the 
desire to show any interest in the opinions 
and health of concerned citizens. 
The result is an energy policy focused on production in the form of coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear energy, but which offers only distant hopes ofmore renewable ener­gy sources and no incentives for energy conservation. Ironically enough, President Bush's own Western White House (his pri­vate home in Crawford, Texas) boasts a geothermal heating and cooling system. a passive solar design and a cistern that col­lects water for irrigation use. These fea­tures do not simply conserve energy. they also save money. But they are features the average American cannot afford absent government initiatives directed at energy conservation and an increased commitment to renewable energy sources. 
Such initiatives are not part of this admin­istration's policies, nor will they be so long as our energy policy is formulated behind closed doors and absent respect for both the environment and public opinion. American citizens should demand their president show greater concern for the wel­fare ofhis citizens and the land they inhab­it. So long as the energy industry's dona­tions fill this administration's campaign cof­fers a change in policies seems wilikely. As much as it might soon be necessary, I would not hold your breath waiting for such a change.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Fashion isn't important at Notre Dame 
As a senior who can't help but read the train wrecks in the Viewpoint section, I've looked at the same four or five arguments repeated each year. The charming debate between students and religious Nazis over whether or not homosexuality is okay is my personal favorite for anI-can't­believe-this-person-exists smirk, but the rants on student body unity are always a great source of unintentional humor as well. Emily Howald did little more than state the obvious in her Nov. 10 column about our homogenous fashion sense. Anne Morrison, in her letter to the editor, apparently thinks that following the "fash­ion trends" of the majority is prerequisite for being a part of the community. 
In her Nov. 12 reply, Morrison was "appalled" by the column, believing that Howald's article could "further detach" students with less economic privilege who can't afford such all-important brands as Abercrombie. Howald's article was a decla­ration of war, apparently, as Morrison states it "is actually a united front with which you pit the people that can afford to dress that way against those that can­not." 
Morrison cares a bit 

too much about fash­ion. She also overesti­mates the fashion authority and overall coolness of the student body. The Notre Dame girls I see around campus do dress similarly, but I wouldn't necessari­ly call an oversized sweatshirt, sweat­pants, sneakers, reading glasses and a ponytail a big chunk of anyone's pay­check. Nor would I say that it hinges on being part of the community, unless you're the type who needs to blend in with your surroundings. Maybe one of the aforementioned girls is buying $50 sweat­pants at the bookstore and the other found her pair at Salvation Army for $2, but I can't tell the difference as I pass them on the quad. 
Why be threatened by the fact that a large percentage of students have bland, unoriginal and interchangeable wardrobes? You probably know exactly who I'm talking about when I say "that one girl with short black spiky hair who 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 
always wears funky pants," but have no idea who "that girl with the black pointy shoes and wool sweater" is. To this I give a resounding "so what," and you should, too. As someone who can barely afford utilities or replacement tires (my car is, a week later, still sitting on a street near Roseland with a flat), I am quite happy to dress in old T-shirts and the same three pairs of pants for no other reason than I like them. The same goes for many of those who are swimming in a sea of Old Navy sweaters. Does Dave Matthews make you feel threatened, too? He's also bland and all over campus. 
I would argue that Notre Dame students are defmed by their lack of effort to keep up with fashion trends. It doesn't take nearly as much time to pick something out of one of your roommate's catalogs as it does to read fashion magazines, haunt 
consignment shops, and find that 
Homogeneity in fashion is cer­tainly not an act of exclusion by the Notre Dame com­
munity, unless one thinks 
that clothes defme the person, in which case most of us could be defined by the word "blah." We actually pro­mote blending in with everyone else here, if 
you haven't noticed, and all10 of the underprivi­leged here can easily 
choose to do so by fmding something boring to wear. Apparently, being part of 

Morrison's community requires 
wearing "vintage clothing, band T-shirts or even homemade clothes." She was even so kind as to point out where we should look for her in the dining hall. In short, Morrison's article read more like a plea for recognition than a plea for unity. Your friends "don't wear Notre Dame apparel on any given day" -good for them. I'll be sure to wave as I pass the "first table on the left" in North Dining Hall. Maybe I'll even throw you a copy of ''The Hipster Handbook. ..

light our community's 'spirit of 
inclusion' for gay, lesbian, and 
bisexual students, faculty and 
staff." 

There are two components of SS. 
First, students, recruited through 
OutreachND (an unrecognized 
organization of gay, lesbian, bisexu­
al, transexual and questioning stu­
dents), distribute prayer cards 
bearing a symbol of "solidarity" at 
the Basilica Masses and to dorms 
for Sunday night Masses. Second, 
the priests at each mass discuss the 
issue of homosexuality at Notre 
Dame and the "spirit of inclusion" 
in their homilies. 
SS was designated for Nov. 9 this 
year not only because it was a 
home football game, but also a par­
ent weekend -the University 
would be able to demonstrate its 
"spirit of inclusion" to its extended 
Notre Dame family. 
This year, however, SS did not 
happen. 
Although Campus Ministry ordered the prayer cards, recruited volunteers to glue 3,000 stickers onto the cards and reserved a room to assemble them, they did not save the date. As a result, Nov. 9 was scheduled as Mission Sunday. The 
11:45 a.m. Basilica Mass collection went to Holy Cross missions and the homily praised ministering in Bangladesh. Outside, six students warmed their hands and waited to distribute prayer cards for Solidarity Sunday. Sadly, their efforts were futile. 
As one of those six students, I dis­tributed cards at four Masses over the weekend. I took charge of the event when I realized Thursday that a sign-up sheet for volunteers to distribute the cards hadn't been established. On Friday afternoon, I discovered that there were still 500 stickers to glue onto prayer cards but that the office they were in had been locked for the weekend. By Saturday, only five people had signed up to distribute. I assigned them to four Masses (two after Saturday's game and two Sunday morning). Plans had not been made to distribute cards to dorms. 
To make a long story short, 
thanks to frantic delegation, all of 
the cards were delivered to the 
dorms by Sunday afternoon. But no 
one knew what they were for. 
SS is annual tradition: why did it 
go so badly this year? . 
In previous years, students with several years of experience with OutreachND and the Standing Committee for Gay and Lesbian Student Needs made the event hap­pen almost single-handedly. This year's leadership, however, in both OutreachND and the Standing Committee, is largely new and inex­perienced. This led to three-way pointing where Campus Ministry looked to OutreachND, OutreachND looked to Campus Ministry and the Standing Committee, and the Standing Committee looked to Campus Ministry to take care of it. 
So no one did. 
It is particularly ironic that CM relies on OutreachND to create the event when Student Activities has rejected OutreachND's applications for club status claiming there is "no need" for the organization. 
This year Notre Dame was ranked first on th<' Princeton Review's list of schools where "alternative lifestyles are not an alternative." In an effort to disprove this ranking, I suggest the University take full responsibility for SS. 
The way SS faltered reflects very badly on the University. A more cynical person could claim it demonstrates a systematic and even intentional marginalization of "alternative lifestyles." The nega­tive atmosphere toward gay, lesbian and bisexual students is prevalent on campus. A true promotion of the "spirit of inclusion" would fight against this atmosphere by assuring Solidarity Sunday is a well-publi­cized and well-run event. 
With continued effort by the Notre Dame community, particularly the administration, I believe our foot­ball ranking can easily exceed our "no alternative lifestyle" ranking.

then presented their first piece in English, a three-part arrangement of Orlando Gibbons's ··A Hymne to God the Father," which implores the Lord for forgiveness for a life of sin. 
The Chamber Orchestra then returned to the stage and performed Johann Sebastian Bach's "Brandenburg Concerto No. 3," with selections from the Allegro and Adagio portions of the piece. "The reason we were able to do the 3rd Brandenburg tonight is because we had strong violas," notes. Blachly. He also went on to say that a strong viola section has often been hard to find in his experience and that being fortu­nate enough to have Adam Shanko and Christina Knuth provided the opportunity to perform the "Brandenburg" for the first time in close to 10 years. 

The Chorale returned and performed "Nunc Dimittis," by Henry Purcell, an arrangement of Luke 2:29, which provides the source for the "Glory Be" which is recit­ed during such services as the Rosary. They then per­formed two by Francis Poulenc. The first was "Videntes Stellam," based on Matthew 2:11, which describes the Magi's trip to shower the newborn Jesus with gifts. The second. "Timor et Tremor" is based on Psalms 54, 6, and 30, and reflects a fear for the Lord and an imploring for His help.

What makes "Circumdederunt Me," "Nunc Dimlttis," "Videntes Stellam," and "Timor et Tremorso" unique is that· they are very short scripture passages sung in many dif­ferent ways and combina­tions of voices that lend 
themselves to five-or six-minute pieces. 
Finally, the Chamber Orchestra joined the Chorale on stage and gave a combined performance of Bach's Cantata, "Aus der Tiefen (Out of the Depths)." The Cantata is an arrange­ment of Psalm 130 in five parts. The first movement is titled "Aus der Tie fen," and is based on verses one and two of Psalm 130. The second movement, based on the third and fourth verses, is titled "So du Willst," and featured Matthew Smedberg as the bass soloist. 
Smedberg gave an inspiring per­formance filled with very low notes held for long periods. "Ich Harre des Herrn," the third movement, is based on verse five and is three simple verses presented with remarkable depth and complexity by the Chorale. The fourth movement, "Meine Seele Wartet," featured Brian Manternach of the music Department as the guest tenor soloist. 
The concert concluded with Bach's fifth movement, titled "Israel, Hoffe auf den Herrn," based on verses seven and eight of Psalm 130. "The Bach cantata tonight was selected because we had a great bass singer to sing the bass solo," Blachly said, and dent in charge who begins by choos­ing a general section of the country they want to tour in. They then call alumni groups in that area to see which ones would like to sponsor per­formances. 
"We'll get one concert set before the others, and the rest fall into place," said Blachly. Every three years, the group travels abroad dur­ing the summer, performing in such locations as Rome, Orvieto, Spoleto, Assisi, Siena, Florence, Venice, Padua, Bavaria and Austria.

The skill needed for such difficult pieces presented in several languages reflects the hard work put into rehearsing for the evening's perform­ance. The Orchestra blended very well as a group for such a small ensemble, and it balanced itself very well with the Chorale in the Cantata.

Bryant makes first court appearance 
Associated Press A 
EAGLE, Colo. -Kobe Bryant made his first court appearance Thursday before the judge who will handle his sexual assault trial, saying nothing as the parents of his accuser sat just a few feet away. 
It was the first time family members of the 19-year-old woman have attended a hear­ing in the case and the first time they have seen the Los Angeles Lakers' guard in per­son, prosecution spokes­woman Krista Flannigan said. 
Besides the parents, two brothers and a cousin of the woman were present. The family left the courthouse without commenting, though Flannigan said they told her they were glad they came. 
Bryant, who played a home game in Los Angeles the night before, sat calmly through the 12-minute procedural hearing, occasionally whis­pering to one of his attorneys. He left immediately after­ward but Lakers officials said bad weather kept him from arriving in time for practice. 
The defense waived Bryant's rights to be advised of the sexual assault charge against him and the penalty he faces if convicted -four years to life in prison and 20 years to life on probation. Bryant's $25,000 bail was left unchanged. 
"We have decided to follow the court's usual procedure and not enter a plea as of today," defense attorney Pamela Mackey said...1 fully advised my client of the charge against him and the possible penalty." 


Judge Terry Ruckriegle set a pretrial hearing for Dec. 19 and another for Jan. 23 to settle various motions. Bryant will have to appear at both hearings to show he is com­plying with conditions of his bond, Flannigan said. 
Attorneys on both sides said they would need two to three weeks for a trial, and the· judge said his staff would begin looking at potential dates. 
Bryant is accused of raping the woman June 30 at a mountain resort near Edwards where she worked and he was a guest. Bryant, 25, says the two had consen­sual sex. 
He isn't expected to enter a plea until his arraignment, which hasn't been scheduled. After a formal plea, state law requires the trial must be scheduled within six months unless Bryant waives his right to a speedy trial. 
The Dec. 19 hearing will examine whether the woman's medical records and records from a rape crisis center should be given to the defense and whether anyone involved in the case has been leaking information. 

COLLEGE BASKETBALL 

Marquette tops St. John's in opener 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Opening games are seldom works of art. Marquette and St. John's proved that Thursday night in the Coaches vs. Cancer Classic. 
Travis Diener scored 18 points and No. 23 Marquette, despite not having a field goal over the final 4:20, beat the Red Storm 52-45 at Madison Square Garden. 
This was a sloppy season open­er for two teams looking to replace their stars -Dwyane Wade at Marquette and Marcus Hatten at St. John's. After one game both spots are still up for grabs. 
"We are a work in progress." Marquette coach Tom Crean said. "We have some veterans like Travis and some young guys try­ing to step up. I am excited with the win. We earned it. We have a ton of things we have to get bet­ter at and that's a first game." 
Marquette shot 29.6 percent (16-for-54), while the Red Storm were 16-for-51 (31.4 percent). The Golden Eagles had 20 turnovers, two more than St. John's. 
"Both teams did a good job defensively but one team missed more free throws and layups than the other and that was the difference," Red Storm coach Mike Jarvis said. 
Diener was the offensive star of the game -no one else scored more than 11 points -and he was 3-for-11 from the field. 
including missing all five of his 2­point attempts. He was 9-for-1 0 from the free throw, however, and that's where Marquette pre­vailed, going 14-for-16 compared to 11-for-22 for St. John's. 
Diener, who played all 40 min­utes at the point. didn't have a turnover. 
"We weren't expecting to shoot that bad but we'll take a win when we can get one," Diener said. "Credit St. John's. We didn't take care of the ball the way we wanted to. We'll get better at that." 
Grady ~eynolds led St. John's with 11 points, while Kyle Cuffe had 10. The Red Storm were 2­for-12 from 3-point range. 
"We didn't quit," Cuffe said. "We made a few mental mistakes and that can be fixed." 
Marcus Jackson's tip-in with 
4:22 left gave the Golden Eagles a 44-36 lead, but that was their last field goal of the game. 
Freshman Daryll Hill hit a 3­pointer and then scored on a layup after a steal at midcourt to bring the Red Storm to 46-43 with 2:27 to go. 
Diener and Steve Novak then made six straight free throws for Marquette to seal the win. 
..I'm not worried about us shooting the ball," Crean said. "We'll get there." 
The Golden Eagles announced last week that they would leave Conference USA and join St. John's in the Big East. In 2005­06, this will be a conference match up.

IOC says transsexuals can enter competition 
Associated Press 
LONDON -Athletes who have undergone sex change operations will be eligible to compete in the Olympics for the first time under new rules being finalized by the IOC. 
The International Olympic Committee convened a meeting in Sweden last month of med­ical experts in the field and will announce its policy in the next few weeks. 
"We will have no discrimina­tion," IOC medical director Patrick Schamasch told The Associated Press on Thursday. "The IOC will respect human rights." 
Details are still being worked out, but Schamasch said trans­sexual athletes will be eligible for the Olympics once they have passed a certain amount of time after sex-change sur­gery. 
"The trend is to have an inel­igibility period," he said. "Then after certain conditions have been fulfilled, the athlete will be able to compete in his or her new sex." 
The exact length of the wait­ing period hasn't been deter­mined. Schamasch said offi­cials want to make sure that any side effects of hormone therapy have worn off. 
Schamasch said he didn't know whether there were any potential transsexual athletes in line to compete in next sum-
You turn 21, and all you've got for me is lite beer? 
Happy Birthday, MeFly! 
-Biff 
mer's Athens Olympics, but noted that several international sports federations have asked the IOC for guidance. 
"We need to be proactive," he said. 
The rule covers both male-to­female and female-to-male cases. 
Some contend transsexual athletes have a physical advan­tage against other women. Men have higher levels of testos­terone and greater muscle-to­fat ratio and_ heart and lung capacity. However, doctors say, testosterone levels and muscle mass drop after hormone ther­apy and sex-change surgery. 
Until 1999, the IOC conduct­ed gender verification tests at the Olympics but the contro­
versial  screenings  were  
dropped  before  the  2000  
Sydney Games.  

One reason for the change was that not all women have standard female chromosomes. In addition, there are cases of people who have ambiguous genitalia or other congenital conditions. 
Over the decades, there have been various accusations of men impersonating women and competing in the Olympics. 
"The eligibility of transsexu­als to participate needs to be clarified and dealt with," Arne Ljungqvist, the IOC medical commission chairman who organized the meeting of experts in Stockholm. 
NFL 

Wheatley's te,mper flares 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO Oakland Raiders running back Tyrone Wheatley hit a photographer outside a feder­al courthouse Thursday, hours prior to testifying before a grand jury probing a nutritional supplements lab. 
Wheatley was one of five NFL players -including four Raiders to appear Thursday before the panel. Others included former NFL defensive player of the year Dana Stubblefield and Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Johnnie Morton. 
Also appearing before the grand jury Thursday was Marion Jones, who won an unprecedented five track medals in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 
"I can't make any comment, you guys. I would if I could, but I can't," Jones said as she left the grand jury room fol­lowing her afternoon appear­ance. 

Wheatley threatened and cursed at a group of photog­raphers and TV cameramen outside the building, then raised his right fist and slapped photographer Noah Berger hard on the right wrist after Berger took a photo of him Thursday morn­ing. 
Berger, a freelance photog­rapher on assignment for The Associated Press, said he was not hurt. He filed a report with the Federal Protective Service, but it was not clear whether Wheatley would be charged. 
Wheatley, who appeared before the grand jury in the afternoon, declined to com­ment when asked repeatedly about the incident. 
The five players -also including Raiders fullback Chris Hetherington and defensive tackle Chris Cooper -were the first non-track and field athletes to testify in the case. 
Stubblefield, the NFL defen­sive player of the year in 1997 while with the San Francisco 49ers, declined to comment after his morning appearance. His attorney, Michael Armstrong, also refused to comment. 
Morton, who had four sea­sons with more than 1,000 yards receiving for the Detroit Lions before joining the Chiefs two seasons ago, also refused to comment after his morning appearance. 
Track and field stars includ­ing Tim Montgomery, the world record-holder at 100 meters and Jones' boyfriend, have appeared before the panel in previous weeks. Dozens of other athletes, including baseball's Barry Bonds and Jason Giambi and boxer Shane Mosley, also have been subpoenaed. 
It's not clear what, if any, drug charges might result from the investigation.

Policy said Green was already enrolled in the league's treatment program, and the suspension indicated the second-year back had twice violated his personal program. 
Because of confidentiality, Policy does not know if Green's involvement in the program stemmed from him twice being suspended for marijuana use while at Boston College. 
The Browns said the viola­tion involved the use of alco­hol. · 
Under the NFL's treatment policy, any player who fails a drug test for the first time is referred to a doctor. A second violation results in an auto­matic four-game suspension. 
''I'm confident he's going to work at overcoming whatever problems he has and we are going to support him 100 percent," Policy said. 
Green was arrested Oct. 27 on charges of drunken driv­ing and marijuana posses­sion. 
The Browns suspended him for last Sunday's game at Kansas City for "conduct detrimental to the team," and the league will count that game as part of its suspen­sion. 
Green, who will lose $70,588, was informed of his NFL suspension on Saturday and decided to forgo an appeal, the league said. He is not eligible to return to Cleveland's active roster until Dec. 1, and can't play until Dec. 8 when the Browns host the Rams.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL 
Terrapins win 27-17 as Allen runs wild 
Associated Press 
COLLEGE PARK, Md. -Josh Allen picked the ideal stage to shed his image as Maryland's "other" running back. 
Allen ran for a career-high 257 yards and two touchdowns, and Maryland kept its Atlantic Coast Conference title hopes alive by defeating Virginia 27-17 Thursday night. 
Bruce Perry, the sixth-leading rusher in Maryland history, could not play because of a severe ankle sprain. It didn't matter, though, because Allen carried the load all by himself in the nationally televised con­test. 
"Josh Allen had an unbelievable night," Terrapins coach Ralph Friedgen said. "He really came through for us big-time." 
Allen ran for 154 yards in the first half,. when the Terrapins scored on four of five possessions to take a 24-7 lead. That proved to be enough offense to provide Maryland with its second win over the Cavaliers in 11 tries since 1991. 
The Terrapins {7-3, 4-2) can finish tied atop the ACC if North Carolina State beats league-leading Florida State on Saturday and Maryland wins its final two games. 
A year ago, Maryland's bid for a second straight ACC title was ruined by a 48-13 loss to Virginia. Not only did the Terrapins extract a measure of revenge, but they fin­ished unbeaten {6-0} at home for only the 19th time in the 111-year history of the program. 
Allen, a sophomore, carried 38 times . The 25 7 -yard effort ranks third in school history and was nearly twice his previous career high of 136 yards. 
"I wanted to make sure I could carry the load like my team needed me to," he said. "The offensive line played a great game. My performance is just a reflection of what they did." 
His numbers may have surprised the 51,027 fans and the TV audience, but Virginia coach AI Groh knew Allen had the potential to shred any defense. 
"He's been doing it for quite a while," Groh said. "Unless you've been out of the country, you know that Josh Allen is a quality back. He played like one tonight." 
Matt Schaub ran for a touchdown, threw for a score and nearly brought the Cavaliers {5-5, 3-4) back in the second half. He passed for 186 yards to overtake Shawn Moore as the school's career leader in passing yardage. 
"We gave it a good go, but in our busi­ness there are no medals for trying. It looked to me like another chapter in the same story," Groh said. "Once again we just made it too hard on ourselves." 
Schaub's 14-yard touchdown pass to Alvin Pearman got the Cavaliers to 24-14 with six minutes left in the third quarter, and he directed a 46-yard drive that pro­duced a field goal with 9:15 left. 
But Maryland's Nick Novak kicked a 45­yard field goal with 3:42 to go after a 19­yard run by Allen produced a first down at the Virginia 29. 
The game was played in a 40 mph wind, and the temperature dipped near freezing. 
Maryland took the opening kickoff and moved 84 yards in 11 plays to go up 7-0. Allen ran eight times for 38 yards and the Virginia twice extended the drive with third-down penalties before Scott McBrien threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Latrez Harrison. 
The Terrapins made it 14-0 early in the second quarter when Allen scored from 1 after Jafar Williams outleaped Virginia safety Jermaine Hardy on a 41-yard com­pletion. 
At that point, Maryland held a 168-53 advantage in total yardage. 
Virginia quickly remedied that, moving 80 yards in nine plays to close to 14-7. A well-timed screen pass to Wali Lundy cov­ered 62 yards, setting up a 4-yard touch­down run by Schaub on a quarterback draw.

NO CROSS COUNTRY 
Irish prepare for Terre Haute run 
By JOE LINDSLEY 
Sports Writer 
About a year ago, both the men's and women's cross country teams ran in Terre Haute, Ind. in the NCAA Championships. 
Saturday, the Irish return to Terre Haute and its challeng­ing Lavern Gibson Championship Course to quali­fy for the national champ1­onships at the NCAA Great Lakes Regional. 
Both Irish squads have the opportunity to earn automatic bids to the title race if they fin­ish first or second in their respective races. Teams that do not finish that high can still make the national race 
beginning Monday, Nobember 17, 2003 through Friday, January 23, 2004 
through at-large bids, and the Irish are optimistic that they will qualify one way or the other. 
"If everyone runs well, we hope to qualify, either by auto­matic, or surely by an at-large bid," senior Brian Kerwin said. "We just want to get into nationals." 
While the men will take either an automatic or an at­large bid, the women's team­ranked No. 4 in the nation ­are favored to win the Regional title. The women, fresh off their second-consecutive Big East conference victory, are returning to the regional race as defending champions. Last year was the only other time in program history the Irish had won the regional title.

will be available in the Office of Student Affairs 
' 
316 Main Building 

The women, who have been ranked in the top five all sea­son, have a strong lineup that will not bode well for their competition this weekend. 
Led by former All-Americans Molly Huddle and Lauren King, the Irish will be aided by two runners who were not able to contribute to last season's post­season success on the course. 
Senior Megan Johnson missed the end of last season due to an illness, and junior Kerry Meagher, who is in her first season running regularly with the varsity team, was sec­ond for the Irish at the Big East race two weeks ago.

Belles will be competing at Albion for the first time under coach Gregg PetcofT. But Saint Mary's 17 swimmers are willing to face the challenge against an Albion squad of 30 swimmers and divers. 
Even before Saint Mary's hits the water, the Belles are already_at a 32-point disadvan­tage as the team does not have any divers. 
"We are going to have to per­form 32 points better than [Albion] in swimming," PetcofT said. "It doesn't grant us any room for error or else we'll never make up that deficit." 
The swimmers must also beat out an Albion swimming team that is very comparable to Saint Mary's in several events. 
"Albion's times were very similar to our's last year," PetcofT said. "But [Albion] could really surprise us ... we are just going to have to get lucky."

NEW YORK-Eric Gagne was almost as perfect in NL Cy Young Award voting as he was on the mound. 
The Los Angeles Dodgers relief pitcher who convert­ed all 55 of his save chances this year received 28 of 32 first-place votes and 146 points to win the honor Thursday from the Baseball Writers' Association of America. 
It was just the ninth time a reliever won a Cy Young, the first in the NL since San Diego's Mark Davis in 1989. 
"We haven't seen a lot of relievers win that award, so I was a little worried," Gagne said during a tele­phone conference call. 
San Francisco's Jason Schmidt was second with two first-place votes and 73 points. Chicago's Mark Prior got the other first­place votes and was third with 60 points. 
Gagne, a 27 -year-old right-hander, was 2-3 with a 1.20 ERA and had 137 strikeouts and 20 walks in 82 1-3 innings. He was con­verted from a starter to a reliever after the 2001 sea­son and had 52 saves in 2002. 
"I knew I had the mental attitude to be a closer, it was just a matter of doing it in the major leagues," Gagne said. "As a starter, you have to be more relaxed, you have to control your emotions more." 
He is the only pitcher to reach 50 saves in more than one season and has converted 62 consecutive save chances since failing to hpld a lead against Arizona on Aug. 26, 2002, a major league record. 
"I don't really care about the streak," said Gagne, the first reliever to win a Cy Young since Oakland's Dennis Eckersley won the AL award in 1992. 
He is just the second Canadian to win a Cy Young, following Ferguson Jenkins of the Cubs in 1971. 
Gagne failed to hold a lead just once this season' -he allowed a two-run. go-ahead homer to Hank Blalock of Texas in the eighth inning of the All-Star game. 
Growing up in Mascouche, Quebec, Gagne started skating when he was 3 and thought he was headed to a career in the NHL. 
"They called me the goon when I was younger," he said. 
Gagne wears goggles on the mound because he can't wear contacts -his eyes have scars from getting hit by hockey sticks. 

IN BRIEF 
){oddick lo6.,es to Schnettler 
10 Masters t:up 
A champagne celebration follow­ing a defeat? Welcome to Andy Roddick's world. About 12 hours after being guar­
anteed the year-end No. 1 ranking. Roddick went out and lost to Rainer Schuettler 4-6, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (3) Thursday in round-robin action at the Tennis Masters Cup. 
Then Roddick's postmatch news conference was interrupted by a bubbly bath courtesy of friend and fellow pro Mardy Fish. 
"It's a very sweet day for me. I'm going to try to forget the fact that I didn't play well," Roddick said. "This was a culmination of the whole year. And I wasn't going to spoil that by having a bad attitude just because I didn't play well on one day." 
Roddick is 0-3 in 2003 against the sixth-ranked Schuettler, who kept grinding away throughout the windy match. 
"It's always something special if you win against No. 1," Schuettler said. "I don't think we both played our best tennis today." 
Roddick's strength, his serve, let him down late, with six of his eight double-faults in the third set, including one to set up match point. He then sailed a backhand long to end it with his 49th unforced error. 
That made Roddick's record in the round-robin portion 1-1. Schuettler is 2-0 and will make the semifinals regardless of how he fares in his last round-robin match. 
Roddick faces No. 4 Guillermo Coria on Friday for a semifinal berth. Coria defeated No. 7 Carlos Moya 6-2, 6-3 Thursday, converting his sixth match point when the 1998 French Open champion put a fore­hand into the net. Kane leads LPGA 
Tournament of Champions 
MOBILE, Alabama-Canada's Lorie Kane shot a 2-under 70 in windy conditions Thursday to take a one-stroke lead over Australia's Karrie Webb in the LPGA Tournament of Champions. 
''I'm not afraid of the wind," said Kane, winless since 2001. "I enjoy the wind because it's a challenge. 
"It's just one of those things where you have to concentrate on hitting solid shots, but it's tough for every­body. You just have to put your head down. play hard and see what hap­pens." 
Kane and Webb were the only players to break par, with the field averaging 75.9 strokes on the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail's Crossings Course at Magnolia Grove. 
"We've never played this course with a lot of wind -maybe a half­club wind at the most -and never out of the direction we played it today," said Webb, who had five birdies and four bogeys. 
"The greens are a little firmer and faster, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It was just different today with the wind."

Irish look to reverse early season troubles at home 
By MATT PUGLISI Sports Writer 
The men's swimming and 
diving team hopes to reverse 
its fortunes when the Irish (0-3 
in dual meets) dive back in the 
pool this afternoon to host No. 
19 Brigham Young, Iowa and 
Louisville at 2 p.m. 
"We like to have a target out there," head coach Tim Welsh said. "Both BYU and Iowa will present a nice [target] for us to chase." 
While Notre Dame's dual­meet record would suggest otherwise, Welsh says the young Irish squad is the best the University has ever had. 
"We know internally that this is the fastest that we've ever been," Welsh said. "It's not showing up in wins and losses because of the raised strength of schedule. Right now [the schedule] ~s still ahead of us." 
Last Friday, despite taking three of the top four spots in six of the eleven swimming events, Notre Dame was edged by Michigan State, 125.5­113.5. 
"If you look at the results, I think what you'll see is depth," Welsh said. "While we don't have that invincible man, the team as a whole is moving for­ward." 
On Dec. 4, the Irish host the three-day Notre Dame Invitational, a key event for the young team. 
"The Invitational is like a final exam for us," Welsh said. "The objective of the fall is to qualify the team for the Big East Championships in February, and we want to come out of [the Invitational] with all of our qualifying times met." 

The women's squad, con­versely, looks to continue its upswing when the Irish (2-1 in dual meets) welcome Louisville and Bowling Green at 6 p.m. this evening. 
"Both teams have some good kids, but I don't think that they're deep enough to chal­lenge us," head coach Bailey Weathers said. "As long as we beat their top kids, the meet should take care of itself." 
While the Irish don't have any particular goals for the contest, Weathers said he hopes to use the meet as an opportunity to gain additional practice and experience. 
"There really isn't any one thing that we are working on," Weathers said. "I just want to get the kids some more races before we leave fbr Texas next week." 
Notre Dame took 12 of 16 events in thrashing Big East rival Pittsburgh 184-116 last Friday. 
Overall. despite a rash of sickness this past week. Weathers said he is pleased with the team's progress on the young season. 
"We were [on track] before all the illness," Weathers said. "We'll have to see how that plays out, but I think we 'r,e 
,..
where we need to be at this point." 
Next Friday, the Irish hit the road to compete in the 3-day Texas A&M Invitational.

NO WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
Tough opening weekend to greet Irish 
ByJOE HETTLER Sports Editor 

Muffet McGraw believes fac­ing an easy opponent to begin the season is always nice, but her team will likely get more of out a game against a tougher foe. 
So instead of playing McNeese State or Western Michigan, No. 15 Notre Dame opens its season against No. 22 Auburn in the Women's Basketball Coaches Association tournament this weekend in Boulder, Colo. 
"It's a great challenge for us, to come right out of the gate and play a very good team" said McGraw, who begins her 17th season at Notre Dame. "I think mentally the team is ready for the season to begin." 
Even if the Irish do not win Friday night against the Tigers, McGraw said the team will still gain valuable experience from the contest. 
"It's kind of a no lose situa­
tion. If you lose, you learn and 
you move on," McGraw said. 

Auburn won the Women's National Invitational Tournament in 2002 and return all five starters from that team. They will challenge Notre Dame's ability to run the floor. "Auburn is a great team," McGraw said. "They're very athletic and very quick." 
Auburn coach Joe Ciampi said his Tigers are eager to face a solid opponent such as Notre Dame. 
"Notre Dame, as our season opening opponent, will prove to be an early test to see where we are right now," Ciampi said. 
McGraw believes one of the keys to the game will be the tempo. 
"We're pretty uptempo also so controlling the tempo will be a key to the game," McGraw said. "Our bench is pretty depleted with injuries so we'll have to

see." 
Notre Dame will be without Teresa Borton and Jeneka Joyce for tournament. Both are out with foot injuries. 
Besides the game's tempo, the Irish will have the difficulty of trying to stop Tiger junior Natasha Brackett. Brackett was named MVP of the WNIT last season and became the school's all-time leading scorer for a sophomore last season. 
McGraw isn't sure how her team will stop Brackett. 
"We're going to let her get her points," McGraw said. "I don't know if we have anyone that can stop her. She's a very good player and a very important player on their team." 
Notre Dame returns four starters from last season's Sweet Sixteen squad. Captain and guard La'Tania Severe will lead the offense, along with sophomore Megan Duffy. Duffy has played exceptionally in Notre Dame's first two presea­son games. 
Juniors Jacqueline Batteast, Katy Flecky and Borton will all play important roles for the Irish. Batteast is a member of the preseason Wooden All­American team and was a Second-Team Big East selection last season. 
Flecky and Borton played major role in Notre Dame's suc­cess in 2002-03 and will be expected to step up their games even more this season. 
Freshmen Crystal Erwin, Breona Gray and Susie Powers could all contribute from the start of the season, especially Erwin. She brings the Irish a physical offensive and defensive player. 
Notre Dame will face either Old Dominion or No. 15 Colorado on Saturday.

Irish go on the road to face Big East rivals 
By HEATHER VAN 
HOEGARDEN 
Spor[S Writer 

It's over. Now it's time to move on to more important things ­the Big East. 
The No. 12 Irish look to get back on track this weekend coming off a road loss on Tuesday to No. 14 Northern Iowa (22-4). The loss snapped the Irish's 14-game winning streak. 
"It was a disappointing loss," senior Jessica Kinder said of the four-game match. "Obviously, we wanted to go in and win, but it by no means stops our confi­dence." 
Tuesday's loss saw the Irish hit a mere .185 on the match and .000 in game three alone, the only game -ironically ­the Irish won, as the Panthers hit -.020 in that game. 
Now, the Irish (21-3) will try to rebound as they return to Big East play, where they are 10-0. Saturday, the Irish face West Virginia (6-19, 2-8) and Sunday they face Pittsburgh (20-4, 9-1) to wrap up the regular season conference schedule. 
"Our whole team is just plan­ning on playing our game," Jessica Kinder said. "I don't think there's any real huge adjustments that need to be made -it is just a matter of knowing that if we take care of our side of the court we can play with anybody." 
If the Irish win Saturday, they claim a share of the Big East regular season title. A win Sunday would give them the outright championship, as Pittsburgh is in second place. 
The Panthers come off a 3-0 win over West Virginia last Friday, and their one confer­ence loss came at the hands of Virginia Tech. But the Panthers are the team to beat for the Irish, having knocked off Miami earlier this season and clinching

a Big East tournament berth for the first time since 2000. 
But the Irish expect a chal­lenge in both games this week­end. They are led by senior set­ter Kristen Kinder, who had 49 assists against Northern Iowa, and sophomore middle blocker Lauren Brewster who had 14 kills and 9 blocks. Brewster is second in the country in blocks per game. Also contributing to the Irish this year have been libero Meg Henican (17 digs against the Panthers), Lauren Kelbley (11 kills) and Emily Loomis (13 kills, 8 digs). 
Still, going on the road will be a challenge for the Irish, who have yet to play their best vol­leyball of the season. 
"We have just been focused on having our best game of the season every game, and we haven't played to the top of our game yet in a single match," Jessica Kinder (8 kills, 9 digs on Tuesday) said. "So, regardless of who's on the other side of the net, we are using each match as an opportunity to play our best volleyball of the season. 
So what should the Irish do to play well? 
"I think it's just a matter of everyone knows what they need to do, individually each of us taking care of our roles on the team," Jessica Kinder said. "As a whole, we have to make sure everyone's on the same page, everyone's focused." 
This weekend will provide the Irish with two more chances to do just that, as they try to win the Big East for the ninth time in 10 years. Since volleyball has been played in the Big East, 17 of the 21 championships have gone to either Notre Dame or Pittsburgh. But the Irish are up to the challenge. 
"We're there," Jessica Kinder said. "We're at that level where we can play with great teams."

The Irish out shot the Friars 
15-6 in a 2-0 shutout victory at 
Glay Field. Captain and senior 
midfielder Greg Martin opened 
scoring 1 :40 into the contest on a 
head ball off a set up from junior 
defenseman Kevin Goldthwaite. 
Providence was overmatched, 
committing 14 fouls to just one 
for the Irish, and forward Devon 
Prescod put the game away late 
with a goal of his own. 

Prescod leads all Irish players with 12 goals, his twelfth coming in the quarterfinal match against Connecticut. The high point man on the team is senior forward Justin Detter, who after also tal­lying against the Huskies has 11 goals and four assists for 26 points. 
Providence will try to answer the Prescod/Detter attack with sophomore forward Eoin Lynch, who leads the Friars in scoring with 17 points and eight goals. 
Goalie Chris Sawyer -recent­ly named the College Soccer News National Player of the 
Week -and the defense have limited teams to one or zero goals in 17 of 19 games. Players in the back like juniors Goldthwaite and Jack Stewart have prevented many opposing forwards from even getting through to Sawyer. Freshman Greg Dalby, senior Kevin Richards and junior Christopher High will also have to maintain their stellar play of late. 
Notre Dame is 7-2-0 in the all­time series. Coach Bobby Clark has never lost to Providence with the Irish. The last time Notre Dame lost to the Friars was in 2000, also the last time the Irish fmished below .500 (7-8-2). 

Providence is also just 1-4-2 
against ranked teams this sea­
son. Notre Dame presently sits at 
No.5 in the nation. 
St. John's vs. Rutgers 
In the other semifinal match. No. 1 St. John's (14-4-1) will try to fend off No. 4 Rutgers (10-6­
3). 
Both teams scored in overtime 
of their quarterfinal matches to 
advance. St. John's beat eight­
seed Villanova, 2-1. while 
Rutgers defeated No. 5 Seton 
Hall, 1-0. 
St. John's hopes not to follow some foreboding Big East tradi­tion. Since the Big East tourna­ment began including eight teams in 1995, only once has the top seed won the Big East tour­nament. Last_ season, top-seed Boston College defeated Connecticut, 3-2, for the title. 
In addition, in the eight cham­pionship tournaments since 1995, the top-seed has advanced to the title game only three times (St. John's 1997, Connecticut 2001, Boston College 2002). 
Rutgers has played in the con­ference postseason·tournament every season since joining the league in 1995. The Scarlet Knights advance to the semifi­nals for the eighth time in nine appearances. 
St. John's and Rutgers each defeated Notre Dame this season by a combined score of 8-2.

Axford pitched in 17 games and started 12 for the Irish, going 5-2 with a 3. 95 ERA. He struck out 64 batters and walked 59 in just over 70 innings of work. 
Known for his mid-to-high 90's fastball, Axford has been a top prospect for Major League teams. He was eligible this season for the MLB draft, but he said he will now wait another year to see how he does next season before deciding whether to go pro. 
Despite the setback, Axford said he is determined to find his way back into Notre Dame's rotation. 
"It's all about what I do to make sure I come back," Axford said.

"At some juncture, it doesn't make any sense to say [we'll stay independent forever]," he said Nov. 4. "We don't know where the world is going to go. We're not going to sit here and guarantee that we're not going to be an independent."

tion of football. 
The ACC officials who spoke 
to USA Today said Notre Dame 
is considering sacrificing its 
football independence because 
of its uncertain future with the 
Bowl Championship Series. The 
Irish, who also have a lucrative 
television contract with NBC, 
have an agreement with the 
BCS conferences to be included 
in the season's four major bowl 
games if they finish high 
enough. But both the television 
contract and the BCS contract 
expire in 2005. 
Were Notre Dame to leave the Big East, as the USA Today report suggests, it would have to provide 2 7 months' notice and pay $5 million. And Big East spokesman John Paquette said the 16 Big East teams agreed to an informal five-year commitment to the league when the conference announced a week and a half ago it had expanded. 
"Let's not bury our head in the sand here and make some judgment that we have no idea is going to work forever," Heisler said when the Big East announced its expansion. "Is [football independence] impor­tant? Of course. Will that change? Nobody knows."

Willingham could still salvage this season by winning out and possibly earning a bowl berth. By closing out the s.eason on a winning note, the Irish could build some momentum for 2004. A lot will be learned about Willingham and his staff these next few weeks.  Quinn did a solid job of keeping the Irish in the game last week and eventually leading the comeback over Navy. He's only completed 45 percent of his passes on the season and has 11 interceptions with only six touchdowns in six games started.  Jones had another huge game last week against the Midshipmen with 221 yards rushing and two touchdowns. The fifth­year senior has averaged nearly 93 yards a game for Notre Dame in step­ping into the role of the team's primary back.  The Irish likely won't burn too many teams through the air, but they will be happy to stick to the running game if it's working. The Irish can use the play action pass if the running game is working. The receivers need to do a better job catching the ball.

2003 Schedule 


CoUGARS RusHING COUGARS PASSING SPECIAL TEAMS INTANGIBLES 
Notre Dame has been solid this year against some of the nation's bet­ter rushing attacks. The Irish have allowed 134 yards a game on the ground and rank 42nd nationally in rush defense. Notre Dame's opponents average only 3.17 yards per carry.  The Cougars throw the ball a lot, averaging 40 attempts a game. They have had some struggles at quarterback, however, as both Berry and Beck have taken a lot of reps at the position. Christensen -son of NFL great Todd Christensen -is the Cougars' top receiver.  Fitzpatrick may have gotten a big confidence boost with his game­winning field goal against Navy last week­end, but his punting is still struggling as he averages only 37 yards a kick. Duff has almost 200 yards on 20 punt returns this season.  Notre Dame is trying to make a late-season push for a minor bowl game by winning out the last three games on its schedule. The team should be pumped up for its last home game and the seniors should be up for Senior Day.  
BYU's rushing offense has been almost non­existent this season as the Cougars rank 11Oth in the nation in that cat­egory. They average only 102.7 yards per game rushing. Brathwaite has carried most of that load, with 82 yards a game.  Injuries and inexperience have hurt the Irish sec­ondary this season. Earl is out for the season, and Beckstrom and Ellick are still fighting for a starting corner position. The Irish pass defense ranks 43rd in the nation with 207 yards allowed per game.  Payne has been a reli­able kicker for the Cougars, converting 14 of 17 field goal attempts. Christensen is their leading punt returner with nearly eight yards per attempt. Cooper can be dangerous on kickoff returns.  The Cougars have not played a game since Oct. 30. This could be a bless­ing or a curse for them. It gives them a lot of rest and a lot of time to pre­pare for the Irish. but they could also come out for Saturday's game rusty from the layoff.  
The Cougars will likely have trouble movin the b d h th their offense.  The Cougars rely heavily on the pass, but they still have some weak­nesses there.

that we tried to outscore people. That's the one thing we talked about early in the season ­could we hang our hat on our defense a little bit more. 
"Of course, [when Jordan and Torrian] are on the floor more, you are automatically a better defen<;ive team." 
Jones recognizes along with Brey that this year's team cannot rely on its offensive firepower alone. The Irish need to use their athletic lineup and force turnovers. 
"Team defense has been the biggest point of emphasis since the last game," Jones said. "We are trying to get bet­ter at playing defense for 40 minutes and not just in

I think last game we played good team defense in having them shoot the -·1 ball, but we really didn't get underneath them and force tempo. I think that's something with the per­sonnel we have this year [that] we can do a little bit more than in the past." 

Those turnovers could lead to something the Irish didn't have a lot of last year-easy buckets. 


"I think as a coach, you are always adjusting to your personnel and trying to play off your strengths. Our strength last year was that we were an explosive offensive team, so we rest­ed on defense sometimes," Brey said. "This year with Jones <J.nd Cornette on the floor more, [Chris] Thomas and [Chris] Quinn out there, those four being on the floor a lot together, we feel we can be a better defensive team and take advantage of the person­nel we have. 
"Maybe we can take advantage of the person­nel we have and get some easy baskets off our defense." 
This team has been practicing since early September because of an October trip to Barbados. While Brey tries to simu­late game conditions in

practice, this team is still searching for its identity. 
And they're happy to play in front of a packed Joyce Center. 
"I think we just want to get a better feel for each other even though we've been practicing for a while with this foreign tour," Brey said. 
"Also, I think to get accustomed to playing in front of a sold-out crowd because this building should be sold out for just about every game."

Coming back to Notre Dame after declaring himself eligible for the NBA Draft as a sophomore, guard Chris Thomas is earning a number of big-time preseason distinctions. 
The Associated Press named Thomas on 19 of the 7 4 ballots in preseason All-American voting, allowing the junior from Indianapolis, Ind. to finish sixth in overall voting. 
"He probably should have been first-team quite frankly. I agree with 
[ESPN basketball analyst Dick] Vitale's team. I think over the course of the season, [Thomas] will ~ get the individual honors he deserves," Brey said. "My feeling is 
we have the best guard in the coun­try here, the best quarterback. He certainly has been a consistent leader and quarterback since we have started practicing in September."
The list is published on ESPN.com by Vitale. Thomas made Vitale's all-Rolls Royce First Team, to which Vitale names his top five players.

Cornette to start tonight
After sitting out the exhibition 
opener against the Hoop Group, for­
ward Jordan Cornette is fully 
healthy and will start against the 
Illinois All-Stars. 
"My knee's been healthy since 
Sunday. Basically, I worked myself 
in nice and slowly to get back into 
playing shape," Cornette said. 
"Coach [Brey] has put me in by 
picking his spots. I'm ready to go. 
I'm 100 percent and I'm looking for­
ward to it." 
Easing back into the lineup was ·difficult for Cornette last Wednesday having to watch from the bench. ~Tonight, he'll be the Notre Dame 
player with the jitters. 
"Some of these guys got to release 
that stress [last game]," Cornette 
said. "I had to sit there and watch 
that one. I'm a week overdue. I 
can't wait to get out there and let it 
all hang out." 
Kurz signs with Irish 
Brey signed the first member of his 2004 recruiting class Wednesday with the official commitment of Rob Kurz from William Penn Charter high school in Philadelphia. 
"I was really excited [about the signing]. I guess I was really excited last May when he committed, but we made it official yesterday," Brey said. "I think he's a guy who is so skilled and has such a good feel for the game as a bigger guy, he's going to be a guy who has a chance to help us right away. 
A 6-foot-8, 225-pound forward, Kurz averaged 18 points and 12 rebounds per game as a junior last season. 
Kurz verbally committed to the Irish on May 5, the same day Thomas declared for the NBA Draft. 
Future game time changes 
Two games on the Notre Dame schedule have different tip-off times than initially published. 
The Dec. 1 game at Marquette has been pushed back to 9 p.m. local time and the home game against Central Michigan on Dec. 6 was also pushed back an hour to a 9 p.m. tip­ofT.

Report says Irish are exploring ACC 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
Is Notre Dame still consider­ing changing conferences ­even if it means losing its foot­ball independence? 
In its Thursday edition, USA Today cited two anonymous sources who said Notre Dame had approached ACC officials about becoming full members in the conference. 
Notre Dame athletic director 
MEN'S BASKETBALL 

Kevin White, through the University's sports information department, issued a statement saying the Irish were "staying the course with the Big East" but that officials are "continu­ing to monitor the landscape" -essentially the same state­ment White issued when the Big East announced a five-team expansion Nov. 4. 
Although Notre Dame spokesman John Heisler did not specifically address the USA Today report, he said the 
school is standing by its state­ment. 
ACC commissioner John Swofford said in a statement his conference "has not initiat­ed discussions with anyone regarding further expansion," although he later added that the conference had "received some informal inquires con­cerning potential membership." 
The ACC did not specify if Notre Dame was one of the schools who had made any inquires. 
The issue of Notre Dame leaving the Big East in favor of the ACC isn't a new one. Almost two months ago, numerous reports said the con­ference -which recently added Miami, Virginia Tech and Boston College-was talk­ing with Notre Dame to gauge the school's interest in joining the ACC. At the time, Heisler said he had "no idea" if the Irish had been negotiating with the ACC and called the stories pure speculation.

Irish close out exhibitions tonight

"The Phonz" returns to the Joyce Center tonight. 
Eleven years after graduating from Notre Dame, LaPhonso Ellis headlines an Illinois All­Stars roster facing the Irish tonight in what will be Notre Dame's final exhibition tune-up before the season starts at home

Nov. 24 against Northern Illinois. 
Ellis played four years at Notre Dame and left his name all over the record books. He currently sits 11th in all-time scoring, third in all-time rebounding, second in field goal percentage and first in career blocks. In 1992, the Denver Nuggets selected Ellis with the fifth overall pick in the NBA Draft.

BASEBALL 
Axford out for season 
By JOE HETTLER Sports Editor 
It was one pitch too many. 
Irish pitcher John Axford fired his final pitch in his team's last game of fall base­ball and struck out the oppos­ing batter. But as he did, the junior fireballer heard some­thing pop in his right elbow. 
On Nov. 5, Axford underwent Tommy John surgery to repair a torn ligament and will be out for Notre Dames upcoming season. 
"My biggest concern is for the health of John Axford, not the health of the Notre Dame baseball team," Irish coach Paul Mainieri said. ''I'm con­cerned for him because he had high expectations -knew he was going to play an important role on the team." 

Tommy John surgery has occurred more frequently with professional and collegiate pitchers in the last several years. The surgery involves removing a tendon from another part of the body and attaching it to the elbow to function as a ligament. The recovery time is usually one year and, according to Mainieri, the player can even come back stronger and healthier than before the sur­gery. 
But even with a positive diagnosis, Axford is disap­pointed he will not pitch this season. 
''I'm trying to stay as posi­tive as I can about it," Axford said. "[My goals] are pushed

WOMEN'S INTERHALL FOOTBALL 
Badin and Lewis set to face off in the Stadium 
By ANNE BRUSKY Sports Writer 
The women's interhall football championship Sunday has all the makings of a David and Goliath match-up. 
After months of anticipation, top-seeded Lewis will face third­ranked Badin at noon in Notre Dame Stadium. 
"It's going to be a good game," Badin center Lindsay Wind said. "We know Lewis is a great team. They're very strong offensively and defensively, and they'll put up a great fight." 
Lewis, the largest women's dorm on campus, is undefeated up to this point and, after 
Of course, this will not be the story if the Badin Bullfrogs have anything to say about it. 
With nearly 170 fewer occu­pants than Lewis, Badin is the smallest girls' dorm on campus and is 7-1 after losing to Lewis in the season opener. 
The dorm only housed an inter­hall team for six years, and this is their first year to make it to the finals. 
"It's been our goal for four years," said senior Erin Zachry, one of Badin's quarterbacks. "Each year. we've improved and gotten closer and our goal has become more feasible. This is a big honor for Badin; we've worked very hard for this."

The Chicks are hoping that the energy from last week's thrilling overtime victory against Welsh Family carries over to the champi­onship game. 
In addition to potent combina­tions on offense, Lewis also boasts a solid defense. 
"We're really confident because of the way our defense has been setting up all year," said Amanda DiOrio, part of Lewis' secondary. "We're so strong and we really think it will be to our advantage in the championship." 
Badin, for their part, will be relying once again on the play­making ability of dual-action quarterbacks Zachry and fellow 
Lewis quarterback Nasrallah gets another shot at title 
senior Steph Heath, as well as the clutch plays of Wind and wide receiver Molly Donnely. 
Zachry credits this season's suc­cess to "a combination of senior leadership and some very talented freshmen and sophomores," as well as to the dedication of fifth­year coach Anthony Pilcher. 
Since the first day of the season, or, as DiOrio said, from the moment they lost last year, both tElams have had their eyes set on the Stadium. 
"At the beginning of the season, we got together as a team and let everyone know this was our goal," Wmd said. "We knew we wanted nothing less than to play every game possible." 
The fact that each team is led by dynamic groups of seniors makes this final game of the season even more intense and emotional. 
"There's so much energy and desire that it really vibrates throughout the team," DiOrio said. 
That desire will probably con­tinue all the way up to the first snap of the ball Sunday. 
"We're all so excited and so pumped," Nasrallah said. "Both teams know how special this opportunity is."

Future will reveal seniors' role 

History will judge what role the 
2003 senior class had in shaping 
Notre Dame football, and that's a 
good thing. 

Because right now, this senior 
class' legacy isn't 
looking too good. 
In the 117-year 
history of Notre . Dame football. 
the Irish have 
never had three 
losing seasons in 
a five-year span. 
And if the Irish 
lose to BYU, 
Stanford or 

Syracuse, the 
fifth-year seniors 
playing their 

final game in 
Notre Dame 
Stadium 

Saturday will have been the only 
class of players to see Notre Dame 
through such an ignominious 
stretch. 

Not exactly something you want to 
put on your resume. 
And that's why fans will have to 
wait until future football seasons to 
determine how much of an impact 
this senior class had on the football 
program. 

One thing for sure -this year's 
senior class has experienced 
nowhere near the success that last 
year's class did as the team's lead­
ers. And that's surprising, consider­
ing that a new head coach bent on 
installing his own style often 
neglects the players who will be 
around for just one season. 
But Tyrone Willingham welcomed 
and embraced last year's seniors, 
and they responded by serving as a 
rallying point for Notre Dame's 
remarkable run. Seven went on to 
get drafted by the NFL, and many of 
those who did are playing key roles 
on their respective teams. 
So what happened to this crop of 
seniors? 


QUOTING THE IRISH

Julius Jones running back 

For one, there aren't many impact players in the lineup -especially on the offense. In fact, aside from Julius Jones, no other senior has had a massive impact on Notre Dame's ability to move the ball­maybe because only three played regularly (wide receiver Omar Jenkins and lineman Jim Molinaro).

The same holds true for this batch of seniors. Notre Dame fans are

Dame for at least four years. 
This season is more or less a throwaway, because even if the Irish win the rest of their games to become bowl-eligible, there's little chance they'll actually get selected for one. 
And that is where the evaluation of this senior class can begin. 
Can vocal leaders like Courtney Watson rally the Irish and keep them focused late in the season? When the Irish stumbled to a losing season two years ago, it was in part because some the younger players -who are now this year's seniors -adopted a "wait 'till next year" mentality. How can this senior class prevent others from making mis­takes? 
Can future NFL talent, like Julius Jones or Darrell Campbell, pass what they have learned to the younger players who will take their place? Notre Dame is such a young team right now -the Irish have played six true freshmen-that the youth need the experience the seniors can provide if Notre Dame is to be successful in the future. 
Can Notre Dame actually have a winning record in November? (The Irish haven't in four of the last five 2001 -all teams 
the graduating class 

of fifth-year seniors were members of. 
But the manner in which the Irish team ends the season will be the true testament of this class' leader­ship ability. Because if Notre Dame sputters its way to another losing season -just like the Irish did last year -it's hard to imagine that Irish football will experience a miraculous rebirth in the offseason. 
On the other hand, if the Irish fin­ish the season on a positive note, Notre Dame will finally have some bounce in its step in the offseason, which could in turn lead to repeti­tion of Willingham's miraculous first year at the helm of Notre Dame football. And by doing so, the seniors will show that their final year, the year Notre Dame stumbled again, was merely an aberration. 
Time will judge those playing their final game in Notre Dame Stadium Saturday. But against BYU, the seniors will begin filling the pages of the history books.

In his career, Watson's gone through just about everything you can imagine. He's struggled through a position change from offense to defense at the early part of his career. He's waited patiently for his time to get into the game behind older athletes. 
"You see the team struggling and you think you can go out there and help," Watson said of his own experiences at the beginning of his career. "But everybody has to wait their turn, and I think you just learn that as you become more mature and understand college football a lit­tle more." 
Over his five years, Watson has also witnessed first hand the extreme highs and lows that can come with winning and losing as Notre Dame. 
He's seen the good times and bad in Irish football ranging from Notre Dame's 8-0 start last year and Fiesta Bowl appear­ance in 2000 to it's current 3-6 season, a 5-6 finish in 2001, a 5­7 season as a freshman in 1999 and an alleged rape scandal that caused three players to leave the University and left a big hole in the team. 


If anything, Watson hopes his knowledge and the things he has learned can be put to good use in the minds of the younger players coming up through the program now. 
"I try to tell the guys that aren't playing that it's for a rea­son, and the coaches know best," he said, of the advice he gives to younger players who are itching to get playing time just as he was as a freshman in 1999. "Maybe you could go out and perform to the same level as the guys out there, but the coaches have those guys out on the field for a reason. They're going to do the best thing for the team and for yourself to get both you and the team developed." 
Even in Notre Dame's current difficult season, Watson still feels a great sense of duty to the University he loves so much. He knows that even in his short remaining time here, he still has

"Right now, you just play for wins. You want to just put this team in a position to have some momentum for next year," he said. "My goal is to get better as an individual, but at the same time, to help our team get better to win the next game that we have, then after that the next three games, and just try to end the season on a good note." 
If there's one thing Watson can be positive about with all the things he's seen in nearly five years at Notre Dame, it's that the great Irish football tradition will not fade away any time soon. 
"I see the program just going up," Watson said. "I see coach [Tyrone] Willingham staying here and getting a good hold on the program and putting his touch to it and getting a lot of players in here. I see the system just taking ofT and getting back to the glory days."

SEAN MILLIGAN 

Convincing mom turned out worthwhile 

ByJUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sporrs Editor 
Despite the fact her son is now a 290-pound lineman for the Irish, Sean Milligan's moth­er was worried about him play­ing football when he was 
younger. 
" I ' v e always want­ed to play football," Milligan said. "All my friends played foot­ball, but my 

morn wasn't Milligan really for it so I had to coax her into it. She was like, 'Your older brother didn't play until he was in high school, and you're not playing until you're in high school.' 
"I kind of talked her letting me start a year before high school, though." 
As a senior at Norcross High School in the Atlanta suburb of Norcross, Milligan shined as a standout offensive lineman. He was named a USA Today sec­ond-team All American offen­sive lineman and rated a top­100 prospect by both ESPN.com and The Sporting News. 
As a high school standout in the football-crazy state of Georgia, Milligan received a lot of looks from the University of Georgia and other SEC schools, as well as Georgia Tech in Atlanta. From the start, though, he knew where he wanted to go. 

"I kind of just went with my gut and my heart," he said. "I thought Notre Dame had the best mix of academics and foot­ball and I wanted to get a nationally-recognized degree." 
Milligan was redshirted as a freshman in 1999 under coach Bob Davie, and only played a few minutes of backup duty as a sophomore. As a junior, Milligan started his first game against Nebraska in 2001. 
The offensive guard continued to switch between a starter and a backup through 2001, but became a full-time starter in 2 0 0 2 , coach Tyrone Willingham's first year. 
Milligan was forced to learn a different blocking scheme from the option-based scheme which Davie used. He also had to deal with the fiasco surrounding the hiring and five days later, resig­nation, of George O'Leary. 
"It was hard, because I came in to play under coach Davie and his staff, and when they left it was kind of like, 'Well, where do I go from here,"' Milligan said. "And then the new coach came in and he was only here for five days, so we all were at home from Christmas break and we're just kind of thinking -who's going to be our coach. 
"It was kind of frustrating not knowing who your coach was going to be, because the school was keeping quiet about it." 
During his first year in Willingham's system, Milligan was a crucial part of an offen­sive line that sent four players to the NFL and helped the Irish to a 10-3 record. Milligan served an additional role this season as the only returning starter on the offensive line, and was asked to provide extra leadership to the young line­men. 
"What I tried to do was just to help them learn the game speed, the game tempo, and what's expected of them," he said. "The coaches expect lead­ership out of the seniors, with the young team we have, we're expected to really set an exam­ple." 
Milligan injured himself in the Michigan game this year, and hasn't played since. putting a damper on his last year. Despite the injury, he still feels confi­dent about his future after Notre Dame. 
''I'm just going to take next semester and try to get things in order. I'd like to go back home to Atlanta, but I'll really go anywhere someone will hire me," he said. 
''I'd like to play professional football, and if that comes, it comes, but I'm not banking my life on it."

PATRICK NALLY 

Helping prepare the starters is just plain fun 

By SCOTT BRODFUEHRER Sports Writer 
For walk-on tight-end Patrick Nally, the oppor­tunity to play Notre Dame football is just plain fun. 
"I'm scrimmaging football most of the time, which is just a blast," Nally said. "To go out there 
and go against some of the best athletes in the world, it's fun to go out and compete." 
As a member of the scout team, Nally helps prepare the defense by simulating the next opponent's offense in practice the week before the game. How he does this -and some­times even the position he 

plays -changes every week. Nally 
"Boston College used a lot of tight ends . . . Florida State hardly used any and Navy doesn't even have a tight end on their team. ... I was a tackle that week," he said. 
And even though his hard work at practice doesn't usually result in playing time, he still has a lot invested in each game. 
"You definitely take pride and definitely look at the defense and see how they do and how they perform and always hope for a shutout or very low points scored on them," he said. 
Nally said he knew he wanted to come to Notre Dame and play football since third grade and always worked toward that goal. And while no members of his family had attended Notre Dame, he was following his father's footsteps, who played football at the University of Tulsa. 
"The first thing was getting into school and 
once I was able to get in to school it was to work 
towards doing the football," he said. 
Nally prepared by adding 25 pounds between the time he arrived on campus and when he tried out for the team in the spring of his freshman year in 2001. After he made the team, he began working towards his next goal -playing during a game. 
That opportunity came during Notre Dame's 42-0 victory over Rutgers last November, when Nally played for just under a minute. 
"It was real exciting and pretty unreal at the time, I couldn't really believe it was happening," he said. "Definitely one of the goals I set out when I joined the team was to get on the field, play at least a play and get my name on the all­time roster." 
Nally would welcome the opportunity to play again, but said wants to see his team win more than anything else. 
"I definitely want to go out on top. I would like to win the games first and foremost," he said. "I'll play hard at practice and play hard at every play, prepare the defense for everything and see what happens. 
"If I have the opportunity to play again, it would be awesome, if not, I just really hope we win." 
An accounting major, Nally has also spent this fall interviewing for jobs, and like many other students, isn't sure where he will end up next year. 
''I'm going back to being a normal guy I guess," he said. "I am going through the interview process and going to get a job, just like a typical, average Notre Dame student." 
But playing on the most storied college football program is an opportunity' few students get and one Nally said he is thankful for. 
"It's a real neat experience, I feel very fortu­nate to have had it and I try to work as hard as I can at it," he said. "I have met some great guys doing this and really have been fortunate with all the people I have met and made friends. It's defi­nitely something I would like to take with me beyond football."

JASON BECKSTROM 

No regrets 
Despite injuries, Beckstrom would not change any of his decisions 
By ANDREW SOUKUP 

Sports Wrirer 
He lunged to make a tackle on a 

kickoff drill in a preseason practice, 
but mostly missed the runner. Instead, 
his arm wrapped around the ball car­
rier for only an instant, before Jason 
Beckstrom felt 
something twinge in 
his arm. 
Just like that, he 

had torn his bicep. 
Just like that, he 
was out for the sea­
son. 
And so Beckstrom, 

who entered 2002 
with such high Beckstrom 
expectations, 
grabbed a permanent spot on the side­
lines for the 2002 season. Yes, the year 
Notre Dame "returned to glory." Yes, 
the year he had his best chance to 
challenge for a starting cornerback 
slot. Yes, the year he hoped would pro­
pel him to an NFL career. 
So why isn't he upset about it? 

Masked as a disguise 
"Sometimes things come in disguis­

es," Beckstrom said a year after his 
injury, "and I really think this has been 
one of those things." 
When Beckstrom stood on the side­

line of a practice field a year ago in 
pain, he had no idea his season was 
over. In fact, he thought his arm mus­
cles had only cramped up. So he pulled 
his helmet back on, stepped back onto 
the practice field and played football 
for t'Wo more days. 
Then the results of the MRI came 

back. "Well, I guess I have to sit that 
one out," Beckstrom remembers think­
ing when he heard the news. He had 
torn the smaller of his bicep muscles, 
which meant he could still move his 
arm but couldn't do anything as physi­
cal as tackle a wide receiver. So he had 
arm surgery and traded his helmet for 
another year of eligibility. 
The thing was, Beckstrom never got visibly angry that he had to sit out the ANDY KENNNThe Observer season. While he admits that it was Irish defensive back Jason Beckstrom heads toward the ball during the Michigan game this season. Beckstrom returned tough watching Notre Dame have suc­

MATT KRUEGER 

Scout team QB finally contributes on Saturdays 
By HEATHER VAN 
HOEGARDEN 
Sports Writer 
Matt Krueger had dreams of being part of a Notre Dame victory, but it was as a quar­terback. But against Navy his goal was realized, as he was the holder 
in the game-win­ning field goal by D.J. Fitzpatrick. 
Krueger, a walk-on and the scout team 

q u a r t e r -Krueger back, won the job as backup holder this year, and when Nicholas Setta went down with a leg injury against Pittsburgh, Krueger was summoned to hold for Fitzpatrick, his former team­mate at Mishawaka's Marian High School. 
The duo from Marian was responsible for two field goals and an extra point in their first appearance of the season. and have been successful since. 
"I knew him all through high school and it's a big trust fac­tor," Fitzpatrick said. "I trust him so much and that makes it so much easier in some ways." 
But their role at Notre Dame has been much different than their careers at Marian, where Krueger was an all-state quar­terback and played safety while Fitzpatrick was an all­state defensive back. 

"This is a smaller job [than playing in the secondary together] but it is so much more important, and it takes a lot more trust," Fitzpatrick said. 
But coming to Notre Dame, Krueger didn't think he would be where he is today. 
"I was pretty cocky coming out of high school, and I fig­ured I would come in here and be playing by my sophomore year," he said. "But as the years went on, I understood what my roles were." 
Krueger has been a crucial part of the Irish behind the scenes, as he has been the scout team quarterback for four years. He has been responsible for learning and practicing opponents' offenses against the first -string de~nse. Krueger has embraced this role. 
"It's one of those things, where every week there is something new, a new chal­lenge, and it's one of those things where you rise to the challenge and help the defense out," Krueger said. "It's a lot of fun." 
For Krueger, it was never a tough choice to come to Notre Dame, even as a walk-on. 
"I always loved Notre Dame growing up, and it just felt right," Krueger said. "It was a great opportunity." 
Krueger followed in the foot­steps of his brother Ryan, who was a walk-on quarterback for the Irish from 1998-2001, and his dad, who was also a Notre Dame graduate. For him, get­ting onto the field and being able to hold for Fitzpatrick has been an invaluable experience. 
"It's great, not only was my first time on the field this year. but to be able to share some­thing like that with D.J., who I played with in high school, is extra special, not only for peo­ple at Marian, but for my coach and my parents," Krueger said. 
But now that the two have been reunited, Krueger's grad­uation will find Fitzpatrick searching for another holder that he can trust as much as his friend from high school. 
"Losing someone you trust like that, it's going to hurt, but it is just time for the next guy to step up and for a new rela­tionship to build," Fitzpatrick said. 
And, through it all, Matt Krueger knows that he made the right choice to come to Notre Dame, after moving to South Bend right before high school. 
"When I take a step back and look at everything, you can't go wrong at Notre Dame -great academics and play­ing for one of the best football programs in the country is just an experience that is just unbelievable," Krueger said.

JULIUS JONES 

Fulfilling expectations 
After a year awayfrom Notre Dame, Jones came back to finish what he started 
Editor's Note: A version of this story originally ran in the Sept. 4, 2003 edi­tion ofThe Observer. 
By ANDREW SOUKUP 
Sports Wrirer 
At Notre Dame's annual football media 
day in August, Ryan Grant sat alone 
patiently waiting for a reporter to 
approach him. After all, wouldn't some­
body want to talk to Notre Dame's first 
1,000-yard rusher in 
five years? 
Under normal cir­
cumstances, Grant's 
table would have been 
surrounded by all 
kinds of media types. 
But on this particu­lar day, Julius Jones had planned to speak publicly for the first Jones time regarding his forced exile from the Irish. So while Grant sat mostly by himself, the crowd around Jones' table stretched three deep. They waited for the player once named to a future NFL all-decade team to explain his academic-related absence. 
And they wanted to hear him explain why he came back. 
To understand why some consider Jones' return the equivalent of the Second Coming, it's easier to show crowd-pleasing clips featuring his elec­trifying kick returns and ankle-breaking moves from his first three years at Notre Dame. 
But to explain who Jones became after he got booted by the Irish, it's easier to explain what he did in his own personal purgatory -away from the Irish, away from the television cameras, away from everyone but his family. 
Making a mistake 
Jones first burst onto the field at Notre Dame Stadium as a freshman in 1999, wowing fans with his explosive speed and devastating quickness. As Notre Dame's primary kick returner for most of the season, Jones tallied 798 return yards for the Irish, the second-highest season total in Notre Dame history. 
He quickly became popular with fans for his big-play potential, which he demonstrated a year later against No. 1 Nebraska when he started his first game at running back and returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown to help send the game into overtime. Just as conduct­ing the band during the 1812 Overture is second nature for Irish fans, so too was lifting their arms, crossing their wrists and raising two fingers raised on each hand to symbolize Jones' uniform num­ber each time he ran onto the field to return a kick. 
But off the field, few things were per­fect for Jones. He missed spring practice one year thanks to a University suspen­sion, and some teammates quietly grum­bled about the star running back's work ethic. His reputation for dodging inter­views with the media was so legendary that one day, a handful of reporters started a pool on whether Jones would show up to speak to them (he didn't). 
By the time Jones had returned to the playing field for his junior year, he had added 20 pounds at the coaches' urging. Sure, he was a bigger back, but he had lost the burst of speed that made him such a dangerous threat in the first place -even though he went on to lead the Irish in rushing that fall with 718 yards. 
Then, the summer before his senior year, disaster struck. 
Jones, a film, television and theater major, met with his parents and acade­mic officials from Notre Dame to discuss something neither party has been willing to talk about. But after the meeting, word had tricklPd out that Jones was going to bf~ suspended for a year. 

TIM KACMAR!The Observer Julius Jones, shown here cutting away from a Boston College defender, returned from a year in exile to break a school record against Pittsburgh by 
rushing for 262 yards in a single game. 
"I was pretty hurt and upset," he said. "But you have to look forward and try to make the best of it." 
The Irish, and their new head coach Tyrone Willingham, weren't fazed. At one point during the sum­mer, when someone asked cheerleaders," he said. He even made several trips to South Bend to visit with his girlfriend and his teammates -and saw a campus feeding off the success of the football team. 
"It just looked so fun

was 'the emotional equiva­lent of a tornado. He flirted with entering the supplemental NFL draft. He tossed around the idea of transferring. 
But in the end, he realized he wanted to go to Notre Dame. 
"I started here, and I want to finish things I started," he said. "I came here for a reason, I came here to graduate and I didn't feel comfortable going some­where else." 
Jones moved to Arizona to live with his brother Thomas, then a running back with the Arizona Cardinals (he has since been traded to Tampa Bay). He enrolled in classes at Arizona State to maintain his college eligibility while thriving in the relative anonymity as just another regu­lar student on the Pac-1 0 campus. 
Meanwhile, back in South Bend, the Irish had charged to an 8-0 start in Jones' absence. Grant was on his way to gaining 1,085 yards as Notre Dame's featured back and Vontez Duff's kick returning abilities had all but made Jrish fans think, "Julius who?" 
But Jones hadn't forgotten the Irish. As much as it hurt, h(' watched every game on television -··1 was one of the biggest 
work ethic necessary to 
succeed in the NFL. He changed to a high protein diet. He rarely touched a football, choosing instead to work out in weight room four times a week. 
And under the guidance of his brother -whom Jones said he considers one of his best friends -Jones traded fat for muscle and laziness for dedication. 
"When I first got the news about not being able to come back to Notre Dame, it really hurt," Jones said. "But as I look at it, it was kind of a chance for me to grow up a little bit, to get hungry and to get ready to come back here and take care of business." 
By the time a chiseled, 210-pound Jones appeared on an ESPN interview in February, saying he wanted to return to Notre Dame, he appeared stronger, more determined and -most of all ­more mature. 
At one point, Jones met with Willingham to find out what he had to do to rejoin the football team. While Jones doesn't want to talk about thP substance of the discussion or what exactly he had to do to return, he aeknowiPdged hP had quite a bit to change. 
"I had to change my attitude," he said. 
"I didn't really have a bad attitude, but 
as far as taking care of things and get­
ting things done, I wasn't really on top of 
that." 
For his part, Willingham -who had 
said all along that Jones would be an 
integral part of the Irish if he came back 
to South Bend -maintained he set no 
criteria for Jones to rejoin the team. 
"He made a mistake," Willingham said. 
"But he was man enough to admit he 
made a mistake and man enough to do · 
what he had to do to correct that mis­
take." 
By June, Jones had cleared most of the 
University's academic requirements for 
re-admission and enrolled in summer 
classes. When summer school wrapped 
up in early August -and Jones had 
passed his classes -he was back on the 
Irish for good. 
"What kept me going?" he said. "My 
brother. My family. I knew I had let them 
down, and I wanted to prove to them I 
could get back here." 
Moving forward 
The Notre Dame team to which Jones 
returned was drastically different than 
the one he left. Instead, Jones noticed a 
disciplined team fanatically bent on suc­
cess. Practices were faster and more 
intense. The offense was completely dif­
ferent. 
But Jones, too, was different. While 
many of the Irish are hesitant to 
describe Jones pre-exile, many now will 
praise his heightened work ethic and 
improved attitude. 
"I think it wasn't that he had a bad 
attitude before," Grant said. "I think 
maybe he didn't approach things .the 
right way in terms of going all out. 
"But that's all behind him, and he moved forward." 
Jones admitted midway through the season that he wasn't as vocal as he could be, in part because he didn't know how the team would accept him or believe he truly had changed. But he started the season with a 72-yard run­ning performance against Washington State, including a go-ahead touchdown in a furious fourth-quarter comeback. He further cemented his spot on the team with a 262-yard performance in a win against Pittsburgh, where he broke the school record for most rushing yards in one game. Two weeks later, he broke Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown's record for most career kick return yards. And against Navy, Jones turned in the sixth-best rushing performance in school history with u. 33-carry, 221-yard outing. 
If Jones is reluctant to speak up with words, he's not afraid to lead with his example. Willingham said he now con­siders Jones one of the team's leaders. 
"I don't know what the past was," run­ning backs coach Buzz Preston said. "All I know is that the young man [came] back here and is doing a good job." 
The soft-spoken Jones now appears happier than before he left, and even happier than he was when the season started. Before Notre Dame's season opener against Washington State, he grinned broadly when describing his anticipation about running out of the tunnel after a year-long hiatus -"I remember it, but it's gonna be sweet when I do it for real. It feels like it's been 10 years since I played." 
"I missed it a lot," he added. "Anytime you have something taken away from you that you love doing, it hurts pretty bad. 
"It's like that sometimes. You learn from your mistakes, and I think I've done that."

Seniors out there probably remember 

"The Miracle Block." 
Think back to freshman year, 2000, the Air Force game. The then-5-2 Irish were trying to make a late season push for a BCS bowl, but were currently tied with the Falcons with only three sec­onds to play. And things looked even worse, as Air Force had a 28-yard field goal attempt to win the game and send the Irish packing to just a minor bowl or worse. 
The kick was a chip-shot. A no-brain­

block the kick and send the game to 
overtime, where the Irish would eventu­
ally win. 
People called it "The $12 million 

Block" in reference to the purse the 
Irish would later receive for participat­
ing in the Fiesta Bowl. People related it 
to the hand of God coming down to stop 
the ball. 
Observer comic artist Tom Keeley 

even portrayed the play in one of the 
next week's issues, showing a mighty 
hand appearing through the clouds to 
flick the ball away form the goal. 
To so many people that kick meant so 

much. 
To Earl. it was just another play. "· 
"It was kind of a thing where it lin­

gered on for about a year. But after a couple weeks, I kind of got tired of [all the attention)." Earl said of his block that people would remember and con­gratulate him on for months to come. 
After all, that one play in no way summarizes Earl's entire career at Notre Dame. The fifth-year senior safe­ty for the Irish has been a two-year starter in the Notre· Dame secondary and a four-time game day captain. But even with all he's accomplished with the Irish -his 172 career tackles, five interceptions and numerous trademark big hits -Earl doesn't mind being remembered for that one spectacular play anymore. 
"But now, I guess it's kind of a good thing to at least be remembered for something," he says with a smile. "A lot of people can't say they've done that. Looking back on my whole career, I guess it's one of the things I'll remem­ber best. If people remember me for that. so be it." 
The playmaker 
Earl's resume does include many more big plays than just that one against the Falcons as a sophomore. Even earlier that season, Earl had a blocked punt against Purdue that set up an Irish touchdown in Notre Dame's 23­21 victory over the Boilermakers. 
Last season, with the Irish only lead­ing Pittsburgh 7-6 midway through the fourth quarter, Earl laid a crunching hit on scrambling Panther quarterback Rod Rutherford that jarred the ball lose. The senior also fell on the ball at the Panther 12-yard line to set up the deci­sive score in Notre Dame's 14-6 win. 
Later in the season against Florida State, Earl was named player of the game for leading the team with 11 tack­les, snaring an interception and causing a fumble with another big hit on Seminole quarterback Chris Rix. 
"The thing is, [Glenn Earl] is a play­maker," Irish defensive backs coach Trent Walters said of his senior safety. "Those are the key things. When you have guys that are big hitters and that can defend the pass and make plays. 



that's what you look for in a defensive back." 
As a starter the last two seasons, Earl has been a key playmaker on a Notre Dame defense known for forcing turnovers and laying big hits on oppo­nents. 
"I guess I like to think of myself as a football player, and I think I have those natural instincts," Earl said. "I play fast, I'm always flying to the ball, and good things just happen if you play the game the right way. I don't think it's any scientific reasoning. If you just play hard, good things can happen for you." The headhunter 
On top of being able to make big plays at key ~imes, Earl has also developed a reputation as one of the hardest hitters in

the running back. 

"I guess people wanted to give me that moniker a year ago, but I don't see myself being any bigger of a hitter than anyone else. It's all a matter of opportu­nity." 
Still, Earl has earned his title and rep­utation as a hitter from such jarring blows as the hit he laid on Michigan running back Chris Perry earlier this season to cause a fumble with the Irish still in striking distance. 
But he doesn't just pick on the little guys either, as Earl is unafraid to lay a pop on anybody that comes his way, such as former Stanford wide receiver Teyo Johnson. In last season's battle with the Cardinal, Earl laid out the 6­foot-7 sophomore in a hit that helped turn the 
Vikings before coming to Notre Dame. "He's a head hunter, and he's really quick and fast, and he just loves to hit." 
While many in college football -from reporters, to his teammates, to his own coaches -have referred to Earl as the team's headhunter and big hitter in the defensive backfield, the senior is a little hesitant to accept the title. 
"I don't think [I'm a head hunter]." he said. "If you look at our team, anyone is a headhunter and a big hitter. It's just a matter of time and place and opportuni­ty. You look at last week, I saw [Irish safety] Garron Bible get a good hit on 
be 180 pounds. I'm 
coming to give you all that I have. I may hit you high, I may hit you low or I may hit you in the mid­dle, but I know that I'm definitely going to look to make the play." 
Even if Earl does not want to be thought of as only a big hitter, it's obvi­ous that the 6-foot-1, 205-pound safety understands the importance of being able to lay on a big hit from time to time in a game. 
"That's part of the game. People may say a tackle is a tackle as long as you get the guy on the ground, but over the course of a game, receivers and run­
ning backs, they take a beating and it 
adds up after a while," Earl said. "If a 
running back or receiver gets hit really 
hard a couple of times, they begin to 
wear down, and they become aware of 
where the hitters are on the field. Then 
you get receivers having alligator arms 
across the middle, and you get running 
backs getting slow in the hole, looking 
for the hitters instead of just running. It 
basically changes the complexion of 
their offense." 
As a guy who has seen that fear in the 
eyes of opposing running backs and 
wide receivers first hand, Earl knows 
the impact that the ability to lay a big 
hit on an opponent can have. 
"In my opinion, hitting is a big part," 
he said. "I mean, there's times when 
you need to make the sure tackle, but 
there's also times where you need to lay 
the hit. If the defense doesn't hit, 
they're not going to get the offense out 
of sync and the offensive players out of 
their game." 
The Injury 
Now near the end of the 2003 season 
-Earl's final year with the team ­
things have kind of taken a sour turn 
for the senior, and it has little to do 
with Notre Dame's current 3-6 record. 
The big hitter Earl was hampered by a knee injury in the USC game that seemed minor at the time, but has turned out to be a season-ending injury following the surgery Earl had at the beginning of last week to repair the damage. 
"That's probably the most curious part about it, that I didn't feel the pain that I guess I was supposed to feel," said Earl of his knee injur)!. ;'It wasn't like all of a sudden I'm hurt and I'm down. After I got injured, it didn't really feel like anything different throughout the course of the game. It juts felt like a little nick, a little bruise that you get through the course of battle." 
But the injury turned out to be more severe, and now Earl will have to watch from the sidelines Saturday against BYU on Senior Day. The day that should have been the culmination of a fine career with the Irish, instead may take on a bittersweet tone, as Earl will not be able to play in his last game at Notre Dame Stadium. 
"Right now, just thinking about it, I know that chances are when I come out of the tunnel onto the field for the open­ing kickoff, I'm going to look up at the stands at the student section," Earl said. "It's all the things you don't really notice when you're playing. I try not to think about it, because I don't want to psych myself out and be a wreck. But I guess it's just the reality of the situa­tion, it's tough that it will be my last game -my last time on the field as a player." 
But Earl's career and duties with the Irish are, by no means, finished. The fifth-year senior can still help from the sidelines during practice, review film with his fellow defensive backs and lend whatever support and experience he can to the team over its final three games. 
"The first thing is we want Glenn to spend the majority of his time recover­ing and going through rehab and doing the things he needs to do there," Irish head coach Tyrone Willingham said. "But when he does have the opportunity to be around, his experience can be passed on to the other players. Because there are so many things that he recog­nizes that some of the players that don't have that experience will struggle with. 
''Hopefully he can impart some of his wisdom, some of his experience, and some of his confidence onto our guys that are picking up his slack."

VONTEZ DUFF 

~­
' 
Editors note: This article orig­inally ran in the Oct. 10, 2003 edition ofThe Observer. 
By CHRIS FEDERICO 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame cornerback Vontez Duff is like a human can­vas. 
In all, he has seven tattoos. But none are more impmiant ­or more visi-
,..,.,....,...,.,.,.= ble -than the two he wears across his throat. On the left side is "Wynoka," the name of Duff's mother and the woman who Duff raised four children virtually by herself. On the right side is "Warren," the name of Duff's father, who passed away when Vontez was only two years old. 
"I got my Dad in memory of him passing away," Duff says of his most noticeable tattoos. "But I had to get my mom as well, because she'd have been mad if I got him and not her." 
He says it with a laugh, but the tattoos serve as both a trib­ute and a reminder. They pay respect to the father he barely had the chance to know and the mother who helped mold him into the person he is today. 
But they also serve as a reminder of the important things in his life and the obsta­cles he's had to overcome. 
Rottweller 
On Duff's lower right arm is a tattoo of a rottweiler dog. He calls it his "young and stupid" tattoo -the first one he got and the characterization of an eager young man trying to break out onto the big scene. 
But there was really very little "young and stupid" about Duff at the time. As the oldest of four children, Duff often served as surrogate dad to his two broth­ers and one sister while their mother worked. While others may have taken the circum­stances as the freedom to find trouble, Duff was busy making sure his siblings stayed out of trouble and on the right path. 
"Being the oldest child of two brothers and a sister and with my mom working, I was always the big brother in the house," he said. "I spent most of the time just watching after them, mak­ing sure they were on top of everything and not getting in trouble." 
But Duff doesn't like to harp on what could have been or how things could have been better. He is thankful for the opportuni­ties and the abilities he did have. 
"It's like that sometimes, and everybody has their story," Duff said. "You just try to make a positive out of every negative and be glad for the opportuni­tie's that you have ahead of you." 
Excelling on the field 
Those opportunities were many for the Duff, a three-sport star at Copperas Cove High School in Copperas Cove, Texas. In fact, in his younger days, Duff first saw himself as a basketball standout. 

Never forgetting 
Seven tattoos on Duff's body portray his roots 
"Growing up, I thought I was 
going to be a basketball player," 
Duff said "I thought I was going 
to be like 6-foot-9 and the next 
Michael Jordan. But then it 
came to a point where I was 
playing football well, and I knew 
that's what I had to be. So I was 
going to try to be the greatest 
football player that ever 
played." 

But off the field and court, 
Duff's real love came on the 
track, where he was a top-class 
long jumper and sprinter. In 
high school, Duff recorded a 
10.5-second 100-meter dash 
time and a long jump of 23 feet. 
The events really gave Duff a 
chance to show off his superb 
athletic ability. 

"Track -I loved running track," Duff remembers. "It was just fun being out there with all the fellas, running up and down the track and long-jumping. I had a pretty good jumping career and our 4 x 100 [meter] team was pretty good -we went to state. But that was all fun and games to me, although I knew in the back of my head that it helped me with my speed." 
In the long jump, Duff was a major rival of Texas star wide receiver Roy Williams. The two squared off head to head in the event in many important meets.· 
"We competed in the long jump a few times in state and regionals," Duff said. "We both were jumping like 24 feet and everybody else was behind us. We were really the only guys that were competing for first place. He ended up beating me in state, but I beat him at regionals before." 
From a runner to a hitter ing time filling in for cornerback so you have to accept that role."

"Most definitely, it's my job to bring that attitude to the field this year," Duff said. "But it can be kind of different when guys don't have as much experience, and they:re still learning the position a little bit. It's harder for them to get out there and run all over the place and yell and be excited, because they're still trying to learn what their role is and what their position is." 
Three more tattoos 
Back home, in Copperas Cove, Texas, there are three pairs of eyes on big brother Vontez. 
They probably watch him every football Saturday as he bats down a pass or returns a kickoff 100 yards for a touch­down. But they also watch him all the time, day-in and day-out, just as he watched them so many days when their mother was working to support them. 
Even though they may not like to admit it, Duff knows they look up to their big brother. 
"They try not to show it ­especially my brothers, they don't want to show it. But when you go home, they love seeing you," he says. "They want to wear your Notre Dame gear and your shoes and everything else you own, and they want to be just like you. You know they try to hide it on the outside, but you know its there." 
Maybe those three have a tat­too to get too, someday. How about the same one Duff has on his stomach-"Vontez."

life that he Bemenderfer will have to relinquish fairly soon as the sea­son nears it close. Bemenderfer, a senior walk-on strong safety who has not seen action in a game with the Irish, has no regrets of his past four years with the Notre Dame foot­ball program. As a 170-pound nose guard at Penn High School in Mishawaka, Bemenderfer was courted by a number of smaller Division I A, 1­AA and II schools, most of which recruited him as a linebacker. Bemenderfer, who was gifted with speed, had a strong athletic resume in high school, particular­ly because Penn's rugby team was twice nationally ranked -sev­enth in 1998 and 11th in 1999. "My second love is rugby," he said. "It is an equivalent [to foot­ball). It just doesn't have all the

glory footbaU has." 

Bemenderfer, who first begin playing football in the seventh grade when all 120 boys in his class tried out for the just-starting team, visited many schools, including Valparaiso, but even the opportunity to see more playing time was not enough for him to commit the next four years of his life to a school. 
"(VIsiting schools) was fun to do and all," Bemenderfer said. "But I didn't like some of the coaching staffs, and some of the stadiums were smaller than my high school stadium. It didn't appeal to me." 
So he decided to go for his top academic choice. Notre Dame. 
"l figured if l can't go for it all. l am going to go for my academ­ics," he said. 
"I tried to get the most out of my summer being free," Bemenderfer said. "When I got here, I said, why not give it a run, and so I walked on the fall of my freshman year." 
At Notre Dame, Bemenderfer has had a full schedule. adding two majors, management infor­mation systems and sociology, to the rigors of Irish football. 
At times, football has made it hard for him to maintain desir­able grades. 
For his 18th birthday, Bemenderfer was giving flying lessons, with the requirement that he keep his GPA above 3.0. After he tore his ACL freshman year, his grades also suffered some injury, particularly because "being on all the painkillers was really tough." 
Since then he has brought his GPA much above 3.0, but he has not had the time to add to the nine hours he had previously logged towards his pilot certification. 
"It is definitely something I have to go back to," Bemenderfer, the son of two Notre Dame alumni said. "My grandfather was a pilot. My dad was a pilot. It is some­thing I really enjoy doing, getting up there, and just, you're free. You are not controlled by any­thing." 
Perhaps Bemenderfer appreci­ates that freedom given his strin­gent schedule down on land, but he nevertheless registers no com­plaints about that. 
"Some days you don't think you'll ever be done, and some days you just don't want it to end," he said. ''Now, getting towards my end, and looking back on it all, every minute was worth it." 
Bemenderfer, who undoubtedly has had an array of experiences, has goals of obtaining a technical consulting job and of completely rebuilding his 1972 war-bonnet­yellow Corvette. For now, though, the focus is on finishing school, and more immediately, his last games as an Irish football player. 
"When [football) is over, it'll be an end of a part of my life," he said. "I have no regrets. I tried everything I wanted to try. It'll be just another chapter in my life that I won't regret doing."

our football team as much as he 
could. 
"I know he was anxious to get in there and show what he was capable of." 
Meanwhile, Molinaro felt the significant playing time he saw in those last two regular season games prepared him adequately for the Gator Bowl. 
"It wasn't that difficult, I already had two starts under my belt and I had been playing basi-. cally the whole year," Molinaro said. "So it really wasn't too big of a deal by then." 
Leader by default 
Four seniors left the Notre Dame offensive line when they were selected in the 2002 NFL Draft. 
Therefore Molinaro was one of only two returning offensive linemen, along with Sean Milligan, on a unit being heavily questioned by a number of peo­ple heading into the 2003 sea­son. 
Molinaro's leadership, despite starting only three games com­ing into this year, has fulfilled Denbrock's expectations. 
"He's been tremendous," Denbrock said. "He's really taken those young kids and tried along with us, how to do things the right way, how to practice the right way, how to prepare themselves for a game the right way, he's been invaluable to me trying to get those younger guys ready." 

The need for Molinaro to be a leader on the line increased even more when an injury to Milligan has left him on the sidelines since the Michigan State game. That lack of experience along the line has forced the other four young linemen to look to Molinaro, who has handled all of the responsibilities in stride. 
He helps the younger guys in the film room and at practice explaining plays and working on perfecting technique. The evi­dence of his leadership is not only on the offensive line, but also on the team, as Molinaro has been named a game captain six times in 2003. 
But his first duty of leadership is the offensive line. 
"Jim is the leader of the offen­sive line, there's no dispute over that. When he talks everybody listens," offensive tackle Ryan Harris said. "He's been real helpful in helping me come along especially when I began playing. He was really helpful in terms of helping me see the game and what's going to hap­pen." 
Counting this season, Molinaro has started only 12 games on the offensive line in his four years of playing with the Irish. That lim­ited time on the field has left Denbrock with a feeling Molinaro has a lot of room to grow and improve, just because he hasn't played on offense that much. 
"I really think he's a guy that when you look at home, his best football is ahead of him still," Denbrock said. "He's just going to continue, in my opinion, to get better and better and better as time goes on." 
Spending five years at Notre Dame has seen Molinaro and the Irish reach emotional highs and lows. Prior to this year, Molinaro had two losing seasons and sea­sons of 10 and nine wins. Couple those four years with the disap­pointing 3-6 record in the first nine games of his senior year, Molinaro can only describe his college career in one way. 
"It's been interesting," he said. "It's been a roller coaster."

Jason Sapp 
The cousin of NFL star Warren Sapp, Jason Sapp has not seen a lot of playing time in his first three sea­sons with the Irish. 
Sapp suffered a major knee injury during his freshman year at Notre Dame and really hasn't been the same player. Coming· out of high school, Sapp was an honorable men­tion on USA Today prep All­American team. 
Sapp has only appeared in three games for the Irish this year. Stuck behind the very deep Notre dame defensive line, breaking into the rotation is very difficult. 
With one year of eligibility remain­ing, Sapp could return next year and possibly get onto the field. 
Jerome Collins 

With the starters firmly entrenched at the linebacker position, Jerome Collins is the top backup for the Irish. 
He saw significant playing time in Notre Dame's loss at Boston College when the defense switched from its traditional sue of three linebackers to using four linebackers in trying to stop the Eagles' running game. 
Collins came to Notre Dame as a wide receiver but moved to linebacker upon arriving in South Bend. The graduation of Courtney Watson leaves an opening at the linebacker position, but the uncertain status of Mike Goolsby doesn't ensure Collins a start­ing spot. This spring will bring anoth­er heated battle for a starting posi­tion. 
Billy Palmer 
In the deep tight end position, Billy Palmer has mainly been used as a blocking tight end for the Irish. 
Palmer only has one catch on the season for 13 yards, matching his total from 2002. 
The loss of Gary Godsey to injury and the transfer of Greg Olsen allowed Palmer to have more play­ing time. 
Palmer came to the Irish from Lake Highland Prep in Orland, Fla. and played mainly at defensive end through high school. 
As the younger tight ends contin­ue to develop and the uncertainty surrounding Godsey continues, Palmer's role in 2004 remains undetermined. 
Ronnie Rodamer 
The 1999 Gatorade Player of the Year in West Virginia, Ronnie Rodamer really never fulfilled the expectations he brought to Notre dame. 
At 6-foot-4 and 211 pounds, Rodamer only has three career receptions in his three years of playing with the Irish. 
The coaching staff expected big things from Rodamer after he made significant strides during spring practice. 
The loss of only Omar Jenkins to graduation leaves Notre Dame very deep at the wide receiver posi­tions. Rodamer would really have to show something in practice to break into the rotation in 2004. 
DEREK CURRY 


BUG DAVISSON/The Observer Derek Curry celebrates a play where he tackled a Navy defender for a loss. A two­year starter, Curry has one more year of eli­gibility remaining. 

When he was replaced as the starting quar­terback, Carlyle Holiday didn't complain abut the demotion but he worked to find other ways to contribute on the field. 
Holiday lost his starting job after the Michigan State game to freshman Brady Quinn after being inconsistent through Notre Dame's first three games. Holiday completed 
49.3 percent of his passes for 303 yards, but only threw one touchdown. 
In a somewhat ironic situation, Holiday lost his job to a freshman after Holiday claimed the starting position as a freshman two sea­sons ago. 
Holiday tried to make the switch from the option-style quarterback Notre Dame recruit­ed him as to a passing quarterback in Tyrone Willingham's offense. 
During his first year as a starter in 2002, Holiday led the Irish to nine wins by throwing for 1,788 yards and 10 touchdowns. 
Notre Dame fans started calling for a quar­terback change this season when Holiday 
He's the other "D.C." on the Notre Dame defense. 
As part of a linebacker corps featuring all the return­ing starters, minus an injured Mike Goolsby, Derek Curry has continued to improve and has emerged as a vocal leader for the Irish. 
Curry was one of the last players heading into the Notre Dame locker room before its season-opening win against Washington State, shouting into the locker room, "don't ever give up." He is always one of the loudest players on the Notre Dame defense. 
A starter for the past two seasons, Curry has made the most of his move from the inside to the outside before his junior season. 
After making only 34 tack­les in 2002, Curry is currently fourth on the team this season with 50 tackles. He also has four tackles for a loss and three sacks, good for second on the team. 
Curry came to the Irish from the football-rich state of Texas and was rated as one of the top 100 players in the state by the Fort Worth Star­Houson Chronicle. When Rocky Boiman graduated after the 2001 season, Curry battled Jerome Collins for the starting spot -a spot Curry won thanks to a strong per­formance in the spring. 
appeared to regress in offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick's pro-style offense. The fact Notre dame lost two of its first three games didn't help Holiday in saving his starting job. 
Now the backup quarterback, the coaching staff wanted to use Holiday in other fashions to take advantage of his natural athletic abili­ty. By knowing the passing plays already, the coaches used Holiday as the fourth receiver in a number of formations. So far this season, Holiday has only caught one pass for 10 yards. But last weekend against Navy, the coaches sent Holiday into the game as wide receiver. However, this time the play. call was for Holiday to become a running back as he took a reverse around the right end for 16 yards. 
What the future holds for Holiday remains a little up in the air as Quinn appears to be the coaches' choice for the quarterback of the future. Holiday seems relegated to the backup job while working into the offense at other positions.

KYLE BUDINSCAK 
A promising season in his second as a starter at defensive end came to a screeching halt for Kyle Budinscak. 
A solid and consistent force on the defen­sive line, Budinscak injured his right leg against Florida State. As he went back to the locker room, Budinscak hobbled slowly on crutches. 
Notre Dame coach Tyrone Willingham knew the loss of Budinscak would leave the Irish with a major hole to fill on the defensive front. In the week leading up to the Navy game, Willingham talked about how the loss of Budinscak would be difficult to replace in only one week against the disciplined Midshipmen option attack. 
Budinscak has stayed firmly entrenched as a starter on the line since the beginning of his junior season. In 2002, Budinscak regis­tered 20 tackles {13 solo) and three sacks. Through eight games in 2003, Budinscak had 10 solo tackles and three sacks. 
Budinscak played in 11 games as· sopho­more after being redshirted as a freshman. He started two of those games in 2002 and recorded 13 tackles. 

When he came to Notre Dame, Budinscak was able to learn behind future NFL players Grant Irons and second-round draft pick Anthony Weaver. 
While Budinscak has progressed steadily on the football filed, he has been equally impres­sive as a student. He is a two-time Academic All-District award winner and came into this season as an Academic All-American candi­date. In his first three year at Notre Dame, Budinscak compiled a 3. 7 grade point aver­age. Willingham said that Budinscak was more than likely out for the rest of the season earlier this week, and his injury appeared fairly serious. 
Whether he can recover quickly from this injury in time for next season will have to be seen throughout the off-season and spring practice. If his knee injury is serious, his rehabilitation could roll into next season. 

Mike Goolsby 
Filling in for an injured Courtney Watson at the beginning of the 2002, Mike Goolsby played his way into the starting lineup with impressive performances in those first two games. 
But Goolsby injured his shoulder in the Gator Bowl and then re-injured it playing Bookstore Basketball in · the spring. While he finally has restarted practicing, it's unlikely he'll crack the playing field this year. 
Since Goolsby hasn't seen the actual game filed this season, he does participate with the scout team in practice, and he'll most likely take a medical redshirt in 2003 to preserve his fourth year of eligibility. 
Goolsby came to Notre Dame as a top recruit after being a member of USA Today's second-team prep All-American team. He earned a monogram his fresh­man year -one of three freshmen to do so -after playing mostly on special teams. An self-described old school linebacker. Goolsby will make an immediate impact if he returns next season. 

Gary Godsey 
He was almost all the way back. Then, he got sent all the way back. 
After suffering a knee injury in the Gator Bowl, Gary Godsey worked through the off-season to get back to the starting tight end position. But Godsey suffered a major knee injury in August during the summer prac­tice and was lost for the season. What the future holds for Godsey is still up in the air. He has already been redshirted and already used his four years of eligibili­ty. Godsey could apply to the NCAA for a special exemption and get a sixth year of eligibility, but those petitions don't have a high success rate. Godsey carne to the Irish as a quarterback and played in two games in 200 when Arnaz Battle was injured in the second game of the season. Godsey led the Irish to a win over Purdue before he lost 1o Michigan State, got benched, and switched to tight end. 
Whether Godsey comes back to the Irish in 2004 remains to be seen. 
Preston Jackson 
A member of the Notre Dame defensive passing packages, Preston Jackson has been a member of the Irish secondary for the past two seasons. 
Jackson has been part of the Notre dame nickel and dime packages of the past two sea­sons. As a junior, Jackson recorded 26 total tackles and got his first interception against Pittsburgh. 
This season, Jackson has 22 tackles and one interception, coming against Florida State, through Notre Dame's first nine games. 
Jackson has made over 100 special teams appearances the past two seasons. The gradu­ation of Vontez Duff and Jason Beckstrom leaves Jackson as one of the most experienced cornerbacks returning to the Irish in 2004. He will have the chance in the off-season to claim one of the starting jobs. 
GARRON BIBLE 


The former high school run­
ning back from the state of 
Texas has had an up-and-down 
season. 

Upon the graduation of 
Gerome Sapp, the coaches · looked to Garron Bible to ftll in at the other starting safety spot. Bible looked to have that job secured in fall camp but suf­fered an injury that caused the 
c()aches to make other plans. 
The coaches then brought 
Quentin Burrell into the starting 
lineup in preparation that Bible 
wouldn't be ready for the sea­
son opener. However, then 
Burrell was injured and the 
coaches put Bible back into the 
starting lineup. Bible started 
the first three games of the sea­
son but lost his starting job for 
the Purdue game. But an injury 
to Glenn Earl in the USC game 
put Bible back into the starting 
lineup. 

Against Navy's option attack, 
the defense needed Bible to 
stop up and pay a disciplined 
game. He responded with a 
number of big plays in contain­
ing the Midshipmen's running 
game. Bible came to Notre 
Dame after rushing for 1 ,516 
yards and 18 touchdowns in his 
senior year of high school. He 
was moved to defensive back 
after his freshman year. With 
Earl graduating, Bible will once 
again have another opportunity 
to solidify himself in the starting 
lineup if he can stay healthy. 
GREG PAULY 
Last season, Greg Pauly was a vital member of Notre Dame's defensive tackle rotation. This year, he's trying to crack the play­ing field. 
It's not all Pauly's fault, however. He's playing behind Darrell Campbell and Cedric Hilliard, seniors who have to be carried off the field before they admit they're hurt. And the player immediately ahead of him in the rotation, Derek Landri, was considered by many to be the top defensive recruit in the nation when he committed two years ago. 
Still, Pauly, who earned his first monogram as a member of the 2002 Irish, recorded 11 tackles in just under 100 minutes of playing time last season. He also started three games while Hilliard recov­ered from an injury. 
Some think that a knee injury has kept Pauly from emerging as the truly dominant player some thought he would be. His freshman year, Pauly was sidelined with pre­season knee surgery 'lfter he suf­fered an injury during a summer all-star game. 
He was a Parade high school All­American pick and named to top high school list after high school list as one of the nation's best play­ers. 
But while Pauly's knee injury may have kept him from becoming a true big impact player, he may have a chance to see regular play­ing time when Campbell and Hilliard graduate after this year.
