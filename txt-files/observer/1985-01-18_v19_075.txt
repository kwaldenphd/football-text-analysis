Yale students want more sex, according to a 
non-scientific survey there. Seventy-four percent would like more sex in their lives, although 81 percent already consider themselves "somewhat" to "very" sexually active. The survey was conducted by the Alliance for Sexual Progress, a student group promoting more open discussion ofhuman sexuality. At Duke University, meanwhile, a study by the Peer Information Service for Counseling and Educa­tion in Sexuality found students think there is more sexual activity on campus than there really is. While a majority ofstudents thought 60 percent to 80 percent of Duke males had engaged in intercourse, only 31 percent ofthe men surveyed said they had actually had inter­course. The survey will be used to develop counseling and informa­tion programs. · The Observer

Researchers have identified the 9,ooo-pius 
"dots and dashes" of the genetic code that governs activities of the suspected AIDS virus, a step that could help in diagnosis, prevention and maybe treatment of the deadly disease, scientists said yesterday in New York. "You never know the full ramifications" of mapping out the chemical sequence ofa virus's genes, said Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., where one team of researchers is based. Another team of researchers is at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and still another at the Chiron Corp. in Emeryville, Calif. Each research group got its AIDS virus from a different source, and "it will be very interesting to have all these (genetic identifica­tions) published so that finally, one can know whether everyone has the same virus or a different virus, or If they are different, what the nature of their differences is," said l..acy Overby, Chiron vice presi­dent. -AP

StaffReporter 
A 17-year-old St. Joseph County 
youth described by authorities as 
"very quiet," was charged Wednes­
day,Jan. 9, with the ax murder ofhis 
parents on New Year's Day. Police 
said the son had "contemplated the 
killings for three weeks to a month." 
The suspect, Dale Whipple, of Lydick, Ind., has been formally charged with two counts of murder in the death of his parents. Arraign­ment continued yesterday for the second day. No bail has been set for Whipple because bail is not given to murder suspects in Indiana. 
Police reported the investigation began Jan. 2 after Whipple and his 13-year-old sister were stopped by police in South Bend for driving their car in an erratic manner. 
When approached, Whipple said he and his sister were driving to a police station to report the murder oftheir parents, police said. 
However, court documents say Whipple later admitted to inves­tigators that he lured his mother into the garage and struck her with an ax, then attacked his father he slept. 
He also told police he threw the ax he used i~the killings into nearby 
Bass Lake, where divers recovered it 
several days later, according to 
court documents. 

William Richardson of the St. Joseph County Sheriff Department said earlier the children apparently left home without their parent's permission during the early evening New Year's Day, but he refused to elaborate. 
Richardson also has confirmed published reports that the motive for the murder may have been the objections of Whipple's parents to his relationship with a woman nearly twice his age. However, aut­horities have declined to release any specific details. 
The accused youth's sister was held in a juvenile detention home but has since been released. She has not been charged with any crime. "There has not been enough evidence to make any charges, but an investigation is continuing," said a spokesperson for the St. Joseph's County Prosecutor's office. 
Whipple, represented by attorney Charles Asher, will appear before Su­perior Court Judge Robert Miller Jr. on May 13. 
A murder charge in Indiana carries a maximum penalty of 60 years in prison upon conviction.

Former 1'aiwanese official held in scandal 
Associated Press 
TAIPEI, Taiwan -'The former head of Taiwan's Military Intelli­gence Bureau has been taken into custody for questioning in a scandal linking agency officer!i with the slaying ofa journalist in California, a government official said yesterday. 
Vice Adm. Wong Shi-lin, 57, direc­tor of the bureau since 1983, was dismissed without explanation by the government on Tue!iday, after it was announced that one of his deputies had been arrested for al­leged involvement in dte death of American political writer Henry liu, 52. 

STARTS JANUARY 18th AT A THEATRE NEAR YC,U. 
Authorities said the deputy, Col. Chen Hu-men, 47, was implicated in the slaying by two Taiwanese gangsters wanted by San Francisco police in connection with the death. The two are in custody in Taiwan. 
liu, who had written articles criti­cal of the Nationalist Chinese gov­ernment in Taiwan, was gunned down Oct. I 5 by two assailants in the garage of his home in Daly City, Calif. 
He had worked in Taiwan before emigrating to the United States in the 1970s and was reported to have finished revising a critical biography of Taiwan President Chiang Ching­kuo shortly before his death. He worked for the Chinese-language San Francisco Journal. 
The government official, who spoke on condition he not be identi­fied, said Wong had been taken into military custody but he declined to say where he was being held. 
Officials of the Foreign and Defense Ministries held an emer­gency meeting to discuss the devel­oping scandal, which has led to concern that the alleged involve­ment of Taiwan officials in a slaying in the United States might damage U.S.-Taiwan relations. No statement was issued about the meeting. 

Chiang, reportedly furious over ., 
,
the alleged involvement of military intelligence officials in the slaying, on Wednesday ordered a special committee to "spare no effort to find out the truth and punish those re­sponsible, no matter what their rank," according to government sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity._ 
The two gangsters said to have im­plicated the military intelligence of­ficials in liu's death were arrested in November in an anti-crime sweep in Taiwan. 
San Francisco prosecutors have issued warrants charging one of them, Chen Chi-li, 39, with his death. Wu Tung is still being inves­tigated in connection with the slaying. 
Taiwan has no extradition treaty with the United States, and govern­ment sources have declined to say whether Chen and Wu would be taken to the United States to face trial.

Unconscious cues cited as answer to mystery of mathematical canine 
Assoclated Press 
KNIGHTSTOWN, Ind. -The mys­tery of Sheba, Knightstown's math­whiz dog, is solved. 
Richard and Frances Morgan's bright little Spitz-Keeshond has amazed people with an apparent ability to bark out the answers to math problems. 
About two years ago, Mrs. Morgan said, Sheba was bouncing around the kitchen begging for a cracker. 
"I told her, 'I'm going to teach you to count for your crackers,"' Mrs. Morgan said. That afternoon, Sheba learned to bark once when Mrs. Morgan said "one" and held up one finger, twice for two and three times for three. 
It wasn't long before Sheba was counting higher, barking up to 10 and beyond. 
On an impulse, Mrs. Morgan asked Sheba to add two and three. Sheba barked five times and fixed Mrs. Morgan with an expectant gaze. Mrs. Morgan gave Sheba more addition problems. Each time, the little brown dog barked out the correct answer.

~  future we plan to carry the college­

gives us the go-ahead."  
~  

The Morgans found Sheba could do subtraction, multiplication and division. They asked her to solve square roots and cube roots. Sheba rose to each challenge, always eager to please and always with the cor­rect answer. They even taught her to bark out the numbers one through I 0 in response to flash cards. 
A mathematical dog is hard to keep quiet in a town of 2,325 and Sheba soon became a celebrity. Stories about her ran in area news­papers and an Indianapolis televi­sion station did a short piece on her. She was also invited to perform at area schools. 
The Morgans definitely are not the razzle-dazzle showbiz type. Richard is retired from the Air Force and is in charge of transportation for the Knightstown schools. 
When a reporter from The In­dianapolis News visited the Mor­gans, Sheba was working on the alphabet, barking once for the letter A, twice for B, and so on, responding either to flash cards or voice com­mands. 
She impressed the reporter by sol­ving chain calculations like "two times I 5 divided by three minus five." 
The reporter was sure nobody was consciously tipping Sheba, but he was unwilling to say a dog really understood math. 
Enter Erich Klinghammer, associ­ate professor of psychology at Purdue University and director of WolfPark, a facility at Battle Ground dedicated to the study ofwolves. 
Sheba, Klinghammer said, reads body language cues -tiny move­ments of the eyes or head or body ­to know when to stop barking. 
The cuesare given unconsciously, he said, and questioners don't knqw they signal Sheba when she reaches the right number ofbarks.

whose government over several years has been openly hostile to us (and) which until recently sought to hide the magnitude of this disaster from its own people," Crocker said. 
As a result, he said, "We are not in the best place to bring pressure to bear." He said the United States and other contributing nations will likely ask the United Nations to depoliticize the food deliveries. 
Crocker said the United States would not use the threat of ceasing emergency shipments to force the Ethiopian government to distribute the food more evenly, because that would cause even more starvation. 
McPherson said while most of the public attention has focused on Et­hiopia, Sudan and Kenya have added to the "danger list" ofcountries also threatened with mass starvation. 
As a result, he announced that aid to Sudan has been doubled from I00,000 to 200,000 metric tons of 
U.S. food aid. 
McPherson said civil strife in Mozambique also is inhibiting deliveries of emergency assistance to poor people in that country. 
Besides saving money, students liked the convenience the Student Saver Store afforded them. 
"It's a good option for students without cars," said Pangilinan. "Even for those with cars, it's more of a convenience." 
Students didn't seem to mind the lack of brand named items offered by the store. 
"With school supplies, you don't need brand names," said Maggie Citarella. 
Commenting on the notebook he bought at the Student Saver, Gar­diner said, "It doesn't say Notre Dame on it, but it serves the same purpose." 
Maggie Citarella summed up the feelings of many students who came into the Notre Dame Student Saver Store on its opening day. 
"I think the (student store) is a good idea. The bookstore rips you off," Citarella said, adding, "(The bookstore) charges too much."

A love to grow on 
Rev. Robert 

Griffin 
Letters to a Lonely God 
M
any years ago when I was the 
rector of Keenan, a Saint 
Mary's freshman by the name of 
Beth got a crush on me. Don't ask 
me to explain it. She probably 
thought I was kind, and she needed 
kindness. At the beginning, she 
came to the open door of the rec­
tor's room to take a quick look 
inside. She acted like a mouse 
checking the pantry to see if the 
coast is clear, and I couldn't help 
noticing her. She was painfully shy, 
like Bambi, freezing with fear when 
I looked up. Frightened at being 
sighted, she was back again, like a 
game animal in search of the 
hunter. 
I got in the habit of watching for her, to invite her to come in and get acquainted. For a while, I wasn't quick enough. One day I called: "I've been wanting to meet you." She stopped, and let herself be captured. When I asked for her name, I could see she had tears in her eyes. 
She came every afternoon and evening for rapid visits, bringing another Saint Mary's girl to do the talking. Later, she got brave enough to come by herself: for five minutes, for I c; minutes, for an hour, from after supper until her curfew, ifI let her. Ifother students were there, she stayed on the sidelines. Ifwe were alone she left the conversa­tion to me. I could still find hints of tears on her face. 
Keenanites would ask: "Why you, and not us?' 
"The waif who came in from the cold? She's part ofthe package deal that comes with being rector." She was certainly no waifand was as pretty as you hope your mother was as a girl. Keenanites, finding her strange for being attached to the rector, left her alone. They made 

jokes about my having a girlfriend. I 
wouldn't let them know I could see 
she had a crush. 
''I'm giving her lessons on be­

coming a nun," I said. "The or­
phanage appointed me to be her 
honorary uncle." 
I got tired ofentertaining this 

lovely, devoted child. IfI was very 
gentle, the gentleness made her cry. 
IfI looked weary, the weariness 
made her cry. Ifl asked questions 
about her family, nervousness 
brought a flood of tears. It seemed 
wisest to offer her jokes which 
would keep her laughing, only I 
didn't feel like serving her all the 
time as the court jester. Once I told 
her I needed time to myself, and she 
went down to Dainty Maid to buy 
cookies as an apology for being a 
nuisance. 
I could have discouraged her devotion with a brave little speech about her staying in her dorm to study and having a good time with her friends in Regina. She would have read between the lines for the message. "It might break her heart," I thought sentimentally; and then argued with myselfin response: "How much do I know about the toughness ofa young woman's heart?" I could imagine the bloody note ofself-destruction attached to a bunch offorget-me-nots and signed by "the student you didn't have time for," or another reproach equally grim. 
Nothing much is harder to take than the feeling ofbeing depended on in a way you have not freely chosen. I hated looking up from Mass to find those adoring eyes fixed on my face as though I were Elvis giving a private concert to his most loyal fan. I believed that Beth 
had a crush as true-blue as the saints 
loving God. It could last until the 
stars fell on Alabama, or until I did 
something cruel as proof! was 
unworthy as a father-figure, or its 
equivalent, to a lonely girl, who 
may have left home too young. How 
should I know what causes a 
schoolgirl crush? 
I'm too much the gentleman to 
wish to play the cad. I'm too super­
stitious about crushes to treat them 
meanly. No regret leaves you 
feeling more shabby than the one 
that comes at seeing the affection 
offered you grow into indifference 
or hate, because you deliberately 
made fun ofit, or turned a cold 
shoulder. I decided to do the best I 
could for Beth, holding very still for 
her until she got her feet on safer 
ground. 
I didn't imagine my role in this soap opera ofinnocence. This past Christmas, Beth told me that until her senior year, I was number one in her life. I pointed her to other friendships, she said, which eventu­ally left me in second place on her hit parade, and then three or four. Now I am one ofthe Very Impor­tant People in her life, with no star billing. She, for me, is the dearest girl in the world who makes some of my best days possible. She helped me, you see, grow up by accepting responsibility; not letting the sweet whimsy and sentiment, which left her sitting on my doorstep like a foundling, turn to embarrassment and regret. Beth is getting married in 1985, and we have this wonder­ful joke of my being December and her being May, as in the plot ofan old movie. 
Maybe you have to be 40 or 50 to realize that love, freely offered, isn't an albatross hanging around your neck like a millstone. It is, in Chris­tian language, a grace from God not found in a sacrament. It's a holy act when someone asks you to let her depend on you for peace ofsoul. You are blessed ifyou have the courage to give someone, who looked like a burden, the love to grow on. 
Suburbs to bring foot-tapping rock 
by Tom Tierney 
features staffwriter 
'"T"1he Suburbs will be invading 
1 Indiana tonight as they bring their unique style to tht· Stepan Center In a welcome-hack-to­school concert, at 8. 
lbe Suburbs are a Minneapolis­based band specializing in music with a big beat and bass line, sharp guitar riffs, and weird, comic-like lyrics sung in a throaty caged-in animal style. 
lbe members of the band include Beej Chaney on guitar and vocals, Chan Voling on piano and vocals, Bruce Allen on guitar, Michael Halliday on bass, and Hugo Klaers on drums. All are high school friends who formed the group in 197R 
After releasing a few singles in 1978 and 1979, they came out with their debut album in 1980, titledIn Combo. Best described as "acid­boogie," this album is permeated with the raw rock-n-roll energy ofa young band having a great time. 
The highlight ofln Combo is a song called "Cows." It contains 

r some of the silliest lyrics ever re­
r corded: "I like Cows, and they like 
r me. I like cows, they go moo when 
r they cat, and like their friends -the shaved sheep, they got funny feet." After releasi nv. their first album, people on both coasts were begin­
ning to notice them, as even Robert Christgar, music critic ofVillage Voices putln Combo among his top-40 albums of 1980. The ques­tion at the end of 1980 was what direction the band would take for its next release. The question was answered with the release ofof their ambitious second album -a double LP titled Credit in Heaven. 
Released in the fall of 1981, Credit in Heaven more closely approached music's mainstream. Dominated by the piano, this album is much more melodic than their first effort. In losing their "garage­sound," they did not lose their lyrical quickness. 
lbe single release from the al­bum, "Music for Boys," was also their first venture into the world of 12-inch dance mixes. Steve Green­berg, who was behind the dance hit "Funkytown," remixed the song which stayed onBt/lboard's dance chart for 16 weeks in the summer of 1982. 
After this success, several record­ing companies began knocking on their door, which prompted the release ofa five-song LP in the fall of 1982 entitledDream Hog. The dance remix of"Waiting" on this release could be found on the charts thoughout that winter. 
The sound onDream Hog is much more piano-and dance­oriented. With this newer sound, they signed with the Polygram organization in january of 1983 and hadDream Hog re-released on a Mercury label. 
All ofthis publicity and notoriety put pressure on the band to come up with some good songs for their next album -the first to be released by them on a major label. It looked like they had finally made it to the big time, and their next album­LoveIs the Law -had two bona-fide 
t<'P 40 hits · "Love is the Law" and 
"Rattle My Bones." 
Recently, the band has recorded a new album which will be released this spring. It promises to be their best yet. 
On the concert scene, the Sub­urbs have become known for their intense, energetic shows. Their music forces one's feet to move, so their shows invariably end up as a hot, bobbin~ mass ofbodies. 
.\ftn playing anywhere thc.:y could ~ct a gig back in the/n Combo days. the Suhurhs now play to sold-out dubs throughout the Midwc~t. New York, and Los An­geles areas. "Jhey paid their dues and are due for a break. With a good single on their new album and the proper promotion, they could finally achieve pop-stardom and be heard on top-40 stations across the country this summer.

The long shadow cast by 'Star Wars' weapons 
Brewing discontent in the Columbian hills 
The Space Shuttle, onJanuary 23, will make its most controversial journey to date. Aboard the craft will be a new satellite with the capa­bility to transmit intelligence-rich electronic signals from the Soviet Union to the United States. While the mission is, by its very nature, a matter of controversv. the demands and at-

s e If-transcendency 
tacks made upon our free press hav~ been both stifling and dangerous. 
On the morning of Dec. 20, Washington Post readers were treated to, in the words of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, "the height of journalistic irresponsibility." The remarks made by Weinberger as well as by others resurrect two very important ques­tions. The first, what is national security such that government officials, elected by and for the people, have the ability to withhold and censor information? And, the second, in a country with a free press must news organiza­tions be expected to withhold public informa­tion at the request ofgovernment officials? 
The current administration's perception of national security is profoundly distorted. Gov­ernment officials maintain that this prohibi­tion of public information is necessary in order "to keep Moscow from learning too much about American satellite capabilities." We would be very naive to believe that the Soviet Union obtains its sensitive information concerning the United States through our news media, as the Reagan administration would have us believe. Certainly, any informa­tion which news organiztions have gathered is already in the hands of Soviet officials. This apparently was only an excuse by the Reagan administration in order to, once again (remember the restrictions placed upon the free press during Reagan's Grenada invasion) prohibit the flow ofpublic information to the people. 
Viewpoint Policy 

National security, according to the adminis­tration, means, in a sense, that the people should not be allowed to know about matters of a controversial nature, perhaps in order to avoid public scrutiny. It is certain, however, that the demands made upon our free press were not made in order to preserve the secur­ity of the nation. We must surely believe this; it does not seem likely that Kremlin leaders woke up on Dec. 20, to first learn ofthis Space Shuttle mission by glancing through The Washington Post. This obviously was not a matter ofnational security and the people, for whom the free press works, should have been informed ofthis mission. (Remember, it is tax­payer's dollars which finance big toys like these anyway.) 
Should news organizations, in a country with a free press, be expected to withhold public information at the request ofa govern­ment official? I think not. 
The free press is like the church; it should remain separate and independent of any gov­ernment controls, restrictions, and prohibi­tions. The public has an unequivocal right to know. Our government, elected by and for the people, must answer to public scrutiny. The free press provides the objectivity by which we judge our government's progress. If, in our democracy, we disagree with the actions of our government, we can, under the First Amendment, petition the government for redress ofgrievances. 
The free press publicizes, and rightly so, the actions ofour government, thus creating a sys­tem of checks and balances between the people and their government. Our free press is sacred and should in no way be subor­dinated or restricted by our public officials. 
What Caspar Weinberger said is totally un­forgivable. In order to preserve any semblance of democracy, our First Amend­ment in general, and our free press in particu­lar, must be upheld at all costs.

Tille liberal, anti-nuclear establishment in Am('fica has mocked it, including the "Gang of 
Max Lerner 

The Max Lerner Column 

Four" headed by Robert McNamara and in­cluding also four former secretaries ofstate. 
Coming home from Geneva, Secretary George Shultz noted that the Russians there did not share the skepticism of some Americans about the "Star Wars" technology. The lact is that they are eating their hearts out about it. They want to stop its development midway in course, and they cannot take the chance that it will bypass them. 
One of the four ex-secretaries, Dean Rusk, has said that "if the United States can perfect the technology, the Soviet Union can too." Then, he says, we will have to spend hundreds ofbillions for new offensive weapons to pene­trate the Soviet defensive screening. This is, he adds, is "just as certain in my mind as the rising of the sun." 
If the Russians were sure that they could "perft·ct the technology," they would not be yelling so loud against it. 
Tht TV anchormen and commentators 
have been viewing the "Star Wars" initiative 
and the Geneva talks as an extinction crisis for 
the human race. That is a tall order. And their 
portentous reporting sounds pretty apocalyp­
tic. It makes more sense to see it as a crisis in 
the Soviet economy and technology. 

As compared with the two great economic powers of the West -the United States and Japan -the Soviets are in a backwater. If there is going to be a new weapons generation of the nuclear age, it will come as the product of the high-tech revolution. America and Japan are the competing economic parties in that revolution. The Soviet Union, with all its im­perial power, simply is not in the same class. 
China, far less a power than the Soviet, is even more haunted by its backwardness, but under Deng it is doing something about it ­importing Western technology, opening itself to the free market ideology, subjecting its in­dustrial managers to collective self-criticism. 
The Soviet leaders have not dared follow 
the Chinese example. They are eager to im­
port the Western technology any which way­
to buy, borrow or steal it, as in the past. 

But the problem is that "Star Wars" does not yet exist as a defensive weapons system but only as a complex of ideas in high-tech labs and high-tech minds. And the Russians are backward on both. They read the American papers and are given free summaries of the state of the space technology art. But in any race with America, they know they would lose. 
To break out of this impasse Chernenko would have to do a Deng and ride hard on the comatose party bureaucrats who stifle Soviet technology and management. If a future leader could do this it would mean that America had prodded Russia into a long­needed technological revolution. And that in turn might pave the way for a political change.

The public right to scrutinize government 
Have you ever heard the story ofJuan Val­dez, the coffee-commercial star? 
Juan is an expert in coffee because he has been hand-picking coffee beans for the past forty years -ever since he was eight years old. Also, Juan comes from a great tradition ofcof­fe_e pickers. Juan's gr_(:at grandfather used to 
Santiago O'Donnell 
free-lance 
pick cofl'ee beans with his bare hands, and so didJuan's grandfather. Juan's father still works on the fidds. 
Guess what Juan's children and grandchildren will do? Yes, they will be in the fields, m.oong sure the taste of hand-picked Colombian coffee reaches your house every day. 
Meanwhile, Juan Valdez is a big television star. Excttse me, Juan is also part ofthe Ameri­can dream being the only coffee picker to become .rich by legal means. You see, the Colombian government needs weapons from the United States to fight leftist guerrillas, but the United States only buys coffee. So it's either grow coffee or ... "Juan meets Mary Jane." 
It's all part of a game called free trade. Today General Gonzalez needs a couple of helicopters, like the ones he saw on the televi­sion show "Airwolf." General Gonzalez needs helicopters to control the thousands of peasants that are tired of picking coffee, and

Anne Monastyrski Sports Ed1ior.. ..... Michael Sullivan Viewpoint Editor .. ... Dave Grote Features Editor . . ..... Mary Healy Photo Editor . .... . . ... Pete Laches 
Uncle Sam's wife drinks coffee for breakfast. The trade is obvious, as is who decides on the price ofthe coffee. Uncle Sam decides that his exclusive helicopters are worth X tons ofcof­fee, and that number means that Juan's family will spend the rest oftheir lives picking coffee. 
When the harvest is badJuan's family suffers the consequences; their fault for placing all their eggs in the basket. When the harvest is good, the price ofcoffee drops, in accordance to the law ofsupply and demand. 
Does the game seem fair? I don't know, some people in Detroit don't seem to like it anymore, they want to change the rules. They argue that the small, silly looking Japanese dude with the big round glasses is very smart, despite his appearence. Furthermore, he is leaving many American auto workers jobless. 
This is terrible. What should we do about the game? Pick one ofthese three approaches: 
Ronald McDonald proposes we insert a spe­cial clause in the game reminding the Japanese that G.l.Joe reconstructed their eco­nomy after World War II. G.l. Joe, of course, grew up in Detroit, henceJapanese should not be allowed to sell cars in the United States. 
General Gonzalez proposes to leave the game rules as they are, because if the rules change thousands of coffee pickers will have funny ideas about the system. 
Finally, Juan's family proposes to change the rules entirely.

OMAHA, Neb. -Creighton Univer­sity is considering an invitation to join the Midwestern City Confer­

fenburger said.  
"We'll  attempt  to  make  our  

decision by May," Offenburger said. "Midwestern City has a lot to offer us in terms ofcommonality." 
Like Creighton, the eight univer­sities in the conference are private schools, and basketball is the major sport at each. Four schools are run byJesuits, as is Creighton. 
"We're looking to get a commit­ment one way or another," Commis­sioner James Shaffer said by phone from the league office in In­dianapolis. "Ifthey decide they don't want to join, we wish them well." 
IfCreighton accepts the invitation and leaves the Missouri Valley Con­ference, the Bluejays would play basketball regularly against league members Oral Roberts in Tulsa, Oklahoma City, St. louis, Detroit, Loyola of Chicago, Butler in In­dianapolis, Evansville and Xavier in Cincinnati.

Number-four senior center 
Expert says Blab can go pro 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind.-Uwe Blab, Indiana University's 7-2 center, wants to play professional basket­ball. 
"Oh, definitely, I would like to," he says. "That's what I'm consider­ing ifI have a chance." 
Marty Blake, basketball's super scout, says he'll get the chance in the National Basketball Association. 
"There's no question he's going to be drafted in the first round," said the Atlanta-based Blake. 
Blab said so far no one has talked to him about the NBA. He'll play out this season -Saturday he faces an­other 7-footer, Brad Sellers, at Ohio State -and then see what develops. 
"I would like to go pro," he said. "But ifI don't have a chance for that, I can also play in Europe. If I don't have a chance for that, I can also go and play in Germany." 
He already has been approached by a semi-pro team m his native country that would ~Jlow him to play and attend graduate school. 
Blake considers Blab the fourth­best senior center available when the 23 NDA teams make their selec­tions next June. 
Ranked in front of him are Geor­getown's Patrick Ewing, Arkansas' Joe Kleine and SMU'sJon Koncak. 
"I like him for a number of reasons," said Blake. "One is because he has developed what I think is the only unstoppable shot in basketball, the hookshot. I don't know why more people don't work on a hook­shot. 
"He runs the court. He's worked on his offense, he posts up. Uwe is a very, very good player. I saw him for two weeks out at the Olympics and there's no question he can play in the NBA and definitely be a factor." 
Concurring with Blake's assess­ment on Blab is Kent Benson, who earned All-America honors at center for Indiana University. 
"I think there's no doubt he's going to get drafted, because num­ber one he's 7-2, he's got a good hookshot, good inside moves. It's just a matter of time until he gets to playing up to his potential," said Benson, now a member ofthe NBA's Detroit Pistons. 
There's one other factor, Benson notes, that makes Blab an excellent pro prospect. Playing for coach Bob Knight instills discipline, and all his players learn to play strong defense. 
"The defensive principles he 
teaches helped me remain in the 
league," said Benson, who spent 
time with Blab during the German's 
sophomore season.

"There are a lot of NHA players who don't like to play defense. I'm just thankful that Coach Knight got me to the point in my ability where I was really confident I could play defense and do the things that are important in staying in the NBA." 
Indiana Pacers scout Tom Newell is another who joined the Blab band­wagon after watching him score 31 points against Western Kentucky last month. 
"I think he has come into his own. He's finally getting a grasp of what coach Knight is preparing him for," Newell said. 
"Probably, the one area he im­presses me with is in the paint where he has a legitimate shot he can count on. He has a money shot in that hook. It's kind of like a lost art in the amateurs. I would say it makes him a 
 

very formidable force in the middle," Newell added. Blab admits his confidence fluctu­ates. 
"Some nights I think I can (play professionally) definitely. Then other nights I don't think I can. 
"I think I've done a lot of different things this year and I like them the way they go, especially offensively. I tend to get more into the offense this year and I think that's kind of good and important for the pros, but besides that I still have to have con­sistency." 
The Munich native says that just being able to shoot the hookshot won't assure him a job in the NBA. He points out he must develop his strength. He learned a little about what he will encounter in the NBA when he worked out with the Los Angeles Clippers' James Donaldson last summer.

We won't be slowing the ball down, 
by any means, though." 
As has been the case lately, David 
Rivers will be the key man in Notre 
Dame's attack, according to Phelps. 
In his first game against DePaul, the 
freshman's shot selection was poor 
at times, and he had a tough time 
with Patterson at both ends of the 
floor. 
"David's learned a lot from the sit­
uations that he's been in since last 
time," notes Phelps. "There was too 
much pressure on him defensively 
then, but now our defense has im­
proved -we've plugged some holes. 
We're in a better position now. 
We're healthy and ready to play." 
Rivers will get help from back­
court mate Scott Hicks, as well as the 
tri-captain frontcourt ofKen Barlow, 

Jim Dolan and Tim Kempton. In the 
last game with DePaul, Dolan, 
Kempton, and Donald Royal, Notre 
Dame's big rebound men, combined 
for just six boards in 60 total 
minutes of play. Those three will 
have to rise to the occasion to keep 
the likes of Corbin, Holmes, Com­
egys, and Marty Embry from con­
trolling the boards Sunday. 
Embry probably will start at 
center for DePaul, with Holmes and 
Corbin at the forwards and Com­
megys the first man off the bench. In 
the backcourt, Patterson will be 
joined by either TonyJackson or 6-7 
sophomore Lawrence West, who 
got his first start in DePaul's 69-58 
win over Houston last Saturday. 
As big a game as this is for Notre 

Dame, Phelps knows that DePaul ­
also is in need ofa victory Sunday. 
"They need this game too," ex­
plains Phelps, "Because we're both 
Independents. Both teams have 
struggled a little bit on the road over 
the last few weeks, and now this is 
the time of year you want to get it 
going a~ain. They're looking for a big 
win on the road, and they're looking 
for consistency from their bench." 
The Irish will be doing everything 
they can to prevent the Blue 
Demons from getting either one.

Tough competition 
ND swimmers take on Ball State 
By MARY SIEGER 
Sports Writer 
New semesters always seem to 
start with a bang. 
This weekend, the Notre Dame 
women's swim team faces some of 
the toughest competitors on its 
schedule as the BaU State University 
Cardinals storm into the Rockne 
Memorial Pool this Sunday at 2 p.m. 
for Notre Dame's first dual meet of 
the spring semester. 
If the Cardinals defeat Central Indiana University this afternoon, they will walk into Sunday's contest with a spotless dual meet record. 'The only blemish in Ball State's season record is a second-place finish behind Bowling Green Uni­versity In the Bowling Green Relays last semester. 
The Irish also dropped a tough decision to Bowling Green last se­mester, their only loss so far this season. 
McCann satisfied 
"We had a tough meet against Bowling Green," explained Notre Dame head coach Dennis Stark. "They (the Cardinals) should be a little less tough than Bowling Green." 
Last year, Ball State decisively defeated the Irish 95-45. While Stark hesitates to predict the outcome of Sunday's meet, he expects the Irish to be more competitive with the Cardinals this time. 
"They have an older program and offer scholarships; they can flU their spots more easily when they're weak and it all adds up," said Stark. "We're in shape and we should improve be­cause we have more depth." 
A training trip to sunny Puerto Rico helped the Irish stay in shape during Christmas break. But the 10­day working vacation did more for the team than give swimmers a chance to flaunt healthy suntans during this arctic South Bend Janu­ary. 
The team swam two training ses­
sions daily in the same pool used for 
the 1979 Pan-American Games. The 
Irish shared facilities with several 
other American !.miversities training 
for the remainder of their seasons. 
"Since everyone paid their own way, it was important for the trip to be enjoyable and educational," said Stark. "We had an opportunity in training to be able to face BaU State in better shape." 
In their last meet ofl984, the Irish improved their season record to 3-1 by handily defeating Valparaiso Uni­verisity, 78-54. While the victory gave the Irish a 1-0 record in the Northstar Conference, Stark ex­plained the team's real test in confer­ence competition will come later in the season. 
"It was good to end on a win and it gave us a better psych to get started," he said. "It also gave us the opportunity to let people swim other things." 

Irish wrestlers gain experience 


ByJOE BRUNETTI 
Sports Writer 
The added practice time provided by Christmas break allowed Notre Dame wrestling coach Fran McCann to stabilize his lineup for the second halfofthe season. It also exposed his squad to some tough competition. 
After trouncing Valparaiso at home before finals, the Irish headed to Deland, Fla., to compete in the Sunshine Open on Dec. 28 and 29. Facing competition from over 30 schools, the Irish ended up a respec­table ninth. John Krug paced the Irish with his third place finish. 
"We accomplished my goal," said McCann. "I wanted to finish in the top 10 and we did that."

After returning to South Bend for a couple of weeks, the Irish headed to South Carolina to face Clemson and Southwest Missouri State. The Tigers of Clemson proved to be too

Hockey team goes on road 
By ED DOMANSKY 
Sports Writer 
LAKE FOREST, IU. -After a brief stop at home for Tuesday's contest with Alao;ka-Fairbank.o;, the Notre Dame hockey team ( 5-12) returns 
to the road this weekend to compete 
In the Forester Classic at Lake Forest College. 
lbe tournament field includes the host Foresters, Bowdoin, River Falls and the Irish. 
Friday night's first game begins at 7 p.m. and has Lake Forest scheduled to meet River Falls. 
The Foresters, 9-3 overall, enter the tourney riding an eight-game winning streak. Lake Forest defeated Notre Dame, 5-4, Dec. 8 at the ACC. 
River Falls Is 5-6 and is coming off a split with Mankato State last weekend. 
-
The Irish wiiJ meet defending champion Bowdoin in the evening's second contest beginning at 9:30. Notre Dame will be looking for its first road victory after eight defeats away from the ACC this season. 
The consolation game is slated for 4 p.m. on Saturday with the champi­onship game scheduled to get un­
derway at 7 p.m. 
"Clemson really intimidated the heck out of us," said McCann. "We weren't mentally ready. I was disap­pointed in our performance because we worked so hard in practice." 
The Irish had an easy time with Southwest Missouri State and captured a 39-1 5 decision. 
The next day the Irish finsihed a surprising second in Clemson's Tiger 8 Tournament. This time, however, the Irish handled tourney champion Clemson much better. 
"Our guys had some close matches this time even though we didn't win them," said McCann. "But that's what we're looking for. We were a totaUy different team. We just want them to go out there and open up." 
Up until Christmas the Irish wrestled without a heavyweight, but freshman footbaU walk-on Dominic Prinzivalli did a good job anchoring that spot during break. The 6-5 Prin­zivalli finished the trip with a 2-2 mark and a fourth-place finish at the TigerS.

"Heintzelman really turned it on," said McCann, "and he scored early. That's what we wanted to do from the start." 
Scott Biasetti, filling in for the injured Luke DiSabato, lost the only match of the evening for the Irish in a 12-2 defeat at 1 50. He scored the

Freshman Ken Kasler won a relatively close one at 1 58, but the Ohio native led throughout en route to an 8-3 decision. 
"Kasler did a nice job," praised McCann. "He's going to be a good wrestler some day. He's smart and he pays attention." 
The ever-reliable John Krug had an easy time with his opponent and scored a convincing 12-4 decision at

Associated Press 
STANFORD, Calif. · It starts with Dan Marino · and that's where it ends. 
Nobody has been able to cool off the Miami Dolphins' quarterback. Some of the best defenses in the Na­tional Football League have tried and failed. The San Francisco 49ers will be no different. 
They will have their moments. But so will Marino · quite a few of them. A 30-yard pass here, a 50· yarder there. Mark Duper on the fly. Mark Clayton on a crossing pattern. Tony Nathan over the middle. 
And the Dolphins will run, too. 
Woody Bennett and Nathan may not 
be Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick, but 
between them they rushed for 1,164 
yards during the season and 214 
more in the playoffs.

In just his second pro season, Marino made a lot ofpeople · well, a few, anyway · forget about Bob Griese, the quintessential Dolphin quarterback. 
He displayed supreme confi­dence, almost arrogance, in his abil­ity to find any ofperhaps half a dozen receivers slicing through the sec­ondary and to fire or feather the ball to the open one · and someone is al­ways open. 
He threw the ball more than any quarterback in the NFL, 564 times, and was sacked only 13 times, a trib­ute to center Dwight Stephenson, guards Roy Foster and Ed Newman and tackles Jon Giesler and Cleveland Green. 
He threw for 5,084 yards and 48 touchdowns, both NFL records, and was intercepted only 17 times. 
The 49ers have an offense, too, with Joe Montana throwing to Dwight Clark, Freddie Solomon and Earl Cooper and with Wendell Tyler and Roger Craig running. 
But it is not the "on-any-given­play-we-can-pick-up-75-yards-and­aren't the no-name players of the Dolphins' Super Bowl teams of the 1970s. Statistically, they weren't the match ofSan Francisco's defense this year.

They will win because Ronnie Lott, Dwight Hicks, Carlton William­son and Eric Wright will not be blown away by Duper and Clayton; because Keena Turner, Mike Walter and Todd Shell will stay with Tony Nathan and the Miami tight ends, and because Fred Dean, Gary Johnson and Dwaine Board will hurry Marino just enough. 

San Francisco defensive coordina· 
tor George Seifert has enough 
people to contain Marino · not stop 
him, just contain him. 

Let's go back a month, to the game in which the Dolphins knocked the Dallas Cowboys out of the playoffs for the first time in a decade. The Cowboys, with a dreary offense, were in contention for a playoff spot only because of their defense, and they limited Miami to 14 points for the first three and a half quarters before Marino got hot. 
San Francisco's defense is better than Dallas' · it hasn't allowed a touchdown in the playoffs. And while comparing Miami to the Giants and the Bears, the 49ers' two playoff victims, is like comparing a snail to a cheetah, the 49ers are talented enough on defense to hold the Dolphins to ... let's say some­where between three and four touchdowns. 
Enter the Miami defense, which has swung between good and awful this season. It's been most awful against the run, which means it will be fodder for Craig and Tyler, assum­ing he can hang onto the ball. If it adjusts too drastically, Montana, with Walsh calling the shots, can pick it apart. 
It's no picnic. If Tyler fumbles or Montana continues his playoff rate of five interceptions in two games, the Dolphins could win. Even easily. 
But if the 49ers play to their stan­dard and the Dolphins play to theirs, it should be: San Francisco 31, Miami 27 (von Schamann misses an extra point). 
Women 
continuedfrom page 16 
On the other end of the court, Notre Dame will try to continue to play the tough defense that has forced its opponents to shoot a poor 40 percent from the field. Detroit is not a particularly good shooting team (.424 percentage), so it is im­portant for the Irish to use their height advantage to keep the Titans from getting second and third shots.
