Four Palestinians accused of hijacking the Achille Lauro cruise ship were convicted with a fifth man yesterday for charges of illegal possession of arms and explosives. The court or­dered prison terms ranging from four to nine years for the five men convicted yesterday. They face trial at a later date on charges of kidnapping and of murdering Leon Klinghoffer aboard the Italian cruise liner during the three-day ordeal in October. They did not talk about the murder of Klinghoffer, the American passenger who was shot and tossed overboard in his wheelchair. However, in a written statement presented to the court, one of the defendants described his Kalashnikov automatic rifle and said it was the one "I used for the most serious crime for which I am accused." -AP

Notre Dame not to blame for unfortunate occurrence 
Is anyone to blame? 
Rape is a sensitive, tragic and brutal act. Unfor­tunately, we are surrounded in this world by many bru­tal acts. 
On May I2, I985, Susan Matre, then a graduating senior of nursing at Saint Mary's, was raped on the road between Saint Mary's and Notre Dame. Because of this incident, Matre filed a S3 million personal injury suit against the University. 
The suit charges that Notre Dame did not supply ade­quate security, protection and lighting on the road bet­ween the two schools. Notre Dame owed Matte "the duty of exercising ordinary and reasonable care to protect her from criminal activity and harm," according to the suit. 
At approximately II p.m. on Sunday, May I2, Matte was walking alone on the road, returning to Saint Mary's from the Grotto. She was wearing earphones and listen­ing to music, so she did not hear her assailant approach her from behind. Matre then

Rakow also commented on the escort policies that have been in existence for several years. Notre Dame security will take one or two female st1,1dents to the in­tersection at 3I and wait until Saint Mary's Security comes to pick up those students. 
Did Susan Matre provide adequate protectionfor her­self! 
No. First, she took the chance of walking outside alone at night. Women constantly are warned never to walk alone at night, and the road joining Saint Mary's and Notre Dame is no exception. Second, she walked with earphones on, thus her attention was intent on the

music. 
But the basic point is that Matre took no personal precautions for herself. One of the first things a Saint Mary's freshman learns is the dangers ofwalking alone. This danger surrounds the world and one would be naive to think that Notre Dame and Saint Mary's are immune to the dangers ofthe outside world. 
We are not living in a Utopia; it is unfortunate that we cannot always be out ofdanger, but that is life. The inci­dent itself is not fair, but for Matte to use Notre Dame as 
a scapegoat is also not fair. 
use the University or College as a scapegoat. 
No amount of security can alleviate the dangers that exist in our world. Notre Dame did provide optimum security and Saint Mary's students were more than warned about the dangers ofwalking alone at night. 
This case is a falacious case. Notre Dame did act reasonably. 
Matre did not. 
Yet, neither is to blame.

was dragged into a wooded area where the assailant bru­tally assaulted and raped her, according to the suit. 
So the question we must ask in the case of Susan Matte is "who was negligent?" 
Did Notre Dame provide adequate protection? 
Yes. The road between the two schools is and was then patrolled every half hour. The road is well lit, well enough to read at night.

Notre Dame should not settle this case. Notre Dame should defend itself because it was not negligent. The

This shadow would allow for future law suits where students would attempt to

WSND airs fund drive for station operations 
ByJULIE PALARAMO 
StaffReporter 
Radio station WSND, FM 88.9, Is tuning in on Its Fall Fine Arts Fund Drive, which will continue to run today through Sunday. 
The fund drive's organizers say they hope to raise 18,000 this fall. The drive is held twice annually. 
To raise money, DJs will be asking for pledges on the air, and the station also will be running a mail campaign for people on the WSND mailing list. 
Notre Dame faculty and staff and other South Bend residents, who comprise a large part of the mailing list, are expected to give strong sup­port to the fund drive, Enderle said. Students also provide money for the drive, he said. 
Donors can send money to P.O. Box "i32, Notre Dame, Ind. 46556or call the station at 239-7342 to pledge. One also can be put on the WSND mailing list and receive a free program every two months by cal­ling the station. 
As an incentive, WSND is offering gift!> for large donations. Classical tapes, WSND Tshirts and tote bags will be offered to donors of $20 or more. 
The station began broadcasting in 1962 and Is the oldest public radio station in the area. WSND broadcasts from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. every day, playing primarily classical music with an occasional jazz program, ac­cording to WSND Business Manager Richard Enderle, a Notre Dame senior. From midnight until 2 a.m., however, the station airs Its own up­beat program called "Nocturne Night Flight," when current tunes can be heard. 
Tlu· FCC-licensed station broad· 
l'OL~ts from a one-room studio on the fourth floor of O'Shaughnessy Hall and reaches an audience within a 45­mile radius of Notre Dame. Recep­tion of the semi-professional radio station is clear on the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's campuses, Enderle said, because the station operates on the FM band. 
In addition to the Notre Dame community, WSND has many lis­teners and supporters in the South Bend area who volunteer their time and money to keep the radio station operating. Enderle said the older lo­cal citizens .are the station's main audience, but he said he would like to have more students tuning In, especially during "Nocturne Night Flight," when modern groups can be heard.

A campus-wide collection for the Hurley f.lmily Is the basis of a drive started Sunday, Oct. 13 at the Masses in the dormitory chapels and at Sacred Heart Church. 
"It was the student body presi­
dent who came to me and asked me 
ifwe could collect money at Sunday 
liturgies," said Father Andre 
Leveille, director ofUniversity Mini­
stry. "We talked It over In my office 
and proceeded because it was a 
good cause. It's one way to show 
that we care." 
At Saint Mary's, donations were 
collected through the Office of 
Campus Ministry and fund raisers 
held by Individual dorms. 
Over 12,000 was collected on the 
Notre Dame campus, while an addi­
tional S830 was collected at Saint 
Mary's. 
"This is a pretty substantial collec­
tion," said Leveille. "In terms of the 
number ofstudents that we have and 
In terms ofgenerosity, I thought that 
it was pretty good." 
The collection at Sacred Heart Church totaled close to $800, and collections made In the hall chapels summed to just over 11,200. 
The money that was collected on the October I 3 weekend has been put Into a fund for Hurley, and when all donations are included, a check will be drawn and presented to his family. 
While the donations on campus have been many and will aid the Hurleys, more should be done, ac­cording to Priscilla Wong, assltant director ofUniversity Ministry. 
"It's a substantial amount of money," Wong said, "but It's also very insignificant compared to the bills that the family has to pay. More can be done, and I think It would be nice to see some really Involved fundraislng. Actually, to set a goal of 120,000 to 25,000 Is not too high." 
In response to a strong desire by students to help their fellow stu­dent, the student government has established a committee to plan events that will provide financial and emotional support for Hurley. 
"The long-term goal is that mayb<: 
Kevin can return to Notre Dame, 
and that would be wonderful," 
Healy said. "But at this point, we 
don't know. This (fundralsing) 
could only help." 

Closed Saint Mary's classes not fault of ND students 
By KIMBERLY TRENNER 
SeniorStaffReporter 
"Many classes did not close out due to Notre Dame students," Stu­dent Body President Ann Marie Kol· lman said at last night's meeting of the Saint Mary's Board of Gover­nance. Many students have com­plained that they were blocked out of classes because students from Notre Dame filled their places. 
"Students may have been misin­formed about the closing ofclasses," Kollman said. Each department al­lots a specified number ofspaces for Notre Dame students In each class, according to Teresa Marcy, assistant to the vice president. This policy prevents Notre Dame students from closing Saint Mary's students out of classes. 
In other business, Kollman an­nounced that Resource cards will be provided free of charge by First Source Bank for those students on the campus payroll. Complaints among student workers who had to purchase these cards spurred the board to take action. 
Students on the payroll are forced to open an account with the bank.Their pay automatically Is deposited In this account. To provide the students easy access to their paychecks, the bank had of· fered workers a Resource card for 
no. 
The bank's new policy Is to provide workers with a card at no extra charge. Students who already have paid this fee may see Rosemary Remble at First Source for a full refund . 
Coming student elections also were discussed at the meeting. "Both class and student body elec­tions will be In February," Elections Commissioner Mary I.ally said. 
"We have decided to change hall elections to four on a ticket," said Kollman. The previous policy oftwo students running on each ticket was changed with the hope that cam· paign work would be distributed more evenly. 
Also discussed was the U.S. Route 
31 crossing. A letter sent to the St~te 
Highway Commission proposed the 
following: 
 
to provide a strobe light on the traffic signal 

 
to delay the signal between the light cycle 

 
to Increase lighting, perhaps ex­tending to the toll road 

 
to provide a traffic signal at Douglas Road

He received a notice that he was to be put under house arrest for five years. This meant he could never be in the presence of more than two people at the same time, he was restricted to one area and he had to be in his home from 6 p.m. until 6 
a.m. every night. 
One month after his house arrest expired, he was held in deterl_tion under the terrorism act. While in detention one's whereabouts are un­known. During this time prisoners

The Environmental Protection Agency is re­ducing the amount of lead allowed in leaded gasoline by more than 90%. General Motors supports this effort to reduce lead in the atmo~ sphere. But our customers need to know how this action may affect their vehicles. 
In simple terms, con­tinue with the same gas­oline you've been using. You probably won't notice any difference at your ser­vice station. 1ust be sure your gasoline meets the requirements below. 
For post-1974 model cars and light trucks (less thah 6,000 lbs.). Continue to use unleaded gasoline only. The new lower-lead limits for leaded gasoline are still too high: lead in gasoline will harm the emission­control system. 
For 1971-74 ~model cars and light trucks. Use eithe:r unleaded or the new lower-lead gaso­line. These vehicles were designed to run on either one. 
For all pre-1971 model cars and trucks. Use the new lower-lead gasolines. These vehicles need leaded gas to lubri­cate exhaust valves. The lead raises octane ratings and helps to avoid "knock­ing" and "pinging:' The lead is most important during continuous high­speed, high-load condi­
tions such as towing a 
heavy trailer or large boat 
over a long distance. In a 
pinch, you can even use 
unleaded gas for normal 
driving. 
Tip: Use only enough 
octane to avoid frequent 
knocking. An occasional 
"pir:tg" won't harm the 
engme. 
The new lower-lead 
gasolines should always 
be used in: 
 
1971-78 trucks over 6,000 lbs. 

 
post-1978 trucks over 8,500 lbs. 


The effect of alco­
hol blends. To meet the new regulations, oil re­finers will tum to other methods to maintain or increase octane ratings. Some will elect to refine gasoline more intensively. Others may add octane enhancers such as ethanol 'and methanol (more infor­mally known as grain alco­
hol and wood alcohol). 
General Motors sup­ports the use of such alternative fuels to les­sen our nation's depen­dence on imported oil. But to avoid operating and other problems, don't use gasoline containing more than 10 percent ethanol or 5 percent meth­anol. And in the .case of methanol, be sure it contains cosolvents (to prevent separation of the alcohol from the gasoline) and corrosiOn inhibitors. 

General Motors is taking steps to ensure that its future vehicles can operate problem-free with gasoline containing alco­hol. For now, you should know the contents of the fuel going into your gas tank. That's why we sup­port the requirement that gas pumps show the alco­hol content of the fuel. Such labels are being used in some states, but they are needed nation­wide. 
To get the efficiency, driveability and perfor­mance we design into your G M vehicles, be sure you use the right fuel. The proper identification and use of gasoline is good for both G M cus­tomers and G M cars and trucks. 
This advertisement is part of our continuing effort to give customers useful information about their cars and trucks and the company that builds them. ·

Smokeout helps students kick the habit 
ANDREW KINNEY 
featun!s writer 

I-I 
ave you tried to stop smoking 
but nothing seems to work? If 

that Is the case, "Smokeout" is for 
you. 
The American Cancer Society Is 

holding its fifth annual "Smokeout" 
this Thursday, November 21. 
Representatives were on campus in 
front of the North dining hall yes· 
terday and will be in front ofSouth 
dining hall tomorrow with activities 
and information about smoking. 
'!be Smokeout is a nationwide 

effort by the American Cancer 
Society to have those wtlo smoke 
stop for the 24 hour period of the 
Smokeout day. "The annual 
Smokeout helps smokers realize 
that they can do it," according to 
Lyla Bruce of the society's local 
chapter. "It just takes one day at a 
time." 
The main feature of the boothes an: the "promissary notes," which work as contracts for those plan­ning to take part in the day. The notes are signed by the person who intends to delay his smoking as well as the person who may have signed him up. 
"The promlssary notes," Bruce added, "require that you have to have some things planned and some things in hand." Those wishing that a friend stop, Bruce continues, must understand that smoking is one of the hardest habits to break. Smoking is emotionally, socially, as well as physically addicting. The best thing to do is "have some un­derstanding and some sympathy." 
<ireeting cards, buttons, and "~urvival packs," containing in· formation about smoking, are among the various items the hoothes arc handing out. Acom­puter is available to show th( risk one has for developing lung cancer based on certain factors such as heredity. 
Much publicity about the effects 

ofcigarette smoking has been circ­
ulated in re<:ent years, and by this 
time most people are aware ofIts 
connection with cancer. From the 
non-smoker's standpoint, the logi· 
cal solution to smoking would be 
just to stop. The actual stopping, 
though, entails much more than just "giving it up." According to ex­
smokers, the real situation is quite 
different. 
"I had a lot of nervous energy and 
I was shaky," recalled Kelly Har­
rington of Notre Dame when she 
described her first day without 
smoking. "!tried to substitute ac­
tivities and keep my mind offofit." 
Kelly felt that a special motiva­
tion was necessary to break the 
habit once and for all. 6iving it up is 
"something you have to want to do 
rather than something that you 
think is right to do." Her reason for 
quitting was because someone 
}:lose to her aquired lung cancer 
through smoking. "Suddenly it 
seemed to me that my smoking was 
a slap in the face to her." 
Different people, Kelly con­
tinued, give up smoking for dlf· 
ferent reasons and in many different 
ways. Some give it up because it 
looks ugly. Others quit because 
they find that they don't have much 
energy. Many give up "cold turkey," 
and find that the complete 
withdraw! is too much a jolt for 
their system to bear. It is better for 
some to give up gradually · it is all 
according to how a person knows 
himself and which way he is able to 
stop. Activities such as exercise 
were helpful to Kelly, but drinking 
cola or coffee tended to aggravate 
her nervousness. 
"You really have; to think about it...people think they're exempt." The fear ofcancer is becoming less and less of a threat. Cancer is now an everyday word. For smokers, the threat is not enough. A non-smoker who reminds the smoker of this 
'pbint doesn't have much effect. 
Someone who wants to quit must 
have "someone who smoked with 
the experience to give support. You 
see the goal." 
The non-smoker who wants the smoker to stop, Kelly concluded, must understand that the smoker doesn'tjust stop smoking, he also .must change numerous patterns 'which have been set for a long time such as hand-to-mouth movements. 
Smokers who wish to quit might contemplate to undertal<e quitting on their own. American Cancer Society statistics show that three quarters of the smokers who have quit did so by themselves. 


'Healthy' cigarette is the goal for scientists 
The Associaud Press 

I 
t will be years before scientists 
develop a "safe" cigarette, says 

the director of the federal tobacco 
research facility in Oxford, N.C. 
"!think we can accomplish what 

we're trying to do, but I'd hate to 
say when," said Dr. James Chaplin, 
director of the U.S. Agriculture 
Department's Oxford Tobacco 
Research Lab. "We're not that 
close...it's a slow process." 
Chaplin said two of the lab's I 0 

scientists were working on breed­
Ing tobacco plants with a lower 
level of tar by crossing lines with 
low tar and less-than-desirable 
smoking qualities with lines that 
have good smoking qualities and 
the usual amount of tar. 
Although some 5'50 samples were 

grown this year, the scientists can 
test only 300 samples a year be­
cause they have to cure the 
tobacco, make It Into cigarettes and 
smoke them on smoking machines 
that analyze the tar and nicotine, he 
said. 
"We haven't come: up with a real 

fast method ofanalyzing for tar," said Chaplin. "We can go much 
faster if we didn't have to go 
through that process. 
The Oxford lab has focused for the last five or six years on reducing tar in tobacco. He said USDA labs in Beltsville, Md., and Athens, Ga, were concentrating on reducing the amount ofother harmful sub­stances found In cigarettes, such as solansol and phenols. 
"We have worked with nicotine, 
but this is not so much associated 
with health," said Chaplin. "People 
are smoking cigarettes with lower 
nicotine levels, but tar is the thing 
we blame for most ofour health 
problems." 
Comercially available cigarettes with low tar and nicotine are made with the substances processed out of the tobacco during the manufac­turing process, he said. 
Chaplin said his lab was also working on breeding tobacco varieties resistant to diseases and insects. Other research focuses on new techniques ofbreeding in an effort to shorten the time required to develop different varieties. 
The scientists are also working on methods ofcontrolling insects that attack stored tobacco .

Notre Dame policy may force birth control use 
As a married Notre Dame faculty couple, we read with interest the front-page story in the Friday, Nov. 15 Observer on Mary Ann Trax· ler, the Saint Mary's education professor re· 
·questing maternity leave after adopting a child. While we surely sympathize with her effort to initiate a change in the maternity policy at Saint Mary's, we sympathize even more with the plight of prospective mothers 
on the Notre Dame faculty. 
JoAnn DellaNeva and Thomas P. Flint · guest column 
Many members of the Notre Dame -Saint Mary's community are no doubt unaware of Notre Dame's maternity policy. This ig­norance is hardly surprising; several phone 
, 
calls to various members in the administration 
(from Personnel on up) were required before 
we found someone able to answer our ques· 
tions concerning what Notre Dame's mater­
nity policy for faculty actually is. 
What we eventually discovered makes Saint Mary's policy, despite its shortcomings, seem quite generous in comparison. Until this year, Notre Dame women faculty could request up to a three-week leave of absence, barring medical complications. This year, the leave period has been drastically expanded · to a to­tal of(at most) four weeks. 
The pressures this policy places on Notre Dame faculty members should be obvious. An expectant mother on the faculty, even if she could pinpoint, with professorial precision, the exact date ofdelivery, would be forced to work within a fortnight of the baby's birth if she wished the luxury of devoting a full ten days to her newborn once discharged from the hospital after a normall delivery. Whether such a policy demonstrates adequate concern for the physical well-being of a pregnant faculty member is, to put it mildly, debatable; but that it plays havoc with both her teaching and that of her colleagues, who are generally expected to fill in for her without compensa­tion, can hardly be denied. 
Such a policy is also clearly not in the best interest of her students, who may find them­selves in the middle of a semester having to adopt to a new professorwho may not even be genuinely qualified to teach her specialized courses. And given the University's heightened expectations regarding faculty research and publication, the undisputed ex­penditure of time and energy which such research requires, and the fact that pregnancy normally has no effect on the time when one 
comes up for tenure -well, it should hardly come as a surprise that one sees very few women on the faculty, and especially un­tenured women, having children. 
We view this state of affairs as lamentable, especially at a university such as Notre Dame. 
Surely a Catholic institution should not be leading (albeit unintentionally) its employees to engage in practices which it deems morally unacceptable, for example, artificial birth control or abortion; yet we fear that Notre Dame's current maternity policy may well be having just this effect. Even those women who do not turn to such morally questionable al· ternatives are obviously under considerable pressure not to combine family with career. Such pressure would be reduced ifthe Univer· sity were to adopt a more sensitive, realistic maternity policy -one comparable to Saint Mary's current policy of a one semester leave at half salary. We urge that the Notre Dame admimistration seriously consider such a 
change.

, Man holds control over the future of the earth 
r 
r f r  "Each generation," wrote C. S. Lewis in "The Abolition of Man," "exercises power over its successors: and each, in so far as it modifies the environment bequeathed to it and rebels against tradition, resists and limits the power ofits predecessors ...." Alison Pivonka  
in print It is a thing we rarely think about. We speak about it in terms ofthe arms race. We discuss it in relation to the Third World. Yet the actual amount ofthought we give to our power over the future is surprisingly small. Rarely do we take time to consider exactly what the world will be like in ten or twenty years. Predicting  

ourown individual futures is difficult enough. 
In George OrWell's vision of"l984," the ul­
timate power lay in the ability to rewrite his· 
tory. It was the most subtle form of mind 
control; those it affected were without com­
prehension or confidence. They could 
believe, yet they could not prove. Knowledge 
was not forbidden, but neither was it con· 
crete. There was no understanding; all was 
sped up and superficial. 

Yet Orwell's idea ofpower over the past lay in suppression rather than expansion, in limitation rather than improvement. Altera­tion of the future did not -in fact, could not ­follow naturally. There was no future. There was only present. 
The power in which Lewis believed is the power to create a future which grows out of our history, one which is-ifwe give it enough consideration -a bit better, a little more just, and a touch more hopeful. 
It is amazing that so much oftoday's debate centers on the past. It is not a history which we can or ever should rewrite. The power we have to alter the future is limitless-and poten­tially useless. 
This week, all eyes are on Geneva. At stake here is not an arms agreement -history shows us how unsuccessful arms control has been ­but the very future of communication bet­ween the United States and the Soviet Union. Silence between the superpowers leads only to a frightening deterioration of relations. Whether or not anything is achieved on paper, the Geneva summit will have an undeniable impact on U.S.-Soviet relations, both present and future. 
There will always be an arms race: not even the two most powerful men on earth can shut their eyes and make it disappear. Yet the man­ner in which we choose to deal with it will determine the shape ofthe future. 
We are far more powerful than we realize. Our relationship with the Soviet Union will never be rooted in friendship, but it must be grounded in mutual respect: respect not for government or politics or central philosophy but for the power each has over the other and over the existence ofthe entire earth. We can­not return what we inherit, but we can learn how we must live with it before we pass it on.

Protestors forget to point finger at own selves 
If you attend Mass regularly, you've probably noticed that the first reading and the Gospel reading always are thematically related. Sometimes you even can catch.the relation that exists between readings from one Sunday to the next. 
Thomas]. Mayefske 
guest column ~ 
Recently, for example, the apostles James andJohn, when asked byJesus what He could do for them, responded that they wanted preferential treatment. The following Sunday, the biind man, Bartimaeus, when asked by Jesus what He could do for him, responded that he wanted to be cured ofhis blindness. 
The juxtaposition is scathingly brilliant. James and John -the insiders, Jesus' chosen followers · want preferential treatment while the poor, unfortunate outcast seeks to be cured. The question nearly jumps off the pages of Mark's gospel: Who is really blinded here?

tern of apartheid against its black and mixed-race "citizens." American students rail against the injustice, yet many simultaneously impose their own particular brand ofoppres­sion. 
This juxtaposition is a sad commentary, and the same question that Mark raised comes to mind but with added force, when considered in light of Jesus' admonition to remove the planks from our own eyes before attempting to remove the specks in others. 
"But wait," you interrupt, "What oppres· sion?" Lincoln emancipated the slaves, .Jphp.son instituted civil rights legislation, and p~e 'h~dly ever hears slurs like "act like a white man" or ''nigger" anymore. While blacks in American still are struggling for equality, they have been replaced as America's "niggers" by another minority. 
Bigotry has not diminished; it's just that a new target has been found. Racial and ethnic terms ofderision, no longer fashionable, have been replaced by one little word which cuts people ofall colors and ethnic background to the bone. The word? Simple: "fag." 
A trivial issue? Not when millions modify their appearance, behavior, thoughts, and even their very natures just to avoid being 
called "faggot." This is oppression -and it is 
not only gays and lesbians who are its victims. 
Why are words like "fag" used with such 
frequency in the speech of contemporary 
Americans? There are numerous reasons. 
Since gays and lesbians are at the bottom of 
the social pecking order, "fag" is the insult of 
choice when the object is to devastate a per­
son, to show extreme disrespect for a person, 
or to modify another person's behavior. 
"Fag" can be quite effective at achieving 
such ends, but it's even more effectively used 
as a screen; a screen which protects the user 
from the suspicion or accusation by those wit­
hin earshot that he might be gay. 
The unconscious rationale here is that the best defense is a strong offense: "If I demonstrate disgust for gays or lesbians, then ·I can't be accused of being one." In other words, "fag" often is used as a defense mec­hanism to cover up one's own sexual in­
security. 

Just as "nigger" is only the tip ofthe iceberg 
of racial oppression and discrimination, so is 
the popularity of the word "fag" only an in­
dicator of the tremendous oppression levied 
against gays and lesbians inAmerica today. We 
not only mouth insults, we take every oppor-

; 
tunity to deny them the rights and privileges 
which non-gay citizens enjoy: fair housing, 
equal opportunity employment, the pursuit of 
happiness, equality. 
So quick to point the finger at oppression 
overseas, yet so willing to engage in it our­
selves. Who is really blind here?

Plan to replace senate will not be sufficient 
DearEditor: 
The Notre Dame student body faces a very important decision in tcxlay's vote to disband the Student Senate. But let us remember that the proposed changes do not add up to merely eliminating this body from student govern· ment; rather, we have an entirely new con­stitution for student government before us. As students, our responsibility is to be as familiar as possible with the meaning and .potential ramifications of this constitution. 
First, the authors of this proposed constitu· tion claim that the Campus Life Council can become an effective body for the students. Fine. We all should hope the CLC can beef· fective. But why has it not been effective in the recent past? In fact, why had the CLC not even met this year until Nov. 7? The student body president has the power to call a CLC meeting at any time. The CLC has never been dependent on the senate or its effectiveness to conduct business. Unfortunately, presenta· tion of, and argument for this constitution has made the senate appear liable for the CLC's Inactivity this year. It has also made the dis· bandment of the senate look like the cure for the woes ofthe CLC. Nothing could be farther from the truth. 
The role ofthe Hall President's Council also fa<:es change. lltough it has been debated in the !fPC as to the amount of change, the fact remains that the HPC is involved in 11 changes in the proposed constitution and stands to acquire five new powers and respon· sibilities. However, the main focus ofeach hall president is running his or her dorm, and this requires a great deal of committment. With these new responsibilities and a more central role in campus-wide issues, the delicate balance of the duties of each hall president is threatened. It would seem nearly impossible for each hall president to retain his or her ef. fectiveness on the dorm level. 
Finally, we should examine how this whole issue started. Five members of the senate walked out on an October meeting in frustra­tion and proceeded to compose a letter to The Observer calling for "A New Beginning" by disbanding the senate. Two of these five then drafted a new constitution. Is this the way to go about the restructuring of student govern­ment? Is this amendment the only possible solution to student government's problems? We seriously doubt it. 
Questionable also is the amount oftime and work put into this proposal. One ofits authors admitted that many of the differences bet· ween the present and proposed constitutions amounted to "word changes": substituting the words "Student Senate" with the words "Hall President's Council" or "Campus Life Coun· ell" In many Instances. This does not display a great deal of thought or input for such a serious issue. 
Not only does the proposed constitution not reflect proper student input, but the han· dling ofsuch a major change by so few people sets a dangerous precedent for future issues. Vote "no" on the proposed constitution; create a real opportunity to make an effective student government.

Restructuring of senate shares common history 
DearEditor: 
If one were to look back at the history of student government at Notre Dame, espe· cially where It concerns the Student Senate (the senate has been restructured every two 
years or so for approximately the last 20 years) one would see that the proposed amendment that is going to the vote this week looks like a bad joke. I have looked closely at every restructuring since 1968, and they all seem to follow a common sequence: some frustrated student government officials draft a quick restructuring plan to quell student dis· satisfaction with their elected representatives, the restructuring is taken to a quick vote, and it wins becuase "anything is better than the senate now." The restructur­ing, which addresses the problems superifi· cally at best, fails to work for more than a year, student dissatisfaction starts rising again, and the cycle repeats itself. 
The current restructuring follows the above trend to the letter. It does not deal with the problems in any effective way, and, if the students approve it, will just start the sorry cycle of Notre Dame student government on its way again. In order for a restructuring to work, it has to be well researched and thought out. It has to address the problems at root level, not superficially as this one does. 
Do not repeat the problems of the past. 
Vote "no" to the proposed amendment, so 
that an effective restructuring can be planned 
for better student government in the future.

Glory not being sought in effort to be priests 
DearEditor: 
I am writing in response to Thomas D. 
D'Andrea's letter of Nov. 14 concerning Mot· 
her Theresa's views on the ordination of 
women. 
I come from Chattanooga, Tennessee, an area where priests already are overburdened with work and their numbers are declining steadily. This summer, I had the privilege of working as an intern with a Dominican sister, Mary jane Herlik, who works in a large parish in Chattanooga. 
She shares the priest's burden ofwork there 
by running the Rite of Christian Initiation of 
Adults program, coordinating the training of 
deacon candidates, planning liturgies, coun­
seling parishoners, and generally filling the 
needs of the parish. 
I went with Herlik once this summer to visit 
a young man who had been hospitalized fol· 
lowing a motorcycle accident. He was at a tur· 
ning point in his life, for he was for the first 
time facing a reality ofdeath and searching for 
a meaning to life. More than anything else, he 
wanted to be comforted by the Christian com­
munity he knew. He wanted to receive the 
Sacrament of Reconciliation. 
ConsiderSister Mary Jane's position: She is a representative of the Church, a minister to God's people. Yet because she is a woman, she had not had the chance to be ordained and could not answer this man's need for confess­ing his sins and being reconciled with the community. 
She chose not to encourage the man's con· fidences, but rather to promise him that she would ask one ofthe local priests to come and see him. She did not want him to confess his sins to her and then have to repeat them all over again for someone else later one. 
.The moment was lost. An opportunity to niinlster to a hurting child ofGod was wasted . . . because men look more like jesus than women do. 
People such as D'Andrea and, yes, even Mother Theresa, might do well to see that the movement to ordain women is not a denial that we are servants of one another. It is a re· quest that the option of serving the Christian community in this special way be extended to those who are called to give it. 
For centuries the priesthood and hierarchy have been seen as a power structure. But women don't want in on the power structure · they aren't looking for glory. Rather, they want .this power structure to be as it should be, a ministry, a service. 
Please D'Andrea, don't accuse these unsel· fish women of falling prey to the "deceptive and myopic 'logic' of worldly wisdom." Step out ofyour own conception ofthe priesthood as a power trip and step into the ideal ofChris· tian service. Maybe together we can enrich and empower all the children ofGod.

GPAs should be shown to prove superiority 
DearEditor: 

In her Nov. II letter, Carol Meaney places 
emphasis on a "fact" which is of dubious 
value. 

Even if it is true that the administration 
releases figures concerning the overall GPAs 
of both men and women here, is this really 
very important? How much weight can you 
attach to a GPA without knowing the courses 
in which it was reached? 

I will tell you. A GPA is completely meaningless without reference to the major in which it was attained. You see, Meaney, your statistic, while sensational, is completely use­less without further information. 
Thank you, nevertheless, for drawing my at· tention to the fact that this University is male-dominated even though the women are better. I have conceived of an idea through which more callous men will come to realize this. 
Afterall, women have higher GPAs. At any rate, I am starting up a movement with this in mind. I already have .thought of a catchy slogan that we can chant at our meetings: "GPA display." 
It is my belief that every girl on the Notre Dame campus should display her GPA, so that all of us ignorant males with demonstrably lower GPAs than females always will remem­ber that, contrary to our previous beliefs, women are, in fact, superior to men. 
One other very good aspect of this plan (I think there will be cheering today in Breen· Phillips) is that our cheerleaders will have this number displayed also. As a result, every time one of them is photographed, those admiring the picture will also be able to admire her mind. Wouldn't that be great? 
We could give them pop quizzes during games to keep them on their toes. They could sew their GPAs onto their skirts so that all of the male chauvinist perverts always will be reminded of the cheerleaders' intellects regardless ofwhere their minds oflower GPAs may wander while admiring the girls. 
There are already a number of people who have expressed an interest in this idea. Some ofthese feel that IQs should be displayed, also. We should just take it one step at a time, but it is a nice thought. Afterall, everyone knows that GPAs and IQs are the best means of judging a person, right? 
Meaney, could you please help me to cause the transition ofthis idea from a figment ofmy imagination to a reality? It would be such a public service; and I really think we see eye to eye on this one. I sw~ar my eye ain't fixed on your legs. 
Perhaps you should show the lead for allot· her girls by sewingyour GPA onto your jacket. I really would hate to forget that men are in fact inferior to women instead of equal to them. 
Ifanyone has any ideas on how we can rein· force Meaney's superiority complex, could they let me know about It? Ifyou are like me, unfortunate enough to be a demented male, remember to drop to your knees each time you see a woman because the odds have it her GPA is higher than yours. 
One day I will be remembered for saying, "I have a dream, a dream that one day all women will display their GPAs." A day when women will be shown to be superior. It will make life so much easier when everyone has that vital number displayed. What a reality we could create, Meaney. 
Yes, a GPA means a whole lot to me, too. It Is the measuring stick by which I will gauge the success or failure ofmy life. Thank God I have a GPA. I would feel naked without one and then I would fear women would start looking at me for my body alone. Woe is me. 
You must be thanked for driving home to me the importance of this divine number. I think my GPA is a gift from God.

Much work took place in kazoo procurement 
DearEditor: 
I would like to thank Eric Hunter for his let· ter concerning the kazoos. 
Many events the Student Activities Board sponsors throughout the year go unnoticed and sometimes without appreciation. I was pleased to see that at least one person was ap­preciative of the 3,000 kazoos we gave away free to the student at the Notre Dame/Navy game. 
Believe it or not, getting 3,000 kazoos is not as easy as you might think. We went through a lot so the students could enjoy them. Thanks again, Hunter, for noticing. 

Correction 
Because of reporting and editing errors, there were a num­ber of mistakes in yesterday's story onthe Saint Mary's interhall flag football championship game. Contrary to what was stated in the headline, Holy Cross defeated McCandless. 
On Holy Cross' final drive, the game-tying touchdown was scored on a seven-yard scoring pass from Barb Dorini to janine Adams with Cathy Bove adding the extra point. 
Bove scored Holy Cross' touchdown in the overtime period on the option. The extra point was added on a reverse by Patty Petro.

Theismann fractures leg 
WASHINGTON -Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theis­
mann sustained a compound fracture of his right. leg in last night's 
game against the New York Giants and was scheduled to undergo 
surgery early this morning to repair damage, doctors said. 
Team physician Dr. Charles Jackson said Theismann could be in a 
cast for up to six months, but the doctor expressed confidence the 
36-year-old quarterback would be able to resume his National Foot­
ball League career once the injury has healed. 
Theismann, the NFL's oldest starting quarterback who has played the last 163 games for Washington, had just taken a pitchout from John Riggins on a fiea-tlicker in the second quarter when he was hit by Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor. Gary Reasons, another New York linebacker, came over the top, and Theismann's right ankle was 
twisted underneath him. 

Taylor immediately jumped up and began calling for help. 
Theismann was carried from the field on a stretcher and taken to 
Arlingon Memorial Hospital.

Irish split 2 matches, take third in tourney 
By CHUCK EHRMAN 
Sports Writer 
It was not a cheery November weekend for the Notre Dame vol­leyball team. The team's bid at a North Star Conference title in St. Louis, Mo. turned into a tale of high hopes humbled and betrayed. 
Irish head coach Art Lambert wanted nothing more than a win in the tournament, but had to settle for a somewhat different scenerio as his squad· could muster only a split in the weekend action. The one victory and one defeat meant that Notre Dame, who was runner-up in last year's tournament, would get the third-place trophy this time around. 
With the split, the Irish moved their season record to 18-11. This will change tonight, however, when Notre Dame plays host to a strong Eastern Michigan team at 7:30 p.m. at the ACC. 
At the conference tourney, meanwhile, top-dog DePaul won an expected NSC championship. The Irish never even got to play the Blue Demons, though, because of a bye which left the Irish idle on Friday. 
Notre Dame did play on Saturday, however, although this became doomsday for the Blue-and-Gold. 
In their first match the Irish faced Butler, a team that had given the Irish fits during the season. Once again this was the case, as Notre Dame fell in four games: 15-5, 11-15, 5-15 and 8-15. The loss sent the Irish scrambling for solutions. 
Lambert's troops must have found something in their search, for next up was Loyola, a team the Irish would go on to defeat for the third­place prize. In this match, Notre Dame was able to handle the Ramblers with few problems and salvage the trip to St. Louis, winning 15-13 and 1 ';-6 in the best·of-three match. 
All in all, the Irish won something and lost something in the same day. The team took third place but lost a bit ofpride along the way. 
Now the Irish must get ready for the Herons-of Eastern Michigan, a team which has established itself as a legitimate power in the NCAA. It is one of two final home matches, the final match being Saturday against nationally-ranked Arizona State. 

Rugby Club has success without campus fame 
When a team from Notre Dame is having a really success­
ful season one would expect that much of the campus 
would know about it. But there is a relatively unknown 
team which has a 9-1 record and has an honest shot at win­
ning a regional championship. 

This team is the Notre Dame Rugby Club. Quietly the team has won nine straight games and has qualified for the Midwest Rugby Union tournament in April. 
"Talent-wise this is the best team I've ever been as­sociated with," said Club President Phil Sheridan. "The teams of the past couple years have been good, but this team is the best." 
This boast is supported by the team's play in the Indiana Rugby Union Tournament. In a crucial match against Purdue, the Irish were down to the Boilermakers, 16-2, at the half. But Notre Dame fought backand evened the score at 24 on the last play ofregulation time. Then, two minutes into the sudden-death overtime, the Irish scored to win the match, 26-24. 
The tejlm proceeded to defeat Ball State and Indiana State to take the title and earn a berth in the regional tournament. 
"With the way we've been playing, I feel we definitely have a -shot at the regional title," said Sheridan. 
Perhaps the most impressive performer on this talented team is flyback Bill Young. Although the team does not have official scoring stats, Young is probably the top 
Pete Gegen 
Club Corner 

The Rugby Club will resume play a few weeks before spring break with two or three more matches before playing in the Midwest Union tournament.

The Notre Dame Women's Cross Country Club wrapped up its five-meet season last month. The team's best perfor­mance came at the Loyola (Chi.) Lakefront Invitational, where the team placed ninth out of 1 7 teams. The Irish women also ran well at the North Star Conference meet, but because of their club status they were classified as an exhibition team and were not allowed to place in the team standings. 
"Overall, we were pleased with our performance this season," said Club President Mary Beth Fiske. "We com­peted against some strong varsity programs and proved that we can be relatively competitive." 
The team was led by a trio ofsophomores, Julia Merkel, Kathleen Lehmen, and Nancy Laughlin. Injuries hurt the team as Fiske missed the entire season and senior Anne Attea was slowed by a sprained ankle. 
This year the team was fortunate in having Dan Ryan, a former all-American runner, as coach for the club. 
 
The Notre Dame Women's Soccer Club also wrapped up its season last month, finishing with a 3-7 record. Victories were recorded against St. Mary's, Hope College, and Nazareth. 
"This year we played better ball against better competi­tion," noted Club President Karen Moritz. "The freshmen did especially well. Some moved right into starting spots. 
"The future of the program looks bright," she continued. "The freshmen and the the sophomores are the type who will stay with it through senior year." 
The team moves indoor for the winter season, and will resume outdoor play in March. 


Cards' centerfielder Willie McGee gets 1985 National League MVP 

NEW YORK -Batting champion Willie McGee, the flashy center fielder of the National League cham­pion St. Louis Cardinals, was named the NL's Most Valuable Player by the Baseball Welters Association of America yesterday. 
McGee received 14 first-place votes from a 24-writer panel, two from each league city, and finished with 280 points. 

Dave Parker of the Cincinnati Reds, who led the league with 125 runs batted in, finished second with six firsts and 220 points. Pedro Guerrero of the NL West champion Los Angeles Dodgers was third with three firsts and 208 points and pitcher Dwight Gooden of the New York Mets, who won the Cy Young Award last week, finished fourth with one first and 162 points. 
Tommy Herr of St. Louis, Gary 
Carter of New York, Dale Murphy of Atlanta, Keith Hernandez of New York, John Tudor of St. Louis and Jack Clark ofSt. Louis completed the top 10. 
McGee, Parker and Guerrero were the only players listedon all 24 ballots. Points were assigned 14-9-8­7-6-5-4-3-2-1 with voters asked to list 1 0 players on their ballots. 
McGee became the ninth Cardinal player to win the NL batting title, hit­ting .353 last season. It was, the hig­hest average ever ror a NL switch hitter, topping the mark of .348 by Frankie Frisch of the New York Giants in 1923 and matched by Pete Rose in 1969. Mickey Mantle ofthe New York Yankees set the major league mark in 1957 when he batted 
.365. 
Batting second in the Cardinal lineup, McGee led the league with 216 'hits and 18 triples. He scored 114 runs, third in the league and, with rookie leadoff man Vince Coleman, served as the catalyst for the racehorse St. Louis attack which 
home  runs  in  Game  3. His  24  
putouts  in  the  seven  games  tied  
another record.  

McGee became the 14th Cardinal MVP winner since the BBWAA began the award in 1931. The last one was Hernandez, now with the New York Mets, who shared the award in 1979 with Pittsburgh's Willie Stargell. 
Gooden and Tudor, who was second in the Cy Young voting, were the only pitchers to finish in the MVPtop 10. 
The American League MVP award will be announced tomorrow night. 
being c/ul.§ed down by Los Angeles Dodger's second baseman Steve Sax tn a game last season, was named tbeNational League MVP for 
1985. More information aboutMcGee's award ts at left.
