Crime, not student parties, tops neighborhood problems 
The South Bend Tribune printed an editorial Tuesday concerning underage Notre Dame stu­dents and Indiana's 21 drinking law which I feel was rather hypocritical. I won't even get into argu­ments against the current naive and inflexible con­servative American attitude which is the root of such impractical laws eliminating the rights of adults age 18 to 20 to consume alcohol. The law's poor success in curbing alcohol abuse and con­sumption among people under 2 I speaks for it­self. 
No, what really bothers me about the editorial titled "N.D. and drinking" is its argument that off­campus drinking parties are a genuine nuisance to residents of the northeast neighborhood. That is undoubtedly true; I'm not trying to persuade anyone that noise until dawn and beer cans litter· ing his yard the following morning is desirable. 
No, what bothers me is specifically this para­graph: The South Bend Police Department and state excise police are following a much sterner policy (about cracking down on student parties in the northeast neighborhood) this year. Stu­dents should try to understand that this approach is a response to citizen complaints. Police are paid to protect those citizens. That protection includes doing something about unacceptable noise, un­ruly behavior, littering and even public urination. Few of those complaining would wish this prob­

lem visited on their own families. Yeah, and I'd bet few of those students com­plaining also have families who rob their neigh­bors. I'm so glad the South Bend Tribune is worried about protecting those citizens of the northeast neighborhood from us dastardly students. I mean, if those citizens weren't able to get their eight hours sleep, they might not be alert enough to steal our stereos, jewelry and kitchen appliances from our rented houses. Remember, the Tribune says "Police are paid to protect those citizens." Paid from what? The gains of illegally acquired goods? I realize it's not fair to generalize. Not every resident of the northeast neighborhood is a thief. Just some of them. South Bend residents might be more upset over student parties than about the rampant crime in the area because students are transient. Maybe students don't pay city property taxes (although those who hold jobs pay income taxes). but the large economic support base the University pro­vides South Bend more than compensates for that point. I doubt anyone would argue that students should be denied police protection because they are not permanent residents of the area, but it sure seems the South Bend Tribune believes crime is not as serious a problem as student parties. Otherwise they would have printed an editorial that might have said something like this:

Citizens should try to understand that this (police crackdown on crime in the northeast t1eighborhood) is a response to student com­plaints. Police are paid to protect those students. That protection includes doing something about unacceptable crime, frequent breaking and enter­ing into private residences, rocks thrown through windows, vandalism to student cars and even public flaunting of stolen goods. Few of those complaining would wish this problem on their own families. 
Numerous students in the northeast neighbor­hood have been victims of crime. One house of students reported $7,000 worth of jewelry and other items stolen. They also said one of the thieves returned later with a piece of their jewelry and tried to sell it back to them. I, personally have had a trunk I left in a friend's basement over the summer completely ransacked by burglars. The house I left it in has rocks thrown through its windows regularly. 
Admittedly, parties and their aftermath are dis· turbing nuisances to the families who live near students. Ideally. students should keep the volume on their stereos down and make sure everyone is inside for a party instead of loitering on the street. But the crime in the area is just as bad, and losing a special gold bracelet or a hard­earned stereo is a terrible thing. 
To the South Bend Tribune, I say there are two sides to an issue which they seem to consider cut-and-dried.

Daniloff cites Reagan's concern as key to release and homecoming 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Nicholas Daniloff told President Reagan Wednesday that if it hadn't been for Reagan's "very deep and per­sonal interest" in his case, he probably would have been kept in the Soviet Union for years. 
Reporter Daniloff, spending his first full day in the United States, met brieny with Reagan at the White House before the two made a joint appearance in the Rose Garden. They were joined there by Nancy Reagan, who stood next to the reporter, and Daniloff's wife, Ruth, and Daniloff's children, Miranda, 23, and Caleb, 16. 
Reagan defended the arrange­ment with the Soviets that led to Daniloff's freedom, saying: "I don't think there's caving in at all." Daniloff had been arrested Aug. 30 by the KGB and charged with spying in the Soviet Union. 
Asked whether U.S.-Soviet re­lations are back on track with Daniloff's release, the president said, "We'll find out in about I 0 days." That was a reference to the planned meeting in Iceland Oct. I 1-12 between Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. 
The meeting, described as pre­liminary discussions to a formal summit, was part of the deal en­ding in Daniloff's release. 
Daniloff, 5 I, praised Reagan for his involvement in the case. 
"This is a very complex situa­
tion and ifit hadn't been for Pres­
ident Reagan taking a very deep 
and personal interest in my case 
it would probably be some years 
before I could stand in front of 
you and say, 'Thank you, Mr Pres­
ident'." 
Earlier, Daniloff was given a 
warm welcome by co-workers in 
the lobby atrium at U.S. News & 
World Report. He said he was 
pleased with the "mini-summit" 
between the superpower leaders 
in Iceland, and wanted to cover 
it. 

"''m awfully, awfully moved," 
Daniloff said after the rousing 
welcome from colleagues who

clapped, cheered and extended their hands. "I didn't know so many people worked here." 
Daniloff said he would thank Reagan and the American offi­cials "who, I think, turned them­selves inside out" to secure his freedom. He was arrested in Mos­cow Aug. 30 on espionage charges, which the administra­tion said were phony. 
The principal lesson Daniloff said he learned from his experi­ence was that the American sys­tem emphasizes the precious­ness and the dignity of a single individual. 
The journalist arrived in the United States Tuesday, a day after Washington and Moscow worked out a multi-part deal that included a Reagan-Gorbachev meeting in Iceland Oct. I 1-12. 
The arrangement also called for the release of accused spy Gennadiy Zakharov to the Soviets. Zakharov, a Soviet em­ployee at the United Nations, new back to Moscow after he pleaded no contest to espionage charges.

Researchers develop new AIDS drugs 
Associated Press 

NEW ORLEANS -Two new ap­proaches to fighting the AIDS virus, including a drug ordinarily given to arthritis victims, have provided encouraging but pre­
liminary  results,  researchers  
said Wednesday.  
D-penicillamine,  a  medicine  

used against severe rheumatoid arthritis, blocked the AIDS virus from reproducing when given to infected but outwardly healthy men. 
"We are approaching this as a way to protect people who are currently infected" but have not yet developed the disease, said Dr. Richard Schulof of George Washington University. 
The doctors gave the drug for six weeks to five homosexual men who had swollen lymph glands but no other AIDS signs. Three of them remained free of· the virus for six weeks after they stopped taking the drug. 
A major drawback of the therapy, however, was its sup­pression of the men's T -cells, the same variety of white blood cells that are attacked by the AIDS virus. T-cells are key compo­nents of the body's immune sys­tem. 
"This is a very preliminary study, but it clearly showed anti­viral activity," said Schulof. "We are trying to find a dose that is more tolerable on a long-term basis." 
The study was presented at a meeting of the American Society for Microbiology, along with a report on another new AIDS drug that has not yet been tested on people. 
This medicine, called CS-85, appears to work similarly to AZT, the first drug found to change the course ofAIDS. Dr. Raymond Schinazi, who developed CS-85 at Emory University, said it ap­pears to be less toxic than AZT. 
Although it doesn't cure the disease, AZT prolongs victims' lives and reduces the over­whelming infections that result from the destruction of their im­mune systems. However, AZT also suppresses bone marrow cells that produce blood cells. 
Schinazi said that in the test tube, CS-85 is as effective as AZT at halting the AIDS virus. And it appears to be I 0 to I 00 times less toxic.

$556 billion package kept intact by Senate 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Senate wrestled Wednesday with the major spending bill of the new fiscal year, but the coming U.S.­Soviet summit was dampening prospects for speedy enactment. 
Trying to finish work by next week to head for the campaign trail, the Senate was keeping its $556 billion spending package clean ofamendments. In a series of votes, it turned down proposals to add a sweeping new farm program, seniority protec­tion for airline employees and new rules for tenant­management of public housing. 
Majority Leader Bob Dole, R­Kan., said he wanted to pass the bill by the weekend, so compro­mise talks with the House could be completed early next week. Congress has given itself until Oct. 8 to approve the spending program for fiscal 1987, which began Wednesday, under a stop­gap spending measure signed into law by President Reagan. 
However, it appeared a House­Senate detente would be difficult and an extension of the tempo­rary measure would be neces­sary. House Democrats were in­sisting on including in any compromise at least some of the series of arms control amend­ments contained in their $562 billion version of the bill. 
Republicans said news of the summit made it imperative that Congress not tie Reagan's hands. He meets with Soviet

Asbestos to be removed from schools

WASHINGTON -Congressional negotiators agreed Wednesday on legislation ordering the safe but costly removal of cancer­causing asbestos from up to 30,000 public schools around the country.

Stafford, speaking at a news conference, predicted easy Sen· ate approval within a week. but the bill's future with the Reagan administration was another mat· ter. 
The Environmental Protection Agency issued a statement sup­porting the bill's goals but listing its reservations about its "many regulatory requirements." EPA said it would decide in the next few days whether to recommend a veto to President Reagan.

Money and prestige can dominate job hunting 
I got back a lot of my perspective on my future career there in that funeral home, perspective that had once been firmly implanted in my idealistic mind but had been lost in the day-to-day workings of my law firm before I had even gotten out ofschool. I re-discovered that helping the client really is what being a lawyer is all about, no matter how distant the client seems from behind the desk. 
Now, today, as I sit down to plan tor more interviews, that perspective tries to sneak away again. The temptation of the big dollar sometimes makes me turn to the salary section of the tlrm resumes rather than to the section that describes the atmosphere of the firm or the kind of work it does. The temptation ofa pres­tigious tlrm pulls me away from the simplicity of my Hoosier roots and toward the hidden traps of the big city. 
I don't want to make my career decision based on how much money I'm going to be making or how famous my new firm is. I'm not crazy, either -I'd be lying if I said salary won't be a factor in my final choice. Ijust don't want it to be the factor that determines how I finally decide. Still, the temptation to go for the big money haunts me, and I can't figure out why. Maybe if I took off this damn red tie ... There, that's more like it. 
Recruiting season is back in full swing and all those people you see out there running around in dark suits, white shirts and red "power" ties are just us law stu­dents, desperately trying to get a job... finally. 
With the possible exception of final ex­ams, recruiting season has to be the most fustrating, least enjoyable time of year on campus. Even the last five football seasons didn't curdle as many stomachs as one good, solid week of interviews. The haircuts, the dresses, the polished shoes ... they're all signs that students' priorities have suddenly shifted. 
Mike Wilkins 

here, there and back 
Something crazy happens to our brains when we're on the job hunt. I've never made more than six dollars an hour in my life but I recently found myself whining because a tlrm I was interested In was only paying $30,000 a year. I have no idea what it's like to make $30,000 a year and no idea why I would ever think that wasn't enough money for me to get started on. My father probably makes about $30,000 a year and he's taking care of a wife, two kids, three cars, a house, a lake cottage, and a fat cocker spaniel. My goal when I get out of school is to have enough money to buy season tickets to see the Indianapolis Checkers' games. I think $30,000 will probably cut it. 
The worst thing about interviews is that as soon as anybody mentions the word 'job," we all tend to forget everything we've every learned here. I don't mean we can't remember which side is the as­sets and which side is the liabilities, I mean we forget the way we've been taught to use what we've learned when we finally venture out there beyond Juniper Road. Suddenly money and prestige and perks become more important than having a good job and doing a good job at it. 
It's easy to lose your perspective when you're on the job market or even after you're on the job. Principles become fuzzy when they're pushed beyond the desire to excel and the struggle to the top. Sometimes it's hard to remember just what exactly you're doing. Clients be­come job numbers and co-workers be­come obstacles to success. 
I had a rough experience that really put 
the perspective back into what I was doing 
this summer. I was clerking at a law tlrm 
in my hometown and was assigned a fairly 
broad range of cases. I a_)most always 
spoke of my cases according to the legal 
theory involved in each. The client, who 
was the real reason I was doing all this 
work to begin with, was essential only as 
far as he gave a title to the case I was 
working on. I knew the names of all my 
clients and had met or spoken to most 
of them as well. But to some degree they 
were't really people, they were just legal 
theories. 
One of my cases involved a client who had been ripped off in a contract for the

Ridiculously large lines make eating difficult 
Dear Editor: 

I would like to use this opportunity and public forum to extend a heartfelt thanks to the anonymous administrative whiz who, thinking only of the students in the finest Judea-Christian tradition of self­lessness, designed Notre Dame's dining hall system. When I and countless thousands of other equally gluttonous students swarm towards a despicible, or­giastic feeding frenzy after 12:05, we are saved from our own base, self-destructive cravings by a system which forces us to recognize the emptiness and bankruptcy of unchecked lust for sustinence. A huge crowd daily gathers at the dining hall clamouring for entrance and hedonistic 
Doonesbury 

consumption. The stalwart system, however, resists the pressure of these masses and admits only a tricke of stu­dents. The food-crazed youths, who often face a 1: 15 class, become discouraged by the size of the crowd and abandon their vile, contemtable mission. 
Some leftists may claim that enforced good behavior strips the individual offree will and cheapens the significance of the good act. I scoff at these lilly-livered secularists who would sell our futures for a vat ofveal marango. The furtherance of moderate living is a noble achievement regardless of the means. 
Thanks again to that far-sighted admin­istrator and the system he created.

sale of some animals. I had met with the 
client a couple of times and had spoken 
to him over the phone. Yet, he wasn't 
really real. I never spoke of his case as 
"Mr. X's case," but always as "the 
negligent misrepresentation case." The 
client wasjust the guy to whom the theory 
applied. 

One day toward the end of summer, this client's 16-year-old son was killed in a freak automobile accident. The attorney who was handing the case was out of town, so I had to go to the funeral home to represent the firm. It was, without question, the worst thing I had to do all summer, but it taught me more about being a lawyer than probably anything I could ever do in the office or in the library. 
The funeral home wasn't filled with doc­uments and exhibits and depositions. It wasn't even filled with the defendant, the opposing counsel or the witnesses. It was tllled with people -real people, my 
people, my client included. He was no longer just a legal theory, he was a real man, a man with a family he loved, a man with regular everyday problems just like myself. For some strange reason, I had never thought of him as just a regular man, a guy who goes home and sits down at the dinner table with his family each night or sits up wondering what time his kids will be in. But I saw him consoling other members of his family, I remem­bered that all summer I had been representing a man, not just a legal the­ory.

The Saint Mary's soccer team 
suffered two more losses at 
home last weekend, bringing its 
record to 2-7. 

On Saturday the Belles' show­
down with Purdue ended in a 4-I 
defeat. 

The sole Saint Mary's goal was 
scored in the first half by fresh­
man Molly Meehan. At the half, 
the score was 2-I Purdue, but 
the Belles were playing well. 
"We gave up two goals early," 
said coach John Akers, "but 
dominated 45 minutes of playing 
time." 

The Belles simply were unable to score the necessary goals. "We could not get the ball in the net." Akers said. On Sunday, Saint Mary's took on Siena Heights and lost, 3-0. 
"They (Siena Heights) put a lot of pressure on us early and were beating us to the ball," said Akers.

Change was in the air when spring drills rolled around that year. Bobb was moved to the other side of the line of scrim­mage to the fullback position. 
'They were looking for a third fullback," he says. "I had alot of doubt. I weighed only 185 pounds, but they wanted to try me." 
The fullback position pre­sented two problems for Bobb. One problem was he had not played the position since high school. and was slightly rusty on technique. The other was the competition against Pernell Taylor, who was just coming off knee surgery. 
"We were friends," he says. "It 
seemed like we were battling each other for the third fullback spot.

Winfield 
looks for 
some peace 


Associated Press 
NEW YORK -After five straight 100 RBI seasons, outfielder Dave Winfield of the New York Yankees isn't looking for accolades, only peace and quiet. 
"I really would like next year and any successive year to play the game without it," Winfield said of his constant verbal battle with Yankees' owner George Steinbrenner. "You don't have to praise me and pat me on the back, just leave me alone in a supportive atmosphere. 
"I don't know if I would con­sider this exten\:ling a palm leaf, but it would be interesting to be supportive and see what kind of productivity I could get." 
Winfield, who signed a $23.3 million, I 0-year contract with the Yankees before the 1981 season, is closing out another productive season and one of the stormiest years with Steinbrenner in the pair's often turbulent relation­ship. 
When Winfield knocked in two 
runs in Monday night's 8-I vic­
tory over Toronto, he became the 
first Yankees' player to drive in 
100 runs five consecutive 
seasons since Joe DiMaggio had 
a seven-year streak between 
1936-1942. 
His .263 average, 24 homers 
and 102 RBI going into Wednes­
day night's game have kept 
Steinbrenner quiet on Winfield 
lately. But when Winfield was the 
last Yankees' player to report to 
spring training this season, 
Steinbrenner was upset. 
"It tells me something about 
the man," he said. 
A .222 average at midseason had the right-handed hitting Win­field benched against right­handed pitchers, at Steinbren­ner's insistence, although the .34-year-old outfielder was named to the starting lineup for the American League in the All­Star Game. 
The All-Star selection gave Winfield a chance to fire back, wondering aloud how an all-star player could be sitting on the bench. 
"I still try to treat baseball as 
a game and try to have fun," he 
said. "But sometimes it becomes 
so much ofa business that it isn't 
fun. I don't want to have to deal -with defending myself. I think I do pretty well every day."

CFA thriving on strong relations.hip with TV networks 
ND volleyball earns four-game win ; 
despite 'trash' from Lady Saints 
By RICK RIETBROCK 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame head coach Art Lambert was angry about trash last night. But not the kind that gets hauled away in a truck. 
Instead, it was the St. Francis Lady Saints' hitting attack that was the source of his anguish. Behind a series of dinks, dumps and tips, the Lady Saints topped the Irish in the first game of a best-of-five match before Notre Dame came back to sweep the last three games. 
"It was trash, but if it works it's smart" he said, referring to the St. Francis attack. "They knew where we were vulnerable, but I think we adjusted to ti-Jat style fairly well the rest of the way." 
St. Francis came flying out of the gates in game one and scored the first five points of the match. The Irish were caught a bit flat-footed and found them­selves a half-step too late on

Bobb gaining fame in starting role 
By PETE GEGEN 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Though he only started in his 
ilrst game last week, the James 
Bobb Fan Club is already form­
ing. 
Bobb, a senior free safety for the Irish, got his first starting as­signment in the 41-9 Notre Dame victory over Purdue. He recorded three tackles and broke up a pass on a fourth-and-goal play against the Boilermakers. 
But the group that watches Bobb's every move on the field also knows him away from the football field. The group is made up of children Bobb works with at Logan Center. 
"I'd been hearing about Logan Center as a freshman, and I was curious," he said. "So my room­mate (Dan Coughlin) and I went over one day, and we really had a good time. I just got hooked." 
The kids got hooked on Bobb also. This season, they made a giant banner for the home games which reads, "James

(Editor's note -Today The Observer con­tinues its three-part series on the College Football Association and its impact on college football. Today's second part takes a look at the CFA and television.) 
The College Football Association has burst onto the scene in the last three years to provide not only more quality college football games each Saturday, but a vital forum of top college programs for dis­cussion of problems and changes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. 
The CFA is thriving, and one ofthe main cogs spurring it on to increasing popularity has been and will continue to be its excellent relationship with the tele­vision networks. 
"The CFA today," said Notre Dame Ath­letic Director Gene Corrigan, "is known more than anything else as being a tele­vision entity. Itessentially negotiates tele­vision contracts for 63 schools." 
In 198 L several CFA schools tried to strike out on their own and organize a separate television package with NBC. 
most shots as they dropped a 15-13 decision_ 
The second game, a 15-5 Irish victory, featured the combina­tion of freshman setter Taryn Collins and sophomore Mary Kay Waller and a lot of sloppy play_ Waller finished with eight kills to go along with a bundle of blocks, but Lambert could not forget the sloppiness. 
"Different referees call differ­ent types of games, but that second game got really bad," he said. "I thought that one hit was a forward pass." 
In the third game, the Lady Saints started to self-destruct and Notre Dame continued to get stronger. An all-around better ef­fort featured some good block­ing from Zanette Bennett and Maureen Shea, and the solid passing of Collins paved the way to a 15-7 Notre Dame win. 
Game four had "rout" written all over it as the Irish jumped out to an 8-3 lead behind good work from Kathy Morin, Shea and Ben-
Bobb 19 Go Irish." And the en­tire group will be in attendance at the Penn State game to cheer on the Irish and Bobb. 
The children from Logan are 

JamesBobb 
not the only ones to recognize Bobb on the field. 
"Free safety is his natural po­sition," noted Irish secondary coach Terry Forbes. "It helps to have a man of the character like 
When the NCAA threatened these schools with sanctions such as probationary status in other major sports if the NBC deal went through, the CFA launched and won an anti-trust suit against the NCAA. From that time on, the CFA has held good standing with the networks. 
Up until this year, ABC and ESPN have covered CFA contests. However, the CFA is now in the process of wrapping up a four-year deal with CBS and ESPN. Bid-

The CFA 
ding was heavy for the contract another evidence of the CFA's improving status. 
"We are extremely satisfied with the new contract" said a spokesperson for Chuck Neinas, executive director of the CFA. "Although the deal hasn't been finalized yet, we're confident that the present terms will be settled upon without a hitch, and that both parties will benefit substantially." 
Jim Bobb has. He gives his best every time. He has good skills and good speed for a free safety, and has the ability to hit." 
After stints at the strong­safety, fullback, and cornerback positions, Bobb made the transi­tion to free safety last spring when Steve Lawrence was out with a knee injury. Now the two share the free-safety job. 
"I really don't mind," says Bobb on sharing the position. "You're going to have injuries. It's all a part of college football -you've got to have depth. 
"It's nice for the secondary to be two-deep, for the second team to play just as well as the first team." 
It took three years for Bobb to finally get settled in his natural position. 
In his sophomore year, Bobb was the backup strong safety to Joe Johnson. He saw action in eight games, recording six tackles. 
see 8088, page 9 

nett. But poor passes, missed serves and a final surge by St. Francis tied it at eight. 
Bennett then went on a binge with four kills and the Irish cruised to a 15-8 win. 
Lambert said this match showed the Irish what needs to be done to move up one more notch in its performance. 
"A good team has got to make adjustments to the style of the opponent and the referees," he said. "Once we learn to do that we're going to be a fine team." 
The Irish will put their I -0 North Star Conference record on the line against two tough con­ference opponents this weekend with Marquette visiting on Friday and DePaul coming Saturday. Both Kathy Cunningham and Whitney Shewman, who sat out last night's game because of ten­donitis in their knees, should be ready to play this weekend. 
Both matches are at the ACC 
Pit beginning at 7:30 p.m. 
Corrigan agrees and understands that a deal of this magnitude is a step in the right direction for the CFA and college football in general. 

The Observer /Mike Moran 
Zanette Bennett of the Notre Dame volleyball team follows through on a kill in action earlier this season. Rick Rietbrock has the details on last night's victory in his story at left. 
Bowling Green tops Irish in physical contest, 3-1 
Special to The Observer 

In a physical contest the Notre Dame soccer team lost to Bowling Green, 3-I, yester­day in Ohio. 
A total of 59 fouls and four yellow cards were called against both teams. 
After taking a 1-0 halftime lead, Bowling Green's Tom Kasten scored a goal at the 
67:27 mark after taking a punt 
pointed in the Pac I 0 and the Big I 0, but overall, I'm very pleased." 
Since the formation of the CFA, The Pac I 0 and Big I 0 conferences have refused tojoin the group, and next year ABC plans to televise games involving those confer­ences. This idea worries Corrigan, not be­cause of the competition, but because of the implications of the move within the sport itself. 
"The last thing we need," said Corrigan, "is their conferences against the CFA in a bidding war for network television con­tracts. If their try with a major network flops because there are fewer teams (20 against the CFA's 63) and no eastern teams involved, it's not good for the sport and so it's not good for the CFA." 
But with more cable-television possibil­ities yet to be explored and the signing ofa new four-year deal in the offing, there is plenty of promise in the CFA camp. This year's Notre Dame-Michigan game attracted the largest television audience for a regular-season college football game in three years. 
No wonder they're optimistic. "No," said Corrigan, "I don't foresee the CFA's downfall for quite a while."

Irish sweeper Pat Szanto cut the lead to 2-I with a goal at the 73:08 mark off a set play run by forward Bill Gross. 
Notre Dame, however, hurt itself when it deflected a punt from Loescher past keeper Hugh Breslin into its own net with only two minutes left to play. Loescher was credited with his second assist of the afternoon on that goal.
